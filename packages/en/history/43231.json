Crowned by the French Academy.\r\n\r\n     _Die Bastille in der Legende und nach historischen Documenten._\r\n     German translation by Oscar Marschall von Bieberstein. Breslau:\r\n     Schottlaender, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his own entertaining way, Mr. Andrew Lang has recently been taking\r\nthe scientific historian to task, and giving him a very admirable lesson\r\non \"history as she ought to be wrote.\" But though the two professors to\r\nwhom he mainly addresses himself are Frenchmen, it would be doing an\r\ninjustice to France to infer that she is the _alma mater_ of the modern\r\ndryasdust. The exact contrary is the case: France is rich in historical\r\nwriters like the Comte d'Haussonville, M. de Maulde la Clavière, M.\r\nGaston Boissier, to name only a few, who know how to be accurate without\r\nbeing dull.\r\n\r\nM. Funck-Brentano, whom I have the honour of introducing here to the\r\nEnglish public, belongs to the same class. Of literary parentage and\r\nconnections--his uncle is Professor Lujo Brentano, whose work on the\r\nEnglish trade gilds is a standard--he entered in his twentieth year the\r\nÉcole des Chartes, the famous institution which trains men in the\r\nmethods of historical research. At the end of his three years' course,\r\nhe was appointed to succeed François Ravaisson in the work of\r\nclassifying the archives of the Bastille in the Arsenal Library,--a work\r\nwhich occupied him for more than ten years. One fruit of it is to be\r\nseen in the huge catalogue of more than one thousand pages, printed\r\nunder official auspices and awarded the Prix Le Dissez de Penanrum by\r\nthe Académie des Sciences morales et politiques. Another is the present\r\nwork, which has been crowned by the French Academy. Meanwhile M.\r\nFunck-Brentano had been pursuing his studies at the Sorbonne and at\r\nNancy, and his French thesis for the doctorate in letters was a volume\r\non the origins of the Hundred Years' War, which obtained for him the\r\nhighest possible distinction for a work of erudition in France, the\r\nGrand Prix Gobert. This volume he intends to follow up with two others,\r\ncompleting a social rather than a military history of the war, and this\r\nno doubt he regards as his _magnum opus_. He is known also as a lecturer\r\nin Belgium and Alsace as well as in Paris, and being general secretary\r\nof the Société des Etudes historiques and deputy professor of history at\r\nthe College of France as well as sub-librarian of the Arsenal Library,\r\nhe leads a busy life.\r\n\r\nTrained in the rigorous methods of the École des Chartes and inspired by\r\nthe examples of Fustel de Coulanges and M. Paul Meyer, M. Funck-Brentano\r\nhas developed a most interesting and conscientious method of his own. He\r\ndepends on original sources, and subjects these to the most searching\r\ncritical tests; but this is a matter of course: his individuality\r\nappears in regard to the publication of the results of his researches.\r\nWhen he has discoveries of importance to communicate, he gives them to\r\nthe world first in the form of articles or studies in reviews of\r\nstanding, thus preparing public opinion, and at the same time affording\r\nopportunities for the search-light of criticism to play on his work.\r\nSome of the chapters of this book thus appeared in the various _revues_,\r\nand have subsequently gone through a severe process of pruning and\r\namending. It is now eleven years since the first appearance, in the\r\npages of the _Revue des deux Mondes_, of the study of Latude which, in a\r\nmuch altered shape, now forms one of the most interesting portions of\r\nthis book. The coming autumn will see the publication in France of a\r\nstriking work by M. Funck-Brentano on the amazing poison-dramas at Louis\r\nXIV.'s court, and of this book also the several sections have been\r\nappearing at intervals for several years past.\r\n\r\nThe present work, as I have already said, is the fruit of many years of\r\nresearch. Its startling revelations, so well summarized in M. Victorien\r\nSardou's Introduction, have revolutionized public opinion in France, and\r\nin particular the solution of the old problem of the identity of the Man\r\nin the Iron Mask has been accepted as final by all competent critics.\r\nThe _Athenæum_, in reviewing the book in its French form the other day,\r\nsaid that it must be taken cautiously as an ingenious bit of special\r\npleading, and that the Bastille appears in M. Funck-Brentano's pages in\r\naltogether too roseate hues, suggesting further that no such results\r\ncould be obtained without prejudice from the same archives as those on\r\nwhich Charpentier founded his _La Bastille dévoilée_ in 1789. This\r\ncriticism seems to me to ignore several important points. Charpentier's\r\nbook, written in the heat of the revolutionary struggle, is not a\r\nhistory, but a political pamphlet, which, in the nature of the case, was\r\nbound to represent the Bastille as a horror. Moreover, Charpentier could\r\nonly have depended superficially on the archives, which, as M.\r\nFunck-Brentano shows, were thrown into utter disorder on the day of the\r\ncapture of the Bastille. The later writer, on the other hand, approached\r\nthe subject when the revolutionary ardours had quite burnt out, and with\r\nthe independent and dispassionate mind of a trained official. He spent\r\nthirteen years in setting the rediscovered archives in order, after his\r\npredecessor Ravaisson had already spent a considerable time at the same\r\nwork. He was able, further (as Charpentier certainly was not), to\r\ncomplete and check the testimony of the archives by means of the memoirs\r\nof prisoners--the Abbé Morellet, Marmontel, Renneville, Dumouriez, and a\r\nhost of others. In these circumstances it would be surprising if his\r\nconclusions were not somewhat different from those of Charpentier a\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe gravamen of the _Athenæun's_ objection is that M. Funck-Brentano's\r\ndescription of the treatment of prisoners in the Bastille applies only\r\nto the favoured few, the implication being that M. Funck-Brentano has\r\nshut his eyes to the cases of the larger number. But surely the reviewer\r\nmust have read the book too rapidly. M. Funck-Brentano shows, by means\r\nof existing and accessible documents, that the fact of being sent to the\r\nBastille at all was itself, in the eighteenth century at least, a mark\r\nof favour. Once at the Bastille, the prisoner, whoever he might be, was\r\ntreated without severity, unless he misbehaved. Prisoners of no social\r\nimportance, such as Renneville, Latude (a servant's love-child),\r\nTavernier (son of a house-porter), were fed and clothed and cared for\r\nmuch better than they would have been outside the prison walls. A young\r\nman named Estival de Texas, who was being exiled to Canada because he\r\nwas a disgrace to his family, wrote to the minister of Paris on June 22,\r\n1726, from the roadstead of La Rochelle: \"Your lordship is sending me to\r\na wild country, huddled with mean wretches, and condemned to a fare very\r\ndifferent from what your lordship granted me in the Bastille.\" Here was\r\na friendless outcast looking back regretfully on his prison fare! On\r\nFebruary 6, 1724, one of the king's ministers wrote to the lieutenant\r\nof police: \"I have read to the duke of Bourbon the letter you sent me\r\nabout the speeches of M. Quéhéon, and his royal highness has instructed\r\nme to send you an order and a _lettre de cachet_ authorizing his removal\r\nto the Bastille. But as he thinks that this is _an honour the fellow\r\nlittle deserves_, he wishes you to postpone the execution of the warrant\r\nfor three days, in order to see if Quéhéon will not take the hint and\r\nleave Paris as he was commanded.\" It is on such documents as these,\r\nwhich are to be seen in hundreds at the Arsenal Library in Paris, that\r\nM. Funck-Brentano has founded his conclusions. Anyone who attacks him on\r\nhis own ground is likely to come badly off.\r\n\r\nWith M. Funck-Brentano's permission, I have omitted the greater part of\r\nhis footnotes, which are mainly references to documents inaccessible to\r\nthe English reader. On the other hand, I have ventured to supply a few\r\nfootnotes in explanation of such allusions as the Englishman not reading\r\nFrench (and the translation is intended for no others) might not\r\nunderstand. On the same principle I have attempted rhymed renderings of\r\ntwo or three scraps of verse quoted from Regnier and Voltaire, to whom I\r\nmake my apologies. The proofs have had the advantage of revision by M.\r\nFunck-Brentano, who is, however, in no way responsible for any\r\nshortcomings. The Index appears in the English version alone.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Latude and the views of the Bastille are reproduced from\r\nphotographs of the originals specially taken by M. A. Bresson, of 40 Rue\r\nde Passy, Paris.\r\n\r\nGEORGE MAIDMENT.\r\n\r\n_August, 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                           1\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHIVES                                                          47\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE BASTILLE                                               57\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE BASTILLE                                                  85\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN IN THE IRON MASK                                             114\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMEN OF LETTERS IN THE BASTILLE                                       147\r\n\r\n  I.

And the guide\r\nsaid to you, not without emotion, \"You see here the unfortunate Latude,\r\nwho remained in this position, with both arms thus chained behind his\r\nback, for thirty-five years!\"\r\n\r\nThis information I completed by adding in the same tone: \"And it was in\r\nthis attitude that he so cleverly constructed the ladder, a hundred and\r\neighty feet long, which enabled him to escape.\"\r\n\r\nThe company looked at me with surprise, the guide with a scowl, and I\r\nslipped away.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations that prompted my intervention have suggested to\r\nM. Funck-Brentano this work on the Bastille, in which he has set the\r\nfacts in their true light, and confronted the legends which everyone\r\nknows with the truth of which many are in ignorance.\r\n\r\nFor in spite of all that has been written on the subject by Ravaisson,\r\nin the introduction to his _Archives of the Bastille_, by Victor\r\nFournel, in his _Men of the Fourteenth of July_, and by other writers,\r\nthe popular idea of the internal administration of the Bastille in 1789\r\nholds by the description of Louis Blanc: \"Iron cages, recalling\r\nPlessis-les-Tours[1] and the tortures of Cardinal La Balue![2]--underground\r\ndungeons, the loathsome haunts of toads, lizards, enormous rats,\r\nspiders--the whole furniture consisting of one huge stone covered with a\r\nlittle straw, where the prisoner breathed poison in the very air....\r\nEnveloped in the shades of mystery, kept in absolute ignorance of the\r\ncrime with which he was charged, and the kind of punishment awaiting\r\nhim, he ceased to belong to the earth!\"\r\n\r\nIf this Bastille of melodrama ever had any existence, the Bastille of\r\nthe eighteenth century bore the least possible resemblance to it. In\r\n1789, these dungeons on the ground floor of the fortress, with windows\r\nlooking on the moats, were no longer reserved, as under Louis XV., for\r\nprisoners condemned to death, dangerous madmen, or prisoners who had\r\nbeen insolent, obstreperous, or violent; nor for warders guilty of\r\nbreaches of discipline. At the time of Necker's first ministry, the use\r\nof these dungeons had been abolished altogether.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, put through an interrogation in the early days of his\r\ndetention, was never left in ignorance of the \"delinquency\" with which\r\nhe was charged, and had no reason to be concerned about the kind of\r\npunishment awaiting him; for there had been neither torture nor\r\npunishment of any kind at the Bastille for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nInstead of a dungeon or a cage of iron, every prisoner occupied a room\r\nof fair size, its greatest defect being that it was rather poorly\r\nlighted by a narrow window, secured by bars, some of them projecting\r\ninwards. It was sufficiently furnished; and there was nothing to hinder\r\nthe prisoner from getting in more furniture from outside. Moreover, he\r\ncould procure whatever clothing and linen he desired, and if he had no\r\nmeans to pay for them, money was supplied. Latude complained of\r\nrheumatism, and furs were at once given him. He wanted a dressing-gown\r\nof \"red-striped calamanco\"; the shops were ransacked to gratify him. A\r\ncertain Hugonnet complained that he had not received the shirts \"with\r\nembroidered ruffles\" which he had asked for. A lady named Sauvé wanted a\r\ndress of white silk spotted with green flowers. In all Paris there was\r\nonly a white dress with green stripes to be found, with which it was\r\nhoped that she would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nEvery room was provided with a fireplace or a stove. Firewood was\r\nsupplied, and light; the prisoner could have as many candles as he\r\npleased. Paper, pens, and ink were at his disposal; though he was\r\ndeprived of them temporarily if he made bad use of them, like Latude,\r\nwho scribbled all day long only to heap insults in his letters on the\r\ngovernor and the lieutenant of police. He could borrow books from the\r\nlibrary, and was at liberty to have books sent in from outside. La\r\nBeaumelle had six hundred volumes in his room. He might breed birds,\r\ncats, and dogs--by no means being reduced to taming the legendary spider\r\nof Pellisson,[3] which figures also in the story of Lauzun,[4] and,\r\nindeed, of all prisoners in every age. Instruments of music were\r\nallowed. Renneville played the fiddle, and Latude the flute. There were\r\nconcerts in the prisoners' rooms and in the apartments of the governor.\r\n\r\nEvery prisoner could work at embroidery, at the turning lathe, or the\r\njoiner's bench, at pleasure. All whose conduct was irreproachable were\r\nallowed to come and go, to pay each other visits, to play at\r\nbackgammon, cards, or chess in their rooms; at skittles, bowls, or\r\n_tonneau_[5] in the courtyard. La Rouërie asked for a billiard table for\r\nhimself and his friends, and he got it.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were permitted to walk on the platform of the fortress,\r\nfrom which they could see the people passing up and down the Rue\r\nSaint-Antoine and the vicinity, and watch the animated crowds on the\r\nboulevard at the hours when fashionable people were accustomed to take\r\ntheir drives. By the aid of telescopes and big letters written on boards\r\nthey were able to communicate with the people of the neighbourhood, and,\r\nlike Latude, to keep up a secret correspondence with the grisettes of\r\nthe district. Michelet, with too obvious a design, declares that under\r\nLouis XVI. the regulations of the prison were more severe than under\r\nLouis XV., and that this promenade on the platform was done away with.\r\nThere is not a word of truth in it. The promenade was forbidden only to\r\nthose prisoners who, like the Marquis de Sade, took advantage of it to\r\nstir up riots among the passers-by; and from the accession of Louis\r\nXVI. and the visitation of Malesherbes,[6] the rule of the prison grew\r\nmilder day by day.\r\n\r\nCertain of the prisoners were invited to dine with the governor, and to\r\nwalk in his gardens, in excellent company. Some were allowed to leave\r\nthe fortress, on condition of returning in the evening; others were even\r\nallowed to remain out all night!\r\n\r\nThose who had servants could have them in attendance if the servants\r\nwere willing to share their captivity. Or they had room-mates, as was\r\nthe case with Latude and Allègre.\r\n\r\nIn regard to food, the prisoners are unanimous in declaring that it was\r\nabundant and good. \"I had five dishes at dinner,\" says Dumouriez, \"and\r\nfive at supper, without reckoning dessert.\" The Provost de Beaumont\r\ndeclared that he had quitted the Bastille with regret, because there he\r\nhad been able to eat and drink to his heart's content. Poultier\r\nd'Elmotte says: \"M. de Launey had many a friendly chat with me, and\r\nsent me what dishes I wished for.\" Baron Hennequin, a hypochondriac who\r\nfound fault with everything, confesses nevertheless that they gave him\r\nmore meat than he could eat. The Abbé de Buquoy affirms that he fared\r\nsumptuously, and that it was the king's intention that the prisoners\r\nshould be well fed. The splenetic Linguet owns, in his pamphlet, that he\r\nhad three good meals a day, and that meat was supplied to him in such\r\nquantities that his suspicions were aroused: \"They meant to poison me!\"\r\nhe says. But he omits to say that de Launey sent him every morning the\r\nmenu for the day, on which he marked down with his own hand the dishes\r\nhe fancied, \"choosing always the most dainty, and in sufficient\r\nquantities to have satisfied five or six epicures.\"\r\n\r\nIn Louis XIV.'s time, Renneville drew up the following list of dishes\r\nserved to him: \"Oysters, prawns, fowls, capons, mutton, veal, young\r\npigeons; forcemeat pies and patties; asparagus, cauliflower, green peas,\r\nartichokes; salmon, soles, pike, trout, every kind of fish whether\r\nfresh-water or salt; pastry, and fruits in their season.\" We find Latude\r\ncomplaining that the fowls given him were not stuffed! M.\r\nFunck-Brentano tells the amusing story of Marmontel's eating by mistake\r\nthe dinner intended for his servant, and finding it excellent.\r\n\r\nMdlle. de Launay, afterwards Madame de Staal, who was imprisoned for\r\ncomplicity in the Cellamare[7] plot, relates that on the first evening\r\nof her sojourn in the Bastille, she and her maid were both terrified by\r\nthe strange and prolonged sound, beneath their feet, of a mysterious\r\nmachine, which conjured up visions of an instrument of torture. When\r\nthey came to inquire, they found that their room was over the kitchen,\r\nand the terrible machine was the roasting-jack!\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were not only allowed to receive visits from their\r\nrelations and friends, but to keep them to dinner or to make up a\r\nrubber. Thus Madame de Staal held receptions in the afternoon, and in\r\nthe evening there was high play. \"And this time,\" she says, \"was the\r\nhappiest in my life.\"\r\n\r\nBussy-Rabutin received the whole court, and all his friends--especially\r\nthose of the fair sex. M. de Bonrepos--an assumed name--was so\r\ncomfortable in the Bastille that when he was directed to retire to the\r\nInvalides,[8] he could only be removed by force.\r\n\r\n\"I there spent six weeks,\" says Morellet, \"so pleasantly, that I chuckle\r\nto this day when I think of them.\" And when he left, he exclaimed: \"God\r\nrest those jolly tyrants!\"\r\n\r\nVoltaire remained there for twelve days, with a recommendation from the\r\nlieutenant of police that he should be treated with all the\r\nconsideration \"due to his genius.\"\r\n\r\nThe objection may be raised that these cases are all of great lords or\r\nmen of letters, towards whom the government of those days was\r\nexceptionally lenient. (How delightful to find writers put on the same\r\nfooting with peers!) But the objection is groundless.\r\n\r\nI have referred to Renneville and Latude, prisoners of very little\r\naccount. The one was a spy; the other a swindler. In the three-volume\r\nnarrative left us by Renneville, you hear of nothing but how he kept\r\nopen house and made merry with his companions. They gambled and smoked,\r\nate and drank, fuddled and fought, gossiped with their neighbours of\r\nboth sexes, and passed one another pastry and excellent wine through the\r\nchimneys. How gladly the prisoners in our jails to-day would accommodate\r\nthemselves to such a life! Renneville, assuredly, was not treated with\r\nthe same consideration as Voltaire; but, frankly, would you have wished\r\nit?\r\n\r\nAs to Latude--who was supplied with dressing-gowns to suit his\r\nfancy--the reader will see from M. Funck-Brentano's narrative that no\r\none but himself was to blame if he did not dwell at Vincennes[9] or in\r\nthe Bastille on the best of terms--or even leave his prison at the\r\nshortest notice, by the front gate, and with a well-lined pocket.\r\n\r\nFor that was one of the harsh measures of this horrible Bastille--to\r\nsend away the poor wretches, when their time was expired, with a few\r\nhundred livres in their pockets, and to compensate such as were found to\r\nbe innocent! See what M. Funck-Brentano says of Subé, who, for a\r\ndetention of eighteen days, received 3000 livres (£240 to-day), or of\r\nothers, who, after an imprisonment of two years, were consoled with an\r\nannual pension of 2400 francs of our reckoning. Voltaire spent twelve\r\ndays in the Bastille, and was assured of an annual pension of 1200\r\nlivres for life. What is to be said now of our contemporary justice,\r\nwhich, after some months of imprisonment on suspicion, dismisses the\r\npoor fellow, arrested by mistake, with no other indemnity than the\r\nfriendly admonition: \"Go! and take care we don't catch you again!\"\r\n\r\nSome wag will be sure to say that I am making out the Bastille to have\r\nbeen a palace of delight. We can spare him his little jest. A prison is\r\nalways a prison, however pleasant it may be; and the best of cheer is no\r\ncompensation for the loss of liberty. But there is a wide difference, it\r\nwill be granted, between the reality and the notion generally\r\nheld--between this \"hotel for men of letters,\" as some one called it,\r\nand the hideous black holes of our system of solitary confinement. I\r\nonce said that I should prefer three years in the Bastille to three\r\nmonths at Mazas.[10] I do not retract.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLinguet and Latude, unquestionably, were the two men whose habit of\r\ndrawing the long bow has done most to propagate the fables about the\r\nBastille, the falsity of which is established by incontrovertible\r\ndocuments. Party spirit has not failed to take seriously the interested\r\ncalumnies of Linguet, who used his spurious martyrdom to advertise\r\nhimself, and the lies of Latude, exploiting to good purpose a captivity\r\nwhich he had made his career.\r\n\r\nLet us leave Linguet, who, after having so earnestly urged the\r\ndemolition of the Bastille, had reason to regret it at the Conciergerie\r\nat the moment of mounting the revolutionary tumbril, and speak a little\r\nof the other, this captive who was as ingenious in escaping from prison,\r\nwhen locked up, as in hugging his chains when offered the means of\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nFor the bulk of mankind, thirty-five years of captivity was the price\r\nLatude paid for a mere practical joke: the sending to Madame de\r\nPompadour of a harmless powder that was taken for poison. The punishment\r\nis regarded as terrific: I do not wonder at it. But if, instead of\r\nrelying on the gentleman's own fanfaronades, the reader will take the\r\ntrouble to look at the biography written by M. Funck-Brentano and amply\r\nsupported by documents, he will speedily see that if Latude remained in\r\nprison for thirty-five years, it was entirely by his own choice; and\r\nthat his worst enemy, his most implacable persecutor, the author of all\r\nhis miseries was--himself.\r\n\r\nIf, after the piece of trickery which led to his arrest, he had followed\r\nthe advice of the excellent Berryer, who counselled patience and\r\npromised his speedy liberation, he might have got off with a few months\r\nof restraint at Vincennes, where his confinement was so rigorous that he\r\nhad only to push the garden gate to be free!\r\n\r\nThat was the first folly calculated to injure his cause, for the new\r\nfault was more serious than the old. He was caught; he was locked in the\r\ncells of the Bastille: but the kind-hearted Berryer soon removed him.\r\nInstead of behaving himself quietly, however, our man begins to grow\r\nrestless, to harangue, to abuse everybody, and on the books lent him to\r\nscribble insulting verses on the Pompadour. But they allow him an\r\napartment, then give him a servant, then a companion, Allègre. And then\r\ncomes the famous escape. One hardly knows which to wonder at the most:\r\nthe ingenuity of the two rogues, or the guileless management of this\r\nprison which allows them to collect undisturbed a gimlet, a saw, a\r\ncompass, a pulley, fourteen hundred feet of rope, a rope ladder 180 feet\r\nlong, with 218 wooden rungs; to conceal all these between the floor and\r\nthe ceiling below, without anyone ever thinking to look there; and,\r\nafter having cut through a wall four and a half feet thick, to get clear\r\naway without firing a shot!\r\n\r\nThey were not the first to get across those old walls. Renneville\r\nmentions several escapes, the most famous being that of the Abbé de\r\nBuquoy.[11] But little importance seems to have been attached to them.\r\n\r\nWith Allègre and Latude it was a different matter. The passers-by must\r\nhave seen, in the early morning, the ladder swinging from top to bottom\r\nof the wall, and the escape was no longer a secret. The Bastille is\r\ndiscredited. It is possible, then, to escape from it. The chagrined\r\npolice are on their mettle. There will be laughter at their expense. The\r\nfugitives are both well known, too. They will take good care to spread\r\nthe story of their escape, with plenty of gibes against the governor,\r\nthe lieutenant of police, the ministry, the favourite, the king! This\r\nscandal must be averted at any cost; the fugitives must be caught!\r\n\r\nAnd we cannot help pitying these two wretches who, after a flight so\r\nadmirably contrived, got arrested so stupidly: Allègre at Brussels,\r\nthrough an abusive letter written to the Pompadour; Latude in Holland,\r\nthrough a letter begging help from his mother.\r\n\r\nLatude is again under lock and key, and this time condemned to a\r\nstricter confinement. And then the hubbub begins again: outcries,\r\ndemands, acts of violence, threats! He exasperates and daunts men who\r\nhad the best will in the world to help him. He is despatched to the\r\nfortress of Vincennes, and promised his liberty if he will only keep\r\nquiet. His liberation, on his own showing, was but a matter of days. He\r\nis allowed to walk on the bank of the moat. He takes advantage of it to\r\nescape again!\r\n\r\nCaptured once more, he is once more lodged at Vincennes, and the whole\r\nbusiness begins over again. But they are good enough to consider him a\r\nlittle mad, and after a stay at Charenton,[12] where he was very well\r\ntreated, he at last gets his dismissal, with the recommendation to\r\nbetake himself to his own part of the country quietly. Ah, that would\r\nnot be like Latude! He scampers over Paris, railing against De Sartine,\r\nDe Marigny; hawking his pamphlets; claiming 150,000 livres as\r\ndamages!--and, finally, extorting money from a charitable lady by\r\nmenaces!\r\n\r\nThis is the last straw. Patience is exhausted, and he is clapped into\r\nBicêtre[13] as a dangerous lunatic. Imagine his fury and disgust!\r\n\r\nLet us be just. Suppose, in our own days, a swindler, sentenced to a few\r\nmonths' imprisonment, insulting the police, the magistrates, the court,\r\nthe president; sentenced on this account to a longer term, escaping\r\nonce, twice, a third time; always caught, put in jail again, sentenced\r\nto still longer terms: then when at last released, after having done his\r\ntime, scattering broadcast insulting libels against the chief of police,\r\nthe ministers, the parliament, and insisting on the President of the\r\nRepublic paying him damages to the tune of 150,000 francs; to crown it\r\nall, getting money out of some good woman by working on her fears! You\r\nwill agree with me that such a swaggering blade would not have much\r\ndifficulty in putting together thirty-five years in jail!\r\n\r\nBut these sentences would of course be public, and provide no soil for\r\nthe growth of those legends to which closed doors always give rise. Yet\r\nin all that relates to the causes and the duration of the man's\r\nimprisonment, his case would be precisely that of Latude--except that\r\nfor him there would be no furs, no promenading in the gardens, no\r\nstuffed fowls for his lunch!\r\n\r\nBesides some fifty autograph letters from Latude, addressed from Bicêtre\r\nto his good angel, Madame Legros, in which he shows himself in his true\r\ncharacter, an intriguing, vain, insolent, bragging, insupportable\r\nhumbug, I have one, written to M. de Sartine, which Latude published as\r\na pendant to the pamphlet with which he hoped to move Madame de\r\nPompadour to pity, and in which every phrase is an insult. This letter\r\nwas put up at public auction, and these first lines of it were\r\nreproduced in the catalogue:--\r\n\r\n\"I am supporting with patience the loss of my best years and of my\r\nfortune. I am enduring my rheumatism, the weakness of my arm, and a ring\r\nof iron around my body for the rest of my life!\"\r\n\r\nA journalist, one of those who learn their history from Louis Blanc, had\r\na vision of Latude for ever riveted by a ring of iron to a pillar in\r\nsome underground dungeon, and exclaimed with indignation: \"A ring of\r\niron! How horrible!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was only a linen band!\r\n\r\nThat fabulous iron collar is a type of the whole legend of the\r\nunfortunate Latude!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverything connected with the Bastille has assumed a fabulous character.\r\n\r\nWhat glorious days were those of the 13th and 14th of July, as the\r\npopular imagination conjures them up in reliance on Michelet, who, in a\r\nvivid, impassioned, picturesque, dramatic, admirable style, has\r\nwritten, not the history, but the romance of the French Revolution!\r\n\r\nLook at his account of the 13th. He shows you all Paris in revolt\r\nagainst Versailles, and with superb enthusiasm running to arms to try\r\nissues with the royal army. It is fine as literature. Historically, it\r\nis pure fiction.\r\n\r\nThe Parisians were assuredly devoted to the \"new ideas,\" that is, the\r\nsuppression of the abuses and the privileges specified in the memorials\r\nof the States General; in a word, to the reforms longed for by the whole\r\nof France. But they had no conception of gaining them without the\r\nconcurrence of the monarchy, to which they were sincerely attached. That\r\ncrowd of scared men running to the Hôtel de Ville to demand arms, who\r\nare represented by the revolutionary writers as exasperated by the\r\ndismissal of Necker and ready to undermine the throne for the sake of\r\nthat Genevan, were much less alarmed at what was hatching at Versailles\r\nthan at what was going on in Paris. If they wished for arms, it was for\r\ntheir own security. The dissolution of the National Assembly, which was\r\nregarded as certain, was setting all minds in a ferment, and\r\nill-designing people took advantage of the general uneasiness and\r\nagitation to drive matters to the worst extremities, creating disorder\r\neverywhere. The police had disappeared; the streets were in the hands of\r\nthe mob. Bands of ruffians--among them those ill-favoured rascals who\r\nsince the month of May had been flocking, as at a word of command, into\r\nParis from heaven knows where, and who had already been seen at work,\r\npillaging Réveillon's[14] establishment--roamed in every direction,\r\ninsulting women, stripping wayfarers, looting the shops, opening the\r\nprisons, burning the barriers. On July 13 the electors of Paris resolved\r\non the formation of a citizen militia for the protection of the town,\r\nand the scheme was adopted on the same day by every district, with\r\narticles of constitution, quoted by M. Funck-Brentano, which specify the\r\nintentions of the signatories. It was expressly in self-defence against\r\nthe \"Brigands,\" as they were called, that the citizen militia was\r\nformed: \"To protect the citizens,\" ran the minutes of the\r\nPetit-Saint-Antoine district, \"against the dangers which threaten them\r\neach individually.\" \"In a word,\" says M. Victor Fournel, \"the\r\ndominating sentiment was fear. Up till the 14th of July, the Parisian\r\nmiddle-classes showed far more concern at the manifold excesses\r\ncommitted by the populace after Necker's dismissal than at the schemes\r\nof the court.\" And M. Jacques Charavay, who was the first to publish the\r\ntext of the minutes in question, says not a word too much when he draws\r\nfrom them this conclusion: \"The movement which next day swept away the\r\nBastille might possibly have been stifled by the National Guard, if its\r\norganization had had greater stability.\"\r\n\r\nAll that was wanting to these good intentions was direction, a man at\r\nthe helm, and particularly the support of Besenval. But his conduct was\r\namazing! He left Versailles with 35,000 men and an order signed by the\r\nking--obtained not without difficulty--authorizing him \"to repel force\r\nby force.\" Now let us see a summary of his military operations:--\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, a skirmish of the\r\nGerman regiment on the Place Vendôme, where it came into collision with\r\nthe \"demonstration\"--as we should say to-day--which was displaying busts\r\nof Necker and the Duke of Orleans, and dispersed it.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock, a march of the same horse soldiers to the\r\nswinging-bridge of the Tuileries, where they had five or six chairs\r\nthrown at their head; and the massacre, by M. de Lambesc, of the\r\nlegendary grey-beard who, an hour after, was describing his tragic end\r\nat the Palais-Royal!\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock, a military promenade of the same regiment along the\r\nboulevards. A volley from the Gardes Françaises slew two of their\r\nnumber, and the regiment beat a retreat without returning fire, to the\r\ngreat surprise of M. de Maleissye, officer of the Guards. For, by his\r\nown confession, if the cavalry had charged, it would easily have routed\r\nthe Gardes Françaises \"in the state of drunkenness in which they then\r\nwere.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Besenval, terrified at such a resistance, assembled all his troops,\r\nshut himself up with them in the Champ de Mars, and did not move another\r\nstep!\r\n\r\nWe ask ourselves, \"Was he a fool? or was he a traitor?\" He was a fool,\r\nfor he thought he had \"three hundred thousand men\" in front of him, took\r\nevery excited person for a rebel, and did not understand that out of\r\nevery hundred Parisians there were ninety who were relying on him to\r\nbring the mutineers to reason.\r\n\r\nHe had no confidence in his troops, he said.\r\n\r\nIt was rather for them to have no confidence in him, and to lose heart\r\nutterly at such a spectacle of cowardice. But he was slandering them.\r\nOne solitary regiment showed disloyalty. And if he had only given the\r\nSwiss the word to march, their conduct on August 10 gives ample proof\r\nthat they could have been depended on.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" says he again, \"I was fearful of letting loose civil war!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed! And so a soldier going to suppress a revolt is not to run the\r\nrisk of fighting!\r\n\r\nLast reason of all: \"I requested orders from Versailles--and did not get\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had he in his pocket?\r\n\r\nFinally, after having sent word to Flesselles and De Launey to maintain\r\ntheir position till he arrived, and after having allowed the arms of the\r\nInvalides to be looted under his eyes without a single effort to save\r\nthem, he waited till the Bastille was taken before making up his mind to\r\nleave the Champ de Mars, and to return quietly to Versailles with his\r\n35,000 men, who had not fired a shot!\r\n\r\nAh! those were the days for rioting!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"On July 13,\" says Michelet, \"Paris was defending herself.\" (Against\r\nwhom?) \"On the 14th, she attacked! A voice wakened her and cried, 'On,\r\nand take the Bastille!' And that day was the day of the entire People!\"\r\n\r\nAdmirable poetry; but every word a lie!\r\n\r\nListen to Marat, who is not open to suspicion, and who saw things at\r\ncloser quarters. \"The Bastille, badly defended, was captured by a\r\nhandful of soldiers and a gang of wretches for the most part Germans and\r\nprovincials. The Parisians, those everlasting star-gazers, came there\r\nout of curiosity!\"\r\n\r\nIn reality, Michelet's \"entire people\" reduces itself to a bare thousand\r\nassailants, of whom three hundred at most took part in the fight: Gardes\r\nFrançaises and deserters of all arms, lawyers' clerks, and citizens who\r\nhad lost their heads: fine fellows who thought themselves engaged in\r\nmeritorious work in rushing on these inoffensive walls; bandits\r\nattracted by the riot which promised them theft and murder with\r\nimpunity. And a number of mere spectators--spectators above all!\r\n\r\n\"I was present,\" says Chancellor Pasquier, \"at the taking of the\r\nBastille. What is called the fight was not serious. The resistance was\r\nabsolutely nil. The truth is, that this grand fight did not cause an\r\ninstant's alarm to the spectators, who had flocked up to see the result.\r\nAmong them there were many ladies of the greatest elegance. In order to\r\nget more easily to the front they had left their carriages at a\r\ndistance. By my side was Mdlle. Contat, of the Comédie Française. We\r\nstayed to see the finish, and then I escorted her on my arm to her\r\ncarriage in the Place Royale.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bastille was not taken; truth must be told, it surrendered.\" It is\r\nMichelet himself who makes this statement, and he adds: \"what ruined it\r\nwas its own evil conscience!\"\r\n\r\nIt would be too simple to acknowledge that it was the incapacity of its\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nThere is no connoisseur in old prints but is acquainted with those\r\nlast-century views which represent the taking of the Bastille. The\r\nplatform of the fortress bristles with cannon all firing together,\r\n\"belching forth death,\"--without the slightest attention on the part of\r\nthe assailants, for all the balls from this artillery, passing over\r\ntheir heads, would only kill inoffensive wayfarers without so much as\r\nscratching a single one of the besiegers!\r\n\r\nAnd the Bastille did not fire a single shot in self-defence!\r\n\r\nIn the morning, at the request of Thuriot de la Rozière, De Launey had\r\nreadily consented to the withdrawal of the fifteen cannon of the\r\nplatform from their embrasures, and had blocked up the embrasures with\r\nplanks. Of the three guns which later on he ranged batterywise before\r\nthe entrance gate, not one was effective, and the discharge attributed\r\nto one of them came from a piece of ordnance on the wall.\r\n\r\nHe placed such absolute reliance on succour from Besenval that, on\r\nevacuating the arsenal and getting the whole garrison together into the\r\nBastille--eighty-two Invalides and M. de Flue's thirty-two Swiss--he had\r\nforgotten to increase his stock of provisions. Now, the Bastille had no\r\nreserve of provisions. Every morning, like a good housewife, it received\r\nthe goods ordered the night before, brought by the different purveyors;\r\non this day, they were intercepted. So it happened that at three o'clock\r\nin the afternoon the garrison was without its usual rations, and the\r\nInvalides, who had been for a week past going in and out of all the inns\r\nin the neighbourhood, and were disposed to open the doors to their good\r\nfriends of the suburbs, used the scantiness of their rations as a\r\npretext for mutiny, for refusing to fight, and for muddling the brains,\r\nnever very clear, of the unhappy De Launey.\r\n\r\n\"On the day of my arrival,\" says De Flue, \"I was able to take this man's\r\nmeasure from the absolutely imbecile preparations which he made for the\r\ndefence of his position. I saw clearly that we should be very poorly led\r\nin case of attack. He was so struck with terror at the idea of it that,\r\nwhen night came on, he took the shadows of trees for enemies! Incapable,\r\nirresolute, devoting all his attention to trifles and neglecting\r\nimportant duties--such was the man.\"\r\n\r\nAbandoned by Besenval, instead of cowing his Invalides into obedience by\r\nhis energy, and maintaining his position to famishing point behind walls\r\nover which the balls of the besiegers flew without killing more than\r\none man, De Launey lost his head, made a feint of firing the powder\r\nmagazine, capitulated, and opened his gates to men who, as Chateaubriand\r\nsays, \"could never have cleared them if he had only kept them shut.\"\r\n\r\nIf this poor creature had done his duty, and Besenval had done his,\r\nthings would have had quite a different complexion. That is not to say\r\nthat the Revolution would have been averted--far from it! The Revolution\r\nwas legitimate, desirable, and, under the generous impulse of a whole\r\nnation, irresistible. But it would have followed another bent, and would\r\nhave triumphed at a slighter cost, with less ruin and less bloodshed.\r\nThe consequences of the 14th of July were disastrous. The mere words,\r\n\"The Bastille is taken!\" were the signal for the most frightful\r\ndisorders throughout France. It seemed as though those old walls were\r\ndragging down with them in their fall all authority, all respect, all\r\ndiscipline; as though the floodgates were being opened to every kind of\r\nexcess. Peasants went about in bands, ravaging, pillaging, firing the\r\nchâteaux, the burghers' houses, and burning alive those who fell into\r\ntheir hands. The soldiers mutinied, insulted their chiefs, and fell to\r\ncarousing with the malefactors whom they set free. There was not a town\r\nor village where the mob did not put on menacing airs, where decent\r\npeople were not molested by the brawlers of the clubs and the\r\nstreet-corners. Such violence led to a rapid reaction, and there were\r\nnumerous defections--of men who, on the very eve of the outbreak, among\r\nthe magistracy, the army, the clergy, the nobility, though sympathizing\r\nwith the new ideas, abruptly cut themselves loose from the movement,\r\nlike the good Duke de la Rochefoucauld, who exclaimed, \"Liberty is not\r\nentered by such a door as this!\" Hovering between the desire and the\r\nfear of granting the promised reforms, urged on one side to resistance,\r\non the other to submission, and more than ever destitute of all\r\npolitical acumen and all will power, the king went to Paris, and,\r\nbending before the revolt, approved of the assassination of his most\r\nfaithful servants--and took, on that fatal day, his first step towards\r\nthe scaffold! Henceforth, under the pressure of the populace, to whom\r\nits first success had shown the measure of its strength, and who became\r\nevery day more exacting, more threatening, the Revolution was to go on\r\nin its perverse course, stumbling at every step, until it came to the\r\norgy of '93, which, properly speaking, was only the systematizing of\r\nbrigandage. Malouet was right indeed: what we symbolize in our festival\r\nof the 14th of July is not the rising sun, the dawn of Liberty; it is\r\nthe first lurid lightning flash of the Terror!\r\n\r\nDoctor Rigby, after having walked up and down the whole afternoon in the\r\nJardin Monceau without the least idea of what was going on in the Suburb\r\nSaint-Antoine, returned in the evening to his house near the\r\nPalais-Royal. He saw the mob reeling in drunkenness. Men and women were\r\nlaughing, crying, and embracing one another: \"The Bastille is taken! At\r\nlast we are free!\" And not the least enthusiastic were those very men of\r\nthe citizen militia who, ready yesterday to fight the insurrection, were\r\nto-day hailing its triumph! The first sabre brandished by the first\r\nnational guard was in point of fact that of Joseph Prudhomme![15]\r\n\r\nAll at once this delirious crowd shudders, parts asunder with cries of\r\nhorror!\r\n\r\nDown the Rue Saint-Honoré comes a yelling mob of wine-soaked\r\nmalefactors, bearing along, at the ends of two pikes, the still bleeding\r\nheads of De Launey and De Flesselles!\r\n\r\nAnd the silly folk, so madly rejoiced by the fall of an imaginary\r\ntyranny which has not even the wits to defend itself, go their several\r\nways, struck dumb with consternation.\r\n\r\nFor here the Real is making its entrance!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDo not fancy that because the Bastille has opened its gates, the legends\r\nwhich give it so cruel a name are going to vanish into thin air, like\r\nthe phantoms of an ancient château when light is let in.\r\n\r\nWhile Michelet's \"entire Paris\" is making short work of the Invalides\r\nwho surrendered the place; cutting in pieces the man who prevented its\r\nblowing up; slaughtering Major de Losme, the friend and benefactor of\r\nthe prisoners; torturing the hapless De Launey, who, from the Bastille\r\nto the Hôtel de Ville, stabbed, slashed, hacked with sabres and pikes\r\nand bayonets, is finally decapitated by the aid of a short knife--an\r\nepisode which Michelet skilfully slurs over--while all the criminals of\r\nthe district, crowding along in the wake of the combatants, are rushing\r\nto the official buildings, looting, smashing, throwing into the moats\r\nfurniture, books, official papers, archives, the remnants of which will\r\nbe collected with such difficulty--some good people are saying to\r\nthemselves: \"But come now, there are some prisoners! Suppose we go and\r\nset them free?\"\r\n\r\nHere let us see what Louis Blanc has to say:--\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the doors of the cells\" (he insists on the cells) \"were burst\r\nin with a mighty effort; the prisoners were free! Alas! for three of\r\nthem it was too late! The first, whose name was the Comte de Solages, a\r\nvictim for seven years of the incomprehensible vengeance of an\r\nimplacable father, found neither relatives who would consent to\r\nacknowledge him, nor his property, which had become the prey of covetous\r\ncollateral heirs! The second was called Whyte. Of what crime was he\r\nguilty, accused, of, at any rate, suspected? No one has ever known! The\r\nman himself was questioned in vain. In the Bastille he had lost his\r\nreason. The third, Tavernier, at the sight of his deliverers, fancied he\r\nsaw his executioners coming, and put himself on the defensive. Throwing\r\ntheir arms round his neck they undeceived him; but next day he was met\r\nroaming through the town, muttering wild and whirling words. He was\r\nmad!\"\r\n\r\nAs many wilful errors as there are words!\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Solages was an execrable libertine, confined at the request\r\nof his family for \"atrocious and notorious crimes.\" His relatives\r\nnevertheless had the humanity to take him in after his deliverance, and\r\nit was with them that he died in 1825.\r\n\r\nWhyte and Tavernier did not go mad in the Bastille. They were in the\r\nBastille because they were mad; and the second was, further, implicated\r\nin an assassination. Finding shelter with a perruquier of the\r\nneighbourhood, he set about smashing all his host's belongings, which\r\nnecessitated his banishment to Charenton, where Whyte soon rejoined him.\r\nIt was not worth the trouble of changing their quarters!\r\n\r\nFour other prisoners who were set free, Corrège, Béchade, Pujade, and\r\nLaroche, were imprisoned for forgery. And so Louis Blanc is careful\r\nsilently to pass them over!\r\n\r\nTen days before, another victim of tyranny had been groaning in\r\nirons--the Marquis de Sade, who, from the height of the platform, used\r\nto provoke the passers-by with the aid of a speaking trumpet. De Launey\r\nwas compelled to transfer him to Vincennes, thus depriving the victors\r\nof the glory of liberating the future author of _Justine_. The Republic\r\ntook its revenge in making him later secretary of the \"Pike\" ward,[16]\r\nan office for which he was marked out by his virtues!\r\n\r\nBut of all these prisoners the most celebrated, the most popular, the\r\nman whose misfortunes all Paris deplored, was the famous Comte de\r\nLorges, who, according to the biographical sketch devoted to him by the\r\nunknown author of his deliverance, had been shut up for thirty-two\r\nyears. The story must be read in the pamphlet of Citizen Rousselet,\r\nconqueror of the Bastille: \"The tide of humanity penetrates into ways\r\nnarrowed by mistrust. An iron door opens: what does one see? Is this a\r\nman? Good heavens! this old man loaded with irons! the splendour of his\r\nbrow, the whiteness of his beard hanging over his breast! What majesty!\r\nthe fire still flashing from his eyes seems to shed a gentle light in\r\nthis lugubrious abode!\"\r\n\r\nSurprised at seeing so many armed men, he asks them if Louis XV. is\r\nstill alive. They set him free, they lead him to the Hôtel de Ville.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen days all Paris went to visit the black dungeon in which this\r\nunhappy wretch had been shut up for so many years without other light\r\nthan that which escaped \"from his eyes\"! A stone from that dungeon had a\r\nplace in the Curtius Museum. His portrait was published. A print\r\nrepresents him at the moment when his chains were broken, seated on a\r\nchair in his cell, a pitcher of water by his side!\r\n\r\nAnd this hapless greybeard--he was never seen! He never existed!\r\n\r\nIn reality there were in the Bastille, on the 14th of July, only seven\r\nprisoners--two madmen, a _Sadique_,[17] and four forgers. But about\r\ntheir number and their right to imprisonment Michelet remains dumb: to\r\ndiscuss that would spoil his epic! And he excels in making the most of\r\neverything that can support his case, and in ignoring everything that\r\ndamages it. And so he contents himself with speaking of the two who had\r\n\"gone mad\"!--a prevarication worthy of Louis Blanc, nay, unworthy even\r\nof him!\r\n\r\nThe conquerors were somewhat surprised at the small number of victims,\r\nmore surprised still to find them comfortably installed in rooms, some\r\nof which were furnished with arm-chairs in Utrecht velvet! The author of\r\n_The Bastille Unmasked_ exclaims: \"What! No corpses! No skeletons! No\r\nmen in chains!\" \"The taking of the Bastille,\" said \"Cousin Jacques,\"[18]\r\n\"has opened the eyes of the public on the kind of captivity experienced\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nBut in this he was greatly mistaken. Legends die hard! A Bastille\r\nwithout cells, dungeons, cages of iron! Public opinion did not admit\r\nthat it could have been deceived on that point.\r\n\r\n\"Several prisoners,\" says the _History of Remarkable Events_, \"were set\r\nat liberty; but some, and perhaps the greater number, had already died\r\nof hunger, because men could not find their way about this monstrous\r\nprison. Some of these prisoners confined within four walls received food\r\nonly through holes cut in the wall. A party of prisoners was found\r\nstarved to death, because their cells were not discovered till several\r\ndays had elapsed!\"\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet on the underground cells discovered in the Bastille,\r\nresuscitating an old fable which had already done duty for the Cardinal\r\nde Richelieu, shows us a prisoner taken from his cell and led by the\r\ngovernor into \"a room which had nothing sinister in its appearance. It\r\nwas lit by more than fifty candles. Sweet-scented flowers filled it with\r\na delicious perfume. The tyrant chatted amicably with his prisoner....\r\nThen he gave the horrible signal: a bascule let into the floor opened,\r\nand the wretched man disappeared, falling upon a wheel stuck with razors\r\nand set in motion by invisible hands.\" And the author winds up with this\r\nmagnificent reflection:--\"Such a punishment, so basely contrived, is not\r\neven credible--and yet it was at Paris, in that beautiful and\r\nflourishing city, that this took place!\"\r\n\r\nDorat-Cubières, who was one of the literary disgraces of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, goes further! He saw, with his own eyes, one of those dens\r\nwhere the captive, shut up with enough bread to last him a week, had\r\nthereafter nothing else to subsist on but his own flesh. \"In this den,\"\r\nhe says, \"we came upon a horrible skeleton, the sight of which made me\r\nshrink back with horror!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the popular picture-mongers did not fail to propagate these\r\ninsanities. I have an engraving of the time nicely calculated to stir\r\nsensitive hearts. Upon the steps of a gloomy cellar the conquerors are\r\ndragging along a man whom his uniform shows to be one of the defenders\r\nof the Bastille, and are pointing out to him an old man being carried\r\naway, another being cut down from the ceiling where he is hanging by the\r\narms; yet others lying on a wheel furnished with iron teeth, chained to\r\nit, twisted into horrible contortions by abominable machines; and in a\r\nrecess behind a grating appears the skeleton--which Dorat-Cubières never\r\nsaw!\r\n\r\nThe non-existence of these dungeons and holes with skeletons was too\r\ngreat a shock to settled beliefs. This Bastille _must_ contain concealed\r\nbelow ground some unknown cells where its victims were moaning! And\r\nnaturally enough, when one bent down the ear, one heard their despairing\r\nappeals! But after having pierced through vaults, sunk pits, dug,\r\nsounded everywhere, there was no help for it but to give up these\r\nfancies, though--an agreeable thing to have to say!--with regret.\r\n\r\nThey fell back then on instruments of torture. For though the rack had\r\nbeen abolished for a hundred years, how was it possible to conceive of\r\nthe Bastille without some slight instruments of torture?\r\n\r\nThey had no difficulty in finding them--\"chains,\" says Louis Blanc,\r\n\"which the hands of many innocent men had perhaps worn, machines of\r\nwhich no one could guess the use: an old iron corslet which seemed to\r\nhave been invented to reduce man to everlasting immobility!\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, these chains belonged to two statuettes of\r\nprisoners which stood on either side of the great clock in the\r\ncourtyard. The machines, the use of which no one could guess, were the\r\nfragments of a clandestine printing-press that had been pulled to\r\npieces. And the iron corslet was a piece of fifteenth-century armour!\r\n\r\nSkeletons, too, were missing, though indeed some bones were found in the\r\napartment of the surgeon of the fortress; but the utmost bad faith could\r\nnot but be compelled to acknowledge that these were anatomical\r\nspecimens. Happily for the legend, a more serious discovery was made:\r\n\"two skeletons, chained to a cannon-ball,\" as the register of the\r\ndistrict of Saint-Louis la Culture declared.\r\n\r\nThey both came to light in the rubbish dug out during the construction\r\nof the bastion afterwards turned into a garden for the governor. \"One,\"\r\nsays the report of Fourcroy, Vicq-d'Azyr, and Sabatier, instructed to\r\nexamine them, \"was found turned head downwards on the steps of a steep\r\nstaircase, entirely covered with earth, and appears to be that of a\r\nworkman who had fallen by accident down this dark staircase, where he\r\nwas not seen by the men working at the embankment. The other, carefully\r\nburied in a sort of ditch, had evidently been laid there a long time\r\npreviously, before there was any idea of filling up the bastion.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the cannon-ball, it must have dated back to the Fronde.[19]\r\n\r\nBut skeletons were necessary! They had found some: they might as well\r\nprofit by them!\r\n\r\nThe demolisher of the Bastille, that charlatan Palloy, exhibited them to\r\nthe veneration of the faithful in a cellar by the light of a funereal\r\nlamp, after which they were honoured with a magnificent funeral, with\r\ndrums, clergy, a procession of working men, between two lines of\r\nNational Guards, from the Bastille to the Church of St. Paul. And\r\nfinally, in the graveyard adjoining the church, they raised to them,\r\namid four poplars, a monument of which a contemporary print has\r\npreserved the likeness.\r\n\r\nAfter such a ceremony, dispute if you dare the authenticity of the\r\nrelics!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe memory of the Man in the Iron Mask is so closely bound up with the\r\nstory of the Bastille that M. Funck-Brentano could not neglect this\r\ngreat enigma about which for two hundred years so much ink has been\r\nspilt. He strips off this famous mask--which, by the way, was of\r\nvelvet--and shows us the face which the world has been so anxious to\r\nsee: the face of Mattioli, the confidant of the Duke of Mantua and the\r\nbetrayer of both Louis XIV. and his own master.\r\n\r\nM. Funck-Brentano's demonstration is so convincing as to leave no room\r\nfor doubt. But one dare not hope that the good public will accept his\r\nconclusions as final. To the public, mystery is ever more attractive\r\nthan the truth. There is a want of prestige about Mattioli; while about\r\na twin brother of Louis XIV.--ah, _there_ is something that appeals to\r\nthe imagination!\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the guides, the showmen, to reckon with--those\r\nfaithful guardians of legends, whose propaganda is more aggressive than\r\nthat of scholars. When you reflect that every day, at the Isles of\r\nSaint-Marguerite, the masked man's cell is shown to visitors by a good\r\nwoman who retails all the traditional fables about the luxurious life of\r\nthe prisoner, his lace, his plate, and the attentions shown him by M.\r\nde Saint-Mars, you will agree that a struggle with this daily discourse\r\nwould be hopeless. And you would not come off with a whole skin!\r\n\r\nI was visiting the Château d'If before the new buildings were erected.\r\nThe show-woman of the place, another worthy dame, pointed out to us the\r\nruined cells of the Abbé Faria and Edmond Dantès.[20] And the spectators\r\nwere musing on the story as they contemplated the ruins.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" I said, \"that these cells are rather near one another,\r\nbut surely Alexandre Dumas put them a little farther apart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well!\" replied the good creature, withering me with a glance of\r\ncontempt, \"if, when I'm relating gospel truth, the gentleman begins\r\nquoting a novelist--!\"\r\n\r\nTo come nearer home. Follow, one of these days, a batch of Cook's\r\ntourists at Versailles, shown round by an English cicerone. You will see\r\nhim point out the window from which Louis XVI. issued, on a flying\r\nbridge, to reach his scaffold, erected in the marble court! The guide is\r\nno fool. He knows well enough that the Place de la Concorde would not\r\nappeal to the imagination of his countrymen; while it is quite natural\r\nto them to draw a parallel in their minds between the scaffold of Louis\r\nXVI. at Versailles and that of Charles I. at Whitehall.\r\n\r\nAnd the conclusion of the whole matter is this: that whatever may be\r\nsaid or written, nothing will prevail against the popular beliefs that\r\nthe Bastille was \"the hell of living men,\" and that it was taken by\r\nstorm. Legends are the history of the people, especially those which\r\nflatter their instincts, prejudices, and passions. You will never\r\nconvince them of their falsity.\r\n\r\nM. Funck-Brentano must also expect to be treated as a \"reactionary,\" for\r\nsuch is, to many people, any one who does not unreservedly decry the\r\n_ancien régime_. It had, assuredly, its vices and abuses, which the\r\nRevolution swept away--to replace them by others, much more tolerable,\r\nto be sure; but that is no reason for slandering the past and painting\r\nit blacker than it really was. The fanatical supporters of the\r\nRevolution have founded in its honour a sort of cult whose intolerance\r\nis often irritating. To hear them you would fancy that before its birth\r\nthere was nothing but darkness, ignorance, iniquity, and wretchedness!\r\nAnd so we are to give it wholehearted admiration, and palliate its\r\nerrors and its crimes; even gilding, as Chateaubriand said, the iron of\r\nits guillotine. These idolaters of the Revolution are very injudicious.\r\nBy endeavouring to compel admiration for all that it effected, good and\r\nill without distinction, they provoke the very unreasonable inclination\r\nto regard its whole achievement with abhorrence. It could well dispense\r\nwith such a surplusage of zeal, for it is strong enough to bear the\r\ntruth; and its work, after all, is great enough to need no justification\r\nor glorification by means of legends.\r\n\r\nVICTORIEN SARDOU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGENDS OF THE BASTILLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Bastille,\" wrote Sainte-Foix, \"is a castle which, without being\r\nstrong, is one of the most formidable in Europe, and about it I shall\r\nsay nothing.\" \"Silence is safer than speech on that subject,\" was the\r\nsaying in Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the Rue Saint-Antoine, as one entered the suburb,\r\nappeared the eight lofty towers, sombre, massive, plunging their\r\nmoss-grown feet into pools of muddy water. Their walls were pierced at\r\nintervals with narrow, iron-barred windows: they were crowned with\r\nbattlements. Situated not far from the Marais, the blithe and wealthy\r\nquarter, and quite near to the Suburb Saint-Antoine, where industry\r\nraised its perpetual hum, the Bastille, charged with gloom and silence,\r\nformed an impressive contrast.\r\n\r\nThe common impression it made is conveyed by Restif de la Bretonne in\r\nhis _Nights of Paris_: \"It was a nightmare, that awesome Bastille, on\r\nwhich, as I passed each evening along the Rue Saint-Gilles, I never\r\ndared to turn my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe towers had an air of mystery, harsh and melancholy, and the royal\r\ngovernment threw mystery like a cloud around them. At nightfall, when\r\nthe shutters were closed, a cab would cross the drawbridge, and from\r\ntime to time, in the blackness of night, funeral processions, vague\r\nshadows which the light of a torch set flickering on the walls, would\r\nmake their silent exit. How many of those who had entered there had ever\r\nbeen seen again? And if perchance one met a former prisoner, to the\r\nfirst question he would reply that on leaving he had signed a promise to\r\nreveal nothing of what he had seen. This former prisoner had, as a\r\nmatter of fact, never seen anything to speak of. Absolute silence was\r\nimposed upon the warders. \"There is no exchanging of confidences in this\r\nplace,\" writes Madame de Staal, \"and the people you come across have all\r\nsuch freezing physiognomies that you would think twice before asking the\r\nmost trifling question.\" \"The first article of their code,\" says\r\nLinguet, \"is the impenetrable mystery which envelops all their\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\nWe know how legends are formed. Sometimes you see them open out like\r\nflowers brilliant under the sun's bright beams, you see them blossom\r\nunder the glorious radiance that lights up the life of heroes. The man\r\nhimself has long gone down into the tomb; the legend survives; it\r\nstreams across the ages, like a meteor leaving its trail of light; it\r\ngrows, broadens out, with ever-increasing lustre and glow: in this light\r\nwe see Themistocles, Leonidas, Alexander, Cæsar, Charlemagne, Napoleon.\r\n\r\nOr may be, on the contrary, the legend is born in some remote corner,\r\ncovered with shade and silence. There men have lived their lives, there\r\nit has been their lot to suffer. Their moans have risen in solitude and\r\nconfinement, and the only ears that heard them were harder than their\r\nstone walls. These moans, heard by no compassionate soul, the great\r\nresounding soul of the people catches up, swelling them with all its\r\nmight. Soon, among the mass of the people, there passes a blast\r\nirresistible in its strength, like the tempest that upheaves the\r\nrestless waves. Then is the sea loosed from its chains: the tumultuous\r\nbreakers dash upon the affrighted shore: the sea-walls are all swept\r\naway!\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by Chevalier, the major of the Bastille, to Sartine,\r\nthe chief of the police, he spoke of the common gossip on the Bastille\r\nthat was going about. \"Although utterly false,\" he said, \"I think it\r\nvery dangerous on account of its dissemination through the kingdom, and\r\nthat has now been going on for several years.\" No attention was paid to\r\nChevalier's warning. Mystery continued to be the rule at the Bastille\r\nand in all that related to it. \"The mildness of manners and of the\r\ngovernment,\" writes La Harpe, \"had caused needlessly harsh measures in\r\ngreat part to disappear. They lived on in the imagination of the\r\npeople, augmented and strengthened by the tales which credulity and hate\r\nseize upon.\" Ere long the _Memoirs_ of Latude and of Linguet appeared.\r\nLatude concealed his grievous faults, to paint his long sufferings in\r\nstrokes of fire. Linguet, with his rare literary talent, made of the\r\nBastille a picture dark in the extreme, compressing the gist of his\r\npamphlet into the sentence: \"Except perhaps in hell, there are no\r\ntortures to approach those of the Bastille.\" At the same period, the\r\ngreat Mirabeau was launching his powerful plea against _lettres de\r\ncachet_, \"arbitrary orders.\" These books produced a mighty\r\nreverberation. The Revolution broke out like a clap of thunder. The\r\nBastille was disembowelled. The frowning towers crumbled stone by stone\r\nunder the picks of the demolishers, and, as if they had been the\r\npedestal of the _ancien régime_, that too toppled over with a crash.\r\n\r\nOne of the halls of the Bastille contained, in boxes carefully arranged,\r\nthe entire history of the celebrated fortress from the year 1659, at\r\nwhich date the foundation of this precious store of archives had been\r\nbegun. There were collected the documents concerning, not only the\r\nprisoners of the Bastille, but all the persons who had been lodged\r\nthere, either under sentence of exile, or simply arrested within the\r\nlimits of the generality of Paris in virtue of a _lettre de cachet_.\r\n\r\nThe documents in this store-room had been in charge of archivists, who\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century had laboured with zeal and\r\nintelligence at putting in order papers which, on the eve of the\r\nRevolution, were counted by hundreds of thousands. The whole mass was\r\nnow in perfect order, classified and docketed. The major of the château,\r\nChevalier, had even been commissioned to make these documents the basis\r\nof a history of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Bastille was taken. In the disorder, what was the fate of the\r\narchives? The ransacking of the papers continued for two days, writes\r\nDusaulx, one of the commissioners elected by the Assembly for the\r\npreservation of the archives of the Bastille. \"When, on Thursday the\r\n16th, my colleagues and myself went down into the sort of cellar where\r\nthe archives were, we found the boxes in very orderly arrangement on the\r\nshelves, but they were already empty. The most important documents had\r\nbeen carried off: the rest were strewn on the floor, scattered about the\r\ncourtyard, and even in the moats. However, the curious still found some\r\ngleanings there.\" The testimony of Dusaulx is only too well confirmed.\r\n\"I went to see the siege of the Bastille,\" writes Restif de la Bretonne;\r\n\"when I arrived it was all over, the place was taken. Infuriated men\r\nwere throwing papers, documents of great historical value, from the top\r\nof the towers into the moats.\" Among these papers, some had been burnt,\r\nsome torn, registers had been torn to shreds and trailed in the mud. The\r\nmob had invaded the halls of the château: men of learning and mere\r\ncuriosity hunters strove eagerly to get possession of as many of these\r\ndocuments as possible, in which they thought they were sure to find\r\nstartling revelations. \"There is talk of the son of a celebrated\r\nmagistrate,\" writes Gabriel Brizard, \"who went off with his carriage\r\nfull of them.\" Villenave, then twenty-seven years of age and already a\r\ncollector, gathered a rich harvest for his study, and Beaumarchais, in\r\nthe course of a patriotic ramble through the interior of the captured\r\nfortress, was careful to get together a certain number of these papers.\r\n\r\nThe papers purloined from the archives on the day of the capture and the\r\nday following became dispersed throughout France and Europe. A large\r\npacket came into the hands of Pierre Lubrowski, an attaché in the\r\nRussian embassy. Sold in 1805, with his whole collection, to the Emperor\r\nAlexander, the papers were deposited in the Hermitage Palace. To-day\r\nthey are preserved in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the custody of the captured fortress was entrusted on July\r\n15 to the company of arquebusiers, which received orders to prevent the\r\nremoval of any more papers. On July 16 one of the members present at a\r\nsitting of the Electoral Assembly, sprang forward to the table and\r\ncried, \"Ah, gentlemen, let us save the papers! It is said that the\r\npapers of the Bastille are being plundered; let us hasten to collect the\r\nremnants of these old title-deeds of an intolerable despotism, so that\r\nwe may inspire our latest posterity with their horror!\" There was\r\nrapturous applause. A committee was nominated, consisting of Dusaulx, De\r\nChamseru, Gorneau, and Cailleau. Let us follow the style of the period:\r\n\"Before the Bastille the commissioners received a triumphant reception.\r\nAmid the cheers of the people, who had been informed of their mission,\r\nten distinguished men of letters besought them to lead the commissioners\r\ninto the heart of that famous fortress, so long detested.\" When they got\r\ninto the Bastille, the commissioners were not long in perceiving that\r\nthey were a little behind the fair: \"Many boxes were empty, and there\r\nwas an immense heap of papers in complete disorder.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the papers of the Bastille grew day by day\r\nextraordinarily popular. The Electoral Assembly had just appointed\r\ncommissioners to collect them; La Fayette, commander of the National\r\nGuards, imposed a similar duty on the St. Elizabeth district; Bailly,\r\nthe mayor of Paris, delegated Dusaulx to the same office. In the\r\nConstituent Assembly, the Comte de Châtenay-Lanty proposed that the\r\nmunicipality of Paris should be instructed to get together the papers\r\nfound at the Bastille, so that they might be arranged, and that extracts\r\nfrom them might be printed and published, \"in order to keep for ever\r\nalive in the hearts of Frenchmen, by means of this reading, the\r\ndetestation of arbitrary orders and the love of liberty\"! This book was\r\nto be the preface to the constitution. Finally, the district of St. Roch\r\ntook the initiative in calling upon the electors to restore to the\r\nnation the papers carried off from the Bastille by Beaumarchais.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting of July 24, the Electoral Assembly passed a resolution\r\nenjoining such citizens as were in possession of papers from the\r\nBastille to bring them back to the Hôtel de Ville. The appeal was\r\nresponded to, and the restitutions were numerous.\r\n\r\nWhen the pillage and destruction had been stopped and possession had\r\nbeen regained of a part of the stolen documents, the papers were\r\nconsigned to three different depositories; but it was not long before\r\nthey were deposited all together in the convent of St. Louis la Culture.\r\nAt length, on November 2, 1791, the Commune of Paris resolved to have\r\nthe precious documents placed in the city library. The decision was so\r\nmuch the more happy in that the transfer, while placing the papers under\r\nthe guardianship of trained men and genuine librarians, did not\r\nnecessitate removal, since the city library at that date occupied the\r\nsame quarters as the archives of the Bastille, namely, the convent of\r\nSt. Louis la Culture.\r\n\r\nTo the revolutionary period succeeded times of greater calm. The\r\narchives of the Bastille, after being the object of so much discussion,\r\nand having occupied the Constituent Assembly, the Electoral Assembly,\r\nthe Paris Commune, the press, Mirabeau, La Fayette, Bailly, all Paris,\r\nthe whole of France, fell into absolute oblivion. They were lost from\r\nsight; the very recollection of them was effaced. In 1840, a young\r\nlibrarian named François Ravaisson discovered them in the Arsenal\r\nlibrary at the bottom of a veritable dungeon. How had they got stranded\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nAmeilhon, the city librarian, had been elected on April 22, 1797, keeper\r\nof the Arsenal library. Anxious to enrich the new depository of which he\r\nhad become the head, he obtained a decree handing over the papers of the\r\nBastille to the Arsenal library. The librarians recoiled in dismay\r\nbefore this invasion of documents, more than 600,000 in number and in\r\nthe most admired disorder. Then, having put their heads together, they\r\nhad the papers crammed into a dusty back-room, putting off the sorting\r\nof them from day to day. Forty years slipped away. And if it happened\r\nthat some old antiquary, curious and importunate, asked to be allowed to\r\nconsult the documents he had heard spoken of in his youth, he was\r\nanswered--no doubt in perfect good faith--that they did not know what he\r\nwas talking about.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 François Ravaisson had to get some repairs done in his kitchen\r\nat the Arsenal library. The slabs of the flooring were raised, when\r\nthere came to view, in the yawning hole, a mass of old papers. It\r\nhappened by the merest chance that, as he drew a leaf out of the heap,\r\nRavaisson laid his hand on a _lettre de cachet_. He understood at once\r\nthat he had just discovered the lost treasure. Fifty years of laborious\r\neffort have now restored the order which the victors of the 14th of July\r\nand successive removals had destroyed. The archives of the Bastille\r\nstill constitute, at the present day, an imposing collection, in spite\r\nof the gaps made by fire and pillage in 1789, for ever to be regretted.\r\nThe administration of the Arsenal library has acquired copies of the\r\ndocuments coming from the Bastille which are preserved at St.\r\nPetersburg. The archives of the Bastille are now open to inspection by\r\nany visitor to the Arsenal library, in rooms specially fitted up for\r\nthem. Several registers had holes burnt in them on the day of the\r\ncapture of the Bastille, their binding is scorched black, their leaves\r\nare yellow. In the boxes the documents are now numbered, and they are\r\ndaily consulted by men of letters. The catalogue has been compiled and\r\npublished recently, through the assiduity of the minister of public\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nIt is by the light of these documents, of undeniable genuineness and\r\nauthority, that the black shade which so long brooded over the Bastille\r\nhas at length been dispelled. The legends have melted away in the clear\r\nlight of history, as the thick cloak of mist with which night covers the\r\nearth is dissipated by the morning sun; and enigmas which mankind,\r\nwearied of fruitless investigations, had resigned itself to declare\r\ninsoluble, have now at last been solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE BASTILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar describes a structure three stories high which his\r\nlegionaries used rapidly to erect in front of towns they were besieging.\r\nSuch was the remote origin of the \"bastides\" or \"bastilles,\" as these\r\nmovable fortresses were called in the Middle Ages. Froissart, speaking\r\nof a place that was being invested, says that \"bastides were stationed\r\non the roads and in the open country\" in such a manner that the town\r\ncould get no food supplies. It was not long before the designation was\r\napplied to the fixed towers erected on the ramparts for the defence of\r\nthe towns, and more particularly to those which were constructed at the\r\nentrance gates.\r\n\r\nIn 1356, the chroniclers mention some important works that had been done\r\non the circumvallations of Paris. These were constructions interrupting\r\nthe wall at intervals, and so placed as to protect either an entrance\r\ngate or the wall itself. The special designations of _eschiffles_,\r\n_guérites_, or _barbacanes_ were applied to such of these buildings as\r\nrose between two gates of the city, while the _bastilles_ or _bastides_\r\nwere those which defended the gates. The first stone of the edifice\r\nwhich for more than four centuries was to remain famous under the name\r\nof the Bastille was laid on April 22, 1370, by the mayor of Paris in\r\nperson, Hugh Aubriot, the object being to strengthen the defences of the\r\ncity against the English. To reproach the king, Charles V., with the\r\nconstruction of a cruel prison would be almost as reasonable as to\r\nreproach Louis-Philippe with the construction of the fortress of Mont\r\nValérien. We borrow these details from M. Fernand Bournon's excellent\r\nwork on the Bastille in the _Histoire générale de Paris_.\r\n\r\n\"The Bastille,\" writes M. Bournon, \"at the time of its capture on July\r\n14, 1789, was still identical, except in some trifling particulars, with\r\nthe work of the architects of the fourteenth century.\" The Place de la\r\nBastille of the present day does not correspond exactly to the site of\r\nthe fortress. Mentally to restore that site it is necessary to take away\r\nthe last houses of the Rue Saint-Antoine and the Boulevard Henri IV.;\r\nthe ground they occupy was then covered with the château and its glacis.\r\nThe round towers, however, must have extended considerably in advance of\r\nthe line of the houses and have encroached upon the pavement. The plan\r\nreproducing the site exactly is to-day marked by lines of white stones,\r\nby means of which all Parisians may get some notion of it if they go to\r\nthe Place de la Bastille.\r\n\r\nM. Augé de Lassus, who drew so largely upon the works of M. Bournon and\r\nourselves for his lecture on the Bastille,[21] will permit us in our\r\nturn to borrow from him the description he gave of the Bastille, so far\r\nas its construction is concerned. Prints of the commonest kind which\r\nhave circulated in thousands, the more recent reconstruction which in\r\n1889 gave Paris so much entertainment, have familiarized us with the\r\naspect of the Bastille, whose eight circular towers, connected by\r\ncurtains of equal height, give us the impression of a box all of a\r\npiece, or, if you prefer it, an enormous sarcophagus. The eight towers\r\nall had their names. There were the Corner, the Chapel, and the Well\r\ntowers, names readily accounted for by their position or by details of\r\ntheir construction. Then came the Bertaudière and Bazinière towers,\r\nbaptized by the names of two former prisoners. The Treasure tower was so\r\ncalled because it had received on many occasions, notably under Henri\r\nIV., the custody of the public money. The excellent poet Mathurin\r\nRegnier alludes to this fact in these oft-quoted lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now mark these parsons, sons of ill-got gain,\r\n     Whose grasping sires for years have stolen amain,\r\n     Whose family coffers vaster wealth conceal,\r\n     Than fills that royal store-house, the Bastille.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventh tower was known as the County tower, owing its name, as M.\r\nBournon conjectures, to the feudal dignity called the County of Paris.\r\n\"The hypothesis,\" he adds, \"derives the greater weight from the fact\r\nthat the mayors of Paris were called, up to the end of the _ancien\r\nrégime_, mayors of the town and viscounty of Paris.\" The eighth tower\r\nbore a name which, for the tower of a prison, is very remarkable. It was\r\ncalled the Tower of Liberty. This odd appellation had come to it from\r\nthe circumstance that it had been the part of the Bastille where\r\nprisoners were lodged who enjoyed exceptionally favourable treatment,\r\nthose who had the \"liberty\" of walking during the day in the courtyards\r\nof the château. These prisoners were said to be \"in the liberty of the\r\ncourt\"; the officers of the château called them the \"prisoners of the\r\nliberty\" in contradistinction to the prisoners \"in durance\"; and that\r\none of the eight towers in which they were lodged was thus, quite\r\nnaturally, called \"the Tower of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe towers of the Chapel and the Treasure, which were the oldest, had\r\nflanked the original gateway, but this was soon walled up, leaving\r\nhowever in the masonry the outline of its arch, and even the statues of\r\nsaints and crowned princes that had been the only ornaments of its bare\r\nwalls. \"In accordance with custom,\" says M. Augé de Lassus, \"the\r\nentrance to the Bastille was single and double at the same time; the\r\ngate for vehicles, defended by its drawbridge, was flanked by a smaller\r\ngate reserved for foot passengers, and this, too, was only accessible\r\nwhen a small drawbridge was lowered.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first of the two courtyards of the Bastille, D'Argenson had\r\nplaced a monumental clock held up by large sculptured figures\r\nrepresenting prisoners in chains. The heavy chains fell in graceful\r\ncurves around the clock-face, as a kind of ornamentation. D'Argenson and\r\nhis artists had a ferocious taste.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of the defeat at St. Quentin,[22] the fear of invasion\r\ndecided Henri II., under the advice of Coligny, to strengthen the\r\nBastille. It was then, accordingly, that there was constructed, in front\r\nof the Saint-Antoine gate, the bastion which was at a later date to be\r\nadorned with a garden for the prisoners to walk in.\r\n\r\nAround the massive and forbidding prison, in the course of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, quite a little town sprang up and\r\nflourished, as in the Middle Ages happened around lofty and impressive\r\ncathedrals. Barbers, cobblers, drink-sellers, poulterers, cheesemongers,\r\nand general dealers had their shops there. These new buildings\r\nencroached on the Rue Saint-Antoine, and extended as far as the convent\r\nof the Visitation, the chapel of which, converted into a Protestant\r\nplace of worship, still exists.\r\n\r\n\"In its latter days,\" writes M. de Lassus, \"the Bastille with its\r\nappendages presented an appearance somewhat as follows:--On the Rue\r\nSaint-Antoine, a gateway of considerable size, and, with its trophies of\r\narms, making some pretensions to a triumphal arch, gave access to a\r\nfirst court skirted with shops, and open, at least during the day, to\r\nall comers. People might pass through it freely, but were not allowed to\r\nloiter there. Then appeared a second entrance, a double one for horse\r\nand foot traffic, each gate defended by its drawbridge. Admittance\r\nthrough this was more difficult, and the sentry's instructions more\r\nrigorous; this was the outer guard. As soon as this entrance was passed,\r\none came to the court of the governor, who received the more or less\r\nvoluntary visitor. On the right stretched the quarters of the governor\r\nand his staff, contiguous to the armoury. Then there were the moats,\r\noriginally supplied by the waters of the Seine--at that time people\r\nfrequently fell in and were drowned, the moats not being protected by\r\nany railing--in later times they were for the most part dry. Then rose\r\nthe lofty towers of the citadel, encircled, nearly a hundred feet up, by\r\ntheir crown of battlements; and then one found the last drawbridge, most\r\noften raised, at any rate before the carriage gate, the door for foot\r\npassengers alone remaining accessible, under still more rigorous\r\nconditions.\"\r\n\r\nThese conditions, so rigorous for contemporaries--the Czar Peter the\r\nGreat himself found them inflexible--are removed for the historian:\r\nthanks to the numerous memoirs left by prisoners, thanks to the\r\ndocuments relating to the administration of the Bastille now in the\r\nArsenal library, and to the correspondence of the lieutenants of police,\r\nwe shall penetrate into the interior of these well-fenced precincts and\r\nfollow the life of the prisoners day by day.\r\n\r\nIn its early days, then, the Bastille was not a prison, though it became\r\nsuch as early as the reign of Charles VI. Yet for two centuries it kept\r\nits character as a military citadel. Sometimes the kings gave lodgment\r\nthere to great personages who were passing through Paris. Louis XI. and\r\nFrancis I. held brilliant fêtes there, of which the chroniclers speak\r\nwith admiration.\r\n\r\nIt is Richelieu who must be considered the founder of the Bastille--the\r\nBastille, that is, as a royal prison, the Bastille of the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries. Before him, imprisonment in the old fortress\r\nwas merely casual; it is to him that we must trace the conception of the\r\nstate prison as an instrument of government. Here we shall be arrested\r\nby the question, what is to be understood by a state prison? The term,\r\nvague and open to discussion, is explained by M. Bournon. \"By a state\r\nprison--taking the Bastille as a particular instance--must be understood\r\na prison for those who have committed a crime or misdemeanour not\r\nprovided for by the common law; for those who, rightly or wrongly, have\r\nappeared dangerous to the safety of the state, whether the nation itself\r\nis concerned, or its head, or a body more or less considerable of\r\ncitizens, a body sometimes no larger than the family of the suspect. If\r\nwe add to this class of prisoners personages too conspicuous to be\r\npunished for a crime at common law on equal terms with the ordinary\r\nmalefactor, and for whom it would appear inevitable that an exceptional\r\nprison should be reserved, we shall have passed in review the different\r\nkinds of delinquents who expiated their misdeeds at the Bastille from\r\nthe time of Richelieu to the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Bastille, which, up to the reign of Louis\r\nXIII., was entrusted to great lords, dukes, constables, marshals of\r\nFrance--the Marshal de Bassompierre, the Constable de Luynes, the\r\nMarshal de Vitry, the Duke of Luxemburg, to mention only the last of\r\nthem--was placed by Richelieu in the hands of a real jailer, Leclerc du\r\nTremblay, brother of Père Joseph.[23]\r\n\r\nDocuments throwing any light on the Bastille at the time when the Red\r\nMan, as Victor Hugo named Richelieu, was supreme, are however very\r\nrare. An advocate, Maton de la Varenne, published in 1786, in his\r\n_Revolutions of Paris_, a letter which ostensibly had been written on\r\nDecember 1, 1642, to Richelieu, at that time ill. In it we read: \"I,\r\nwhom you are causing to rot in the Bastille for having disobeyed your\r\ncommandment, which would have brought upon my soul condemnation to\r\neternal hell, and would have made me appear in eternity with hands\r\nstained with blood----\" It is impossible to guarantee the authenticity\r\nof this document. To us it appears suspicious, the text having been\r\npublished at a time when many apocryphal documents were produced as\r\ncoming from the archives of the Bastille. More worthy of arresting our\r\nattention is the \"return of the prisoners who are in the château of the\r\nBastille,\" a document of Richelieu's time which M. Bournon discovered in\r\nthe archives of the Foreign Office. This catalogue, containing\r\nfifty-three names, is the oldest list of prisoners of the Bastille known\r\nup to the present time. Among the prisoners several are suspected or\r\nconvicted of evil designs against \"Monsieur le cardinal,\" some are\r\naccused of an intention to \"complot,\" that is, to conspire against the\r\nthrone, or of being spies. There is an \"extravagant\" priest, a monk who\r\nhad \"opposed Cluni's election,\" three hermits, three coiners, the\r\nMarquis d'Assigny, condemned to death, but whose punishment had been\r\ncommuted to perpetual imprisonment, a score or so of lords designated as\r\n\"madmen, vile scoundrels, evil wretches,\" or accused of some definite\r\ncrime, theft or murder; finally, those whose name is followed by the\r\nsimple note, \"Queen-mother,\" or \"Monsieur,\"[24] whence we may conclude\r\nthat the clerk had no exact information about the prisoners of the\r\ncardinal. We shall give later the list of the prisoners in the Bastille\r\non the day of its capture, July 14, 1789; and the comparison between the\r\ntwo lists at the two periods, the remotest and the most recent that we\r\ncould select, will be instructive. We have also, to assist us in forming\r\na judgment of the Bastille in Richelieu's time, the memoirs of\r\nBassompierre and of Laporte, which transport us into a state prison,\r\nelegant, we might almost say luxurious, reserved for prisoners of birth\r\nand breeding, where they lived observing all social usages in their\r\nmutual relations, paying and returning calls. But the Bastille preserved\r\nits military character for many more years, and among the prisoners we\r\nfind especially a number of officers punished for breaches of\r\ndiscipline. Prisoners of war were confined there, and foreign personages\r\nof high rank arrested by way of reprisal, secret agents and spies\r\nemployed in France by hostile nations; finally, powerful lords who had\r\nincurred the king's displeasure. The court intrigues under Richelieu and\r\nMazarin contributed to the diversion of the Bastille from its original\r\nintention: they began to incarcerate there _valets de chambre_ who had\r\nsomehow become mixed up in the plots of sovereigns.\r\n\r\nReligious persecution was revived by the government of Louis XIV., and\r\nere long a whole world of gazetteers and \"novelists,\" the journalists of\r\nthe period, were seen swarming like flies in the sun. Louis XIV. was not\r\nprecisely a stickler for the liberty of the press, but on the other hand\r\nhe shrank from cooping up men of letters, Jansenists and Protestants\r\nconvinced of the truth of their beliefs, pell-mell with the vagabonds\r\nand thiefs confined at Bicêtre, Saint-Lazare, and the other prisons of\r\nParis. He threw open to them, too generously no doubt, the portals of\r\nhis château in the Suburb Saint-Antoine, where they mixed with young men\r\nof family undergoing a mild course of the Bastille at the request of\r\ntheir parents, and with quarrelsome nobles whom the marshals of France,\r\nanxious to avoid duels, used to send there to forget their animosities.\r\nFurther, the reign of Louis XIV. was marked by some great trials which\r\nproduced a strange and appalling impression, and threw around the\r\naccused a halo of mystery--trials for magic and sorcery, cases of\r\npoisoning and base coining. The accused parties in these cases were\r\nconfined in the Bastille. And here we encounter a fresh departure from\r\nthe primitive character of the old fortress; prisoners were sent there\r\nwhose cases were tried by the regularly constituted judges. Henceforth\r\nprisoners who appeared before the court of the Arsenal were divided\r\nbetween the Bastille and the fortress of Vincennes.\r\n\r\nThis is the grand epoch in the history of the Bastille: it is now a\r\nveritable prison of state. Writers can speak of its \"nobleness.\" It\r\nshows itself to us in colours at once charming and awe-inspiring,\r\nbrilliant, majestic, now filled with sounds of merriment, now veiled\r\nwith an appalling silence. From the gloomy regions within the massive\r\nwalls there come to us the sounds of song and laughter mingled with\r\ncries of despair, with sobs and tears. This is the period of the Iron\r\nMask: the period when the governor receives mysterious letters from the\r\ncourt. \"I beg you, sir, to see that, if anyone comes to ask for news of\r\nthe prisoner whom Desgrez conducted to the Bastille this morning by\r\norder of the king, nothing be said about him, and that, if possible, in\r\naccordance with the intention of His Majesty and the accompanying\r\ninstructions, no one may get to know him or even his name.\" \"M. de\r\nBernaville (the name of one of the governors of the Bastille), having\r\ngiven orders for the conveyance of an important prisoner to the prison\r\nof my château of the Bastille, I send this letter to inform you of my\r\nintention that you receive him there and keep him closely guarded until\r\nfurther orders, warning you not to permit him, under any pretext\r\nwhatever, to hold communication with any person, either by word of mouth\r\nor in writing.\" The prisoners surrounded with so absolute a silence\r\nalmost all belonged to the same category, namely, distinguished spies,\r\nwho seem to have been rather numerous in France at the full tide of\r\nLouis XIV.'s wars, and who were hunted down with an eagerness which grew\r\nin proportion as fortune frowned on the royal armies. We read in the\r\nJournal kept by the King's lieutenant, Du Junca: \"On Wednesday,\r\nDecember 22, about ten o'clock in the morning, M. de la Coste, provost\r\nof the King's armies, came here, bringing and leaving in our custody a\r\nprisoner whom for greater secrecy he caused to enter by our new gate,\r\nwhich allows us to pass into or out of the garden of the Arsenal at all\r\nhours--the which prisoner, M. d'Estingen by name, a German, but married\r\nin England, was received by the governor by order of the King sent by\r\nthe hand of the Marquis de Barbezieux, with explicit instructions to\r\nkeep the prisoner's presence a secret and to prevent him from holding\r\ncommunication with anyone, in speech or writing: the which prisoner is a\r\nwidower, without children, a man of intelligence, and doing a brisk\r\ntrade in news of what is happening in France, sending his information to\r\nGermany, England, and Holland: a gentlemanly spy.\" On February 10, 1710,\r\nPontchartrain wrote to Bernaville, governor of the Bastille: \"I cannot\r\nrefrain from telling you that you and the Chevalier de la Croix speak a\r\ngood deal too much and too openly about the foreign prisoners you have.\r\nSecrecy and mystery is one of your first duties, as I must ask you to\r\nremember. Neither D'Argenson nor any other than those I have apprized\r\nyou of should see these prisoners. Give explicit warning to the Abbé\r\nRenaudot and to de la Croix of the necessity of maintaining an\r\ninviolable and impenetrable secrecy.\"\r\n\r\nIt happened also at that period that a prisoner remained in complete\r\nignorance of the reason of his incarceration: \"The prisoner at the\r\nBastille named J. J. du Vacquay,\" writes Louvois to the governor, \"has\r\ncomplained to the King that he has been kept there for thirteen years\r\nwithout knowing the reason: be good enough to let me know what minister\r\nsigned the warrant under which he is detained, so that I may report to\r\nHis Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nAs the greater part of the papers relating to the arrest were destroyed\r\nas soon as the incarceration was effected, it sometimes happened that in\r\ncertain cases the reasons were not known even in the offices of the\r\nministers. Thus Seignelay writes to the governor, M. de Besmaus: \"The\r\nKing has commanded me to write and ask you who is a certain prisoner\r\nnamed Dumesnil, how long he has been at the Bastille, and for what\r\nreason he was placed there.\" \"The demoiselle de Mirail, a prisoner at\r\nthe Bastille, having demanded her liberty of the King, His Majesty has\r\ninstructed me to write and ask you the reason of her detention; if you\r\nknow it, be good enough to inform me at your earliest convenience.\"\r\nAgain, we find Louvois writing to the same effect: \"I am sending you a\r\nletter from M. Coquet, in regard to which the King has commanded me to\r\nask who signed the warrant under which he was sent to the Bastille, and\r\nwhether you know the reason of his being sent there.\" \"Sir, I am writing\r\na line merely to ask you to let me know who is Piat de la Fontaine, who\r\nhas been five years at the Bastille, and whether you do not remember why\r\nhe was placed there.\"\r\n\r\nLetters of this kind are, it is true, very rare; yet if one compares the\r\nstate of things they disclose with the extraordinary comfort and luxury\r\nwith which the prisoners were surrounded, they help to characterize the\r\ncelebrated prison at this epoch of its history, namely, the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn 1667 the office of lieutenant of police had been created. The first\r\nto hold the title was Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, a man of the\r\ngreatest worth. It is very important to note that under the _ancien\r\nrégime_ the lieutenant of police had a double function, being at the\r\nsame time a subordinate of the minister of Paris[25] and a member of the\r\nChâtelet.[26] His duties were thus of a twofold nature, administrative\r\nand judicial. Now the Bastille, as a state prison, was more especially\r\nan administrative institution; but gradually, owing to the character of\r\nthe persons brought there as prisoners, it became difficult to avoid\r\nturning it also into a judicial institution, and the minister of Paris\r\nbecame accustomed to delegate his subordinate, the lieutenant of police,\r\nto conduct the examination of the prisoners at the Bastille. Though La\r\nReynie took practically the whole responsibility of the administration\r\nof the Bastille, his visits to the prison itself were nevertheless\r\nrelatively rare, and on every occasion a permit signed by Louis XIV. or\r\nby Colbert was necessary.\r\n\r\nLa Reynie was succeeded by D'Argenson. Under him the powers of the\r\nlieutenant of police were very largely extended, and the Bastille was\r\ncomprised within his jurisdiction. Henceforth the lieutenant of police\r\nwill enter the state prison whenever it seems good to him, as lord and\r\nmaster, accompanied by his subordinates at the Châtelet, clerks and\r\ninspectors of police; the prisoners will be in direct and constant\r\ncommunication with him, and he will make an inspection of all the\r\nchambers at least once a year. We find that at every change in the\r\nlieutenancy of police, it sufficed for the minister of Paris to send the\r\nname of the new officer to the governor. Dating from this period, the\r\nprison in the Suburb Saint-Antoine remained under the authority of a\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nThe Regency was a transition period between the reigns of Louis XIV. and\r\nLouis XV., and there was a corresponding transition period in the\r\nhistory of the Bastille. The incarcerations were less numerous and less\r\nrigorous, but the rule of the prison lost something of that aristocratic\r\nair which had characterized it. The most important episode in the\r\nhistory of the Bastille during the Regency was the incarceration of\r\nthose who were accused of complicity in the Cellamare conspiracy. Among\r\nthese was Mdlle de Launay, later to be known as Madame de Staal. She\r\nhas left some charming pages about her imprisonment, in which we find,\r\nrelated with a fluent and subtle pen, the little romance which we\r\nproceed to outline.\r\n\r\nMdlle de Launay was secretary to the Duchess of Maine. She had had some\r\npart in drawing up the scheme of the Cellamare conspiracy, which, if it\r\nhad succeeded, would have placed the king of Spain on the throne of\r\nFrance. On December 10, 1718, the Regent sent her, with several of her\r\naccomplices, to the Bastille, less with the idea of punishing her for\r\nmachinations against the state than to obtain from her details of the\r\nconspiracy. At that period of her life she was of but moderate fortune\r\nand rank, and it would not have been strange if she had been treated\r\nwith rigour. She found at the Bastille, on the contrary, unexpected\r\ncomfort and consideration. In her _Memoirs_, she writes that her sojourn\r\nat the Bastille was the pleasantest time of her life. Her maid, Rondel,\r\nwas permitted to live with her. She was installed in a veritable suite\r\nof rooms. She complained of the mice there, and a cat was given her, to\r\ndrive out the mice and provide some amusement. By and by there were\r\nkittens, and the sportive tricks of the numerous little family cheered\r\nher wonderfully, she said. Mdlle de Launay was regularly invited to dine\r\nwith the governor; she spent her days in writing and card-playing. The\r\nking's lieutenant, Maisonrouge, a man well on in years, who held, after\r\nthe governor, the first place in the administration of the château,\r\nconceived a profound and pathetic passion for the fair prisoner. He\r\ndeclared that nothing would give him greater happiness than to make her\r\nhis wife. His apartments happened to be near those of Mdlle de Launay.\r\nUnhappily for the king's lieutenant, there was in the neighbourhood a\r\nthird suite, occupied by a young and brilliant nobleman, the Chevalier\r\nde Ménil, who also was implicated in the Cellamare affair. The fair\r\nprisoner was not acquainted with him. Maisonrouge impresses us as a man\r\nof great dignity, and rare nobility of character. He spoke to the two\r\nyoung prisoners about each other, hoping, by bringing them into\r\ncommunication, to provide them with fresh distractions, more\r\nparticularly the lady, whom he loved. The Chevalier de Ménil and Mdlle\r\nde Launay could not see each other; they had never met. They began by\r\nexchanging epistles in verse. Like everything that came from her pen,\r\nthe verses of Mdlle de Launay were full of animation and charm. The good\r\nMaisonrouge played post between them, happy to see his little friend's\r\ndelight in the diversion she owed to him. It was not long before the\r\nverses carried from one room to the other by Maisonrouge began to speak\r\nof love, and this love--surprising as it may seem, but not difficult to\r\nunderstand in the sequestered life of the Bastille--ere long became real\r\nin the consciousness of the young people, who saw each other in\r\nimagination under the most charming colours. Maisonrouge was soon\r\ninduced to contrive an interview between them. It is a delightful\r\nmoment. The two captives had never seen each other, yet loved each\r\nother passionately: what will their mutual impressions be? Mdlle de\r\nLaunay's impression, when she saw the gay chevalier, was of unmixed\r\nenthusiasm; the chevalier's, maybe, was more subdued; but if it is true,\r\nas someone has said, that to nuns the gardener represents mankind, to a\r\nprisoner every young woman must be an exquisite creature. The interviews\r\ncontinued under the benevolent eye of Maisonrouge, who watched the\r\ndevelopment of Mdlle de Launay's love for Ménil--the love of the girl\r\nwhom he himself loved intensely, but whose happiness he preferred to his\r\nown. There are delightful details which may be found delightfully\r\ndescribed in Mdlle de Launay's _Memoirs_. It is M. Bournon's opinion\r\nthat, according to the testimony of Mdlle de Launay herself, this idyll\r\nof the Bastille had \"the dénouement that might have been foretold.\" We\r\nhave caught no hint of the sort in the _Memoirs_ of Madame de Staal, but\r\nthen, M. Bournon is no doubt the better psychologist. At any rate, the\r\ngovernor of the Bastille got wind of the diversions of the lovers. He\r\nput his foot down. Ménil was transferred to a distant tower, Mdlle de\r\nLaunay shed tears, and, incredible as it seems, Maisonrouge, while\r\nredoubling his efforts to please her, sympathized with her lot to the\r\npoint of arranging fresh and more difficult interviews with the sparkish\r\nchevalier. Mdlle de Launay left the prison in the spring of 1720, after\r\nhaving sent to the Regent a detailed statement of the facts of the\r\nconspiracy, which hitherto she had refused to furnish. Once at liberty,\r\nshe vainly implored the Chevalier de Ménil to fulfil his pledges and\r\nmake her his wife. Maisonrouge died in the following year, of\r\ndisappointment, says the gay coquette, at his failure to get from her,\r\nduring her imprisonment, the promise of marriage which now she would\r\nhave been glad enough to fulfil.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though under the Regency everything at the Bastille turned\r\non love--a reflection of the epoch itself. The young Duke de Richelieu\r\nwas locked up there because he did not love his wife. The brilliant\r\nnobleman was kept under lock and key for several weeks, \"in solitude and\r\ngloom,\" he says, when suddenly the door of his room flew open and Madame\r\nde Richelieu appeared, a wonder of grace, brightness and charm: \"The\r\nfair angel,\" writes the duke, \"who flew from heaven to earth to set\r\nPeter free was not so radiant.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the Bastille had been transformed from a military\r\ncitadel into a prison of state. We shall now witness, under the\r\ngovernment of the Duke of Orleans, another transformation, betokened by\r\nan event which is of little apparent importance. The Duke de Richelieu\r\nwas imprisoned in the Bastille a second time as the result of a duel: a\r\njudge of the Parlement went there to question him and the Parlement\r\ntried his case. The Parlement[27] at the Bastille, in the prison of the\r\nking! From that moment the fortress continued year by year to grow more\r\nlike our modern prisons. \"Under the Cardinal de Fleury,\" writes La\r\nHarpe, \"this famous château was inhabited by hardly any but Jansenist\r\nwriters: it then became the enforced residence of champions of\r\nphilosophy and authors of clandestine satires, and acted as a foil to\r\ntheir obscurity and shame.\" It became increasingly the practice to\r\nconfine there accused persons whose cases were regularly tried at the\r\nChâtelet or even before the Parlement. By the second half of the\r\neighteenth century accused persons had come to be incarcerated in the\r\nBastille by direct order of the Châtelet, which would have seemed\r\nincredible to a contemporary of Louis XIV. The summoning officer would\r\npost himself before the towers, and there, while the prisoner pressed\r\nhis head close against the bars of the window, the officer would shout\r\nthe terms of the writ at him across the moat. The advocates defending\r\nthe accused obtained permission to go and consult their clients, and\r\nthey were the only persons who were permitted to interview the prisoners\r\nin private. On the appointed day the prisoner was transferred to the law\r\ncourts quietly and by night to avoid the curiosity of the crowd.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XVI. the judges of the Parlement visited the Bastille as\r\nthey visited the other prisons; at length the minister Breteuil sent\r\ninstructions to the officials informing them that no more _lettres de\r\ncachet_ would be issued without stating the duration of the penalty to\r\nwhich the guilty person was condemned and the grounds for his\r\npunishment. The Bastille was now merely a prison like the others,\r\nexcept that the prisoners were better treated there.\r\n\r\nIn 1713 Voysin, the Secretary of State, wrote to D'Argenson:\r\n\"Beaumanielle is not sufficiently deserving of consideration to warrant\r\nhis removal from the Châtelet to the Bastille.\" La Harpe has well\r\ndescribed the transformation which from this time came over the great\r\nstate prison by saying that, from the beginning of the century, none of\r\nthe prisoners who had been placed there \"had merited the honour.\" His\r\nremark receives corroboration from Linguet: \"It is not, in these latter\r\ndays especially, for criminals of state that the Bastille is reserved:\r\nit has become in some sort the antichambre of the conciergerie.\"\r\n\r\nIf the glories of the Bastille paled as it grew older, on the other hand\r\ntorture, which, it is true, had never been applied except by order of\r\nthe courts, had completely disappeared. From the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, the cells and chains were merely a temporary\r\npunishment reserved for insubordinate prisoners: from the accession of\r\nLouis XVI. they had fallen into disuse. Breteuil forbade any person\r\nwhatever to be placed in the cells, which were the rooms on the lowest\r\nfloor of each tower, a sort of damp and gloomy vaults. On September 11,\r\n1775, Malesherbes writes: \"No prisoner should be refused material for\r\nreading and writing. The abuse it is pretended that they may make of it\r\ncannot be dangerous, confined so closely as they are. Nor should any\r\nrefusal be made to the desire of such as may wish to devote themselves\r\nto other occupations, provided they do not require you to leave in their\r\nhands tools of which they might avail themselves to effect their escape.\r\nIf any of them should wish to write to his family and his friends, he\r\nmust be permitted to receive replies, and to send replies to their\r\nletters after having read them. In all this you must be guided by your\r\nprudence and your humanity.\" The reading of the gazettes, formerly\r\nrigidly forbidden, was now authorised.\r\n\r\nIt must further be remarked that the number of prisoners confined in the\r\nBastille was not so large as might be thought. During the whole reign of\r\nLouis XVI. the Bastille received no more than two hundred and forty\r\nprisoners, an average of sixteen a year; while it had room for forty-two\r\nin separate apartments.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIV., at the period when the government was most liberal in\r\ndispensing its _lettres de cachet_, an average of only thirty prisoners\r\na year entered the château, and their captivity was for the most part of\r\nshort duration. Dumouriez informs us in his _Memoirs_ that during his\r\ndetention he had never more than eighteen fellow prisoners, and that\r\nmore than once he had only six. M. Alfred Bégis has drawn up a list of\r\nthe prisoners detained in the Bastille from 1781 to 1789. In May, 1788,\r\nit contained twenty-seven prisoners, the highest figure reached during\r\nthese eight year; in September, 1782, it contained ten; in April, 1783,\r\nseven; in June of the same year, seven; in December, 1788, nine; in\r\nFebruary, 1789, nine; at the time of its capture, July 14, 1789, there\r\nwere seven.\r\n\r\nTrue, not only men were locked up in the Bastille, but also books when\r\nthey appeared dangerous. The royal warrant under which they were\r\nincarcerated was even drawn up on the model of the _lettres de cachet_.\r\nM. Bournon has published a specimen of these. The books were shut up in\r\na closet between the towers of the Treasure and the County, over an old\r\npassage communicating with the bastion. In 1733 the lieutenant of police\r\ninstructed the governor of the Bastille to receive at the château \"all\r\nthe apparatus of a clandestine printing-press which had been seized in a\r\nchamber of the Saint-Victor abbey: the which you will be good enough to\r\nhave placed in the store room of the Bastille.\" When the books ceased to\r\nappear dangerous, they were set at liberty. In this way the\r\n_Encyclopædia_[28] was liberated after a detention of some years.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that during the reign of Louis XVI. the Bastille did\r\nnot receive more than sixteen prisoners a year, on an average. Several\r\nof these were only detained for a few days. From 1783 to 1789 the\r\nBastille remained almost empty, and would have been absolutely empty if\r\nit had not been decided to place there prisoners who should properly\r\nhave been elsewhere. As early as February, 1784, the fortress of\r\nVincennes, which served as a sort of overflow pipe to the Bastille, had\r\nbeen shut for lack of prisoners. The system of _lettres de cachet_ was\r\nslipping away into the past. On the other hand, the Bastille was a\r\nsource of great expense to the King. The governor alone received 60,000\r\nlivres annually. When you add the salaries and board of the officers of\r\nthe garrison, the turnkeys, the physicians, the surgeon, the apothecary,\r\nthe chaplains; when you add the food--this alone in 1774 came to 67,000\r\nlivres--and the clothing of the prisoners, and the upkeep of the\r\nbuildings, the total will appear outrageous, for the figures given above\r\nmust be tripled to represent the value of the present day. So Necker,\r\nseeing that the Bastille was of no further utility, thought of\r\nsuppressing it \"for economy's sake,\"[29] and he was not the only one in\r\nhigh places to speak of this suppression. The Carnavalet[30] museum\r\npossesses a scheme drawn up in 1784 by Corbet, the superintending\r\narchitect to the city of Paris, whence the project has an official\r\ncharacter: it is a scheme for a \"Place Louis XVI.\" to be opened up on\r\nthe site of the old fortress. We learn from Millin that other artists\r\n\"were occupied with a scheme for erecting a monument on the site of the\r\nBastille.\" One of these schemes deserves special mention. Seven of the\r\neight towers were to be destroyed, the eighth to remain standing, but in\r\na significant state of dilapidation: on the site of the demolished\r\ntowers a monument was to be erected to the glory of Louis XVI. This\r\nmonument was to consist of a pedestal formed by piling up chains and\r\nbolts taken from the state prison, above which would rise a statue of\r\nthe king, one hand extended towards the ruined tower with the gesture of\r\na deliverer. It is to be regretted, if not for the beauty, at least, for\r\nthe picturesqueness of Paris, that this scheme was never put into\r\nexecution. Davy de Chavigné, king's counsellor and auditor to the\r\ntreasury, was allowed to present to the Royal Academy of Architecture,\r\nat its sitting on June 8, 1789, \"a plan for a monument on the site of\r\nthe Bastille, to be decreed by the States General to Louis XVI. as the\r\nrestorer of the public liberty.\" On this subject the famous sculptor\r\nHoudon wrote to Chavigné: \"I am very anxious for the plan to be adopted.\r\nThe idea of erecting a monument to liberty on the very spot where\r\nslavery has reigned up to the present, appears to me particularly well\r\nconceived, and well calculated to inspire genius. I shall think myself\r\nonly too fortunate to be among the artists who will celebrate the epoch\r\nof the regeneration of France.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen prints, long anterior to 1789--one of them the frontispiece\r\nof the edition of Linguet's _Memoirs_ that appeared in 1783--representing\r\nLouis XVI. extending his hand towards the lofty towers, which workmen\r\nare in the act of demolishing.\r\n\r\nAmong the archives of the Bastille are preserved two reports drawn up in\r\n1788 by the king's lieutenant, Puget, the most important personage in\r\nthe fortress after the governor. He proposes the suppression of the\r\nstate prison, the demolition of the old château, and the sale of the\r\nground for the benefit of the crown. It may be said of these schemes, as\r\nof the plan of the architect Corbet, that they would not have been\r\npropounded if they had not been approved in high places.\r\n\r\nFurther, in the year 1784, an ardent supporter of the old state of\r\nthings cried: \"Oh! if our young monarch ever committed a fault so great,\r\nif he so far belied the most ancient usages of this government, if it\r\nwere possible that one day he could be tempted to destroy you\" (the\r\nauthor is apostrophizing the Bastille) \"to raise on your ruins a\r\nmonument to the liberator-king....\" The demolition of the Bastille was\r\ndecided on; and it would have been accomplished as a government\r\nundertaking but for the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nFrom January 1 to July 14, 1789, that is to say for more than six\r\nmonths, only one solitary prisoner entered the Bastille; and what a\r\nprisoner!--Réveillon, the paper manufacturer of the Suburb\r\nSaint-Antoine, who was shut up on May 1 at his own request, in order to\r\nescape the fury of the mob. The same year, the lieutenant of police, de\r\nCrosne, made an inspection of the Bastille, accompanied by a judge of\r\nthe Parlement; their object was to arrange officially about the\r\ndestruction of the state prison.\r\n\r\nThus, on the eve of the Revolution, the Bastille no longer existed,\r\nthough its towers were still standing.\r\n\r\nThe victors of the 14th of July set free seven prisoners: four forgers\r\nwhose arrest had been ordered by the Châtelet, whose case had been\r\nregularly tried, and whose proper place was an ordinary prison; two\r\nmadmen who ought to have been at Charenton; and the Comte de Solages, a\r\nyoung nobleman who had been guilty of a monstrous crime over which it\r\nwas desired to throw a veil out of regard for his family; he was\r\nmaintained on a pension paid by his father. The conquerors of the\r\nBastille destroyed an old fortified castle: the state prison no longer\r\nexisted. They \"broke in an open door.\" That was said of them even in\r\n1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE BASTILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving sketched rapidly and with bold strokes the outlines of the\r\nhistory of the Bastille from its foundation to its fall, we intend to\r\nshow how the rule to which prisoners in the fortress of the Suburb\r\nSaint-Antoine were submitted underwent its own process of\r\ntransformation, parallel with the transformation of the prison itself.\r\nTo understand the facts which follow, and which are of a kind to astound\r\nthe mind of everyone in these days, it is necessary to remember what we\r\nhave already said as to the character of the Bastille. It was the prison\r\nof luxury, the aristocratic prison of the _ancien régime_, the _prison\r\nde luxe_ at a period when it was no dishonour, as we shall see later, to\r\nbe confined there. We must remember the phrase of the minister of Paris\r\nwriting to D'Argenson, in regard to a personage of but modest rank, that\r\nthis individual did not deserve \"consideration\" enough to be put in the\r\nBastille. Let us reflect on this observation of Mercier in his excellent\r\n_Pictures of Paris_: \"The people fear the Châtelet more than the\r\nBastille. Of the latter they have no dread, because it is almost unknown\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\nWe have shown how the Bastille, originally a military citadel, had\r\nbecome a prison of state; then, little by little, had approximated to\r\nthe ordinary prisons, until the day when it died a natural death ere it\r\ncould be assassinated. The same transformation took place in the\r\ntreatment of the prisoners. Midway in the seventeenth century, the\r\nBastille had none of the characteristics of a prison, but was simply a\r\nchâteau in which the king caused certain of his subjects to sojourn, for\r\none cause or another. They lived there just as they thought proper,\r\nfurnishing their rooms according to their fancy with their own\r\nfurniture, indulging their tastes in regard to food at their own\r\nexpense, and waited on by their own servants. When a prisoner was rich\r\nhe could live at the Bastille in princely style; when he was poor, he\r\nlived there very wretchedly. When the prisoner had no property at all,\r\nthe king did not for that reason give him furniture or food; but he gave\r\nhim money which he might use as seemed good to him in providing himself\r\nwith furniture and food: money of which he could retain a part--a number\r\nof prisoners did not fail to do so--these savings becoming his own\r\nproperty. This system, the character of which it is important to\r\nrecognize, underwent gradual modification during the course of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, approximating, without ever\r\nbecoming identical with, the system of our modern prisons. Thus the\r\nking, instead of granting pensions individually to the poorest of the\r\nprisoners, came to endow the Bastille with a certain fixed number of\r\npensions for the less fortunate prisoners. The recipients of these\r\npensions continued to enjoy them for long years, and if they did not\r\nwish the whole of the money to be expended on their support, the balance\r\nwas handed over to them. So we see certain individuals getting little\r\nfortunes together by the mere fact of their having been prisoners in the\r\nBastille--a circumstance which has so much surprised historians because\r\nthey have not sought its cause. It even happened that prisoners, when\r\ntheir liberation was announced to them, asked to remain a little longer\r\nin order to swell their savings, a favour which was sometimes granted\r\nthem. In the course of the eighteenth century the money destined to the\r\nmaintenance of the prisoners at the Bastille could not be diverted from\r\nits purpose; the prisoners were no longer able to appropriate a part;\r\nthe whole sum had to be expended.\r\n\r\nIt was only in the second half of the seventeenth century that the king\r\nhad some rooms at the Bastille furnished for such prisoners as were\r\nwithout means of procuring furniture themselves. And it is very\r\ninteresting to note that it was only at the extreme end of the century,\r\nunder the administration of Saint-Mars, that certain apartments of the\r\nBastille were arranged in the prison style with bars and bolts. Until\r\nthen they had been simply the rooms of a stronghold.[31]\r\n\r\nLet us follow the prisoner from his entrance to his exit.\r\n\r\nWhen the _lettre de cachet_ had been signed, it was usually a sort of\r\nsheriff's officer who effected the arrest. He appeared in company with\r\nfive or six men-at-arms, and signified the arrest by touching his quarry\r\nwith a white staff. A coach was in waiting. The police officer politely\r\nbegged the person he was instructed to secure to step into the coach,\r\nand took his place beside him. And, according to the testimony of\r\nvarious memoirs, while the vehicle was rolling along with lowered\r\nblinds, there was a pleasant conversational exchange of courtesies up to\r\nthe moment of the prisoner's finding himself within the walls of the\r\nBastille. A certain Lafort was living in furnished apartments with a\r\nyoung and pretty Englishwoman whom he had abducted, when one evening,\r\nabout sunset, a police officer arrived. The coach was at the door.\r\nPreliminaries were settled on both sides with as much politeness as if a\r\nvisit or an evening party had been the topic of discussion. They all got\r\ninto the vehicle, even the young man's lackey who, beguiled by\r\nappearances, mounted behind. Arrived at the Bastille, the lackey lost no\r\ntime in descending to open the door: there was general astonishment,\r\nespecially on the part of the poor servant, when he learnt that since he\r\nhad entered the Bastille along with his master, he must stay with him.\r\n\r\nMost often the officer and his companions surprised their quarry early\r\nin the morning, on rising from bed. Imagine then the coach with the\r\nprisoner and the police officer inside, arriving before the Bastille, in\r\nthe first court in front of the castle keep. \"Who goes there?\" cries the\r\nsentinel. \"The king's writ!\" replies the officer. At this, the shops we\r\nhave seen attached to the flanks of the château are bound at once to be\r\nshut. The soldiers on guard have to turn their faces to the wall, or\r\nperhaps to pull their hats over their eyes. The coach passes the\r\noutpost, a bell sounds. \"Advance!\" cries the officer on duty. The\r\ndrawbridge is lowered and the coach rattles over the stout iron-clamped\r\nboards. For greater secrecy, spies and prisoners of war were taken in by\r\na private door leading to the gardens of the Arsenal.\r\n\r\nOfficers and noblemen presented themselves before the Bastille alone,\r\nunless they were accompanied by relatives or friends. \"It is my\r\nintention,\" the king had written to them, \"that you betake yourselves to\r\nmy château of the Bastille.\" And no one dreamt of declining the royal\r\ninvitation. Further, when the governor desired to transfer one of them\r\nfrom one prison to another, he contented himself with telling him so. We\r\nfind in the Journal of Du Junca, king's lieutenant[32] at the Bastille,\r\nseveral notes like the following: \"Monday, December 26, 1695, about ten\r\no'clock in the morning, M. de Villars, lieutenant-colonel of the\r\nregiment of Vosges infantry, came and reported himself a prisoner, as\r\nordered by M. Barbezieux, though he was a prisoner in the citadel of\r\nGrenoble, whence he came direct without being brought by anyone.\"[33] On\r\nthe arrival of the prisoner, the king's lieutenant, accompanied by the\r\ncaptain of the gates, came to receive him as he got out of his carriage.\r\nThe officers of the château at once led the new-comer into the presence\r\nof the governor, who received him civilly, invited him to sit down, and\r\nafter having endorsed the _lettre de cachet_ conversed with him for some\r\ntime. Under Louis XIV. the governor in most cases even kept his new\r\nguest, as well as the persons who had accompanied him, to lunch or\r\ndinner. Meanwhile his quarters had been got ready. We read in Du Junca's\r\nJournal that on January 26, 1695, a certain De Courlandon, a colonel of\r\ncavalry, presented himself for incarceration at the Bastille. There\r\nbeing no room ready to receive him, the governor asked him to go and\r\npass the night in a neighbouring inn, at the sign of the _Crown_, and\r\nto return next day. \"Whereupon M. de Courlandon did not fail to return\r\nabout eleven o'clock in the morning, having dined with M. de Besmaus\r\n(the governor), and in the afternoon he entered the château.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will not be surprised at learning that the prospect of\r\nincarceration at the Bastille did not always strike the future prisoner\r\nwith terror. We read in the _Memoirs_ of the Duke de Lauzun:[34]\r\n\"Scolded for two hours on end by everybody who fancied himself entitled\r\nto do so, I thought I could not do better than go to Paris and await\r\ndevelopments. A few hours after my arrival, I received a letter from my\r\nfather telling me that it had been decided to put us all in the\r\nBastille, and that I should probably be arrested during the night. I\r\ndetermined at least to finish gaily, so I invited some pretty girls from\r\nthe Opera to supper, so that I might await the officer without\r\nimpatience. Seeing that he did not arrive, I determined on the bold move\r\nof going to Fontainebleau and joining the king's hunt. He did not speak\r\nto me once during the chase, which was such a confirmation of our\r\ndisgrace that on our return no one gave us the customary salute. But I\r\ndid not lose heart; in the evening I was in attendance, and the king\r\ncame to me. 'You are all,' he said, 'hotheaded rips, but funny dogs all\r\nthe same; come along and have supper, and bring M. de Guéméné and the\r\nChevalier de Luxembourg.'\"\r\n\r\nBefore the new arrival was installed in the chamber prepared for him, he\r\nwas taken to the great council hall, where he was requested to empty his\r\npockets. Only notorious rogues were searched. If the prisoner had upon\r\nhim money, jewels, or other articles such as knives and scissors, the\r\nuse of which was not allowed by the regulations, they were done up in a\r\nparcel which he himself sealed, with his own seal if he had one; if not,\r\nwith the seal of the Bastille. Finally, he was conducted to the room\r\nreserved for him.\r\n\r\nEach of the eight towers of the Bastille contained four or five stories\r\nof rooms or cells. The worst of these rooms were on the lowest floor,\r\nand these were what were called the \"cells,\"--octagonal vaults, cold and\r\ndamp, partly under ground; the walls, grey with mould, were bare from\r\nfloor to ceiling, the latter a groined arch. A bench and a bed of straw\r\ncovered with a paltry coverlet, formed the whole appointments. Daylight\r\nfeebly flickered through the vent-hole opening on to the moat. When the\r\nSeine was in flood, the water came through the walls and swamped the\r\ncells; and then any prisoners who might happen to be in them were\r\nremoved. During the reign of Louis XIV. the cells were sometimes\r\noccupied by prisoners of the lowest class and criminals condemned to\r\ndeath. Later, under Louis XV., the cells ceased to be used except as a\r\nplace of punishment for insubordinate prisoners who assaulted their\r\nguardians or fellow-prisoners, or for turnkeys and sentinels of the\r\nchâteau who had committed breaches of discipline. They stayed in the\r\ncells for a short time in irons. The cells had fallen into disuse by\r\nthe time the Revolution broke out; since the first ministry of Necker,\r\nit had been forbidden to confine in them any one whatever, and none of\r\nthe warders questioned on July 18 remembered having seen any one placed\r\nin them. The two prisoners, Tavernier and Béchade, whom the conquerors\r\nof the 14th of July found in one of these dungeons, had been placed\r\nthere, at the moment of the attack, by the officers of the château, for\r\nfear lest amid the rain of bullets some harm should befall them.\r\n\r\nThe worst rooms after the cells were the _calottes_, the rooms on the\r\nfloor above. In summer the heat was extreme in them, and in winter the\r\ncold, in spite of the stoves. They were octagons whose ceilings, as the\r\nname implies, were shaped like a skull-cap. High enough in the centre,\r\nthey gradually diminished in height towards the sides. It was impossible\r\nto stand upright except in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were only placed in the cells and _calottes_ under\r\nexceptional circumstances. Every tower had two or three floors of lofty\r\nand airy chambers, and in these the prisoners lived. They were octagons\r\nfrom fifteen to sixteen feet in diameter and from fifteen to twenty feet\r\nhigh. Light entered through large windows approached by three steps. We\r\nhave said that it was only towards the end of Louis XIV.'s reign that\r\nthese rooms were arranged like prison cells with bars and bolts. They\r\nwere warmed with open fireplaces or stoves. The ceiling was whitewashed,\r\nthe floor of brick. On the walls the prisoners had chalked verses,\r\nmottoes, and designs.\r\n\r\nOne artistic prisoner amused himself by decorating the bare walls with\r\npaintings. The governor, delighted at seeing him thus find relaxation,\r\nmoved him from room to room; when he had finished filling one with his\r\ndesigns and arabesques, he was placed in another. Some of these rooms\r\nwere decorated with portraits of Louis XIV. placed above the\r\nchimney-piece, a characteristic detail which helps to show what the\r\nBastille was at this period: the château of the king, where the king\r\nreceived a certain number of his subjects as his willing or unwilling\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nThe best rooms in the Bastille were those that were fitted up in the\r\neighteenth century for the accommodation of the staff. These were what\r\nwere called the \"suites.\" In these were placed invalids and prisoners of\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, the furniture of these\r\napartments was still extremely simple: they were absolutely empty. The\r\nreason of this we have indicated above. \"I arrived,\" says Madame de\r\nStaal, \"at a room where there was nothing but four walls, very filthy,\r\nand daubed all over by my predecessors for want of something better to\r\ndo. It was so destitute of furniture that someone went and got a little\r\nstraw chair for me to sit on, and two stones to support a lighted\r\nfaggot, and a little candle-end was neatly stuck on the wall to give me\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners sent to their own homes for a table, bed, and chair, or\r\nthey hired these from the upholsterer of the Bastille. When they had\r\nnothing to bless themselves with, the government, as we have already\r\nsaid, did not provide them with furniture. It gave them money, sometimes\r\nconsiderable sums, which permitted them to adorn their rooms after their\r\nown fancy. This was the case in regard to all prisoners up to 1684. At\r\nthis date the king ordered the administration to supply furniture to\r\nthose of the prisoners whose detention was to be kept secret, for, by\r\ngetting in bedding from their own houses or the houses of friends, they\r\nmade known their arrest. D'Argenson had half a dozen of the rooms\r\npermanently furnished, others were furnished under Louis XV.; under\r\nLouis XVI., almost all were furnished. The appointments were very\r\nmodest: a bed of green baize with curtains, one or two tables, several\r\nchairs, fire-dogs, a shovel, and a small pair of tongs. But after having\r\nundergone examination, the prisoner retained the right of getting in\r\nfurniture from outside. And in this way the rooms of the prisoners were\r\nsometimes adorned with great elegance. Madame de Staal relates that she\r\nhad hers hung with tapestry; the Marquis de Sade covered the bare walls\r\nwith long and brilliant hangings: other prisoners ornamented their rooms\r\nwith family portraits: they procured chests of drawers, desks, round\r\ntables, dressing-cases, armchairs, cushions in Utrecht velvet; the\r\ninventories of articles belonging to the prisoners show that they\r\nmanaged to secure everything they thought necessary. The Abbé Brigault,\r\nwho was imprisoned at the same time as Madame de Staal and for the same\r\naffair, brought into the Bastille five arm-chairs, two pieces of\r\ntapestry, eleven serge hangings, eight chairs, a bureau, a small table,\r\nthree pictures, &c. The list of effects taken out of the Bastille by the\r\nComte de Belle-Isle when he was set at liberty includes a library\r\nconsisting of 333 volumes and ten atlases, a complete service of fine\r\nlinen and plate for the table, a bed furnished with gold-bordered red\r\ndamask, four pieces of tapestry on antique subjects, two mirrors, a\r\nscreen of gold-bordered red damask matching the bed, two folding\r\nscreens, two armchairs with cushions, an armchair in leather, three\r\nchairs in tapestry, an overmantel of gilt copper, tables, drawers,\r\nstands, candlestick of plated copper, &c. We might multiply examples,\r\neven from among prisoners of middle station.\r\n\r\nIt was the rule that prisoners newly arrived at the Bastille should be\r\nexamined within twenty-four hours. It sometimes happened, however, that\r\none or another remained for two or three weeks before appearing before\r\nthe magistrate. The Châtelet commissioner, specially delegated to the\r\nBastille for these examinations, founded his questions on notes supplied\r\nhim by the lieutenant of police, who, indeed, often went in person to\r\nsee the prisoners. A special commission was appointed for affairs of\r\nimportance. Dumouriez says that he was examined after nine hours of\r\ndetention by three commissioners: \"The president was an old councillor\r\nof state named Marville, a man of intelligence, but coarse and\r\nsarcastic. The second was M. de Sartine, lieutenant of police and\r\ncouncillor of state, a man of polish and refinement. The third was a\r\n_maître des requêtes_[35] named Villevaux, a very insincere and\r\ndisputatious fellow. The clerk, who had more intelligence than any of\r\nthem, was an advocate named Beaumont.\"\r\n\r\nWe have found many instances of prisoners who spoke in high terms of\r\ntheir judges. And it cannot be said that prisoners at the Bastille\r\nescaped judgment. A Châtelet commissioner examined them and sent the\r\nofficial report of his examination, with a statement of his opinion, to\r\nthe lieutenant of police. He decided whether the arrest should be\r\nsustained. Moreover, it would be a mistake to compare the lieutenant of\r\npolice under the _ancien régime_ with the prefect of police of to-day;\r\nthe lieutenants of police, selected from former _maîtres des requêtes_,\r\nhad a judicial character: the documents of the period call them\r\n\"magistrates\"; they issued decrees without appeal and pronounced penal\r\nsentences, even condemning to the galleys; they were at the same time\r\njustices of the peace with an extensive jurisdiction. In addition to the\r\nexamination held on the entrance of a prisoner, the lieutenants of\r\npolice, in the course of their frequent visits, addressed to the\r\nministers of Paris reports on the prisoners,--reports in which they\r\ndiscussed the evidence, and which constituted veritable judgments.\r\n\r\nWhen the prisoner was recognized as innocent, a new _lettre de cachet_\r\nsoon set him at liberty. The verdict of \"no true bill\" often supervened\r\nwith a rapidity which the decisions of our police magistrates would do\r\nwell to emulate. A certain Barbier, who entered the Bastille on February\r\n15, 1753, was found not guilty and set at liberty the next day. Of the\r\n279 persons imprisoned in the Bastille during the last fifteen years of\r\nthe _ancien régime_, thirty-eight benefited by the dropping of the\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nFinally--and here is a point on which the new method might well model\r\nitself on that of the Bastille--when a detention was recognized as\r\nunjust, the victim was indemnified. A great number of examples might be\r\nmentioned. An advocate named Subé left the Bastille on June 18, 1767,\r\nafter a detention of eighteen days; he had been falsely accused of the\r\nauthorship of a book against the king, and received compensation to the\r\ntune of 3000 livres, more than £240 of our money. A certain Pereyra,\r\nimprisoned in the Bastille from November 7, 1771, to April 12, 1772, and\r\nthen from July 1 to September 26, 1774, having been found to be\r\ninnocent, was reinstated in all his property, and received from the king\r\na life pension of 1200 livres, more than £100 to-day. A certain number\r\nof those accused in the Canada case, when the charge was withdrawn,\r\nreceived a life pension on leaving the Bastille. At other times, the\r\ndetention of an individual might throw his family into want. He was kept\r\nin the Bastille, if it was thought he deserved it, but his people were\r\nassisted. Under date September 3, 1763, the Duke de Choiseul writes to\r\nthe lieutenant of police: \"I have received the letter you did me the\r\nhonour of writing to me in favour of the children of the Sieur\r\nJoncaire-Chabert. I have the pleasure to inform you that I have got for\r\nthem a second subsidy of 300 livres (nearly £30 to-day) in consideration\r\nof the sad condition you informed me they were in.\" Louis XIV.\r\nguaranteed to Pellisson, at his liberation, a pension of 2000 crowns.\r\nThe Regent granted to Voltaire, when he left the Bastille, a pension of\r\n1200 livres. Louis XVI. awarded to Latude an annuity of 400 livres, and\r\nto La Rocheguérault an annuity of 400 crowns. The minister Breteuil\r\npensioned all the prisoners whom he set at liberty. Brun de Condamine,\r\nconfined from 1779 to 1783, received on leaving a sum of 600 livres.\r\nRenneville speaks of a prisoner to whom Seignelay gave an important\r\nsituation in compensation for his detention at the Bastille. We hear of\r\none, Toussaint Socquart, a commissioner of the Châtelet and of police\r\nwhose offices were restored to him when he came out of the Bastille. In\r\nfact, contrary to detention in our modern prisons, incarceration in the\r\nBastille did not cast the slightest slur on the prisoner's character,\r\neven in the eyes of those to whom his arrest was due, and instances have\r\nbeen known of men who, on their release from the Bastille, not only\r\nwere reinstated in public offices, but reached the highest positions.\r\n\r\nUntil his examinations were quite completed, the prisoner was kept in\r\nclose confinement. None but the officers of the château were allowed to\r\ncommunicate with him. And during this time he lived in solitude, unless\r\nhe had brought a servant with him. The administration readily permitted\r\nthe prisoners to avail themselves of the services of their valets, who\r\nwere boarded at the king's expense. It even happened that the government\r\nsometimes gave their prisoners valets, paying not only for their board,\r\nbut also their wages at the rate of 900 livres a year. One might cite\r\nprisoners of inferior rank who thus had servants to wait on them. Two or\r\nthree prisoners were sometimes put together in one room. Prison life has\r\nno greater terror than solitude. In absolute solitude many of the\r\nprisoners became mad. In company, the hours of captivity seemed less\r\ntedious and oppressive. Father and son, mother and daughter, aunt and\r\nniece, lived together. Many might be named. On September 7, 1693, a lady\r\nnamed De la Fontaine was taken to the Bastille for the second time. The\r\nfirst time, she had been imprisoned quite alone; but this new detention\r\nevoked the compassion of the lieutenant of police, who, to please the\r\npoor lady, sent her husband to the Bastille, locked him up with her, and\r\ngave them a lackey to wait on them.\r\n\r\nThe examinations being ended, the prisoners enjoyed a greater liberty.\r\nThey could then enter into communication with the people of the town.\r\nThey obtained permission to see their relatives and friends. These\r\nsometimes paid them visits in their rooms; but as a rule the interviews\r\ntook place in the council-hall, in presence of one of the officers of\r\nthe château. They were usually permitted to discuss only family affairs\r\nand business matters. All conversation on the Bastille and the reasons\r\nfor their imprisonment was forbidden. The rules of the prison increased\r\nin severity as time went on. Towards the end of Louis XV.'s reign the\r\nlieutenant of police went so far as to prescribe the subjects of\r\nconversation which would alone be permitted in the course of the visits\r\nthe prisoners received. \"They may talk to the prisoner about the harvest\r\nhis vineyards will yield this year, about cancelling a lease, about a\r\nmatch for his niece, about the health of his parents.\" But it is\r\nnecessary to read the _Memoirs_ of Gourville, Fontaine, Bussy-Rabutin,\r\nHennequin, Madame de Staal, the Duke de Richelieu, to form a general\r\nidea of life at the Bastille under Louis XIV. and under the Regent.\r\nSeveral prisoners were free to move about through the château wherever\r\nit seemed good to them; they entered the rooms of their fellow-prisoners\r\nat all hours of the day. The governor contented himself with locking\r\nthem in their own rooms at night. The prisoners who had the \"liberty of\r\nthe court\" organized games of bowls or _tonneau_, and hobnobbed with the\r\nofficers of the garrison. Fontaine relates that they might have been\r\nseen from the top of the towers, collected fifty at a time in the inner\r\ncourt Bussy-Rabutin's room was open to all comers: his wife and friends\r\nvisited him; he gave dinners to persons from court, plotted love\r\nintrigues there, and corresponded freely with his friends and relatives.\r\nSeveral prisoners even had permission to take a walk into the town on\r\ncondition of their returning to the château in the evening. Two brothers\r\nwere placed in the Bastille together. They went out when they pleased,\r\ntaking turns; it was sufficient for one or other to be always at the\r\nchâteau. The officers of the staff gossiped with the prisoners and gave\r\nthem advice as to the best means of obtaining their liberty.\r\n\r\nThis animated, courtly, and elegant life is described with infinite\r\ncharm by Madame de Staal, whom we have already cited. \"We all used to\r\nspend a part of the day with the governor. We dined with him, and after\r\ndinner I enjoyed a rubber of ombre with Messieurs de Pompadour and de\r\nBoisdavis, Ménil advising me. When it was over we returned to our own\r\napartments. The company met again in my rooms before supper, for which\r\nwe returned to the governor's, and after that we all went to bed.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which the prisoners were fed and looked after, that\r\nis surprising indeed, and what we shall say about it, though rigidly\r\naccurate, will perhaps be regarded as an exaggeration. The governor drew\r\nthree livres a day for the maintenance of a man of inferior rank; five\r\nlivres for the maintenance of a tradesman; ten livres for a banker, a\r\nmagistrate, or a man of letters; fifteen livres for a judge of the\r\nParlement; thirty-six livres for a marshal of France. The Cardinal de\r\nRohan had 120 francs a day spent on him. The Prince de Courlande, during\r\na stay of five months at the Bastille, spent 22,000 francs. These\r\nfigures must be doubled and trebled to give the value they would\r\nrepresent to-day.\r\n\r\nWe read, too, with the greatest astonishment the description of the\r\nmeals the prisoners made. Renneville, whose evidence is the more\r\nimportant in that his book is a pamphlet against the administration of\r\nthe Bastille, speaks in these terms of his first meal: \"The turnkey put\r\none of my serviettes on the table and placed my dinner on it, which\r\nconsisted of pea soup garnished with lettuce, well simmered and\r\nappetizing to look at, with a quarter of fowl to follow; in one dish\r\nthere was a juicy beef-steak, with plenty of gravy and a sprinkling of\r\nparsley, in another a quarter of forcemeat pie well stuffed with\r\nsweetbreads, cock's combs, asparagus, mushrooms, and truffles; and in a\r\nthird a ragoût of sheep's tongue, the whole excellently cooked; for\r\ndessert, a biscuit and two pippins. The turnkey insisted on pouring out\r\nmy wine. This was good burgundy, and the bread was excellent. I asked\r\nhim to drink, but he declared it was not permitted. I asked if I should\r\npay for my food, or whether I was indebted to the king for it. He told\r\nme that I had only to ask freely for whatever would give me pleasure,\r\nthat they would try to satisfy me, and that His Majesty paid for it\r\nall.\" The \"most Christian\" king desired that his guests should fast on\r\nFridays and in Lent, but he did not treat them any the worse on that\r\naccount. \"I had,\" says Renneville, \"six dishes, and an admirable prawn\r\nsoup. Among the fish there was a very fine weever, a large fried sole,\r\nand a perch, all very well seasoned, with three other dishes.\" At this\r\nperiod Renneville's board cost ten francs a day; later he was reduced to\r\nthe rate of the prisoners of a lower class. \"They much reduced my usual\r\nfare,\" he says; \"I had, however, a good soup with fried bread crumbs, a\r\npassable piece of beef, a ragoût of sheep's tongue, and two custards for\r\ndessert. I was treated in pretty much the same manner the whole time I\r\nwas in this gloomy place; sometimes they gave me, after my soup, a wing\r\nor leg of fowl, sometimes they put two little patties on the edge of the\r\ndish.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of Louis XV.'s reign, Dumouriez eulogizes the cookery of\r\nthe Bastille in almost the same terms. On the day of his entrance,\r\nnoticing that they were serving a fish dinner, he asked for a fowl to be\r\ngot from a neighbouring eating-house. \"A fowl!\" said the major, \"don't\r\nyou know that to-day is Friday?\" \"Your business is to look after me and\r\nnot my conscience. I am an invalid, for the Bastille itself is a\r\ndisease,\" replied the prisoner. In an hour's time the fowl was on the\r\ntable. Subsequently he asked for his dinner and supper to be served at\r\nthe same time, between three and four o'clock. His valet, a good cook,\r\nused to make him stews. \"You fared very well at the Bastille; there\r\nwere always five dishes at dinner and three at supper, without the\r\ndessert, and the whole being put on the table at once, appeared\r\nmagnificent.\" There is a letter from the major of the Bastille addressed\r\nin 1764 to the lieutenant of police, discussing a prisoner named Vieilh,\r\nwho never ate butcher's meat; so they had to feed him exclusively on\r\ngame and poultry. Things were much the same under Louis XVI., as\r\nPoultier d'Elmotte testifies: \"De Launey, the governor, used to come and\r\nhave a friendly chat with me; he got them to consult my taste as regards\r\nfood, and to supply me with anything I wished for.\" The bookseller\r\nHardy, transferred in 1766 to the Bastille with the members of the\r\nBreton deputation, declares frankly that they were all treated in the\r\nbest possible way. Finally, Linguet himself, in spite of his desire to\r\npaint the lot of the victims of the Bastille in the most sombre colours,\r\nis obliged to confess that food was supplied in abundance. Every morning\r\nthe cook sent up to him a menu on which he marked the dishes he fancied.\r\n\r\nThe account books of the Bastille confirm the testimony of former\r\nprisoners. The following, according to these documents, are the meals\r\nthat La Bourdonnais enjoyed during July, 1750. Every day the menu\r\ncontains soup, beef, veal, beans, French beans, two eggs, bread,\r\nstrawberries, cherries, gooseberries, oranges, two bottles of red wine,\r\nand two bottles of beer. In addition to this regular bill of fare we\r\nnote on July 2, a fowl and a bottle of Muscat; on the 4th, a bottle of\r\nMuscat; on the 7th, tea; on the 12th, a bottle of brandy; on the 13th,\r\nsome flowers; on the 14th, some quails; on the 15th, a turkey; on the\r\n16th, a melon; on the 17th, a fowl; on the 18th, a young rabbit; on the\r\n19th, a bottle of brandy; on the 20th, a chicken and ham sausage and two\r\nmelons; and so on.\r\n\r\nTavernier was a prisoner of mean station, son of a doorkeeper of Paris\r\nde Montmartel. He was implicated in a plot against the King's life, and\r\nwas one of the seven prisoners set free on the 14th of July. He was\r\nfound out of his mind in his cell. After he had been led in triumph\r\nthrough the streets of Paris, he was shut up at Charenton. He was a\r\nmartyr, people exclaimed. He was certainly not so well off in his new\r\nabode as he had been at the Bastille. We have an account of what was\r\nsupplied to him at the Bastille in addition to the ordinary meals, in\r\nNovember, 1788, in March and May, 1789, three of the last months of his\r\nimprisonment. In November we find: tobacco, four bottles of brandy,\r\nsixty bottles of wine, thirty bottles of beer, two pounds of coffee,\r\nthree pounds of sugar, a turkey, oysters, chestnuts, apples, and pears;\r\nin March: tobacco, four bottles of brandy, forty-four bottles of wine,\r\nsixty bottles of beer, coffee, sugar, fowls, cheese; in May: tobacco,\r\nfour bottles of brandy, sixty-two bottles of wine, thirty-one bottles of\r\nbeer, pigeons, coffee, sugar, cheese, &c. We have the menus of the\r\nMarquis de Sade for January, 1789: chocolate cream, a fat chicken\r\nstuffed with chestnuts, pullets with truffles, potted ham, apricot\r\nmarmalade, &c.\r\n\r\nThe facts we are describing were the rule. The prisoners who were\r\ntreated with the least consideration fed very well. Only those who were\r\nsent down to the cells were sometimes put on bread and water, but that\r\nwas only a temporary punishment.\r\n\r\nWhen a complaint was formulated by any prisoner in regard to his food, a\r\nreprimand to the governor soon followed. Then the lieutenant of police\r\ninquired of the person concerned if he was better treated than formerly.\r\n\"His Majesty tells me,\" writes Pontchartrain to De Launey, \"that\r\ncomplaints have been raised about the bad food of the prisoners; he\r\ninstructs me to write to you to give the matter great attention.\" And\r\nSartine wrote jokingly to Major de Losmes: \"I am quite willing for you\r\nto get the clothes of Sieur Dubois enlarged, and I hope all your\r\nprisoners may enjoy as excellent health.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, the king clothed those of the prisoners who were too poor to\r\nbuy their own clothes. He did not give them a prison uniform, but\r\ndressing-gowns padded or lined with rabbit skin, breeches of coloured\r\nstuff, vests lined with silk plush and fancy coats.[36] The commissary\r\nat the Bastille appointed to look after the supplies took the prisoners'\r\nmeasure, and inquired about their tastes, and the colours and styles\r\nthat suited them best. A lady prisoner named Sauvé asked to have made\r\nfor her a dress of white silk, dotted with green flowers. The wife of\r\ncommissary Rochebrune spent several days in going the round of the Paris\r\nshops, and then wrote in despair that no dressmaker had such a material,\r\nthe nearest approach to it being a white silk with green stripes: if\r\nMadame Sauvé would be satisfied with that, they would send to take her\r\nmeasure. \"Monsieur le major,\" writes a prisoner named Hugonnet, \"the\r\nshirts they brought me yesterday are not a bit what I asked for, for I\r\nremember having written 'fine, and with embroidered ruffles'; instead of\r\nwhich these things are coarse, made of wretched linen, and with ruffles\r\nat best only fit for a turnkey; and so I shall be glad if you will send\r\nthem back to the commissary; and let him keep them, for I declare I\r\nwon't have them.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor also saw that the prisoners had some means of diversion.\r\nThe poorest he provided with pocket-money and tobacco.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the seventeenth century, a Neapolitan named\r\nVinache died at the Bastille, after founding a library there for the use\r\nof his fellow-prisoners. This library was gradually augmented by\r\ndonations from the governors, by gifts from various prisoners, and even\r\nby the generosity of a citizen of Paris whose compassion had been\r\nexcited for the lot of the prisoners. The books consisted of romances,\r\nworks of science and philosophy, and religious books, light literature\r\npredominating. The lieutenant of police, Berryer, struck out of the\r\nlist of books that were being sent one day to the binder a \"poem on the\r\ngreatness of God,\" as being on \"too melancholy a subject for prisoners.\"\r\nThe prisoners also procured books from outside. We have mentioned the\r\nComte de Belle-Isle, who had more than three hundred books and atlases\r\nat the Bastille. La Beaumelle collected a library of more than 600\r\nvolumes. The administration, moreover, never refused to get for the\r\nprisoners, out of the royal funds and sometimes at considerable expense,\r\nsuch works as they said were necessary to their studies. The works of\r\nVoltaire and Puffendorf were readily placed in their hands. Finally,\r\nunder Louis XVI., they were allowed to read the gazettes.\r\n\r\nAfter the permission to have books and to write, the most coveted favour\r\nwas that of walking exercise. Refusal of this was rare. The prisoners\r\nmight walk, either on the towers of the Bastille, or in the inner\r\ncourts, or lastly along the bastion, which was transformed into a\r\ngarden. To fresh invigorating air the platform of the towers added the\r\nattraction of the finest view. Fontaine relates that Sacy went to the\r\ntop of the towers every day after dinner. He there walked about in\r\ncompany with the officers, who gave him news of the town and the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIn their rooms the prisoners amused themselves with feeding cats and\r\nbirds and animals of all kinds: they taught dogs tricks. Some were\r\nallowed to have a violin or a clavecin. Pellisson was shut up with a\r\nBasque who used to play to him on the musette. The Duke de Richelieu\r\nboasts of the operatic airs he sang in parts with his neighbours in the\r\nBastille, Mdlle. de Launay among them, with her head at the bars of her\r\nwindow; \"we got up choruses of a sort, with fine effect.\"\r\n\r\nOther prisoners killed time with embroidery, weaving or knitting; some\r\nmade ornaments for the chapel of the château. Some devoted themselves to\r\ncarpentry, turned wood, made small articles of furniture. Artists\r\npainted and sketched. \"The occupation of M. de Villeroi was somewhat\r\nsingular: he had very fine clothes, which he was for ever unpicking and\r\nsewing together again with much cleverness.\" The prisoners who lived\r\nseveral in one room played at cards, chess, and backgammon. In 1788, at\r\nthe time of the troubles in Brittany, a dozen noblemen of that country\r\nwere shut up in the Bastille. They lived together, and asked for a\r\nbilliard table to amuse themselves; the table was set up in the\r\napartments of the major, and there these gentlemen went for their games.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners who died in the Bastille were interred in the graveyard of\r\nSt. Paul's; the funeral service was held in the church of St. Paul, and\r\nthe burial certificate, bearing the family name of the deceased, was\r\ndrawn up in the vestry. It is not true that the names of the deceased\r\nwere wrongly stated in the register in order that their identity might\r\nbe concealed from the public. The Man in the Iron Mask was inscribed on\r\nthe register of St. Paul's under his real name. Jews, Protestants, and\r\nsuicides were buried in the garden of the château, the prejudices of the\r\nperiod not allowing their remains to be laid in consecrated ground.\r\n\r\nThose who were liberated had a happier fate. Their dismissal was ordered\r\nby a _lettre de cachet_, as their incarceration had been. These orders\r\nfor their liberation, so anxiously expected, were brought by the court\r\n\"distributors of packets\" or by the ordinary post; sometimes relatives\r\nand friends themselves brought the sealed envelope, in order to have the\r\njoy of taking away at once those whose deliverance they came to effect.\r\n\r\nThe governor, or, in his absence, the king's lieutenant, came into the\r\nprisoner's chamber and announced that he was free. The papers and other\r\neffects which had been taken from him on entrance were restored to him,\r\nthe major getting a receipt for them; then he signed a promise to reveal\r\nnothing of what he had seen at the château. Many of the prisoners\r\nrefused to submit to this formality, and were liberated notwithstanding;\r\nothers, after having signed, retailed everywhere all they knew about the\r\nprison, and were not interfered with. When the prisoner only recovered\r\nhis freedom under certain conditions, he was required to give an\r\nundertaking to submit to the king's pleasure.\r\n\r\nAll these formalities having been completed, the governor, with that\r\nfeeling for good form which characterized the men of the _ancien\r\nrégime_, had the man who had been his guest served for the last time\r\nwith an excellent dinner. If the prisoner was a man of good society,\r\nthe governor would even go so far as to invite him to his own table, and\r\nthen, the meal over and the good-byes said, he placed his own carriage\r\nat the prisoner's disposal, and often entered it himself to accompany\r\nhim to his destination.\r\n\r\nMore than one prisoner thus restored to the world must have felt greatly\r\nembarrassed before a day was past, and have been at a loss what to do or\r\nwhere to go. The administration of the Bastille sometimes gave money to\r\none and another to enable them to get along for a time. In December,\r\n1783, a certain Dubu de la Tagnerette, after being set at liberty, was\r\nlodged in the governor's house for a fortnight until he had found\r\napartments that would suit him. Moreover, many of the prisoners were\r\nactually annoyed at being dismissed: we could cite examples of persons\r\nwho sought to get themselves sent to the Bastille; others refused to\r\naccept their liberty, and others did their best to get their detention\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\n\"Many come out,\" says Renneville, \"very sad at having to leave.\" Le\r\nMaistre de Sacy and Fontaine affirm that the years spent at the Bastille\r\nwere the best years in their lives. \"The innocent life we lived,\" says\r\nRenneville again, \"Messieurs Hamilton, Schrader, and myself, seemed so\r\npleasant to M. Hamilton that he begged me to write a description of it\r\nin verse.\" The _Memoirs_ of Madame de Staal represent her years at the\r\nBastille as the happiest she ever knew. \"In my heart of hearts, I was\r\nvery far from desiring my liberty.\" \"I stayed at the Bastille for six\r\nweeks,\" observes the Abbé Morellet, \"which sped away--I chuckle still as\r\nI think of them--very pleasantly for me.\" And later, Dumouriez declares\r\nthat at the Bastille he was happy and never felt dull.\r\n\r\nSuch was the rule of the celebrated state prison. In the last century\r\nthere was no place of detention in Europe where the prisoners were\r\nsurrounded with so many comforts and attentions: there is no such place\r\nin these days.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these very real alleviations, it would be absurd to\r\npretend that the prisoners were in general reconciled to their\r\nincarceration. Nothing is a consolation for the loss of liberty. How\r\nmany poor wretches, in their despair, have dashed their heads against\r\nthe thick walls while wife and children and concerns of the utmost\r\ngravity were summoning them from without! The Bastille was the cause of\r\nruin to many; within its walls were shed tears which were never dried.\r\n\r\nAn eighteenth-century writer thus defined the state prison: \"A bastille\r\nis any house solidly built, hermetically sealed, and diligently guarded,\r\nwhere any person, of whatever rank, age, or sex, may enter without\r\nknowing why, remain without knowing how long, hoping to leave it, but\r\nnot knowing how.\" These lines, written by an apologist for the old state\r\nprison, contain its condemnation, without appeal, before the modern\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN IN THE IRON MASK.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two centuries no question has excited public opinion more than that\r\nof the Man in the Iron Mask. The books written on the subject would fill\r\na library. People despaired of ever lifting the veil. \"The story of the\r\nIron Mask,\" says Michelet, \"will probably remain for ever obscure,\" and\r\nHenri Martin adds: \"History has no right to pronounce judgment on what\r\nwill never leave the domain of conjecture.\" To-day, the doubt no longer\r\nexists. The problem is solved. Before disclosing the solution which\r\ncriticism has unanimously declared correct, we propose to transcribe the\r\nscanty authentic documents that we possess on the masked man, and then\r\nto state the principal solutions which have been proposed, before\r\narriving at the true solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\n_The Register of the Bastille._--To begin with, let us quote the text\r\nwhich is the origin and foundation of all the works published on the\r\nquestion of the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Note in Du Junca's Journal regarding the entrance to the\r\nBastille (September 18, 1698) of the Man in the Iron Mask.]\r\n\r\nEtienne du Junca, king's lieutenant at the Bastille, in a journal\r\nwhich he began to keep on October 2, 1690, when he entered upon his\r\noffice--a sort of register in which he recorded day by day the details\r\nconcerning the arrival of the prisoners--writes, under date September\r\n18, 1698, these lines,[37] which the popular legend has rendered\r\nmemorable:--\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, September 18 (1698), at three o'clock in the afternoon, M. de\r\nSaint-Mars, governor of the château of the Bastille, made his first\r\nappearance, coming from his governorship of the Isles of\r\nSainte-Marguerite-Honorat, bringing with him, in his conveyance, a\r\nprisoner he had formerly at Pignerol, whom he caused to be always\r\nmasked, whose name is not mentioned; directly he got out of the carriage\r\nhe put him in the first room of the Bazinière tower, waiting till night\r\nfor me to take him, at nine o'clock, and put him with M. de Rosarges,\r\none of the sergeants brought by the governor, alone in the third room of\r\nthe Bertaudière tower, which I had had furnished with all necessaries\r\nsome days before his arrival, having received orders to that effect from\r\nM. de Saint-Mars: the which prisoner will be looked after and waited on\r\nby M. de Rosarges, and maintained by the governor.\"\r\n\r\nIn a second register, supplementary to the first, in which du Junca\r\nrecords details of the liberation or the death of the prisoners, we\r\nread, under date November 19, 1703:--\r\n\r\n\"On the same day, November 19, 1703, the unknown prisoner, always masked\r\nwith a mask of black velvet, whom M. de Saint-Mars, the governor,\r\nbrought with him on coming from the Isles de Sainte-Marguerite, whom he\r\nhad kept for a long time, the which happening to be a little ill\r\nyesterday on coming from mass, he died to-day, about ten o'clock at\r\nnight, without having had a serious illness; it could not have been\r\nslighter. M. Giraut, our chaplain, confessed him yesterday, is surprised\r\nat his death. He did not receive the sacrament, and our chaplain\r\nexhorted him a moment before he died. And this unknown prisoner, kept\r\nhere for so long, was buried on Tuesday at four o'clock p.m., November\r\n20, in the graveyard of St. Paul, our parish; on the register of burial\r\nhe was given a name also unknown. M. de Rosarges, major, and Arreil,\r\nsurgeon, signed the register.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the margin:--\r\n\r\n\"I have since learnt that they called him M. de Marchiel on the\r\nregister, and that forty livres was the cost of the funeral.\"\r\n\r\nThe registers of du Junca were preserved among the ancient archives of\r\nthe Bastille, whence they passed to the Arsenal library, where they are\r\nnow kept. They are drawn up in the clumsy handwriting of a soldier, with\r\nlittle skill in penmanship. The spelling is bad. But the facts are\r\nstated with precision, and have always proved accurate when checked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Notice in Du Junca's Journal of the death of the masked\r\nprisoner in the Bastille (November 19, 1703).]\r\n\r\nThe extract from the second register shows that the mysterious\r\nprisoner wore, not a mask of iron, but one of black velvet.\r\n\r\nFurther, the entry on the register of St. Paul's church has been\r\ndiscovered. It reads:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 19th, Marchioly, aged 45 years or thereabouts, died in the\r\nBastille, whose body was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul, his\r\nparish, the 20th of the present month, in the presence of M. Rosage\r\n(_sic_), major of the Bastille, and of M. Reglhe (_sic_), surgeon major\r\nof the Bastille, who signed.--(Signed) ROSARGES, REILHE.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the fundamental documents for the story of the Iron Mask; we\r\nshall see by and by that they are sufficient to establish the truth.\r\n\r\n_The Letter of the Governor of Sainte-Marguerite._--We have just seen,\r\nfrom the register of du Junca, that the masked man had been at the Isles\r\nof Sainte-Marguerite under the charge of Saint-Mars, who, on being\r\nappointed governor of the Bastille, had brought the prisoner with him.\r\nIn the correspondence exchanged between Saint-Mars and the minister\r\nBarbezieux, occurs the following letter, dated January 6, 1696, in which\r\nSaint-Mars describes his method of dealing with the prisoners, and the\r\nmasked man is referred to under the appellation \"my ancient prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n     \"MY LORD,--You command me to tell you what is the practice, when I\r\n     am absent or ill, as to the visits made and precautions taken daily\r\n     in regard to the prisoners committed to my charge. My two\r\n     lieutenants serve the meals at the regular hours, just as they\r\n     have seen me do, and as I still do very often when I am well. The\r\n     first of my lieutenants, who takes the keys of the prison of _my\r\n     ancient prisoner_, with whom we commence, opens the three doors and\r\n     enters the chamber of the prisoner, who politely hands him the\r\n     plates and dishes, put one on top of another, to give them into the\r\n     hands of the lieutenant, who has only to go through two doors to\r\n     hand them to one of my sergeants, who takes them and places them on\r\n     a table two steps away, where is the second lieutenant, who\r\n     examines everything that enters and leaves the prison, and sees\r\n     that there is nothing written on the plate; and after they have\r\n     given him the utensil, they examine his bed inside and out, and\r\n     then the gratings and windows of his room, and very often the man\r\n     himself: after having asked him very politely if he wants anything\r\n     else, they lock the doors and proceed to similar business with the\r\n     other prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n_The Letter of M. de Palteau._--On June 19, 1768, M. de Formanoir de\r\nPalteau addressed from the château of Palteau, near Villeneuve-le-Roi,\r\nto the celebrated Fréron, editor of the _Année Littéraire_, a letter\r\nwhich was inserted in the number for June 30, 1768. The author of this\r\nletter was the grand-nephew of Saint-Mars. At the time when the latter\r\nwas appointed governor of the Bastille, the château of Palteau belonged\r\nto him, and he halted there with his prisoner on the way from the Isles\r\nof Sainte-Marguerite to Paris.\r\n\r\n\"In 1698,\" writes M. de Palteau, \"M. de Saint-Mars passed from the\r\ngovernorship of the Isles of Sainte-Marguerite to that of the Bastille.\r\nOn his way to take up his duties, he stayed with his prisoner on his\r\nestate at Palteau. The masked man arrived in a conveyance which preceded\r\nthat of M. de Saint-Mars; they were accompanied by several horsemen. The\r\npeasants went to meet their lord: M. de Saint-Mars ate with his\r\nprisoner, who had his back turned to the windows of the dining-hall\r\nlooking on the courtyard. The peasants whom I have questioned could not\r\nsee whether he ate with his mask on; but they observed very well that M.\r\nde Saint-Mars, who was opposite him at table, had two pistols beside his\r\nplate. They had only one footman to wait on them, and he fetched the\r\ndishes from an ante-room where they were brought him, carefully shutting\r\nthe door of the dining-hall behind him. When the prisoner crossed the\r\ncourtyard, he always had his black mask over his face; the peasants\r\nnoticed that his lips and teeth were not covered, that he was tall and\r\nhad white hair. M. de Saint-Mars slept in a bed that was put up for him\r\nnear that of the masked man.\"\r\n\r\nThis account is marked throughout with the stamp of truth. M. de\r\nPalteau, the writer, makes no attempt to draw inferences from it. He\r\ndeclares for none of the hypotheses then under discussion in regard to\r\nthe identity of the mysterious unknown. He is content to report the\r\ntestimony of those of his peasants who saw the masked man when he passed\r\nthrough their lord's estates. The only detail in the story which we are\r\nable to check--a characteristic detail, it is true--is that of the black\r\nmask of which M. de Palteau speaks: it corresponds exactly to the mask\r\nof black velvet mentioned in du Junca's register.\r\n\r\nThe château of Palteau is still in existence. In his work on\r\nSuperintendent Fouquet, M. Jules Lair gives a description of it. \"The\r\nchâteau of Palteau, situated on an eminence among woods and vines,\r\npresented at that time, as it does to-day, the aspect of a great lordly\r\nmansion in the style of the time of Henri IV. and Louis XIII. First\r\nthere is a wide courtyard, then two wings; within, the principal\r\nbuilding and the chapel. The lower story is supported on arches, and its\r\nlofty windows go right up into the roof, and light the place from floor\r\nto attic.\" Since the eighteenth century, however, the château has\r\nundergone some modifications. The room in which Saint-Mars dined with\r\nhis prisoner is now used as a kitchen.\r\n\r\n_The Notes of Major Chevalier._--In addition to the entries in du\r\nJunca's Journal which we have transcribed, scholars are accustomed to\r\ninvoke, as equally worthy of credence though later in date, the\r\ntestimony of Father Griffet, chaplain of the Bastille, and that of Major\r\nChevalier.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from du Junca quoted above were published for the first\r\ntime in 1769 by Father Griffet, who added the following comments: \"The\r\nmemory of the masked prisoner was still preserved among the officers,\r\nsoldiers, and servants of the Bastille, when M. de Launey, who has long\r\nbeen the governor, came to occupy a place on the staff of the garrison.\r\nThose who had seen him with his mask, when he crossed the courtyard on\r\nhis way to attend mass, said that after his death the order was given to\r\nburn everything he had used, such as linen, clothes, cushions,\r\ncounterpanes, &c.: that the very walls of the room he had occupied had\r\nto be scraped and whitewashed again, and that all the tiles of the\r\nflooring were taken up and replaced by others, because they were so\r\nafraid that he had found the means to conceal some notes or some mark,\r\nthe discovery of which would have revealed his name.\"\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Father Griffet happens to be confirmed by some notes\r\nfrom the pen of a major of the Bastille named Chevalier. The major was\r\nnot a personage of the highest rank in the administration of the\r\nBastille, since above him were the governor and the king's lieutenant:\r\nbut he was the most important personage. The whole internal\r\nadministration, so far as the prisoners were concerned, was entrusted to\r\nhim. Chevalier fulfilled these duties for nearly thirty-eight years,\r\nfrom 1749 to 1787. M. Fernand Bournon's estimate of him is as follows:\r\n\"Chevalier is a type of the devoted hard-working official who has no\r\nambition to rise above a rather subordinate rank. It would be impossible\r\nto say how much the administration of the Bastille owed to his zeal and\r\nto his perfect familiarity with a service of extraordinary difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nAmong notes put together with a view to a history of the Bastille,\r\nChevalier gives in condensed form the information furnished by du\r\nJunca's register, and adds: \"This is the famous masked man whom no one\r\nhas ever known. He was treated with great distinction by the governor,\r\nand was seen only by M. de Rosarges, major of the said château, who had\r\nsole charge of him; he was not ill except for a few hours, and died\r\nrather suddenly: interred at St. Paul's, on Tuesday, November 20, 1703,\r\nat 4 o'clock p.m., under the name of Marchiergues. He was buried in a\r\nnew white shroud, given by the governor, and practically everything in\r\nhis room was burnt, such as his bed, chairs, tables, and other bits of\r\nfurniture, or else melted down, and the whole was thrown into the\r\nprivies.\"\r\n\r\nThese notes of Father Griffet and Major Chevalier have derived great\r\nforce, in the eyes of historians, from their exact agreement; but a\r\nclose examination shows that the testimony of Chevalier was the source\r\nof Father Griffet's information; in fact, Chevalier was major of the\r\nBastille when the Jesuit compiled his work, and it is doubtless upon his\r\nauthority that the latter depended.\r\n\r\nDocuments recently published in the _Revue Bleue_ upset these\r\nassertions, which appeared to be based on the firmest foundations.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal of du Junca, which we have already mentioned, we read\r\nunder date April 30, 1701: \"Sunday, April 30, about 9 o'clock in the\r\nevening, M. Aumont the younger came, bringing and handing over to us a\r\nprisoner named M. Maranville, alias Ricarville, who was an officer in\r\nthe army, a malcontent, too free with his tongue, a worthless fellow:\r\nwhom I received in obedience to the king's orders sent through the Count\r\nof Pontchartrain: whom I have had put along with the man Tirmon, in the\r\nsecond room of the Bertaudière tower, with the _ancient prisoner_, both\r\nbeing well locked in.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"ancient prisoner\" here referred to is no other than the masked man.\r\nWhen he entered the Bastille, as we have seen, on September 18, 1698, he\r\nwas placed in the third room of the Bertaudière tower. In 1701, the\r\nBastille happened to be crowded with prisoners, and they had to put\r\nseveral together in one and the same room; so the man in the mask was\r\nplaced with two companions. One of them, Jean-Alexandre de Ricarville,\r\nalso called Maranville, had been denounced as a \"retailer of ill speech\r\nagainst the State, finding fault with the policy of France and lauding\r\nthat of foreigners, especially that of the Dutch.\" The police reports\r\ndepict him as a beggarly fellow, poorly dressed, and about sixty years\r\nold. He had formerly been, as du Junca says, an officer in the royal\r\ntroops. Maranville left the Bastille on October 19, 1708. He was\r\ntransferred to Charenton, where he died in February, 1709. It must be\r\npointed out that Charenton was then an \"open\" prison, where the\r\nprisoners associated with one another and had numerous relations with\r\nthe outside world.\r\n\r\nThe second of the fellow-prisoners of the man in the mask,\r\nDominique-François Tirmont, was a servant. When he was placed in the\r\nBastille, on July 30, 1700, he was nineteen years old. He was accused of\r\nsorcery and of debauching young girls. He was put in the second room of\r\nthe Bertaudière tower, where he was joined by Maranville and the man in\r\nthe mask. On December 14, 1701, he was transferred to Bicêtre. He lost\r\nhis reason in 1703 and died in 1708.\r\n\r\nThe man in the mask was taken out of the third room of the Bertaudière\r\ntower, in which he had been placed on his entrance to the Bastille, on\r\nMarch 6, 1701, in order to make room for a woman named Anne Randon, a\r\n\"witch and fortune-teller,\" who was shut up alone in it. The masked\r\nprisoner was then placed in the \"second Bertaudière\" with Tirmont, who\r\nhad been there, as we have just seen, since July 30, 1700. Maranville\r\njoined them on April 30, 1701. Not long after, the masked man was\r\ntransferred to another room, with or without Maranville. Tirmont had\r\nbeen taken to Bicêtre in 1701. We find that on February 26, 1703, the\r\nAbbé Gonzel, a priest of Franche-Comté, accused of being a spy, was shut\r\nup alone in the \"second Bertaudière.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts are of undeniable authenticity, and one sees at a glance the\r\nconsequences springing from them. At the time when the masked prisoner\r\nshared the same room with fellow-captives, other prisoners at the\r\nBastille were kept rigorously isolated, in spite of the crowded state of\r\nthe prison, so much more important did the reasons for their\r\nincarceration seem! The man in the mask was associated with persons of\r\nthe lowest class, who were soon afterwards to leave and take their\r\nplaces with the ruck of prisoners at Charenton and Bicêtre. We read in a\r\nreport of D'Argenson that there was even some talk of enlisting one of\r\nthem, Tirmont, in the army. Such, then, was this strange personage, the\r\nrepository of a terrible secret of which Madame Palatine[38] was already\r\nspeaking in mysterious terms, the man who puzzled kings, Louis XV.,\r\nLouis XVI., who puzzled the very officers of the Bastille, and caused\r\nthem to write stories as remote as possible from the reality!\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE LEGEND.\r\n\r\nIf the very officers of the Bastille indulged such wild freaks of\r\nimagination, what flights into dreamland might not the thoughts of the\r\npublic be expected to take? The movement is a very curious one to\r\nfollow. To begin with, we have the light Venetian mask transforming\r\nitself into an iron mask with steel articulations which the prisoner\r\nwas never without. The consideration--imaginary, as we have seen--with\r\nwhich the prisoner is supposed to have been treated, and which is\r\nreferred to in the notes of Major Chevalier, becomes transformed into\r\nmarks of a boundless deference shown by the jailers towards their\r\ncaptive. The story was that Saint-Mars, the governor, a knight of St.\r\nLouis, never spoke to the prisoner except standing, with bared head,\r\nthat he served him at table with his own hands and on silver plate, and\r\nthat he supplied him with the most luxurious raiment his fancy could\r\ndevise. Chevalier says that after his death his room at the Bastille was\r\ndone up like new, to prevent his successor from discovering any\r\ntell-tale evidence in some corner. Speaking of the time when the masked\r\nman was at the Isles of Sainte-Marguerite, Voltaire relates: \"One day\r\nthe prisoner wrote with a knife on a silver dish, and threw the dish out\r\nof the window towards a boat moored on the shore, almost at the foot of\r\nthe tower. A fisherman, to whom the boat belonged, picked up the dish\r\nand carried it to the governor. Astonished, he asked the fisherman,\r\n'Have you read what is written on this dish, and has anyone seen it in\r\nyour hands?' 'I cannot read,' replied the fisher, 'I have only just\r\nfound it, and no one has seen it.' The poor man was detained until the\r\ngovernor was assured he could not read and that no one had seen the\r\ndish. 'Go,' he said, 'it is lucky for you that you can't read!'\"\r\n\r\nIn Father Papon's _History of Provence_, linen takes the place of the\r\ndish. The upshot is more tragic: \"I found in the citadel an officer of\r\nthe Free Company, aged 79 years. He told me several times that a barber\r\nof that company saw one day, under the prisoner's window, something\r\nwhite floating on the water; he went and picked it up and carried it to\r\nM. de Saint-Mars. It was a shirt of fine linen, folded with no apparent\r\ncare, and covered with the prisoner's writing. M. de Saint-Mars, after\r\nunfolding it and reading a few lines, asked the barber, with an air of\r\ngreat embarrassment, if he had not had the curiosity to read what was on\r\nit. The barber protested over and over again that he had read nothing;\r\nbut, two days after, he was found dead in his bed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the fact that Saint-Mars had had the body of the prisoner buried in\r\na white cloth struck the imagination, and was developed in its turn into\r\nan extraordinary taste on the part of the prisoner for linen of the\r\nfinest quality and for costly lace--all which was taken to prove that\r\nthe masked man was a son of Anne of Austria, who had a very special\r\nlove, it was declared, for valuable lace and fine linen.\r\n\r\n_A Brother of Louis XIV._--We are able to fix with precision, we\r\nbelieve, the origin of the legend which made the Iron Mask a brother of\r\nLouis XIV. Moreover, it was due to this suggestion, which was hinted at\r\nfrom the first, that the story of the prisoner made so great a noise.\r\nThe glory of it belongs to the most famous writer of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. With a boldness of imagination for which to-day he would be\r\nenvied by the cleverest journalistic inventor of sensational paragraphs,\r\nVoltaire started this monstrous hoax on its vigorous flight.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 there had just appeared a sort of romance entitled _Notes\r\ntowards the History of Persia_, which was attributed, not without some\r\nreason, to Madame de Vieux-Maisons. The book contained a story within a\r\nstory, in which the mysterious prisoner, who was beginning to be talked\r\nabout everywhere, was identified with the Duke de Vermandois, and to\r\nthis fact was due the sensation which the book caused. Voltaire\r\nimmediately saw how he could turn the circumstance to account. He had\r\nhimself at one time been confined in the Bastille, which was one reason\r\nfor speaking of it; but he did not dare put in circulation suddenly,\r\nwithout some preparation, the terrible story he had just conceived, and,\r\nwith a very delicate sensitiveness to public opinion, he contented\r\nhimself with printing the following paragraph in the first edition of\r\nhis _Age of Louis XIV._: \"A few months after the death of Mazarin there\r\noccurred an event which is unexampled in history, and, what is not less\r\nstrange, has been passed over in silence by all the historians. There\r\nwas sent with the utmost secrecy to the château of the Isle of\r\nSainte-Marguerite, in the Sea of Provence, an unknown prisoner, of more\r\nthan ordinary height, young, and with features of rare nobility and\r\nbeauty. On the way, this prisoner wore a mask the chinpiece of which was\r\nfitted with springs of steel, which allowed him to eat freely with the\r\nmask covering his face. The order had been given to kill him if he\r\nuncovered. He remained in the island until an officer in whom great\r\nconfidence was placed, named Saint-Mars, governor of Pignerol, having\r\nbeen made governor of the Bastille, came to the Isle of\r\nSainte-Marguerite to fetch him, and conducted him to the Bastille,\r\nalways masked. The Marquis de Louvois saw him in the island before his\r\nremoval, and remained standing while he spoke to him, with a\r\nconsideration savouring of respect.\" Voltaire, however, does not say who\r\nthis extraordinary prisoner was. He observed the impression produced on\r\nthe public by his story. Then he ventured more boldly, and in the first\r\nedition of his _Questions on the Encyclopædia_ insinuated that the\r\nmotive for covering the prisoner's face with a mask was fear lest some\r\ntoo striking likeness should be recognized. He still refrained from\r\ngiving his name, but already everyone was on tip-toe with the\r\nexpectation of startling news. At last, in the second edition of\r\n_Questions on the Encyclopædia_, Voltaire intrepidly added that the man\r\nin the mask was a uterine brother of Louis XIV., a son of Mazarin and\r\nAnne of Austria, and older than the king. We know what incomparable\r\nagitators of public opinion the Encyclopædists were.\r\n\r\nOnce hatched, the story was not long in producing a numerous progeny,\r\nwhich grew in their turn and became a monstrous brood.\r\n\r\nWe read in the _Memoirs_ of the Duke de Richelieu, compiled by his\r\nsecretary the Abbé Soulavie, that Mdlle. de Valois, the Regent's\r\ndaughter and at this date the mistress of Richelieu, consented, at the\r\ninstigation of the latter, to prostitute herself to her\r\nfather--tradition has it that the Regent was enamoured of his\r\ndaughter--in order to get sight of an account of the Iron Mask drawn up\r\nby Saint-Mars. According to this story, which the author of the\r\n_Memoirs_ prints in its entirety, Louis XIV. was born at noon, and at\r\nhalf-past eight in the evening, while the king was at supper, the queen\r\nwas brought to bed of a second son, who was put out of sight so as to\r\navoid subsequent dissensions in the state.\r\n\r\nThe Baron de Gleichen goes still farther. He is at the pains to prove\r\nthat it was the true heir to the throne who was put out of sight, to the\r\nprofit of a child of the queen and the cardinal. Having became masters\r\nof the situation at the death of the king, they substituted their son\r\nfor the Dauphin, the substitution being facilitated by a strong likeness\r\nbetween the children. One sees at a glance the consequences of this\r\ntheory, which nullifies the legitimacy of the last Bourbons.\r\n\r\nBut the career of imagination was not yet to be checked. The legend came\r\ninto full bloom under the first empire. Pamphlets then appeared in which\r\nthe version of Baron de Gleichen was revived. Louis XIV. had been only a\r\nbastard, the son of foreigners; the lawful heir had been imprisoned at\r\nthe Isles of Sainte-Marguerite, where he had married the daughter of one\r\nof his keepers. Of this marriage was born a child who, as soon as he was\r\nweaned, was sent to Corsica, and entrusted to a reliable person, as a\r\nchild coming of \"good stock,\" in Italian, _Buona-parte_. Of that child\r\nthe Emperor was the direct descendant. The right of Napoleon I. to the\r\nthrone of France established by the Iron Mask!--there is a discovery\r\nwhich the great Dumas missed. But, incredible as it seems, there were\r\nmen who actually took these fables seriously. In a Vendéan manifesto\r\ncirculated among the Chouans,[39] in Nivose of the year IX,[40] we read:\r\n\"It is not wise for the Royalist party to rely on the assurances given\r\nby some emissaries of Napoleon, that he seized the throne only to\r\nrestore the Bourbons; everything proves that he only awaits the general\r\npacification to declare himself, and that he means to base his right on\r\nthe birth of the children of the Iron Mask!\"\r\n\r\nWe shall not stay to refute the hypothesis which makes the Iron Mask a\r\nbrother of Louis XIV. Marius Topin has already done so in the clearest\r\npossible manner. The notion, moreover, has long been abandoned. The last\r\nwriters who adhered to it date from the revolutionary period.\r\n\r\n_The Successive Incarnations of the Iron Mask._--\"Never has an Indian\r\ndeity,\" says Paul de Saint-Victor, speaking of the Iron Mask, \"undergone\r\nso many metempsychoses and so many avatars.\" It would take too long\r\nmerely to enumerate all the individuals with whom it has been attempted\r\nto identify the Iron Mask: even women have not escaped. We shall cite\r\nrapidly the theories which have found most credence amongst the public,\r\nor those which have been defended in the most serious works, in order to\r\narrive finally at the identification--as will be seen, it is one of\r\nthose proposed long ago--which is beyond doubt the true one.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis which, after that of a brother of Louis XIV., has most\r\npowerfully excited public opinion, is that which made the mysterious\r\nunknown Louis, Comte de Vermandois, admiral of France, and son of the\r\ncharming Louise de la Vallière. This was indeed the belief of Father\r\nGriffet, chaplain of the Bastille, and even of the officers of the\r\nstaff. But the conjecture is disproved in a single line: \"The Comte de\r\nVermandois died at Courtrai, on November 18, 1683.\" A precisely similar\r\nfact refutes the theory identifying the Iron Mask with the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, the natural son of Charles II. and Lucy Walters. Monmouth\r\nperished on the scaffold in 1683. Lagrange-Chancel throws much ardour\r\nand talent into a defence of the theory which made the Iron Mask Francis\r\nof Vendôme, Duke de Beaufort, who, under the Fronde, was called \"King of\r\nthe Markets.\" The Duke de Beaufort died at the siege of Candia, June 25,\r\n1669.\r\n\r\nTo Lagrange-Chancel succeeds the Chevalier de Taulès. \"I have discovered\r\nthe Man in the Mask,\" he cries, \"and it is my duty to impart my\r\ndiscovery to Europe and posterity!\" This discovery brings forward one\r\nAvedick, an Armenian patriarch of Constantinople and Jerusalem,\r\nkidnapped in the East at the instigation of the Jesuits, and transported\r\nto France. Vergennes, on entering the ministry for foreign affairs, set\r\ninvestigations on foot. They confirmed the statement that Avedick had\r\nactually been arrested in the circumstances indicated, but after 1706;\r\nand so he could not be identified with the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nSuch were the theories of the eighteenth century. We come now to those\r\nof our own time. Since mystery and sinister machinations were involved,\r\nthe Jesuits could not be long left out of the business. We have just\r\nseen them at their tricks with the Armenian patriarch. People dreamt of\r\nan innocent youth thrown into a dungeon at their instigation for having\r\nwritten a couple of verses against them. But even this fancy was\r\ncompletely cast into the shade in a work published in 1885 under the\r\npseudonym of \"Ubalde,\" the author of which was unquestionably M. Anatole\r\nLoquin. This is his conclusion: \"The more I reflect, the more I believe\r\nI recognize in the Man in the Iron Mask, without any elaborate theory,\r\nwithout prejudice on my part, no other than J. B. Poquelin de Molière.\"\r\nThe Jesuits have got their revenge for _Tartufe_!\r\n\r\nLet us come now to the conjectures which have almost hit the truth and\r\nhave been defended by genuine scholars.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Fouquet is the solution of the bibliophile Jacob (Paul\r\nLacroix). M. Lair has shown that Fouquet died at Pignerol, of a sort of\r\napoplexy, on March 23, 1680, at the very moment when there was an idea\r\nat court of sending him to the waters at Bourbon, as a first step\r\ntowards his final liberation.\r\n\r\nFrançois Ravaisson, the learned and charming keeper of the Arsenal\r\nlibrary, whose work in classifying the archives of the Bastille we have\r\nhad the honour to continue, believed for a moment that the celebrated\r\nprisoner might have been the young Count de Kéroualze who had fought at\r\nCandia under the orders of Admiral de Beaufort. Ravaisson put forth his\r\ntheory with much hesitation, and as, in the sequel, he was himself led\r\nto abandon it, we need not dwell any longer upon it.\r\n\r\nM. Loiseleur, in the course of his brilliant controversy with Marius\r\nTopin, suggested \"an obscure spy arrested by Catinat in 1681,\" and his\r\nopponent refuted him in the most piquant manner by discovering Catinat\r\nin the very prisoner he was said to have arrested!\r\n\r\nGeneral Jung published a large volume in support of the claims of a\r\ncertain Oldendorf, a native of Lorraine, a spy and poisoner, arrested on\r\nMarch 29, 1673, in a trap laid for him at one of the passages of the\r\nSomme. The theory was refuted by M. Loiseleur. As M. Lair pointed out,\r\nGeneral Jung did not even succeed in proving that his nominee entered\r\nPignerol, an essential condition to his being the Man in the Mask.\r\n\r\nBaron Carutti urged the claims of a mad Jacobin, a prisoner at Pignerol\r\nwhose name remains unknown; but this Jacobin died at Pignerol towards\r\nthe close of 1693.'\r\n\r\nThe recent work of M. Emile Burgaud, written in collaboration with\r\nCommandant Bazeries, made a great sensation. He fixes on General Vivien\r\nLabbé de Bulonde, whom Louvois arrested for having shown dereliction of\r\na general's duty before Coni. M. Geoffroy de Grandmaison published in\r\nthe _Univers_ of January 9, 1895, two receipts signed by General de\r\nBulonde, one in 1699, when the masked man was in rigorous isolation at\r\nthe Bastille, the other in 1705, when he had been dead for two years.\r\n\r\nWe come at last to the hypothesis which is the most probable of\r\nall--after the true hypothesis, of course. Eustache Dauger, whom M. Lair\r\nidentifies with the masked prisoner, was a valet, who had been put into\r\njail at Pignerol on July 28, 1669. But it must be noted that the masked\r\nprisoner was kept guarded in rigorous secrecy in the early days of his\r\ndetention, as long as he was at Pignerol and the Isles of\r\nSainte-Marguerite. Now, when Dauger went to Pignerol, his case seemed of\r\nsuch slight importance that Saint-Mars thought of making him into a\r\nservant for the other prisoners, and in fact, in 1675, Louvois gave him\r\nas a valet to Fouquet, who for some time past had seen the rigour of his\r\nconfinement sensibly mitigated, receiving visits, walking freely in the\r\ncourts and purlieus of the fortress, Dauger accompanying him. Further,\r\nwe know that the masked man was transferred direct from Pignerol to the\r\nIsles of Sainte-Marguerite, whilst Dauger was transferred in 1681 to\r\nExiles, whence he only went to the Isles in 1687.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the correct solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MATTIOLI.\r\n\r\nTo Baron Heiss, once captain in the Alsace regiment, and one of the most\r\ndistinguished bibliophiles of his time, belongs the honour of being the\r\nfirst, in a letter dated from Phalsbourg, June 28, 1770, and published\r\nby the _Journal encyclopédique_, to identify the masked prisoner with\r\nCount Mattioli, secretary of state to the Duke of Mantua. After him,\r\nDutens, in 1783, in his _Intercepted Correspondence_; Baron de\r\nChambrier, in 1795, in a Memoir presented to the Academy of Berlin;\r\nRoux-Fazillac, member of the Legislative Assembly and the Convention, in\r\na remarkable work printed in 1801; then successively, Reth, Delort,\r\nEllis, Carlo Botta, Armand Baschet, Marius Topin, Paul de Saint-Victor,\r\nand M. Gallien, in a series of publications more or less important,\r\nendeavoured to prove that the Man in the Mask was the Duke of Mantua's\r\nsecretary of state. The scholars most intimate with the history of Louis\r\nXIV.'s government, Depping, Chéruel, Camille Rousset, have not hesitated\r\nto pronounce in favour of the same view; while against them,\r\nsinglehanded like his D'Artagnan, Alexandre Dumas resisted the efforts\r\nof twenty scholars, and the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_--giving a new lease\r\nof life to the legend about the brother of Louis XIV., put in\r\ncirculation by Voltaire, and reinforced by the Revolution--drove back\r\ninto their dust among the archives the documents which students had\r\nexhumed.\r\n\r\nWe have no longer to deal with so formidable an adversary, and we hope\r\nthat the following pages will not leave the shadow of a doubt.\r\n\r\nWe know how, under the influence of Louvois, the able and insinuating\r\npolicy directed first by Mazarin, then by Lionne, gave way to a military\r\ndiplomacy, blunt and aggressive. Louis XIV. was master of Pignerol,\r\nacquired in 1632. He was induced by Louvois to cast covetous glances at\r\nCasal. In possession of these two places, the French armies could not\r\nbut dominate Upper Italy, and hold the court of Turin directly at their\r\nmercy. The throne of Mantua was then occupied by a young duke, Charles\r\nIV. of Gonzago, frivolous, happy-go-lucky, dissipating his wealth at\r\nVenice in fêtes and pleasures. In 1677 he had pledged to the Jews the\r\ncrown revenues for several years. Charles IV. was also Marquis of\r\nMontferrat, of which Casal was the capital. Noting with watchful eye the\r\nfrivolity and financial straits of the young prince, the court of\r\nVersailles conceived the bold scheme of buying Casal for hard cash.\r\n\r\nAt this date, one of the principal personages in Mantua was Count\r\nHercules Antony Mattioli. He was born at Bologna on December 1, 1640, of\r\na distinguished family. A brilliant student, he had barely passed his\r\ntwentieth year when he was elected a professor at the University of\r\nBologna. Afterwards he established himself at Mantua, where Charles\r\nIII., whose confidence he had won, made him his secretary of state.\r\nCharles IV., continuing the favour of his father, not only maintained\r\nMattioli in his office as minister of state, but appointed him an\r\nhonorary senator, a dignity which was enhanced by the title of Count.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was employing at the capital of the Venetian republic a\r\nkeen-witted and enterprising ambassador, the Abbé d'Estrades. He saw\r\nthrough the ambitious and intriguing nature of Mattioli, and, towards\r\nthe end of 1677, succeeded in winning over his support for the designs\r\nof the French court on Casal.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1678, Louis XIV. with his own hand wrote expressing his\r\nthanks to Mattioli, who by-and-by came to Paris. On December 8, the\r\ncontract was signed, the Duke of Mantua receiving in exchange for Casal\r\n100,000 crowns. In a private audience, Louis XIV. presented Mattioli\r\nwith a costly diamond and paid him the sum of a hundred double louis.\r\n\r\nScarcely two months after Mattioli's journey to France, the courts of\r\nVienna, Madrid, Turin, and the Venetian Republic were simultaneously\r\ninformed of all that had taken place. In order to reap a double harvest\r\nof gold, Mattioli had cynically betrayed both his master Charles IV. and\r\nthe King of France. Like a thunderbolt there came to Versailles the news\r\nof the arrest of Baron d'Asfeld, the envoy appointed by Louis XIV. to\r\nexchange ratifications with Mattioli. The governor of Milan had caused\r\nhim to be seized and handed over to the Spaniards. The rage of Louis\r\nXIV. and of Louvois, who had urged the opening of negotiations, taken\r\nan active part in them, and begun preparations for the occupation of\r\nCasal, may well be imagined. The Abbé d'Estrades, not less irritated,\r\nconceived a scheme of the most daring kind, proposing to Versailles\r\nnothing less than the abduction of the Mantuan minister. But Louis XIV.\r\nwas determined to have no scandal. Catinat was charged with carrying out\r\nthe scheme in person. The Abbé d'Estrades, in his dealings with\r\nMattioli, feigned ignorance of the double game the Count was playing. He\r\nled him to believe, on the contrary, that the balance of the sums\r\npromised at Versailles was about to be paid. A meeting was fixed for May\r\n2, 1679. On that day d'Estrades and Mattioli got into a carriage, the\r\npassing of which was awaited by Catinat accompanied by some dozen men.\r\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon, Mattioli was in the fortress of\r\nPignerol, in the hands of jailer Saint-Mars. When we remember the rank\r\nheld by the Italian minister, we are confronted with one of the most\r\naudacious violations of international law of which history has preserved\r\na record.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1694, Mattioli was transferred to the Isles of\r\nSainte-Marguerite; we have seen that he entered the Bastille on\r\nSeptember 18, 1698, and died there on November 19, 1703.\r\n\r\nThe details that we possess of the imprisonment of Mattioli at Pignerol\r\nand afterwards at the Isles of Sainte-Marguerite show that he was at the\r\noutset treated with the consideration due to his rank and to the\r\nposition he occupied at the time of his arrest. Eventually the respect\r\nwhich the prisoner had at first inspired gradually diminished: as years\r\nwent on the attentions shown him grew less and less until the day when,\r\nat the Bastille, he was given a room in common with persons of the\r\nbasest class. On the other hand, the rigour of his confinement, so far\r\nas the secrecy in which he was kept was concerned, was more and more\r\nrelaxed; what it was material to conceal was the circumstances under\r\nwhich Mattioli had been arrested, and with the lapse of time this secret\r\ncontinually diminished in importance. As to the mask of black velvet\r\nwhich Mattioli had among his possessions when he was arrested, and which\r\nhe put on, without a doubt, only for the occasion, this in reality\r\nconstituted a relief to his captivity, for it permitted the prisoner to\r\nleave his room, while the other state prisoners were rigorously mewed up\r\nin theirs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt remains to prove that the masked prisoner was really Mattioli.\r\n\r\n1. In the despatch sent by Louis XIV. to the Abbé d'Estrades five days\r\nbefore the arrest, the king approves the scheme of his ambassador and\r\nauthorizes him to secure Mattioli, \"since you believe you can get him\r\ncarried off without the affair giving rise to any scandal.\" The prisoner\r\nis to be conducted to Pignerol, where \"instructions are being sent to\r\nreceive him and keep him there without anybody having knowledge of it.\"\r\nThe king's orders close with these words: \"You must see to it that no\r\none knows what becomes of this man.\" The capture effected, Catinat wrote\r\non his part to Louvois: \"It came off without any violence, and no one\r\nknows the name of the knave, not even the officers who helped to arrest\r\nhim.\" Finally, we have a very curious pamphlet entitled _La Prudenza\r\ntriomfante di Casale_, written in 1682, that is, little more than two\r\nyears after the event, and--this slight detail is of capital\r\nimportance--thirty years before there was any talk of the Man in the\r\nMask. In this we read: \"The secretary (Mattioli) was surrounded by ten\r\nor twelve horsemen, who seized him, disguised him, _masked_ him, and\r\nconducted him to Pignerol\"--a fact, moreover, confirmed by a tradition\r\nwhich in the eighteenth century was still rife in the district, where\r\nscholars succeeded in culling it.\r\n\r\nIs there any need to insist on the strength of the proofs afforded by\r\nthese three documents, taken in connection one with another?\r\n\r\n2. We know, from du Junca's register, that the masked man was shut up at\r\nPignerol under the charge of Saint-Mars. In 1681, Saint-Mars gave up the\r\ngovernorship of Pignerol for that of Exiles. We can determine with\r\nabsolute precision the number of prisoners Saint-Mars had then in his\r\nkeeping. It was exactly five. A dispatch from Louvois, dated June 9, is\r\nvery clear. In the first paragraph, he orders \"the two prisoners in the\r\nlower tower\" to be removed; in the second, he adds: \"The rest of the\r\nprisoners in your charge.\" Here there is a clear indication of the\r\n\"rest\": what follows settles the number: \"The Sieur du Chamoy has orders\r\nto pay two crowns a day for the board of these _three_ prisoners.\" This\r\naccount, as clear as arithmetic can make it, is further confirmed by the\r\nletter addressed by Saint-Mars to the Abbé d'Estrades on June 25, 1681,\r\nwhen he was setting out for Exiles: \"I received yesterday the warrant\r\nappointing me governor of Exiles: I am to keep charge of two jailbirds I\r\nhave here, who have no other name than 'the gentlemen of the lower\r\ntower'; Mattioli will remain here with two other prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, then, were five in number, and the masked man is to be\r\nfound, of necessity, among them. Now we know who these five were: (1) a\r\ncertain La Rivière, who died at the end of December, 1686; (2) a\r\nJacobin, out of his mind, who died at the end of 1693; (3) a certain\r\nDubreuil, who died at the Isles of Sainte-Marguerite about 1697. There\r\nremain Dauger and Mattioli. The Man in the Mask is, without possible\r\ndispute, the one or the other. We have explained above the reasons which\r\nlead us to discard Dauger. The mysterious prisoner, then, was Mattioli.\r\nThe proof is mathematically exact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Burial certificate of the masked prisoner (November 20, 1703),\r\n     reproduced from the facsimile in the sixth edition of _The Man in\r\n     the Iron Mask_, by Marius Topin, 1883. The original, in the city\r\n     archives of Paris, was destroyed in the conflagration of 1871.\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. Opposite this page will be found a facsimile reproduction of the\r\ndeath certificate of the masked prisoner as inscribed on the registers\r\nof the church of St. Paul. It is the very name of the Duke of Mantua's\r\nformer secretary that is traced there: \"Marchioly.\" It must be\r\nremembered that \"Marchioly\" would be pronounced in Italian \"Markioly,\"\r\nand that Saint-Mars, governor of the Bastille, who furnished the\r\ninformation on which the certificate was drawn up, almost always wrote\r\nin his correspondence--a characteristic detail--not \"Mattioli,\" but\r\n\"Martioly\": that is the very name on the register, less distorted than\r\nthe name of the major of the Bastille, who was called \"Rosarges,\" and\r\nnot \"Rosage,\" as given on the register; and the name of the surgeon, who\r\nwas called \"Reilhe,\" and not \"Reglhe.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been shown above how, as time went on, the rigorous seclusion to\r\nwhich the masked prisoner had been condemned was relaxed. What it had\r\nbeen thought necessary to conceal was the manner in which Mattioli had\r\nbeen captured, and with time that secret itself had lost its importance.\r\nAs the Duke of Mantua had declared himself very well pleased with the\r\narrest of the minister by whom he, no less than Louis XIV., had been\r\ndeceived, there was nothing to prevent the name from being inscribed on\r\na register of death, where, moreover, no one would ever have thought of\r\nlooking for it.\r\n\r\nLet us add that, in consequence of error or carelessness on the part of\r\nthe officer who supplied the information for the register, or perhaps on\r\nthe part of the parson or beadle who wrote it, the age is stated\r\nincorrectly, \"forty-five years or thereabouts,\" while Mattioli was\r\nsixty-three when he died. However, the register was filled up without\r\nthe least care, as a formality of no importance.\r\n\r\n4. The Duke de Choiseul pressed Louis XV. to reveal to him the clue to\r\nthe enigma. The king escaped with an evasion. One day, however, he said\r\nto him: \"If you knew all about it, you would see that it has very little\r\ninterest;\" and some time after, when Madame de Pompadour, at de\r\nChoiseul's instigation, pressed the king on the subject, he told her\r\nthat the prisoner was \"the minister of an Italian prince.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Memoirs of the Private Life of Marie Antoinette_ by her\r\nprincipal lady in waiting, Madame de Campan, we read that the queen\r\ntormented Louis XVI., who did not know the secret, to have a search made\r\namong the papers of the various ministries. \"I was with the queen,\" says\r\nMadame de Campan, \"when the king, having finished his researches, told\r\nher that he had found nothing in the secret papers which had any bearing\r\non the existence of this prisoner; that he had spoken on the subject to\r\nM. de Maurepas, whose age brought him nearer the time when the whole\r\nstory must have been known to the ministers (Maurepas had been minister\r\nof the king's household as a very young man, in the early years of the\r\neighteenth century, having the department of the _lettres de cachet_),\r\nand that M. de Maurepas had assured him that the prisoner was simply a\r\nman of a very dangerous character through his intriguing spirit, and a\r\nsubject of the Duke of Mantua. He was lured to the frontier, arrested,\r\nand kept a prisoner, at first at Pignerol, then at the Bastille.\"\r\n\r\nThese two pieces of evidence are of such weight that they alone would\r\nbe sufficient to fix the truth. When they were written, there was no\r\ntalk of Mattioli, of whose very name Madame de Campan was ignorant.\r\nSupposing that Madame de Campan had amused herself by inventing a\r\nfable--an absurd and improbable supposition, for what reason could she\r\nhave had for so doing?--it is impossible to admit that her imagination\r\ncould have hit upon fancies so absolutely in accord with facts.[41]\r\n\r\nAnd so the problem is solved. The legend, which had reared itself even\r\nas high as the throne of France, topples down. The satisfaction of the\r\nhistorian springs from his reflection that all serious historical works\r\nfor more than a century, resting on far-reaching researches and\r\neschewing all preoccupations foreign to science--such, for example, as\r\nthe desire of attaining a result different from the solutions proposed\r\nby one's predecessors--have arrived at the same conclusion, which proves\r\nto be the correct solution. Heiss, Baron de Chambrier, Reth,\r\nRoux-Fazillac, Delort, Carlo Botta, Armand Baschet, Marius Topin, Paul\r\nde Saint-Victor, Camille Rousset, Chéruel, Depping, have not hesitated\r\nto place under the famous mask of black velvet the features of\r\nMattioli. But at each new effort made by science, legend throws itself\r\nonce more into the fray, gaining new activity from the passions produced\r\nby the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe truth, in history, sometimes suggests to our mind's eye those white\r\nor yellow flowers which float on the water among broad flat leaves; a\r\nbreeze springs up, a wave rises and submerges them, they disappear; but\r\nonly for a moment: then they come to the surface again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMEN OF LETTERS IN THE BASTILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of men of letters in France under the _ancien régime_, Michelet\r\ncalls them \"the martyrs of thought\"; he adds: \"The world thinks, France\r\nspeaks. And that is precisely why the Bastille of France, the Bastille\r\nof Paris--I would rather say, the prison-house of thought--was, among\r\nall bastilles, execrable, infamous, and accursed.\" In the course of the\r\narticle devoted to the Bastille in the _Grande Encyclopédie_, M. Fernand\r\nBournon writes: \"After Louis XIV. and throughout the eighteenth century,\r\nthe Bastille was especially employed to repress, though it could not\r\nstifle, that generous and majestic movement (the glory of the human\r\nspirit) towards ideas of emancipation and enfranchisement; it was the\r\nepoch when philosophers, publicists, pamphleteers, the very booksellers,\r\nwere imprisoned there in large numbers.\" And to substantiate this\r\neloquent apostrophe, M. Bournon cites the names of Voltaire, La\r\nBeaumelle, the Abbé Morellet, Marmontel, and Linguet, imprisoned in the\r\nBastille; and of Diderot and the Marquis de Mirabeau placed in the\r\nchâteau of Vincennes.\r\n\r\nLet us recall the story of these poor victims in turn, and trace the\r\nhistory of their martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE.\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious and the earliest in date of the writers mentioned\r\nby M. Bournon is Voltaire. He was sent to the Bastille on two different\r\noccasions. His first imprisonment began on May 17, 1717. At that date\r\nthe poet was only twenty-two years of age and of no reputation; he did\r\nnot even bear the name of Voltaire, which he only took after his\r\ndischarge from the Bastille on April 14, 1718. The cause of his\r\ndetention was not \"the generous and majestic movement towards ideas of\r\nenfranchisement which is the glory of the human spirit,\" but some\r\nscurrilities which, to speak plainly, brought him what he deserved:\r\ncoarse verses against the Regent and his daughter, and public utterances\r\ncoarser still. Many authors state that Voltaire was imprisoned for\r\nwriting the _J'ai vu_, a satire against the government of Louis XIV.,\r\neach stanza of which ended with the line:--\r\n\r\n    J'ai vu ces maux, et je n'ai pas vingt ans.[42]\r\n\r\nThis is a mistake. Voltaire was imprisoned for having written the _Puero\r\nregnante_, some verses on the Regent and his daughter, the Duchess of\r\nBerry, which it would be impossible to translate. To these he added\r\nobservations whose reproduction would be equally impossible. At the\r\nBastille Voltaire underwent examinations in the usual way, in the course\r\nof which he lied with impudence; after that he was allowed considerable\r\nliberty. \"It was at the Bastille,\" wrote Condorcet, \"that the young poet\r\nmade the first draft of his poem _La Ligue_, corrected his tragedy of\r\n_OEdipe_, and composed some very lively lines on the ill-luck of being\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are the most respectable lines of this production:--\r\n\r\n    So one fine faultless morning in the spring,\r\n    When Whitsun splendour brighten'd everything,\r\n    A strange commotion startled me from sleep.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    At last I reach'd my chamber in the keep.\r\n    A clownish turnkey, with an unctuous smile,\r\n    Of my new lodging 'gan to praise the style:\r\n    \"What ease, what charms, what comforts here are yours!\r\n    For never Phoebus in his daily course\r\n    Will blind you here with his too brilliant rays;\r\n    Within these ten-foot walls you'll spend your days\r\n    In cool sequester'd blithefulness always.\"\r\n    Then bidding me admire my cloistral cell--\r\n    The triple doors, the triple locks as well,\r\n    The bolts, the bars, the gratings all around--\r\n    \"'Tis but,\" says he, \"to keep you safe and sound!\"\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Behold me, then, lodged in this woful place,\r\n    Cribb'd, cabin'd, and confined in narrow space;\r\n    Sleepless by night, and starving half the day;\r\n    No joys, no friend, no mistress--wellaway![43]\r\n\r\nWhen Voltaire was set at liberty, the Regent, whom, as we have just\r\nsaid, he had reviled, made him a very handsome offer of his protection.\r\nThe poet's reply is well known: \"My lord, I thank your royal highness\r\nfor being so good as to continue to charge yourself with my board, but\r\nI beseech you no longer to charge yourself with my lodging.\" The young\r\nwriter thus obtained from the Regent a pension of 400 crowns, which\r\nlater on the latter augmented to 2000 livres.\r\n\r\nVoltaire was sent to the Bastille a second time in April, 1726. For this\r\nnew detention there was no justification whatever. He had had a violent\r\nquarrel, one evening at the Opera, with the Chevalier de Rohan-Chabot.\r\nOn another occasion, at the Comédie Française, the poet and the nobleman\r\nhad a warm altercation in the box of Mdlle. Lecouvreur. Rohan raised his\r\nstick, Voltaire put his hand on his sword, and the actress fainted. Some\r\ndays later \"the gallant chevalier, assisted by half a dozen ruffians,\r\nbehind whom he courageously posted himself,\" gave our poet a thrashing\r\nin broad daylight. When relating the adventure later, the Chevalier said\r\npleasantly: \"I commanded the squad.\" From that moment Voltaire sought\r\nhis revenge. \"The police reports reveal curious details of the loose,\r\nerratic, and feverish life he lived between the insult and his arrest,\"\r\nwrites the careful biographer of Voltaire, Desnoiresterres. From one of\r\nthese police reports we see that the young writer established relations\r\nwith soldiers of the guard: several notorious bullies were constantly\r\nabout him. A relative who attempted to calm him found him more irritated\r\nand violent in his language than ever. It appears certain that he was\r\nmeditating some act of violence, which indeed would not have been\r\nwithout justification. But the Cardinal de Rohan contrived that he\r\nshould be arrested on the night of April 17, 1726, and placed in the\r\nBastille.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this new imprisonment Marshal de Villars writes: \"The\r\npublic, disposed to find fault all round, came to the conclusion on this\r\noccasion that everybody was in the wrong: Voltaire for having offended\r\nthe Chevalier de Rohan, the latter for having dared to commit a capital\r\noffence in causing a citizen to be beaten, the government for not having\r\npunished a notorious crime, and for having sent the injured party to the\r\nBastille to pacify the injurer.\" Nevertheless, we read in the report of\r\nHérault, the lieutenant of police: \"The Sieur de Voltaire was found\r\narmed with pocket pistols, and his family, when informed of the matter,\r\nunanimously and universally applauded the wisdom of an order which saves\r\nthis young man the ill effects of some new piece of folly and the worthy\r\npeople who compose his family the vexation of sharing his shame.\"\r\n\r\nVoltaire remained at the Bastille for _twelve days_: he was permitted to\r\nhave a servant of his own choice to wait on him, who was boarded at the\r\nking's expense; as for himself, he took his meals whenever he pleased at\r\nthe governor's table, going out of the Bastille, as the governor's\r\nresidence stood outside the prison. Relatives and friends came to see\r\nhim; his friend Thiériot dined with him; he was given pens, paper,\r\nbooks, whatever he desired in order to divert himself. \"Using and\r\nabusing these opportunities,\" writes Desnoiresterres, \"Voltaire believed\r\nthat he could give audience to all Paris. He wrote to those of his\r\nfriends who had not yet shown a sense of their duty, exhorting them to\r\ngive him proof they were alive.\" \"I have been accustomed to all\r\nmisfortunes,\" he wrote to Thiériot, \"but not yet to that of being\r\nutterly abandoned by you. Madame de Bernières, Madame du Deffand, the\r\nChevalier des Alleurs really ought to come and see me. They only have to\r\nask permission of M. Hérault or M. de Maurepas.\" At the time of the\r\npoet's entrance to the Bastille, the lieutenant of police had written to\r\nthe governor: \"The Sieur de Voltaire is of a _genius_ that requires\r\nhumouring. His Serene Highness has approved of my writing to tell you\r\nthat the king's intention is that you should secure for him mild\r\ntreatment and the internal liberty of the Bastille, so far as these do\r\nnot jeopardize the security of his detention.\" The warrant setting him\r\nat liberty was signed on April 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BEAUMELLE.\r\n\r\nIn M. Bournon's list La Beaumelle comes second. The circumstances under\r\nwhich he was put into the Bastille were as follows. After having fallen\r\nout at Berlin with Voltaire, whom he had compared to a monkey, La\r\nBeaumelle returned to Paris, whence he had been exiled. There he got\r\nprinted a new edition of Voltaire's _Age of Louis XIV._, unknown to the\r\nauthor, and interpolated therein odes insulting to the house of Orleans.\r\n\"La Beaumelle,\" exclaimed Voltaire, \"is the first who dared to print\r\nanother man's work in his lifetime. This miserable Erostrates of the\r\n_Age of Louis XIV._ has discovered the secret of changing into an\r\ninfamous libel, for fifteen ducats, a work undertaken for the glory of\r\nthe nation.\"\r\n\r\nLa Beaumelle became an inmate of the Bastille in April, 1753, and\r\nremained there for six months. Writing on May 18, 1753, to M. Roques,\r\nVoltaire said that \"there was scarcely any country where he would not\r\ninevitably have been punished sooner or later, and I know from a certain\r\nsource that there are two courts where they would have inflicted a\r\nchastisement more signal than that which he is undergoing here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before La Beaumelle issued his edition of _Notes towards\r\nthe History of Madame de Maintenon and that of the past century_, with\r\nnine volumes of correspondence. He had fabricated letters which he\r\nattributed to Madame de Saint-Géran and Madame de Frontenac, and\r\npublished a correspondence of Madame de Maintenon which M. Geffroy, in a\r\nwork recognized as authoritative, regards as full of barefaced\r\nfalsehoods and foul and scurrilous inventions. He had inserted in his\r\nwork the following phrase: \"The court of Vienna has been long accused of\r\nhaving poisoners always in its pay.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that La Beaumelle's publication owed its great vogue\r\nto special circumstances. The author's reputation abroad, the very title\r\nof the book, lent it great importance; and France, then engaged in the\r\nSeven Years' War, found it necessary to keep in Austria's good graces.\r\nLa Beaumelle was conveyed to the Bastille a second time. The lieutenant\r\nof police, Berryer, put him through the usual examination. La Beaumelle\r\nwas a man of the world, so witty that in the course of their quarrels he\r\ndrove Voltaire himself to despair. He showed himself such in his\r\nexamination. \"La Beaumelle,\" said Berryer to him, \"this is wit you are\r\ngiving me when what I ask of you is plain sense.\" On his expressing a\r\nwish for a companion, he was placed with the Abbé d'Estrades. The\r\nofficers of the château had all his manuscripts brought from his house,\r\nso that he might continue his literary work. He had at the Bastille a\r\nlibrary of 600 volumes, ranged on shelves which the governor ordered to\r\nbe made for him. He there finished a translation of the _Annals_ of\r\nTacitus and the _Odes_ of Horace. He had permission to write to his\r\nrelatives and friends, and to receive visits from them; he had the\r\nliberty of walking in the castle garden, of breeding birds in his room,\r\nand of having brought from outside all the luxuries to which he was\r\npartial. The principal secretary of the lieutenant of police, Duval,\r\nreports the following incident: \"Danry (the famous Latude) and Allègre\r\n(his companion in confinement and ere long in escape) found means to\r\nopen a correspondence with all the prisoners in the Bastille. They\r\nlifted a stone in a closet of the chapel, and put their letters\r\nunderneath it. La Beaumelle pretended to be a woman in his letters to\r\nAllègre, and as he was a man of parts and Allègre was of keen\r\nsensibility and an excellent writer, the latter fell madly in love with\r\nLa Beaumelle, to such a degree that, though they mutually agreed to\r\nburn their letters, Allègre preserved those of his fancied mistress,\r\nwhich he had not the heart to give to the flames; with the result that,\r\nthe letters being discovered at an inspection of his room, he was put in\r\nthe cells for some time. The prisoner amused himself also by composing\r\nverses which he recited at the top of his voice. This gave much concern\r\nto the officers of the garrison, and Chevalier, the major, wrote to the\r\nlieutenant of police on the matter: \"The Sieur de la Beaumelle seems to\r\nhave gone clean out of his mind; he seems to be a maniac; he amuses\r\nhimself by declaiming verses in his room for a part of the day: for the\r\nrest of the time he is quiet.\"\r\n\r\nThis second detention lasted from August, 1756, till August, 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABBÉ MORELLET.\r\n\r\nWe come to the Abbé Morellet, a man of fine and fascinating mind, one of\r\nthe best of the Encyclopædists, who died in 1819 a member of the\r\nInstitute and the object of general esteem. He was arrested on June 11,\r\n1760, for having had printed and distributed, without privilege or\r\npermission, a pamphlet entitled: _Preface to the Philosophers' Comedy;\r\nor, the Vision of Charles Palissot_.[44] These are the terms in which,\r\nlater on, Morellet himself judged his pamphlet: \"I must here make my\r\nconfession. In this work, I went far beyond the limits of a literary\r\npleasantry regarding the Sieur Palissot, and to-day I am not without\r\nremorse for my fault.\" And further, as J. J. Rousseau, in whose favour\r\nthe pamphlet had been in part composed, had to acknowledge, the Abbé\r\n\"very impudently\" insulted a young and pretty woman, Madame de Robecq,\r\nwho was dying of decline, spitting blood, and did actually die a few\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Morellet was demanded by Malesherbes, then censor of the\r\npress, one of the most generous and liberal spirits of the time, the\r\ninspirer of the famous remonstrances of the Court of Taxation against\r\n_lettres de cachet_--the man who, as M. H. Monin testifies, \"being\r\nelected censor of the press, protected philosophers and men of letters,\r\nand by his personal efforts facilitated the publication of the\r\n_Encyclopædia_.\" Speaking of the _Preface to the Comedy_, Malesherbes\r\nwrites to Gabriel de Sartine, lieutenant-general of police: \"It is an\r\noutrageous pamphlet, not only against Palissot, but against respectable\r\npersons whose very condition should shelter them against such insults. I\r\nbeg you, sir, to be good enough to put a stop to this scandal. I believe\r\nit to be a matter of public importance that the punishment should be\r\nvery severe, and that this punishment should not stop at the Bastille or\r\nthe For-l'Evêque,[45] because a very wide distinction must be drawn\r\nbetween the delinquencies of men of letters tearing each other to\r\npieces and the insolence of those who attack persons of the highest\r\nconsideration in the State. I do not think that Bicêtre would be too\r\nsevere for these last. If you have to ask M. de Saint-Florentin for the\r\nroyal authority for your proceedings, I hope you will be good enough to\r\ninform him of the request I am making.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, on Malesherbes' showing, the Bastille would\r\nnot suffice to punish the _Preface to the Comedy_, nor even the\r\nFor-l'Evêque; he asks for the most stringent of the prisons, Bicêtre.\r\nBefore long, it is true, this excellent man returned to milder\r\nsentiments. An imprisonment at Bicêtre, he wrote, would be infamous.\r\nSaint-Florentin and Sartine were not hard to convince. Morellet was\r\ntaken to the Bastille. \"The warrant for his arrest,\" wrote one of his\r\nagents to Malesherbes, \"was executed this morning by Inspector D'Hémery\r\nwith all the amenities possible in so unpleasant a business. D'Hémery\r\nknows the Abbé Morellet, and has spoken of him to M. de Sartine in the\r\nmost favourable terms.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the Bastille the Abbé calculated that his imprisonment\r\nwould last six months, and after acknowledging that he at that time\r\nviewed his detention without great distress, he adds: \"I am bound to\r\nsay, to lower the too high opinion that may be formed of me and my\r\ncourage, that I was marvellously sustained by a thought which rendered\r\nmy little virtue more easy. I saw some literary glory illumining the\r\nwalls of my prison; persecuted, I must be better known. The men of\r\nletters whom I had avenged, and the philosophy for which I was a\r\nmartyr, would lay the foundation of my reputation. The men of the world,\r\nwho love satire, would receive me better than ever. A career was opening\r\nbefore me, and I should be able to pursue it at greater advantage. These\r\nsix months at the Bastille would be an excellent recommendation, and\r\nwould infallibly make my fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé remained at the Bastille, not six months, but six weeks, \"which\r\nslipped away,\" he observes \"--I chuckle still as I think of them--very\r\npleasantly for me.\" He spent his time in reading romances, and, with\r\nadmirable humour, in writing a _Treatise on the Liberty of the Press_.\r\nAfterwards the good Abbé informs us that the hopes which he had indulged\r\nwere not deceived. On issuing from the Bastille he was a made man.\r\nLittle known two months before, he now met everywhere with the reception\r\nhe desired. The doors of the salons of Madame de Boufflers, Madame\r\nNecker, the Baron d'Holbach, flew open before him; women pitied him and\r\nadmired him, and men followed their example. Why have we not to-day a\r\nBastille to facilitate the career of writers of talent!\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMONTEL.\r\n\r\nTo Marmontel his stay at the royal prison appeared as pleasant as the\r\nAbbé Morellet had found his. He had amused himself by reciting at Madame\r\nGeoffrin's a mordant satire in which the Duke d'Aumont, first groom of\r\nthe stole to the king, was cruelly hit. The duke expostulated;\r\nMarmontel wrote to him declaring that he was not the author of the\r\nsatire; but the nobleman stood his ground.\r\n\r\n\"I am helpless,\" said the Count de Saint-Florentin, who countersigned\r\nthe _lettre de cachet_, to Marmontel; \"the Duke d'Aumont accuses you,\r\nand is determined to have you punished. It is a satisfaction he demands\r\nin recompense for his services and the services of his ancestors. The\r\nking has been pleased to grant him his wish. So you will go and find M.\r\nde Sartine; I am addressing to him the king's order; you will tell him\r\nthat it was from my hand you received it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to find M. de Sartine,\" writes Marmontel, \"and I found with him\r\nthe police officer who was to accompany me. M. de Sartine was intending\r\nthat he should go to the Bastille in a separate carriage; but I myself\r\ndeclined this obliging offer, and we arrived at the Bastille, my\r\nintroducer and myself, in the same hack.... The governor, M. d'Abadie,\r\nasked me if I wished my servant to be left with me.... They made a\r\ncursory inspection of my packets and books, and then sent me up to a\r\nlarge room furnished with two beds, two tables, a low cupboard, and\r\nthree cane chairs. It was cold, but a jailer made us a good fire and\r\nbrought me wood in abundance. At the same time they gave me pens, ink,\r\nand paper, on condition of my accounting for the use I made of them and\r\nthe number of sheets they allowed me.\r\n\r\n\"The jailer came back to ask if I was satisfied with my bed. After\r\nexamining it I replied that the mattresses were bad and the coverlets\r\ndirty. In a minute all was changed. They sent to ask me what was my\r\ndinner hour. I replied, 'The same as everybody's.' The Bastille had a\r\nlibrary: the governor sent me the catalogue, giving me free choice among\r\nthe books. I merely thanked him for myself, but my servant asked for the\r\nromances of Prévost, and they were brought to him.\"\r\n\r\nLet us go on with Marmontel's story. \"For my part,\" he says, \"I had the\r\nmeans of escape from ennui. Having been for a long time impatient of the\r\ncontempt shown by men of letters for Lucan's poem, which they had not\r\nread, and only knew in the barbarous fustian of Brébeuf's version, I had\r\nresolved to translate it more becomingly and faithfully into prose; and\r\nthis work, which would occupy me without fatiguing my brain, was the\r\nbest possible employment for the solitary leisure of my prison. So I had\r\nbrought the _Pharsalia_ with me, and, to understand it the better, I had\r\nbeen careful to bring with it the _Commentaries_ of Cæsar. Behold me\r\nthen at the corner of a good fire, pondering the quarrel of Cæsar and\r\nPompey, and forgetting my own with the Duke d'Aumont. And there was Bury\r\ntoo (Marmontel's servant) as philosophical as myself, amusing himself by\r\nmaking our beds placed at two opposite corners of my room, which was at\r\nthis moment lit up by the beams of a fine winter sun, in spite of the\r\nbars of two strong iron gratings which permitted me a view of the Suburb\r\nSaint-Antoine.\r\n\r\n\"Two hours later, the noise of the bolts of the two doors which shut me\r\nin startled me from my profound musings, and the two jailers, loaded\r\nwith a dinner I believed to be mine, came in and served it in silence.\r\nOne put down in front of the fire three little dishes covered with\r\nplates of common earthenware; the other laid on that one of the two\r\ntables which was clear a tablecloth rather coarse, indeed, but white. I\r\nsaw him place on the table a very fair set of things, a pewter spoon and\r\nfork, good household bread, and a bottle of wine. Their duty done, the\r\njailers retired, and the two doors were shut again with the same noise\r\nof locks and bolts.\r\n\r\n\"Then Bury invited me to take my place, and served my soup. It was a\r\nFriday. The soup, made without meat, was a _purée_ of white beans, with\r\nthe freshest butter, and a dish of the same beans was the first that\r\nBury served me with. I found all this excellent. The dish of cod he gave\r\nme for second course was better still. It was served with a dash of\r\ngarlic, which gave it a delicacy of taste and odour which would have\r\nflattered the taste of the daintiest Gascon. The wine was not\r\nfirst-rate, but passable; no sweets: of course one must expect to be\r\ndeprived of something. On the whole, I thought that dinner in prison was\r\nnot half bad.\r\n\r\n\"As I was rising from table, and Bury was about to sit down--for there\r\nwas enough for his dinner in what was left--lo and behold! in came my\r\ntwo jailers again, with pyramids of dishes in their hands. At this\r\ndisplay of fine linen, fine china-ware, spoon and fork of silver, we\r\nrecognized our mistake; but we made not the ghost of a sign, and when\r\nour jailers, having laid down their burden, had retired, 'Sir,' said\r\nBury, 'you have just eaten my dinner, you will quite agree to my having\r\nmy turn and eating yours.' 'That's fair,' I replied, and the walls of my\r\nroom were astonished, I fancy, at the sound of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"This dinner was not vegetarian; here are the details: an excellent\r\nsoup, a juicy beef-steak, a boiled capon's leg streaming with gravy and\r\nmelting in one's mouth, a little dish of artichokes fried in pickle, a\r\ndish of spinach, a very fine William pear, fresh-cut grapes, a bottle of\r\nold burgundy, and best Mocha coffee; this was Bury's dinner, with the\r\nexception of the coffee and the fruit, which he insisted on reserving\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n\"After dinner the governor came to see me, and asked me if I found the\r\nfare sufficient, assuring me that I should be served from his table,\r\nthat he would take care to cut my portions himself, and that no one\r\nshould touch my food but himself. He suggested a fowl for my supper; I\r\nthanked him and told him that what was left of the fruit from my dinner\r\nwould suffice. The reader has just seen what my ordinary fare was at the\r\nBastille, and from this he may infer with what mildness, or rather\r\nreluctance, they brought themselves to visit on me the wrath of the Duke\r\nd'Aumont.\r\n\r\n\"Every day I had a visit from the governor. As he had some smack of\r\nliterature and even of Latin, he took some interest in following my\r\nwork, in fact, enjoyed it; but soon, tearing himself away from these\r\nlittle dissipations, he said, 'Adieu, I am going to console men who are\r\nmore unfortunate than you.'\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the imprisonment of Marmontel. It lasted for eleven days.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINGUET.\r\n\r\nLinguet, advocate and journalist, was arrested for a breach of the press\r\nlaws and for slander. He was a man of considerable ability, but little\r\ncharacter. Attorney-general Cruppi has devoted to the story of Linguet a\r\nwork as extensive as it is eloquent. He has a wealth of indulgence for\r\nhis hero; yet, despite the goodwill he shows for him and endeavours to\r\nimpart to the reader, his book reveals between the lines that Linguet\r\nwas worthy of little esteem, and that his professional brethren were\r\njustified in removing his name from the roll of the advocates of Paris.\r\n\r\nLinguet's captivity lasted for two years. He has left a description of\r\nit in his _Memoirs on the Bastille_, which made a great noise, and of\r\nwhich the success has endured down to our own day. His book, like\r\neverything which came from his pen, is written in a fluent style, with\r\nspirit and brilliance; the facts cited are for the most part correct,\r\nbut the author, aiming at making a sensation, has cleverly presented\r\nthem in a light which distorts their real character. \"There are means,\"\r\nsays Madame de Staal, \"of so distributing light and shade on the facts\r\none is exhibiting, as to alter their appearance without altering the\r\ngroundwork.\" Take, for instance, the description that Linguet gives of\r\nhis belongings while in the Bastille: \"Two worm-eaten mattresses, a cane\r\nchair the seat of which was only held to it by strings, a folding table,\r\na jug for water, two earthenware pots, one of them for drinking, and two\r\nstone slabs to make a fire on.\" A contemporary could say of Linguet's\r\n_Memoirs_, \"It is the longest lie that ever was printed.\" And yet, if we\r\ntake the facts themselves which are related by the clever journalist,\r\nand disengage them from the deceitful mirage in which he has enwrapped\r\nthem, we do not see that his life in the Bastille was so wretched as he\r\nendeavours to make us believe. He is forced to acknowledge that his food\r\nwas always most abundant, adding, it is true, that that was because they\r\nwished to poison him! He owed his life, he is convinced, \"only to the\r\nobstinate tenacity of his constitution.\" He marked, nevertheless, on the\r\nmenu for the day, which was sent up every morning by the Bastille cook,\r\nthe dishes he fancied; and later on he had his room furnished after his\r\nown heart. He still enjoyed, moreover, enough liberty to write during\r\nhis imprisonment a work entitled, _The Trials of Three Kings, Louis\r\nXVI., Charles III., and George III._, which appeared in London in 1781.\r\nLet us recall once more the famous saying of Linguet to the wig-maker of\r\nthe Bastille on the first day that he presented himself to trim the\r\nprisoner's beard: \"To whom have I the honour of speaking?\" \"I am, sir,\r\nthe barber to the Bastille.\" \"Gad, then, why don't you raze it?\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1792, some years after his liberation, Linguet was prosecuted a\r\nsecond time for breach of the press laws. The revolutionary tribunal\r\ncondemned him to death. As he mounted the steps of the scaffold, the\r\nardent pamphleteer thought, mayhap, with bitterly ironical regret, of\r\nthat Bastille whose destruction he had so clamorously demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDEROT.\r\n\r\nWe have still to speak of Diderot and the Marquis de Mirabeau, who were\r\nnot incarcerated at the Bastille, but at Vincennes, not in the castle\r\nkeep, but in the château itself, which constituted a separate place of\r\nimprisonment. They placed in the château only prisoners guilty of minor\r\noffences, who were sentenced to a temporary detention, and to whom they\r\nwished to show some consideration. This was, as we have just said, the\r\nabode of Diderot and the Marquis de Mirabeau. Diderot was arrested on\r\nJuly 24, 1749. His last book, _Letters on the Blind for the Use of those\r\nWho Can See_, contained theories which appeared to have but little title\r\nto the description of \"moral.\" But in the course of his examination he\r\nstoutly denied that he was its author, as also he denied the authorship\r\nof the _Thoughts of a Philosopher_ he had published some years before.\r\nThe lieutenant of police gave instructions to the governor of Vincennes\r\nthat, short of being set at liberty, Diderot was to be granted all\r\npossible comforts--allowed to walk in the garden and park; \"that the\r\nking's desire was, in consideration of the literary work on which he was\r\nengaged (the _Encyclopædia_), to permit him to communicate freely with\r\npersons from without who might come for that purpose or on family\r\nbusiness.\" And so Diderot received a visit from his wife and walked with\r\nher in the wood; Rousseau and D'Alembert spent their afternoons with\r\nhim, and, as in the \"good old days\" of Plato and Socrates, our\r\nphilosophers chatted of metaphysics and love, seated on the green grass\r\nunder the shade of mighty oaks. The booksellers and printers who had\r\nundertaken the publication of the _Encyclopædia_ were, as we have seen,\r\nin constant communication with Diderot at Vincennes; he corrected in\r\nprison the proofs of the publication, which the court looked on with no\r\nfavourable eye. And we know, too, that at night, with the secret\r\ncomplicity of the governor, our philosopher cleared the park walls to\r\nhurry to a fair lady at Paris, one Madame de Puysieux, whom he loved\r\nwith a passion by no means platonic; ere the sun was up, the jailers\r\nfound him safely back under lock and key. This irksome captivity lasted\r\nlittle more than three months.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS DE MIRABEAU.\r\n\r\nThe imprisonment of Mirabeau lasted only ten days. The _lettre de\r\ncachet_ had been obtained by the clique of financiers, who took fright\r\nat the audacious conceptions of the _Theory of Taxation_. \"I fancy I\r\ndeserved my punishment,\" wrote the Marquis, \"like the ass in the fable,\r\nfor a clumsy and misplaced zeal.\" In regard to the arrest, Madame\r\nd'Epinay sent word to Voltaire: \"Never before was a man arrested as this\r\none was. The officer said to him, 'Sir, my orders do not state I am to\r\nhurry you: to-morrow will do, if you haven't time to-day.' 'No, sir, one\r\ncannot be too prompt in obeying the king's orders, I am quite ready.'\r\nAnd off he went with a bag crammed with books and papers.\" At Vincennes\r\nthe Marquis had a servant with him. His wife came to see him. The king\r\nspent for his support fifteen livres a day, more than twenty-five\r\nshillings of our money. He was liberated on December 24, 1760. His\r\nbrother, Bailie Mirabeau, speaking of this detention, wrote to him of \"a\r\nweek's imprisonment in which you were shown every possible\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have exhausted M. Bournon's list of the writers who were victims of\r\narbitrary authority. Such are the \"martyrs\" for whom that excellent\r\nhistorian, and Michelet and others, have shown the most affecting\r\ncompassion. The foregoing facts do not call for comment. Men of letters\r\nwere the spoilt children of the eighteenth century much more than of our\r\nown, and never has an absolute government shown a toleration equal to\r\nthat of the monarchy under the _ancien régime_ towards writers whose\r\ndoctrines, as events have proved, tended directly to its destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLATUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew historical figures have taken a higher place in the popular\r\nimagination than Masers de Latude. That celebrated prisoner seems to\r\nhave accumulated in his life of suffering all the wrongs that spring\r\nfrom an arbitrary government. The novelists and playwrights of the\r\nnineteenth century have made him a hero; the poets have draped his woes\r\nin fine mourning robes, our greatest historians have burnt for him the\r\nmidnight oil; numerous editions of his _Memoirs_ have appeared in quick\r\nsuccession down to our own days. Even by his contemporaries he was\r\nregarded as a martyr, and posterity has not plucked the shining crown of\r\nmartyrdom from his head, hoary with the snows of long captivity. His\r\nlegend is the creature of his own unaided brain. When in 1790 he\r\ndictated the story of his life, he made greater calls on his glowing\r\nsouthern imagination than on his memory; but the documents relating to\r\nhis case in the archives of the Bastille have been preserved. At the\r\npresent time they are to be found dispersed among various libraries, at\r\nthe Arsenal, at Carnavalet, at St. Petersburg. Thanks to them it is\r\neasy to establish the truth.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1725, at Montagnac in Languedoc, a poor girl named\r\nJeanneton Aubrespy gave birth to a male child who was baptized three\r\ndays later under the name of Jean Henri, given him by his god-parents,\r\nJean Bouhour and Jeanne Boudet. Surname the poor little creature had\r\nnone, for he was the illegitimate child of a father unknown. Jeanneton,\r\nwho had just passed her thirtieth year, was of respectable middle-class\r\nfamily, and lived near the Lom gate in a little house which seems to\r\nhave been her own. Several cousins of hers held commissions in the army.\r\nBut from the day when she became a mother, her family had no more to do\r\nwith her, and she fell into want. Happily she was a woman of stout\r\nheart, and by her spinning and sewing she supported her boy, who shot up\r\ninto a lad of keen intelligence and considerable ambition. She succeeded\r\nin getting him some sort of education, and we find Jean Henri at the age\r\nof seventeen acting as assistant surgeon in the army of Languedoc.\r\nSurgeons, it is true, made no great figure in the eighteenth century;\r\nthey combined the duties of barber and dentist as well as leech. But the\r\nsituation was good enough. \"Assistant surgeons in the army,\" wrote\r\nSaint-Marc the detective, \"who really worked at their trade, made a good\r\ndeal of money.\" At this time, being reluctant to bear his mother's name,\r\nthe young man ingeniously transformed his double forename into Jean\r\nDanry, under which he is designated in a passport for Alsace, given him\r\non March 25, 1743, by the general commanding the royal forces in\r\nLanguedoc. In the same year 1743, Danry accompanied the army of Marshal\r\nde Noailles in its operations on the Maine and the Rhine, receiving from\r\nthe Marshal, towards the end of the season, a certificate testifying to\r\nhis good and faithful service throughout the campaign.\r\n\r\nFour years later we find Danry at Brussels, employed in the\r\nfield-hospital of the army in Flanders, at a salary of 500 livres a\r\nmonth. He was present at the famous siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, the\r\nimpregnable fortress which the French so valiantly stormed under the\r\ncommand of the Comte de Lowendal. But peace being concluded at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, the armies were disbanded, and Danry went to Paris. He\r\nhad in his pocket a letter of recommendation to Descluzeaux, the surgeon\r\nof Marshal de Noailles, and a certificate signed by Guignard de La\r\nGarde, chief of the commissariat, testifying to the ability and good\r\nconduct of \"the aforesaid Jean Danry, assistant surgeon.\" These two\r\ncertificates formed the most substantial part of his fortune.\r\n\r\nDanry arrived in Paris about the end of the year 1748. On any afternoon\r\nhe might have been seen strolling about the Tuileries in a grey frock\r\nand red waistcoat, carrying his twenty-three years with a good grace. Of\r\nmiddle height and somewhat spare figure, wearing his brown hair in a\r\nsilk net, having keen eyes and an expression of much intelligence, he\r\nwould probably have been thought a handsome fellow but for the marks\r\nwhich smallpox had indelibly stamped on his face. His accent had a\r\ndecided Gascon tang, and it is obvious, from the spelling of his\r\nletters, not only that he could not boast of a literary education, but\r\nthat his speech was that of a man of the people. Yet, what with his\r\nbrisk temperament, his professional skill, and his favour with his\r\nsuperiors, he was in a fair way to attain an honourable position, which\r\nwould have enabled him at length to support his mother, then living in\r\nsolitary friendlessness at Montagnac, centring on him, in her forlorn\r\ncondition, all her affection and her dearest hopes.\r\n\r\nParis, with its gaiety and stir, dazzled the young man. Its brilliant\r\nand luxurious life, its rustling silks and laces, set him dreaming. He\r\nfound the girls of Paris charming creatures, and opened his heart to\r\nthem without stint, and his purse too; and his heart was more opulent\r\nthan his purse. Ere long he had spent his modest savings and sunk into\r\nwant. He fell into bad company. His best friend, an apothecary's\r\nassistant named Binguet, shared with him a mean garret in the Cul-de-sac\r\ndu Coq, in the house of one Charmeleux, who let furnished lodgings. Than\r\nthese two no greater rakes, wastrels, or thorough-paced rascals could\r\nhave been found in all Paris. Danry in particular very soon got a name\r\nall over his neighbourhood for his riotous, threatening, and choleric\r\ntemper. Dying of hunger, threatened with being ejected neck-and-crop\r\nfrom his lodging for nonpayment of rent, he was reduced at last to write\r\nfor money to his mother, who, poor thing, had barely enough for her own\r\nmodest wants.\r\n\r\nAs yet we are a long way from the \"handsome officer of engineers\" who\r\nlives in our remembrance: we see little likeness to the brilliant\r\npicture which Danry drew later of those youthful years during which he\r\nreceived, \"by the care of his father the Marquis de La Tude, the\r\neducation of a gentleman destined to serve his country and his king.\"\r\n\r\nHaving come now absolutely to the end of his resources, Danry took it\r\ninto his head that, at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, he had been stripped\r\nby some soldiers of all his clothes but his shirt, and robbed of 678\r\nlivres into the bargain. This story he worked up in a letter addressed\r\nto Moreau de Séchelles, commissary of the army in Flanders, hoping to\r\nget it corroborated by Guignard de La Garde, the commissary under whom\r\nhe had himself served. In this letter he demanded compensation for the\r\nlosses he had suffered while devoting himself under fire to the care of\r\nthe wounded. But we read, in the _Memoirs_ he wrote later, that so far\r\nfrom having been stripped and robbed, he had actually purchased at\r\nBergen-op-Zoom a considerable quantity of goods of all kinds when they\r\nwere sold off cheap after the sack of the town. However that may be, his\r\nexperiment was a failure. But Danry was a man of resource, and not many\r\ndays had passed before he had hit on another means of raising the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Cover of the explosive box sent by Danry to the Marquise de\r\n     Pompadour. The words almost obliterated are: \"Je vous prie, Madame,\r\n     d'ouvrir le paquet en particulié.\" Below is the record and the date\r\n     of Danry's examination, with his signature, and that of Berryer,\r\n     the lieutenant of police.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt this time everybody was talking about the struggle between the\r\nking's ministers and the Marquise de Pompadour, which had just ended in\r\na triumph for the lady. Maurepas was going into exile, but it was\r\ngenerally believed that he was a man who would wreak vengeance on his\r\nenemy, and the favourite herself openly declared that she went in fear\r\nof poison. A light dawned on the young surgeon's mind as he heard such\r\ngossip as this; he caught a sudden glimpse of himself--even he, the\r\nragged outcast--arrayed in cloth of gold and rolling in his carriage\r\nalong the Versailles road.\r\n\r\nThis was his plan. On April 27, 1749, in a shop under the arcade of the\r\nPalais-Royal, hard by the grand staircase, he bought of a small\r\ntradesman six of those little bottle-shaped toys, once called Prince\r\nRupert's Drops, out of which children used to get so much harmless\r\namusement. They were globules of molten glass, which, on being thrown\r\ninto cold water, had taken the shape of pears, and which, if the\r\ntapering end was suddenly snapped, crumbled with a loud report into\r\ndust. Four of these crackers Danry placed in a cardboard box, binding\r\nthe thin ends together with a thread which he fixed in the lid. Over\r\nthese he sprinkled some toilet powder, and this he covered with a layer\r\nof powdered vitriol and alum. The whole packet he then enclosed in a\r\ndouble wrapper, writing on the inner one, \"I beg you, madam, to open the\r\npacket in private,\" and on the outer one, \"To Madame the Marquise de\r\nPompadour, at court.\"\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the evening of the next day, Danry, having seen his\r\npacket safely in the post, hurried off himself to Versailles. He had\r\nhoped to gain admittance to the favourite herself, but being stopped by\r\nGourbillon, her principal valet, in a voice trembling with emotion he\r\nrelated to him a frightful story. Happening to be at the Tuileries, he\r\nsaid, he had observed two men seated in animated conversation, and on\r\ngoing close to them heard them mouthing the most horrible threats\r\nagainst Madame de Pompadour. When they rose he dogged their footsteps,\r\nwhich led direct to the post office, where they consigned a packet to\r\nthe box. Who the men were, and what was the nature of the packet, were\r\nnatural questions to which Danry had no answer; all he could say was\r\nthat, devoted to the interests of the Marquise, he had instantly sped\r\noff to reveal to her what he had seen.\r\n\r\nTo understand the impression produced by the young man's information, it\r\nis necessary to bear in mind the feverish excitement then prevailing at\r\ncourt. Maurepas, the witty and sprightly minister who had won Louis\r\nXV.'s special affection because of the charm with which he endowed mere\r\nbusiness for \"the man who was always bored\"--Maurepas had just been\r\nexiled to Bourges. \"Pontchartrain,\" the king sent word to him, \"is too\r\nnear.\" The struggle between the minister and the favourite had been one\r\nof extraordinary violence. Maurepas was for ever dashing off satirical\r\nverses on the girl who had reached the steps of the throne, and\r\nincessantly pursuing her with the cruel and insolent shafts of his wit;\r\nhis muse indeed did not shrink from the most brutal insults. Nor was the\r\nMarquise a whit more tender towards her foe: she openly dubbed him liar\r\nand knave, and assured everybody that he was trying to get her poisoned.\r\nA surgeon was actually required to be in constant attendance upon her,\r\nand she always had an antidote within reach. At table she was careful\r\nnever to be the first to partake of any dish, and in her box at the\r\ntheatre she would drink no lemonade but what had been prepared by her\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\nThe packet which Danry had posted arrived at Versailles on April 29, and\r\nQuesnay, the physician to the king and the Marquise, was requested to\r\nopen it. Having done so with infinite precaution, he recognized the\r\nvitriol and alum and toilet powder, and declared at once that there was\r\nnot a pennyworth of danger in the whole contrivance. But since alum and\r\nvitriol were substances capable of being turned to baneful uses, he\r\nthought that possibly it was a case of a criminal design clumsily\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThere is not a shadow of doubt that Louis XV. and his mistress were\r\nseriously alarmed. D'Argenson himself, who had upheld Maurepas against\r\nthe favourite, had the greatest possible interest in seeing the affair\r\ncleared up as soon as possible. The first move was altogether in favour\r\nof the informer. D'Argenson wrote to Berryer that Danry was deserving of\r\na reward.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in instituting a search for the authors of the plot.\r\nThe lieutenant of police selected the most skilful and intelligent of\r\nhis officers, the detective Saint-Marc, who put himself in communication\r\nwith Danry. But he had not spent two days with the assistant surgeon\r\nbefore he drew up a report demanding his arrest. \"It is not unimportant\r\nto note that Danry is a surgeon, and his best friend an apothecary. In\r\nmy opinion it is essential to apprehend both Danry and Binguet without\r\nfurther delay, and without letting either know of the other's arrest,\r\nand at the same time to search their rooms.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Danry was conveyed to the Bastille on May 1, 1749, and\r\nBinguet was secured the same day. Saint-Marc had taken the precaution to\r\nask the assistant surgeon for a written account of his adventure. This\r\ndocument he put into the hands of an expert, who compared the\r\nhandwriting with the address on the packet sent to Versailles. Danry was\r\nlost. Suspicion was but too well confirmed by the results of a search in\r\nhis room. Being shut up in the Bastille, Danry knew nothing of all these\r\nproceedings, and when, on May 2, the lieutenant-general of police came\r\nto question him, he replied only with lies.\r\n\r\nBerryer, the lieutenant of police, was a man of much firmness, but\r\nhonourable and kindly disposed. \"He inspired one's confidence,\" wrote\r\nDanry himself, \"by his urbanity and kindness.\" This excellent man was\r\nvexed at the attitude taken up by the prisoner, and pointing out the\r\ndanger he was incurring, he besought him to tell the truth. But at a\r\nsecond examination Danry only persisted in his lies. Then all at once he\r\nchanged his tactics and refused to answer the questions put to him.\r\n\"Danry, here we do justice to every one,\" said Berryer to him, to give\r\nhim courage. But entreaties had no better success than threats. Danry\r\nmaintained his obstinate silence; and D'Argenson wrote to Berryer: \"The\r\nthorough elucidation of this affair is too important for you not to\r\nfollow up any clue which may point towards a solution.\"\r\n\r\nBy his falsehoods, and then by his silence, Danry had succeeded in\r\ngiving the appearance of a mysterious plot to what was really an\r\ninsignificant piece of knavery.\r\n\r\nNot till June 15 did he make up his mind to offer a statement very near\r\nthe truth, which was written down and sent at once to the king, who read\r\nit over several times and kept it in his pocket the whole day--a\r\ncircumstance which indicates to what importance the affair had now\r\nswelled. Suspicions were not dispelled by the declaration of June 15.\r\nDanry had misrepresented the truth in his former examinations, and there\r\nwas reason to believe that he was equally misrepresenting it in the\r\nthird. Thus he owed his ruin to his silence and his self-contradictory\r\ndepositions. Six months later, on October 7, 1749, when he was at\r\nVincennes, Dr. Quesnay, who had shown much interest in the young\r\nsurgeon, was sent to find out from him the name of the individual who\r\nhad instigated the crime. On his return the doctor wrote to Berryer,\r\n\"My journey has been utterly useless. I only saw a blockhead, who\r\npersisted nevertheless in adhering to his former declarations.\" Two\r\nyears more had passed away when the lieutenant of police wrote to\r\nQuesnay:--\"February 25, 1751. Danry would be very glad if you would pay\r\nhim a visit, and your compliance might perhaps induce him to lay bare\r\nhis secret soul, and make a frank confession to you of what up to the\r\npresent he has obstinately concealed from me.\"\r\n\r\nQuesnay at once repaired to the Bastille, bearing with him a conditional\r\npromise of liberty. Working himself up into a frenzy, Danry swore that\r\n\"all his answers to the lieutenant of police had been strictly true.\"\r\nWhen the doctor had taken his leave, Danry wrote to the minister: \"M.\r\nQuesnay, who has been several times to see me in my wretchedness, tells\r\nme that your lordship is inclined to believe I had some accomplice in my\r\nfault whom I will not reveal, and that it is for this reason your\r\nlordship will not give me my liberty. I could wish, my lord, from the\r\nbottom of my heart, that your belief were true, for it would be much to\r\nmy profit to put my guilt upon another, whether for having induced me to\r\ncommit my sin or for not having prevented me from committing it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of the ministers that Danry had been the instrument\r\nof a plot against the life of the Marquise de Pompadour directed by some\r\nperson of high rank, and that at the critical moment he had either\r\ntaken fright, or else had made a clean breast of the matter at\r\nVersailles in the hope of reaping some advantage from both sides. These\r\nfacts must be kept in mind if we are to understand the real cause of his\r\nconfinement. Kept, then, in the Bastille, he was subjected to several\r\nexaminations, the reports of which were regularly drawn up and signed by\r\nthe lieutenant of police. Under the _ancien régime_, this officer was,\r\nas we have seen, a regular magistrate, indeed he has no other\r\ndesignation in the documents of the period; he pronounced sentence and\r\nawarded punishments in accordance with that body of customs which then,\r\nas to-day in England, constituted the law.\r\n\r\nBinguet, the apothecary, had been set at liberty immediately after\r\nDanry's declaration of June 15. In the Bastille, Danry was treated with\r\nthe utmost consideration, in accordance with the formal instructions of\r\nBerryer. He was provided with books, tobacco, and a pipe; he was\r\npermitted to play on the flute; and having declared that a solitary life\r\nbored him, he was given two room mates. Every day he was visited by the\r\nofficers of the fortress, and on May 25 the governor came to tell him of\r\nthe magistrate's order: \"That the utmost attention was to be shown him;\r\nif he needed anything he was to be requested to say so, and was to be\r\nallowed to want for nothing.\" No doubt the lieutenant of police hoped,\r\nby dint of kindness, to persuade him to disclose the authors of the\r\nunfortunate plot which was the figment of his imagination.\r\n\r\nDanry did not remain long in the prison of the Suburb Saint-Antoine; on\r\nJuly 28 Saint-Marc transferred him to Vincennes, and we see from the\r\nreport drawn up by the detective with what astonishment the Marquis du\r\nChâtelet, governor of the fortress, heard \"that the court had resolved\r\nto send him such a fellow.\" Vincennes, like the Bastille, was reserved\r\nfor prisoners of good position; our hero was sent there by special\r\nfavour, as he was told for his consolation by the surgeon who attended\r\nhim: \"Only persons of noble birth or the highest distinction are sent to\r\nVincennes.\" Danry was indeed treated like a lord. The best apartment was\r\nreserved for him, and he was able to enjoy the park, where he walked for\r\ntwo hours every day. At the time of his admission to the Bastille, he\r\nwas suffering from some sort of indisposition which later on he ascribed\r\nto his long confinement. At Vincennes he complained of the same illness,\r\nwith the same plea that his troubles had made him ill. He was attended\r\nby a specialist as well as by the surgeon of the prison.\r\n\r\nMeantime the lieutenant came again to see him, reiterating assurances of\r\nhis protection, and advising him to write direct to Madame de Pompadour.\r\nHere is what Danry wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"VINCENNES, _November 4, 1749_.\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,--If wretchedness, goaded by famine, has driven me to commit\r\n     a fault against your dear person, it was with no design of doing\r\n     you any mischief. God is my witness. If the divine mercy would\r\n     assure you to-day, on my behalf, how my soul repents of its heinous\r\n     fault, and how for 188 days I have done nothing but weep at the\r\n     sight of my iron bars, you would have pity on me. Madam, for the\r\n     sake of God who is enlightening you, let your just wrath soften at\r\n     the spectacle of my repentance, my wretchedness, my tears. One day\r\n     God will recompense you for your humanity. You are all-powerful,\r\n     Madam; God has given you power with the greatest king on all the\r\n     earth, His well-beloved; he is merciful, he is not cruel, he is a\r\n     Christian. If the divine power moves your magnanimity to grant me\r\n     my freedom, I would rather die, or sustain my life on nothing but\r\n     roots, than jeopardize it a second time. I have staked all my hopes\r\n     on your Christian charity. Lend a sympathetic ear to my prayer, do\r\n     not abandon me to my unhappy fate. I hope in you, Madam, and God\r\n     will vouchsafe an abundant answer to my prayers that your dear\r\n     person may obtain your heart's desires.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honour to be, with a repentance worthy of pardon,\r\n     Madam, your very humble and very obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"DANRY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA letter which it is a pleasure to quote, for it shows to great\r\nadvantage beside the letters written later by the prisoner. It was only\r\nthe truth that he had no evil design on the favourite's life; but soon\r\nbecoming more audacious, he wrote to Madame de Pompadour saying that if\r\nhe had addressed the box to her at Versailles, it was out of pure\r\ndevotion to her, to put her on her guard against the machinations of her\r\nenemies, in short, to save her life.\r\n\r\nDanry's letter was duly forwarded to the Marquise, but remained without\r\neffect. Losing patience, he resolved to win for himself the freedom\r\ndenied him: on June 15, 1750, he escaped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his _Memoirs_ Danry has related the story of this first escape in a\r\nmanner as lively as imaginative. He really eluded his jailers in the\r\nsimplest way in the world. Having descended to the garden at the usual\r\nhour for his walk, he found there a black spaniel frisking about. The\r\ndog happened to rear itself against the gate, and to push it with its\r\npaws. The gate fell open. Danry passed out and ran straight ahead,\r\n\"till, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, he fell to the ground with\r\nfatigue, in the neighbourhood of Saint-Denis.\"\r\n\r\nThere he remained until nine o'clock in the evening. Then he struck into\r\nthe road to Paris, passing the night beside the aqueduct near the\r\nSaint-Denis gate. At daybreak he entered the city.\r\n\r\nWe know what importance was attached at court to the safe custody of the\r\nprisoner: there was still hope that he would make up his mind to speak\r\nof the grave conspiracy of which he held the secret. D'Argenson wrote at\r\nonce to Berryer: \"Nothing is more important or more urgent than to set\r\non foot at once all conceivable means of recapturing the prisoner.\"\r\nAccordingly all the police were engaged in the search; the description\r\nof the prisoner was printed, a large number of copies being distributed\r\nby Inspector Rulhière among the mounted police.\r\n\r\nDanry took up his lodging with one Cocardon, at the sign of the Golden\r\nSun; but he did not venture to remain for more than two days in the same\r\ninn. He expected his old chum Binguet to come to his assistance, but\r\nBinguet was not going to have anything more to do with the Bastille. It\r\nwas a pretty girl, Annette Benoist, whom Danry had known when he was\r\nlodging with Charmeleux, that devoted herself heart and soul to him. She\r\nknew she herself was running the risk of imprisonment, and already\r\nstrangers of forbidding appearance had come asking at the Golden Sun who\r\nshe was. Little she cared; she found assistance among her companions:\r\nthe girls carried Danry's letters and undertook the search for a safe\r\nlodging. Meanwhile, Danry went to pass the night under the aqueducts; in\r\nthe morning he shut himself in the lodging the girls had chosen for him,\r\nand there he remained for two days without leaving the house, Annette\r\ncoming there to keep him company. Unluckily the young man had no money:\r\nhow was he to pay his score? \"What was to be done, what was to become of\r\nme?\" he said later. \"I was sure to be discovered if I showed myself; if\r\nI fled I ran no less risk.\" He wrote to Dr. Quesnay, who had shown him\r\nso much kindness at Vincennes; but the police got wind of the letter,\r\nand Saint-Marc arrived and seized the fugitive in the inn where he lay\r\nconcealed. The unlucky wretch was haled back to the Bastille. Annette\r\nwas arrested at the Golden Sun at the moment when she was asking for\r\nDanry's letters; she too was shut up in the Bastille. The warders and\r\nsentinels who were on duty at Vincennes on the day of the escape had\r\nbeen thrown into the cells.\r\n\r\nBy his escape from Vincennes, Danry had doubled the gravity of his\r\noffence. The regulations demanded that he should be sent down into the\r\ncells reserved for insubordinate prisoners. \"M. Berryer came again to\r\nlighten my woes; outside the prison he demanded justice and mercy for\r\nme, inside he sought to calm my grief, which seemed less poignant when\r\nhe assured me that he shared it.\" The lieutenant of police ordered the\r\nprisoner to be fed as well as formerly, and to be allowed his books,\r\npapers, knick-knacks, and the privilege of the two hours' walk he had\r\nenjoyed at Vincennes. In return for these kindnesses, the assistant\r\nsurgeon sent to the magistrate \"a remedy for the gout.\" He asked at the\r\nsame time to be allowed to breed little birds, whose chirping and lively\r\nmovements would divert him. The request was granted. But instead of\r\nbearing his lot with patience, Danry grew more and more irritable every\r\nday. He gave free rein to his violent temper, raised a hubbub, shrieked,\r\ntore up and down his room, so that they came perforce to believe that he\r\nwas going mad. On the books of the Bastille library, which circulated\r\nfrom room to room, he wrote ribald verses against the Marquise de\r\nPompadour. In this way he prolonged his sojourn in the cells. Gradually\r\nhis letters changed their tone. \"It is a little hard to be left for\r\nfourteen months in prison, a whole year of the time, ending to-day, in\r\none cell where I still am.\"\r\n\r\nThen Berryer put him back into a good room, about the end of the year\r\n1751. At the same time he gave him, at the king's expense, a servant to\r\nwait on him.\r\n\r\nAs to Annette Benoist, she had been set at liberty after a fortnight's\r\ndetention. Danry's servant fell sick; as there was no desire to deprive\r\nthe prisoner of society, he was given a companion. This was a certain\r\nAntoine Allègre, who had been there since May 29, 1750. The\r\ncircumstances which had led to his imprisonment were almost identical\r\nwith those to which Danry owed his confinement. Allègre was keeping a\r\nschool at Marseilles when he learnt that the enemies of the Marquise de\r\nPompadour were seeking to destroy her. He fabricated a story of a\r\nconspiracy in which he involved Maurepas, the Archbishop of Albi, and\r\nthe Bishop of Lodève; he sent a denunciation of this plot to Versailles,\r\nand, to give it some semblance of truth, addressed to the favourite's\r\nvalet a letter in disguised handwriting, beginning with these words: \"On\r\nthe word of a gentleman, there are 100,000 crowns for you if you poison\r\nyour mistress.\" He hoped by this means to obtain a good situation, or\r\nthe success of a business project he had in hand.\r\n\r\nIntelligent, with some education, and venturesome, Danry and Allègre\r\nwere just the men to get on well together, so much the better that the\r\nschoolmaster dominated the comrade to whom he was so much superior. The\r\nyears that Danry spent in company with Allègre exercised so great an\r\ninfluence on his whole life that the lieutenant of police, Lenoir, could\r\nsay one day: \"Danry is the second volume of Allègre.\" The letters of the\r\nlatter, a large number of which have been preserved, bear witness to the\r\noriginality and energy of his mind: their style is fine and fluent, of\r\nthe purest French; the ideas expressed have distinction and are\r\nsometimes remarkable without eccentricity. He worked untiringly, and was\r\nat first annoyed at the presence of a companion: \"Give me, I beg you, a\r\nroom to myself,\" he wrote to Berryer, \"even without a fire: I like being\r\nalone, I am sufficient for myself, because I can find things to do, and\r\nseed to sow for the future.\" His temperament was naturally mystical, but\r\nof that cold and acrid mysticism which we sometimes find in men of\r\nscience, and mathematicians in particular. For Allègre's principal\r\nstudies were mathematics, mechanics, and engineering. The lieutenant of\r\npolice procured for him works on fortification, architecture, mechanics,\r\nhydraulics. The prisoner used them to compile essays on the most diverse\r\nquestions, which he sent to the lieutenant of police in the hope of\r\ntheir procuring his liberation. Those essays which we possess show the\r\nextent of his intelligence and his education. Danry followed his example\r\nby-and-by, in this as in everything else, but clumsily. Allègre was\r\nalso very clever with his fingers, and could make, so the officials of\r\nthe château declared, whatever he pleased.\r\n\r\nAllègre was a dangerous man: the warders were afraid of him. Some time\r\nafter his entrance into the Bastille he fell ill, and a man was set to\r\nlook after him; the two men did not agree at all. Allègre sent complaint\r\nafter complaint to the lieutenant of police. An inquiry was made which\r\nturned out not unfavourable to the keeper, and he was left with the\r\nprisoner. One morning--September 8, 1751--the officers of the Bastille\r\nheard cries and clamour in the \"Well\" tower. Hastily ascending, they\r\nfound Allègre in the act of stabbing his companion, who lay on the floor\r\nheld down by the throat, wallowing in the blood that streamed from a\r\ngash in the stomach. If Allègre had not been in the Bastille, the\r\nParlement would have had him broken on the wheel in the Place de Grève:\r\nthe Bastille was his safety, though he could no longer hope for a speedy\r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nDanry, in his turn, wore out the patience of his guardians. Major\r\nChevalier, who was kindness itself, wrote to the lieutenant of police:\r\n\"He is no better than Allègre, but though more turbulent and choleric,\r\nhe is much less to be feared in every respect.\" The physician of the\r\nBastille, Dr. Boyer, a member of the Academy, wrote likewise: \"I have\r\ngood reason to distrust the man.\" The temper of Danry became embittered.\r\nHe began to revile the warders. One morning they were obliged to take\r\nfrom him a knife and other sharp instruments he had concealed. He used\r\nthe paper they gave him to open communications with other prisoners and\r\nwith people outside. Paper was withheld: he then wrote with his blood on\r\na handkerchief; he was forbidden by the lieutenant of police to write to\r\nhim with his blood, so he wrote on tablets made of bread crumbs, which\r\nhe passed out secretly between two plates.\r\n\r\nThe use of paper was then restored to him, which did not prevent him\r\nfrom writing to Berryer: \"My lord, I am writing to you with my blood on\r\nlinen, because the officers refuse me ink and paper; it is now more than\r\nsix times that I have asked in vain to speak to them. What are you\r\nabout, my lord? Do not drive me to extremities. At least, do not force\r\nme to be my own executioner. Send a sentry to break my head for me; that\r\nis the very least favour you can do me.\" Berryer, astonished at this\r\nmissive, remarked on it to the major, who replied: \"I have not refused\r\npaper to Danry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Beginning of a letter written with blood on linen by Danry (Latude)\r\n     while a prisoner at Vincennes, to Rougemont, the king's lieutenant.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSo the prisoner forced them more and more to the conclusion that he was\r\na madman. On October 13, 1753, he wrote to Dr. Quesnay to tell him that\r\nhe wished him well, but that being too poor to give him anything else,\r\nhe was making him a present of his body, which was on the point of\r\nperishing, for him to make a skeleton of. To the paper on which he\r\nwrote, Danry had sewn a little square of cloth, adding: \"God has given\r\nthe garments of martyrs the virtue of healing all manner of diseases. It\r\nis now fifty-seven months since I have been suffering an enforced\r\nmartyrdom. So there is no doubt that to-day the cloth of my coat will\r\nwork miracles; here is a bit for you.\" This letter was returned to the\r\nlieutenant of police in December, and on it we find a marginal note in\r\nBerryer's hand: \"A letter worth keeping, as it reveals the prisoner's\r\nmind.\" We know in what fashion madmen were wont to be treated in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, to the great astonishment of the officers of the château,\r\nour two friends amended their character and their conduct. No more\r\nnoises were heard in their room, and they answered politely anyone who\r\ncame to speak to them. But their behaviour was even more odd than ever.\r\nAllègre used to walk up and down the room half naked, \"to save his\r\ntoggery,\" he said, and he sent letter after letter to his brother and\r\nthe lieutenant of police, asking them to send him things, particularly\r\nshirts and handkerchiefs. Danry followed suit. \"This prisoner,\" wrote\r\nChevalier to the lieutenant of police, \"is asking for linen. I shall not\r\nmake a requisition, because he has seven very good shirts, four of them\r\nnew; he has shirts on the brain.\" But why decline to humour a prisoner's\r\nwhim? So the commissary of the Bastille had two dozen expensive shirts\r\nmade--every one cost twenty livres, more than thirty-three shillings of\r\nour money--and some handkerchiefs of the finest cambric.\r\n\r\nIf the wardrobe-keeper of the Bastille had kept her eyes open, she would\r\nhave noticed that the serviettes and cloths which went into the room of\r\nthe two companions were of much smaller dimensions when they came out.\r\nOur friends had established communication with their neighbours above\r\nand below, begging twine and thread from them and giving tobacco in\r\nexchange. They had succeeded in loosening the iron bars which prevented\r\nclimbing up the chimney; at night they used to mount to the platforms,\r\nwhence they conversed down the chimneys with prisoners in the other\r\ntowers. One of these hapless creatures believed himself to be a prophet\r\nof God; he heard at night the sound of a voice descending upon his cold\r\nhearth: he revealed the miracle to the officers, who only considered him\r\nstill more insane than before. On the terrace Allègre and Danry found\r\nthe tools left there in the evening by the masons and gardeners employed\r\nat the Bastille. Thus they got possession of a mallet, an auger, two\r\nsorts of pulleys, and some bits of iron taken from the gun-carriages.\r\nAll these they concealed in the hollow between the floor of their room\r\nand the ceiling of the room below.\r\n\r\nAllègre and Danry escaped from the Bastille on the night of February 25,\r\n1756. They climbed up the chimney till they reached the platform, and\r\ndescended by means of their famous rope ladder, fastened to a\r\ngun-carriage. A wall separated the Bastille moat from that of the\r\nArsenal. By the aid of an iron bar they succeeded in working out a large\r\nstone, and they escaped through the hole thus made. Their rope ladder\r\nwas a work of long patience and amazing skill. When in after days\r\nAllègre went mad, Danry appropriated the whole credit of this\r\nenterprise which his friend had conceived and directed.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of leaving, Allègre had written on a scrap of paper, for\r\nthe officers of the Bastille, the following note, which is an excellent\r\nindication of his character:--\r\n\r\n\"We have done no damage to the furniture of the governor, we have only\r\nmade use of a few rags of coverlets of no possible use; the others are\r\nleft just as they were. If some serviettes are missing, they will be\r\nfound at the bottom of the water in the great moat, whither we are\r\ntaking them to wipe our feet.\r\n\r\n\"_Non nobis, Domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam!_\r\n\r\n\"_Scito cor nostrum et cognosce semitas nostras._\"[46]\r\n\r\nOur two companions had provided themselves with a portmanteau, and they\r\nmade haste to change their clothes as soon as they had cleared the\r\nprecincts of the fortress. A foreman of works whom Danry knew interested\r\nhimself in them, and conducted them to one Rouit, a tailor, who lodged\r\nthem for some little time. Rouit even lent Danry forty-eight livres,\r\nwhich he promised to return as soon as he reached Brussels. At the end\r\nof a month our two friends were across the frontier.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to follow Danry's proceedings from the time when he\r\nleft Rouit to the moment of his reincarceration in the Bastille. He has\r\nleft, it is true, two accounts of his sojourn in Flanders and Holland;\r\nbut these accounts are themselves inconsistent, and both differ from\r\nsome original documents which remain to us.\r\n\r\nThe two fugitives had considered it advisable not to set out together.\r\nAllègre was the first to arrive at Brussels, whence he wrote an insolent\r\nletter to Madame de Pompadour. This letter led to his discovery. On\r\nreaching Brussels, Danry learnt that his friend had been arrested. He\r\nlost no time in making for Holland, and at Amsterdam he took service\r\nwith one Paul Melenteau. From Rotterdam he had written to his mother,\r\nand the poor creature, collecting her little savings, sent him 200\r\nlivres by post. But Saint-Marc had already struck on the track of the\r\nfugitive. \"The burgomaster of Amsterdam readily and gladly granted the\r\nrequest made by Saint-Marc on behalf of the king, through the\r\nambassador, for the arrest and extradition of Danry.\" Louis XV. confined\r\nhimself to claiming him as one of his subjects. Saint-Marc, disguised as\r\nan Armenian merchant, discovered him in his retreat. Danry was arrested\r\nin Amsterdam on June 1, 1756, conducted to a cell belonging to the town\r\nhall, and thence brought back to France and consigned to the Bastille on\r\nJune 9. Word came from Holland that Saint-Marc was there regarded as a\r\nsorcerer.\r\n\r\nBy his second escape the unhappy man had succeeded in making his case\r\nvery serious. In the eighteenth century, escape from a state prison was\r\npunishable with death. The English, great apostles of humanity as they\r\nwere, were no more lenient than the French; and everyone knows what\r\ntreatment was meted out by Frederick II. to Baron de Trenck. He was to\r\nhave remained in prison only one year; but after his second escape he\r\nwas chained up in a gloomy dungeon; at his feet was the grave in which\r\nhe was to be buried, and on it his name and a death's-head had been cut.\r\n\r\nThe government of Louis XV. did not punish with such rigour as this. The\r\nfugitive was simply put in the cells for a time. At the Bastille the\r\ncells were damp and chilly dungeons. Danry has left in his _Memoirs_ an\r\naccount of the forty months spent in this dismal place,--an account\r\nwhich makes one's hair stand on end; but it is packed full of\r\nexaggeration. He says that he spent three years with irons on his hands\r\nand feet: in November, 1756, Berryer offered to remove the irons from\r\neither hands or feet at his choice, and we see from a marginal note by\r\nMajor Chevalier that he chose the feet. Danry adds that he lay all\r\nthrough the winter on straw without any coverlet: he was actually so\r\nwell supplied with coverlets that he applied to Berryer for some others.\r\nTo believe him you would think that when the Seine was in flood the\r\nwater rose as high as his waist: as a fact, when the water threatened to\r\ninvade the cell, the prisoner was removed. Again, he says that he passed\r\nthere forty months in absolute darkness: the light of his prison was\r\ncertainly not very brilliant, but it was sufficient to enable him to\r\nread and write, and we learn from letters he sent to the lieutenant of\r\npolice that he saw from his cell all that went on in the courtyard of\r\nthe Bastille. Finally, he tells us of a variety of diseases he\r\ncontracted at the time, and cites in this connection the opinion of an\r\noculist who came to attend him. But this very report was forged by Danry\r\nhimself, and the rest he invented to match.\r\n\r\nIn this cell, where he professes to have been treated in so barbarous a\r\nmanner, Danry, however, proved difficult enough to deal with, as we\r\njudge from the reports of Chevalier. \"Danry has a thoroughly nasty\r\ntemper; he sends for us at eight o'clock in the morning, and asks us to\r\nsend warders to the market to buy him fish, saying that he never eats\r\neggs, artichokes, or spinach, and that he insists on eating fish; and\r\nwhen we refuse, he flies into a furious passion.\" That was on fast days;\r\non ordinary days it was the same. \"Danry swore like a trooper, that is,\r\nin his usual way, and after the performance said to me: 'Major, when you\r\ngive me a fowl, at least let it be stuffed!'\" He was not one of the\r\nvulgar herd, he said, \"one of those fellows you send to Bicêtre.\" And he\r\ndemanded to be treated in a manner befitting his condition.\r\n\r\nIt was just the same with regard to clothes. One is amazed at the sight\r\nof the lists of things the lieutenant of police got made for him. To\r\ngive him satisfaction, the administration did not stick at the most\r\nunreasonable expense, and it was by selling these clothes that Danry, at\r\nhis various escapes, procured a part of the money he was so much in\r\nneed of. He suffered from rheumatism, so they provided him with\r\ndressing-gowns lined with rabbit-skin, vests lined with silk plush,\r\ngloves and fur hats, and first-rate leather breeches. In his _Memoirs_\r\nDanry lumps all these as \"half-rotten rags.\" Rochebrune, the commissary\r\ncharged with the prisoners' supplies, was quite unable to satisfy him.\r\n\"You instructed me,\" he wrote to the major, \"to get a dressing-gown made\r\nfor the Sieur Danry, who asks for a calamanco with red stripes on a blue\r\nground. I have made inquiries for such stuff of a dozen tradesmen, who\r\nhave no such thing, and indeed would be precious careful not to have it,\r\nfor there is no sale for that kind of calamanco. I don't see why I\r\nshould satisfy the fantastic tastes of a prisoner who ought to be very\r\nwell pleased at having a dressing-gown that is warm and well-fitting.\"\r\nOn another occasion, the major writes: \"This man Danry has never up to\r\nthe present consented to accept the breeches that M. de Rochebrune got\r\nmade for him, though they are excellent, lined with good leather, with\r\nsilk garters, and in the best style.\" And Danry had his own pretty way\r\nof complaining. \"I beg you,\" he wrote to the governor, \"to have the\r\ngoodness to tell M. de Sartine in plain terms that the four\r\nhandkerchiefs he sent me are not fit to give to a galley-slave, and I\r\nwill not have them on any account; but that I request him kindly to give\r\nme six print handkerchiefs, blue, and large, and two muslin cravats.\" He\r\nadds, \"If there is no money in the treasury, go and ask Madame de\r\nPompadour for some.\"\r\n\r\nOne day Danry declared that something was wrong with his eyes.\r\nGrandjean, the king's oculist, came more than once to see him, ordered\r\naromatic fumigations for him, gave him ointments and eye-salve; but it\r\nwas soon seen that all that was wrong was that Danry desired to get a\r\nspy-glass, and to smuggle out, with the doctor's assistance, memoirs and\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1759, Danry was removed from the cells and placed in a\r\nmore airy chamber. He wrote at once to Bertin to thank him, and to tell\r\nhim that he was sending him two doves. \"You delight in doing good, and I\r\nshall have no less delight, my lord, if you favour me by accepting this\r\nslight mark of my great gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Tamerlaine allowed himself to be disarmed by a basket of figs presented\r\nto him by the inhabitants of a town he was proceeding to besiege. The\r\nMarquise de Pompadour is a Christian lady; I beg you to allow me to send\r\nher also a pair: perhaps she will allow her heart to be touched by these\r\ntwo innocent pigeons. I append a copy of the letter which will accompany\r\nthem:--\r\n\r\n     \"'MADAM,--Two pigeons used to come every day to pick grains out of\r\n     my straw; I kept them, and they gave me young ones. I venture to\r\n     take the liberty of presenting you with this pair as a mark of my\r\n     respect and affection. I beseech you in mercy to be good enough to\r\n     accept them, with as much pleasure as I have in offering them to\r\n     you. I have the honour to be, with the profoundest respect, Madam,\r\n     your very humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"'DANRY, for eleven years at the Bastille.'\"\r\n\r\nWhy did not Danry always make so charming a use of the permission\r\naccorded him to write to the minister, the lieutenant of police, Madame\r\nde Pompadour, Dr. Quesnay, and his mother? He wrote incessantly, and we\r\nhave letters of his in hundreds, widely differing one from another. Some\r\nare suppliant and pathetic: \"My body is wasting away every day in tears\r\nand blood, I am worn out.\" He writes to Madame de Pompadour:--\"Madam,--I\r\nhave never wished you anything but well; be then sensible to the voice\r\nof tears, of my innocence, and of a poor despairing mother of sixty-six\r\nyears. Madam, you are well aware of my martyrdom. I beg you in God's\r\nname to grant me my precious liberty; I am spent, I am dying, my blood\r\nis all on fire by reason of my groaning; twenty times in the night I am\r\nobliged to moisten my mouth and nostrils to get my breath.\" Everyone\r\nknows the famous letter beginning with the words, \"I have been suffering\r\nnow for 100,000 hours.\" He writes to Quesnay: \"I present myself to you\r\nwith a live coal upon my head, indicating my pressing necessity.\" The\r\nimages he uses are not always so happy: \"Listen,\" he says to Berryer,\r\n\"to the voice of the just bowels with which you are arrayed\"!\r\n\r\nIn other letters the prisoner alters his tone; to plaints succeed cries\r\nof rage and fury, \"he steeps his pen in the gall with which his soul is\r\nsaturated.\" He no longer supplicates, he threatens. There is nothing to\r\npraise in the style of these epistles: it is incorrect and vulgar,\r\nthough at times vigorous and coloured with vivid imagery. To the\r\nlieutenant of police he writes: \"When a man is to be punished in this\r\naccursed prison, the air is full of it, the punishments fall quicker\r\nthan the thunderbolt; but when it is a case of succouring a man who is\r\nunfortunate, I see nothing but crabs;\" and he addresses to him these\r\nlines of Voltaire:--\r\n\r\n    \"Perish those villains born, whose hearts of steel\r\n     No touch of ruth for others' woes can feel.\"\r\n\r\nHe predicts terrible retribution for the ministers, the magistrates, and\r\nMadame de Pompadour. To her he writes: \"You will see yourself one day\r\nlike that owl in the park of Versailles; all the birds cast water upon\r\nhim to choke him, to drown him; if the king chanced to die, before two\r\nhours were past someone would set five or six persons at your heels, and\r\nyou would yourself pack to the Bastille.\" The accused by degrees becomes\r\ntransformed into the accuser; he writes to Sartine: \"I am neither a dog\r\nnor a criminal, but a man like yourself.\" And the lieutenant of police,\r\ntaking pity on him, writes on one of these letters sent to the minister\r\nof Paris: \"When Danry writes thus, it is not that he is mad, but frantic\r\nfrom long imprisonment.\" The magistrate counsels the prisoner \"to keep\r\nout of his letters all bitterness, which can only do him harm.\" Bertin\r\ncorrected with his own hand the petitions Danry sent to the Marquise de\r\nPompadour; in the margin of one of them we read, \"I should think I was\r\nprejudicing him and his interests if I sent on to Madame de Pompadour a\r\nletter in which he ventures to reproach her with having _abused his good\r\nfaith and confidence_.\" Having amended the letter, the lieutenant of\r\npolice himself carried it to Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe years of captivity, far from humbling the prisoner and abasing his\r\npride, only made him the more arrogant; his audacity grew from day to\r\nday, and he was not afraid of speaking to the lieutenants of police\r\nthemselves, who knew his history, about his fortune which had been\r\nruined, his brilliant career which had been cut short, his whole family\r\nplunged into despair. At first the magistrate would shrug his shoulders;\r\ninsensibly he would be won over by these unwavering assertions, by this\r\naccent of conviction; and he ends actually by believing in this high\r\nbirth, this fortune, this genius, in all which Danry had perhaps come to\r\nbelieve himself. Then Danry takes a still higher tone: he claims not\r\nonly his freedom, but compensation, large sums of money, honours. But\r\none must not think that this sprang from a sordid sentiment unworthy of\r\nhim: \"If I propose compensation, my lord, it is not for the sake of\r\ngetting money, it is only so that I may smooth away all the obstacles\r\nwhich may delay the end of my long suffering.\"\r\n\r\nIn return, he is very ready to give the lieutenant of police some good\r\nadvice--to indicate the means of advancement in his career, to show him\r\nhow to set about getting appointed secretary of state, to compose for\r\nhim the speech he is to make to the king at his first audience. He adds:\r\n\"This very time is extremely favourable to you; it is the auspicious\r\nhour: profit by it. Before they take horse on the day of rejoicing for\r\nthe conclusion of peace, you ought to be a counsellor of state.\"\r\n\r\nHe is very ready also to send to the king schemes conceived in his\r\nprison for the welfare of the realm. Now it is a suggestion to give\r\nsergeants and officers on the battlefield muskets instead of spontoons\r\nand pikes, by which the French arms would be strengthened by 25,000 good\r\nfusiliers. Now it is a suggestion for increasing postal facilities,\r\nwhich would augment the resources of the Treasury by several millions\r\nevery year. He recommends the erection of public granaries in the\r\nprincipal towns, and draws up plans of battle for giving unheard-of\r\nstrength to a column of men three deep. We might mention other and\r\nbetter suggestions. These notions were drowned in a flood of words, an\r\nunimaginable wealth of verbiage, with parallels drawn from the history\r\nof all periods and every country. His manuscripts were illustrated with\r\npen and ink sketches. Danry copied and recopied them incessantly, sent\r\nthem to all and sundry in all sorts of forms, persuaded the sentinels\r\nthat these lofty conceptions intimately concerned the safety of the\r\nstate and would win him an immense fortune. Thus he induced these good\r\nfellows to compromise their situation by carrying the papers secretly to\r\nministers, members of the Parlement, marshals of France; he threw them\r\nfrom the windows of his room, and, wrapped in snowballs, from the top of\r\nthe towers. These memoirs are the work of a man whose open and active\r\nmind, of incredible activity indeed, plans, constructs, invents without\r\ncessation or repose.\r\n\r\nAmong these bundles of papers we have discovered a very touching letter\r\nfrom the prisoner's mother, Jeanneton Aubrespy, who wrote to her son\r\nfrom Montagnac on June 14, 1759:--\r\n\r\n     \"Do not do me the injustice of thinking that I have forgotten you,\r\n     my dear son, my loving son. Could I shut you out of my thoughts,\r\n     you whom I bear always in my heart? I have always had a great\r\n     longing to see you again, but to-day I long more than ever, I am\r\n     constantly concerned for you, I think of nothing but you, I am\r\n     wholly filled with you. Do not worry, my dear son; that is the only\r\n     favour I ask of you. Your misfortunes will come to an end, and\r\n     perhaps it is not far off. I hope that Madame de Pompadour will\r\n     pardon you; for that I am trying to win heaven and earth over to\r\n     your cause. The Lord is putting my submission and yours to a long\r\n     test, so as to make us better realize the worth of His favour. Do\r\n     not distress yourself, my son. I hope to have the happiness of\r\n     receiving you again, and of embracing you more tenderly than ever.\r\n     Adieu, my son, my dear son, my loving son, I love you, and I shall\r\n     love you dearly to the grave. I beg you to give me news of your\r\n     health. I am, and always shall be, your good mother,\r\n\r\nDAUBRESPI, _widow_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not this letter charming in its artless pathos? The son's reply is\r\nequally touching; but on reading it again one feels that it was to pass\r\nunder the eyes of the lieutenant of police; on examining it closely, one\r\nsees the sentiments grimacing between the lines.\r\n\r\nNo one knew better than Danry how to play on the souls of others, to\r\nawake in them, at his will, pity or tenderness, astonishment or\r\nadmiration. No one has surpassed him in the art, difficult in very\r\ntruth, of posing as a hero, a genius, and a martyr, a part that we shall\r\nsee him sustain for twenty years without faltering.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 there entered upon the office of lieutenant of police a man who\r\nwas henceforth to occupy Danry's mind almost exclusively--Gabriel de\r\nSartine. He was a fine sceptic, of amiable character and pleasing\r\nmanners. He was loved by the people of Paris, who boasted of his\r\nadministrative abilities and his spirit of justice. He exerted himself\r\nin his turn to render the years of captivity less cruel to Danry. \"He\r\nallowed me,\" writes the latter, \"what no other State prisoner has ever\r\nobtained, the privilege of walking along the top of the towers, in the\r\nopen air, to preserve my health.\" He cheered the prisoner with genial\r\nwords, and urged him to behave well and no longer to fill his letters\r\nwith insults. \"Your fate,\" he told him, \"is in your own hands.\" He\r\nlooked into Danry's scheme for the construction of public granaries, and\r\nwhen he had read it said, \"Really, there are excellent things, most\r\nexcellent things in it.\" He visited Danry in prison and promised to do\r\nhis utmost to obtain his liberation. He himself put into the hands of\r\nMadame de Pompadour the _Grand Mémoire_ which Danry had drawn up for\r\nher. In this memorial the prisoner told the favourite that in return for\r\na service he had rendered her in sending her a \"hieroglyphic symbol\" to\r\nput her on her guard against the machinations of her enemies, she had\r\ncaused him to suffer unjustly for twelve years. Moreover, he would now\r\nonly accept his freedom along with an indemnity of 60,000 livres. He\r\nadded: \"Be on your guard! When your prisoners get out and publish your\r\ncruelties abroad, they will make you hateful to heaven and the whole\r\nearth!\" It is not surprising that this _Grand Mémoire_ had practically\r\nno result. Sartine promised that he would renew his efforts on his\r\nbehalf. \"If, unhappily, you should meet with some resistance to the\r\nentreaties you are about to make for me,\" wrote Danry, \"I take the\r\nprecaution of sending you a copy of the scheme I sent to the king.\"\r\n(This was the memorial suggesting that muskets should be given to the\r\nofficers and sergeants.) \"Now the king has been putting my scheme in\r\noperation for five years or more, and he will continue to avail himself\r\nof it every time we are at war.\" Sartine proceeded to Versailles, this\r\nmarvellous scheme in his pocket. He showed it to the ministers and\r\npleaded on behalf of this protégé of his who, from the depths of his\r\ndungeon, was doing his country service. But on his return he wrote to\r\nthe major of the Bastille a note in regard to Danry, in which we read:\r\n\"They have not made use, as he believes, of his military scheme.\"\r\n\r\nDanry had asked several times to be sent to the colonies. In 1763 the\r\ngovernment was largely occupied with the colonization of La Désirade. We\r\nfind a letter of June 23, 1763, in which Sartine proposes to send Danry\r\nto La Désirade \"with an introduction to the commanding officer.\" But\r\nnothing came of these proposals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll his life, Danry sought to compass his ends by the aid of women. He\r\nwas well aware of all the tenderness and devotion there is in these\r\nlight heads; he knew that sentiment is always stronger in them than\r\nreason: \"I was always looking out for women, and wished to find young\r\nwomen, for their gentle and loving soul is more susceptible of pity;\r\nmisfortune moves them, stirs in them a more lively interest; their\r\nimpressionability is less quickly dulled, and so they are capable of\r\ngreater efforts.\"\r\n\r\nWhile taking his walk on the towers of the Bastille in the fresh morning\r\nair, he tried by means of gestures and signals to open relations with\r\nthe people of the neighbourhood. \"One day I noticed two young persons\r\nworking alone in a room, whose countenances struck me as pretty and\r\ngentle. I was not deceived. One of them having glanced in my direction,\r\nI wafted her with my hand a salutation which I endeavoured to make\r\nrespectful and becoming, whereupon she told her sister, who instantly\r\nlooked at me too. I then saluted them both in the same manner, and they\r\nreplied to me with an appearance of interest and kindliness. From that\r\nmoment we set up a sort of correspondence between us.\" The girls were\r\ntwo good-looking laundresses named Lebrun, the daughters of a wigmaker.\r\nAnd our rogue, the better to stimulate the little fools to enthusiastic\r\nservice in his behalf, knocked at the door of their young hearts,\r\nwilling enough to fly open. He spoke to them of youth, misfortune,\r\nlove--and also of his fortune, prodigious, he said, the half of which he\r\noffered them. Glowing with ardour, the girls spared for him neither\r\ntime, nor trouble, nor what little money they had.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had put them in possession of several of his schemes, among\r\nothers the military one, with letters for certain writers and persons of\r\nimportance, and in addition a \"terrible\" indictment of Madame de\r\nPompadour for the king, in which \"her birth and her shame, all her\r\nthefts and cruelties were laid bare.\" He begged the girls to have\r\nseveral copies made, which they were then to send to the addresses\r\nindicated. Soon large black crosses daubed on a neighbouring wall\r\ninformed the prisoner that his instructions had been carried out. Danry\r\nseems no longer to have doubted that his woes were coming to an end,\r\nthat the gates of the Bastille were about to fly open before him, and\r\nthat he would triumphantly leave the prison only to enter a palace of\r\nfortune: _Parta victoria!_[47] he exclaims in a burst of happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to one of the most extraordinary episodes in this strange\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1763, the Marquise of Pompadour was taken seriously ill.\r\n\"An officer of the Bastille came up to my room and said to me: 'Sir,\r\nwrite four words to the Marquise de Pompadour, and you may be sure that\r\nin less than a week you will have recovered your freedom.' I replied to\r\nthe major that prayers and tears only hardened the heart of that cruel\r\nwoman, and that I would not write to her. However, he came back next day\r\nwith the same story, and I replied in the same terms as on the previous\r\nday. Scarcely had he gone than Daragon, my warder, came into my room and\r\nsaid: 'Believe the major when he tells you that within a week you will\r\nbe free: if he tells you so, depend upon it he is sure of it.' Next day\r\nbut one the officer came to me for the third time: 'Why are you so\r\nobstinate?' I thanked him--it was Chevalier, major of the Bastille--for\r\nthe third time, telling him that I would sooner die than write again to\r\nthat implacable shrew.\r\n\r\n\"Six or eight days after, my two young ladies came and kissed their\r\nhands to me, at the same time displaying a roll of paper on which were\r\nwritten in large characters the words: 'Madame de Pompadour is dead!'\r\nThe Marquise de Pompadour died on April 19, 1764, and two months\r\nafterwards, on June 19, M. de Sartine came to the Bastille and gave me\r\nan audience; the first thing he said was that we would say no more about\r\nthe past, but that at the earliest moment he would go to Versailles and\r\ndemand of the minister the justice which was my due.\" And we find, in\r\ntruth, among the papers of the lieutenant of police, the following note,\r\ndated June 18, 1764: \"M. Duval (one of the lieutenant's secretaries)--to\r\npropose at the first inspection that Danry be liberated and exiled to\r\nhis own part of the country.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to his room, Danry reflected on these developments; for the\r\nlieutenant of police to show so much anxiety for his liberation was\r\nevidently a sign that he was afraid of him, and that his memorials had\r\nreached their destination and achieved their end. But he would be a\r\ngreat ass to be satisfied with a mere liberation: \"100,000 livres\" would\r\nscarcely suffice to throw oblivion over the injustices with which he had\r\nbeen overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nHe revolved these thoughts in his head for several days. To accept\r\nfreedom at the hands of his persecutors would be to pardon the past, a\r\nmistake he would never fall into. The door opened, the major entered,\r\nbearing in his hand a note written by de Sartine: \"You will tell County\r\nNumber 4 that I am working for his effectual liberation.\" The officer\r\nwent out; Danry immediately sat down at his table and wrote to the\r\nlieutenant of police a letter replete with threats, insults, and\r\nobscenity. The original is lost, but we have an abstract made by Danry\r\nhimself. He concluded with leaving to Sartine a choice: \"he was either a\r\nmere lunatic, or else had allowed himself to be corrupted like a villain\r\nby the gold of the Marquis de Marigny, the Marquise de Pompadour's\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Sartine received my letter, he wrote an answer which the major\r\nbrought and read to me, in which these were his very words: that I was\r\nwrong to impute to him the length of my imprisonment, that if he had had\r\nhis way I should long ago have been set free; and he ended by telling me\r\nthat there was Bedlam for the mad. On which I said to the major: 'We\r\nshall see in a few days whether he will have the power to put me in\r\nBedlam.' He did not deprive me of my walk on the towers; nine days\r\nafter, he put me in the cells on bread and water.\" But Danry was not\r\neasily put out. No doubt they were only meaning to put his assurance to\r\nthe test. He went down to his cell singing, and for several days\r\ncontinued to manifest the most confident gaiety.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the prisoner made himself insufferable to his\r\nguardians. It was yells and violence from morning to night. He filled\r\nthe whole Bastille with bursts of his \"voice of thunder.\" Major\r\nChevalier wrote to Sartine: \"This prisoner would wear out the patience\r\nof the saintliest monk\"; again: \"He is full of gall and bitterness, he\r\nis poison pure and simple\"; once more: \"This prisoner is raving mad.\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of police suggested to Saint-Florentin, the minister, to\r\ntransfer Danry to the keep of Vincennes. He was conducted there on the\r\nnight of September 15, 1764. We are now entering on a new phase of his\r\nlife. We shall find him still more wretched than in the past, but\r\nconstantly swelling his demands and pretensions, and with reason, for he\r\nis now, mark you, a nobleman! He had learnt from a sentinel of the\r\nBastille of the death of Henri Vissec de la Tude, lieutenant-colonel of\r\na dragoon regiment, who had died at Sedan on January 31, 1761. From that\r\nday he determined that he was the son of that officer. And what were his\r\nreasons? Vissec de la Tude was from his own part of the country, he was\r\na nobleman and rich, and he was dead. These arguments Danry considered\r\nexcellent. He was, however, in complete ignorance of all that concerned\r\nhis father and his new family; he did not know even the name \"Vissec de\r\nla Tude,\" of which he made \"Masers de la Tude\"; Masers was the name of\r\nan estate belonging to Baron de Fontès, a relation of Henri de Vissec.\r\nThe latter was not a marquis, as Danry believed, but simply a chevalier;\r\nhe died leaving six sons, whilst Danry represents him as dying without\r\nissue. It goes without saying that all that our hero relates about his\r\nfather in his _Memoirs_ is pure invention. The Chevalier de la Tude\r\nnever knew of the existence of the son of Jeanneton Aubrespy, and when\r\nin later years Danry asked the children to recognize him as their\r\nnatural brother, his pretensions were rejected. Nevertheless our\r\ngentleman will henceforth sign his letters and memoirs \"Danry, or rather\r\nHenri Masers d'Aubrespy,\" then \"de Masers d'Aubrespy,\" then \"de Masers\r\nde la Tude.\" When Danry had once got an idea in his head, he never let\r\nit go. He repeated it unceasingly until he had forced it upon the\r\nconviction of all about him--pertinacity which cannot fail to excite our\r\nadmiration. In the patent of Danry's pension of 400 livres granted by\r\nLouis XVI. in 1784, the king calls the son of poor Jeanneton \"Vicomte\r\nMasers de la Tude.\"\r\n\r\nAs may well be imagined, the Vicomte de la Tude could not accept his\r\nliberty on the same terms as Danry. The latter would have been satisfied\r\nwith 60,000 livres: the viscount demands 150,000 and the cross of St.\r\nLouis to boot. So he writes to the lieutenant of police. Sartine was too\r\nsensible a man to be long obdurate to the prisoner on account of these\r\nextravagances. \"I was transferred to the keep of Vincennes on the night\r\nof September 15, 1764. About nine hours after, the late M. de Guyonnet,\r\nking's lieutenant, came and saw me in the presence of the major and the\r\nthree warders, and said: 'M. de Sartine has instructed me to inform you,\r\non his behalf, that provided you behave yourself quietly for a short\r\ntime, he will set you free. You have written him a very violent letter,\r\nand you must apologize for it.'\" Danry adds: \"When all is said and done,\r\nM. de Sartine did treat me well.\" He granted him for two hours every day\r\n\"the extraordinary promenade of the moats.\" \"When a lieutenant of\r\npolice,\" says Danry, \"granted this privilege to a prisoner, it was with\r\nthe object of promptly setting him free.\" On November 23, 1765, Danry\r\nwas walking thus, in company with a sentinel, outside the keep. The fog\r\nwas dense. Turning suddenly towards his keeper, Danry said, \"What do you\r\nthink of this weather?\" \"It's very bad.\" \"Well, it's just the weather to\r\nescape in.\" He took five paces and was out of sight. \"I escaped from\r\nVincennes,\" writes Danry, \"without trickery; an ox would have managed it\r\nas well.\" But in the speech he delivered later in the National Assembly,\r\nthe matter took a new complexion. \"Think,\" he cried, \"of the unfortunate\r\nLatude, in his third escape, pursued by twenty soldiers, and yet\r\nstopping and disarming under their very eyes the sentinel who had taken\r\naim at him!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Latude was at large, he found himself without resources, as at his\r\nfirst escape. \"I escaped with my feet in slippers and not a sou in my\r\npocket; I hadn't a thing to bless myself with.\" He took refuge with his\r\nyoung friends, the Misses Lebrun.\r\n\r\nIn their keeping he found a part of his papers, plans and projects,\r\nmemorials and dissertations. He sent \"a basketful\" of these to Marshal\r\nde Noailles, begging him to continue to honour him with his protection,\r\nand imparting to him \"four great discoveries he had just made; first,\r\nthe true cause of the tides; secondly, the true cause of mountains, but\r\nfor which the globe would be brought to a standstill and become\r\nspeedily vitrified; thirdly, the cause of the ceaseless turning of the\r\nglobe; fourthly, the cause of the saltness of sea-water.\" He wrote also\r\nto the Duke de Choiseul, minister of war, in order to obtain a reward\r\nfor his military scheme; he wrote making overtures of peace to Sartine:\r\nin return for an advance of 10,000 crowns of the 150,000 livres due to\r\nhim, he would overlook the past: \"I was resolved,\" he says, \"to stake\r\nall on one cast.\" In reply, he received a letter naming a house where he\r\nwould find 1200 livres obtained for him by Dr. Quesnay. He proceeded to\r\nthe address indicated--and was there captured.\r\n\r\nHe was at once taken back to Vincennes. He declares that he was about to\r\nbe set at liberty at the moment of his escape: and now a new detention\r\nwas commencing. We shall not relate in detail the life he was now to\r\nlead. Materially he continued to be well treated, but his mind became\r\naffected, his rages became more and more violent, reaching at last\r\nparoxysms of fury. Here are some extracts from letters and memorials\r\nsent to Sartine: \"By all the devils, this is coming it too strong. It is\r\ntrue, sir, that I'd defy the blackest devils in all hell to teach you\r\nanything in the way of cruelty; and that's but poor praise for you.\" He\r\nwrites on another occasion: \"The crime of every one of us is to have\r\nseen through your villainies: we are to perish, are we? how delighted\r\nyou would be if some one told you that we had all strangled ourselves in\r\nour cells!\" Danry reminds the lieutenant of police of the tortures of\r\nEnguerrand de Marigni, adding: \"Remember that more than a thousand\r\nwretches have been broken in the Place de Grève who had not committed\r\nthe hundredth part of your crimes.\"... \"Not a single person would be\r\nastonished to see you flayed alive, your skin tanned, and your carcase\r\nthrown into the gutters for the dogs to eat.\"... \"But Monsieur laughs\r\nat everything, Monsieur fears neither God, nor king, nor devil, Monsieur\r\nswills down his crimes like buttermilk!\"\r\n\r\nIn prison Latude wrote memoirs which he filled with calumnies on the\r\nministers and the court. These memoirs are composed in the most dramatic\r\nstyle, with an inimitable accent of sincerity. It was known that the\r\nprisoner found a thousand means of sending them outside the walls, and\r\nit was feared that they might be circulated among the populace, whose\r\nminds--the year is 1775--were beginning to ferment. Latude had just been\r\nflung into a cell in consequence of a fresh outbreak against his\r\njailers. \"On March 19, 1775, the king's lieutenant entered, accompanied\r\nby the major and three warders, and said to me: 'I have obtained leave\r\nto let you out of the cell, but on one condition: that you hand over\r\nyour papers.'\r\n\r\n\"'Hand over my papers! I tell you, sir, I'd rather be done to death in\r\nthis cell than show the white feather so!'\r\n\r\n\"'Your trunk is upstairs in your room: I've only to say the word and the\r\nseals would be broken and your papers taken out.'\r\n\r\n\"I replied: 'Sir, justice has formalities to which you are bound to\r\nconform, and you are not allowed to commit such outrages.'\r\n\r\n\"He took five or six steps out of the cell, and as I did not call him\r\nback, he came back himself and said: 'Just hand them to me for ten days\r\nto examine them, and I give you my word of honour that at the end of\r\nthat time I will have them returned to your room.'\r\n\r\n\"I replied: 'I will not let you have them for two hours even.'\r\n\r\n\"'All right,' he said; 'as you won't entrust them to me, you have only\r\nto stay where you are.'\"\r\n\r\nLatude relates in his _Memoirs_ with great indignation the story of a\r\nflute he had made, on which he used to play, his sole diversion during\r\nthe long hours of solitude; his jailers had the barbarity to take it\r\nfrom him. The governor of the fortress, out of compassion, offered to\r\nrestore it. \"But it will only be on condition that you play by day only,\r\nand not at night.\" At this stipulation, writes Latude in his _Rêveries_,\r\n\"I could not refrain from bantering him, saying, 'Why, don't you know,\r\nsir, that forbidding a thing is just the way to make me eager for it?'\"\r\n\r\nAnd so at Vincennes as at Paris they came to consider Danry as a madman.\r\nAmong the books given him for his amusement there were some dealing with\r\nsorcery. These he read and re-read, and from that time onward he saw in\r\nall the incidents of his life nothing but the perpetual intervention of\r\ndevils evoked by the witch Madame de Pompadour and her brother the\r\nmagician, the Marquis de Marigny.\r\n\r\nSartine came again to see the prisoner on November 8, 1772. Danry begged\r\nhim to send a police officer to make a copy of a memorial he had drawn\r\nup for his own justification; to send also an advocate to assist him\r\nwith his advice, and a doctor, to examine the state of his health. The\r\npolice officer arrived on the 24th. On the 29th, he wrote to the\r\nlieutenant of police: \"I have the honour to report that in pursuance of\r\nyour orders I proceeded to the château of Vincennes on the 24th curt.,\r\nto hear from Danry something which, he asserts, concerns the minister:\r\nit is impossible to hear anything which concerns him less. He began by\r\nsaying that to write all he had to tell me I should have to remain for\r\nthree weeks with him. He was bound to tell me the story of 180\r\nsorceries, and I was to copy the story, according to him, from a heap of\r\npapers he drew from a bag, the writing of which is undecipherable.\"\r\n\r\nWe know from Danry himself what passed at the visit of the advocate. He\r\nentered the prisoner's room about noon. Danry handed him two memorials\r\nhe had drawn up and explained their purport. \"Instantly he cut me short,\r\nsaying, 'Sir, I have no belief whatever in witchcraft.' I did not give\r\nin, but said, 'Sir, I cannot show you the devil in bodily shape, but I\r\nam very certain I can convince you, by the contents of this memorial,\r\nthat the late Marquise de Pompadour was a witch, and that the Marquis de\r\nMarigny, her brother, is at this very time still having dealings with\r\nthe devil.'\r\n\r\n\"The advocate had read but a few pages when he stopped dead, put the\r\nmanuscript on the table, and said, as though he had been wakened out of\r\na deep sleep, 'Would you not like to get out of prison?' I replied:\r\n'There's no doubt of that.' 'And do you intend to remain in Paris, or to\r\ngo to your home?' 'When I am free, I shall go home.' 'But have you any\r\nmeans?' Upon this I took his hand and said: 'My dear sir, I beg you not\r\nto take offence at what I am going to say.' 'Speak on,' he said, 'say\r\nwhatever you like, I shall not be offended.' 'Well then, I see very\r\nclearly that the devil has already got hold of you.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Malesherbes made his celebrated inspection of the\r\nprisons. \"This virtuous minister came to see me at the beginning of\r\nAugust, 1775, and listened to me with the most lively interest.\" The\r\nhistorian who has the completest knowledge of everything relating to the\r\nBastille, François Ravaisson, believed that Malesherbes left the\r\nwretched man in prison out of regard for his colleague Maurepas. \"One\r\nwould have thought that Maurepas' first act on resuming office would\r\nhave been to release his old accomplice.\" This conjecture is destroyed\r\nby a letter from Malesherbes to the governor of Vincennes: \"I am busy,\r\nsir, with the examination of the papers relating to your various\r\nprisoners. Danry, Thorin, and Maréchal are quite mad, according to the\r\nparticulars furnished to me, and the two first gave indubitable marks\r\nof madness in my presence.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence, Danry was transferred to Charenton on September 27,\r\n1775, \"on account of mental derangement, in virtue of a royal order of\r\nthe 23rd of the said month, countersigned by Lamoignon. The king will\r\npay for his keep.\" On entering his new abode, Latude took the precaution\r\nto change his name a third time, and signed the register \"Danger.\"\r\n\r\nIn passing from the fortress of Vincennes to the hospital of Charenton,\r\nDanry thought it was as well to rise still higher in dignity. So we see\r\nhim henceforth styling himself \"engineer, geographer, and royal\r\npensioner at Charenton.\"\r\n\r\nHis situation was sensibly changed for the better. He speaks of the\r\nkindnesses shown him by the Fathers of La Charité.[48] He had companions\r\nwhose society pleased him. Halls were set apart for billiards,\r\nbackgammon, and cards. He had company at his meals and in his walks. He\r\nmet Allègre, his old fellow-prisoner, whom he came upon among the\r\ndangerous lunatics in the dungeons; Allègre had been removed in 1763\r\nfrom the Bastille, where he was shattering and destroying everything.\r\nHis latest fancy was that he was God. As to Danry, he had taken so\r\nkindly to his rôle as nobleman that to see his aristocratic and\r\nwell-to-do air, to hear his conversation, full of reminiscences of his\r\nfamily and his early life, no one could have doubted that he actually\r\nwas the brilliant engineer officer he set up for, who had fallen in the\r\nprime of life a victim to the intrigues of the favourite. He hobnobbed\r\nwith the aristocratic section of society at Charenton and struck up an\r\nintimacy with one of his associates, the Chevalier de Moyria, son of a\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and a knight of Saint-Louis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Parlement, which sent a commission every year to inspect\r\nthe Charenton asylum--a commission before which Danry appeared on two\r\nseparate occasions--did not decide that he ought to be set at liberty.\r\nBut one fine day in September, 1776, the prior of the Fathers, who took\r\na quite exceptional interest in the lot of his pensioner, meeting him in\r\nthe garden, said to him abruptly: \"We are expecting a visit from the\r\nlieutenant of police; get ready a short and taking address to say to\r\nhim.\" The lieutenant of police, Lenoir, saw Danry, and listened to him\r\nattentively, and as the prior's account of him was entirely favourable,\r\nthe magistrate promised him his liberty. \"Then Father Prudentius, my\r\nconfessor, who was behind me, drew me by the arm to get me away, fearing\r\nlest, by some imprudent word, I might undo the good that had been\r\ndecided on\"--a charming incident, much to the honour of Father\r\nPrudentius.\r\n\r\nBut on consideration it appeared dangerous to fling so suddenly upon\r\nsociety a man who would be at a loss how to live, having neither\r\nrelatives nor fortune, having no longer the means of gaining a\r\nlivelihood, and a man, moreover, whom there was only too much reason to\r\nmistrust. Lenoir asked the prisoner if, once set at liberty, he would\r\nfind the wherewithal to assure his existence; if he had any property; if\r\nhe could give the names of any persons willing to go bail for him.\r\n\r\nWhat did this mean--_if_ he had any property, _if_ he could find\r\nsureties? He, Masers de Latude! Why, his whole family, when the Marquise\r\nde Pompadour had him put in the Bastille, was occupying a brilliant\r\nposition! Why, his mother, of whose death he had had the agony to hear,\r\nhad left a house and considerable estates! Latude took his pen, and\r\nwithout hesitation wrote to M. Caillet, royal notary at Montagnac: \"My\r\ndear friend, I would bet ten to one you believe me dead; see how\r\nmistaken you are!... You have but to say the word and before the\r\ncarnival is over we shall eat a capital leveret together.\" And he speaks\r\nto his friend the notary of the fortune left by his mother, and of his\r\nfamily, who all of them cannot fail to be interested in him. Latude\r\nhimself was not greatly astonished at receiving no reply to this\r\nepistle: but it must have passed under the eyes of the lieutenant of\r\npolice, and what more did he want?\r\n\r\nLatude's new friend, the Chevalier de Moyria, had already been for some\r\ntime at liberty. The prisoner hastened to send him a copy of his letter\r\nto the notary. \"The reply is a long time coming, M. Caillet is dead,\r\ndoubtless.\" What is to become of him? These twenty-eight years of\r\ncaptivity have endangered his fortune, have made him lose his friends;\r\nhow is he to find the remnant of his scattered family? Happily there\r\nremains to him a friendship, a friendship still recent, but already\r\nstrong, in which he places his whole confidence. \"Chevalier, it would\r\nonly need your intervention to deliver me, by inducing your good mother\r\nto write to M. Lenoir.\" The Chevalier de Moyria sent an amiable reply.\r\nDanry wrote another and more urgent letter, with such success that not\r\nonly the Chevalier's mother, but also an old friend of the Moyria\r\nfamily, Mercier de Saint-Vigor, a colonel, and controller-general of the\r\nqueen's household, intervened, and made applications at Versailles. \"On\r\nJune 5, 1777, King Louis XVI. restored to me my freedom; I have in my\r\npocket the warrant under his own hand!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn leaving Charenton, Danry signed an undertaking to depart immediately\r\nfor Languedoc, an undertaking which he did not trouble to fulfil. Paris\r\nwas the only city in France where a man of his stamp could thrive. He\r\nwas now fifty-two years old, but was still youthful in appearance, full\r\nof go and vigour; his hair, as abundant as it had been in youth, had not\r\nbecome white. He soon found means of borrowing some money, and then we\r\nsee him opening a campaign, exerting himself to get in touch with the\r\nministers, gaining the protection of the Prince de Beauvau, distributing\r\nmemorials in which he claimed a reward for great services rendered, and\r\nlaunched out into invectives against his oppressors, Sartine in\r\nparticular. Minister Amelot sent for him, and in tones of severity\r\nnotified him that he was to leave the city at once. Latude did not wait\r\nfor the command to be repeated. He had reached Saint-Bris, about a\r\nhundred miles from the capital, when he was suddenly arrested by the\r\npolice officer Marais. Brought back to Paris, he was locked up in the\r\nChâtelet on July 16, 1777, and on August 1 conducted to Bicêtre. The\r\nfirst use he had made of his liberty was to introduce himself to a lady\r\nof quality and extort money from her by menaces. The officer found a\r\nconsiderable sum in his possession.\r\n\r\nBicêtre was not a state prison like the Bastille and Vincennes, or an\r\nasylum like Charenton; it was the thieves' prison. On entering, Danry\r\ntook the precaution of changing his name a fourth time, calling himself\r\nJedor. He is, moreover, careful in his _Memoirs_ to give us the reason\r\nof this fresh metamorphosis: \"I would not sully my father's name by\r\ninscribing it on the register of this infamous place.\" From this day\r\nthere begins for him a truly wretched existence; huddled with criminals,\r\nput on bread and water, his lodging is a cell. But his long martyrdom is\r\nnearing its end: the hour of his apotheosis is at hand!\r\n\r\nLouis XVI. had now been on the throne for several years, and France had\r\nbecome the most impressionable country in the world. Tears flowed at the\r\nslightest provocation. Was it the sentimental literature, which Rousseau\r\nmade fashionable, that produced this moving result, or contrariwise, was\r\nthe literature successful because it hit the taste of the day? At all\r\nevents, the time was ripe for Latude. His recent unlucky experience was\r\nnot to dishearten him. On the contrary, it is with a greater energy, a\r\nmore poignant emotion, and cries still more heartrending, that he\r\nresumes the story of his interminable sufferings. The victim of cruel\r\noppressors, of cowardly foes who have their own reasons for smothering\r\nhis voice, he will not bend his head under his abominable treatment; he\r\nwill remain proud, self-assured, erect before those who load him with\r\nirons!\r\n\r\nOn the birth of the Dauphin, Louis XVI. resolved to admit his wretched\r\nprisoners to a share of his joy and to pronounce a great number of\r\npardons. A special commission, composed of eight counsellors of the\r\nChâtelet and presided over by Cardinal de Rohan, sat at Bicêtre. Danry\r\nappeared before it on May 17, 1782. His new judges, as he testifies,\r\nheard his story with interest. But the decision of the commission was\r\nnot favourable to him. He was not so much surprised at this as might be\r\nsupposed: \"The impure breath of vice,\" he wrote to the Marquis de\r\nConflans, \"has never tainted my heart, but there are magistrates who\r\nwould let off guilty men with free pardons rather than expose themselves\r\nto the merited reproach of having committed injustice of the most\r\nrevolting kind in keeping innocence for thirty-three years in irons.\"\r\n\r\nGiving rein to the marvellous activity of his brain, he composed at\r\nBicêtre new schemes, memorials, and accounts of his misfortunes. To the\r\nMarquis de Conflans he sends a scheme for a hydraulic press, \"the\r\nhomage of an unfortunate nobleman who has grown old in irons\"; he\r\ninduces the turnkeys to carry memorials to all who may possibly interest\r\nthemselves in him. The first to take compassion on him was a priest, the\r\nAbbé Legal, of the parish of St. Roch, and curate of Bicêtre. He visited\r\nhim, consoled him, gave him money, showed him attentions. Cardinal de\r\nRohan also took much interest in him, and sent him some assistance\r\nthrough his secretary. We are coming at last to Madame Legros. This\r\nwonderful story is so well known that we shall tell it briefly. A\r\ndrunken turnkey chanced to lose one of Latude's memorials at a corner of\r\nthe Rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois: it was picked up and\r\nopened by a woman, a haberdasher in a small way. Her heart burned within\r\nher as she read of these horrible sufferings, depicted in strokes of\r\nfire. She inspired her husband with her own emotion; henceforth it was\r\nto be the aim in life of these worthy people to effect the unhappy man's\r\ndeliverance, and Madame Legros devoted herself to the self-imposed task\r\nwith indefatigable ardour, courage, and devotion. \"A grand sight,\" cries\r\nMichelet, \"to see this poor, ill-clad woman going from door to door,\r\npaying court to footmen to win entrance into mansions, to plead her\r\ncause before the great, to implore their support!\" In many houses she\r\nwas well received. President de Gourgues, President de Lamoignon,\r\nCardinal de Rohan, aided her with their influence. Sartine himself took\r\nsteps on behalf of the unhappy man. Two advocates of the Parlement of\r\nParis, Lacroix and Comeyras, devoted themselves to his cause. Copies\r\nwere made of the prisoner's memorials and distributed in every\r\ndrawing-room; they penetrated even into the boudoir of the queen. All\r\nhearts were stirred by the accents of this harrowing voice.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Villette, who had become celebrated through the\r\nhospitality he showed to Voltaire when dying, conceived a passionate\r\nenthusiasm for Danry. He sent his steward to Bicêtre to offer him a\r\npension of 600 livres on the sole condition of the prisoner's leaving\r\nhis case entirely in the Marquis's hands. Latude received this singular\r\nproposal with becoming dignity. \"For two years a poor woman has been\r\ndevoting herself to my cause. I should be an ungrateful wretch if I did\r\nnot leave my fate in her hands.\" He knew that this pension would not\r\nescape him, and it was not for 600 livres that he would have consented\r\nto rob his story of the touching and romantic features it was\r\nincreasingly assuming.\r\n\r\nFurther, the French Academy actually intervenes! D'Alembert is all fire\r\nand flame. From this time a stream of visitors of the highest\r\ndistinction flows through the squalid prison. At length the king himself\r\nis led to look into the affair. He has the documentary evidence brought\r\nto him and examines it carefully. With what anxiety everyone awaits his\r\ndecision! But Louis XVI., now acquainted with the case, replies that\r\nLatude will be released--_never_! At this decree, to all appearance\r\nirrevocable, all the prisoner's friends lose heart, except Madame\r\nLegros. The queen and Madame Necker are on her side. In 1783, Breteuil,\r\nthe queen's man, comes into power; on March 24, 1784, the release is\r\nsigned! The Vicomte de Latude receives a pension of 400 livres, but is\r\nexiled to his own part of the country. New importunities, new\r\napplications; at last they succeed: Latude is free to live in Paris!\r\n\r\nThis is the grandest period in the life of a great man! Latude is soon\r\nin occupation of a modest but decent and well-ordered suite of rooms on\r\nthe fourth floor. He lives with his two benefactors, M. and Madame\r\nLegros, petted, spoilt in a thousand ways. The Duchess of Beauvau has\r\nobtained for Madame Legros from Calonne, out of funds intended for the\r\nsupport of distressed gentlefolk, a pension of 600 livres: the Duchess\r\nof Kingston[49] grants a pension of the same amount. In addition to the\r\nroyal pension, Latude receives 500 livres a year from President Dupaty\r\nand 300 from the Duke d'Ayen. Moreover, a public subscription is opened,\r\nand the list is filled with the greatest names in France. An agreeable\r\ncompetency is assured to the Legros couple and their adopted son. At its\r\nsitting on March 24, the French Academy solemnly awarded the Montyon\r\nprize to the valiant little haberdasher. \"The Dame Legros came to\r\nreceive the medal amid the acclamations of the whole assembly.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Latude is on everyone's lips; he wins admiration and pity on\r\nall sides. Ladies of the highest society are not above mounting to the\r\nfourth story, accompanied by their daughters, to bring the poor man \"aid\r\nin money, with their tears.\" The hero has left a complacent description\r\nof the throng: duchesses, marchionesses, grandees of Spain, wearers of\r\nthe cross of St. Louis, presidents of the Parlement, all these met at\r\nhis house. Sometimes there were six or eight persons in his room.\r\nEveryone listened to his story and lavished on him marks of the most\r\naffectionate compassion, and no one failed before going away \"to leave a\r\nmark of his sensibility.\" The wives of Marshals de Luxembourg and de\r\nBeauvau, the Duchess de la Rochefoucauld, the Countess de Guimont, were\r\namong the most zealous. \"Indeed,\" says our hero, \"it would be extremely\r\ndifficult for me to tell which of these countesses, marchionesses,\r\nduchesses, and princesses had the most humane, the most compassionate\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nThus Latude became one of the lions of Paris: strangers flocked to his\r\nlodging, hostesses ran off with him. At table, when he spoke, all voices\r\nwere hushed with an air of deference and respect; in the drawing-room\r\nyou would find him seated in a gilt chair near the fireplace where great\r\nlogs were blazing, and surrounded by a thick cluster of bright, silky,\r\nrustling robes. The Chevalier de Pougens, son of the Prince de Conti,\r\npressed him to come and stay at his house; Latude graciously consented.\r\nThe American ambassador, the illustrious Jefferson, invited him to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nLatude has himself described this enchanted life: \"Since I left prison,\r\nthe greatest lords of France have done me the honour of inviting me to\r\neat with them, but I have not found a single house--except that of the\r\nComte d'Angevillier, where you could meet men of wit and learning in\r\nscores, and receive all sorts of civilities on the part of the countess;\r\nand that of M. Guillemot, keeper of the royal palaces, one of the most\r\ncharming families to be found in Paris--where you are more at your ease\r\nthan with the Marquis de Villette.\r\n\r\n\"When a man has felt, as I have felt, the rage of hunger, he always\r\nbegins by speaking of his food. The Marquis de Villette possesses a cook\r\nwho is a match for the most skilful in his art: in a word, his table is\r\nfirst-rate. At the tables of the dukes and peers and marshals of France\r\nthere is eternal ceremony, and everyone speaks like a book, whereas at\r\nthat of the Marquis de Villette, men of wit and learning always form the\r\nmajority of the company. All the first-class musicians have a cover set\r\nat his table, and on at least three days of the week he gives a little\r\nconcert.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1788, died one of the benefactresses of Latude, the\r\nDuchess of Kingston, who did not fail to mention her protégé in her\r\nwill. We see him dutifully assisting at the sale of the lady's furniture\r\nand effects. He even bought a few things, giving a _louis d' or_ in\r\npayment. Next day, the sale being continued, the auctioneer handed the\r\ncoin back to Latude: it was bad. Bad! What! did they take the Vicomte de\r\nLatude for a sharper? The coin bad! Who, he would like to know, had the\r\ninsolence to make \"an accusation so derogatory to his honour and his\r\nreputation?\" Latude raised his voice, and the auctioneer threatened to\r\nbundle him out of the room. The insolent dog! \"Bundle out rogues, not\r\ngentlemen!\" But the auctioneer sent for the police, who put \"the Sieur\r\nde Latude ignominiously outside.\" He went off calmly, and the same day\r\nsummoned the auctioneer before the Châtelet tribunal, \"in order to get a\r\nreparation as authoritative as the defamation had been public.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1789) Latude made a journey into England. He had\r\ntaken steps to sue Sartine, Lenoir, and the heirs of Madame de Pompadour\r\nin the courts in order to obtain the damages due to him. In England, he\r\ndrew up a memorandum for Sartine, in which he informed the late\r\nlieutenant of police of the conditions on which he would withdraw his\r\nactions. \"M. de Sartine, you will give me, as compensation for all the\r\nharm and damage you have made me suffer unjustly, the sum of 900,000\r\nlivres; M. Lenoir, 600,000 livres; the heirs of the late Marquise de\r\nPompadour and Marquis de Menars, 100,000 crowns; in all, 1,800,000\r\nlivres;\" that is to say, about £160,000 in English money of to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATUDE.\r\n\r\n_From the Painting by Vestier (Hôtel Carnavalet)._]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution broke out. If the epoch of Louis XVI., with its mildness\r\nand fellow-feeling, had been favourable to our hero, the Revolution\r\nseems to have been ordained on purpose for him. The people rose against\r\nthe tyranny of kings: the towers of the Bastille were overthrown.\r\nLatude, the victim of kings, the victim of the Bastille and arbitrary\r\nwarrants, was about to appear in all his glory.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to throw into the gutter his powdered peruque and viscount's\r\nfrock; listen to the revolutionist, fierce, inflexible, indomitable,\r\n_uncompromising_: \"Frenchmen, I have won the right to tell you the\r\ntruth, and if you are free, you cannot but love to hear it.\r\n\r\n\"For thirty-five years I meditated in dungeons on the audacity and\r\ninsolence of despots; with loud cries I was calling down vengeance, when\r\nFrance in indignation rose up as one man in one sublime movement and\r\nlevelled despotism with the dust. The will to be free is what makes a\r\nnation free; and you have proved it. But to preserve freedom a nation\r\nmust make itself worthy of it, and that is what remains for you to do!\"\r\n\r\nIn the Salon of 1789 there were two portraits of Latude with the famous\r\nropeladder. Below one of these portraits, by Vestier, a member of the\r\nRoyal Academy, these lines were engraved:--\r\n\r\n    Instruit par ses malheurs et sa captivité\r\n    A vaincre des tyrans les efforts et la rage,\r\n    Il apprit aux Français comment le vrai courage\r\n            Peut conquérir la liberté.[50]\r\n\r\nIn 1787 the Marquis de Beaupoil-Saint-Aulaire had written, inspired by\r\nLatude himself, the story of the martyr's captivity. Of this book two\r\neditions appeared in the same year. In 1789 Latude published the\r\nnarrative of his escape from the Bastille, as well as his _Grand\r\nMémoire_ to the Marquise de Pompadour; finally, in 1790 appeared\r\n_Despotism Unmasked, or the Memoirs of Henri Masers de Latude_, edited\r\nby the advocate Thiéry. The book was dedicated to La Fayette. On the\r\nfirst page we see a portrait of the hero, his face proud and energetic,\r\none hand on the ropeladder, the other extended towards the Bastille\r\nwhich workmen are in the act of demolishing. \"I swear,\" says the author\r\nat the commencement, \"that I will not relate one fact which is not\r\ntrue.\" The work is a tissue of calumnies and lies; and what makes a most\r\npainful impression on the reader is to see this man disowning his\r\nmother, forgetting the privations she endured out of love for her son,\r\nand ascribing the credit of what little the poor thing could do for her\r\nchild to a Marquis de la Tude, knight of St. Louis, and\r\nlieutenant-colonel of the Orleans Dragoons!\r\n\r\nBut the book vibrates with an incomparable accent of sincerity and of\r\nthat profound emotion which Latude knew so well how to infuse into all\r\nthose with whom he had to do. In 1793, twenty editions had been\r\nexhausted, the work had been translated into several languages; the\r\njournals had no praise strong enough for the boldness and genius of the\r\nauthor; the _Mercure de France_ proclaimed that henceforth it was a\r\nparent's duty to teach his children to read in this sublime work; a copy\r\nwas sent to all the departments, accompanied by a model of the Bastille\r\nby the architect Palloy. With good reason could Latude exclaim in the\r\nNational Assembly: \"I have not a little contributed to the Revolution\r\nand to its consolidation.\"\r\n\r\nLatude was not the man to neglect opportunities so favourable. To begin\r\nwith, he sought to get his pension augmented, and presented to the\r\nConstituent Assembly a petition backed by representative Bouche. But\r\nCamus, \"rugged Camus,\" president of the committee appointed to\r\ninvestigate the matter, decided on rejection; and at the sitting of\r\nMarch 13, 1791, deputy Voidel delivered a very spirited speech; his view\r\nwas that the nation had unhappy folk to succour more worthy of their\r\nconcern than a man whose life had begun with roguery and villainy. The\r\nAssembly sided with him; not only was Latude's pension not increased,\r\nbut on consideration, the pension granted by Louis XVI. was altogether\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nHorror and infamy! \"What madness has seized on the minds of the\r\nrepresentatives of the most generous nation in the world!... To slay a\r\nhapless wretch the mere sight of whom awakens pity and warms into life\r\nthe most sluggish sensibility ... for death is not so terrible as the\r\nloss of honour!\" The valiant Latude will not abide the stroke of such an\r\ninsult. Ere long he has brought Voidel to retract; in the heart of the\r\nAssembly he gains an influential supporter in the Marshal de Broglie.\r\nThe Constituent Assembly is replaced by the Legislative, and Latude\r\nreturns to the charge. He is admitted to the bar of the House on January\r\n26, 1792; the matter is re-committed and gone into a second time on\r\nFebruary 25. We should like to be able to quote at length the speech\r\nwhich Latude himself composed for his advocate; here is a portion of the\r\nperoration:--\r\n\r\n\"That a man, without any outside assistance, should have been able to\r\nescape three times, once from the Bastille and twice from Vincennes,\r\nyes, gentlemen, I venture to say he could not have succeeded except by a\r\nmiracle, or else that Latude has more than extraordinary genius. Cast\r\nyour eyes on this ladder of rope and wood, and on all the other\r\ninstruments which Latude constructed with a mere knife, which you see\r\nhere in the centre of this chamber. I resolved to bring before your own\r\neyes this interesting object, which will for ever win admiration from\r\nmen of intelligence. Not a single stranger comes to Paris without going\r\nto see this masterpiece of intelligence and genius, as well as his\r\ngenerous deliverer, Madame Legros. We have resolved to give you,\r\ngentlemen, the pleasure of seeing this celebrated woman, who\r\nunremittingly for forty months set despotism at defiance, and vanquished\r\nit by dint of virtue. Behold her there at the bar with M. de Latude,\r\nbehold that incomparable woman, for ever to be the glory and the\r\nornament of her sex!\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the Legislative Assembly was deeply moved by\r\nthis eloquent harangue and this exhibition of the lady, as touching as\r\nunexpected. It unanimously voted Latude a pension of 2000 livres,\r\nwithout prejudice to the pension of 400 livres previously awarded.\r\nHenceforth Latude will be able to say: \"The whole nation adopted me!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the little mishap in the Constituent Assembly was to be the\r\nonly check that Latude suffered in the course of his glorious martyr's\r\ncareer. Presented to the Society of \"Friends of the Constitution,\" he\r\nwas elected a member by acclamation, and the Society sent a deputation\r\nof twelve members to carry the civic crown to Madame Legros. The leader\r\nof the deputation said, in a voice broken by emotion, \"This day is the\r\ngrandest day of my life.\" A deputation from the principal theatres of\r\nParis offered Latude free admission to all performances, \"so that he\r\nmight go often and forget the days of his mourning.\" He was surrounded\r\nby the highest marks of consideration; pleaders begged him to support\r\ntheir cases before the tribunals with the moral authority bestowed on\r\nhim by his virtue. He took advantage of this to bring definitively\r\nbefore the courts his claims against the heirs of the Marquise de\r\nPompadour. Citizen Mony argued the case for the first time before the\r\ncourt of the sixth arrondissement on July 16, 1793; on September 11 the\r\ncase came again before the magistrates: Citizens Chaumette, Laurent, and\r\nLegrand had been designated by the Commune of Paris as counsel for the\r\ndefence, and the whole Commune was present at the hearing. Latude\r\nobtained 60,000 livres, 10,000 of which were paid him in cash.\r\n\r\nAnd now his life became more tranquil. Madame Legros continued to lavish\r\nher care on him. The 50,000 livres remaining due to him from the heirs\r\nof the Marquise were paid in good farm lands situated in La Beauce, the\r\nprofits of which he regularly drew.\r\n\r\nLet us hasten to add that France did not find in Latude an ungrateful\r\nchild. The critical situation in which the nation was then struggling\r\npained him deeply. He sought the means of providing a remedy, and in\r\n1799 brought out a \"Scheme for the valuation of the eighty departments\r\nof France to save the Republic in less than three months,\" and a \"Memoir\r\non the means of re-establishing the public credit and order in the\r\nfinances of France.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the estates of Madame de Pompadour were sequestrated, the farms\r\nLatude had received were taken from him; but he induced the Directory to\r\nrestore them. He was less fortunate in his requisition for a licence for\r\na theatre and a gaming-house. But he found consolation. The subsidies he\r\nwent on extorting from right and left, the proceeds of his farms, the\r\nsale of his books, and the money brought in by the exhibition of his\r\nropeladder, which was exhibited by a showman in the different towns of\r\nFrance and England, provided him with a very comfortable income.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution became a thing of the past. Latude hailed the dawning\r\nglory of Bonaparte, and when Bonaparte became Napoleon, Latude made his\r\nbow to the emperor. We have a very curious letter in which he marks out\r\nfor Napoleon I. the line of conduct he should pursue to secure his own\r\nwelfare and the good of France. It begins as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"SIRE,--I have been five times buried alive, and am well acquainted with\r\nmisfortune. To have a heart more sympathetic than the common run of men\r\nit is necessary to have suffered great ills.... At the time of the\r\nTerror I had the delightful satisfaction of saving the lives of\r\ntwenty-two poor wretches.... To petition Fouquet d'Etinville on behalf\r\nof the royalists was to persuade him that I was one myself. When I\r\nbraved death in order to save the lives of twenty-two citizens, judge,\r\ngreat Emperor, if my heart can do ought but take great interest in you,\r\nthe saviour of my beloved country.\"\r\n\r\nWe are given some details of the last years of Latude's life in the\r\n_Memoirs_ of his friend, the Chevalier de Pougens, and in the _Memoirs_\r\nof the Duchess d'Abrantès. The Chevalier tells us that at the age of\r\nseventy-five years he still enjoyed good health; he was \"active and gay,\r\nand appeared to enjoy to the full the delights of existence. Every day\r\nhe took long walks in Paris without experiencing the least fatigue.\r\nPeople were amazed to find _no trace_ of the cruel sufferings he had\r\nundergone in the cells during a captivity of thirty-five years.\" His\r\npopularity suffered no diminution under the Empire. Junot awarded him a\r\npension from funds at his disposal. One day the general presented him\r\nto his wife, along with Madame Legros, whose side Latude never left.\r\n\"When he arrived,\" says the Duchess d'Abrantès, \"I went to greet him\r\nwith a respect and an emotion that must have been truly edifying. I took\r\nhim by the hand, conducted him to a chair, and put a cushion under his\r\nfeet; in fact, he might have been my grandfather, whom I could not have\r\ntreated better. At table I placed him on my right. But,\" adds the\r\nDuchess, \"my enchantment was of short duration. He talked of nothing but\r\nhis own adventures with appalling loquacity.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighty, a few months before his death, Latude wrote in the\r\nmost familiar terms to his protector, the Chevalier de Pougens, a member\r\nof the Institute: \"Now I assure you in the clearest possible words, that\r\nif within ten days of the present time, the 11th Messidor, you have not\r\nturned up in Paris (the Chevalier was staying at his country estate), I\r\nshall start the next day and come to you with the hunger of a giant and\r\nthe thirst of a cabby, and when I have emptied your cellar and eaten you\r\nout of house and home you will see me play the second act of the comedy\r\nof _Jocrisse_[51]; you will see me run off with your plates, and dishes,\r\nand tankards, and bottles--empty, you may be sure--and fling all your\r\nfurniture out of the window!\"\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 1804, Latude compiled one more circular, addressed to the\r\nsovereigns of Europe: the kings of Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark, the\r\nArchduke Charles, brother of the Emperor; and to the President of the\r\nUnited States. To each of them he sent a copy of his _Memoirs_,\r\naccompanied by the famous scheme for replacing with muskets the pikes\r\nwith which the sergeants were armed. He explained to each of the\r\nsovereigns that as the country he ruled was profiting by this child of\r\nhis genius, it was only just that he should reap some benefit.\r\n\r\nJean Henri, surnamed Danry, alias Danger, alias Jedor, alias Masers\r\nd'Aubrespy, alias De Masers de Latude, died of pneumonia at Paris, on\r\nJanuary 1, 1805, aged eighty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTEENTH OF JULY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable book entitled _Paris during the Revolution_, M.\r\nAdolphe Schmidt writes: \"All the purely revolutionary events, the events\r\nof the Fourteenth of July, of October 5 and 6, 1789, were the work of an\r\nobscure minority of reckless and violent revolutionists. If they\r\nsucceeded, it was only because the great majority of the citizens\r\navoided the scene of operations or were mere passive spectators there,\r\nattracted by curiosity, and giving in appearance an enhanced importance\r\nto the movement.\" Further on he says: \"After the fall of the\r\nGironde,[52] Dutard expressed himself in these terms: 'If, out of 50,000\r\nModerates, you succeed in collecting a compact body of no more than\r\n3000, I shall be much astonished; and if out of these 3000 there are to\r\nbe found only 500 who are agreed, and courageous enough to express their\r\nopinion, I shall be still more astonished. And these, in truth, must\r\nexpect to be Septembrised.'[53] 'Twelve maniacs, with their blood well\r\nup, at the head of the Sansculotte section,' writes Dutard in another\r\nreport, 'would put to flight the other forty-seven sections of Paris.'\r\nMercier, after the fall of the Gironde, thus expresses himself in regard\r\nto the reign of Terror: 'Sixty brigands deluged France with blood:\r\n500,000 men within our walls were witnesses of their atrocities, and\r\nwere not brave enough to oppose them.'\"\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader to understand the extraordinary and improbable\r\nevent which is the subject of this chapter, it would be necessary to\r\nbegin by explaining the circumstances and describing the material and\r\nmoral state of things in which it happened; and that, unhappily, would\r\noccupy much space. Let us take the two principal facts, see what they\r\nled to, and then come to the events of the Fourteenth of July.\r\n\r\nFor its task of governing France, the royal power had in its hands no\r\nadministrative instrument, or, at any rate, administrative instruments\r\nof a very rudimentary character. It ruled through tradition and\r\nsentiment. The royal power had been created by the affection and\r\ndevotion of the nation, and in this devotion and affection lay its whole\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nWhat, actually and practically, were the means of government in the\r\nhands of the king? \"Get rid of _lettres de cachet_,\" observed\r\nMalesherbes, \"and you deprive the king of all his authority, for the\r\n_lettre de cachet_ is the only means he possesses of enforcing his will\r\nin the kingdom.\" Now, for several years past, the royal power had\r\npractically renounced _lettres de cachet_. On the other hand, during the\r\ncourse of the eighteenth century, the sentiments of affection and\r\ndevotion of which we have spoken had become enfeebled, or at least had\r\nchanged their character. So it was that on the eve of the Revolution the\r\nroyal power, which stood in France for the entire administration, had,\r\nif the expression may be allowed, melted into thin air.\r\n\r\nBelow the royal power, the lords in the country, the upper ten in the\r\ntowns, constituted the second degree in the government. The same remarks\r\napply here also. And unhappily it is certain that, over the greater part\r\nof France, the territorial lords had forgotten the duties which their\r\nprivileges and their station imposed. The old attachment of the\r\nlabouring classes to them had almost everywhere disappeared, and in many\r\nparticulars had given place to feelings of hostility.\r\n\r\nThus on the eve of '89 the whole fabric of the state had no longer any\r\nreal existence: at the first shock it was bound to crumble into dust.\r\nAnd as, behind the fragile outer wall, there was no solid structure--no\r\nadministrative machine, with its numerous, diverse, and nicely-balanced\r\nparts, like that which in our time acts as a buffer against the shocks\r\nof political crises,--the first blow aimed at the royal power was bound\r\nto plunge the whole country into a state of disorganization and\r\ndisorder from which the tyranny of the Terror, brutal, blood-stained,\r\noverwhelming as it was, alone could rescue it.\r\n\r\nSuch is the first of the two facts we desire to make clear. We come now\r\nto the second. Ever since the year 1780, France had been almost\r\ncontinually in a state of famine. The rapidity and the abundance of the\r\ninternational exchanges which in our days supply us constantly from the\r\nremotest corners of the world with the necessaries of life, prevent our\r\nknowing anything of those terrible crises which in former days swept\r\nover the nations. \"The dearth,\" writes Taine, \"permanent, prolonged,\r\nhaving already lasted ten years, and aggravated by the very outbreaks\r\nwhich it provoked, went on adding fuel to all the passions of men till\r\nthey reached a blaze of madness.\" \"The nearer we come to the Fourteenth\r\nof July,\" says an eye witness, \"the greater the famine becomes.\" \"In\r\nconsequence of the bad harvest,\" writes Schmidt, \"the price of bread had\r\nbeen steadily rising from the opening of the year 1789. This state of\r\nthings was utilized by the agitators who aimed at driving the people\r\ninto excesses: these excesses in turn paralyzed trade. Business ceased,\r\nand numbers of workers found themselves without bread.\"\r\n\r\nA few words should properly be said in regard to brigandage under the\r\n_ancien régime_. The progress of manners and especially the development\r\nof executive government have caused it utterly to disappear. The\r\nreader's imagination will supply all we have not space to say. He will\r\nrecollect the lengths of daring to which a man like Cartouche[54] could\r\ngo, and recall what the forest of Bondy[55] was at the gates of Paris.\r\n\r\nSo grew up towards the end of the _ancien régime_ what Taine has so\r\nhappily called a spontaneous anarchy. In the four months preceding the\r\ncapture of the Bastille, one can count more than three hundred riots in\r\nFrance. At Nantes, on January 9, 1789, the town hall was invaded, and\r\nthe bakers' shops pillaged. All this took place to the cries of \"Vive le\r\nroi!\" At Bray-sur-Seine, on May 1, peasants armed with knives and clubs\r\nforced the farmers to lower the price of corn. At Rouen, on May 28, the\r\ncorn in the market place was plundered. In Picardy, a discharged\r\ncarabineer put himself at the head of an armed band which attacked the\r\nvillages and carried off the corn. On all sides houses were looted from\r\nroof to cellar. At Aupt, M. de Montferrat, defending himself, was \"cut\r\ninto little pieces.\" At La Seyne, the mob brought a coffin in front of\r\nthe house of one of the principal burgesses; he was told to prepare for\r\ndeath, and they would do him the honour to bury him. He escaped, and his\r\nhouse was sacked. We cull these facts haphazard from among hundreds of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe immediate neighbourhood of Paris was plunged in terror. The batches\r\nof letters, still unpublished, preserved in the National Archives throw\r\nthe most vivid light on this point. Bands of armed vagabonds scoured the\r\ncountry districts, pillaging the villages and plundering the crops.\r\nThese were the \"Brigands,\" a term which constantly recurs in the\r\ndocuments, and more and more frequently as we approach the 14th of July.\r\nThese armed bands numbered three, four, five hundred men. At Cosne, at\r\nOrleans, at Rambouillet, it was the same story of raids on the corn. In\r\ndifferent localities of the environs of Paris, the people organized\r\nthemselves on a military basis. Armed burghers patrolled the streets\r\nagainst the \"brigands.\" From all sides the people rained on the king\r\ndemands for troops to protect them. Towns like Versailles, in dread of\r\nan invasion by these ruffians, implored the king for protection: the\r\nletters of the municipal council preserved in the National Archives are\r\nin the highest degree instructive.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there had collected in the outskirts of Paris those\r\ntroops whose presence was in the sequel so skilfully turned to account\r\nby the orators of the Palais-Royal. True, the presence of the troops\r\nmade them uneasy. So far were the soldiers from having designs against\r\nthe Parisians that in the secret correspondence of Villedeuil we find\r\nthe court constantly urging that they should be reserved for the\r\nsafeguarding of the adjoining districts, which were every day exposed to\r\nattack, and for the safe conduct of the convoys of corn coming up to\r\nVersailles and Paris. Bands mustered around the capital. In the first\r\nweeks of May, near Villejuif, a troop of from five to six hundred\r\nruffians met intending to storm Bicêtre and march on Saint-Cloud. They\r\ncame from distances of thirty, forty, and fifty leagues, and the whole\r\nmass surged around Paris and was swallowed up there as into a sewer.\r\nDuring the last days of April the shopmen saw streaming through the\r\nbarriers \"a terrific number of men, ill clad and of sinister aspect.\" By\r\nthe first days of May, it was noticed that the appearance of the mob had\r\naltogether changed. There was now mingled with it \"a number of strangers\r\nfrom all the country parts, most of them in rags, and armed with huge\r\nclubs, the mere aspect of them showing what was to be feared.\" In the\r\nwords of a contemporary, \"one met such physiognomies as one never\r\nremembered having seen in the light of day.\" To provide occupation for a\r\npart of these ill-favoured unemployed, whose presence everybody felt to\r\nbe disquieting, workshops were constructed at Montmartre, where from\r\nseventeen to eighteen thousand men were employed on improvised tasks at\r\ntwenty sous a day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the electors chosen to nominate deputies to the National\r\nAssembly had been collecting. On April 22, 1789, Thiroux de Crosne, the\r\nlieutenant of police, speaking of the tranquillity with which the\r\nelections were being carried on, added: \"But I constantly have my eye on\r\nthe bakers.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 23, de Crosne referred to the irritation which was showing\r\nitself among certain groups of workmen in the Suburb Saint-Antoine\r\nagainst two manufacturers, Dominique Henriot, the saltpetre-maker, and\r\nRéveillon, the manufacturer of wall-papers. Henriot was known, not only\r\nfor his intelligence, but for his kindliness; in years of distress he\r\nhad sacrificed a portion of his fortune for the support of the workmen;\r\nas to Réveillon, he was at this date one of the most remarkable\r\nrepresentatives of Parisian industry. A simple workman to begin with, he\r\nwas in 1789 paying 200,000 livres a year in salaries to 300 workers;\r\nshortly before, he had carried off the prize founded by Necker for the\r\nencouragement of useful arts. Henriot and Réveillon were said to have\r\nmade offensive remarks against the workmen in the course of the recent\r\nelectoral assemblies. They both denied, however, having uttered the\r\nremarks attributed to them, and there is every reason to believe that\r\ntheir denials were genuine.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of April 27 and the next day, howling mobs attacked the\r\nestablishments of Henriot and Réveillon, which were thoroughly\r\nplundered. Commissary Gueullette, in his report of May 3, notes that a\r\nwild and systematic devastation was perpetrated. Only the walls were\r\nleft standing. What was not stolen was smashed into atoms. The\r\n\"brigands\"--the expression used by the Commissary--threw a part of the\r\nplant out of the windows into the street, where the mob made bonfires of\r\nit. Part of the crowd were drunk; nevertheless they flung themselves\r\ninto the cellars, and the casks were stove in. When casks and bottles\r\nwere empty, the rioters attacked the flasks containing colouring\r\nmatter; this they absorbed in vast quantities, and reeled about with\r\nfearful contortions, poisoned. When these cellars were entered next day,\r\nthey presented a horrible spectacle, for the wretches had come to\r\nquarrelling and cutting each other's throats. \"The people got on to the\r\nroofs,\" writes Thiroux de Crosne, \"whence they rained down upon the\r\ntroops a perfect hailstorm of tiles, stones, &c.; they even set rolling\r\ndown fragments of chimneys and bits of timber; and although they were\r\nfired upon several times and some persons were killed, it was quite\r\nimpossible to master them.\"\r\n\r\nThe riot was not quelled by the troops until 10 o'clock that night; more\r\nthan a hundred persons were left dead in the street. M. Alexandre Tuetey\r\nhas devoted some remarkable pages to Réveillon's affair; he has\r\ncarefully studied the interrogatories of rioters who were arrested. The\r\nmajority, he says, had been drunk all day. Réveillon, as is well known,\r\nonly found safety by taking refuge in the Bastille. He was the only\r\nprisoner whom the Bastille received throughout the year 1789.\r\n\r\nIn the night following these bacchanalian orgies, the agents of the\r\nMarquis du Châtelet, colonel of the Gardes Françaises, having crept\r\nalong one of the moats, \"saw a crowd of brigands\" collected on the\r\nfurther side of the Trône gate. Their leader was mounted on a table,\r\nharanguing them.\r\n\r\nWe come upon them again in the report of Commissary Vauglenne, quoted by\r\nM. Alexandre Tuetey. \"On April 29, Vauglenne took the depositions of\r\nbakers, confectioners, and pork butchers of the Marais, who had been\r\nrobbed by veritable bands of highwaymen, who proceed by burglary and\r\nviolence; they may possibly be starving men, but they look and act\r\nuncommonly like gentlemen of the road.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the garden of the Palais-Royal, Camille Desmoulins was\r\nharanguing groups of the unemployed and ravenous outcasts, who were\r\npressing round him with wide glaring eyes. Desmoulins vociferates: \"The\r\nbeast is in the trap; now to finish him!... Never a richer prey has ever\r\nbeen offered to conquerors! Forty thousand palaces, mansions, châteaux,\r\ntwo-fifths of the wealth of France will be the prize of valour. Those\r\nwho have set up as our masters will be mastered in their turn, the\r\nnation will be purged!\" It is easy to understand that in Paris the alarm\r\nhad become as acute as in the country; everyone was in terror of the\r\n\"brigands.\" On June 25 it was decided to form a citizen militia for the\r\nprotection of property. \"The notoriety of these disorders,\" we read in\r\nthe minutes of the electors, \"and the excesses committed by several mobs\r\nhave decided the general assembly to re-establish without delay the\r\nmilitia of Paris.\" But a certain time was necessary for the organization\r\nof this civil guard. On June 30, the doors of the Abbaye, where some\r\nGardes Françaises had been locked up, some for desertion, others for\r\ntheft, were broken in by blows from hatchets and hammers. The prisoners\r\nwere led in triumph to the Palais-Royal, where they were fêted in the\r\ngarden. The extent of the disorders was already so great that the\r\ngovernment, powerless to repress them, had perforce to grant a general\r\npardon. From that day there was no longer any need to capture the\r\nBastille, the _ancien régime_ was lost.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances at the Palais-Royal, the rendezvous of idlers, light\r\nwomen, and hot-headed fools, were becoming ever more violent. They began\r\nto talk of setting fire to the place. If some honest citizen plucked up\r\ncourage to protest he was publicly whipped, thrown into the ponds, and\r\nrolled in the mud.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, Necker was dismissed from the ministry and replaced by\r\nBreteuil. At this time Necker was very popular; Breteuil was not, though\r\nhe ought to have been, particularly in the eyes of supporters of a\r\nrevolutionary movement. Of all the ministers of the _ancien régime_, and\r\nof all the men of his time, Breteuil was the one who had done most for\r\nthe suppression of _lettres de cachet_ and of state prisons. It was he\r\nwho had closed Vincennes and the Châtimoine tower of Caen, who had got\r\nthe demolition of the Bastille decided on, who had set Latude at\r\nliberty, and how many other prisoners! who had drawn up and made\r\nrespected, even in the remotest parts of the kingdom, those admirable\r\ncirculars which will immortalize his name, by which he ordered the\r\nimmediate liberation of all prisoners whose detention was not absolutely\r\njustified, and laid down such rigorous formalities for the future, that\r\nthe arbitrary character of _lettres de cachet_ may be said to have been\r\ndestroyed by them. Nevertheless the orators of the Palais-Royal\r\nsucceeded in persuading many people that the advent of Breteuil to the\r\nministry presaged a \"St. Bartholomew of patriots.\" The agitation became\r\nso vehement, the calumnies against the court and the government were\r\nrepeated with so much violence, that the court, in order to avoid the\r\nslightest risk of the outbreak of a \"St. Bartholomew,\" ordered all the\r\ntroops to be withdrawn and Paris to be left to itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Camille Desmoulins was continuing to thunder forth: \"I have\r\njust sounded the people. My rage against the despots was turned to\r\ndespair. I did not see the crowds, although keenly moved and dismayed,\r\nstrongly enough disposed to insurrection.... I was rather lifted on to\r\nthe table than mounted there myself. Scarcely was I there than I saw\r\nmyself surrounded by an immense throng. Here is my short address, which\r\nI shall never forget: 'Citizens! there is not a moment to lose. I come\r\nfrom Versailles; M. Necker is dismissed; this dismissal is the alarm\r\nbell of a St. Bartholomew of patriots; this evening all the Swiss and\r\nGerman battalions will march from the Champ de Mars to cut our throats.\r\nOnly one resource remains to us: we must fly to arms!'\"\r\n\r\nThe Parisians were in an abject state of fright, but it was not the\r\nSwiss and German battalions which terrified them. The author of the\r\n_Memorable Fortnight_, devoted heart and soul as he was to the\r\nrevolutionary movement, acknowledges that during the days from the 12th\r\nto the 14th of July, all respectable people shut themselves up in their\r\nhouses. And while the troops and decent people were retiring, the dregs\r\nwere coming to the surface. During the night of July 12, the majority of\r\nthe toll gates, where the town dues were collected, were broken open,\r\nplundered, and set on fire. \"Brigands,\" armed with pikes and clubs,\r\nscoured the streets, threatening the houses in which the trembling and\r\nagitated citizens had shut themselves. Next day, July 13, the shops of\r\nthe bakers and wine merchants were rifled. \"Girls snatched the earrings\r\nfrom women who went by; if the ring resisted, the ear was torn in two.\"\r\n\"The house of the lieutenant of police was ransacked, and Thiroux de\r\nCrosne had the utmost difficulty in escaping from the bands armed with\r\nclubs and torches. Another troop, with murderous cries, arrived at the\r\nForce, where prisoners for debt were confined: the prisoners were set\r\nfree. The Garde-Meuble was ransacked. One gang broke in with their axes\r\nthe door of the Lazarists, smashed the library, the cupboards, the\r\npictures, the windows, the physical laboratory, dived into the cellar,\r\nstove in the wine-casks and got gloriously drunk. Twenty-four hours\r\nafterwards some thirty dead and dying were found there, men and women,\r\none of the latter on the point of childbirth. In front of the house the\r\nstreet was full of débris and of brigands, who held in their hands, some\r\neatables, others a pitcher, forcing wayfarers to drink and filling for\r\nall and sundry. Wine flowed in torrents.\" Some had possessed themselves\r\nof ecclesiastical robes, which they put on, and in this attire yelled\r\nand gesticulated down the street. In the minute books of the electors we\r\nread at this date: \"On information given to the committee that the\r\nbrigands who had been dispersed showed some disposition to reassemble\r\nfor the purpose of attacking and pillaging the Royal Treasury and the\r\nBank, the committee ordered these two establishments to be guarded.\" On\r\nthe same day, they luckily succeeded in disarming more than a hundred\r\nand fifty of these roisterers, who, drunk with wine and brandy, had\r\nfallen asleep inside the Hôtel de Ville. Meanwhile the outskirts of\r\nParis were no safer than the city itself, and from the top of the towers\r\nof the Bastille they could see the conflagrations which were started in\r\nvarious quarters.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the citizen militia against these disorders was\r\nbecoming urgent. When evening came, the majority of the districts set\r\nactively to work. Twelve hundred good citizens mustered in the Petit\r\nSaint-Antoine district. It was a motley crew: tradesmen and artisans,\r\nmagistrates and doctors, writers and scholars, cheek by jowl with\r\nnavvies and carpenters. The future minister of Louis XVI., Champion de\r\nVilleneuve, filled the post of secretary. The twelve hundred citizens,\r\nas we read in the minutes, \"compelled to unite by the too well founded\r\nalarm inspired in all the citizens by the danger which seems to threaten\r\nthem each individually, and by the imminent necessity of taking prompt\r\nmeasures to avert its effects, considering that a number of\r\nindividuals, terrified perhaps by the rumours which doubtless\r\nevil-disposed persons have disseminated, are traversing, armed and in\r\ndisorder, all the streets of the capital, and that the ordinary town\r\nguard either mingles with them or remains a passive spectator of the\r\ndisorder it cannot arrest; considering also that the prison of the Force\r\nhas been burst into and opened for the prisoners, and that it is\r\nthreatened to force open in the same way the prisons which confine\r\nvagabonds, vagrants, and convicts ... in consequence, the assembled\r\ncitizens decide to organize themselves into a citizen militia. Every man\r\nwill carry while on duty whatever arms he can procure, save and except\r\npistols, which are forbidden as dangerous weapons.... There will always\r\nbe two patrols on duty at a time, and two others will remain at the\r\nplace fixed for headquarters.\" Most of the other districts imitated the\r\nproceedings of the Petit-Saint-Antoine. They sent delegates to the Hôtel\r\ndes Invalides to ask for arms. The delegates were received by Besenval,\r\nwho would have been glad to grant them what they requested; but he must\r\nhave proper instructions. He writes in his _Memoirs_ that the delegates\r\nwere in a great state of fright, saying that the \"brigands\" were\r\nthreatening to burn and pillage their houses. The author of the\r\n_Memorable Fortnight_ dwells on the point that the militia of Paris was\r\nformed in self-defence against the excesses of the brigands. Speaking of\r\nthe minute book of the Petit-Saint-Antoine district, an excellent\r\nauthority, M. Charavay, writes: \"The burgesses of Paris, less alarmed\r\nat the plans of the court than at the men to whom the name of _brigands_\r\nhad already been given, organized themselves into a militia to resist\r\nthem: that was their only aim. The movement which on the next day swept\r\naway the Bastille might perhaps have been repressed by the National\r\nGuard if its organization had had greater stability.\" The fact could not\r\nhave been better put.\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel de Ville was attacked, and one of the electors, Legrand, only\r\ncleared it of the hordes who were filling it with their infernal uproar\r\nby ordering six barrels of powder to be brought up, and threatening to\r\nblow the place up if they did not retire.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of July 13, the shops of the bakers and wine-sellers\r\nwere pillaged. The excellent Abbé Morellet, one of the Encyclopædists,\r\nwho, as we have seen, was locked up in the Bastille under Louis XV.,\r\nwrites: \"I spent a great part of the night of the 13th at my windows,\r\nwatching the scum of the population armed with muskets, pikes, and\r\nskewers, as they forced open the doors of the houses and got themselves\r\nfood and drink, money and arms.\" Mathieu Dumas also describes in his\r\n_Souvenirs_ these ragged vagabonds, several almost naked, and with\r\nhorrible faces. During these two days and nights, writes Bailly, Paris\r\nran great risk of pillage, and was only saved by the National Guard.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of these bandits and the work of the National Guard are\r\ndescribed in a curious letter from an English doctor, named Rigby, to\r\nhis wife. \"It was necessary not only to give arms to those one could\r\nrely on, but to disarm those of whom little protection could be expected\r\nand who might become a cause of disorder and harm. This required a good\r\ndeal of skill. Early in the afternoon we began to catch a glimpse here\r\nand there among the swarms of people, where we saw signs of an\r\nirritation which might soon develop into excesses, of a man of decent\r\nappearance, carrying a musket with a soldierly air. These slowly but\r\nsurely increased in number; their intention was evidently to pacify and\r\nat the same time to disarm the irregular bands. They had for the most\r\npart accomplished their task before nightfall. Then the citizens who had\r\nbeen officially armed occupied the streets almost exclusively: they were\r\ndivided into several sections, some mounting guard at certain points,\r\nothers patrolling the streets, all under the leadership of captains.\r\nWhen night came, only very few of those who had armed themselves the\r\nevening before could be seen. Some, however, had refused to give up\r\ntheir arms, and during the night it was seen how well founded had been\r\nthe fears they had inspired, for they started to pillage. But it was too\r\nlate to do so with impunity. The looters were discovered and seized, and\r\nwe learnt next morning that several of these wretches, taken redhanded,\r\nhad been executed.\" Indeed, the repressive measures of the citizens were\r\nnot wanting in energy. Here and there brigands were strung up to the\r\nlamp-posts, and then despatched, as they hung there, with musket shots.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Authentic History_, who left the best of the\r\ncontemporary accounts of the taking of the Bastille which we possess,\r\nsays rightly enough: \"The riot began on the evening of July 12.\" There\r\nwas thus a combination of disorders and \"brigandage\" in which the\r\ncapture of the Bastille, though it stands out more prominently than the\r\nother events, was only a part, and cannot be considered by itself.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the Fourteenth dawned bright and sunny. A great part of\r\nthe population had remained up all night, and daylight found them still\r\nharassed with anxiety and alarm. To have arms was the desire of all; the\r\ncitizens and supporters of order, so as to protect themselves; the\r\nbrigands, a part of whom had been disarmed, in order to procure or\r\nrecover the means of assault and pillage. There was a rush to the\r\nInvalides, where the magazines of effective arms were. This was the\r\nfirst violent action of the day. The mob carried off 28,000 muskets and\r\ntwenty-four cannon. And as it was known that other munitions of war were\r\ndeposited in the Bastille, the cry of \"To the Invalides!\" was succeeded\r\nby the cry \"To the Bastille!\"\r\n\r\nWe must carefully distinguish between the two elements of which the\r\nthrong flocking to the Bastille was composed. On the one hand, a horde\r\nof nameless vagabonds, those whom the contemporary documents invariably\r\nstyle the \"brigands\"; and, on the other hand, the respectable\r\ncitizens--these certainly formed the minority--who desired arms for the\r\nequipment of the civil guard. The sole motive impelling this band to\r\nthe Bastille was the wish to procure arms. On this point all documents\r\nof any value and all the historians who have studied the matter closely\r\nare in agreement. There was no question of liberty or of tyranny, of\r\nsetting free the prisoners or of protesting against the royal authority.\r\nThe capture of the Bastille was effected amid cries of \"Vive le roi!\"\r\njust as, for several months past in the provinces, the granaries had\r\nbeen plundered.\r\n\r\nAbout 8 o'clock in the morning, the electors at the Hôtel de Ville\r\nreceived some inhabitants of the Suburb Saint-Antoine who came to\r\ncomplain that the district was threatened by the cannon trained on it\r\nfrom the towers of the Bastille. These cannon were used for firing\r\nsalutes on occasions of public rejoicing, and were so placed that they\r\ncould do no harm whatever to the adjacent districts. But the electors\r\nsent some of their number to the Bastille, where the governor, de\r\nLauney, received the deputation with the greatest affability, kept them\r\nto lunch, and at their request withdrew the cannon from the embrasures.\r\nTo this deputation there succeeded another, which, however, was quite\r\nunofficial, consisting of three persons, with the advocate Thuriot de la\r\nRosière at the head. They were admitted as their predecessors had been.\r\nThuriot was the eloquent spokesman, \"in the name of the nation and the\r\nfatherland.\" He delivered an ultimatum to the governor and harangued the\r\ngarrison, consisting of 95 Invalides and 30 Swiss soldiers. Some\r\nthousand men were thronging round the Bastille, vociferating wildly. The\r\ngarrison swore not to fire unless they were attacked. De Launey said\r\nthat without orders he could do no more than withdraw the cannon from\r\nthe embrasures, but he went so far as to block up these embrasures with\r\nplanks. Then Thuriot took his leave and returned to the Hôtel de Ville,\r\nthe crowd meanwhile becoming more and more threatening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPTURE OF THE BASTILLE.\r\n\r\n_From an anonymous contemporary painting now in the Hôtel Carnavalet._]\r\n\r\n\"The entrance to the first courtyard, that of the barracks, was open,\"\r\nsays M. Fernand Bournon in his admirable account of the events of this\r\nday; \"but de Launey had ordered the garrison to retire within the\r\nenclosure, and to raise the outer drawbridge by which the court of the\r\ngovernor was reached, and which in the ordinary way used to be lowered\r\nduring the day. Two daring fellows dashed forward and scaled the roof of\r\nthe guard-house, one of them a soldier named Louis Tournay: the name of\r\nthe other is unknown. They shattered the chains of the drawbridge with\r\ntheir axes, and it fell.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said in a recent work, in which defects of judgment and\r\ncriticism are scarcely masked by a cumbrous parade of erudition, that\r\nTournay and his companion performed their feat under the fire of the\r\ngarrison. At this moment the garrison did not fire a single shot,\r\ncontenting themselves with urging the besiegers to retire. \"While M. de\r\nLauney and his officers contented themselves with threats, these two\r\nvigorous champions succeeded in breaking in the doors and in lowering\r\nthe outer drawbridge; then the horde of brigands advanced in a body and\r\ndashed towards the second bridge, which they wished to capture, firing\r\nat the troops as they ran. It was then for the first time that M. de\r\nLauney, perceiving his error in allowing the operations at the first\r\nbridge to be managed so quietly, ordered the soldiers to fire, which\r\ncaused a disorderly stampede on the part of the rabble, which was more\r\nbrutal than brave; and it is at this point that the calumnies against\r\nthe governor begin. Transposing the order of events, it has been\r\nasserted that he had sent out a message of peace, that the people had\r\nadvanced in reliance on his word, and that many citizens were\r\nmassacred.\" This alleged treachery of de Launey, immediately hawked\r\nabout Paris, was one of the events of the day. It is contradicted not\r\nonly by all the accounts of the besieged, but by the besiegers\r\nthemselves, and is now rejected by all historians.\r\n\r\nA wine-seller named Cholat, aided by one Baron, nicknamed La Giroflée,\r\nhad brought into position a piece of ordnance in the long walk of the\r\narsenal. They fired, but the gun's recoil somewhat seriously wounded the\r\ntwo artillerymen, and they were its only victims. As these means were\r\ninsufficient to overturn the Bastille, the besiegers set about devising\r\nothers. A pretty young girl named Mdlle. de Monsigny, daughter of the\r\ncaptain of the company of Invalides at the Bastille, had been\r\nencountered in the barrack yard. Some madmen imagined that she was\r\nMdlle. de Launey. They dragged her to the edge of the moat, and gave the\r\ngarrison to understand by their gestures that they were going to burn\r\nher alive if the place was not surrendered. They had thrown the unhappy\r\nchild, who had fainted, upon a mattress, to which they had already set\r\nlight. M. de Monsigny saw the hideous spectacle from a window of the\r\ntowers, and, desperately rushing down to save his child, he was killed\r\nby two shots. These were tricks in the siege of strongholds of which\r\nDuguesclin would never have dreamed. A soldier named Aubin Bonnemère\r\ncourageously interposed and succeeded in saving the girl.\r\n\r\nA detachment of Gardes Françaises, coming up with two pieces of\r\nartillery which the Hôtel de Ville had allowed to be removed, gave a\r\nmore serious aspect to the siege. But the name of Gardes Françaises must\r\nnot give rise to misapprehension: the soldiers of the regular army under\r\nthe _ancien régime_ must not be compared with those of the present day.\r\nThe regiment of Gardes Françaises in particular had fallen into a\r\nprofound state of disorganization and degradation. The privates were\r\npermitted to follow a trade in the city, by this means augmenting their\r\npay. It is certain that in the majority of cases the trade they followed\r\nwas that of the bully. \"Almost all the soldiers in the Guards belong to\r\nthis class,\" we read in the _Encyclopédie méthodique_, \"and many men\r\nindeed only enlist in the corps in order to live on the earnings of\r\nthese unfortunates.\" The numerous documents relating to the Gardes\r\nFrançaises preserved in the archives of the Bastille give the most\r\nprecise confirmation to this statement. We see, for example, that the\r\nrelatives of the engraver Nicolas de Larmessin requested a _lettre de\r\ncachet_ ordering their son to be locked up in jail, where they would pay\r\nfor his keep, \"because he had threatened to enlist in the Gardes\r\nFrançaises.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the fifteen cannon placed on the towers, not a single shot was\r\nfired during the siege. Within the château, three guns loaded with grape\r\ndefended the inner drawbridge; the governor had only one of them fired,\r\nand that only once. Not wishing to massacre the mob, de Launey\r\ndetermined to blow up the Bastille and find his grave among the ruins.\r\nThe Invalides Ferrand and Béquart flung themselves upon him to prevent\r\nhim from carrying out his intention. \"The Bastille was not captured by\r\nmain force,\" says Elie, whose testimony cannot be suspected of\r\npartiality in favour of the defenders; \"it surrendered before it was\r\nattacked, on my giving my word of honour as a French officer that all\r\nshould escape unscathed if they submitted.\"\r\n\r\nWe know how this promise was kept, in spite of the heroic efforts of\r\nElie and Hulin, to whom posterity owes enthusiastic homage. Is the mob\r\nto be reproached for these atrocious crimes? It was a savage horde, the\r\nscum of the population. De Launey, whose confidence and kindness had\r\nnever faltered, was massacred with every circumstance of horror. \"The\r\nAbbé Lefèvre,\" says Dusaulx, \"was an involuntary witness of his last\r\nmoments: 'I saw him fall,' he told me, 'without being able to help him;\r\nhe defended himself like a lion, and if only ten men had behaved as he\r\ndid at the Bastille, it would not have been taken.'\" His murderers\r\nslowly severed his head from his trunk with a penknife. The operation\r\nwas performed by a cook's apprentice named Desnot, \"who knew, as he\r\nafterwards proudly said, how to manage a joint.\" The deposition of this\r\nbrute should be read. It has been published by M. Guiffrey in the _Revue\r\nhistorique_. To give himself courage, Desnot had gulped down brandy\r\nmixed with gunpowder, and he added that what he had done was done in the\r\nhope of obtaining a medal.\r\n\r\n\"We learnt by-and-by,\" continues Dusaulx, \"of the death of M. de\r\nLosme-Salbray, which all good men deplored.\" De Losme had been the good\r\nangel of the prisoners during his term of office as major of the\r\nBastille: there are touching details showing to what lengths he carried\r\nhis kindliness and delicacy of feeling. At the moment when the mob was\r\nhacking at him, there happened to pass the Marquis de Pelleport, who had\r\nbeen imprisoned in the Bastille for several years; he sprang forward to\r\nsave him: \"Stop!\" he cried, \"you are killing the best of men.\" But he\r\nfell badly wounded, as also did the Chevalier de Jean, who had joined\r\nhim in the attempt to rescue the unfortunate man from the hands of the\r\nmob. The adjutant Miray, Person the lieutenant of the Invalides, and\r\nDumont, one of the Invalides, were massacred. Miray was led to the\r\nGrève, where the mob had resolved to execute him. Struck with fists and\r\nclubs, stabbed with knives, he crawled along in his death agony. He\r\nexpired, \"done to death with pin-pricks,\" before arriving at the place\r\nof execution. The Invalides Asselin and Béquart were hanged. It was\r\nBéquart who had prevented de Launey from blowing up the Bastille. \"He\r\nwas gashed with two sword-strokes,\" we read in the _Moniteur_, \"and a\r\nsabre cut had lopped off his wrist. They carried the hand in triumph\r\nthrough the streets of the city--the very hand to which so many citizens\r\nowed their safety.\" \"After I had passed the arcade of the Hôtel de\r\nVille,\" says Restif de la Bretonne, who has left so curious a page about\r\nthe 14th of July, \"I came upon some cannibals: one--I saw him with my\r\nown eyes--brought home to me the meaning of a horrible word heard so\r\noften since: he was carrying at the end of a _taille-cime_[56] the\r\nbleeding entrails of a victim of the mob's fury, and this horrible\r\ntop-knot caused no one to turn a hair. Farther on I met the captured\r\nInvalides and Swiss: from young and pretty lips--I shudder at it\r\nstill--came screams of 'Hang them! Hang them!'\"\r\n\r\nFurther, they massacred Flesselles, the provost of the guilds, accused\r\nof a treacherous action as imaginary as that of de Launey. They cut the\r\nthroat of Foulon, an old man of seventy-four years, who, as Taine tells\r\nus, had spent during the preceding winter 60,000 francs in order to\r\nprovide the poor with work. They assassinated Berthier, one of the\r\ndistinguished men of the time. Foulon's head was cut off; they tore\r\nBerthier's heart from his body to carry it in procession through\r\nParis--charming touch!--in a bouquet of white carnations. For the fun\r\nwas growing fast and furious. De Launey's head was borne on a pike to\r\nthe Palais Royal, then to the new bridge, where it was made to do\r\nobeisance three times to the statue of Henri IV., with the words,\r\n\"Salute thy master!\" At the Palais Royal, two of the conquerors had\r\nmerrily set themselves down at a dining-table in an entresol. As we\r\ngarnish our tables with flowers, so these men had placed on the table a\r\ntrunkless head and gory entrails; but as the crowd below cried out for\r\nthem, they shot them gaily out of the window.\r\n\r\nThose who had remained in front of the Bastille had dashed on in quest\r\nof booty. As at the pillage of the warehouses of Réveillon and Henriot,\r\nand of the convent of the Lazarists, the first impulse of the conquerors\r\nwas to bound forward to the cellar. \"This rabble,\" writes the author of\r\nthe _Authentic History_, \"were so blind drunk that they made in one body\r\nfor the quarters of the staff, breaking the furniture, doors, and\r\nwindows. All this time their comrades, taking the pillagers for some of\r\nthe garrison, were firing on them.\"\r\n\r\nNo one gave a thought to the prisoners, but the keys were secured and\r\ncarried in triumph through Paris. The doors of the rooms in which the\r\nprisoners were kept had to be broken in. The wretched men, terrified by\r\nthe uproar, were more dead than alive. These victims of arbitrary power\r\nwere exactly seven in number. Four were forgers, Béchade, Laroche, La\r\nCorrège, and Pujade; these individuals had forged bills of exchange, to\r\nthe loss of two Parisian bankers: while their case was being dealt with\r\nin regular course at the Châtelet, they were lodged in the Bastille,\r\nwhere they consulted every day with their counsel. Then there was the\r\nyoung Comte de Solages, who was guilty of monstrous crimes meriting\r\ndeath; he was kept in the Bastille out of regard for his family, who\r\ndefrayed his expenses. Finally there were two lunatics, Tavernier and de\r\nWhyte. We know what immense progress has been made during the past\r\ncentury in the methods of treating lunatics. In those days they locked\r\nthem up. Tavernier and de Whyte were before long transferred to\r\nCharenton, where assuredly they were not so well treated as they had\r\nbeen at the Bastille.\r\n\r\nSuch were the seven martyrs who were led in triumphant procession\r\nthrough the streets, amid the shouts of a deeply moved people.\r\n\r\nOf the besiegers, ninety-eight dead were counted, some of whom had met\r\ntheir death through the assailants' firing on one another. Several had\r\nbeen killed by falling into the moat. Of this total, only nineteen were\r\nmarried, and only five had children. These are details of some interest.\r\n\r\nThere was no thought of burying either the conquerors or the conquered.\r\nAt midnight on Wednesday the 15th, the presence of the corpses of the\r\nofficers of the Bastille, still lying in the Place de Grève, was\r\nnotified to the commissaries of the Châtelet. In his admirable work M.\r\nFurnand Bournon has published the ghastly report that was drawn up on\r\nthat night. It is a fitting crown to the work of the great day: \"We, the\r\nundersigned commissaries, duly noted down the declaration of the said\r\nSieur Houdan, and having then gone down into the courtyard of the\r\nChâtelet (whither the corpses had just been carried), we found there\r\nseven corpses of the male sex, the first without a head, clothed in a\r\ncoat, vest, breeches, and black silk stockings, with a fine shirt, but\r\nno shoes; the second also without a head, clothed in a vest of red\r\nstuff, breeches of nankeen with regimental buttons, blue silk stockings\r\nwith a small black pattern worked in; the third also headless, clothed\r\nin a shirt, breeches, and white cotton stockings; the fourth also\r\nheadless, clothed in a blood-stained shirt, breeches, and black\r\nstockings; the fifth clad in a shirt, blue breeches, and white gaiters,\r\nwith brown hair, apparently about forty years old, and having part of\r\nhis forearm cut off and severe bruises on his throat; the sixth clothed\r\nin breeches and white gaiters, with severe bruises on his throat; and\r\nthe seventh, clothed in a shirt, breeches, and black silk stockings,\r\ndisfigured beyond recognition.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the majority of the victors, the first moments of intoxication\r\nhaving passed, were hiding themselves like men who had committed a\r\ncrime. The disorder in the city was extreme. \"The commissioners of the\r\ndistricts,\" writes the Sicilian ambassador, \"seeing the peril in which\r\nthe inhabitants were placed before this enormous number of armed men,\r\nincluding brigands and men let out of prison on the previous days,\r\nformed patrols of the National Guard. They proclaimed martial law, or\r\nrather, they issued one solitary law declaring that whoever robbed or\r\nset fire to a house would be hanged. Indeed, not a day passed without\r\nfive and even as many as ten persons suffering this penalty. To this\r\nsalutary expedient we owe our lives and the safety of our houses.\"\r\n\r\nMore than one conqueror of the Bastille was hanged in this way, which\r\nwas a great pity, for two days later his glorious brow might have been\r\ncrowned with laurels and flowers!\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Bastille was captured by the people of Paris.\r\nBut the number of the besiegers amounted to no more than a thousand,\r\namong whom, as Marat has already brought to our notice, there were many\r\nprovincials and foreigners. As to the Parisians, they had come in great\r\nnumbers, as they always do, to see what was going on. We have this too\r\non the testimony of Marat. \"I was present at the taking of the\r\nBastille,\" writes the Chancellor de Pasquier also: \"what has been called\r\nthe 'fight' was not serious, and of resistance there was absolutely\r\nnone. A few musket shots were fired to which there was no reply, and\r\nfour or five cannon shots. We know the results of this boasted victory,\r\nwhich has brought a shower of compliments upon the heads of the\r\nso-called conquerors: the truth is that this great fight did not give a\r\nmoment's uneasiness to the numerous spectators who had hurried up to see\r\nthe result. Among them there was many a pretty woman; they had left\r\ntheir carriages at a distance in order to approach more easily. I was\r\nleaning on the end of the barrier which closed in the garden skirting\r\nBeaumarchais' garden in the direction of the Place de la Bastille. By my\r\nside was Mdlle. Contat, of the Comédie Française: we stayed to the end,\r\nand I gave her my arm to her carriage. As pretty as any woman could be,\r\nMdlle. Contat added to the graces of her person an intelligence of the\r\nmost brilliant order.\"\r\n\r\nBy next day there was quite another story. The Bastille had been\r\n\"stormed\" in a formidable and heroic assault lasting a quarter of an\r\nhour. The guns of the assailants had made a breach in its walls. These,\r\nit is true, were still standing intact; but that did not signify, the\r\nguns had made a breach, unquestionably! The seven prisoners who had been\r\nset free had been a disappointment, for the best will in the world could\r\nnot make them anything but scoundrels and lunatics; some one invented an\r\neighth, the celebrated Comte de Lorges, the white-headed hero and\r\nmartyr. This Comte de Lorges had no existence; but that fact also is\r\nnothing to the purpose: he makes an admirable and touching story. There\r\nwas talk of instruments of torture that had been discovered: \"an iron\r\ncorslet, invented to hold a man fast by all his joints, and fix him in\r\neternal immobility:\" it was really a piece of knightly armour dating\r\nfrom the middle ages, taken from the magazine of obsolete arms which was\r\nkept at the Bastille. Some one discovered also a machine \"not less\r\ndestructive, which was brought to the light of day, but no one could\r\nguess its name or its special use\"; it was a secret printing-press\r\nseized in the house of one François Lenormand in 1786. Finally, while\r\ndigging in the bastion, some one came upon the bones of Protestants who\r\nhad once been buried there, the prejudices of the time not allowing\r\ntheir remains to be laid in the consecrated ground of the cemetery: the\r\nvision of secret executions in the deepest dungeons of the Bastille was\r\nconjured up in the mind of the discoverers, and Mirabeau sent these\r\nterrible words echoing through France: \"The ministers were lacking in\r\nforesight, they forgot to eat the bones!\"\r\n\r\nThe compilation of the roll of the conquerors of the Bastille was a\r\nlaborious work. A great number of those who had been in the thick of the\r\nfray did not care to make themselves known: they did not know but that\r\ntheir laurel-crowned heads might be stuck aloft! It is true that these\r\nbashful heroes were speedily replaced by a host of fine fellows\r\nwho--from the moment when it was admitted that the conquerors were\r\nheroes, deserving of honours, pensions, and medals--were fully persuaded\r\nthat they had sprung to the assault, and in the very first rank. The\r\nfinal list contained 863 names.\r\n\r\nVictor Fournel in a charming book has sung the epic, at once ludicrous\r\nand lachrymose, of the men of the 14th of July. The book, which ought to\r\nbe read, gives a host of delightful episodes it is impossible to\r\nabridge. In the sequel these founders of liberty did not shine either\r\nthrough the services they rendered to the Republic, or through their\r\nfidelity to the immortal principles. The Hulins--Hulin, however, had\r\ndone nobly in trying to save de Launey--the Palloys, the Fourniers, the\r\nLatudes, and how many others! were the most servile lackeys of the\r\nEmpire, and those of them who survived were the most assiduous servants\r\nof the Restoration. Under the Empire, the conquerors of the Bastille\r\ntried to secure the Legion of Honour for the whole crew. They went about\r\nsoliciting pensions even up to 1830, and at that date, after forty-three\r\nyears, there were still 401 conquerors living. In 1848 the conquerors\r\nmade another appearance. There was still mention of pensions for the\r\nconquerors of the Bastille in the budget of 1874--let us save the\r\nladder, the ladder of Latude!\r\n\r\nThis is the amusing side of their story. But there is a painful side\r\ntoo: their rivalries with the Gardes Françaises, who charged them with\r\nfilching the glory from them, and with the \"volunteers of the Bastille.\"\r\nThe heroes were acquainted with calumny and opprobrium. There were, too,\r\ndeadly dissensions among their own body. There were the true conquerors,\r\nand others who, while they were true conquerors, were nevertheless not\r\ntrue: there were always \"traitors\" among the conquerors, as well as\r\n\"patriots.\" On July 1, 1790, two of the conquerors were found beaten to\r\ndeath near Beaumarchais' garden, in front of the theatre of their\r\nexploits. Next day there was a violent quarrel between four conquerors\r\nand some soldiers. In December two others were assassinated near the\r\nChamps de Mars. Early in 1791 two were wounded, and a third was\r\ndiscovered with his neck in a noose, in a ditch near the military\r\nschool. Such were the nocturnal doings on the barriers.\r\n\r\nIt remains to explain this amazing veering round of opinion, this\r\nlegend, of all things the least likely, which transformed into great men\r\nthe \"brigands\" of April, June, and July, 1789.\r\n\r\nThe first reason is explained in the following excellent passage from\r\n_Rabagas_[57]:--\r\n\r\n     _Carle._--But how then do you distinguish a riot from a revolution?\r\n\r\n     _Boubard._--A riot is when the mob is defeated ... they are all\r\n     curs. A revolution is when the mob is the stronger: they are all\r\n     heroes!\r\n\r\nDuring the night of July 14, the Duke de la Rochefoucauld woke Louis\r\nXVI. to announce to him the capture of the Bastille. \"It's a revolt\r\nthen,\" said the king. \"Sire,\" replied the duke, \"it is a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe day on which the royal power, in its feebleness and irresolution,\r\nabandoned Paris to the mob, was the day of its abdication. The Parisians\r\nattempted to organize themselves into a citizen militia in order to\r\nshoot down the brigands. The movement on the Bastille was a stroke of\r\ngenius on the part of the latter--instinctive, no doubt, but for all\r\nthat a stroke of genius. The people now recognized its masters, and with\r\nits usual facility it hailed the new régime with adulation. \"From that\r\nmoment,\" said a deputy, \"there was an end of liberty, even in the\r\nAssembly; France was dumb before thirty factionaries.\"\r\n\r\nWhat rendered the national enthusiasm for the conquerors more easy was\r\nprecisely all those legends to which credence was given, in all\r\nsincerity, by the most intelligent people in France--the legends on the\r\nhorrors of the Bastille and the cruelties of arbitrary power. For fifty\r\nyears they had been disseminated throughout the kingdom, and had taken\r\nfirm root. The pamphlets of Linguet and Mirabeau, the recent stupendous\r\nsuccess of the _Memoirs of Latude_, had given these stories renewed\r\nstrength and vigour. Compelled to bow before the triumphant mob, people\r\npreferred to regard themselves--so they silenced their conscience--as\r\nhailing a deliverer. There was some sincerity in this movement of\r\nopinion, too. The same districts which on July 13 took arms against the\r\nbrigands could exclaim, after the crisis had passed: \"The districts\r\napplaud the capture of a fortress which, regarded hitherto as the seat\r\nof despotism, dishonoured the French name under a popular king.\"\r\n\r\nIn his edition of the _Memoirs of Barras_, M. George Duruy has well\r\nexplained the transformation of opinion. \"In the _Memoirs_, the capture\r\nof the Bastille is merely the object of a brief and casual mention.\r\nBarras only retained and transmits to us one single detail. He saw\r\nleaving the dungeons the 'victims of arbitrary power, saved at last from\r\nrack and torture and from living tombs.' Such a dearth of information is\r\nthe more likely to surprise us in that Barras was not only a spectator\r\nof the event, but composed, in that same year 1789, an account of it\r\nwhich has now been discovered. Now his narrative of 1789 is as\r\ninteresting as the passage in the _Memoirs_ is insignificant. The\r\nimpression left by these pages, written while the events were vividly\r\npictured in his mind, is, we are bound to say, that the famous capture\r\nof the Bastille was after all only a horrible and sanguinary saturnalia.\r\nThere is no word of heroism in this first narrative: nothing about\r\n'victims of arbitrary power' snatched from 'torture and living tombs';\r\nbut on the other hand, veritable deeds of cannibalism perpetrated by the\r\nvictors. That is what Barras saw, and what he recorded on those pages\r\nwhere, at that period of his life, he noted down day by day the events\r\nof which he was a witness. Thirty years slip by. Barras has sat on the\r\nbenches of the 'Montagne.'[58] He has remained an inflexible\r\nrevolutionist. He gathers his notes together in view of _Memoirs_ he\r\nintends to publish. At this time, the revolutionist version of the\r\ncapture of the Bastille is officially established. It is henceforth\r\naccepted that the Bastille fell before an impulse of heroism on the part\r\nof the people of Paris, and that its fall brought to light horrible\r\nmysteries of iniquity. This legend, which has so profoundly distorted\r\nthe event, was contemporary with the event itself, a spontaneous fruit\r\nof the popular imagination. And Barras, having to speak of the capture\r\nin his _Memoirs_, discovers his old narrative among his papers, and\r\nreads it, I imagine, with a sort of stupefaction. What! the capture of\r\nthe Bastille was no more than that!--and he resolutely casts it aside.\"\r\n\r\nIn the provinces, the outbreak had a violent counterpart. \"There\r\ninstantly arose,\" writes Victor Fournel, \"a strange, extraordinary,\r\ngrotesque panic, which swept through the greater part of France like a\r\nhurricane of madness, and which many of us have heard our grand-fathers\r\ntell stories about under the name of the 'day of the brigands' or 'the\r\nday of the fear.' It broke out everywhere in the second fortnight of\r\nJuly, 1789. Suddenly, one knew not whence, an awful rumour burst upon\r\nthe town or village: the brigands are here, at our very gates: they are\r\nadvancing in troops of fifteen or twenty thousand, burning the standing\r\ncrops, ravaging everything! Dust-stained couriers appear, spreading the\r\nterrible news. An unknown horseman goes through at the gallop, with\r\nhaggard cheeks and dishevelled hair: 'Up, to arms, they are here!' Some\r\nnatives rush up: it is only too true: they have seen them, the bandits\r\nare no more than a league or two away! The alarm bell booms out, the\r\npeople fly to arms, line up in battle order, start off to reconnoitre.\r\nIn the end, nothing happens, but their terrors revive. The brigands have\r\nonly turned aside: every man must remain under arms.\" In the frontier\r\nprovinces, there were rumours of foreign enemies. The Bretons and\r\nNormans shook in fear of an English descent: in Champagne and Lorraine\r\na German invasion was feared.\r\n\r\nAlong with these scenes of panic must be placed the deeds of violence,\r\nthe assassinations, plunderings, burnings, which suddenly desolated the\r\nwhole of France. In a book which sheds a flood of light on these facts,\r\nGustave Bord gives a thrilling picture of them. The châteaux were\r\ninvaded, and the owner, if they could lay hands on him, was roasted on\r\nthe soles of his feet. At Versailles the mob threw themselves on the\r\nhangman as he was about to execute a parricide, and the criminal was set\r\nfree: the state of terror in which the town was plunged is depicted in\r\nthe journals of the municipal assembly. On July 23, the governor of\r\nChampagne sends word that the rising is general in his district. At\r\nRennes, at Nantes, at Saint-Malo, at Angers, at Caen, at Bordeaux, at\r\nStrasburg, at Metz, the mob engaged in miniature captures of the\r\nBastille more or less accompanied with pillage and assassination. Armed\r\nbands went about cutting down the woods, breaking down the dikes,\r\nfishing in the ponds.[59] The disorganization was complete.\r\n\r\nNothing could more clearly show the character of the government under\r\nthe _ancien régime:_ it was wholly dependent on traditions. Nowhere was\r\nthere a concrete organization to secure the maintenance of order and\r\nthe enforcement of the king's decrees. France was a federation of\r\ninnumerable republics, held together by a single bond, the sentiment of\r\nloyalty every citizen felt towards the crown. One puff of wind sent the\r\ncrown flying, and then disorder and panic bewilderment dominated the\r\nwhole nation. The door was open to all excesses, and the means of\r\nchecking them miserably failed. Under the _ancien régime_, devotion to\r\nthe king was the whole government, the whole administration, the whole\r\nlife of the state. And thus arose the necessity for the domination of\r\nthe Terror, and the legislative work of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAllègre, Latude's fellow prisoner, 154,

See Scott's _Quentin Durward_.--T.\r\n\r\n[2] Jean Balue (1471-1491), chaplain to Louis XI. For traitorously\r\ndivulging the king's schemes to his enemy, the Duke of Burgundy, he was\r\nfor eleven years shut up in the castle of Loches, in an iron-bound\r\nwooden cage.--T.\r\n\r\n[3] A French author (1624-1693) who was involved in the fall of Louis\r\nXIV.'s dishonest finance minister, Fouquet, in 1661, and was imprisoned\r\nfor five years in the Bastille, amusing himself with reading the Fathers\r\nof the Church and taming a spider. See Kitchin's _History of France_,\r\niii. 155-157.--T.\r\n\r\n[4] Antoine de Caumont, duc de Lauzun (1633-1723), a courtier of Louis\r\nXIV., whose favours to the Duke made Louvois, the minister, his bitter\r\nenemy. He was twice imprisoned in the Bastille, the second time at the\r\ninstance of Madame de Montespan. He commanded the French auxiliaries of\r\nJames II. in Ireland. See Macaulay's _History_, Chaps. IX., XII.,\r\nXV.--T.\r\n\r\n[5] A game played with a sort of box, in the top of which are cut holes\r\nof equal size, and with metal discs or balls, the object being to pitch\r\nthe balls into the holes from a distance. A similar game may be seen at\r\nany English country fair.--T.\r\n\r\n[6] The famous president of the Cour des Aides and Minister of the\r\nInterior, renowned for his consistent support of the people against\r\noppression. He was banished in 1771 for remonstrating against the abuses\r\nof law; but returning to Paris to oppose the execution of Louis XVI., he\r\nwas guillotined in 1794.--T.\r\n\r\n[7] Antonio del Giudice, prince de Cellamare (1657-1733), the Spanish\r\nambassador, was the instigator of a plot against the Regent in 1718. See\r\nKitchin, _ib._ iii. 474.--T.\r\n\r\n[8] The Hôtel des Invalides, residence of pensioned soldiers, &c. still\r\na well-known building of Paris.--T.\r\n\r\n[9] A château, four miles east of Paris, notable as the place where St.\r\nLouis, the royal lawgiver of France, dispensed justice. The _donjon_\r\nstill exists, serving now as a soldier's barracks.--T.\r\n\r\n[10] One of the first prisons on the system of solitary confinement in\r\ncells erected in Paris. It dates from 1850.--T.\r\n\r\n[11] The Abbé de Buquoy (1653-1740) owed his imprisonment originally to\r\nhaving been found in company with dealers in contraband salt when the\r\n_gabelle_, or salt-tax, compelled the French people to buy salt, whether\r\nthey wanted it or not, at a price _two thousand times_ its true value.\r\nHe was a man of very eccentric views, one of which was that woman was\r\nman's chief evil, and that was why, when the patriarch Job was stripped\r\nof children, flocks, herds, &c., his wife was left to him!--T.\r\n\r\n[12] The madhouse, eight miles east of Paris.--T.\r\n\r\n[13] A château originally outside Paris, now included in the city\r\nitself, once used as a hospital and jail, now a hospital for aged and\r\nindigent poor and for lunatics. The first experiments with the\r\nguillotine were tried there.--T.\r\n\r\n[14] See _infra_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[15] The title rôle in a comedy by Henri Mounier, entitled _Grandeur et\r\ndécadence de M. Joseph Prudhomme_ (1852). He is a writing-master, very\r\nvain, given (like Mr. Micawber) to tall talk and long-winded periods. He\r\nhas become typical of \"much cry and little wool.\" As an officer of the\r\nNational Guard he says, \"This sabre constitutes the finest day in my\r\nlife! I accept it, and if ever I find myself at the head of your\r\nphalanxes, I shall know how to use it in defence of our\r\ninstitutions--and, if need arise, to fight for them!\"--T.\r\n\r\n[16] In the early days of the Revolution, Paris was divided into\r\nsections or wards, and as the _pike_ had played a great part in the\r\nrecent disturbances, one of the wards was known as the \"Pike\"\r\nsection.--T.\r\n\r\n[17] A disciple of the Marquis de Sade (see p. 35), a notorious\r\ndebauchee, whose book _Justine_ was a disgusting mixture of brutality\r\nand obscenity.--T.\r\n\r\n[18] The pseudonym of Beffroy de Reigny (1757-1811), author of farces,\r\nand of a _Précis historique de la prise de la Bastille_.--T.\r\n\r\n[19] The name given to the constitutional struggles of the nobles and\r\nthe Parlement of Paris against Mazarin and the royal power (1648-1654).\r\nThe name is derived from _fronde_, a sling. A wit of the Parlement, one\r\nBachaumont, \"told the lawyers of that august body that they were like\r\nschoolboys playing in the town ditches with their slings, who run away\r\ndirectly the watchman appears, and begin again when his back is turned.\"\r\nSee Kitchin, iii. pp. 102-128.--T.\r\n\r\n[20] See _Monte-Cristo_.--T.\r\n\r\n[21] Delivered to the French Association for the Advancement of Science\r\nin 1893.\r\n\r\n[22] The battle fought on August 10, 1557, in which Egmont with a\r\ncombined force of Spaniards, Flemish, and English (sent by Queen Mary)\r\nrouted Constable Montmorency and the finest chivalry of France. It was\r\nin commemoration of this victory that Philip II. built the palace of the\r\nEscurial, shaped like a gridiron because the battle was fought on St.\r\nLawrence's day.--T.\r\n\r\n[23] The following unpublished letter from Pontchartrain to Bernaville,\r\nintimating his probable nomination as governor of the Bastille, shows\r\nexactly what Louis XIV.'s government demanded of the head of the great\r\nstate prison:-\r\n\r\n\"Versailles, September 28, 1707.\r\n\r\n     \"I have received your letter of yesterday. I can only repeat what I\r\n     have already written: to pay constant attention to what goes on in\r\n     the Bastille; to neglect none of the duties of a good governor; to\r\n     maintain order and discipline among the soldiers of the garrison,\r\n     seeing that they keep watch with all the necessary exactitude, and\r\n     that their wages are regularly paid; to take care that the\r\n     prisoners are well fed and treated with kindness, preventing them,\r\n     however, from having any communication with people outside and from\r\n     writing letters; finally, to be yourself especially prompt in\r\n     informing me of anything particular that may happen at the\r\n     Bastille. You will understand that in following such a line of\r\n     action you cannot but please the king, and perhaps induce him to\r\n     grant you the post of governor; on my part, you may count on my\r\n     neglecting no means of representing your services to His Majesty in\r\n     the proper light.\r\n\r\n\"I am, &c.,\r\n\r\n\"PONTCHARTRAIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[24] The appellation of the eldest brother of the reigning king.--T.\r\n\r\n[25] Under the _ancien régime_, there being no Minister of the Interior\r\n(Home Secretary), each of the ministers (the War Minister, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, &c.) had a part of France under his charge. The\r\nMinister of Paris was usually what we should call the Lord\r\nChamberlain.--T.\r\n\r\n[26] The court which up to the time of the Revolution was the seat of\r\njustice, presided over by the Provost of Paris. It held its sittings in\r\nthe castle known as the Châtelet.--T.\r\n\r\n[27] A judicial, not a legislative body. It was constantly in antagonism\r\nto the king.--T.\r\n\r\n[28] The famous Encyclopædia edited by D'Alembert and Diderot. It\r\noccupied twenty years of the life of the latter, and went through many\r\nvicissitudes; its free criticism of existing institutions provoking the\r\nenmity of the government. Voltaire was one of its largest\r\ncontributors.--T.\r\n\r\n[29] This raised Linguet's indignation. \"The consideration of this\r\nenormous expense has given to some ministers, among others to M. Necker,\r\na notion of reform; if this should come to anything, it would be very\r\ndisgraceful to spring from no other cause. 'Suppress the Bastille out of\r\neconomy!' said on this subject, a few days ago, one of the youngest and\r\nmost eloquent orators of England.\"\r\n\r\n[30] The Hôtel Carnavalet, museum in Paris, where a large number of\r\ndocuments and books are preserved relating to the history of the\r\ncity.--T.\r\n\r\n[31] It may be noted that the different escapes contributed to the\r\ngradual tightening of the rules of the Bastille. After the escape of the\r\nComte de Bucquoy, such ornaments as the prisoners could attach cords to\r\nwere at once removed, and knives were taken from them; after the escape\r\nof Allègre and Latude, bars of iron were placed in the chimneys, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n[32] The second of the four principal officers of the Bastille. The\r\nofficers were: (1) the governor; (2) the king's lieutenant; (3) the\r\nmajor; (4) the adjutant. There was also a doctor, a surgeon, a\r\nconfessor, &c. The garrison consisted of Invalides.--T.\r\n\r\n[33] The most surprising instance is that of an Englishman, who returned\r\nspontaneously from England to become a prisoner in the Bastille. \"On\r\nThursday, May 22, 1693, at nightfall, M. de Jones, an Englishman,\r\nreturned from England, having come back to prison for reasons concerning\r\nthe king's service. He was located outside the château, in a little room\r\nwhere M. de Besmaus keeps his library, above his office, and he is not\r\nto appear for some days for his examination, and is to be taken great\r\ncare of.\"--Du Junca's Journal.\r\n\r\n[34] This was not the Lauzun already mentioned, but his nephew, Armand\r\nLouis de Gontaut, duke de Biron (1747-1793), who was notorious\r\nthroughout Europe for his gallantries.--T.\r\n\r\n[35] An official of the royal council, whose function originally was to\r\nexamine and report on petitions to the king. He became a sort of\r\nsuperior magistrate's clerk.--T.\r\n\r\n[36] \"1751, March 2. I have received a letter from Dr. Duval (secretary\r\nto the lieutenant of police), in which he tells me that M. Berryer\r\n(lieutenant of police) is struck with the cost of the clothes supplied\r\nto the prisoners for some time past; but, as you know, I only supply\r\nthings when ordered by M. Berryer, and I try to supply good clothes, so\r\nthat they may last and give the prisoners satisfaction.\"--Letter from\r\nRochebrune, commissary to the Bastille, to Major Chevalier.\r\n\r\n[37] These extracts are translated literally, in order to preserve the\r\nclumsy constructions of the unlettered official.--T.\r\n\r\n[38] Step-sister of Louis XIV. The following extracts from her\r\ncorrespondence show how, even in circles that might have been expected\r\nto be well informed, the legend had already seized on people's\r\nimaginations:--\r\n\r\n\"Marly, October 10, 1711. A man remained long years in the Bastille, and\r\nhas died there, masked. At his side he had two musketeers ready to kill\r\nhim if he took off his mask. He ate and slept masked. No doubt there was\r\nsome reason for this, for otherwise he was well treated and lodged, and\r\ngiven everything he wished for. He went to communion masked; he was very\r\ndevout and read continually. No one has ever been able to learn who he\r\nwas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Versailles, October 22, 1711. I have just learnt who the masked man\r\nwas, who died in the Bastille. His wearing a mask was not due to\r\ncruelty. He was an English lord who had been mixed up in the affair of\r\nthe Duke of Berwick (natural son of James II.) against King William. He\r\ndied there so that the king might never know what became of him.\"\r\n\r\n[39] The insurgents who rose for the king against the Revolutionists in\r\nBrittany: see Balzac's famous novel. The movement smouldered for a great\r\nmany years.--T.\r\n\r\n[40] The Gregorian calendar was abolished by the National Convention in\r\n1793, who decreed that September 22, 1792, should be regarded as the\r\nfirst day of a new era. The year was divided into twelve months, with\r\nnames derived from natural phenomena. Nivose (snowy) was the fourth of\r\nthese months. Thus, the period mentioned in the text includes from\r\nDecember 21, 1800, to January 19, 1801.--T.\r\n\r\n[41] Since M. Funck-Brentano's book was published, his conclusions have\r\nbeen corroborated by Vicomte Maurice Boutry in a study published in the\r\n_Revue des Etudes historiques_ (1899, p. 172). The Vicomte furnishes an\r\nadditional proof. He says that the Duchess de Créquy, in the third book\r\nof her _Souvenirs_, gives a _résumé_ of a conversation on the Iron Mask\r\nbetween Marshal de Noailles, the Duchess de Luynes, and others, and\r\nadds: \"The most considerable and best informed persons of my time always\r\nthought that the famous story had no other foundation than the capture\r\nand captivity of the Piedmontese Mattioli.\"--T.\r\n\r\n[42] \"I have seen these ills, and I am not twenty yet.\"\r\n\r\n[43] These verses were, of course, in Latin.--T.\r\n\r\n[44] Palissot was a dramatist and critic who in his comedy _Les\r\nPhilosophes_ had bitterly attacked Rousseau, Diderot, and the\r\nEncyclopædists generally.--T.\r\n\r\n[45] The old prison of Paris. It was the debtors' prison, famous also\r\nfor the number of actors who were imprisoned there under the _ancien\r\nrégime_. It was demolished in 1780.--T.\r\n\r\n[46] \"Not unto us, O Lord, but unto Thy name give glory!\r\n\r\n\"Know our heart and search out our ways.\"\r\n\r\n[47] \"The victory is won!\"--T.\r\n\r\n[48] Charenton was under the direction of a religious order known as the\r\n_Frères de la Charité_, who undertook the care of sick and weak-minded\r\npoor.--T.\r\n\r\n[49] This was Elizabeth Chudleigh (1720-1788), the notorious beauty who\r\nprivately married the Hon. Augustus Hervey, afterwards Earl of Bristol,\r\nseparated from him after three years, and became the mistress of the\r\nsecond Duke of Kingston, whom she bigamously married. After his death\r\nshe was tried by the House of Lords for bigamy, and fled to France to\r\nescape punishment. Her gallantries and eccentricities were the talk of\r\nEurope.--T.\r\n\r\n[50] Instructed by his misfortunes and his captivity how to vanquish the\r\nefforts and the rage of tyrants, he taught the French how true courage\r\ncan win liberty.\r\n\r\n[51] Jocrisse is the stock French type of the booby, and as such is a\r\ncharacter in many comedies. He breaks a plate, for instance; his master\r\nasks him how he managed to be so clumsy, and he instantly smashes\r\nanother, saying, \"_Just like that!_\" His master asks him to be sure and\r\nwake him early in the morning; Jocrisse answers: \"Right, sir, depend on\r\nme; _but of course you'll ring_!\"--T.\r\n\r\n[52] The Girondists (so called from Gironde, a district of Bordeaux)\r\nwere the more sober republican party in the Assembly, who were forced by\r\ncircumstances to join the Jacobins against Louis XVI. With their fall\r\nfrom power in the early summer of 1792 the last hope of the monarchy\r\ndisappeared.--T.\r\n\r\n[53] Referring to the horrible massacres of September, 1792, when about\r\n1400 victims perished.--T.\r\n\r\n[54] The French Dick Turpin. Of good education, he formed when quite a\r\nyouth a band of robbers, and became the terror of France. Like Turpin,\r\nhe is the subject of dramas and stories.--T.\r\n\r\n[55] A forest near Paris, on the line to Avricourt. It was a famous\r\nhaunt of brigands. There is a well-known story of a dog which attacked\r\nand killed the murderer of its master there.--T.\r\n\r\n[56] Literally \"cut-top\": we have no equivalent in English.--T.\r\n\r\n[57] A five-act comedy by Victorien Sardou.\r\n\r\n[58] The nickname given to the Jacobins, the extreme revolutionists, who\r\nsat on the highest seats on the left in the National Assembly.--T.\r\n\r\n[59] Which were the strict preserves of the aristocrats: to fish in them\r\nwas as great a crime as to shoot a landlord's rabbit was, a few years\r\nago, in England.--T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Legends of the Bastille, by Frantz Funck-Brentano",
