These\r\nevents—from the first display of insubordination in the beginning of\r\n1857, to the issue of the Royal Proclamation in the later weeks of\r\n1858—form a series full of the romance as well as the wretchedness of\r\nwar: irrespective of the causes that may have led to them, or the\r\nreforms which they suggested. The sudden rising of trained native\r\nsoldiers in mutiny; the slaughter of officers who to the last moment had\r\ntrusted them; the sufferings of gently-nurtured women and children,\r\nwhile hurrying wildly over burning sands and through thick jungles; and\r\nthe heroism displayed amid unspeakable miseries—all tended to give an\r\nextraordinary character to this outbreak. Nor is it less interesting to\r\ntrace the operations by which the difficulties were met. The task was\r\nnothing less than that of suppressing insurgency among a native\r\npopulation of nearly two hundred million souls by a small number of\r\nBritish soldiers and civilians, most of whom were at vast distances from\r\nthe chief region of disaffection, and were grievously deficient in means\r\nof transport.\r\n\r\nA chronicle of these events reveals also the striking differences\r\nbetween various parts of India. While Behar, Oude, Rohilcund, the Doab,\r\nBundelcund, Malwah, and Rajpootana were rent with anarchy and plunged in\r\nmisery, the rest of India was comparatively untouched. Most important,\r\ntoo, is it to trace the influence of nation, caste, and creed. Why the\r\nHindoos of the Brahmin and Rajpoot castes rebelled, while those of the\r\nlower castes remained faithful; why the Sikhs and Mussulmans of the\r\nPunjaub shewed so little sympathy with the insurgents; why the Hindoos\r\nof Bengal were so timidly quiet, and those of Hindostan so boldly\r\nviolent; why the native armies of Madras and Bombay were so tranquil,\r\nwhen that of Bengal was so turbulent?—were questions which it behoved\r\nthe government to solve, as clues to the character of the governed, and\r\nto the changes of discipline needed. It was a time that brought into\r\nstrong relief the peculiarities of the five chief classes of Europeans\r\nin India—Queen’s soldiers, Company’s soldiers, Company’s ‘covenanted’\r\nservants, ‘uncovenanted’ servants, and residents independent of the\r\nCompany; and it shewed how nobly these classes forgot their differences\r\nwhen the honour of the British name and the safety of India were\r\nimperiled.\r\n\r\nThe history of home affairs during, and in relation to, that period of\r\nstruggle, has its own points of interest—shewing in what manner, amid\r\nthe stormy conflicts of party, the nation responded to the call for\r\nmilitary aid to India, for pecuniary aid to individual sufferers, and\r\nfor a great change in the government of that country.\r\n\r\nAlthough the minor results of the Revolt may be visible to a much later\r\ndate, it is considered that the month of November 1858 would furnish a\r\nconvenient limit to the present narrative. The government of India had\r\nby that time been changed; the change had been publicly proclaimed\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of that empire; the British army in\r\nthe east had been so largely augmented as to render the prospects of the\r\ninsurgents hopeless; the rebel leaders were gradually tendering their\r\nsubmission, under the terms of the Royal Proclamation; the skilled\r\nmutinous sepoys had in great proportion been stricken down by battle and\r\nprivation; the military operations had become little more than a chasing\r\nof lawless marauders; and the armed men still at large were mostly dupes\r\nof designing leaders, or ruffians whose watchwords were pay and plunder\r\nrather than nationality or patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable Expeditions to Persia, China, and Japan are briefly\r\nnoticed towards the close of the volume—on account of the links which\r\nconnected them with the affairs of India, and of the aspect which they\r\ngave to the influence of England in the east.\r\n\r\nEvery endeavour has been made, by a careful examination of available\r\nauthorities, to render the narrative a truthful one. It is hoped that\r\nthe errors are few in number, and that hasty expressions of opinion on\r\ndisputed points have in general been avoided. The Work is quite distinct\r\nfrom the HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN WAR, issued by the same Publishers; yet\r\nmay the two be regarded as companion volumes, relating to the affairs of\r\nEngland in the east—seeing that a few short months only elapsed between\r\nthe close of the events of 1854-5-6 in Turkey, Russia, and Asia Minor,\r\nand the commencement of those of 1856-7-8 in India, Persia, and China.\r\n\r\n                                                                   G.

Within a few months, almost within a few\r\nweeks, China, Persia, and India appeared in battle-array against\r\nher—they being the injurers or the injured, according to the bias of\r\nmen’s judgments on the matter. It may almost be said that five hundred\r\nmillions of human beings became her enemies at once: there are at the\r\nvery least this number of inhabitants in the three great Asiatic\r\nempires; and against all, proclamations were issued and armaments fitted\r\nout. Whether the people, the millions, sided more with her or with their\r\nown rulers, is a question that must be settled in relation to each of\r\nthose empires separately; but true it is that the small army of England\r\nwas called upon suddenly to render services in Asia, so many and varied,\r\nin regions so widely separated, and so far distant from home, that a\r\npower of mobility scarcely less than ubiquity, aided by a strength of\r\nendurance almost more than mortal—could have brought that small force up\r\nto a level with the duties required of it. Considering how small a space\r\na month is in the life of a nation, we may indeed say that this great\r\nOriental outbreak was nearly simultaneous in the three regions of Asia.\r\nIt was in October 1856 that the long-continued bickerings between the\r\nBritish and the Chinese at Canton broke out into a flame, and led to the\r\ndespatch of military and naval forces from England. It was while the\r\nBritish admiral was actually engaged in bombarding Canton that the\r\ngovernor-general of India, acting as viceroy of the Queen of England,\r\ndeclared war against the Shah of Persia for an infringement of treaty\r\nrelating to the city of Herat. And lastly, it was while two British\r\narmaments were engaged in those two regions of warfare, that\r\ndisobedience and disbanding began in India, the initial steps to the\r\nmost formidable military Revolt, perhaps, the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe theologian sees, or thinks he sees, the finger of God, the avenging\r\nrod of an All-ruling Providence, in these scenes of blood-shedding: a\r\npunishment on England for not having Christianised the natives of the\r\nEast to the full extent of her power. The soldier insists that, as we\r\ngained our influence in the East mainly by the sword, by the sword we\r\nmust keep it: permitting no disobedience to our military rule, but at\r\nthe same time offending as little as possible against the prejudices of\r\nfaith and caste among the natives. The politician smitten with\r\nRusso-phobia, deeply imbued with the notion, whether well or ill\r\nfounded, that the Muscovite aims at universal dominion in Europe and\r\nAsia, seeks for evidences of the czar’s intrigues at Pekin, Teheran, and\r\nDelhi. The partisan, thinking more of the ins and outs of official life,\r\nthan of Asia, points triumphantly to the dogma that if _his_ party had\r\nbeen in power, no one of these three Oriental wars would have come upon\r\nEngland. The merchant, believing that individual interest lies at the\r\nbottom of all national welfare, tells us that railways and cotton\r\nplantations would be better for India than military stations; and that\r\ndiplomatic piques at Canton and at Teheran ought not to be allowed to\r\ndrive us into hostility with nations who might be advantageous customers\r\nfor our wares. But while the theologian, the soldier, the politician,\r\nthe partisan, and the merchant are thus rushing to a demonstration, each\r\nof his favourite theory, without waiting for the evidence which can only\r\nby degrees be collected, England, as a nation, has had to bear up\r\nagainst the storm as best she could. Not even one short twelvemonth of\r\npeace was vouchsafed to her. The same year, 1856, that marked the\r\nclosing scenes of one war, witnessed the commencement of two others;\r\nwhile the materials for a fourth war were at the same time fermenting,\r\nunknown to those whose duty it was to watch symptoms.\r\n\r\nFew things in the history of our empire are more astonishing than the\r\nsocial explosion in India, taken in connection with the positive\r\ndeclarations of official men. Historical parallels have often been\r\npointed out, striking and instructive; but here we have a historical\r\ncontradiction. At the time when the plenipotentiaries of seven European\r\nempires and kingdoms were discussing at Paris the bases for a European\r\npeace, the Marquis of Dalhousie was penning an account of India, in the\r\nstate to which Britain had brought it. A statesman of high ability, and\r\nof unquestioned earnestness of purpose, he evidently felt a pride in the\r\nwork he had achieved as governor-general of India; he thought he had\r\nlaid the foundation for a great future; and he claimed credit for\r\nEngland, not only in respect to what she had done, but also for the\r\nmotives that had dictated her Indian policy. It was in the early part of\r\n1848 that this nobleman went out to the East; it was in 1856 that he\r\nyielded the reins of power to Viscount Canning; and shortly before his\r\ndeparture from Calcutta he wrote a minute or narrative, formally\r\naddressed to the East India Company, but intended for his\r\nfellow-countrymen at large, giving an account of his stewardship.\r\nRemembering that that minute was written in March 1856, and that the\r\nRevolt commenced in January 1857, it becomes very important to know,\r\nfrom the lips or the pen of the marquis himself, what he believed to be\r\nthe actual condition of the Anglo-Indian Empire when he left it. The\r\ndocument in question is worth more, for our present purpose, than any\r\nformal history or description of India; for it shews not only the\r\nsum-total of power and prosperity in 1848, but the additions made to\r\nthat sum year after year till 1856. A parliamentary paper of fifty folio\r\npages need not and cannot be reproduced here; but its substance may be\r\nrendered intelligible in a few paragraphs. This we will attempt at once,\r\nas a peculiarly fitting introduction to the main object of the present\r\nwork; for it shews how little the Revolt was expected by him who was\r\nregarded as the centre of knowledge and influence in India. The marquis\r\nsaid: ‘The time has nearly come when my administration of the government\r\nof India, prolonged through more than eight years, will reach its final\r\nclose. It would seem that some few hours may be profitably devoted to a\r\nshort review of those eventful years; not for the purpose of justifying\r\ndisputed measures, or of setting forth a retrospective defence of the\r\npolicy which may, on every several occasion, have been adopted; but for\r\nthe purpose of recalling the political events that have occurred, the\r\nmeasures that have been taken, and the progress that has been made,\r\nduring the career of the administration which is about to close. I enter\r\non that review with the single hope that the Honourable Court of\r\nDirectors may derive from the retrospect some degree of satisfaction\r\nwith the past, _and a still larger measure of encouragement for the\r\nfuture_.’ The words we have italicised are very remarkable, read by the\r\nlight so soon and so calamitously to be afforded.\r\n\r\nThe minute first passes in review the proceedings of the Indian\r\ngovernment with the independent native states, both east and west of the\r\nGanges. How little our public men are able to foretell the course of\r\npolitical events in the East, is shewn by the very first paragraph of\r\nthe governor-general’s narrative: ‘When I sailed from England in the\r\nwinter of 1847, to assume the government of India, there prevailed a\r\nuniversal conviction among public men at home that permanent peace had\r\nat length been secured in the East. Before the summer came, we were\r\nalready involved in the second Sikh war.’ Be it observed that public men\r\n_at home_ are here adverted to: of what were the opinions of public men\r\nin India, the English nation was not kept sufficiently informed. There\r\nhad been British officers murdered at Moultan; there was a rebellion of\r\nthe Dewan Moolraj against the recognised sovereign of Lahore; but the\r\nrenewal of war is attributed mainly to the ‘spirit of the whole Sikh\r\npeople, which was inflamed by the bitterest animosity against us; when\r\nchief after chief deserted our cause, until nearly their whole army, led\r\nby sirdars who had signed the treaties, and by members of the Council of\r\nRegency itself, was openly arrayed against us;’ and when the Sikhs even\r\njoined with the Afghans against us. It was not a mere hostile prince, it\r\nwas a hostile nation that confronted us; and the Indian government,\r\nwhether wisely or not, declared war, put forth its power, maintained a\r\nlong campaign, defeated and subdued the Sikhs, drove back the insurgent\r\nAfghans, and ended by annexing the Punjaub to the British territories.\r\nScarcely had the Anglo-Indian armies been relieved from these onerous\r\nduties, when war called them to the regions beyond the Ganges. Certain\r\nBritish traders in the port of Rangoon had been subjected to gross\r\noutrage by the officers of the King of Ava, in violation of a\r\npre-existing treaty; and the Marquis of Dalhousie, acting on a\r\nhigh-sounding dictum of Lord Wellesley, that ‘an insult offered to the\r\nBritish flag at the mouth of the Ganges should be resented as promptly\r\nand as fully as an insult offered at the mouth of the Thames,’ resolved\r\nto punish the king for those insults. That monarch was ‘arrogant and\r\nover-bearing’—qualities much disapproved, where not shewn by the\r\nCompany’s servants themselves; he violated treaties, insulted our\r\ntraders, worried our envoys, and drove away our commercial agent at\r\nRangoon; and as the government of India ‘could never, consistently with\r\nits own safety, permit itself to stand for a single day in an attitude\r\nof inferiority towards a native power, and least of all towards the\r\ncourt of Ava, war was declared. After some sharp fighting, the kingdom\r\nof Pegu was taken and annexed, ‘in order that the government of India\r\nmight hold from the Burman state both adequate compensation for past\r\ninjury, and the best security against future danger.... A sense of\r\ninferiority has penetrated at last to the convictions of the nation; the\r\nBurman court and the Burman people alike have shewn that they now dread\r\nour power; _and in that dread is the only real security we can ever\r\nhave, or ever could have had, for stable peace with the Burman state_.’\r\nThese words are at once boastful and saddening; but the notions\r\nconveyed, of ‘sense of inferiority’ and ‘dread of power,’ are thoroughly\r\nAsiatic, and as such we must accept them. Another independent state,\r\nNepaul, on the northern frontier of India, remained faithful during the\r\neight years of the Dalhousie administration; it carried on a war of its\r\nown against Tibet, but it was friendly to England, and sent a bejewelled\r\nambassador, Jung Bahadoor, to visit the island Queen. The mountain\r\nregion of Cashmere, stolen as it were from the Himalaya, was under an\r\nindependent chieftain, Maharajah Gholab Sing, who, when he visited the\r\nMarquis of Dalhousie at Wuzeerabad, caught the vice-regal robe in his\r\nhand and said; ‘Thus I grasp the skirts of the British government, and I\r\nwill never let go my hold.’ The governor-general expresses a belief that\r\nGholab Sing ‘will never depart from his submissive policy as long as he\r\nlives;’ while Gholab’s son and anticipated successor, Meean Rumbeer\r\nSing, is spoken of as one who will never give ‘any cause of offence to a\r\npowerful neighbour, which he well knows can crush him at will.’ The Khan\r\nof Khelat, near the western frontier, was brought into close\r\nrelationship, insomuch that he became ‘the friend of our friends, and\r\nthe enemy of our enemies,’ and engaged to give us temporary possession\r\nof such military stations within his territory as we might at any time\r\nrequire for purposes of defence. At the extreme northwest of our Indian\r\nEmpire, the Afghans, with whom we had fought such terrible battles\r\nduring the Auckland and Ellenborough administrations of Indian affairs,\r\nhad again been brought into friendly relations; the chief prince among\r\nthem, Dost Mohammed Khan of Cabool, had been made to see that England\r\nwas likely to be his best friend, and ‘had already shewn that he regards\r\nEnglish friendship as a tower of strength.’\r\n\r\nThus the governor-general, in adverting to independent states, announced\r\nthat he had conquered and annexed the Punjaub and Pegu; while he had\r\nstrengthened the bonds of amity with Nepaul, Cashmere, Khelat, and\r\nCabool—amity almost degraded to abject servility, if the protestations\r\nof some of the chieftains were to be believed.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of the independent states, the marquis directed\r\nattention to the relations existing between the British government and\r\nthe protected or semi-independent states, of which there are many more\r\nthan those really independent. The kingdom of Nagpoor became British\r\nterritory by simple lapse, ‘in the absence of all legal heirs.’ In\r\nbygone years the British put down one rajah and set up another; and when\r\nthis latter died, without a son real or adopted, or any male descendant\r\nof the original royal stock, ‘the British government refused to bestow\r\nthe territory in free gift upon a stranger, and wisely incorporated it\r\nwith its own dominions’—a mode of acquiring territory very prevalent in\r\nour Eastern Empire. The King of Oude, another protected sovereign,\r\nhaving broken his engagements with the Company in certain instances, his\r\nstate was treated like Nagpoor, and added to British India. Satara lost\r\nits rajah in 1849, and as no male heir was then living, that small state\r\nshared the fate of the larger Oude: it was made British. Jhansi, a still\r\nsmaller territory, changed owners in an exactly similar way. The Nizam\r\nof Hyderabad, owing to the Company a sum of money which he was unable or\r\nunwilling to pay, and being in other ways under the Company’s wrath,\r\nagreed in 1853 to give up Berar and other provinces to the exclusive\r\nsovereignty of the British. Early in 1848 the Rajah of Ungool, a petty\r\nchieftain in the Jungle Neehals, resisted the authority of the\r\ngovernment; his raj was taken from him, and he died in exile. The Rajah\r\nof Sikim, a hill-chieftain on the borders of Nepaul, ‘had the audacity’\r\nto seize a Company’s official at Darjeling; as a punishment, all the\r\nterritories he possessed within the plains were confiscated and annexed.\r\nIn Sinde, Meer Ali Morad of Khyrpore, having involved himself in an act\r\nof forgery concerning the ownership of territory, ‘the lands were taken\r\nfrom him, and his power and influence were reduced to insignificance.’\r\nThe Nawab Nazim of Bengal having committed a murder by bastinado, ‘his\r\nhighness’s peculiar jurisdiction and legal exemption were taken away\r\nfrom him; and he was subjected to the disgrace of losing a large portion\r\nof the salute of honour which he had previously received.’ The Nawab of\r\nthe Carnatic died suddenly in 1855; and as he left no male heir, and his\r\nrelations lived very disreputably, the title of nawab ‘was placed in\r\nabeyance:’ that is, the Carnatic was made British territory, and the\r\nseveral members of the nawab’s family were pensioned off. About the same\r\ntime, the Rajah of Tanjore died, in like manner without male issue\r\nbearing his name; and the same process was adopted there as in the\r\nCarnatic—sovereign power was assumed by the Company, and the ex-royal\r\nfamily was pensioned off.\r\n\r\nCounting up his treasures, the governor-general was certainly enabled to\r\nannounce a most extraordinary accession of territory during the years\r\n1848 to 1855. The Punjaub, Pegu, Nagpoor, Oude, Satara, Jhansi, Berar,\r\nUngool, Darjeling, Khyrpore, the Carnatic, and Tanjore, all became\r\nBritish for the first time, or else had the links which bound them to\r\nEngland brought closer. While, on the one hand, it must be admitted that\r\nthe grounds or excuses for annexation would be deemed very slight in any\r\ncountry but India; so, on the other, there can be no doubt that the\r\nMarquis of Dalhousie, and the directors with whom he was acting,\r\nbelieved that these annexing processes were essential to the maintenance\r\nof British power in the East. He takes credit to his government for\r\nhaving settled certain family quarrels among the petty royalties of\r\nGujerat, Buhawalpore, Jummoo, and Mumdote, without paying itself for its\r\nservices: as if it were a virtue to abstain from annexation at such\r\ntimes. The mention made of Delhi must be given in the governor-general’s\r\nown words, to shew how much the descendant of the once mighty Mogul was\r\nregarded as a mere puppet—yet maintaining a certain hold on the\r\nreverence of the people, as was destined to be shewn in a series of\r\nevents little anticipated by the writer of the minute. ‘Seven years ago\r\nthe heir-apparent to the King of Delhi died. He was the last of the race\r\nwho had been born in the purple. The Court of Directors was accordingly\r\nadvised to decline to recognise any other heir-apparent, and to permit\r\nthe kingly title to fall into abeyance upon the death of the present\r\nking, who even then was a very aged man. The Honourable Court\r\naccordingly conveyed to the government of India _authority to terminate\r\nthe dynasty of Timour_, whenever the reigning king should die. But as it\r\nwas found that, although the Honourable Court had consented to the\r\nmeasure, it had given its consent with great reluctance, I abstained\r\nfrom making use of the authority which had been given to me. The\r\ngrandson of the king was recognised as heir-apparent; but only on\r\ncondition that he should quit the palace in Delhi in order to reside in\r\nthe palace at the Kootub; and that he should, as king, _receive the\r\ngovernor-general of India at all times on terms of perfect equality_.’\r\nHow strange do these words sound! A board of London merchants sitting in\r\na room in Leadenhall Street, giving ‘authority to terminate the dynasty\r\nof Timour;’ and then, as a gracious condescension, permitting the\r\nrepresentative of that dynasty to be on terms of ‘perfect equality’ with\r\nwhomsoever may be the chief representative of the Company in India.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Dalhousie pointed to the revenues derivable from the\r\nnewly annexed territories as among the many justifications for his line\r\nof policy. He shewed that four millions sterling were added to the\r\nannual income of the Anglo-Indian Empire by the acquisition of the\r\nPunjaub, Pegu, Nagpoor, Oude, Satara, Jhansi, and Berar—increasing the\r\ntotal revenue from about twenty-six millions in 1848 to above thirty\r\nmillions in 1855.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance of this official document lying in the evidence\r\nit affords how little dread was felt in 1856 of any approaching\r\noutbreak, we proceed with the governor-general’s narrative of the\r\naugmentation and stability of British power in the East, power of which\r\nhe was evidently proud—presenting, of course, as a mere outline, that\r\nwhich his lordship fills up in more detail.\r\n\r\nCredit is claimed in the minute for the improved administrative\r\norganisation both of the old and of the newly acquired territories. Able\r\nmen were selected to administer government in the Punjaub; and so well\r\ndid they fulfil their duties that internal peace was secured, violent\r\ncrime repressed, the penal law duly enforced, prison-discipline\r\nmaintained, civil justice administered, taxation fixed, collection of\r\nrevenue rendered just, commerce set free, agriculture fostered, national\r\nresources developed, and future improvements planned. Not only did the\r\nmarquis assert this; but there is a general concurrence of opinion that\r\nthe Punjaub fell into fortunate hands when its administration came to be\r\nprovided for. In Pegu the administration, less brilliant than in the\r\nPunjaub, is nevertheless represented as being sound in principle;\r\ntranquillity was restored; effective police had secured the safety of\r\nall; trade was increased and increasing; a fair revenue was derived from\r\nlight taxation; ‘the people, lightly taxed and prosperous, are highly\r\ncontented with our rule;’ and, when population has increased, ‘Pegu will\r\nequal Bengal in fertility of production, and surpass it in every other\r\nrespect.’ At Nagpoor the assumption of supreme authority by Britain was\r\n‘hailed with lively satisfaction by the whole population of the\r\nprovince;’ no additional soldier had been introduced thither; the civil\r\nadministration was introduced everywhere; the native army was partly\r\nembodied and disciplined in British pay, and partly discharged either\r\nwith pensions or gratuities. In short, ‘perfect contentment and quiet\r\nprevail; beyond the palace walls not a murmur has been heard; and in no\r\nsingle instance throughout the districts has the public peace been\r\ndisturbed.’ In Berar, we are told, the same phenomena were observed; as\r\nsoon as the cession was made, our numerous disputes with the nizam\r\nended; the civil administration was brought into working order; crime,\r\nespecially the violent crime of _dacoitee_ (gang-robbery without murder)\r\nwas diminished; the ‘admirable little army,’ formerly called the Nizam’s\r\nContingent, was made available as part of the British force; the revenue\r\nrapidly increased; and the public tranquillity had ‘not been disturbed\r\nby a single popular tumult.’ The kingdom of Oude had only been annexed a\r\nfew weeks before the Marquis of Dalhousie wrote his minute; but he\r\nstates that a complete civil administration, and a resident military\r\nforce, had been fully organised before the annexation took place; that\r\nthe troops of the deposed native king were contentedly taking service in\r\nBritish pay; that no zemindar or chief had refused submission to our\r\nauthority; that the best men who could be found available were selected\r\nfrom the civil and military services for the new offices in Oude; and\r\nthat no popular resistance or disturbance had occurred.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more clear and positive than these assertions. Not only\r\ndid the governor-general announce that the Punjaub, Pegu, Nagpoor,\r\nBerar, and Oude had been completely annexed, bringing a large accession\r\nto the British revenues; but that in every case a scheme of\r\nadministration had been framed and established, conducive to the lasting\r\nbenefit of the natives, the honour of the British name, and the\r\ndevelopment of the natural resources of the several districts. Not a\r\nwhisper of discontent, of spirits chafed by change of rulers, did the\r\nmarquis recognise: if they occurred, they reached not him; or if they\r\n_did_ reach him, he passed them by as trifles.\r\n\r\nNor was it alone in the newly acquired territories that credit for these\r\nadvantageous changes was claimed. Improvements in the government of\r\nIndia were pointed out in every direction. The governor-general had been\r\nrelieved from an overwhelming press of duties by the appointment of a\r\nlieutenant-governor for Bengal. A Legislative Council had been\r\norganised, distinct from the Supreme Council: the public having access\r\nto its deliberations, and its debates and papers being printed and\r\nissued to the world. The Indian civil service, by an act passed in 1853,\r\nhad been thrown open to all who, being natural-born subjects of the\r\nBritish sovereign, should offer themselves as candidates for examination\r\nand admission. Young cadets, who previously had been allowed nearly two\r\nyears to ‘idle and loiter’ at the presidencies while studying for\r\nexamination as civilians, were by a new regulation required to complete\r\ntheir studies in a much shorter period, thereby lessening their idleness\r\nand rendering them sooner useful. Periodical examinations of the civil\r\nservants had been established, to insure efficiency before promotion was\r\ngiven. A board of examiners had been founded, to conduct examinations\r\nand superintend studies. All officers of the Indian government had been\r\nformally prohibited from engaging in banking or trading companies; and\r\nany bankruptcy among them entailed suspension from office. In many of\r\nthe civil offices, promotion, before dependent on seniority alone, had\r\nbeen made dependent on merit alone. A pension or superannuation list had\r\nbeen established in many departments, to insure steady and faithful\r\nservice. Three boards of administration for salt, opium, and customs had\r\nbeen replaced by one board of revenue, simpler in its constitution. The\r\nannual financial reports, transmitted to the home government, had\r\ngradually been made more clear, full, and instructive. All the salaries\r\nthroughout India had been placed under the consideration of a special\r\ncommissioner, for equitable revision; and the authorities had determined\r\nthat, in future, no salaries, with a few special exceptions, shall\r\nexceed fifty thousand rupees (about five thousand pounds) per annum.\r\n\r\nNor had legislative reform been wholly forgotten. During the eight years\r\nunder review, laws had been passed or rules laid down for the punishment\r\nof officials guilty of corruption, or accountants guilty of default; for\r\nallowing counsel to prisoners on their trial; for abolishing the\r\nsemi-savage custom of branding convicts; for rendering public officers\r\nmore amenable to public justice; for vesting a right of pardon in the\r\nsupreme government; for improving the procedure in all the civil and\r\ncriminal courts; for rendering the reception of evidence more fair and\r\nimpartial; and, among many less important things, for ‘securing liberty\r\nof conscience, and for the protection of converts, and especially of\r\nChristian converts, against injury in respect of property or inheritance\r\nby reason of a change in their religious belief.’ For the amelioration\r\nof prison-discipline, inspectors of prisons had been appointed in all\r\nthe three presidencies, as well as in Oude, the Punjaub, and the\r\nnorthwest provinces.\r\n\r\nEqually in moral as in administrative matters did the Marquis of\r\nDalhousie insist on the manifold improvement of India during the eight\r\nyears preceding 1856. Schools for the education of natives had been\r\nestablished; the Hindoo College at Calcutta had been revived and\r\nimproved; a Presidency College had been founded in the same city, to\r\ngive a higher scale of education to the youth of Bengal; similar\r\ncolleges had been sanctioned at Madras and Bombay; grants-in-aid to all\r\neducational establishments had been authorised, subject to government\r\ninspection of the schools aided; a committee had been appointed to\r\nconsider the plans for establishing regular universities at Calcutta,\r\nBombay, and Madras; a distinct educational department had been formed at\r\nthe seat of government, with director-generals of public instruction in\r\nall the presidencies and governments; and the East India Company had, by\r\na dispatch framed in 1854, sanctioned a most extensive educational\r\nscheme for the whole of India, to be rendered available to all the\r\nnatives who might be willing and able to claim its advantages. The\r\ndelicate subject of female education had not been forgotten.\r\nInstructions had been given to the officers of the educational\r\ndepartment to afford all possible encouragement to the establishment of\r\nfemale schools, whenever any disposition was shewn by the natives in\r\nthat direction. There is a peculiar difficulty in all that concerns\r\nfemale education in India, arising from the reluctance which has always\r\nbeen shewn by the higher classes of natives to permit the attendance of\r\ntheir daughters at schools. Mr Bethune commenced, and the Marquis of\r\nDalhousie continued, a delicate and cautious attempt to overcome this\r\nunwillingness by establishing a Hindoo ladies’ school at Calcutta; and\r\nthe minute gives expression to an earnest hope and belief that the\r\nfemale character in India will gradually be brought under the elevating\r\ninfluence of moral and intellectual education. As the native mind was\r\nthus sought to be ameliorated and strengthened by education; so had the\r\nprevention or cure of bodily maladies been made an object of attention.\r\nAdditional advantages had been granted to natives who applied themselves\r\nto the study of the medical sciences; the number of dispensaries had\r\nbeen greatly increased, to the immense benefit of the poorer classes of\r\nHindoos and Mohammedans; plans had been commenced for introducing a\r\ncheck to the dreadful ravages of the small-pox; admission to the medical\r\nservice of the Company had been thrown open to natives; and, as a\r\nfirst-fruit of this change, one Dr Chuckerbutty, a Hindoo educated in\r\nEngland, had won for himself a commission as assistant-surgeon in the\r\nCompany’s service.\r\n\r\nIn so far as concerns superstition and religion, the minute narrates a\r\ncourse of proceeding of which the following is the substance. Among the\r\nextraordinary social customs—atrocities they are unquestionably\r\nconsidered in Europe—of India, those of Suttee, Thuggee, Infanticide,\r\nand the Meriah Sacrifice, are mentioned as having undergone much\r\namelioration during the eight years to which the minute relates. The\r\n_suttee_, or burning of widows, had been almost suppressed by previous\r\ngovernor-generals, and the marquis had carried out the plans of his\r\npredecessors: remonstrating where any suttees occurred in independent\r\nstates; and punishing where they occurred in the British and protected\r\nterritories. _Thuggee_, or systematic murder of travellers for the sake\r\nof booty, had been quite suppressed east of the Sutlej; but having\r\nunexpectedly made its appearance in the Punjaub in 1851, it was\r\nthoroughly put down there as elsewhere; those who turned approvers or\r\nking’s evidence against their brother Thugs now form—or rather did form\r\nin 1856—a peaceful industrious colony at Jubbulpoor, where they spun and\r\nwove muslins of exquisite fineness, instead of cutting the throats of\r\nunsuspecting travellers. _Female infanticide_, the result of pride of\r\nbirth and pride of purse—parents murdering their infant daughters either\r\nbecause they cannot afford the marriage expenditure which must one day\r\nbe incurred on their account, or because they see difficulties in\r\nmarrying them suitably—had been greatly checked and discouraged. In the\r\nPunjaub a most signal and singular conquest had been achieved; for the\r\nBritish representative, calling together the chiefs of tribes in 1854,\r\nunfolded to them a plan, ‘the observance of which would effectually\r\nsecure that no man should feel any real difficulty in providing for his\r\ndaughter in marriage;’ whereupon the chiefs, as well as those of the\r\nCashmere tribes, promised that, as the motive for infanticide would thus\r\nin great measure be removed, they would cheerfully aid in suppressing\r\nthe practice. Lastly, the _Meriah sacrifice_—a horrible rite, in which\r\nyoung human victims are sacrificed for the propitiation of the special\r\ndivinity which presides over the fertility of the earth—had been nearly\r\nrooted out from the only district where it was practised, among the hill\r\nand jungle tribes of Orissa. In religious matters, the ecclesiastical\r\nstrength of the established church had been largely increased; clergymen\r\nhad been occasionally sanctioned, besides those acting as chaplains to\r\nthe Company; places of worship had been provided for the servants and\r\nsoldiers of the Company; Protestant churches had been built in places\r\nwhere the worshippers were willing to contribute something towards the\r\nexpenditure; Roman Catholics serving the Company had been provided with\r\nplaces of worship; salaries had been granted to three Roman Catholic\r\nbishops, one in each presidency; the salaries of the priests had been\r\nrevised and augmented; and a wish was manifested to observe justice\r\ntowards the Catholic as well as the Protestant who served his country\r\nwell in the East.\r\n\r\nThus—in the acquisition of territory, in the augmentation of revenue\r\nconsequent on that acquisition, in the administrative organisation, in\r\nthe spread of education, in the provision for religious services, and in\r\nthe plans for improving the moral conduct of the natives—the Marquis of\r\nDalhousie claimed to have done much that would redound to the honour of\r\nthe British name and to the advancement of the millions under British\r\nrule in India. The problem still remains unsolved—Why should India, or\r\nthe native military of that country, have revolted from British service?\r\nLet us see, therefore, whether the governor-general says aught that\r\nthrows light upon the matter in connection with trade and commerce; and\r\nin order to understand this subject clearly, let us treat separately of\r\nProductive Industry and Means of Communication.\r\n\r\nCotton is destined, according to the ideas of some thinkers, to mark a\r\ngreat future for India; but meanwhile we are told in the minute that, by\r\nthe acquisition of Nagpoor and Berar, many fertile cotton districts were\r\nbrought under British rule; and that since the acquisition of Pegu, an\r\nexamination of the cotton-growing capabilities of the northern part of\r\nthat kingdom had been commenced. The tea-culture in Assam had prospered\r\ngreatly during the eight years from 1848 to 1856; the plant had been\r\nlargely introduced into the upper districts of the northwest provinces;\r\nplantations had been established at Deyrah Dhoon, Kumaon, and Gurhwal;\r\nMr Fortune had brought large supplies of Chinese seeds and Chinese\r\nworkmen to India; many of the native zemindars had begun the cultivation\r\non their own account in districts at the foot of the Himalaya; and every\r\nyear witnessed a large increase in the production of Indian tea, which\r\nwas excellent in quality, and sold readily at a high price. In\r\nagriculture generally, improvements of all kinds had been made; an\r\nAgricultural and Horticultural Society had been established in the\r\nPunjaub; carefully selected seeds had been procured from Europe; the\r\ngrowth of flax had been encouraged; the growth of the mulberry and the\r\nrearing of silkworms had been fostered by the government; and a grant\r\nhad been made in aid of periodical agricultural shows in the Madras\r\npresidency. In relation to live-stock, plans had been formed for\r\nimproving the breed of horses; merino and Australian rams had been\r\nintroduced to improve the breed of sheep; and sheep had been introduced\r\ninto Pegu, to the great delight of the natives and the advantage of all;\r\n‘for the absence of sheep leads to a privation in respect of food, which\r\nis severely felt, not only by European soldiers in the province, but\r\nalso by all of every class who are employed therein.’ The forests had\r\nbeen brought under due regulation by the appointment of conservators of\r\nforests at Pegu, Tenasserim, and Martaban; by the careful examination of\r\nthe whole of the forests in the Punjaub; by the planting of new\r\ndistricts, hitherto bare; and by the laying down of rules for the future\r\npreservation and thrifty management of these important sources of timber\r\nand fuel. The inestimable value of coal being duly appreciated, careful\r\nresearches had been made, by order of the government, in the Punjaub,\r\nPegu, Tenasserim, Bengal, Silhet, and the Nerbudda Valley, to lay the\r\ngroundwork for careful mining whenever and wherever good coal may be\r\nfound. Practical chemists and geological surveyors had been set to work\r\nin the Simla Hills, Kumaon, Gurhwal, the Nerbudda Valley, Beerboom, and\r\nJubbulpoor, either to discover beds of ironstone, or to organise\r\nironworks where such beds had already been discovered; and an\r\nexperimental mining and smelting establishment had been founded by the\r\ngovernment among the Kumaon Hills, to apply tests likely to be valuable\r\nin future.\r\n\r\nNext, in connection with means of communication, the channels by and\r\nthrough which commerce permeates the empire, the governor-general had a\r\nvery formidable list of works to notice. Surveys, irrigation and canals,\r\nrivers and harbours, roads, railways, electric telegraphs, and postal\r\ncommunications—had all been made the subjects of great engineering\r\nactivity during the eight years of the Dalhousie administration. A few\r\nwords must be said here on each of these topics; for it becomes\r\nabsolutely necessary, in order to a due appreciation of the narrative of\r\nRevolt about to follow, that we should, as a preliminary, know whether\r\nIndia really had or had not been neglected in these elements of\r\nprosperity in the years immediately preceding the outbreak.\r\n\r\nMeasures, we learn from the minute, had been taken for executing exact\r\nsurveys of all the newly annexed territory in the Punjaub, Pegu, Sinde,\r\nNagpoor, and Berar in the same careful manner as the survey of the older\r\nterritories had been before carried out; and in Central India ‘the\r\nconsent of all the native states has been obtained to the making of a\r\ntopographical survey, and to a demarcation of all the boundaries between\r\nthe several native states, and between the British territories and those\r\nof native states:’ a proceeding expected to lessen the frequency of\r\nfeuds concerning disputed boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe activity in irrigation-works and canal-cutting had unquestionably\r\nbeen very great. In 1854 the Ganges Canal was opened in its main line,\r\nfor the double purpose of irrigation and navigation. A mighty work this,\r\nwhich no mutiny, no angry feelings, should induce the English public to\r\nforget. It is 525 miles in length, and in some parts 170 feet in width;\r\nand considered as a canal for irrigation, ‘it stands unequalled in its\r\nclass and character among the efforts of civilised nations. Its length\r\nis fivefold greater than that of all the main lines of Lombardy united,\r\nand more than twice the length of the aggregate irrigation lines of\r\nLombardy and Egypt together—the only countries in the world whose works\r\nof irrigation rise above insignificance.’ Nor is this all. ‘As a single\r\nwork of navigation for purposes of commerce, the Ganges Canal has no\r\ncompetitor throughout the world. No single canal in Europe has attained\r\nto half the magnitude of this Indian work. It nearly equals the\r\naggregate length of the four greatest canals in France. It greatly\r\nexceeds all the first-class canals of Holland put together; and it is\r\ngreater, by nearly one-third, than the greatest navigation canal in the\r\nUnited States of America.’ Pausing for one moment just to observe that\r\nthe writer of the words here quoted seems to have temporarily forgotten\r\nthe great canal of China, we proceed to state, on the authority of the\r\nminute, that when all the branches are finished, this noble Ganges Canal\r\nwill be 900 miles in length. It will then, by its periodical\r\noverflowings, irrigate _a million and a half of acres_, thus lessening\r\nthe terrible apprehensions of famine or dearth among millions of human\r\nbeings. We may doubt or not on other subjects, but it is impossible to\r\ndoubt the sincerity of the Marquis of Dalhousie when he says: ‘I trust I\r\nshall not be thought vain-glorious if I say that the successful\r\nexecution and completion of such a work as the Ganges Canal would, even\r\nif it stood alone, suffice to signalise an Indian administration.’ But\r\nthis work did not absorb all the energies of the canal engineers; much\r\nof a similar though smaller kind had been effected elsewhere. An\r\nirrigation canal had been begun in the Punjaub, which, when finished,\r\nwould be 465 miles in length, fed from the river Ravee. All the old\r\ncanals formed in the Moultan district of the Punjaub, 600 miles in\r\nlength, had been cleansed, enlarged, and improved, and the distribution\r\nof the waters for the purpose of irrigation placed under judicious\r\nregulation. Irrigation canals had been made or improved in the Derajat,\r\nin the provinces east of the Sutlej, in Behar, and in Sinde. A\r\nmagnificent work had been executed for carrying an irrigation canal over\r\nthe river Godavery; and canals of much importance had been commenced in\r\nthe Madras and Bombay presidencies.\r\n\r\nRivers and harbours had shared in the attention bestowed on irrigation\r\nand canal navigation. The Ganges had been opened to river steamers\r\nbefore 1848, and it only remained to advance in the same line of\r\nimprovement. The Indus, by the conquest of the Punjaub, had been made a\r\nBritish river almost from the Himalaya down to the ocean; steamers had\r\nbeen placed upon it; and it had become a direct route for troops and\r\ntravellers to many parts of Northern India, before attainable only by\r\nthe Calcutta route. All the rivers in the upper part of the Punjaub had\r\nbeen surveyed, with a view to the determination of their capabilities\r\nfor steam-navigation. No sooner was Pegu acquired, than steamers were\r\nplaced upon the Irrawaddy, the great river of that country; and short\r\ncanals of junction between various rivers had been so planned as to give\r\npromise of a complete line of river-steaming from Bassein to Moulmein.\r\nArrangements had been made for placing steamers upon the river\r\nBurhampooter or Brahmaputra, to connect Assam with the Bay of Bengal.\r\nExtensive works had been commenced to improve the navigation of the\r\nGodavery. The channels that lead from Calcutta through the Sundurbunds\r\nto the sea had been enlarged; and a great bridge over the Hoogly near\r\nthe city had been planned. The port of Bombay had been greatly improved,\r\nand large works for water-supply commenced. At Kurachee, at Madras, at\r\nSingapore, at Rangoon, and at other places, engineering improvements had\r\nbeen made to increase the accommodation for shipping.\r\n\r\nWe follow the Marquis of Dalhousie from the river to the land, and trace\r\nwith him the astonishing length of new road constructed or planned\r\nduring his administration. A great trunk-road from Calcutta to Delhi had\r\nbeen extended nearly to the Sutlej; and when the Punjaub became a\r\nBritish possession, plans were immediately marked out for prolonging the\r\nsame road to Loodianah, Umritsir, Lahore, Jelum, Attock, and\r\nPeshawur—thus forming, if all be completed, a magnificent road 1500\r\nmiles in length from Calcutta to the Afghan frontier, available both for\r\ncommercial and military operations. The difficulties of crossing so many\r\nbroad rivers in Northern India is immense, and the cost great; but the\r\nroad, as the minute tells us, ‘will repay a thousandfold the labour and\r\nthe treasure it has cost.’ Then, fine roads had been formed from Patna\r\nto Gya, from Cuttack to Ungool and Sumbhulpore, from Dacca to Akyab, and\r\nthence towards Aracan and Pegu; while vast systems of roads had been\r\nbrought under consideration for Pegu, the Punjaub, Sinde, and other\r\nnewly acquired regions. Engineers had been employed to plan a road from\r\nSimla up to the very Himalaya itself, to connect India with Tibet; as it\r\nwould greatly improve the social position of all the native tribes near\r\nit. When Pegu was attacked, and when a military force was sent thither\r\noverland from Calcutta, hundreds of elephants were employed to force a\r\nway through the forests and roadless tracts between Aracan and Pegu; but\r\nby the spring of 1855 a road had been formed, along which a battalion\r\ncould march briskly on foot.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Dalhousie was not in a position to say so much concerning\r\nrailways in India as ordinary roads. Although railways were brought\r\nunder the consideration of the Company in 1843, nothing was done\r\nregarding them till 1849, when a contract was entered into with a\r\nseparate company to construct a certain length of railway which, if\r\ncontinued, would connect Calcutta with the north and northwest of India.\r\nIn the spring of 1853 the marquis recommended a bold line of policy in\r\nthese matters: the sanction and support, in every available way, of\r\ngreat lines of railway to connect Calcutta with Lahore, Bombay with\r\nAgra, Bombay with Madras, and Madras with the Malabar coast. A qualified\r\napproval of these schemes had been accorded by the East India Company,\r\nand engagements to the extent of ten millions sterling had been made for\r\na railway from Delhi to Burdwan: a line from Burdwan to Calcutta having\r\nbeen opened in 1855. The governor-general, not dreaming of mutinies and\r\nrebellions, named the year 1859 as the probable time of finishing the\r\niron route from Calcutta to Delhi. Besides these engagements with the\r\nEast India Railway Company in the Bengal presidency, contracts had been\r\nmade with the Great India Peninsula Company for a railway from Bombay to\r\nthe Ghaut Mountains; and another with the Bombay and Central India\r\nCompany for a railway from Bombay to Khandeish and Nagpoor, and for\r\nanother from Surat to Ahmedabad. On the eastern coast, the government\r\nhad arranged with the Madras Railway Company for lines from Madras to\r\nthe Malabar coast, _viâ_ Coimbatore, and from Variembaddy to Bangalore.\r\nThe English nation has long blamed the East India Company for a dilatory\r\npolicy in regard to railways; but all we have to do in this place is, on\r\nthe authority of the governor-general, to specify in few words what had\r\nbeen done in the years immediately preceding the outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe electric telegraph—perhaps the grandest invention of our age—found\r\nin India a congenial place for its reception. Where the officials had no\r\nmore rapid means of sending a message to a distance of a thousand miles\r\nthan the fleetness of a corps of foot-runners, it is no marvel that the\r\nachievements of the lightning-messenger were regarded with an eager eye.\r\nAn experimental line of electric telegraph was determined on, to be\r\ncarried out by Dr (now Sir William) O’Shaughnessy; and when that\r\nenergetic man made his report on the result in 1852, it was at once\r\ndetermined to commence arrangements for lines of immense length, to\r\nconnect the widely separated cities of Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and\r\nPeshawur, and the great towns between them. It was a grand idea, and was\r\nworthily realised; for by the month of March 1854 an electric wire of\r\n800 miles was established between Calcutta and Agra; by the month of\r\nFebruary 1855, the towns of Calcutta, Agra, Attock, Bombay, and Madras\r\nwere placed in telegraphic communication by 3000 miles of wire, serving\r\nnearly forty towns on the way; and by the beginning of 1856 another\r\nlength of 1000 miles was added, from Attock to Peshawur, from Bangalore\r\nto Ootacamund, and from Rangoon to the Burmese frontier. Many works of\r\ngreat magnitude were required; there were few good roads for the workmen\r\nto avail themselves of; there were few bridges; there were deadly\r\njungles to be passed; there was every variety of foundation, from loose\r\nblack soil to hard rocky wastes; there were seventy large rivers to be\r\ncrossed, either by cables in the water, or by wires extended on the tops\r\nof masts; there was a cable of two miles required to cross the\r\nToongabudra, and one of three miles to cross the Sone—and yet the entire\r\nwork was comprised within a cost of 500 rupees or £50 per mile: perhaps\r\nthe wisest expenditure ever incurred in India. Repeatedly has a message,\r\nrelating to news from England, been transmitted 1000 miles, from Bombay\r\nto Calcutta, in less than three-quarters of an hour; and it has become a\r\nregular routine that the government at Calcutta shall be in possession\r\nof a considerable body of telegraphic news from England within twelve\r\nhours after the anchoring of the mail-steamer at Bombay. Who can\r\nconceive the bewilderment of the Hindoo mind at such achievements! It is\r\ncertainly permissible to the governor-general to refer with pride to two\r\nor three among many instances of the remarkable service rendered by\r\nthese telegraphs. ‘When her Majesty’s 10th Hussars were ordered with all\r\nspeed from Poonah to the Crimea, a message requesting instructions\r\nregarding their despatch was one day received by me at Calcutta from the\r\ngovernment of Bombay, about nine o’clock in the morning. Instructions\r\nwere forthwith sent off by the telegraph in reply; and an answer to that\r\nreply was again received at Calcutta from Bombay in the evening of the\r\nsame day. A year before, the same communications for the despatch of\r\nspeedy reinforcements to the seat of war, which occupied by the\r\ntelegraph no more than _twelve hours_, could not have been made in less\r\nthan _thirty days_.’ Again: ‘When it was resolved to send her Majesty’s\r\n12th Lancers from Bangalore to the Crimea, instead of her Majesty’s 14th\r\nDragoons from Meerut, orders were forthwith despatched by telegraph\r\ndirect to the regiment at Bangalore. The corps was immediately got ready\r\nfor service; it marched two hundred miles, and was there before the\r\ntransports were ready to receive it.’ Again: ‘On the 7th of February\r\n1856, as soon as the administration of Oude was assuredly under British\r\ngovernment, a branch-electric telegraph from Cawnpore to Lucknow was\r\nforthwith commenced; in eighteen working-days it was completed,\r\nincluding the laying of a cable, six thousand feet in length, across the\r\nriver Ganges. On the morning on which I resigned the government in\r\nIndia, General Outram was asked by telegraph: “Is all well in Oude?” The\r\nanswer: “All is well in Oude,” was received soon after noon, and greeted\r\nLord Canning on his first arrival.’ Little did the new governor-general\r\nthen foresee in how few months he would receive painful proof that all\r\nwas _not_ well in Oude. However, the Marquis of Dalhousie was justified\r\nin adverting with satisfaction to the establishment of telegraphic\r\ncommunication during his reign of power; and he insists on full credit\r\nbeing due to the East India Company for what was done in that direction.\r\n‘I make bold to say, that whether regard be had to promptitude of\r\nexecutive action, to speed and solidity of construction, to rapidity of\r\norganisation, to liberality of charge, or to the early realisation and\r\nvast magnitude of increased political influence in the East, the\r\nachievement of the Honourable Company in the establishment of the\r\nelectric telegraph in India may challenge comparison with any public\r\nenterprise which has been carried into execution in recent times, among\r\nthe nations of Europe, or in America itself.’\r\n\r\nThe postal system had not been allowed to stagnate during the eight\r\nyears under consideration. A commission had been appointed in 1850, to\r\ninquire into the best means of increasing the efficiency of the system;\r\nand under the recommendations of this commission, great improvements had\r\nbeen made. A director-general of the post-office for the whole of India\r\nhad been appointed; a uniformity of rate irrespective of distance had\r\nbeen established (three farthings for a letter, and three half-pence for\r\na newspaper); prepayment by postage-stamps had been substituted for cash\r\npayment; the privileges of official franking had been almost abolished;\r\nand a uniform sixpenny rate was fixed for letters between India and\r\nEngland. Here again the governor-general insists, not only that the\r\nIndian government had worked zealously, but that England herself had\r\nbeen outstripped in liberal policy. ‘In England, a single letter is\r\nconveyed to any part of the British isles for one penny; in India, a\r\nsingle letter is conveyed over distances immeasurably greater—from\r\nPeshawur, on the borders of Afghanistan, to the southernmost village of\r\nCape Comorin, or from Dehooghur, in Upper Assam, to Kurachee at the\r\nmouth of the Indus—for no more than three farthings. The postage\r\nchargeable on the same letter three years ago in India would not have\r\nbeen less than one shilling, or sixteen times the present charge. Again,\r\nsince uniform rates of postage between England and India have been\r\nestablished, the Scotch recruit who joins his regiment on our furthest\r\nfrontier at Peshawur, may write to his mother at John o’ Groat’s House,\r\nand may send his letter to her free for sixpence: three years ago, the\r\nsame sum would not have carried his letter beyond Lahore.’\r\n\r\nSo great had been the activity of the Company and the governor-general,\r\nin the course of eight years, in developing the productive resources of\r\nour Oriental empire, that a department of Public Works had become\r\nessentially necessary. The Company expended from two to three millions\r\nsterling annually in this direction, and a new organisation had been\r\nmade to conduct the various works on which this amount of expenditure\r\nwas to be bestowed. When the great roads and canals were being planned\r\nand executed, numerous civil engineers were of course needed; and the\r\nminute tells us that ‘it was the far-seeing sagacity of Mr Thomason\r\nwhich first anticipated the necessity of training engineers in the\r\ncountry itself in which they were to be employed, and which first\r\nsuggested an effectual method of doing so. On his recommendation, the\r\ncivil engineering college at Roorkee, which now rightly bears his\r\nhonoured name, was founded with the consent of the Honourable Court. It\r\nhas already been enlarged and extended greatly beyond its original\r\nlimits. Instruction in it is given to soldiers preparing for subordinate\r\nemployment in the Public Works department, to young gentlemen not in the\r\nservice of government, and to natives upon certain conditions. A higher\r\nclass for commissioned officers of the army was created some years ago,\r\nat the suggestion of the late Sir Charles Napier; and the government has\r\nbeen most ready to consent to officers obtaining leave to study there,\r\nas in the senior department at Sandhurst. Excellent fruit has already\r\nbeen borne by this institution; many good servants have already been\r\nsent forth into [from?] the department; and applications for the\r\nservices of students of the Thomason College were, before long, received\r\nfrom other local governments.’ But this was not all: civil engineering\r\ncolleges and classes were formed at Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Lahore,\r\nand Poonah.\r\n\r\nSo greatly had the various public works on rivers and harbours, roads\r\nand canals, telegraphic and postal communications, increased the trade\r\nof India, that the shipping entries increased regularly year by year.\r\nThere were about six hundred vessels, exclusive of trading craft, that\r\nascended the Hoogly to Calcutta in 1847; by 1856, the number had\r\naugmented to twelve hundred; and the tonnage had risen in a still\r\ngreater ratio.\r\n\r\nWhat is the English nation to think of all this, and how reconcile it\r\nwith the tragedies destined so soon to afflict that magnificent country?\r\nHere we find the highest representative of the British crown narrating\r\nand describing, in words too clear to be misunderstood, political and\r\ncommercial advancements of a really stupendous kind, effected within the\r\nshort period of eight years. We read of vast territories conquered,\r\ntributary states annexed, amicable relations with other states\r\nstrengthened, territorial revenues increased, improved administration\r\norganised, the civil service purified, legislative reforms effected,\r\nprison-discipline improved, native colleges and schools established,\r\nmedical aid disseminated, thuggee and dacoitee put down, suttee and\r\ninfanticide discouraged, churches and chapels built, ministers of\r\nreligion salaried. We are told of the cultivation of raw produce being\r\nfostered, the improvement of live-stock insured, the availability of\r\nmineral treasures tested, exact territorial surveys completed,\r\nstupendous irrigation and navigation canals constructed, flotillas of\r\nriver-steamers established, ports and harbours enlarged and deepened,\r\nmagnificent roads formed, long lines of railway commenced, thousands of\r\nmiles of electric telegraph set to work, vast postal improvements\r\ninsured. We read all this, and we cannot marvel if the ruler of India\r\nfelt some pride in his share of the work. But still the problem remains\r\nunsolved—was the great Revolt foreshadowed in any of these achievements?\r\nAs the mutiny began among the military, it may be well to see what\r\ninformation is afforded by the minute concerning military reforms\r\nbetween the years 1848 and 1856.\r\n\r\nIt is truly remarkable, knowing what the English nation now so painfully\r\nknows, that the Marquis of Dalhousie, in narrating the various\r\nimprovements introduced by him in the military system, passes at once to\r\nthe _British_ soldiers: distinctly asserting that ‘the position of the\r\n_native_ soldier in India has long been such as to leave hardly any\r\ncircumstance of his condition in need of improvement.’ The British\r\ntroops, we are told, had been benefited in many ways. The terms of\r\nservice in India had been limited to twelve years as a maximum; the\r\nrations had been greatly improved; malt liquor had been substituted for\r\ndestructive ardent spirits; the barracks had been mostly rebuilt, with\r\nmodifications depending on the climate of each station; separate\r\nbarracks had been set apart for the married men of each regiment;\r\nlavatories and reading-rooms had become recognised portions of every\r\nbarrack; punkhas or cooling fans had been adopted for barracks in hot\r\nstations, and additional bed-coverings in cold; swimming-baths had been\r\nformed at most of the stations; soldiers’ gardens had been formed at\r\nmany of the cantonments; workshops and tools for handicraftsmen had been\r\nattached to the barracks; sanitaria had been built among the hills for\r\nsick soldiers; and arrangements had been framed for acclimatising all\r\nrecruits from England before sending them into hot districts on service.\r\nThen, as to the officers. Encouragement had been offered for the\r\nofficers to make themselves proficient in the native languages. A\r\nprinciple had been declared and established, that promotion by seniority\r\nshould no longer govern the service; but that the test should be ‘the\r\nselection of no man, whatever his standing, unless he was confessedly\r\ncapable and efficient.’ With the consent of the Queen, the Company’s\r\nofficers had had granted to them the recognition, until then rather\r\nhumiliatingly withheld, of their military rank, not only in India but\r\nthroughout the world. A military orphan school had been established in\r\nthe hill districts. All the military departments had been revised and\r\namended, the commissariat placed on a wholly new basis, and the military\r\nclothing supplied on a more efficient system than before.\r\n\r\nAgain is the search baffled. We find in the minute proofs only that\r\nIndia had become great and grand; if the seeds of rebellion existed,\r\nthey were buried under the language which described material and social\r\nadvancement. Is it that England, in 1856, had yet to learn to understand\r\nthe native character? Such may be; for _thuggee_ came to the knowledge\r\nof our government with astounding suddenness; and there may be some\r\nother kind of thuggee, religious or social, still to be learned by us.\r\nLet us bear in mind what this thuggee or thugism was, and who were the\r\nThugs. Many years ago, uneasy whispers passed among the British\r\nresidents in India. Rumours went abroad of the fate of unsuspecting\r\ntravellers ensnared while walking or riding upon the road, lassoed or\r\nstrangled by means of a silken cord, and robbed of their personal\r\nproperty; the rumours were believed to be true; but it was long ere the\r\nIndian government succeeded in bringing to light the stupendous\r\nconspiracy or system on which these atrocities were based. It was then\r\nfound that there exists a kind of religious body in India, called Thugs,\r\namong whom murder and robbery are portions of a religious rite,\r\nestablished more than a thousand years ago. They worship Kali, one of\r\nthe deities of the Hindoo faith. In gangs varying from ten to two\r\nhundred, they distribute themselves—or rather _did_ distribute\r\nthemselves, before the energetic measures of the government had nearly\r\nsuppressed their system—about various parts of India, sacrificing to\r\ntheir tutelary goddess every victim they can seize, and sharing the\r\nplunder among themselves. They shed no blood, except under special\r\ncircumstances; murder being their religion, the performance of its\r\nduties requires secrecy, better observed by a noose or a cord than by a\r\nknife or firearm. Every gang has its leader, teacher, entrappers,\r\nstranglers, and gravediggers; each with his prescribed duties. When a\r\ntraveller, supposed or known to have treasure about him, has been\r\ninveigled to a selected spot by the _Sothas_ or entrappers, he is\r\nspeedily put to death quietly by the _Bhuttotes_ or stranglers, and then\r\nso dexterously placed underground by the _Lughahees_ or gravediggers\r\nthat no vestige of disturbed earth is visible.[1] This done, they offer\r\na sacrifice to their goddess Kali, and finally share the booty taken\r\nfrom the murdered man. Although the ceremonial is wholly Hindoo, the\r\nThugs themselves comprise Mohammedans as well as Hindoos; and it is\r\nsupposed by some inquirers that the Mohammedans have ingrafted a system\r\nof robbery on that which was originally a religious murder—murder as\r\npart of a sacrifice to a deity.\r\n\r\nWe repeat: there _may_ be some moral or social thuggee yet to be\r\ndiscovered in India; but all we have now to assert is, that the\r\ncondition of India in 1856 did not suggest to the retiring\r\ngovernor-general the slightest suspicion that the British in that\r\ncountry were on the edge of a volcano. He said, in closing his\r\nremarkable minute: ‘My parting hope and prayer for India is, that, in\r\nall time to come, these reports from the presidencies and provinces\r\nunder our rule may form, in each successive year, a happy record of\r\npeace, prosperity, and progress.’ No forebodings here, it is evident.\r\nNevertheless, there are isolated passages which, read as England can\r\n_now_ read them, are worthy of notice. One runs thus: ‘No prudent man,\r\nwho has any knowledge of Eastern affairs, would ever venture to predict\r\nthe maintenance of continued peace within our Eastern possessions.\r\nExperience, frequent hard and recent experience, has taught us that war\r\nfrom without, or rebellion from within, may at any time be raised\r\nagainst us, in quarters where they were the least to be expected, and by\r\nthe most feeble and unlikely instruments. No man, therefore, can ever\r\nprudently hold forth assurance of continued peace in India.’ Again: ‘In\r\nterritories and among a population so vast, occasional disturbance must\r\nneeds prevail. Raids and forays are, and will still be, reported from\r\nthe western frontier. From time to time marauding expeditions will\r\ndescend into the plains; and again expeditions to punish the marauders\r\nwill penetrate the hills. Nor can it be expected but that, among tribes\r\nso various and multitudes so innumerable, local outbreaks will from time\r\nto time occur.’ But in another place he seeks to lessen the force and\r\nvalue of any such disturbances as these. ‘With respect to the frontier\r\nraids, they are and must for the present be viewed as events inseparable\r\nfrom the state of society which for centuries past has existed among the\r\nmountain tribes. They are no more to be regarded as interruptions of the\r\ngeneral peace in India, than the street-brawls which appear among the\r\neveryday proceedings of a police-court in London are regarded as\r\nindications of the existence of civil war in England. I trust,\r\ntherefore, that I am guilty of no presumption in saying, that I shall\r\nleave the Indian Empire in peace, without and within.’\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is a governor-general’s picture of the condition of the\r\nBritish Empire in India in the spring of 1856: a picture in which there\r\nare scarcely any dark colours, or such as the painter believed to be\r\ndark. We may learn many things from it: among others, a consciousness\r\nhow little we even now know of the millions of Hindostan—their motives,\r\ntheir secrets, their animosities, their aspirations. The bright picture\r\nof 1856, the revolting tragedies of 1857—how little relation does there\r\nappear between them! That there _is_ a relation all must admit, who are\r\naccustomed to study the links of the chain that connect one event with\r\nanother; but at what point the relation occurs, is precisely the\r\nquestion on which men’s opinions will differ until long and\r\ndispassionate attention has been bestowed on the whole subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  [This may be a convenient place in which to introduce a few\r\n  observations on three subjects likely to come with much frequency\r\n  under the notice of the reader in the following chapters; namely,\r\n  the distances between the chief towns in India and the three great\r\n  presidential cities—the discrepancies in the current modes of\r\n  spelling the names of Indian persons and places—and the meanings of\r\n  some of the native words frequently used in connection with Indian\r\n  affairs.]\r\n\r\n  _Distances._—For convenience of occasional reference, a table of\r\n  some of the distances in India is here given.

If we rely\r\n  on one governor-general, the next contradicts him; the\r\n  commander-in-chief very likely differs from both; authors and\r\n  travellers have each a theory of his own; while newspaper\r\n  correspondents dash recklessly at any form of word that first\r\n  comes to hand. Readers must therefore hold themselves ready for\r\n  these complexities, and for detecting the same name under two or\r\n  three different forms. The following will suffice to shew our\r\n  meaning:—Rajah, raja—nabob, nawab, nawaub—Punjab, Punjaub,\r\n  Penjab, Panjab—Vizierabad, Wuzeerabad—Ghengis Khan, Gengis Khan,\r\n  Jengis Khan—Cabul, Caboul, Cabool, Kabul—Deccan, Dekkan,\r\n  Dukhun—Peshawur, Peshawar—Mahomet, Mehemet, Mohammed, Mahommed,\r\n  Muhummud—Sutlej, Sutledge—Sinde, Scinde, Sindh—Himalaya,\r\n  Himmaléh—Cawnpore, Cawnpoor—Sikhs, Seiks—Gujerat, Guzerat—Ali,\r\n  Alee, Ally—Ghauts, Gauts—Sepoys, Sipahis—Faquir, Fakeer—Oude,\r\n  Oudh—Bengali, Bengalee—Burhampooter, Brahmaputra—Asam,\r\n  Assam—Nepal, Nepaul—Sikkim, Sikim—Thibet, Tibet—Goorkas,\r\n  Ghoorkas—Cashmere, Cashmeer, Kashmir—Doab, Dooab—Sudra,\r\n  Soodra—Vishnu, Vishnoo—Buddist, Buddhist, &c. Mr Thornton, in\r\n  his excellent Gazetteer of India, gives a curious instance of\r\n  this complexity, in _eleven_ modes of spelling the name of one\r\n  town, each resting on some good authority—Bikaner, Bhicaner,\r\n  Bikaneer, Bickaneer, Bickanere, Bikkaneer, Bhikanere, Beekaneer,\r\n  Beekaner, Beykaneer, Bicanere. One more instance will suffice.\r\n  Viscount Canning, writing to the directors of the East India\r\n  Company concerning the conduct of a sepoy, spelled the man’s\r\n  name _Shiek Paltoo_. A fortnight afterwards, the same\r\n  governor-general, writing to the same directors about the same\r\n  sepoy, presented the name under the form _Shaik Phultoo_. We\r\n  have endeavoured as far as possible to make the spelling in the\r\n  narrative and the map harmonise.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Vocabulary._—We here present a vocabulary of about fifty words much\r\n  used in India, both in conversation and in writing, connected with\r\n  the military and social life of the natives; with the initials or\r\n  syllables P., Port., H., M., A., T., Tam., S., to denote whether the\r\n  words have been derived from the Persian, Portuguese, Hindustani,\r\n  Mahratta, Arabic, Tatar, Tamil, or Sanscrit languages. Tamil or\r\n  Tamul is spoken in some of the districts of Southern India. In most\r\n  instances, two forms of spelling are given, to prepare the reader\r\n  for the discrepancies above adverted to:\r\n\r\n  _Ab_, _aub_ (P.), water; used in composition thus: _Punjaub_, five\r\n    waters, or watered by five rivers; _Doab_, a district between two\r\n    rivers, equivalent in meaning to the Greek _Mesopotamia_.\r\n\r\n  _Abad_ (P.), inhabited; a town or city; such as _Allahabad_, city of\r\n    God; _Hyderabad_, city of Hyder.\r\n\r\n  _Ayah_ (Port.), a nurse; a female attendant on a lady.\r\n\r\n  _Baba_ (T.), a term of endearment in the domestic circle, nearly\r\n    equivalent to the English _dear_, and applied both to a father and\r\n    his child.\r\n\r\n  _Baboo_, a Hindoo title, equivalent to our _Esquire_.\r\n\r\n  _Bag_, _bágh_, a garden; _Kudsiya bágh_ is a celebrated garden\r\n    outside Delhi.\r\n\r\n  _Bahadoor_ (P.), brave; a title of respect added to the names of\r\n    military officers and others.\r\n\r\n  _Bang_ (P.), an intoxicating potion made from hemp.\r\n\r\n  _Bazar_, _bazaar_, an exchange or market-place.\r\n\r\n  _Begum_ (T.), a princess, a lady of high rank.\r\n\r\n  _Bheestee_, _bihishtí_, a water-carrier.\r\n\r\n  _Bobachee_, _báwarchí_ (T.), an Indian officer’s cook.\r\n\r\n  _Budgerow_, _bajrá_ (S.), a Ganges boat of large size.\r\n\r\n  _Bungalow_, _banglá_ (H.), a house or dwelling.\r\n\r\n  _Cherry_, _cheri_ (Tam.), village or town; termination to the name\r\n    of many places in Southern India; such as _Pondicherry_.\r\n\r\n  _Chit_, _chittí_ (H.), a note or letter.\r\n\r\n  _Chupatty_, _chápátí_ (P.), a thin cake of unleavened Indian-corn\r\n    bread.\r\n\r\n  _Coolie_, _kuli_ (T.), a porter or carrier.\r\n\r\n  _Cutcherry_, _kacharí_ (H.), an official room; a court of justice.\r\n\r\n  _Dacoit_, _dákáit_ (H.), a gang-robber.\r\n\r\n  _Dâk_, _dahk_, _dawk_ (H.), the Indian post, and the arrangements\r\n    connected with it.\r\n\r\n  _Dewan_, a native minister or agent.\r\n\r\n  _Dost_ (P.), a friend.\r\n\r\n  _Feringhee_, a Frank or European.\r\n\r\n  _Fakeer_, _fakír_ (A.), a mendicant devotee.\r\n\r\n  _Ghazee_, _ghazi_ (A.), a true believer who fights against infidels:\r\n    hence _Ghazeepoor_, city of the faithful.\r\n\r\n  _Golundauze_, _golandáz_ (P.), a native artilleryman.\r\n\r\n  _Havildar_ (P.), a native sergeant.\r\n\r\n  _Jehad_ (A.), a holy war.\r\n\r\n  _Jemadar_ (P.), a native lieutenant.\r\n\r\n  _Jhageerdar_, _jaghiredar_, _jágírdár_ (P.), the holder of land\r\n    granted for services.\r\n\r\n  _Mohurrum_ (A.), a fast held sacred by Mohammedans on the tenth day\r\n    of the first month in their year, equivalent to the 25th of July.\r\n\r\n  _Musjid_ (A.), a mosque; thence _jumma musjid_ or _jum’aah masjid_,\r\n    a cathedral or chief mosque.\r\n\r\n  _Naik_, _naig_ (S.), a native corporal.\r\n\r\n  _Náná_, _nena_ (M.), grandfather, a term of respect or precedence\r\n    among the Mahrattas; _Náná Sahib_, so far from being a family or\r\n    personal name, is simply a combination of two terms of respect\r\n    (see _Sahib_) for a person whose real name was Dhundu Punt.\r\n\r\n  _Nawab_, _nabob_, _núwáb_ (A.), derived from _náib_, a viceroy or\r\n    vicegerent.\r\n\r\n  _Nuddee_, _nadi_ (S.), a river.\r\n\r\n  _Nullah_, _nálá_ (H.), a brook, water-course, the channel of a\r\n    torrent.\r\n\r\n  _Patam_, _pattanam_ (S.), a town; the termination of the names of\r\n    many places in Southern India; such as _Seringapatam_, the city of\r\n    Shrí Ranga, a Hindoo divinity.\r\n\r\n  _Peon_ (P.), a messenger or foot-attendant.\r\n\r\n  _Pore_, _poor_, a town; the final syllable in many significant\r\n    names, such as _Bhurtpore_ or _Bharatpoor_, the town of Bharata.\r\n\r\n  _Rajpoot_, a Hindoo of the military caste or order; there is one\r\n    particular province in Upper India named from them _Rajpootana_.\r\n\r\n  _Ryot_, a peasant cultivator.\r\n\r\n  _Sahib_, _saheb_, _sáaib_ (A.), lord; a gentleman.\r\n\r\n  _Sepoy_, _sípahí_, in the Bengal presidency, a native soldier in the\r\n    Company’s service; in that of Bombay, it often has the meaning of\r\n    a peon or foot-messenger.\r\n\r\n  _Shahzadah_ (P.), prince; king’s son.\r\n\r\n  _Sowar_ (P.), a native horseman or trooper.\r\n\r\n  _Subadar_, _soubahdar_ (A.), a native captain.\r\n\r\n  _Tuppal_, _tappál_ (H.), a packet of letters; the post.\r\n\r\n  _Zemindar_, _zamindár_ (P.), a landowner.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The visitor to the British Museum, in one of the saloons of the\r\n  Ethnological department, will find a very remarkable series of\r\n  figures, modelled by a native Hindoo, of the individuals forming a\r\n  gang of Thugs; all in their proper costumes, and all as they are (or\r\n  were) usually engaged in the successive processes of entrapping,\r\n  strangling, and burying a traveller, and then dividing the booty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  There are two Hyderabads—one in the Nizam’s dominions in the Deccan,\r\n  and the other in Sinde (spelt Hydrabad): it is the former here\r\n  intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n           THE ANGLO-INDIAN ARMY AT THE TIME OF THE OUTBREAK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnificent India which began to revolt from England in the early\r\nmonths of 1857; which continued that Revolt until it spread to many\r\nthousands of square miles; which conducted the Revolt in a manner that\r\nappalled all the civilised world by its unutterable horrors—this India\r\nwas, after all, not really unsound at its core. It was not so much the\r\n_people_ who rebelled, as the _soldiers_. Whatever grievances the\r\nhundred and seventy millions of human beings in that wonderful country\r\nmay have had to bear; whatever complaints may have been justifiable on\r\ntheir parts against their native princes or the British government; and\r\nwhatever may have been the feelings of those native princes towards the\r\nBritish—all of which matters will have to be considered in later\r\nchapters of this work—still it remains incontestable that the outbreak\r\nwas a military revolt rather than a national rebellion. The Hindoo\r\nfoot-soldier, fed and paid by the British, ran off with his arms and his\r\nuniform, and fought against those who had supported him; the Mohammedan\r\ntrooper, with his glittering equipments and his fine horse, escaped with\r\nboth in like manner, and became suddenly an enemy instead of a friend\r\nand servant. What effect this treachery may have had on the populace of\r\nthe towns, is another question: we have at present only to do with the\r\nmilitary origin of the struggle.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, it becomes at once necessary that the reader should be\r\nsupplied with an intelligible clue to the series of events, a groundwork\r\non which his appreciation of them may rest. As this work aims at\r\nsomething more than a mere record of disasters and victories, all the\r\nparts will be made to bear some definite relation one to another; and\r\nthe first of these relations is—between the mutinous movements\r\nthemselves, and the soldiers who made those movements. Before we can\r\nwell understand what the sepoys _did_, we must know who the sepoys\r\n_are_; before we can picture to ourselves an Indian regiment in revolt,\r\nwe must know of what elements it consists, and what are its usages when\r\nin cantonments or when on the march; and before we can appreciate the\r\nimportance of two presidential armies remaining faithful while that of\r\nBengal revolted, we must know what is meant by a presidency, and in what\r\nway the Anglo-Indian army bears relation to the territorial divisions of\r\nIndia. We shall not need for these purposes to give here a formal\r\nhistory of Hindostan, nor a history of the rise and constitution of the\r\nEast India Company, nor an account of the manners and customs of the\r\nHindoos, nor a narrative of the British wars in India in past ages, nor\r\na topographical description of India—many of these subjects will demand\r\nattention in later pages; but at present only so much will be touched\r\nupon as is necessary for the bare understanding of the _facts_ of the\r\nRevolt, leaving the _causes_ for the present in abeyance.\r\n\r\nWhat are the authoritative or official divisions of the country in\r\nreference to the governors who control and the soldiers who fight (or\r\nought to fight) for it? What are the modes in which a vast region,\r\nextending more than a thousand miles in many different directions, is or\r\nmay be traversed by rebel soldiers who fight against their employers,\r\nand by true soldiers who punish the rebels? What and who are the\r\nsoldiers thus adverted to; how many, of what races, how levied, how paid\r\nand supported, where cantoned, how officered? These are the three\r\nsubjects that will occupy a brief chapter; after which the narrative of\r\nthe Revolt may with profit be at once entered upon.\r\n\r\nAnd first, for India as an immense country governed by a people living\r\neight or ten thousand miles distant. Talk as we may, there are few among\r\nus who can realise the true magnitude of this idea—the true bearing of\r\nthe relation borne by two small islands in a remote corner of Europe to\r\na region which has been famed since the time of Alexander the Great. The\r\nBritish Empire in India—what does it denote? Even before the acquisition\r\nof Oude, Pegu, and Nagpoor, the British possessions in India covered\r\nnearly 800,000 square miles; but as the influence of England is\r\ngradually extending over the protected and the hitherto independent\r\nstates, we shall best conceive the whole (without Pegu, which is\r\naltogether eastward of what is considered India) as a compact territory\r\nof 1,400,000 square miles—twelve times as large as the United Kingdom,\r\nsixteen times as large as Great Britain, twenty-five times as large as\r\nEngland and Wales: double the size, in fact, of Great Britain, France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Prussia, and Switzerland, all\r\ncombined. Nor is this, like the Russian Empire, a vast but thinly\r\npopulated region. It contains at least a hundred and eighty millions of\r\nhuman beings, more than a hundred and thirty millions of whom are the\r\ndirect subjects of Queen Victoria—that is, if anything _can_ be direct,\r\nconnected with the anomalous relations between the Crown and the East\r\nIndia Company.\r\n\r\nIt comes within the knowledge of most intelligent English readers at the\r\npresent day, that this Indian Empire, governed by a curiously\r\ncomplicated bargain between a sovereign and a company, has been growing\r\nfor a hundred years, and still continues growing. In fits of national\r\nanger or international generosity, we inveigh against the Czar of Russia\r\nfor processes of aggression and plans of annexation in regions around\r\nand between the Caspian and Black Seas, and we compassionate and assist\r\nhis weak neighbours under the pressure of his ambition; but it is only\r\nin times of excitement or peril that we consider the extraordinary way\r\nin which our own Indian Empire has been built up—by conquest, by\r\npurchase, by forfeiture—and in some cases by means which, called robbery\r\nby our enemies, do at any rate demand a little compunction from us as a\r\nChristian people. Exactly a century ago, England scarcely occupied a\r\nfoot of ground in India; her power was almost crushed out by the native\r\nnawab who rendered himself infamous by the episode of the Black Hole at\r\nCalcutta; and it was in the year after that atrocity—namely, in 1757,\r\nthat Clive began those wonderful victories which established a permanent\r\nbasis for a British Empire in Hindostan. And what a continuous growth by\r\nincrement has since been displayed! The Pergunnahs, Masulipatam,\r\nBurdwan, Midnapore, Chittagong, Bengal, Bahar, the Northern Circars,\r\nBenares, all passed into British hands by the year 1775; the next\r\ntwenty-five years brought to us the ownership of Salsette, Nagore, Pulo\r\nPenang, Malabar, Dindigul, Salem, Barramahal, Coimbatore, Canara,\r\nTanjore, and portions of the Deccan and Mysore; in the first quarter of\r\nthe present century the list was increased by the Carnatic, Gorukhpore,\r\nthe Doab, Bareilly, portions of Bundelcund, Cuttack, Balasore, Delhi,\r\nGujerat, Kumaon, Saugor, Khandeish, Ajmeer, Poonah, the Concan, portions\r\nof Mahratta country, districts in Bejapore and Ahmednuggur, Singapore,\r\nand Malacca; in the next period of equal length the acquisitions\r\nincluded Assam, Aracan, Tenasserim, the Nerbudda districts, Patna,\r\nSumbhulpore, Koorg, Loodianah, Kurnaul, Sinde, and the Jullundur Doab;\r\nwhile during the eight years of the Marquis of Dalhousie’s\r\nadministration, as we learn on his own authority, there were added Pegu,\r\nthe Punjaub, Nagpoor, Oude, Satara, Jhansi, and Berar—all these in\r\nexactly a century.\r\n\r\nThe whole of British India is placed under a governor-general, whose\r\nofficial residence is at Calcutta, and who is assisted by a kind of\r\ncabinet or council of ministers. Formerly there were three presidencies,\r\nunder whom the whole territory was placed; two being under the governors\r\nof Bombay and Madras, and the remainder, called the Bengal presidency,\r\nbeing under the governor-general himself, who was to this extent vested\r\nwith a special as well as a general government. But in process of time\r\nit was found impossible for this official to fulfil all the duties\r\nimposed upon him; and the great Bengal presidency became subdivided.\r\nThere are now five local governors of great districts—the\r\ngovernor-general himself, who directly rules many of the newly acquired\r\nregions; the lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces, who rules\r\nsome of the country formerly included in the presidency of Bengal; the\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Lower Provinces, who rules the rest of that\r\ncountry; and the governors of Madras and Bombay, whose range of\r\nterritory has not undergone much increase in recent years. Let us learn\r\na little concerning each of these five.\r\n\r\nMadras, as a presidency or government, includes the whole of the south\r\nof India, where its narrowed, peninsular form is most apparent, up to\r\nabout latitude 16° north, together with a strip still further north on\r\nthe east or Coromandel coast. Its greatest inland extent is about 950\r\nmiles in one direction, and 450 in another; while its shores are washed\r\nby the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal along a coast-line of no less\r\nthan 1700 miles—unfortunately, however, very ill provided with ports and\r\nanchorages. There are about thirty districts and states under the\r\ngovernor’s rule—some as ‘regulation districts,’ others as\r\n‘non-regulation districts,’ and others as ‘native states.’ The\r\ndifference between these three kinds may be thus briefly indicated: the\r\n‘regulation’ districts are thoroughly British, and are governed directly\r\nby the chief of the presidency; the ‘non-regulation’ districts are now\r\nequally British, though of more recent acquisition, but are governed by\r\nagents or commissioners; while the ‘native states’ have still their\r\nnative princes, ‘protected,’ or rather controlled by the British.\r\nWithout any formal enumeration, it may be well to remember that the\r\nfollowing names of some of these districts, all more or less familiar to\r\nEnglish readers as the names of towns or provinces, are included among\r\nthose belonging to the presidency or government of Madras—Masulipatam,\r\nNellore, Chingleput, Madras, Arcot, Cuddalore, Cuddapah, Salem,\r\nCoimbatore, Trichinopoly, Tanjore, Madura, Tinnevelly, Malabar, Canara,\r\nVizagapatam, Kurnaul, Koorg,[3] Cochin, Mysore, Travancore. Some of\r\nthese are not absolutely British; but their independence is little more\r\nthan a name. There are various important towns, or places worth knowing\r\nin connection with Indian affairs, which are included in some or other\r\nof these districts, but not giving their names to them—such as\r\nSeringapatam, Golcandah, Rajamandry, Juggernaut, Vellore, Pulicat,\r\nPondicherry (French), Tranquebar, Negapatam, Bangalore, Ootacamund,\r\nMangalore, Calicut.\r\n\r\nBombay, as a presidency, is a curiously shaped strip. Exclusive of the\r\nsubordinate territories of native princes (over which, however, the\r\nCompany exercises paramount political sway) and of Sinde, which, though\r\nrecently placed under the government of Bombay, may properly be regarded\r\nas a distinct territory—exclusive of these, the presidency occupies a\r\nnarrow strip, of irregular outline, stretching for a considerable\r\ndistance north and south. It occupies the western coast of the\r\npeninsula, from Gujerat on the north, to the small Portuguese settlement\r\nof Goa on the south; and has a length of 650 miles, with a maximum\r\nbreadth of 240. The Bombay provinces included in the strip just noticed,\r\nthe neighbouring territories administered by or on behalf of native\r\nprinces, and Sinde, form three sections about equal in size, the whole\r\ncollectively being thrice as large as England and Wales. To assist the\r\nmemory, as in the last paragraph, we give the names of the chief\r\ndistricts likely to be known to English readers—all of which either\r\nbelong absolutely to the presidency of Bombay, or are more or less under\r\nthe control of the governor—Surat, Baroche, Ahmedabad, Khandeish,\r\nPoonah, Ahmednuggur, Bombay, Concan, Satara, Baroda, Kattywar, Kolapore,\r\nCutch, the Mahratta districts, Kurachee, Hyderabad, Shikarpore,\r\nKhyrpore. The last four are districts of Sinde, conquered by the late\r\nSir Charles James Napier, and placed under the Bombay presidency as\r\nbeing nearer at hand than any of the others. Besides the towns similarly\r\nnamed to most of these districts, the following may be usefully\r\nmentioned—Goa (Portuguese), Bejapore, Bassein, Aurungabad, Assaye,\r\nNuseerabad, Cambay.\r\n\r\nLower Bengal, or the Lower Provinces of Bengal, considered as a\r\nsub-presidency or lieutenant-government, comprises all the eastern\r\nportion of British India, bounded on the east by the Burmese and Chinese\r\nEmpires, and on the north by Nepaul, Sikim, and Bhotan; southward, it is\r\nwashed by the Bay of Bengal; while inland or westward, it reaches to a\r\npoint on the Ganges a little beyond Patna, but not so far as Benares.\r\nFancy might compare it in shape to a dumb-bell, surmounting the upper\r\npart of the Bay of Bengal, which washes its shores throughout a distance\r\nof 900 miles. Without reckoning native states under the control of the\r\nCompany, this lieutenant-governorship is considerably more than three\r\ntimes as large as England and Wales; and nearly the whole of it is in\r\nthe basins of, or drained by, the two magnificent rivers Ganges and\r\nBrahmaputra. On the principle before adopted, we give the names of\r\ndistricts most likely to become familiarised to the reader—Jessore,\r\nBurdwan, Bancorah, Bhaugulpore, Monghir, Cuttack, Balasore, Midnapore,\r\nMoorshedabad, Rungpoor, Dacca, Silhet, Patna, Bahar, Chittagong, the\r\nSunderbunds, Assam, Aracan. Most of these are also the names of towns,\r\neach the chief in its district; but there are other important towns and\r\nplaces not here named—including Calcutta, Cossimbazar, Barrackpore,\r\nChandernagore, Serampore, Culpee, Purneah, Boglipore, Rajmahal, Nagore,\r\nRaneegunge, Jellasore, Dinapore, Bahar, Ramghur, Burhampore.\r\n\r\nNorthwest Bengal, or the Northwestern Provinces of the Bengal\r\npresidency, regarded as a sub-presidency or lieutenant-governorship,\r\ncomprises some of the most important and densely populated districts of\r\nNorthern India. It covers seven degrees of latitude and nine of\r\nlongitude; or, if the portion of the ‘non-regulation’ districts under\r\nthe control of this lieutenant-governor be included, the range extends\r\nto ten degrees of latitude and twelve of longitude. Its boundary is\r\nroughly marked by the neighbouring provinces or states of Sirhind,\r\nKumaon, Nepaul, Oude, Lower Bengal, Rewah, Bundelcund, and Scindiah’s\r\nMahratta territory; but many of these are included among its\r\n‘non-regulation’ territories. In its limited, strictly British\r\nterritory, it is a little larger than England and Wales; but including\r\nthe ‘non-regulation’ provinces, such as Kumaon, Ajmeer, Saugor, &c., it\r\nis vastly larger. As the chief city is Agra, the lieutenant-governorship\r\nis often called by that name: more convenient, perhaps, than the one\r\nofficially adopted—indeed it was at one time determined, though the plan\r\nhas been postponed _sine die_, to form an entirely new and distinct\r\npresidency, called the Presidency of Agra. The Ganges and the Jumna are\r\nthe great rivers that permeate it. As before, we give the names of the\r\nmost familiarly known divisions or districts—Delhi, Meerut, Allygurh,\r\nRohilcund, Bareilly, Shahjehanpoor, Bijnour, Agra, Furruckabad,\r\nAllahabad, Cawnpore, Futtehpore, Benares, Gorukhpore, Azimghur,\r\nJounpore, Mirzapore, Ghazeepore; and if to these we add the names of\r\ntowns not indicated by the names of their districts—such as Simla,\r\nSirhind, Umballa, Loodianah, Shahabad, Buxar—it will be seen how many\r\nplaces noted more or less in Indian affairs lie within this province or\r\nlieutenant-governorship.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of brevity, it may here be remarked, we shall frequently,\r\nin future chapters, use the names ‘Northwest Bengal’ and ‘Lower Bengal,’\r\ninstead of the tedious designations ‘Northwestern Provinces’ and\r\n‘Lieutenant Government of Bengal.’\r\n\r\nAs to the fifth or remaining sphere of government—that which is under\r\nthe governor-general himself—it is with difficulty described; so many\r\nare the detached scraps and patches. The overworked representative of\r\nthe crown, whether his name be Auckland or Ellenborough, Dalhousie or\r\nCanning, finding the governorship of Bengal too onerous when added to\r\nthe governor-generalship of the whole of India, gives up his special\r\ncare of Bengal, divides it into two sub-provinces, and hands it over to\r\nthe two lieutenant-governors. But the increase of territory in British\r\nIndia has been so vast within the last few years, and the difficulty so\r\ngreat of deciding to which presidency they ought to belong, that they\r\nhave been made into a fifth dominion or government, under the\r\ngovernor-general himself. The great and important country of the\r\nPunjaub, acquired a few years ago, is one of the list; it is under the\r\ngovernor-general, and is administered for him by a board of\r\ncommissioners. The kingdom of Oude is another, annexed in 1856, and\r\nsimilarly represented by residents or commissioners acting for and under\r\nthe orders of the governor-general. The province of Nagpoor is a third:\r\na large country in the very centre of India, annexed in 1853, and nearly\r\ntouching all the four governorships already described. Pegu is a fourth,\r\nwrested from the sultan of Burmah, in 1852, and placed under the\r\ngovernor-general’s administration. A fifth is Tenasserim, a strip of\r\ncountry stretching five hundred miles along the eastern shore of the Bay\r\nof Bengal. There are other fragments; but the above will suffice to shew\r\nthat the governor-general has no inconsiderable amount of territory\r\nunder his immediate control, represented by his commissioners. If we\r\nlook at the names of places included within these limits, we shall be\r\nstruck with their number and importance in connection with stirring\r\nevents in India. In the Punjaub we find Peshawur, Attock, Rawul Pindee,\r\nJelum, Ramnugur, Chillianwalla, Wuzeerabad, Umritsir, Lahore, Jullundur,\r\nGhoorka, Ferozpore, Ferozshah, Moodkee; in the once independent but now\r\nBritish province or kingdom of Oude will be found the names of Lucknow,\r\nOude, Fyzabad, Sultanpore, Khyrabad; in the territory of Nagpoor is the\r\ntown of the same name, but other towns of any note are scarce. In Pegu\r\nand Tenasserim, both ultra-Gangetic or eastward of the Ganges, we find\r\nRangoon, Bassein, Prome, Moulmein, and Martaban.\r\n\r\nThe reader has here before him about a hundred and forty names of places\r\nin this rapid sketch of the great divisional governments of India,\r\nmostly the names of important towns; and—without any present details\r\nconcerning modes of government, or numbers governed, natural wealth or\r\nsocial condition—we believe he will find his comprehension of the events\r\nof the great Revolt much aided by a little attention to this account of\r\nthe five governments into which British India is at present divided. As\r\nfor the _original_ names of kingdoms and provinces, nawabships and\r\nrajahships, it scarcely repays the trouble to learn them: when the\r\nnative chiefs were made pensioned puppets, the former names of their\r\npossessions became of lessened value, and many of them are gradually\r\ndisappearing from the maps. We have ‘political residents,’ ‘government\r\nagents,’ or ‘commissioners,’ at the capital city of almost every prince\r\nin India; to denote that, though the prince may hold the trappings of\r\nroyalty, there is a watchful master scrutinising his proceedings, and\r\nclaiming something to do with his military forces. Such is the case at\r\nHyderabad in the Nizam’s territory, at Khatmandoo in Nepaul, at Gwalior\r\nin Scindiah’s dominions, at Indore in Holkar’s dominions, at Bhopal, in\r\nthe country of the same name, at Bhurtpore and elsewhere in the Rajpoot\r\nprinces’ dominions, at Darjeeling in Sikim, at Baroda in the Guicowar’s\r\ndominions, &c.\r\n\r\nThe semi-independent princes of India—mostly rajahs if Hindoos, nawabs\r\nif Mohammedans—are certainly placed in a most anomalous position. There\r\nare nearly two hundred of these vassal-kings, if we may so term\r\nthem—some owning territories as large as European kingdoms, while others\r\nclaim dominion over bits of country not larger than petty German\r\nprincipalities. The whole of them have treaties and engagements with the\r\nBritish government, involving the reciprocal obligations of protection\r\nand allegiance. Some of them pay tribute, others do not; but almost all\r\nhave formally relinquished the right of self-defence, and also that of\r\nmaintaining diplomatic relations with each other. The princes are\r\nregarded as children, expected to look up for protection only to their\r\ngreat mother, the Company. The Company undertakes not only to guarantee\r\nexternal safety but also internal tranquillity in these states, and is\r\nthe umpire in all quarrels between native rulers. Though not called\r\nupon, and indeed not allowed, to defend themselves from an external\r\nattack, the princes mostly have armies, more for show than use under\r\nordinary circumstances; but then they must obtain permission to do this,\r\nand they must limit the numbers; and in some cases there is a\r\nstipulation that if the British be at war in India, the prince must lend\r\nhis troops. It is in this sense that the independent princes of India\r\nare said to possess, collectively, an armed force of little less than\r\nfour hundred thousand men: many of them available, according to treaty,\r\nfor British service.\r\n\r\nNext, we may usefully pay a little attention to this question—How, in so\r\nimmense a country, do the soldiers and subjects of these several states,\r\nBritish and native, travel from place to place: how do they cross\r\nmountains where passes are few, or marshes and sandy plains where roads\r\nare few and bad, or broad rivers where bridges are scarce? The distances\r\ntraversed by the armies are sometimes enormous. Let us open a map of\r\nIndia, and see, for example, the relative positions of Calcutta, Madras,\r\nBombay, Delhi, Peshawur, and Kurachee at the western mouth of the Indus.\r\nDelhi is nearly nine hundred miles from Bombay, more than nine hundred\r\nfrom Calcutta by land, fifteen or sixteen hundred miles from the same\r\ncity by water-route up the Ganges and Jumna, and nearly fourteen hundred\r\nfrom Madras. Kurachee, the most westerly spot in India, and destined one\r\nday, perhaps, to be an important depôt for steamers from the Red Sea or\r\nthe Persian Gulf, is more than sixteen hundred miles from Calcutta,\r\nnearly across the broadest part of India from east to west; while\r\nPeshawur, at the extreme northwest or Afghan frontier, acquired by\r\nEngland when the Punjaub was annexed, is no less than _two thousand_\r\nmiles from Madras. All opinions and judgments, concerning the slowness\r\nof operations in India, must be tempered by a consideration of these\r\nvast distances.\r\n\r\nThe rivers were the great highways of that country before roads existed,\r\nas in other regions; and they have never ceased to be the most\r\nfrequented routes. At least such is the case in relation to the larger\r\nrivers—such as the Ganges, Indus, Nerbudda, Kishna, Jumna, Sutlej, and\r\nJelum. Hindoos and Mohammedans, too poor to hire horses or palkees for\r\nland-travel, may yet be able to avail themselves of their river-boats.\r\n\r\nThe native boats which work on the Ganges are numerous and curious in\r\nkind. The _patella_ or baggage-boat is of saul-wood, clinker-built, and\r\nflat-bottomed, with rather slanting outsides, and not so manageable as a\r\npunt or a London barge; its great breadth gives it a very light draught\r\nof water, and renders it fittest for the cotton and other up-country\r\nproducts, which require little more than a dry and secure raft to float\r\nthem down the stream. The _oolak_ or common baggage-boat of the Hoogly\r\nand Central Bengal, has a sharp bow and smooth rounded sides; it is\r\nfitted for tracking and sailing before the wind, and is tolerably\r\nmanageable with the oar in smooth water. The Dacca _pulwar_ is more\r\nweatherly, although, like the rest, without keel, and the fastest and\r\nmost handy boat in use for general traffic. The _budgerow_, the\r\n_bauleah_, and the ketch-rigged pinnace, are employed by Europeans for\r\ntheir personal conveyance. Besides these, there are numerous others—such\r\nas the wood-boats of the Sunderbunds, of various forms and\r\ndimensions—from one hundred to six thousand maunds burden (a maund being\r\nabout equal to 100 pounds troy); the salt-boats of Tumlook; the light\r\nboats which carry betel-leaf; the Calcutta _bhur_, or cargo-boat of the\r\nport; the Chittagong boats; the light _mug_-boats, with floors of a\r\nsingle hollowed piece of timber, and raised sides, neatly attached by\r\nsewing, with strips of bamboo over the seams; the _dinghee_; and the\r\n_panswee_—all found within the limits of the Bengal presidency. ‘A\r\nnative traveller, according to his degree and substance, engages a\r\ndinghee or a panswee, a pulwar or an oolak; the man of wealth puts his\r\nbaggage and attendants in these, and provides a budgerow or a pinnace\r\nfor his personal accommodation. Officers of high standing in the civil\r\nor military service, travelling with a large retinue of servants and a\r\nquantity of baggage, seldom have less than five or six boats (one of\r\nthem a cooking-boat, and another fitted with an oven for baking bread):\r\nsometimes as many as fifteen when they carry their horses and equipages,\r\nand the materials of housekeeping for their comfortable establishment on\r\narrival.’\r\n\r\nBefore Indian steamers were introduced, or Indian railways thought of,\r\nthe Ganges was the great highway from Calcutta to Benares, Allahabad,\r\nand the northwestern provinces generally, in all cases where speed was\r\nnot required. The Indian government used to allow their military\r\nservants two months and a half for proceeding to Benares, three to\r\nAllahabad, five to Meerut, and nine to Loodianah—periods that seem to\r\nus, in the old country, outrageous in their length. The boats were\r\nchiefly of two of the kinds mentioned in the preceding paragraph—namely,\r\nthe pinnace, very European in its appearance, and the lofty sterned\r\nbudgerow, peculiarly Indian. Even after steamers were placed upon the\r\nGanges, the slow-going budgerow continued to be much used by the\r\nCompany’s officers, and by other persons going northwest—chiefly in\r\ncases where a family and a large quantity of luggage or personal effects\r\nhad to be conveyed; for every other mode than the budgerow then becomes\r\nvery costly—and will probably so continue until the great trunk-railway\r\nis completed. Budgerow boating is, it must be confessed, enough to\r\nstagnate the blood of an active man who wishes to speed onward to a\r\nscene of usefulness. As the tide ends at a few miles above Calcutta,\r\nthere is a constant downward current throughout all the rest of the\r\nGanges; and this current has to be struggled against during the\r\nup-passage. If the wind be favourable, sails are hoisted; but if\r\notherwise, progress is made by _gooning_ or tracking, an operation\r\nperformed by the greater part of the crew proceeding on shore, and with\r\nropes attached to the mast-head, dragging the vessel bodily along:\r\nwading for hours, it may be, through nullahs or creeks more than breast\r\nhigh. The travellers spend much of their time on shore in the cooler\r\nhours of the morning and evening, walking, fishing, or shooting, or\r\notherwise whiling away their time; for they can easily keep up with a\r\nboat that only makes ten miles per average day. The Company have been\r\naccustomed to make a certain allowance to each officer for\r\nboat-accommodation up the country; and it is not unusual for two or\r\nthree to join in the hire of one budgerow, to their mutual comfort, and\r\nwith a small saving out of their allowance. They engage an attendant\r\ndinghee as a cook-boat, to keep the culinary operations at a respectful\r\ndistance; and they fit up their budgerow with camp-tables, camp-stools,\r\ncharpoys or light bedsteads, copper chillumchees or wash-basins, rugs,\r\nhanging lamps, canteens, bullock or camel trunks, and a few other\r\narticles of furniture; with wine, spirits, ale, preserves, cheeses,\r\npickles, salt meats, hams, tongues, and other provisions, which are\r\ncheaper at Calcutta than if purchased on the way; and with their\r\nwardrobes, articles for the toilet, books, chess and backgammon boards,\r\nguns, musical instruments, and other aids to lessen the tedium of a long\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nHitherto, commerce has had so much more to do with this Ganges traffic\r\nthan passenger travel, that the slowness of the progress was not felt:\r\nas in the instance of the canals of England, which, made for goods and\r\nnot for passengers, are not blameable on the score of tardiness. The\r\nGanges is now, as it has been for ages, the main channel for the\r\ncommerce of Northern India. The produce of Europe, of Southern India, of\r\nthe Eastern Archipelago, of China, brought to Calcutta by ocean-going\r\nsteamers or sailing-ships, is distributed upwards to Patna, Benares,\r\nAllahabad, Lucknow, Cawnpore, Agra, Delhi, and other great towns, almost\r\nexclusively by the Ganges route; and the same boats which convey these\r\ncargoes, bring down the raw cotton, indigo, opium, rice, sugar, grain,\r\nrich stuffs, piece-goods, and other grown or manufactured commodities\r\nfrom the interior, either for consumption at Calcutta and other towns on\r\nthe route, or for shipment to England and elsewhere. It is probable that\r\nthe cargo-boats and the budgerows will continue to convey a largo\r\nproportion of the traffic of India, let steamers and railways make what\r\nprogress they may; for there is much local trading that can be better\r\nmanaged by this slow, stopping, free-and-easy Ganges route of boating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Boats on the Ganges.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Ganges steamers are peculiar. Each consists of two vessels, a\r\n_tug_ and a _flat_, neither of which is of much use without the other.\r\nThe tug contains the engine; the flat contains the passengers and\r\ncargo; and this double arrangement seems to have been adopted as a\r\nmeans of insuring light draught. Each flat contains fifteen or twenty\r\ncabins, divided into three classes according to the accommodation, and\r\nobtainable at a fare of twenty to thirty pounds for each cabin for a\r\nvoyage from Calcutta up to Allahabad—less in the reverse direction,\r\nbecause the aid of the stream shortens the voyage. Besides this, the\r\npassenger pays for all his provisions, and most of the furniture of\r\nhis cabin. Every passenger is allowed to take one servant free of\r\npassage fare. The steamer proceeds only during the day, anchoring\r\nevery night; and it stops every three or four days, to take coals into\r\nthe tug, and to deliver and receive passengers. The chief of these\r\nstopping-places are at the towns of Berhampore, Monghir, Patna,\r\nDinapoor, Chupra, Buxar, Ghazeepore, Benares, Chunar, and Mirzapore,\r\nall situated on the banks of the Ganges between Calcutta and\r\nAllahabad; and it is only during the two or three hours of these\r\nstoppages that the passengers have an opportunity of rambling on the\r\nshore by daylight. The tug is of iron, and drags the flat by means of\r\nhawsers and a long beam, which latter serves both as a gangway and to\r\nprevent collision between the two vessels. The East India Company\r\nfirst established these steamers, but others have followed their\r\nexample, and help to keep up a healthy competition. The river distance\r\nto Allahabad being eight hundred miles (three hundred in excess of the\r\nland route), and the time of transit being about twenty days, this\r\ngives forty miles per day as the average rate of progress of the tug\r\nand its attendant flat or accommodation-boat. Of proposed plans for\r\nimproving this Ganges steaming, we do not speak in this place.\r\n\r\nThe Indus is less traversed by boats and steamers; but, being nearer to\r\nEngland than the Ganges, it is becoming more and more important every\r\nyear, especially since the annexation of the Punjaub by the British. The\r\nboats on the Indus take up the produce of the Persian and Arabian gulfs,\r\nCutch, the western districts of India, and so much of the produce of\r\nEurope as is available for Sinde, the Punjaub, and the northwest of\r\nIndia generally: taking back the produce of Afghanistan, Cashmere, the\r\nPunjaub, Sinde, and the neighbouring countries. The boats on this river,\r\nhaving fewer European travellers, do not possess so many accommodations\r\nas those on the Ganges; the scantiness of the population, too, and the\r\nsemi-barbarous condition of the natives, tend towards the same result.\r\nThe Sutlej boats, mostly employed, are long and clumsy; when going\r\ndownwards, the stream gives them a velocity of about two miles an hour,\r\nwhile the oars and sail give them barely another extra mile. They\r\ncorrespond, indeed, rather with our idea of a Thames coal-barge, than\r\nwith that of a boat. The steersman and two oarsmen are at the stern,\r\nworking with a broad paddle and two oars. The passengers occupy the rest\r\nof the vessel, in a rude bamboo cabin twelve or fourteen feet long. When\r\nthe wind and the stream are unfavourable, the sail is hauled down, and\r\ntracking is resorted to. As the up-river return-voyage is exceedingly\r\nslow, a passenger travelling down towards the sea is obliged to pay for\r\nthe return-voyage as well. As there are hardly any important towns on\r\nthe banks below the Punjaub, except Hyderabad, a traveller is obliged to\r\ntake almost the whole of his provisions and necessaries with him. The\r\njourney up the stream is so insupportably tedious by these boats, that\r\nsmall steamers are generally preferred; but these require very light\r\ndraught and careful handling, to prevent them from grounding on the\r\nshoals and sandbanks, which are more numerous in the Indus than in the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nRiver-travelling, it hence appears, is a very slow affair, ruinously\r\ninadequate to the wants of any but a population in a low scale of\r\ncommercial advancement. Let us inquire, therefore, whether\r\nland-travelling is in a condition to remedy these evils.\r\n\r\nThere are so few good roads in India, that wheel-carriages can scarcely\r\nbe trusted for any long distances. The prevailing modes of travel are on\r\nhorseback or in a palanquin. Technically, the one mode is called\r\n_marching_; the other, _dâk_, _dakh_, or _dawk_. The former is sometimes\r\nadopted for economy; sometimes from necessity while accompanying troops;\r\nand sometimes, on short trips, through inclination; but as it is almost\r\nimpossible to travel on horseback during the heat of the day, the more\r\nexpensive but more regular dâk is in greater request. The horseman, when\r\nhe adopts the equestrian system, accomplishes from twelve to twenty\r\nmiles a day: sending on his servants one march or day in advance, with\r\ntent, bedding, tent-furniture, canteen, &c., in order that they may have\r\na meal ready for the traveller by the time he arrives. They daily buy\r\nfodder, fowls, eggs, milk, rice, fruit, or vegetables at the villages as\r\nthey pass through; the traveller, if a sportsman, aids the supply of his\r\nlarder with snipe, wild-fowl, quail, partridges, hares, jungle-cocks, or\r\nbustard; but a week’s provision at a time must be made of all such\r\nsupplies as tea, coffee, dried or preserved meats, sauces, spices, beer,\r\nor wine, at the principal towns—as these commodities are either\r\nunattainable or very costly at the smaller stations and villages. Thus\r\nthe traveller proceeds, accomplishing eighty to a hundred and fifty\r\nmiles per week, according to his supply of horse-relays. We may get rid\r\nof the European notions of inns and hotels on the road: the India\r\nofficer must carry his hotel with him.\r\n\r\nWe come next to the _dâk_ system, much more prevalent than travelling by\r\nhorseback. The dâk is a sort of government post, available for private\r\nindividuals as for officials. A traveller having planned his journey, he\r\napplies to the postmaster of the district, who requires from one to\r\nthree days’ notice, according to the extent of accommodation needed. The\r\nusual complement for one traveller consists of eight _palkee-burdars_ or\r\npalanquin-bearers, two _mussanjees_ or torch-bearers, and two\r\n_bangey-burdars_ or luggage-porters: if less than this number be needed,\r\nthe fact must be notified. The time and place of starting, and the\r\nduration and localities of the halts, must also be stated; for\r\neverything is to be paid beforehand, on the basis of a regular tariff.\r\nThe charge is about one shilling per mile for the entire set of twelve\r\nmen—shewing at how humble a rate personal services are purchasable in\r\nIndia. There is also an extra charge for demurrage or delays on the\r\nroad, attributable to the traveller himself. For these charges, the\r\npostmaster undertakes that there shall be relays of dâk servants\r\nthroughout the whole distance, even if it be the nine hundred miles from\r\nCalcutta to Delhi; and to insure this, he writes to the different\r\nvillages and post stations, ordering relays to be ready at the appointed\r\nhours. The stages average about ten miles each, accomplished in three\r\nhours; at the end of which time the twelve men retrace their steps, and\r\nare succeeded by another twelve; for each set of men belong to a\r\nparticular station, in the same way as each team of horses for an\r\nEnglish stage-coach belongs to a particular town. The rivers and streams\r\non the route are mostly crossed by ferry-boats, for bridges are scarce\r\nin India; and this ferrying is included in the fare charged by the\r\npostmaster; although the traveller is generally expected to give a small\r\nfee, the counterpart to the ‘drink-money’ of Europe, to ferrymen as well\r\nas bearers. The _palanquin_, _palankeen_, or _palkee_, is a kind of\r\nwooden box opening at the sides by sliding shutters; it is about six\r\nfeet in length by four in height, and is suspended by two poles, borne\r\non the shoulders of four men. The eight bearers relieve one another in\r\ntwo gangs of four each. The postmaster has nought to do with the\r\npalanquin; this is provided by the traveller; and on its judicious\r\nselection depends much of his comfort during the journey, for a\r\nbreak-down entails a multitude of petty miseries. The average value of a\r\npalanquin may be about ten pounds; and the traveller can generally\r\ndispose of it again at the end of his journey. On account of the weight,\r\nnothing is carried that can be easily dispensed with; but the traveller\r\nmanages to fit up his palanquin with a few books, his shaving and\r\nwashing apparatus, his writing materials, and a few articles in frequent\r\nuse. The regular fittings of the palanquin are a cushion or bed, a\r\nbolster, and a few light coverings. The traveller’s luggage is mostly\r\ncarried in _petarrahs_, tin boxes or wicker-baskets about half a yard\r\nsquare: a porter can carry two of these; and one or two porters will\r\nsuffice for the demands of any ordinary traveller, running before or by\r\nthe side of the palanquin. The petarrahs are hung, each from one end of\r\na _bangey_ or bamboo pole, the middle of which rests on the bearer’s\r\nshoulder. The torch-bearers run by the side of the palanquin to give\r\nlight during night-travelling; the torch is simply a short stick bound\r\nround at one end with a piece of rag or a tuft of hemp, on which oil is\r\noccasionally dropped from a flask or a hollow bamboo; the odour of the\r\noil-smoke is disagreeable, and most travellers are glad to dispense with\r\nthe services of a second torch-bearer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Palanquin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBishop Heber’s journey from Delhi to Benares was a good example of\r\ndâk-travelling in his day; and the system has altered very little since.\r\nHe had twelve bearers, on account of his route lying partly through a\r\nbroken country. His clothes and writing-desk were placed in the two\r\npetarrahs, carried by the two bangey-burdars. ‘The men set out across\r\nthe meadows at a good round trot of about four miles an hour, grunting\r\nall the way like paviers in England: a custom which, like paviers, they\r\nimagine eases them under their burden.’ Only four men can usually put\r\ntheir shoulders to a palanquin at the same time; but the bishop observed\r\nthat whenever they approached a deep nullah or steep bank, the bearers\r\nwho were not at that time bearing the palanquin, but were having their\r\ninterval of rest, thrust stout bamboos under the bottom of the\r\npalanquin, and took hold of the ends on each side; so that the strength\r\nof several additional men was brought into requisition. In crossing a\r\nstream, ‘the boat (the spot being a regular ferry), a broad and\r\nsubstantial one, had a platform of wood covered with clay across its\r\nmiddle. The palanquin, with me in it, was placed on this with its length\r\nathwart the middle; the mangee steered, and some of the dâk-bearers took\r\nup oars, so that we were across in a very short time.’\r\n\r\nPrivate dâks are occasionally employed, a speculator undertaking to\r\nsupply the bearers. Having no large establishments to keep up, these men\r\ncan afford to undersell the government—that is, establish a lower\r\ntariff; and they provide a little additional accommodation in other\r\nways. Some travellers, however, think these speculators or _chowdries_\r\nnot sufficiently to be trusted, and prefer the government dâk at higher\r\nrates. Experienced men will sometimes dispense with the preliminary of\r\n‘laying a dâk,’ or arranging for the whole journey: depending on their\r\nown sagacity for hunting up bearers at the successive stations. There\r\nhave also been introduced horse-dâks, wheeled palanquins drawn by\r\nhorses; but these are only available on the great trunk-roads recently\r\nexecuted by the government.\r\n\r\nIt was observed, in relation to ‘marching’ or horse-travelling, that\r\nthere are no hotels or inns on the road; there is a partial substitute,\r\nhowever, that may here be noticed. The Company have established\r\ndâk-bungalows at certain stations, varying from fifteen to fifty miles\r\napart, according as the road is much or little frequented. These places\r\nare under the control of government officers: a _khitmutgar_ or servant,\r\nand a porter, attend at each; the traveller pays a fixed sum for the use\r\nof the room, and makes a separate bargain for any few articles of\r\nprovisions that may be obtainable. The building is little more than a\r\nthatched house of one story, divided into two small rooms, to each of\r\nwhich a bathing-room is attached. The servant cooks and serves a meal,\r\nwhile the porter assists in subsidiary offices. If a traveller does not\r\nchoose to avail himself of these bungalows, he can travel continuously\r\nin his palanquin, sleeping and waking by turns. This, however, is a\r\ngreat trial for most persons; because the bearers make an unpleasant\r\ngrunting noise as an accompaniment to their movements; and moreover,\r\nunless well drilled, they do not balance the palanquin well, but subject\r\nits inmate to distressing joltings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Indian Domestics.\r\n\r\n  1.

It is conducted by\r\nrunners, each of whom slings his mail-bag on the end of a stick over his\r\nshoulder. He runs five miles in an hour, and then gives his bag to\r\nanother man, who runs five miles in an hour; and so on. Strictly\r\nspeaking, dâk is an appellation properly belonging to this\r\nletter-carrying system. It is equivalent to the English _post_; and as\r\nthe English have adopted the custom of applying the term post to quick\r\ntravelling as well as to letter-carrying, in like manner have the\r\nAnglo-Indians adopted a double application of the word dâk. It is only\r\nthe express or quick dâk which maintains a speed of five miles an hour;\r\nthe ordinary speed, when the letter-bag is heavy, is four miles. In\r\norder that the runners may not be required to go far from their homes,\r\neach man carries his bag one stage, exchanges bags with another runner\r\nwho has come in the opposite direction, and then returns. A letter may\r\nthus be conveyed a hundred miles in a day—a distance which, considering\r\nthe nature of the system, is quite as great as can reasonably be\r\nexpected. Horse and camel dâks are occasionally employed; but they are\r\nnot easily available, except on good roads. Besides the letter-dâk,\r\nthere is a parcel-dâk or _bangey_, the runner carrying a packet or box,\r\nin which small parcels or newspapers are placed.\r\n\r\nIt will become a duty, in a later portion of this work, to notice\r\nsomewhat fully the railway schemes of India, in relation to the plans\r\nfor developing the industrial resources of that great region; but at\r\npresent this would be out of place, since the Revolt has been dependent\r\non the actual, not the prospective. This actuality, so far as concerns\r\nmeans and modes of travelling, is summed up in a few words. An Indian\r\nofficer, we have seen, must travel to his station by horse or by\r\npalanquin if on land, by drag-boat or by steam-boat if on the rivers. In\r\nany case his rate of progress is slow; his movements are encumbered by a\r\ntrain of servants, by a whole bazarful of furniture and culinary\r\napparatus, and by an anxiously selected provision for his larder. To\r\nmove quickly is well-nigh impossible: all the conditions for it are\r\nwanting. Improvements, it is true, are in progress: steamers of light\r\ndraught and rapid movement are being planned for the rivers; the great\r\ntrunk-road from Calcutta to the Afghan frontier is beginning to offer\r\nfacilities for wheel-carriage transport; and the railways are beginning\r\nto shew their iron tracks in various regions; nevertheless, these are\r\nrather indications of the future than appliances for the present; and\r\nthe Indian officers are not yet in a position to say much about them\r\nfrom personal experience. The humbler soldiers, whether Europeans or\r\nsepoys, are of course less favourably served than the officers. There is\r\nno Weedon in India, connected by rail with a Chatham, a Portsmouth, a\r\nLiverpool, a Leeds, along which a whole regiment can be conveyed in a\r\nfew hours; and as saddle-horses and palanquins are out of the question\r\nfor infantry privates, it becomes necessary to trudge on foot along such\r\nroads as may be available, or to linger on the tardy river route. Once\r\nnow and then, it is true, a daring man, a Napier or an Edwardes, will\r\nswiftly send a small body of troops over a sandy desert or a marshy\r\nplain on camels, horses, elephants, or some exceptional modes of\r\nconveyance; but the prevalent characteristics of travel are such as have\r\nhere been described, and such will doubtless be the case for many years\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, being the territorial arrangements by which Anglo-Indian\r\ntroops are considered to belong to different presidencies and states;\r\nand such the modes in which military as well as civilians must move from\r\nplace to place in those territories; we shall be prepared next to\r\nunderstand something about the soldiers themselves—the Anglo-Indian\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nIn no country in Europe is there an army so anomalous in its\r\nconstruction as that which, until lately, belonged to the East India\r\nCompany. Different kinds of troops, and troops from different provinces,\r\nwe can well understand. For instance, the French avail themselves of a\r\nfew Algerine Arabs, and a small foreign legion, as components in the\r\nregular army. The English have a few colonial corps in addition to the\r\nQueen’s army. The Prussians have a _landwehr_ or militia equal in\r\nmagnitude to the regular army itself. The Russians have military\r\ncolonists as well as military tributaries, in addition to the great\r\n_corps d’armée_. The Austrians have their peculiar Military Frontier\r\nregiments, besides the regular troops furnished by the dozen or score of\r\ndistinct provinces and kingdoms which form their empire. The German\r\nStates provide their several contingents to form (if the States can ever\r\nbring themselves to a unity of opinion) an Army of the Confederation.\r\nThe Neapolitans employ Swiss mercenaries as a portion of their army. The\r\nRomans, the subjects of the pope as a temporal prince, have the\r\n‘protection’ of French and Austrian bayonets, in addition to a small\r\nnative force. The Turks have their regular army, aided (or sometimes\r\nobstructed) by the contingents of vassal-pachas and the irregulars from\r\nmountain districts. But none of these resemble the East India Company’s\r\narmy. Under an ordinary state of affairs, and without reference to the\r\nmutiny of 1857, the Indian army is in theory a strange conglomerate. The\r\nQueen _lends_ some of her English troops, for which the Company pay; the\r\nCompany enlist other English troops on their own account; they maintain\r\nthree complete armies among the natives of India who are their subjects;\r\nthey raise irregular corps or regiments in the states not so fully\r\nbelonging to them; they claim the services of the troops belonging to\r\ncertain tributary princes, whenever exigency arises; and the whole of\r\nthese troops are placed under the generalship of a commander-in-chief,\r\nwho is appointed—not by the Company, who have to pay for all—but by the\r\nQueen or the British government.\r\n\r\nThe Company’s army rose by degrees, as the territorial possessions\r\nincreased. At first the troops were little better than adventurers who\r\nsold their swords to the highest bidders, and fought for pay and rations\r\nwithout regard to the justice of the cause in which they were engaged;\r\nmany were liberated convicts, many were deserters from various European\r\narmies, some were Africans, while a few were Topasses, a mixed race of\r\nIndo-Portuguese. The first regular English troops seen in Bengal were an\r\nensign and thirty privates, sent from Madras to quell a petty\r\ndisturbance at the Company’s factory in the Hoogly. Gradually, as the\r\nnumbers increased and the organisation improved, the weapons underwent\r\nchanges. The troops originally were armed with muskets, swords, and\r\npikes twelve or fourteen feet long: the pikemen in the centre of the\r\nbattalion or company, and the musketeers on the flank. In the beginning\r\nof the last century the pikes were abandoned, and the soldiers armed\r\nwith bayonets in addition to the muskets and swords. When the custom was\r\nadopted, from European example, of forming the companies into a regular\r\nbattalion, the swords were abolished, and the common soldiers left only\r\nwith muskets and bayonets. Various changes were made during the century,\r\nassimilating the troops more and more to those of the English crown, in\r\nweapons and accoutrements.\r\n\r\nThe regiments became, by successive ameliorations, composed almost\r\nwholly of native Hindoos and Mohammedans, officered to some extent by\r\nEuropeans. An English sergeant was given to each company, and a\r\ndrill-sergeant and sergeant-major to each battalion. Afterwards, when\r\nthe battalions were formed into regiments, natives were appointed as\r\nsergeants of companies; and then the only European non-commissioned\r\nofficers were a sergeant-major and a quartermaster-sergeant. By the time\r\nof Lord Clive’s achievements, just about a century ago, three armies\r\nwere owned by the Company—one in Bengal or the Calcutta presidency, one\r\nin the Coromandel or Madras presidency, and one on the Malabar coast,\r\nsouth of the present station of Bombay. These three armies were totally\r\nseparate and distinct, each under its own commander, and each presenting\r\nsome peculiarities of organisation; but they occasionally joined as one\r\narmy for large military operations. There were many native corps, and a\r\nfew European corps; but all alike were officered by Europeans. The\r\ncadet, the young man sent out from England to ‘make his fortune’ in\r\nIndia, was appointed to a native corps or a European corps at the choice\r\nof the commander. The pay being good and regular, and the customs and\r\nprejudices respected, the sepoys, sipahis, or native soldiers became in\r\nmost cases faithful servants to the Company, obeying their native\r\nofficers, who, in their turn, were accountable to the European officers.\r\nThe European and the native corps were alike formed by enlistment: the\r\nCompany compelling no one to serve but those who deemed the pay and\r\nother arrangements sufficient. An endeavour was made at that time\r\n(afterwards abandoned) to equalise the Hindoos and Mohammedans in\r\nnumbers as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom an early period in the Company’s history, a certain number of\r\nregiments from the British royal army were lent for Indian service; the\r\nnumber being specified by charter or statute; and the whole expense, of\r\nevery kind, being defrayed by the Company—including, by a more modern\r\narrangement, retiring pay and pensions. There were thus, in effect, at\r\nall times two English armies in India; the one enlisted by the Company,\r\nthe other lent by the Crown; and it was a matter of some difficulty to\r\nobviate jealousies and piques between the two corps. For, on the one\r\nhand, the officers of the Company’s troops had better pay and more\r\nprofitable stations assigned to them; while, on the other hand, the\r\nroyal officers had precedence and greater honour. A Company’s captain,\r\nhowever so many years he might have served, was subordinate even to the\r\nyoungest royal captain, who assumed command over him by right. At\r\nlength, in 1796, the commissions received by the Company’s officers were\r\nrecognised by the crown; and the two corps became placed on a level in\r\npay and privileges.\r\n\r\nThe year just named witnessed a new organisation also of the native\r\narmy. A regiment was ordered to be of two thousand men, in two corps or\r\nbattalions of one thousand each; and each battalion was divided into ten\r\ncompanies, with two native officers to each company. Thus there were\r\nforty native officers in each of these large regiments. Besides these,\r\nthere were half as many European officers as were allowed to a European\r\nregiment of the same magnitude. There had before been a native\r\ncommandant to each battalion; but he was now superseded by a European\r\nfield-officer, somewhat to the dissatisfaction of the men. The service\r\noccasionally suffered from this change; for a regiment was transferred\r\nat once from a native who had risen to command by experience and good\r\nconduct, to a person sent out from England who had to learn his duties\r\nas a leader of native troops after he went out. The youngest English\r\nensign, perhaps a beardless boy, received promotion before any native,\r\nhowever old and tried in the service. And hence arose the custom,\r\nobserved down to recent times, of paying no attention to the merits of\r\nthe natives as a spur to promotion, allowing seniority to determine the\r\nrise from one grade to another.\r\n\r\nWhile on the one hand the natives volunteered as soldiers in the\r\nCompany’s service, and were eligible to rise to a certain rank as\r\nregimental officers; the English officers, on the other, had their own\r\nparticular routine and hopes of preferment. The cadets or youths went\r\nout partially educated by the Company in England, especially those\r\nintended for the artillery and engineer departments; and when settled\r\nwith their regiments in India as officers, all rose by seniority; the\r\nengineers and artillery in their own corps, the cavalry and infantry in\r\ntheir own regiments. It often happened, however, that when few deaths\r\noccurred by war, officers reached middle life without much advancement,\r\nand retired after twenty years or more of service with the pay of the\r\nrank they then held. In 1836, however, a law was made to insure that the\r\nretiring allowance should not be below a certain minimum: if an officer\r\nserved twenty-three years, he retired with captain’s pay; if\r\ntwenty-seven years, with major’s pay; if thirty-one years, with\r\nlieutenant-colonel’s pay; if thirty-five years, with colonel’s\r\npay—whatever might have been his actual rank at the date of his\r\nretirement. There was also permission for them to sell their\r\ncommissions, although those commissions were not bought by them in the\r\nfirst instance.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the sepoy was well paid, considering the small value of\r\nlabour and personal services in his country; and thus it arose that the\r\nCompany had seldom any difficulty in obtaining troops. The sepoys were\r\nvolunteers in the full sense of the word. Their pay, though small in our\r\nestimation, was high in proportion to the station they formerly held.\r\nThe Bengal Infantry sepoy received seven rupees (fourteen shillings) per\r\nmonth, with an additional rupee after sixteen years’ service, and two\r\nafter twenty years. A havildar or sergeant received fourteen rupees; a\r\njemadar or lieutenant twenty-four rupees; and a subadar or captain\r\nsixty-seven rupees. This pay was relatively so good, that each man was\r\nusually able to send two-thirds of it to his relations. And he was not a\r\nstranger to them at the end of his term, like a Russian soldier; for it\r\nwas a part of the system to allow him periodical furlough or leave of\r\nabsence, to visit his friends. If unfit for military service after\r\nfifteen months’ duty, he retired on a life-pension sufficient to support\r\nhim in his own simple way of life. Whether he _ought_, in moral\r\nfairness, to be grateful towards the rulers who fed and clothed him, is\r\njust one of those questions on which Indian officers have differed and\r\nstill differ. Viewed by the aid of the experience furnished by recent\r\nevents, many of the former encomiums on the sepoys, as men grateful for\r\nblessings conferred, read strangely. The Marquis of Dalhousie’s\r\nstatement, that ‘The position of the native soldier in India has long\r\nbeen such as to leave hardly any circumstance of his condition in need\r\nof improvement,’ has already been adverted to. To this we may add the\r\nwords of Captain Rafter: ‘We assert, on personal knowledge and reliable\r\ntestimony, that the attachment of the sepoy to his English officer, and\r\nthrough him to the English government, is of an enduring as well as an\r\nendearing nature, that will long bid defiance to the machinations of\r\nevery enemy to British supremacy, either foreign or domestic.’[4] In\r\nanother authority we find that the sepoy, when his term of military\r\nservice has expired, ‘goes back to live in ease and dignity, to teach\r\nhis children to love and venerate that mighty abstraction the Company,\r\nand to extend the influence of England still further throughout the\r\nramifications of native society. Under such a system, although temporary\r\ninsubordination may and sometimes does occur in particular regiments, it\r\nis invariably caused by temporary grievances. General disaffection\r\ncannot exist—desertion is unknown.’ But the validity or groundlessness\r\nof such opinions we do not touch upon here: they must be reserved to a\r\nlater chapter, when the _causes_ of the mutiny will come under review.\r\nWe pass on at once, therefore, from this brief notice of the origin of\r\nthe Company’s army, to its actual condition at and shortly before the\r\nperiod of the outbreak.\r\n\r\nShould it be asked what, during recent years, has been the number of\r\ntroops in India, the answer must depend upon the scope given to the\r\nquestion. If we mention Queen’s troops only, the number has been usually\r\nabout 24,000; if Queen’s troops and the Company’s European troops, about\r\n42,000; if the Company’s native regulars be added to these, the number\r\nrises to 220,000; if the Company’s irregular corps of horse be included,\r\nthere are 280,000; if it include the contingents supplied by native\r\nprinces, the number amounts to 320,000; and lastly, if to these be added\r\nthe armies of the independent and semi-independent princes, more or less\r\navailable by treaty to the Company, the total swells to 700,000 men.\r\n\r\nAs exhibiting in detail the component elements of the Company’s\r\nAnglo-Indian army at a definite period, the following enumeration by\r\nCaptain Rafter may be adopted, as applicable to the early part of 1855.\r\nCertain minor changes were made in the two years from that date to the\r\ncommencement of the outbreak; but these will be noticed in later pages\r\nwhen necessary, and do not affect the general accuracy of the list. The\r\nthree presidencies are kept separate, and the three kinds of\r\ntroops—regiments of the royal army, the Company’s native regular\r\nregiments, and native irregular regiments—are also kept separate.\r\n\r\nFirst we take the Bengal presidency in all its completeness, stretching\r\nalmost entirely across Northern India from the Burmese frontier on the\r\neast, to the Afghan frontier on the west:\r\n\r\n                           BENGAL PRESIDENCY.\r\n\r\n                           _Queen’s Troops._\r\n\r\n  Two regiments of light cavalry.\r\n  Fifteen regiments of infantry.\r\n  One battalion of 60th Rifles.\r\n\r\n                      _Company’s Regular Troops._\r\n\r\n  Three brigades of horse-artillery, European and native.\r\n  Six battalions of European foot-artillery.\r\n  Three battalions of native foot-artillery.\r\n  Corps of Royal Engineers.\r\n  Ten regiments of native light cavalry.\r\n  Two regiments of European fusiliers.\r\n  Seventy-four regiments of native infantry.\r\n  One regiment of Sappers and Miners.\r\n\r\n                   _Irregular and Contingent Troops._\r\n\r\n  Twenty-three regiments of irregular native cavalry.\r\n  Twelve regiments of irregular native infantry.\r\n  One corps of Guides.\r\n  One regiment of camel corps.\r\n  Sixteen regiments of local militia.\r\n  Shekhawuttie brigade.\r\n  Contingents of Gwalior, Jhodpore, Malwah, Bhopal, and Kotah.\r\n\r\nThe European troops here mentioned, in the Company’s regular army, are\r\nthose who have been enlisted in England or elsewhere by the Company’s\r\nagents, quite irrespective of the royal or Queen’s army. The above\r\nforces, altogether, amounted to somewhat over 150,000 men. Let us now\r\nglance at another presidency:\r\n\r\n                           MADRAS PRESIDENCY.\r\n\r\n                           _Queen’s Troops._\r\n\r\n  One regiment of light cavalry.\r\n  Five regiments of infantry.\r\n\r\n                      _Company’s Regular Troops._\r\n\r\n  One brigade of horse-artillery, European and native.\r\n  Four battalions of European foot-artillery.\r\n  One battalion of native foot-artillery.\r\n  Corps of Royal Engineers.\r\n  Eight regiments of native light cavalry.\r\n  Two regiments of European infantry.\r\n  Fifty-two regiments of native infantry.\r\n\r\nNo irregular or contingent troops appear in this entry.\r\n\r\n                           BOMBAY PRESIDENCY.\r\n\r\n                           _Queen’s Troops._\r\n\r\n  One regiment of light cavalry.\r\n  Five regiments of infantry.\r\n\r\n                      _Company’s Regular Troops._\r\n\r\n  One brigade of horse-artillery, European and native.\r\n  Two battalions of European foot-artillery.\r\n  Two battalions of native foot-artillery.\r\n  Corps of Royal Engineers.\r\n  Three regiments of native light cavalry.\r\n  Two regiments of European infantry.\r\n  Twenty-nine regiments of native infantry.\r\n\r\n                   _Irregular and Contingent Troops._\r\n\r\n  Fifteen regiments of irregular native troops.\r\n\r\nThe European and the native troops of the Company are not here\r\nseparated, although in effect they form distinct regiments. So costly\r\nare all the operations connected with the Anglo-Indian army, that it\r\nhas been calculated that every English soldier employed in the East,\r\nwhether belonging to the Queen’s or to the Company’s forces, costs, on\r\nan average, one hundred pounds before he becomes available for\r\nservice, including his outfit, his voyage, his marching and barracking\r\nin India. This of course relates to the privates; an officer’s cost is\r\nbased upon wholly distinct grounds, and can with difficulty be\r\nestimated. The greatly increased expenditure of the Company on\r\nmilitary matters has partly depended on the fact that the European\r\nelement in the armies has been regularly augmenting: in 1837 there\r\nwere 28,000 European troops in India; in 1850 the number was 44,000,\r\ncomprising 28,000 Queen’s troops, and 16,000 belonging to the Company;\r\nwhile the new charter of 1854 allowed the Company to raise 24,000, of\r\nwhom 4000 were to be in training in England, and the rest on service\r\nin India. What was the number in 1857, becomes part of the history of\r\nthe mutiny. In the whole Indian army, a year or two before this\r\ncatastrophe, there were about 5000 European officers, governing the\r\nnative as well as the European regiments; but of this number, so many\r\nwere absent on furlough or leave, so many more on staff appointments,\r\nand so many of the remainder in local corps and on civil duties, that\r\nthere was an insufficiency of regimental control—leading, as some\r\nauthorities think, in great part to the scenes of insubordination; for\r\nthe native officers, as we shall presently see, were regarded in a\r\nvery subordinate light. There was a commander-in-chief for each of the\r\nthree presidencies, controlling the three armies respectively; while\r\none of the three, the commander-in-chief of the Bengal army, held at\r\nthe same time the office of commander-in-chief of the whole of the\r\narmies of India, in order that there might be a unity of plan and\r\npurpose in any large combined operations. Thus, when Sir Colin\r\nCampbell went out to India in the summer of 1857, his power was to be\r\nexerted over the armies of the whole of India generally, as well as\r\nover that of Bengal in particular.\r\n\r\nContinuing to speak of the Indian army as it was before the year 1857,\r\nand thereby keeping clear of the changes effected or commenced in that\r\nyear, we proceed to mention a few more circumstances connected with the\r\nCompany’s European element in that army. The formation of an Indian\r\nofficer commenced in England. As a youth, from fourteen to eighteen\r\nyears of age, he was admitted to the Company’s school at Addiscombe,\r\nafter an ordeal of recommendations and testimonials, and after an\r\nexamination of his proficiency in an ordinary English education, in\r\nwhich a modicum of Latin was also expected. A probation of six months\r\nwas gone through, to shew whether he possessed the requisite abilities\r\nand inclination; and if this probation were satisfactory, his studies\r\nwere continued for two years. His friends paid the larger portion of the\r\ncost of his maintenance and education at the school. If his abilities\r\nand progress were of a high class, he was set apart for an appointment\r\nin the engineers; if next in degree, in the artillery; and if the lowest\r\nin degree, for the infantry. At the end of his term the pupil must have\r\nattained to a certain amount of knowledge, of which, however, very\r\nlittle was professional. Supposing all to be satisfactory, he became a\r\nmilitary _cadet_ in the service of the Company, to be available for\r\nIndian service as occasion arose. Having joined one of the regiments as\r\nthe lowest commissioned officer, his subsequent advancement depended in\r\npart on his qualifications and in part on seniority. He could not, by\r\nthe more recent regulations of the Company, become a captain until he\r\nhad acquired, besides his professional efficiency, a knowledge of the\r\nspoken and written Hindustani language, and of the Persian written\r\ncharacter, much used in India. When placed on the general staff, his\r\nservices might be required in any one of a number of ways quite unknown\r\nin the Queen’s service in England: he might have a civil duty, or be\r\nplaced at the head of the police in a tract of country recently\r\nevacuated by the military, or be made an adjutant, auditor,\r\nquartermaster, surveyor, paymaster, judge-advocate, commissary-general,\r\nbrigade-major, aid-de-camp, barrack-master, or clothing agent. Many of\r\nthese offices being lucrative, the military liked them; but such a\r\nbestowal created some jealousy among the civil servants of the Company,\r\nwhose prizes in the Indian lottery were thereby diminished; and, what\r\nwas worse, it shook the connection between an officer and his regiment,\r\nrendering him neither able nor willing to throw his sympathies into his\r\nwork. No officer could hold any of these staff appointments, as they\r\nwere called, until he had been two years in the army.\r\n\r\nThe officers noticed in the last paragraph were appointed to the command\r\nboth of European and of native regiments. As to privates and\r\nnon-commissioned officers in the European regiments, they were much the\r\nsame class of men, and enlisted much in the same way, as those in the\r\nQueen’s army. The privates or sepoys of the native regiments were of\r\ncourse different, not only from Europeans, but different among\r\nthemselves. Four-fifths of the Bengal native infantry were Hindoos,\r\nmainly of the Brahmin and Rajpoot castes; and the remainder Mohammedans.\r\nOn the other hand, three-fourths of the Bengal native cavalry were\r\nMohammedans, the Hindoos being generally not equal to them as troopers.\r\nIn the Madras native army, the Mohammedans predominated in the cavalry,\r\nwhile the infantry comprised the two religions in nearly equal\r\nproportions. In Bombay, nearer the nations of Western Asia, the troops\r\ncomprised volunteers of many countries and many religions—more easily\r\nmanaged, our officers found, on that account.\r\n\r\nWithout at present going into the question how far the religious\r\nfeelings and caste prejudices of the natives induced a revolt, it may be\r\nuseful to shew how a regiment was constituted, of what materials, and in\r\nwhat gradations. An infantry regiment in the Bengal presidency will\r\nserve as a type.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of a Bengal native regiment, before the mutiny, was\r\nnearly as follows: An infantry regiment consisted of about 1000\r\nprivates, 120 non-commissioned officers, and 20 native commissioned\r\nofficers. It was divided into ten companies, each containing one-tenth\r\nof the above numbers. When stationary, the regiment seldom had barracks,\r\nbut was quartered in ten lines of thatched huts, one row for each\r\ncompany. In front of each row was a small circular building for\r\ncontaining the arms and accoutrements of that particular company, under\r\nthe charge of a _havildar_ or native sergeant. All these natives rose by\r\na strict rule of seniority: the sepoy or private soldier becoming a\r\n_naik_ or corporal, the naik being promoted to be _havildar_ or\r\nsergeant, the havildar in time assuming the rank of _jemadar_ or\r\nlieutenant, and the jemadar becoming a _subadar_ or captain. All these\r\npromotions were necessarily slow; for the English colonel of the\r\nregiment had very little power to promote a worthy native officer or\r\nnon-commissioned officer to a higher rank. The jemadar often became a\r\ngray-headed man of sixty before he rose to the rank of subadar, the\r\nhighest attainable by a native. As a rule, there were four or five\r\nHindoos to one Mohammedan in a Bengal infantry regiment; and of these\r\neight hundred Hindoos, it was not unfrequent to find four hundred\r\nBrahmins or hereditary priests, and two hundred Rajpoots, a military\r\ncaste only a little lower in rank than the former; while the remaining\r\ntwo hundred were low-caste Hindoos. The European officers, as will be\r\nexplained more fully further on, lived in bungalows or detached houses\r\nnear the lines of their regiment; but as the weather is too hot to admit\r\nof much open-air duty in the daytime, these officers saw less of their\r\nmen than is customary in European armies, or than is necessary for the\r\ndue preservation of discipline. The head of a regiment was the\r\ncommander, generally a lieutenant-colonel; below him was an adjutant,\r\nwho attended to the drill and the daily reports; below him was a\r\nquartermaster and interpreter, whose double duties were to look after\r\nthe clothes and huts of the men, and to interpret or translate orders.\r\nBesides these three, there were ten subordinate officers for the ten\r\ncompanies, each expected to make a morning scrutiny into the condition\r\nand conduct of his men. The Europeans in a native regiment were thus\r\nfourteen or fifteen. It is true that the _theory_ of a regiment involved\r\na complement of about five-and-twenty European officers; but the causes\r\nof absenteeism, lately adverted to, generally brought down the effective\r\nnumber to about twelve or fifteen. The arrangements of the infantry in\r\nthe other presidencies, and of the native cavalry all over India, each\r\nhad their peculiarities.\r\n\r\nLeaving for future chapters a further elucidation of the relations\r\nbetween the European officers and the native troops—so important in\r\nconnection with the Revolt—and a description of the sepoys in their\r\ndresses, usages, and personal characteristics—we shall now proceed to\r\nview the native army under two different aspects—first, when barracked\r\nand cantoned in time of peace; and, secondly, when on the march towards\r\na scene of war.\r\n\r\nAnd first, for the army when stationary. At Calcutta, Bombay, and\r\nMadras, there are solidly built barracks for the whole of the soldiery,\r\nmen as well as officers; but in almost all other parts of India the\r\narrangements are of a slighter and less permanent character. At the\r\ncantonments, it is true, the officers have houses; but the sepoys are\r\nlodged in huts of their own construction. Around the cantonments at the\r\nstations, and generally skirting the parade-grounds, are the houses or\r\nbungalows of the officers. Within the lines of the cantonment, too, the\r\nofficers’ mess-rooms are situated; and at the larger stations may be\r\nseen ball-rooms, theatres, and racket-courts; while outside is a\r\nrace-stand for witnessing the sports which Englishmen love in India as\r\nwell as at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Group of Sepoys.\r\n\r\n  1. Subadar—major. 2. Jemadar—Lieutenant. 3. Subadar—Captain. 4.\r\n    Naik—Corporal. 5. Havildar—Sergeant. 6. Sepoy—Private.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Indian bungalows, the houses inhabited by European officers at the\r\ndifferent towns and stations in India, have a certain general\r\nresemblance, although differing of course much in details. A bungalow of\r\ngood size has usually a central room called the hall, a smaller room\r\nopening on the front verandah, a similar one opening on the back\r\nverandah, three narrower rooms on each side of these three, and\r\nbathing-rooms at the four corners. A verandah runs entirely round the\r\nexterior. The central hall has only the borrowed light derived from\r\neight or a dozen doors leading out of the surrounding apartments: these\r\ndoors are always open; but the doorways are covered, when privacy is\r\ndesired, with the _chick_, a sort of gauze-work of green-painted strips\r\nof fine bamboo, admitting air and light, but keeping out flies and\r\nmosquitoes. The floors are usually of _chunam_, finely tempered clay,\r\ncovered with matting, and then with a sort of blue-striped carpet or\r\nwith printed calico. The exterior is usually barn-like and ugly, with\r\nits huge roof, tiled or thatched, sloping down to the pillars of the\r\nverandah. Air and shade are the two desiderata in every bungalow, and\r\nadornment is wisely sacrificed to these. The finest part of the whole is\r\nthe surrounding space or garden, called the _compound_, from a\r\nPortuguese word. The larger the space allowed for this compound, the\r\nmore pleasant is the residence in its centre, and the more agreeable to\r\nthe eye is a cantonment of such bungalows. The trees and fruits in these\r\nenclosures are delicious to the sight, and most welcome to the\r\nheat-wearied occupants of the dwellings. Officers in the Company’s\r\nservice, whether military or civil, live much under canvas during the\r\nhot seasons, at some of the stations; and the tents they use are much\r\nlarger and more like regular habitations than those known in Europe. The\r\ntents are double, having a space of half a yard or so between the two\r\ncanvas walls, to temper the heat of the sun. The double-poled tents are\r\nlarge enough to contain several apartments, and are furnished with\r\nglass-doors to fit into the openings. A wall of canvas separates the\r\nouter offices and bathing-rooms. Gay chintz for wall-linings, and\r\nprinted cotton carpets, give a degree of smartness to the interior.\r\nMovable stoves, or else fire-dishes for wood-fuel called _chillumchees_,\r\nare provided as a resource against the chill that often pervades the air\r\nin the evening of a hot day. The tents for the common soldiers hold ten\r\nmen each with great ease, and have a double canvas wall like the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Bungalow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn important part of every cantonment is the bazaar, situated in\r\nconvenient proximity to the huts or tents of the troops. It comprises an\r\nenormous number of sutlers, who sell to the soldiers those commodities\r\nwhich cannot well be dispensed with, but which cannot conveniently be\r\nprovided and carried about by them. Curry stuffs, tobacco, rice, arrack\r\n(in addition to the Company’s allowance), cotton cloth, and a\r\nmultiplicity of other articles, are sold at these bazaars; and the\r\nmarket-people who supply these things, with their families, the coolies\r\nor porters, and their hackeries or carts—add enormously to the mass that\r\nconstitutes an Indian cantonment. The sepoy has little to spend with his\r\nsixpence a day; but then his wants are few; and his copper _pice_,\r\nsomewhat larger than the English farthing, will buy an amount of\r\nnecessaries little dreamed of in England. The Hindoos have such peculiar\r\nnotions connected with food and cooking, that the government leave them\r\nas much to themselves as possible in those matters; and the bazaar and\r\nsutlers’ arrangements assume a particular importance from this\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nAn Anglo-Indian army we have seen at rest, in cantonments. Now let us\r\ntrace it when on a march to a scene of war; but while describing this in\r\nthe _present_ tense, we must make allowance for the changes which the\r\nRevolt has inevitably produced.\r\n\r\nThe non-fighting men who accompany the troops greatly exceed in number\r\nthe troops themselves. Captain Munro says: ‘It would be absurd for a\r\ncaptain to think of taking the field without being attended by the\r\nfollowing enormous retinue—namely, a _dubash_ (agent or commissionaire),\r\na cook, and a _maty_ boy (servant-of-all-work); if he cannot get\r\nbullocks, he must assemble fifteen or twenty _coolies_ to carry his\r\nbaggage, together with a horse-keeper and grass-cutter, and sometimes a\r\ndulcinea and her train, having occasionally the assistance of a barber,\r\na washer, and an ironer, in common with the other officers of his\r\nregiment. His tent is furnished with a good large bed, mattress,\r\npillows, &c., a few camp stools or chairs, a folding table, a pair of\r\nglass shades for his candles, six or seven trunks, with table equipage,\r\nhis stock of linens (at least twenty-four suits), some dozens of wine,\r\nporter, brandy, and gin; with tea, sugar, and biscuit, a hamper of live\r\npoultry, and his milch-goat. A private’s tent for holding his servants\r\nand the overplus of his baggage is also requisite; but this is not at\r\nthe Company’s expense.’ Of course it must be inferred that all this\r\nluxury belongs to the best of times only, and is not available in the\r\nexigency of sudden military movements. The sepoys or common soldiers,\r\ntoo, have their satellites. Each man is accompanied by his whole family,\r\nwho live upon his pay and allowances of rice from the Company. Every\r\ntrooper or horse-soldier, too, has his grass-cutter; for it is a day’s\r\nwork for one person to dig, cut, and prepare a day’s grass for one\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nWhen on the march, the tents are generally struck soon after midnight.\r\nAt the first tap of the drum, the servants knock up the tent-pins, and\r\ndown fall the tents; horses begin to neigh and the camels to cry, the\r\nelephants and camels receive their loads of camp-equipage, the bullocks\r\nare laden with the officers’ tents and boxes, the coolies take up their\r\nburdens, and all prepare for the road. During the noise and bustle of\r\nthese preliminaries, the officers and men make their few personal\r\narrangements, aided by their servants or families; while the officers’\r\ncooks and agents are sent on in advance, to prepare breakfast at the\r\nnext halting-place. Between one and two o’clock the regiments start off,\r\nin columns of sections: the camp-followers, baggage, bullocks,\r\nelephants, and camels, bringing up the rear. The European soldiers do\r\nnot carry their own knapsacks on the march; they have the luxury of\r\ncook-boys or attendants, who render this service for them. The natives,\r\nit is found, are able to carry heavier loads than the Europeans; or—what\r\nis perhaps more nearly the case—they bear the burdens more patiently, as\r\nthe Europeans love soldiering better than portering. The tedium of the\r\njourney is sometimes relieved by a hunt after antelopes, hares,\r\npartridges, wild ducks, or wild boars, which the officers may happen to\r\nespy, according to the nature of the country through which they are\r\npassing. Arrived at the halting-place, everything is quickly prepared\r\nfor a rest and a breakfast; the quarter-masters push forward to occupy\r\nthe ground; the elephants and camels are disburdened of the tents; the\r\nnatives and the cattle plunge into some neighbouring pool or tank to\r\nrefresh themselves; the cooks have been already some time at work; and\r\nthe officers sit down to a breakfast of tea, coffee, curry, rice,\r\npillau, ham, and other obtainable dishes. The fakeers often recognise\r\ntheir friends or admirers among the natives of the cavalcade, and give\r\nloud blessings, and tom-tom drummings, in exchange for donations of the\r\nsmallest Indian coins. The quarter-masters’ arrangements are so quickly\r\nand so neatly made, that in a short time the general’s _durbar_ appears\r\nin the centre of a street of tents for staff-officers, dining-tents on\r\nthe one side and sleeping-tents on the other; while the bazaar-dealers\r\nopen their temporary shops in the rear. The horses are picketed in long\r\nlines; while the elephants and camels browse or rest at leisure. Under\r\nordinary circumstances, the day’s marching is over by nine o’clock in\r\nthe morning, at which hour the sun’s heat becomes too fierce to be\r\nwillingly borne. Repose, amusements, and light camp-duties fill up the\r\nremainder of the day, to be followed by a like routine on the morrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Troops on the March.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile one of these extraordinary marches is in progress, ‘when the\r\nmoving masses are touched here and there by the reddening light of the\r\ndawn, it seems to be a true migration, with flocks and herds, cattle\r\nloaded with baggage, men, women, and children, all in a chaos of\r\ndisorder but the troops whose wants and wishes have attracted this\r\nassemblage. At length the country appears to awake from its sleep, and\r\nwith the yell of the jackal, or the distant baying of the village dogs,\r\nare heard to mingle the voices of human beings. Ruddier grows the dawn,\r\nwarmer the breeze, and the light-hearted sepoy, no longer shivering with\r\ncold, gives vent to the joyous feelings of morning in songs and\r\nlaughter. The scenes become more striking, and the long array of tall\r\ncamels, led by natives in picturesque costume, with here and there a\r\ntaller elephant mingling with droves of loaded bullocks, give it a new\r\nand extraordinary character to a European imagination. The line of\r\nswarthy sepoys of Upper India, with their moustached lips and tall\r\nhandsome figures, contrasts favourably with the shorter and plainer\r\nsoldiers of Britain; the grave mechanical movements of the regular\r\ncavalry in their light-blue uniforms are relieved by the erratic\r\nevolutions and gay and glittering dresses of the irregulars, who with\r\nloud cries and quivering spears, and their long black locks streaming\r\nbehind them, spur backwards and forwards like the wind from mere\r\nexuberance of spirits.... The camp-followers in the meantime present\r\nevery possible variety of costume; and among them, and not the least\r\ninteresting figures in the various groups, may frequently be seen the\r\npet lambs of which the sepoys are so fond, dressed in necklaces of\r\nribbons and white shells, and the tip of their tails, ears, and feet\r\ndyed orange colour. The womenkind of the troops of the Peninsula\r\n(Southern India) usually follow the drum; but the Bengalees have left\r\ntheir families at home; and the Europeans bidden adieu to their\r\ntemporary wives with the air the band strikes up on quitting the\r\nstation, “The girl I left behind me.’”[5]\r\n\r\nSuch, before the great Revolt, were the usual characteristics of an\r\nAnglo-Indian army when on the march; and, considering the _impedimenta_,\r\nit is not surprising that the daily progress seldom exceeded ten or\r\ntwelve miles. The system was very costly, even at the cheap rate of\r\nIndian service; for the camp-followers, one with another, were ten times\r\nas numerous as the troops; and all, in one way or other, lived upon or\r\nby the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  A parliamentary paper, issued in 1857 on the motion of Colonel\r\n  Sykes, affords valuable information on some of the matters treated\r\n  in this chapter. It is ‘A Return of the Area and Population of each\r\n  Division of each Presidency of India, from the Latest Inquiries;\r\n  comprising, also, the Area and Estimated Population of Native\r\n  States.’ It separates the British states from the native; and it\r\n  further separates the former into five groups, according to the\r\n  government under which each is placed. These five, as indicated in\r\n  the present chapter, are under the administration of ‘the\r\n  governor-general of India in council’—the ‘lieutenant-governor of\r\n  Bengal’—the ‘lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces’—the\r\n  ‘government of Madras’—and the ‘government of Bombay.’ In each case\r\n  the ‘regulation districts’ are treated distinct from the\r\n  non-regulation provinces,’ the former having been longer under\r\n  British power, and brought into a more regular system than the\r\n  latter. Without going again over the long list of names of places,\r\n  it will suffice to quote those belonging to the group placed\r\n  immediately under the governor-general’s control. This group\r\n  comprises the Punjaub, in the six divisions of Lahore, Jelum,\r\n  Moultan, Leia, Peshawur, and Jullundur; the Cis-Sutlej states, four\r\n  in number; the lately annexed kingdom of Oude; the central district\r\n  of Nagpoor or Berar; the recently acquired region of Pegu; the strip\r\n  of country on the east of the Bay of Bengal, known as the Tenasserim\r\n  Provinces; and the ‘Eastern Straits Settlements’ of Singapore,\r\n  Penang, and Malacca. The whole of British India is divided into\r\n  nearly a hundred and eighty districts, each, on an average, about\r\n  the size of Inverness-shire, the largest county, except Yorkshire,\r\n  in the United Kingdom. The population, however, is eight times us\r\n  dense, per average square mile, as in this Scottish shire. Keeping\r\n  clear of details concerning divisions and districts, the following\r\n  are the areas and population in the five great governments:\r\n\r\n                                              AREA.

Thus, in the Punjaub member of the\r\n  governor-general’s group, Hindoos are separated from non-Hindoos;\r\n  then, each of these classes is divided into agricultural and\r\n  non-agricultural; and, lastly, each of these is further separated\r\n  into male and female. The most instructive feature here is the\r\n  scarcity of females compared with males, contrary to the experience\r\n  of Europe; in the Punjaub and Sirhind, among thirteen million souls,\r\n  there are a million and a half more males than females—shewing,\r\n  among other things, one of the effects of female infanticide in past\r\n  years. The ratio appears to be about the same in the Northwest\r\n  Provinces, around Delhi, Meerut, Rohilcund, Agra, Benares, and\r\n  Allahabad. Not one place is named, throughout India, in which the\r\n  females equal the males in number. In the Bombay presidency, besides\r\n  the difference of sex, the population is tabulated into nine\r\n  groups—Hindoos, Wild Tribes, Low Castes, Shrawniks or Jains,\r\n  Lingayets, Mussulmans, Parsees, Jews, Christians. Of the last named\r\n  there are less than fifty thousand, including military, in a\r\n  population of twelve millions.\r\n\r\n  The area and population of the native states are given in connection\r\n  with the presidencies to which those states are geographically and\r\n  politically related, and present the following numbers:\r\n\r\n                                      AREA.

Of these inhabitants, it is\r\n  believed—though the returns are not complete in this particular—that\r\n  there are fifteen Hindoos to one Mohammedan: if so, then India must\r\n  contain more than a _hundred and sixty million_ worshippers of\r\n  Hindoo deities—even after allowance is made for Buddhists, Parsees,\r\n  and a few savage tribes almost without religion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  A young native princess was sent to England from this district to be\r\n  educated as a _Christian_ lady; and Queen Victoria became a sponsor\r\n  for her at a baptismal ceremony.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  _Our Anglo-Indian Army._\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Leitch Ritchie. _British World in the East._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                  SYMPTOMS:—CHUPATTIES AND CARTRIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did the British authorities in India suspect, in the early weeks\r\nof 1857, that a mighty CENTENARY was about to be observed—a movement\r\nintended to mark the completion of one hundred years of British rule in\r\nthe East; and to mark it, not by festivities and congratulations, but by\r\nrebellion and slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe officers in India remembered and noted the date well; but they did\r\nnot know how well the Mohammedans and Hindoos, the former especially,\r\nhad stored it up in their traditions. The name of Robert Clive, the\r\n‘Daring in War,’ was so intimately associated with the date 1757, that\r\nthe year 1857 naturally brought it into thought, as a time when\r\nChristian rule began to overawe Moslem rule in that vast country. True,\r\nthe East India Company had been connected with India during a period\r\nexceeding two hundred years; but it was only at the commencement of the\r\nsecond half of the last century that this connection became politically\r\nimportant. It was remembered that—1756 having been marked by the\r\natrocities of the Black Hole at Calcutta, and by the utter extinction\r\nfor a time of the East India Company’s power in Bengal—the year 1757\r\nbecame a year of retribution. It was remembered, as a matter of history\r\namong the British, and of tradition among the natives, how wonderful a\r\npart the young officer Clive performed in that exciting drama. It was\r\nremembered that he arrived at Calcutta, at that time wholly denuded of\r\nEnglishmen, on the 2d of January in the last-named year, bringing with\r\nhim a small body of troops from Madras; that on the 4th of February,\r\nwith two thousand men, he defeated an army ten times as large, belonging\r\nto Suraj-u-Dowlah, Nawab of Bengal—the same who had caused the\r\natrocities at the Black Hole, when a hundred and thirty persons died\r\nfrom suffocation in a room only fitted to contain a fourth of the\r\nnumber. It was further remembered how that, on the 9th of February,\r\nClive obtained great concessions from the nawab by treaty; that Suraj\r\nbroke the treaty, and commenced a course of treachery, in which Clive\r\nwas not slow to imitate him; that on the 13th of June, Clive, having\r\nmatured a plan equally bold and crafty, declared renewed hostilities\r\nagainst the nawab; that on the 23d he gained the brilliant battle of\r\nPLASSEY, conquering sixty thousand men with a force of only three\r\nthousand; that within a week, Suraj-u-Dowlah, a miserable fugitive,\r\nended his existence; and that from that day British power had ever been\r\nsupreme in Bengal. This was a series of achievements not likely to be\r\nforgotten by Englishmen. Ere yet the news of mutiny and murder reached\r\nEurope, steps had been taken to render homage to Clive on the hundredth\r\nanniversary of the battle of Plassey; the East India Company had\r\nsubscribed largely towards a statue of the hero; and a meeting in London\r\nhad decided that the chief town in Clive’s native county of Shropshire\r\nshould be selected as the spot wherein the statue should be set up.\r\n\r\nJudging from the experience afforded by recent events, it is now clear\r\nthat the Mohammedans in India had thought much of these things, and\r\nthat the year 1857 had been marked out by them as a centenary to be\r\nobserved in a special way—by no less an achievement, indeed, than the\r\nexpulsion of the British, and the revival of Moslem power. In the\r\nspring of the year it was ascertained that a paper was in circulation\r\namong the natives, purporting to be a prophecy made by a Punjaub\r\nfakeer seven hundred years ago—to the effect that, after various\r\ndynasties of Mohammedans had ruled for some centuries, the _Nazarenes_\r\nor Christians should hold power in India for one hundred years; that\r\nthe Christians would then be expelled; and that various events\r\nforetold in the Koran would then come to pass, connected with the\r\ntriumph of Islamism. That this mysterious prediction was widely\r\ncredited, is probable—notwithstanding that the paper itself, if really\r\ncirculated, must manifestly have been an imposture of recent date; for\r\nthe English nation was not known even by name to the natives of India\r\nseven hundred years ago. Setting aside, at present, all inquiries\r\nconcerning the first authors of the plot, the degree to which the\r\nCompany’s annexations had provoked it, the existence of any grievances\r\njustifiably to be resisted, the reasons which induced Hindoos to join\r\nthe Mohammedans against the British, or the extent to which the\r\ngeneral population shared the views of the native military—laying\r\naside these inquiries for the present, there is evidence that a great\r\nmovement was planned for the middle of the year 1857. Of this plan the\r\nBritish government knew nothing, and suspected little.\r\n\r\nBut although no vast plot was suspected, several trifling symptoms had\r\ngiven cause for uneasiness and the English public learned, when too\r\nlate, that many Indian officers had long predicted the imminency of some\r\noutbreak. Insubordination and mutiny, it was found, are not faults of\r\nrecent growth among the native troops of India. Now that the startling\r\nevents of 1857 are vividly presented to the public mind, men begin to\r\nread again the old story of the outbreak at Vellore, and seek to draw\r\ninstruction therefrom. A little more than half a century ago—namely, on\r\nthe 10th of July 1806—the European barracks at Vellore were thrown into\r\na state of great excitement. This town is in the Carnatic, a few miles\r\nwest of Madras, and in the presidency of the same name. At two o’clock\r\nin the morning, the barracks, containing four companies of the 69th\r\nregiment, were surrounded by two battalions of sepoys in the Company’s\r\nservice, who poured in a heavy fire of musketry, at every door and\r\nwindow, upon the soldiers. At the same time the European sentries, the\r\nsoldiers at the mainguard, and the sick in the hospital, were put to\r\ndeath. The officers’ houses were ransacked, and everybody found in them\r\nmurdered. Upon the arrival of the 19th Light Dragoons, under Colonel\r\nGillespie, the sepoys were immediately attacked; six hundred were cut\r\ndown upon the spot, and two hundred taken from their hiding-places to be\r\nshot. There perished of the four European companies, a hundred and\r\nsixty-four, besides officers; and many British officers of the native\r\ntroops were also murdered. Nothing ever came to light concerning the\r\nprobable cause of the outrage, but this—that an attempt had been made by\r\nthe military men at Madras to _change the shape of the sepoy turban_\r\ninto something resembling the helmet of the light infantry of Europe,\r\nwhich would prevent the native troops from wearing on their foreheads\r\nthe marks characteristic of their several castes. The sons of Tippoo\r\nSaib, the deposed ruler of Mysore, together with many distinguished\r\nMohammedans deprived of office, were at that time in Vellore; and the\r\nsupposition is, that these men contributed very materially to excite or\r\ninflame the suspicions of the Hindoos, concerning an endeavour to tamper\r\nwith their religious usages. There was another mutiny some time\r\nafterwards at Nundeydroog, in the same presidency; and it was found\r\nindispensable to disarm four hundred and fifty Mohammedan sepoys, who\r\nhad planned a massacre. At Bangalore and other places a similar spirit\r\nwas exhibited. The governor of Madras deemed it necessary, in very\r\nearnest terms, to disclaim any intention of tampering with the native\r\nreligion. In a proclamation issued on the 3d of December, he said: ‘The\r\nright honourable the governor in council having observed that, in some\r\nlate instances, an extraordinary degree of agitation has prevailed among\r\nseveral corps of the native army of this coast, it has been his\r\nlordship’s particular endeavour to ascertain the motives which may have\r\nled to conduct so different from that which formerly distinguished the\r\nnative army. From this inquiry, it has appeared that many persons of\r\nevil intention have endeavoured, for malicious purposes, to impress upon\r\nthe native troops a belief that it is the wish of the British government\r\nto convert them by forcible means to Christianity; and his lordship in\r\ncouncil has observed with concern that such malicious reports have been\r\nbelieved by many of the native troops. The right honourable the governor\r\nin council, therefore, deems it proper, in this public manner, to repeat\r\nto the native troops his assurance, that the same respect which has been\r\ninvariably shewn by the British government for their religion and their\r\ncustoms, will be always continued; and that no interruption will be\r\ngiven to any native, whether Hindoo or Mussulman, in the practice of his\r\nreligious ceremonies.’ Notwithstanding the distinctness of this\r\nassurance, and notwithstanding the extensive promulgation of the\r\nproclamation in the Tamul, Telinga, and Hindustani languages—the ferment\r\ncontinued a considerable time. Even in March 1807, when some months had\r\nelapsed, so universal was the dread of a general revolt among the native\r\ntroops, that the British officers attached to the Madras army constantly\r\nslept with loaded pistols under their pillows.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between 1806 and 1857, nothing so murderous occurred;\r\nbut, among the Bengal troops, many proofs of insubordination were\r\nafforded; for it repeatedly occurred that grievances, real or pretended,\r\nled to combinations among the men of different regiments. In 1835, Lord\r\nWilliam Bentinck, acting on a principle which had often been advocated\r\nin England, abolished flogging in the Indian army; this appears to have\r\nraised the self-pride rather than conciliated the good-will of the\r\ntroops: insubordination ensued, and several regiments had to be\r\ndisbanded. Again, in 1844, when several Bengal regiments were ordered to\r\nmarch to Sinde, the 34th native infantry refused; whereupon Lord\r\nEllenborough, at that time governor-general, ignominiously disbanded the\r\nregiment in presence of the rest of the army. Again, in 1849, Sir Colin\r\nCampbell, serving under Sir Charles Napier, reported that the 22d Bengal\r\nregiment had mutinied on a question of pay, in which they were clearly\r\nin the wrong; but as the Punjaub was at that time in a critical state,\r\nSir Charles did that which was very opposite to his general character—he\r\nyielded to an unjust demand, as a measure of prudence. It may have been\r\nthat the sepoys counted on this probability when they mutinied. No less\r\nthan forty-two regiments were ascertained to be in secret correspondence\r\non this matter, under Brahminical influence—one of whom went so far as\r\nto threaten the commanding officer that they could stop enlistment if\r\nthey chose. In 1850, Napier was compelled to disband the 66th regiment,\r\nfor mutiny at Peshawur. In 1852, the 38th regiment was ordered to\r\nproceed to Burmah; the men objected to the sea-voyage, and refused to\r\ndepart; and the authorities in this case gave way.\r\n\r\nLike as, in the ordinary affairs of life, men compare notes after a\r\ndisaster, to ascertain whether any misgiving had silently occupied their\r\nminds concerning causes and symptoms; so did many military officers,\r\nobserving that the troubles were all or mostly in Bengal, or where\r\nBengal troops operated, come forward to state that they had long been\r\ncognizant of a marked difference between the Bengal army on the one\r\nhand, and the Bombay and Madras armies on the other. Lord Melville, who,\r\nas General Dundas, had held a command during the Punjaub campaign,\r\nexpressed himself very strongly in the House of Lords shortly after news\r\nof the mutiny arrived. He stated that, in the Bengal army, the native\r\nofficers were in nearly all cases selected by seniority, and not from\r\nmerit; that they could not rise from the ranks till old age was creeping\r\non them; and that a sort of hopelessness of advancement cankered in the\r\nminds of many sepoys in the middle time of life. In the Bombay and\r\nMadras armies, on the contrary, the havildars or sergeants were selected\r\nfor their intelligence and activity, and were recommended for promotion\r\nby the commanding officers of the regiments. It might possibly be a\r\ntheory unsusceptible of proof, that this difference made the one army\r\nmutinous and the other two loyal; but Lord Melville proceeded to assert\r\nthat the Bengal troops were notoriously less fully organised and\r\ndisciplined, more prone to insubordination, than the troops of the other\r\ntwo presidencies. He stated as an instance, that when he commanded the\r\nBombay army in the Punjaub frontier in 1849, the Bengal regiments were\r\nmutinous; while the Bombay troops remained in soldierly subordination.\r\nIndeed these latter, which he commanded in person, were credited by his\r\nlordship with having exhibited the highest qualities of brave and\r\nfaithful troops. He detailed an incident which had occurred at the siege\r\nof Moultan. A covering-party having been ordered into the trenches, some\r\ndisturbance soon afterwards arose; and an English officer found that\r\nmany soldiers of the Bengal army had been endeavouring to prevent the\r\nmen belonging to one of the Bombay regiments from digging in the\r\ntrenches in discharge of their duty, on the ground that the sepoys’ duty\r\n_was to fight and not to work_. Again: after the assault of Moultan, an\r\nofficer in command of one of the pickets was requested to post a\r\nsergeant and twelve men at one of the gates of the town; this was done;\r\nbut not long afterwards, three native officers of the Bengal engineers\r\nwere detected in an endeavour to pass the gate with stores which they\r\nwere about to plunder or appropriate. Although the views of Lord\r\nMelville were combated by a few other officers, there was a pretty\r\ngeneral concurrence of opinion that the Bengal native army, through some\r\ncircumstances known or unknown, had long been less obedient and orderly\r\nthan those of the other two presidencies.\r\n\r\nAs it is the purpose of the present chapter to treat rather of the facts\r\nthat preceded the horrors of Meerut and Cawnpore, than of the numerous\r\ntheories for explaining them, we shall not dwell long in this place on\r\nthe affairs of Oude, in connection with the Revolt; but so general is\r\nthe opinion that the annexation of that kingdom was one of the\r\npredisposing causes of the late calamities, that it may be right to\r\nglance slightly at the subject.\r\n\r\nOude—once a nawabship under the great Mogul, then a kingdom, and the\r\nlast remaining independent Mohammedan state in Northern India—was\r\nannexed in the early part of 1856; and although the governor-general\r\nsought to give a favourable account, both in its reasons and its\r\nresults, of that momentous measure, there are not wanting grounds for\r\nbelieving that it made a deep impression on the minds of the natives,\r\nunfavourable to the English—among the military, if not among the people\r\nat large. The deposed king, with his family and his prime-minister, came\r\nto live at Calcutta in April 1856; and in the following month his\r\nmother, his brother, and one of his sons, proceeded in great state to\r\nEngland, to protest before Queen Victoria against the conduct of the\r\ngovernor-general and of the East India Company, in having deprived them\r\nof their regal position: prepared to prove, as they everywhere\r\nannounced, that no justifiable grounds had existed for so harsh a step.\r\nWhether they sincerely believed this, or whether it was a blind to hide\r\nulterior objects, could not at that time be determined. It is one among\r\nmany opinions on the subject, that the courtiers around the deposed king\r\ngradually organised a plot against the British power; that the Queen of\r\nOude’s visit to England was merely intended to mask the proceedings\r\narising out of this plot; that the conspirators brought over to their\r\nviews the Mogul of Delhi, the shadowy representative of a once mighty\r\ndespot; that they then sought to win over the Hindoos to side with them;\r\nand that, in this proceeding, they adduced any and all facts that had\r\ncome to their knowledge, in which the British had unwittingly insulted\r\nthe religious prejudices of the worshippers of Brahma—craftily\r\ninsinuating that the insult was premeditated. The wisdom or justice of\r\nthe annexation policy we do not discuss in this place; there is a\r\nmultiplicity of interpretations concerning it—from that of absolute\r\nnecessity to that of glaring spoliation; but the point to be borne in\r\nmind is, that a new grievance was thereby added to others, real or\r\npretended, already existing. It is especially worthy of note, that any\r\ndistrust of England, arising out of annexation policy, was likely to be\r\nmore intense in Oude than anywhere else; for three-fourths of the\r\ninfantry in the Bengal army had been recruited from the inhabitants of\r\nthat state; they were energetic men, strongly attached to their native\r\ncountry; and when the change of masters took place, they lost certain of\r\nthe privileges they had before enjoyed. The Bengalees proper, the\r\nnatives of the thickly populated region around the lower course of the\r\nGanges, have little to do with the Bengal army; they are feeble,\r\nindolent, and cowardly, glad by any excuses to escape from fighting.\r\n\r\nLet us now—having said a few words concerning the centenary of British\r\nrule, and the state of feeling in Oude—attend to the strange episode of\r\nthe _chupatties_, as a premonitory symptom of something wrong in the\r\nstate of public feeling in India.\r\n\r\nThe chupatties—small cakes of unleavened bread, about two inches in\r\ndiameter, made of Indian corn-meal, and forming part of the sepoys’\r\nregular diet—were regarded in England, as soon as the circumstances of\r\nthe Revolt became known, as signs or symptoms which the various officers\r\nof the Company in India ought sedulously to have searched into. Ever\r\nsince the middle of 1856—ever since, indeed, the final arrangements for\r\nthe annexation of Oude—these chupatties were known to have been passing\r\nfrom hand to hand. A messenger would come to a village, seek out the\r\nheadman or village elder, give him six chupatties, and say: ‘These six\r\ncakes are sent to you; you will make six others, and send them on to the\r\nnext village.’ The headman accepted the six cakes, and punctually sent\r\nforward other six as he had been directed. It was a mystery of which the\r\nearly stages were beyond our ken; for no one could say, or no one would\r\nsay, which was the _first_ village whence the cakes were sent. During\r\nmany months this process continued: village after village being brought\r\ninto the chain as successive links, and relays of chupatties being\r\nforwarded from place to place. Mr Disraeli, attacking on one occasion in\r\nthe House of Commons the policy of the Indian government, adverted\r\nsarcastically to this chupatty mystery: ‘Suppose the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwhose territory, in extent and character, has more resemblance to our\r\nEastern possessions than the territory of any other power—suppose the\r\nEmperor of Russia were told—“Sire, there is a very remarkable\r\ncircumstance going on in your territory; from village to village, men\r\nare passing who leave the tail of an ermine or a pot of caviare, with a\r\nmessage to some one to perform the same ceremony. Strange to say, this\r\nhas been going on in some ten thousand villages, and we cannot make head\r\nor tail of it.” I think the Emperor of Russia would say: “I do not know\r\nwhether you can make head or tail of it, but I am quite certain there is\r\nsomething wrong, and that we must take some precautions; because, where\r\nthe people are not usually indiscreet and troublesome, they do not make\r\na secret communication unless it is opposed to the government. This is a\r\nsecret communication, and therefore a communication dangerous to the\r\ngovernment.”’ The opposition leader did not assert that the government\r\ncould have penetrated the mystery, but that the mystery ought to have\r\nbeen regarded as significant of something dangerous, worthy of close\r\nscrutiny and grave consideration.\r\n\r\nThe chupatties first appeared in the Northwest Provinces, around Delhi;\r\nand subsequent events offered a temptation for rebuking the\r\ngovernor-general and the commander-in-chief, in having failed to\r\nstrengthen the posts with English troops after the indications of some\r\nsecret conspiracy had thus been made. In some places it was ascertained\r\nthat the cakes were to be kept _till called for_ by the messengers,\r\nother cakes being sent on instead of them; but what was the meaning of\r\nthis arrangement, the English officials could not, or at least did not\r\nfind out. In Scotland, in the clannish days, war-signals were sent from\r\nhut to hut and from clan to clan with extraordinary rapidity; and,\r\nhowever little an unleavened cake might appear like a war-signal,\r\nmilitary men and politicians ought certainly to have been alive to such\r\nstrange manifestations as this chupatty movement. From the Sutlej to\r\nPatna, throughout a vast range of thickly populated country, was the\r\nsecret correspondence carried on. One thing at any rate may safely be\r\nasserted, that the military stations required close watching at such a\r\ntime; something was fermenting in the minds of the natives which the\r\nEnglish could not understand; but that very fact would have\r\njustified—nay, rendered almost imperative—the guarding of the chief\r\nposts from sudden surprise. Little or nothing of this precautionary\r\naction seems to have been attempted. Throughout nearly the whole of the\r\ngreat trunk-road from Calcutta to the Punjaub, the military stations\r\nwere left as before, almost wholly in the hands of the sepoys. At\r\nBenares there was only a single company of European foot-artillery; the\r\nrest of the troops consisting of two regiments of native infantry, and\r\none of the Cis-Sutlej Sikh regiments. At Allahabad, the great supply\r\nmagazine of the province was left almost wholly to the guard of the\r\nsepoys. Lucknow had only one European regiment and one company of\r\nartillery; notwithstanding that, as the capital of Oude, it was in the\r\nmidst of a warlike and excited population; while the native army of the\r\nprovince, capable of soon assembling at the city, comprised no less than\r\nfourteen regiments of infantry, six of cavalry, and six companies of\r\nartillery. Cawnpore, a very important station with a large medical\r\ndepôt, contained three regiments of native infantry, one of native\r\ncavalry, and two companies of native artillery with twelve guns; while\r\nthe English force was only a company of infantry, and about sixty\r\nartillerymen with six guns. The large magazine of Delhi, the great\r\nstorehouse of ammunition for the military stations all around it, was\r\nleft to be guarded entirely by sepoys. The late General Anson, at that\r\ntime commander-in-chief, was among the hills at Simla, relaxing from his\r\nduties; and neither at Simla nor at Calcutta did it seem to be felt\r\nthat, with existing symptoms, more European troops were necessary in the\r\nBengal and Northwest Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe chupatty was not the only symbol of some mystery: the _lotus_ was\r\nanother. It was a common occurrence for a man to come to a cantonment\r\nwith a lotus-flower, and give it to the chief native officer of a\r\nregiment; the flower was circulated from hand to hand in the regiment;\r\neach man took it, looked at it, and passed it on, saying nothing. When\r\nthe lotus came to the last man in the regiment, he disappeared for a\r\ntime, and took it to the next military station. This strange process\r\noccurred throughout nearly all the military stations where regiments of\r\nthe Bengal native army were cantoned.\r\n\r\nChupatties and lotus-flowers, together with the incendiarism and the\r\ncartridge grievances presently to be noticed, unquestionably indicated\r\nsome widely spread discontent among the natives—military if not general.\r\n‘It is clear,’ in the words of an observant officer, writing from one of\r\nthe Cis-Sutlej stations, ‘that a certain ferment had been allowed\r\ngradually to arise throughout the mass of the Bengal army. In some it\r\nwas panic, in some excitement, in some a mere general apprehension or\r\nexpectation, and in some it was no doubt disaffection, or even\r\nconspiracy. Governing an alien people and a vast army, we had divested\r\nourselves of all the instruments of foreign domination so familiar to\r\nAustria and all other continental powers. We had no political police, no\r\nEuropean strongholds, no system of intelligence or espionage,\r\ncomparatively little real military discipline; and even our own\r\npost-office was the channel of free, constant, and unchecked intercourse\r\nbetween all the different regiments. Not a letter even was opened; that\r\nwould have been too abhorrent to English principles. The sepoy mind had\r\nprobably become prepared to distrust us, as we had begun to distrust\r\nthem. There were strange new legislative acts, and new post-office\r\nrules, and new foreign service enlistments, and new employment of armed\r\nraces in our army, and other things disagreeable and alarming to the\r\ntrue old sepoy caste. And then it came about that from a small and\r\ntrifling beginning, one of those ferments to which the native mind is\r\nsomewhat prone, took possession of the sepoy army.’\r\n\r\nOne of the strange facts connected with the chupatty movement was, that\r\nthe cakes were transmitted to the heads of villages who have not been\r\nconcerned in the mutiny, while many sepoys who broke out in revolt had\r\nreceived no cakes. They appear to have been distributed mostly to the\r\nvillagers; whereas the lotus passed from hand to hand among the\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nThe chupatties and the lotus-flowers, however indicative they may have\r\nbeen of the existence of intrigue and conspiracy, were quiet\r\nindications; but there were not wanting other proofs of a mutinous\r\nspirit, in acts of violence and insubordination—apart from the\r\nincendiarisms and the cartridge difficulties. On one evening, early in\r\nthe year, information was given by a sepoy of the intention of the men\r\nto rise against their officers and seize on Fort William, at Calcutta.\r\nOn another occasion, a fanatic moulvie, a high Mohammedan priest at\r\nOude, was detected preaching war against the infidels; and on his person\r\nwas found a proclamation exciting the people to rebellion. On a third\r\nday, two sepoys were detected in an attempt to sap the fidelity of the\r\nguard at the Calcutta mint. An English surgeon in an hospital at\r\nLucknow, by the bedside of a sepoy, put his lips to a bottle of medicine\r\nbefore giving it to his patient; this being regarded as a pollution, a\r\npundit was sent for to break the bottle and exorcise the evil: on that\r\nnight the doctor’s bungalow was burned down by incendiaries who could\r\nnot be discovered. A refusal to accept a furlough or leave of absence\r\nmight not usually be regarded as a symptom of a mutinous spirit; yet in\r\nIndia it conveyed a meaning that could not safely be disregarded. On the\r\n6th of March, the commander-in-chief, with the sanction of the\r\ngovernor-general, notified that the native army would receive, as usual,\r\nthe annual indulgence of furlough from the 1st of April to a certain\r\nsubsequent date. When this order was read or issued, about fourteen men\r\nof the 63d native infantry, stationed at Soorie, and under orders to\r\nproceed to Berhampore, evinced a disinclination to avail themselves of\r\nthe indulgence, on the plea that none of the regiments at Barrackpore\r\nintended to take theirs. It certainly appears to have been a\r\ncircumstance worthy of a searching inquiry by the military authorities,\r\n_why_ the troops should have declined to take their furlough at that\r\nparticular time.\r\n\r\nWe must now pass on to that series of events which, so far as outward\r\nmanifestations are concerned, was more especially the immediate\r\nforerunner of the Revolt—namely, the disturbances connected with the\r\n_greased cartridges_. Let not the reader for a moment regard this as a\r\ntrivial matter, merely because it would be trivial in England: the\r\nsepoys may have been duped, and indeed were unquestionably duped, by\r\ndesigning men; but the subject of suspicion was a serious one to them.\r\nThe fat of cows and of pigs is regarded in a peculiar light in the East.\r\nThe pig is as much held in abhorrence by the Mohammedans as the cow is\r\nvenerated by the Hindoos; to touch the former with the lips, is a\r\ndefilement to the one religion; to touch the latter, is a sacrilege to\r\nthe other. The religious feelings are different, but the results in this\r\ncase are the same. So sacred, indeed, are cattle regarded by the\r\nHindoos, that the Company’s officers have been accustomed to observe\r\nmuch caution in relation to any supply of beef for their own tables; the\r\nslaughter of a cow in a Hindoo village would in itself have been a\r\nsufficient cause for revolt; in large towns where Europeans are\r\nstationed, a high-walled paddock or compound is set apart for the\r\nreception of bullocks intended for food; and scrupulous care is taken\r\nthat the natives shall know as little as possible of the proceedings\r\nconnected with the slaughtering. The use of cow’s fat in ammunition\r\nwould therefore be repulsive to the Hindoo sepoy. Many experienced men\r\ntrace the mutiny to a false report concerning the cartridges, acting on\r\nthe minds of natives who had already become distrustful by the\r\nmachinations of agitators and emissaries. ‘It is a marvel and a mystery\r\nthat so many years should have passed away without an explosion. At last\r\na firebrand was applied to what a single spark might have ignited; and\r\nin the course of a few weeks there was a general conflagration; but a\r\nconflagration which still bears more marks of accident than of\r\ndeliberate conspiracy and incendiarism. In a most unhappy hour—in an\r\nhour laden with a concurrence of adverse circumstances—the incident of\r\nthe greased cartridges occurred. It found the Bengal army in a season of\r\nprofound peace, and in a state of relaxed discipline. It found the\r\nsepoys pondering over the predictions and the fables which had been so\r\nassiduously circulated in their lines and their bazaars; it found them\r\nwith imaginations inflamed and fears excited by strange stories of the\r\ndesigns of their English masters; it found them, as they fancied, with\r\ntheir purity of caste threatened, and their religious distinctions\r\ninvaded, by the proselytising and annexing Englishmen. Still, there was\r\nno palpable evidence of this. Everything was vague, intangible, obscure.\r\nCredulous and simple-minded as they were, many might have retained a\r\nlingering confidence in the good faith and the good intentions of the\r\nBritish government: had it not been suddenly announced to them, just as\r\nthey were halting between two opinions, that, in prosecution of his\r\nlong-cherished design to break down the religion both of Mohammedan and\r\nHindoo, the Feringhee had determined to render their military service\r\nthe means of their degradation, by compelling them to apply their lips\r\nto a cartridge saturated with animal grease—the fat of the swine being\r\nused for the pollution of the one, and the fat of the cow for the\r\ndegradation of the other. If the most astute emissaries of evil who\r\ncould be employed for the corruption of the Bengal sepoy had addressed\r\nthemselves to the task of inventing a lie for the confirmation and\r\nsupport of all his fears and superstitions, they could have found\r\nnothing more cunningly devised for their purpose.’[6]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 7th of February 1857 that the governor-general\r\ncommunicated to the home government the first account of anything\r\nmysterious or unpleasant in relation to the greased cartridges. He had\r\nto announce that a dissatisfaction had exhibited itself among the native\r\ntroops attached to the musketry-depôt at Dumdum. There are two Dumdums,\r\ntwo Dumdumas, one Dumdumma, and one Dumdumineah in India; but the place\r\nindicated is in Bengal, a few miles out of Calcutta, and about half-way\r\nbetween that city and Barrackpore. It was formerly the head-quarters of\r\nartillery for the presidency of Bengal; and near it is an excellent\r\ncannon-foundry, with casting-rooms, boring-rooms, and all the appliances\r\nfor making brass guns. It is a sort of Woolwich on a humble scale,\r\nconnected with ordnance and firearms.\r\n\r\nThe sepoys at Dumdum had heard rumours which induced them to believe\r\nthat the grease used for preparing the cartridges for the recently\r\nintroduced Enfield rifles was composed of the fat of pigs and\r\ncows—substances which their religion teaches them to regard in a light\r\naltogether strange to Europeans. It was not the first time by three or\r\nfour years that the cartridge-question had excited attention in India,\r\nalthough in England the public knew absolutely nothing concerning it.\r\nFrom documents brought to light during the earlier months of the mutiny,\r\nit appears that in 1853 the commander-in-chief of the forces in India\r\ndirected the adjutant-general of the Bengal army to call the attention\r\nof the governor-general to the subject of cartridges as connected with\r\nthe prejudices of the natives. For what reason grease of any kind is\r\nemployed on or with cartridges, may be soon explained. A cartridge, as\r\nmost persons are aware, is a contrivance for quickly loading firearms.\r\nInstead of inserting the powder and bullet separately into the musket,\r\nrifle, or pistol, as was the earlier wont, the soldier is provided with\r\na supply of small cartridge-paper tubes, each containing a bullet and\r\nthe proper proportion of powder; and by the employment of these\r\ncartridges much time and attention are saved under circumstances where\r\nboth are especially valuable. The missiles are called _ball_ or _blank_\r\ncartridges, according as they do or do not each contain a bullet. Now\r\nthe Enfield rifle, an English improvement on the celebrated Minié rifle\r\ninvented and used by the French, was largely manufactured by machinery\r\nin a government establishment at Enfield, for use in the British and\r\nIndian armies; and in firing from this or other rifles it was necessary\r\nthat the ball-end of the cartridge should have an external application\r\nof some greasy substance, to facilitate its movement through the barrel.\r\nIn the year above named, the East India Company informed the Calcutta\r\ngovernment, that a supply of new-greased cartridges had been sent, which\r\nthe Board of Ordnance wished should be subjected to the test of climate.\r\nIt was concerning these cartridges that the commander-in-chief\r\nrecommended caution; on the ground that ‘unless it be known that the\r\ngrease employed in these cartridges is not of a nature to offend or\r\ninterfere with the prejudices of caste, it will be expedient not to\r\nissue them for test to native corps, but to Europeans only, to be\r\ncarried in pouch.’ It was not until June 1854 that the cartridges were\r\nreceived in India; and during the next twelve months they were subjected\r\nto various tests, at Calcutta, at Cawnpore, and at Rangoon. The\r\ncartridges had been greased in four ways—with common grease, with\r\nlaboratory grease, with Belgian grease, and with Hoffman’s grease, in\r\neach case with an admixture of creosote and tobacco; one set was tested\r\nby being placed in the ordnance magazines, a second by being kept in\r\nwagons, and a third by being tied up in pouch-bundles. The result of\r\nthese tests was communicated to the directors in the autumn of 1855; and\r\nas a consequence, a modification was effected in the cartridges\r\nafterwards sent from England for service with the Enfield rifles in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nTo return now to the affair at Dumdum. When the complaints and\r\nsuspicions of the sepoys were made known, inquiries were sent to England\r\nfor exact particulars relating to the obnoxious missiles. It was\r\nascertained that the new cartridges were made at the Royal Laboratory at\r\nWoolwich; and that Captain Boxer, the superintendent of that department,\r\nwas accustomed to use for lubrication a composition formed of five parts\r\ntallow, five parts stearine, and one part wax—containing, therefore, ox\r\nor cow’s fat, but none from pigs. He had no prejudices in the matter to\r\ncontend against in England, and used therefore just such a composition\r\nas appeared to him most suitable for the purpose. The cartridges were\r\nnot sent out to India ready greased for use; as, in a hot country, the\r\ngrease would soon be absorbed by the paper: there was, therefore, a part\r\nof the process left to be accomplished when the cartridges reached their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been in the latter part of January that the first\r\nopen manifestation was made at Dumdum of a disinclination to use the\r\ncartridges; and immediately a correspondence among the authorities\r\ncommenced concerning it. When the complaint had been made, the men were\r\nseemingly appeased on being assured that the matter would be duly\r\nrepresented; and as a means of conciliation, cartridges without grease\r\nwere issued, the men being allowed to apply any lubricating substance\r\nthey chose. It was further determined that no more ready-made cartridges\r\nshould be obtained from England, but that bullets and paper should be\r\nsent separately, to be put together in India; that experiments should be\r\nmade at Woolwich, to produce some lubricating substance free from any of\r\nthe obnoxious ingredients; and that other experiments should meanwhile\r\nbe made by the 60th Rifles—at that time stationed at Meerut—having the\r\nsame object in view.\r\n\r\nDuring the inquiry into the manifestation and alleged motives of this\r\ninsubordination, one fact was elicited, which, if correct, seems to\r\npoint to a date when the conspirators—whoever they may have been—began\r\nto act upon the dupes. On the 22d of January, a low-caste Hindoo asked a\r\nsepoy of the 2d Bengal Grenadiers to give him a little water from his\r\nlota or bottle; the other, being a Brahmin, refused, on the ground that\r\nthe applicant would defile the vessel by his touch—a magnificence of\r\nclass-superiority to which only the Hindoo theory could afford place.\r\nThis refusal was met by a retort, that the Brahmin need not pride\r\nhimself on his caste, for he would soon lose it, as he would ere long be\r\nrequired to bite off the ends of cartridges covered with the fat of pigs\r\nand cows. The Brahmin, alarmed, spread the report; and the native\r\ntroops, as is alleged, were afraid that when they went home their\r\nfriends would refuse to eat with them. When this became known to the\r\nEnglish officers, the native troops were drawn up on parade, and\r\nencouraged to state the grounds of their dissatisfaction. All the native\r\nsergeants and corporals, and two-thirds of all the privates, at once\r\nstepped forward, expressed their abhorrence of having to touch anything\r\ncontaining the fat of cows or pigs, and suggested the employment of wax\r\nor oil for lubricating the cartridges. It was then that the conciliatory\r\nmeasures, noticed above, were adopted.\r\n\r\nStill were there troubles and suspicious circumstances; but the scene is\r\nnow transferred from Dumdum to Barrackpore. This town, sixteen miles\r\nfrom Calcutta, is worthy of note chiefly for its connection with the\r\nsupreme government of India. The governor-general has a sort of suburban\r\nresidence there, handsome, commodious, and situated in the midst of a\r\nvery beautiful park. There are numerous bungalows or villas inhabited by\r\nEuropean families, drawn to the spot by the salubrity of the air, by the\r\nbeauty of the Hoogly branch of the Ganges, at this place three-quarters\r\nof a mile in width, and by the garden and promenade attached to the\r\ngovernor-general’s villa. In military matters, before the Revolt, there\r\nwas a ‘presidency division of the army,’ of which some of the troops\r\nwere in Calcutta, some at Barrackpore, and a small force of artillery at\r\nDumdum, nearly midway between the two places; the whole commanded by a\r\ngeneral officer at Barrackpore, under whom was a brigadier to command\r\nthat station only. The station is convenient for military operations in\r\nthe eastern part of Bengal, and for any sudden emergencies at Calcutta.\r\nSix regiments of native infantry were usually cantoned at Barrackpore,\r\nwith a full complement of officers: the men hutted in commodious lines,\r\nand the officers accommodated in bungalows or lodges.\r\n\r\nIt was at this place that the discontent next shewed itself, much to the\r\nvexation of the government, who had hoped that the Dumdum affair had\r\nbeen satisfactorily settled, and who had explained to the native\r\nregiments at Barrackpore what had been done to remove the alleged cause\r\nof complaint. The sepoys at this place, however, made an objection to\r\nbite off the ends of the cartridges—a necessary preliminary to the\r\nloading of a rifle—on account of the animal fat contained, or supposed\r\nto be contained, in the grease with which the paper was lubricated: such\r\nfat not being permitted to touch the lips or tongues of the men, under\r\nperil of defilement. Some of the authorities strongly suspected that\r\nthis renewed discontent was the work of secret agitators rather than a\r\nspontaneous expression of the men’s real feeling. There was at the time\r\na religious Hindoo society or party at Calcutta, called the Dhurma\r\nSobha, suspected of having spread rumours that the British government\r\nintended to compel the Hindoos to become Christians. Contemporaneously,\r\ntoo, with this movement, three incendiary fires took place at\r\nBarrackpore within four days; and a native sergeant’s bungalow was burnt\r\ndown at Raneegunge, another military station in Lower Bengal. It was\r\nnatural, therefore, that General Hearsey, the responsible officer at\r\nBarrackpore, should wish to ascertain what connection, if any, existed\r\nbetween these incendiarisms, intrigues, complainings, and greased\r\ncartridges. This was the more imperative, on account of the relative\r\npaucity of English troops in that part of India. There were four native\r\nregiments quartered at that time at Barrackpore—namely, the 2d\r\nGrenadiers, the 34th and 70th Native Infantry, and the 43d Native Light\r\nInfantry; whereas, in the four hundred miles between Calcutta and\r\nDinapoor there was only one European regiment, the Queen’s 53d foot, of\r\nwhich one half was at Calcutta and the other half at Dumdum. The general\r\nheld a special court of inquiry at Barrackpore on the 6th of February,\r\nand selected a portion of the 2d native Grenadier regiment to come\r\nforward and explain the cause of their continued objection to the paper\r\nof which the new rifle-cartridges were composed. One of the sepoys,\r\nByjonath Pandy, stated that he felt a suspicion that the paper might\r\naffect his caste. On being asked his reason for this suspicion, he\r\nanswered that the paper was a new kind which he had not seen before; and\r\nthere was a ‘bazaar report’ that the paper contained animal fat. On\r\nbeing requested to examine the paper carefully in the light, and to\r\nexplain to the court what he saw objectionable in it, he replied that\r\nhis suspicion proceeded from the paper being stiff and cloth-like, and\r\nfrom its tearing differently from the paper formerly in use. Another\r\nsepoy, Chaud Khan, was then examined. He objected to the paper because\r\nit was tough, and burned as if it contained grease. He stated that much\r\ndismay had been occasioned in the regiment by the fact that ‘on the 4th\r\nof February a piece of the cartridge-paper was dipped in water, and then\r\nburned; when burning, it made a fizzing noise, and smelt as if there\r\nwere grease in it.’ Thereupon a piece of the paper was burned in open\r\ncourt; Chaud Khan confessed that he could not smell or see grease in it;\r\nbut he repeated his objection to the use of the paper, on the plea that\r\n‘everybody is dissatisfied with it on account of its being glazed,\r\nshining like waxed cloth.’ Another witness, Khadu Buksh, filling the\r\nrank of subadar or native captain, on being examined, frankly stated\r\nthat he had no objection to the cartridge itself, but that there was a\r\ngeneral report in the cantonment that the paper was made up with fat. A\r\njemadar or lieutenant, named Golal Khan, said very positively: ‘There is\r\ngrease in it, I feel assured; as it differs from the paper which has\r\nheretofore been always used for cartridges.’ As shewing the well-known\r\npower of what in England would be called ‘public opinion,’ the answer of\r\none of the sepoys is worthy of notice; he candidly confessed that he\r\nhimself had no objection to use the cartridges, but he could not do so,\r\nas his companions would object to it. While these occurrences were under\r\nscrutiny, a jemadar of the 34th regiment came forward to narrate what he\r\nknew on the matter, as affording proof of conspiracy. On the 5th, when\r\nthe fear of detection had begun to work among them, two or three of the\r\nsepoys came to him, and asked him to accompany them to the\r\nparade-ground. He did so, and there found a great crowd assembled,\r\ncomposed of men of the different regiments at the station; they had\r\ntheir heads tied up in handkerchiefs or cloths, so that only a small\r\npart of the face was exposed. They told him they were determined to die\r\nfor their religion; and that if they could concert a plan that evening,\r\nthey would on the next night plunder the station and kill all the\r\nEuropeans, and then depart whither they pleased. The number he stated to\r\nbe about three hundred. It was not at the time known to the authorities,\r\nbut was rendered probable by circumstances afterwards brought to light,\r\nthat letters and emissaries were being despatched, at the beginning of\r\nFebruary, from the native troops at Barrackpore to those at other\r\nstations, inviting them to rise in revolt against the British.\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances, a discussion concerning such petty\r\nmatters as bits of cartridge-paper and items of grease would be simply\r\nridiculous; but at that time and place the ruling authorities, although\r\nignorant of the real extent of the danger, saw clearly that they could\r\nnot afford to regard such matters as otherwise than serious. There was\r\neither a sincere prejudice to be conciliated, or a wide-spread\r\nconspiracy to be met; and it was at once determined to test again the\r\nsincerity of the sepoys, by yielding to their (apparently) religious\r\nfeelings on a matter which did not affect the efficiency of the service.\r\nA trial was made, therefore, of a mode of loading the rifle without\r\nbiting the cartridge, by tearing off the end with the left hand. The\r\ncommander-in-chief, finding on inquiry that this method was sufficiently\r\nefficacious, and willing to get rid of mere formalism in the matter,\r\nconsented that the plan should be adopted both for percussion-muskets\r\nand for rifles. This done, the governor-general, by virtue of his\r\nsupreme command, ordered the adoption of the same system throughout\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe scene now again changes: we have to attend to certain proceedings at\r\nBerhampore, following on those at Barrackpore. Of Berhampore as a town,\r\nlittle need be said here; and that little is called for principally to\r\ndetermine _which_ Berhampore is meant. Under the forms Berhampore,\r\nBerhampoor, or Burhampore, there are no less than four towns in\r\nIndia—one in the native state of Nepaul, sixty miles from Khatmandoo;\r\nanother in the Nagpoor territory, sixty miles from the city of the same\r\nname; another in the Madras presidency, near Orissa; and a fourth in the\r\ndistrict of Moorshedabad, Lower Bengal. It is this last-named Berhampore\r\nto which attention is here directed. The town is on the left bank of the\r\nriver Bhagruttee, a great offset of the Ganges, and on the high road\r\nfrom Calcutta to Moorshedabad—distant about a hundred and twenty miles\r\nfrom the first-named city by land, and a hundred and sixty by water. It\r\nis in a moist, unhealthy spot, very fatal to Europeans, and in\r\nconsequence disliked by them as a station in past times; but sanitary\r\nmeasures, draining, and planting have greatly improved it within the\r\nlast few years. As a town, it is cheerful and attractive in appearance,\r\nadorned by stately houses in the neighbourhood, to accommodate permanent\r\nBritish residents. The military cantonments are large and striking; the\r\ngrand square, the excellent parade-ground, the quarters of the European\r\nofficers—all are handsome. Before the Revolt, Berhampore was included\r\nwithin the presidency division in military matters, and was usually\r\noccupied by a body of infantry and another of artillery. There is\r\npainful evidence of the former insalubrity of the station met with in a\r\nlarge open space filled with tombstones, contrasting mournfully with the\r\nmajestic cantonments of the military. Berhampore has, or had a few years\r\nago, a manufactory of the silk bandana handkerchiefs once so popular in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe troubles in this town were first made manifest in the following way.\r\nOn or about the 24th of February, a portion of the 34th regiment of\r\nBengal infantry changed its station from Barrackpore to Berhampore,\r\nwhere it was greeted and feasted by the men of the 19th native infantry,\r\nstationed there at that time. During their feasting, the new-comers\r\nnarrated all the news from Dumdum and Barrackpore concerning the greased\r\ncartridges; and the effects of this gossip were very soon made visible.\r\nTo understand what occurred, the mode of piling or storing arms in India\r\nmust be attended to; in the Bombay army, and in the Queen’s regiments,\r\nthe men were wont to keep their arms with them in their huts; but in the\r\nBengal army, it was a custom to deposit them in circular brick buildings\r\ncalled bells, which were kept locked under native guard, each in front\r\nof a particular company’s lines. The men of the 19th regiment, then,\r\nexcited by the rumours and stories, the fears and suspicions of their\r\ncompanions in arms elsewhere, but not knowing or not believing—or\r\nperhaps not caring for—the promises of change made by the military\r\nauthorities, broke out into insubordination. On the 26th of February,\r\nbeing ordered to parade for exercise with blank cartridges, they refused\r\nto receive the percussion-caps, as a means of rendering their firing\r\nimpossible—alleging that the cartridge-paper supplied for the charge was\r\nof two kinds; that they doubted the qualities of one or both; and that\r\nthey believed in the presence of the fat of cows or pigs in the grease\r\nemployed. That the men were either dupes or intriguers is evident; for\r\nit so happened that the cartridges offered to them were the very same in\r\nkind as they had used during many years, and had been made up before a\r\nsingle Enfield rifle had reached India. This resistance was a serious\r\naffair; it was something more than a complaint or petition, and needed\r\nto be encountered with a strong hand. It is a matter of opinion, judged\r\ndifferently even by military men accustomed to India and its natives,\r\nwhether the proper course was on that occasion taken. The commanding\r\nofficer, Lieutenant-colonel Mitchell, ordered a detachment of native\r\ncavalry and a battery of native artillery—the only troops at Barrackpore\r\nbesides those already named—to be on parade on the following morning.\r\nBetween ten and eleven o’clock at night, however, the men of the 19th\r\nregiment broke open the armouries or bells, took possession of their\r\nmuskets and ammunition, and carried them to their lines. The next day,\r\nthe guns were got ready, and the officers proceeded to the\r\nparade-ground, where they found the men in undress, but armed, formed in\r\nline, and shouting. The officers were threatened if they came on.\r\nMitchell then expostulated with them; he pointed out the absurdity of\r\ntheir suspicions, and the unworthiness of their present conduct, and\r\ncommanded them to give up their arms and return peaceably to their\r\nlines; whereupon the native officers said the men would refuse so to do\r\nunless the cavalry and artillery were withdrawn. The lieutenant-colonel\r\nwithdrew them, and then the infantry yielded. It was a difficult\r\nposition for an officer to be placed in; if he had struggled, it would\r\nhave been with natives against natives; and, doubtful of the result of\r\nsuch a contest, he assented to the men’s conditional surrender.\r\n\r\nThe affair could not be allowed to end here. The Calcutta authorities,\r\nreceiving news on the 4th of March of this serious disaffection, but\r\ndeeming it unsafe to punish while so few European troops were at hand,\r\nsent quietly to Rangoon in Pegu, with orders that Her Majesty’s 84th\r\nfoot should steam up to Calcutta as quickly as possible. On the 20th,\r\nthis regiment arrived; and then the governor-general, acting in harmony\r\nwith Major-general Hearsey, resolved on the disbandment of the native\r\nregiment which had disregarded the orders of its superiors. Accordingly,\r\non the 31st of March, the 19th regiment was marched from Berhampore to\r\nBarrackpore, the head-quarters of the military division; the men were\r\ndisarmed, paid off, marched out of the cantonments as far as Palta\r\nGhaut, and conveyed across the river in steamers placed for the purpose.\r\nIn short, the regiment, in a military sense, was destroyed, without\r\npersonal punishment to any of the men composing it. But though not\r\npunished, in the ordinary sense, the infliction was a great one; for the\r\nmen at once became penniless, unoccupied, objectless. The\r\ngovernor-general, in describing these proceedings for the information of\r\nthe home government, added: ‘We trust that the severe measures which we\r\nhave been forced to adopt will have the effect of convincing the native\r\ntroops that they will only bring ruin on themselves by failing in their\r\nduty to the state and in obedience to their officers.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VISCOUNT CANNING.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion just adverted to, General Hearsey addressed the men very\r\nenergetically, while an official paper from the governor-general, read\r\nto the troops, asserted in distinct terms that the rumour was wholly\r\ngroundless which imputed to the government an intention to interfere\r\nwith the religion of the people. It was a charge soon afterwards brought\r\nin England against the governor-general, that, having subscribed to\r\ncertain missionary societies in India, he did not like to abjure all\r\nattempts at the conversion of the natives; and that, being thus balanced\r\nbetween his public duty and his private religious feeling, he had issued\r\nthe general order to the whole army, but had not shewn any solicitude to\r\nconvey that positive declaration to all the natives in all the\r\ncantonments or military stations. This, however, was said when Viscount\r\nCanning was not present to defend himself; reasonable men soon saw that\r\nthe truth was not to be obtained by such charges, unless supported by\r\ngood evidence. It is, however, certain, that much delay and routine\r\nformality occurred throughout all these proceedings. As early as the\r\n11th of February, General Hearsey wrote from Barrackpore the expressive\r\nwords: ‘We are on a mine ready to explode’—in allusion to the uneasy\r\nstate of feeling or opinion among the sepoys that their religious usages\r\nwere about to be tampered with; and yet it was not until the 27th of\r\nMarch that the Supreme Council at Calcutta agreed to the issue of a\r\ngeneral order declaring it to be the invariable rule of the government\r\nto treat the religious tendencies of all its servants with respect; nor\r\nuntil the 31st that this general order was read to the troops at\r\nBarrackpore. Considering the mournful effects of dilatoriness and rigid\r\nformalism during the Crimean war, the English public had indulged a hope\r\nthat a healthy reform would be introduced into the epistolary mechanism\r\nof the government departments; and this was certainly to some extent\r\nrealised in England; but unfortunately the reform had not yet reached\r\nIndia. During these early months of the mutiny, an absurd waste of time\r\noccurred in the writing and despatching of an enormous number of\r\nletters, where a personal interview, or a verbal message by a trusty\r\nservant, might have sufficed. Eight letters were written, and four days\r\nconsumed, before the Calcutta authorities knew what was passing at\r\nDumdum, eight miles distant. A certain order given by the colonel of a\r\nregiment at Calcutta being considered injudicious by the general, an\r\ninquiry was made as to the grounds for the order; eight days and nine\r\nletters were required for this inquiry and the response to it, and yet\r\nthe two officers were within an hour’s distance of each other during the\r\nwhole time. Although the affair at Barrackpore on the 6th of February\r\nwas assuredly of serious import, it was not known to the government at\r\nCalcutta until the evening of the 10th, notwithstanding that a horseman\r\nmight easily have ridden the sixteen miles in two hours. General\r\nHearsey’s reply to a question as to the cause of the delay is truly\r\ninstructive, as exemplifying the slowness of official progress in India:\r\n‘I have no means of communicating anything to the government; I have no\r\nmounted orderly, no express camels; I must always write by the post; and\r\nthat leaves Barrackpore at the most inconvenient hour of three o’clock\r\nin the afternoon.’ These facts, trivial in themselves, are worthy of\r\nbeing borne in mind, as indicative of defects in the mechanism of\r\ngovernment likely to be disastrous in times of excitement and\r\ninsubordination.\r\n\r\nBarrackpore was destined to be a further source of vexation and\r\nembarrassment to the government. It will be remembered that a part of\r\nthe 34th native infantry went from that town to Berhampore in the last\r\nweek in February; but the bulk of the regiment remained at Barrackpore.\r\nInquiries, afterwards instituted, brought to light the fact that the\r\nEuropean commander of that regiment had been accustomed to distribute\r\nreligious tracts among his men; and it was surmised that the scruples\r\nand prejudices of the natives, especially the Brahmins, had been\r\nunfavourably affected by this proceeding. But whether the cause had or\r\nhad not been rightly guessed, it is certain that the 34th displayed more\r\nmutinous symptoms at that time than any other regiment. When the news of\r\nthe disturbance at Berhampore reached them, they became greatly excited:\r\nthey attended to their duties, but with sullen doggedness; and they held\r\nnightly meetings, at which speeches were made sympathetic with the\r\nBerhampore mutineers. The authorities, not wholly ignorant of these\r\nmeetings, nevertheless remained quiet until a European regiment could\r\narrive to aid them. When the Queen’s 84th arrived at Calcutta, the 34th\r\nwere more excited than ever, believing that something hostile was\r\nintended against them; their whispers became murmurs, and they openly\r\nexpressed their sympathy. When, in accordance with the plan noticed in\r\nthe last paragraph, the 19th were marched off from Berhampore to be\r\ndisbanded at Barrackpore, the 34th displayed still greater audacity. The\r\n19th having rested for a time at Barraset, eight miles from Barrackpore,\r\na deputation from the 34th met them, and made a proposal that they\r\nshould that very night kill all their officers, march to Barrackpore,\r\njoin the 2d and 34th, fire the bungalows, surprise and overwhelm the\r\nEuropeans, seize the guns, and then march to threaten Calcutta. Had the\r\n19th been as wild and daring, as irritated and vengeful, as the 34th,\r\nthere is no knowing what calamities might have followed; but they\r\nexhibited rather a repentant and regretful tone, and submitted\r\nobediently to all the details of their disbandment at Barrackpore.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be seen that the seeds of further disaffection had\r\nbeen already sown. As the 34th native infantry had been instrumental in\r\ninciting the 19th to mutiny, ending in disbandment, so did it now bring\r\na similar punishment on itself. On the 29th of March, one Mungal Pandy,\r\na sepoy in the 34th, roused to a state of excitement by the use of\r\nintoxicating drugs, armed himself with a sword and a loaded musket,\r\ntraversed the lines, called upon his comrades to rise, and declared he\r\nwould shoot the first European he met. Lieutenant Baugh, adjutant of the\r\ncorps, hearing of this man’s conduct, and of the excited state of the\r\nregiment generally, rode hastily to the lines. Mungal Pandy fired,\r\nmissed the officer, but struck his horse. The lieutenant, in\r\nself-defence, fired his pistol, but missed aim; whereupon the sepoy\r\nattacked him with his sword, wounded him in the hand, brought him to the\r\nground, and tried to entice the other soldiers to join in the attack.\r\nThe sergeant-major of the corps, who went to the lieutenant’s\r\nassistance, was also wounded by Mungal Pandy. The dark feature in this\r\ntransaction was that many hundred men in the regiment looked on quietly\r\nwithout offering to protect the lieutenant from his assailant; one of\r\nthem, a jemadar, refused to take Mungal into custody, and forbade his\r\nmen to render any assistance to the lieutenant, who narrowly escaped\r\nwith his life. Major-general Hearsey, on being informed of the\r\noccurrence, proceeded to the parade-ground, where, to his astonishment,\r\nhe saw the man walking to and fro, with a blood-smeared sword in one\r\nhand, and a loaded musket in the other. He advanced with some officers\r\nand men to secure the sepoy, which was accomplished with much\r\ndifficulty; and it was only by the most resolute bearing of the\r\nmajor-general that the rest of the men could be induced to return\r\nquietly to their lines. A court-martial was held on Mungal Pandy, and on\r\nthe rebellious jemadar, both of whom were forthwith found guilty, and\r\nexecuted on the 8th of April. No assignable cause appeared for the\r\nconduct of this man: it may have been a mere drunken frenzy; yet there\r\nis more probability that a mutinous spirit, concealed within his breast\r\nduring sober moments, made its appearance unchecked when under the\r\ninfluence of drugs. There was another sepoy, however, who acted\r\nfaithfully on the occasion; this man, Shiek Paltoo, was accompanying\r\nLieutenant Baugh as orderly officer at the time of the attack; and by\r\nhis prompt assistance the lieutenant was saved from further injury than\r\na slight wound. Shiek Paltoo was raised to the rank of supernumerary\r\nhavildar for his brave and loyal conduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Calcutta.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe outrage, however, could not be allowed to terminate without further\r\npunishment. For a time, the government at Calcutta believed that the\r\nexecution of the two principal offenders would suffice, and that the\r\nsepoys would quietly return to their obedience; but certain ominous\r\noccurrences at Lucknow and elsewhere, about the end of April, shewed the\r\nnecessity for a stern line of conduct, especially as the 34th still\r\ndisplayed a kind of sullen doggedness, as if determined on further\r\ninsubordination. After mature consideration the whole of the disposable\r\ntroops in and around Calcutta were, on the 5th of May, marched off to\r\nBarrackpore, to effect the disarming and disbanding of such sepoys among\r\nthe 34th as were present in the lines when Lieutenant Baugh was wounded.\r\nThe force comprised the Queen’s 64th regiment, a wing of the 53d, the\r\n2d, 43d, and 70th native infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and a light\r\nfield-battery with six guns. When these troops had been drawn up in two\r\nsides of a square, on the morning of the 6th, about four hundred sepoys\r\nof the 34th were halted in front of the guns. The order for disbandment\r\nwas read out by the interpreter, Lieutenant Chamier; and after a few\r\nenergetic remarks upon the enormity of their offence, General Hearsey\r\ncommanded them to pile their arms, and strip off the uniform which they\r\nhad disgraced. When this was done, the work of paying up their arrears\r\nwas commenced. They were then dismissed with their families and baggage,\r\nto Chinsura, a town a few miles higher up the Hoogly. The grenadiers of\r\nthe 84th, and a portion of the cavalry, accompanied them to see that\r\nthey went to and settled at Chinsura, and did not cross the river to\r\nChittagong, where three other companies of the same regiment were\r\nstationed. Four of the disbanded sepoys were officers; one of whom, a\r\nsubadar, sobbed bitterly at his loss and degradation, although it was\r\nstrongly suspected that he had been one of the leaders in the\r\ninsubordination. In the general order which the governor-general ordered\r\nto be read to every regiment in the service, concerning this\r\ndisbandment, words occur which shew that the old delusion was still\r\nworking in the breasts of the natives. ‘The sepoy who was the chief\r\nactor in the disgraceful scene of the 29th of March called upon his\r\ncomrades to come to his support, for the reason that their religion was\r\nin danger, and that they were about to be compelled to employ\r\ncartridges, the use of which would do injury to their caste; and from\r\nthe words in which he addressed the sepoys, it is to be inferred that\r\nmany of them shared this opinion with him. The governor-general in\r\ncouncil has recently had occasion to remind the army of Bengal that the\r\ngovernment of India has never interfered to constrain its soldiers in\r\nmatters affecting their religious faith. He has declared that the\r\ngovernment of India never will do so; and he has a right to expect that\r\nthis declaration shall give confidence to all who have been deceived and\r\nled astray. But, whatever may be the deceptions or evil counsels to\r\nwhich others have been exposed, the native officers and men of the 34th\r\nregiment native infantry have no excuse for misapprehension on this\r\nsubject. Not many weeks previously to the 29th of March, it had been\r\nexplained to that regiment—first by their own commanding officer, and\r\nsubsequently by the major-general commanding the division—that their\r\nfears for religion were groundless. It was carefully and clearly shewn\r\nto them that the cartridges which they would be called upon to use\r\ncontained nothing which could do violence to their religious scruples.\r\nIf, after receiving these assurances, the sepoys of the 34th regiment,\r\nor of any other regiment, still refuse to place trust in their officers\r\nand in the government, and still allow suspicions to take root in their\r\nminds, and to grow into disaffection, insubordination, and mutiny, the\r\nfault is their own, and their punishment will be upon their own heads.’\r\n\r\nFive weeks elapsed between the offence of the 19th native infantry and\r\nits punishment by disbandment; five weeks similarly elapsed between the\r\noffence and the disbandment of the 34th; and many observant officers\r\nwere of opinion that these delays worked mischief, by instilling into\r\nthe minds of the sepoys a belief that the authorities were afraid to\r\npunish them. Whether the punishment of disbanding was, after all,\r\nsufficiently severe, is a question on which military men are by no means\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nAt a later date than the events narrated in this chapter, but closely\r\nconnected with them in subject, was the circulation of a report\r\nmanifestly intended to rouse the religious prejudices of the Hindoos by\r\na false assertion concerning the designs of the ruling powers. In some\r\nof the towns of Southern India, far away from Bengal, unknown emissaries\r\ncirculated a paper, or at least a story, of which the following was the\r\nsubstance: That the padres, probably Christian missionaries, had sent a\r\npetition to the Queen of England, complaining of the slowness with which\r\nHindoos were made to become Christians; they adduced the conduct of some\r\nof the Mohammedan potentates of India in past times, such as Tippoo\r\nSaib, who had compelled the Hindoos to embrace Islamism; and they\r\nsuggested a similar authoritative policy. The story made the padres give\r\nthis advice: to mix up bullocks’ fat and pigs’ fat with the grease\r\nemployed on the cartridges; in order that, by touching these substances\r\nwith their teeth or lips, the sepoys might lose caste, and thus induce\r\nthem to embrace Christianity as their only resource. The climax of the\r\nstory was reached by making the Queen express her joy at the plan, and\r\nher resolve that it should be put in operation. The success of such a\r\nlying rumour must, of course, have mainly depended on the ignorance and\r\ncredulity of the natives.\r\n\r\nA far-distant region now calls for notice. At a time when the Upper and\r\nLower Bengal provinces were, as the authorities hoped and believed,\r\nrecovering from the wild excitement of the cartridge question, the\r\ncommissioner of the Cis-Sutlej territory had ample means for knowing\r\nthat the minds of the natives in that region were mischievously agitated\r\nby some cause or other. It is necessary here to understand what is meant\r\nby this geographical designation. If we consult a map in which an\r\nattempt is made, by distinct colouring, to define British territory from\r\nsemi-independent states, we shall find the region between Delhi and\r\nLahore cut up in a most extraordinary way. The red British patches are\r\nseen to meander among the scraps of native territory with great\r\nintricacy: so much so, indeed, that a map on a very large scale could\r\nalone mark the multitudinous lines of boundary; and even such a map\r\nwould soon become obsolete, for the red, like a devouring element, has\r\nbeen year by year absorbing bits of territory formerly painted green or\r\nyellow. The peculiar tribe of the Sikhs, besides occupying the Punjaub,\r\ninhabit a wide region on the east or left bank of the river Sutlej,\r\ngenerally included under the name of Sirhind. For fifty years the\r\nBritish in India have had to deal, or have made a pretext for dealing,\r\nwith the petty Sikh chieftains of this Sirhind region: at one time\r\n‘protecting’ those on the east of the Sutlej from the aggression of the\r\ngreat Sikh leader, Runjeet Singh, on the west of that river; then\r\n‘annexing’ the small territories of some of these chieftains on failure\r\nof male heirs; then seizing others as a punishment for non-neutrality or\r\nnon-assistance during war-time. Thus it arose that—before the annexation\r\nof the Punjaub itself in 1849—much of the Sikh country in Sirhind had\r\nbecome British, and was divided into four districts marked by the towns\r\nof Ferozpore, Umballa or Umballah, Loodianah, and Kythul; leaving\r\nPutialah, Jeend, and Furreedkote as the three principal protected or\r\nsemi-independent Sikh states of that country. Meanwhile a region\r\nsomewhat to the east or northeast of Sirhind was subject to just the\r\nsame process. Being hilly, it is called the Hill Country; and being\r\nruled by a number of petty chieftains, the separate bits of territory\r\nare called the Hill States. During about forty years the process of\r\nabsorption has been going on—arising primarily out of the fact that the\r\nBritish aided the Hill chieftains against the Nepaulese, and then paid\r\nthemselves in their wonted manner. Part of Gurhwal was annexed; then\r\nSundock, Malowa, and a number of other places not easily found in the\r\nmaps; and afterwards Ramgurh was given back in exchange for Simla, to\r\nform a healthy holiday-place among the hills, a sort of Balmoral for\r\nsick governors and commanders. As a final result, much of the Hill\r\nCountry became British, and the rest was left in the hands of about\r\ntwenty petty chieftains.\r\n\r\nNow, when the Cis-Sutlej territory is mentioned, it must be interpreted\r\nas including all the region taken by the British from the minor Sikh\r\nchieftains in Sirhind; together with such of the Hill States of Gurhwal\r\nand its vicinity as have become British. The whole together have been\r\nmade a sub-government, under a commissioner responsible to the\r\ngovernor-general; or, more strictly, the commissioner rules the Sirhind\r\nregion, while the Hills are included among the non-regulation districts\r\nof the Agra government. The four towns and districts of Ferozpore,\r\nLoodianah, Umballa, and Kythul, east of the Sutlej, will suffice for our\r\npurpose to indicate the Cis-Sutlej territory—so named in a Calcutta\r\npoint of view, as being on the _cis_ or _hither_ side of the Sutlej, in\r\nreference to that city.\r\n\r\nIt was at Umballa, one of the towns in the Cis-Sutlej territory, that\r\nthe commissioner, Mr Barnes, reported acts of incendiarism that much\r\nperplexed him. On the 26th of March, Hurbunsee Singh, a subadar or\r\nnative captain in the 36th regiment native infantry, attached to the\r\nmusketry depôt at that place, became an object of attack to the other\r\nmen of the regiment; they endeavoured to burn his hut and his property.\r\nIt was just at the time when reports reached Umballa relative to the\r\ncartridges, the using of which was said by the sepoys to be an\r\ninnovation derogatory to their caste and religion. Hurbunsee Singh had\r\nat once come forward, and publicly stated his willingness to fire with\r\nsuch cartridges, as being, in his opinion, free from objection. The\r\nincendiarism took place on the day named; and the commissioner directly\r\ninferred that there must be something wrong in the thoughts of men who\r\nwould thus seek to injure one of their own native officers on such\r\ngrounds. Nothing further occurred, however, until the 13th of April,\r\nwhen another fire broke out. This was followed by a third on the 15th,\r\nin some outhouses belonging to the 60th native infantry; by two fires on\r\nthe 16th, when government property was burned to the value of thirty\r\nthousand rupees; by the burning on the 17th of an empty bungalow in the\r\n5th regiment native infantry lines, of a stable belonging to an English\r\nofficer of the 60th, and of another building. On the 20th, attempts were\r\nmade on the houses of the jemadar and havildar of the 5th regiment, two\r\nnative officers favourable to the new cartridges; and under the bed of\r\nthe jemadar were found gunpowder and brimstone, as if to destroy the man\r\nas well as his property. Some of the buildings are believed to have been\r\nset on fire by dropping burning brimstone through holes in the roof; and\r\non one occasion, when the attempt at incendiarism had failed, a paper\r\ncontaining powder and brimstone was found. On the 21st and two following\r\ndays, similar fires occurred. On the 25th, the house of the band-master\r\nof Her Majesty’s 9th Lancers was fired and burned; and two or three\r\nsimilar attempts were shortly afterwards made, but frustrated. At all\r\nthese fires, the engines of the cantonment were set to work; but it was\r\nobserved that many of the sepoys worked listlessly and indifferently, as\r\nif their thoughts were bent rather upon fire-raising than\r\nfire-quenching.\r\n\r\nThat such occurrences produced uneasiness among the English authorities\r\nat Umballa may well be supposed. Captain Howard, magistrate of the\r\ncantonment, wrote thus to the Calcutta government: ‘The emanating cause\r\nof the arson at this cantonment, I conceive, originated with regard to\r\nthe newly introduced cartridges, to which the native sepoy shews his\r\ndecided objection: it being obnoxious to him from a false idea—which,\r\nnow that it has entered the mind of the sepoy, is difficult to\r\neradicate—that the innovation of this cartridge is derogatory both to\r\nhis caste and his religion.... That this has led to the fires at this\r\ncantonment, in my own private mind I am perfectly convinced. Were it the\r\nact of only one or two, or even a few persons, the well-disposed sepoys\r\nwould at once have come forward and forthwith informed; but that there\r\nis an organised leagued conspiracy existing, I feel confident. Though\r\nall and every individual composing a regiment may not form part of the\r\ncombination, still I am of opinion that such a league in each corps is\r\nknown to exist; and such being upheld by the majority, or rather\r\nconnived at, therefore it is that no single man dared to come forward\r\nand expose it.’ Although proof could not be obtained of the culpability\r\nof any one sepoy, the incendiarism was at once attributed to them rather\r\nthan to the peasantry. The existence of some oath or bond of secrecy was\r\nfurther supposed from the fact that a reward of one thousand rupees\r\nfailed to bring forward a single witness or accuser. After about twenty\r\nattempts at burning buildings, more or less successful, the system was\r\nchecked—by the establishment of mounted and foot patrols and pickets; by\r\nthe expulsion of all fakeers and idle persons not belonging to the\r\ncantonment; by the refusal of a passage through it to sepoys on furlough\r\nor discharged; and by the arrest of such sepoys in the Umballa regiments\r\nas, having furloughs, still remained in the cantonment—influenced,\r\napparently, by some mischievous designs.\r\n\r\nEvery one coincided in opinion with Captain Howard that there had been\r\nan organised plan among the sepoys; but some of the officers in the\r\nCompany’s service, civil as well as military, differed from him in\r\nattributing it solely to the cartridge affair—they thought this a blind\r\nor pretence to hide some deeper scheme. The commissioner of the\r\nCis-Sutlej states, however, agreed with the magistrate, and expressed an\r\nopinion that nothing would restore quiet but a concession to the natives\r\nin the matter of greased cartridges; and he recommended to the\r\ngovernment at Calcutta the adoption of that line of policy. Writing on\r\nthe 7th of May, he said: ‘Fires, for the present, have ceased; but I do\r\nnot think that this is any indication that the uneasy feeling among the\r\nsepoys is on the wane.’ Considering the position of Umballa, it is no\r\nwonder that those in authority at that spot should feel anxiety\r\nconcerning the safety of their position. Umballa is more than a thousand\r\nmiles from Calcutta, separated from it by the whole of the important\r\nstates in which the cities of Delhi, Meerut, Agra, Cawnpore, Lucknow,\r\nAllahabad, and Benares are situated, and deprived of assistance from\r\nthence in the event of the intermediate regions being disturbed. Umballa\r\nis a somewhat important town, too, in itself, with more than twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants; it is large, and surrounded with a wall, well\r\nsupplied with water, bounded by a highly fertile district, and capable\r\nof furnishing abundant supplies to rebels, if held by them.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, awakened by these events in so many parts of India,\r\nsought to inquire whether the native newspaper press of India had\r\nfermented the anarchy. It seemed at first ridiculous to suppose that\r\nthose miserable little sheets, badly written and worse printed, and\r\nhaving a small circulation, could have contributed much to the creation\r\nof the evil. Yet many facts tended to the support of this view. It was a\r\nfrequent custom in those papers to disguise the writer’s real sentiments\r\nunder the flimsy mask of a dialogue, in which one side was uniformly\r\nmade victor. When the government was not actually abused and vilified,\r\nit was treated with ridicule, and its motives distorted. There were not\r\nmany copies of these papers printed and sold; but a kind of ubiquity was\r\nafforded to them by the practice of news-mongers or tale-bearers, who\r\nwent from hut to hut, retailing the various items of news or of comment\r\nthat had been picked up.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the tendency of the people to listen to attacks against the\r\ngovernment is now known to have been very marked among the Hindoos.\r\nPredictions of the downfall of rulers were a favourite subject with\r\nthem. Of course, such predictions would not be openly hazarded in\r\nnewspapers; but they not less surely reached the ears of the natives.\r\nThirty years ago, Sir John Malcolm spoke on this subject in the\r\nfollowing way: ‘My attention has been, during the last twenty-five\r\nyears, particularly directed to this dangerous species of secret war\r\nagainst our authority, which is always carrying on by numerous though\r\nunseen hands. The spirit is kept up by letters, by exaggerated reports,\r\nand by pretended prophecies. When the time appears favourable, from the\r\noccurrence of misfortune to our arms, from rebellion in our provinces,\r\nor from mutiny in our troops, circular-letters and proclamations are\r\ndispersed over the country with a celerity almost incredible. Such\r\ndocuments are read with avidity. The contents in most cases are the\r\nsame. The English are depicted as usurpers of low caste, and as tyrants\r\nwho have sought India with no other view but that of degrading the\r\ninhabitants and of robbing them of their wealth, while they seek to\r\nsubvert their usages and their religion. The native soldiery are always\r\nappealed to, and the advice to them is, in all instances I have met\r\nwith, the same—“_Your European tyrants are few in number_: kill them!”’\r\nThis testimony of Malcolm is especially valuable, as illustrating, and\r\nillustrated by, recent events.\r\n\r\nThe native press of India will come again under notice in a future\r\nchapter, connected with the precautionary measures adopted by the\r\ngovernor-general to lessen the power of those news-writers, whether\r\nEnglish or native, who shewed a disposition to encourage rebellion by\r\ntheir writings. News and rumours always work most actively among\r\ncredulous people—an important fact, knowing what we now know of India\r\nand its Hindoo inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhen General Anson, commander-in-chief of the forces in India, found\r\nthat the small events at Dumdum, Berhampore, and Barrackpore had grown\r\ninto great importance, and that the cartridge grievance still appeared\r\nto press on the consciences or influence the conduct of the sepoys, he\r\ndeemed it right to make an effort that should pacify the whole of the\r\nnative troops. Being at Umballa on the 19th of May, to which place he\r\nhad hastened from his sojourn at Simla, he issued a general order to the\r\nnative army, informing the troops that it had never been the intention\r\nof the government to force them to use any cartridges which could be\r\nobjected to, and that they never would be required to do so. He\r\nannounced his object in publishing the order to be to allay the\r\nexcitement which had been raised in their minds, at the same time\r\nexpressing his conviction that there was no cause for this excitement.\r\nHe had been informed, he said, that some of the sepoys who entertained\r\nthe strongest attachment and loyalty to the government, and who were\r\nready at any moment to obey its orders, were nevertheless under an\r\nimpression that their families would believe them to be in some way\r\ncontaminated by the use of the cartridges used with the Enfield rifles\r\nrecently introduced in India. He expressed regret that the positive\r\nassertions of the government officers, as to the non-existence of the\r\nobjectionable substances in the grease of the cartridges, had not been\r\ncredited by the sepoys. He solemnly assured the army, that no\r\ninterference with their caste-principles or their religion was ever\r\ncontemplated; and as solemnly pledged his word and honour that no such\r\ninterference should ever be attempted. He announced, therefore, that\r\nwhatever might be the opinions of the government concerning the\r\ncartridges, new or old, he had determined that the new rifle-cartridge,\r\nand every other of new form, should be discontinued: balled ammunition\r\nbeing made up by each regiment for its own use, by a proper\r\nestablishment maintained for the purpose. Finally, he declared his full\r\nconfidence, ‘that all in the native army will now perform their duty,\r\nfree from anxiety or care, and be prepared to stand and shed the last\r\ndrop of their blood, as they had formerly done, by the side of the\r\nBritish troops, and in defence of their country.’ The central government\r\nat Calcutta, on receipt of the news of this order having been\r\npromulgated, hastily sent to state that, in implying that new cartridges\r\n_had_ been issued, the commander-in-chief had overstepped the actual\r\nfacts of the case; nothing new in that way had been introduced\r\nthroughout the year, except to the troops at the Depôt of Musketry\r\nInstruction at Dumdum. From this fact it appears certain that the\r\ncredulity of the sepoys at the more distant stations had been imposed\r\nupon, either by their fellow-Hindoos engaged in a conspiracy, or by\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Council-house at Calcutta.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn this chapter have been discussed several subjects which, though\r\nstrange, exhibit nothing terrible or cruel. The suspicions connected\r\nwith the Oude princes, the mystery of the chupatties, the prophecies of\r\nBritish downfall, the objections to the greased cartridges, the\r\ninsubordination arising out of those objections, the incendiarism, the\r\ninflammatory tendency of the native newspaper press—all were important\r\nrather as symptoms, than for their immediate effects. But the month of\r\nMay, and the towns of Meerut and Delhi, will now introduce us to fearful\r\nproceedings—the beginning of a series of tragedies.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  _Edinburgh Review_, No. 216.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  King’s Palace, Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                 MEERUT, AND THE REBEL-FLIGHT TO DELHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first week in May marked a crisis in the affairs of British India.\r\nIt will ever remain an insoluble problem, whether the hideous atrocities\r\nthat followed might have been prevented by any different policy at that\r\ndate. The complainings and the disobedience had already presented\r\nthemselves: the murders and mutilations had not yet commenced; and there\r\nare those who believe that if a Lawrence instead of a Hewett had been at\r\nMeerut, the last spark that ignited the inflammable materials might have\r\nbeen arrested. But this is a kind of cheap wisdom, a prophecy after the\r\nevent, an easy mode of judgment, on which little reliance can be placed.\r\nTaking the British officers in India as a body, it is certain that they\r\nhad not yet learned to distrust the sepoys, whom they regarded with much\r\nprofessional admiration for their external qualifications. The Brahmins\r\nof the Northwest Provinces—a most important constituent, as we have\r\nseen, of the Bengal army—are among the finest men in the world; their\r\naverage height is at least two inches greater than that of the English\r\nsoldiers of the line regiments; and in symmetry they also take the lead.\r\nThey are unaddicted to drunkenness; they are courteous in demeanour, in\r\na degree quite beyond the English soldier; and it is now known that the\r\ncommanding officers, proud of the appearance of these men on parade, too\r\noften ignored those moral qualities without which a good soldier is an\r\nimpossible production. Whether, when the disturbances became known, the\r\ninterpretation was favourable to the sepoys, depended much on the\r\npeculiar bias in the judgment of each officer. Some believed that the\r\nnative soldier was docile, obedient, and loyal as long as his religious\r\nprejudices were respected; that he was driven to absolute frenzy by the\r\nslightest suspicion, whether well or ill grounded, of any interference\r\nwith his creed or his observances; that he had been gradually rendered\r\ndistrustful by the government policy of forbidding suttee and\r\ninfanticide, by the withholding of government contributions to Hindoo\r\ntemples and idol-ceremonies, by the authorities at Calcutta subscribing\r\nto missionary societies, and lastly by the affair of the greased\r\ncartridges; and that the sensibilities of Brahminism, thus vitally\r\noutraged, prepared the native mind for the belief that we designed to\r\nproceed by some stratagem or other to the utter and final abolition of\r\ncaste. This interpretation is wholly on the Hindoo side, and is\r\nrespectful rather than otherwise to the earnestness and honesty of the\r\nBrahmins. Other officers, however, directed their attention at once to\r\nthe Mohammedan element in the army, and authoritatively pronounced that\r\nthe Hindoo sepoys were simply dupes and tools in the hands of the\r\nMoslem. These interpreters said—We have superseded the Mohammedan power\r\nin India; we have dethroned the descendants of the great Aurungzebe and\r\nthe greater Akbar; we have subjected the mogul’s lieutenants or nawabs\r\nto our authority; we have lately extinguished the last remaining\r\nmonarchy in Northern India held by a son of the Faithful; we have\r\nreduced a conquering and dominant race to a position of inferiority and\r\nsubserviency; and hence their undying resentment, their implacable\r\nhatred, their resolute determination to try one more struggle for\r\nsupremacy, and their crafty employment of simple bigoted Hindoos as\r\nworthy instruments when sufficiently excited by dark hints and bold\r\nlies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PART OF\r\n  INDIA\r\n  Chief Scene of\r\n  THE MUTINIES OF 1857\r\n\r\n  W. & R. CHAMBERS LONDON & EDINBURGH\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut there was one fact which all these officers admitted, when it was\r\ntoo late to apply a remedy. Whether the Hindoo or the Mohammedan element\r\nwas most disturbed, all agreed that the British forces were ill placed\r\nto cope with any difficulties arising out of a revolt. Doubt might be\r\nentertained how far the disloyalty among the native troops would extend;\r\nbut there could be no doubt that European troops were scanty, just at\r\nthe places where most likely to be needed. There were somewhat over\r\ntwenty thousand Queen’s troops at the time in India, with a few others\r\non the way thither. Of these, as has been shewn in a former page, the\r\nlarger proportion was with the Bengal troops; but instead of being\r\ndistributed in the various Bengal and Oude provinces, they were rather\r\nlargely posted at two extreme points, certainly not less than two\r\nthousand miles apart—on the Afghan frontier of the Punjaub, and on the\r\nBurmese frontier of Pegu. Four regiments of the Queen’s army were\r\nguarding the newly annexed country of the Punjaub, while three others\r\nwere similarly holding the recent conquests in Pegu. What was the\r\nconsequence, in relation to the twelve hundred miles between Calcutta\r\nand the Sutlej? An almost complete denudation of European troops: a\r\nsurrendering of most of the strongholds to the mercy of the sepoys. Only\r\none European regiment at Lucknow, and none other in the whole of Oude;\r\ntwo at Meerut, one at Agra, one at Dinapoor, and one at Calcutta—none at\r\nCawnpore or Allahabad. The two great native capitals of India—Delhi, of\r\nthe Mohammedans: Benares, of the Hindoos—had not one European regiment\r\nin them. Indeed, earlier in the year, Calcutta itself had none; but the\r\nauthorities, as narrated in the last chapter, became so uneasy at the\r\nthought of being without European supporters at the seat of government,\r\nthat they sent to Rangoon in Pegu for one of the Queen’s regiments, and\r\ndid not venture upon the Barrackpore disbandments until this regiment\r\nhad arrived. The lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces,\r\ncomprising Delhi and the surrounding regions, had in his whole\r\ngovernment only three European regiments, and a sepoy army, soon found\r\nto be faithless. Oude had a considerable native force; but Bengal proper\r\nhad very few troops of any kind. In short, the Company’s forces were\r\nalmost as unfavourably distributed as they could possibly be, to stem\r\nthe Revolt at its beginning; and there may not be much hazard in\r\nassuming that the natives were as well acquainted with this fact as the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find it useful to bear in mind, that the unfavourable\r\nsymptoms during the first four months of the year did not present\r\nthemselves in those districts which were afterwards associated with such\r\nterrible deeds. Meerut and Delhi, Dinapoor and Ghazeepore, Benares and\r\nAllahabad, Cawnpore and Lucknow, Mirzapore and Agra—these were not in\r\nopen disaffection during the period under notice, however much the\r\nelements for a storm may have been gathering. It was at Dumdum,\r\nBarrackpore, and Berhampore, on the Hoogly branch of the Lower\r\nGanges—and at Umballa near the Sutlej, separated from them by more than\r\na thousand miles—that the insubordination was chiefly shewn. Now,\r\nhowever, the scene shifts to the Jumna and the Upper Ganges—with which\r\nit will be well to become familiar by means of maps. Especially must the\r\npositions of Meerut and Delhi be attended to, in relation to the events\r\ndetailed in this and the next following chapters.\r\n\r\nMeerut, as a district, is a part of the Doab or delta enclosed between\r\nthe rivers Ganges and Jumna; but it is Meerut the town with which this\r\nnarrative is concerned. It came into the possession of the British in\r\n1836, and is now included in the territories of Northwest Bengal. The\r\ntown, standing on the small river Kalee Nuddee, is about equidistant\r\nfrom the Ganges and the Jumna, twenty-five or thirty miles from each,\r\nand nearly nine hundred miles from Calcutta. Meerut is interesting to\r\nthe Indian antiquary in possessing some good architectural remains of\r\nmosques and pagodas; and to the European residents, in possessing one of\r\nthe largest and finest Christian churches in India, capable of\r\naccommodating three thousand persons, and provided with a good organ;\r\nbut the houses of the natives are wretchedly built, and the streets\r\nnarrow and dirty, as in most oriental towns. It is as a military\r\nstation, however, that Meerut is most important. The cantonment is two\r\nmiles north of the town, and is divided into two portions by a small\r\nbranch of the river, over which two bridges have been thrown. The\r\nnorthern half of the cantonment contains lines for the accommodation of\r\na brigade of horse-artillery, a European cavalry corps, and a regiment\r\nof European infantry—separated respectively by intervals of several\r\nhundred yards. In front of these is a fine parade-ground, a mile in\r\nwidth and four miles in length, having ample space for field-battery\r\npractice and the manœuvres of horse-artillery; with a heavy battery on\r\nthe extreme right. Overlooking the parade are the barracks, with\r\nstables, hospitals, riding-schools, canteens, and other military\r\noffices. The barracks consist of a series of separate brick-built\r\nlow-roofed structures, each comprising one large and lofty room,\r\nsurrounded by a spacious enclosed verandah, divided into apartments for\r\nthe non-commissioned officers and the families of married men. Behind\r\nthe barracks, in a continued line three deep, are the bungalows or\r\nlodges of the officers, each surrounded by a garden about a hundred\r\nyards square. The opposite or southern half of the cantonment is mainly\r\noccupied by the huts (not barracks) for native troops, and by the\r\ndetached bungalows for the officers who command them. This description,\r\napplicable in some degree to many parts of India, may assist in\r\nconveying an idea of the manner in which the European officers have\r\nusually been lodged at the cantonments—in detached bungalows at no great\r\ndistance from the huts of the native troops: it may render a little more\r\nintelligible some of the details of the fearful tragedies about to be\r\nnarrated. Before the Revolt, it was customary to keep at Meerut a\r\nregiment of European cavalry, a regiment of European infantry, one of\r\nnative cavalry, and three of native infantry, besides horse and foot\r\nartillery. The station is a particularly healthy one; and, both\r\npolitically and geographically, is an important place to the British\r\nrulers of India.\r\n\r\nMeerut, in some respects, was one of the last towns in which the mutiny\r\nmight have been expected to commence; for there was no other place in\r\nthe Northwest Provinces containing at the time so many English troops.\r\nThere were the 60th (Rifle) regiment, 1000 strong; the 6th Dragoon\r\nGuards or Carabineers, 600 strong (but not fully mounted); a troop of\r\nhorse-artillery; and 500 artillery recruits—altogether about 2200 men,\r\nwith a full complement of officers. The native troops were but little\r\nmore numerous: comprising the 3d Bengal cavalry, and the 11th and 20th\r\nBengal infantry. In such a relative state of the European and native\r\nforces, no one for an instant would have admitted the probability of a\r\nrevolt being successful at such a time and place.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not until the second week in May that those events took\r\nplace which carried grief and mourning into so many families, Meerut\r\nbegan its troubles in the latter part of the preceding month. The troops\r\nat this station had not been inattentive to the events transpiring in\r\nLower Bengal; they knew all the rumours concerning the greased\r\ncartridges; they had been duped into a belief in the truth of those\r\nrumours; and, moreover, emissaries had been at work among them,\r\ninstilling into their minds another preposterous notion—that the\r\ngovernment had plotted to take away their caste and insult their\r\nreligion, by causing the pulverised bones of bullocks to be mixed up\r\nwith the flour sold in the public markets or bazaars. Major-general\r\nHewett, commanding the military division of which Meerut was the chief\r\nstation, sought by every means to eradicate from the minds of the men\r\nthese absurd and pernicious ideas; he pointed out how little the\r\ngovernment had to gain by such a course, how contrary it would be to the\r\npolicy adopted during a hundred years, and how improbable was the whole\r\nrumour. He failed, however, in his appeal to the good sense of the men;\r\nand equally did the European officers of the native regiments fail: the\r\nsepoys or infantry, the sowars or cavalry, alike continued in a\r\ndistrustful and suspicious state. Many British officers accustomed to\r\nIndian troops aver that these men had been rendered more insubordinate\r\nthan ever by the leniency of the proceedings at Barrackpore and\r\nBerhampore; that disbandment was not a sufficiently severe punishment\r\nfor the offences committed at those places; that the delay in the\r\ndisbanding was injurious, as denoting irresolution on the part of the\r\nauthorities at Calcutta; and that the native troops in other places had\r\nbegun to imbibe an opinion that the government were afraid of them. But\r\nwhatever be the amount of truth in this mode of interpretation, certain\r\nit is that the troops at Meerut evinced a mutinous spirit that caused\r\ngreat uneasiness to their commanders. Bungalows and houses were set on\r\nfire, no one knew by whom; officers were not saluted as had been their\r\nwont; and whispers went about that the men intended to adopt a bold\r\ncourse in reference to the greased cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe military authorities on the spot resolved to put this matter to the\r\ntest. On the 23d of April, Colonel Smyth, the English commander of the\r\n3d regiment of native Bengal cavalry, ordered a parade of the\r\nskirmishers of his regiment with carabines on the following morning, to\r\nshew them the newly introduced mode of adjusting their cartridges\r\nwithout biting, hoping and believing that they would be gratified by\r\nthis indication of the willingness of the government to consult their\r\nfeelings in the matter. He caused the havildar-major and the\r\nhavildar-major’s orderly to come to his house, to shew them how it was\r\nto be done; and the orderly fired off a carabine under the new system.\r\nAt night, however, uneasiness was occasioned by the burning down of the\r\norderly’s tent, and of a horse-hospital close to the magazine. Although\r\nthis act of incendiarism looked ominous, the colonel nevertheless\r\ndetermined to carry out his object on the morrow. Accordingly, on the\r\nmorning of the 24th, the troops assembled on parade; and the\r\nhavildar-major fired off one cartridge to shew them how it was to be\r\ndone. The men demurred, however, to the reception of the cartridges,\r\nthough the same in kind as had been used by them during a long period,\r\nand _not_ the new cartridges. An investigation ensued, which was\r\nconducted on the 25th by Major Harrison, deputy-judge advocate. On being\r\nexamined, the men admitted that they could discern nothing impure in the\r\ncomposition or glazing of the paper; but added that they had _heard_ it\r\nwas unclean, and believed it to be so. The inquiry, after a few\r\nconciliatory observations on the part of the judge, ended in the men\r\nexpressing contrition for their obstinacy, and promising a ready\r\nobedience in the use of the cartridges whenever called upon.\r\n\r\nA hope was now entertained that the difficulties had been smoothed away;\r\nbut this hope proved to be fallacious. Major-general Hewett, wishing to\r\nput an end to the stupid prejudice, and to settle at once all doubts as\r\nto the obedience of the men, ordered a parade of the 3d cavalry for the\r\nmorning of the 6th of May. On the evening of the 5th, preparatory to the\r\nparade, cartridges were given out to the men, the same in quality as\r\nthose which had been freely in use during many years. Eighty-five of the\r\nsowars or troopers—either still incredulous on the grease-question, or\r\nresolved to mutiny whether with just cause or not—positively refused to\r\nreceive the cartridges. This conduct, of course, could not be\r\noverlooked; the men were taken into custody, and tried by a\r\ncourt-martial; they were found guilty of a grave military offence, and\r\nwere committed to imprisonment with hard labour, for periods varying\r\nfrom six to ten years. The governor-general, seeing the necessity of\r\npromptitude at this crisis, had just sent orders to the military\r\nstations that the judgments of all court-martials should be put in force\r\ninstantly, as a means of impressing the troops with the seriousness of\r\ntheir position; and Major-general Hewett, acting on these instructions,\r\nproceeded on the 9th to enforce the sentence of the court-martial. A\r\nEuropean guard of 60th Rifles and Carabiniers was placed over the\r\nconvicted men; and at daybreak the whole military force at the station\r\nwas assembled on the rifle parade-ground. All were there—the European\r\n60th, Carabiniers, and artillery—the native 3d, 11th, and 20th. The\r\nEuropean cannon, carbines, and rifles were loaded, to prepare for any\r\nemergency. The eighty-five mutineers of the 3d native cavalry were\r\nmarched upon the ground; they were stripped of their uniforms and\r\naccoutrements; they were shackled with irons riveted on by the\r\narmourers. While this was being done, very meaning looks were exchanged\r\nbetween the culprits and the other sowars of the same regiment—the\r\nformer looking reproachfully at the latter, while the latter appeared\r\ngloomy and crestfallen: it was evident that the unconvicted men had\r\npromised to resist and prevent the infliction of the degrading\r\npunishment on their convicted associates; but it was equally evident\r\nthat the presence of so many armed European troops would have rendered\r\nany attempt at rescue worse than useless. The manacles having been\r\nadjusted, the men were marched off to jail. And herein a grave mistake\r\nappears to have been committed. Instead of keeping a watchful eye over\r\nthese men at such a perilous time, and retaining them under a guard of\r\nEuropean troops until the excitement had blown over, they were sent to\r\nthe common jail of Meerut, two miles distant from the cantonment, and\r\nthere handed over to the police or ordinary civil power of the town. How\r\ndisastrous was the result of this course of proceeding, we shall\r\npresently see. The native troops, when the culprits had been removed\r\nfrom the parade-ground, returned to their lines furious with\r\nindignation—at least the 3d cavalry were so, and they gradually brought\r\nover the infantry to share in their indignant feelings. It was a\r\ndegrading punishment, unquestionably: whether the remainder of the\r\nnative troops at the station would be terrified or exasperated by it,\r\nwas just the problem which remained to be solved. All the afternoon and\r\nevening of that day were the men brooding and whispering, plotting and\r\nplanning. Unfortunately, the European officers of native regiments were\r\naccustomed to mix so seldom with their men, that they knew little of\r\nwhat occurred except on parade-ground: this plotting was only known by\r\nits fruits. Judged by subsequent events, it appears probable that the\r\nnative troops sent emissaries to Delhi, forty miles distant, to announce\r\nwhat had occurred, and to plan an open revolt. The prime plotters were\r\nthe 3d; the 20th were nearly as eager; but the 11th, newly arrived at\r\nMeerut, held back for some time, although they did not betray the rest.\r\n\r\nLittle did the European inhabitants, their wives and their children, at\r\nMeerut, dream what was in store for them on Sunday the 10th of May—a day\r\nof peace in the eyes of Christians. It was on the 9th that the sentence\r\nof the court-martial on the eighty-five mutineers was enforced: it was\r\non the 10th that the Revolt, in its larger sense, began. Whether these\r\ntwo events stood to each other in the relation of cause and effect, is a\r\nquestion not easily to be answered; but it may safely be asserted that\r\nthe Revolt would not have resulted from the punishment unless the men\r\nhad been generally in a state of disaffection. The Sunday opened as most\r\nSundays open in India, quiet and uneventful, and remained so till\r\nevening. Ladies and families were then going to evening-service at the\r\nchurch. Some of them passed the mess-room of the 3d cavalry, and there\r\nsaw servants looking towards the road leading to the native infantry\r\nlines. Something was evidently wrong. On inquiry it appeared that a\r\nmutiny had broken out, and that fighting was going on in the bazaar.\r\nCrowds of armed men soon hurried that way; and families who had been on\r\nthe route to church, drove or walked back in haste to escape danger. So\r\nit was on all sides: whoever on that evening ventured forth, found that\r\nblood-shedding instead of church-service would fill their thoughts. The\r\nRev. Mr Smyth, chaplain of Meerut, while driving to church for the seven\r\no’clock service, met two of the 60th Rifles covered with blood; and on\r\nreaching the church, he saw buggies and carriages driving away in great\r\nconfusion, and a body of people pointing to a column of fire and smoke\r\nin the direction of the city: frequent shots were heard, amid the cries\r\nof a large mob. In another direction the wife of an officer in the 3d\r\ncavalry, going like other Europeans to church, and startled like them by\r\nsounds of violence, saw a private of the Carabiniers unarmed, and\r\nrunning for very life from several men armed with _latthies_ or long\r\nsticks: she stopped her carriage and took in the English soldier; but\r\nthe men continued to strike at him until the vehicle rolled away. This\r\nlady, on reaching her bungalow in haste and dismay, was the first to\r\ngive notice to her husband that something was wrong among the native\r\ntroops: he instantly started off on foot to the lines, without waiting\r\nfor his horse. In another part of the scene, an English officer of the\r\n11th native infantry, at about six o’clock on that evening, while in his\r\nbungalow preparing for a ride with Colonel Finnis of the same regiment,\r\nhad his attention attracted to his servants, and those in the bungalows\r\nof other officers, going down towards the front of the several compounds\r\nor gardens, and looking steadily into the lines or cantonment of the\r\nregiment. He heard a buzzing, murmuring noise, which at first he deemed\r\nof no consequence; but as it continued and increased, he hastily\r\nfinished dressing and went out. Scarcely had he reached his gate, when\r\nhe heard the sound of firearms, which his practised ear at once told him\r\nwere loaded with ball-cartridge. An European non-commissioned officer\r\ncame running towards him, with others, and exclaimed: ‘For God’s sake,\r\nsir, leave! Return to your bungalow, change that dress, and fly!’\r\nShortly afterwards shots came into his own compound; and the\r\nhavildar-major of the 11th, rushing terrified and breathless into the\r\nbungalow, exclaimed: ‘Fly, sahib—fly at once! the regiments are in open\r\nmutiny, and firing on their officers; and Colonel Finnis has just been\r\nshot in my arms!’ The officer mounted and started off—at first\r\nleisurely—because ‘a Briton does not like actually running away under\r\nany circumstances;’ but when the havildar-major (native sergeant-major)\r\nadvised him to gallop off to the European cavalry lines, he saw that the\r\nsuggestion was good; and he immediately started—over a rugged and barren\r\nplain, cut up by nullahs and ravines—towards the lines of the Queen’s\r\nCarabiniers.\r\n\r\nWhen these, and a dozen similar mysteries, came to receive their\r\nsolution, it was found that a mutiny had indeed broken out. Shortly\r\nbefore five o’clock on that Sunday afternoon, the men of the 3d native\r\ncavalry, and of the 20th native infantry, rushed out of their lines on a\r\ngiven signal, and proceeded to the lines of the 11th native infantry,\r\nall fully armed. After a little hesitation, their comrades joined them;\r\nand then all three regiments proceeded to open acts of violence. Colonel\r\nFinnis of the 11th, the moment he heard of this startling proceeding,\r\nrode to the parade-ground, harangued the men, and endeavoured to induce\r\nthem to return to their duty. Instead of listening to him, the men of\r\nthe 20th fired a volley, and he fell, riddled with bullets—the first\r\nvictim of the Indian Revolt. The other officers present, feeling that\r\ntheir remaining longer on the ground would effect no good, escaped.\r\nWhether a daring man might have stemmed the torrent, cannot now be told:\r\nno one attempted it after Finnis’s death; his brother-officers were\r\nallowed to escape to the lines of the artillery and the Carabiniers, on\r\nthe other side of the encampment. So far as the accounts are\r\nintelligible, the first shots appear to have been fired by the 20th, the\r\n11th joining afterwards in the violence.\r\n\r\nWhile the infantry were thus engaged, the ominous but natural step was\r\ntaken by the 3d cavalry of releasing their eighty-five imprisoned\r\ncompanions—ominous, because those men, enraged at their incarceration,\r\nwould join in the disorder with heated blood and excited passions. The\r\ntroopers proceeded to the jail, set their companions free, armed them,\r\nand invited them to share in the mutiny. All this was evidently\r\npreconcerted; for native smiths were at hand to strike off the manacles.\r\nYelling and threatening, the whole returned to the lines; and then\r\ncommenced the direful mischief. Within a very short time, all three\r\nregiments became busily engaged in burning and murdering. But this was\r\nnot all; when the eighty-five troopers were liberated, the other\r\nprisoners in the jail, _twelve hundred_ in number, were set at liberty\r\nat the same time; and then the scum of Indian society entered into the\r\nscenes of violence with demoniac relish, adding tenfold to the horrors\r\nperpetrated by the sepoys and sowars. The mutineers and the ruffians set\r\nfire to nearly all the bungalows of the native lines, and to the\r\ngovernment establishments near at hand, murdering, as they went, the\r\nEuropeans who fell in their way. The bungalows being mostly thatched\r\nwith straw, the destruction was very rapid; the cowardly assailants,\r\nsetting fire to the thatch, waited till the flames had driven out the\r\ninmates of the bungalow, and then fell upon them as assassins. The\r\nconflagrations were accompanied by the yells of the rioters and the\r\nshrieks of the sufferers, rendered more terrible by the approach of\r\ndarkness. The rabble of the bazaar, and the lowest portion of the\r\npopulation generally, as if intoxicated by release from the dread of\r\nEuropeans, now joined the mutineers and the released felons, and the\r\nhorrors thickened. On all sides shot up columns of flame and smoke; on\r\nall sides were heard the shouts and curses of some, the cries and\r\nlamentations of others. One redeeming feature—there may have been\r\nothers—marked these proceedings; the sepoys of the 11th, in most\r\ninstances, connived at the escape of their officers—nay, strove\r\nearnestly to save them: it was not by men of his own regiment that poor\r\nColonel Finnis had been shot down.\r\n\r\nA few individual examples, drawn from the simple but painful narratives\r\nof eye-witnesses, will shew in what way misery and death were brought\r\ninto homes where the peace of a Christian Sabbath had reigned only a few\r\nhours before.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr Smyth, after returning hurriedly from the church where he\r\nhad intended to perform divine service, took shelter in the house of an\r\nofficer of the artillery in the English lines. Shots had just before\r\nbeen aimed at that officer and his wife by eight or ten sepoys of the\r\nartillery depôt or school, while standing at the very gate of their\r\ncompound; and yet Mr Smyth himself was saluted respectfully by several\r\nsepoys during his hurried retreat—shewing the strange mixture of\r\ndeference and ferocity exhibited by these misguided men. Presently\r\nafterwards another shot was heard, a horse was seen galloping past with\r\na buggy; and it was soon found that the surgeon and the veterinary\r\nsurgeon of the 3d cavalry had been wounded and mutilated. The clergyman\r\nescaped unhurt, to learn and to mourn over the events transpiring in\r\nother parts of the town and cantonment.\r\n\r\nA captain of horse, the husband of the lady mentioned in a former\r\nparagraph, hastened on the first news from his bungalow to the lines of\r\nthe 3d cavalry, in which he commanded a troop. He was respected by his\r\nmen, who offered him no hurt, and who seemed to hesitate for a time\r\nwhether to join the rest in mutiny or not. Soon, however, the mania\r\ninfected them; and the captain, seeing the jail opened and the prisoners\r\nliberated, hastened back. The road from the town to the cantonment was\r\nin an uproar; the infantry and the bazaar-people were in crowds, armed\r\nand firing; and he saw one of the miscreant troopers stab to death an\r\nEnglishwoman, the wife of the Meerut hotel-keeper, as she passed. Soon a\r\nball whizzed past his own car, and he saw one of his own troopers aiming\r\nat him; he shouted: ‘Was that meant for me?’ ‘Yes,’ was the reply; ‘I\r\nwill have your blood!’ The captain detected this man as one whom he had\r\nbeen obliged to punish for carelessness and disobedience. The man fired\r\nagain, but again missed his aim; and although the other troopers did not\r\njoin in this, they made no attempt to check or seize the assailant. The\r\ncaptain, abandoned gradually by all but a very few troopers, at length\r\nreached the European lines, where he took part in the proceedings\r\nafterwards adopted. Meanwhile the poor wife had passed two hours of\r\nterrible suspense. Believing at first that the carabinier whom she had\r\nsaved might have been the main object of attack, she hid his uniform,\r\ndressed him in a coat of her husband’s, and bade him sit with herself\r\nand family, for mutual safety. Out of doors she heard shots and shouts,\r\nand saw houses burning. In the next bungalow, speedily fired, was the\r\nwife of an adjutant lately arrived from England; she was entreated to\r\ncome over for shelter, but not arriving, servants were sent in to seek\r\nher. A horrid sight met them: the hapless lady lay on the floor in a\r\npool of blood, dead, and mutilated in a way that the pen refuses to\r\ndescribe. The noises and flames increased; eight or ten flaming\r\nbungalows were in sight at once; and many a struggle took place between\r\nthe captain’s servants and the mutineers, during which it was quite\r\nuncertain whether one more burning, one more massacre, would ensue.\r\nTroopers rushed into the bungalow, endeavouring to fire it; while\r\nothers, with a lingering affection towards the family of their officer,\r\nprevented them. The husband arrived, in speechless agony concerning the\r\nsafety of those dear to him. Wrapped in black stable-blankets, to hide\r\ntheir light dresses, all left the house amid a glare of flame from\r\nneighbouring buildings, and hid under trees in the garden; whence they\r\nsped to a small ruin near at hand, where, throughout the remainder of\r\nthe night, they crouched listening to the noises without. Bands of armed\r\nmen passed in and out of the bungalow compound during the night, and\r\nwere only prevented from prosecuting a search, by an assurance from the\r\ndomestics that the officer’s family had effected their escape. When\r\nmorning came, the (now) houseless Europeans, with about twenty troopers\r\nwho remained faithful to the last—though agitated by strange waverings\r\nand irresolution—left the place, taking with them such few clothes and\r\ntrinkets as could be hastily collected, and started off for the\r\nCarabiniers’ lines, passing on their way the smouldering ruins of many\r\nbungalows and public buildings.\r\n\r\nHowsoever the narratives might vary in details, in substance they were\r\nall alike; they spoke of a night of burning, slaughter, and dismay.\r\nWherever there was a bungalow, the European inhabitants of which did not\r\nsucceed in escaping to the English lines, there was murder perpetrated.\r\nThe escape of Mr Greathed, civil commissioner for Meerut, was a narrow\r\none. His house—flat-roofed, as it fortunately happened—was one of the\r\nfirst attacked by the mutineers: at the first alarm, Mr and Mrs Greathed\r\nfled to the roof; thither, on the least intimation from any of the\r\nservants, the miscreants would have followed them; but the servants\r\npersisted that the family had departed; and the assailants, after\r\nsearching every room in the house, took their departure. One officer\r\nafter another, as he rushed from his bungalow to call his men back to\r\ntheir allegiance, was shot down; and wherever the mutineers and their\r\nruffian companions brought murder into a house, they mingled with the\r\nmurder a degree of barbarity quite appalling and unexpected. There were\r\na few Europeans in the town and vicinity not connected with the military\r\ndepartment; and these, unless they effected their escape, were treated\r\nlike the rest; rank, age, and sex were equally disregarded—or, if sex\r\nmade any difference, women, gentle English women, were treated more\r\nruthlessly than men. An officer of the 20th, living in his bungalow with\r\nhis wife and two children, was sought out by the ruffians: the father\r\nand mother were killed; but a faithful ayah snatched up the two children\r\nand carried them off to a place of safety—the poor innocents never again\r\nsaw their parents alive. An English sergeant was living with his wife\r\nand six children beyond the limits of the cantonment; he and three of\r\nhis little ones were massacred in a way that must for very shame be left\r\nuntold: the mother, with the other three, all bleeding and mutilated,\r\nmanaged to crawl to the European lines about midnight.\r\n\r\nWith what inexpressible astonishment were the narratives of these deeds\r\nheard and perused! Men who had been in India, or were familiar with\r\nIndian affairs, knew that the sepoys had before risen in mutiny, and had\r\nshot their officers; but it was something strange to them, a terrible\r\nnovelty, that tender women and little children—injuring none, and\r\nthrowing a halo of refinement around all—should be so vilely treated as\r\nto render death a relief. The contrast to all that was considered\r\ncharacteristic of the Hindoo was so great, that to this day it remains\r\nto many an Indian veteran a horrid enigma—a mystery insoluble even if\r\nhis heart-sickness would lead him to the attempt. Be it remembered that\r\nfor a whole century the natives had been largely trusted in the\r\nrelations of social life; and had well justified that trust. Many an\r\nEnglish lady (it has been observed by an eloquent reviewer, whose words\r\nwe have before quoted) has travelled from one end of the country to the\r\nother—along desert roads, through thick jungles, or on vast solitary\r\nrivers—miles and miles away from the companionship of white men, without\r\nthe slightest anxiety. Her native servants, Mohammedans and Hindoos,\r\nwere her protectors; and she was as safe in such custody as in an\r\nEnglish home. Her slightest caprice was as a law to her attendants.\r\nThese swarthy bearded men, ready at her beck, ever treated her with the\r\nmost delicate respect, ever appeared to bear about with them a\r\nchivalrous sense of the sacredness of their charge. Not a word or a\r\ngesture ever alarmed her modesty or excited her fear; and her husband,\r\nfather, brother never hesitated to confide her to such guardianship. It\r\nwas in the year 1857 that the charm of this delicate fidelity was first\r\nbroken; and broken so appallingly, that men were long incredulous that\r\nsuch things could be.\r\n\r\nBut the children, the sabred and mangled little ones—that these could be\r\nso treated by the same natives, was more astounding to the Anglo-Indians\r\nthan even the treatment of the women. ‘Few of our countrymen have ever\r\nreturned from India without deploring the loss of their native servants.\r\nIn the nursery they are, perhaps, more missed than in any other part of\r\nthe establishment. There are, doubtless, hundreds of English parents in\r\nthis country who remember with feelings of kindliness and gratitude the\r\n_nusery_ bearers, or male nurses, who attended their children. The\r\npatience, the gentleness, the tenderness with which these white-robed\r\nswarthy Indians attend the little children of their European masters,\r\nsurpass even the love of women. You may see them sitting for hour after\r\nhour, with their little infantine charges, amusing them with toys,\r\nfanning them when they slumber, brushing away the flies, or pacing the\r\nverandah with the little ones in their arms, droning the low monotonous\r\nlullaby which charms them to sleep; and all this without a shadow on the\r\nbrow, without a gesture of impatience, without a single petulant word.\r\nNo matter how peevish, how wayward, how unreasonable, how exacting the\r\nchild may be, the native bearer only smiles, shews his white teeth, or\r\nshakes his black locks, giving back a word of endearment in reply to\r\nyoung master’s imperious discontent. In the sick-room, doubly gentle and\r\ndoubly patient, his noiseless ministrations are continued through long\r\ndays, often through long nights, as though hunger and weariness were\r\nhuman frailties to be cast off at such a time. It is little to say that\r\nthese poor hirelings often love their master’s children with greater\r\ntenderness than their own. Parted from their little charges, they may\r\noften be seen weeping like children themselves; and have been known, in\r\nafter-years, to travel hundreds of miles to see the brave young ensign\r\nor the blooming maiden whom they once dandled in their arms.’ These men,\r\nit is true, were domestic servants, not sepoys or soldiers fighting in\r\nthe army of the Company; but it is equally true that the British\r\nofficers, almost without exception, trusted implicitly to the sepoys who\r\nacted as orderlies or servants to them; and that those orderlies shewed\r\nthemselves worthy of the trust, by their scrupulous respect to the\r\nladies of each household, and their tender affection for the little ones\r\nborn under the roof of the bungalow. Hence the mingled wonderment and\r\ngrief when fiend-like cruelties suddenly destroyed the charm of this\r\nreliance.\r\n\r\nAllowing the veil to remain, at present, drawn over still greater\r\nhorrors in other places, it must be admitted that the principal\r\natrocities at Meerut were perpetrated by the twelve hundred miscreants\r\nliberated from the jail, aided by the general rabble of the town. The\r\nnative troops had something in their thoughts besides firing bungalows\r\nand murdering a few Europeans; they had arranged some sort of plot with\r\nthe native troops of Delhi; and they set out in a body for that city\r\nlong before the deplorable transactions at Meerut had ceased. Those\r\nscenes continued more or less throughout the night; officers and their\r\nwives, parents and their children, were not relieved from the agony of\r\nsuspense before morning broke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Laboratory at Meerut.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe number massacred at Meerut on this evening and night was not so\r\nlarge as the excited feelings of the survivors led them to imply; but it\r\nwas large to them; for it told of a whole cluster of happy homes\r\nsuddenly broken up, of bungalows reduced to ashes, of bleeding corpses\r\nbrought in one by one, of children rendered fatherless, of property\r\nconsumed, of hopes blasted, of confidence destroyed. The European\r\nsoldiers, as will presently be seen, soon obtained the mastery so far as\r\nMeerut was concerned; but the surviving women and children had still\r\nmany hours, many days, of discomfort and misery to bear. The School of\r\nInstruction near the artillery laboratory became the place of shelter\r\nfor most of them; and this place was much crowded. How mournfully does\r\nit tell of large families rendered homeless to read thus: ‘We are in a\r\nsmall house at one end of the place, which consists of one large room\r\nand verandah rooms all round; and in this miserable shed—for we can\r\nscarcely call it anything else—there are no less than forty-one\r\nsouls’—then are named thirteen members of one family, ten of another,\r\nthree other families of four each, and two others of three each—‘besides\r\nhaving in our verandah room the post-office, and arranging at present a\r\nsmall room adjoining the post-office as the telegraph-office.’ Some of\r\nthe houseless officers and their families found temporary homes in the\r\nsergeants’ rooms of the European lines; space was found for all,\r\nalthough amid much confusion; and one of the refugees writes of ‘a crowd\r\nof helpless babies’ that added to the misery of the scene. Adverting to\r\nothers like herself, she remarks: ‘Ladies who were mere formal\r\nacquaintances now wring each other’s hands with intense sympathy; what a\r\nlook there was when we first assembled here!—all of us had stared death\r\nin the face.’\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to a question which has probably presented itself more\r\nthan once to the mind of the reader during the perusal of these sad\r\ndetails—What were the twenty-two hundred European troops doing while the\r\nthree native regiments were imbuing their hands in the blood of innocent\r\nwomen and children? Could not they have intervened to prevent the\r\natrocities? It must be borne in mind that these fine English troops, the\r\nCarabiniers and 60th Rifles, with artillery, were nearly equal in number\r\nto the rebels; and that, if quickly moved, they would have been a match\r\nfor five or ten times their number. Whether or not they _were_ quickly\r\nmoved, is just the question at issue. Major-general Hewett’s dispatch to\r\nthe adjutant-general thus describes the course adopted as soon as the\r\noutbreak became known to him: ‘The artillery, Carabiniers, and 60th\r\nRifles were got under arms; but by the time we reached the native\r\ninfantry parade-ground, it was too dark to act with efficiency in that\r\ndirection; consequently, the troops retired to the north of the nullah,\r\nso as to cover the barracks and officers’ lines of the artillery,\r\nCarabiniers, and 60th Rifles; which were, with the exception of one\r\nhouse, preserved; though the insurgents—for I believe the mutineers had\r\nby that time retired by the Allygurh and Delhi roads—burned the vacant\r\nSapper and Miner lines.’\r\n\r\nOne thing is quite certain—the mutineers were not pursued: they were\r\nallowed to go to Delhi, there to raise the standard of rebellion in a\r\nstill more alarming way. The Carabiniers, it is true, were deficient in\r\nhorses to join in pursuit; but this might assuredly have been obviated\r\nby precautionary arrangements during the many days on which the 3d\r\nnative cavalry had shewn symptoms of insubordination. An officer of the\r\n11th native infantry, who narrowly escaped death in his gallop to the\r\nEuropean cantonment, accompanied the Queen’s regiments to the scene of\r\nanarchy; but there is evidence that he considered the movements somewhat\r\ntardy. ‘It took us a long time, in my opinion,’ he says, ‘to get ready,\r\nand it was dark before the Carabiniers were prepared to start in a\r\nbody.’ In the latitude of Meerut, we may remark, in the second week in\r\nMay, darkness can hardly come on until near seven o’clock, whereas the\r\noutbreak occurred two hours earlier. He continues: ‘When the Carabiniers\r\nwere mounted, we rode off at a brisk trot, through clouds of suffocating\r\ndust, and darkness, in an easterly direction, and along a narrow\r\nroad—_not advancing in the direction of the conflagration_, but, on the\r\ncontrary, leaving it behind on our right rear. In this way we proceeded\r\nfor some two or three miles, to my no small surprise, when suddenly the\r\n“halt” was sounded, and we faced about, retracing our steps, and verging\r\noff to our left. Approaching the conflagration, we debouched on the left\r\nrear of the native infantry lines, which of course were all in a blaze.\r\nSkirting along behind these lines, we turned them at the western end,\r\nand wheeling up to the left, came upon the 11th parade-ground, where, at\r\na little distance, we found the horse-artillery and her Majesty’s 60th\r\nRifles. It appears that the three regiments of mutineers had by this\r\ntime commenced dropping off to the westward to the Delhi road, for here\r\nsome firing took place between them and the Rifles; and presently the\r\nhorse-artillery, coming to the front and unlimbering, opened upon a\r\ncopse or wood in which they had apparently found cover, with heavy\r\ndischarges of grape and canister, which rattled among the trees; and all\r\nwas silent again. The horse-artillery now limbered up again, and wheeled\r\nround; and here I joined them, having lost the Carabiniers in the\r\ndarkness. By this time, however, the moon arose. The horse-artillery\r\ncolumn, with Rifles at its head, moving across the parade-ground, we\r\nentered the long street turning from the southward behind the light\r\ncavalry lines. There it was that the extent and particulars of the\r\nconflagration first became visible; and, passing the burning bungalow of\r\nthe adjutant of the 11th native infantry, we proceeded along the\r\nstraight road or street, flanked on both sides with flaming and crashing\r\nhouses in all stages of combustion and ruin; the Rifles occasionally\r\nfiring volleys as we proceeded. It was by this time past ten o’clock;\r\nand having made the entire circuit of the lines, we passed up to the\r\neast of them, and, joined by the Carabiniers and Rifles, bivouacked for\r\nthe night.’\r\n\r\nCollating various accounts of this evening’s events, it becomes evident\r\nthat the military movements of the Europeans were anything but prompt.\r\nEven if the two regiments and the artillery could not have reached the\r\nscene of tumult before dark—a supposition not at all borne out—still it\r\nseems strange that all should have ‘bivouacked for the night’ at the\r\nvery time when three mutinous native regiments were on the way to Delhi.\r\nHasty critics, as is usual in such circumstances, at once condemned the\r\nmilitary commander at Meerut; and an ex-governor-general, dwelling, in\r\nhis place in the House of Lords, on the occurrences in India, spoke in a\r\ncontemptuous tone of ‘an unknown man named Hewett’ as one whose\r\nmisconduct had allowed the rebel troops to escape from Meerut to Delhi.\r\nIt was hard for a soldier who had served for forty years in India,\r\nwithout once returning to his native country, to find contumely thus\r\nhurled at him; it is one of the bitter things to which public men are\r\nsubjected, not only from anonymous writers, but from other public men\r\nwhose names carry authority with them. A near relation of the\r\nmajor-general afterwards took up his defence, urging that it might have\r\nbeen unwise policy to send the only European troops in pursuit to Delhi,\r\nat a time when the magazines and stores at Meerut required so much\r\nattention. The defence may possibly be insufficient; but the history of\r\nthe Crimean war had shewn how hastily Lord Raglan had been accused of\r\noffences, things committed and things omitted, for which he was\r\nafterwards known not to have been responsible; and this experience ought\r\nto have suggested caution to assailants, especially remembering how long\r\na time must often elapse between an accusation and a refutation, during\r\nwhich time the wound is festering. Declining years certainly did not\r\nprevent the officer whose name is now under notice from taking a part in\r\nthe operations, such as they were, of the English troops at Meerut;\r\nalthough in his sixty-eighth year, he slept on the ground among the\r\nguns, like his men, on the 10th of May, and for fourteen consecutive\r\nnights he did the same; while for many following weeks he never doffed\r\nhis regimentals, except for change of apparel, night or day. Whether\r\nsuch details are trivial or not, depends on the nature of the\r\naccusations. It is only the hasty judgments of those at a distance that\r\nare here commented on; the dissatisfaction of the Calcutta authorities\r\nwill be adverted to in a future page.\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of the Europeans at Meerut were drawn in a forcible way\r\ntowards the inmates of a convent and school at Sirdhana—an establishment\r\nremarkable as existing in that part of India. We must go back sixty\r\nyears to understand this. Towards the close of the last century, there\r\nwas a Cashmerian bayadère or dancing-girl, who became associated with a\r\nGerman adventurer, and then, by a course of unscrupulous intrigue and\r\nfearless sanguinary measures, obtained possession of three considerable\r\njaghires or principalities in the region around and between Meerut and\r\nDelhi. These cities, as well as Agra and others in the Doab, were at\r\nthat time in the hands of the great Mahratta chief, Dowlut Rao Scindia.\r\nAfter a series of brilliant victories, the British obtained possession\r\nof the Doab in 1803, but awarded a petty sovereignty to the female\r\nadventurer, who became thenceforth known as the Begum Sumroo. She\r\nretained her queendom until her death in 1836, after which the three\r\njaghires passed into the hands of the British. This remarkable woman,\r\nduring the later years of her life, professed the Roman Catholic faith;\r\nshe had a spacious and handsome palace at Sirdhana, about twelve miles\r\nfrom Meerut; and near it she built a Catholic church, imitative on a\r\nsmall scale of St Peter’s at Rome, with a beautiful altar inlaid with\r\nmosaics and precious stones. Out of twelve thousand inhabitants in\r\nSirdhana, about one-tenth now profess themselves Christians, having\r\nimitated the begum in her change of religion; and there is a Christian\r\nconvent there, containing a number of priests, nuns, and pupils. When,\r\ntherefore, the outrages occurred at Meerut, apprehensions naturally\r\narose concerning the fate of the European women and girls at this\r\nconvent. About five days after the Revolt commenced, rumours came in\r\nthat the inmates of the convent at Sirdhana were in peril; and it was\r\nonly by great exertions that the postmaster at Meerut was enabled to\r\nbring some of them away. A letter written in reference to this\r\nproceeding said: ‘The poor nuns begged of him, when he was coming away,\r\nto try and send them some help; he tried all he could to get a guard to\r\nescort them to this station, but did not succeed; and yesterday morning\r\n(16th of May), having given up the idea of procuring a guard from the\r\nmilitary authorities, he went round, and by speaking to some gentlemen,\r\ngot about fifteen persons to volunteer their services, to go and rescue\r\nthe poor nuns and children from Sirdhana; and I am happy to say they\r\nsucceeded in their charitable errand without any one having been\r\ninjured.’\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, during the burnings and murderings at Meerut\r\non the evening of the 10th, most of the mutineers of the three regiments\r\nstarted off to Delhi. They took, as was afterwards found, the high road\r\nfrom Meerut, and passing the villages of Begumabad, Moradnuggur,\r\nFurrucknuggur, and Shahderuh, reached Delhi early on Monday; the\r\ninfantry making forced marches, and the cavalry riding near them for\r\nsupport. Proof was soon afforded that the native troops in that city, or\r\nsome of them, had been waiting for the mutineers, prepared to join them\r\nin an organised attack on the Europeans. What aspect that attack put on,\r\nand what were the calamities to which it gave rise, will be narrated in\r\nthe next two chapters.\r\n\r\nMany days elapsed before Meerut recovered its tranquillity. Such men of\r\nthe 3d, 11th, and 20th regiments as remained faithful—especially the\r\n11th, of whom there were more than a hundred—were received at the\r\ncantonment, and their previous insubordination pardoned on account of\r\ntheir subsequent fidelity; but still there were many causes for anxiety.\r\nIn the major-general’s first report on the disasters, he said: ‘Nearly\r\nthe whole of the cantonment and Zillah police have deserted.’ These\r\npolice or watchmen are referred to by an officer familiar with the\r\ndistrict, who says: ‘Round about Meerut and Delhi there are two or three\r\npeculiar castes or tribes, something similar to our gipsies, only\r\nholding human life at less value, and which in former days gave constant\r\ntrouble. Of late years, they have lived in more peace and quietness,\r\ncontenting themselves with picking up stray cattle and things that did\r\nnot belong to them. They have now, however, on the earliest occasion\r\nbroken out again, and have been guilty of all kinds of depredations.\r\nSkinner’s Horse was originally raised to keep these people in order,\r\nabout the time of Lord Lake; such men have hitherto been necessary at\r\nMeerut, Delhi, and those parts, as watchmen; every one was obliged to\r\nkeep one, to avoid being robbed to a certainty.’ The Meerut inhabitants\r\nhad thus, in addition to their other troubles, the knowledge that gangs\r\nof desperadoes would be likely to acquire renewed audacity through the\r\ndefection of the native police.\r\n\r\nIt was soon ascertained that the dâk communications on many of the roads\r\nwere cut off, and the military commandant found much difficulty in\r\ntransmitting intelligence to the seat of government. Five days after the\r\ngreat outbreak, another cause of uneasiness ensued. Six companies of\r\nnative Sappers and Miners arrived at Meerut from Roorkee, under their\r\ncommander, Major Fraser. The place here named is interesting in a\r\ntwofold point of view. Being situated in one of the most elevated sites\r\nin the Doab between the Jumna and the Ganges, about eighty miles north\r\nof Meerut, it was selected as the head-quarters for operations on the\r\ngreat Ganges Canal, the noblest British work in India; and here has been\r\nmade a magnificent aqueduct nine hundred feet in length, with arches of\r\nfifty feet span. This aqueduct, and the necessary workshops and\r\nmodel-rooms of the engineers, have converted the place from a small\r\nvillage to a considerable station. Roorkee also contains an\r\nestablishment called the ‘Thomason College,’ for affording instruction\r\nin civil engineering to Europeans and natives. When the native Sappers\r\nand Miners, about eight hundred strong, arrived at Meerut from this\r\nplace, on the 16th of May—either excited by the news of the late\r\noccurrences, or moved by some other impulse—they suddenly shot their\r\ncommanding officer, and made off for the open country. A force of the\r\nCarabiniers and horse-artillery went in pursuit of them, and shot down\r\nmany; but a greater number escaped, probably to Delhi. Such of the\r\ncompanies as did not attempt flight were disarmed and carefully watched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dâk Runner.\r\n]\r\n\r\nToo soon, alas! did the Europeans at Meerut know that atrocities were\r\nbeing committed at Delhi. By twos and threes did fugitives come in, glad\r\nto sacrifice all else for the sake of very life. Now several officers of\r\nthe 38th native regiment; now a merchant and his family; now officers of\r\nthe 74th and their families; now civil servants of the Company; now\r\nofficers of the 54th—all toil-worn, dirty, ragged, hungered, weighed\r\ndown by the miseries of their forty miles’ flight from brutal\r\nassailants: women, as is usual with Englishwomen, bearing their share of\r\nthese miseries with the truest heroism. All was doubt as to the\r\noccurrences in other quarters; dâks were cut off, telegraphic wires were\r\nsevered; the wishes and orders of the governor-general at one place, and\r\nthe commander-in-chief at another, could not yet be known. On the night\r\nof the outbreak, two Europeans had endeavoured to travel by dâk from\r\nMeerut to Delhi; they encountered the rebels, and were murdered; and\r\nthis was the commencement of indications, afterwards abundant enough,\r\nthat the roads were no longer safe. All that was certain was, that a\r\nsudden social earthquake had overturned the homes of families distant\r\nnine hundred miles from Calcutta, bringing death to many, mourning and\r\nloss to others, distrust and anxiety to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                DELHI, THE CENTRE OF INDIAN NATIONALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of this narrative now requires that attention—more particular\r\nthan will be required in relation to other cities in India—should be\r\nbestowed on the world-renowned Delhi, the great focus of all that can be\r\ncalled truly national in that vast country. Three regiments fled from\r\nMeerut to Delhi, and there found other regiments ready to join them in\r\nscenes of revolt and violence, of spoliation and murder; but it is\r\nnecessary, in order to appreciate what followed, to know why Delhi is\r\nregarded in a peculiar light by the natives: why a successful resistance\r\nto British rule was, and must long continue to be, more serious in that\r\nlocality than in any other part of the East. Not only ought the position\r\nof the city, considered as the residence of a hundred and sixty thousand\r\nMohammedans and Hindoos, to be rendered familiar; but the reader should\r\nknow how it has happened that the sovereign of that city has, for eight\r\nor nine hundred years, been regarded in a peculiar sense as the autocrat\r\nof Hindostan, the one man before whom millions of natives have been wont\r\nto bend the knee, or rather to lie prostrate in abject submission.\r\n\r\nWhat India was before the arrival of the Mussulmans, need not be told\r\nhere at any length. We know, in truth, very little on that matter. It\r\nwas from the days of the first Moslem conqueror that the greatness of\r\nDelhi began. Long before the Christian era, Arab merchants brought rich\r\nspiceries from Sinde and Malabar, and sold them to Phœnician merchants,\r\nwho conveyed them on laden camels by way of Petra to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. Other portions of Indian merchandise were carried up the\r\nPersian Gulf and the Euphrates to a point whence they were transported\r\nwestward to Aleppo or Antioch—a route almost identical with that\r\nadvocated in the present day for a Euphrates railway and a Euphrates\r\ntelegraph. The Greeks derived all their knowledge of Indian commodities\r\nthrough the Phœnicians: while their information concerning the country\r\nitself was obtained from the Persians, who at one time held sway as far\r\nas the Indus. The expedition of Alexander the Great into India, about\r\n326 B.C., first gave the Greeks a personal knowledge of this wonderful\r\nland; and many successors of the great Macedonian added to the then\r\nexisting amount of information concerning the tribes, the productions,\r\nthe customs of the region beyond the Indus. Consequent on those\r\ndiscoveries, the merchants of the newly founded city of Alexandria\r\ngradually obtained a command of the trade with India: bringing the rich\r\nproduce of the East by ship to Berenice on the Red Sea, and then\r\ntransporting it overland to Alexandria. The commodities thus imported\r\nwere chiefly precious stones, spices, perfumes, and silks; and during\r\nsome centuries the Roman Empire was drained of much specie to pay for\r\nthese imports. Alexandrians were the principal merchants who furnished\r\nthe nations of Europe with Indian articles till the discovery of the\r\npassage round the Cape of Good Hope by Vasco de Gama in 1498. The\r\nwestern nations of Asia, however, continued to be supplied principally\r\nby the merchants of Basra or Bussorah, a very flourishing commercial\r\ncity near the point where the Euphrates empties itself into the Persian\r\nGulf; and there was also an extensive caravan-trade from Northern India\r\nthrough Northern Persia to the Caspian and the Black Sea. The discovery\r\nof the Cape of Good Hope route naturally attracted the attention of the\r\nmaritime nations of Europe towards India, followed by the settlement of\r\nPortuguese and Dutch traders on the coast, and ultimately by the\r\nwonderful rise of British power in those regions through the\r\ninstrumentality of the East India Company.\r\n\r\nBut although trading instincts thus laid India open to the commercial\r\ndealings of merchants, and to the cupidity of European princes, it was\r\nnot until modern erudition had been applied to the subject that the true\r\nhistory of the land of the Hindoos became at all known. Scholars found,\r\nwhen they had mastered the Sanscrit or sacred language of that people,\r\nthat a wonderful mine of information was thrown open to them. They\r\nascertained that the nation, whatever it may have been called, from\r\nwhich the genuine Hindoos are descended, must at some period have\r\ninhabited the central plains of Asia, whence they migrated into the\r\nnorthern parts of India; that for at least a thousand years before the\r\nChristian era, great and powerful empires existed in Hindostan, which\r\nmade considerable progress in knowledge, civilisation, and literature;\r\nthat Southern India, or the Deccan, was conquered and peopled by the\r\nHindoos at a much later date than the rest; that Buddhism, the religion\r\nof the earlier inhabitants, was overruled and driven out by Brahminism\r\nor Hindooism in the fifth century of our era; and that for five\r\ncenturies longer, the Hindoos were the true rulers of this much-coveted\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, as has been already implied, only with the arrival of\r\nthe Mohammedans that the course of Indian history took that turn which\r\nis now interesting to us, especially in connection with the city of\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nThe year 1000 was marked by the invasion of India by Mahmoud of Ghiznee,\r\na Tatar sovereign who held sway among the chieftains of Afghanistan. He\r\ndefeated the rajah of Lahore at Peshawur; then penetrated beyond the\r\nSutlej; and returned laden with spoil. In a second expedition he\r\nconquered Moultan; in a third, he reconquered the same city after a\r\nrevolt. A fourth expedition found Mahmoud opposed by a confederacy of\r\nall the sovereigns of Northern India, who, seeing a common danger,\r\nresolved to unite for a common cause; they were rapidly gaining an\r\nadvantage over him, when the sudden fright of an elephant induced a\r\npanic in the Hindoo army, and left the victory to Mahmoud, who returned\r\nto Ghiznee still more richly laden with booty than ever. For a time, the\r\nHindoo king who reigned over the region of which Delhi was the chief\r\ncity, managed to ward off the hostility of the great invader; but taking\r\noffence at a departure from neutrality during one of the later\r\nexpeditions, Mahmoud captured that city, and returned to Ghiznee with\r\nforty thousand prisoners. For thirty years did these raids and\r\nspoliations continue. The most celebrated next to that which resulted in\r\nthe sack of Delhi, was the expedition intended for the destruction of\r\nthe Hindoo temple of Somnauth in Gujerat: a temple which, if native\r\nannals are to be believed, had fifty thousand worshippers, and was\r\nendowed with a revenue of two thousand villages; which had two thousand\r\nBrahmins officiating as priests, five hundred daughters of noble Hindoos\r\nas dancing-girls, three hundred musicians; and the sandal-wood gates of\r\nwhich were the theme of magniloquence from the pen of an English\r\ngovernor-general eight centuries afterwards.[7] Mahmoud broke all the\r\nidols, and carried off countless treasures to Ghiznee.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the period of the rise of British power, the\r\nMohammedans never lost their hold upon India, however much it may have\r\nbeen shaken by occasional success on the part of the Hindoos; nor did\r\nthey ever cease to regard Delhi as the chief Indian city. Although\r\nMahmoud made twelve expeditions across the Indus, the object was mainly\r\nbooty, rather than permanent settlement. His successors, however,\r\nestablished a regular government in the Punjaub, and in the region\r\nthence eastward to Delhi. The Ghiznee dynasty was put an end to in the\r\nyear 1184, when it was overcome by the Seljuks; and in 1193 Delhi was\r\nformally appointed capital of the Moslem sovereigns of India. After a\r\nsuccession of rebellions and murders, exhibiting all the hideous\r\nfeatures of Oriental politics, the Seljuk dynasty fell to pieces in the\r\nyear 1289. Then arose a third Mohammedan dynasty, that of the Afghans or\r\nPatans, who came like all the other conquerors of India from the\r\nnorthwest, and who like them coveted Delhi as their capital. For about a\r\ncentury did these Patan emperors reign, continually struggling against\r\nHindoo rajahs on the one hand, and Mussulman adventurers on the other.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1398 that Tamerlane—familiar to all school-boys in\r\nEngland by the famous name of Timour the Tatar—first set foot in India,\r\nand laid the foundation of the Mogul dynasty. Properly speaking, he was\r\nnot a true Mogul, but belonged to the rival Tatar nation of Turcomans;\r\nnevertheless the line of emperors to which he gave origin has always\r\nbeen known as the Mogul dynasty. He was a ruthless conqueror, who,\r\nhaving ravaged all Central Asia from the Black Sea to the Chinese\r\nfrontier, turned his attention towards India. He crossed the Indus at\r\nAttock, went to Moultan, and extended his march to Delhi, wading through\r\nHindoo blood, which he shed without resistance and almost without cause.\r\nThe native annalists record how he put a hundred thousand beings to\r\ndeath in the great city; how he caused himself to be proclaimed Emperor\r\nor Great Mogul of India; how he departed suddenly to end his days on the\r\nother side of the Indus; and how Delhi mourned for many a year over its\r\nmiseries. No pen can describe what India suffered during the next\r\ncentury and a quarter, with a Mogul emperor at Delhi, constantly\r\nfighting with the Mohammedan chieftains who resisted his authority.\r\n\r\nThe long but often broken line of wretched despots need not be\r\nenumerated here: a few landmarks of great names—Baber, Akbar,\r\nJehanghire, Shahjehan, Aurungzebe, Nadir Shah—will furnish all that is\r\nneedful for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nBaber—or, in more majestic form, Zahireddin Mohammed Baber—a descendant\r\nof Tamerlane, was the first really great Mohammedan emperor of Delhi,\r\nthe first Mogul who regarded his subjects in any other light than as a\r\nprey to be spoliated. Centering his power at Delhi, he extended it\r\neastward to the mouth of the Ganges; and although, in his short reign of\r\nfour years, from 1526 to 1530, constantly engaged in military\r\nexpeditions, he nevertheless found time to cultivate the arts of peace,\r\nand to attend to whatever appeared calculated to promote the prosperity\r\nof his empire. In blood-shedding, he was scarcely surpassed by his\r\npredecessor Tamerlane: indeed this was a propensity among all the Tatar\r\nchieftains of those times. When his warlike and angry passions were not\r\nexcited, Baber could, however, come forth in a very different light, as\r\na kind and forgiving man, one fond of friends and friendship, and not\r\nwithout a tinge of poetry in his tastes. He was a man of business, who\r\nattended personally to the affairs of government, and passed fewer hours\r\nin sensual idleness than is customary with oriental princes. With the\r\nHindoos he had little trouble; their national character was by this time\r\nmuch broken; the rapid succession of reigning families had inured them\r\nto change; and they had imbibed a feeling of horror and dismay from the\r\natrocities to which the various Moslem conquerors had subjected them.\r\nWhen opposition to his progress had once ceased in India, he became an\r\naltered man. He made or improved roads; established serais or\r\nresting-places for travellers at suitable distances; caused the land to\r\nbe measured, in order to fix taxation by equitable adjustment; planted\r\ngardens, and introduced many trees and plants until then unknown in\r\nIndia; established a regular post from Agra, through Delhi, Lahore, and\r\nPeshawur, to Cabool; and wrought many improvements in the city of Delhi.\r\n\r\nAkbar, unquestionably the wisest and greatest prince who ever ruled\r\nIndia—a prince who was really a benefactor to his people—was the\r\ngrandson of Baber. Becoming emperor of Delhi in 1556, he established the\r\nMogul dynasty on a firmer basis than it had before occupied. The native\r\nHindoos enjoyed, under him, greater prosperity than they had ever\r\nexperienced since the first invasion of the Mohammedans. He was\r\ndistinguished by a spirit of toleration and a love of justice; and the\r\nmemory of his virtues is to this day treasured up by the Hindoos as well\r\nas the Mussulmans of India. As the worshippers of Islam had, by the time\r\nof Akbar, fallen out much among themselves, in various parts of Asia,\r\nthe Mogul Moslems of India gradually became weaned from sympathy with\r\nthe rest, and prepared for more thorough amalgamation with the Hindoos\r\nthan had ever before been possible. If not an amalgamation by family\r\nties, it was at least an incorporation by civil and social usages; and\r\nthus it is that from the time of Akbar may be dated the remarkable\r\nmixture of Mohammedans and Hindoos in so many towns of India. Ambitious\r\nchieftains might continue to struggle for supremacy; but the populace of\r\nthe two religions began to wish rather to trade together than to\r\nexterminate each other. Akbar had the genius to see the full force of\r\nthis tendency, and the honesty to encourage it. He never crushed those\r\nwhom he conquered; but invited all alike, Hindoos as well as\r\nMohammedans, to settle down as peaceful citizens, assured that they\r\nwould receive equal justice from him regardless of their religious\r\ndifferences. He placed natives of both races in offices of trust; he\r\nabolished the capitation-tax on infidels; he forbade the degradation of\r\nwar-prisoners to the position of slaves; he abrogated such of the Hindoo\r\nlaws as were most repulsive to reason or humanity, without being vital\r\nparts of their religion; he discouraged fanaticism among those of his\r\nown faith; he encouraged trade and commerce; he reduced taxation; and he\r\nkept a strict watch over the conduct of the officers of his government.\r\nThe mildness of his character, his strict impartiality to the different\r\nclasses of his subjects the magnanimity which he shewed to his enemies,\r\nand his great personal courage are mentioned with praise even by the\r\nJesuits, who visited India during his reign. Well did this eminent man,\r\nduring his long reign of forty-nine years, deserve the title of Akbar\r\nthe Great; and natural was it that his subjects should look up with\r\nreverence to Delhi, the centre and seat of his empire. His reign, both\r\nin its beginning and its end, was almost exactly contemporaneous with\r\nthat of Queen Elizabeth in England.\r\n\r\nJehanghire, a far inferior prince to Akbar, succeeded him in 1605, and\r\nsoon became involved in troubles. The Uzbeks obtained possession of his\r\ndominions in Cabool; the King of Persia took Candahar from him; the\r\nAfghans revolted from his rule; the Hindoo Rajpoots commenced their\r\nstruggles for independence; and, at a later date, his son Shahjehan\r\nrebelled against him. Nevertheless, Jehanghire, judged by an oriental\r\nstandard, was not a bad ruler of Hindostan. The country enjoyed\r\nconsiderable prosperity under him; literature was extensively\r\ncultivated; many new cities were built; the Hindoo religion experienced\r\neven greater toleration than in the reign of Akbar; and he gave a\r\ncourteous reception to Sir Thomas Roe, sent on an embassy from England\r\nto the Great Mogul. He was, however, a strange being. In a fit of anger\r\nagainst certain rebels, he caused several hundreds of them to be\r\nimpaled, and placed in a row leading out of the Lahore gate at Delhi;\r\nand he himself rode past them on an elephant, ‘to receive the obeisance\r\nof his friends.’ His native ferocity also shone out, in his causing one\r\nof his principal councillors to be sewed up in the hide of a newly\r\nflayed ox, and thrown into the street; the hide, shrinking in the heat\r\nof the sun, compressed him to death; but as the compression came too\r\nsoon to satisfy the savage feelings of the monarch, he caused the next\r\nvictim, when similarly incased, to be sprinkled with water occasionally,\r\nto prolong the torture. One of the most remarkable circumstances in the\r\ncareer of Jehanghire was the influence gradually acquired over him by\r\nhis Sultaness Nurmahal, the ‘light of the palace,’ whose name became\r\nchanged to Nurjehan, the ‘light of the world;’ her exquisite beauty,\r\nwit, and accomplishments, won the love of the monarch; and as she was in\r\nmind and heart far his superior, her power over him was often exerted\r\nfor good purposes.\r\n\r\nShahjehan, an ungrateful son to Jehanghire, was destined to be, in turn,\r\nthe victim of his own son Aurungzebe. He was an emperor from 1627 to\r\n1659, and then a miserable uncrowned captive for seven years longer. He\r\nattacked all the neighbouring princes whose dominions or wealth he\r\ncoveted; and blinded or murdered all his relations whose ambition he\r\ndreaded. And yet, amid his atrocities, he was a man of much ability.\r\nDelhi, Agra, and other cities, benefited by his rule. The internal\r\ngovernment of his kingdom was very complete. The great mosque at Delhi,\r\nand the Taj Mahal at Agra, which rose at his command, are, to this day,\r\nobjects of admiration to the natives of India. Though it may, to English\r\nminds, have been a waste of public money to spend six millions sterling\r\non the far-famed peacock’s throne; yet, as all his establishments were\r\nformed on a scale of great magnificence, and as numerous other cities\r\nand towns throughout the Empire vied with the splendour of Delhi and\r\nAgra—there is evidence that the Mogul and his dominions must have owned\r\nvast wealth. He possessed both taste and financial tact; and thus, with\r\nall his atrocities, Shahjehan left behind him a full treasury and a\r\nsplendid and prosperous empire.\r\n\r\nAurungzebe, the last Mogul who maintained the real greatness of the\r\nnative court of Delhi, became emperor in 1659, by an act of violence\r\nagainst his royal parent. He captured the cities of Hyderabad, Bejapore,\r\nand Golconda, and extended his dominions nearly to the limits of the\r\nCarnatic. There were, however, the germs of mischief perceptible in his\r\nreign: the warlike Hindoo tribe of Mahrattas rose into note; and though\r\nthey were frequently defeated in the plains by the troops of Aurungzebe,\r\nhe was unable to subdue the country inhabited by these mountaineers.\r\nSevajee, the founder of the Mahratta empire, gradually conquered the\r\ngreater part of the Deccan; he died in 1682, and his son, Sambajee, was\r\nput to a cruel death by Aurungzebe in 1689; but the Mogul emperors of\r\nthe north could never afterwards wholly subdue the Mahratta rajah of the\r\nsouth. Aurungzebe was illiberal towards his Hindoo subjects; and this\r\ncircumstance threw them into closer sympathy than would otherwise have\r\nbeen produced with the rude Mahratta mountaineers. He was not without\r\nability; but he had neither the wisdom nor the justice to maintain his\r\nwide-spreading empire in a state of greatness; and when he died in 1707,\r\nhe left the Mogul power at Delhi much weaker than he found it at the\r\nperiod of his seizure of the crown.\r\n\r\nNadir Shah, although never emperor of Delhi, must be named here as one\r\nwho contributed to the crumbling of the Mogul dynasty. This man, one of\r\nthe grand barbarians whom Central Asia has so often sent forth, was the\r\nson of a sheep-skin cap-maker. He became a soldier of fortune; then the\r\nleader of a band of robbers; then governor of Khorassan; then Shah of\r\nPersia; then a formidable opponent of the Turks and the Afghans; and\r\nthen a scourge to India. While devastating Afghanistan in 1738, he\r\nrequired of the Emperor of Delhi that none of the Afghans should find\r\nshelter in his (the Mogul’s) dominions; but as no attention was paid to\r\nhis demands, he marched into Hindostan in the following year, and\r\nentered Delhi with an enormous army on the 8th of March. He seized the\r\nwhole of the vast treasures which had been amassed in the course of\r\nnearly two centuries by the Mogul monarchs. The citizens not being so\r\nsubmissive as he wished, he ordered a general massacre. His commands\r\nwere only too well obeyed; for, from sunrise till noon, the inhabitants\r\nwere slaughtered by his soldiers without distinction of sex or age. At\r\nthe earnest intercession of the emperor, Nadir ordered the butchery to\r\nbe stopped. Where the estimates of human beings murdered varies from\r\n8000 to 150,000, it is clear that no trustworthy data are obtainable;\r\nbut it is unquestionable that Delhi suffered immensely, both in its\r\npopulation and its wealth. The ruthless despoiler not only refrained\r\nfrom claiming the crown of Hindostan, but he did not make any conquests\r\nwhatever: he came simply as a Shah of Persia on an errand of vengeance;\r\nhe remained two months at Delhi; and then departed westward, carrying\r\nwith him treasures that have been variously estimated at from thirty to\r\nseventy millions sterling.\r\n\r\nThe Delhi monarchs no longer need or deserve our attention; they had\r\nfallen from their high estate, and were forced to struggle constantly\r\nfor the maintenance of their authority. A number of obscure names meet\r\nour view after the time of Aurungzebe—Shah Alum, Moez-Eddin, Furrucksir,\r\nMohammed Shah, Ahmed Shah, Alumghir, and Shah Alum II.: each more\r\npowerless than the preceding. Now they were attacked by the warlike\r\nMahrattas; now by the Rajpoots, a military Hindoo tribe which had never\r\nbeen wholly subdued by the Moslems; now by the Sikhs, a kind of Hindoo\r\ndissenters, brave and independent in their bearing; now by the Rohillas,\r\nan Afghan race, who effected a settlement in the very neighbourhood of\r\nDelhi; now by many of the Mohammedan nawabs or viceroys, who, like other\r\nAsiatic viceroys in parallel circumstances, were willing to rise on the\r\nfall of their masters; now by the competing sons and nephews who\r\nsurrounded every emperor; and now—more striking in its consequences than\r\nall the rest—by the ever-encroaching British.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, amid all this decadence of Mogul power, the natives of\r\nHindostan never ceased to look up to the emperor as the centre of power,\r\nto Delhi as the centre of nationality. Their traditions told them of\r\nMahmoud, of Tamerlane, of Baber, of the great Akbar, of Jehanghire, of\r\nShahjehan, of Aurungzebe; and although ruthless barbarities were\r\nconnected with the names of many of these rulers, there was still a\r\ngrandeur that impressed the imagination. The Hindoos, it is true, had\r\ntheir sacred associations connected with Benares rather than with Delhi;\r\nbut their distinct nationality had been almost stamped out of them\r\nduring eight centuries of Mohammedan supremacy; and they, like the rest,\r\nheld in reverence the city where the peacock’s throne had glittered on\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nBy what strange steps the descendants of the Great Mogul became\r\npensioners of the East India Company, will be explained presently; but\r\nit will be well first to describe Delhi itself.\r\n\r\nThis far-famed city is situated on the river Jumna, about five hundred\r\nmiles by road above Allahabad, where the Jumna flows into the Ganges,\r\nand nine hundred by road from Calcutta. In the opposite direction, Delhi\r\nis nearly four hundred miles from Lahore, and six or seven hundred from\r\nPeshawur—so great are the distances between the chief towns in India:\r\ndistances that terribly hamper the operations of a British army during\r\nany sudden emergency. Striking as Delhi may be, it presents but a faint\r\napproach in splendour to the city of past days, the home of the grand\r\nold Moguls. Of the original Delhi, the natives give the most extravagant\r\naccount; they even run back to a period three thousand years before the\r\nChristian era for its foundation. All that is certain, however, is, that\r\nInderput or Indraprestha, the name of the old city, was the capital of a\r\nHindoo kingdom under a rajah, long before its conquest by the\r\nMohammedans. When or how the original city went to ruin, is not exactly\r\nknown; but modern Delhi owes its chief adornments to Shahjehan. A\r\ntraveller from the south or Agra direction is struck with the evidences\r\nof ruined Inderput before he sees anything of modern Delhi. ‘Everywhere\r\nthroughout the plain rise shapeless half-ruined obelisks, the relics of\r\nmassive Patan architecture, their bases buried under heaps of ruins\r\nbearing a dismal growth of thorny shrubs. Everywhere we tread on\r\noverthrown walls. Brick mosaics mark the ground-plan of the humbler\r\ndwellings of the poorer classes. Among the relics of a remote age, are\r\noccasionally to be seen monuments of light and elegant style of\r\narchitecture, embellished with brilliant colours, gilt domes, and\r\nminarets incased in enamelled tiles.’ Some travellers have asserted that\r\nthey have traced these ruins thirty miles along the Jumna; but these\r\ncannot all have been the ruins of one city. Approaching the present\r\nDelhi, it is seen that the ruins are spread over a plain, in the midst\r\nof which the city is situated; and they give place, after a time, to the\r\ntasteful villas of the Europeans who exercise civil or military control\r\nwithin Delhi. Most of these villas are on the site of the once famous\r\ngarden of Shalimar. On the northern side of the city, close under a\r\nridge of sandstone rocks called the Mijnoon Pahar, are the\r\ncantonments—an alternation of bungalows, huts, and groups of trees.\r\n\r\nSo much for the environs. Although not entitled to take rank among the\r\ngreat cities of the earth, Delhi is nevertheless a considerable place,\r\nfor it is seven miles in circumference. The Jumna bounds it on the east,\r\nwhile a lofty crenellated wall, of horseshoe shape, completes the\r\nboundary on the other sides. This wall has been an object of much\r\nattention at different times. As built by Shahjehan, it possessed little\r\nstrength. When the British obtained ascendency over the city in 1803,\r\nthe wall was found to be in a ruinous state, without other flanking\r\ndefences than small circular bastions placed at intervals; the ditch was\r\nimperfect; there was scarcely any vestige of a glacis or exterior slope;\r\nand the crumbling ruins of dilapidated buildings had been allowed to\r\naccumulate all round the wall. Captains Hutchinson and Smith, of the\r\nBengal engineers, were thereupon deputed to restore and strengthen the\r\nfortifications. It was determined to establish a series of bastions,\r\nwith faces and flanks to defend the curtain or plain wall, and to mount\r\nthem with heavy artillery. The walls were repaired; and to shield them\r\nfrom escalade, they were protected, especially on the river-front, with\r\nbeams of timber, the sharpened ends of which were pointed at an acute\r\nangle downward into the ditch. The ditch was cleared out and deepened;\r\nthe glacis was made to cover, in some degree, the scarp of the wall; the\r\nground outside was cleared to some distance of ruins and houses; and the\r\nravines were filled up to check the approach of marauding horsemen. To\r\nprepare for a rising within the city as well as an attack from without,\r\ndetached martello towers were constructed, entirely separate from the\r\nwalls, and accessible from them only by drawbridges; each tower had a\r\ngun mounted on a pivot, so that in the event of a tumult in the city,\r\nthe towers might be occupied by artillerymen, the drawbridges drawn up,\r\nand the guns swiveled round to pour a fire upon the insurgents. The\r\ngateways of the city were strengthened; outworks were provided in front\r\nof some of them, while others were provided with guard-houses and\r\n_places-d’armes_. At a much later date—in 1838—Lord Auckland caused the\r\nwalls and towers to be strengthened, and one of the new defences, called\r\nthe Wellesley Bastion, to be reconstructed.\r\n\r\nIn what relation these defences stood to a British besieging force in\r\n1857, will remain to be told in a future chapter: we proceed here with\r\nthe description of the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF DELHI.—From a Coloured Lithograph by A. Maclure:\r\n    taken from original native Drawings.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDelhi has seven gates on the land-side, named, respectively, the Lahore,\r\nAjmeer, Turcoman, Cabool, Mohur or Moree, Cashmere, and Agra Gates;\r\nwhile along the river-front are four others, the Rajghat, Negumbod,\r\nLall, and Kaila Gates. Some little diversity is shewn by travellers in\r\ngiving these names; and some make the number of gates twelve instead of\r\neleven. The Cashmere Gate is provided with casemated or shot-proof\r\nchambers, for the accommodation of a city-guard. A bridge of boats over\r\nthe Jumna connects Delhi with the road leading northeastward to Meerut,\r\nand the chief magazine is, or was, between the centre of the city and\r\nthis bridge. Eight of the defences on the walls are called the Shah\r\nBastion, Burn Bastion, Gurstin Bastion, College Bastion, Ochterlony\r\nBastion, Lake Bastion, Wellesley Bastion, and Nawab Bastion—names\r\nobviously derived, in most instances, from military officers engaged in\r\nthe Company’s service. Strictly speaking, the wall does not quite\r\nsurround the city; for on one side it abuts on a small branch of the\r\nriver, where there is a short bridge across to the old fort of\r\nSelimgurh, built in a very heavy style by one of the early emperors.\r\nEntirely outside the wall, north of the city, is a custom-house, which\r\naffords a curious commentary on the relations existing between the civil\r\nand military officers of the Company. It was first built by a medical\r\nofficer, then sold to the Company for a treasury, and then adapted as a\r\ncustom-house. The engineers wanted to get rid of this building, as an\r\nobstruction to their plan of defences, in the same way as they had swept\r\naway numerous outhouses, bazaars, and ruins; but the civilians prevented\r\nthis; and so the custom-house remained till 1857, when the building and\r\nits garden became a ready prey to the rebels.\r\n\r\nThe city, considered without relation to its defences, presents many of\r\nthose features so familiar in oriental towns. As seen by the approaching\r\ntraveller, few of the dwelling-houses peep above the ramparts; but the\r\nJumma Musjid or principal mosque, the turreted and battlemented palace,\r\nthe minarets, and other public buildings, combine to form a majestic\r\npicture; while the graceful acacias and lofty date-trees bending over\r\nthe ramparts, and the grouping of tombs with sombre foliage on the\r\nglacis, add new features to the scene. Arrived within the city, it is\r\nseen that the streets are mostly narrow. The chief exception is that of\r\na handsome street running south from the palace to the Agra Gate: three\r\nquarters of a mile long by a hundred and fifty feet wide. This street\r\nhas, therefore, length and breadth enough to afford space for much\r\nsplendour; but the Delhians have not fully availed themselves of this\r\nopportunity, for they have built blocks of small houses in the midst of\r\nthis street, analogous in some degree to the ‘Middle Rows’ known to the\r\ninhabitants of London. Another large street, similarly shorn of its due\r\ndignity, runs from the palace westward to the Lahore Gate. Both streets\r\nare, however, enlivened by raised water-courses flowing in channels of\r\nred stone—part of a great work begun and finished by the Company, for\r\nsupplying Delhi with water.\r\n\r\nThe glories of Delhi are the great mosque and the still greater palace.\r\nThe Jumma Musjid, situated in the centre of the city, is one of those\r\nbuildings to which Mohammedans point with pride: famous not only in\r\nHindostan, but all over Southern and Central Asia. It presents to the\r\neye an open court on an elevated platform, nearly five hundred feet\r\nsquare; in the middle of which is a marble fountain for the ablutions\r\nnecessary in the ceremonials of Islamism. On three sides of this court\r\nare open arcades and octagonal pavilions; while on the fourth side is\r\nthe mosque, a structure of great splendour approached by a magnificent\r\nflight of marble steps. White marble cornices inlaid in black marble\r\nwith inscriptions from the Koran; walls, ceilings, and pavements of the\r\nsame delicate materials; beautiful domes and lofty minarets—all combine\r\nto render the Jumma Musjid a truly gorgeous structure. The Emperor\r\nShahjehan built it more than two centuries ago; and the British\r\ngovernment gave orders in 1851 that it should be kept in repair.\r\n\r\nBut, splendid as is the Jumma Musjid, the imperial palace is still more\r\nstriking—partly for what it is, but principally for what it has been.\r\nThe palace stands between the two principal streets and the bridge. Some\r\ntravellers have compared it with Windsor Castle, some with the Kremlin\r\nat Moscow, in size and majesty; while others insist that it has no\r\ncompeer. Bishop Heber was quite enthusiastic in its praise. In the first\r\nplace, the palatial buildings are surrounded by a wall to which there is\r\ncertainly no parallel either at Windsor or at Moscow; it is of red\r\ngranite, three quarters of a mile in circuit, nearly forty feet high,\r\nflanked with turrets and domes, and entered by two noble gates with\r\nbarbicans. This wall is a grand work in itself, irrespective of the\r\nstructures it encloses. Strictly speaking, the wall is only on three\r\nsides, the fourth abutting on a small branch of the Jumna, where occurs\r\nthe short bridge crossing to the old fort of Selimgurh. The palace\r\nitself is entered by a series of beautiful gateways, all of red granite,\r\nand all sculptured with flowers and inscriptions from the Koran. The\r\nvaulted aisles and the open octagonal courts are spoken of by Heber with\r\ngreat admiration. The Dewani Khas, or private council-chamber, although\r\nallowed to become filthy by the visits of crows and kites, is an\r\nexquisite structure; it is a pavilion of white marble, supporting four\r\ncupolas of the same delicate material, with pillars and arches\r\nelaborately inlaid with gilt arabesques, flowers, and inscriptions. The\r\ngarden around it has numerous white marble fountains of elegant form,\r\nand a small octagonal pavilion with bath-rooms, but all dirty and\r\nneglected. The Moti Musjid or private mosque for the court, and the\r\nDewani-aum or public hall of audience, are, like the rest of the palace,\r\nornate in marble and in carving, in sculpture and in inscriptions, in\r\ngilding and in inlaying; and, also like the rest, disfigured with\r\nfilth—a combination truly oriental. In the hall of audience is, or was\r\nbefore the Revolt, the dais on which once stood the world-renowned\r\npeacock’s throne, formed entirely of gold and jewels; and it was in this\r\nsame chamber that the victorious Nadir Shah, by exchanging turbans with\r\nthe defeated Mogul Mohammed Shah, obtained possession of a treasure\r\nalmost as renowned as the peacock’s throne itself—the _koh-i-noor_, the\r\n‘mountain of light,’ the glorious diamond which, after various\r\nvicissitudes, now occupies a place in the regalia of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nPassing from a scene of decayed splendour to one of living interest, we\r\nfind Delhi to be inhabited by almost an exactly equal number of Hindoos\r\nand Mohammedans, eighty thousand of each; but it is essentially a\r\nMohammedan city, the centre of their prestige and influence in India;\r\nand all the dwellings and public buildings of the Hindoos are indicative\r\nof a race locally less powerful. Besides the imperial palace just\r\ndescribed, there is, about nine miles from Delhi, near an extraordinary\r\npillar called the Kootub Minar, the country residence of the emperor,\r\nor, as it has been more customary in recent years to call him, the King.\r\nIt is a large but paltry building, in an inferior style of Italian\r\narchitecture, with a public road running through the very court-yard.\r\nWithin the city a palace was built for the British resident a few years\r\nago; and around this building a number of elegant houses have since been\r\nerected, by the natives as well as by the Europeans. Since the once\r\ngreat Mogul has been a king without a kingdom, a pensioned puppet of the\r\nCompany, a potentate having nothing to employ his thoughts and his\r\npension but political intrigue and sensual indulgence—the representative\r\nof England has been a sort of envoy or resident, ostensibly rendering\r\nhonour to the Mogul, but really watching that he does no mischief,\r\nreally insuring that he shall be a king only in name. But more on this\r\npoint presently. The British civil staff in the city comprises—or did\r\ncomprise before the Revolt—a resident or commissioner, a revenue\r\ncollector, a magistrate, and other officials. There have usually been\r\nthree regiments barracked or stationed in the cantonment; but the\r\nmilitary importance of the place has been rather due to the fact that\r\nDelhi has been made a depôt for a large park of artillery—valuable\r\nenough when in the hands of the British, but a source of dismay and\r\ndisaster when seized by mutineers.\r\n\r\nAlthough this narrative has little to do with the merits or demerits of\r\nDelhi as a place of residence; yet, knowing something of what Englishmen\r\nand Englishwomen have had to bear when cooped up within a town or fort\r\nmenaced by ruthless natives, every compatriot at home would like further\r\nto know in what way those trials are likely to have been aggravated by\r\nthe incidents of climate. A lady-traveller furnishes a vivid picture of\r\nDelhi in a _hot-wind_, such as frequently visits towns in India during\r\ncertain seasons of the year. ‘Every article of furniture is burning to\r\nthe touch; the hardest wood, if not well covered with blankets, will\r\nsplit with a report like that of a pistol; and linen taken from the\r\ndrawers appears as if just removed from a kitchen-fire. The nights are\r\nterrible, every apartment being heated to excess. Gentlemen usually have\r\ntheir beds placed in the verandahs, or on the chubootiar or terrace on\r\nthe top of the house: as they incur little risk in sleeping in the open\r\nair, at a season in which no dew falls, and when there is scarcely any\r\nvariation in the thermometer. Tornadoes are frequent during these hot\r\nwinds; while they last, the skies, though cloudless, are darkened with\r\ndust, the sun is obscured, and a London fog cannot more effectually\r\nexclude the prospect. The birds are dreadful sufferers at this season;\r\ntheir wings droop, and their bills are open as if gasping for breath;\r\nall animals are more or less affected.’ Then, when this frightful heat\r\nis about to depart, ensues a storm, more terrible to look at, though\r\neasier to bear. ‘The approaching strife is made known by a cloud, or\r\nrather a wall of dust, which appears at the extremity of the horizon,\r\nbecoming more lofty as it advances. The air is sultry and still; for the\r\nwind, which is tearing up the sand as it rushes along, is not felt in\r\nfront of the billowy masses, whose mighty ramparts gather strength as\r\nthey spread. At length the plain is surrounded, and the sky becomes as\r\nmurky as midnight. Then the thunder breaks forth, but its most awful\r\npeals are scarcely heard in the deep roar of the tempest; burst succeeds\r\nto burst, each more wild and furious than the former; the forked\r\nlightnings flash in vain, for the dust, which is as thick as snow,\r\nflings an impenetrable veil around them. The wind having spent itself in\r\na final effort, suddenly subsides, and the dust is as speedily dispersed\r\nby torrents of rain, which in a very short time flood the whole\r\ncountry.’ This is the last agony of the storm; after which the\r\ntemperature lowers and nature becomes more tranquil.\r\n\r\nSuch is Delhi—such the city which, amid all its changes of fortune, has\r\nfor so many centuries been an object of reverential affection to the\r\nnatives of Hindostan. When the disorganised regiments from Meerut\r\nentered the imperial gates, they found an aged mogul or king, with sons\r\nand grandsons, courtiers and retainers, willing to make him a\r\nstepping-stone to their own advancement. Who this king was, and how he\r\nhad come into that position, may soon be told.\r\n\r\nPrecisely a century ago, when Clive was preparing to revenge the\r\natrocities connected with the Black Hole at Calcutta, the Delhi empire\r\nwas rapidly losing all its power; the northern and northwestern\r\nprovinces were seized upon by the Afghans and the Sikhs; the Rajpoots\r\nextended their dominions as far as Ajmeer; and the Emperor Alumghir was\r\ntoo weak to protect his capital from the monstrous barbarities of the\r\nAfghan insurgents. The next emperor, Shah Alum II., unable either to\r\nrepel invaders or to control his rebellious nawabs, virtually yielded to\r\nthe rapidly rising power of the East India Company. He signed a treaty\r\nwith Clive in 1765, involving mutual obligations; he was to yield to the\r\nBritish certain provinces, and to award to a resident appointed from\r\nCalcutta considerable power at the court of Delhi; while the British\r\nwere to protect him from his numerous assailants, and to secure him a\r\npension of £260,000 per annum, which, with other sources of wealth,\r\nbrought the degenerate descendant of the Moguls nearly half a million\r\nannually. Troubled by the Mahrattas on one side, by the Rohillas on a\r\nsecond, and by the Nawab of Oude on a third, the paralysed emperor\r\nbecame so bewildered that he knew not which way to turn. About 1788 a\r\nRohilla chieftain suddenly entered Delhi, and put out the eyes of the\r\nunfortunate emperor with a poniard; then the Mahrattas defeated this\r\nchieftain, seized the capital, and reduced Shah Alum himself to a mere\r\npuppet. During this anarchy the British in India were so fully occupied\r\nin other quarters, that they could not make a resolute demonstration in\r\nthe centre of the once great Mogul empire; but in the year 1803 all was\r\nprepared by Lord Lake for a resolute attempt to break down the Mahratta\r\nand Rohilla power in the north, and to insure that the emperor should\r\nhave no other master than the Company—a kindness, the motives for which\r\nwill not bear very close scrutiny. The battle of Delhi, fought on the\r\n11th of September 1803, opened the gates of the city to the British, and\r\nrelieved the emperor from his thraldom. A reverse had very nearly\r\noccurred, however. While Lake was reposing after his victory, Holkar,\r\nthe great Mahratta chief, leaving his cavalry to attract the notice of\r\nthe British at Muttra, suddenly appeared before Delhi with a force of\r\n20,000 infantry and 100 guns. The garrison comprised only two battalions\r\nand four companies of native troops, with a few irregular horse; and as\r\nsome of these deserted at the first affright, there were left only 800\r\nmen and 11 guns to defend a city seven miles in circuit. By unwearied\r\npatience and daring intrepidity, however, Colonel Burn, who was military\r\ncommandant in the city at the time, and who was ably assisted by Colonel\r\nOchterlony and Lieutenant Rose, succeeded in repelling all the attacks\r\nof the Mahrattas; and Holkar retired discomfited.\r\n\r\nFrom that day—from the 16th of October 1803, until the 11th of May\r\n1857—an enemy was never seen before the gates of Delhi; a day had never\r\npassed during which the city had been other than the capital of a state\r\ngoverned nominally by a Mogul king, but really by a British resident.\r\nShah Alum, after thirty years of a troubled life, was vouchsafed three\r\nyears of peace, and died in 1806—a pensioner of that great abstraction,\r\nthat inscrutable mystery to the millions of Hindostan, the ‘Coompanee\r\nBahadoor,’ the Most Honourable Company.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Company’s servants towards the feeble descendant of\r\nthe Great Moguls was, until about thirty years ago, the most absurd\r\nmockery. They took away all his real power, and then offered him a\r\nprivilege, the least exercise of which, if he had ventured on such a\r\nthing, they would at once have resented. Shah Akbar, who succeeded his\r\nold, blind, feeble father, Shah Alum, in 1806, became at once a\r\npensioner. He was really king, not over a kingdom, but only over the\r\ntwelve thousand inmates of the imperial palace at Delhi, his relations\r\nand retainers—the whole of whom he supported on a pension of about a\r\nhundred thousand pounds per annum, paid by the Company. Hindoo and\r\nMussulman, notwithstanding his fallen state, alike looked up to him as\r\nthe only representative of the ancient glories of India; numerous\r\nprinces received their solemn and legal investiture from him; and until\r\n1827, the Company acquired no new province _without applying for his\r\nnominal sanction and official firman_. He was permitted to bestow\r\ndresses of honour on native princes at their accession to the musnud, as\r\na token of suzerainty; and the same ceremony was attempted by him\r\noccasionally towards the governor-general. At length, under the rule of\r\nEarl Amherst in 1827, it was determined to put an end to a system which\r\nwas either a mockery, or an incentive to disaffection on the part of the\r\nDelhians. The pension to the king was increased to a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand pounds, but the supposed or implied vassalage of the East India\r\nCompany to the nominal Padishah or Mohammedan ruler of India was brought\r\nto an end; Shah Akbar being, from that date, powerless beyond the walls\r\nof his palace—except as the representative, the symbol, of something\r\ngreat, still venerated by the natives.\r\n\r\nPalace intrigues have not been wanting at Delhi during the twenty years\r\nthat preceded the Revolt; and these intrigues have borne some relation\r\nto the state of disaffection that accompanied that outbreak. Shah Akbar\r\nreigned, if reigning it can be called, from 1806 until 1837. He wished\r\nto be succeeded by his second son, Shahzadah Jehanghire; but the British\r\nauthorities insisted that the succession should go, as before, to the\r\neldest son; and consequently Meerza Abu Zuffur became emperor on Shah\r\nAkbar’s death in 1837, under the title of Mahomed Suraj-u-deen Shah\r\nGhazee. This monarch, again, exhibited the same distrust of the next\r\nheir that is so often displayed in Oriental countries; the British\r\nauthorities were solicited to set aside the proper heir to the peacock’s\r\nthrone, in favour of a younger prince who possessed much influence in\r\nthe zenana. Again was the request refused; and the palace at Delhi was\r\nknown to have been a focus of discontent and intrigue for some time\r\nprevious to the Revolt. The mode in which the Marquis of Dalhousie\r\ntreated these matters, in his minute of 1856, has already been adverted\r\nto; but it may be well to repeat his words here, to shew the exact state\r\nof Delhi palace-politics at that time. ‘Seven years ago [that is, in\r\n1849], the heir-apparent to the King of Delhi died. He was the last of\r\nthe race who had been born in the purple. The Court of Directors was\r\naccordingly advised to decline to recognise any other heir-apparent, and\r\nto permit the kingly title to fall into abeyance upon the death of the\r\npresent king, who even then was a very aged man. The Honourable Court\r\naccordingly conveyed to the government of India authority to terminate\r\nthe dynasty of Timour, whenever the reigning king should die. But as it\r\nwas found that, although the Honourable Court had consented to the\r\nmeasure, it had given its consent with great reluctance, I abstained\r\nfrom making use of the authority which had been given to me. The\r\ngrandson of the king was recognised as heir-apparent; but only on\r\ncondition that he should quit the palace in Delhi, in order to reside in\r\nthe palace at the Kootub; and that he should, as king, receive the\r\ngovernor-general of India at all times on terms of perfect equality.’ It\r\nwas therefore simply a suspension of the absolute extinction of the\r\nkingly title at Delhi: a suspension dictated, apparently, by the\r\nexistence of a little more hesitation in the court of directors, than in\r\nthe bold governor-general.\r\n\r\nThe king who occupied the nominal throne of Delhi at the time of the\r\nRevolt was neither better nor worse than the average of his\r\npredecessors. A pensioned prince with no responsibilities, he was a true\r\nOriental sensualist, and had become an almost imbecile old man between\r\neighty and ninety years of age. Nevertheless, for the reasons already\r\nmore than once stated, he was invested with a certain greatness in the\r\neyes of the natives of Hindostan; and Delhi was still their great city.\r\nHindoos, Afghans, Patans, Seljuks, Rajpoots, Tatars, Moguls, Persians,\r\nRohillas, Mahrattas, Sikhs—all had left their impress upon the capital;\r\nand with one or other of these, the millions of India had sympathies\r\neither of race or of creed. Even to the hour of the outbreak, the king\r\nwas approached with the reverence due to royalty. In the ruined paradise\r\nof Oriental sensualism, the great palace of Delhi, ‘the house of\r\nTamerlane still revelled in unchecked vileness. The royal family,\r\nconsisting of many hundreds—idle, dissolute, shameless, too proud or too\r\neffeminate for military service—lived in entire dependence on the king’s\r\nallowance. For their amusement were congregated from all India the most\r\nmarvellous jugglers, the most cunning bird-tamers and snake-charmers,\r\nthe most fascinating dancing-girls, the most skilled Persian musicians.\r\nThough the population was exactly balanced between Mohammedans and\r\nHindoos, it was the Moslem who here reigned supreme.’[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HOWDAH OF AN INDIAN PRINCE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  When General Nott returned to India after his victorious campaign in\r\n  Afghanistan in 1842, he brought away with him the gates of Somnauth,\r\n  which, according to the tradition, had remained at Ghiznee since the\r\n  days of Mahmoud. This and other trophies gave occasion to an address\r\n  from Lord Ellenborough to the native princes of India, conceived in\r\n  somewhat bombastic language, in which the recapture of the gates was\r\n  characterised as an achievement ‘avenging the insult of eight hundred\r\n  years.’ The chiefs and princes of Sirhind, Rajwarra, Malwah, and\r\n  Gujarat, were enjoined to transmit, ‘with all honour,’ the gates to\r\n  Somnauth. The address was much ridiculed in England; but those on the\r\n  spot believed it to be calculated to make an impression on the\r\n  natives. The home government, however, would not permit the gates—even\r\n  if the genuine sandal-wood originals, which is not free from doubt—to\r\n  be sent to the still-existing temple of Somnauth; they considered such\r\n  an act would identify the Company injuriously with one of the two\r\n  great parties of religionists in India, and deeply offend the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  King of Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                    THE EVENTFUL ESCAPES FROM DELHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemembering that in the month of May 1857 there was a very aged king\r\nliving in the great palace at Delhi; that the heir-apparent, his\r\ngrandson, resided in the palace of Kootub Minar, eight or nine miles\r\nfrom the city; that the Moslem natives still looked up to the king with\r\na sort of reverence; and that his enormous family had become\r\ndissatisfied with the prospective extinction of the kingly power and\r\nname—remembering these facts, the reader will be prepared to follow the\r\nfortunes of the Meerut mutineers, and to understand on what grounds the\r\nsupport of the royal family was counted upon.\r\n\r\nThe distance to be passed over being forty miles, it was not till the\r\nday after the outbreak at Meerut—namely, the 11th of May—that the three\r\nmutinous regiments reached Delhi. The telegraphic wires were so soon\r\ncut, and the dâks so effectually interrupted, that it is doubtful at\r\nwhat hour, and to what extent, the transactions at Meerut became known\r\nto Brigadier Graves, who commanded at Delhi. The position of that\r\nofficer was well calculated to produce uneasiness in his mind at a time\r\nof insubordination and distrust; for he had no European regiments with\r\nhim. The garrison consisted of the 38th, 54th, and 74th native\r\nregiments, and a battery of native artillery; the English comprised only\r\na few officers and sergeants of those regiments, the various servants of\r\nthe Company, and private traders within the city. The 54th and 74th had\r\nnot up to that time shewn any strong symptoms of disaffection; but the\r\n38th, which had achieved a kind of triumph over the Marquis of Dalhousie\r\nin 1852, in reference to the proposed expedition to Pegu, had ever since\r\ndisplayed somewhat of a boastful demeanour, a pride of position and\r\ninfluence. The three regiments and the artillery had their regular\r\nquarters in the cantonment, about two miles north of the city: sending\r\ninto Delhi such companies or drafts as were necessary to man the\r\nbastions, towers, magazine, &c. As the river Hindoun, a tributary to the\r\nJumna, crosses the Meerut and Delhi road near Furrucknuggur, about ten\r\nmiles from Delhi, it might be a fair problem whether the mutineers could\r\nhave been met and frustrated at the crossing of that river: the solution\r\nof this problem, however, would necessarily depend partly on the time\r\navailable, and partly on the prudence of marching the Delhi force across\r\nthe Jumna at such a period, placing a broad river between the brigadier\r\nand a city likely to be readily affected by notions of disaffection.\r\nWhether influenced by want of time, want of due information, or by\r\nstrategical reasons, no such movement was made by him. The mutineers\r\nwould obviously cross the Jumna by the bridge of boats, and would then\r\npass southwestward into the city, or northwestward towards the\r\ncantonment, or possibly both. A necessity arose, therefore, for adopting\r\ndefensive measures in two different quarters; and as the non-military\r\nportion of the European inhabitants, especially women and children,\r\nwould be a source of much anxiety at such a time, the brigadier made\r\narrangements to accommodate them, or some of them, in the Flagstaff\r\nTower, a strong circular brick building on the heights near the\r\ncantonment, a mile and a half north of the nearest or Cashmere Gate of\r\nthe city. The military commandant ordered out his regiments, drew forth\r\nhis guns, and delivered a pithy address, in which he exhorted the sepoys\r\nto stand true to their colours, and repel the mutineers as soon as they\r\nshould appear. His address was received with cheers, the insincerity of\r\nwhich was soon to be made manifest.\r\n\r\nSo many Europeans were cut and shot down at Delhi on this day of misery,\r\nand so precipitate was the escape of others, that not one single person\r\nwas in a position to give a connected narrative of the dismal work.\r\nStartling, indeed, were the sights and the sounds which riveted the\r\nattention of the European inhabitants on this morning. A peaceful Sunday\r\nhad passed over in its ordinary way; for none knew what were the deeds\r\nbeing perpetrated at Meerut. The native troops, it is true, were to some\r\nextent cognizant of that movement, for the insurgents had unquestionably\r\narranged the outlines of a plan; and some of the European officers at\r\nDelhi had observed, not without uneasiness, a change in the behaviour of\r\nthe sepoys at that station; nevertheless, to the Europeans generally,\r\nthis social avalanche was a wholly unexpected visitation. Resistance was\r\nneeded from those too powerless to resist effectually; and flight was\r\nthe only resource for many too weak, too young, too sick, to bear up\r\nunder such a necessity. All the letters, since made public, relating to\r\nthe sad events of that day, tend to shew how little the European\r\ninhabitants of Delhi looked forward to such scenes. One lady, after a\r\nhurried retreat, said: ‘We can hardly ourselves believe how we escaped.\r\nThe way in which poor helpless men, women, and children were slaughtered\r\nwithout a moment’s warning was most dreadful. We were surprised on the\r\nmorning of the 11th of May (baby’s birthday) by a party of mutineers\r\nfrom Meerut.’ It is evident that ‘baby’s birthday’ had dawned with much\r\nhappier thoughts in the poor mother’s mind, than were destined to remain\r\nthere. Another lady, with her husband and child, were just about to\r\nleave Delhi for Calcutta; their dâk-passage was paid, and their\r\ntravelling arrangements nearly completed. Suddenly a messenger hastened\r\nto their home to announce that the Meerut mutineers had crossed the\r\nbridge, and were within the city walls; and very soon afterwards,\r\nfearful sights told them that immediate escape was the only mode of\r\nsaving their lives. So it was all over the city; terror and blood began\r\nthe week, instead of peace and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe train of circumstances, as we have just said, having involved either\r\nthe death or the hasty flight of nearly all the English within the city\r\nand the cantonment, it follows that the narrative of the day’s ruthless\r\nwork must be constructed from materials derived from various quarters,\r\neach supplying some of the links. When Major Abbott of the 74th found\r\nhimself, on the next day, the senior officer among those who escaped to\r\nMeerut, he deemed it his duty to write an account to Major-general\r\nHewett of the proceedings, so far as his sad tale could tell them. With\r\nthis we begin.\r\n\r\nThe city, according to Major Abbott’s narrative, was entered first by a\r\nsmall number of the mutinous 3d native cavalry, who crossed by the\r\nbridge of boats. While proceeding westward, they were met by a wing of\r\nthe 54th native infantry, under the command of Colonel Ripley. But here\r\na serious symptom at once presented itself; the 54th excused themselves\r\nfrom firing on the mutineers, on the plea of their muskets not being\r\nloaded; the guard of the 38th native infantry likewise refused, on some\r\npretence, to fire; and thus the insurgents were enabled to enter the\r\ncity by the Cashmere Gate. Captain Wallis, the field-officer of the\r\nweek, on ordering the men of the mainguard at the gate to wheel up and\r\nfire, was met by insulting jeers; and he only desisted from importuning\r\nthem when he found the work of death going on in other quarters. Six\r\nBritish officers of the 54th speedily fell, either killed or\r\nwounded—namely, Colonel Ripley, Captains Smith and Burrowes, Lieutenants\r\nEdwardes, Waterfield, and Butler. Major Abbott, willing to hope that his\r\nown regiment, the 74th, was still faithful, hastened to the cantonment,\r\ngot as many of his men together as he could, and explained to them that\r\nthe time was come to shew their fidelity as true soldiers: he announced\r\nhis intention to go down to the Cashmere Gate, and called for volunteers\r\nto follow him. All for a while went favourably; the men stepped up to\r\nthe front, loaded promptly, and marched off briskly after the major. On\r\narriving at the Cashmere Gate, the 74th took possession of the\r\nmainguard, drawn up in readiness to receive any attack that might be\r\nmade. Affairs remained quiet near that gate until towards three o’clock,\r\nwhen a heavy firing of guns, followed by a terrific explosion, announced\r\nthat fighting had been going on near the magazine, and that a vast store\r\nof ammunition had been blown into the air. Whether this explosion had\r\nbeen caused by friends or enemies was not at first known; but the news\r\nsoon spread abroad that a gallant artillery-officer, Lieutenant\r\nWilloughby, had adopted this terrible mode of preventing an enormous\r\nsupply of warlike material from falling into the hands of the\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the narrative of events in the city, it will be\r\nnecessary to describe more particularly the occurrence last adverted to.\r\nThere were two magazines, one near the cantonment, and a much larger and\r\nmore important one in the city. It was the last named that became the\r\nscene of such desperate work. This magazine was an enclosure of\r\nconsiderable size, about midway between the Selimgurh Fort and the\r\nCashmere Gate, almost close to the British residency. As a storehouse\r\nfilled with a greater quantity of guns, gunpowder, and ammunition, than\r\nany other place in India, a struggle for its possession between the\r\nBritish and the insurgents became inevitable: hence it arose that the\r\ndestruction of the magazine was an achievement worthy of record, no less\r\nfor its vast importance in relation to the ultimate fate of the city,\r\nthan for the cool heroism that marked its planning and execution. The\r\nmagazine contained no less than three hundred guns and mortars, twenty\r\nthousand stand of arms, two hundred thousand shot and shell, and other\r\nwarlike stores. Lieutenant Willoughby was himself too severely wounded\r\nby the explosion to write; but the details of this gallant affair have\r\nbeen very exactly given by Lieutenant G. Forrest, who was\r\nassistant-commissary of ordnance in Delhi at the time. Between seven and\r\neight o’clock in the morning of this eventful day, Sir Theophilus\r\nMetcalfe, one of the civil servants of the Company, residing between the\r\ncity and the cantonment, came to the lieutenant, and requested him to go\r\nto the magazine for the purpose of planting two guns on the bridge, as a\r\nmeans of barring the passage of the mutineers. Arrived at the magazine,\r\nthey met Lieutenants Willoughby and Raynor, and several officers and\r\nprivates of the ordnance establishment. The three principals went to the\r\nsmall bastion on the river-face, commanding a full view of the bridge;\r\nthere they could distinctly see the mutineers marching in open columns,\r\nheaded by their cavalry; and they also saw that the Delhi side of the\r\nbridge was already in the possession of a smaller body of horse. Any\r\nattempt to close or guard the city-gates was found to be too late; for\r\nthe mutineers were admitted, with great cheering, into the gate of the\r\npalace. Lieutenant Willoughby, seeing the critical state of affairs,\r\nreturned quickly to the magazine, closed and barricaded the gates, and\r\nprepared for defence. Conductor Crow and Sergeant Stewart were placed\r\nnear one of the gates, with lighted matches in their hands, in command\r\nof two six-pounders double-charged with grape, which they were ordered\r\nto fire if any attempt were made to force the gate from without. The\r\nprincipal gate of the magazine was similarly defended by two guns, with\r\n_chevaux-de-frise_ laid down on the inside. There were five other\r\nsix-pounders, and a twenty-four pounder howitzer, quickly placed at such\r\nspots as might render them more readily available for defence—all\r\ndouble-loaded with grape-shot. A more doubtful task was that of arming\r\nthe native artillerymen or ordnance servants within the magazine; for\r\nthey were in a state, not only of excitement, but of insubordination,\r\nmuch more inclined to aid the assailants without than the defenders\r\nwithin. This arming being effected so far as was practicable, a train of\r\ngunpowder was laid down from the magazine to a distant spot; and it was\r\nagreed that, on Lieutenant Willoughby giving the order, Conductor\r\nBuckley should raise his hat as a signal to Conductor Scully to fire the\r\ntrain and blow up the magazine with all its contents. Having done all\r\nthat a cool and circumspect leader could do to prepare for the worst,\r\nLieutenant Willoughby awaited the issue. Very soon, mutinous sepoys—or\r\nrather the palace guards, who had not until that hour been mutinous—came\r\nand demanded possession of the magazine, _in the name of the King of\r\nDelhi_! No answer being vouchsafed to this demand, scaling-ladders were\r\nsent from the palace, and placed against the wall of the magazine. This\r\ndecided the wavering of the native artillerymen; they all as with one\r\naccord deserted, climbed up to the sloping roofs on the inside of the\r\nmagazine, and descended the ladders to the outside. The insurgents now\r\nappearing in great numbers on the top of the walls, the little band of\r\nEuropeans commenced a brisk fire of grape-shot, which worked much\r\nmischief among the enemy; although only nine in number, they kept\r\nseveral hundred men at bay. At last, the stock of grape at hand was\r\nexhausted, and the beleaguered garrison was shot at instead of shooting:\r\nseeing that none could run to the storehouses for more grape-shot\r\nwithout leaving to the mutineers freedom of entry by leaping from the\r\nwalls. Two of the small number being wounded, and the impossibility of\r\nlonger holding out being apparent, Lieutenant Willoughby gave the\r\nsignal; whereupon Conductor Scully instantly fired the train. An awful\r\nexplosion followed, amid the din and confusion of which, all who were\r\nnot too much injured made their way out of the sally-port, to escape in\r\nthe best manner they could. What was the number of insurgents killed and\r\nwounded by the grape-shot discharges and by the explosion, no one knew;\r\nsome of the English officers estimated it at more than a thousand. It\r\nwas at the time hoped by the authorities that the whole of the vast\r\nstore of ammunition had been blown into the air, beyond the reach of the\r\nmutineers; but subsequent events shewed that the destruction was not so\r\ncomplete.[9]\r\n\r\nTo return to the agitating scenes within the city. Major Abbott,\r\nimmediately on hearing of the explosion at the magazine, found himself\r\nplaced in a painful position: urged to different courses by different\r\npersons, and doubtful how long his own regiment would remain faithful.\r\nHe was requested by the commandant to send back two guns to the\r\ncantonment, as a means of defence; while, on the other hand, he was\r\nentreated by Major Paterson, and by the civil collector who had charge\r\nof the treasury, to retain his small force for guarding the various\r\ngovernment establishments within the city. Major Abbott listened to this\r\nlatter suggestion for a time, but then made arrangements for sending off\r\nthe two guns to the cantonment. By this time, however, he found it was\r\nof little consequence what orders he gave: the native troops were fast\r\ngetting beyond his control. The two guns, and some men of the 38th\r\nregiment, returned; the gunners had deserted on the road, and the guns\r\nhad therefore been brought back again. A few of the native officers who\r\nwere still faithful now importuned him to leave the city as soon as\r\npossible; he at first interpreted their request as an advice to hasten\r\nto defend the cantonment; but soon found that it bore relation to his\r\nown safety. Presently he heard shots whizzing in the mainguard. He asked\r\nwhat they meant, and was told: ‘The 38th are shooting the European\r\nofficers.’ He then ordered about a hundred of his men to hasten with him\r\nto the rescue; but they replied: ‘Sir, it is useless. They are all\r\nkilled by this time, and we shall not save any one. We have saved you,\r\nand we are happy; we will not allow you to go back and be murdered.’ The\r\nhistory of the Revolt presented many such incidents as this; in every\r\nnative regiment there were some men who wished to remain faithful, and\r\nsome officers who were favourites among them. The sepoys formed a ring\r\nround the major, and hurried him on foot along the road leading to the\r\ncantonment. He stopped some time at the quarter-guard, and sent a\r\nmessenger to the saluting tower to obtain information of the proceedings\r\nin other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now setting, and evening approaching, giving omen of a night\r\nof danger and difficulty. Major Abbott espied two or three carriages\r\nbelonging to officers of his own regiment, going northward on the road\r\nto Kurnaul; and on inquiry, he was told by the men at the quarter-guard:\r\n‘Sir, they are leaving the cantonment; pray follow their example. We\r\nhave protected you so far; but it will be impossible for us to do so\r\nmuch longer. Pray fly for your life!’ Willing as he was to remain at his\r\npost to the last, the major felt that the men around him were so far\r\nfaithful as to deserve credence for what they had just uttered; and that\r\nhis own life, if now taken, would be sacrificed without in any way\r\ncontributing towards the retention of Delhi in British hands. He\r\ntherefore replied: ‘Very well; I am off to Meerut. Bring the colours;\r\nand let me see as many of you at Meerut as are not inclined to become\r\ntraitors.’ Major Abbott and Captain Hawkey now mounted one horse and\r\nstarted off after the carriages. They overtook some guns going the same\r\nroad; but after a progress of four miles, the drivers refused to go any\r\nfurther, and insisted on driving the guns back again to Delhi. The\r\nofficers, thus entirely deserted by the native troops, having no\r\nEuropean troops with or near them, and being powerless to effect any\r\ngood, rode or drove off to seek safety in other directions.\r\n\r\nMajor Abbott afterwards learned at what point in the day’s proceedings\r\nhis own regiment, the 74th, first broke out in mutiny. As soon as the\r\nexplosion of the magazine was heard, he ordered Captain Gordon to take a\r\ncompany with him, to see whether he could render any aid in that\r\nquarter; the captain found, however, not only that his aid would be\r\nuseless, but that his men exhibited great unwillingness to move.\r\nSomewhat later, several officers of the 74th were about to march out\r\nwith a detachment, when a ball whistled among them: Captain Gordon fell\r\ndead. Another ball was heard, and Lieutenant Revely was laid low. It now\r\nbecame a matter of life and death: each officer, without any imputation\r\nof selfishness, looking after his own safety. Among others, Ensign Elton\r\nmade for the bastion of the fort, jumped over the parapet, descended\r\ninto the ditch, clambered up the counterscarp on the other side, ran\r\nacross the country to the cantonment, and then followed the road which\r\nmany of the other officers had taken. Captain Tytler, Captain Nicoll,\r\nand some others, went towards Kurnaul; Major Abbott, Captains Hawkey and\r\nWallace, Lieutenant Aislabie, Ensign Elton, and Farrier-sergeant Law,\r\ntook the Kurnaul road for some distance, and then struck off on the\r\nright to Meerut, where they arrived at eight o’clock in the evening of\r\nTuesday the 12th—thirty-six hours after the mutineers from Meerut had\r\nreached Delhi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Escape from Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter stating that almost all the European inhabitants of Delhi had been\r\nmurdered, except those who had at once been able to effect their escape,\r\nMajor Abbott thus expressed the opinion which he formed during these two\r\ndays of terrible excitement, concerning the successive steps of the\r\nmutiny at Delhi: ‘From all I could glean, there is not the slightest\r\ndoubt that this insurrection has been originated and matured in the\r\npalace of the King of Delhi, with his full knowledge and sanction, in\r\nthe mad attempt to establish himself in the sovereignty of this country.\r\nIt is well known that he has called on the neighbouring states to\r\nco-operate with him in thus trying to subvert the existing government.\r\nThe method he adopted appears to have been to gain the sympathy of the\r\n38th light infantry, by spreading the lying reports now going through\r\nthe country, of the government having it in contemplation to upset their\r\nreligion, and have them all forcibly inducted to Christianity. The 38th,\r\nby insidious and false arguments, quietly gained over the 54th and 74th\r\nnative infantry, each being unacquainted with the other’s real\r\nsentiments. I am perfectly persuaded that the 54th and 74th were forced\r\nto join the combination by threats that the 38th and 54th would\r\nannihilate the 74th if they refused; or, _vice versâ_, that the 38th and\r\n74th would annihilate the 54th. I am almost convinced that had the 38th\r\nnot been on guard at the Cashmere Gate, the results would have been very\r\ndifferent; the men of the 74th would have shot down every man who had\r\nthe temerity to assail the post.’ It may be that this officer, anxious\r\nto lessen the dishonour of his own regiment, viewed somewhat too\r\npartially the relative merits of the native troops; but it is\r\nunquestionable that the 74th remained faithful much longer than the\r\n38th. To what extent the King of Delhi was really implicated, neither\r\nMajor Abbott nor any other Englishman could at that time correctly tell.\r\n\r\nIt was not during the dire confusion of this terrible day that the\r\ncourse of events in the streets and buildings of Delhi could be fully\r\nknown. The facts came to light one by one afterwards. When the 3d Bengal\r\ntroopers, who preceded the mutinous infantry in the march from Meerut,\r\narrived at the Jumna about seven in the morning, they killed the\r\ntoll-keeper of the bridge of boats, took the money found in his office,\r\nand crossed the bridge. Arrived in Delhi, they hastened to the royal\r\npalace, where they made some sort of announcement of their arrival and\r\nits purport. Mr Simon Fraser, the commissioner for Delhi, Captain\r\nDouglas, his assistant, and one or two other officials, hearing of this\r\nmovement, and seeing the approach of insurgent infantry on the other\r\nside of the river, hastened to the palace to watch the conduct of the\r\nroyal personages at such a suspicious time. No sooner did they enter the\r\npalace precincts, however, than they were shot down. Shortly afterwards,\r\nthe Rev. Mr Jennings, chaplain of the residency, was killed; as were\r\nlikewise his daughter and another lady near him—after, it is to be\r\nfeared, atrocities worse than death. It was seen that the insurgent\r\ntroopers were in a state of the greatest excitement and fury, as if they\r\nhad worked themselves up, by indulgence in the intoxicating _bang_, to a\r\nlevel with their terrible plans. While the military operations, already\r\nnoticed, were going on at the Cashmere Gate, the magazine, and the\r\ncantonment, all the ruffians of Delhi and the neighbouring villages,\r\neager for _loot_ or plunder, joined the insurgents. Every European\r\nresidence was searched: the troopers and sepoys seeking the lives of the\r\ninmates; while the rabble followed, and swept off every shred of\r\nproperty. Bungalows were fired one by one, until glaring sheets of flame\r\nwere visible in every direction. Bands of Goojurs—a kind of Hindoo gipsy\r\ntribe—were lying in wait after nightfall all along the line of road\r\ntwenty miles out of Delhi, on the watch for refugees. It was a day of\r\njubilee for all the miscreants; they did not stay their hands when the\r\nEuropeans had been pillaged, but attacked the houses of all the Hindoo\r\nbankers, carrying off great treasure. Some of the Europeans concealed\r\nthemselves for a time within the palace gardens—a vain refuge, for they\r\nwere all detected, tied to trees in a row, and shot or sabred by the\r\nmutineers. Many of the troopers, during the savage scenes of these days,\r\npointed to the marks of manacles on their ankles; they were of the\r\neighty-five who had been put in irons at Meerut on the preceding\r\nSaturday; and they now shewed how deep was the revenge which they\r\nintended to take for that degrading punishment. The military officers\r\nand their families were, from various causes, those whose fate became\r\nmore publicly known; but the number of civil servants, Christians of\r\nhumble grade, and half-castes, put to death, was very great. The\r\nbank-clerks, with their wives and children, were murdered; and similar\r\nscenes occurred at most of the public offices.\r\n\r\nMr Farrington, deputy-commissioner, when at Jullundur two or three weeks\r\nafterwards, received a written account from a native of the occurrences\r\nat Delhi during the days immediately following the Revolt—an account\r\nconsidered worthy of credence. A part of this narrative comprised the\r\nfollowing sad tale: ‘On the third day they [the mutineers] went to a\r\nhouse near the mosque where some Europeans had taken refuge. As they\r\nwere without water, &c., they called for a subadar and five others, and\r\nasked them to take their oaths that they would give them water, and take\r\nthem alive to the king: he might kill them, if he liked. On this oath,\r\nthe Europeans came out: the mutineers placed water before them, and\r\nsaid: “Lay down your arms, and then you get water.” They gave over two\r\nguns, all they had. The mutineers gave no water. They seized eleven\r\nchildren—among them infants—eight ladies, and eight gentlemen. They took\r\nthem to the cattle-sheds. One lady, who seemed more self-possessed than\r\nthe rest, observed that they were not taking them to the palace; they\r\nreplied they were taking them by the way of Duryagunge (one of the gates\r\non the river-side of the city). Deponent says that he saw all this, and\r\nsaw them placed in a row and shot. One woman entreated to give her child\r\nwater, though they might kill her. A sepoy took her child, and dashed it\r\non the ground. The people looked on in dismay, and feared for Delhi.’\r\nThe imagination can, too truly, alas! fill up the deficient incidents in\r\nthis tale of treachery. Mr Farrington deemed his informant worthy of\r\nreliance. He said: ‘The man has been with me. He speaks frankly, and\r\nwithout fear. He is able, evidently, to narrate many a harrowing tale;\r\nbut I did not wish to hear any. He seemed really to recall with dismay\r\nwhat he had witnessed.’\r\n\r\nThe aged but wretched king of Delhi—wretched in having the hopes of\r\nearlier years revived, only to be crushed again—for a time distrusted\r\nthe mutineers; he entertained misgivings that all might not end well.\r\nThe shops and bazaars were being plundered; the king was in the palace;\r\nand some of those around him urged that order could be restored only by\r\nhis assumption of the imperial purple. After three or four days, he went\r\nin a kind of state through the city, advising or commanding the people\r\nto re-open their shops, and resume their former commercial\r\ndealings—advice more easily given than acted upon; for the devastation\r\nhad been terrible, striking grief into the more peaceful portion of the\r\nnative inhabitants. The king assumed command in the city; he named Mirza\r\nMogul commander-in-chief, and gave the title of general of cavalry to\r\nMirza Abu Bukur; he collected around him eight or nine thousand\r\nmutineers and volunteers, who were posted at the several gates of the\r\ncity, or cantoned in the Duryagunge Bazaar. Additional guns were placed\r\non the ramparts; and the native sappers and miners were placed in\r\ncommand of the cannon in the old fort of Selimgurh. The Company’s\r\ntreasury, one of the largest in India, is said to have been respected by\r\nthe mutineers to this extent—that they did not appropriate it among\r\nthemselves as spoil, but guarded it as belonging to their newly chosen\r\nleader, the King of Delhi. To shew how perplexed the Calcutta government\r\nmust have been at the first news of these events, it may be mentioned\r\nthat the king’s name was adverted to as that of a friend rather than an\r\nenemy. On the 14th of May, three days after the arrival of the Meerut\r\nmutineers at Delhi, Mr Colvin, lieutenant-governor of the Northwest\r\nProvinces, telegraphed from Agra to the governor-general as follows: ‘We\r\nhave authentic intelligence in a letter from the king that the town and\r\nfort of Delhi, _and his own person_, are in the hands of the insurgent\r\nregiments of the place, which joined about one hundred of the troops\r\nfrom Meerut and opened the gates.’ Judged by the ordinary rules of\r\nprobability, it would appear that the mutineers first secured the person\r\nof the king, and then compelled him to head them: the old man being\r\nfurther urged by the entreaties and threats of his intriguing sons and\r\ngrandsons. It is difficult, under any other supposition, to account for\r\nhis transmission of a message of information and warning to the chief\r\nBritish authority in those regions. On the 15th Mr Colvin sent a further\r\ntelegraphic communication to Calcutta, containing this information: ‘The\r\nrebels have declared the heir-apparent king. They are apparently\r\norganising the plan of a regular government; they still remain in the\r\nplace. Their policy is supposed to be to annex the adjoining districts\r\nto their newly formed kingdom. They are not likely, therefore, to\r\nabandon the country or leave Delhi; they have probably strengthened\r\nthemselves there. They may have secured fifty lacs of rupees [half a\r\nmillion sterling].’ No further mention was here made of the old man; it\r\nwas a younger relation who had been set up as king; and this younger\r\nprince may possibly have been the one whom the Marquis of Dalhousie had\r\ninsisted should be the heir-apparent, with such prospective limitations\r\nof authority as the Company might hereafter declare to be expedient. The\r\nordinary motives which influence men’s conduct would be quite strong\r\nenough to induce this prince to avail himself of any accidental or\r\nunexpected means of insuring the crown without the limitations here\r\nadverted to. Ambition was almost the only sentiment not absolutely\r\ndegrading left to the pensioned, sensual, intriguing dwellers in the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nThe details of this chapter have hitherto been confined chiefly to the\r\ncourse of events within the city—as collected from the dispatches of\r\nmilitary officers, the letters from commissioners and other civil\r\nservants of the Company, and the published statements of Europeans who\r\nsurvived the dangers of the day. But we now come to adventures which,\r\npolitically of less importance, touch more nearly the hearts and\r\nsympathies of those who would know how Englishmen, and more particularly\r\nEnglishwomen, bore up against the accumulated miseries that pressed upon\r\nthem. We have to accompany the fugitives to the fields and jungles, the\r\nditches and rivers, the swampy marshes and scorching sandy roads; we\r\nhave to see how they contended against privation and trial—on their way\r\nforty miles in one direction towards Meerut, or eighty miles in another\r\ntowards Kurnaul. Many of the narratives of the fugitives, afterwards\r\nmade public, supply details not furnished in any official dispatches;\r\nwhile they illustrate many points worth knowing—among others, the\r\ngreater hostility of the Mohammedan than the Hindoo natives near Delhi,\r\nand the indications of individual kindness in the midst of general\r\nbrutality. A selection from these narratives will suffice for the\r\npresent purpose, shortened and thrown into a different form so as to\r\nthrow light on each other, and on the general events of the day. In most\r\ncases, the names of the fugitives, especially of ladies, will be\r\nwithheld, from a motive which a considerate reader will easily\r\nappreciate. This scruple must not, however, be interpreted as affecting\r\nthe authenticity of the narratives, which was verified only too\r\nabundantly by collateral evidence.\r\n\r\nWe select first a family of three fugitives to Kurnaul. The wife of an\r\nofficer of the 54th native regiment, in the forenoon of this eventful\r\nMonday, hastened with her child to the Flagstaff Tower; where, in\r\naccordance with the advice of the brigadier-commandant, many other\r\nfamilies had assembled. The gentlemen remained outside on guard; the\r\nladies assisted in loading the guns, and in other services towards the\r\ncommon defence of all. Here they remained many hours, in all the horrors\r\nof suspense; for the husbands and fathers of many were away, and their\r\nfate unknown. At length came the news that the 38th had openly revolted;\r\nthat none of the native regiments at Delhi could now be depended upon;\r\nand that the inmates of the tower ought to effect their escape as\r\nspeedily as possible. There had been one company of the 38th at the\r\nFlagstaff Tower all day; and as the building was very strong, and armed\r\nwith two guns, the brigadier long deemed himself able to protect the\r\nnumerous persons there assembled; but as soon as the defection of the\r\nmain body of this regiment became known, all reliance on the smaller\r\ncorps was at an end. Such carriages and horses as could be obtained were\r\nimmediately put in requisition, and various parties hastened off, mostly\r\nnorthward on the Kurnaul road. The small group whom we have here under\r\nnotice—namely, the officer with his wife and child, reached Kurnaul the\r\nnext day; but danger was all around, and the fugitives were forced to\r\ncontinue their flight, as soon as they could obtain means of conveyance.\r\nIt is touching to read how ‘baby’ occupied the mother’s thoughts through\r\nall this agitating escape. During a sojourn at a place called\r\nThwanessur, on the road between Kurnaul and Umballa, they stopped at the\r\nassistant-commissioner’s house. ‘Before we had rested two hours we were\r\nalarmed by being told that a regiment of sepoys was come to attack us;\r\nwe had to fly from the house and hide as best we could, under the\r\nbushes, &c., in the garden; and I kept dear baby in my own arms the\r\nwhole time until morning.’ The alarm proved to be false, and the\r\nfugitives proceeded. They arrived safely at Umballa on the morning of\r\nThursday the 14th, having left Delhi on Monday evening. That the brave\r\nwife was ‘quite fatigued and worn out’ may well be conceived when she\r\nadds, ‘for dear baby had never left me since we left Delhi.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Delhi from Flagstaff Tower.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis adventure, however, was far exceeded in length, in privation, in\r\nstrange situations, in hair-breadth escapes, by one which befell a party\r\nof four persons—an officer of the 38th regiment, an army surgeon, and\r\ntheir two wives: all of whom, in the wilderness of confusion, sought the\r\nKurnaul route rather than that to Meerut. These ladies were among the\r\nmany who sought refuge in the Flagstaff Tower. There they had the pain\r\nof witnessing the sufferings of poor Colonel Ripley, who, as already\r\nnarrated, had been bayoneted by men of his own regiment, and had been\r\nbrought thither for succour; they tended him as women only can tend the\r\nsick; but their ministrations were of brief avail. After hours of\r\nsuspense, in which small hope was mingled with large despair, the\r\nnecessity for escape became obvious. A little bitterness is expressed,\r\nin the narratives of some of the fugitives, concerning the delay in\r\nmaking any preparations for the escape of the women and children; and a\r\nfew of the head officers are blamed for supineness; but those who suffer\r\nare not always, at the time, the best judges of the cause of their\r\nsufferings. When evening approached, many of the native coachmen drove\r\naway the vehicles belonging to the Europeans, and appropriated them,\r\nthus leaving the women and children in dreadful perplexity how to reach\r\nKurnaul or Meerut. The two Englishwomen whose narrative we now follow\r\nwere among the last of those who left the city, when evening was\r\napproaching. They were in a buggy, but had been parted from their\r\nhusbands during the confusion of the arrangements for departure, and one\r\nof them had lost her little child. They drove on, with no male\r\nprotector, across rugged fields, fearful of the high road: treated\r\nsometimes respectfully by the natives, but at other times robbed and\r\nvilely addressed. Even the velvet head-dress of one of them was torn\r\noff, for the value of the bugles that adorned it. A jewel-box had been\r\nbrought away in haste, as the only treasure preserved; and it became\r\nevery hour more uncertain whether this would be a prey to the spoilers.\r\nReturning to the high road, the ladies met some gunners with two guns;\r\nand as the men told them certain death would be the result if they took\r\nthe road to Kurnaul, they drove in another direction to the Company’s\r\ngarden outside Delhi. Here, marauding was everywhere going on; the poor\r\nladies soon had the misery of seeing their carriage, horse, jewel-box,\r\nand most of their outer clothing reft from them. In the dead of the\r\nnight they ventured to a neighbouring village. The surgeon, husband to\r\none of the ladies, here managed to join them; but being enfeebled by\r\nprevious sickness, and wounded in the jaw during the day’s exciting\r\ntroubles, he was powerless as a defender, and—far from being able to\r\nsuccour others—needed succour himself. During the next fifteen hours\r\nwere these three persons hiding in fields and huts, befriended by a few\r\nnatives, and conscious that roving sepoys were near, ready for murder or\r\npillage. Sallying forth again on the evening of Tuesday, they were\r\nspeedily stopped by six men, who robbed them of a further portion of\r\ntheir scanty apparel, and only stopped short of murder when the\r\nofficer’s wife pleaded for mercy, on the ground that she was searching\r\nfor her husband and her child, both of whom had gone she knew not\r\nwhither. The three fugitives walked all that night, the wounded surgeon\r\ndragging himself along. In the morning they were again accosted, and\r\nonly escaped death by the ladies yielding up a further part of their\r\nattire, the only property they had left to give. During the remainder of\r\nthat day they crept on, obtaining a little food and water from some\r\nvillagers, who were, however, too much afraid of the sepoys to afford\r\nthe fugitives the shelter of a roof; and it was terrible work indeed to\r\nroam along the roads with a burning sun overhead and burning sand under\r\nfoot. They sat down by a well-side, and drank some water; but rude\r\nfellows accosted them, and after insulting the hapless women, compelled\r\nthem to withdraw. They next encountered a party of irregular horse, who\r\nhad not yet joined the mutineers; the men were at first inclined to\r\nbefriend them; but fears of the consequences supervening, they soon\r\ndeserted the fugitives. Here were these two Englishwomen, gently\r\nnurtured, and accustomed to all the amenities of good society, again\r\ncompelled to wander like miserable outcasts, helping along a male\r\ncompanion whose under-jaw had been shattered, and who was otherwise in a\r\nweak state. They crawled on during another night, and then reached a\r\nvillage, which, as they saw it was Hindoo, they did not scruple to\r\nenter. Kindness was accorded to them for one whole day; after which the\r\nhumane natives, timid lest the sepoys should burn their village if they\r\nheard of Feringhees having been harboured, declared they could no longer\r\nafford shelter. Once more, therefore, were the fugitives driven forth:\r\nhaving seen renewed symptoms that the sepoys, or rather the marauding\r\nruffians, would not scruple to murder them, if opportunity offered. They\r\nhad now been five days wandering about, and yet were only ten miles\r\ndistant from Delhi: so completely had each day’s plans been frustrated\r\nby the events of the next day. Again they entered a friendly village,\r\nand again were they compelled soon to depart, after receiving simple but\r\nkind assistance. No villagers, it was found, were free from dread at\r\nhaving assisted a Feringhee. Once they hid for shelter under a bridge;\r\nbut an armed ruffian detected them, and behaved so unbearably towards\r\nthe women that the surgeon, who was a Roman Catholic, took a gold cross\r\nfrom his bosom, and gave it as the price of their freedom from further\r\nmolestation: a wounded, shattered, sinking man, he could not offer them\r\na strong arm as a shield from insult. On the night of the 17th, at a\r\nlittle more than twenty miles from Delhi, they were glad to obtain the\r\nshelter of an outhouse containing twenty cows, the only roof that the\r\nowner dared to offer them. They made an attempt to have a letter\r\nforwarded to Kurnaul, praying for assistance; but none in those parts\r\ncould be depended upon for faithfulness beyond an hour or two: so much\r\nwas there of treachery on the one hand, and timidity on the other. On\r\nthe 18th they heard that Major Paterson, of the 54th regiment, was in\r\nthe same village as themselves; and he, powerless to succour, contrived\r\nto send a short message to them, written with a burnt stick on a piece\r\nof an old broken pan. Shortly afterwards they were greatly astonished,\r\nand not a little delighted, to see an officer, the husband of one of the\r\nladies, enter the village; but more like a naked savage, blistered from\r\nhead to foot, than like an English gentleman.\r\n\r\nAn eventful tale had this officer to narrate. When the scenes of\r\nviolence on the 11th at Delhi had reached such a point that to remain\r\nlonger was to meet certain slaughter, he sent off his little boy with\r\nfriends towards Meerut, and saw his wife and her lady-companion start\r\nfor Kurnaul. After being robbed of his horse, and having three bullets\r\nsent through his hat, and one through the skirt of his coat, he ran past\r\nthe blazing houses of the cantonment, and, being ill at the time, sank\r\ndown under a tree exhausted. A gang of ruffians found him, stripped him,\r\nrobbed him of everything, and endeavoured, Thug-like, to strangle\r\nhim—using, however, the sleeve of his own shirt instead of a silken\r\ncord. Happily the choking was only partial; he recovered, staggered on a\r\nmile or two, rested briefly in a hut, and then walked twelve miles to\r\nAlipore in a broiling sun. He obtained a little water, a little bread,\r\nand a few fragments of clothing, but was refused shelter. He wended his\r\npainful way barefoot, keeping to ploughed fields as safer than the high\r\nroad, and reached a village where the headman gave him an asylum for\r\nfive days. During these days, however, he twice narrowly escaped death\r\nfrom sepoys prowling about the village. On the sixth he received\r\ninformation which led him to believe that his wife and her travelling\r\ncompanions were within six or seven miles of him. He hastened on, with\r\nswollen and blistered feet, wretched substitutes for raiment, and a\r\nframe nearly worn out by sickness and anxiety; but a gleam of joy burst\r\nupon him when at length he overtook the surgeon and the two wives,\r\nthough dismayed to see the plight to which they had been reduced. The\r\npoor ladies he found to be, like himself, reft of everything they had in\r\nthe world except a few torn and toil-worn fragments of garments. The\r\nsurgeon had been less rudely stripped, simply because the clothes of a\r\nwounded man were less acceptable to the spoliators. The fugitives, now\r\nfour in number, continued their journey, their feet pierced with thorns\r\nand sharp stones, and the difficulty of carrying or dragging a wounded\r\nman becoming greater and greater. The officer’s wife, having had no\r\nhead-covering for many days, felt the sun’s heat to be gradually\r\naffecting her brain; she was thankful when a villager gave her a wet\r\ncloth to bind round her temples. Matters now began to mend; the\r\nvillagers were less afraid of the Delhi sepoys; the vicinity of Kurnaul\r\nexhibited less violence and marauding; horses and mules were obtained on\r\none day to take them to Lursowlie; and on the next a carriage was\r\nprovided for their conveyance to Kurnaul. How they got on from Kurnaul\r\nto Umballa, and from Umballa to Simla, need not be told—the romance of\r\nthe incident was over when the three fugitives, two women and a wounded\r\nman, were joined by a fourth; although much physical and mental\r\nsuffering had still to be endured. The little son of this lady, it was\r\nafterwards found, had been carried by some friends safely to Meerut on\r\nthe 12th. The four fugitives, when they reached friendly quarters, were\r\npoor indeed: no beggars could be more completely dependent on the\r\nsympathy of those whom they now happily met.\r\n\r\nNext we will follow the steps of some of those who chose Meerut rather\r\nthan Kurnaul as their place of refuge. Their adventures partake of a new\r\ninterest, because there was a broad and swift river to be crossed. A\r\nyoung ensign of the 54th regiment, a stripling who had just commenced\r\nmilitary service under the Company, had a sad tale to tell, how the\r\nEuropean officers of his regiment had fallen almost to a man. He was in\r\nthe cantonment when the news arrived of the approach of the Meerut\r\nmutineers; his regiment was ordered to hasten to the city; and he, like\r\nother officers, was fain to hope that the men would remain true to their\r\ncolours. Leaving two companies to follow with two guns, the other eight\r\nmarched off to the city, distant, as has already been stated, about two\r\nmiles. Arriving at the mainguard of the Cashmere Gate, the regiment\r\nencountered the mutinous 3d Bengal cavalry, who immediately shot down\r\nnearly all the officers of the eight companies: the men of those\r\ncompanies shewing, by a refusal to defend their officers, that they were\r\nquite ready for revolt. The colonel, indeed, was bayoneted by one of his\r\nown men after a trooper had shot him. In about half an hour the other\r\ntwo companies arrived with the two guns; but as the few remaining\r\nofficers of the regiment knew not which of their men, if any, could be\r\ndepended on, they formed a kind of small fort or citadel of the\r\nmainguard, into which they brought their few remaining companions one by\r\none. The poor youth, who had just commenced soldiering, and who had\r\nnever seen a dead body, was nearly overwhelmed with grief at the sight\r\nof his brother-officers, with whom he had laughed and chatted a few\r\nhours before, lying side by side dead and mutilated. The main body of\r\nthe regiment remained sullen, though not mutinous, until about five\r\no’clock in the evening; but then the spirit of evil seemed to seize\r\nthem, and they turned upon the Europeans near them, shooting\r\nindiscriminately. The scene became agonising. Many women and children\r\nhad gone to the mainguard for security; and now they as well as the\r\nofficers found it necessary to flee for very life. Some ran, leaped,\r\nclomb, until they got beyond the wall of the city; others waited to help\r\nthose who were weaker or of more tender years. Some of the ladies,\r\nthough wounded, lowered themselves by handkerchiefs into the ditch, from\r\nembrasures in the parapet, and were caught by officers below; and then\r\nensued the terrible labour of dragging or carrying them up the\r\ncounterscarp on the other side of the ditch. (A ditch, in military\r\nmatters, be it remembered, is a dry, broad, very deep trench outside a\r\nfortified wall, with nearly vertical sides, called the scarp and\r\ncounterscarp.) The young officer tells how that he and his male\r\ncompanions would have made a dash towards Meerut, sword in hand, or have\r\nsold their lives at once; but that their chief thoughts were now for the\r\nwomen and children. What were the privations of such a company as this,\r\nin fords and jungles, in hunger and nakedness, we shall presently see by\r\nmeans of a narrative from another quarter.\r\n\r\nIt is an officer of the 38th who shall now tell his tale—how that his\r\nown personal troubles, when alone, were slight compared with those which\r\nhe had afterwards to bear in company with other fugitive Europeans. This\r\nofficer states that, while the refugees were anxiously watching the\r\ncourse of events at the Flagstaff Tower, they were momentarily expecting\r\naid from Meerut. They could not believe that Major-general Hewett would\r\nhave allowed the mutineers to march from Meerut to Delhi without either\r\nmaking an attempt to intercept them, or following on their heels; and\r\ntheir disappointment in this particular led to some of the unfavourable\r\ncomments made on that general’s line of conduct. The officer of the\r\n38th, whose narrative is now under notice, shared the difficulty of all\r\nthe others in endeavouring to keep the men at their duty; and he speaks\r\nof the terrible sight, more than once adverted to, which met his eye at\r\nthe mainguard inside the Cashmere Gate: ‘By the gate, side by side, and\r\ncovered by pretty ladies’ dresses taken from some house, as if in\r\nmockery, lay the bodies of poor Captain Smith, Burrowes, Edwardes, and\r\nWaterfield, and the quarter-master-sergeant; some lying calm as shot\r\ndead, and others with an expression of pain, mutilated by bayonets and\r\nswords.’ When all became hopeless within the city, and the brigadier had\r\ngiven orders to retire, the officers made a show of bringing off their\r\nregiments as well as their families; but it was only a show; for such of\r\nthe men as had remained faithful up to this time now fell away, and the\r\nEuropeans found themselves compelled to escape as best they could. The\r\nofficer hastened to the cantonment, disconsolate and helpless, but\r\nhaving no immediate idea of escape. With the colonel of the same\r\nregiment, however, he was urged to adopt that course, as the cantonment\r\nitself was now in a blaze. The two ran off in the dead of the night\r\ntowards the river, crouching beneath trees when enemies seemed near;\r\nthey forded the Jumna Canal, slaking their parched lips as they waded or\r\nswam; and they tore off the brighter parts of their glittering\r\naccoutrements, to prevent betrayal. In the morning, faint and hungered,\r\nthey took refuge in a hut while a body of sepoys was searching around,\r\nas if for victims. A few Hindoo peasants discovering them, told them\r\nwhere they could hide in a tope of trees, and brought them chupatties\r\nand milk. Being able to ford across a narrow branch of the Jumna soon\r\nafterwards, they concealed themselves in the wild jungle; and there, to\r\ntheir joy and surprise, they found others of their friends in the same\r\nkind of concealment—joy damped, it is true, at the thought of educated\r\nEnglish men and women crouching among long jungle-grass like savages or\r\nwild beasts. On counting numbers, they found they were thirteen, eight\r\ngentlemen and five ladies and children; and as they had several guns and\r\nswords among them, they took heart, and prepared to struggle against\r\nfurther difficulties.\r\n\r\nTo bring up the two parallel threads of the story, the escapes of the\r\nlarger party, comprising the women and little ones, must now be told. In\r\nthe afternoon of the preceding day, after arrangements had been made for\r\nconveying the ladies on gun-carriages from the city to the cantonment,\r\nthe natives who had been trusted with this duty turned faithless, and\r\nthe Europeans within the Cashmere Gate, finding themselves shot at,\r\nsought to escape beyond the walls in any way they could. One after\r\nanother, women and children as well as men, leaped over into the ditch,\r\nscrambled up the other side, and ran off towards the house of Sir T.\r\nMetcalfe. One lady, the mother of three daughters who had to share in\r\nthe flight, was shot through the shoulder, yet still kept on. The native\r\nservants—in the absence of their master, who afterwards had his own tale\r\nto tell of jungle-life and narrow escapes—gave them a little food; but\r\njust before the house was about being fired by the insurgents, the\r\nfugitives left it, and succeeded in fording the narrow stream to the\r\nspot mentioned above. When the thirteen had told their adventures, and\r\nformed a plan, they started anew, and sought a spot where they could\r\nford the majestic Jumna. The officer must here tell the story of this\r\nperilous fording: ‘Our hearts failed, and no wonder, where ladies were\r\nconcerned, as we looked at the broad swift river. It was getting dark,\r\ntoo. Two natives went across. We watched them anxiously wade a\r\nconsiderable portion of the river; then their heads alone appeared above\r\nwater. It was our only chance of life, and our brave ladies never\r\nflinched. The water was so deep, that where a tall man would wade, a\r\nshort man would be drowned. I thought it was all over when, on reaching\r\nthe deep water with Mrs —— on my left arm, a native supporting her on\r\nthe other side, we were shot [drifted] down the river; however, by\r\ndesperate efforts and the assistance of another native, we reached the\r\nbank in safety. I swam back once more for another of our party; and so\r\nultimately we all got safe over. It was a brave feat for our ladies to\r\ndo.’ But so it was throughout these terrific scenes: the heroism, the\r\npatience, the long-suffering endurance of these gentlewomen, bore up to\r\nthe last; feebleness of frame was vanquished by nobility of spirit; and\r\nthe men were often kept in heart, though deeply pained, by the\r\nuncomplaining perseverance of their gentle companions in misery. Our\r\nfugitives passed a wretched night after this fording of the Jumna,\r\ncrouching in the jungle, with no sound ‘but the chattering of their\r\nteeth.’ The next day threw them into the hands of a large band of\r\nruffians; and as the guns of the officers had been rendered useless by\r\nwet, the consequence was direful: the whole party were stripped and\r\nrobbed, and then left without food, without clothing, without resource,\r\nto wander whither they could. With naked feet, and skins blistering in\r\nthe sun, they toiled on. ‘How the ladies stood it,’ says the officer\r\nwhose narrative we are following, ‘is marvellous; they never murmured or\r\nflinched, or distressed us by a show of terror.’ Fortunately, a fakeer,\r\nin a Hindoo village, ventured to give them shelter; they remained three\r\ndays, obtaining a little food, but nothing more. A German zemindar or\r\nlandowner, who had been so long in India as to be hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom a Hindoo, hearing of their plight, sent for them, gave them some\r\nrough cloth to huddle on as substitutes for garments, and caused a\r\nmessage to be sent to Meerut, which brought relief to them; and they\r\nreached that town in seven days after leaving Delhi—worn out in mind and\r\nbody, haggard, lame, penniless, but thankful that their lives had been\r\nspared.\r\n\r\nStrange as these escapes and perils were, they were eclipsed in\r\nindividual daring and fertility of resource by one which remains to be\r\ntold, and which may form the last of this little group of painful\r\nnarratives. Mr Batson, surgeon of the 74th regiment, was unheard of\r\nduring so long a time after the events at Delhi on the fatal Monday that\r\nhe was given up for lost; but in a letter which he wrote to announce his\r\nsafety, he detailed such a series of adventures as appear to belong\r\nrather to romance than to real life—Defoe-like, but entirely true\r\ninstead of fictitious. And here it may be again remarked that these\r\nnarratives must not be suspected of boastful exaggeration; there were\r\nlinks which connected all the eventful stories into one chain—each\r\nreceiving corroborative strength from the others. Mr Batson states that\r\nwhen it was found that the three regiments at Delhi refused to act\r\nagainst the mutineers from Meerut, and that when such of the women and\r\nchildren as could be collected were placed in the mainguard and the\r\nFlagstaff Tower, he went to Brigadier Graves, volunteering to convey a\r\nletter to Meerut, in hope of obtaining the aid of European troops. His\r\noffer being accepted, he took leave of his wife and three daughters in\r\nthe Flagstaff Tower, went to his house, dressed himself like a native\r\nfakeer or mendicant devotee, and coloured his face, hands, and feet. Off\r\nhe set on his perilous errand. He first tried to cross the Jumna by the\r\nbridge of boats, but found it broken. Then he ran to the cantonment, and\r\nendeavoured to cross by a ferry near that spot, but found the insurgent\r\ncavalry and the neighbouring villagers plundering and marauding. Next he\r\nhastened across the parade-ground, and, after escaping two or three\r\nshots, was seized by some of the villagers and stripped of every bit of\r\nhis fakeer clothing. On he ran again, in his now truly forlorn state,\r\ntowards the Kurnaul road, hoping to overtake some of the officers who\r\nwere escaping by that route; but before he could do so, two of the\r\ninsurgent troopers intercepted him. Just as they were about to cut him\r\ndown with their drawn swords, his tact and knowledge saved him. Being\r\nfamiliar both with the Hindostani language and with the Mohammedan\r\ncustoms, he threw himself into a supplicating position, and uttered the\r\nmost exalted praises of the great Prophet of Islam: begging them to\r\nspare his life for the sake of the Moslem. Had his assailants been\r\ninfantry sepoys, he would probably not have attempted this manœuvre, for\r\nmost of them were Hindoos; but knowing that the cavalry sowars were\r\nchiefly Mohammedans, he made the venture. It succeeded. Whether they\r\nknew him as a fugitive Englishman, is not certain; but they let him go,\r\nsaying: ‘Had you not asked for mercy in the name of the Prophet, you\r\nshould have died like the rest of the Kaffirs [infidels].’ After running\r\nanother mile—at once shivering with nakedness and burning with\r\nexcitement—he encountered some Mussulman villagers, who rushed upon him,\r\ncrying: ‘Here is a Feringhee; kill the Kaffir! You Feringhees want to\r\nmake us all Christians!’ They dragged him to a village, tied his hands\r\nbehind him, and sent one of their number to a house hard by to get a\r\nsword, with which to despatch him. At this critical moment some\r\nexcitement—the nature of which Mr Batson could not understand—caused\r\nthem all to leave him, and he ran off again. He fortunately fell in with\r\nsome smiths who had been employed in the Delhi magazine, and who were\r\nwilling to save him; they urged him not to go forward, or the villagers\r\nwould certainly murder him. They took him to a hut, gave him an article\r\nor two of apparel, and fed him with milk and bread. He tried to sleep,\r\nbut could not; he lay awake all night, restless and excited. In the\r\nmorning he bethought him of informing his protectors that he was a\r\nphysician, a doctor, a ‘medicine-man;’ and this proved to be an aid to\r\nhim; for the villagers, finding that he could answer questions relating\r\nto maladies, and was familiar with their religion, language, and\r\ncustoms, began to take much interest in the Feringhee doctor. He found\r\nthat two officers were in hiding at no great distance, but he could\r\nreach neither of them. To get to Meerut in time to deliver his message\r\nwas of course now out of the question: all that Mr Batson could do was\r\nto secure his own safety. More perils were in store for him. The\r\nvillagers of Badree were informed that if they harboured any Feringhees,\r\nthe now triumphant King of Delhi would direfully punish them; they\r\nbecame alarmed, and hid him in a small mango tope. ‘Here,’ the surgeon\r\nsays, ‘I was left night and day alone. I was visited at night by some\r\none or other of the villagers, who brought me bread and water in a\r\nghurrah. I am unable to describe my feelings during this trying time. I\r\nwas all day in the sun, in the extreme heat, and alone at night, when\r\nthe jackals came prowling about and crying. It is only God and myself\r\nknow what I have endured. After five nights and days in this tope of\r\ntrees, I was again taken back to the village and concealed in a bhoosa\r\nhouse. I was here shut in for twenty-four hours; the heat and\r\nsuffocation I cannot find language to describe. I do not know which was\r\nthe greatest misery, the tope of trees in solitude or the bhoosa\r\nkotree.’ At length the villagers, afraid to keep him any longer,\r\ndismissed him—enabling him to dress himself up again as a fakeer.\r\nTramping on from village to village, he acted his part so well as to\r\nescape detection. He gave himself out as a Cashmerian; and although one\r\nof the villagers suspected his European origin by his blue eyes, he did\r\nnot betray him. He observed from village to village—and the fact is\r\nworthy of note in relation to the causes and details of the Revolt—that\r\nthe Mohammedans were much more savage than the Hindoos in their\r\nexpressions and threats against the Feringhees. The further he proceeded\r\nfrom Delhi, the less did Mr Batson find himself involved in danger; and\r\nhe was fortunately picked up by Captain M^cAndrews and Lieutenant Mew of\r\nhis own regiment. He had been out no less than twenty-five days,\r\nwandering from village to village, from tope to tope; suffering\r\nprivations which none but himself could know, and not even he adequately\r\ndescribe. One great anxiety gnawed him the while—the fate of his family:\r\none great joy awaited him—his family escaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Elephant and State Howdah.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere this chapter may close. We have seen that on the morning of Monday\r\nthe 11th of May, the European inhabitants of Delhi arose from their beds\r\nin peace; and that by the close of the same day there was not a single\r\nindividual of the number whose portion was not death, flight, or\r\nterrified concealment. So far as the British rule or influence was\r\nconcerned, it was at an end. The natives remained masters of the\r\nsituation; their white rulers were driven out; and a reconquest,\r\ncomplete in all its details, could alone restore British rule in Delhi.\r\nAt what time, in what way, and by whom, that reconquest was effected,\r\nwill remain to be told in a later portion of this work. Much remains to\r\nbe narrated before Delhi will again come under notice.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  _Quarterly Review_, No. 204.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Rightly did the governor-general, when officially informed of this\r\n  achievement, speak of ‘the noble and cool soldiership of the gallant\r\n  defenders’ of the magazine: ‘The governor-general in council desires\r\n  to offer his cordial thanks to Lieutenants Raynor and Forrest, and the\r\n  other survivors among the brave men mentioned in this report, and to\r\n  express the admiration with which he regards the daring and heroic\r\n  conduct of Lieutenant G. D. Willoughby and the warrant and\r\n  non-commissioned officers by whom he was supported on that occasion.\r\n  Their names are Lieutenants Raynor and Forrest, Conductors Shaw,\r\n  Buckley, Scully, Sub-conductor Crow, Sergeants Edwards and Stewart.\r\n  The family of the late Conductor Scully, who so devotedly sacrificed\r\n  himself in the explosion of the magazine, will be liberally provided\r\n  for, should it be ascertained that they have survived him.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LUCKNOW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                     LUCKNOW AND THE COURT OF OUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother regal or once-regal family, another remnant of Moslem power in\r\nIndia, now comes upon the scene—one which has added to the embarrassment\r\nof the English authorities, by arraying against them the machinations of\r\ndeposed princes as well as the discontent of native troops; and by\r\nshewing, as the King of Delhi had shewn in a neighbouring region, that a\r\npension to a sovereign deprived of his dominions is not always a\r\nsufficient medicament to allay the irritation arising from the\r\ndeprivation. What and where is the kingdom of Oude; of what rank as an\r\nIndian city is its capital, Lucknow; who were its rulers; why and when\r\nthe ruling authority was changed—these matters must be clearly\r\nunderstood, as a preliminary to the narrative of Sir Henry Lawrence’s\r\nproceedings about the time of the outbreak.\r\n\r\nOude, considered as a province of British India, and no longer as a\r\nkingdom, is bounded on the north and northeast by the territory of\r\nNepaul; on the east by the district of Goruckpore; on the southeast by\r\nthose of Azimghur and Jounpoor; on the south by that of Allahabad; on\r\nthe southwest by the districts of the Doab; and on the northwest by\r\nShahjehanpoor. It is now about thrice the size of Wales; but before the\r\nannexation, Oude as a kingdom included a larger area. On the Nepaul\r\nside, a strip of jungle-country called the Terai, carries it to the base\r\nof the sub-Himalaya range. This Terai is in part a wooded marsh, so\r\naffected by a deadly malaria as to be scarcely habitable; while the\r\nother part is an almost impassable forest of trees, underwood, and\r\nreeds, infested by the elephant, the rhinoceros, the bear, the wild hog,\r\nand other animals. Considered generally, however, Oude surpasses in\r\nnatural advantages almost every other part of India—having the Ganges\r\nrunning along the whole of its southwest frontier, a varied and fertile\r\nsoil, a genial though hot climate, and numerous facilities for\r\nirrigation and water-carriage. It cannot, however, be said that man has\r\nduly aided nature in the development of these advantages; for the only\r\nregularly made road in the whole province is that from Lucknow to\r\nCawnpore: the others being mostly wretched tracks, scarcely passable for\r\nwheel-carriages. The railway schemes of the Company include a line\r\nthrough Oude, which would be of incalculable benefit; but no definite\r\ncontract had been made at the time when the Revolt commenced; nor would\r\nsuch a railway be profitable until the trunk-line is finished from\r\nCalcutta to Benares and Allahabad. Although the Mohammedans have,\r\nthrough many ages, held the ruling power in Oude, the Hindoos are\r\ngreatly more numerous; and nearly the whole of the inhabitants, five\r\nmillions in number, speak the Hindostani language; whereas those nearer\r\nCalcutta speak Bengali. As shewing the kind of houses in which Europeans\r\noccasionally sought concealment during the disturbances, the following\r\ndescription of the ordinary dwelling-places of Oude may be useful. They\r\nare generally built either of unburnt brick, or of layers of mud, each\r\nabout three feet in breadth and one foot high. The roofs are made of\r\nsquare beams, placed a foot apart, and covered with planks laid\r\ntransversely; over these are mats, and a roofing of well-rammed wet clay\r\nhalf a yard in thickness. The walls are carried to a height six or seven\r\nfeet above the upper surface of the roof, to afford a concealed place of\r\nrecreation for the females of the family; and during the rainy season\r\nthis small elevated court is covered with a slight awning of bamboos and\r\ngrass. Though so simply and cheaply constructed, these houses are very\r\ndurable. Around the house there is usually a verandah, covered with a\r\nsloping tiled roof. Inside, the beams overhead are exposed to view,\r\nwithout any ceiling. The floors are of earth, well beaten down and\r\nsmoothed, and partially covered with mats or cotton carpets. In the\r\nfront of the house is a chabootra or raised platform of earth, open to\r\nthe air at the sides, and provided with a roof of tiles or grass\r\nsupported on pillars. This platform is a pleasant spot on which\r\nneighbours meet and chat in the cool of the evening. The dwellings of\r\nthe wealthy natives of course present an aspect of greater splendour;\r\nwhile those of the Europeans, in the chief towns, partake of the\r\nbungalow fashion, already described.\r\n\r\nThere are few towns of any distinction in Oude compared with the area of\r\nthe province; and of these few, only two will need to be mentioned in\r\nthe present chapter. As for the city whence the province originally\r\nobtained its name—Oude, Oudh, or Ayodha—it has fallen from its\r\ngreatness. Prinsep, Buchanan, and other authorities, regard it as the\r\nmost ancient, or at any rate one of the most ancient, among the cities\r\nof Hindostan. Some of the coins found in Oude are of such extreme\r\nantiquity, that the characters in which their legends are graven are\r\ntotally unknown. Buchanan thinks that the city was built by the first\r\nBrahmins who entered India, and he goes back to a date fourteen hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era for its foundation; while Tod and Wilford\r\nclaim for Oude an origin even six centuries earlier than that insisted\r\non by Buchanan. The value of such estimates may not be great; they\r\nchiefly corroborate the belief that Oude is a _very_ ancient city. With\r\nits eight thousand inhabitants, and its mud and thatch houses, the\r\ngrandeur of Oude lives in the past; and even this grandeur is in\r\nantiquity rather than in splendour; for the ruins and fragments give a\r\nsomewhat mean idea of the very early Hindoo architecture to which they\r\nbelong. On the eastern side of the town are extensive ruins, said to be\r\nthose of the fort of Rama, king of Oude, celebrated in the mythological\r\nand romantic legends of India. According to Buchanan: ‘The heaps of\r\nbricks, although much seems to have been carried away by the river,\r\nextend a great way—that is, more than a mile in length, and half a mile\r\nin width—and, although vast quantities of materials have been removed to\r\nbuild the Mohammedan Ayodha or Fyzabad, yet the ruins in many parts\r\nretain a very considerable elevation; nor is there any reason to doubt\r\nthat the structure to which they belonged was very large, when we\r\nconsider that it has been ruined for above two thousand years.’ A spot\r\namong the ruins is still pointed out by the reverential Hindoos from\r\nwhich Rama took his flight to heaven, carrying all the people of the\r\ncity with him: a hypothetical emigration which had the effect of leaving\r\nOude desolate until a neighbouring king repopulated it, and embellished\r\nit with three hundred and sixty temples. The existing buildings\r\nconnected with the Hindoo faith are four establishments kept up in\r\nhonour of the fabled monkey-god, the auxiliary of Rama; they have annual\r\nrevenues, settled on them by one of the rulers of Oude; they are managed\r\nby _maliks_ or spiritual superiors; and the revenues are dispensed to\r\nseveral hundreds of _bairagis_ or religious ascetics, and other lazy\r\nHindoo mendicants—no Mussulman being ever admitted within the walls.\r\n\r\nLucknow, however, is the city to which our attention will naturally be\r\nmost directed—Lucknow, as the modern capital of the kingdom or province;\r\nas a city of considerable importance, political, military, commercial,\r\nand architectural; and as a scene of some of the most memorable events\r\nin the Revolt.\r\n\r\nThe city of Lucknow stands on the right bank of the river Goomtee, which\r\nis navigable thence downwards to its confluence with the Ganges between\r\nBenares and Ghazeepore. It is rather more than fifty miles distant from\r\nCawnpore, and about a hundred and thirty from Allahabad. As Cawnpore is\r\non the right bank of the Ganges, that majestic river intervenes between\r\nthe two towns. The Goomtee is crossed at Lucknow by a bridge of boats, a\r\nbridge of substantial masonry, and an iron bridge—an unusual fulness of\r\ntransit-channels in an Indian city. Lucknow displays a varied, lively,\r\nand even brilliant prospect, when viewed from a position elevated above\r\nthe level of the buildings; but, once in the streets, the traveller has\r\nhis dream of beauty speedily dissipated; for oriental filth and\r\nabomination meet his eye on all sides. The central portion of the city,\r\nthe most ancient, is meanly built with mud-houses roofed with straw;\r\nmany of them are no better than booths of mats and bamboos, thatched\r\nwith leaves or palm-branches. The streets, besides being dirty, are\r\nnarrow and crooked, and are dismally sunk many feet below the level of\r\nthe shops. The narrow avenues are rendered still less passable by the\r\ncustom of employing elephants as beasts of burden: unwieldy animals\r\nwhich almost entirely block up the way. In the part of the city occupied\r\nby Europeans, however, and containing the best public buildings, many of\r\nthe streets are broad and lively. Until 1856, when Oude was annexed to\r\nBritish India, Lucknow was, to a stranger, one of the most remarkable\r\ncities of the east, in regard to its armed population. Almost every man\r\nwent armed through the streets. One had a matchlock, another a gun,\r\nanother a pistol; others their bent swords or _tulwars_; others their\r\nbrass-knobbed buffalo-hide shields. Men of business and idlers—among all\r\nalike it was a custom to carry arms. The black beards of the Mussulmans,\r\nand the fierce moustaches of the Rajpoots, added to the warlike effect\r\nthus produced. Oude was the great storehouse for recruits for the\r\nCompany’s native army; and this naturally gave a martial bent to the\r\npeople. The Company, however, deemed it a wise precaution to disarm the\r\npeaceful citizens at the time of the annexation.\r\n\r\nThree or four structures in and near Lucknow require separate\r\ndescription. One is the Shah Nujeef, or Emanbarra of Azof-u-Dowlah, a\r\nmodel of fantastic but elegant Mohammedan architecture. English\r\ntravellers have poured out high praise upon it. Lord Valentia said:\r\n‘From the brilliant white of the composition, and the minute delicacy of\r\nthe workmanship, an enthusiast might suppose that genii had been the\r\nartificers;’ while Bishop Heber declared: ‘I have never seen an\r\narchitectural view which pleased me more, from its richness and variety,\r\nas well as the proportions and general good taste of its principal\r\nfeatures.’ The structure consists of many large buildings surrounding\r\ntwo open courts. There are three archways to connect the courts; and in\r\nthe centre of these is the tomb of the founder, watched by soldiers, and\r\nattended by moullahs perpetually reading the Koran. This structure is\r\noften called the king’s Emanbarra or Imaumbarah, a name given to the\r\nbuildings raised by that sect of Moslems called Sheahs, for the\r\ncelebration of the religious festival of the Mohurrum. Every family of\r\ndistinction has its own emanbarra, large or small, gorgeous or simple,\r\naccording to the wealth of its owner, who generally selects it as his\r\nown burial-place. The central hall of the Shah Nujeef, the king’s\r\nemanbarra, is of vast size and very magnificent; and the combination of\r\nMoslem minarets with Hindoo-pointed domes renders the exterior\r\nremarkably striking; nevertheless the splendour is diminished by the\r\npoverty of the materials, which are chiefly brick coated with chunam or\r\nclay cement. Near or connected with this building is the Roumee Durwaza\r\nor Gate of the Sultan, having an arch in the Saracenic style. Another\r\npublic building is the mosque of Saadut Ali, one of the former nawabs of\r\nOude; its lofty dome presents a remarkable object as seen from various\r\nparts of the city; and, being provided with terraces without and\r\ngalleries within, it is especially attractive to a sight-seer. Southeast\r\nof the city, and near the river, is a fantastic mansion constructed by\r\nClaude Martine, a French adventurer who rose to great wealth and power\r\nat the late court of Lucknow. He called it Constantia, and adorned it\r\nwith various kinds of architectural eccentricities—minute stucco\r\nfretwork, enormous lions with lamps instead of eyes, mandarins and\r\nladies with shaking heads, gods and goddesses of heathen mythology, and\r\nother incongruities. The house is large, and solidly built of stone; and\r\non the topmost story is the tomb of Martine; but his body is deposited\r\nin a sarcophagus in one of the lower apartments. The favourite residence\r\nof the former nawabs and kings of Oude was the Dil Koosha or ‘Heart’s\r\nDelight,’ a richly adorned palace two miles out of the city, and placed\r\nin the middle of an extensive deer-park. When Colonel (afterwards\r\nGeneral Sir James) Outram was appointed British resident at the court of\r\nLucknow, about a year before the annexation, the Dil Koosha was set\r\napart for his reception; and the whole ceremonial illustrated at once\r\nthe show and glitter of oriental processions, and the honour paid to the\r\nEnglishman. As soon as the colonel arrived at Cawnpore from Calcutta,\r\nthe great officers of state were sent from Lucknow to prepare for his\r\nreception. After crossing the Ganges, and thereby setting foot in the\r\nOude dominions, he entered a royal carriage replete with gold and\r\nvelvet; a procession was formed of carriages, cavalry, and artillery,\r\nwhich followed the fifty miles of road to the capital. On the next day,\r\nthe king was to have met the colonel half-way between the city palace\r\nand the Dil Koosha; but being ill, his place was taken by the\r\nheir-apparent. The one procession met the other, and then both entered\r\nLucknow in state. A Lucknow correspondent of a Bombay journal said: ‘Let\r\nthe reader imagine a procession of more than three hundred elephants and\r\ncamels, caparisoned and decorated with all that barbaric pomp could\r\nlavish, and Asiatic splendour shower down; with all the princes and\r\nnobles of the kingdom blazing with jewels, gorgeous in apparel, with\r\nfootmen and horsemen in splendid liveries, swarming on all sides;\r\npennons and banners dancing in the sun’s rays, and a perfect forest of\r\ngold and silver sticks, spears, and other insignia of imperial and royal\r\nstate.’\r\n\r\nA work of remarkable character has appeared, relating to Lucknow and the\r\ncourt of Oude. It is called the _Private Life of an Eastern King_, and\r\nhas been edited from the notes of an Englishman who held a position in\r\nthe household of the king of Oude, Nussir-u-Deen, in 1834 and following\r\nyears.[10] Though the name of the author does not appear, the work is\r\ngenerally accepted as being trustworthy, so many corroborations of its\r\nstatements having appeared in other quarters. Speaking of the king’s\r\npalace within the city, this writer says: ‘The great extent of the\r\nbuildings, generally called the king’s palace, surprised me in the first\r\ninstance. It is not properly a palace, but a continuation of palaces,\r\nstretching all along the banks of the Goomtee, the river on which\r\nLucknow is built. In this, however, the royal residence in Oude but\r\nresembles what one reads of the Seraglio at Constantinople, the khan’s\r\nresidence at Teheran, and the imperial buildings of Pekin. In all\r\noriental states, the palaces are not so much the abode of the sovereign\r\nonly, as the centre of the government: little towns, in fact, containing\r\nextensive lines of buildings occupied by the harem and its vast number\r\nof attendants; containing courts, gardens, tanks, fountains, and\r\nsquares, as well as the offices of the chief ministers of state. Such is\r\nthe case in Lucknow. One side of the narrow Goomtee—a river not much\r\nbroader than a middle-sized London street—is lined by the royal palace;\r\nthe other is occupied by the _rumna_ or park, in which the menagerie is\r\n(or was) maintained.... There is nothing grand or striking about the\r\nexterior of the palace, the Fureed Buksh, as it is called. Its extent is\r\nthe only imposing feature about it; and this struck me more forcibly\r\nthan any magnificence or loftiness of structure would have done.’\r\n\r\nThese few topographical and descriptive details concerning Oude and its\r\ntwo capitals, the former and the present, will prepare us to enter upon\r\na subject touching immediately the present narrative: namely, the\r\nrelations existing between the East India Company and the Oudians, and\r\nthe causes which have generated disaffection in the late royal family of\r\nthat country. It will be needful to shew by what steps Oude, once a\r\nHindoo _kingdom_, became under the Mogul dynasty a Mohammedan\r\n_nawabship_, then a _nawab-viziership_, then under British protection a\r\nMohammedan _kingdom_, and lastly an Anglo-Indian _province_.\r\n\r\nWhether or not historians are correct in asserting that Oude was an\r\nindependent Hindoo sovereignty fourteen hundred years before the\r\nChristian era, and that then, for an indefinite number of centuries, it\r\nwas a Hindoo dependency of a prince whose chief seat of authority was at\r\nOojein—it seems to be admitted that Bakhtiar Khilzi, towards the close\r\nof the twelfth century, was sent to conquer the country for the\r\nMohammedan sovereign at that time paramount in the north of India; and\r\nthat Oude became at once an integral part of the realm of the emperor of\r\nDelhi. Under the powerful Baber, Oude was a lieutenancy or nawabship:\r\nthe ruler having sovereign power within his dominions, but being at the\r\nsame time a vassal of the Great Mogul. This state of things continued\r\nuntil about a century ago, when the weakening of the central power at\r\nDelhi tempted an ambitious nawab of Oude to throw off the trammels of\r\ndependency, and exercise royalty on his own account. At that time the\r\nMohammedan rulers of many states in Northern India were troubled by the\r\ninroads of the fierce warlike Mahrattas; and although the nawabs cared\r\nlittle for their liege lord the emperor, they deemed it expedient to\r\njoin their forces against the common enemy. One result of this struggle\r\nwas, that the nawab of Oude was named ‘perpetual’ nawab—the first\r\nloosening of the imperial chain. The nawab-vizier, as he was now called,\r\nnever afterwards paid much allegiance to the sovereign of Delhi: nay,\r\nthe effete Mogul, in 1764, asked the British to defend him from his\r\nambitious and disobedient neighbour. This assistance was so effectively\r\ngiven, that in the next year the nawab-vizier was forced to sue humbly\r\nfor peace, and to give up some of his possessions as the price of it.\r\nOne among many stipulations of the East India Company, in reference to\r\nthe military forces allowed to be maintained by native princes, was made\r\nin 1768, when the nawab-vizier was limited to an army of 35,000 troops;\r\nnamely, 10,000 cavalry, 10,000 sepoys or infantry, 5000 matchlockmen,\r\n500 artillery, and 9500 irregulars. In 1773, Warren Hastings had become\r\nso completely involved in the perplexities of Indian politics, and made\r\ntreaties so unscrupulously if he could thereby advance the interests of\r\nthe Company—that Company which he served with a zeal worthy of a better\r\ncause—that he plotted with the nawab-vizier against the poor decrepit\r\nMogul: the nawab to obtain much additional power and territory, and the\r\nBritish to obtain large sums of money for assisting him. When the next\r\nnawab-vizier, Azof-u-Dowlah, assumed power in Oude in 1775, he hastened\r\nto strengthen himself by an alliance with the now powerful British; he\r\ngave up to them some territory; they agreed to protect him, and to\r\nprovide a certain contingent of troops, for which he was to pay an\r\nannual sum. This was the complicated way in which the Company gained a\r\nfooting in so many Indian provinces and kingdoms. It was in 1782 that\r\nthat shameful proceeding took place, which—though Warren Hastings\r\nobtained an acquittal concerning it at his celebrated trial in the House\r\nof Lords—has indubitably left a stain upon his name; namely, the\r\nspoliation of two begums or princesses of Oude, and the cruel\r\npunishment, almost amounting to torture, of some of their dependents.\r\nThe alleged cause was an arrear in the payment of the annual sum due\r\nfrom the nawab. Even if the debt were really due, the mode of extorting\r\nthe money, and the selection of the persons from whom it was extorted,\r\ncan never be reconciled to the principles of even-handed justice. The\r\ntruth may be compressed into a short sentence—the Company being terribly\r\nin want of money to carry on a war against Hyder Ali, the\r\ngovernor-general determined to obtain a supply from some or other of the\r\nnative princes in Northern India; and those natives being often\r\nfaithless, he did not hesitate to become faithless to them. During the\r\nremainder of the century, the Company increased more and more its\r\n‘protection’ of the nawab-vizier, and received larger and larger sums in\r\npayment for that protection. Azof-u-Dowlah was succeeded in 1797 by\r\nVizier Ali, and he in 1798 by Saadut Ali.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the present century. In 1801, the Marquis Wellesley\r\nplaced the relations with Oude on a new footing: he relinquished a claim\r\nto any further subsidy from the nawab-vizier, but obtained instead the\r\nrich districts of Allahabad, Azimghur, Goruckpore, and the Southern\r\nDoab, estimated to yield an annual revenue of nearly a million and a\r\nhalf sterling. Oude was larger than England before this date; but the\r\nmarquis took nearly half of it by this transaction. Matters remained\r\nwithout much change till 1814, when Saadut Ali was succeeded by\r\nGhazee-u-Deen Hyder. During the war between the British and the\r\nNepaulese, soon afterwards, the nawab-vizier of Oude lent the Company\r\ntwo millions sterling, and received in return the Terai or\r\njungle-country between Oude and Nepaul. A curious system of exchanges,\r\nthis; for after receiving rich districts instead of money, the Company\r\nreceived money in return for a poor district inhabited chiefly by wild\r\nbeasts. In 1819, the Company allowed Ghazee-u-Deen Hyder to renounce the\r\nvassal-title of nawab-vizier, which was a mockery as connected with the\r\nsuzerainty of the now powerless Emperor of Delhi, and to become _King_\r\nof Oude—a king, however, with a greater king at his elbow in the person\r\nof the British resident at the court of Lucknow. The Company again\r\nbecame a borrower from Ghazee, during the Mahratta and Burmese wars. In\r\n1827, the throne of Oude was ascended by Nussir-u-Deen Hyder—an aspirant\r\nto the throne who was favoured in his pretensions by the Company, and\r\nwho was, as a consequence, in bitter animosity with most of his\r\nrelations during the ten years of his reign. Complicated monetary\r\narrangements were frequently made with the Company, the nature and\r\npurport of which are not always clearly traceable; but they generally\r\nhad the effect of increasing the power of the Company in Oude. On the\r\ndeath of Nussir, in 1837, a violent struggle took place for the throne.\r\nHe, like other eastern princes, had a large number of sons; but the\r\nCompany would not acknowledge the legitimacy of any one of them; and the\r\nsuccession therefore fell upon Mahomed Ali Shah, uncle to the deceased\r\nsovereign. The begum or chief wife of Nussir fomented a rebellion to\r\noverturn this arrangement; and it cost Colonel (afterwards General) Low,\r\nresident at Lucknow, much trouble to preserve peace among the wrangling\r\nmembers of the royal family.\r\n\r\nNow approaches the arrangement which led to the change of rulers. Oude\r\nhad been most miserably governed during many years. The king and his\r\nrelations, his courtiers and his dependents, grasped for money as a\r\nsubstitute for the political power which they once possessed; and in the\r\nobtainment of this money they scrupled at no atrocities against the\r\nnatives. The court, too, was steeped in debaucheries of the most\r\nlicentious kind, outraging the decencies of life, and squandering wealth\r\non the minions who ministered to its pleasures. The more thoughtful and\r\nlarge-hearted among the Company’s superior servants saw here what they\r\nhad so often seen elsewhere: that when the Company virtually took\r\npossession of a native state, and pensioned off the chief and his\r\nfamily, a moral deterioration followed; he was not allowed to exercise\r\nreal sovereignty; he became more intensely selfish, because he had\r\nnothing to be proud of, even if he wished to govern well; and he took\r\nrefuge in the only oriental substitute—sensual enjoyment. When Mahomed\r\nAli Shah died in 1842, and his son, Umjud Ali Shah, was sanctioned by\r\nthe Company as king, a pledge was exacted and a threat foreshadowed: the\r\npledge was, that such reforms should be made by the king as would\r\ncontribute to the tranquillity and just government of the country; the\r\nthreat was, that if he did _not_ do this, the sovereignty would be put\r\nan end to, and the Company would take the government into its own hands.\r\nIn 1847, Umjud Ali Shah was succeeded by his son, Wajid Ali Shah: a king\r\nwho equalled or surpassed his predecessors in weakness and profligacy,\r\nand under whom the state of matters went from bad to worse. The Marquis\r\nof Dalhousie was governor-general when matters arrived at a crisis.\r\nThere can be no question that the Company, whatever may be said about\r\naggressive views, wished to see the millions of Oude well and happily\r\ngoverned; and it is equally unquestionable that this wish had not been\r\ngratified. The engagement with Umjud Ali Shah had assumed this form: ‘It\r\nis hereby provided that the King of Oude will take into his immediate\r\nand earnest consideration, in concert with the British resident, the\r\nbest means of remedying the existing defects in the police, and in the\r\njudicial and revenue administration of his dominions; and that if his\r\nmajesty should neglect to attend to the advice and counsel of the\r\nBritish government or its local representative, and if (which God\r\nforbid!) gross and systematic oppression, anarchy, and misrule, should\r\nhereafter at any time prevail within the Oude dominions, such as\r\nseriously to endanger the public tranquillity, the British government\r\nreserves to itself the right of appointing its own officers to the\r\nmanagement of whatsoever portion of the Oude territory, either to a\r\nsmall or great extent, in which such misrule as that above alluded to\r\nmay have occurred, for so long a period as it may deem necessary.’ The\r\nmarquis, finding that thirteen years had presented no improvement in the\r\ninternal government of Oude, resolved to adopt decisive measures. He\r\ndrew up a treaty, whereby the administration of the territory of Oude\r\nwas to be transferred to the British government: ample provision being\r\nmade for the dignity, affluence, and honour of the king and his family.\r\nThe king refused to sign the treaty, not admitting the allegations or\r\nsuppositions on which it was based; whereupon the marquis, acting with\r\nthe sanction of the Company and of the imperial government in London,\r\nannounced all existing treaties to be null and void, and issued a\r\nproclamation declaring that the government of the territories of Oude\r\nwas henceforth vested exclusively and for ever in the East India\r\nCompany. The governor-general in his minute, it will be remembered,\r\nspoke of this transfer of power in the following brief terms: ‘The\r\nkingdom of Oude has been assumed in perpetual government by the\r\nHonourable East India Company; in pursuance of a policy which has so\r\nrecently been under the consideration of the Honourable Court, that I\r\ndeem it unnecessary to refer to it more particularly here.’\r\n\r\nEverything tends to shew that the king violently opposed this loss of\r\nhis regal title and power. When the governor-general and the resident at\r\nLucknow waited on him with the draft of the proposed treaty, towards the\r\nclose of 1855, he not only refused to sign it, but announced his\r\nintention to proceed to England, with a view of obtaining justice from\r\nQueen Victoria against the Company. This the marquis would not prevent;\r\nbut he intimated that the king must travel, and be treated by the\r\nCompany’s servants, as a _private individual_, if he adopted this step.\r\nThe stipend for the royal family was fixed by the Company—of course\r\nwithout the consent of the king and his relations—at £120,000 per annum.\r\nThe reasons for putting an end to the title of King of Oude were thus\r\nstated, in a document addressed by the directors of the East India\r\nCompany to the governor-general of India in council, many months after\r\nthe transfer of power had been effected, and only a short time before\r\nthe commencement of the Revolt: ‘Half a century ago, our new and\r\ncritical position among the Mohammedans of Northwestern India compelled\r\nus to respect the titular dignity of the Kings of Delhi. But the\r\nexperiences of that half-century have abundantly demonstrated the\r\ninconveniences of suffering an empty nominal sovereignty to descend from\r\ngeneration to generation; and the continuance of such a phantom of power\r\nmust be productive of inconvenience to our government, and we believe of\r\nmore mortification than gratification to the royal pensioners\r\nthemselves. It fosters humiliating recollections; it engenders delusive\r\nhopes; it is the fruitful source of intrigues that end in disappointment\r\nand disgrace. The evil is not limited to the effect produced upon the\r\nmembers of the royal house: prone to intrigue themselves, they become\r\nalso a centre for the intrigues of others. It is natural, also, that the\r\nyounger members of such a family should feel a greater repugnance than\r\nthey otherwise would to mix with the community and become industrious\r\nand useful subjects. Strongly impressed with these convictions, we\r\ntherefore observe with satisfaction that no pledge or promise of any\r\nkind with regard to the recognition by our government of the kingly\r\ntitle after the death of the present titular sovereign, Wajid Ali Shah,\r\nhas been made to him or to his heirs.’ The reasoning in this declaration\r\nis probably sound; but it does not apply, and was not intended to apply,\r\nto the original aggressive movements of the Company. Because the shadow\r\nof sovereignty is not worth retaining without the substance, it does not\r\nnecessarily follow that the Company was right in taking the substance\r\nfifty-five years earlier: that proceeding must be attacked or defended\r\non its own special ground, by any one who wishes to enter the arena of\r\nIndian politics.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this document, that four of the British authorities at\r\nCalcutta—the Marquis of Dalhousie, General Anson, Mr Dorin, and Mr\r\nGrant—had concurred in opinion that, as the king refused to sign the\r\ntreaty, he should, as a punishment, be denied many of the privileges\r\npromised by that treaty. They proposed that the annual stipend of twelve\r\nlacs of rupees (£120,000) should be ‘reserved for consideration’ after\r\nthe demise of the king—that is, that it should not necessarily be a\r\nperpetual hereditary stipend. To this, however, Colonel Low, who had\r\nbeen British resident at Lucknow, very earnestly objected. He urged that\r\nthe king’s sons were so young, that they could not, in any degree, be\r\nblamed for his conduct in not signing the proposed treaty; that they\r\nought not to be made to lose their inheritance through the father’s\r\nfault; that the father, the king, would in any case be pretty severely\r\npunished for his obstinacy; and that it would not be worthy of a great\r\nparamount state, coming into possession of a rich territory, to refuse a\r\nliberal stipend to the descendants of the king. These representations\r\nwere listened to, and a pension to the amount already named was granted\r\nto the king and his heirs—‘not heirs according to Mohammedan usages, but\r\nonly those persons who may be direct male descendants of the present\r\nking, born in lawful wedlock.’ A difficult duty was left to the Calcutta\r\ngovernment, to decide how many existing persons had a claim to be\r\nsupported out of the pension, seeing that an eastern king’s family is\r\ngenerally one of great magnitude; and that, although he has many wives\r\nand many children, they fill various ranks in relation to legitimacy.\r\nThe Company proposed, if the king liked the plan, that one-third of the\r\npension should be commuted into a capital sum, with which jaghires or\r\nestates might be bought, and vested in the family for the use of the\r\nvarious members—making them, in fact, zemindars or landed proprietors,\r\nhaving something to do instead of leading lives of utter idleness. In\r\nwhat light the directors viewed the large and important army of Oude,\r\nwill be noticed presently; but in reference to the transfer of\r\nmastership itself, they said: ‘An expanse of territory embracing an area\r\nof nearly twenty-five thousand square miles, and containing five million\r\nof inhabitants, has passed from its native prince to the Queen of\r\nEngland without the expenditure of a drop of blood, and almost without a\r\nmurmur. The peaceable manner in which this great change has been\r\naccomplished, and the tranquillity which has since prevailed in all\r\nparts of the country, are circumstances which could not fail to excite\r\nin us the liveliest emotions of thankfulness and pleasure.’ This was\r\nwritten, be it remembered—and the fact is full of instruction touching\r\nthe miscalculations of the Company—less than two months before the\r\ncartridge troubles began, and while the mysterious chupatties were\r\nactually in circulation from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nThe deposed King of Oude did not go to England, as he had threatened; he\r\nwent to Calcutta, and took up his abode, in April 1856, at Garden Reach,\r\nin the outskirts of that city, attended by his late prime minister, Ali\r\nNuckee Khan, and by several followers. The queen, however, achieved the\r\nadventurous journey to the British capital, taking with her a numerous\r\nretinue. This princess was not, in accordance with European usages, the\r\nreal Queen of Oude; she was rather a sort of queen-dowager, the king’s\r\nmother, and was accompanied by the king’s brother and the king’s son—the\r\none claiming to be heir-presumptive, the other heir-apparent. All felt a\r\nvery lively interest in the maintenance of the regal power and revenues\r\namong the members of the family, and came to England in the hope of\r\nobtaining a reversal of the governor-general’s decree. They left Lucknow\r\nin the spring of 1856, and arrived in England in August. An attempt was\r\nmade by an injudicious agent to enlist public sympathy for them by an\r\nopen-air harangue at Southampton. He bade his hearers picture to\r\nthemselves the suppliant for justice, ‘an aged queen, brought up in all\r\nthe pomp and luxury of the East, the soles of whose feet were scarcely\r\nallowed to tread the ground, laying aside the prejudices of travel, and\r\nundertaking a journey of some ten thousand miles, to appeal to the\r\npeople of England for justice;’ and the ‘fellow-countrymen’ were then\r\nexhorted to give ‘three cheers’ for the royal family of Oude—which they\r\nundoubtedly did, in accordance with the usual custom of an English\r\nassemblage when so exhorted; but this momentary excitement soon ceased,\r\nand the oriental visitors settled in London for a lengthened residence.\r\nWhat official interviews or correspondence took place concerning the\r\naffairs of Oude, was not publicly known; but there was an evident\r\ndisinclination on the part both of the government and the two Houses of\r\nparliament to hold out any hopes of a reversal of the policy adopted by\r\nthe East India Company; and the ex-royal family of Oude maintained no\r\nhold on the public mind, except so far as the turbaned and robed\r\ndomestics attracted the attention of metropolitan sight-seers. In what\r\nfashion these suppliants disowned and ignored the Revolt in India, a\r\nfuture chapter will shew.\r\n\r\nThe reader will, then, picture to himself the state of Oude at the\r\nperiod when the Revolt commenced. The deposed king was at Calcutta; his\r\nmother and other relations were in London; while the whole governing\r\npower was in the hands of the Company’s servants. Sir Henry Lawrence, a\r\nman in whom sagacity, energy, and nobleness of heart were remarkably\r\ncombined, had succeeded Sir James Outram as resident, or rather\r\nchief-commissioner, and now held supreme sway at Lucknow.\r\n\r\nIt is important here to know in what light the East India Company\r\nregarded the native army of Oude, at and soon after the annexation. In\r\nthe directors’ minute, of December 1856, just on the eve of disturbances\r\nwhich were quite unexpected by them, the subject was thus touched upon:\r\n‘The probable temper of the army, a force computed on paper at some\r\n60,000 men of all arms, on the announcement of a measure which threw a\r\nlarge proportion of them out of employment, and transferred the\r\nremainder to a new master, was naturally a source of some anxiety to us.\r\nIn your scheme for the future government and administration of the Oude\r\nprovinces, drawn up on the 4th of February, you proposed the\r\norganisation of an Oude irregular force, into which you suggested the\r\nabsorption of as large a number of the disbanded soldiers of the king as\r\ncould be employed in such a corps, whilst others were to be provided for\r\nin the military and district police; but you observed at the same time\r\nthat these arrangements would not absorb one-half of the disbanded\r\ntroops. To the remainder you determined to grant pensions and\r\ngratuities, graduated according to length of service. There were no\r\nbetter means than these of palliating a difficulty which could not be\r\navoided. But only partial success was to be expected from so partial a\r\nmeasure. As a further precaution, the chief-commissioner deemed it\r\nexpedient to promise pensions of one hundred rupees per month to the\r\ncommandants of the regiments of the late king, some sixty in number,\r\nconditional on their lending their cordial co-operation to the\r\ngovernment in this crisis, and provided that their regiments remained\r\nquiet and loyal. We recognise the force of the chief-commissioner’s\r\nargument in support of these grants; and are willing to adopt his\r\nsuggestion that, in the event of any of these men accepting office as\r\ntuhseeldars or other functionaries under our government, the amount of\r\ntheir pensions should still be paid to them.’ It was found that the King\r\nof Oude had allowed the pay of his soldiers to run into arrear. On this\r\npoint the directors said: ‘The army, a large number of whom are\r\nnecessarily thrown out of employment, and who cannot immediately find,\r\neven if the habits of their past lives fitted them for, industrial\r\noccupations, are peculiarly entitled to liberal consideration. It is\r\ndoubtless true that, as stated by the chief-commissioner, the soldiery\r\nof Oude have “fattened on rapine and plunder;” and it is certain that\r\nthe servants of the Oude government enriched themselves at the expense\r\nof the people. But this was only part of the system under which they\r\nlived; nothing better, indeed, was to be expected from men whose pay,\r\nafter it had been tardily extracted from the treasury, was liable to be\r\nwithheld from them by a fraudulent minister. Whatever may have been the\r\npast excesses and the illicit gains of the soldiers, it was the duty of\r\nthe British government in this conjuncture to investigate their claims\r\nto the arrears of regular pay alleged to be due to them by the Oude\r\ngovernment, and, having satisfied ourselves of the justice of these\r\nclaims, to discharge the liabilities in full. We observe with\r\nsatisfaction that this has been done.... We concur, moreover, in the\r\nvery judicious remark made by Viscount Canning, in his minute of the 5th\r\nof March, “that a few lacs[11] spent in closing the account, without\r\ninjustice, and even liberality, will be well repaid if we can thereby\r\nsmooth down discontent and escape disturbance.”’\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted, therefore, was to disband the army of the deposed\r\nking, pay up the arrears due by him to the soldiers, re-enlist some of\r\nthe discharged men to form a new Oude force in the Company’s service,\r\nand give pensions or gratuities to the remainder.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a condition to follow the course of events at Lucknow\r\nduring the months of April and May 1857: events less mutinous and\r\ntragical than those at Meerut and Delhi, but important for their\r\nconsequences in later months.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early part of April that the incident occurred at Lucknow\r\nconcerning a medicine-bottle, briefly adverted to in a former chapter:\r\nshewing the existence of an unusually morbid feeling on the subjects of\r\nreligion and caste. Dr Wells having been seen to taste some medicine\r\nwhich he was about to administer to a sick soldier, to test its quality,\r\nthe Hindoos near at hand refused to partake of it, lest the taint of a\r\nChristian mouth should degrade their caste. They complained to Colonel\r\nPalmer, of the 48th native regiment, who, as he believed and hoped,\r\nadopted a conciliatory course that removed all objection. This hope was\r\nnot realised, however; for on that same night the doctor’s bungalow was\r\nfired and destroyed by some of the sepoys, whom no efforts could\r\nidentify. Very soon afterwards, nearly all the huts of the 13th regiment\r\nwere burned down, under similarly mysterious circumstances.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Lawrence’s difficulties began with the vexatious\r\ncartridge-question, as was the case in so many other parts of India.\r\nTowards the close of April, Captain Watson found that many of the\r\nrecruits or younger men in his regiment, the 7th Oude infantry, evinced\r\na reluctance to bite the cartridges. Through some oversight, the new\r\nmethod of tearing instead of biting had not been shewn to the sepoys at\r\nLucknow; and there was therefore sufficient reason for adopting a\r\nconciliatory course in explaining the matter to them. The morbid feeling\r\nstill, however, remained. On the 1st of May, recusancy was again\r\nexhibited, followed by an imprisonment of some of the recruits in the\r\nquarter-guard. The native officers of the regiment came forward to\r\nassure Captain Watson that this disobedience was confined to the\r\n‘youngsters,’ and that the older sepoys discountenanced it. He believed\r\nthem, or seemed to do so. On the 2d he addressed the men, pointing out\r\nthe folly of the conduct attributed to the young recruits, and exhorting\r\nthem to behave more like true soldiers. Though listened to respectfully,\r\nhe observed so much sullenness and doggedness among the troops, that he\r\nbrought the matter under the notice of his superior officer, Brigadier\r\nGrey. The native officers, when put to the test, declined taking any\r\nsteps to enforce obedience; they declared their lives to be in danger\r\nfrom the men under them, should they do so. The brigadier, accompanied\r\nby Captains Watson and Barlow, at once went to the lines, had the men\r\ndrawn up in regular order, and put the question to each company singly,\r\nwhether it was willing to use the same cartridges _which had all along\r\nbeen employed_. They refused. The brigadier left them to arrange plans\r\nfor the morrow; placing them, however, under safe guard for the night.\r\nOn the morning of the 3d, the grenadier company (picked or most skilful\r\ncompany) of the regiment went through the lines, threatening to kill\r\nsome of the European officers; and soon afterwards the tumult became so\r\nserious, that the fulfilment of the threat seemed imminent. By much\r\nentreaty, the officers, European and native, allayed in some degree the\r\nexcitement of the men. While this was going on, however, at the post or\r\nstation of Moosa Bagh, a messenger was sent by the intriguers of the 7th\r\nregiment to the cantonment at Murreeoun, with a letter inciting the 48th\r\nnative infantry to join them in mutiny. This letter was fortunately\r\nbrought, by a subadar true to his duty, to Colonel Palmer, the\r\ncommandant. Prompt measures were at once resolved upon. A considerable\r\nforce—consisting of the 7th Oude cavalry, the 4th Oude infantry,\r\nportions of the 48th and 71st Bengal infantry, a portion of the 7th\r\nBengal cavalry, a wing of her Majesty’s 32d, and a field-battery of\r\nguns—was sent from the cantonment to the place where the recusants were\r\nposted. The mutineers stood firm for some time; but when they saw cannon\r\npointed at them, some turned and fled with great rapidity, while others\r\nquietly gave up their arms. The cavalry pursued and brought back some of\r\nthe fugitives. The 7th Oude irregular infantry regiment, about a\r\nthousand strong, was thus suddenly broken into three fragments—one\r\nescaped, one captured, and one disarmed. A letter from the Rev. Mr\r\nPolehampton, chaplain to the English residents at Lucknow, affords one\r\namong many proofs that Sunday was a favourite day for such outbreaks in\r\nIndia—perhaps purposely so selected by the rebellious sepoys. The 3d of\r\nMay was Sunday: the chaplain was performing evening-service at the\r\nchurch. ‘Towards the end of the prayers, a servant came into church, and\r\nspoke first to Major Reid, of the 48th; and then to Mr Dashwood, of the\r\nsame regiment. They both went out, and afterwards others were called\r\naway. The ladies began to look very uncomfortable; one or two went out\r\nof church; one or two others crossed over the aisle to friends who were\r\nsitting on the other side; so that altogether I had not a very attentive\r\ncongregation.’ When it was found that the officers had been called out\r\nto join the force against the mutineers, the chaplain ‘felt very much\r\ninclined to ride down to see what was going on; but as the Moosa Bagh is\r\nseven miles from our house, and as I should have left my wife all alone,\r\nI stayed where I was. I thought of what William III. said when he was\r\ntold that the Bishop of Derry had been shot at the ford at the Battle of\r\nthe Boyne, “What took him there?”’\r\n\r\nThe course of proceeding adopted by Sir Henry Lawrence on this occasion\r\nwas quite of an oriental character, as if suggested by one who well knew\r\nthe Indian mind. He held a grand military durbar, to reward the faithful\r\nas well as to awe the mutinous. In the first instance he had said that\r\nthe government would be advised to disband the regiment, with a\r\nprovision for re-enlisting those who had not joined the rebels; but\r\npending the receipt of instructions from Calcutta, he held his durbar\r\n(court; levee; hall of audience). Four native soldiers—a havildar-major,\r\na subadar, and a sepoy of the 48th regiment, and a sepoy of the 13th—who\r\nhad proved themselves faithful in an hour of danger, were to be\r\nrewarded. The lawn in front of the residency was carpeted, and chairs\r\nwere arranged on three sides of a square for some of the native officers\r\nand sepoys; while a large verandah was filled with European officials,\r\ncivil and military, upwards of twenty in number. Sir Henry opened the\r\nproceedings with an address in the Hindostani language, full of point\r\nand vigour. After a gorgeous description of the power and wealth of the\r\nBritish nation—overwrought, perhaps, for an English ear, but well suited\r\nto the occasion—he adverted to the freedom of conscience in British\r\nIndia on matters of religion: ‘Those amongst you who have perused the\r\nrecords of the past must well know that Alumghir in former times, and\r\nHyder Ali in later days, forcibly converted thousands and thousands of\r\nHindoos, desecrated their fanes, demolished their temples, and carried\r\nruthless devastation amongst the household gods. Come to our times; many\r\nhere present well know that Runjeet Singh never permitted his Mohammedan\r\nsubjects to call the pious to prayer—never allowed the Afghan to sound\r\nfrom the lofty minarets which adorn Lahore, and which remain to this day\r\na monument to their munificent founders. The year before last a Hindoo\r\ncould not have dared to build a temple in Lucknow. All this is changed.\r\nWho is there that would dare _now_ to interfere with our Hindoo or\r\nMohammedan subjects?’ He contrasted this intolerance of Mohammedan and\r\nHindoo rulers in matters of religion with the known scruples of the\r\nBritish government; and told his hearers that the future would be like\r\nthe present, in so far as concerns the freedom of all religions over the\r\nwhole of India. He rebuked and spurned the reports which had been\r\ncirculated among the natives, touching meditated insult to their faith\r\nor their castes. He adverted to the gallant achievements of the\r\nCompany’s native troops during a hundred years of British rule; and told\r\nhow it pained him to think that disbandment of such troops had been\r\nfound necessary at Barrackpore and Berhampore. And then he presented the\r\nbright side of his picture: ‘Now turn to these good and faithful\r\nsoldiers—Subadar Sewak Tewaree, Havildar Heera Lall Doobey, and Sipahi\r\nRanura Doobey, of the 48th native infantry, and to Hossein Buksh, of the\r\n13th regiment—who have set to you all a good example. The first three at\r\nonce arrested the bearer of a seditious letter, and brought the whole\r\ncircumstance to the notice of superior authority. You know well what the\r\nconsequences were, and what has befallen the 7th Oude irregular\r\ninfantry, more than fifty of whose sirdars and soldiers are now in\r\nconfinement, and the whole regiment awaits the decision of government as\r\nto its fate. Look at Hossein Buksh of the 13th, fine fellow as he is! Is\r\nhe not a good and faithful soldier? Did he not seize three villains who\r\nare now in confinement and awaiting their doom. It is to reward such\r\nfidelity, such acts and deeds as I have mentioned, and of which you are\r\nall well aware, that I have called you all together this day—to assure\r\nyou that those who are faithful and true to their salt will always be\r\namply rewarded and well cared for; that the great government which we\r\nall serve is prompt to reward, swift to punish, vigilant and eager to\r\nprotect its faithful subjects; but firm, determined, resolute to crush\r\nall who may have the temerity to rouse its vengeance.’ After a further\r\nexhortation to fidelity, a further declaration of the power and\r\ndetermination of the government to deal severely with all disobedient\r\ntroops, Sir Henry arrived at the climax of his impassioned and vigorous\r\naddress: ‘Advance, Subadar Sewak Tewaree—come forward, havildar and\r\nsepoys—and receive these splendid gifts from the government which is\r\nproud to number you amongst its soldiers. Accept these honorary sabres;\r\nyou have won them well: long may you live to wear them in honour! Take\r\nthese sums of money for your families and relatives; wear these robes of\r\nhonour at your homes and your festivals; and may the bright example\r\nwhich you have so conspicuously set, find, as it doubtless will,\r\nfollowers in every regiment and company in the army.’ To the subadar and\r\nthe havildar-major were presented each, a handsomely decorated sword, a\r\npair of elegant shawls, a choogah or cloak, and four pieces of\r\nembroidered cloth; to the other two men, each, a decorated sword, a\r\nturban, pieces of cloth, and three hundred rupees in cash. Hossein Buksh\r\nwas also made a naik or corporal.\r\n\r\nLet not the reader judge this address and these proceedings by an\r\nEnglish standard. Sir Henry Lawrence knew well what he was doing; for\r\nfew of the Company’s servants ever had a deeper insight into the native\r\ncharacter than that eminent man. There had been, in the Company’s\r\ngeneral system, too little punishment for misconduct, too little reward\r\nfor faithfulness, among the native troops: knowing this, he adopted a\r\ndifferent policy, so far as he was empowered to do.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the Lucknow disturbance reached Calcutta, a course was\r\nadopted reminding us of the large amount of written correspondence\r\ninvolved in the mode of managing public affairs. The governor-general,\r\nit may here be explained, was assisted by a supreme council, consisting\r\nof four persons, himself making a fifth; and the council was aided by\r\nfour secretaries, for the home, the foreign, the military, and the\r\nfinancial affairs of India. All these officials were expected to make\r\ntheir inquiries, communicate their answers, state their opinions, and\r\nnotify their acts in writing, for the information of the Court of\r\nDirectors and the Board of Control in London; and this is one reason why\r\nparliamentary papers touching Indian affairs are often so voluminous. At\r\nthe period in question, Viscount Canning, Mr Dorin, General Low, Mr\r\nGrant, and Mr Peacock, were the five members of council, each and all of\r\nwhom prepared ‘minutes’ declaratory of their opinions whether Sir Henry\r\nLawrence had done right or wrong in threatening to disband the mutinous\r\n7th regiment. The viscount wished to support the chief-commissioner at\r\nonce, in a bold method of dealing with the disaffected. Mr Dorin went\r\nfurther. He said: ‘My theory is that no corps mutinies that is well\r\ncommanded;’ he wished that some censure should be passed on the English\r\nofficers of the 7th, and that the men of that regiment should receive\r\nmore severe treatment than mere disbanding. General Low advocated a\r\ncourse midway between the other two; but at the same time deemed it\r\nright to inquire how it happened that the men had been required to bite\r\nthe cartridges; seeing that instructions had already been issued from\r\nhead-quarters that the platoon exercises should be conducted without\r\nthis necessity. Mr Grant’s minute was very long; he wanted more time,\r\nmore reports, more examinations, and was startled at the promptness with\r\nwhich Lawrence had proposed to act. Mr Peacock also wanted further\r\ninformation before deciding on the plan proposed by the ruling authority\r\nat Oude. The governor-general’s minute was written on the 9th; the other\r\nfour commented on it on the 10th; the governor-general replied to their\r\ncomments on the 11th; and they commented on his reply on the 12th. Thus\r\nit arose that the tedious system of written minutes greatly retarded the\r\nprogress of business at Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a better opportunity than the present for adverting to\r\nthe extraordinary services rendered by the electric telegraph in India\r\nduring the early stages of the Revolt, when the mutineers had not yet\r\ncarried to any great extent their plan of cutting the wires. We have\r\njust had occasion to describe the routine formalities in the mode of\r\nconducting business at Calcutta; but it would be quite indefensible to\r\nwithhold admiration from the electro-telegraphic system established by\r\nthe East India Company. This matter was touched upon in the\r\nIntroduction; and the middle of May furnished wonderful illustrations of\r\nthe value of the lightning-messenger. Let us fix our attention on two\r\ndays only—the 16th and 17th of May—less than one week after the\r\ncommencement of violent scenes at Meerut and Delhi. Let us picture to\r\nourselves Viscount Canning at Calcutta, examining every possible scheme\r\nfor sending up reinforcements to the disturbed districts; Sir John\r\nLawrence at Lahore, keeping the warlike population of the Punjaub in\r\norder by his mingled energy and tact; Sir Henry Lawrence at Lucknow,\r\nsurrounded by Oudians, whom it required all his skill to baffle; Mr\r\nColvin at Agra, watching with an anxious eye the state of affairs in the\r\nNorthwest Provinces; General Anson at Simla, preparing, as\r\ncommander-in-chief, to hasten down to the Delhi district; Lord\r\nElphinstone at Bombay, as governor of that presidency; and Lord Harris,\r\nfilling an analogous office at Madras. Bearing in mind these persons and\r\nplaces, let us see what was done by the electric telegraph on those two\r\nbusy days—deriving our information from the voluminous but ill-arranged\r\nparliamentary papers on the affairs of India: papers almost useless\r\nwithout repeated perusals and collations.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the 16th of May. Sir Henry Lawrence sent one of his pithy,\r\nterse telegrams[12] from Lucknow to Calcutta, to this effect: ‘All is\r\nquiet here, but affairs are critical; get every European you can from\r\nChina, Ceylon, and elsewhere; also all the Goorkhas from the hills. Time\r\nis precious.’ On the same day he sent another: ‘Give me plenary military\r\npower in Oude; I will not use it unnecessarily. I am sending two troops\r\nof cavalry to Allahabad. Send a company of Europeans into the fort\r\nthere. It will be good to raise regiments of irregular horse, under good\r\nofficers.’ In the reverse direction—from Calcutta to Lucknow—this\r\nmessage was sent: ‘It appears that the regiment of Ferozpore [Sikhs] has\r\nalready marched to Allahabad, and that, under present circumstances, no\r\npart of that regiment can be spared.’ And another, in like manner\r\nanswering a telegram of the same day: ‘You have full military powers.\r\nThe governor-general will support you in everything you think necessary.\r\nIt is impossible to send a European company to Allahabad; Dinapoor must\r\nnot be weakened by a single man. If you can raise any irregulars that\r\nyou can trust, do so at once. Have you any good officers to spare for\r\nthe duty?’ All this, be it remembered was telegraphed to and from two\r\ncities six or seven hundred miles apart. On the same day, questions were\r\nasked, instructions requested, and information given, between Calcutta,\r\non the one hand, and Agra, Gwalior, Meerut, Cawnpore, and Benares on the\r\nother. Passing thence to Bombay—twelve hundred miles from Calcutta by\r\nroad, and very much more by telegraph-route—we find the two governors\r\nconversing through the wires concerning the English troops which had\r\njust been fighting in Persia, and those about being sent to China; all\r\nof whom were regarded with a longing eye by the governor-general at that\r\ncritical time. Viscount Canning telegraphed to Lord Elphinstone on the\r\n16th: ‘Two of the three European regiments which are returning from\r\nPersia are urgently wanted in Bengal. If they are sent from Bombay to\r\nKurachee, will they find conveyance up the Indus? Are they coming from\r\nBushire in steam or sailing transports? Let me know immediately whether\r\nGeneral Ashburnham is going to Madras.’ The general here named was to\r\nhave commanded the troops destined for China. The replies and\r\ncounter-replies to this on the 17th, we will mention presently. Lord\r\nHarris, on this same day of activity, sent the brief telegram: ‘The\r\nMadras Fusiliers will be sent immediately by _Zenobia_; but she is\r\nhardly fit to take a whole regiment.’ This was in reply to a request\r\ntransmitted shortly before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR HENRY LAWRENCE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Residency at Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNext, the 17th of May. Sir Henry Lawrence telegraphed from Lucknow: ‘You\r\nare quite right to keep Allahabad safe. We shall do without Sikhs or\r\nGoorkhas. We have concentrated the troops as much as possible, so as to\r\nprotect the treasury and magazine, and keep up a communication. A false\r\nalarm last night.’ He sent another, detailing what he had done in\r\nmanaging the turbulent 7th regiment. In the reverse direction, a message\r\nwas sent to him, that ‘The artillery invalids at Chunar, about 109 in\r\nnumber, have been ordered to proceed to Allahabad immediately.’ The\r\ntelegrams were still more numerous than on the 16th, between the various\r\ntowns mentioned in the last paragraph, in Northern India. From Bombay,\r\nLord Elphinstone telegraphed to ask whether an extra mail-steamer should\r\nbe sent off to Suez with news for England; and added: ‘The 64th will\r\narrive in a few days from Bushire; their destination is Bengal; but we\r\ncan keep them here available, or send them round to Calcutta if you wish\r\nit.’ To which the governor-general replied from Calcutta, still on the\r\nsame day, expressing his wishes about the mail, and adding: ‘If you can\r\nsend the 64th to Calcutta by steam, do so without any delay. If steam is\r\nnot available, I will wait for an answer to my last message before\r\ndeciding that they shall come round in sailing-vessels. Let me know when\r\nyou expect the other European regiments and the artillery, and what\r\nsteam-vessels will be available for their conveyance. Have you at\r\npresent a steam-vessel that could go to Galle to bring troops from there\r\nto Calcutta? This must not interfere with the despatch of the 64th.’\r\nAnother, from Lord Elphinstone, on the very same day, announced that the\r\nbest of the Indus boats were in Persia; that it would be impossible to\r\nsend up three European regiments from Kurachee to the Punjaub, within\r\nany reasonable time, by the Indus boats then available; that he\r\nnevertheless intended to send one regiment, the 1st Europeans, by that\r\nroute; and that the 2d Europeans were daily expected from Persia. He\r\nfurther said: ‘Shall I send them round to Calcutta; and shall I send the\r\n78th also? General Ashburnham leaves this to-day by the steamer for\r\nGalle, where he expects to meet Lord Elgin; he is not going to Madras.’\r\nWhile this was going on between Calcutta and Bombay, Madras was not\r\nidle. The governor-general telegraphed to Lord Harris, to inform him of\r\nthe mutiny, on the previous day, of the Sappers and Miners who went from\r\nRoorkee to Meerut; and another on the same day, replying to a previous\r\ntelegram, said: ‘If the _Zenobia_ cannot bring all the Fusiliers, the\r\nremainder might be sent in the _Bentinck_, which will be at Madras on\r\nthe 26th; but send as many in the _Zenobia_ as she will safely hold. Let\r\nme know when the _Zenobia_ sails, and what force she brings.’ If we had\r\nselected three days instead of two, as illustrating the wonders of the\r\nelectric telegraph, we should have had to narrate that on the third day,\r\nthe 18th of May, Lord Harris announced that the Fusiliers would leave\r\nMadras that evening; that Viscount Canning thanked him for his great\r\npromptness; that Lord Elphinstone received instructions to send one of\r\nthe three regiments up the Indus, and the other two round to Calcutta;\r\nthat he asked and received suggestions about managing a Beloochee\r\nregiment at Kurachee; and that messages in great number were transmitted\r\nto and from Calcutta, Benares, Allahabad, Cawnpore, Lucknow, Agra, and\r\nother large towns.\r\n\r\nThe imagination becomes almost bewildered at contemplating such things.\r\nBetween the morning of the 16th of May and the evening of the 17th, the\r\ngreat officers of the Company, situated almost at the extreme points of\r\nthe Indian empire—east, west, north, and south—were conversing through\r\nfour thousand miles of wire, making requests, soliciting advice,\r\noffering services, discussing difficulties, weighing probabilities,\r\nconcerting plans; and all with a precision much greater than if they had\r\nbeen writing letters to one another, in ordinary official form, in\r\nadjoining rooms of the same building. It was, perhaps, the greatest\r\ntriumph ever achieved up to that time by the greatest of modern\r\ninventions—the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nWe shall find the present part of the chapter an equally convenient\r\nplace in which to notice a series of operations strikingly opposed to\r\nthose just described—slow travelling as compared with quick telegraphy.\r\nIt is full of instruction to see how earnestly anxious Viscount Canning\r\nwas to send troops up to the northern provinces; and how he was baffled\r\nby the tardiness of all travelling appliances in India. The railway was\r\nopened only from Calcutta to Raneegunge, a very small portion of the\r\ndistance to the disturbed districts. The history of the peregrinations\r\nof a few English troops in May will illustrate, and will receive\r\nillustration from, the matters treated in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nThe European 84th regiment, it will be remembered, had been hastily\r\nbrought from Rangoon in the month of March, to assist in disbanding the\r\nsepoys who had shewn disaffection at Barrackpore and Berhampore. When\r\nthe troubles began at Meerut and Delhi, in May, it was resolved to send\r\non this regiment; and the governor-general found no part of his onerous\r\nduties more difficult than that of obtaining _quick_ transmission for\r\nthose troops. On the 21st of May he telegraphed to Benares: ‘Pray\r\ninstruct the commissariat officer to prepare cooking-pots and other\r\narrangements for the 84th regiment, now on its way to Benares; and the\r\nbarrack department to have cots ready for them.’ On the 23d, Sir Henry\r\nLawrence asked: ‘When may her Majesty’s 84th be expected at Cawnpore?’\r\nto which an answer was sent on the following day: ‘It is impossible to\r\nconvey a wing of Europeans to Cawnpore (about six hundred and thirty\r\nmiles) in less time than twenty-five days. The government dâk and the\r\ndâk companies are fully engaged in carrying a company of the 84th to\r\nBenares, at the rate of 18 men a day. A wing of the Madras Fusiliers\r\narrived yesterday, and starts to-day; part by bullock-train, part by\r\nsteamer. The bullock-train can take 100 men per day, at the rate of\r\nthirty miles a day. The entire regiment of the Fusiliers, about 900\r\nstrong, cannot be collected at Benares in less than 19 or 20 days. About\r\n150 men who go by steam will scarcely be there so soon. I expect, that\r\nfrom this time forward troops will be pushed upwards at the rate of 100\r\nmen a day from Calcutta; each batch taking ten days to reach Benares;\r\nfrom Benares they will be distributed as most required. The regiments\r\nfrom Pegu, Bombay, and Ceylon will be sent up in this way. Every bullock\r\nand horse that is to be had, except just enough to carry the post, is\r\nretained; and no troops will be sent by steam which can be sent more\r\nquickly by other means.’ These details shew that Cawnpore and Benares\r\nwere both asking for troops at the same time; and that the\r\ngovernor-general, even if he possessed the soldiers, had not the means\r\nof sending them expeditiously. On the 24th, a message was sent to\r\nRaneegunge, ordering that a company of Madras troops might be well\r\nattended to, when they arrived by railway from Calcutta; and on the next\r\nday, Benares received notice to prepare for four companies proceeding\r\nthither by bullock-train, one company per day. The Benares commissioner\r\nannounced the arrival of _fifteen_ English soldiers, as if that were a\r\nnumber to be proud of, and stated that he would send them on to\r\nCawnpore. (It will be seen, on reference to a map, that Benares lies in\r\nthe route to almost all the upper and western provinces, whether by road\r\nor by river.) The Raneegunge agent telegraphed on the 26th: ‘If the men\r\nreach Sheergotty, there is no difficulty in conveying them to Benares;\r\nthe only difficulty is between Raneegunge and Sheergotty. _Ekahs_ are\r\nnot, I think, adapted for Europeans; nor do I think that time would be\r\ngained.’ An ekah or ecka, we may here remark, is a light pony-gig on two\r\nwheels, provided with a cloth cushion on which the rider (usually a\r\nnative) sits cross-legged. It shews the nature of Indian travelling, to\r\nfind the officials discussing whether English soldiers should be thus\r\nconveyed—one cushioned vehicle to convey each cross-legged soldier. At\r\nBenares, the commissioner borrowed from the rajah the use of a house in\r\nwhich to lodge the English troops as fast as they came; and he sent them\r\non by dâk to Allahabad and Cawnpore. Nevertheless Sir Henry Lawrence,\r\ndisturbed by ominous symptoms, wished for ekahs, dâks—anything that\r\nwould give him English soldiers. He telegraphed on this day: ‘I strongly\r\nadvise that as many ekah-dâks be laid as possible, from Raneegunge to\r\nCawnpore, to bring up European troops. _Spare no expense_;’ and on the\r\nnext day he received the reply: ‘Every horse and carriage, bullock and\r\ncart, which could be brought upon the road, has been collected, and no\r\nmeans of increasing the number will be neglected.’ On the 27th it was\r\nannounced from Benares that ‘the steamer had stuck,’ and that all the\r\nland-dâks were being used that could possibly be procured. On the same\r\nday the Allahabad commissioner spoke hopefully of his plan that—by the\r\naid of 1600 siege-train bullocks from that place, 600 from Cawnpore, the\r\ngovernment bullocks, the private wagon-trains, and magazine carts—he\r\nmight be able to send 160 Europeans per day up to Cawnpore. On the 28th,\r\nthe Calcutta authorities sent a telegram to Benares, to announce that\r\n‘Up to the 1st of June seven dâk-carriages will be despatched daily,\r\nwith one officer and 18 soldiers. On the 1st of June, and daily\r\nafterwards, there will be despatched nine dâk-carriages, with one\r\nofficer and 24 Europeans; and 28 bullock-carts, with one officer, 90\r\nEuropeans, a few followers, and provisions to fill one cart. The\r\nCalcutta steamer and flat, with four officers, 134 Europeans, and\r\nproportion of followers; and the coal-steamer, with about the same\r\nnumbers, will reach Benares on the 10th or 11th of June.’ From this it\r\nwill be seen that a ‘dâk-carriage’ conveyed three soldiers, and a\r\n‘bullock-cart’ also three, the ‘followers’ probably accompanying them on\r\nfoot. The Benares commissioner on the same day said: ‘Happily we have\r\ngood metalled roads all over this division’—thereby implying what would\r\nhave been the result if the roads were _not_ good. The use of bullocks\r\nwas more particularly adverted to in a telegram of the 30th of May:\r\n‘Gun-bullocks would be most useful between Raneegunge and the Sone, if\r\nthey could be sent from Calcutta in time; if there are carts, the daily\r\ndispatches can be increased; not otherwise. Gun-bullocks would save a\r\nday, as they travel quicker than our little animals.’ Immediately\r\nafterwards, forty-six elephants were sent from Patna, and one hundred\r\nfrom Dacca and Barrackpore, to Sheergotty, to assist in the transport of\r\ntroops. On a later occasion, when more troops had arrived from England,\r\nViscount Canning sent two steamers from Calcutta to Pegu, to bring over\r\ncargoes of elephants, to be used as draught-animals!\r\n\r\nThus it continued, day after day—all the servants of the Company, civil\r\nand military, calculating how long it would take to send driblets of\r\nsoldiers up the country; and all harassed by this dilemma—that what the\r\nGanges steamers gained in roominess, they lost by the sinuosities of the\r\nriver; and that what the dâks and bullock-trains gained by a direct\r\nroute, they lost by the inevitable slowness of such modes of conveyance,\r\nand the smallness of the number of soldiers that could be carried at a\r\ntime. Thankful that they possessed telegraphs, the authorities had\r\nlittle to be thankful for as concerned railways or roads, vehicles or\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nWe now return to the proceedings of Sir Henry Lawrence at Lucknow.\r\n\r\nBefore the collective minutes of the five members of the Supreme Council\r\nwere fully settled, he had acted on the emergency which gave rise to\r\nthem. He held a court of inquiry; the result of which was that two\r\nsubadars, a jemadar, and forty-four sepoys of the mutinous 7th were\r\ncommitted to prison; but he resolved not at present to disband the\r\nregiment. His grand durbar has been already described. In the middle of\r\nthe month, as just shewn, he sent many brief telegrams indicating that,\r\nthough no mutinies had occurred at Lucknow, there was nevertheless need\r\nfor watchfulness. He had asked for the aid of some Sikhs, but said, on\r\nthe 18th: ‘As there is difficulty, do not send the Sikhs to Lucknow.’ On\r\nthe next day, his message was: ‘All very well in city, cantonment, and\r\ncountry;’ but after this, the elements of mischief seemed to be\r\ngathering, although Lawrence prepared to meet all contingencies\r\nresolutely. ‘All quiet,’ he said on the 21st, ‘but several reports of\r\nintended attacks on us.’ He was, however, more solicitous about the fate\r\nof Cawnpore, Allahabad, and Benares, than of Lucknow.\r\n\r\nThe military position of Sir Henry towards the last week in May was\r\nthis. He had armed four posts for his defence at Lucknow. In one were\r\nfour hundred men and twenty guns; in another, a hundred Europeans and as\r\nmany sepoys; in another was the chief store of powder, well under\r\ncommand. A hundred and thirty Europeans, two hundred sepoys, and six\r\nguns, guarded the treasury; the guns near the residency being under\r\nEuropean control. The old magazine was denuded of its former contents,\r\nas a precautionary measure. Six guns, and two squadrons of the 2d Oude\r\nirregular cavalry, were at the Dâk bungalow, half-way between the\r\nresidency and the cantonment. In the cantonment were three hundred and\r\nforty men of her Majesty’s 32d, with six European guns, and six more of\r\nthe Oude light field-battery. By the 23d of the month, nearly all the\r\nstores were moved from the old magazine to one of the strongholds, where\r\nthirty guns and one hundred Europeans were in position, and where ten\r\ndays’ supplies for five hundred men were stored. On the 29th, Lawrence’s\r\ntelegram told of ‘great uneasiness at Lucknow. Disturbances threatened\r\noutside. Tranquillity cannot be much longer maintained unless Delhi be\r\nspeedily captured.’ The residency, a place rendered so memorable by\r\nsubsequent events, must be here noticed. The cantonment was six miles\r\nfrom the city, and the residency was itself isolated from the rest of\r\nLucknow. The Rev. Mr Polehampton, describing in his letter the\r\noccurrences about the middle of May, said: ‘The sick have been brought\r\nto the residency; so have the women; and the residency is garrisoned by\r\n130 men of the 32d, and by the battery of native artillery. All the\r\nladies, wives of civilians, who live in different parts of the city,\r\nhave come into the residency. By the residency, I mean a piece of ground\r\na good deal elevated above the rest of the city, allotted by the King of\r\nOude, when he first put himself under British “protection” some fifty\r\nyears ago, to the British civil residents. It is walled round almost\r\nentirely; on one side native houses abut upon it, but on the other three\r\nsides it is tolerably clear. Roads without gates in some places connect\r\nit with the city; but it is not at all a bad place to make a\r\nstand—certainly the best in Lucknow, to which it is a sort of acropolis.\r\nThe residency contains the chief-commissioner’s house, Mr Gubbins’s, Mr\r\nOmmaney’s, Foyne’s, the post-office, city hospital, electric-telegraph\r\noffice, church, etc.’ The ever-memorable defence made by a little band\r\nof English heroes in this ‘acropolis’ of Lucknow, will call for our\r\nattention in due time. Mr Polehampton spoke of the gravity with which\r\nSir Henry Lawrence regarded the state of public affairs; and of the\r\ncaution which led him to post _one_ English soldier at every gun, to\r\nwatch the native artillerymen. The chaplain had means of knowing with\r\nwhat assiduity crafty lying men tried to gain over the still faithful\r\nsepoys to mutiny. ‘Another most absurd story they have got hold of,\r\nwhich came out in the examination of some of the mutineers before Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence. They say that in consequence of the Crimean war there\r\nare a great many widows in England, and that these are to be brought out\r\nand married to the Rajahs in Oude; and that their children, brought up\r\nas Christians, are to inherit all the estates! The natives are like\r\nbabies—they will believe anything.’—Babies in belief, perhaps; but\r\nfiends in cruelty when excited.\r\n\r\nThe last two days of May were days of agitation at Lucknow. Many of the\r\nnative troops broke out in open mutiny. They consisted of half of the\r\n48th regiment, about half of the 71st, some few of the 13th, and two\r\ntroops of the 7th cavalry—all of whom fled towards Seetapoor, a town\r\nnearly due north of Lucknow. Lawrence, with two companies of her\r\nMajesty’s 32d, three hundred horse, and four guns, went in pursuit; but\r\nthe horse, Oude native cavalry, evinced no zeal; and he was vexed to\r\nfind that he could only get within round-shot of the mutineers. He took\r\nthirty prisoners—a very inadequate result of the pursuit. Many\r\ndisaffected still remained in Lucknow; four bungalows were burned, and a\r\nfew English officers shot. The city was quiet, but the cantonment was in\r\na disturbed state. In his last telegrams for the month, the\r\nchief-commissioner, who was also chief military authority, used these\r\nwords: ‘It is difficult to say who are loyal; but it is believed the\r\nmajority are so; only twenty-five of the 7th cavalry proved false;’ and\r\nhe further said: ‘The faithful remnants of three infantry regiments and\r\n7th cavalry, about seven hundred men, are encamped close to the\r\ndetachment of two hundred of her Majesty’s 32d and four European guns.’\r\nEven then he did not feel much uneasiness concerning the city and\r\ncantonment of Lucknow: it was towards other places, Cawnpore especially,\r\nthat his apprehensive glance was directed.\r\n\r\nWhat were the occurrences at Lucknow, and in other towns of the\r\nterritory of Oude, in June, will be better understood when the progress\r\nof the Revolt in other places during May has been narrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ekah, or Officer’s Travelling Wagon.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  By Mr Knighton, author of _Forest Life in Ceylon_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Lacs or lakhs of rupees: a lac being 100,000, value about £10,000.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  The word _telegram_, denoting a message sent, as distinguished from\r\n  the _telegraph_ which sends it, has been a subject of much discussion\r\n  among Greek scholars, concerning the validity of the grammatical basis\r\n  on which it is formed; but as the new term is convenient for its\r\n  brevity and expressiveness, and as it has been much used by the\r\n  governor-general and the various officers connected with India, it\r\n  will occasionally be employed in this work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  General View of CALCUTTA from Fort William.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                     SPREAD OF DISAFFECTION IN MAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe narrative has now arrived at a stage when some kind of\r\nclassification of times and places becomes necessary. There were special\r\nreasons why Delhi and Lucknow should receive separate attention,\r\nconnected as those two cities are with deposed native sovereigns chafed\r\nby their deposition; but other cities and towns now await notice, spread\r\nover many thousand square miles of territory, placed in various\r\nrelations to the British government, involved in various degrees in\r\nmutinous proceedings, and differing much in the periods at which the\r\nhostile demonstrations were made. Two modes of treatment naturally\r\nsuggest themselves. The towns might be treated topographically,\r\nbeginning at Calcutta, and working westward towards the Indus; this\r\nwould be convenient for reference to maps, but would separate\r\ncontemporaneous events too far asunder. Or the occurrences might be\r\ntreated chronologically, beginning from the Meerut outbreak, and\r\nadvancing, as in a diary, day by day throughout the whole series; this\r\nwould facilitate reference to dates, but would ignore local connection\r\nand mutual action. It may be possible, however, to combine so much of\r\nthe two methods as will retain their advantages and avoid their defects;\r\nthere may be groups of days and groups of places; and these groups may\r\nbe so treated as to mark the relations both of sequence and of\r\nsimultaneity, of causes and of co-operation. In the present chapter, a\r\nrapid glance will be taken over a wide-spread region, to shew in what\r\nway and to what degree disaffection spread during the month of May. This\r\nwill prepare us for the terrible episode at one particular\r\nspot—Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, with Bengal—the fertile and populous region between the\r\nAnglo-Indian city of Calcutta and the sacred Hindoo city of Benares; the\r\nregion watered by the lower course of the majestic Ganges; the region\r\ninhabited by the patient, plodding, timid Bengalee, the type from which\r\nEuropeans have generally derived their idea of the Hindoo: forgetting,\r\nor not knowing, that Delhi and Agra, Cawnpore and Lucknow, exhibit the\r\nHindoo character under a more warlike aspect, and are marked also by a\r\ndifference of language. A fact already mentioned must be constantly\r\nborne in mind—that few Bengalees are (or were) in the Bengal army: a\r\npopulation of forty millions furnished a very small ratio of fighting\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a scene of murder and atrocity during the Revolt, Calcutta\r\nrequires a few words of notice here: to shew the relation existing\r\nbetween the native and the European population, and the importance of\r\nthe city as the head-quarters of British India, the supreme seat of\r\nlegislation and justice, the residence of the governor-general, the last\r\ngreat city on the course down the Ganges, and the port where more trade\r\nis conducted than in all others in India combined.\r\n\r\nCalcutta stands on the left bank of the Hoogly, one of the numerous\r\nstreams by which the Ganges finds an outlet into the sea. There are no\r\nless than fourteen of these streams deep enough for the largest craft\r\nused in inland navigation, but so narrow and crooked that the rigging of\r\nvessels often becomes entangled in the branches of the trees growing on\r\nthe banks. The delta formed by these mouths of the Ganges, called the\r\nSunderbunds, is nearly as large as Wales; it is little else than a\r\ncluster of low, marshy, irreclaimable islands, very unhealthy to the few\r\nnatives living there, and left almost wholly to tigers, wild buffaloes,\r\nwild boars, and other animals which swarm there in great numbers. The\r\nHoogly is one of the few really navigable mouths of the Ganges; and by\r\nthis channel Calcutta has free access by shipping to the sea, which is\r\nabout a hundred miles distant. The city, extending along the river four\r\nor five miles, covers an area of about eight square miles. A curved line\r\nnearly bounds it on the land-side, formed by the Mahratta ditch, a\r\ndefence-work about a century old. Beyond the ditch, and a fine avenue\r\ncalled the Circular Road, the environs are studded with numerous suburbs\r\nor villages which may be considered as belonging to the city: among\r\nthese are Nundenbagh, Bahar-Simla, Sealdah, Entally, Ballygunge,\r\nBhowaneepore, Allipore, Kidderpore, Seebpore, Howrah, and Sulkea. The\r\nthree last are on the opposite or west bank of the river, and contain\r\nthe dock-yards, the ship-building establishments, the railway station,\r\nthe government salt-warehouses, and numerous extensive manufactories.\r\nThe approach to the city from the sea presents a succession of\r\nattractive features. First, a series of elegant mansions at a bend in\r\nthe river called Garden Reach, with lawns descending to the water’s\r\nedge; then the anchorage for the Calcutta and Suez mail-steamers; then\r\nthe dock-yards; next the canal junction, the arsenal and Fort William.\r\nAbove these is the Chowringhee, once a suburb, but now almost as closely\r\nbuilt as Calcutta itself, containing the Esplanade, the Town Hall, the\r\nGovernment House, and many European residences. ‘Viewed from Garden\r\nReach,’ says Mr Stocqueler, ‘the _coup d’œil_ is one of various and\r\nenchanting beauty. Houses like palaces are studding the bank on the\r\nproper left of the river, and a verdure like that of an eternal summer\r\nrenovates the eye, so long accustomed to the glitter of the ocean. Anon,\r\non _your_ left, appears the semi-Gothic Bishop’s College; and in front\r\nof you, every moment growing more distinct, are beheld a forest of\r\nstately masts, a noble and beautiful fortress, a thousand small boats,\r\nof shapes new and undreamed of by the visitant, skimming over the\r\nstream; the larger vessels of the country, pleasant to look upon even\r\nfor their strange dis-symmetry and consequent unwieldiness; the green\r\nbarge or budgerow, lying idly for hire; and the airy little bauleahs,\r\nwith their light venetianed rooms.’ All this relates to the portion of\r\nthe city lying south or seaward of the Chandpaul Ghat, the principal\r\nlanding-place. Northward of this stretches a noble strand, on which are\r\nsituated the Custom-house, the New Mint, and other government offices.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that, although the chief British city in India,\r\nCalcutta in ordinary times contains no less than _seventy times_ as many\r\nnatives as English—only six thousand English out of more than four\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants. Even if Eurasians (progeny of white\r\nfathers and native mothers) be included, the disparity is still\r\nenormous; and is rendered yet more so by the many thousands of natives\r\nwho, not being inhabitants, attend Calcutta at times for purposes of\r\ntrade or of worship. Many wild estimates were made a few years ago\r\nconcerning the population of Calcutta, which was sometimes driven up\r\nhypothetically to nearly a million souls; but a census in 1850\r\ndetermined the number to be four hundred and seventeen thousand persons,\r\nliving in sixty-two thousand houses and huts. The Hindoos alone exceed\r\ntwo hundred and seventy thousand. Circumstances of site, as well as the\r\nwishes and convenience of individuals, have led the Europeans to form a\r\ncommunity among themselves, distinct from the native Calcutta. Many\r\nnatives, it is true, live in the southern or British town; but very few\r\nBritish live in the northern or native town. The latter differs little\r\nfrom Indian towns generally, except in the large size of the dwellings\r\nbelonging to the wealthy inhabitants. The southern town is European in\r\nappearance as in population; it has its noble streets, sumptuous\r\ngovernment offices, elegant private residences surrounded with\r\nverandahs. On the esplanade is situated Fort William (the official name\r\ngiven to Calcutta in state documents), one of the strongest in India; it\r\nis octagonal, with three sides towards the river, and the other five\r\ninland; and it mounts more than six hundred guns. Whatever force holds\r\nFort William may easily reduce Calcutta to ashes. The public buildings,\r\nwhich are very numerous, comprise the following among others—the\r\nGovernment House, that cost £130,000; the Town Hall, in the Doric style;\r\nthe Supreme Court of Judicature; the Madrissa and Hindoo Colleges; the\r\nMartinière, an educational establishment founded by Martine the\r\nFrenchman, who has been mentioned in connection with Lucknow; the\r\nMetcalfe Hall; the Ochterlony Monument; the Prinsep Testimonial; the\r\nCalcutta Asiatic Society’s Rooms; St Paul’s Cathedral, the finest\r\nChristian church in India; the Bishop’s Palace and College; the European\r\nFemale Orphan Asylum; the Botanic Gardens. The Episcopalians, the\r\nNational and the Free Churches of Scotland, the Independents, the\r\nBaptists, the Roman Catholics, the Armenians, the Jews, the Greeks—all\r\nhave places of worship in Calcutta. The native temples and mosques are\r\nof course much more numerous, amounting to two hundred and fifty in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nConcerning the inhabitants, the English comprise the Company’s civil and\r\nmilitary servants, a few members of the learned professions, merchants,\r\nretail-dealers, and artisans. Of the native Hindoos and Mohammedans,\r\nexclusive of the degraded castes of the former, it is supposed that\r\none-third are in the service of the English, either as domestic\r\nservants, or as under-clerks, messengers, &c. A majority of the\r\nremainder pick up a living on the street or the river—carrying\r\npalanquins as bearers, carrying parcels as coolies, rowing boats,\r\nattending ships, &c. The native artisans, shopkeepers, and\r\nmarket-people, fill up the number.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, from the details given in Chapter II., that the\r\nauthorities at Calcutta, during the first four months of the year, were\r\nfrequently engaged in considering the transactions at Dumdum,\r\nBarrackpore, and Berhampore, connected with the cartridge grievances.\r\nThese did not affect the great city itself, the inhabitants of which\r\nlooked on as upon events that concerned them only remotely. When the\r\nmiddle of May arrived, however, and when the startling news from Meerut\r\nand Delhi became known, an uneasy feeling resulted. There was in\r\nCalcutta a kind of undefined alarm, a vague apprehension of some hidden\r\ndanger. At that time there were six companies of the 25th Bengal\r\ninfantry, and a wing of the 47th Madras infantry, barracked on the\r\nesplanade between the Coolie Bazaar and the fort. They were without\r\nammunition. There were, however, detachments of two other regiments\r\nacting as guards in the fort, provided with ten rounds of ammunition per\r\nman. It came to light that, on the 17th of May, the men of the 25th\r\nasked the guards privately to be allowed to share this ammunition,\r\npromising to aid them in capturing the fort during the following night.\r\nThis treason was betrayed by the guards to the town-major, who at once\r\nordered bugles to sound, and preparations to be made for defending the\r\nfort; the drawbridges were raised, the ladders withdrawn from the\r\nditches, additional guards placed upon the arsenal, European sentries\r\nplaced at various points on the ramparts, and armed patrols made to\r\nperambulate the fort during the night. The refractory sepoys, thus\r\nchecked, made no attempt to carry out their nefarious project. An\r\nexpress was at once sent off to Dumdum for the remaining portion of her\r\nMajesty’s 53d regiment, to join their comrades already at Calcutta.\r\nAlthough the immense value of these English troops was at once felt, the\r\ninhabitants of Calcutta were thrown into great excitement by the\r\nrumoured outbreak; they talked of militia corps and volunteer corps, and\r\nthey purchased muskets and powder, rifles and revolvers, so rapidly,\r\nthat the stores of the dealers were speedily emptied.\r\n\r\nTwo demonstrations of loyalty—or rather two sets of demonstrations—were\r\nmade on this occasion, one from the Christian inhabitants, and one from\r\nthe natives. The mutineers found head-quarters not quite suited for\r\ntheir operations; order was soon restored; and then all parties came\r\nforward to state how faithful, contented, and trustworthy they were. It\r\nis not without interest to glance at some of these demonstrations. One\r\nwas from the Calcutta Trade Association, which held a meeting on the\r\n20th of May. The resolution agreed to was to the effect that ‘This body\r\ndo send up to government a statement that they are prepared to afford\r\nthe government every assistance in their power towards the promotion of\r\norder and the protection of the Christian community of Calcutta, either\r\nby serving as special constables or otherwise, in such manner as may\r\nappear most desirable to government; and at the same time suggesting to\r\ngovernment that their services should be availed of in some manner, as\r\nthey deem the present crisis a most serious one, and one in which every\r\navailable means should be brought into action for the suppression of\r\npossible riot and insurrection.’ The answer given by the\r\ngovernor-general in council to the address sent up in virtue of this\r\nresolution is worthy of note; shewing, as it does, how anxious he was to\r\nbelieve, and to make others believe, that the mutiny was very partial,\r\nand that the sepoy army generally was sound at heart. He thanked the\r\nTrade Association for the address; he announced that he had no\r\napprehension whatever of riot or insurrection amongst any class of the\r\npopulation at Calcutta; he asserted his possession of sufficient means\r\nto crush any such manifestation if it should be made; but at the same\r\ntime he admitted the prudence of civilians enrolling themselves as\r\nspecial constables, ready for any emergency. In reference, however, to\r\nan opinion in the address that the sepoys generally exhibited a mutinous\r\nspirit, he expressed uneasiness at such an opinion being publicly\r\nannounced. ‘There are in the army of this presidency many soldiers, and\r\nmany regiments who have stood firm against evil example and wicked\r\ncounsels, and who at this moment are giving unquestionable proof of\r\ntheir attachment to the government, and of their abhorrence of the\r\natrocious crimes which have lately been perpetrated in the Northwestern\r\nProvinces. It is the earnest desire of the governor-general in council\r\nthat honourable and true-hearted soldiers, whose good name he is bound\r\nto protect, and of whose fidelity he is confident, should not be\r\nincluded in a condemnation of rebels and murderers.’ Alas, for the\r\n‘honourable and true-hearted soldiers!’\r\n\r\nAnother movement of the same kind was made by the Freemasons of\r\nCalcutta—a body, the numbers of which are not stated. They passed a\r\nresolution on the same day, ‘That at the present crisis it is expedient\r\nthat the masonic fraternity should come forward and offer their services\r\nto government, to be employed in such manner as the governor-general may\r\ndeem most expedient.’\r\n\r\nThe Armenians resident in the city met on the following day, and agreed\r\nto a series of resolutions which were signed by Apcar, Avdall, Agabeb,\r\nand others of the body—declaratory of their apprehension for the safety\r\nof Calcutta and its inhabitants; their sincere loyalty to the British\r\ngovernment; their grateful appreciation of its mild and paternal rule;\r\nand their fervent hope that the energetic measures adopted would suffice\r\nto quell the insurrectionary spirit: concluding, ‘We beg most\r\nrespectfully to convey to your lordship in council the expression of our\r\nwillingness and readiness to tender our united services to our rulers,\r\nand to co-operate with our fellow-citizens for maintaining tranquillity\r\nand order in the city.’ The Armenians, wherever settled, are a peaceful\r\npeople, loving trade better than fighting: their adhesion to the\r\ngovernment was certain.\r\n\r\nThe French inhabitants in like manner held a meeting, and sent up an\r\naddress to the governor-general by the hands of Consul Angelucci. They\r\nsaid: ‘Viewing the dangers that, from one moment to another, may menace\r\nlife and property at Calcutta, all the French resident in the city unite\r\nwith one accord, and place themselves at the disposal of your excellency\r\nin case of need; beseeching that their services may be accepted for the\r\ncommon good, and as a proof of their loyalty and attachment towards her\r\nMajesty, the Queen of England.’\r\n\r\nIt is more interesting, however, in reference to such a time and such a\r\nplace, to know in what way the influential native inhabitants comported\r\nthemselves on the occasion. The meetings held, resolutions passed, and\r\naddresses presented, were remarkable for their earnestness, real or\r\napparent. Although Viscount Canning gladly and promptly acknowledged\r\nthem as valuable testimonials; yet the subsequent lying and treachery in\r\nmany quarters were such that it is impossible to decide how much or how\r\nlittle sincerity was involved in declarations of loyalty. There was a\r\nbody of Hindoo gentlemen at Calcutta, called the British Indian\r\nAssociation. The committee of the Association held a meeting on the 22d\r\nof May, and the secretary, Issur Chunder Singh, forwarded an address\r\nfrom the committee to the government. The address asseverated that the\r\natrocities at Meerut and Delhi had been heard of with great concern;\r\nthat the committee viewed with disgust and horror the excesses of the\r\nsoldiery at those stations; and that such excesses would not meet with\r\ncountenance or support from the bulk of the civil population, or from\r\nany reputable or influential classes among them. The committee recorded\r\n‘their conviction of the utter groundlessness of the reports which have\r\nled a hitherto faithful body of the soldiers of the state to the\r\ncommission of the gravest crimes of which military men or civil subjects\r\ncan be guilty; and the committee deem it incumbent on them on the\r\npresent occasion to express their deep abhorrence of the practices and\r\npurposes of those who have spread those false and mischievous reports.’\r\nFinally, they expressed their belief that the loyalty of the Hindoos,\r\nand their confidence in the power and good intentions of the government,\r\nwould be unimpaired by ‘the detestable efforts which have been made to\r\nalienate the minds of the sepoys and the people of the country from\r\ntheir duty and allegiance to the beneficent rule under which they are\r\nplaced.’\r\n\r\nThree days later, a meeting was held of Hindoo persons of influence\r\ngenerally, at Calcutta, without reference to the British Indian\r\nAssociation; and the chairman of this meeting, Bahadoor Radhakant Rajah,\r\nwas commissioned to forward a copy of resolutions to the\r\ngovernor-general. These resolutions were similar in character to those\r\npassed by the Association; but two others were added of very decided\r\ncharacter: ‘That this meeting is of opinion that, should occasion\r\nrequire, it would be the duty of the native portion of her Majesty’s\r\nsubjects to render the government every aid in their power for the\r\npreservation of civil order and tranquillity; and that, with a view to\r\ngive an extensive circulation to the proceedings of this meeting,\r\ntranslations of the same into the vernacular dialects of the country\r\nshall be printed and distributed amongst the native population.’\r\n\r\nAnother Hindoo manifestation was remarkable for the mode in which the\r\nintentions of the persons concerned were proposed to be carried out. A\r\nmeeting was held on the 23d, of ‘some young men, at the premises of\r\nBaboo Gooroo Churn Dey, Bhowanipore, Chuckerbaria, in the suburbs of\r\nCalcutta: to consider the best means of keeping the peace in the said\r\nsuburban town at this crisis of panic caused by some mutinous\r\nregiments.’ These ‘young men,’ who appointed Baboo Gooroo Churn Dey and\r\nEssan Chunder Mullick as secretary and assistant-secretary, threw into\r\ntheir deliberations an abundance of youthful enthusiasm not to be found\r\nin the resolutions of their seniors. Their plan—not expressed in, or\r\ntranslated into, very good English—was: ‘That some of the members will\r\nalternately take round at every night, with the view of catching or\r\ndetecting any wrong-doer that may be found in the work of abetting some\r\nsuch malicious tales or rumours, as the town will be looted and\r\nplundered by the sepoys on some certain day, and its inhabitants be cut\r\nto pieces; and will, by every means in their power, impress on the minds\r\nof timid and credulous people the idea of the mightiness of the power of\r\nthe British government to repel aggression of any foreign enemy, however\r\npowerful and indomitable, or put down any internal disturbance and\r\ndisorder.’ They announced their success in obtaining many ‘strong and\r\nbrave men’ to aid them in this work.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans of Calcutta were a little behind the rest of the\r\ninhabitants in time, but not in expressed sentiment, concerning the\r\nposition of public affairs. On the 27th, many of the leading men of that\r\nreligion held a meeting; one was a deputy-magistrate; two were pleaders\r\nin the sudder or native courts of law; others were moulvies, moonshees,\r\nhadjis, agas, &c.; and all signed their names in full—such as Hadji\r\nMahomed Hashim Ishphahanee, and Aga Mahomed Hassan Kooza Kenanee.\r\nNothing could be more positive than some of the assertions contained in\r\nthe resolutions passed by this meeting: ‘We subjects are well aware that\r\nthe members of the British government, from the commencement of their\r\ndominion in Hindostan, have repeatedly declared and made known their\r\ndetermination not to interfere with the religion or religious\r\nobservances of any of their subjects; and we repose entire faith in this\r\ndeclaration, and assert, that up to the present time, a space of nearly\r\none hundred years, our religion has never been interfered with. A number\r\nof us having left our homes, have found a dwelling and asylum under this\r\ngovernment, where we live in peace and safety, protected by the equity\r\nand fostering care of the British government, and suffering no kind of\r\ninjury or loss. As we have ever lived in safety and comfort under the\r\nBritish rule, and have never been molested or interfered with in\r\nreligious matters; we therefore, with the utmost eagerness and\r\nsincerity, hereby determine, that in case of necessity we will serve the\r\ngovernment to the utmost of our abilities and means.’ In true oriental\r\nform the resolutions ended, in allusion to the governor-general, ‘May\r\nhis prosperity increase!’\r\n\r\nWhat _could_ Viscount Canning say to all this? How could he, in that\r\nearly stage of the commotions, but believe in the sincerity of these\r\nmen: and, believing, to thank them for their expression of loyalty and\r\nsupport? His official reply, in each case, conveyed in pointed terms his\r\nconviction that the disaffection among the sepoys was only local and\r\ntemporary. He could not at that time foresee how severely this\r\nconviction would be put to the test.\r\n\r\nThe hostility to the governor-general, manifested at a later date by\r\nsome of the English inhabitants of Calcutta, will be noticed in its due\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nLeaving Calcutta, the reader is invited to direct his attention to towns\r\nand districts north and northwest, following the course of the Hoogly\r\nand the Ganges, up to the busy scenes of mutiny and warfare. The whole\r\ndistrict from Calcutta to Benares _by land_ is singularly devoid of\r\ninterest. The railway is open through Burdwan to Raneegunge; but thence\r\nto the great Hindoo capital there is scarcely a town or village worthy\r\nof note, scarcely one in which the mutineers disturbed the peaceful\r\noccupations of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThree military stations on the Hoogly—Dumdum, Barrackpore, and\r\nBerhampore—all concerned, as we have seen, in the cartridge\r\ndisturbances—remained quiet during the month of May, after the\r\ndisbandments. One inquiry connected with those occurrences, not yet\r\nadverted to, must here be noticed. The conduct of Colonel S. G. Wheler,\r\ncommanding the 34th regiment B. N. I.,[13] occupied much attention on\r\nthe part of the Calcutta government, during and after the proceedings\r\nrelating to the disbanding of the seven companies of that regiment at\r\nBarrackpore. Rumours reached the government that the colonel had used\r\nlanguage towards his men, indicating his expectation that they would be\r\nconverted to Christianity, and that he had addressed them on religious\r\nsubjects generally. In the usual epistolary formalism of routine, the\r\nsecretary to the government was requested to request Major-general\r\nHearsey to request Brigadier Grant to request Colonel Wheler to furnish\r\nsome reply to those rumours. The substance of the colonel’s reply was\r\ncontained in these words: ‘During the last twenty years and upwards, I\r\nhave been in the habit of speaking to the natives of all classes, sepoys\r\nand others, making no distinction, since there is no respect of persons\r\nwith God, on the subject of our religion, in the highways, cities,\r\nbazaars, and villages—not in the lines and regimental bazaars. I have\r\ndone this from a conviction that every converted Christian is expected,\r\nor rather commanded, by the Scriptures to make known the glad tidings of\r\nsalvation to his lost fellow-creatures: our Saviour having offered\r\nhimself as a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, by which alone\r\nsalvation can be secured.’ He quoted from the Epistle to the Romans to\r\nprove that a Christian must necessarily be a better subject to any state\r\nthan a non-Christian. He declared, however, that he had not given the\r\nsepoys cause for believing that any proselyting violence would be used\r\nagainst their own religion. Viscount Canning, passing over in silence\r\nthe Scriptural phraseology used by Colonel Wheler, wished to ascertain\r\nwhether the colonel’s religious conversations had been held with the men\r\nof the 34th regiment as well as with other natives: seeing that the\r\ncritical subject at that particular time was the dogged suspicion of the\r\nsepoys of that regiment on matters affecting their faith. In a second\r\nletter, Colonel Wheler adopted a still more decidedly evangelical tone.\r\nHe stated that it was his custom to address _all_ natives, whether\r\nsepoys or not, on religious matters. ‘I have told them plainly that they\r\nare all lost and ruined sinners both by nature and by practice, like\r\nmyself; that we can do nothing to save ourselves in the way of\r\njustifying ourselves in the sight of God. Our hearts being sinful, all\r\nour works must consequently be sinful in His sight; and therefore there\r\ncan be no salvation by works, on which they are all resting and\r\ndepending.’ This homily, singular as forming part of a military reply to\r\na military question, was carried to a considerable length. On matters of\r\nplain fact, Colonel Wheler stated that it was most certain that he had\r\nendeavoured by argument and exhortation to convert sepoys as well as\r\nothers to Christianity; that he was in the habit of enforcing by the\r\nonly standard which he could admit to be valid, objections concerning\r\n‘the efficacy of their own works of washing in the Ganges, proceeding on\r\npilgrimage, worshipping all kinds of creatures instead of the Creator,\r\nand other methods of man’s invention.’ Finally, he announced his\r\ndetermination to adhere to the same policy, even if his worldly position\r\nwere injured thereby: taking shame to himself for his past lukewarmness\r\nas a soldier of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the members of the Supreme Court at Calcutta at once\r\ndecided that an officer, holding Colonel Wheler’s views of duty, ought\r\nnot to remain in command of a native regiment, especially at such a\r\ncritical period. The question was not, whether that officer was a good\r\nChristian, anxious to communicate to others what he himself fervently\r\nbelieved; but whether the black gown was not more suitable to him than\r\nthe red coat, in such a country and at such a time.\r\n\r\nThe native troops at Barrackpore and Chittagong, after the disbandment\r\nof the mutinous corps, made professions of loyalty and fidelity to the\r\ngovernment, concerning the sincerity of which it is now exceedingly\r\ndifficult to judge. One theory is, that the men were designing\r\nhypocrites from the first; but the frequent examples of wavering and\r\nirresolution, afforded during the progress of the mutiny, seem to shew\r\nrather that the sepoys were affected by the strength of the temptation\r\nand example at each particular time and place. Be this as it may, some\r\nof the petitions and addresses deserve notice. Towards the close of May\r\na petition, written in the Persian character (much used in India), was\r\nprepared by the native officers of the 70th regiment B. N. I., stationed\r\nat Barrackpore, and presented to their commander, Colonel Kennedy. In\r\nthe names of themselves and the sepoys they said: ‘It is reported that\r\nEuropean troops are going up to Delhi and other places, to coerce the\r\nmutinous and rebellious there; and we wish to be sent with them also. In\r\nconsequence of the misconduct of these traitors and scoundrels,\r\nconfidence in us is weakened, although we are devoted to government; and\r\nwe therefore trust that we may be sent wherever the European troops go;\r\nwhen, having joined them, we will, by bravery even greater than theirs,\r\nregain our good name and trustworthiness. You will then know what really\r\ngood sepoys are.’ Colonel Kennedy, in a letter to Major-general Hearsey,\r\nexpressed his full belief that the men were sincere in their\r\nprotestations; and added, that hitherto he had always been satisfied\r\nwith the regiment. So important did this manifestation appear to\r\nViscount Canning, that he went to Barrackpore in order to thank the men\r\nin person. He appeared before them on parade, on the 27th, and said,\r\namong other things: ‘Men of the 70th, I will answer your petition. You\r\nhave asked to be sent to confront the mutineers of Delhi. You shall go.\r\nIn a few days, as soon as the arrangements can be made for your\r\nprogress, you shall proceed to the northwest.’ He expressed his\r\nconviction that they would keep their promise to vie with the Europeans\r\nin fidelity and bravery; and added: ‘You have another duty to perform.\r\nYou are going where you will find men, your brothers in arms, who have\r\nbeen deluded into the suspicion against which _you_ have kept firm, that\r\nthe government has designs against their religion or their caste. Say to\r\nthem that you at least do not credit this; that you know it to be\r\nuntrue; that for a hundred years the British government has carefully\r\nrespected the feelings of its Indian subjects in matters of caste and\r\nreligion.’\r\n\r\nArrangements were immediately made for sending this faithful, or\r\napparently faithful, regiment to districts where it might render useful\r\nservice. As there was an insufficient supply of steamers available, the\r\ngovernment resolved to send the regiment the whole distance from\r\nBarrackpore to Allahabad by country boats on the Ganges—an excessively\r\nprotracted voyage of eight hundred miles, as the reader is already\r\naware. When the men were about to start, they expressed to Colonel\r\nKennedy a wish that the new Enfield rifle should be served out to them.\r\nThey declared themselves entirely satisfied with the explanations\r\nconcerning the cartridges; and they added, in a written petition to\r\nwhich the names of twelve subadars and jemadars were appended: ‘We have\r\nthought over the subject; and as we are now going up the country, we beg\r\nthat the new rifles, about which there has been so much said in the army\r\nand all over the country, may be served out to us. By using them in its\r\nservice, we hope to prove beyond a doubt our fidelity to government; and\r\nwe will explain to all we meet that there is nothing objectionable in\r\nthem: otherwise, why should we have taken them? Are we not as careful of\r\nour caste and religion as any of them?’ All the native officers of this\r\nregiment, so far as can be judged from the names appended to the\r\npetition, were Hindoos. When the 70th started to the northwest, every\r\neffort was made by the government to set the unhappy cartridge troubles\r\nwholly at rest, and to enlist the services of the sepoys of that\r\nregiment in diffusing among their compatriots a knowledge of the real\r\nfacts. Orders, instructions, memoranda, circulars were brought into\r\nrequisition to explain—that the new rifle fired nine hundred yards,\r\nagainst the two hundred yards’ range of the old musket; that it was\r\nlighter than the musket; that its great range and its lightness caused\r\nit to be introduced into the Anglo-Indian army; that the new\r\nrifle-bullets, requiring machinery for their manufacture, were sent out\r\nfrom England in a finished state; that a few cartridges for those\r\nbullets were in the first instance sent out ready prepared with a\r\nlubricant, but that the Indian government resolved not to issue them to\r\nthe native troops, in deference to their religious scruples; that the\r\ncartridge-paper had long been, and would continue to be, made at\r\nSerampore, without any admixture of grease; that every native regiment\r\nwould be allowed to lubricate its cartridges with any suitable substance\r\npreferred by the men; and that the practice of biting off the ends of\r\nthe cartridges might be wholly dispensed with. In short, everything that\r\ncould be done, was done, to remove a suspicion unsound in its origin,\r\nand pernicious in its continuance.\r\n\r\nAnother regiment, the 34th B. N. I., adopted nearly the same course as\r\nthe 70th. The larger portion of this regiment, it will be remembered,\r\nwas at Barrackpore at the time of the cartridge troubles; but the rest\r\nwas at Chittagong. The sepoys in this last-named detachment came forward\r\nwith a very pointed declaration of their loyalty. Captain Dewaal, in\r\ncommand of that detachment, assembled his men one day towards the end of\r\nApril, and told them how shamefully their companions had acted at\r\nBarrackpore, and how much disgrace had thereby been brought upon the\r\nregiment. Two days afterwards, an address or petition was presented to\r\nhim, signed by the subadars and havildars in the names of all; in which\r\nregret was expressed for the conduct of the mutineers at Barrackpore.\r\n‘By a careful performance,’ the petitioners said, ‘of our duties, we\r\nhave gained a reputation for fidelity to government. These men have\r\ndeprived us of it. We well know that the government will not interfere\r\nwith our religion. We hope that the government will consider us as\r\nfaithful as ever; and we pray that this petition may be sent to the\r\ngovernor-general, in order that his lordship may know the state of our\r\nfeelings.’ Three or four weeks later, when this remnant of the regiment\r\nhad been removed to Barrackpore, the men made another profession of\r\ntheir loyalty. In a petition to their commander, they said: ‘Some\r\nevil-disposed men of the regiment have deprived us of the reputation for\r\nloyalty which we have ever held. They have received the fruits of their\r\nmisconduct by being disbanded. We that remain are willing to serve\r\nagainst the mutineers at Delhi, and are anxious to recover our lost\r\nname. We pray that the government will ever regard us as faithful\r\nsoldiers.’\r\n\r\nTwo further examples of a similar kind were presented, one by the 43d\r\nand another by the 63d regiments B. N. I. About the end of May, the\r\ncommandant of the first of these two regiments at Barrackpore, received\r\na petition signed by the native commissioned officers, praying that the\r\nregiment might be allowed to proceed against the mutineers at Delhi—a\r\nwish that had been previously expressed to him on parade. Nearly at the\r\nsame time Captain Pester, commanding the 63d at Berhampore, received a\r\npetition signed by the whole of the native officers on parade, intended\r\nto be forwarded to the governor-general; and, this petition being\r\nafterwards read in the native language to the whole regiment, the sepoys\r\nunanimously expressed their concurrence in the sentiments it conveyed.\r\nThe petitioners said: ‘We have this day heard on parade the order issued\r\nby your lordship consequent on the petition forwarded by the native\r\nofficers and sepoys of the 70th regiment of native infantry. On hearing\r\nthe same, we were greatly rejoiced; for, in truth, all the men of that\r\nregiment have behaved as becomes loyal and faithful soldiers, and your\r\nlordship has in every way been pleased with them. Now do we also all\r\npetition that we may be numbered among the good and trustworthy soldiers\r\nof the state, as we have always been; and we are prepared and ready,\r\nwith heart and hand, to go wherever, and against whomsoever you may\r\nplease to send us, should it even be against our own kinsmen.’\r\n\r\nThe governor-general could do no other than receive these\r\ndemonstrations. Whether he acceded to the request for permission to\r\n‘march against the mutineers,’ depended necessarily on the military\r\narrangements of the time; whether he fully believed the protestations,\r\nmay perhaps be doubted, although no disbelief was expressed.\r\n\r\nHappily for Bengal, it was affected by few of the disturbances that\r\nagitated the more western provinces. Consulting a map, we shall see that\r\nthe banks of the Hoogly and the Lower Ganges are thickly studded with\r\ntowns; and it may here at once be stated, that the peaceful industry of\r\nthese towns was very little interrupted during the month of May. Tracing\r\nupwards from Calcutta, we meet with Dumdum, Barrackpore, and Serampore,\r\nthe first two of which experienced a lull after the storm. Serampore was\r\nonce the _Alsatia_ of Calcutta, a place of refuge for schemers,\r\ninsolvent debtors, and reckless adventurers; but the Company bought it\r\nfrom the Danish government, to which it had belonged, and the Baptist\r\nmissionaries helped to civilise it; it is now a clean cheerful town,\r\nwith a large paper-manufactory. Higher up is the once flourishing but\r\nnow decayed town of Chandernagore, one of the few places in India still\r\nbelonging to the French. Near this is Chinsura, held by the Dutch until\r\n1825, but now a flourishing settlement belonging to the Company,\r\nprovided with an extensive military depôt for Europeans, with a\r\nmagnificent hospital and barracks. Then we come to Hoogly, a town\r\nbearing the same name as the river on whose banks it stands: a busy\r\nplace, with many civil and educational establishments. Further north is\r\nPlassy, the place near which Clive fought the great battle that\r\nvirtually gave India to the British. Beyond this is Berhampore, which,\r\nvery refractory in March and April, had become tractable and obedient in\r\nMay. Next we meet with Moorshedabad and its suburb Cossimbazar. Once the\r\ncapital of Bengal when a Mohammedan dominion, Moorshedabad contained a\r\nsplendid palace belonging to the nawab; but though no longer possessed\r\nof this kind of greatness, the city is commercially very important, as\r\nstanding on the great highway, or rather water-way, from Calcutta to the\r\nnorthwest. All the places above named are situated either on the Hoogly\r\nor on the Bhagruttee, those two rivers combining to form the most\r\nconvenient outlet from the Ganges to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Ganges itself, too—the majestic, far-famed, sacred Ganges—was little\r\ndisturbed by commotions in May throughout the lower part of its course.\r\nRajmahal, Bhagulpore, Curruckpore, Monghir, Behar, Futwah, Patna,\r\nHajeepoor, Dinapoor, Chupra, Arrah, Bishunpore, Buxar, Ghazeepore—all\r\nlie on or near the Ganges between the Hoogly and Benares. Some of these\r\nplaces are centres of commerce for the opium-trade; some are busy with\r\nthe trading in rice grown in neighbouring districts; others are\r\nshipping-places for corn and other agricultural produce; while all\r\nregard the Ganges as an invaluable channel, affording intercourse with\r\nthe rich districts of the west, and with the great focus of authority\r\nand trade at Calcutta. Such of these towns as were involved in trouble\r\nin later months of the year, will be noticed in the proper chapters; of\r\nthe others, this narrative is not called upon to treat. One fact,\r\nhowever, may be mentioned in connection with Dinapoor. So early in the\r\nyear as the middle of February, the Calcutta authorities wrote to the\r\ncommander at that town, apprising him that a messenger was known to have\r\nbeen sent to the native regiment at Dinapoor, from some men of the 2d\r\nBengal grenadiers, inciting them to mutiny. Major-general Lloyd promised\r\nto look out sharply for the messenger, but candidly expressed a doubt\r\nwhether the astute native would suffer himself to be caught.\r\n\r\nBenares may conveniently be described at once; for, whether disturbed or\r\nnot by mutineers, it is so remarkably situated as to lie in the line of\r\nroute of all commerce, all aggression, all military movement, between\r\nCalcutta and the upper provinces, whether by road, by rail, or by water.\r\nRegarded in this light, its possession and security are, and were in an\r\nespecial degree during the mutiny, objects of the highest importance.\r\nThis renowned city stands on the left bank of the Ganges, about four\r\nhundred and twenty miles by road from Calcutta, and seventy-four from\r\nAllahabad. The magnificent river, half a mile wide in the rainy season,\r\nforms a kind of semicircular bay in front of the city, which has thus\r\nthree miles of river-frontage. Among the chief characteristics of\r\nBenares are the ghats or flights of fine broad freestone steps, giving\r\naccess to the river: mostly very solid in construction, and in some\r\ncases highly decorated. So numerous are they, that they extend almost in\r\na continuous line along the river’s banks, interrupted here and there by\r\ntemples. ‘Upon these ghats,’ says a lively traveller, ‘are passed the\r\nbusiest and happiest hours of every Hindoo’s day: bathing, dressing,\r\npraying, preaching, lounging, gossiping, or sleeping, there will be\r\nfound. Escaping from the dirty, unwholesome, and confined streets, it is\r\na luxury for him to sit upon the open steps and taste the fresh air of\r\nthe river; so that on the ghats are concentrated the pastimes of the\r\nidler, the duties of the devout, and much of the necessary intercourse\r\nof business.’ Artists in India have delighted to portray the beauty and\r\nanimation of this scene; but they cannot, if they would, reveal the\r\nhideous accompaniments—the fakeers and ascetics of revolting appearance,\r\n‘offering every conceivable deformity which chalk, cow-dung, disease,\r\nmatted locks, distorted limbs, and repulsive attitudes of penance, can\r\nshew.’\r\n\r\nBenares, beyond any other place in India, perhaps, is studded with\r\nreligious structures. Thirty years ago the Moslem mosques were more than\r\nthree hundred in number, while the Hindoo temples exceeded a thousand.\r\nThe pinnacles of the Hindoo pagodas combine to give a very picturesque\r\nappearance to the city, viewed from a distance. Large as the number is,\r\nthe Benares temples, as has been sarcastically observed, are not too\r\nmany, for religion is ‘the staple article of commerce, through which the\r\nholy city flourishes and is enriched.’ The Mohammedan mosques, mostly\r\nsituated in the northeast quarter of the city, are generally elegant\r\nlittle edifices crowned by small slender minarets, each standing in a\r\ngarden planted with tamarinds. Most of them have been constructed on the\r\nsites, and with the materials, of demolished Hindoo temples. By far the\r\ngrandest is the great mosque of Aurungzebe, built by that emperor on the\r\nsite of a temple of Vishnu, which he destroyed to signalise the triumph\r\nof Islamism over Brahminism. It rises from the platform above the\r\nMadhoray Ghat. The minars or minarets, admired for their simplicity and\r\nboldness, taper from eight feet in diameter at the bottom to seven at\r\nthe top; and though so slender, they are carried up to a height of a\r\nhundred and fifty feet, and have each an interior staircase from bottom\r\nto top. The streets of Benares have the usual oriental character of\r\nnarrowness, crookedness, and dirtiness; they are mere alleys, indeed,\r\nthat will admit no wheel-carriages; nor can beasts of burden pass\r\nwithout sorely disturbing pedestrians. The houses are more lofty than in\r\nmost Indian cities, generally from three to six stories high; and as the\r\nupper stories usually project beyond the lower, the narrow street is\r\nalmost closed in above: nay, in some cases, the inmates of one house can\r\nwalk over to the opposite tenement through the upper windows. The houses\r\nare, in the better streets, built of stone, small-windowed and gaily\r\npainted. During the hot season the citizens are much accustomed to sleep\r\nin screened enclosures on the roof, open to the sky above, and to the\r\nnight-breezes around. There are somewhat under two hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, who live in about thirty thousand houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ghat on the Ganges.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBenares is a religious, not a military city. The district around was at\r\na very remote period the seat of an independent Hindoo state, founded,\r\naccording to native tradition, twelve hundred years before the Christian\r\nera. It subsequently formed part of the dominions of the Rajpoot\r\nsovereigns. Then began the Mussulman rule, and Benares became a\r\ndependent province under the Moguls. The nawab-viziers of Oude, when the\r\nMogul power was declining, seized Benares; and during some of the\r\npolitical jugglery of the year 1775, the territory was transferred to\r\nthe East India Company, by whom it has ever since been held. But under\r\nwhatever dynasty it has been placed, Benares has from remote ages been\r\nknown as the sacred city of the Hindoos, where all that is remarkable,\r\nall that is abominable, in Brahminism, flourishes. It has been described\r\nas the Jerusalem of Hindostan—swarming with religious teachers,\r\ndevotees, mendicants, and sacred bulls. To wash in the Ganges in front\r\nof Benares, to die in that city, are precious privileges to the Hindoo.\r\nSome writers have given the inhabitants a bad character in what concerns\r\nloyalty to their present British rulers. ‘Benares is one of the most\r\nunsafe and rebellious cities in Hindostan. It once successfully opposed\r\na house-tax imposed on the people by the British government. There was\r\nalso recently a strong commotion when the magistrate attempted to\r\nequalise the weights and measures. To shew the hostility of the Hindoos\r\nof Benares to the English, it may be mentioned that when we lay before\r\nBhurtpore in 1826, no less than thirty thousand sabres were sharpened at\r\nthe cutlers’ in expectation of our repulse.’ If this statement be well\r\nfounded, it does indeed denote a perilous state of feeling at the time\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nBenares, we have said, is not a military city; but so important a place\r\ncould not safely be left unguarded. Accordingly a British cantonment has\r\nbeen built at Secrole, two or three miles to the northwest. Secrole\r\ncontains not only the barracks and huts for soldiers, but various civil\r\nestablishments, and the residences of most of the British population of\r\nBenares. The cantonment consists of the usual buildings belonging to the\r\nhead-quarters of a military division of the Company’s army, and capable\r\nof accommodating three or four regiments; it lies on both sides of a\r\nsmall stream called the Burnah Nuddee, crossed by the great road from\r\nBenares to Allahabad. On the side of the cantonment furthest from the\r\ncity are the bungalows of the various officials and European residents:\r\nsubstantially built, well fitted and appointed, and surrounded by\r\npleasant gardens. There are, among the public buildings, a Christian\r\nchurch and chapel, a court of justice, the treasury, the jail, and a\r\nmint—the last named never yet appropriated to its destined purpose.\r\nSecrole is thus, in effect, the British portion of Benares.\r\n\r\nAnother military station, subordinate to Benares, Chunar or Chunargur,\r\nis about sixteen miles distant; indeed, being nearly midway between\r\nBenares and Mirzapore, it may be an auxiliary to either in time of need.\r\nChunar is a town of about twelve thousand inhabitants, standing on a\r\nplateau or elevated cliff close to the Ganges. It was regarded as a\r\nstronghold more than three centuries ago; and, like many other places in\r\nthe neighbourhood, belonged to the great Mogul; from whom, in lapse of\r\ntime, it was wrested by the ambitious nawab-viziers of Oude; until at\r\nlength it fell into the hands of the British. It was for some years the\r\nCompany’s principal artillery depôt for the Northwestern Provinces. The\r\nfortified portion of the town, on the heights, is surrounded by a\r\nrampart a little over a mile in circuit, and from ten to twenty feet\r\nhigh, guarded by towers, and in its turn completely commanding the river\r\nand its banks. The space enclosed by this wall or rampart, however, has\r\nvery little of a military aspect; part is open grass-land; part occupied\r\nby bungalows and gardens of Europeans; part by the governor’s house, the\r\nhospital, and the state prison; and part by the ancient Hindoo palace, a\r\nmassy vaulted edifice presenting little of its original splendour. An\r\narticle of Hindoo faith is recorded in connection with a slab of black\r\nmarble in a small square court of this palace; to the effect that ‘the\r\nAlmighty is seated personally, though invisibly, on this stone, for nine\r\nhours each day, removing during the other three hours to Benares;’ so\r\nthat the fort, in sepoy belief, can only be taken between the hours of\r\nsix and nine in the morning. Considered in a military sense, the fort is\r\nby no means strong; nevertheless the steepness of the ascent would\r\nrender storming difficult; and to increase this difficulty, the garrison\r\nwas wont in former times to keep a number of large rudely made\r\nstone-cylinders at hand, to roll down upon a besieging force. The\r\ncitadel or stronghold is in the northeastern part of the enclosure; it\r\nis mounted with several cannon, and has a bomb-proof magazine. The\r\nnative town, consisting principally of two-storied stone-houses, is\r\nspread over a slope lying eastward of the fortifications. The English\r\ndwellings, and the station for invalid soldiers, are lower down the\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Revolt began, the safety of Benares became an object of\r\nmuch solicitude to the governor-general at Calcutta, to Sir Henry\r\nLawrence at Lucknow, and indeed to all the Company’s servants: seeing\r\nthat the maintenance of free communication would greatly depend on the\r\npeaceful condition of that city. We have seen that telegrams passed\r\nalmost daily between Benares and the other chief cities in May; intended\r\npartly to facilitate the transport of reinforcements to the northwest,\r\nand in part also to insure the tranquillity of Benares itself. About the\r\nmiddle of the month the military commandant had to announce that there\r\nhad been some excitement in the 37th native infantry; that a Sikh\r\nregiment had been sent on to Mirzapore and Allahabad; that the 13th\r\nirregular cavalry were at Sultanpore; and that his position was rather\r\nweak. On the 18th he telegraphed for aid: stating that ‘if one hundred\r\nEuropean infantry could be spared for duty here, it would restore\r\nconfidence, and make Benares more secure, so as to maintain\r\ncommunication with the northwest.’ General Lloyd was asked whether he\r\ncould spare that much-coveted reinforcement—a hundred Europeans—from\r\nDinapoor. About the same time the commandant was directed to defend\r\nChunar fort with European invalids and veterans, and to keep the native\r\ninfantry regiment at hand in Benares. Mr Tucker, civil commissioner,\r\nwriting to the government on the same day, spoke of the ‘bold policy’\r\nwhich had been adopted when the 37th shewed disaffection; the Europeans\r\nremaining in their houses, and acting so as neither to exhibit nor\r\ninspire distrust—instead of attempting to escape. On the 19th,\r\narrangements were completed for sending a company of her Majesty’s 84th\r\nfrom Dumdum to Benares, in five separate parties of twenty-one each, in\r\ntransit-carriages. By the 19th, the irregular cavalry had been brought\r\nin from Sultanpore, and every precaution taken to guard against a\r\nsurprise—insomuch that the Europeans at neighbouring stations were\r\nlooking to Benares as a sort of stay and support. More than once\r\nallusion was made, by the civil commissioner at that city, to the\r\ntactics of serenity, as a medium between severity and fright. One of the\r\ntelegrams told that ‘Brigadier Ponsonby carries out Colonel Gordon’s\r\nquiet policy of shewing no fear or distrust; not a muscle is moved.’\r\nUntil towards the close of the month, Benares was included in the\r\nmilitary command of which Dinapoor was the centre; but as the distance\r\nbetween the two towns is a hundred and fifty miles, Brigadier Ponsonby\r\nreceived permission to act for himself, irrespective of control from\r\nGeneral Lloyd.\r\n\r\nThe 31st of May found Benares and its neighbourhood at peace. How close\r\nat hand were days of violence and bloodshed—a future chapter will shew.\r\n\r\nWe have now left Bengal, both in its original and in the Company’s\r\nacceptation of that term, and have arrived within the territories\r\ngrouped together as the Northwest Provinces. From Benares and Chunargur,\r\nas a glance at the map will shew, the course of the Ganges, of the great\r\ntrunk-road, and of the railway in process of construction, brings us to\r\nMirzapore—a town not actually thrown into rebellion during the month of\r\nMay, but placed between two foci of inflammable materials, Benares and\r\nAllahabad, and liable at any time to be inflamed by them. Mirzapore is\r\non the right bank of the Ganges, which is half a mile wide at this spot,\r\nand is crossed by a ferry in the absence of a bridge. It is a great\r\ncommercial city, with about eighty thousand inhabitants; the emporium of\r\nthe cotton trade of Bundelcund and the adjacent provinces; not rich in\r\nMohammedan or Hindoo antiquities or splendour, associated with few\r\nmilitary events, but wealthy on account of its industry. The Company’s\r\nmilitary cantonment, as in so many other parts of India, is two or three\r\nmiles out of the town; indeed, this is a fact that must be borne in mind\r\nthroughout, as a necessary condition to the understanding of events\r\nconnected with the Revolt.\r\n\r\nApproaching now the Jumna regions, the plot thickens and the characters\r\nincrease in number. We come to that rich country, the Doab, watered on\r\nthe one side by the Ganges and on the other by the Jumna, with Oude and\r\nRohilcund on the north, Bundelcund and Scindiah’s territory on the\r\nsouth. We find a considerable number of large and important\r\ntowns—Lucknow, Fyzabad, Bareilly, Allahabad, Futtehpoor, Cawnpore,\r\nFurruckabad, Gwalior, Bhurtpore, Agra, Delhi, Meerut—in the immediate\r\nvicinity of one or other of these two rivers. The Company’s military\r\nstations are far more thickly posted in that region than in any other\r\npart of India—a source of weakness in the midst of apparent strength;\r\nfor as the native troops were predominant in all these places, their\r\nnumbers became a manifest evil as soon as a mutinous spirit appeared\r\namong the men.\r\n\r\nThis chapter being mainly intended, as already explained, to shew how\r\nremarkably the materials for explosion were accumulating during the\r\nmonth of May, to burst forth with frightful violence in June, we shall\r\nglance rapidly and touch lightly here on many of the towns situated\r\nwestward of Mirzapore, in order to place the reader in a position to\r\nunderstand what will follow—treating of sudden outrages and strange\r\nescapes in some few cases, and in others of a deceitful calm before a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nAllahabad, in a military sense, is a more important post than any\r\nbetween it and Calcutta: indeed, there are few to equal it throughout\r\nIndia. This is due principally to the fact that it lies at the junction\r\nof the two great rivers Ganges and Jumna, the northern side being washed\r\nby the one, the southern by the other. It occupies the most eastern, or\r\nrather southeastern point of the rich and fertile Doab; it lies in the\r\ndirect water-route from Calcutta to both of the upper rivers; it is a\r\nmain station on the great trunk-road from Calcutta to the Punjaub, and\r\non the East India Railway now in course of construction; and a bridge\r\nwill carry that railway across the Jumna close to it. No wonder,\r\ntherefore, if the eyes of all were directed anxiously towards Allahabad\r\nduring the mutinies and consequent struggles. The fort and arsenal are\r\namong the largest and finest in India. The fort rises direct from the\r\npoint of confluence of the two rivers, and is on that side nearly\r\nimpregnable. It is a mile and a half in circuit, five-sided, stone\r\nbuilt, and bastioned. Two of the sides, near the water, are old, and\r\nweak as against a European force; the other three are modern, and, with\r\ntheir bastions and ravelins, command the city and the country beyond.\r\nBishop Heber remarked that Allahabad fort had lost in grandeur what it\r\nhad gained in strength: the lofty towers having been pruned down into\r\nbastions and cavaliers, and its high stone ramparts obscured by turf\r\nparapets and a sloping external glacis. The principal gate of the fort,\r\nsurmounted by a dome with a wide hall beneath, and surrounded by arcades\r\nand galleries, forms a very majestic ornament. The arsenal, situated\r\nwithin the fort, is one of great magnitude, containing (before the\r\nRevolt) arms for thirty thousand men, an immense park of artillery, and\r\nthe largest powder-magazine in Upper India. Altogether, it is a place of\r\ngreat strength, probably impregnable to natives, and fitted to bear a\r\nprolonged and formidable siege. In a part of the fort overlooking the\r\nJumna is an ancient and spacious palace, formerly fitted up as\r\nresidences for the superior European officers, but latterly used for\r\nstate prisoners. From a balcony perched near the summit of a tower on\r\nwhich the windows of one of the chambers open, a scene is presented, of\r\nwhich European travellers in India speak with much admiration. The\r\nspectator looks down upon a grove of mango-trees, flanking a fine\r\nesplanade, and peopled with innumerable ring-necked paroquets. Above, on\r\npediment, pinnacle, and turret, others of the feathered tribe build\r\ntheir nests and plume their wings. Along the thickly wooded shores on\r\nthe north or Allahabad side of the Jumna, buildings of various degrees\r\nof interest are seen interspersed with the small islands which speckle\r\nthe river; while the opposite or Bundelcund shore forms a noble\r\nbackground to the picture. In the days before the Revolt, the European\r\ntroops of the garrison were accommodated in well-constructed barracks\r\nwithin the fort; while the military cantonment for the native troops lay\r\nnorthwest of it.\r\n\r\nThe city of Allahabad, westward of the fort, and on the Jumna shore, is\r\nscarcely worthy of its magnificent situation. It contains seventy\r\nthousand inhabitants; but its streets and houses are poor; nor do the\r\nmosques and temples equal those in many other parts of Hindostan, though\r\nthe gardens and tomb of Sultan Khosroo and his serai are almost\r\nunequalled in India. There is a particular spot, outside the fort, where\r\nthe actual confluence of the two great rivers is considered to take\r\nplace; and this presents the liveliest scene in the whole city. One\r\ntraveller tells of the great numbers of pilgrims of both sexes, anxious\r\nto bathe in the purifying waters; and of devotees who, causing earthen\r\nvessels to be fastened round their waists or to their feet, proceed in a\r\nboat to the middle of the stream, and precipitate themselves into the\r\nwater—supposing that by this self-immolation they secure eternal bliss.\r\nAnother states that when a pilgrim arrives here—Benares, Gyayah, and\r\nAllahabad being frequently included in the same pilgrimage—he sits down\r\non the brink of the river, and causes his head and body to be so shaved\r\nthat each hair may fall into the water—for the sacred writings promise\r\nthe pilgrim a million years’ residence in heaven for every hair thus\r\ndeposited—and that, after shaving and bathing, he performs the obsequies\r\nof his deceased ancestors. The Brahmins are the money-makers at these\r\nspots; each has his little platform, standing in the water, where he\r\nassists in the operations by which the pilgrim is supposed to become\r\nholy. Skinner describes the whole scene as a kind of religious fair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  City and Fort of ALLAHABAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the events at Meerut and Delhi became known at Allahabad, the\r\nnative troops shewed much excitement. One of them, the 6th Bengal\r\ninfantry, drew down encomiums for fidelity, in offering to march and\r\nfight against the insurgents; whether all the officers believed the men,\r\nmay be doubted; but the chief authorities did not deem themselves\r\njustified in shewing distrust. Thanks came from Calcutta for the\r\nmanifestation of loyalty made by the regiment—a loyalty destined to be\r\nof brief duration. A detachment of her Majesty’s 84th reached Allahabad\r\non the 23d of May, sent up from Calcutta by the laboriously tedious\r\nmethods lately described. There being some disturbance expected at the\r\njail, the detachment was sent into the fort, and held in readiness to\r\nproceed to the cantonment with two guns; but as the alarm ceased for a\r\ntime, the troops were sent on to Cawnpore, where much more anxiety was\r\nfelt. Lieutenant Brasyer commanded four hundred Sikhs of the Ferozpore\r\nregiment in the fort; while Captain Hazelwood took charge of the\r\nEuropean artillerymen. About two hundred Englishwomen and children were\r\nin the fort; and all hoped that the native troops in the cantonment\r\ncould and would be kept in subjection. How far this hope was well\r\nfounded, will be shewn in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nLucknow and the important territory of Oude, so far as concerns the\r\nevents in May, have already been treated. The relations of the British\r\ngovernment to the court of Oude, the assiduous exertions of Sir Henry\r\nLawrence to maintain subordination and tranquillity, and the vigorous\r\nmeasures adopted by him against the mutineers at Lucknow towards the\r\nclose of the month of May, were followed by occurrences in June which\r\nwill come for notice in their proper place.\r\n\r\nOf Cawnpore—a name never to be uttered by an English tongue without a\r\nthrill of horror, an agony of exasperated feeling—all notice will be\r\npostponed until the next chapter; not because the hapless beings there\r\nresiding were free from peril in the month of May, but because the\r\ntragedy must be treated continuously as a whole, each scene leading\r\nforward to the hideous climax. Suffice it at present to know that\r\nCawnpore contained so many English men and women, and so many mutinous\r\nnative troops, that all eyes were anxiously directed towards the\r\nprogress of events at that city.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to towns and districts further westward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Agra Fort.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAgra, once the capital of the Patan emperors, is the chief city of the\r\nNorthwestern Provinces. Delhi is historically, and in population, more\r\nimportant; but was still at that time nominally under another sovereign;\r\nwhereas Agra has been British territory since 1803, and is very well\r\nsuited for a seat of government. The city, like Delhi, is situated on\r\nthe right bank of the Jumna, and will, like it, be at some future time\r\naccommodated by the East India railway. In round numbers, its distance\r\nfrom Delhi is a hundred and fifty miles; from Calcutta, a little under\r\neight hundred; and from Lahore, five hundred. The boundary of the old\r\ncity encloses a space of twelve square miles; but not more than half of\r\nthis is at present occupied by houses. There is one fine street, with\r\nhouses built of red sandstone; the remaining streets are mostly narrow,\r\nwith very small, insignificant-looking shops. The public buildings are\r\nnumerous, and some of them very magnificent, telling of the past days of\r\nimperial glory and splendour. One is the palace of Shahjehan; small, but\r\nrendered very beautiful by its white marble surfaces, arabesques and\r\nmosaics, carvings of flowers, inlayings of black and yellow marble,\r\nenrichments of gilding, screen-works of marble and metal, fountains in\r\nthe mosaic pavements. Near this is Shahjehan’s audience-chamber, as\r\nlarge as the palace itself, originally enclosed by arcades hung with\r\ntapestries. And also close at hand is the Moti Musjid or Pearl Mosque;\r\nwith an exterior of red sandstone and an interior of white marble; a\r\ncourt with arcades and a fountain; a vestibule raised on steps; three\r\nterraces surmounted by beautiful domes; and nine elegant kiosks\r\nequidistant along the front. But the crowning beauty of Agra in its\r\nMohammedan aspect is the celebrated Taj Mahal, a little way outside the\r\ncity. This was the mausoleum of Shahjehan and his favourite sultaness\r\nNurjehan, the ‘Light of the world,’ and occupied in its construction\r\ntwenty thousand men during a period of more than twenty years. Page\r\nafter page of travellers’ descriptions are occupied with this glorious\r\nstructure—its façade of a thousand feet in length; its dazzling\r\nwhiteness of marble; its mosques, at either end, with their domes; its\r\nstupendous marble terraced platform, with steps and pillars, minarets\r\nand kiosks; its great dome surmounted by gilded globes and crescents;\r\nits octagonal shrine or sepulchral apartment, with enclosures of\r\nextraordinary marble latticework; and its sarcophagi, literally covered\r\nwith arabesques, fanciful mouldings, sculptured flowers, and\r\ninscriptions from the Koran.\r\n\r\nWhat a mockery of past grandeur is all this now! Shahjehan, two\r\ncenturies ago, was kept closely a prisoner in his splendour at Agra,\r\nwhile his ambitious son, Aurungzebe, was seizing the throne at Delhi;\r\nand now another race is dominant in both of those cities. Shahjehan’s\r\naudience-chamber has had its arcades walled up, and is converted into an\r\narsenal for and by the British; and near it are now an armoury, a\r\nmedical depôt, and a district collectorate treasury. Nearly all the\r\nonce-imperial buildings are within the fort, a large place nearly a mile\r\nin circuit; it contained a hundred and sixty guns when Lord Lake\r\ncaptured it in 1803. Adjacent to the city, on the west, is the\r\ngovernment-house, the official residence of the lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe Northwestern Provinces; and in various places are numerous buildings\r\nbelonging to the Company, for revenue, magisterial, and judicial\r\nestablishments. The military lines are outside the city-wall. Before the\r\nRevolt, this station was within the Meerut military division, and was\r\nusually occupied by a considerable body of European and native troops.\r\nIt was a fact of small importance in peaceful times, but of some moment\r\nwhen rebellion arose, that the civilians and writers in the public\r\noffices were accustomed to live three or four miles from the cantonment\r\ncontaining the military, quite on the opposite suburb of Agra. None\r\nwould live in the city itself, unless compelled, owing to the intense\r\nheat. It will be well to bear in mind that the fort at Agra was, as just\r\nnoticed, not merely a post or stronghold, indicated by its name, but a\r\nvast enclosure containing most of the palatial as well as the defensive\r\nbuildings, and ample enough to contain all the Europeans usually\r\nresiding in the city and its vicinity—large enough in dimensions, strong\r\nenough in defences, provided a sufficient supply of food were stored\r\nwithin its walls. Here, as at Delhi, Lucknow, Allahabad, and other\r\nplaces, the due understanding of the mutinous proceedings requires an\r\nappreciation of this fact—that the _city_, the _fort_, and the\r\n_cantonment_ were all distinct.\r\n\r\nAgra, being the seat of government for the Northwest Provinces, was\r\nnaturally the city to which the Calcutta authorities looked for\r\ninformation touching the Revolt; and Mr Colvin, the lieutenant-governor,\r\nwas assiduously engaged in collecting details, so far as telegraphs and\r\ndâks permitted. On the night of the 10th of May he received sinister\r\nnews from the postmaster at Meerut, telling of deeds of violence being\r\nat that moment committed. Next he heard that a young sepoy, mounted on a\r\ntravelling troop-horse, was stopped at Bolundshuhur, on suspicion of\r\nbeing _en route_ to excite other sepoy regiments to rebellion. On the\r\n13th, it was ascertained that a few sepoys were on their way from Meerut\r\nthrough Allygurh to Agra, bent on mischief; and that others were\r\nsupposed to be advancing from Delhi. So little, however, did Mr Colvin\r\napprehend serious results, that when Scindiah, the maharajah of Gwalior,\r\ncame forward to offer his body-guard of three hundred men, and a battery\r\nof artillery, as an aid to the Company, the governor accepted the offer\r\nas ‘a personal compliment for a short time;’ but in the same message\r\nsaying, ‘though we really do not require more troops.’ This was\r\nobviously said on the supposition that the native troops in and near\r\nAgra would not be affected by the rebellious epidemic prevailing further\r\nnorthward; a supposition destined to be sadly overturned. Nevertheless\r\nthe government made arrangements for placing at the disposal of Mr\r\nColvin two regiments of irregular horse from regions further west. Day\r\nafter day did evidence arrive shewing that the various districts around\r\nwere gradually becoming disturbed. On the 15th, the governor reviewed\r\nthe native regiments in Agra, and, finding them deeply impressed with a\r\nconviction that the government intended in some way to degrade their\r\ncaste, gave them the most positive assurance that they had been grossly\r\ndeceived by such reports. He believed his explanation to have given\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the month a step was taken by Mr Colvin which\r\nbrought him into collision with his superiors in power. As\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces, surrounded on every side\r\nby a teeming population, he wished to believe that the native troops as\r\na body would still remain faithful, and that an indulgent tone towards\r\nthem would effect more than severity to bring the erring back to a sense\r\nof their duty. It was not a thoughtless proceeding: if wrong, the\r\nmistake arose from the estimate formed of the native character, and of\r\nthe effect which indulgence would produce. ‘Hope,’ he said, in a letter\r\nto the governor-general, ‘I am firmly convinced, should be held out to\r\nall those who were not ringleaders or actually concerned in murder and\r\nviolence. Many are in the rebels’ ranks because they could not get away;\r\nmany certainly thought we were tricking them out of their caste; and\r\nthis opinion is held, however unwisely, by the mass of the population,\r\nand even by some of the more intelligent classes.’ When he found some of\r\nthe troopers of the Gwalior Contingent, on whose fidelity much reliance\r\nhad been placed, become mutinous on the 24th of May, he resolved on\r\nissuing a proclamation, based on the supposition that ‘this mutiny was\r\nnot one to be put down by indiscriminating high-horsed authority.’ The\r\npith of his proclamation was contained in these words: ‘Soldiers,\r\nengaged in the late disturbances, who are desirous of going to their own\r\nhomes, and who give up their arms at the nearest government civil or\r\nmilitary post, and retire quietly, shall be permitted to do so\r\nunmolested.’’ To this another sentence was added, in a less prominent\r\nform: ‘Every evil-minded instigator in the disturbances, and those\r\nguilty of heinous crimes against private persons, shall be punished.’ Mr\r\nColvin earnestly solicited the assent of the Calcutta government to this\r\nproclamation; but the assent was as earnestly withheld. Viscount Canning\r\ntelegraphed orders back to Agra to recall the proclamation as quickly as\r\npossible, and to substitute another sent for that purpose. ‘Use every\r\npossible means to stop the circulation of the proclamation ... do\r\neverything to stop its operation.’ Mr Colvin was obliged to announce the\r\nabrogation of his own proclamation by a second which contained these\r\nwords: ‘Every soldier of a regiment which, although it has deserted its\r\npost, has not committed outrages, will receive free pardon if he\r\nimmediately deliver up his arms to the civil or military authority, and\r\nif no heinous crimes be shewn to have been perpetrated by himself\r\npersonally. This offer of free and unconditional pardon _cannot be\r\nextended to those regiments which have killed or wounded their officers\r\nor other persons, or which have been concerned in the commission of\r\ncruel outrages_.’ Mr Colvin wished to pardon all who would give up their\r\narms, except a few ringleaders, and persons individually engaged in\r\noutrage; while Viscount Canning wished to exempt from this pardon such\r\nregiments as had been engaged in the murderous atrocities at Meerut,\r\nDelhi, and elsewhere. General Anson, the commander-in-chief, died before\r\nhis opinion could be sought; but the Calcutta government, and (at a\r\nlater date) the British government and the British public, agreed with\r\nthe governor-general. Mr Colvin was placed in a most perplexing\r\nposition; for he was called upon to overturn his own proceedings,\r\nthereby departing from a plan which he believed adequate for the purpose\r\nin view, and weakening his authority in the eyes of the natives. Canning\r\ntelegraphed to Colvin: ‘The embarrassment in which your proclamation\r\nwill place the government and the commander-in-chief is very great;’\r\nwhile Colvin telegraphed to Canning: ‘Openly to undo my public act,\r\nwhere really no substantial change is made, would fatally shake my power\r\nfor good.’ Brigadier Sibbald, commanding the Rohilcund division, with\r\nBareilly for his head-quarters, joined Mr Colvin in opinion on this\r\nmatter; he said: ‘Were the men under my command fully convinced that\r\n_the past should be forgotten_, I feel assured their loyalty and good\r\nconduct may be relied upon.’ The general tendency of opinion has been\r\nthat stern measures were necessary at that crisis; but it was\r\nunquestionably infelicitous that these contradictory views should have\r\nbeen held at such a time in high quarters.\r\n\r\nMr Colvin, perpetually harassed with the accounts daily received from\r\nthe various important towns included in his government, was nevertheless\r\nsecure at Agra itself until towards the close of the month of May. Then,\r\nhowever, he found stern measures necessary. Having two regiments of\r\nnative infantry with him, the 44th and the 67th, he sent two companies,\r\none of each regiment, to Muttra (on the Delhi road), to bring down\r\ntreasure to Agra. On the road, they mutinied, murdered some of their\r\nofficers, and hastened to join the insurgents at Delhi. Mr Colvin at\r\nonce resolved to disarm the remaining companies of those regiments: this\r\nhe was enabled to do by the presence of the 3d Europeans and Captain\r\nD’Oyley’s European field-battery; and the disarming was quietly effected\r\non the 1st of June. Shortly afterwards, a corps of volunteer horse was\r\nraised among the Europeans at Agra, and placed under the command of\r\nLieutenant Greathed—one of three brothers at that time actively engaged\r\nin the Company’s service. This corps rendered good service by putting\r\ndown rebellious petty chieftains in the neighbourhood. Mr Colvin felt\r\nthe full weight of his position; the governor-general was far from him\r\nin one direction, Sir John Lawrence far in another; while Sir Henry\r\nLawrence had no troops to spare, and the commander-in-chief could\r\nscarcely be heard of.\r\n\r\nThe great Mahratta stronghold, Gwalior, did not become a scene of mutiny\r\nuntil June; we therefore need not notice the city or its chief,\r\nScindiah, in this place; but by following the fortunes of a portion of\r\nthe Gwalior Contingent, a regiment of irregular horse, we shall learn\r\nmuch concerning the state of the country round Agra, and of the active\r\nservices required from the English officers. Mr Colvin having accepted\r\nthe proffered services of the contingent from the maharajah, Lieutenant\r\nCockburn received orders to head half the regiment, together with a\r\nbattery of guns. He started on the 13th of May from Gwalior, and\r\naccomplished the distance of ninety miles to Agra by the 15th, without\r\nknocking up man or horse. On the 18th, news arrived that troubles had\r\nbroken out at Allygurh, fifty-five miles north of Agra, and that the\r\nservices of the contingent were necessary for the protection of the\r\nladies and the civilians. Cockburn with his troopers marched thirty-four\r\nmiles to Hattrass on that day, and the remaining twenty-one miles on the\r\n19th—seeking shelter from the tremendous mid-day heat in any dilapidated\r\nbuilding that might offer; and each officer keeping in store his only\r\nclean shirt ‘to meet the fugitive ladies from Allygurh.’ What he saw,\r\nand what he had yet to see, at Allygurh, was serious enough. This town\r\nwas destined to affect the operations of the British, not so much by its\r\nintrinsic importance, as by its position on one of the great lines of\r\nroute between the eastern and western provinces of India. Allygurh\r\ncommands the road from Agra to Meerut; and thus, in hostile hands, it\r\nwould necessarily add to the difficulties attending the temporary loss\r\nof Delhi; seeing that the road both to Simla and to Lahore would thus be\r\ninterrupted. The town is so surrounded by marshes and shallow pools, as\r\nto be almost unassailable in the rainy season. The fort consists of a\r\nregular polygon, with a broad and very deep ditch outside; it was of\r\nsimple construction at the time of its capture by the British in 1803,\r\nbut has since been much strengthened and improved. The military\r\ncantonment, the civil establishments, and the bazaar, are situated\r\ntowards Coel, a little southward of the fort. At the beginning of the\r\ntroubles in May, Allygurh was under the care of Mr Watson, as magistrate\r\nand collector. There were in the place, at the time, the head-quarters\r\nand three or four companies of the 9th regiment B. N. I.: the remainder\r\nof the regiment being in detachments at Minpooree, Etawah, and\r\nBolundshuhur, towns further to the southeast. The troops at Allygurh\r\nbehaved well and steadily during the first half of the month; but\r\ngradually a change supervened. A spy was one day caught endeavouring to\r\nexcite the men. Lieutenant Cockburn, in a private letter, thus narrates\r\nthe manner—quite melodramatic in its way—in which this villain was\r\nfoiled: ‘An influential Brahmin of this neighbourhood having been seen\r\nlurking about the lines for the past day or two, a native\r\nnon-commissioned officer concealed a number of sepoys, and induced the\r\nBrahmin to accompany him to where the men lay hidden; under pretence of\r\nits being a secluded spot where they might safely concert matters. The\r\nBrahmin then made overtures to the soldier, and told him that if he\r\nwould persuade the men of the regiment to mutiny, he would furnish two\r\nthousand men to assist in murdering the Europeans and plundering the\r\ntreasury. At a preconcerted signal, the sepoys jumped up and secured the\r\nruffian.’ He was hanged the same day. The troops at Bolundshuhur, really\r\nor affectedly expressing horror at the hanging of a Brahmin, marched to\r\nAllygurh, and, on the 20th, succeeded in inducing their companions to\r\nmutiny. This result was so wholly unforeseen, the 9th had hitherto\r\nbehaved so well, and had displayed such alacrity in capturing the\r\ntreacherous Brahmin, that neither the civilians nor the English officers\r\nwere prepared to resist it. Cockburn at first intended to dash at them\r\nwith his troopers; but the approaching darkness, and other\r\nconsiderations—possibly a doubt concerning the troopers themselves—led\r\nto a change of plan. ‘One holy duty remained to be performed—to save the\r\nladies and children. This we accomplished; and whilst they were being\r\nput into carriages, we shewed a front to the mutineers, and hindered\r\ntheir advance. An occasional bullet whistled by our heads, but it was\r\ntoo dark for taking aim. One man was shot through the wrist, and five\r\nare missing. We then heard that the inhabitants were rising, so we\r\ndetermined on retreating. The ladies were sent on direct to Agra, and we\r\nwent on to Hattrass. We had not gone far, when the bright light behind\r\nus told too plainly that the cantonment was in flames.’ The civilians\r\nand the officers of the 9th lost all except their horses and the clothes\r\non their backs. Allygurh remained for a considerable time in the hands\r\nof the insurgents: almost cutting off communication between the\r\nsoutheast and the northwest.\r\n\r\nWhile the refugees remained in safety at Hattrass, the troopers scoured\r\nthe country to put down marauders and murderers—for it was a saturnalia\r\nof lawlessness. On the 21st, many of the ruffians were captured, and\r\nspeedily hanged. On the 22d, two headmen of neighbouring villages joined\r\nthe marauders in an attack on some English refugees, but were\r\nfrustrated. On the 23d, Cockburn and his troop galloped off from\r\nHattrass to Sarsnee, and rescued eighteen refugees from Allygurh. ‘Poor\r\npeople! They have sad tales to tell. One indigo planter, Mr ——, has had\r\none son murdered; another son, his wife, and himself, are wounded. His\r\nhouse and all he possessed have been destroyed. The very clothes were\r\ntorn from their backs; and even the poor women, naked and bleeding,\r\ninsulted and abused, had to walk many miles. At length they received\r\nshelter from a kind-hearted native banker in the village where I found\r\nthem; but even there the house in which they were sheltered was twice\r\nattacked.’ The good Samaritan—for there were some good and kind amid all\r\nthe villainies that surrounded them—gave two or three sheets to the poor\r\nsufferers, to cover their nakedness, and to enable them to proceed to\r\nHattrass.\r\n\r\nThe 24th of May shewed how little the Gwalior troopers could be depended\r\nupon. Of two hundred and thirty that had been intrusted to Lieutenant\r\nCockburn, a hundred and twenty suddenly mutinied, and galloped off to\r\njoin the insurgents at Delhi. As the villagers began to shew symptoms of\r\nattacking him in his weakness, and as a hundred and ten troopers still\r\nstuck by their colours, he marched off that night nineteen miles from\r\nHattrass to Kundowlie. On the road, the troopers told the lieutenant of\r\nmany little grievances that had affected them at Gwalior, and that had\r\npartly led to the mutiny of the rest of their body; and he felt grateful\r\nthat some at least of the number had remained true. During the remainder\r\nof the month, and in the early part of June, this diminished body of\r\ntroopers was incessantly engaged in skirmishing, attacking, or resisting\r\nattacks; the country around being in such a frightful state, that a\r\ndozen villages were sometimes seen in flames at once—the work of\r\ndesperadoes, who took advantage of a time of anarchy. On one occasion,\r\nCockburn baffled a horde of scoundrels by a capital stratagem. They had\r\ncollected to the number of about five hundred, and were plundering every\r\none on the road in a shameful manner. The lieutenant went after them\r\nwith fifty troopers. He sent four of his men in a bullock-cart, a\r\ncurtained vehicle such as women usually ride in. When the marauders saw\r\nthis, they made a rush for plunder, and perhaps something worse,\r\nbelieving the cart to contain defenceless women; they approached, but\r\nthe four men jumped up, fired their muskets, and by that signal brought\r\nCockburn and his party forward. An exciting chase ensued, which ended in\r\nthe death of fifty of the marauders, and the capture of many others.\r\n\r\nThe 9th native regiment, it will be remembered, was quartered in four\r\ndetachments at Allygurh, Minpooree, Etawah, and Bolundshuhur. At all\r\nfour places the troops mutinied. At Etawah and Bolundshuhur, the course\r\nof events was not so exciting as at Allygurh, although amply sufficient\r\nto try the tact and courage of the few officers and civilians stationed\r\nat those places. Minpooree, on the road from Agra to Furruckabad, was,\r\nhowever, the scene of so smart an affair, that the governor-general,\r\namid all his harassing employments, made it a matter of special comment.\r\nThe officer chiefly concerned was Lieutenant de Kantzow; the date was\r\nMay the 23d, when three companies of the 9th broke out into revolt. On\r\nthe night of the 22d, news arrived that the chief portion of the\r\nregiment had mutinied at Allygurh, and it thence became at once doubtful\r\nwhether the three companies at Minpooree could be depended upon. The\r\nmagistrate and the collector of the district, acting with Lieutenant\r\nCrawford, resolved on removing all the English women and children for\r\nsafety to Agra: this was done, promptly and successfully. A plan was\r\nagreed on, relating to the three companies of native troops on the\r\nmorrow; but the sepoys anticipated this plan by mutinying at four in the\r\nmorning, and endeavouring to shoot down their officers. They loaded\r\nthemselves with a great store of ammunition, and tried—first to bring\r\ndown their officers, and then to plunder the treasury and the bungalows.\r\nLieutenant de Kantzow, second in command under Crawford, confronted them\r\nundauntedly, reasoned with them, and endeavoured to stop them in their\r\nmad career. Some of the men, attached to the chivalrous officer, dashed\r\ndown several muskets levelled at him, and saved his life. But a terrible\r\nscene occurred at the treasury. De Kantzow, with a mere handful of\r\nill-armed jail-guards and jail-officials, maintained a three hours’\r\nstruggle against three companies of fully armed troops. The commandant\r\nhad gone off; the collector also had made a hasty escape, deeming the\r\nmagistrate’s conduct ‘romantic’ in remaining behind; and thus De Kantzow\r\nwas left to do the best he could at the treasury, the magistrate\r\nelsewhere. De Kantzow sent a hasty message, requesting the magistrate\r\n_not_ to come to the treasury, as it would make one European the more\r\nfor the sepoys to yell at and attack. How long the unequal struggle\r\nwould have been maintained, cannot be said; but the magistrate found an\r\ninfluential native, Ras Bhowanee Singh, willing and able to visit the\r\nexcited sepoys, and induce them to desist from further violence. They\r\ndid so: they decamped with a good deal of property, but _without_ three\r\nlacs of rupees deposited in the treasury, and without taking one English\r\nlife. Right indeed was it that De Kantzow should receive the thanks of\r\nthe government;[14] for if he had flinched, Minpooree with its twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants would have been at the mercy of three hundred\r\nbrutal armed men, ready to plunder natives as well as Feringhees.\r\n\r\nIt was about one week after this event that Captain Carey, of the 17th\r\nB. N. I., rode into Minpooree, the only remaining one of four English\r\nofficers who had been endeavouring to render useful service in the\r\nneighbourhood. They were at the head of a small body of native cavalry.\r\nThe sowars suddenly turned upon them in an open road. Major Hayes,\r\nmilitary secretary to Sir Henry Lawrence—a great oriental scholar and\r\nmost able officer, whom General Wheeler had just before solicited Sir\r\nHenry to send him, to open the communications with Agra—was instantly\r\ncut down with a sword, his head frightfully hacked, his right hand cut\r\noff, his left mutilated. Another, Lieutenant Fayers, had his head nearly\r\nsevered from his body by a dastardly villain, while the unfortunate\r\nyoung officer was drinking at a well. An old Sikh rushed forward to\r\nprevent the atrocity, but was repelled with the words: ‘What! are you\r\nwith these Kaffirs? Look to yourself!’ Lieutenant Barber, adjutant of\r\nthe 2d irregular cavalry, made an attempt to escape, but was shot down,\r\ncut to pieces, robbed, and left dead. The fourth, Captain Carey, trusted\r\nto the heels of his good horse; on he galloped over fields and roads,\r\nfollowed by a troop of blood-thirsty miscreants, yelling and firing as\r\nthey rode. Happily, just as his steed was about to sink through\r\nexhaustion, his pursuers gave up the chase. He reached Minpooree in\r\nsafety; and on the 1st of June, followed the mangled remains of his\r\nthree poor companions to the grave.\r\n\r\nAnother exploit connected with Minpooree shall be given in the words of\r\nLieutenant de Kantzow, affording as it does one among many examples of\r\nthe extraordinary risks to which the officers were exposed at that\r\nturbulent period, and of the rattling, quick-witted, fearless,\r\npersevering way in which such dangers were met, and afterwards described\r\nin the letters written to friends at home—letters that admit the reader\r\nbehind the scenes in a way not possible in official dispatches: ‘I was\r\nreturning from reconnoitring, when information was brought me that five\r\ntroopers of the 7th light cavalry (native) were coming along the road.\r\nAn immediate pursuit was of course ordered by me, and my thirty-nine\r\ntroopers tore away at full speed after them. I was just coming up to\r\nthem, and had already let drive among the murdering villains; when, lo!\r\nI came upon two hundred of their comrades, all armed with swords, and\r\nsome with carbines. A smart fire was kept up at a distance of not more\r\nthan twenty-five yards. What could thirty-nine do against two hundred\r\nregular troopers, well horsed and armed—particularly when walked into by\r\nthe bullets of a hundred of the infantry! I ordered a retreat, but my\r\ncavalry could not get away from troopers mounted upon good stud-bred\r\nhorses; so we were soon overtaken, and then commenced the shindy in\r\nearnest. Twelve troopers surrounded me: the first, a Mohammedan priest,\r\nI shot through the breast just as he was cutting me down. This was my\r\nonly pistol, so I was helpless as regards weapons, save my sword; this\r\nguarded off a swingeing cut given me by number two, as also another by\r\nnumber three; but the fun could not last. I bitterly mourned not having\r\na couple of revolvers, for I could have shot every man. My sword was cut\r\ndown, and I got a slash on the head that blinded me; another on the arm\r\nthat glanced and only took a slice off; the third caught me on the side,\r\nbut also glanced and hit me sideways. I know not how I escaped: God only\r\nknows, as twelve against one were fearful odds, especially as I was\r\nmounted on a pony bare back. Escape, however, I did.’ Twenty-four out of\r\nhis thirty-nine troopers were killed, wounded, or missing.\r\n\r\nThe region lately noticed, including the towns of Allygurh, Hattrass,\r\nEtawah, Minpooree, &c., was formerly included in Rohilcund, or the land\r\nof the Rohillas; but according to the territorial or political division\r\nadopted by the Company, it is now partly in the Meerut division, and\r\npartly in that of Agra; while the present Rohilcund division is wholly\r\non the left bank of the Ganges. These technical distinctions are,\r\nhowever, a matter of very little importance in connection with the\r\nprogress of the Revolt; for the insubordinate sepoys tempted and\r\nimitated each other wholly in disregard of mere conventional boundaries.\r\nWe must now follow the stream of insurrection across the Ganges, and\r\nshew how deplorable was the anarchy, how sad the sufferings, that began\r\nthere towards the close of May.\r\n\r\nThe districts of Rohilcund in its modern or limited sense are Bareilly,\r\nBoodayoun or Budaon, Shahjehanpoor, Mooradabad, and Bijnour, each named\r\nafter a chief town; and not only were the whole of these towns more or\r\nless disturbed, but throughout the intervening country the military\r\ncantonments were set into a flame—figuratively and often literally. In\r\nsome instances the civil servants of the Company, chiefly magistrates\r\nand revenue collectors, made their escape with their wives and children,\r\nleaving the mutineers to occupy the stations and pillage the treasuries;\r\nin others the civil servants, led by one of their number possessing tact\r\nand resolution, held the marauders at bay until assistance could be\r\nprocured; while in many cases the English officers of native regiments,\r\nas well as the civilians, yielded—by flight or by death—only after a\r\ndetermined resistance.\r\n\r\nTwo of the towns above named, Bareilly and Boodayoun, will suffice at\r\npresent to illustrate the state of affairs in Rohilcund. Sunday, as we\r\nhave often had occasion to observe, was a favourite day for the native\r\noutbreaks; and it was on Sunday the 31st of May that the miseries at\r\nBareilly began. The 18th and 68th regiments N. I. were cantoned there.\r\nThe bungalow of Colonel Troup was suddenly surrounded by two companies\r\nof his own regiment, the 68th: and it was only by a hasty exit through a\r\nside-door that he escaped death. During many previous days and nights\r\nthe troops had been in a rebellious state; the English, civilians and\r\nmilitary, had slept in their clothes, with pistols ready loaded, and\r\nhorses kept ready saddled. The ladies had all been sent up for safety to\r\nNynee Tal; and thus, when the struggle arose, the officers had only\r\nthemselves to protect. This word ‘ladies,’ however, is to be interpreted\r\nin its conventional sense; for many women in a humbler grade of life,\r\ntogether with their children, remained in the town; and among these some\r\ndeplorable scenes occurred. The members of one family were brought\r\nbefore a ruthless fellow who assumed some kind of authority; and in a\r\nvery few minutes their heads were severed from their bodies. At the same\r\ntime, Mr Robertson the judge, two medical men, the professors of the\r\ncollege, and others, were subjected to a mock trial and publicly hanged.\r\nThe mutinous sepoys took aim in the most deliberate way at their\r\nofficers, while the latter were fleeing; Mr Alexander, commissioner of\r\nBareilly, though ill at the time, was forced to mount his horse and\r\ngallop off as the only means of saving his life, amid a shower of\r\nbullets and grape-shot—for the treacherous villains not only used\r\nmuskets and rifles, but fired grape from the cannon. Many of the\r\ngentlemen rode off in haste without any head-coverings, the rays of an\r\nIndian sun pouring down upon them in full force. When the English were\r\ndriven out, the Mohammedans and Hindoos began to fight fiercely against\r\neach other for possession of the treasure—one among many indications\r\nthat plunder was at least as strong a desire as revenge in impelling the\r\nnatives to deeds of violence.\r\n\r\nThe name of Nynee Tal is mentioned in the above paragraph; and it may be\r\nwell to understand on what ground that town was so often named with\r\nearnest solicitude by officers engaged in arduous struggles in various\r\nparts of the north of India. Nynee Tal is a healthy spot on the banks of\r\na beautiful lake, a few miles from Almora in Kumaon, and not far from\r\nthe Nepaulese border: indeed it belonged to the Goorkhas of Nepaul until\r\nrecent times, when it was conquered from them by the British; since\r\nwhich occurrences the late owners have been friendly neighbours within\r\ntheir own territory of Nepaul. Nynee Tal became a second Simla during\r\nthe disturbances. Women and children, if their lives were spared at the\r\nscenes of tumult, were hurried off to the places just named, and to one\r\nor two other towns among the hills—there to remain till days of peace\r\nreturned, or till means of safe conveyance to Calcutta or Bombay could\r\nbe procured. When the troubles in Rohilcund commenced; when Bareilly and\r\nBoodayoun, Mooradabad and Shahjehanpoor, fell into the hands of the\r\nrebels—all fled to Nynee Tal who could. Captain Ramsey, commanding at\r\nthat town, at once made arrangements for protecting the poor fugitives;\r\nhe formed the gentlemen of the station into a militia, who took it in\r\nturn to fulfil the duties of an armed patrol, to keep in order the\r\ndacoits and other ruffians in the neighbourhood; he laid in a store of\r\nthree months’ provisions for all the mouths in the place; and he armed\r\nthe station and the roads with companies of a Goorkha regiment. These\r\nGoorkhas, it may be well here to explain, are of Mongol origin, but\r\nsmaller and darker than the real Chinese. They belong to Nepaul, and\r\nfirst became familiar to the British by their resolute soldierly\r\nqualities during the Nepaulese war. Although Hindoos by religion, they\r\nhave little or nothing of caste prejudice, and sympathise but slightly\r\nwith the Hindoos of the plains. Being natives of a somewhat poor\r\ncountry, they have shewn a readiness in recent years to accept Company’s\r\npay as auxiliary troops; and it was a very important fact to those\r\nconcerned in quelling the revolt, that the Goorkhas manifested a\r\ndisposition rather to remain faithful to their British paymasters, than\r\nto join the standard of rapine and murder.\r\n\r\nBareilly, we have just seen, was one of the towns from which fugitive\r\nladies were sent for safety to Nynee Tal; and now the town of Boodayoun,\r\non the road from Agra to Bareilly, comes for notice under similar\r\nconditions. Considering that the course of public events often receives\r\nillustration of a remarkable kind from the experience of single\r\nindividuals, we shall treat the affairs of Boodayoun in connection with\r\nthe strange adventures of one of the Company’s civil servants—adventures\r\nnot so deeply distressing as those of the fugitives from Delhi, but\r\ncontinued during a much longer period, and bringing to light a much\r\nlarger number of facts connected with the feelings and position of the\r\nnatives in the disturbed districts. The wanderer, Mr Edwards, collector\r\nof the Boodayoun district, was more than _three months_ in reaching\r\nCawnpore from Boodayoun—a distance scarcely over a hundred miles by\r\nroad. About the middle of May, the districts on both sides of the Ganges\r\nbecoming very disturbed, Mr Edwards sent his wife and child for refuge\r\nto Nynee Tal. He was the sole European officer in charge of the\r\nBoodayoun district, and felt his anxieties deepen as rumours reached him\r\nof disturbances in other quarters. At the end of the month, news of the\r\nrevolt at Bareilly added to his difficulties; for the mutineers and a\r\nband of liberated prisoners were on their way from that place to\r\nBoodayoun. Mr Edwards expresses his opinion that the mutiny was\r\naggravated by the laws, or the course adopted by the civil courts,\r\nconcerning landed property. Landed rights and interests were sold by\r\norder of the courts for petty debts; they were bought by strangers, who\r\nhad no particular sympathy with the people; and the old landowners,\r\nregarded with something like affection by the peasantry, were thrown\r\ninto a discontented state. Evidence was soon afforded that these\r\ndispossessed landowners joined the mutineers, not from a political\r\nmotive, but to seize hold of their old estates during a time of turmoil\r\nand violence. ‘The danger now is, that they can never wish to see the\r\nsame government restored to power; fearing, as they naturally must, that\r\nthey will have again to give up possession of their estates.’ This\r\nsubject, of landed tenure in India, will call for further illustration\r\nin future pages, in relation to the condition of the people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Nynee Tal—a refuge for European fugitives.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNarrowly escaping peril himself, Mr Edwards, on the 1st of June, saw\r\nthat flight was his only chance. There were two English indigo-planters\r\nin the neighbourhood, together with another European, who determined to\r\naccompany him wherever he went, thinking their safety would be thereby\r\nincreased. This embarrassed him, for friendly natives who might shelter\r\none person, would probably hesitate to receive four; and so it proved,\r\non several occasions. He started off on horseback, accompanied by the\r\nother three, and by a faithful Sikh servant, Wuzeer Singh, who never\r\ndeserted him through all his trials. The worldly wealth of Mr Edwards at\r\nthis moment consisted of the clothes on his back, a revolver, a watch, a\r\npurse, and a New Testament. During the first few days they galloped from\r\nvillage to village, just as they found the natives favourable or\r\nhostile; often forced to flee when most in need of food and rest. They\r\ncrossed the Ganges two or three times, tracing out a strange zigzag in\r\nthe hope of avoiding dangers. The wanderers then made an attempt to\r\nreach Futteghur. They suffered much, and one life was lost, in this\r\nattempt; the rest, after many days, reached Futteghur, where Mr Probyn\r\nwas the Company’s collector. Native troops were mutinying, or consulting\r\nwhether to mutiny; Europeans were departing; and it soon became evident\r\nthat Futteghur would no longer be a place of safety either for Probyn or\r\nfor Edwards. Flight again became necessary, and under more anxious\r\ncircumstances, for a lady and four children were to be protected; but\r\nhow to flee, and whither, became anxious questions. Day after day\r\npassed, before a friendly native could safely plan an escape for them by\r\nboat; enemies and marauders were on every side; and at last the danger\r\nbecame so imminent that it was resolved to cross the Ganges, and seek an\r\nasylum in a very desolate spot, out of the way of the mutineers. Here\r\nwas presented a curious exemplification of ‘lucky’ and ‘unlucky’ days as\r\nviewed by the natives. ‘A lucky day having been found for our start,’\r\nsays Mr Edwards, ‘we were to go when the moon rose; but this moon-rise\r\nwas not till three o’clock on the morning after that fixed for the\r\nstart. This the Thakoors were not at first aware of. I was wakened about\r\neleven o’clock by one of them, who said that the fact had just come to\r\nhis knowledge, and that it was necessary that something belonging to us\r\nshould start at once, as this would equally secure the lucky influence\r\nof the day, even though we ourselves should not start till next morning.\r\nA _table-fork_ was accordingly given him, with which he went off quite\r\nsatisfied, and which was sent by a bearer towards the village we were to\r\nproceed to.’ Under the happy influence of this table-fork, the wanderers\r\nset forth by night, Mrs Probyn and her children riding on an elephant,\r\nand the men walking on roads almost impassable with mud. They reached\r\nthe stream; they crossed in a boat; they walked some distance amid\r\ntorrents of rain, Mr Edwards ‘carrying poor baby;’ and then they reached\r\nthe village, Runjpoonah, destined for their temporary home. What a home\r\nit was! ‘The place intended for the Probyns was a wretched hovel\r\noccupied by buffaloes, and filthy beyond expression, the smell stifling,\r\nand the mud and dirt over our ankles. My heart sank within me as I laid\r\ndown my little charge on a charpoy.’ By the exercise of ingenuity, an\r\nextemporaneous chamber was fitted up in the roof. During a long sojourn\r\nhere in the rainy season, Mr Edwards wrote a letter to his wife at Nynee\r\nTal, under the following odd circumstances: ‘I had but a small scrap of\r\npaper on which to write my two notes, and just the stump of a\r\nlead-pencil: we had neither pens nor ink. In the middle of my writing,\r\nthe pencil-point broke; and when I commenced repointing it, the whole\r\nfell out, there being just a speck of lead left. I was in despair; but\r\nwas fortunately able to refix the atom, and to finish two short\r\nnotes—about an inch square each: it was all the man could conceal about\r\nhim. I then steeped the notes in a little milk, and put them out to dry\r\nin the sun. At once a crow pounced on one and carried it off, and I of\r\ncourse thought it was lost for ever. Wuzeer Singh, however, saw and\r\nfollowed the creature, and recovered the note after a long chase.’\r\nSeveral weeks passed; ‘poor baby’ died; then an elder child—both sinking\r\nunder the privations they had had to endure: their anxious mother, with\r\nall her tender solicitude, being unable further to preserve them. Mr\r\nEdwards, who was one of those that thought the annexation of Oude an\r\nunwise measure, said, in relation to a rumour that Oude had been\r\nrestored to its king: ‘I would rejoice at such an equitable measure at\r\nanother time; but now it would be, if true, a sign of a falling cause\r\nand of great weakness, which is I fear our real case.’ On another\r\noccasion, he heard ‘more rumours that the governor-general and the King\r\nof Oude had arrived at Cawnpore; and that Oude is then formally to be\r\nmade over to the king.’ Whether Oudians or not, everywhere he found the\r\nMohammedans more hostile to the British than the Hindoos; and in some\r\nplaces the two bodies of religionists fought with each other. After many\r\nmore weeks of delays and disappointments, the fugitives were started off\r\ndown the Ganges to Cawnpore. In effecting this start, the ‘lucky-day’\r\nprinciple was again acted on. ‘The astrologer had fixed an hour for\r\nstarting. As it was not possible for us to go at the fortunate moment\r\nand secure the advantage, a shirt of mine and some garments of those who\r\nwere to accompany me, were forwarded to a village some way on the road,\r\nwhich is considered equivalent to ourselves starting.’ Half-a-dozen\r\ntimes on their voyage were they in danger of being shot by hostile\r\nnatives on shore; but the fidelity and tact of the natives who had\r\nbefriended them carried them through all their perils. At length they\r\nreached Cawnpore on the 1st of September, just three calendar months\r\nafter Mr Edwards took his hasty departure from Boodayoun.\r\n\r\nThis interesting train of adventures we have followed to its close, as\r\nillustrating so many points connected with the state of India at the\r\ntime; but now attention must be brought back to the month of May.\r\n\r\nWest of the Rohilcund district, and northwest of Allygurh and its\r\nneighbouring cluster of towns, lie Meerut and Delhi, the two places at\r\nwhich the atrocities were first manifested. Meerut, after the departure\r\nof the three mutinous regiments on the night of the 10th of May, and the\r\nrevolt of the Sappers and Miners a few days afterwards, remained\r\nunmolested. Major-general Hewett was too strong in European troops to be\r\nattacked, although his force took part in many operations against the\r\nrebels elsewhere. Several prisoners, proved to have been engaged in the\r\nmurderous work of the 10th, were hanged. On the other hand, many sowars\r\nof the 3d native cavalry, instead of going to Delhi, spread terror among\r\nthe villagers near Meerut. One of the last military dispatches of the\r\ncommander-in-chief was to Hewett, announcing his intention to send most\r\nof his available troops from Kurnaul by Bhagput and Paniput, to Delhi,\r\nand requesting Hewett to despatch from Meerut an auxiliary force. This\r\nforce he directed should consist of two squadrons of carabiniers, a wing\r\nof the 60th Rifles, a light field-battery, a troop of horse-artillery, a\r\ncorps of artillerymen to work the siege-train, and as many sappers as he\r\ncould depend upon. General Anson calculated that if he left Umballa on\r\nthe 1st of June, and if Hewett sent his force from Meerut on the 2d,\r\nthey might meet at Bhagput on the 5th, when a united advance might be\r\nmade upon Delhi; but, as we shall presently see, the hand of death\r\nstruck down the commander-in-chief ere this plan could be carried out;\r\nand the force from Meerut was placed at the disposal of another\r\ncommander, under circumstances that will come under notice in their\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\nDelhi, like Cawnpore, must be treated apart from other towns. The\r\nmilitary proceedings connected with its recapture were so interesting,\r\nand carried on over so long a period; it developed resources so\r\nstartlingly large among the mutineers, besieging forces so lamentably\r\nsmall on the part of the British—that the whole will conveniently form a\r\nsubject complete in itself, to be treated when collateral events have\r\nbeen brought up to the proper level. Suffice it at present to say, that\r\nthe mutineers over the whole of the north of India looked to the\r\nretention of Delhi as their great stronghold, their rock of defence;\r\nwhile the British saw with equal clearness that the recapture of that\r\ncelebrated city was an indispensable preliminary to the restoration of\r\ntheir prestige and power in India. All the mutineers from other towns\r\neither hastened to Delhi, or calculated on its support to their cause,\r\nwhatever that cause may have been; all the available British regiments,\r\non the other hand, few indeed as they were, either hastened to Delhi, or\r\nbore it in memory during their other plans and proceedings.\r\n\r\nJust at the time when the services of a military commander were most\r\nneeded in the regions of which Agra is the centre, and when it was\r\nnecessary to be in constant communication with the governor-general and\r\nauthorities, General Anson could not be heard of; he was supposed at\r\nCalcutta to be somewhere between Simla and Delhi; but dâks and\r\ntelegraphs had been interfered with, and all remained in mystery as to\r\nhis movements. Lawrence at Lucknow, Ponsonby at Benares, Wheeler at\r\nCawnpore, Colvin at Agra, Hewett at Meerut, other commanders at\r\nAllahabad, Dinapoor, and elsewhere—all said in effect: ‘We can hold our\r\nown for a time, but not unless Delhi be speedily recaptured. Where is\r\nthe commander-in-chief?’ Viscount Canning sent messages in rapid\r\nsuccession, during the second half of the month of May, entreating\r\nGeneral Anson to bring all his power to bear on Delhi as quickly as\r\npossible. Duplicate telegrams were sent by different routes, in hopes\r\nthat one at least might reach its destination safely; and every telegram\r\ntold the same story—that British India was in peril so long as Delhi was\r\nnot in British hands, safe from murderers and marauders. Major-general\r\nSir Henry Barnard, military commander of the Umballa district, received\r\ntelegraphic news on the 11th of May of the outrages at Meerut and Delhi;\r\nand immediately sent an aid-de-camp to gallop off with the information\r\nto General Anson at Simla, seventy or eighty miles distant. The\r\ncommander-in-chief at once hastened from his retirement among the hills.\r\nSimla, as was noticed in a former page, is one of the sanataria for the\r\nEnglish in India, spots where pure air and moderate temperature restore\r\nto the jaded body some of the strength, and to the equally jaded spirits\r\nsome of the elasticity, which are so readily lost in the burning plains\r\nfurther south. The poorer class among the Europeans cannot afford the\r\nindulgence, for the cost is too great; but the principal servants of the\r\nCompany often take advantage of this health-restoring and invigorating\r\nclimate—where the average temperature of the year is not above 55° F.\r\nThe question has been frequently discussed, and is not without cogency,\r\nwhether the commander-in-chief acted rightly in remaining at that remote\r\nspot during the first twenty weeks in the year, when so many suspicious\r\nsymptoms were observable among the native troops at Calcutta, Dumdum,\r\nBarrackpore, Berhampore, Lucknow, Meerut, and Umballa. He could know\r\nnothing of the occurrences at those places but what the telegraphic\r\nwires and the postal dâks told him; nevertheless, if they told him the\r\ntruth, and _all_ the truth, it seems difficult to understand, unless\r\nillness paralysed his efforts, why he, the chief of the army, remained\r\nquiescent at a spot more than a thousand miles from Calcutta.\r\n\r\nStartled by the news, the commander-in-chief quitted Simla, and hastened\r\nto Umballa, the nearest military station on the great Indian highway. It\r\nthen became sensibly felt, both by Anson and Barnard, how insufficient\r\nwere the appliances at their disposal. The magazines at Umballa were\r\nnearly empty of stores and ammunition; the reserve artillery-wagons were\r\nat Phillour, eighty miles away; the native infantry were in a very\r\ndisaffected state; the European troops were at various distances from\r\nUmballa; the commissariat officers declared it to be almost impossible\r\nto move any body of troops, in the absence of necessary supplies for a\r\ncolumn in the field; and the medical officers dwelt on the danger of\r\nmarching troops in the hot season, and on the want of conveyance for\r\nsick and wounded. In short, almost everything was wanting, necessary for\r\nthe operations of an army. The generals set to work, however; they\r\nordered the 2d European Fusiliers to hasten from Subathoo to Umballa;\r\nthe Nusseree Battalion to escort a siege-train and ammunition from\r\nPhillour to Umballa; six companies of the Sappers and Miners to proceed\r\nfrom Roorkee to Meerut; and the 4th Irregular Cavalry to hold themselves\r\nin readiness at Hansi. Anson at the same time issued the general order,\r\nalready adverted to, inviting the native regiments to remain true to\r\ntheir allegiance, explaining the real facts concerning the cartridges,\r\nand reiterating the assurances of non-intervention with the religious\r\nand caste scruples of the men. On the 17th there were more than seven\r\nregiments of troops at Umballa—namely, the Queen’s 9th Lancers, the 4th\r\nLight Cavalry Lancers, the Queen’s 75th foot, the 1st and 2d European\r\nFusiliers, the 5th and 60th native infantry, and two troops of European\r\nhorse-artillery; but the European regiments were all far short of their\r\nfull strength. Symptoms soon appeared that the 5th and 60th native\r\ninfantry were not to be relied upon for fidelity; and General Anson\r\nthereupon strengthened his force at Umballa with such European regiments\r\nas were obtainable. He was nevertheless in great perplexity how to shape\r\nhis course; for so many wires had been cut and so many dâks stopped,\r\nthat he knew little of the progress of events around Delhi and Agra.\r\nBeing new to India and Indian warfare, also, and having received his\r\nappointment to that high command rather through political connections\r\nthan in reference to any experience derived from Asiatic campaigning, he\r\nwas dependent on those around him for suggestions concerning the best\r\nmode of grappling with the difficulties that were presented. These\r\nsuggestions, in all probability, were not quite harmonious; for it has\r\nlong been known that, in circumstances of emergency, the civil and\r\nmilitary officers of the Company, viewing occurrences under different\r\naspects or from different points of view, often arrived at different\r\nestimates as to the malady to be remedied, and at different suggestions\r\nas to the remedy to be applied. At the critical time in question,\r\nhowever, all the officers, civil as well as military, assented to the\r\nconclusion that Delhi must be taken at any cost; and on the 21st of May,\r\nthe first division of a small but well-composed force set out from\r\nUmballa on the road to Delhi. General Anson left on the 25th, and\r\narrived on the 26th at Kurnaul, to be nearer the scene of active\r\noperations; but there death carried him off. He died of cholera on the\r\nnext day, the 27th of May.\r\n\r\nWith a governor-general a thousand miles away, the chief officers at and\r\nnear Kurnaul settled among themselves as best they could, according to\r\nthe rules of the service, the distribution of duties, until official\r\nappointments could be made from Calcutta. Major-general Sir Henry\r\nBarnard became temporary commander, and Major-general Reid second under\r\nhim. When the governor-general received this news, he sent for Sir\r\nPatrick Grant, a former experienced adjutant-general of the Bengal army,\r\nfrom Madras, to assume the office of commander-in-chief; but the\r\nofficers at that time westward of Delhi—Barnard, Reid, Wilson, and\r\nothers—had still the responsibility of battling with the rebels. Sir\r\nHenry Barnard, as temporary chief, took charge of the expedition to\r\nDelhi—with what results will be shewn in the proper place.\r\n\r\nThe regions lying west, northwest, and southwest of Delhi have this\r\npeculiarity, that they are of easier access from Bombay or from Kurachee\r\nthan from Calcutta. Out of this rose an important circumstance in\r\nconnection with the Revolt—namely, the practicability of the employment\r\nof the Bombay native army to confront the mutinous regiments belonging\r\nto that of Bengal. It is difficult to overrate the value of the\r\ndifference between the two armies. Had they been formed of like\r\nmaterials, organised on a like system, and officered in a like ratio,\r\nthe probability is that the mutiny would have been greatly increased in\r\nextent—the same motives, be they reasonable or unreasonable, being alike\r\napplicable to both armies. Of the degree to which the Bombay regiments\r\nshewed fidelity, while those of Bengal unfurled the banner of rebellion,\r\nthere will be frequent occasions to speak in future pages. The subject\r\nis only mentioned here to explain why the western parts of India are not\r\ntreated in the present chapter. There were, it is true, disturbances at\r\nNeemuch and Nuseerabad, and at various places in Rajpootana, the\r\nPunjaub, and Sinde; but these will better be treated in later pages, in\r\nconnection rather with Bombay than with Calcutta as head-quarters.\r\nEnough has been said to shew over how wide an area the taint of\r\ndisaffection spread during the month of May—to break out into something\r\nmuch more terrible in the next following month.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  _Indian Railways._—An interesting question presents itself, in\r\n  connection with the subject of the present chapter—Whether the\r\n  Revolt would have been _possible_ had the railways been completed?\r\n  The rebels, it is true, might have forced up or dislocated the\r\n  rails, or might have tampered with the locomotives. They might, on\r\n  the other hand, if powerfully concentrated, have used the railways\r\n  for their own purposes, and thus made them am auxiliary to\r\n  rebellion. Nevertheless, the balance of probability is in favour of\r\n  the government—that is, the government would have derived more\r\n  advantage than the insurgents from the existence of railways between\r\n  the great towns of India. The difficulties, so great as to be almost\r\n  insuperable, in transporting troops from one place to another, have\r\n  been amply illustrated in this and the preceding chapters; we have\r\n  seen how dâk and palanquin bearers, bullocks and elephants, ekahs\r\n  and wagons, Ganges steamers and native boats, were brought into\r\n  requisition, and how painfully slow was the progress made. The 121\r\n  miles of railway from Calcutta to Raneegunge were found so useful,\r\n  in enabling the English soldiers to pass swiftly over the first part\r\n  of their journey, that there can hardly be a doubt of the important\r\n  results which would have followed an extension of the system. Even\r\n  if a less favourable view be taken in relation to Bengal and the\r\n  Northwest Provinces, the advantages would unquestionably have been\r\n  on the side of the government in the Bombay and Madras presidencies,\r\n  where disaffection was shewn only in a very slight degree; a few\r\n  days would have sufficed to send troops from the south of India by\r\n  rail, _viâ_ Bombay and Jubbulpoor to Mirzapore, in the immediate\r\n  vicinity of the regions where their services were most needed.\r\n\r\n  Although the Raneegunge branch of the East Indian Railway was the\r\n  only portion open in the north of India, there was a section of the\r\n  main line between Allahabad and Cawnpore nearly finished at the time\r\n  of the outbreak. This main line will nearly follow the course of the\r\n  Ganges, from Calcutta up to Allahabad; it will then pass through the\r\n  Doab, between the Ganges and the Jumna, to Agra; it will follow the\r\n  Jumna from Agra up to Delhi; and will then strike off northwestward\r\n  to Lahore—to be continued at some future time through the Punjaub to\r\n  Peshawur. During the summer of 1857, the East India Company\r\n  prepared, at the request of parliament, an exact enumeration of the\r\n  various railways for which engineering plans had been adopted, and\r\n  for the share-capital of which a minimum rate of interest had been\r\n  guaranteed by the government. The document gives the particulars of\r\n  about 3700 miles of railway in India; estimated to cost £30,231,000;\r\n  and for which a dividend is guaranteed to the extent of £20,314,000,\r\n  at a rate varying from 4½ to 5 per cent. The government also gives\r\n  the land, estimated to be worth about a million sterling. All the\r\n  works of construction are planned on a principle of solidity, not\r\n  cheapness; for it is expected they will all be remunerative.\r\n  Arrangements are everywhere made for a double line of rails—a single\r\n  line being alone laid down until the traffic is developed. The gauge\r\n  is nine inches wider than the ‘narrow gauge’ of English railways.\r\n  The estimated average cost is under £9000 per mile, about one-fourth\r\n  of the English average.\r\n\r\n  Leaving out of view, as an element impossible to be correctly\r\n  calculated, the amount of delay arising from the Revolt, the\r\n  government named the periods at which the several sections of\r\n  railway would probably be finished. Instead of shewing the\r\n  particular portions belonging respectively to the five railway\r\n  companies—the East Indian, the Great Indian Peninsula, the Bombay\r\n  and Central India, the Sinde, and the Madras—we shall simply arrange\r\n  the railways into two groups, north and south, and throw a few of\r\n  the particulars into a tabulated form.\r\n\r\n                            NORTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\n     _Railways._     _Lengths._      _Probable Time of Opening._\r\n                       Miles.\r\n  Calcutta to               121 Opened in 1855.\r\n    Raneegunge,\r\n  Burdwan to                130 December 1859.\r\n    Rajmahal,\r\n  Rajmahal to               440 1860.\r\n    Allahabad,\r\n  Allahabad to              126 December 1857.\r\n    Cawnpore,\r\n  Cawnpore to Delhi,        260 October 1858 (excepting bridge at Agra\r\n                                  over the Jumna).\r\n  Mirzapore to              300 No date specified.\r\n    Jubbulpoor,\r\n  Jubbulpoor to             314 End of 1861.\r\n    Bhosawal,\r\n  Bhosawal to               125 December 1860.\r\n    Oomrawuttee,\r\n  Oomrawuttee to            138 March 1861.\r\n    Nagpoor,\r\n  Bhosawal to               241 October 1859.\r\n    Callian,\r\n  Callian to Bombay,         33 Opened in 1854.\r\n  Surat to                  160 1858 and 1859.\r\n    Ahmedabad,\r\n  Kurachee to               120 October 1859.\r\n    Hydrabad,\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SOUTHERN INDIA.\r\n\r\n  Bombay to Poonah,         124 February 1858.\r\n  Poonah to                 165 1860.\r\n    Sholapore,\r\n  Sholapore to              101 End of 1861.\r\n    Kistnah,\r\n  Kistnah to Madras,        310 1861 and 1862.\r\n  Madras to Arcot,           65 Opened in 1856.\r\n  Arcot to                   60 January 1858.\r\n    Variembaddy,\r\n  Madras to Beypore,        430 March 1859.\r\n\r\n  The plans for an Oude railway were drawn up, comprising three or\r\n  four lines radiating from Lucknow; but the project had not, at that\r\n  time, assumed a definite form.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _’Headman’ of a Village._—It frequently happened, in connection with\r\n  the events recorded in the present chapter, that the _headman_ of a\r\n  village either joined the mutineers against the British, or assisted\r\n  the latter in quelling the disturbances; according to the bias of\r\n  his inclination, or the view he took of his own interests. The\r\n  general nature of the village-system in India requires to be\r\n  understood before the significancy of the headman’s position can be\r\n  appreciated. Before the British entered India, private property in\r\n  land was unknown; the whole was considered to belong to the\r\n  sovereign. The country was divided, by the Mohammedan rulers, into\r\n  small holdings, cultivated each by a village community under a\r\n  headman; for which a rent was paid. For convenience of collecting\r\n  this rent or revenue, _zemindars_ were appointed, who either farmed\r\n  the revenues, or acted simply as agents for the ruling power. When\r\n  the Marquis of Cornwallis, as governor-general, made great changes\r\n  in the government of British India half a century ago, he modified,\r\n  among other matters, the zemindary; but the collection of revenue\r\n  remained.\r\n\r\n  Whether, as some think, villages were thus formed by the early\r\n  conquerors; or whether they were natural combinations of men for\r\n  mutual advantage—certain it is that the village-system in the plains\r\n  of Northern India was made dependent in a large degree on the\r\n  peculiar institution of caste. ‘To each man in a Hindoo village were\r\n  appointed particular duties which were exclusively his, and which\r\n  were in general transmitted to his descendants. The whole community\r\n  became one family, which lived together and prospered on their\r\n  public lands; whilst the private advantage of each particular member\r\n  was scarcely determinable. It became, then, the fairest as well as\r\n  the least troublesome method of collecting the revenue to assess the\r\n  whole village at a certain sum, agreed upon by the _tehsildar_\r\n  (native revenue collector) and the headman. This was exacted from\r\n  the latter, who, seated on the chabootra, in conjunction with the\r\n  chief men of the village, managed its affairs, and decided upon the\r\n  quota of each individual member. By this means, the exclusive\r\n  character of each village was further increased, until they have\r\n  become throughout nearly the whole of the Indian peninsula, little\r\n  republics; supplied, owing to the regulations of caste, with\r\n  artisans of nearly every craft, and almost independent of any\r\n  foreign relations.’[15]\r\n\r\n  Not only is the headman’s position and duties defined; but the whole\r\n  village may be said to be socially organised and parcelled out by\r\n  the singular operation of the caste principle. Each village manages\r\n  its internal affairs; taxes itself to provide funds for internal\r\n  expenses, as well as the revenue due to the state; decides disputes\r\n  in the first instance; and punishes minor offences. Officers are\r\n  selected for all these duties; and there is thus a local government\r\n  within the greater government of the paramount state. One man is the\r\n  scribe of the village; another, the constable or policeman; a third,\r\n  the schoolmaster; a fourth, the doctor; a fifth, the astrologer and\r\n  exorciser; and so of the musician, the carpenter, the smith, the\r\n  worker in gold or jewels, the tailor, the worker in leather, the\r\n  potter, the washerman—each considers that he has a prescriptive\r\n  right to the work in his branch done within the village, and to the\r\n  payment for that work; and each member of his family participates in\r\n  this prescriptive right. This village-system is so interwoven with\r\n  the habits and customs of the Hindoos, that it outlives all changes\r\n  going on around. Sir T. Metcalfe, who knew India well, said:\r\n  ‘Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to\r\n  revolution; Hindoo, Patan, Mogul, Mahratta, Sikh, English, are all\r\n  masters in turn; but the village community remains the same. In\r\n  times of trouble they arm and fortify themselves. If a hostile army\r\n  passes through the country, the village communities collect their\r\n  cattle within their walls, and let the enemy pass unprovoked. If\r\n  plunder and devastation be directed against themselves, and the\r\n  force employed be irresistible, they flee to friendly villages at a\r\n  distance; but when the storm has passed over, they return and resume\r\n  their occupations. If a country remain for a series of years the\r\n  scene of continued pillage and massacre, so that the village cannot\r\n  be inhabited, the scattered villages nevertheless return whenever\r\n  the power of peaceable possession revives. A generation may pass\r\n  away, but the succeeding generation will return. The sons will take\r\n  the places of their fathers; the same site for their village, the\r\n  same positions for the houses, the same lands will be reoccupied by\r\n  the descendants of those who were driven out when the village was\r\n  depopulated; and it is not a trifling matter that will drive them\r\n  out, for they will often maintain their post through times of\r\n  disturbance and convulsion, and acquire strength sufficient to\r\n  resist pillage and oppression with success. This union of the\r\n  village communities, each one forming a separate little state in\r\n  itself, has, I conceive, contributed more than any other cause to\r\n  the preservation of the people of India through all the revolutions\r\n  and changes which they have suffered.’[16]\r\n\r\n  It is easily comprehensible how, in village communities thus\r\n  compactly organised, the course of proceeding adopted by the headman\r\n  in any public exigency becomes of much importance; since it may be a\r\n  sort of official manifestation of the tendencies of the villagers\r\n  generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Palanquin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  The initials N.

The mystery that for so many\r\nweeks veiled the fate of the victims heightened the painful interest;\r\nfor none in England knew how the troubles in May gave rise to the\r\nmiseries in June, and these to the horrors of July, until nearly all\r\nwere dead who could faithfully have recorded the progress of events. Now\r\nthat the main incidents are known, they come upon the reader almost with\r\nthe force of a tragic drama; associating themselves in succession with\r\nfive scenes—the intrenchment, the boats, the ghat, the house of\r\nslaughter, the well—the intensity deepening as the plot advances towards\r\nits end.\r\n\r\nSo unutterably revolting were the indignities to which some of the\r\nunfortunates were subjected, at Cawnpore as at other places, that no one\r\ndared to speak or write fully of them; even men, hardy and world-worn\r\nmen, almost shrank from whispering the details to each other. Vague\r\ngeneralities of language were employed, in sheer dismay lest the use of\r\nprecise words should lift too high the veil that hid the hideous scene.\r\nSo much was this felt, so much were the facts understated, that persons\r\nof unblemished moral character almost regretted the reticence of the\r\npress. A nobleman held in very high estimation, the Earl of Shaftesbury,\r\non one occasion expressed at a public meeting a wish that the daily\r\njournals would proceed one stage further in making the mournful tale\r\nknown: on the ground that Englishmen, by learning more of the real\r\ntruth, would appreciate more fully the sufferings of our countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen, the heroism and Christian patience with which those\r\nsufferings were borne, and the necessity for (not vengeance, but)\r\nretributive justice on those who had ordered and executed the devilish\r\nbarbarities. It is not a trifling compliment to the delicacy of the\r\nEnglish press, that a Christian nobleman should thus have suggested less\r\nscruple, less reserve, in the treatment of a most trying subject. In\r\nevery narrative of these mournful events, the reader feels, and must\r\ncontinue to feel, that the _worst_ is left unsaid.\r\n\r\nThe first matters to treat are—the locality in which, and the native\r\nchieftain by whom, these wrongs were inflicted. Cawnpore, a terrible\r\nword to English readers, is the name both of a district and of its chief\r\ntown. The district, a part of the Doab or delta between the Ganges and\r\nthe Jumna, is included within the government of the Northwestern\r\nProvinces. The city of Cawnpore is on the right bank of the Ganges,\r\nabout two hundred and seventy miles below Delhi; and the river flows\r\ndown nearly a thousand miles below this point to Calcutta; the\r\nland-distance, however, from Cawnpore to Calcutta is between six and\r\nseven hundred miles. The Ganges here is sometimes more than a mile in\r\nwidth at and soon after the rainy season, and is at such time very\r\ndifficult to be crossed by bodies of troops. Cawnpore is an important\r\ncity to the British in India, both commercially and in a military sense.\r\nThe ghat or landing-place, in peaceful times, is a scene of great\r\nliveliness and bustle. When Skinner was there, ‘Every description of\r\nvessel that can be imagined was collected along the bank. The pinnace,\r\nwhich with its three masts and neat rigging might have passed for a\r\nship; budgerows, the clumsiest of all clumsy things, with their sterns\r\nseveral times higher than their bows; the bauleahs, ugly enough, but\r\nlightly skimming along like gondolas compared with the heavy craft\r\naround them; the drifting haystacks, which the country-boats appear to\r\nbe when at a distance, with their native crews straining every nerve\r\nupon their summits, and cheering themselves with a wild and not\r\nunfrequently a sweet song; panswees shooting swiftly down the stream,\r\nwith one person only on board, who sits at the head, steering with his\r\nright hand, rowing with his foot, and in the left hand holding his pipe.\r\nA ferry-boat constantly plying across the stream adds to the variety of\r\nthe scene, by its motley collection of passengers—travellers, merchants,\r\nfakeers, camels, bullocks, and horses—all crowded together. The vessels\r\nfastened to the shore are so closely packed, that they appear to be one\r\nmass, and, from their thatched roofs and low entrances, might easily\r\npass for a floating village.’ Cawnpore is (or rather was) remarkable in\r\nits military arrangements. The cantonment, six miles long by half a mile\r\nbroad, often contained, before the Revolt, a native population of fifty\r\nthousand persons, besides sixty thousand in the city itself,\r\nirrespective of military and Europeans. The native infantry of the\r\nstation encamped here in the cool part of the year, when there were\r\nregular streets and squares of canvas stretching over an immense space;\r\neach regiment was provided with its bazaar; in the rear and far beyond\r\nthe lines, were the bivouacs of every kind of camp-followers, in immense\r\nnumbers. All these, with many hundred bungalows or lodges of officers\r\nand European residents, gave great animation to the cantonment. The\r\nbungalows, though tiled or thatched, were here, as in other parts of\r\nIndia, large and commodious; each standing pleasantly in the midst of\r\nits compound or enclosure, richly planted with grapes, peaches, mangoes,\r\nshaddocks, plantains, melons, oranges, limes, guavas, and other fruits\r\nespecially acceptable in a hot climate. There was accommodation for\r\nseven thousand troops, but the number actually stationed there was\r\ngenerally much less. In accordance with the Company’s regulations, the\r\nEnglish military officers, whether of European or native regiments,\r\nalways resided within the cantonment where their services were required;\r\nwhile the civilians, although residing chiefly in the suburbs, had their\r\noffices and places of business within the city itself. There were thus,\r\nto some extent, two sets of English residents.\r\n\r\nThe next point to render clear is, the position of the man who so\r\nfatally influenced the affairs at Cawnpore in the summer months of 1857.\r\nNena Sahib was his name to an English eye and tongue, and as Nena Sahib\r\nhe will ever be execrated; but that was his titular or honorary, not his\r\nreal name, which appears to have been Dhundu Punt or Dhoondhoopunt. When\r\ncalled the Nena or Náná, the Nena Sahib, the Peishwa, the Maharajah, the\r\nNena Bahadoor, he was recognised by one of his oriental titles of\r\nhonour. Let him to us be the Nena Sahib. There was a motive, however\r\ninadequate in the estimate of persons possessing a spark of human\r\nfeeling, for the black treachery and monstrous cruelty of this man. He\r\nhad a quarrel with the East India Company: a quarrel which the Company\r\nhad nearly forgotten, but not he. The disagreement arose out of the\r\nprevalent Eastern custom of adoption, in default of legitimate male\r\nheirs. Bithoor, a town six or eight miles from Cawnpore, and within the\r\nsame district, had long been the residence of the chief of the Mahrattas\r\nor Peishwa, with whom, as with other native princes, the Company had had\r\nmany negotiations and treaties. Bithoor itself, a town of about fourteen\r\nthousand inhabitants, possesses numerous Hindoo temples, and several\r\nghats or flights of steps giving access to the Ganges, to which the\r\nBrahmins and their followers frequently resort for the purpose of ritual\r\nablution. The place is not without fortification, but it does not take\r\nrank among the strongholds of India. The last chief, Maharajah Bajee Rao\r\nPeishwa, died in 1851; and in consequence of that event, a jaghire or\r\nestate, near the town, which had been bestowed upon him during pleasure\r\nby the Company, lapsed to the government, and was subjected to the\r\ngeneral regulations in force in Cawnpore. Being sonless, he had adopted\r\na son, or indeed two sons—not merely to inherit the vast wealth which\r\nbelonged to him independently of the arrangements with the Company, but\r\nalso to perform certain filial duties which high-caste Hindoos deem it\r\nnecessary to their religion that a son should perform. This adoption was\r\nlegal so far as concerned the Peishwa’s personal property; but the\r\nCompany would not admit its validity in relation to a pension of £50,000\r\nper annum which he had been in the habit of receiving. A slight\r\nobscurity in the wording of an official document led to some doubt on\r\nthis matter. On the 1st of June 1818, Sir John Malcolm, on the part of\r\nthe Company, signed a treaty with Bajee Rao, granting a pension to the\r\nrajah _and his family_. This has since been interpreted, by the Bithoor\r\nintriguers, as a perpetual grant _to the heirs_; but there is abundant\r\nevidence that Sir John and the Company meant the pension to be for Bajee\r\nRao’s life only, to be shared by his family then living. Nine years\r\nafterwards, namely, in 1827, Bajee Rao adopted two children, Suddchoo\r\nRao and Dhundu Punt, the one four years and the other two years and a\r\nhalf old; they were the sons of two Brahmins, natives of the Deccan, who\r\nhad come to reside at Bithoor about a year before. There is no evidence\r\nthat Bajee Rao ever considered these two adopted sons, or either of\r\nthem, entitled to a continuance of the Company’s pension; although\r\nDhundu Punt may very possibly have thrown out frequent hints, to sound\r\nthe Company on this subject. It has been supposed that when the old King\r\nof Delhi was reproclaimed after the Meerut outbreak, he offered to\r\nacknowledge the Nena Sahib, Dhundu Punt, as the proper successor of the\r\nPeishwa of Bithoor, on condition of receiving his aid and allegiance.\r\nThis was probably true, but would not suffice, without the incentive of\r\nprivate animosity, to account for his subsequent actions. So little was\r\nknown of him in England when the Revolt began, that doubt prevailed\r\nwhether he was really the adopted son of Bajee Rao; some writers\r\nasserting that that honour had been conferred upon another Dhundu Punt,\r\nand that the Nena himself was the eldest son of the rajah’s subadar,\r\nRamchunder Punt.\r\n\r\nIf hatred ruled his heart during the six years from 1851 to 1857, he\r\nmust indeed have been a consummate hypocrite; for the English were\r\nalways courteously received by him at his petty court, and generally\r\ncame away impressed in his favour—impressed, however, at the same time,\r\nwith a conviction that he entertained a sort of hope that the Queen of\r\nEngland would graciously befriend him in his contest with the Calcutta\r\ngovernment, the Court of Directors, and the Board of Control, all of\r\nwhom disputed his adoptive claims. He had a curious taste for mingling\r\nthe English with the oriental in his palace at Bithoor. An English\r\ntraveller, who visited him a few years before the Revolt, and was\r\nreceived with an amount of flattery that appeared to have a good deal of\r\nshrewd calculation in it, found the rooms set apart for him decked with\r\nEnglish furniture arranged in the most incongruous manner—a chest of\r\ndrawers and a toilet-table in the sitting-room; a piano and a card-table\r\nin the bedroom; tent-tables and camp-stools in the same room with\r\nelegant drawing-room tables and chairs; a costly clock by the side of\r\ncheap japan candlesticks; good prints from Landseer’s pictures, in\r\njuxtaposition with sixpenny coloured plates of Wellington and Napoleon;\r\nsacred prints, and prints of ballet-girls and Epsom winners—all kinds\r\nwere mingled indiscriminately, as if simply to make a show. The guest\r\nwas most struck by the oriental compliments he received from the Nena,\r\nand by the odd attempt to provide English furniture where English habits\r\nand customs were so little known; yet there were not wanting dark tints\r\nto the picture. He heard rumours ‘that two women of rank were kept in a\r\nden not far from my apartments, and treated like wild beasts; and that a\r\nthird, a beautiful young creature, had recently been _bricked up in a\r\nwall_, for no other fault than attempting to escape.’ An agent of the\r\nNena, one Azimullah, resided some time in London, about the year 1855;\r\nhe came to England to advocate the Nena’s claims, and managed to\r\ningratiate himself with many persons moving in the upper circles of\r\nsociety, by his manifest abilities, his winning grace, his courtesy to\r\nall with whom he came into relation. Yet there were strange fits of\r\nmoody silence observable in him; and when the failure of his mission\r\nbecame evident, he was heard to throw out dark mysterious threats, which\r\nwere disregarded at the time, but were brought vividly to recollection\r\nafterwards, when the deeds of his master forced themselves into notice.\r\n\r\nIt will presently be seen that Nena Sahib, whatever were his thoughts at\r\nthe time, did not depart, when the Revolt commenced, from his usual\r\ndemeanour towards the English; he was courteous to them, and was always\r\ncourteously saluted by them when he rode past.\r\n\r\nHow interesting it is—nay, how affecting—to trace the mode in which the\r\nunfortunate Europeans at Cawnpore became gradually shut out from\r\ncommunication with the external world; neither knowing what was\r\noccurring east and west of them, nor able to communicate news of their\r\nown sufferings! In May, messages and letters passed to and from them; in\r\nJune, authentic intelligence was superseded by painful rumours; in July,\r\na deadly silence was followed by a horrible revelation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NENA SAHIB. From a picture painted at Bithoor in 1850, by Mr Beechy,\r\n    portrait-painter to King of Oude.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the Meerut and Delhi outbreaks occurred, the attention of the civil\r\nand military authorities was turned to the importance of securing\r\nCawnpore: because of its native troops, its store of ammunition, its\r\nlarge treasury, its considerable English population, and its position on\r\nthe Ganges and the great road. Sir Henry Lawrence, knowing that Sir Hugh\r\nWheeler’s force in European troops was weak, sent him fifty English\r\ninfantry in the third week in May, and also sent the aid (aid as it was\r\nhoped to be) of two squadrons of Oude irregular horse. But Lucknow could\r\nill spare these armed men, and hence the telegrams already briefly\r\nadverted to. First, Lawrence to Canning: ‘Cawnpore to be reinforced with\r\nall speed. When may her Majesty’s 84th be expected?’ Then Canning to\r\nLawrence: ‘It is impossible to place a wing of Europeans at Cawnpore in\r\nless time than twenty-five days.’ Then Wheeler to Canning: ‘All is quiet\r\nhere, but impossible to say how long it will continue so.’ Next a\r\ntelegram from Benares, announcing that every possible exertion would be\r\nmade to send on troops to Cawnpore as fast as they came from Calcutta.\r\nThen, on the 25th, Wheeler telegraphed to Canning: ‘Passed anxious night\r\nand day, in consequence of a report on very good authority that there\r\nwould be an outbreak during one or the other. All possible preparations\r\nto meet it, but I rejoice to say that none occurred.’ On this, Lawrence\r\nsent his earnest message recommending the establishment of ekah\r\ndâks—anything at any expense—to carry troops on to Cawnpore. Towards the\r\nclose of the month, about seventy men of the Queen’s 84th reached the\r\ncity; and Sir Hugh telegraphed ‘All quiet:’ at the same time making very\r\nevident the existence of anxiety on his mind concerning his prospects.\r\nThe governor-general telegraphed to him: ‘Your anxious position is well\r\nunderstood; and no means have been neglected to give you aid.’ On\r\nanother day Sir Hugh telegraphed: ‘All quiet still, but I feel by no\r\nmeans certain it will continue so. The civil and military are depending\r\nentirely upon me for advice and assistance.’ He announced to Lawrence\r\nthat he had been obliged to send irregular cavalry to clear the roads of\r\ninsurgent ruffians; and added, ‘Europeans are arriving but very slowly\r\nhere.’ The dilemma and doubt were painful to all; for Viscount Canning\r\nhad few troops to send up from Calcutta, and no facilities for sending\r\nthem rapidly; while, on the other hand, he did not know that death had\r\ncut off General Anson ere an advance could be made to Delhi and Cawnpore\r\nfrom the northwest. Hence such telegrams as the following from Canning\r\nto Anson: ‘Cawnpore and Lucknow are severely pressed, and the country\r\nbetween Delhi and Cawnpore is passing into the hands of the rebels. It\r\nis of the utmost importance to prevent this, and to relieve Cawnpore;\r\nbut nothing but rapid action will do this.... It is impossible to\r\noverrate the importance of shewing European troops between Delhi and\r\nCawnpore.’ Sir Hugh Wheeler’s anxieties did not relate wholly to\r\nCawnpore; he knew that a wide region depended on that city for its\r\ncontinuance in loyalty. By the 2d of June only ninety European troops\r\nhad reached him. On the next day he telegraphed that the population was\r\nmuch excited, and that unfavourable reports were coming in from the\r\ndistricts between Cawnpore and Lucknow. To make matters worse, Lawrence\r\nwas becoming weak at the last-named place, and Wheeler sent him\r\nfifty-two of his highly cherished English troops—a number that shews how\r\nprecious, from its scarcity, this military element was regarded by the\r\ntwo commanders. ‘This leaves me weak,’ said Wheeler; and well might he\r\nsay so. Then occurred the cutting of the telegraph wires on all sides of\r\nCawnpore, and the stoppage of the dâk-runners. After this, all was doubt\r\nand mystery, for it was only by stealthy means that letters and messages\r\ncould leave or enter that city. By degrees there reached the Company’s\r\nofficers at Lucknow, Allahabad, and Benares, indirect news telling of\r\ndisaster—of a rebellious rising of the native troops at Cawnpore; of the\r\nmutineers being aided and abetted by the Nena Sahib of Bithoor; of all\r\nthe Europeans taking refuge in an intrenched barrack; of the forlorn\r\nband being regularly besieged in that spot; of terrible sufferings being\r\nendured; and of the soldiers and civilians, the women and children,\r\nbeing brought to death by numerous privations. The commissioner at\r\nBenares, when these rumours of disaster reached him, telegraphed to\r\nCalcutta: ‘May God Almighty defend Cawnpore; for no help can we afford.’\r\nAnd so it was throughout June—Benares, Allahabad, Lucknow, Agra, all\r\nwere equally unable to send aid to the beleaguered garrison. Gradually\r\nthe messages became fewer, and the rumours darker; escaped fugitives and\r\nnative messengers came in stealthily to one or other of the neighbouring\r\ntowns; and men talked of a massacre at Cawnpore of English fugitives\r\nfrom Futtehgur, of another massacre of English in boats bound for\r\nCalcutta, of women and children placed in confinement, and of Nena\r\nSahib’s cruelty.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Cawnpore as viewed from without, by those who\r\ncould necessarily know but little of the truth. Let us now enter and\r\ntrace the course of events as experienced by the sufferers themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that, previous to the actual outbreak at\r\nCawnpore, the native troops—consisting of the 1st, 53d, and 56th B. N.\r\nI., and the 2d native cavalry—were much agitated by the rumours of\r\nmutiny elsewhere; and that the European inhabitants felt sensibly the\r\npaucity of English soldiers at that place. A lady, the wife of the\r\nmagistrate and collector of Cawnpore—one of those who, with all her\r\nfamily, were barbarously slaughtered in cold blood a few weeks\r\nafterwards—writing to her friends on the 15th of May, said: ‘Cawnpore is\r\nquiet, and the regiments here are stanch; but there is no saying that\r\nthey would remain long so if they came in contact with some of their\r\nmutinous brethren. We have only about a hundred European soldiers here\r\naltogether, and six guns.... Down-country, from Meerut to Dinapore,\r\nthere is but one regiment of Europeans, of which we have a hundred.’\r\nNevertheless, although the sepoys at Cawnpore were restless, an\r\nimpression prevailed that, even if they joined in the mutiny, and\r\nmarched off to Delhi, they would not inflict any injury on the military\r\ncommander, Sir Hugh Wheeler, or the other English officers, who were\r\nmuch respected by them. The general thought it right to obtain correct\r\nthough secret information from spies who mixed among the men in the\r\ncantonment; and these spies reported that the three infantry regiments,\r\nexcept a few refractory sepoys, appeared well disposed towards the\r\ngovernment; whereas the 2d native cavalry, discontented and surly, had\r\nsent their families to their homes, to be out of danger, and were in the\r\nhabit of holding nightly meetings or _punchayets_ (a kind of jury of\r\nfive persons, one of the Hindoo institutions of very ancient formation),\r\nin their lines, to concert measures of insubordination. These troopers\r\nendeavoured to bring over the foot regiments to a scheme for rising in\r\nrevolt, seizing the government treasure, marching off to Delhi, and\r\npresenting that treasure to the newly restored Mogul as a token of their\r\nallegiance. The European inhabitants were numerous; for they comprised\r\nnot only the officers and civilians with their families, but European\r\nmerchants, missionaries, engineers, pensioners, &c., and also many\r\nnonresidents, who had either come to Cawnpore from parts of the country\r\nsupposed to be less protected, or had been stopped there on their way\r\nup-country by the mutineers in the Doab. These, relying on the report\r\nconcerning the apparently favourable feeling among the native infantry,\r\nmade no immediate attempt to quit the place. Sir Hugh Wheeler, however,\r\ndid not deem it consistent with his duty to remain unprepared. Cawnpore\r\nis built on a dead level, without stronghold or place of refuge, and\r\ncould not long be held against a rebel besieging force; the cantonment\r\nwas at a considerable distance; and the general resolved on making some\r\nsort of defensive arrangement irrespective both of the city and the\r\ncantonment. He secured sufficient boats to convey the whole of the\r\nEuropeans down the Ganges if danger should appear; and he formed a plan\r\nfor protection at night in an intrenched position. This stronghold, if\r\nso it may be called, afterwards rendered memorable as ‘the\r\nIntrenchment,’ was a square plot of ground on the grand military parade,\r\nmeasuring about two hundred yards in each direction; within it were two\r\nbarrack hospitals, a few other buildings, and a well; while the boundary\r\nwas formed by a trench and parapet or breastwork of earth, intended to\r\nbe armed and defended in case of attack. The intrenchment was entirely\r\ndistinct both from the city and from the cantonment, and was further\r\nfrom the Ganges than either of them, about a quarter of a mile out of\r\nthe Allahabad and Cawnpore high road. On the side of it furthest from\r\nthe river were several barracks in course of construction. It was not\r\nintended that the European civilians should at once enter the\r\nintrenchment, but that they should regard that spot as a place of\r\nshelter in time of need. Sir Hugh brought into this place a supply of\r\ngrain, rice, salt, sugar, tea, coffee, rum, beer, &c., calculated at\r\nthirty days’ consumption for one thousand persons. He gave orders to the\r\nassistant-commissary to blow up the magazine if a mutiny should take\r\nplace; while the collector was instructed to convey all the Company’s\r\ncash, estimated at ten or twelve lacs of rupees, from the treasury in\r\nthe city to the cantonment—an instruction which, as we shall see, he was\r\nable only to obey in part. As another precaution, the executive\r\ncommissariat and pay-officers, with all their records and chests, were\r\nremoved into bungalows adjacent to the intrenchment. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that the ringleaders among the native troops sought to terrify\r\nthe rest into mutiny by representing that the digging, which had been\r\nseen actively in progress at the intrenchment, was the beginning of the\r\nconstruction of a series of mines, intended to blow them all up.\r\n\r\nOne of the most painful considerations associated with these events in\r\nMay was, that the heartless man who afterwards wrought such misery was\r\ntrustingly relied upon as a friend. The magistrate’s wife, in a series\r\nof letters before adverted to, wrote under date May 16th: ‘Should the\r\nnative troops here mutiny, we should either go into cantonments, or to a\r\nplace called Bithoor, where the Peishwa’s successor resides. He is a\r\ngreat friend of C——‘s [the magistrate’s], and is a man of enormous\r\nwealth and influence; and he has assured C—— that we should all be quite\r\nsafe there. I myself would much prefer going to the cantonment, to be\r\nwith the other ladies; but C—— thinks it would be better for me and our\r\nprecious children to be at Bithoor.’ Again, on the 18th: ‘If there\r\nshould be an outbreak here, dearest C—— has made all the necessary\r\narrangements for me and the children to go to Bithoor. He will go there\r\nhimself, and, with the aid of the rajah, to whose house we are going, he\r\nwill collect and head a force of fifteen hundred fighting-men, and bring\r\nthem into Cawnpore to take the insurgents by surprise. This is a plan of\r\ntheir own, and is quite a secret; for the object of it is to come on the\r\nmutineers unawares.’ Here, then, in the month of May, was Nena Sahib\r\nplotting with the English against the mutineers. It was on the 20th that\r\nSir Hugh, rendered uneasy by the symptoms around, sent to Lucknow for\r\nthree hundred European soldiers; but as Sir Henry Lawrence could hardly\r\nspare one-sixth of that number, arrangements were made for accommodating\r\nas many English families as possible in the cantonment, and for fitting\r\nup the intrenchment as a place of refuge. On the 21st, the magistrate,\r\nwith Wheeler’s consent, wrote to the Nena, begging him to send the aid\r\nof a few of his Mahratta troops. The native soldiers being hutted in the\r\ncantonment, and the few English soldiers barracked in the intrenchment,\r\nit was speedily determined that—while the English officers should sleep\r\nat the cantonment, to avoid shewing distrust of the native troops—their\r\nwives and families, and most of the civilians, should remain at night in\r\nthe intrenchment, under protection of English soldiers. On the first\r\nnight of this arrangement, ‘there were an immense number of ladies and\r\ngentlemen assembled in the intrenchment; and oh! what an anxious night\r\nit was! The children added much to our distress and anxiety,’ said the\r\nlady whose letters were lately quoted; ‘it was some hours before I could\r\nget them to sleep. I did not lie down the whole night. Extraordinary it\r\nwas, and most providential too, that we had a thunderstorm that night,\r\nwith a good deal of rain, which cooled the air a little; had it not been\r\nfor this, we should have suffered much more.’ An English officer, in\r\nrelation to this same night, said: ‘Nearly all the ladies in the station\r\nwere roused out of their houses, and hurried off to the barracks. The\r\nscene in the morning you can imagine. They were all huddled together in\r\na small building, just as they had left their houses. On each side were\r\nthe guns drawn up; the men had been kept standing by them all night\r\nthrough the rain, expecting an instant attack. There are few people now\r\nin the station but believe this attack had been intended, and had merely\r\nbeen delayed on finding us so well prepared.’ On the last day of the\r\nmonth—a day that seems to have ended all communication from this hapless\r\nlady to her friends in England—she wrote: ‘We are now almost in a state\r\nof siege. We sleep every night in a tent pitched by the barracks, with\r\nguns behind and before. We are intrenched, and are busy getting in a\r\nmonth’s provisions in case of scarcity. For the first four or five\r\nnights, we scarcely closed our eyes.... Last night, the sepoys of the\r\n1st regiment threatened to mutiny, and poor Mrs Ewart was in dreadful\r\ndistress when Colonel Ewart went to sleep in the lines, according to\r\norders; and he himself fully expected to be killed before morning; but,\r\nthank God, all passed off quietly. The general remains in the barracks\r\nday and night, to be at hand if anything should happen. We still pass\r\nthe day at the Ewarts’ house; but at night every one returns to the\r\nbarracks, which is a wretched place.... Poor Mrs —— has quite lost her\r\nreason from terror and excitement. Oh! it is a hard trial to bear, and\r\nalmost too much; but the sight of the children gives us strength and\r\ncourage.’\r\n\r\nColonel Ewart, mentioned in the above paragraph, and Major Hillersdon,\r\nwere the commandants of the 1st and 53d native regiments, respectively;\r\nthey lived in pleasant bungalows outside Cawnpore; but at this perilous\r\ntime they slept near their men in the cantonment, while their families\r\ntook refuge within the intrenchment. Mrs Ewart—destined, like the\r\nmagistrate’s wife, to be in a few weeks numbered among the outraged and\r\nslaughtered—wrote like her of the miseries of their position, even at\r\nthat early period of their privation. Speaking of the interior of the\r\nintrenchment, she said: ‘We have a tent, which is, of course, more\r\nprivate and comfortable for the night; and at present there is no\r\noccasion to spend days as well as nights there, though many people do\r\nso. This is fortunate, since the weather is fearfully hot. God grant\r\nthat we may not be exposed to such suffering as a confinement within\r\nthat intrenchment must entail; even should we be able to bear it, I know\r\nnot how our poor little ones could go through the trial.’ The general\r\nfeelings of the English in the place towards the close of May cannot be\r\nbetter conveyed than in the following words: ‘We are living face to face\r\nwith great and awful realities—life and property most insecure, enemies\r\nwithin our camp, treachery and distrust everywhere. We can scarcely\r\nbelieve in the change which has so suddenly overcast all the pleasant\r\nrepose and enjoyment of life. We are almost in a state of siege, with\r\ndangers all around us—some seen, some hidden.... Major Hillersdon joins\r\nus daily at our four o’clock dinner, and we stay together till half-past\r\nseven, when we go to our melancholy night-quarters, behind guns and\r\nintrenchments. My husband betakes himself to his couch in the midst of\r\nhis sepoys; and you can fancy the sort of nights we have to pass. These\r\nare real trials, but we have not experienced much actual physical\r\nsuffering yet.’ In another letter she further described the intrenchment\r\nand barracks as they were at night: ‘We returned to those melancholy\r\nnight-quarters. Oh, such a scene! Men, officers, women and children,\r\nbeds and chairs, all mingled together inside and outside the barracks;\r\nsome talking or even laughing, some very frightened, some defiant,\r\nothers despairing. Such sickening sights these for peaceful women; and\r\nthe miserable reflection that all is caused not by open foes, but by the\r\ntreachery of those we had fed and pampered, honoured and trusted, for so\r\nmany years.’ Colonel Ewart, in probably the last letter received from\r\nhim by his friends in England, wrote on the 31st: ‘The treasury,\r\ncontaining some ten or twelve lacs of rupees, is situated five miles\r\nfrom the cantonment. It has hitherto been thought inexpedient to bring\r\nthe treasure into the cantonment; but the general has now resolved on\r\nmaking the attempt to-morrow. Please God, he will succeed. He is an\r\nexcellent officer, very determined, self-possessed in the midst of\r\ndanger, fearless of responsibility—that terrible bugbear that paralyses\r\nso many men in command.’ This was the character generally given to Sir\r\nHugh Wheeler, who was much liked and trusted. The state of suspense in\r\nwhich the officers themselves were placed, not knowing whether revolt\r\nand outrage would speedily mark the conduct of regiments that had up to\r\nthat moment remained faithful, was well expressed in a letter written by\r\none of the infantry officers: ‘I only wish that I might get orders to go\r\nout with my regiment, or alone with my company, against some of the\r\nmutineers; so that we could put the men to the test, and see whether\r\nthey really mean to stick to us or not, and end this state of suspense.’\r\n\r\nNumerous scraps of local information, portions of letters, diaries,\r\nconversations, and scarcely intelligible messages, in English,\r\nHindustani, and Persian, help to make up the materials out of which\r\nalone a connected narrative of the events at Cawnpore can be prepared.\r\nThese would all have been very insufficient, had it not fortunately\r\nhappened that an officer of the Company, an educated man, lived to\r\nrecord upon paper his experience of four weeks spent in the\r\nintrenchment, and three subsequent weeks of imprisonment in the city.\r\nThis was Mr Shepherd, belonging to the commissariat department. How his\r\nlife was saved, and how those dear to him were savagely butchered, will\r\nbe seen further on; at present, it will suffice to remark that he lived\r\nto prepare, for the information of the government, a record of all he\r\nknew on this dreadful subject; and that the record thus prepared\r\ncontains more information than any other brought to light amid that\r\ndismal wreck of human hopes and human existence.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of June opened, symptoms became so unfavourable that the\r\nnon-military Christian residents thought it expedient to move from the\r\ncity, and obtain shelter in the English church and other buildings near\r\nthe intrenchment. Day after day small portions of cash, and Company’s\r\npapers of various kinds, were brought by the commissariat officers to\r\nhead-quarters. The collector, acting on Sir Hugh’s instructions, had\r\nendeavoured to bring the Company’s treasure from the city to the\r\nintrenchment; but he met too much opposition to enable him to effect\r\nthis, save in part; and the aid of three or four hundred men was\r\nobtained from Nena Sahib, to guard the treasury and its contents. What\r\nwas passing through the heart of that treacherous man at the time, none\r\nbut himself could know; but the English officers, whether forgetful or\r\nnot of his grudge against the Company, seem to have acted as though they\r\nplaced reliance on him. On the 3d, it being thought improper to keep any\r\npublic money under the sepoy guard at the office, the commissariat\r\ntreasure-chest, containing about thirty-four thousand rupees in cash,\r\ntogether with numerous papers and account-books, was brought into the\r\nintrenchment, and placed in the quarter-guard there. In short, nothing\r\nwas deemed safe by Wheeler and the other officials, unless it was under\r\ntheir own immediate care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Intrenchment at Cawnpore.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June arrived the crisis which was to tax to the utmost the\r\nfirmness and courage, the tact and discrimination, the kindness and\r\nthoughtfulness, of the general on whom so many lives now depended. He\r\nhad appealed, and appealed in vain, for reinforcements from other\r\nquarters: no one possessed troops that could readily be sent to him; and\r\nhe had therefore to meet his troubles manfully, with such resources as\r\nwere at hand. At two o’clock in the morning, after a vain attempt to\r\ndraw the native infantry from their allegiance, the 2d cavalry rose in a\r\nbody, gave a great shout, mounted their horses, set fire to the bungalow\r\nof their quarter-master-sergeant, and took possession of thirty-six\r\nelephants in the commissariat cattle-yard. The main body then marched\r\noff towards Nawabgunge; while the ringleaders remained behind to assail\r\nonce more the honesty of the infantry. The 1st regiment N. I. yielded to\r\nthe temptation, and marched out of the lines about three o’clock; but\r\nbefore doing so, the sepoys shewed a lingering affection for the English\r\nofficers of the regiment; those officers had for some time been in the\r\nhabit of sleeping in the quarter-guard of the regiment, to indicate\r\ntheir confidence in the men; and now the men begged them—nay, forced\r\nthem—to go into the intrenchment, as a means of personal safety. An\r\nalarm gun was fired, and all the non-combatants were brought from the\r\nchurch-compound into the intrenchment—a necessary precaution, for\r\nburning bungalows were seen in various directions. A few days\r\npreviously, a battery of Oude horse-artillery had been sent from Lucknow\r\nby Lawrence to aid Wheeler at Cawnpore; and this battery was, about\r\nseven o’clock on the eventful morning of the 5th, ordered with a company\r\nof English troops to pursue the two mutinous regiments. But here a\r\ndilemma at once presented itself. Could the 53d and 56th regiments be\r\nrelied upon? Sir Hugh thought not; and therefore he countermanded the\r\norder for the pursuit of the other two regiments. The wisdom of this\r\ndetermination was soon shewn; for about ten o’clock the whole of the\r\nnative officers of the 53d and 56th came to the general and announced\r\nthat their hold over the fidelity of the men was gone. While they were\r\nyet speaking, a bugle was heard, and the two regiments were seen to\r\nmarch off to join their companions at Nawabgunge; any attempt on the\r\nEnglish being checked by the pointing of a gun at them. The apparently\r\nfaithful native officers were directed to organise a few stragglers who\r\nhad not joined the mutineers; they left the intrenchment for this\r\npurpose, but did not return: whether they joined in the revolt, or went\r\nquietly to their own homes to avoid the resentment of the sepoys, was\r\nnot fully known. As soon as possible, carts were sent to the cantonment\r\nto bring away the sick from the hospital, and such muskets and other\r\nproperty as might be useful. In consequence of this, the two hospitals\r\nor barracks in the intrenchment became very much crowded, many of the\r\npeople being compelled to sleep in the open air through want of room.\r\nAll the civilians were then armed, and directed what they should do for\r\nthe common good. The Oude artillery, shewing signs of being smitten by\r\nthe prevailing mania for revolt, were disarmed and dismissed that same\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Plan of Sir H. Wheeler’s Intrenchment at Cawnpore. From an official\r\n    survey.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe scene must now be shifted, to shew Nena Sahib’s share in the work.\r\nRumours came to the intrenchment that when the rebels reached\r\nNawabgunge, he quitted Bithoor and came out to meet them; that he placed\r\nhimself at their head; that they all went together to the treasury; that\r\nhe carried off a large amount of government treasure on the government\r\nelephants; and that he gave up the rest to the sepoys as a prize.\r\nThereupon the papers were burnt, and the treasury and the collector’s\r\noffice destroyed. The sepoys guarding the magazine would not allow that\r\nbuilding to be blown up by the government officer; the mutineers brought\r\nas many country carts as they could procure, and carried off a\r\nconsiderable quantity of baggage and ammunition. All then marched off to\r\nKullianpore, being one stage on the road to Delhi, except a few troopers\r\nwho remained to finish the work of destruction among the bungalows. The\r\nOude artillery, lately disarmed and dismissed by Wheeler, now went to\r\nNena Sahib, and laid before him a plan for attacking the intrenchment,\r\nconcerning which they were able to give much information. They reported\r\nthat the cantonment contained many guns, and much powder and ammunition,\r\nwith which the intrenchment might safely be attacked. There was another\r\nfact favourable to the rebels. One end of the great Ganges Canal enters\r\nthe river near Cawnpore; and it had been contemplated by the government\r\nto send a large store of shot and shell by that canal up to Roorkee,\r\nthrough Allygurh and Meerut; but as the Doab and Rohilcund were in too\r\ndisturbed a state to permit this, thirty-five boats laden with shot and\r\nshell were this day lying in the canal near the cantonment. This large\r\nstore of ammunition the rebel artillerymen suggested should be at once\r\nseized; and the advice was acted on. A native inhabitant, who afterwards\r\ngave information to the English, said that when the Nena openly took\r\npart with the rebels, he released four hundred prisoners in the town,\r\nwhose fetters he ordered to be knocked off; ‘and having opened the door\r\nof the armoury, he gave the order that whatever prisoner was willing to\r\nfollow him should arm himself with gun, pistol, or sword, as he liked\r\nbest’—a story highly probable, though not within the power of Mr\r\nShepherd to confirm. Before the Nena finally committed himself to a\r\ncourse of rebellion and war, the 1st native infantry made their head\r\nsubadar a general; and the general then promoted all the havildars and\r\nnaiks to be subadars and jemadars.\r\n\r\nTwo officers of the 56th regiment were fortunate enough to be away from\r\nCawnpore and the cantonment altogether, on the day of the mutiny. They\r\nhad been sent with two hundred men to Ooral, a village or town at some\r\ndistance, on the 2d of June. When that regiment mutinied at the\r\ncantonment, and when the news of the mutiny reached Ooral, the two\r\nhundred did not long delay in following their example. The officers,\r\nseeing their danger, at once galloped off, taking nothing with them but\r\nthe clothes on their backs, and their swords and revolvers. Their tale\r\nwas as full of adventure as many that have already occupied these pages.\r\nThey found their way to Calpee, to Humeerpoor, to various places; they\r\nmet with two brother-officers escaping from mutineers at Humeerpoor; the\r\nfour rowed boats, swam rivers, entered villages where they were\r\nplundered of their weapons and clothes, roamed through jungles, fed on\r\nchupatties and water when they could obtain such fare, picked up bits of\r\nnative clothing, encountered friendly Hindoos at one time and marauding\r\nenemies at another. Of the two officers from Cawnpore, one died mad in\r\nthe jungle, from heat, thirst, and suffering; but the other, Ensign\r\nBrowne, joined the body of English troops at Futtehpoor, after\r\nthirty-seven days of wandering. All the other English officers of the\r\nfour native regiments appear to have been at or near Cawnpore at the\r\ntime of the outbreak; and all were called upon to bear their bitter\r\nshare in the woes that followed—woes rendered more distressing by\r\nfalling equally on innocent women and children as on themselves—nay,\r\nmuch more heavily.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose upon an anxious scene on the 6th of June. Sir Hugh Wheeler\r\nand nearly all the Europeans—men, women, and children—military,\r\ncivilians, and servants—were crowded within the intrenchment; while the\r\nrebel troops, four regiments and an artillery battery, had not only\r\nabandoned their allegiance, but were about to besiege those who were\r\nlately their masters. The rebels brought into requisition all the\r\ngovernment work-people and the bullocks, in the town and cantonment, to\r\ndrag guns into position near the intrenchment, and to convey thither a\r\nstore of powder and ammunition. They brought six guns (two of them\r\n18-pounders) to bear in a line, and opened fire about ten o’clock in the\r\nforenoon. Instantly a bugle sounded within the intrenchment; and every\r\nman, from the highest officers down to the clerks and the drummers, flew\r\nto arms, and took up the position assigned to him. There was only a\r\nbreast-high earthen parapet, bounded by a small trench, between the\r\nbesiegers and the besieged: hence there was nothing but indomitable\r\ncourage and unceasing watchfulness that could enable the English to hold\r\ntheir own against the treacherous native troops. Here, then, were nine\r\nhundred persons[17] hemmed into a small space, forming their citadel,\r\nwhile the surrounding country was wholly in the hands of the rebels. Out\r\nof the nine hundred, barely one-third were fighting-men; while\r\nconsiderably more than one-third were women and children, to be fed and\r\nprotected at all hazards. The few guns within the intrenchment answered\r\nthose from without; but all the men not employed with those guns\r\ncrouched down behind the breastwork, under the hot wind and scorching\r\nsun of a June day, ready to defend the spot with musketry if a nearer\r\nattack were made. The rebels did not attempt this; they adopted the\r\nsafer course of bringing up their guns nearer to the beleaguered place.\r\nSir Hugh Wheeler had eight pieces of ordnance—two brass guns of the Oude\r\nbattery, two long 9-pounders, and four smaller; he had also a good store\r\nof ammunition, buried underground, and had thus a defensive power of\r\nsome importance. On the other hand, his anxieties were great; for one of\r\nthe two buildings (they had been used as hospitals for European troops)\r\nwas thatched, liable to be fired by a chance shot; the commissariat\r\nofficers were unable to bring in more supplies; the shelter was\r\ndirefully insufficient for nine hundred persons in a fierce Indian\r\nclimate; and the women and children could do little or nothing to assist\r\nin the defence of all.\r\n\r\nThe native informant, above adverted to, states that when Nena Sahib\r\nfound the mutineers about to depart to Delhi, ‘he represented to the\r\nnative officers that it would not be correct to proceed towards Delhi\r\nuntil they had entirely destroyed the officers and European soldiers,\r\nand women and children of the Christian religion; and that they should,\r\nif possible, by deceiving the officers, accomplish this grand object, or\r\nthey would be good for nothing.’ Such words were certainly consistent\r\nwith the machinations of a villain who sought a terrible revenge for\r\nsome injury, real or pretended; but they do not the less illustrate the\r\nremarkable subtlety and secretiveness of the Hindoo character, so long\r\nconcealing a deadly hatred under a friendly exterior. This same native,\r\nwho was in Cawnpore at the time, further said: ‘In the city it was as if\r\nthe day of judgment had come, when the sepoys of the infantry and the\r\ntroopers of the cavalry, the jingling of whose sword-scabbards and the\r\ntread of whose horses’ feet resounded on all sides, proceeded with guns\r\nof various sizes, and ammunition, from the magazine through the suburbs\r\nof Cawnpore towards the intrenchment.’ In relation to the conduct of\r\nnative servants of the Company on that day, Mr Shepherd said: ‘None of\r\nthe native writers, Bengalees and others in government offices or\r\nmerchants’ employ, went into the intrenchment; they remained in the\r\ncity, where they appear to have received much annoyance from the\r\nmutineers; and some had to hide themselves to save their lives. The\r\n(native) commissariat contractors’ [those who supplied provisions and\r\nstores for the troops, ordered and paid for by the head commissary] ‘all\r\ndiscontinued their supplies from the 6th; or rather, were unable to\r\nbring them in, from the way the mutineers surrounded the intrenchment on\r\nall sides, permitting no ingress or egress at any time except under\r\ncover of night.’ Those natives must, in truth, have been placed in a\r\nperplexing position, between employers whom they wished to serve but\r\ncould not, and rebels who sought to tamper with their honesty.\r\n\r\nAnother day broke, revealing a further strengthening of the rebels’\r\nattack. They increased their number of guns, four of which were\r\n24-pounders; and with the shot from these guns not only were many\r\nvaluable men struck down, but the walls and verandahs of the hospitals\r\npierced, spreading terror among the helpless inmates. There was but one\r\nwell within the intrenchment; and so hot was the fire from without,\r\nthat, to use the words of Mr Shepherd, ‘it was as much as giving a man’s\r\nlife-blood to go and draw a bucket of water; and while there was any\r\nwater remaining in the large jars, usually kept in the verandah for the\r\nsoldiers’ use, nobody ventured to the well; but after the second day,\r\nthe demand became so great that a bheestee bag of water was with\r\ndifficulty got for five rupees, and a bucket for a rupee. Most of the\r\nservants deserted, and it therefore became a matter of necessity for\r\nevery person to fetch his own water, which was usually done during the\r\nnight, when the enemy could not well direct their shots.’ What was the\r\ndegree of thirst borne under these circumstances, none but the forlorn\r\ngarrison could ever know. As there was no place under which to shelter\r\nlive cattle, some of the animals were let loose, and others slaughtered;\r\nentailing a necessary exhaustion of meat-rations after three or four\r\ndays. The commissariat servants, however, now and then managed to get\r\nhold of a stray bullock or cow near the intrenchment at night, which\r\nserved for a change. Not only was it difficult to obtain suitable food\r\nto eat, but the native servants took every opportunity to escape, and\r\nthe cooking was in consequence conducted under very sorry conditions.\r\n\r\nThe tale of accumulated suffering need not, and indeed cannot, be\r\nfollowed day by day: several days must be grouped together, and the\r\ngeneral character of the incidents noted—so far as authentic recitals\r\nfurnish the materials. Meat, as has just been intimated, soon became\r\nscarce; hogsheads of rum and malt liquor were frequently burst by\r\ncannon-balls, but the supply still remained considerable; chupatties and\r\nrice were the chief articles of food for all. The English found their\r\ntroubles increase in every way: the rebels at first fired only cannon on\r\nthem; but by degrees, after burning the English church and all other\r\nbuildings around and near the intrenchment, the sepoys masked themselves\r\nbehind the ruined walls, and kept up an almost incessant fire of\r\nmusketry, shooting down many who might have escaped the cannon-balls.\r\nThere were seven unfinished barracks outside the intrenchment, three of\r\nthem at about a furlong distance. These were scenes of many an exciting\r\nencounter. Captain Moore of the 32d foot, a gallant and intrepid\r\nofficer, often encountered the rebels near those places. He would send\r\nsome of his men, with field-telescopes, to watch the position of the\r\nenemy’s guns, from the roof of one of the barracks, as a guidance for\r\nthe besieged; and as soon as these men were attacked, a handful of\r\ngallant companions would rush out of the intrenchment, and drive off the\r\nassailants with a fire of musketry. The enemy having no cannon on this\r\nside, a sort of drawn battle ensued: the besiegers holding three or four\r\nof the barracks, and the besieged maintaining a hold of the three\r\nnearest to the intrenchment After a while, the enemy brought one gun\r\nround to this quarter; but twenty English made a sortie at midnight on\r\nthe 11th, spiked the gun, and returned safely. Whenever fighting on\r\nanything like terms of equality took place, the European troops proved\r\nthemselves a match for many times their number of natives; but any\r\ndaring achievements for effectual liberation were rendered nugatory by\r\nthe presence of so many helpless women and children, whose safety was\r\nthe first thought in the minds of the men, whether civilians or\r\nmilitary. Numbers of the poor creatures died within the first week, from\r\nillness, heat, fright, want of room, want of proper food and care. In\r\nthe obituary of many an English newspaper, when news of the terrible\r\ncalamity had crossed the ocean, might be read that such a one, probably\r\nan officer’s wife, had ‘died in the intrenchment at Cawnpore;’ what that\r\nintrenchment meant, few readers knew, and fewer knew what sufferings had\r\npreceded the death. The dead bodies were thrown into a well outside the\r\nintrenchment, lest they should engender disease by any mode of burial\r\nwithin the crowded and stifling enclosure; and even this sad office\r\ncould only be rendered under a shower of shot and shell. ‘The distress\r\nwas so great,’ says Mr Shepherd, ‘that none could offer a word of\r\nconsolation to his friend, or attempt to administer to the wants of each\r\nother. I have seen the dead bodies of officers, and tenderly brought-up\r\nyoung ladies of rank (colonels’ and captains’ daughters), put outside\r\nthe verandah amongst the rest, to await the time when the fatigue-party\r\nusually went round to carry the dead to the well; for there was scarcely\r\nroom to shelter the living.’\r\n\r\nDuring all these days, Cawnpore itself, and the country between it and\r\nthe intrenchment, became prey to a marauding host of sepoys, liberated\r\nprisoners, and ruffians of every kind. The native before adverted to,\r\none Nujeer Jewarree, referring to this period, said: ‘In whatever shop\r\nthe sepoys entered to ask for sugar or rice, they plundered everything\r\nbelonging to the citizen that they could find; so much so, that plunder\r\nand oppression were the order of the day. Every violent man did what\r\ncame into his mind; and the troopers got possession of a note, the value\r\nof which amounted to twenty-five thousand rupees, belonging to\r\nEman-u-Dowlah and Bakir Ali. One troop, or thereabouts, left the\r\ncantonment and proceeded to the buildings in which the civil and revenue\r\nand judicial courts were held, and commenced firing them. In the city\r\nand gardens there was so much villainy committed that travelling became\r\ndangerous, and to kill a man was quite easy. They (the marauders)\r\ncommitted deeds of oppression and plundered each other; some forcibly\r\ncut the grain out of the fields, and others were occupied in picking up\r\nplundered property. He then spoke of the houses and offices of certain\r\nEnglish merchants and traders—Greenway, Crump, Mackintosh, Reid,\r\nMarshall, Kirk, &c.—and of the ‘lacs’ of treasure that were plundered\r\nfrom each; too vaguely estimated to be relied on in detail, but\r\nevidently denoting a scene of unscrupulous pillage. Another native,\r\nNerput, presently to be noticed more particularly, said: ‘Zemindars of\r\nthe neighbourhood are fighting among themselves in payment of old\r\nquarrels; sepoys, making for their homes with plundered treasure, have\r\nbeen deprived of their plunder, and, if any opposition is made,\r\nimmediately murdered. Such few Europeans as had remained beyond the\r\nintrenchment, were caught and put to death.’\r\n\r\nThe native authority just referred to states (although the statement is\r\nnot confirmed by Mr Shepherd), that on the 9th of June Sir Hugh Wheeler\r\nsent a message to Nena Sahib, demanding why he had thus turned against\r\nthe English, who had hitherto been treated by him in a friendly spirit;\r\nand why he was causing the death of innocent women and children—to which\r\nthe Nena gave no other reply than from the cannon’s mouth.\r\n\r\nOne day was so much like another, after the actual commencement of the\r\nsiege, that the various narrators make little attempt to record the\r\nparticular events of each. Every day brought its miseries, until the cup\r\nnearly overflowed. The food was lessening; the water was difficult to\r\nobtain; strength was sinking; lives were being rapidly lost; the\r\nmiscreant rebels were accumulating in greater and greater number outside\r\nthe intrenchment; the two buildings were becoming every day more and\r\nmore riddled with shot; the wounded had their wretchedness increased by\r\nthe absence of almost everything needful to the comfort of the sick; the\r\nhearts of the men were wrung with anguish at seeing the sufferings borne\r\nby the women; and the women found their resolution and patience terribly\r\nshaken when they saw their innocent little ones dying from disease and\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nA scene was presented on the 13th that filled every one with horror. The\r\nofficers and their families had hitherto lived chiefly in tents, within\r\nthe intrenchment; but the rebels now began to fire _red-hot_ shot, which\r\nnot only necessitated the removal of the tents, but ignited the\r\nthatch-roof of one of the two hospitals. This building contained the\r\nwives and children of the common soldiers, and the sick and wounded. The\r\nflames spread so rapidly, and the dire confusion among the wretched\r\ncreatures was such, that forty of the helpless invalids were burned to\r\ndeath before aid could reach them. The rebels appeared to have\r\ncalculated on all the men within the intrenchment rushing to save the\r\nvictims from the flames, leaving the besiegers to enter with musket and\r\nsword; and so threatening was the attack, so close the approach of the\r\nenemy, that the Europeans were forced to remain watchful at their frail\r\nearthen defence-work, despite their wish to rescue the shrieking\r\nsufferers in the hospital. Nearly all the medicines and the surgical\r\ninstruments were at the same time destroyed by the fire, affording a\r\nhopeless prospect to those who might afterwards fall ill or be wounded.\r\nThe rebels by this time amounted to four thousand in number, and their\r\nattacks increased in frequency and closeness; but the besieged had not\r\nyielded an inch; every man within the intrenchment, a few only excepted,\r\nwas intrusted with five or six muskets, all of which were kept ready\r\nloaded, to pour a fire into any insurgents who advanced within\r\nmusket-shot. Bayonets and swords were also ready at hand, for those who\r\ncould use them. The condition of every one was rendered more deplorable\r\nthan before by this day’s calamity; the fire had wrought such mischief\r\nthat many of the men, who had until then occasionally sheltered\r\nthemselves under a roof for a few hours at a time, were now forced to\r\nremain permanently in the open air, exposed to a fierce Indian sun at a\r\ndate only one week before the summer solstice. That many were struck\r\ndown by _coup de soleil_ at such a time may well be conceived. The poor\r\nladies, too, and the wives of the soldiers, were rendered more desolate\r\nand comfortless than ever, by the destruction of much of their clothing\r\nduring the fire, as well as of many little domestic comforts which they\r\nhad contrived to bring with them in their hurried flight from their\r\nhomes in the city or the cantonment.\r\n\r\nWhat transpired outside the intrenchment, none of the captives knew; and\r\neven at later times it was difficult to ascertain the real truth. The\r\nnative chronicler already referred to speaks of many deeds of cruelty,\r\nbut without affording means of verification. On one day, he says, a\r\nfamily was seen approaching from the west in a carriage; the husband was\r\nat once killed; the others, ‘one lady and one grown-up young lady and\r\nthree children,’ were brought before the Nena, who ordered them to be\r\ninstantly put to death. ‘The lady begged the Nena to spare her life; but\r\nthis disgraceful man would not in any way hearken to her, and took them\r\nall into the plain. At that time the sun was very hot, and the lady\r\nsaid: “The sun is very hot, take me into the shade;” but no one\r\nlistened. On four sides the children were catching hold of their\r\nmother’s gown and saying: “Mamma, come to the bungalow and give me some\r\nbread and water.” At length, having been tied hand to hand, and made to\r\nstand up on the plain, they were shot down by pistol-bullets.’ This\r\nstory, touching amid all its quaintness of recital, was probably quite\r\ntrue in its main features. Another lady, whom he calls the wife of Mukan\r\nSahib, merchant, and who had been hiding for four or five days in the\r\ngarden of her bungalow, ‘came out one evening, and was discovered. She\r\nhad through fear changed her appearance by putting on an Hindustani\r\nbodice, and folding a towel around her head. She was taken before the\r\nNena, who ordered her to be killed. The writer of this journal having\r\ngone in person, saw the head of that lady cut off, and presented as a\r\nnazir (gift of royalty).’ There can be no question that the vicinity of\r\nCawnpore was at that time in a frightful state. Not only were mutinous\r\nsepoys and sowars engaged in hostilities against the ‘Feringhees,’ whom\r\nthey had so lately served, and whose ‘salt’ they had eaten; but many of\r\nthe ambitious petty rajahs and chieftains took advantage of the anarchy\r\nto become leaders on their own special account; plunderers and released\r\nprisoners were displaying all their ferocious recklessness; while timid,\r\nsneaking villagers, too cowardly to be openly aggressive, were in many\r\ninstances quite willing to look complacently at deeds of savage\r\nbrutality, if those deeds might leave a little _loot_, or plunder, as\r\ntheir share. Consequently, when any English refugees from other towns\r\npassed that way, their chance of safety was small indeed.\r\n\r\nBefore tracing the course of events in the intrenchment during the third\r\nweek in June, we must advert to another calamity. The griefs and\r\nsufferings endured by the English soldiers and residents at Cawnpore did\r\nnot fill up the measure of Nena Sahib’s iniquity. Another stain rests on\r\nhis name in connection with the fate of an unfortunate body of fugitives\r\nfrom Futteghur. It is an episode in the great Cawnpore tragedy; and must\r\nbe narrated in this place, in connection with the events of the month.\r\n\r\nFutteghur, as will be seen by reference to a map, is situated higher up\r\nthe Ganges than Cawnpore, near Furruckabad. Practically, it is not so\r\nmuch a distinct town, as the military station or cantonment for the\r\nplace last named. Furruckabad itself is a city of sixty thousand\r\ninhabitants; handsome, cleaner, and more healthy than most Indian\r\ncities, carrying on a considerable trading and banking business, and\r\nstanding in the centre of a fertile and cultivated region. It has no\r\nother fortifications than a sort of mud-fort connected with the native\r\nnawab’s residence. When this nawab became, like many others, a\r\nstipendiary of the modern rulers of India, the British built a military\r\ncantonment at Futteghur, about three miles distant, on the right bank of\r\nthe river. Towards the close of May, Futteghur contained the 10th\r\nregiment Bengal native infantry, together with a few other native\r\ntroops. Among the chief English officers stationed there, were General\r\nGoldie, Colonels Smith and Tucker; Majors Robertson, Phillot, and Munro;\r\nCaptains Phillimore and Vibert; Lieutenants Simpson, Swettenham, and\r\nFitzgerald; and Ensigns Henderson and Eckford. The troops displayed much\r\ninsubordination as the month closed; and on the 3d of June the symptoms\r\nwere so threatening, that it was deemed prudent to arrange for sending\r\noff the women and children for safety to Cawnpore—in ignorance that the\r\nEuropeans in that city were in a still more perilous state. Boats had\r\nalready been procured, and held in readiness for any such exigency. On\r\nthe next day the 10th infantry exhibited such ominous signs of mutiny,\r\nthat a large party of the English at once took to their boats. After a\r\nshort voyage, finding the natives on the banks of the Ganges likely to\r\nbe troublesome, the fugitives resolved on separating themselves into two\r\nparties; one, headed by Mr Probyn, the Company’s collector, and\r\nconsisting of about forty persons, sought refuge with a friendly\r\nzemindar named Herden Buksh, living about twelve miles from Futteghur,\r\non the Oude side of the river; while the other party proceeded on the\r\nvoyage down the Ganges to Cawnpore. This last-named party amounted to\r\nmore than a hundred and twenty persons, nearly all non-combatants;\r\nmissionaries, merchants, indigo planters, estate stewards, agents,\r\ncollectors, clerks, shopkeepers, schoolmasters, post and dâk agents—such\r\nwere the male members of this hapless band of fugitives; most of them\r\nhad wives; and the children far exceeded the adults in number. It is\r\npitiable, knowing as we now know the fate that was in store for them, to\r\nread such entries as the following, in a list of the occupants of the\r\nboats—‘Mr and Mrs Elliott and five children;’ ‘Mr and Mrs Macklin and\r\neight children;’ ‘Mr and Mrs Palmer and nine children.’\r\n\r\nSo few persons survived from Futteghur, that it is not certain at what\r\nplaces and on what days they separated into parties; nor how many lives\r\nwere lost on the way; but there is evidence that while some pursued\r\ntheir way down the Ganges without much interruption until they reached\r\nBithoor, others went back to Futteghur. This retrograde movement was due\r\nto two causes; for while, on the one hand, the officers trusted to a\r\nreport that the sepoys had returned to a sense of their duty; Herden\r\nBuksh, on the other, was threatened by the Oude mutineers if he\r\nharboured any of the English. We will follow the fortunes of this second\r\nparty. From about the 12th to the 18th of June there was a lull in the\r\nstation; but on the last-named day the 10th infantry broke out in\r\nearnest, and being joined by the mutinous 41st from the other side of\r\nthe Ganges, seized the treasure and threatened the officers. There were\r\nabout a hundred Europeans now in the place; and as the river was at the\r\ntime too low to render a boat-voyage to Cawnpore safe, it was resolved\r\nto defend a post or fort at Futteghur, and there remain till succour\r\narrived. Out of the hundred there were scarcely more than thirty\r\nfighting-men, so numerous were the women and children; nevertheless,\r\nColonel Smith, of the 10th, organised the whole, and prepared for the\r\nworst. He had a fair store both of ammunition and of food within the\r\nfort. Until the 4th of July they maintained a manly struggle against the\r\nmutineers, holding their fort until they could hold it no longer.\r\nColonel Tucker and one of the civil officers were shot in the head while\r\nacting as artillerymen; General Goldie was slightly wounded, as was\r\nlikewise one of his daughters; and many other casualties occurred. The\r\nbesieged had great difficulty in making a covered-way to protect their\r\nservants, to enable them to pass to and fro with the meals for the\r\nladies and children, who were collected in a room or godown overlooked\r\nby a two-storied house held by the insurgents. Then commenced a voyage\r\nfull of miseries, in boats that contained all the Europeans still\r\nremaining at that spot. First the rebels fired on the boats as they\r\nrowed along; then one of the boats ran aground; then a boatful of rebels\r\napproached, and the ladies in the stranded boat jumped overboard to\r\navoid capture. Death by bullets, death by drowning, took place every\r\nhour; and the fugitives were thrown into such dire confusion that none\r\ncould help the rest. Some crept on shore, and wandered about the fields\r\nto escape detection; others found shelter under friendly roofs; one\r\nboat-load succeeded in prosecuting their voyage down to Cawnpore, or\r\nrather Bithoor.\r\n\r\nThere were thus two sets of Futteghur fugitives; one that reached the\r\nclutches of the Nena towards the middle of June; the other, much\r\nsmaller, that was spared that fate until the middle of July. So complete\r\nwas the destruction of both, however; so sweeping the death-stroke\r\nhurled against them by Nena Sahib, that the details of their fate have\r\nbeen but imperfectly recorded. Towards the close of June, Mr Court and\r\nColonel Neill, at Allahabad, received information touching the events at\r\nCawnpore from a native named Nerput, an opium _gomashta_ or agent at the\r\nlast-named city; he gave them or sent them a narrative written in\r\nPersian, portions of which were afterwards translated and published\r\namong the official papers. Nerput was one of the few who wrote\r\nconcerning the arrival of the first party of Futteghur fugitives at\r\nCawnpore. Under the date of June the 12th he said: ‘Report that\r\nEuropeans were coming in boats to relieve Cawnpore; and two companies\r\nsent westward to make inquiries. They found that a hundred and\r\ntwenty-six men, women, and children, were in boats, sick.’ Another\r\nnarrative of the Futteghur calamity simply states, that when the unhappy\r\nfugitives arrived at the part of the Ganges opposite Bithoor, Nena Sahib\r\n‘stopped their boats, brought the fugitives on shore, and shot every\r\none. He then tied their bodies together, and threw them into the river.’\r\nA native resident at Cawnpore, who was examined a few weeks afterwards\r\nby Colonel Neill concerning his knowledge of the atrocities committed by\r\nthe rajah, and of the sufferings borne by the English, gave an account\r\nof the Futteghur catastrophe corresponding nearly with those derived\r\nfrom other quarters. He states that on the 12th of June, just as the\r\ncustomary daily cannonading of the intrenchment was about to recommence,\r\na report came in that Europeans were approaching from the west.\r\nImmediately a troop of cavalry and two companies of infantry were sent\r\nto reconnoitre (probably to the vicinity of Bithoor). There were found\r\nthree boats, containing about a hundred and thirty men, women, and\r\nchildren. ‘The troopers seized them all and took them to the Nena, who\r\nordered that they should all be killed; and sundry Rampoorie troopers of\r\nthe Mussulmans of the 2d Cavalry, whom the Nena kept with him for the\r\nexpress purpose, killed them all. Among them was a young lady, the\r\ndaughter of some general. She addressed herself much to the Nena, and\r\nsaid: “No king ever committed such oppression as you have, and in no\r\nreligion is there any order to kill women and children. I do not know\r\nwhat has happened to you. Be well assured that by this slaughter the\r\nEnglish will not become less; whoever may remain will have an eye upon\r\nyou.” But the Nena paid no attention, and shewed her no mercy; he\r\nordered that she should be killed, and that they should fill her hands\r\nwith powder and kill her by the explosion.’\r\n\r\nThe fate of the second party of fugitives from Futteghur will be noticed\r\npresently. We must return now to the unfortunate occupants of the\r\nintrenchment at Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nWhen three weeks of the month of June had transpired, the rebels, joined\r\nby a number of ruffians who had crossed over the Ganges from Oude, made\r\na more determined effort than ever to capture the intrenchment; they had\r\nmade the subadar-major of the 1st N. I. a sort of general over them; and\r\nhe swore to vanquish the weakened garrison, or die in the attempt. They\r\nbrought large bales of cotton, which they rolled along the ground, and\r\napproached in a crouching position under cover of these bales, firing\r\ntheir muskets at intervals. About a hundred sepoys thus advanced within\r\na hundred and fifty yards of the intrenchment, backed up by a strong\r\nbody, who seemed bent on storming the position. In this, as in every\r\nformer attempt, they failed; their leader was struck down, nearly two\r\nhundred were killed or wounded by a fire of grape-shot, and the rest\r\ndriven back to their former distance. At the very same time, contests\r\nwere maintained on all sides of the enclosure; for what with musketeers\r\nin the unfinished barracks, guns and mortars in four different\r\ndirections, and rifle-pits approached under cover of zigzags, the rebels\r\nmaintained a tremendous fire upon the besieged. Wheeler’s guns, under a\r\ngallant young officer, St George Ashe, were manned at all hours, loaded\r\nand fired with great quickness and precision, and pointed in such\r\ndirections as might produce most mischief among the enemy. But the\r\ncontest was unequal in this as in most other particulars; one gun after\r\nanother was disabled by the more powerful artillery of the\r\ninsurgents—until the eight were reduced to six, then to four, three, and\r\nat last two. As the forlorn garrison became weaker and weaker, so did\r\nthe heroic men redouble their exertions in defence. One day a shot from\r\nthe enemy blew up an ammunition-wagon within the intrenchment; and then\r\nit became a question of terrible import how to prevent the other wagons\r\nfrom being ignited. Lieutenant Delafosse, a young officer of the once\r\ntrusted but now disloyal 53d, ran forward, laid himself down under the\r\nwagons, picked up and threw aside the burning fragments, and covered the\r\nflaming portions with handfuls of earth—all the while subject to a\r\nfearful cannonading from a battery of six guns, aimed purposely by the\r\nenemy at that spot! Two soldiers ran to him, with two buckets of water;\r\nand all three succeeded in rescuing the other ammunition-wagons from\r\nperil, and in returning from the dangerous spot in safety.\r\n\r\nUnspeakable must have been the misery of those nine hundred persons—or\r\nrather, nine hundred wofully diminished by deaths—after twenty days of\r\nthis besieging. The hospitals were so thoroughly riddled with shot, and\r\nso much injured by the fire, as to afford little or no shelter; and yet\r\nthe greater portion of the non-combatants remained in them rather than\r\nbe exposed to the scorching glare of the sun outside. Some made holes\r\nfor themselves behind the earthen parapet that bounded the intrenchment;\r\nthese holes were covered with boxes, cots, &c., and whole families of\r\nwretched beings resided in them—more after the fashion of the Bushmen of\r\nAfrica, than of Christian civilised people. Apoplexy struck down many in\r\nthese fearfully heated abodes. At night, all the men had to mount guard\r\nand keep watch in turn; and the women and children, to be near their\r\nmale protectors in the hour of trouble, slept near them behind the\r\nparapet—or rather they tried to sleep; but the bomb-shells vomited forth\r\nfrom three mortars employed by the enemy, kept the terrified people in\r\nan agony that ‘murdered sleep;’ and thus the existence of the women and\r\nchildren was spent in perpetual fear. The soldiers had their food\r\nprepared by the few remaining cooks; but all the rest shifted for\r\nthemselves in the best way they could; and it was often difficult, for\r\nthose who received their scanty rations of rice and grain, to provide a\r\nmouthful of cooked victuals for themselves and their children. Money\r\nwould hardly, one would suppose, be thought of at such a time and place;\r\nyet it appears that the richer bought with money the services of the\r\npoorer, at a rupee or two per meal, for cooking. The innumerable\r\ntroubles and distresses felt by all were deepened at the sight of the\r\nsick and wounded, to whom it was now utterly impossible to render proper\r\nassistance. The stench, too, from the dead bodies of horses and other\r\nanimals that had been shot in the enclosure and could not be removed,\r\nadded to the loathsomeness of the place. Oppressed as they were with\r\nheat, the English nevertheless dreaded the setting in of the rains; for\r\none single day of Indian rain would have converted the earthen abodes of\r\nthe poor people into pools of water, deluged the shot-riddled buildings,\r\nand rendered the muskets useless. Nothing can better denote the\r\nextraordinary scene of ruin and devastation which the interior of the\r\nintrenchment must have presented, than the descriptions given a few\r\nweeks afterwards by English officers concerned in the recovery of\r\nCawnpore. Or rather, it would be more correct to say, that those\r\ndescriptions, by relating only to the intrenchment when deserted,\r\nnecessarily fell far short of the reality as presented when many\r\nhundreds of suffering persons were residing there day after day. One\r\nofficer wrote: ‘We are encamped close to poor old Wheeler’s miserable\r\nintrenchment. Of all the wonders which have passed before us since this\r\noutbreak commenced, the most wonderful is that this ruinous intrenchment\r\nshould have held that horde of blood-thirsty ruffians off so long. This\r\nis a strong statement; but none who have visited it can call it too\r\nstrong.’ Another said: ‘I have had a look at the barracks in which the\r\nunfortunate people were intrenched. They consist of a couple of oblong\r\nbuildings; in one of them, the roof is completely fallen in; and both\r\nare battered with round shot. The verandahs as well as the walls have\r\nbeen torn up by the shot; and round the buildings are some pits dug in\r\nthe ground, and breastworks. The ground inside and out is strewed with\r\nbroken bottles, old shoes, and quantities of books and other documents\r\nand letters. It was a melancholy sight; and the suffering must have been\r\nmore than humanity could bear.’ A third officer corroborated this\r\ngeneral description, but mentioned one or two additional particulars:\r\n‘These buildings formed what was called the European Cavalry Hospital.\r\nRight well and heroically must it have been defended. The walls are\r\nriddled with cannon-shot like the cells of a honey-comb. The doors,\r\nwhich seem to have been the principal points against which the Nena’s\r\nfire was directed, are breached and knocked into large shapeless\r\nopenings. Of the verandahs, which surrounded both buildings, only a few\r\nsplintered rafters remain, and at some of the angles the walls are\r\nknocked entirely away, and large chasms gape blackly at you. Many of the\r\nenemy’s cannon-shot have gone through and through the buildings;\r\nportions of the interior walls and roof have fallen; and here and there\r\nare blood-stains on wall and floor. Never did I yet see a place so\r\nterribly battered.’\r\n\r\nAs a sad story is often most touchingly told in the fewest words, we may\r\nhere advert to the contents of two scraps of paper, shewing how the\r\nmembers of a family were cut off one by one during these days of misery.\r\nWhen Cawnpore fell again into the hands of the British, by a train of\r\noperations hereafter to be described, there were found among other\r\nwrecks two small pieces of paper, covered with blood, and containing a\r\nfew words in pencil; they appeared to have been written by two persons,\r\nboth females. One gave a brief and confused narrative of some of the\r\nevents in the intrenchment; while the other consisted simply of a record\r\nof the dates on which members of the writer’s family were struck down by\r\nthe hand of death.[18] The dates were irregular, and extended into July;\r\nbut every line told, in its simplicity, how agonising must have been the\r\nposition of one who had to record such things of those who were dear to\r\nher. The contents of the two pieces of paper were printed in a Calcutta\r\njournal; and when the mournful tale reached Scotland, it was at once\r\nconcluded, almost as a certainty, from the Christian names mentioned,\r\nthat the sufferers were all members of a family of Lindsays, who had\r\nbeen stationed at Cawnpore. The writers of the two notes were themselves\r\nnumbered with the dead before the gloomy tragedy was ended.\r\n\r\nAll these evidences render only too plain to us the deplorable position\r\nof the Europeans, after eighteen days of siege, and thirty-three of\r\nenforced residence in the intrenchment. When duly considered, who can\r\nwonder that the beleaguered garrison pondered on two possible\r\ncontingencies—a defeat of the rebels by a daring sally, or a release by\r\nparley? If the officers could have known the treachery which was about\r\nto be practised on them, they would probably have attempted the former;\r\nbut they could receive no intelligence or warning, and they did not like\r\nto quit their wives and children at such a perilous time, in uncertainty\r\nof their chances of success.\r\n\r\nTheir first knowledge of the state of affairs at Cawnpore was obtained\r\nin an unexpected way. Among the commercial firms in the city was that of\r\nGreenway Brothers, of which the members and the family had hastily left\r\nCawnpore at the beginning of the troubles, and taken refuge at\r\nNujjubgurh, a village about sixteen miles distant. They were discovered\r\nby Nena Sahib, however, and only saved from death by promising a ransom\r\nof a lac of rupees. Mrs Greenway, a very aged lady, the mother and\r\ngrandmother of a number of the sufferers, was sent by this treacherous\r\nvillain with a message to Sir Hugh Wheeler at the intrenchment, intended\r\nto mask a nefarious and bloody scheme. The message was to this\r\neffect—that the general and all his people should be allowed to proceed\r\nto Allahabad unmolested, on condition that he abandoned Cawnpore, the\r\nintrenchment, the public treasure, the guns, and the ammunition. This\r\nmessage was delivered on the 24th of June; but whether in consequence of\r\nMr Shepherd’s adventure on that same day, presently to be mentioned,\r\ndoes not clearly appear. On the next day an interview took place,\r\noutside the intrenchment, between Sir Hugh and an agent of Nena named\r\nAzimoollah (probably the same who had visited London two years before),\r\nwho was accompanied by a few of the leading mutineers. The terms were\r\nagreed to, with a few modifications; and Nena Sahib gave his signature,\r\nhis seal, and his oath to a contract binding him to provide the\r\nEuropeans with boats and a safe escort to Allahabad.\r\n\r\nSuch was the account given by Mr Shepherd of a transaction narrated\r\nsomewhat differently by other persons; but before noticing certain\r\nanomalies in this matter, it will be well to treat of an occurrence in\r\nwhich that gentleman was unquestionably the best judge of the facts.\r\nWhen the 24th of June arrived, Mr Shepherd adopted a course which led to\r\nhis own preservation, and enabled him to write his brief but mournful\r\nnarrative. The besieged civilians, not being under the command of Sir\r\nHugh Wheeler further than might be consistent with their own safety,\r\nnaturally thought with yearning hearts of their former abodes in the\r\ncity, and compared those abodes with the present deep misery and\r\nprivation. Wheeler would gladly have allowed them to return to Cawnpore;\r\nbut could they cross the intervening ground in safety, or would they\r\nfind safety in the city itself? To ascertain these points, was a project\r\nadopted on the suggestion of Mr Shepherd, who—as a commissariat officer\r\nin a place where scarcely any commissariat services could be\r\nrendered—occupied a position somewhat midway between the military and\r\nthe civil. He had a large family within the intrenchment, comprising his\r\nwife, daughter, brother, sister, three nieces, and two other relatives;\r\nan infant daughter had been killed by a musket-shot a few days earlier.\r\nMr Shepherd’s mission was—to make his way to the city; to ascertain the\r\nstate of public affairs there; to enter into negotiations with\r\ninfluential persons who were not friendly to the mutineers; and to spend\r\nor promise a lac of rupees in any way that might bring about a cessation\r\nof the siege. The arrangement made with Sir Hugh was, that if Mr\r\nShepherd succeeded in returning to the intrenchment with any useful\r\ninformation, he should be allowed to go with his family to Cawnpore. He\r\nstarted; but he never returned, and never again saw those hapless beings\r\nwhose welfare had occupied so much of his solicitude. He disguised\r\nhimself as a native cook, left the intrenchment, passed near the new\r\nbarracks, and ran on towards Cawnpore; but he was speedily descried and\r\ncaptured, and carried before Nena Sahib. Two native women-servants had\r\nshortly before escaped from the intrenchment to the city, and had\r\nreported that the garrison was starving; the new captive, designedly,\r\ngave a very different account; and as the Nena did not know which to\r\nbelieve, he imprisoned all three. Mr Shepherd remained in prison,\r\nsuffering great hardships, from the 24th of June to the 17th of July, as\r\nwe shall presently see.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to reconcile the various accounts of the convention\r\nbetween the besiegers and the besieged, the Nena and the general.\r\nAccording to Mr Shepherd, as we have just seen, the Nena sent a message\r\nby Mrs Greenway on the 24th; and Sir Hugh had an interview with one of\r\nNena’s agents on the 25th. An ayah, or native nurse, however, who had\r\nbeen in the service of Mrs Greenway, and who afterwards gave a narrative\r\nin evidence before some English officers at Cawnpore, said that the\r\nmessage was taken, not by Mrs Greenway, but by a Mrs Jacobi. She\r\nproceeded to aver that Nena Sahib himself went to the intrenchment; and\r\nthen she gave a curious account of the interview, which, to say the\r\nleast of it, is quite consistent with the relative characters and\r\npositions of the two leaders. According to her narrative: ‘The Nena\r\nsaid: “Take away all the women and children to Allahabad; and if your\r\nmen want to fight, come back and do so: we will keep faith with you.”\r\nGeneral Wheeler said: “You take your solemn oath, according to your\r\ncustom; and I will take an oath on my Bible, and will leave the\r\nintrenchment.” The Nena said: “Our oath is, that whoever we take by the\r\nhand, and he relies on us, we never deceive; if we do, God will judge\r\nand punish us.” The general said: “If you intend to deceive me, kill me\r\nat once: I have no arms.” The Nena replied: “I will not deceive you;\r\nrely on us. I will supply you with food, and convey you to Allahabad.”\r\nOn this the general went inside the intrenchment, and consulted with the\r\nsoldiers. They said: “There’s no reliance to be placed on natives; they\r\nwill deceive you.” A few said: “Trust them; it is better to do so.” On\r\nthis the general returned, and said: “I agree to your terms; see us away\r\nas far as Futtehpoor, thence we can get easily to Allahabad.” The reply\r\nwas: “No; I will see you all safe to Allahabad.”’\r\n\r\nThat Sir Hugh Wheeler was mortally wounded before his unfortunate\r\ncompanions left the intrenchment under a solemn pledge of safety, seems\r\nto be generally admitted, but the date of his death is not clearly\r\nknown; nor do the narrators agree as to the names of the persons by whom\r\nthe convention was signed. But on the main point all evidence\r\ncoincides—that a safe retirement to Allahabad was guaranteed. How\r\nvillainously that guarantee was disregarded, we shall now see.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 27th of June that those who remained of the nine hundred\r\ntook their departure from the intrenchment where they had borne so many\r\nmiseries. Collateral facts lead to a conjecture that the sepoys,\r\nbelonging to the native regiments that had mutinied, had become wearied\r\nwith their three-weeks’ detention outside the intrenchment, and wished\r\nto start off to a scene of more stirring incidents at Delhi. This would\r\nnot have suited the Nena’s views; he wanted their aid to grasp the\r\nremainder of the Company’s treasure and ammunition at Cawnpore; and\r\nhence he formed the plan for getting rid of the Europeans and obtaining\r\ntheir wealth without any more fighting. Cannonading ceased on both sides\r\nfrom the evening of the 24th; and from thence to the 27th all was done\r\nthat could be done to fit out the boat-expedition. But under what\r\nmiserable circumstances was this done! The unburied bodies of relations\r\nand friends lay at the bottom of a well; the sick and wounded were more\r\nfit to die than to be removed; the women and children had become haggard\r\nand weak by almost every kind of suffering; the clothes of all had\r\nbecome rent and blood-stained by many a terrible exigency; and\r\nmisgivings occupied the thoughts of those who remembered that the same\r\nNena Sahib, at whose mercy they were now placed, was the man who had\r\nproved a traitor three weeks before. Twenty boats were provided, each\r\nwith an awning. The English were forced to give up the three or four\r\nlacs of rupees which had been brought to the intrenchment. Early on the\r\nmorning of the 27th, the Nena sent a number of elephants, carts, and\r\ndoolies, to convey the women, children, sick, and wounded, to the\r\nriver-side, a distance of about a mile and a half: the hale men\r\nproceeding on foot—if hale they can be called, who were worn down with\r\nhunger, thirst, fatigue, heat, grief for the dear ones who had fallen,\r\nanxiety for those who still lived to be succoured and protected. If Mr\r\nShepherd is right in his statement that the number who took their\r\ndeparture in this mournful procession from the intrenchment was four\r\nhundred and fifty, then one half of the original number of nine hundred\r\nmust have fallen victims to three weeks of privation and suffering.\r\nThose who first reached the river took boat, and proceeded down-stream;\r\nbut the later comers were long detained; and while they were still\r\nembarking, or preparing to embark, they were startled by the report of a\r\nmasked battery of three guns. The dreadful truth now became evident; the\r\nexecrable rebel-chief, in disregard of all oaths and treaties, had given\r\norders for the slaughter of the hapless Europeans. Some of the boats\r\nwere set on fire, and volley upon volley of musketry fired at the\r\nunfortunates—scores of whom were shot dead, others picked off while\r\nendeavouring to swim away. A few boats were hastily rowed across the\r\nriver; but there a body of the 17th N. I., just arrived from Azimghur,\r\nintercepted all escape. The ruffians on both banks waded into the water,\r\nseized the boats within reach, and sabred all the men yet remaining\r\nalive in them. The women were spared for a worse fate; though many of\r\nthem wounded, some with two or three bullets each, these poor creatures,\r\nwith the children, were taken ashore, and placed in a building called\r\nthe Subadar Kothee, in Nena Sahib’s camp.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of two separate boat-parties must be traced. Lieutenant\r\nDelafosse, whose name has already been mentioned in connection with a\r\ngallant achievement in the intrenchment, has placed upon record the\r\nstory of one boat’s adventure, shewing how it happened that he was among\r\nthe very few who escaped the Cawnpore tragedy. After stating that nearly\r\nall the boats which attempted to descend the Ganges were either stopped\r\none by one, or the persons in them shot down where they sat, he proceeds\r\nthus: ‘We had now one boat, crowded with wounded, and having on board\r\nmore than she could carry. Two guns followed us the whole of that day,\r\nthe infantry firing on us the whole of that night. On the second day,\r\n28th June, a gun was seen on the Cawnpore side, which opened on us at\r\nNujjubgurh, the infantry still following us on both sides. On the\r\nmorning of the third day, the boat was no longer serviceable; we were\r\naground on a sand-bank, and had not strength sufficient to move her.\r\nDirectly any of us got into the water, we were fired upon by thirty or\r\nforty men at a time. There was nothing left for us but to charge and\r\ndrive them away; and fourteen of us were told off to do what we could.\r\nDirectly we got on shore the insurgents retired; but, having followed\r\nthem up too far, we were cut off from the river, and had to retire\r\nourselves, as we were being surrounded. We could not make for the river;\r\nwe had to go down parallel, and came to the river again a mile lower\r\ndown, where we saw a large force of men right in front waiting for us,\r\nand another lot on the opposite bank, should we attempt to cross the\r\nriver. On the bank of the river, just by the force in front, was a\r\ntemple. We fired a volley, and made for the temple, in which we took\r\nshelter, having one man killed and one wounded. From the door of the\r\ntemple we fired on every insurgent that happened to shew himself.\r\nFinding that they could do nothing against us whilst we remained inside,\r\nthey heaped wood all round and set it on fire. When we could no longer\r\nremain inside on account of the smoke and heat, we threw off what\r\nclothes we had, and, each taking a musket, charged through the fire.\r\nSeven of us out of the twelve got into the water; but before we had gone\r\nfar, two poor fellows were shot. There were only five of us left now;\r\nand we had to swim whilst the insurgents followed us along both banks,\r\nwading and firing as fast as they could. After we had gone three miles\r\ndown the stream [probably swimming and wading by turns], one of our\r\nparty, an artilleryman, to rest himself, began swimming on his back, and\r\nnot knowing in what direction he was swimming, got on shore, and was\r\nkilled. When we had got down about six miles, firing from both sides [of\r\nthe river] ceased; and soon after we were hailed by some natives, on the\r\nOude side, who asked us to come on shore, and said they would take us to\r\ntheir rajah, who was friendly to the English.’ This proved to be the\r\ncase; for Lieutenant Delafosse, Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, and one or\r\ntwo companions, remained in security and comparative comfort throughout\r\nthe month of July, until an opportunity occurred for joining an English\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAlthough the boat-adventure just narrated was full of painful\r\nexcitement, ending in the death of nearly all the persons by shooting or\r\ndrowning—yet there is one still to be noticed more saddening in its\r\ncharacter, for the sufferers were reserved for a worse death. The name\r\nof Sir Hugh Wheeler is connected with this adventure in a way not easily\r\nto be accounted for; Mr Shepherd and Lieutenant Delafosse were not\r\nwitnesses of it, and no reliable personal narrative is obtainable from\r\nany one who was actually present when it occurred. The probability is,\r\nthat Sir Hugh, although wounded in the intrenchment, did not die until\r\nthe boat-expedition had commenced, and that the same boat contained his\r\ndaughter and his (living or dead) body. At anyrate, this was the last\r\nthe world could hear of a brave old soldier, who went to India\r\nfifty-four years before; who fought with Lord Lake before Delhi in 1804;\r\nwho took an active part in the Punjaub war; and who had been military\r\ncommander of the Cawnpore district from 1850 to 1857. It was also the\r\nlast to be heard of Brigadier Jack, who commanded the Cawnpore\r\ncantonment; and of many brave English officers, from colonels down to\r\nensigns, of both the English and the native regiments.\r\n\r\nWhether the general was alive or dead, and by whomsoever accompanied, it\r\nappears certain that a large party rowed many miles down the Ganges. One\r\naccount states that Baboo Rambuksh, a zemindar of Dowreea Kheyra near\r\nFuttehpoor, stopped the boats, captured the persons who were in them,\r\nand sent them in carts as prisoners back to Cawnpore. The names of Mr\r\nReid, Mr Thomas Greenway, Mr Kirkpatrick, Mr Mackenzie, Captain\r\nMackenzie, and Dr Harris, were mentioned in connection with this band of\r\nunfortunates; but accuracy in this particular is not to be insured. The\r\nnarrative given by Nujoor Jewarree, the native afterwards examined by\r\nEnglish officers at Cawnpore, was different in many points, and much\r\nmore detailed. He stated that the boat in question, after proceeding\r\nsome distance, got upon a sand-bank, where there was a severe encounter;\r\nthe sepoys not only ran along the shore, but followed in boats shooting\r\nat the victims as soon as they got within musket-range, and receiving\r\nmany fatal shots in return. A freshet in the river released the boat,\r\nand the voyage recommenced. Meanwhile, the probable escape of this party\r\nbeing reported to Nena Sahib, he ordered three companies of the 3d Oude\r\ninfantry to pursue the boat, and effect a complete capture. The boat was\r\nsoon after taken, and all the occupants seized as prisoners. ‘There came\r\nout of that boat,’ said Nujoor Jewarree, ‘sixty sahibs (gentlemen),\r\ntwenty-five memsahibs (ladies), and four children—one boy and three\r\nhalf-grown girls.’ His story then proceeded to details which, if\r\ncorrect, shew that Sir Hugh Wheeler was in the boat, and still alive;\r\nfor a contest ensued between Nena and some of the soldiers whether or\r\nnot the old general should be put to death: many of the sepoys wishing\r\nto preserve his life.\r\n\r\nIt will become apparent to the reader, from the nature of the above\r\ndetails, that the true story of the boat-catastrophe at Cawnpore will\r\nprobably never be fully told. All that we positively know is, that one\r\nportion of the wretched victims met their death in the river, by\r\nmuskets, swords, and drowning; and that two other portions were carried\r\nback to a captivity worse even than that of the intrenchment.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of Nena Sahib, after the iniquitous treachery of the\r\n27th of June, bore evident relation to his own advancement as an\r\nindependent chieftain. At sunset on that day he held a review of all the\r\nrebel troops around Cawnpore on a plain between the now deserted\r\nintrenchment and the Ganges. They appear to have consisted of five\r\nregiments of Bengal native infantry, two of Oude native infantry, one of\r\nBengal cavalry, two of Oude cavalry, two of irregular cavalry, a battery\r\nof field-guns, besides sundry detachments of regiments, and marauders\r\nwho became temporary soldiers in the hope of sharing pillage. Guns were\r\nfired in honour of the Nena as sovereign, of his brother as\r\ngovernor-general, and of an ambitious Brahmin as commander-in-chief, of\r\nthe newly restored Mahratta kingdom. From day to day more troops joined\r\nhis standard, after mutinying at various stations on all sides of\r\nCawnpore. Twenty thousand armed men are said to have been in that city\r\nby the 10th of July; and as the Nena was very slow in awarding to them\r\nany of his ill-gotten wealth, they recompensed themselves by plundering\r\nthe inhabitants, under pretext of searching for concealed Europeans.\r\nCawnpore was thus plunged into great misery, and speedily had cause to\r\nlament the absence of its former masters. Nena created new offices, for\r\nbestowal upon those who had served him; and he ordered the neighbouring\r\nzemindars to pay to him the revenue that had wont to be paid to the\r\nCompany. He caused to be proclaimed by beat of tom-tom, throughout\r\nCawnpore and the surrounding district, that he had entirely conquered\r\nthe British; and that, their period of reign in India having been\r\ncompleted, he was preparing to drive them out foot by foot. During this\r\nheyday of self-assumed power, he issued many remarkable proclamations,\r\nworthy of note as indications of his ambitious views, of his hopes as\r\ndependent on the mass of the native people, and of the stigma which he\r\nsought to throw on the British government. Some of these proclamations\r\nare given in full at the end of the present chapter. There are many\r\nfacts which lend support to the supposition that this grasp at power and\r\nwealth was suggested to him by the gradual development of events. He\r\nprobably entertained crafty designs and suppressed vindictiveness from\r\nthe outset; but these did not shew themselves openly until the native\r\ntroops at the cantonment had rebelled. Seeing a door opened by others,\r\nwhich might possibly lead him to power and to vengeance, he seized the\r\noccasion and entered.\r\n\r\nThe last acts of the Cawnpore tragedy now await our attention.\r\n\r\nWhat horrors the poor women suffered during their eighteen days of\r\ncaptivity under this detestable miscreant, none will ever fully know;\r\npartial glimpses only of the truth will ever come to light. According to\r\nthe ayah’s narrative, already noticed, the women and children who were\r\nconveyed from the boats into captivity were a hundred and fifteen in\r\nnumber. The poor creatures (the women and elder girls) were sought to be\r\ntempted by an emissary of the Nena to enter quietly into his harem; but\r\nthey one and all expressed a determination to die where they were, and\r\nwith each other, rather than yield to dishonour. They were then destined\r\nto be given up to the sensual licence of the sepoys and sowars who had\r\naided in their capture; but the heroic conduct of Sir Hugh Wheeler’s\r\ndaughter is said to have deterred the ruffians. What this ‘Judith of\r\nCawnpore’ really did, is differently reported. Her heroism was\r\nmanifested, in one version of the story, by an undaunted and indignant\r\nreproach against the native troops for their treachery to the English\r\nwho had fed and clothed them, and for their cowardice in molesting\r\ndefenceless women; in another version, she shot down five sepoys in\r\nsuccession with a revolver, and then threw herself into a well to escape\r\noutrage; in a third, given by Mr Shepherd, this English lady, being\r\ntaken away by a trooper of the 2d native cavalry to his own hut, rose in\r\nthe night, secured the trooper’s sword, killed him and three other men,\r\nand then threw herself into a well; while a fourth version, on the\r\nauthority of the ayah, represents the general’s daughter as cutting off\r\nthe heads of no less than five men in the trooper’s hut. These accounts,\r\nincompatible one with another, nevertheless reveal to us a true\r\nsoldier’s daughter, an English gentlewoman, resolved to proceed to any\r\nextremity in defence of her own purity.\r\n\r\nThe victims were detained three days at Nena’s camp, with only a little\r\nparched grain to eat, dirty water to drink, and the hard ground to lie\r\nupon, without matting or beds of any kind. The ayah states that the\r\nNena, after the events of the 27th of June, sent to ask the temporarily\r\nsuccessful King of Delhi what he should do with the women and children;\r\nto which a reply was received, that they were not to be killed. Whether\r\nthis statement be right or wrong, the captives were taken from the camp\r\nto Cawnpore, and there incarcerated in a house near the Assembly Rooms,\r\nconsisting of outbuildings of the medical depôt, shortly before occupied\r\nby Sir George Parker. Here they were joined by more than thirty other\r\nEuropean women and children, the unhappy relics of the boat-expedition\r\nthat had been recaptured near Futtehpoor in the vain attempt to escape.\r\nWithout venturing to decide whether the ayah, Nujoor Jewarree, Mr\r\nShepherd, or Lieutenant Delafosse was most nearly correct in regard of\r\nnumbers; or whether Sir Hugh Wheeler was at that time alive or dead—it\r\nappears tolerably certain that many unhappy prisoners were brought back\r\ninto Cawnpore on the 1st of July. All the men were butchered in cold\r\nblood on the evening of the same day. One officer’s wife, with her\r\nchild, clung to her husband with such desperate tenacity that they could\r\nnot be separated; and all three were killed at once. The other women\r\nwere spared for the time. This new influx, together with five members of\r\nthe Greenway family, swelled the roll of prisoners in the small building\r\nto a number that has been variously estimated from a hundred and fifty\r\nto two hundred, nearly all women and children. Their diet was miserably\r\ninsufficient; and their sufferings were such that many died through want\r\nof the necessaries of life. ‘It is not easy to describe,’ says Mr\r\nShepherd, ‘but it may be imagined, the misery of so many helpless\r\npersons: some wounded, others sick, and all labouring under the greatest\r\nagony of heart for the loss of those, so dear to them, who had so\r\nrecently been killed (perhaps before their own eyes); cooped up night\r\nand day in a small low pukha-roofed house, in the hottest season of the\r\nyear, without beds or punkahs, for a whole fortnight—and constantly\r\nreviled and insulted by a set of brutish ruffians keeping watch over\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\nAdded to all these suffering women and children, were those belonging to\r\nthe second boat-expedition from Futteghur. It will be remembered, from\r\nthe details given in a former page, that one party from this fort\r\nreached Bithoor about the middle of June, and were at once murdered by\r\norders of Nena Sahib; while another body, after a manly struggle against\r\nthe rebels for two or three weeks, did not prosecute their voyage\r\ndownwards until July. It will throw light on the perils and terrors of\r\nthese several boat-adventures to transcribe a few sentences from an\r\nofficial account by Mr G. J. Jones, a civil servant of the Company, who\r\nleft Futteghur with the rest on the 4th of July, but happily kept clear\r\nof the particular boat-load which went down to Cawnpore: ‘We had not\r\nproceeded far, when it was found that Colonel Goldie’s boat was much too\r\nlarge and heavy for us to manage; it was accordingly determined to be\r\nabandoned; so all the ladies and children were taken into Colonel\r\nSmith’s boat. A little delay was thus caused, which the sepoys took\r\nadvantage of to bring a gun to bear on the boats; the distance, however,\r\nwas too great; every ball fell short. As soon as the ladies and children\r\nwere all safely on board, we started, and got down as far as\r\nSingheerampore without accident, although fired upon by the villagers.\r\nHere we stopped a few minutes to repair the rudder of Colonel Smith’s\r\nboat; and one out of the two boatmen we had was killed by a matchlock\r\nball. The rudder repaired, we started again, Colonel Smith’s boat taking\r\nthe lead; we had not gone beyond a few yards, when our boat grounded on\r\na soft muddy sand-bank; the other boat passed on; all hands got into the\r\nwater to push her; but, notwithstanding all our efforts, we could not\r\nmanage to move her. We had not been in this unhappy position half an\r\nhour, when two boats, apparently empty, were seen coming down the\r\nstream. They came within twenty yards of us, when we discovered they\r\ncarried sepoys, who opened a heavy fire, killing and wounding several.\r\nMr Churcher, senior, was shot through the chest; Mr Fisher, who was just\r\nbehind me, was wounded in the thigh. Hearing him call out, I had\r\nscarcely time to turn round, when I felt a smart blow on my right\r\nshoulder; a bullet had grazed the skin and taken off a little of the\r\nflesh. Major Robertson was wounded in the face. The boats were now\r\nalongside of us. Some of the sepoys had already got into our boat. Major\r\nRobertson, seeing no hope, begged the ladies to come into the water\r\nrather than fall into their hands. While the ladies were throwing\r\nthemselves into the water, I jumped into the boat, took up a loaded\r\nmusket, and, going astern, shot a sepoy.... Mr and Mrs Fisher were about\r\ntwenty yards from the boat; he had his child in his arms, apparently\r\nlifeless. Mrs Fisher could not stand against the current; her dress,\r\nwhich acted like a sail, knocked her down, when she was helped up by Mr\r\nFisher.... Early the next morning a voice hailed us from the shore,\r\nwhich we recognised as Mr Fisher’s. He came on board, and informed us\r\nthat his poor wife and child had been drowned in his arms.’\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the boat that prosecuted the voyage down to Cawnpore,\r\nor rather Bithoor, suffered greatly: the hands of the gentlemen who were\r\non board, and who pulled the boat, were terribly blistered; the women\r\nand children suffered sad hardships; and all were worn down by fatigue\r\nand anxiety. At Bithoor, so far as the accounts are intelligible, Nena\r\nSahib’s son seized the boat, and sent all the unfortunate Europeans in\r\nher into confinement at Cawnpore. As in other parts of this mournful\r\ntragedy, it will be vain to attempt accuracy in the statement of the\r\nnumbers of those that suffered; but there is a subsidiary source of\r\ninformation, possessing a good deal of interest in connection with the\r\nJuly occurrences. When, at a later date, the reconquerors of Cawnpore\r\nwere in a position to attempt a solution of the terrible mystery; when\r\nthe buildings of Cawnpore were searched, and the inhabitants examined,\r\nfor any documents relating to the suffering Europeans—a paper was found,\r\nwritten in the Mahratta language, in the house of a native doctor who\r\nhad been in charge of the prisoners, or some of them. It was, or\r\nprofessed to be, a list of those who were placed under his care on\r\nTuesday the 7th of July; but whether invalids only, does not clearly\r\nappear. All the names were given, with some inaccuracy in spelling;\r\nwhich, however, cannot be considered as rendering the document\r\nuntrustworthy. In it were to be found large families of Greenways,\r\nReids, Jacobis, Fitzgeralds, Dempsters, and others known to have been in\r\nCawnpore about that time. They were a hundred and sixty-three in number.\r\nTo this hapless group was added another list, containing the names of\r\nforty-seven fugitives belonging to the _second_ boat-party from\r\nFutteghur, who are reported as having arrived on the 11th of July, and\r\nwho included many members of the families of the Goldies, Smiths,\r\nTuckers, Heathcotes, &c., already named in connection with the Futteghur\r\ncalamities. The Mahratta document gave altogether the names of two\r\nhundred and ten persons; but it was silent on the question how many\r\nother Europeans were on those days in the clutches of the ruthless\r\nchieftain of Bithoor. A further list contained the names of about\r\ntwenty-six persons, apparently all women and children, who died under\r\nthis native doctor’s hands between the 7th and the 15th, diminishing to\r\nthat extent the number of those left for massacre. To most of the names\r\n‘cholera,’ or ‘diarrhœa,’ or ‘dysentery’ was appended, as the cause of\r\ndeath; to two names, ‘wounds;’ while one of the patients was ‘a baby two\r\ndays old.’ In what a place, and under what circumstances, for an infant\r\nto be born, and to bear its two wretched days of life!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  House at Cawnpore in which the women and children were massacred.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLet us follow Mr Shepherd’s two narratives—one public, for government\r\ninformation; one in a letter, relating more especially to his own\r\npersonal troubles and sufferings—concerning the crowning iniquity of\r\nNena Sahib at Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nAfter his capture, on attempting to hasten from the intrenchment to the\r\ncity, the commissary was subjected to a sort of mock-trial, and\r\ncondemned to three years’ imprisonment with hard labour; on what plea or\r\nevidence, is not stated. He implies that if he had been known as an\r\nEnglishman, he would certainly have been put to death. On the third day\r\nafter his capture he heard a rumour of certain movements among his\r\nunfortunate compatriots in the intrenchment. ‘Oh! how I felt,’ he\r\nexclaims, ‘when, in confinement, I heard that the English were going in\r\nsafety! I could not keep my secret, but told the subadar of the\r\nprison-guard that I was a Christian; I nearly lost my life by this\r\nexposure.’ Mr Shepherd was confined for twenty-four days in a miserable\r\nprison, with heavy fetters on his legs, and only so much parched grain\r\nfor food as would prevent actual starvation. As days wore on, he\r\nobtained dismal evidence that the departure from the intrenchment had\r\nnot been safely effected; that coward treachery had been displayed by\r\nthe Nena; that innocent lives had been taken; and that the survivors\r\nwere held in horrible thraldom by that cruel man. The commissary was a\r\nprisoner within the city during all the later days of the tragedy;\r\nwhether he was within earshot of the sufferers, is not stated; but the\r\nfollowing contains portions of his narrative relating to that period:\r\n‘Certain spies, whether real or imaginary is not known, were brought to\r\nthe Nena as being the bearers of letters supposed to have been written\r\nto the British [at Allahabad] by the helpless females in their\r\ncaptivity; and with these letters some of the inhabitants of the city\r\nwere believed to be implicated. It was therefore decreed by Nena Sahib\r\nthat the spies, together with all the women and children, as also the\r\nfew gentlemen whose lives had been spared, should be put to death.’ Mr\r\nShepherd connected these gentlemen with the Futteghur fugitives,\r\nconcerning whom, however, he possessed very little information. It was a\r\nfurther portion of Nena’s decree, that all the baboos (Bengalees\r\nemployed as clerks) of the city, and every individual who could read or\r\nwrite English, should have their right hands and noses cut off. At\r\nlength, on the 15th, just before quitting Cawnpore in the vain hope of\r\nchecking the advance of a British column, this savage put his decrees\r\ninto execution. ‘The native spies were first put to the sword; after\r\nthem the gentlemen, who were brought from the outbuildings in which they\r\nhad been confined, and shot with bullets. Then the poor females were\r\nordered to come out; but neither threats nor persuasions could induce\r\nthem to do so. They laid hold of each other by dozens, and clung so\r\nclosely that it was impossible to separate or drag them out of the\r\nbuilding. The troopers therefore brought muskets, and after firing a\r\ngreat many shots through the doors, windows, &c., rushed in with swords\r\nand bayonets. Some of the helpless creatures in their agony fell down at\r\nthe feet of their murderers, and begged them in the most pitiful manner\r\nto spare their lives; but to no purpose. The fearful deed was done\r\ndeliberately and determinedly, in the midst of the most dreadful shrieks\r\nand cries of the victims. From a little before sunset till dark was\r\noccupied in completing the dreadful deed. The doors of the buildings\r\nwere then locked for the night, and the murderers went to their homes.\r\nNext morning it was found, on opening the doors, that some ten or\r\nfifteen females, with a few of the children, had managed to escape from\r\ndeath by hiding under the murdered bodies of their fellow-prisoners. A\r\nfresh command was thereupon sent to murder these also; but the survivors\r\nnot being able to bear the idea of being cut down, rushed out into the\r\ncompound, and seeing a well there, threw themselves into it. The dead\r\nbodies of those murdered on the previous evening were then ordered to be\r\nthrown into the same well; and julluds were appointed to drag them away\r\nlike dogs.’\r\n\r\nMr Shepherd himself did not witness this slaughter; no looker-on, so far\r\nas is known, has placed upon record his or her account of the scene. Nor\r\ndoes there appear any trustworthy evidence to shew what the poor women\r\nendured in the period, varying from four to eighteen days, during which\r\nthey were in the Nena’s power; but the probability is fearfully great\r\nthat they passed through an ordeal which the mind almost shrinks from\r\ncontemplating. Mr Shepherd was evidently of this opinion. While telling\r\nhis tale of misery relating to those poor ill-used creatures, he hinted\r\nat ‘sufferings and distresses such as have never before been experienced\r\nor heard of on the face of the earth.’ It was in his agony of grief that\r\nhe wrote this; when, on the 17th of July, a victorious English column\r\nentered Cawnpore; and when, immediately on his liberation, he hastened\r\nlike others to the house of slaughter. Only when the manacles had been\r\nstruck from his limbs, and he had become once more a free man, did he\r\nlearn the full bitterness of his lot. ‘God Almighty has been graciously\r\npleased to spare my poor life,’ was the beginning of a letter written by\r\nhim on that day to a brother stationed at Agra. ‘I am the only\r\nindividual saved among all the European and Christian community that\r\ninhabited this station.’ [Nearly but not exactly true.] ‘My poor dear\r\nwife, my darling sweet child Polly, poor dear Rebecca and her children,\r\nand poor innocent children Emmeline and Martha, as also Mrs Frost and\r\npoor Mrs Osborne’ [these being the members of his family whom he had\r\nleft in the intrenchment on the 24th of June, when he set out disguised\r\non his fruitless mission], ‘were all most inhumanly butchered by the\r\ncruel insurgents on the day before yesterday;’ and his letter then\r\nconveyed the outpourings of a heart almost riven by such irreparable\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nWhile reserving for a future chapter all notice of the brilliant\r\nmilitary movements by which a small band of heroes forced a way inch by\r\ninch from Allahabad to Cawnpore; and of the struggle made by the Nena,\r\npassionately but ineffectually, to maintain his ill-gotten honours as a\r\nself-elected Mahratta sovereign—it may nevertheless be well in this\r\nplace to follow the story of the massacre to its close—to know how much\r\nwas left, and of what kind, calculated to render still more vividly\r\nevident the fate of the victims.\r\n\r\nNever, while life endures, will the English officers and soldiers forget\r\nthe sight which met their gaze when they entered Cawnpore on the 17th of\r\nJuly. It was frequently observed that all were alike deeply moved by the\r\natrocities that came to light in many parts of Northern India. Calcutta,\r\nweeks and even months afterwards, contained ladies who had escaped from\r\nvarious towns and stations, and who entered the Anglo-Indian capital in\r\nmost deplorable condition: ears, noses, lips, tongues, hands, cut off;\r\nwhile others had suffered such monstrous and incredibly degrading\r\nbarbarities, that they resolutely refused all identification, preferring\r\nto remain in nameless obscurity, rather than their humiliation should be\r\nknown to their friends in England. Their children, in many instances,\r\nhad their eyes gouged out, and their feet cut off. Many were taken to\r\nCalcutta in such hurry and confusion, that it remained long in doubt\r\nfrom what places they had escaped; and an instance is recorded of a\r\nlittle child, who belonged no one knew to whom, and whose only account\r\nof herself was that she was ‘Mamma’s pet:’ mournfully touching words,\r\ntelling of a gentle rearing and a once happy home. An officer in command\r\nof one of the English regiments, speaking of the effect produced on his\r\nmen by the sights and rumours of fiend-like cruelty, observed: ‘Very\r\nlittle is said among the men or officers, the subject being too\r\nmaddening; but there is a curious expression discernible in every face\r\nwhen it is mentioned—a stern compression of the lips, and a fierce\r\nglance of the eye, which shew that when the time comes, no mercy will be\r\nshewn to those who have shewn none.’ He told of fearful deeds; of two\r\nlittle children tortured to death, and portions of their quivering flesh\r\nforced down the throats of their parents, who were tied up naked, and\r\nhad been compelled to witness the slaughter of their innocent ones. The\r\nfeelings of those who were not actually present at the scenes of horror\r\nare well expressed in a letter written by a Scottish officer, who was\r\nhemmed in at Agra during many weeks, when he longed to be engaged in\r\nactive service chastising the rebels. He had, some months before, been\r\nan officer in one of the native regiments that mutinied at Cawnpore;\r\nand, in relation to the events at that place, he said: ‘I am truly\r\nthankful that most of the officers of my late corps died of fever in the\r\nintrenchment, previous to the awful massacre. Would that it had been the\r\nwill of Heaven that all had met the same fate, fearful as that was. For\r\nweeks exposed to a scorching sun, without shelter of any kind, and\r\nsurrounded by the dying and the dead, their ears ringing with the groans\r\nof the wounded, the shouts of sun-struck madmen, the plaintive cries of\r\nchildren, the bitter sobs and sighs of bereaved mothers, widows, and\r\norphans. Even such a death was far better than what fell to the lot of\r\nmany. Not even allowed to die without being made witnesses of the bloody\r\ndeaths of all they loved on earth, they were insulted, abused, and\r\nfinally, after weeks of such treatment, cruelly and foully murdered. One\r\nsickens, and shudders at the bare mention of it.... Oh! how thankful I\r\nam that I have no wife, no sisters out here.’ It was a terrible crisis\r\nthat could lead officers, eight or ten thousand miles away from those\r\nnear and dear to them, to say this.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, as a matter of historical truth, to describe briefly\r\nthe condition of the house of slaughter on the 17th of July; and this\r\ncannot be better done than in the words employed by the officers and\r\nsoldiers in various letters written by them, afterwards made public. The\r\nfirst that we shall select runs thus: ‘I have seen the fearful\r\nslaughter-house; and I also saw one of the 1st native infantry men,\r\naccording to order, wash up part of the blood which stains the floor,\r\nbefore being hanged.’ [This order will presently be noticed in the words\r\nof Brigadier Neill.] ‘There were quantities of dresses, clogged thickly\r\nwith blood; children’s frocks, frills, and ladies’ underclothing of all\r\nkinds; boys’ trousers; leaves of Bibles, and of one book in particular,\r\nwhich seems to be strewed over the whole place, called _Preparation for\r\nDeath_; broken daguerreotypes; hair, some nearly a yard long; bonnets,\r\nall bloody; and one or two shoes. I picked up a bit of paper with the\r\nwords on it, “Ned’s hair, with love;” and opened and found a little bit\r\ntied up with ribbon. The first [troops] that went in, I believe, saw the\r\nbodies with their arms and legs sticking out through the ground. They\r\nhad all been thrown in a heap in the well.’ A second letter: ‘The house\r\nwas alongside the Cawnpore hotel, where the Nena lived. I never was more\r\nhorrified. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the soles of my\r\nboots were more than covered with the blood of these poor wretched\r\ncreatures. Portions of their dresses, collars, children’s socks, and\r\nladies’ round hats, lay about, saturated with their blood; and in the\r\nsword-cuts on the wooden pillars of the room, long dark hair was\r\nsticking, carried by the edge of the weapon, and there hung their\r\ntresses—a most painful sight. I picked up a mutilated Prayer-book; it\r\nappeared to have been open at page 36 of the Litany, where I have little\r\ndoubt those poor creatures sought and found consolation in that\r\nbeautiful supplication; it is there sprinkled with blood.’ A third: ‘We\r\nfound that the Nena had murdered all the women and children that he had\r\ntaken prisoners, and thrown them naked down a well. The women and\r\nchildren had been kept in a sort of zenana, and no attention whatever\r\npaid to cleanliness. In that place they had been butchered, as the\r\nground was covered with clotted blood. One poor woman had evidently been\r\nworking, as a small work-box was open, and the things scattered about.\r\nThere were several children’s small round hats, evidently shewing that\r\nthat was their prison. The well close by was one of the most awful\r\nsights imaginable.’ A fourth: ‘It is an actual and literal fact, that\r\nthe floor of the inner room was several inches deep in blood all over;\r\nit came over men’s shoes as they stepped. Tresses of women’s hair,\r\nchildren’s shoes, and articles of female wear, broad hats and bonnets,\r\nbooks, and such like things, lay scattered all about the rooms. There\r\nwere the marks of bullets and sword-cuts on the walls—not high up, as if\r\nmen had fought—but low down, and about the corners where the poor\r\ncrouching creatures had been cut to pieces. The bodies of the victims\r\nhad been thrown indiscriminately into a well—a mangled heap, with arms\r\nand legs protruding.’ Some of the officers, by carefully examining the\r\nwalls, found scraps of writing in pencil, or scratched in the plaster,\r\nsuch as, ‘Think of us’—‘Avenge us’—‘Your wives and families are here in\r\nmisery and at the disposal of savages’—‘Oh, oh! my child, my child.’ One\r\nletter told of a row of women’s shoes, _with bleeding amputated feet in\r\nthem_, ranged in cruel mockery on one side of a room; while the other\r\nside exhibited a row of children’s shoes, filled in a similarly terrible\r\nway; but it is not certain whether the place referred to was Cawnpore.\r\nAnother writer mentioned an incident which, unless supported by\r\ncollateral testimony, seems wanting in probability. It was to the effect\r\nthat when the 78th Highlanders entered Cawnpore, they found the remains\r\nof Sir Hugh Wheeler’s daughter. They removed the hair carefully from the\r\nhead; sent some of it to the relations of the unfortunate lady; divided\r\nthe rest amongst themselves; counted every single hair in each parcel;\r\nand swore to take a terrible revenge by putting to death as many\r\nmutineers as there were hairs. The storm of indignant feeling that might\r\nsuggest such a vow can be understood easily enough; but the alleged mode\r\nof manifestation savours somewhat of the melodramatic and improbable.\r\n\r\nA slight allusion has been made above to Brigadier Neill’s proceedings\r\nat Cawnpore, after the fatal 17th of July. In what relation he stood to\r\nthe reconquering force will be noticed in its due place; but it may be\r\nwell here to quote a passage from a private letter, written\r\nindependently of his public dispatches: ‘I am collecting all the\r\nproperty of the deceased, and trying to trace if any have survived; but\r\nas yet have not succeeded in finding one.’ [Captain Bruce’s research,\r\npresently to be mentioned, had not then been made.] ‘Man, woman, and\r\nchild, seem all to have been murdered. As soon as that monster Nena\r\nSahib heard of the success of our troops, and of their having forced the\r\nbridge about twenty miles from Cawnpore, he ordered the wholesale\r\nbutchery of the poor women and children. I find the officers’ servants\r\nbehaved shamefully, and were in the plot, all but the lowest-caste ones.\r\nThey deserted their masters and plundered them. Whenever a rebel is\r\ncaught, he is immediately tried, and unless he can prove a defence, he\r\nis sentenced to be hanged at once; but the chief rebels or ringleaders I\r\nmake first clean up a certain portion of the pool of blood, still two\r\ninches deep, in the shed where the fearful murder and mutilation of\r\nwomen and children took place. To touch blood is most abhorrent to the\r\nhigh-caste natives; they think by doing so they doom their souls to\r\nperdition. Let them think so. My object is to inflict a fearful\r\npunishment for a revolting, cowardly, barbarous deed, and to strike\r\nterror into these rebels.... The well of mutilated bodies—alas!\r\ncontaining upwards of two hundred women and children—I have had decently\r\ncovered in and built up as one grave.’\r\n\r\nWith one additional testimony, we will close this scene of gloomy\r\nhorror. The Earl of Shaftesbury, as was noticed in a former page, took\r\noccasion soon after the news of the Cawnpore atrocities reached London,\r\nto advert at a public meeting to the shrinking abhorrence with which\r\nthose deeds were regarded, and to the failure of the journalists to\r\npresent the full and fearful truth. He himself mentioned an incident,\r\nnot as an example of the worst that had been done by the incarnate\r\nfiends at Cawnpore, but to indicate how much remains to be told if pen\r\ndare write or tongue utter it: ‘I have seen a copy of a letter written\r\nand sent to England by an officer of rank who was one of the first that\r\nentered Cawnpore a few hours after the perpetration of the frightful\r\nmassacre.... To his unutterable dismay, he saw a number of European\r\nwomen stripped stark naked, lying on their backs, fastened by the arms\r\nand legs; and there many of them had been lying four or five days\r\nexposed to a burning sun; others had been more recently laid down;\r\nothers again had been actually hacked to pieces, and so recently, that\r\nthe blood which streamed from their mangled bodies was still warm. He\r\nfound children of ten, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen years of age\r\ntreated in the same horrible manner at the corners of the streets and in\r\nall parts of the town: attended by every circumstance of insult, the\r\nmost awful and the most degrading, the most horrible and frightful to\r\nthe conception, and the most revolting to the dignity and feelings of\r\ncivilised men. Cawnpore was only a sample of what was perpetrated in\r\nvarious parts of that vast region, and that with a refinement of cruelty\r\nnever before heard of. Women and children have been massacred before;\r\nbut I don’t believe there is any instance on record where children have\r\nbeen reserved in cold blood to be most cruelly and anatomically tortured\r\nin the presence of their horrified parents before being finally put to\r\ndeath.’\r\n\r\nSomething must be said here concerning the devastated property at\r\nCawnpore, in relation to the miserable beings to whom it had once\r\nbelonged. When the city was again in British hands, and the Rajah of\r\nBithoor driven out with the curses of all English hearts resting on him,\r\nit was found to be in such a devastated state, so far as regarded\r\nEuropeans, that Brigadier Neill was at a loss what to do with the wrecks\r\nof spoliated property. He requested Captain Bruce, of the 5th Punjaub\r\ncavalry, whom he had appointed temporarily superintendent of police, to\r\nwrite to the Calcutta newspapers, inviting the aid of any one able to\r\nidentify the property. The letter said: ‘The property of the unfortunate\r\npeople who lost their lives here has been collected in one spot; and any\r\nwhich can be recognised will be handed over to the owners, or put up to\r\nauction for the benefit of the estates of the deceased. There is a good\r\ndeal of property belonging to the different mercantile firms here, as\r\nwell as to the heirs of deceased officers, &c.; but when I mention that\r\nevery house was gutted, and the property scattered over sixty or seventy\r\nsquare miles of country, it will be apparent how impossible it was to\r\ntake care of individual interests.... Almost all the former European\r\nresidents here having been murdered by the miscreant Nena Sahib, there\r\nis no one forthcoming to recognise or give any information concerning\r\nthe property that has been saved.’ At a later date Captain Bruce\r\ncaptured one of the boatmen who had come down from Futteghur with the\r\nfirst party of unhappy fugitives from that place; the man had a large\r\namount of English jewellery in his possession, comprising brooches,\r\nearrings, bracelets, clasps, studs, shawl-pins, hair-lockets, gold\r\nchains, and similar articles. The boatman had probably secreted the\r\njewel-caskets of the unfortunate ladies, at or shortly before the\r\nforcible landing of the boat-party at Bithoor.\r\n\r\nA much more painful inquiry, than any relating to property, was that\r\nrelating to the loss of life. When Captain Bruce, after many days of\r\nsedulous inquiry, had collected all the available information bearing on\r\nthe fate of the hapless sufferers, he arrived at these conclusions—that\r\nthe only Europeans who escaped from the boat-massacre, and really\r\nobtained their liberty, were two officers and two soldiers—probably\r\nLieutenant Delafosse and three of his companions; that the only one who\r\nremained in Cawnpore and yet preserved his life, was a pensioner of the\r\n3d light dragoons, who was concealed in the city by a trooper of the 4th\r\nlight cavalry; and that there were, on the 31st of July, six Englishmen,\r\nthree Englishwomen, and three children, concealed and protected by the\r\nRajah of Calpee, across the Jumna; but it was not stated, and perhaps\r\nnot known, whether they had gone thither from Cawnpore. Mr Shepherd\r\nhimself was not included in this list. When Lieutenant Delafosse, about\r\na fortnight after the recapture of Cawnpore, was requested by Brigadier\r\nNeill to furnish the best list he could of the English sufferers at that\r\nplace, he endeavoured to separate the victims into three groups,\r\naccording as they had died in the intrenchment, in the boats, or in the\r\nhouse of slaughter. But this was necessarily a very imperfect list; for,\r\non the one hand, he knew nothing of the two parties of fugitives from\r\nFutteghur; while, on the other, he speaks of many persons who came into\r\nthe station with their families on account of disturbance, and whose\r\nnames he did not know. Taking the matter in a military estimate,\r\nhowever, he gave the names of one general (Wheeler), one brigadier\r\n(Jack), three colonels, five majors, thirteen captains, thirty-nine\r\nlieutenants, five ensigns, and nine doctors or army-surgeons; Lady and\r\nMiss Wheeler, Sir George Parker, and two clergymen or missionaries, were\r\namong the other members in his melancholy list. No guess can be made of\r\nthe total numbers from this document, for the persons included under the\r\nword ‘family’ are seldom specified by name or number. The mournful truth\r\nwas indeed only too evident that many complete families—families\r\nconsisting of very numerous members—were among the slaughtered. When the\r\nlists began to be made out, of those who had been known as Cawnpore\r\nresidents or Futteghur fugitives, and who were found dead when the\r\nEnglish recaptured the place, there were such entries as\r\nthese—‘Greenway: Mr, two Mrs, Martha, Jane, John, Henry’—‘Fitzgerald:\r\nJohn, Margaret, Mary, Tom, Ellen’—‘Gilpin: Mrs, William, Harriet, Sarah,\r\nJane, F.’—‘Reid: Mr, Susan, James, Julia, C., Charles’—‘Reeve: Mrs,\r\nMary, Catherine, Ellen, Nelly, Jane, Cornelia, Deon.’\r\n\r\nReligious men, thoughtful men—and, on the other hand, men wrought up to\r\na pitch of exasperated feeling—afterwards spoke of the fatal well as a\r\nspot that should be marked in some way for the observance of posterity.\r\nTwo church missionaries were among the murdered at Cawnpore; and it was\r\nurged in many quarters that a Christian church, built with the splendour\r\nand resources of a great nation, would be a suitable erection at that\r\nspot—as an appropriate memorial to the dead, a striking lesson to the\r\nliving, and the commencement of a grand effort to Christianise the\r\nheathen millions of India. Whether a church be the right covering for a\r\nhideous pit containing nearly two hundred mangled bodies of gentle\r\nEnglish women and children; and whether rival creeds would struggle for\r\nprecedency in the management of its construction, its details, and the\r\nform of its service—may fairly admit of doubt; but with or without a\r\nchurch, the English in no parts of the world are ever likely to forget\r\nTHE WELL AT CAWNPORE!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Nena Sahib’s Proclamations._—When Generals Neill and Havelock were\r\n  at Cawnpore, during a period subsequent to that comprised within the\r\n  range of the present chapter, they found many proclamations which\r\n  had been printed in the Mahratta language by order of Nena Sahib, as\r\n  if for distribution among the natives under his influence. These\r\n  proclamations were afterwards translated into English, and included\r\n  among the parliamentary papers relating to India. A few of them may\r\n  fittingly be reproduced here, to shew by what means that consummate\r\n  villain sought to attain his ends.\r\n\r\n  The following appears to have been issued on or about the 1st of\r\n  July:—‘As, by the kindness of God and the ikbal or good-fortune of\r\n  the Emperor, all the Christians who were at Delhi, Poonah, Satara,\r\n  and other places, and even those 5000 European soldiers who went in\r\n  disguise into the former city and were discovered, are destroyed and\r\n  sent to hell by the pious and sagacious troops, who are firm to\r\n  their religion; and as they have all been conquered by the present\r\n  government, and as no trace of them is left in these places, it is\r\n  the duty of all the subjects and servants of the government to\r\n  rejoice at the delightful intelligence, and to carry on their\r\n  respective work with comfort and ease.’\r\n\r\n  This was accompanied by another: ‘As, by the bounty of the glorious\r\n  Almighty God and the enemy-destroying fortune of the Emperor, the\r\n  yellow-faced and narrow-minded people have been sent to hell, and\r\n  Cawnpore has been conquered, it is necessary that all the subjects\r\n  and landowners should be as obedient to the present government as\r\n  they had been to the former one; that all the government servants\r\n  should promptly and cheerfully engage their whole mind in executing\r\n  the orders of government; that it is the incumbent duty of all the\r\n  ryots and landed proprietors of every district to rejoice at the\r\n  thought that the Christians have been sent to hell, and both the\r\n  Hindoo and Mohammedan religions have been confirmed; and that they\r\n  should as usual be obedient to the authorities of the government,\r\n  and never to suffer any complaint against themselves to reach the\r\n  ears of the higher authority.’\r\n\r\n  On the 5th of the same month the Nena issued the following to the\r\n  kotwal or Mayor of Cawnpore: ‘It has come to our notice that some of\r\n  the city people, having heard the rumours of the arrival of the\r\n  European soldiers at Allahabad, are deserting their houses and going\r\n  out into the districts; you are, therefore, directed to proclaim in\r\n  each lane and street of the city that regiments of cavalry and\r\n  infantry and batteries have been despatched to check the Europeans\r\n  either at Allahabad or Futtehpoor; that the people should therefore\r\n  remain in their houses without any apprehension, and engage their\r\n  minds in carrying on their work.’\r\n\r\n  Another proclamation displayed in an extraordinary way the Rajah’s\r\n  mode of practising on the credulity of the natives, by the most\r\n  enormous and barefaced fictions: ‘A traveller just arrived in\r\n  Cawnpore from Calcutta states that in the first instance a council\r\n  was held to take into consideration the means to be adopted to do\r\n  away with the religion of the Mohammedans and Hindoos by the\r\n  distribution of cartridges. The council came to this resolution,\r\n  that, as this matter was one of religion, the services of seven or\r\n  eight thousand European soldiers would be necessary, as 50,000\r\n  Hindustanis would have to be destroyed, and then the whole of the\r\n  people of Hindostan would become Christians. A petition with the\r\n  substance of this resolution was sent to the Queen Victoria, and it\r\n  was approved. A council was then held a second time, in which\r\n  English merchants took a part, and it was decided that, in order\r\n  that no evil should arise from mutiny, large reinforcements should\r\n  be sent for. When the dispatch was received and read in England,\r\n  thousands of European soldiers were embarked on ships as speedily as\r\n  possible, and sent off to Hindostan. The news of their being\r\n  despatched reached Calcutta. The English authorities there ordered\r\n  the issue of the cartridges, for the real intention was to\r\n  Christianise the army first, and this being effected, the conversion\r\n  of the people would speedily follow. Pigs’ and cows’ fat was mixed\r\n  up with the cartridges; this became known through one of the\r\n  Bengalese who was employed in the cartridge-making establishment. Of\r\n  those through whose means this was divulged, one was killed and the\r\n  rest imprisoned. While in this country these counsels were being\r\n  adopted, in England the vakeel (ambassador) of the Sultan of Roum\r\n  (Turkey) sent news to the sultan that thousands of European soldiers\r\n  were being sent for the purpose of making Christians of all the\r\n  people of Hindostan. Upon this the sultan issued a firman to the\r\n  King of Egypt to this effect: “You must deceive the Queen Victoria,\r\n  for this is not a time for friendship, for my vakeel writes that\r\n  thousands of European soldiers have been despatched for the purpose\r\n  of making Christians the army and people of Hindostan. In this\r\n  manner, then, this must be checked. If I should be remiss, then how\r\n  can I shew my face to God; and one day this may come upon me also,\r\n  for if the English make Christians of all in Hindostan, they will\r\n  then fix their designs upon my country.” When the firman reached the\r\n  King of Egypt, he prepared and arranged his troops before the\r\n  arrival of the English army at Alexandria, for this is the route to\r\n  India. The instant the English army arrived, the King of Egypt\r\n  opened guns upon them from all sides, and destroyed and sunk their\r\n  ships, and not a single soldier escaped. The English in Calcutta,\r\n  after the issue of the order for the cartridges, and when the mutiny\r\n  had become great, were in expectation of the arrival of the army\r\n  from London; but the Great God, in his omnipotence, had beforehand\r\n  put an end to this. When the news of the destruction of the army of\r\n  London became known, then the governor-general was plunged in grief\r\n  and sorrow, and beat his head.\r\n\r\n  ‘Done by order of the Peishwa Bahadoor, 13 Zekaida, 1273 Hegira.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Well at Cawnpore.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Report of Select Committee of House of Commons, 1832.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  The number of persons in the intrenchment on that day will probably\r\n  never be accurately known; but Mr Shepherd, from the best materials\r\n  available to him, made the following estimate:\r\n\r\n          First company, 6th battalion, artillery,         61\r\n          Her Majesty’s 32d foot,                          84\r\n          Her Majesty’s 84th foot,                         50\r\n          1st European Fusiliers,                          15\r\n          English officers, mostly of mutinied regiments, 100\r\n          Merchants, writers, clerks, &c.,                100\r\n          English drummers of mutinied regiments,          40\r\n          Wives and children of English officers,          50\r\n          Wives and children of English soldiers,         160\r\n          Wives and children of civilians,                120\r\n          Sick, native officers, and sepoys,              100\r\n          Native servants, cooks, &c.,                    100\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  ‘Mamma died, July 12.’ ‘Alice died, July 9.’ ‘George died, June 27.’\r\n  ‘Entered the barracks, May 21.’ ‘Cavalry left, June 5.’ ‘First shot\r\n  fired, June 6.’ ‘Uncle Willy died, June 18.’ ‘Aunt Lilly, June 17.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  House of the Rajah at ALLAHABAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                   BENGAL AND THE LOWER GANGES: JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, through the media of telegrams, dispatches, and letters, the\r\ntragical events at Cawnpore became known in England, and were invested\r\nwith an additional horror on account of a vague suspicion that worse\r\nremained untold, a painful and widely spread sensation was produced.\r\nNay, more; in almost every part of the civilised world, whether or not\r\nin harmony with the British government on political and international\r\nquestions, astonishment was excited by these recitals of unapproachable\r\nbarbarity among a people who had acquired a sort of traditional\r\ncharacter for mildness and gentleness. It was about the end of June when\r\nnews of the Meerut outbreak reached London; and from that time each\r\nfortnightly mail revealed the truth that a larger and larger area of\r\nIndia was becoming involved in the troubles of insurrection—that a\r\ngradually increasing number of military officers and civil servants of\r\nthe Company, with their wives and children, were placed in circumstances\r\nof imminent peril. Residents in the United Kingdom, any of whose\r\nrelations and friends were stationed at Cawnpore, sought eagerly and\r\nanxiously, as each mail arrived, for indications that escape had been\r\neffected, or a rescuing force obtained. No such news came, no such hopes\r\nwere realised; darker and more silent was everything relating to that\r\nmuch-dreaded city, until at length the frightful climax became known.\r\n\r\nThere has been a designed avoidance, in the preceding chapters of this\r\nwork, of any account of the measures adopted by the British government\r\nin military matters, or by the British nation in active benevolence, to\r\nremedy the disasters and allay the sufferings to which the Anglo-Indians\r\nhad so suddenly been exposed; for, in truth, India knew little of such\r\nmeasures until August was far advanced. Whether all was done that might\r\nhave been done to expedite the passage of British troops to India, is a\r\nquestion that will have to be considered in its proper place; the\r\nsignificant truth now to be borne in mind is that the Calcutta\r\ngovernment had to meet the difficulties as best it could, with the\r\nscanty supply of troops at that time in India—sending to the Mauritius\r\nand the Cape of Good Hope for such reinforcements as might be available,\r\nbut knowing that aid from England could not arrive for many months. The\r\nmode of treatment adopted here is naturally suggested by the course of\r\nevents themselves. When the ramifications of the Revolt have been traced\r\nthroughout the month of June, a chapter will then be devoted to the\r\nsubjects above indicated; for, although Cawnpore carried us into July,\r\nwe have yet to watch what was concurrently passing at other places.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the region extending from the Burmese frontier to the\r\nDoab, and forming the eastern portion of Northern India; it may for\r\nconvenience be called Bengal, without any rigid adherence to territorial\r\nsubdivision.\r\n\r\nThe Indian government was not as yet troubled with any serious outbreaks\r\nat Chittagong or Dacca, or in any of the districts bounding the Bay of\r\nBengal on the north and east. There were a few native troops at the\r\nfirst named of these two towns, belonging to one of the mutinous\r\nregiments at Barrackpore; but tranquillity was not disturbed by them. It\r\nis true that, when the disloyalty of the 34th became known, the\r\ninhabitants of Chittagong and Tipperah experienced some alarm lest the\r\ndetachment of this regiment stationed at the first-named town might\r\nfollow the pernicious example; but the Company’s collector, having three\r\nlacs of rupees in hand, quietly removed his treasure on board a steamer;\r\nand all uneasiness was soon allayed. Along the extreme eastern border of\r\nthe Bengal presidency, from Assam down through Dacca to Chittagong, the\r\nmonth of June similarly passed over without any disturbances calling for\r\nnotice, although a temporary panic was excited in more than one spot. At\r\nDacca, for instance, the approach of disbanded native mutineers was\r\napprehended; and a mischievous set of Mohammedans, under one Keramut\r\nAli, were detected in the endeavour to sow the seeds of disaffection;\r\nbut by the firmness of the civil authorities, and the arrival of a\r\nhundred seamen in two pinnaces from the Company’s steamers _Zenobia_ and\r\n_Punjaub_, tranquillity was soon restored.\r\n\r\nIn the Calcutta and Barrackpore district, although no actual mutiny\r\noccurred, symptoms were presented that gave much anxiety to the\r\nEuropeans residing at the capital, and prompted energetic preventive\r\nmeasures. We have seen, in Chapter II., that much discontent was\r\nexhibited at Dumdum, Barrackpore, and Berhampore, between the months of\r\nJanuary and May, by the native troops; that this discontent was\r\n(professedly) associated with the affair of the greased cartridges; that\r\ninsubordination led to disarming and disbandment; that the news of the\r\nMeerut and Delhi atrocities in May greatly alarmed the Calcutta\r\ninhabitants; and that many addresses of loyalty and sympathy with the\r\ngovernment were thenceforth presented. During the first half of June,\r\nthe European residents looked with a sort of suspicious watchfulness at\r\neverything that was occurring around them, prepared to find the native\r\ntroops treacherous, yet hoping for better things. The reliable forces in\r\nCalcutta at that time comprised H.M. 53d foot, nine hundred strong, and\r\nfive hundred of H.M. 37th. A company of the 3d battalion Madras\r\nartillery; No. 2 horse field-battery; forty men of the royal artillery,\r\nrecently arrived from Ceylon; and a wing of H.M. 35th foot, were at\r\nBarrackpore. The 78th Highlanders were at Chinsura. On the 13th of June,\r\nCalcutta was thrown into great agitation. A messenger was captured by\r\nthe authorities, and confessed that the sepoys at Barrackpore and\r\nCalcutta had agreed to mutiny on that very night. Arrangements were\r\nimmediately made for defending the city by the aid chiefly of\r\nvolunteers, who had before then begun to organise themselves. The\r\ncivilians took arms, marshalled themselves into companies and corps, and\r\nparaded the streets in the English part of the city. During the two\r\nfollowing nights, this patrolling was conducted very vigilantly; and\r\nevery native met in the streets was required to give an account of his\r\nmovements. On one occasion, Lady Canning, accompanied by the\r\ngovernor-general, the commander-in-chief, Generals Windham and Beatson,\r\nand a glittering staff, went to the parade-ground; where, the volunteers\r\nbeing all drawn up in full array, her ladyship presented them with\r\ncolours, and made a complimentary address; to which Major Turnbull\r\nreplied, as commandant of the ‘Calcutta Volunteer Guards.’\r\n\r\nThe military proceedings on this occasion were as follow. Before light\r\non Sunday morning the 14th, in consequence of a message received from\r\nhead-quarters, a body of the 78th Highlanders was sent off hastily from\r\nChinsura to Barrackpore, to disarm the native troops there; while five\r\nhundred of her Majesty’s 37th foot, landed from Ceylon only the day\r\nbefore, were marched off to a point about midway between Calcutta and\r\nBarrackpore, to command the road during the disarming. About midnight an\r\norder arrived that some of the 37th should return instantly to the\r\ncapital. It had been discovered that the deposed King of Oude, residing\r\nin a handsome house at Garden Reach, was engaged in some machinations\r\nwith a prince of the Delhi family, inimical to the interests of the\r\nEuropeans. A military force marched to his house at four o’clock on the\r\nmorning of the 15th, surrounded the grounds, entered, and seized the\r\nking and his prime minister, together with a large quantity of papers.\r\nArrangements were immediately made for the safe custody of the two\r\nOudians, until the papers could be fully examined. A document came to\r\nlight, containing a Mohammedan sketch-map of Calcutta, dividing the city\r\ninto sections; together with the plan for a general rising of natives on\r\nthe centenary day of the battle of Plassy, the murder of all the\r\nFeringhees, and the establishment of a native ‘raj’ or dynasty on the\r\nruins of that of the Company. It was deemed proper to adopt prompt\r\nmeasures on this occasion; all the native troops in Calcutta were\r\ndisarmed as a precautionary measure, including the Calcutta militia, but\r\nexcluding the governor-general’s body-guard. The sepoys, who made no\r\ndemur whatever, were disarmed in parties wherever they happened to be—at\r\nthe Government House guard, the treasury, the mint, the bank, and the\r\nfort. Each party was confronted by a party of Europeans, and gave up\r\narms on being so commanded; the arms and ammunition were then taken away\r\nby the European soldiers, nothing being left with the sepoys but their\r\nramrods, with which to ‘shoulder arms.’ It was explained to them that\r\nthe disarming was only a temporary precautionary measure; that they\r\nwould receive pay and perform sentinel-duty as before; and that the arms\r\nwould be restored to them as soon as public tranquillity was insured.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Calcutta long continued to bear well in remembrance\r\nthe 14th of June. For nearly a month the civilians had been in the habit\r\nof taking revolvers with them to church, balls, and parties; but on this\r\nday, such were the vague terrors of slaughter whispered from mouth to\r\nmouth, that the excitement rose to a height of panic. One who was there\r\nat the time said: ‘The infection of terror raged through all classes.\r\nChowringhee and Garden Reach were abandoned for the fort and the vessels\r\nin the river. The shipping was crowded with fugitives; and in houses\r\nwhich were selected as being least likely to be attacked, hundreds of\r\npeople gladly huddled together, to share the peculiar comfort which the\r\npresence of crowds imparts on such occasions. The hotels were fortified;\r\nbands of sailors marched through the thoroughfares, happy in the\r\nexpectation of possible fighting and the certainty of grog. Every group\r\nof natives was scanned with suspicion. The churches and the course were\r\nabandoned for that evening. A rising, either of Hindoos or of\r\nMussulmans, or perhaps of both, was looked upon as certain to happen in\r\nthe course of the night. From Chandernagore the whole body of European\r\nand East Indian inhabitants emigrated to Calcutta; the _personnel_ of\r\ngovernment, the staff of the army, all in short who had anything to\r\nlose, preferred to come away and run the risk of losing it, rather than\r\nencounter the unknown danger.’ A somewhat unworthy timidity seems, at\r\nfirst sight, to mark all this; but the civilians and private families of\r\nCalcutta, utterly unused to war, had been so horror-stricken by the\r\naccounts of murders of officers, violations of women, mutilations of\r\nlittle children, burnings of sick and wounded, and other atrocities\r\nperpetrated in Upper India, as to become in a certain sense paralysed.\r\nAfter the decisive measures adopted by the government on the 14th and\r\nnext following day, the inhabitants of the capital gradually recovered\r\ntheir equanimity; and the month closed peacefully.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, the sepoys cantoned at Barrackpore made the same kind of\r\ndemonstration as at an earlier date—that is, they professed fidelity,\r\nand asked to be furnished with the new Enfield rifle. In the 43d\r\nregiment B. N. I., there was a general application made to Major\r\nMatthews, by native officers as well as sepoys, to this effect;\r\naccompanied by the expression of a desire to be sent to fight against\r\nthe rebels at Delhi. The 70th B. N. I., almost to a man, came forward on\r\nthe 5th of the month, and presented a petition to Colonel Kennedy, with\r\na similar prayer. The petition began somewhat boastfully: ‘From the day\r\non which his lordship the governor-general condescended to come in\r\nperson to answer our petition, on which occasion General Hearsey\r\ntranslated to us his address, and which was fully explained to us by our\r\ncolonel, interpreter, adjutant, and all the other officers of the\r\nregiment, our honour and name have been raised amongst our countrymen;’\r\nand it ended with an abundant profession of loyalty towards the\r\ngovernment. The 34th regiment B. N. I., or such of the men as were at\r\nBarrackpore, imitated the example of their fellow-soldiers; they sent a\r\npetition to Lieutenant-colonel Wheler on the 9th of June, expressive of\r\ntheir loyalty, and requesting that the new rifle might be served out to\r\nthem. The government, in reply to all these petitions and\r\ndemonstrations, stated that the supply of Enfield rifles received from\r\nEngland was too small to permit the granting of the request; but that\r\nthe request itself was received with much gratification by the\r\ngovernor-general, ‘proving as it does that the men of these regiments\r\nconsider there is nothing objectionable either in the rifles or in the\r\ncartridges to their caste or religion.’\r\n\r\nLittle was it suspected in how short a time all these complimentary\r\nexchanges of good words would be brought to nought. On the evening of\r\nthe 13th came to light those plottings or suspicions of plottings which\r\nled to an imperative order for the disarming of the sepoys. In a private\r\nletter on this subject, the major-general said: ‘Some villains in the\r\ncorps were trying to incite the good men and true to mutiny; these good\r\nmen ought to have given the villains up to justice;’ but as they did\r\nnot, he thought it a safe plan to disarm them all. When this\r\ndetermination was made known by the authorities, many of the English\r\nofficers of the native regiments felt much vexed and hurt; they still\r\nrelied on their men, and deemed it a humiliation to themselves that such\r\na course should be deemed necessary. Captain Greene, of the 70th N. I.,\r\nwrote to Major-general Hearsey, on the Sunday morning: ‘Is it of any use\r\nmy interceding with you on behalf of my old corps, which, for nigh\r\ntwenty-five years, has been my pride and my home? I cannot express to\r\nyou the pain with which I have just heard that they are this evening to\r\nbe subjected to the indignity of being disarmed. Had the men misbehaved,\r\nI should have felt no sympathy for them; but they have not committed\r\nthemselves in any way; and surely after the governor-general’s laudatory\r\norder and expression of confidence, it would not be too much to expect\r\nthat a fair trial of their sincerity should be afforded.’ Captain Greene\r\nproceeded to say that he knew the men thoroughly, and had the most firm\r\nand undoubted reliance on their fidelity. The authorities were not\r\naffected by this appeal. At four o’clock in the afternoon, the 35th and\r\n78th British regiments were marched to the parade-ground at Barrackpore,\r\nwith loaded muskets, and supported by six 12-pounders loaded with\r\ngrape-shot. The native troops were then summoned to the parade, and\r\nordered at once to surrender their arms; this they did quietly and\r\npromptly, for even if disposed to resist, the force against them was too\r\nformidable. In little more than an hour, the muskets of the disarmed\r\nregiments were on the way to Calcutta. The sepoys bore the trial\r\nquietly, but with many expressions of mortification.\r\n\r\nCaptain Greene, in the postscript to a letter written on the following\r\nday to the major-general, mentioned certain facts which ought to have\r\nopened his eyes to the possibility of deceit and danger. A Mussulman\r\nsepoy of the 70th regiment came to him on the 9th of the month, and\r\nafter conversation on some contemplated movements of the captain, said:\r\n‘Whatever you do, do not take your lady with you.’ He gave as a reason:\r\n‘Because the minds of the native soldiers are now in a state of\r\ninquietude; and it would be better to let the lady remain here till\r\neverything is settled in the country, as there is no knowing what might\r\nhappen.’ On being asked whether he had reason to doubt the regiment, he\r\nexclaimed: ‘Who can tell the hearts of a thousand men!’ He implied that\r\na few evil men were endeavouring to corrupt the rest. This communicative\r\nsepoy went on to observe, that the cartridge grievance, although founded\r\non a misconception in the first instance, was afterwards used as a means\r\nof imposing on the ignorant. There were men who went about saying that\r\nthe English endeavoured to destroy the caste and religion of the people;\r\nthat the government ought to be uprooted; and that as the Company had\r\nbeen driven out of Cabool, so might it be driven out of the whole of\r\nIndia, if the people acted resolutely and with one accord. Another\r\nsepoy, a Hindoo, in the same regiment, told Captain Greene that the\r\nMussulmans generally in all regiments were in the habit of talking to\r\nthe effect that their ‘raj’ or supremacy was coming round again. Many\r\nothers spoke indistinctly to him about dangers, and promised to protect\r\nhim if peril arose. It may not be improbable that most of the men in\r\nthat regiment were really disposed to be faithful, and that the danger\r\narose from a smaller number of malcontents. Captain Greene went to see\r\nhis men in the lines after the disarming; it was a painful interview to\r\nthem all. ‘I have been for upwards of an hour,’ he wrote, ‘endeavouring\r\nto allay the excited feelings of our men, who were in such a state of\r\ndepression, that many were crying bitterly, and none could cook their\r\nfood. Some, too, had sold their cooking utensils for a mere trifle in\r\nthe bazaar.’ The regiment had not been disbanded as if in disgrace, only\r\ndisarmed as if for precaution; but the men nevertheless regarded it as a\r\ndegradation. Some budmashes (scoundrels) had been amongst them in the\r\nnight, and had urged them to desert, telling them that handcuffs and\r\nmanacles had been sent for. The captain earnestly implored that their\r\narms should be given back to them: ‘Unless something be speedily done to\r\nreassure them, the influence of their European officers will cease to\r\nexist, and a good regiment will crumble away before hopelessness and\r\ndesertion. All of us, black and white, would be so thankful to you if\r\nyou would get us back our arms, and sent away from here at once.’ This\r\nrequest was not acceded to.\r\n\r\nWithin ten days after the disarming, a hundred and thirty-three men of\r\nthe disarmed regiments (2d, 34th, 43d, and 70th) deserted from\r\nBarrackpore and Calcutta, nearly all belonging to the 43d. The\r\nmagistrates and military authorities in many parts of Bengal were\r\ntroubled with the arrival of these deserters, who came two or three at a\r\ntime, and endeavoured to excite disaffection against a government which,\r\nas they alleged, had disgraced them without a cause. A reward of fifty\r\nrupees was offered for the apprehension of every deserter.\r\n\r\nDeparting from Calcutta and Barrackpore as centres, it may be well now\r\nto sketch the state of the surrounding districts during the month of\r\nJune. Towards the northeast, many towns, especially Jessore, were thrown\r\noccasionally into excitement by occurrences which would have been\r\nregarded as trivial if happening at any other time, but which required\r\nwatchful attention on the part of the authorities in the peculiarly\r\nsensitive state of the native mind. In the Dinagepore district, near the\r\nBhotan frontier, several moulvies spread reports of the intention of the\r\ngovernment forcibly to convert native children to Christianity: these\r\nreports caused many of the children in the vernacular school at\r\nMuthoorapore to be withdrawn by their parents; and on an examination of\r\nthe moulvies being ordered by the authorities, it was found that the\r\nfakeers and other religious mendicants were accustomed to carry\r\ntreasonable letters and concealed correspondence within the bamboo\r\nsticks with which most of them were provided. North and west of the\r\nAnglo-Indian capital, a similar state of public affairs was presented; a\r\nsuccession of troublous symptoms that required attention, but without\r\nentailing serious consequences. In some instances disarmed sepoys were\r\ndetected exciting disaffection; in others, seditious placards were\r\nposted up in the towns. In the country around Ramgurh a few\r\ncircumstances transpired to produce temporary disquietude. The Ramgurh\r\nbattalion was believed to be stanch; but as some discontent had spread\r\namong the troops in relation to the cartridge grievance, and as two or\r\nthree petty chieftains exhibited symptoms of disloyalty, judicious and\r\nearly precautions were taken against disaster—especially at Hazarebagh,\r\nwhere the treasury contained a lac of rupees, and where the jail,\r\ncontaining nine hundred prisoners, was guarded solely by two companies\r\nof a native regiment: a kind of guard which had proved very perilous at\r\nMeerut a few weeks earlier. At Midnapore, a sepoy of the jail-guard,\r\ndetected in an attempt to excite mutiny among the men of the\r\nShekhawuttie battalion, was tried, found guilty, and hanged.\r\n\r\nThe most serious event in the districts around Calcutta, perhaps, was\r\none that occurred in the Sonthal Pergunnahs; in which the 5th irregular\r\ncavalry displayed a tendency, fatal on a small scale, and likely to have\r\nbecome much more disastrous if not speedily checked. Lieutenant Sir N.\r\nR. Leslie was adjutant of that regiment at Rohnee. On the 12th of June,\r\nthis officer, Major Macdonald, and Assistant-surgeon Grant, while\r\nsitting in Sir Norman Leslie’s compound, in the dusk of the evening,\r\nwere suddenly attacked by three men armed with swords. Major Macdonald\r\nreceived a blow which laid his head open, and rendered him insensible\r\nfor many hours; Mr Grant received sword-wounds on the arm and the leg;\r\nwhile Sir Norman was so severely wounded that he expired within half an\r\nhour. The miscreants escaped after this ferocious attack, without\r\nimmediate detection.[19] At first it was hoped and believed that the\r\nregiment had not been dishonoured by the presence of these murderers on\r\nthe muster-roll; Mr Grant was of this opinion; but Major Macdonald,\r\ncommandant of the regiment, took a less favourable view. The offenders,\r\nit soon appeared, belonged to the regiment; a chase was ordered; two of\r\nthe men were found after a time, with their clothes smeared with blood;\r\nwhile the third, when taken, candidly owned that it was his sword that\r\nhad given the death-stroke to Leslie. The murderers were speedily\r\nexecuted, but without giving any information touching the motives that\r\nled to their crime. Three sowars of the regiment, Ennus Khan, Kurreem\r\nShere Khan, and Gamda Khan, received encomiums and rewards for the\r\nalacrity with which they had pursued the reckless men who had thus\r\nbrought discredit on their corps. The official dispatches relating to\r\nthis affair comprised two letters written by Major Macdonald to Captain\r\nWatson, an officer commanding a squadron of the same regiment at\r\nBhagulpore; they afford curious illustration of the cheerful, daring,\r\ncare-for-naught spirit in which the British officers were often\r\naccustomed to meet their difficulties during those exciting scenes: ‘I\r\nam as fairly cut and neatly scalped as any Red Indian could do it. I got\r\nthree cracks in succession on the head before I knew I was attacked. I\r\nthen seized my chair by the arms, and defended myself successfully from\r\ntwo of them on me at once; I guarded and struck the best way I could;\r\nand at last Grant and self drove the cowards off the field. This is\r\nagainst my poor head, writing; but you will be anxious to know how\r\nmatters really were; I expect to be in high fever to-morrow, as I have\r\ngot a bad gash into the skull besides being scalped.’ This was written\r\non the day after the murderous attack; and three days later the major\r\nwrote: ‘My dear fellow, I have had a sad time of it, and am but little\r\nable to go through such scenes, for I am very badly wounded; but, thank\r\nGod, my spirits and pluck never left me for a moment. When you see my\r\npoor old head, you will wonder I could hold it up at all. I have\r\npreserved my scalp in spirits of wine—such a jolly specimen!’\r\n\r\nIn Cuttack, bounding the northwest corner of the Bay of Bengal, many\r\nMohammedans were detected in the attempt to sap the loyalty of the\r\nShekhawuttie battalion. Lieutenant-colonel Forster, with the\r\nhead-quarters of that corps at Midnapore, succeeded by his personal\r\ninfluence in keeping the men from anything beyond slight acts of\r\ninsubordination; but he had many proofs, in that town and in the Cuttack\r\ndistrict, that the Company’s ‘raj’ or rule was being preached against by\r\nmany emissaries of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis rapid sketch will have shewn that the eastern divisions of Bengal\r\nwere not disturbed by any very serious tumults during the month of June.\r\nIncipient proofs of disaffection were, it is true, manifested in many\r\nplaces; but they were either unimportant in extent, or were checked\r\nbefore they could rise to perilous magnitude. In the western divisions,\r\nhowever, the troubles were more serious; the towns were further from\r\nCalcutta, nearer to the turbulent region of Oude; and these conditions\r\nof locality greatly affected the steadiness and honesty of the native\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier days of the month, considerable excitement prevailed\r\nin the districts of which Patna and Dinapoor are the chief towns; in\r\nconsequence of the general spread of a belief, inculcated by the\r\ndeserters from Barrackpore, that the government contemplated an active\r\ninterference with the religion of the people. A similar delusion, it was\r\nspeedily remembered, had existed in the same parts about two years\r\nearlier; the government had adopted such measures as, it was hoped,\r\nwould remove the prejudice; but the events of 1857 shewed that the\r\nhealing policy of 1855 had not been effective for the purpose in view.\r\nUntil the 13th of June, the disaffection was manifested only by sullen\r\ncomplainings and indistinct threats; but on that day matters presented a\r\nmore serious aspect. The various magistrates throughout the Patna\r\ndivision reported to the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, that although no\r\nacts of violence had been committed, the continuance of tranquillity\r\nwould mainly depend on the fidelity of the native troops at Dinapoor,\r\nthe most important military station in that part of India. Dinapoor may,\r\nin fact, be regarded as the military post belonging to the great city of\r\nPatna, which is about ten miles distant.[20] The magistrates also\r\nreported, as one result of their inquiries, that the Mohammedans in that\r\ndivision were thoroughly disaffected; and that if any disturbance\r\noccurred at head-quarters (Dinapoor), a rapid extension of the revolt\r\nwould be almost inevitable. When these facts and feelings became known,\r\nsuch precautionary measures were adopted as seemed best calculated to\r\navert the impending evils. An increase was made in the police force at\r\nBehar; the ghats or landing-places were carefully watched and regulated;\r\nthe frontiers of the neighbouring disaffected districts were watched; a\r\nportion of the Company’s treasure at Arrah and Chupra was sent off to\r\nCalcutta, and the rest removed to Patna for safe custody under a guard\r\nof Sikhs; a volunteer guard was formed in that city; measures were taken\r\nto defend the collectorate and the opium factories; six companies of the\r\nSikh police battalion were marched from Soorie to Patna; and places of\r\nrendezvous for European residents were appointed at many of the\r\nstations, to facilitate a combined plan of action in the event of\r\nmutinous symptoms appearing among the native troops. The Rajahs of\r\nBettiah and Hutwah addressed letters expressive of loyalty and affection\r\ntowards the government, and placed men and elephants at the disposal of\r\nthe local authorities, to assist in the maintenance of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the month, an alarm prevailed at Chupra and Arrah,\r\nconsequent on the mutinous proceedings in certain towns further to the\r\nwest, presently to be noticed. Large works were under construction near\r\nthose places in connection with the East India Railway; and the\r\nEuropeans engaged in those operations, as well as others resident in the\r\ntwo towns, made a hasty retreat, and sought for refuge at Dinapoor. The\r\nmagistrates and most of the civil officers remained at their posts, and\r\nby their firmness prevented the alarm from degenerating into a panic. At\r\nGayah or Gya, a town between Patna and the great trunk-road—celebrated\r\nfor its Bhuddist and Hindoo temples, and the great resort of pilgrims of\r\nboth religions—considerable apprehension prevailed, on account of the\r\nunprotected state of a large amount of Company’s treasure in the\r\ncollectorate; an apprehension increased by the presence of many\r\ndesperate characters at that time in the jail, and by the guard of the\r\njail being wholly composed of natives who would remain steady only so\r\nlong as those at Dinapoor were ‘faithful to their salt.’ Fortunately,\r\nthe authorities were enabled to obtain a guard of European soldiers,\r\nchiefly from her majesty’s 64th regiment; and thus the ruffians, more to\r\nbe dreaded than even the rebellious sepoys, were overawed.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid seeing, in the course of events throughout\r\nIndia, how much importance ought to be attached to the matter just\r\nadverted to—the instrumentality of robbers and released prisoners in\r\nproducing the dreadful scenes presented. India swarms with depredators\r\nwho war on the peaceful and industrious inhabitants—not merely\r\nindividual thieves, but robber-tribes who infest certain provinces,\r\ndirecting their movements by the chances of war or of plunder. Instead\r\nof extirpating these ill-doers, as Asiatic sovereigns have sometimes\r\nattempted to do, the East India Company has been accustomed to capture\r\nand imprison them. Hence the jails are always full. At every important\r\nstation we have several hundred, sometimes two or three thousand, such\r\nprisoners. The mutiny set loose these mischievous elements. The release\r\nof crowds of murderers and robbers from prison, the flocking of others\r\nfrom the villages, and the stimulus given to latent rogues by the\r\nprospect of plunder, would account for a large amount of the outrage\r\ncommitted in India—outrage which popular speech in England attaches to\r\nthe sepoys alone.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, the first indications of a conspiracy at Patna were\r\ndetected. A nujeeb of the Behar station guards was discovered in an\r\nattempt to tamper with the Sikhs of the police corps, and to excite them\r\nto mutiny: he was tried, convicted, sentenced to death, and hanged;\r\nwhile three Sikhs, who had been instrumental in his apprehension, were\r\npublicly rewarded with fifty rupees each. In singular contrast to this,\r\nthree other nujeebs of the same force, on the same day, placed in the\r\ncommissioner’s hands a letter received from sepoys at Dinapoor, urging\r\nthe Behar guards to mutiny, and to seize the treasure at Patna before\r\nthe Sikhs could arrive to the rescue: this, as a valuable service\r\nrendered at a critical period, was rewarded by donations of two hundred\r\nrupees to each of the three men. The next symptoms were exhibited by\r\ncertain members of the Wahabee sect of Mohammedans at Patna. The\r\nfanatical devotion of these Mussulmans to their spiritual leaders, their\r\nabnegation of self, and their mode of confidential communication with\r\neach other without written documents, render it at all times difficult\r\nto produce legal proof of any machinations among them; while their\r\nmutual fidelity enables them to resist all temptation to betrayal. The\r\ncommissioner of Patna, having suspicions of the proceedings of the\r\nWahabees in that city, deemed it politic to detain four of their number\r\nas hostages for the sect generally—a sect formidable for its\r\norganisation, and peculiarly hostile to Christians. They were placed in\r\na sort of honourable confinement, while a general disarming of the\r\ninhabitants took place. On another occasion a police jemadar, Waris Ali,\r\nwas ascertained to be in possession of a large amount of treasonable\r\ncorrespondence; he was known to be in some way related to the royal\r\nfamily of Delhi; and the letters found in his house threw suspicion on\r\nmore than one native official in the service of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe most serious affair at Patna, however, occurred about the close of\r\nthe period to which this chapter more particularly relates. At about\r\neight o’clock in the evening of the 3d of July, a body of Mohammedans,\r\nvariously estimated from eighty to two hundred, assembled at the house\r\nof one of their number, one Peer Ali Khan, a bookseller, and proceeded\r\nthence to the Roman Catholic church and mission-house in Patna, with two\r\nlarge green flags, a drum beating, and cries of ‘Ali! Ali!’ The priest,\r\nwhom they probably intended to murder, fortunately escaped. They emerged\r\ninto the street, reiterated their cries, and called on the populace to\r\njoin them. Dr Lyell, principal assistant to the opium agent, immediately\r\nwent to the spot, accompanied by nine Sikhs. He rode ahead of his\r\nsupport, was shot down by the rioters, and his body mangled and\r\nmutilated before the Sikhs could come up. A force of Sikhs and nujeebs\r\nspeedily recovered the unfortunate gentleman’s body, killed some of the\r\ninsurgents, and put the rest to flight. This appeared at first to be a\r\nreligious demonstration: a Mohammedan fanatic war-cry was shouted, and\r\nthe property of the Catholic mission was destroyed, but without any\r\nplunder or removal. Thirty-six of the insurgents were afterwards\r\ncaptured and tried; sixteen of the number, including Peer Ali Khan, who\r\nwas believed to be the murderer of Dr Lyell, were condemned to death;\r\neighteen, including a jemadar, were sentenced to various terms of\r\nimprisonment; and two were acquitted. All the facts of this temporary\r\noutbreak were full of significance; for it soon became evident that\r\nsomething more than mere religious hostility had been intended. Peer Ali\r\nKhan was offered a reprieve if he would divulge the nature of the\r\nconspiracy; but, like a bold, consistent fanatic, he remained defiant to\r\nthe last, and nothing could be got out of him. It was afterwards\r\nascertained that he had been in secret communication with an influential\r\nnative at Cawnpore ever since the annexation of Oude, and that the\r\ndetails of some widely-spread plot had been concerted between them. The\r\ncapture of the thirty-six rioters had been effected by the disclosures\r\nof one of the band, who was wounded in the struggle; he declared that a\r\nplot had been in existence for many months, and that men were regularly\r\npaid to excite the people to fight for the Padishah of Delhi. Letters\r\nfound in Peer Ali’s house disclosed an organised Mussulman conspiracy to\r\nre-establish Mohammedan supremacy on the ruins of British power; and\r\nbesides the correspondence with Cawnpore and Delhi, a clue was obtained\r\nto the complicity of an influential Mohammedan at Lucknow.\r\n\r\nPatna was sufficiently well watched and guarded to prevent the\r\noccurrence of anything of more serious import. Nevertheless, the\r\nEuropean inhabitants were kept in great anxiety, knowing how much their\r\nsafety depended on the conduct of the sepoys at Dinapoor. The\r\ncommissioner at the one place, and the military commandant at the other,\r\nwere naturally rejoiced to receive any demonstrations of fidelity on the\r\npart of the native troops, even if the sincerity of those demonstrations\r\nwere not quite free from doubt. On the 3d of June, Colonel Templer\r\nassembled the 7th regiment B. N. I. on the military parade at Dinapoor,\r\nto read to them the flattering address which Viscount Canning had made\r\nto the 70th regiment at Barrackpore, on the manifestation of loyalty by\r\nthat corps. On the conclusion of this ceremony, the native commissioned\r\nofficers came up to the colonel, and presented to him a petition, signed\r\nby two subadars and five jemadars on the part of the whole regiment. The\r\npetition is worth transcribing,[21] to shew in what glowing language the\r\nnative troops could express their grateful allegiance—but whether\r\nsincere or insincere, no European could at that time truly tell. Colonel\r\nTempler desired that all the men who acknowledged the petition to\r\ncontain an expression of their real sentiments and wishes, would\r\nshoulder their arms in token thereof; on which every one present\r\nshouldered arms. The native officers afterwards assured the colonel,\r\nwith apparent earnestness, that it was the eager wish of the whole\r\nregiment to be afforded an opportunity of removing even a suspicion of\r\ntheir disaffection. When Colonel Templer repeated this to Major-general\r\nLloyd, the military commander of the Dinapoor division, and when Lloyd\r\nforwarded the communication to Calcutta, the regiment of course received\r\nthanks for the demonstration, and were assured that ‘their good conduct\r\nwill be kept in remembrance by the governor-general in council.’ It was\r\nnot until a later month that the small value of these protestations was\r\nclearly shewn; nevertheless the Europeans at Dinapoor continued\r\nthroughout June to be very uneasy. Almost every one lived in the square;\r\nthe guns were kept ready loaded with grape; the few European troops were\r\non the alert; and pickets were posted all round the station. A motley\r\nassemblage—planters, soldiers, civilians, railway men, and others—was\r\nadded to the ordinary residents, driven in from the surrounding\r\ndistricts for protection. The officers gave up their mess-house to the\r\nladies, who completely filled it.\r\n\r\nIn Tirhoot, a district north of Patna, on the other side of the Ganges,\r\nthe planters and others were thrown into great excitement during the\r\nmonth of June, by the events occurring around them. About the middle of\r\nthe month, planters left their estates and civilians their homes, to go\r\nfor refuge to the Company’s station at Mozufferpoor. Eighty gentlemen,\r\nthirty ladies, and forty children, were all crowded into two houses; the\r\nladies and children shut up at night, while the men slept in verandahs,\r\nor in tents, or took turns in patrolling. The nujeebs, stationed at that\r\nplace, were suspected of being in sympathy with the mutineers; one of\r\nthe Company’s servants, disguised as a native, went to their quarters\r\none night, and overheard them conversing about murdering the Europeans,\r\nlooting the treasury (which contained seven lacs of rupees), and\r\nliberating the prisoners. This was the alarm that led to the assembling\r\nof the Europeans at the station for mutual protection; and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the protection would have been needed had Dinapoor\r\nfallen. One of the Mohammedan inhabitants was seized at Mozufferpoor,\r\nwith a quantity of treasonable correspondence in his possession; and the\r\ncommandant at Segowlie condemned to the gallows with very little scruple\r\nseveral suspicious characters in various parts of the district.\r\n\r\nAdvancing up the Ganges, we come to Ghazeepore, on its northern or left\r\nbank. This town, containing forty thousand inhabitants, is rendered\r\nsomewhat famous by a palace once belonging to the Nawab of Oude, but now\r\nin a very ruinous state; also by the beautiful Grecian tomb erected to\r\nthe Marquis of Cornwallis; and by the rose-gardens in its vicinity,\r\nwhere rose-leaves are gathered for making the celebrated otto or attar.\r\nThe bungalows of the Company’s civil servants are situated west of the\r\ntown; and beyond them is the military cantonment. During the early part\r\nof the month of June, the 65th native infantry, stationed at Ghazeepore,\r\nwas sorely tempted by the mutinying of so many other regiments at\r\nstations within forty or fifty miles; but they remained stanch for some\r\ntime longer.\r\n\r\nNot so the sepoys at Azimghur, a town northwest of Ghazeepore,\r\ncontaining twelve or fourteen thousand inhabitants, and a military\r\nstation. At this place the 17th regiment Bengal native infantry was\r\nposted at the beginning of June. On the 3d of the month an escort of\r\nthirty troopers of the 13th irregular cavalry brought in seven lacs of\r\nrupees from Goruckpore, _en route_ to Benares. At six o’clock in the\r\nevening the treasure was started again on its journey; and in three\r\nhours afterwards the 17th mutinied, influenced apparently rather by the\r\nhope of _loot_ than by any political or religious motives. During\r\nseveral days previously the authorities had been employed in throwing up\r\na breastwork around the cutchery or government offices; but this was not\r\nfinished. The sepoys killed their quartermaster, and wounded the\r\nquartermaster-sergeant and two or three others. The officer on guard at\r\nthe fort of the cutchery sent out a picket to the lines, and ordered the\r\nnative artillerymen to load their guns: this they refused to do; and\r\nhence the infantry were left to follow out their plan of spoliation. The\r\nofficers were at mess when the mutiny began; seeing the danger, they\r\nplaced the ladies on the roof of the cutchery. When the sepoys came up,\r\nthey formed a square round the officers, and swore to protect them; but\r\nstated that, as some men of the regiment were very hostile, it would be\r\nbetter for all the officers to depart. The men brought carriages for\r\nthem, and escorted them ten miles on the road to Ghazeepore. Many of the\r\ncivilians hurried away to the same town, reaching that place in terrible\r\nplight. The marauders from the neighbouring villages did not fail in\r\ntheir usual course; they plundered the bungalows of the Europeans at\r\nAzimghur, or such of them as were left unprotected.\r\n\r\nFar more serious were the events at Benares, than at any city or station\r\neastward of it, during the month of June. It would in all probability\r\nhave been still more deplorable, had not European troops arrived just at\r\nthat time. Lieutenant-colonel Neill reached Benares on the 3d of June,\r\nwith sixty men and three officers of the 1st Madras Fusiliers\r\n(Europeans), of which regiment five more companies were in the rear,\r\nexpecting to reach that city in a few days. The regiment had been\r\ndespatched in great haste by Viscount Canning, in the hope that it would\r\nappear before Cawnpore in time to relieve Sir Hugh Wheeler and his\r\nunfortunate companions. Neill intended, after a day’s repose, to have\r\nstarted from Benares for Cawnpore on the 4th; but he received timely\r\nnotice from Lieutenant Palliser that the 17th B. N. I. had mutinied at\r\nAzimghur; and that the treasure, passing through Azimghur in its way\r\nfrom Goruckpore to Benares (mentioned in the last paragraph), had been\r\nplundered by the mutinous sepoys. Brigadier Ponsonby, the commandant at\r\nBenares, at once consulted with Colonel Neill concerning the propriety\r\nof disarming the 37th regiment Bengal infantry, stationed at that city.\r\nNeill recommended this to be done, and done at once. It was then\r\narranged that Neill should make his appearance on parade at five o’clock\r\nthat same afternoon, accompanied by a hundred and fifty of H.M. 10th\r\nfoot, sixty of the Madras Fusiliers, and three guns of No. 12\r\nfield-battery, with thirty artillerymen. They were to be joined on\r\nparade by the Sikh regiment, in which Lieutenant-colonel Gordon placed\r\nfull confidence, and about seventy of the 13th irregular cavalry. The\r\n37th, suspecting what was intended, ran to the bells of arms, seized and\r\nloaded their muskets, and fired upon the Europeans; several men fell\r\nwounded, and the brigadier was rendered powerless by a sun stroke.\r\nThereupon Colonel Neill, assuming the command, made a dash on the native\r\nlines. What was now the perplexity of the colonel, and the mortification\r\nof Gordon, at seeing the Sikhs halt, waver, turn round, wound several of\r\ntheir officers, fire at the Europeans, and disperse! It was one of those\r\ninexplicable movements so frequently exhibited by the native troops.\r\nNeill, now distrusting all save the Europeans, opened an effective fire\r\nwith his three guns, expelled the 37th from their lines, burnt the huts,\r\nand then secured his own men and guns in the barrack for the night.\r\nEarly on the morning of the 5th he sent out parties, and brought in such\r\nof the arms and accoutrements of the 37th as had been left behind; he\r\nalso told off a strong body to bring the Company’s treasure from the\r\ncivil offices to the barracks. Colonel Neill fully believed that if he\r\nhad delayed his bold proceeding twelve hours, the ill-protected treasury\r\nwould have been seized by the 37th, and that the numerous European\r\nfamilies in the cantonment would have been placed in great peril before\r\nhe could reach them. The barracks were between the cantonment and the\r\ncity; and near them was a building called the mint. Into this mint,\r\nbefore going on parade on the 4th, he had arranged that all the families\r\nshould go for refuge in the event of any disturbance taking place. A few\r\nof the Sikhs and of the irregular cavalry remained faithful; and Colonel\r\nNeill, with his two hundred and forty Europeans[22] and these fragments\r\nof native regiments, contrived to protect the city, the barracks, the\r\nmint, and the cantonment—a trying task, to defend so large an area from\r\nmutinous sepoys and troopers, and predatory budmashes. He had to record\r\nthe deaths of Captain Guise, an army-surgeon, and two privates; and the\r\nwounding of about double this number—casualties surprising for their\r\nlightness, considering that there were nearly two thousand enemies to\r\ncontend against altogether. Of the insurgents, not less than two hundred\r\nwere killed or wounded. It was at once determined to strengthen the\r\nneighbouring fort of Chunar or Chunargur; for which duty a small\r\ndetachment of Europeans was drafted off.\r\n\r\nSuch were the military operations of the 4th and 5th of June, as told in\r\nthe brief professional language of Colonel Neill. Various officers and\r\ncivilians afterwards dwelt more fully on the detailed incidents of those\r\ntwo days. The 13th irregular cavalry and the Sikhs (Loodianah regiment)\r\nhad been relied on as faithful; and the 37th had greatly distinguished\r\nitself in former years in the Punjaub and Afghanistan. This infantry\r\nregiment, however, exhibited signs of insubordination on the 1st of the\r\nmonth; and on the 3d, Lieutenant-colonel Gordon, second in command under\r\nPonsonby, told the brigadier that the men of the 37th were plotting with\r\nthe ruffians of the city. The brigadier, Mr Tucker the commissioner, and\r\nMr Gubbins the judge, thereupon conferred; and it was almost fully\r\ndetermined, even before Colonel Neill’s arrival, and before the receipt\r\nof disastrous news from Azimghur, that the disbandment of the regiment\r\nwould be a necessary measure of precaution. The irregular cavalry were\r\nstationed at Sultanpore and Benares, and were called in to aid the\r\nEuropeans and Sikhs in the disarming. A few of the officers, unlike\r\ntheir brethren, distrusted these troopers; and the distrust proved to be\r\nwell founded. The Sikhs, at the hour of need, fell away as soon as the\r\n37th had seized their arms; and the irregulars were not slow to follow\r\ntheir example; so that, in effect, the insurgents were to the Europeans\r\nin the ratio of eight or ten to one. One of the English officers of the\r\n37th has placed upon record a few facts shewing how strangely unexpected\r\nwas this among many of the Indian outbreaks, by the very men whose\r\nposition and experience would naturally lead them (one might suppose) to\r\nhave watched for symptoms. In the first instance, Major Barrett,\r\nindignant at the slight which he believed to have been put upon the good\r\nand faithful sepoys of the 37th, by the order for disarming, went openly\r\ntowards the regiment during the struggle at the bells of arms, to shew\r\nhis confidence in them; but when he saw some of his men firing at him,\r\nand others approach him with fixed bayonets, he felt painfully that he\r\nmust both change his opinions and effect a retreat. Some of the 37th\r\ndid, however, remain ‘true to their salt;’ and these, under the major,\r\nwho had escaped the shots aimed at him, were among the troops sent to\r\nguard Chunar Fort. As a second instance: after Captain Guise, of the\r\n13th irregulars, had been shot down by men of the 37th, the brigadier\r\nappointed Captain Dodgson to supply his place; but the irregulars,\r\ninstead of obeying him, flashed their swords, muttered some indistinct\r\nobservations, fired at him, and at once joined the rebels whom they had\r\nbeen employed and expected to oppose. A third instance, in relation to\r\nthe Sikhs, shall be given in the words of the officer above adverted to:\r\n‘Just as the irregulars were flashing their swords in reply to Captain\r\nDodgson’s short address, I was horrified by noticing about a dozen of\r\nthe Sikhs fire straight forward upon the European soldiers, who were\r\nstill kneeling and firing into the 37th. The next moment some half-dozen\r\nof their muskets were staring me in the face, and a whole tempest of\r\nbullets came whizzing towards me. Two passed through my forage-cap, and\r\nset my hair on fire; three passed through my trousers, one just grazing\r\nmy right thigh. I rushed headlong at one of the fellows whom I had\r\nnoticed more especially aiming at me, but had scarcely advanced three\r\npaces when a second volley of bullets saluted me.’ This volley brought\r\nthe officer low; he lay among the wounded, unrecognised for many hours,\r\nbut was fortunate enough to obtain surgical aid in time to avert a fatal\r\nresult. Many circumstances afterwards came to light, tending to shew\r\nthat, had not Neill and Ponsonby taken the initiative when they did, the\r\nnative troops would probably have risen that same night, and perhaps\r\nimitated the Meerut outrages. One of the missionaries at Benares, who\r\nescaped to Chunar as soon as the outbreak occurred, said in a letter:\r\n‘Some of the 37th have confessed to their officers that they had been\r\ntold out in bands for our several bungalows, to murder all the Europeans\r\nat ten o’clock that night; and that, too, at the time they were\r\nvolunteering to go to Delhi, and Colonel Spottiswoode was walking about\r\namong them in plain clothes with the most implicit confidence.’\r\n\r\nThe fighting, during this exciting day at Benares, was practically over\r\nas soon as the rebels began to retreat; but then the perils of the\r\ncivilians commenced. More correctly, however, it might be said that the\r\nwild confusion began earlier; for while the brief but fierce military\r\nstruggle was still in progress on the parade-ground, the native guards\r\nof the 37th at the treasury, the hospital, the mess-house, the bazaar,\r\nand other buildings, broke from their duty, and proceeded to molest the\r\nEuropeans, with evident hopes of plunder. A Sikh, one Soorut Singh, has\r\nbeen credited with an act which saved many lives and much treasure. He\r\nwas among the Sikhs of the treasury-guard; and when the rising began,\r\ntalked to his comrades, and prevented them from rising in mutiny; many\r\ncivilians, with their families, who had taken refuge in the collector’s\r\ncutcherry, were saved through this friendly agency; while the treasure\r\nwas held intact till the following morning, when European troops\r\nconvoyed it to a place of safety. The Rev. Mr Kennedy, a resident in\r\nBenares at that time, states that the faithfulness of these Sikhs, about\r\nseventy in number, was deemed so remarkable under the circumstances,\r\nthat £1000 was given to them as a reward for their safe guardianship of\r\nthe £60,000 in the treasury. After the discomfiture on the\r\nparade-ground, the rebels, maddened by defeat and thirsting for blood,\r\nstreamed through many of the compounds in the cantonment as they\r\nretreated, and fired as they passed, but happily so much at random that\r\nlittle danger was done. Several of the Europeans took refuge in stables\r\nand outhouses. Others climbed to the roofs of their houses, and hid\r\nbehind the parapets. At the house of the commissioner, Mr Tucker, many\r\nladies and children found concealment under straw on the flat roof;\r\nwhile the gentlemen stood by to defend them if danger should approach.\r\nThree or four families took boat, and rowed out into the middle of the\r\nGanges, there to remain until news of returning tranquillity should\r\nreach them; much booming of cannon and rattling of musketry, much\r\nappearance of fire and smoke hovering over city and cantonment, kept the\r\noccupants of the boats in constant anxiety; but when victory had\r\ndeclared for the British, and these boat-parties had returned to land,\r\nescorts arrived to convey the non-combatants and some of the officers to\r\nthe mint, in accordance with the arrangement already made. They arrived\r\nat that building about midnight. Mr Kennedy described in a letter the\r\nscene presented at the mint when he and his family reached it: ‘What a\r\nscene of confusion and tumult was there. All in front, bands of English\r\nsoldiers, ready to act at a moment’s notice; men, women, and children,\r\nhigh and low, huddled together, wondering at meeting at such a time and\r\nin such a place, not knowing where they were to throw themselves down\r\nfor the night, and altogether looking quite bewildered.’ A young\r\nofficer, throwing into his narrative that light-heartedness which so\r\noften bore up men of his class during the troubles of the period, gave a\r\nlittle more detail of the first night and day at the place of refuge: ‘I\r\nfound everybody at the mint, which several had only reached after many\r\nadventures. We bivouacked in the large rooms, and slept on the\r\nroof—ladies, children, ayahs, and punkah-coolies; officers lying down\r\ndressed, and their wives sitting up fanning them. In the compound or\r\nenclosure below, there was a little handful of Europeans, perhaps a\r\nhundred and fifty in all; others were at the barracks half a mile off.\r\nThere was a picknicking, gipsifying look about the whole affair, which\r\nprevented one from realising that the small congregation were there\r\nmaking a stand for a huge empire, and that their lives were upon the\r\ntoss-up of the next events.’\r\n\r\nDuring a considerable portion of the month of June, the Europeans made\r\nthe mint their chief place of residence, the men going out in the\r\ndaytime to their respective duties, and the ladies and children\r\nremaining in their place of refuge. On the 5th, few ventured out of the\r\nbuilding, unless heavily armed or strongly escorted. The mint had a most\r\nwarlike appearance, bristling with arms, and soon became almost\r\ninsupportably hot to the numerous persons congregated within it. The hot\r\nwinds of Benares at that time, nearly midsummer, were terrible for\r\nEuropeans to bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mess-house of the Officers of the 6th Native Infantry at ALLAHABAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, which was Sunday, Mr Kennedy performed divine service at the\r\nmint, and a church-missionary at the barracks. Gradually, on subsequent\r\ndays, whole families would venture out for a few hours at a time, to\r\ntake a hasty glance at homes which they had so suddenly been called upon\r\nto quit; but the mint continued for two or three weeks to be the refuge\r\nto which they all looked. As European troops, however, were arriving at\r\nBenares every day, on the way to the upper provinces, it soon became\r\npracticable, under the energetic Neill, to insure tranquillity in and\r\nnear that city with a very small number of these so much-valued Queen’s\r\ntroops. The capture and execution of insurgents, under the combined\r\norders of Neill, Tucker, and Gubbins, respectively the commandant,\r\ncommissioner, and judge, were conducted with such stern promptness as\r\nstruck terror into the hearts of evildoers. It may be instructive to see\r\nin what light Mr Kennedy, as a clergyman, regarded these terrible\r\nexecutions, which are admitted to have been very numerous: ‘The gibbet\r\nis, I must acknowledge, a standing institution among us at present.\r\nThere it stands, immediately in front of the flagstaff, with three ropes\r\nalways attached to it, so that three may be executed at one time.\r\nScarcely a day passes without some poor wretches being hurled into\r\neternity. It is horrible, very horrible! To think of it is enough to\r\nmake one’s blood run cold; but such is the state of things here, that\r\neven fine delicate ladies may be heard expressing their joy at the\r\nrigour with which the miscreants are treated. The swiftness with which\r\ncrime is followed by the severest punishment strikes the people with\r\nastonishment; it is so utterly foreign to all our modes of procedure, as\r\nknown to them. Hitherto the process has been very slow, encumbered with\r\nforms, and such cases have always been carried to the Supreme Court for\r\nfinal decision; but now, the commissioner of Benares may give\r\ncommissions to any he chooses (the city being under martial law), to\r\ntry, decide, and execute on the spot, without any delay and without any\r\nreference.’\r\n\r\nJounpoor or Juanpoor, a town about thirty miles northwest of Benares,\r\nwas one of those which shared with that city the troubles of the month\r\nof June. A detachment of the Loodianah Sikh regiment, under Lieutenant\r\nMara, stationed at that place, mutinied most suddenly and unexpectedly\r\non the 5th, within less than an hour after they had shaken hands with\r\nsome of the European residents as a token of friendly feeling. The men\r\nrevolted through some impulse that the English in vain endeavoured to\r\nunderstand at the time; but it was afterwards ascertained that some of\r\nthe mutinous 37th from Benares had been tampering with them. In the\r\nfirst whirl of the tumult, the lieutenant and a civilian were shot down,\r\nand the rest of the Europeans sought safety by flight. Information\r\nreached Benares, after some days, that the fugitives were in hiding; and\r\na small detachment was at once despatched for their relief. It was now\r\nfound, as in many other instances, that amid all the brutality and\r\nrecklessness of the mutineers and budmashes, there were not wanting\r\nhumane natives in the country villages, ready to succour the distressed;\r\none such, named Hingun Lall, had sheltered and fed the whole of the\r\nfugitives from Jounpoor for five days.\r\n\r\nThere were many stations at which the number of insurgent troops was\r\ngreater; there were many occasions on which the Europeans suffered more\r\ngeneral and prolonged miseries; there were many struggles of more\r\nexciting character between the dark-skinned soldiers and the light—but\r\nthere was not perhaps, throughout the whole history of the Indian\r\nmutinies, an outbreak which excited more astonishment than that at\r\nAllahabad in the early part of June. It was totally unexpected by the\r\nauthorities, who had been blinded by protestations of loyalty on the\r\npart of the troops. This place (see p. 107) occupies a very important\r\nposition in relation to Upper India generally; being at the point where\r\nthe Jumna and Ganges join, where the Benares region ends and the Oude\r\nregion begins, where the Doab and Bundelcund commence, where the\r\nriver-traffic and the road-traffic branch out in various directions, and\r\nwhere the great railway will one day have a central station. As stated\r\nin a former page, the 6th Bengal Native Infantry, stationed at\r\nAllahabad, voluntarily came forward and offered their services to march\r\nagainst the Delhi mutineers. For this demonstration they were thanked by\r\ntheir officers, who felt gratified that, amid so much desertion,\r\nfidelity should make itself apparent in this quarter. Rather from a\r\nvague undefined uneasiness, than from any suspicion of this particular\r\nregiment, the Europeans at Allahabad had for some time been in\r\nuneasiness; there had been panics in the city; there had been much\r\npatrolling and watching; and the ladies had been looking anxiously to\r\nthe fort as a place of refuge, whither most of them had taken up their\r\nabode at night, returning to their homes in the cantonment or the city\r\nin the daytime. From Benares, Lucknow, or other places, they apprehended\r\ndanger—but not from within.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 5th of June that Colonel Simpson, of the 6th regiment,\r\nreceived Viscount Canning’s instructions to thank his men for their\r\nloyal offer to march and fight against the rebels at Delhi; and it was\r\non the same day that news reached Allahabad, probably by telegraph, of\r\nthe occurrences at Benares on the previous day, and of the possible\r\narrival of some of the insurgents from that place. The officers still\r\ncontinued to trust the 6th regiment, not only in virtue of the recent\r\nprotestation of fidelity by the men, but on account of their general\r\ngood conduct; indeed, this was one of the most trusted regiments in the\r\nwhole native army. Nevertheless, instructions were given to arm the\r\ncivilians as well as the military, and to prepare for making a good\r\nstand at the fort. Many civilians, formed into a militia, under the\r\ncommandant of the garrison, slept in the fort that night, or relieved\r\neach other as sentinels at the ramparts. There were at that time in the\r\nfort, besides the women and children, about thirty invalid artillerymen,\r\nunder Captain Hazelwood; a few commissariat and magazine sergeants;\r\nabout a hundred volunteer civilians; four hundred Sikhs, of the\r\nFerozpore regiment, under Lieutenant Brasyer; and eighty men of the 6th\r\nregiment, guarding the main gate. Several Europeans with their families,\r\nthinking no danger nigh, slept outside the fort that night. Two\r\ncompanies of the native regiment under three English officers, and two\r\nguns under Captain Harward, were sent to guard the bridge of boats\r\nacross the Ganges in the direction of Benares. Captain Alexander, with\r\ntwo squadrons of the 3d regiment Oude irregular cavalry, was posted in\r\nthe Alopee Bagh, a camping-ground commanding the roads to the station.\r\nThe main body of the 6th remained in their lines, three miles from the\r\nfort. All proceeded quietly until about nine o’clock on the evening of\r\nthe 6th of June; when, to the inexpressible astonishment and dismay of\r\nthe officers, the native regiment rose in revolt. The two guns were\r\nseized by them at the bridge-head, and Harward had to run for his life.\r\nIn the cantonment the officers were at mess, full of confidence in their\r\ntrusted troops, when the sepoys sounded the alarm bugle, as if to bring\r\nthem on parade; those who rushed out were at once aimed at, and nearly\r\nall shot dead; while no fewer than nine young ensigns, mere boys who had\r\njust entered on the career of soldiering, were bayoneted in the\r\nmess-room itself. It was a cruel and bloody deed, for the poor youths\r\nhad but recently arrived, and were in hostility with none. Captain\r\nAlexander, when he heard of the rising, hastened off to the lines with a\r\nfew of his troopers; but he was caught in an ambush by a body of the\r\nsepoys, and at once shot down. The sepoys, joined by released prisoners\r\nand habitual plunderers, then commenced a scene of murder and\r\ndevastation in all directions; Europeans were shot wherever they could\r\nbe seen; the few English women who had not been so fortunate as to seek\r\nrefuge in the fort, were grossly outraged before being put to death; the\r\ntelegraph wires were cut; the boats on the river were seized; the\r\ntreasury was plundered; the houses of native bankers, as well as those\r\nof European residents, were pillaged; and wild licence reigned\r\neverywhere. Terrible were the deeds recorded—a whole family roasted\r\nalive; persons killed by the slow process of cutting off in succession\r\nears, nose, fingers, feet, &c.; others chopped to pieces; children\r\ntossed on bayonets before their mother’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAn affecting incident is related of one of the unfortunate young\r\nofficers so ruthlessly attacked at the mess-house. An ensign, only\r\nsixteen years of age, who was left for dead among the rest, escaped in\r\nthe darkness to a neighbouring ravine. Here he found a stream, the\r\nwaters of which sustained his life for four days and nights. Although\r\ndesperately wounded, he contrived to raise himself into a tree at\r\nnight-time, for protection from wild beasts. On the fifth day he was\r\ndiscovered, and dragged by the brutal insurgents before one of their\r\nleaders. There he found another prisoner, a Christian catechist,\r\nformerly a Mohammedan, whom the sepoys were endeavouring to terrify and\r\ntorment into a renunciation of Christianity. The firmness of the native\r\nwas giving way as he knelt before his persecutors; but the boy-officer,\r\nafter anxiously watching him for a short time said: ‘Oh, my friend, come\r\nwhat may, do not deny the Lord Jesus!’ Just at this moment the arrival\r\nof Colonel Neill and the Madras Fusiliers (presently to be noticed) at\r\nAllahabad was announced; the ruffians made off; the poor catechist’s\r\nlife was saved; but the gentle-spirited young ensign sank under the\r\nwounds and privations he had endured. When this incident became known\r\nthrough the medium of the public journals, the father of the young\r\nofficer, town-clerk of Evesham, told how brief had been the career thus\r\ncut short. Arthur Marcus Hill Cheek had left England so recently as the\r\n20th of March preceding, to commence the life of a soldier; he arrived\r\nat Calcutta in May, was appointed to the 6th native regiment, reached\r\nAllahabad on the 19th of the same month, and was shot down by his own\r\nmen eighteen days afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe inmates of the fort naturally suffered an agony of suspense on the\r\nnight of the 6th. When they heard the bugle, and the subsequent firing,\r\nthey believed the mutineers had arrived from Benares; and as the\r\nintensity of the sound varied from time to time, so did they picture in\r\nimagination the varying fortunes of the two hypothetical opposing\r\nforces—the supposed insurgents from the east, and the supposed loyal 6th\r\nregiment. Soon were they startled by a revelation of the real truth—that\r\nthe firing came from their own trusted sepoys. The Europeans in the\r\nfort, recovering from their wonder and dismay, were fortunately enabled\r\nto disarm the eighty sepoys at the gate through the energy of Lieutenant\r\nBrasyer; and it was then found that these fellows had loaded and capped\r\ntheir muskets, ready to turn out. Five officers succeeded in entering\r\nduring the night, three of them naked, having had to swim the Ganges.\r\nFor twelve days did the Europeans remain within the fort, not daring to\r\nemerge for many hours at a time, lest the four hundred Sikhs should\r\nprove faithless in the hour of greatest need. The chief streets of the\r\ncity are about half a mile from the fort; and during several days and\r\nnights troops of rioters were to be seen rushing from place to place,\r\nplundering and burning. Day and night the civilians manned the ramparts,\r\nsucceeding each other in regular watches—now nearly struck down by the\r\nhot blazing sun; now pouring forth shot and shell upon such of the\r\ninsurgents as were within reach. The civilians or volunteers formed\r\nthemselves into three corps; one of which, called the Flagstaff\r\nDivision, was joined by about twenty railway men—sturdy fellows who had\r\nsuffered like the rest, and were not slow to avenge themselves on the\r\nmutineers whenever opportunity offered. After a time, the volunteers\r\nsallied forth into the city with the Sikhs, and had several skirmishes\r\nin the streets with the insurgents—delighted at the privilege of\r\nquitting for a few hours the hot crowded fort, even to fight. It was by\r\ndegrees ascertained that conspiracy had been going on in the city before\r\nthe actual outbreak occurred. The standard of insurrection was unfurled\r\nby a native unknown to the Europeans: some supposed him to be a moulvie,\r\nor Mohammedan religious teacher; but whatever may have been his former\r\nposition, he now announced himself as viceroy of the King of Delhi. He\r\nquickly collected about him three or four thousand rebels, sepoys and\r\nothers, and displayed the green flag that constitutes the Moslem symbol.\r\nThe head-quarters of this self-appointed chieftain were in the higher\r\npart of the city, at the old Mohammedan gardens of Sultan Khoosroo;\r\nthere the prisoners taken by the mutineers were confined—among whom were\r\nthe native Christian teachers belonging to the Rev. Mr Hay’s mission.\r\n\r\nThe movements of Colonel Neill must now be traced. No sooner did this\r\ngallant and energetic officer hear of the occurrences at Allahabad, than\r\nhe proceeded to effect at that place what he had already done at\r\nBenares—re-establish English authority by a prompt, firm, and stern\r\ncourse of action. The distance between the two cities being about\r\nseventy-five miles, he quickly made the necessary travelling\r\narrangements. He left Benares on the evening of the 9th, accompanied by\r\none officer and forty-three men of the Madras Fusiliers. The horses\r\nbeing nearly all taken off the road, he found much difficulty in\r\nbringing in the dâk-carriages containing the men; but this and all other\r\nobstacles he surmounted. He found the country between Mirzapore and\r\nAllahabad infested with bands of plunderers, the villages deserted, and\r\nnone of the authorities remaining. Major Stephenson, with a hundred more\r\nmen, set out from Benares on the same evening as Neill; but his\r\nbullock-vans were still more slow in progress; and his men suffered much\r\nfrom exposure to heat during the journey. Neill reached Allahabad on the\r\nafternoon of the 11th. He found the fort almost completely invested; the\r\nbridge of boats over the Ganges in the hands of a mob, and partly\r\nbroken; and the neighbouring villages swarming with insurgents. By\r\ncautious manœuvring at the end of the Benares road, he succeeded in\r\nobtaining boats which conveyed him and his handful of men over to the\r\nfort. He at once assumed command, and arranged that on the following\r\nmorning the enemy should be driven out of the villages, and the bridge\r\nof boats recaptured. Accordingly, on the morning of the 12th he opened\r\nfire with several round-shot, and then attacked the rebels in the\r\nvillage of Deeragunge with a detachment of Fusiliers and Sikhs: this was\r\neffectively accomplished, and a safe road opened for the approach of\r\nMajor Stephenson’s detachment on the evening of that day. On the 13th\r\nthe insurgents were driven out of the village of Kydgunge. Neill had now\r\na strange enemy to combat within the fort itself—drunkenness and relaxed\r\ndiscipline. The Sikhs, during their sallies into the city before his\r\narrival, had gained entrance into some of the deserted warehouses of\r\nwine-merchants and others in the town, had brought away large quantities\r\nof beverage, and had sold these to the European soldiers within the\r\nfort—at four _annas_ (sixpence) per bottle for wine, spirits, or beer\r\nindiscriminately; drunkenness and disorganisation followed, requiring\r\ndetermined measures on the part of the commandant. He bought all the\r\nremaining liquors obtainable, for commissariat use; and kept a watchful\r\neye on the stores still remaining in the warehouses in the town. Neill\r\nsaw reason for distrusting the Sikhs; they had remained faithful up to\r\nthat time, but nevertheless exhibited symptoms which required attention.\r\nAs soon as possible, he got them out of the fort altogether, and placed\r\nthem at various posts in the city where they might still render service\r\nif they chose to remain faithful. His opinion of the native troops was\r\nsufficiently expressed in this passage in one of his dispatches: ‘I felt\r\nthat Allahabad was really safe when every native soldier and sentry was\r\nout of the fort; and as long as I command I shall not allow one to be on\r\nduty in it.’ Nothing can be more striking than the difference of views\r\nheld by Indian officers on this point; some distrusted the natives from\r\nthe first, while others maintained faith in them to a very disastrous\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Neill obtained the upper-hand in Allahabad, he was\r\nincessantly engaged in chastising the insurgents in the neighbourhood.\r\nHe sent a steamer up the Jumna on the 15th, with a howitzer under\r\nCaptain Harward, and twenty fusiliers under Lieutenant Arnold; and these\r\nworked much execution among the rebels on the banks. A combined body of\r\nfusiliers, Sikhs, and irregular cavalry made an attack on the villages\r\nof Kydgunge and Mootingunge, on the banks of the Jumna, driving out the\r\ninsurgents harboured there, and mowing them down in considerable\r\nnumbers. On subsequent days, wherever Neill heard of the presence of\r\ninsurgents in any of the surrounding villages, he at once attacked them;\r\nand great terror seized the hearts of the malcontents in the city at the\r\ncelerity with which guns and gibbets were set to work. On the 18th he\r\nsent eighty fusiliers and a hundred Sikhs up the river in a steamer, to\r\ndestroy the Patan village of Durriabad, and the Meewattie villages of\r\nSydabad and Russelpore. It was not merely in the villages that these\r\nactive operations were necessary; a large number of the mutinous sepoys\r\nwent off towards Delhi on the day after the outbreak, leaving the\r\nself-elected chief to manage his rabble-army as he liked; and it was\r\nagainst this rabble that many of the expeditions were planned. The city\r\nsuffered terribly from this double infliction; for after the spoliation\r\nand burning effected by the marauders, the English employed cannon-balls\r\nand musketry to drive those marauders out of the streets and houses; and\r\nAllahabad thus became little other than a mass of blackened ruins.\r\nColonel Neill organised a body of irregular cavalry by joining Captain\r\nPalliser’s detachment of the 13th irregulars with the few men of Captain\r\nAlexander’s corps still remaining true to their salt. A force of about a\r\nhundred and sixty Madras Fusiliers started from Benares on the 13th,\r\nunder Captain Fraser; he was joined on the road by Captain Palliser’s\r\ndetachment of troopers, just adverted to, of about eighty men, and the\r\ntwo officers then proceeded towards Allahabad. They found the road\r\nalmost wholly in the hands of rebels and plunderers; but by fighting,\r\nhanging, and burning, they cleared a path for themselves, struck terror\r\ninto the evildoers, and recovered much of the Company’s treasure that\r\nhad fallen into hostile hands. It is sad to read of six villages being\r\nreduced to ashes during this one march; but stringent measures were\r\nabsolutely necessary to a restoration of order and obedience. Fraser and\r\nPalliser reached Allahabad on the 18th, and their arrival enabled Neill\r\nto prosecute two objects which he had at heart—the securing of\r\nAllahabad, and the gradual collection of a force that might march to the\r\nrelief of poor Sir Hugh Wheeler and the other beleaguered Europeans at\r\nCawnpore. During these varied operations, the officers and men were\r\noften exposed during the daytime to a heat so tremendous that nothing\r\nbut an intense interest in their work could have kept them up. ‘If I can\r\nkeep from fever,’ wrote one of them, ‘I shan’t care; for excitement\r\nenables one to stand the sun and fatigue wonderfully. At any other time\r\nthe sun would have knocked us down like dogs; but all this month we have\r\nbeen out in the middle of the day, toiling like coolies, yet I have\r\nnever been better in my life—such an appetite!’ To meet temporary\r\nexigencies, the church, the government offices, the barracks, the\r\nbungalows—all were placed at the disposal of the English troops, as fast\r\nas they arrived up from Calcutta. These reinforcements, during the\r\nsecond half of the month, consisted chiefly of detachments of her\r\nMajesty’s 64th, 78th, and 84th foot. The peaceful inhabitants began to\r\nreturn to the half-ruined city, shattered houses were hastily rebuilt or\r\nrepaired, trade gradually revived, bullocks and carriages arrived in\r\nconsiderable number, supplies were laid in, the weather became cooler,\r\nthe cholera abated, and Colonel Neill found himself enabled to look\r\nforward with much confidence to the future. The fort, during almost the\r\nwhole of the month, had been very much crowded, insomuch that the\r\ninmates suffered greatly from heat and cholera. Two steam-boat loads of\r\nwomen and children were therefore sent down the river towards Calcutta;\r\nand all the non-combatants left the fort, to reoccupy such of their\r\nresidences as had escaped demolition. Some of the European soldiers were\r\ntented on the glacis; others took up quarters in a tope of trees near\r\nthe dâk-bungalow; lastly, a hospital was fitted up for the cholera\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nWith the end of June came tranquillity both to Benares and to Allahabad,\r\nchiefly through the determined measures adopted by Colonel Neill; and\r\nthen he planned an expedition, the best in his power, for Cawnpore—the\r\nfortunes of which will come under our notice in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  _The Oude Royal Family._—When the news reached England that the\r\n  deposed King of Oude had been arrested at Calcutta, in the way\r\n  described in the present chapter, on suspicion of complicity with\r\n  the mutineers, his relations, who had proceeded to London to appeal\r\n  against the annexation of Oude by the Company, prepared a petition\r\n  filled with protestations of innocence, on his part and on their\r\n  own. The petition was presented to the House of Lords by Lord\r\n  Campbell, though not formally received owing to some defect in\r\n  phraseology. A memorial to Queen Victoria was couched in similar\r\n  form. The petition and memorial ran as follows:\r\n\r\n  ‘The petition of the undersigned Jenabi Auliah Tajara Begum, the\r\n  Queen-mother of Oude; Mirza Mohummud Hamid Allie, eldest son and\r\n  heir-apparent of his Majesty the King of Oude; and Mirra Mohummud\r\n  Jowaad Allie Sekunder Hushmut Bahadoor, next brother of his Majesty\r\n  the King of Oude, sheweth:\r\n\r\n  ‘That your petitioners have heard with sincere regret the tidings\r\n  which have reached the British kingdom of disaffection prevailing\r\n  among the native troops in India; and that they desire, at the\r\n  earliest opportunity, to give public expression to that solemn\r\n  assurance which they some time since conveyed to her Majesty’s\r\n  government, that the fidelity and attachment to Great Britain which\r\n  has ever characterised the royal family of Oude continues unchanged\r\n  and unaffected by these deplorable events, and that they remain, as\r\n  Lord Dalhousie, the late governor-general of India, emphatically\r\n  declared them, “a royal race, ever faithful and true to their\r\n  friendship with the British nation.”\r\n\r\n  ‘That in the midst of this great public calamity, your petitioners\r\n  have sustained their own peculiar cause of pain and sorrow in the\r\n  intelligence which has reached them, through the public papers, that\r\n  his Majesty the King of Oude has been subjected to restraint at\r\n  Calcutta, and deprived of the means of communicating even with your\r\n  petitioners, his mother, son, and brother.\r\n\r\n  ‘That your petitioners desire unequivocally and solemnly to assure\r\n  her Majesty and your lordships, that if his Majesty the King of Oude\r\n  has been suspected of any complicity in the recent disastrous\r\n  occurrences, such suspicion is not only wholly and absolutely\r\n  unfounded, but is directed against one, the whole tenor of whose\r\n  life, character, and conduct directly negatives all such\r\n  imputations. Your petitioners recall to the recollection of your\r\n  lordships the facts relating to the dethronement of the King of\r\n  Oude, as set forth in the petition presented to the House of Commons\r\n  by Sir Fitzroy Kelly on the 25th of May last, that when resistance\r\n  might have been made, and was even anticipated by the British\r\n  general, the King of Oude directed his guards and troops to lay\r\n  aside their arms, and that when it was announced to him that the\r\n  territories of Oude were to be vested for ever in the Honourable\r\n  East India Company, the king, instead of offering resistance to the\r\n  British government, after giving vent to his feelings in a burst of\r\n  grief, descended from his throne, declaring his determination to\r\n  seek for justice at her Majesty’s throne, and from the parliament of\r\n  England.\r\n\r\n  ‘That since their resort to this country, in obedience to his\r\n  Majesty’s commands, your petitioners have received communications\r\n  from his Majesty which set forth the hopes and aspirations of his\r\n  heart; that those communications not only negative all supposition\r\n  of his Majesty’s personal complicity in any intrigues, but fill the\r\n  minds of your petitioners with the profound conviction that his\r\n  Majesty would feel, with your petitioners, the greatest grief and\r\n  pain at the events which have occurred. And your petitioners desire\r\n  to declare to your lordships, and to assure the British nation, that\r\n  although suffering, in common with his heart-broken family, from the\r\n  wrongs inflicted on them, from the humiliations of a state of exile,\r\n  and their loss of home, authority, and country, the King of Oude\r\n  relies only on the justice of his cause, appeals only to her\r\n  Majesty’s throne and to the parliament of Great Britain, and\r\n  disdains to use the arm of the rebel and the traitor to maintain the\r\n  right he seeks to vindicate.\r\n\r\n  ‘Your petitioners therefore pray of your lordships that, in the\r\n  exercise of your authority, you will cause justice to be done to his\r\n  Majesty the King of Oude, and that it may be forthwith explicitly\r\n  made known to his Majesty and to your petitioners wherewith he is\r\n  charged, and by whom, and on what authority, so that the King of\r\n  Oude may have full opportunity of refuting and disproving the unjust\r\n  suspicions and calumnies of which he is now the helpless victim. And\r\n  your petitioners further pray that the King of Oude may be permitted\r\n  freely to correspond with your petitioners in this country, so that\r\n  they may also have opportunity of vindicating here the character and\r\n  conduct of their sovereign and relative, of establishing his\r\n  innocence of any offence against the crown of England, or the\r\n  British government or people, and of shewing that, under every\r\n  varying phase of circumstance, the royal family of Oude have\r\n  continued steadfast and true to their friendship with the British\r\n  nation.\r\n\r\n  ‘And your petitioners will ever pray, &c.’\r\n\r\n  Some time after the presentation of this petition and memorial, a\r\n  curious proof was afforded of the complexity and intrigue connected\r\n  with the family affairs of the princes of India. A statement having\r\n  gone abroad to the effect that a son of the King of Oude had escaped\r\n  from Lucknow during the troubles of the Revolt, a native\r\n  representative of the family in London sought to set the public mind\r\n  right on the matter. He stated that the king had had only three\r\n  legitimate sons; that one of these, being an idiot, was confined to\r\n  the zenana or harem at Lucknow; that the second died of small-pox\r\n  when twelve years of age; that the third was the prince who had come\r\n  to London with the queen-mother; and that if any son of the king had\r\n  really escaped from Lucknow, he must have been illegitimate, a boy\r\n  about ten years old. This communication was signed by Mahmoud\r\n  Museehooddeen, residing at Paddington, and designating himself\r\n  ‘Accredited Agent to his Majesty the King of Oude.’ Two days\r\n  afterwards the same journal contained a letter from Colonel R.\r\n  Ouseley, also residing in the metropolis, asserting that _he_ was\r\n  ‘Agent in Chief to the King of Oude,’ and that Museehooddeen had\r\n  assumed a title to which he had no right.\r\n\r\n  _Castes and Creeds in the Indian Army_.—The Indian officers being\r\n  much divided in opinion concerning the relative insubordination of\r\n  Mohammedans and Hindoos in the native regiments, it may be useful to\r\n  record here the actual components of one Bengal infantry regiment,\r\n  so far as concerns creed and caste.

I had them in irons in a crack,\r\n  held a drumhead court-martial, convicted, and sentenced them to be\r\n  hanged the next morning. I took on my own shoulders the responsibility\r\n  of hanging them first, and asking leave to do so afterwards. That day\r\n  was an awful one of suspense and anxiety. One of the prisoners was of\r\n  very high caste and influence, and this man I determined to treat with\r\n  the greatest ignominy, by getting the lowest caste man to hang him. To\r\n  tell you the truth, I never for a moment expected to leave the hanging\r\n  scene alive; but I was determined to do my duty, and well knew the\r\n  effect that pluck and decision had on the natives. The regiment was\r\n  drawn out; wounded cruelly as I was, I had to see everything done\r\n  myself, even to the adjusting of the ropes, and saw them looped to run\r\n  easy. Two of the culprits were paralysed with fear and astonishment,\r\n  never dreaming that I should dare to hang them without an order from\r\n  government. The third said he would not be hanged, and called on the\r\n  Prophet and on his comrades to rescue him. This was an awful moment;\r\n  an instant’s hesitation on my part, and probably I should have had a\r\n  dozen of balls through me; so I seized a pistol, clapped it to the\r\n  man’s ear, and said, with a look there was no mistake about: “Another\r\n  word out of your mouth, and your brains shall be scattered on the\r\n  ground.” He trembled, and held his tongue. The elephant came up, he\r\n  was put on his back, the rope adjusted, the elephant moved, and he was\r\n  left dangling. I then had the others up, and off in the same way. And\r\n  after some time, when I had dismissed the men of the regiment to their\r\n  lines, and still found my head on my shoulders, I really could\r\n  scarcely believe it.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Dinapoor is remarkable for the fine barracks built by the Company for\r\n  the accommodation of troops—for the officers, the European troops, and\r\n  the native troops; most of the officers have commodious bungalows in\r\n  the vicinity; and the markets or bazaars, for the supply of Europeans\r\n  as well as natives, are unusually large and well supplied.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  ‘At present the men of bad character in some regiments, and other\r\n  people in the direction of Meerut and Delhi, have turned from their\r\n  allegiance to the bountiful government, and created a seditious\r\n  disturbance, and have made choice of the ways of ingratitude, and\r\n  thrown away the character of sepoys true to their salt.\r\n\r\n  ‘At present it is well known that some European regiments have started\r\n  to punish and coerce these rebels; we trust that by the favour of the\r\n  bountiful government, we also may be sent to punish the enemies of\r\n  government, wherever they are; for if we cannot be of use to\r\n  government at this time, how will it be manifest and known to the\r\n  state that we are true to our salt?

They were aware, it is true,\r\nthat Oude had long furnished the chief materials for the Bengal native\r\narmy; but they could not have anticipated, or at least did not, how\r\nclose would be the sympathy between those troops and the Oude irregulars\r\nin the hour of tumult. Only seven months before the beginning of the\r\nRevolt, and about the same space of time after the formal annexation, a\r\nremarkable article on Indian Army Reform appeared in the _Calcutta\r\nReview_, attributed to Sir Henry Lawrence; in which he commented freely\r\non the government proceedings connected with the army of Oude. He\r\npointed out how great was the number of daring reckless men in that\r\ncountry; how large had been the army of the king before his deposition;\r\nhow numerous were the small forts held by zemindars and petty\r\nchieftains, and guarded by nearly sixty thousand men; how perilous it\r\nwas to raise a new British-Oudian army, even though a small one, solely\r\nfrom the men of the king’s disbanded regiments; how serious was the fact\r\nthat nearly a hundred thousand disbanded warlike natives were left\r\nwithout employment; how prudent it would have been to send Oudians into\r\nthe Punjaub, and Punjaubees into Oude; and how necessary was an increase\r\nin the number of British troops. The truth of these comments was not\r\nappreciated until Sir Henry himself was ranked among those who felt the\r\nfull consequence of the state of things to which the comments referred.\r\nOude was full of zemindars, possessing considerable resources of various\r\nkinds, having their retainers, their mud-forts, their arsenals, their\r\ntreasures. These zemindars, aggrieved not so much by the annexation of\r\ntheir country, as by the manner in which territorial law-proceedings\r\nwere made to affect the tenure of their estates, shewed sympathy with\r\nthe mutineers almost from the first. The remarks of Mr Edwards,\r\ncollector at Boodayoun, on this point, have already been adverted to (p.\r\n115). The zemindars did not, as a class, display the sanguinary and\r\nvindictive passions so terribly evident in the reckless soldiery; still\r\nthey held to a belief that a successful revolt might restore to them\r\ntheir former position and influence as landowners; and hence the\r\nformidable difficulties opposed by them to the military movements of the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Lawrence, as chief authority both military and civil in Oude,\r\nfound himself very awkwardly imperiled at Lucknow in the early days of\r\nJune. Just as the previous month closed, nearly all the native troops\r\nraised the standard of rebellion (see p. 96); the 13th, 48th, and 71st\r\ninfantry, and the 7th cavalry, all betrayed the infection, though in\r\ndifferent degrees; and of the seven hundred men of those four regiments\r\nwho still remained faithful, he did not know how many he could trust\r\neven for a single day. The treasury received his anxious attention, and\r\nmisgivings arose in his mind concerning the various districts around the\r\ncapital, with their five millions of inhabitants. Soon he had the\r\nbitterness of learning that his rebellious troops, who had fled towards\r\nSeetapoor, had excited their brethren at that place to revolt. The\r\nCalcutta authorities were from that day very ill informed of the\r\nproceedings at Lucknow; for the telegraph wires were cut, and the\r\ninsurgents stopped all dâks and messengers on the road. About the middle\r\nof the month, Colonel Neill, at Allahabad, received a private letter\r\nfrom Lawrence, sent by some secret agency, announcing that Seetapoor and\r\nShahjehanpoor were in the hands of the rebels; that Secrora, Beraytch,\r\nand Fyzabad, were in like condition; and that mutinous regiments from\r\nall those places, as well as from Benares and Jounpoor, appeared to be\r\napproaching Lucknow on some combined plan of operations. He was\r\nstrengthening his position at the Residency, but looked most anxiously\r\nfor aid, which Neill was quite unable to afford him. Again, it became\r\nknown to the authorities at Benares that Lawrence, on the 19th, still\r\nheld his position at Lucknow; that he had had eight deaths by cholera;\r\nand that he was considering whether, aid from Cawnpore or Allahabad\r\nbeing unattainable, he could obtain a few reinforcements by steamer up\r\nthe Gogra from Dinapoor. Another letter, but without date, reached the\r\nchief-magistrate of Benares, to the effect that Lawrence had got rid of\r\nmost of the remaining native troops, by paying them their due, and\r\ngiving them leave of absence for three months; he evidently felt\r\ndisquietude at the presence even of the apparently faithful sepoys in\r\nhis place of refuge, so bitterly had he experienced the hollowness of\r\nall protestations on their part. He had been very ill, and a provisional\r\ncouncil had been appointed in case his health should further give way.\r\nAlthough the Residency was the stronghold, the city and cantonment also\r\nwere still under British control: a fort called the Muchee Bhowan, about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from the Residency, and consisting of a strong,\r\nturreted, castellated building, was held by two hundred and twenty-five\r\nEuropeans with three guns. The cantonment was northeast of the\r\nResidency, on the opposite side of the river, over which were two\r\nbridges of approach. Sir Henry had already lessened from eight to four\r\nthe number of buildings or posts where the troops were stationed—namely,\r\nthe Residency, the Muchee Bhowan, a strong post between these two, and\r\nthe dâk-bungalow between the Residency and the cantonment; but after the\r\nmutiny, he depended chiefly on the Residency and the Muchee Bhowan.\r\nNews, somewhat more definite in character, was conveyed in a letter\r\nwritten by Sir Henry on the 20th of June. So completely were the roads\r\nwatched, that he had not received a word of information from Cawnpore,\r\nAllahabad, Benares, or any other important place throughout the whole\r\nmonth down to that date; he knew not what progress was being made by the\r\nrebels, beyond the region of which Lucknow was more immediately the\r\ncentre; he still held the fort, city, Residency, and cantonment, but was\r\nterribly threatened on all sides by large bodies of mutineers. On the\r\n27th he wrote another letter to the authorities at Allahabad, one of the\r\nvery few (out of a large number despatched) that succeeded in reaching\r\ntheir destination. This letter was still full of heart, for he told of\r\nthe Residency and the Muchee Bhowan being still held by him in force; of\r\ncholera being on the decrease; of his supplies being adequate for two\r\nmonths and a half; and of his power to ‘hold his own.’ On the other\r\nhand, he felt assured that at that moment Lucknow was the only place\r\nthroughout the whole of Oude where British influence was paramount; and\r\nthat he dared not leave the city for twenty-four hours without danger of\r\nlosing all his advantages. His sanguine, hopeful spirit shone out in the\r\nmidst of all his trials; he declared that with one additional European\r\nregiment, and a hundred artillerymen, he could re-establish British\r\nsupremacy in Oude; and he added, in a sportive tone, which shewed what\r\nestimate he formed of some, at least, of the contingent corps, ‘a\r\nthousand Europeans, a thousand Goorkhas, and a thousand Sikhs, with\r\neight or ten guns, will thrash anything.’ The Sikhs were irregulars\r\nraised in the Punjaub; and throughout the contests arising out of the\r\nRevolt, their fidelity towards the government was seldom placed in\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe last day of June was a day of sad omen to the English in Lucknow. On\r\nthe evening of the 29th, information arrived that a rebel force of six\r\nor seven thousand men was encamped eight miles distant on the Fyzabad\r\nroad, near the Kookra Canal. Lawrence thereupon determined to attack\r\nthem on the following day. He started at six o’clock on the morning of\r\nthe 30th, with about seven hundred men and eleven guns.[23] Misled,\r\neither by accident or design, by informants on the road, he suddenly\r\nfell into an ambush of the enemy, assembled in considerable force near\r\nChinhut. Manfully struggling against superior numbers, Lawrence looked\r\nforward confidently to victory; but just at the most critical moment,\r\nthe Oude artillerymen proved traitors—overturning their six guns into\r\nditches, cutting the traces of the horses, and then going over to the\r\nenemy. Completely outflanked, exposed to a terrible fire on all sides,\r\nweakened by the defection, having now few guns to use, and being almost\r\nwithout ammunition, Sir Henry saw that retreat was imperative. A\r\ndisastrous retreat it was, or rather a complete rout; the heat was\r\nfearful, the confusion was dire; and the officers and men fell rapidly,\r\nto rise no more. Colonel Case, of H.M. 32d, receiving a mortal wound,\r\nwas immediately succeeded by Captain Steevens; he in like manner soon\r\nfell, and was succeeded by Captain Mansfield, who escaped the day’s\r\nperils, but afterwards died of cholera.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Lawrence now found himself in a grave difficulty. The English\r\nposition at Lucknow needed all the strengthening he could impart to it.\r\nHe had held, as already explained, not only the Residency, but the fort\r\nof Muchee Bhowan and other posts. The calamity of the 30th, however,\r\nhaving weakened him too much to garrison all, or even more than one, he\r\nremoved the troops, and then blew up the Muchee Bhowan, at midnight on\r\nthe 1st of July, sending 240 barrels of gunpowder and 3,000,000\r\nball-cartridges into the air. From that hour the whole of the English\r\nmade the Residency their stronghold. Later facts rendered it almost\r\ncertain that, if this abandonment and explosion had not taken place,\r\nscarcely a European would have lived to tell the tale of the subsequent\r\nmiseries at Lucknow. By incessant exertions, he collected in the\r\nResidency six months’ food for a thousand persons. The last hour of the\r\ngallant man was, however, approaching. A shell, sent by the insurgents,\r\npenetrated into his room on this day; his officers advised him to remove\r\nto another spot, but he declined the advice; and on the next day, the 2d\r\nof July, another shell, entering and bursting within the same room, gave\r\nhim a mortal wound. Knowing his last hour was approaching, Sir Henry\r\nappointed Brigadier Inglis his successor in military matters, and Major\r\nBanks his successor as chief-commissioner of Oude.\r\n\r\nGrief, deep and earnest, took possession of every breast in the\r\nResidency, when, on the 4th of July, it was announced that the good and\r\ngreat Sir Henry Lawrence had breathed his last. He was a man of whom no\r\none doubted; like his gifted brother, Sir John, he had the rare power of\r\ndrawing to himself the respect and love of those by whom he was\r\nsurrounded, almost without exception. ‘Few men,’ said Brigadier Inglis,\r\nat a later date, ‘have ever possessed to the same extent the power which\r\nhe enjoyed of winning the hearts of all those with whom he came in\r\ncontact, and thus insuring the warmest and most zealous devotion for\r\nhimself and the government which he served. All ranks possessed such\r\nconfidence in his judgment and his fertility of resource, that the news\r\nof his fall was received throughout the garrison with feelings of\r\nconsternation only second to the grief which was inspired in the hearts\r\nof all by the loss of a public benefactor and a warm personal friend....\r\nI trust the government of India will pardon me for having attempted,\r\nhowever imperfectly, to portray this great and good man. In him every\r\ngood and deserving soldier lost a friend and a chief capable of\r\ndiscriminating, and ever on the alert to reward merit, no matter how\r\nhumble the sphere in which it was exhibited.’ Such was the soldier whom\r\nall men delighted to honour,[24] and to whom the graceful compliment was\r\nonce paid, that ‘Sir Henry Lawrence enjoyed the rare felicity of\r\ntranscending all rivalry except that of his illustrious brother.’\r\n\r\nHow the overcrowded Residency at Lucknow bore all the attacks directed\r\nagainst it; how the inmates, under the brave and energetic Inglis, held\r\non against heat, disease, cannon-balls, thirst, hunger, and fatigue; how\r\nand by whom they were liberated—will come for notice in proper course.\r\n\r\nThe other districts of Oude fell one by one into the hands of the\r\ninsurgents. The narratives subsequently given by such English officers\r\nas were fortunate enough to escape the perils of those evil days, bore a\r\ngeneral resemblance one to another; inasmuch as they told of faith in\r\nnative troops being rudely broken, irresolute loyalty dissolving into\r\nconfirmed hostility, treasuries of Company’s rupees tempting those who\r\nmight otherwise possibly have been true to their salt, military officers\r\nand their wives obliged to flee for succour to Nynee Tal or some other\r\npeaceful station, the families of civilians suddenly thrown homeless\r\nupon the world, and blood and plunder marking the footsteps of the\r\nmarauders who followed the example set by the rebellious sepoys and\r\ntroopers. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the general\r\ncharacter of these outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny at Fyzabad, besides being attended with a sad loss of life,\r\nwas note-worthy for certain peculiarities in the tactics of the\r\ninsurgents—a kind of cool audacity not always exhibited in other\r\ninstances. A brief description will shew the position and character of\r\nthis city. In a former chapter (p. 83) it was explained that Oude or\r\nAyodha, the city that gave name to the province, is very ancient as a\r\nHindoo capital, but has become poor and ruinous in recent times; and\r\nthat the fragments of many of its old structures were employed in\r\nbuilding Fyzabad, the Mohammedan Ayodha, nearly adjoining it on the\r\nsouthwest. It was scarcely more than a hundred and thirty years ago that\r\nthe foundation of Fyzabad was established, by Saadut Ali Khan, the first\r\nnawab-vizier of Oude; its advance in prosperity was rapid; but since the\r\nselection of Lucknow as the capital in 1775, Fyzabad has fallen in\r\ndignity; the chief merchants and bankers have migrated to Lucknow, and\r\nthe remaining inhabitants are mostly poor.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of June, rumours circulated in Fyzabad that the mutinous 17th\r\nregiment B. N. I. was approaching from Azimghur. Colonel Lennox, the\r\nmilitary commandant, at once conferred with the other officers, and\r\nformed a plan for defending the place. The immediate alarm died away. On\r\nthe 7th, however, renewed information led the colonel to propose an\r\nadvance to Surooj-khoond, a place about five miles away, to repel the\r\nmutineers before they could reach Fyzabad. The native troops objected to\r\ngo out, on the plea of disinclination to leave their families and\r\nproperty behind; but they promised to fight valiantly in the cantonment\r\nif necessary, and many of them shook hands with him in token of\r\nfidelity. The evening of the 8th revealed the hypocrisy of this display.\r\nThe native troops, cavalry, infantry, and artillery, joined in a\r\ndemonstration which rendered all the officers powerless; every officer\r\nwas, in effect, made a prisoner, and placed under armed guard for the\r\nnight; two tried to escape, but were fired at and brought back. The\r\nleader of the mutiny, Dhuleep Singh, subadar-major of the 22d regiment,\r\ncame to Colonel Lennox in the morning, and told him plainly that he and\r\nthe other officers must yield to the course of circumstances; that boats\r\nwould be provided to take them down the river Gogra towards Dinapoor,\r\nbut that he would not guarantee their safety after once they had\r\nembarked. There was a cool impudence about the proceeding, unlike the\r\nwild confusion exhibited at many of the scenes of outbreak. A moulvie,\r\nwho had been imprisoned in the quarter-guard for a disturbance created\r\nin the city, and who had just been liberated by the mutineers, sent the\r\nsub-assistant surgeon to Colonel Lennox with a message; thanking him for\r\nkindnesses received during the imprisonment, and requesting that the\r\ncolonel’s full-dress regimentals might be sent to the moulvie. The\r\nnative surgeon begged pardon for his change of allegiance; urging that\r\ntimes were altered, and that he must now obey the mutineers. There was\r\nsomething more than mere effrontery, however, in the proceedings of\r\nthese insurgents;[25] there was a subordination amid insubordination.\r\n‘The men,’ said one of the narrators, ‘guarded their officers and their\r\nbungalows after mutinying, placed sentries over the magazines and all\r\npublic property, and sent out pickets to prevent the towns-people and\r\nservants from looting. They held a council of war, in which the cavalry\r\nproposed to kill the officers; but the 22d, objecting to this, informed\r\ntheir officers that they would be allowed to leave, and might take with\r\nthem their private arms and property, but no public property—as that all\r\nbelonged to the King of Oude.’\r\n\r\nLet us briefly trace the course of some of the European fugitives.\r\nColonel Lennox, powerless to resist, gave up his regimentals, and\r\nprepared for a melancholy boat-departure with his wife and daughter.\r\nThey were escorted to the banks of the Gogra, and pushed off on their\r\nvoyage. From two in the afternoon on the 8th of June, until nearly\r\nmidnight, their boat descended the stream—often in peril from sentries\r\nand scouts on shore, but befriended by two sepoys who had been sent to\r\nprotect them for a short distance. Much care and manœuvring were\r\nrequired to effect a safe passage near the spot where the mutinous 17th\r\nregiment was encamped; for it now became manifest that the 22d had in\r\neffect sold the fugitives to the other corps. Early on the following\r\nmorning, information received on shore rendering evident the danger of a\r\nfurther boat-voyage, the houseless wanderers, leaving in the boat the\r\nfew fragments of property they had brought away from Fyzabad, set out on\r\nfoot towards Goruckpore. With nothing but the clothes on their backs,\r\nthe family began their weary flight. After stopping under trees and by\r\nthe side of wells to rest occasionally, they walked until the heat of\r\nday rendered necessary a longer pause. By a narrow chance they avoided\r\nbeing dragged to the camp of the 17th regiment, by a trooper who\r\nprofessed to have been offered two hundred rupees for the head of each\r\nmember of the family. A friendly chieftain, one Meer Mohammed Hossein\r\nKhan, came to their rescue just at the moment of greatest peril. One of\r\nthe retainers of this man, however, more disposed for enmity than amity,\r\nspoke to the colonel with great bitterness and fierceness of manner,\r\nshewing that the prevalent rumours had made a deep impression in Oude;\r\nhe expressed a longing to shoot the English, ‘who had come to take away\r\ntheir caste, and make them Christians.’ Meer Mohammed rebuked this man\r\nfor saying that a stable would do to shelter the refugees, for that he\r\nwas prepared ‘to kill them like dogs.’ The fugitives were taken to a\r\nsmall fort, one of the numerous class lately adverted to, where the\r\nzemindars and petty chieftains maintained a kind of feudal or clannish\r\nindependence. On the second day, the danger to sheltered Europeans\r\nbecoming apparent, Colonel Lennox, his wife, and daughter, put on native\r\ndresses, and remained nine days concealed in a reed-hut behind the\r\nzenana, treated very kindly and considerately by their protector. Meer\r\nMohammed went once or twice to Fyzabad, to learn if possible the plans\r\nof the mutineers; he was told that they meant to attack Lucknow, and\r\nthen depart for Delhi. On the 10th day of the hiding, when news arrived\r\nthat the fort was likely to be attacked, the ladies went for shelter\r\ninto the zenana, while the colonel was hid in a dark woodshed. Happily,\r\nhowever, it turned out that the suspected strangers were a party sent by\r\nthe collector of Goruckpore for the rescue of the family. Danger was now\r\nnearly over. The fugitives reached Amorah, Bustee, Goruckpore, Azimghur,\r\nand Ghazeepore, at which place they took steamer down to Calcutta. This\r\nfortunate escape from great peril was almost wholly due to ‘the noble\r\nand considerate’ Meer Mohammed, as Colonel Lennox very properly\r\ncharacterises him.\r\n\r\nFar more calamitous were the boat-adventures of the main body of Fyzabad\r\nofficers, of which an account was afterwards written, for the\r\ninformation of government, by Farrier-sergeant Busher, of the light\r\nfield-battery. On the morning of the 8th, the wives and families of many\r\ncivilians, and of five non-commissioned European officers, had been sent\r\nby Captain Orr to a place called Sheergunge, under the protection of a\r\nfriendly native, Rajah Maun Singh, to be free from peril if tumult\r\nshould arise. Early on the 9th, while Colonel Lennox was still at the\r\nstation, all or nearly all the other English were sent off by the\r\nmutineers in four boats. One of these boats (mere dinghees, in which\r\nlittle more than a bundle for each person could be put) contained eight\r\npersons, one six, one five, and the remaining boat three. Only one\r\nfemale was of the party, Mrs Hollum, wife of Sergeant-major Hollum of\r\nthe 22d native regiment. The first and second boats got ahead of the\r\nother two, and proceeded about twenty miles down the river without\r\nmolestation; but then were seen troopers and sepoys approaching the\r\nbanks, with an evidently hostile intent. The firing soon became so\r\nsevere that the occupants of the first boat struck in for the off-shore,\r\nand seven of them took to their heels—the eighth being unequal to that\r\nphysical exertion. They ran on till checked by a broad stream; and while\r\ndeliberating how to cross, persons approached who were thought to be\r\nsepoys; the alarm proved false, but not before Lieutenants Currie and\r\nParsons had been drowned in an attempt to escape by swimming. The other\r\nfive, running on till quite exhausted, were fortunate enough to meet\r\nwith a friendly native, who sheltered them for several hours, and\r\nsupplied them with food. At midnight they started again, taking the road\r\nto Amorah, which they were enabled to reach safely through the influence\r\nof their kind protector—although once in great peril from a gang of\r\nfreebooters. They were glad to meet at Amorah the three occupants of the\r\nfourth boat, who, like themselves, had escaped the dangers of the voyage\r\nby running across fields and fording streams. At seven in the morning of\r\nthe 10th, the fugitives, now eight in company, recommenced their anxious\r\nflight—aided occasionally by friendly natives, but at length betrayed by\r\none whose friendship was only a mask. They had to cross a nullah or\r\nstream knee-deep, under pursuit by a body of armed men; here Lieutenant\r\nLindesay fell, literally cut to pieces; and when the other seven had\r\npassed to the opposite bank, five were speedily hewn to the ground and\r\nbutchered—Lieutenants Ritchie, Thomas, and English, and two English\r\nsergeants. The two survivors ran at their topmost speed, pursued by a\r\ngang of ruffians; Lieutenant Cautley was speedily overtaken, and killed;\r\nand then only Sergeant Busher remained alive. He, outrunning his\r\npursuers, reached a Brahmin village, where a bowl of sherbet was given\r\nto him. After a little rest, he ran on again, until one Baboo Bully\r\nSingh was found to be on the scent after him; he endeavoured to hide\r\nunder some straw in a hut; but was discovered and dragged out by the\r\nhair of the head. From village to village he was then carried as an\r\nexhibition to be jeered and scoffed at by the rabble; the Baboo\r\nevidently intended the cruel sport to be followed by murder; but this\r\nintention underwent a change, probably from dread of some future\r\nretribution. He kept his prisoner near him for ten days, but did not\r\nfurther ill treat him. On the eleventh day, Busher was liberated; he\r\novertook Colonel Lennox and his family; and safely reached Ghazeepore\r\nseventeen days after his departure from Fyzabad. The boat containing\r\nColonel O’Brien, Lieutenants Percival and Gordon, Ensign Anderson, and\r\nAssistant-surgeon Collinson, pursued its voyage the whole way down to\r\nDinapoor; but it was a voyage full of vicissitudes to the fugitives. At\r\nmany places they were obliged to lie flat in the boat to prevent\r\nrecognition from the shore; at others they had to compel the native\r\nboatmen, on peril of sabring, to continue their tugging at the oars; on\r\none occasion they narrowly escaped shooting by a herd of villagers who\r\nfollowed the boat. For three days they had nothing to eat but a little\r\nflour and water; but happening to meet with a friendly rajah at Gola,\r\nthey obtained aid which enabled them to reach Dinapoor on the 17th.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the remaining boat, the civilians, and the ladies and\r\nchildren who had not been able to effect a safe retreat to Nynee Tal,\r\nsuffered terribly; many lives were lost; and those who escaped to\r\nGoruckpore or Dinapoor arrived in distressing plight—especially a party\r\nof women and children who had been robbed of everything while on the\r\nway, and who had been almost starved to death during a week’s\r\nimprisonment in a fort by the river-side. When it is stated that, among\r\na group of women and children who reached a place of safety after\r\ninfinite hardships, _an infant was born on the road_, the reader will\r\neasily comprehend how far the sufferings must have exceeded anything\r\nlikely to appear in print. Many persons were shot, many drowned, while\r\nthe fate of others remained doubtful for weeks or even months. Colonel\r\nGoldney and Major Mill were among the slain. The wanderings of Mrs Mill\r\nand her three children were perhaps among the most affecting incidents\r\nof this mutiny. Amid the dire haste of departure, she became separated\r\nfrom her husband, and was the last Englishwoman left in Fyzabad. How she\r\nescaped and how she fared, was more than she herself could clearly\r\nnarrate; for the whole appeared afterwards as a dreadful dream, in which\r\nevery kind of misery was confusedly mixed. During two or three weeks,\r\nshe was wandering up and down the country, living in the jungle when man\r\nrefused her shelter, and searching the fields for food when none was\r\nobtainable elsewhere. Her poor infant, eight months old, died for want\r\nof its proper nourishment; but the other two children, seven and three\r\nyears old, survived all the privations to which they were exposed. On\r\none occasion, seeing some troopers approaching, and being utterly\r\nhopeless, she passionately besought them, if their intentions were\r\nhostile, to kill her children without torturing them, and then to kill\r\nher. The appeal touched the hearts of the rude men; they took her to a\r\nvillage and gave her a little succour; and this facilitated their\r\nconveyance by a friendly native to Goruckpore, where danger was over.\r\n\r\nSultanpore was another station at which mutiny and murder occurred. On\r\nthe 8th of June, a wing of the 15th irregular cavalry entered that place\r\nfrom Seetapoor, in a state of evident excitement. Lieutenant Tucker, who\r\nwas a favourite with them, endeavoured to allay their mutinous spirit,\r\nand succeeded for a few hours; but on the following morning they rose in\r\ntumult, murdered Colonel Fisher, Captain Gubbings, and two other\r\nEuropeans, and urged the lieutenant to escape, which he did. After much\r\njungle-wanderings, and concealment in a friendly native’s house, he\r\nsafely arrived at Benares, as did likewise four or five other officers,\r\nand all the European women and children at the station. In this as in\r\nother instances, the revolt of the troops was followed by marauding and\r\nincendiarism on the part of the rabble of Sultanpore; in this, too, as\r\nin other instances, the mutineers had a little affection for some one or\r\nmore among their officers, whom they endeavoured to save.\r\n\r\nThe station of Pershadeepore experienced its day of trouble on the 10th\r\nof June. The 1st regiment Oude irregular infantry was there stationed,\r\nunder Captain Thompson. He prided himself on the fidelity of his men;\r\ninasmuch as they seemed to turn a deaf ear to the rumours and suspicions\r\ncirculating elsewhere; and he had detected the falsity of a\r\nmischief-maker, who had secretly caused ground bones to be mixed with\r\nthe attah (coarse flour with which chupatties are made) sold in the\r\nbazaar, as the foundation for a report that the government intended to\r\ntake away the caste of the people. This pleasant delusion lasted until\r\nthe 9th; when a troop of the 3d Oude irregular cavalry arrived from\r\nPertabghur, followed soon afterwards by news of the rising at\r\nSultanpore. The fidelity of the infantry now gave way, under the\r\ntemptations and representations made to them by other troops. When\r\nCaptain Thompson rose on the morning of the 10th, he found his regiment\r\nall dressed, and in orderly mutiny (if such an expression may be used).\r\nHe tried with an aching heart to separate the good men from the bad, and\r\nto induce the former to retire with him to Allahabad; but the temptation\r\nof the treasure was more than they could resist; they all joined in the\r\nspoliation, and then felt that allegiance was at an end. At four in the\r\nafternoon all the Europeans left the station, without a shot or an angry\r\nword from the men; they were escorted to the fort of Dharoopoor,\r\nbelonging to a chieftain named Rajah Hunnewaut Singh, who treated them\r\ncourteously, and after some days forwarded them safely to Allahabad.\r\nThere was not throughout India a mutiny conducted with more quietness on\r\nboth sides than this at Pershadeepore; the sepoys had evidently no angry\r\nfeeling towards their officers. Captain Thompson remained of opinion\r\nthat his men had been led away by rumours and insinuations brought by\r\nstragglers from other stations, to the effect that any Oude regiment\r\nwhich did _not_ mutiny would be in peril from those that had; and that,\r\neven under this fear, they would have remained faithful had there been\r\nno treasure to tempt their cupidity. It is curious to note Colonel\r\nNeill’s comment on this incident, in his official dispatch; his reliance\r\non the native troops was of the smallest possible amount; and in\r\nreference to the captain’s honest faith, he said: ‘This is absurd; they\r\nwere as deeply in the plot as the rest of the army; the only credit due\r\nto them is that they did not murder their officers.’\r\n\r\nSeetapoor, about fifty miles north of Lucknow, was the place towards\r\nwhich the insurgent troops from that city bent their steps at the close\r\nof May. Whether those regiments kept together, and how far they\r\nproceeded on the next few days, are points not clearly made out; but it\r\nis certain that the native troops stationed at Seetapoor—comprising the\r\n41st Bengal infantry, the 9th and 10th Oude irregular infantry, and the\r\n2d Oude military police, in all about three thousand men—rose in mutiny\r\non the 3d of June. The 41st began the movement. A sepoy came to one of\r\nthe officers in the morning, announced that the rising was about to take\r\nplace, declared that neither he nor his companions wished to draw blood,\r\nand suggested that all the officers should retreat from the station. The\r\nregiment was in two wings, one in the town and one in the cantonment;\r\nthe plundering of the treasury was begun by the first-named party; the\r\nother wing, obedient at first, broke forth when they suspected they\r\nmight be deprived of a share in the plunder. After the 41st had thus set\r\nthe example, the 9th revolted; then the military police; and then the\r\n10th. Lieutenant Burnes, of the last-named regiment, entreated his men\r\nearnestly to remain faithful, but to no effect. Seeing that many\r\nofficers had been struck down, the remainder hastily retired to the\r\nhouse of Mr Christian the commissioner; and when all were assembled,\r\nwith the civilians, the ladies, and the children, it was at once\r\nresolved to quit the burning bungalows and ruthless soldiers and seek\r\nrefuge at Lucknow. Some made their exit without any preparation; among\r\nwhom was Lieutenant Burnes—roaming through jungles for days, and aiding\r\nwomen and children as best they could, suffering all those miseries\r\nwhich have so often been depicted. The great body of Europeans, however,\r\nleft the station in buggies and other vehicles; and as the high roads\r\nwere perilous, the fugitives drove over hills, hollows, and ploughed\r\nfields, where perhaps vehicles had never been driven before.\r\nFortunately, twenty troopers remained faithful to them, and escorted\r\nthem all the way to Lucknow, which place they reached on the night of\r\nthe third day—reft of everything they possessed, like many other\r\nfugitives in those days. Many of the Europeans did not succeed in\r\nquitting Seetapoor in time; and among these the work of death was\r\nruthlessly carried on—the sepoys being either unwilling or unable to\r\ncheck these scenes of barbarity.\r\n\r\nAs at Lucknow, Fyzabad, Sultanpore, Pershadeepore, Seetapoor; so at\r\nSecrora, Durriabad, Beraytch, Gouda, and other places in Oude—wherever\r\nthere was a native regiment stationed, or a treasury of the Company\r\nestablished, there, in almost every instance, were exhibited scenes of\r\nviolence attended by murder and plunder. The lamented Lawrence, in the\r\nfive weeks preceding his death, was, as has been lately pointed out,\r\nplaced in an extraordinary position. Responsible to the supreme\r\ngovernment both for the political and the military management of Oude,\r\nand knowing that almost every station in the province was a focus of\r\ntreachery and mutiny, he was notwithstanding powerless to restore\r\ntranquillity. So far from Cawnpore assisting him, he yearned to assist\r\nCawnpore; Rohilcund was in a blaze, and could send him only mutineers\r\nwho had thrown off all allegiance; Meerut, after sending troops to\r\nDelhi, was doing little but defending itself; Agra, with a mere handful\r\nof European troops, was too doubtful of its Gwalior neighbours to do\r\nanything for Lucknow and Oude; Allahabad and Benares were too recently\r\nrescued, by the gallant Neill, from imminent peril, to be in a position\r\nto send present assistance to Sir Henry; and the Nepaul sovereign, Jung\r\nBahadoor, had not yet been made an ally of the English in such a way as\r\nmight possibly have saved Oude, and as was advocated by many\r\nwell-wishers of India.\r\n\r\nThe position of the sovereignty just named may usefully be adverted to\r\nhere. Nepaul, about equal in area to England, is one of the few\r\nindependent states of Northern India; it reaches to the Himalaya on the\r\nnorth; and is bounded on the other sides by the British territories of\r\nBehar, Oude, and Kumaon. The region is distinguished by the magnificent\r\ngiant mountain-chain which separates it from Tibet; by the dense\r\nforest-jungle of the Terai on the Oude frontier; by the beautiful valley\r\nin which the capital, Khatmandoo, lies, and which is dotted with\r\nflourishing villages, luxuriant fields, and picturesque streams; and by\r\nits healthy and temperate climate. It is with the people, however, that\r\nthis narrative is more particularly concerned. The Nepaulese, about two\r\nmillions in number, comprise Goorkhas, Newars, Bhotias, Dhauwars, and\r\nMhaujees. The Goorkhas are the dominant race; they are Hindoos in\r\nreligion, but very unlike Hindoos in appearance, manners, and customs.\r\nThe Newars are the aborigines of Nepaul, decidedly Mongolian both in\r\nfaith and in features; they are the clever artisans of the kingdom,\r\nwhile the Goorkhas are the hardy soldiers. The other three tribes are\r\nchiefly cultivators of the soil. In the latter half of the last century,\r\nNepaul was for a short time a dependency of the Chinese Empire; but a\r\ntreaty of commerce with the British in 1782 initiated a state of affairs\r\nwhich soon enabled Nepaul to throw off Chinese supremacy. Conventions,\r\nsubsidies, border encroachments, and family intrigues, checkered\r\nNepaulese affairs until 1812; when the Company made formal war on the\r\nground of a long catalogue of injuries and insults—such a catalogue as\r\ncan easily be concocted by a stronger state against a weaker. The war\r\nwas so badly conducted, that nothing but the military tact of Sir David\r\nOchterlony, who held one-fourth of a command which seems to have had no\r\nhead or general commander, saved the British from ignominious defeat.\r\nBroken engagements led to another war in 1816, which terminated in a\r\ntreaty never since ruptured; the Nepaulese court has been a focus of\r\nintrigue, but the intrigues have not been of such a character as to\r\ndisturb the relations of amity with the British. Jung Bahadoor—a name\r\nwell known in England a few years ago, as that of a Nepaulese ambassador\r\nwho made a sensation by his jewelled splendor—was the nephew of a man\r\nwho became by successive steps prime minister to the king. Instigated by\r\nthe queen, and by his own unscrupulous ambition, Jung Bahadoor caused\r\nhis uncle to be put to death, and became commander-in-chief under a new\r\nministry. Many scenes of truly oriental slaughter followed—that is,\r\nslaughter to clear the pathway to power. Jung Bahadoor treated kings and\r\nqueens somewhat as the Company was accustomed to do in the last century;\r\nsetting up a son against a father, and treating all alike as puppets. At\r\na period subsequent to his return from England, he caused a marriage to\r\nbe concluded between his daughter, six years old, and the heir-apparent\r\nto the Nepaulese throne, then in his ninth year. Whether king or not, he\r\nwas virtually chief of Nepaul at the time when the Revolt broke out; and\r\nhad managed, by astuteness in his diplomacy, to remain on friendly terms\r\nwith the authorities at Calcutta: indeed he took every opportunity,\r\nafter his English visit, to display his leaning towards his neighbours.\r\nLike Nena Sahib, he had English pianos and English carpets in his house,\r\nand prided himself in understanding English manners and the English\r\nlanguage; and it is unquestionable that both those men were favourites\r\namong such of the English as visited the one at Bithoor or the other at\r\nKhatmandoo.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in a former chapter (p. 115) that Goorkha troops\r\nassisted to defend Nynee Tal when that place became filled with\r\nrefugees; and Goorkha regiments have been adverted to in many other\r\nparts of the narrative. Jung Bahadoor permitted the Nepaulese of this\r\ntribe to enlist thus in the Company’s service; and he also offered the\r\naid of a contingent, the non-employment of which brought many strictures\r\nupon the policy of the Calcutta government. At a later date, as we shall\r\nsee, this contingent was accepted; and it rendered us good service at\r\nJuanpore and Azimghur by protecting Benares from the advance of Oude\r\nmutineers. About the middle of June, fifteen Europeans (seven gentlemen,\r\nthree ladies, and five children) escaped from the Oude mutineers into\r\nthe jungle region of Nepaul, and sought refuge in a post-station or\r\nserai about ten days’ journey from Goruckpore and eighteen from\r\nKhatmandoo. The officer at that place wrote to Jung Bahadoor for\r\ninstruction in the matter; to which he received a speedy reply—‘Treat\r\nthem with every kindness, give them elephants, &c., and escort them to\r\nGoruckpore.’ Major Ramsey, the Company’s representative at Khatmandoo,\r\nsent them numerous supplies in tin cases; and all the English were\r\nnaturally disposed to bless the Nepaulese chieftain as a friend in the\r\nhour of greatest need, without inquiring very closely by what means he\r\nhad gained his power.\r\n\r\nThe course of the narrative now takes us from Oude northwestward into\r\nthe province of Rohilcund; the districts of which, named after the towns\r\nof Bareilly, Mooradabad, Shahjehanpoor, Boodayoun, and Bijnour, felt the\r\nfull force of the mutinous proceedings among the native troops. The\r\nRohillas were originally Mussulman Afghans, who conquered this part of\r\nIndia, gradually settled down among the Hindoo natives, and imparted to\r\nthem a daring reckless character, which rendered Rohilcund a nursery for\r\nirregular cavalry—and afterwards for mutineers.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Sibbald was commandant of Bareilly, one of the towns of\r\nRohilcund in which troops were stationed. These troops were entirely\r\nnative, comprising the 18th and 68th Bengal native infantry, the 8th\r\nirregular cavalry, and a battery of native artillery—not an English\r\nsoldier among them except the officers. The brigadier, although these\r\ntroops appeared towards the close of the month of May to be in an\r\nagitated state, nevertheless heard that all was well at Mooradabad,\r\nShahjehanpoor, Almora, and other stations in Rohilcund, and looked\r\nforward with some confidence to the continuance of tranquility—aided by\r\nhis second in command, Colonel Troup, and the commissioner, Mr\r\nAlexander. As a precaution, however, the ladies and children were sent\r\nfor safety to Nynee Tal; and the gentlemen kept their horses saddled,\r\nready for any emergency. Bareilly being a city of a hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, the temper of the natives was very anxiously watched.\r\nScarcely had the month closed, before the hopes of Brigadier Sibbald\r\nreceived a dismal check, and his life a violent end. We have already\r\nbriefly mentioned (p. 114) that on Sunday the 31st, Bareilly became a\r\nscene of violence and rapine; the brigadier himself being shot by a\r\ntrooper, the treasure seized, the bungalows plundered and burned, and\r\nthe Europeans either murdered or impelled to escape for their lives.\r\nWhen Colonel Troup, who commanded the 68th native infantry, and who\r\nbecame chief military authority after the death of Sibbald, found\r\nhimself safe at Nynee Tal, he wrote an official account of the whole\r\nproceeding, corroborating the chief facts noted by the brigadier, and\r\nadding others known more especially to himself. From this dispatch it\r\nappears that the colonel commanded at Bareilly from the 6th to the 19th\r\nof May, while the brigadier was making a tour of inspection through his\r\ndistrict; that from the 19th to the 29th, Sibbald himself resumed the\r\ncommand; and that during those twenty-three days nothing occurred to\r\nshew disaffection among the troops, further than a certain troubled and\r\nagitated state. On that day, however, the Europeans received\r\ninformation, from two native officers, that the men of the 18th and 68th\r\nnative regiments had, _while bathing in the river_, concerted a plan of\r\nmutiny for that same afternoon. Most of the officers were quickly on the\r\nalert; and, whether or not through this evidence of preparedness, no\r\némeute took place on that day. On the 30th, Colonel Troup, who had\r\nrelied on the fidelity of the 8th irregular cavalry, received\r\ninformation that those sowars had sworn not to act against the native\r\ninfantry and artillery if the latter should rise, although they would\r\nrefrain from molesting their own officers. After a day and night of\r\nviolent excitement throughout the whole station, the morning of Sunday\r\nthe 31st (again Sunday!) ushered in a day of bloodshed and rapine.\r\nMessages were despatched to all the officers, warning them of some\r\nintended outbreak; but the bearers, sent by Troup, failed in their duty,\r\ninsomuch that many of the officers remained ignorant of the danger until\r\ntoo late to avert it. Major Pearson, of the 18th, believed his men to be\r\nstanch; Captain Kirby, of the artillery (6th company, 6th battalion), in\r\nlike manner trusted his corps; and Captain Brownlow, the brigade major,\r\ndisbelieved the approach of mutiny—at the very time that Colonel Troup\r\nwas impressing on all his conviction that the sinister rumours were well\r\nfounded. At eleven o’clock, the truth appeared in fatal colours; the\r\nroar of cannon, the rattle of musketry, and the yells of men, told\r\nplainly that the revolt had begun, and that the artillery had joined in\r\nit. The 8th irregular cavalry, under Captain Mackenzie, were ordered or\r\ninvited by him to proceed against the lines of the insurgent infantry\r\nand artillery; but the result was so disastrous, that all the Europeans,\r\nmilitary as well as civilians, found their only safety would be in\r\nflight. Ruktawar Khan, subadar of artillery, assumed the rank of\r\ngeneral, and paraded about in the carriage of the brigadier, attended by\r\na numerous string of followers as a ‘staff.’ Colonel Troup, writing on\r\nthe 10th of June, had to report the deaths of Brigadier Sibbald and\r\nthree or four other officers, together with that of many of the civil\r\nservants. About twenty-five military officers escaped; but the list of\r\n‘missing’ was large, and many of those included in it were afterwards\r\nknown to have been brutally murdered. Captain Mackenzie, who clung to\r\nhis troopers in the earnest hope that they would remain faithful, found\r\nonly nineteen men who did so, and who escorted their officers all the\r\nway to Nynee Tal.\r\n\r\nA despicable hoary traitor, Khan Bahadoor Khan, appears to have headed\r\nthis movement. He had for many years been in receipt of a double pension\r\nfrom the Indian government—as the living representative of one of the\r\nearly Rohilla chieftains, and as a retired judge of one of the native\r\ncourts. He was an old, venerable-looking, insinuating man; he was\r\nthoroughly relied on by the civil authorities at Bareilly; he had loudly\r\nproclaimed his indignation against the Delhi mutineers; and yet he\r\nbecame ringleader of those at Bareilly—deepening his damning atrocities\r\nby the massacre of such of the unfortunate Europeans as did not succeed\r\nin making their escape. It was by his orders, as self-elected chief of\r\nRohilcund, that a rigorous search was made for all Europeans who\r\nremained in Bareilly; and that Judge Robertson, and four or five other\r\nEuropean gentlemen, were hung in the Kotwal square, after a mock-trial.\r\nDuring the month of June, Bareilly remained entirely in the hands of the\r\nrebels; not an Englishman, probably, was alive in the place; and the\r\nMussulmans and Hindoos were left to contend for supremacy over the\r\nspoil.\r\n\r\nOf Boodayoun it will be unnecessary to say more here; Mr Edwards’s\r\nnarrative of an eventful escape (pp. 115, 116), pointed to the 1st of\r\nJune as the day when the Europeans deemed it necessary to flee from that\r\nstation—not because there were any native troops at Boodayoun, but\r\nbecause the mutineers from Bareilly were approaching, and joyfully\r\nexpected by all the scoundrels in the place, who looked forward to a\r\nharvest of plunder as a natural result.\r\n\r\nMooradabad, which began its season of anarchy and violence on the 3d of\r\nJune, stands on the right bank of the Ramgunga, an affluent of the\r\nGanges, at a point about midway between Meerut and Bareilly. It is a\r\ntown of nearly 60,000 inhabitants—having a civil station, with its\r\ncutcherry and bungalows; a cantonment west of the town; a spacious serai\r\nfor the accommodation of travellers; and an enormous jail sufficiently\r\nlarge to contain nearly two thousand prisoners. In this, as in many\r\nother towns of India, the Company’s troops were wont to be regarded\r\nrather as guardians of the jail and its inmates, than for any active\r\nmilitary duties. So early as the 19th of May, nine days after the\r\nmutineers of Meerut had set the example, the 29th regiment native\r\ninfantry proceeded to the jail at Mooradabad, and released all the\r\nprisoners. Although Mr Saunders, collector and magistrate, wrote full\r\naccounts to Agra of the proceedings of that and the following days, the\r\ndâks were so completely stopped on the road that Mr Colvin remained\r\nalmost in ignorance of the state of affairs; and on that account\r\nSaunders could obtain no assistance from any quarter. The released\r\nprisoners, joined by predatory bands of Goojurs, Meewatties, and Jâts,\r\ncommenced a system of plunder and rapine, which the European authorities\r\nwere ill able to check. The 29th, however, had not openly mutinied; and\r\nit still remained possible to hold control within the town and the\r\nsurrounding district; several native sappers and miners were stopped and\r\ncaptured on their way from Meerut, and several of the mutinous 20th\r\nregiment on the way from Mozuffernugger. When, however, news of the\r\nBareilly outbreak on the 31st reached Mooradabad, the effect on the men\r\nof the 29th regiment, and of a native artillery detachment, became very\r\nevident. On the 3d of June, the sepoys in guard of the treasury\r\ndisplayed so evident an intention of appropriating the money, that Mr\r\nSaunders felt compelled to leave it (about seventy thousand rupees)\r\ntogether with much plate and opium in their hands—being powerless to\r\nprevent the spoliation. The troops manifested much irritation at the\r\nsmallness of the treasure, and were only prevented from wreaking their\r\nvengeance on the officials by an oath they had previously taken. To\r\nremain longer in the town was deemed a useless risk, as bad passions\r\nwere rising on every side. The civil officers of the Company, with their\r\nwives and families, succeeded in making a safe retreat to Meerut; while\r\nCaptain Whish, Captain Faddy, and other officers of the 29th, with the\r\nfew remaining Europeans, laid their plans for a journey to Nynee Tal.\r\nAll shared an opinion that if the Bareilly regiments had not mutinied,\r\nthe 29th would have remained faithful—a poor solace, such as had been\r\nsought for by many other officials similarly placed. Mr Colvin\r\nafterwards accepted Mr Saunders’s motives and conduct in leaving the\r\nstation, as justifiable under the trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nRohilcund contained three military stations, Bareilly, Mooradabad, and\r\nShahjehanpoor—Boodayoun and the other places named being merely civil\r\nstations. As at Bareilly and Mooradabad, so at Shahjehanpoor; the native\r\ntroops at the station rose in mutiny. On Sunday the 31st of May—a day\r\nmarked by so many atrocities in India—the 28th native infantry rose,\r\nsurrounded the Christian residents as they were engaged in divine\r\nworship in church, and murdered nearly the whole of them, including the\r\nRev. Mr M’Callum in the sacred edifice itself. The few who escaped were\r\nexposed to an accumulation of miseries; first they sought shelter at\r\nMohammerah in Oude; then they met the 41st regiment, after the mutiny at\r\nSeetapoor, who shot and cut them down without mercy; and scarcely any\r\nlived to tell the dismal tale to English ears.\r\n\r\nThus then it appears that, in Rohilcund, the 18th, 68th, 28th, and 29th\r\nregiments native infantry, together with the 8th irregular cavalry and a\r\nbattery of native artillery, rose in revolt at the three military\r\nstations, and murdered or drove out nearly the whole of the Europeans\r\nfrom the entire province—European troops there were none; only officers\r\nand civilians. They plundered all the treasuries, containing more than a\r\nquarter of a million sterling, and marched off towards Delhi, five\r\nthousand strong—unmolested by the general who commanded at Meerut.\r\n\r\nNynee Tal became more crowded than ever with refugees from Oude and\r\nRohilcund. Under the energetic command of Captain Ramsey, this\r\nhill-station remained in quiet during the month of May (p. 115); but it\r\nwas not so easily defended in June. Some of the native artillery at\r\nAlmora, not far distant, gave rise to uneasiness towards the close of\r\nthe month; yet as the ill-doers were promptly put into prison, and as\r\nthe Goorkhas remained stanch, confidence was partially restored. The\r\nsepoys from the rebel regiments dreaded a march in this direction, on\r\naccount of the deadly character of the Terai, a strip of swampy forest,\r\nthirty miles broad, which interposes between the plains and the hills;\r\nbut that jungle-land itself contained many marauders, who were only\r\nprevented by fear of the Goorkhas from going up to Nynee Tal. At the end\r\nof June, there were five times as many women and children as men among\r\nthe Europeans at that place; hence the anxious eye with which the\r\nproceedings in surrounding districts were regarded.\r\n\r\nThe third region to which this chapter is appropriated—the Doab—now\r\ncalls for attention. Like Oude and Rohilcund, it was the scene of\r\nterrible anarchy and bloodshed in the month of June. In its two\r\nparts—the Lower Doab, from Allahabad to a little above Furruckabad; and\r\nthe Upper Doab, from the last-named city up to the hill-country—it was\r\nnearly surrounded by mutineers, who apparently acted in concert with\r\nthose in the Doab itself.\r\n\r\nOf Allahabad and Cawnpore, the two chief places in the Lower Doab,\r\nsufficient has been said in Chapters VIII. and IX. to trace the course\r\nof events during the month of June. About midway between the two is\r\nFuttehpoor, a small civil station in the centre of a group of Mohammedan\r\nvillages; it contained, at the beginning of June, about a dozen civil\r\nservants of the Company, and a small detachment of the 6th native\r\nregiment from Allahabad. The residents, as a precautionary measure, had\r\nsent their wives and children to that stronghold, and had also arranged\r\na plan for assembling at the house of the magistrate, if danger should\r\nappear. On the 5th of the month, disastrous news arriving from Lucknow\r\nand Cawnpore, the residents took up their abode for the night on the\r\nflat roof of the magistrate’s house, with their weapons by their sides;\r\nand on the following day they hauled up a supply of tents, provisions,\r\nwater, and ammunition—a singular citadel being thus extemporised in the\r\nabsence of better. On the 7th, their small detachment aided in repelling\r\na body of troopers who had just arrived from Cawnpore on a plundering\r\nexpedition; and the residents congratulated themselves on the fidelity\r\nof this small band. Their reliance was, however, of short duration; for,\r\non the receipt of news of the Allahabad outbreak, the native officials\r\nin the collector’s office gave way, like the natives all around them,\r\nand Futtehpoor soon became a perilous spot for Europeans. On the 9th,\r\nthe residents held a council on their roof, and resolved to quit the\r\nstation. A few troopers befriended them; and they succeeded, after many\r\nperils and sufferings, in reaching Banda, a town southward of the Jumna.\r\nNot all of them, however. Mr Robert Tucker, the judge, resisting\r\nentreaty, determined to remain at his post to the last. He rode all over\r\nthe town, promising rewards to those natives who would be faithful; he\r\nendeavoured to shame others by his heroic bearing; he appealed to the\r\ngratitude and good feeling of many of the poorer natives, who had been\r\nbenefited by him in more peaceful times. But all in vain. The jail was\r\nbroken open, the prisoners liberated, and the treasury plundered; and Mr\r\nTucker, flying to the roof of the cutcherry, there bravely defended\r\nhimself until a storm of bullets laid him low. Robert Tucker was one of\r\nthose civilians of whom the Company had reason to be proud.\r\n\r\nAdvancing to the northwest, we come to a string of towns and\r\nstations—Etawah, Minpooree, Allygurh, Futteghur, Muttra, Bolundshuhur,\r\nMozuffernugger, &c.—which shared with Oude and Rohilcund the wild\r\ndisorders of the month of June. The mutiny at Futteghur has already\r\nengaged our notice (p. 133), in connection with the miserable fugitives\r\nwho swelled the numbers put to death by Nena Sahib at Bithoor and\r\nCawnpore. It needs little further mention here. The 10th native\r\ninfantry, and a small body of artillery, long resisted the temptation\r\nheld out by mutineers elsewhere; but, on the appearance of the insurgent\r\nregiments from Seetapoor, their fidelity gave way. Four companies went\r\noff with the treasure; the remainder joined the other mutinous regiments\r\nin besieging the fort to which so many Europeans had fled for refuge,\r\nand from which so disastrous a boat-voyage was made down the Ganges. Mr\r\nColvin, at Agra, knew of the perilous state of things at Futteghur; he\r\nknew that a native nawab had been chosen by the mutineers as a sort of\r\nsovereign; but, as we shall presently see, he was too weak in reliable\r\ntroops to afford any assistance whatever. Thus it happened that the two\r\nboat-expeditions, of June and July, ended so deplorably to the\r\nEuropeans, and left Futteghur so wholly in the hands of the rebels. It\r\nwas a great loss to the British in many ways; for most of the Company’s\r\ngun-carriages were made, or at least stored, at Futteghur; and the\r\nagency-yard was surrounded by warehouses containing a large supply of\r\nmaterial belonging to the artillery service. Indeed it was this\r\ncourt-yard of the gun-carriage agency that constituted the fort, as soon\r\nas a few defensive arrangements had been made. Many circumstances had\r\ndrawn rather a large English population to Futteghur; and hence the\r\nterrible severity of the tragedy. There were officers of the 10th\r\nregiment; other military officers on leave; gun-carriage agents; civil\r\nservants; merchants and dealers; a few tent-makers and other artisans;\r\nindigo-planters from the neighbouring estates; and many native\r\nChristians under the care of the American Presbyterian mission.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (pp. 112, 113) by how small a number of native\r\ntroops several stations were set in commotion in May. The 9th regiment\r\nBengal native infantry was separated into four portions, which were\r\nstationed at Allygurh, Bolundshuhur, Etawah, and Minpooree,\r\nrespectively; and all mutinied nearly at the same time. The fortune of\r\nwar, if war it can be called, at these stations during the month of\r\nJune, may be traced in a very few words. It was on the 20th of May that\r\nthe four companies at Allygurh mutinied; and on the 24th that one-half\r\nof Lieutenant Cockburn’s Gwalior troopers, instead of assisting him to\r\nretain or regain the station, rose in mutiny and galloped off to join\r\nthe insurgents elsewhere. There were, however, about a hundred who\r\nremained faithful to him; and these, with fifty volunteers, made an\r\nadvance to Allygurh, retook it, drove out the detachment of the 9th\r\nnative regiment, released a few Europeans who had been in hiding there,\r\ncaptured one Rao Bhopal Singh, and hanged him as a petty chieftain who\r\nhad continued the rapine begun by the sepoys. Throughout the month of\r\nJune this station was maintained in British hands—not so much for its\r\nvalue in a military sense, as for its utility in keeping open the roads\r\nto Agra and Meerut; but, in the direction of Delhi, the volunteers could\r\nobtain very little news, the dâks being all cut off by the Goojurs and\r\nother predatory bands. At Minpooree the three companies of the 9th\r\nchecked, it will be remembered, by the undaunted courage and tact of\r\nLieutenant de Kantzow, departed to join the insurgents elsewhere; but\r\nMinpooree remained in British hands. The remaining companies mutinied at\r\nEtawah and Bolundshuhur without much violence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIMLA, the summer residence of the Governor-general of India.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAgra, when the narrative last left it (p. 111), had passed through the\r\nmonth of May without any serious disturbances. The troops consisted of\r\nthe 44th and 67th regiments Bengal native infantry, the 3d Europeans,\r\nand a few artillery. After two companies of these native troops had\r\nmutinied while engaged in bringing treasure from Muttra to Agra, Mr\r\nColvin deemed it necessary to disarm all the other companies; and this\r\nwas quietly and successfully effected on the 1st of June, by the 3d\r\nEuropeans and Captain D’Oyley’s field-battery. Many facts afterward came\r\nto light, tending to shew that if this disarming had not taken place,\r\nthe 44th and 67th would have stained their hands with the same bloody\r\ndeeds as the sepoys were doing elsewhere. The native lines had been more\r\nthan once set on fire during the later days of May—in the hope, as\r\nafterwards appears, that the handful of Europeans, by rushing out\r\nunarmed to extinguish the flames, would afford the native troops a\r\nfavourable opportunity to master the defences of the city, and the six\r\nguns of the field-battery. A curious proof was supplied of the little\r\nknowledge possessed by the Europeans of the native character, and the\r\nsecret springs that worked unseen as moving powers for their actions.\r\nThere had long seemed to be an angry feeling between the 44th and the\r\n67th; and Mr Colvin, or the brigadier acting with him, selected one\r\ncompany from each regiment for the mission to Muttra, in the belief that\r\neach would act as a jealous check upon the other; instead of which, the\r\ntwo companies joined in revolt, murdered many of their officers, and\r\ncarried off their treasure towards Delhi. After the very necessary\r\ndisarming of the two regiments, the defence of this important city was\r\nleft to the 3d European Fusiliers, Captain D’Oyley’s field-battery of\r\nsix guns, and a corps of volunteer European cavalry under Lieutenant\r\nGreathed. Most of the disarmed men deserted, and swelled the ranks of\r\nthe desperadoes that wrought so much ruin in the surrounding districts—a\r\nresult that led many military officers to doubt whether disarming\r\nwithout imprisonment was a judicious course under such circumstances;\r\nfor the men naturally felt exasperated at their humbled position,\r\nwhether deserved or not; and their loyalty, as soldiers out of work, was\r\nnot likely to be in any way increased. Whether or not this opinion be\r\ncorrect, the Europeans in Agra felt their only reliance to be in each\r\nother. During the early days of June, most of the ladies resorted at\r\nnight to certain places of refuge allotted by the governor, such as the\r\nfort, the post-office, the office of the _Mofussilite_ newspaper, and\r\nbehind the artillery lines; while the gentlemen patrolled the streets,\r\nor maintained a defensive attitude at appointed places. Trade was\r\ncontinued, British supremacy was asserted, bloodshed was kept away from\r\nthe city, and the Europeans maintained a steady if not cheerful\r\ndemeanour. Nevertheless Mr Colvin was full of anxieties; he was\r\nresponsible to the Calcutta government, not only for Agra, but for the\r\nwhole of the Northwest Provinces; yet he found himself equally unable to\r\nsend aid to other stations, and receive aid from them. Agra was troubled\r\non the night of the 23d of June by the desertion of the jail-guard, to\r\nwhom had been intrusted the custody of the large central prison. A guard\r\nfrom the 3d Europeans was thereupon placed on the outside; while the\r\ninside was guarded by another force under Dr Walker the superintendent.\r\nSo far as concerned military disturbances within the city, Mr Colvin was\r\nnot at that time under much apprehension; but he knew that certain\r\nregiments from Neemuch—the mutiny of which will be described in the next\r\nchapter—had approached by the end of the month to a point on the high\r\nroad between Agra and Jeypoor, very near the first-named city; and he\r\nheard that they contemplated an attack. He estimated their strength at\r\ntwo regiments of infantry, four or five hundred cavalry, and eight guns;\r\nbut as the whole of the civil and military authorities at Agra were on\r\nthe alert, he did not regard this approaching force with much alarm. To\r\nstrengthen his position, and maintain public confidence, he organised a\r\nEuropean militia of horse and foot, among the clerks, railway men, &c.,\r\nto which it was expected and desired that nearly all civilians should\r\nbelong. This militia, placed under the management of Captains\r\nPrendergast and Lamb, Lieutenants Rawlins and Oldfield, and Ensign\r\nNoble, who had belonged to the disarmed native regiments, was divided\r\ninto two corps, to which the defence of the different parts of the\r\nstation was intrusted. How the Europeans, both military and civilians,\r\nbecame cooped up in the fort during July, we shall see in a future\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nMeerut, during June, remained in the hands of the British; but there was\r\nmuch inactivity on the part of the general commanding there, in relation\r\nto the districts around that town. On the 10th of May, when the mutiny\r\nbegan (p. 50), there were a thousand men of the 60th Rifles, six hundred\r\nof the Carabiniers, a troop of horse-artillery, and five hundred\r\nartillery recruits—constituting a force unusually large, in relation to\r\nthe general distribution of English troops in India. Yet these fine\r\nsoldiers were not so handled as to draw from them the greatest amount of\r\nservice. They were not sent after the three mutinous regiments who\r\nescaped to Delhi; and during the urgent and critical need of Lawrence,\r\nColvin, and Wheeler, Major-general Hewett kept his Europeans almost\r\nconstantly in or near Meerut. It is true that he, and others who have\r\ndefended him, asserted that the maintenance of the position at Meerut, a\r\nvery important consideration, could not have been insured if he had\r\nmarched out to intercept rebels going from various quarters towards\r\nDelhi; but this argument was not deemed satisfactory at Calcutta;\r\nMajor-general Hewett was superseded, and another commander appointed in\r\nhis place. It was not until June that dâks were re-established between\r\nMeerut and Agra on the one hand, and Meerut and Kurnaul on the other.\r\nSome of the Europeans were sent off to join the besieging army before\r\nDelhi; while a portion of the remainder were occasionally occupied in\r\nputting down bands of Goojurs and other predatory robbers around Meerut.\r\nThe town of Sirdhana, where the Catholic nuns and children had been\r\nplaced in such peril (p. 57), was too near Meerut to be held by the\r\nrebels. Early in June, one Wallee Dad Khan set himself up as subadar or\r\ncaptain-general of Meerut, under the King of Delhi; raised a rabble\r\nforce of Goojurs; held the fort of Malagurh with six guns; and seized\r\nthe district of Bolundshuhur. News arriving that he was advancing with\r\nhis force towards Meerut, about a hundred European troops, Rifles and\r\nCarabiniers, with a few civilians and two guns, started off to intercept\r\nhim. They had little work to do, however, except to burn villages held\r\nby the insurgents; for the robber Goojurs having quarrelled with the\r\nrobber Jâts about plunder, the latter compelled Wallee Dud Khan and his\r\ngeneral, Ismail Khan, to effect a retreat before the English came up. In\r\nthe last week of the month the force at Meerut, chiefly in consequence\r\nof the number sent off to Delhi, was reduced to about eight hundred;\r\nthese were kept so well on the alert, and the whole town and cantonment\r\nso well guarded, that the Europeans felt little alarm; although vexed\r\nthat they could afford no further assistance to the besiegers of Delhi,\r\nnor even chastise a portion of the 4th irregular cavalry, who mutinied\r\nat Mozuffernugger. All the English, civilians and their families as well\r\nas military officers, lived at Meerut either in barracks or tents—none\r\nventuring to sleep beyond the immediate spot where the military were\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nSimla, during these varied operations, continued to be a place where, as\r\nat Nynee Tal, ladies and children, as well as some of the officers and\r\ncivilians, took refuge after being despoiled by mutineers. A militia was\r\nformed after the hasty departure of General Anson; Simla was divided\r\ninto four districts under separate officers; and the gentlemen aided by\r\na few English troops, defended those districts, throughout June. The\r\npeople at the bazaar, and all the native servants of the place, were\r\ndisarmed, and the arms taken for safe custody to Kussowlie.\r\n\r\nDelhi—a place repeatedly mentioned in every chapter of this\r\nnarrative—continued to be the centre towards which the attention of all\r\nIndia was anxiously directed. Fast as the native regiments mutinied in\r\nBengal, Oude, Rohilcund, the Doab, Bundelcund, and elsewhere, so did\r\nthey either flee to Delhi, or shape their course in dependence on the\r\nmilitary operations going on there; and fast as the British troops could\r\nbe despatched to that spot, so did they take rank among the besiegers.\r\nBut in truth this latter augmentation came almost wholly from the\r\nPunjaub and other western districts. Lloyd, Neill, Wheeler, Lawrence,\r\nHewett, Sibbald, were so closely engaged in attending to the districts\r\naround Dinapoor, Benares, Allahabad, Cawnpore, Lucknow, Meerut, and\r\nBareilly, that they could not send aid to the besiegers of Delhi, during\r\nseveral weeks of siege operations. These operations will be noticed in\r\nsystematic order, when the other threads of the narrative have been\r\ntraced to the proper points. Meanwhile the reader will bear in mind that\r\nthe siege of Delhi was in progress from the middle of June to an\r\nadvanced period in the summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tomb at Futtehpore Sikri.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  _Artillery_: 4 guns, horse light field-battery; 6 guns, Oude\r\n  field-battery; and 1 8-inch howitzer. _Cavalry_: 120 troopers of 1st,\r\n  2d, and 3d Oude irregular cavalry; and 40 volunteer cavalry, under\r\n  Captain Radcliffe. _Infantry_: 300 of H.M. 32d foot; 150 of 13th\r\n  native infantry; 60 of the 48th native infantry; and 20 of the 71st.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  ‘Every boy has read, and many living men still remember, how the death\r\n  of Nelson was felt by all as a deep personal affliction. Sir Henry\r\n  Lawrence was less widely known, and his deeds were in truth of less\r\n  magnitude than those of the great sea-captain; but never probably was\r\n  a public man within the sphere of his reputation more ardently\r\n  beloved. Sir Henry Lawrence had that rare and happy faculty (which a\r\n  man in almost every other respect unlike him, Sir Charles Napier, is\r\n  said also to have possessed) of attaching to himself every one with\r\n  whom he came in contact. He had that gift which is never acquired, a\r\n  gracious, winning, noble manner; rough and ready as he was in the\r\n  field, his manner in private life had an indescribable charm of\r\n  frankness, grace, and even courtly dignity. He had that virtue which\r\n  Englishmen instinctively and characteristically love—a lion-like\r\n  courage. He had that fault which Englishmen so readily forgive, and\r\n  when mixed with what are felt to be its naturally concomitant good\r\n  qualities, they almost admire—a hot and impetuous temper; he had in\r\n  overflowing measure that Godlike grace which even the base revere and\r\n  the good acknowledge as the crown of virtue—the grace of charity. No\r\n  young officer ever sat at Sir Henry’s table without learning to think\r\n  more kindly of the natives; no one, young or old, man or woman, ever\r\n  heard Sir Henry speak of the European soldier, or ever visited the\r\n  Lawrence Asylum, without being excited to a nobler and truer\r\n  appreciation of the real extent of his duty towards his neighbour. He\r\n  was one of the few distinguished Anglo-Indians who had attained to\r\n  something like an English reputation in his lifetime. In a few years,\r\n  his name will be familiar to every reader of Indian history; but for\r\n  the present it is in India that his memory will be most deeply\r\n  cherished; it is by Anglo-Indians that any eulogy on him will be best\r\n  appreciated, it is by them that the institutions which he founded and\r\n  maintained will be fostered as a monument to his memory.’—_Fraser’s\r\n  Magazine_, No. 336.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  The troops stationed at that time at Fyzabad comprised the 22d\r\n  regiment native infantry; the 6th regiment irregular Oude infantry;\r\n  the 5th troop of the 15th regiment irregular cavalry; No. 5 company of\r\n  the 7th battalion of artillery; and No. 13 horse-battery. The chief\r\n  officers were Colonels Lennox and O’Brien; Major Mill; Captain Morgan;\r\n  Lieutenants Fowle, English, Bright, Lindesay, Thomas, Ouseley,\r\n  Cautley, Gordon, Parsons, Percival, and Currie; and Ensigns Anderson\r\n  and Ritchie. Colonel Goldney held a civil appointment as commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                    CENTRAL REGIONS OF INDIA: JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the political and territorial arrangements of the East India Company,\r\nthe name of Central India is somewhat vaguely employed to designate a\r\nportion of the region lying between the Jumna and Bundelcund on the\r\nnortheast, and the Nizam’s territory and Gujerat on the southwest; a\r\ndesignation convenient for general reading, without possessing any very\r\nprecise acceptation. In the present chapter, we shall change the\r\nexpression and enlarge the meaning so as to designate a belt of country\r\nthat really forms Central India in a geographical sense, extending from\r\nLower Bengal to Rajpootana, and separating Northern India from the\r\nsouthern or peninsular portion of the empire. This will carry the\r\nnarrative into regions very little mentioned in former chapters—such as\r\nNagpoor, the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, Bundelcund and Rewah, the\r\nMahratta states and the Rajpoot states—regions that will be briefly\r\ndescribed, so far as to render the proceedings of the native troops\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nWe begin with Nagpoor, a country now belonging to the British\r\ngovernment, and considerably larger than England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThis province was acquired, not so much by conquest, as by one of those\r\nintricate arrangements concerning dynasty which have brought so many\r\nnative states under British rule. It is in general an elevated country,\r\ncontaining many offshoots from the Vindhya range of mountains. Some\r\nparts of it, towards the southeast, have never been explored by\r\nEuropeans, but are believed to be hilly, wooded, and full of jungles,\r\ninhabited by the semi-barbarous tribe of Ghonds. The remainder is better\r\nknown and better cultivated; and being on the high road from Calcutta to\r\nBombay, possesses much political importance. The population exceeds four\r\nmillions and a half. Early in the last century, one of the Mahratta\r\nchieftains conquered Nagpoor from the rajahs who had before governed it;\r\nand he and his descendants, or other ambitious members of the Mahratta\r\nfamily, continued to hold it as Rajahs of Nagpoor or Berar. Although\r\nconstantly fighting one with another, these Mahrattas were on fair terms\r\nwith the East India Company until 1803, when, unluckily for the\r\ncontinuance of his rule, the native rajah joined Scindia in the war\r\nagainst the British. As a consequence, when peace was restored in 1804,\r\nhe was forced to yield Cuttack and other provinces to the conquerors. In\r\n1817, another Rajah of Nagpoor joined the Peishwa of the Mahrattas in\r\nhostilities against the British—a course which led to his expulsion from\r\nthe raj, and to a further increase of British influence. Then followed a\r\nperiod during which one rajah was imbecile, another under age, and many\r\nunscrupulous chieftains sought to gain an ascendency one over another.\r\nThis was precisely the state of things which rendered the British\r\nresident more and more powerful, setting up and putting down rajahs, and\r\nallowing the competitors to weaken the whole native rule by weakening\r\neach other. The history of British India may be almost told in such\r\nwords as these. At length, in 1853, the last rajah, Ragojee, died—not\r\nonly without heirs, but without any male relations who could support a\r\nlegitimate claim to the raj. Thereupon, the governor-general quietly\r\nannexed this large country to the Company’s dominions. It will be\r\nremembered (p. 4) that the Marquis of Dalhousie, in his minute,\r\ndespatched this subject in a very few lines; not asserting that the\r\nBritish had actually any right to the country; but ‘wisely incorporated\r\nit,’ as no one else could put in a legitimate claim for it, and as it\r\nwould have been imprudent ‘to bestow the territory in free gift upon a\r\nstranger.’ The Nagpoor territory was placed under the management of a\r\ncommissioner, who was immediately subordinate to the governor-general in\r\ncouncil; seeing that the Bengal Presidency was already too large to have\r\nthis considerable country attached to it for governmental purposes.\r\n\r\nAt and soon after the time of the outbreak, there were the 1st regiment\r\nirregular infantry, the Kamptee irregulars, an irregular horse-battery,\r\nand a body of European gunners, stationed in the city of Nagpoor, or in\r\nKamptee, eleven miles distant; the 2d infantry and a detachment of the\r\n1st were at Chandah; a detachment of the 1st at Bhandara; the chief\r\nportion of the 3d at Rajpoor; and the remainder of the same regiment at\r\nBilaspoor. The arsenal, containing guns, arms, ammunition, and military\r\nstores of every description; and the treasury of the province, with a\r\nlarge amount of Company’s funds—were close to the city. Mr Plowden\r\nfilled the office of commissioner at that period. With a mere handful of\r\nEuropeans in the midst of a very extensive territory, he often trembled\r\nin thought for the safety of his position, and of British interests\r\ngenerally, in the region placed under his keeping. He had numerous\r\nnative troops with him, and a large city under his control; if anything\r\nsinister should arise, he was far away from any extraneous aid—being\r\nnearly six hundred miles distant from Madras, and still further from\r\nCalcutta. But, whatever were his anxieties (and they were many), he put\r\non a calm bearing towards the natives of Nagpoor. This city, the capital\r\nof the territory bearing the same name, is a dirty, irregular,\r\nstraggling place, nearly seven miles in circumference. Most of the\r\nhouses are mud-built; and even the palace of the late rajah is little\r\nmore than a clumsy pile of unfinished masonry. The city has become\r\nrather famous for its banking business, and for its manufactures of\r\ncottons, chintzes, turbans, silks, brocades, woollens, blankets,\r\ntent-cloths, and other textile goods. The population exceeds a hundred\r\nthousand. There is nothing of a military appearance about the city; but\r\nwhoever commands the Seetabuldee, commands Nagpoor itself. This\r\nSeetabuldee is a hilly ridge close to the city on the west, having two\r\nsummits, the northern the higher, the southern the larger, but every\r\npart overlooking the city, and fortified. Such being the topographical\r\nposition of his seat of government, Mr Plowden proceeded to disarm such\r\nof his troops as excited disquietude in his mind, and to strengthen the\r\nSeetabuldee. A corps of irregular cavalry shewed symptoms of disloyalty;\r\nand indeed rumours were afloat that on a particular day the ascent of a\r\nballoon was to be a signal for the revolt of the troops. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Mr Plowden arranged with Colonel Cumberlege, the\r\ncommandant, to disarm them on the morning of the 23d of June—the colonel\r\nhaving the 4th regiment of Madras cavalry, on whom he fully relied, to\r\nenforce the order for disbanding. The irregulars were paraded, mounted\r\nand fully armed, to shew that the authorities were not afraid of them.\r\nMr Plowden having addressed them, they quietly gave up their arms and\r\ntheir saddles, which were taken in carts to the arsenal; and thus six\r\nhundred and fifty troopers were left with nothing but their bare horses,\r\nand ropes to picket them. Some of the men and of the native officers\r\nwere arrested, and put on their trial for an attempt to excite mutiny.\r\nThe roll was called over every four hours, and every native soldier\r\nabsent, or found outside the lines without a pass, was treated as a\r\ndeserter. The 1st regiment irregular infantry assisted in the disarming\r\nof the troopers. Following up the measures thus promptly taken, the\r\ncommissioner strengthened the defences on the Seetabuldee hill, as a\r\nlast refuge for the Europeans at Nagpoor in the event of any actual\r\nmutiny at that place. The Residency became a barrack at night for all\r\nthe civil and military officers; and a watchful eye was kept on the\r\nnatives generally. At present, all was safe in Nagpoor.\r\n\r\nAnother province, and another commissioner in charge of it, now come for\r\nnotice. This province, bearing the rather lengthened name of the Saugor\r\nand Nerbudda Territories, is about half the size of England, and is\r\nbounded by the various provinces or regions of Nagpoor, Mirzapore,\r\nAllahabad, Banda, Bundelcund, Gwalior, Bhopal, and the Nizam’s state of\r\nHyderabad. It corresponds more nearly with the exact centre of India\r\nthan any other portion of territory. One half of its name is derived\r\nfrom the town of Saugor, the other half from the river Nerbudda. To\r\ndescribe the scraps and patches of which it consists, and the means by\r\nwhich they were acquired, would be neither easy nor necessary. Within\r\nits limits is the small independent state of Rewah, the rajah of which\r\nwas bound to the British government by a treaty of alliance. Four other\r\npetty states—Kotee, Myhir, Oocheyra, and Sohawul—were in the hands of\r\nnative chieftains, mere feudatories of the Company, under whose grants\r\nthey held their possessions; allowed to govern their small\r\nsovereignties, but subject at any moment to the supervision and\r\ninterference of the paramount power. The larger portion, now entirely\r\nBritish, is marked by the towns and districts of Saugor, Jubbulpoor,\r\nHosungabad, Seuni, Nursingpore, Baitool, Sohagpoor, and others of less\r\nimportance. There are still many aboriginal Ghonds in the province, as\r\nin Nagpoor, lurking in the gloomiest recesses of dense forests, and\r\nsubsisting for the most part on wild roots and fruits. There are other\r\nhalf-savage tribes of Koles, Palis, and Panwars; while the more\r\ncivilised population comprises a singular mixture of Brahmins, Bundelas,\r\nRajpoots, Mahrattas, and Patans. The Mahrattas at one time claimed this\r\nregion, on the same plea as those east and west of it—the right of\r\nconquest; and the British obtained it from the Mahrattas, about forty\r\nyears ago, by cession after a course of hostilities.\r\n\r\nMajor Erskine was commissioner of the Saugor and Nerbudda territories\r\nduring the early weeks of the mutiny; responsible, not immediately to\r\nthe governor-general at Calcutta, but to the lieutenant-governor of the\r\nNorthwest Provinces at Agra. Like Mr Plowden at Nagpoor, he felt how\r\nimperiled he and his fellow-Europeans would be if the native troops were\r\nto rebel. At Jhansi and at Nuseerabad, as we shall presently see, revolt\r\nand massacre marked the first week in June; and Major Erskine sought\r\nearnestly for means to prevent his own Saugor troops from being tempted\r\nto a similar course. He was with the 52d native infantry at Jubbulpoor.\r\nHe wrote on the 9th of June to Brigadier Prior at Kamptee, praying\r\nhim—while keeping that station and Seuni intact—to prevent, if possible,\r\nall news of the mutineers from passing to Jubbulpoor by that route; he\r\nfeared lest his 52d should yield to the influence of pernicious example.\r\nSeuni was a small civil station, nearly midway between Jubbulpoor and\r\nNagpoor, and about eighty miles distant from each; while Kamptee was a\r\ncantonment of Madras regulars, eleven miles north of Nagpoor. The four\r\nplaces named, in fact, stand nearly in a line north and south, and\r\ninterpose between the Mahratta states and Lower Bengal. Mr Plowden at\r\nNagpoor, Major Erskine at Jubbulpoor, and Brigadier Prior at Kamptee,\r\nthereupon concerted measures for preserving, so far as they could, that\r\nregion of India from disturbance; they all three agreed that\r\n‘tranquillity will be most effectually secured by crushing disaffection\r\nbefore it approaches too near to agitate men’s minds dangerously.’ One\r\nconsequence of this arrangement was, that a force was sent on the 13th\r\nto Seuni, under Major Baker; consisting of the 32d native infantry, a\r\nsquadron of the 4th light cavalry, a squadron of irregular cavalry, and\r\nthree field-guns.\r\n\r\nThe Europeans at Jubbulpoor were not allowed to pass through the month\r\nof June without many doubts and anxieties. The native troops, though not\r\nactually in mutiny, were seized with a mingled feeling of fear and\r\nexasperation when European troops were mentioned; they were in perpetual\r\napprehension, from the countless rumours at that time circulating\r\nthroughout India, that Europeans were about to approach and disarm them,\r\nas degraded and distrusted men. Jubbulpoor is a large thriving town,\r\nwhich at the time of the mutiny contained a small cantonment for native\r\ntroops, and a political agency subsidiary to that at Saugor. On one\r\noccasion, this report of the approach of European troops seized so\r\nforcibly on the minds of the sepoys, that the subadar-major, a trusted\r\nand influential man, lost all control over them; and they were not\r\nsatisfied until their English colonel allowed two or three from each\r\ncompany to go out and scour the country, to satisfy themselves and the\r\nrest whether the rumour were true or false. On another occasion, one of\r\nthe sepoys rose with a shout of ‘Death to the Feringhees,’ and\r\nendeavoured to bayonet the adjutant; but his companions did not aid him;\r\nand the authorities deemed it prudent to treat him as a madman, to be\r\nconfined and not shot. When troops were marched from Kamptee to Seuni,\r\nin accordance with the arrangements mentioned in the last paragraph, the\r\nsepoys at Jubbulpoor were at once told of it, lest their excited minds\r\nshould be again aroused on the subject of Europeans. Some of the English\r\nofficers felt the humiliation involved in this kind of petting and\r\npampering; but danger was around them, and they were obliged to\r\ntemporise. A few ladies had been sent to Kamptee; all else remained with\r\ntheir husbands, seldom taking off their clothes at night, and holding\r\nthemselves ready to flee at an hour’s warning. Such a state of affairs,\r\nthough less perilous, was almost as mentally distressing as actual\r\nmutiny. As the month drew to a close, and the perpetual anxiety and\r\nexpectation were becoming wearisome to all, the Europeans resolved to\r\nfortify the Residency. This they did, and moreover stored it with six\r\nmonths’ provision for about sixty persons, including thirty ladies and\r\nchildren; and for several civilians, who had also to be provided for.\r\n\r\nSaugor was placed in some such predicament as Jubbulpoor; its European\r\nofficers had much to plan, much to execute, to enable them to pass\r\nsafely through the perils of the month of June. This town, the capital\r\nof the province in political matters, possessed a military cantonment on\r\nthe borders of a lake on which the town stands; a large fort, which had\r\nbeen converted into an ordnance depôt; and a population of fifty\r\nthousand souls, chiefly Mahrattas. At the time of the outbreak,\r\nBrigadier Sage commanded the Saugor district force, and had under him\r\nthe 31st and 42d native infantry regiments, a regiment of native\r\ncavalry, and about seventy European gunners. The fort, the magazine, and\r\nthe battering-train were at one end of the cantonment; an eminence,\r\ncalled the Artillery Hill, was at the other end, three miles off; and\r\nthe brigadier felt that if mutiny should occur, he would hardly be able\r\nto hold both positions. During many minor transactions in the district,\r\nrequiring the presence of small detachments from Saugor, the temper of\r\nthe troops was made sufficiently manifest; sometimes the 31st shewed bad\r\nsymptoms, sometimes the 42d; two or three men were detected in plans for\r\nmurdering their officers; and petty rajahs in the district offered the\r\nsepoys higher pay if they would change their allegiance. The European\r\ninhabitants of Saugor becoming very uneasy, the brigadier cleared out\r\nthe fort, converted it into a place of refuge for women and children,\r\nsupplied it with useful furniture and other articles, and succeeded in\r\nsupplanting sepoys by Europeans in guard of the fort, the magazine, and\r\nthe treasury. The fort being provisioned for six months, and the guns\r\nsecured, Brigadier Sage felt himself in a position to adopt a resolute\r\ntone towards the native troops, without compromising the safety of the\r\nnumerous persons congregated within it—comprising a hundred and thirty\r\nofficers and civilians, and a hundred and sixty women and children, all\r\nthe Europeans of the place. Thus ended June. It may simply be added\r\nhere, that during the early part of the following month, the 31st and\r\n42d regiments had a desperate fight, the former willing to be faithful,\r\nand the latter to mutiny. The brigadier, not feeling quite sure even of\r\nthe 31st, would not place either his officers or his guns at their\r\nmercy, but he sent out of the fort a few men to aid them. The irregular\r\ncavalry joined the 42d; but both corps were ultimately beaten off by the\r\n31st—to carry wild disorder into other towns and districts.[26]\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling on minor mutinies at Dumoh and other places in the\r\nSaugor province, we will transfer our attention northward to Bundelcund;\r\nwhere Jhansi was the scene of a terrible catastrophe, and where riot and\r\nplunder were in the ascendant throughout the month of June. Bundelcund,\r\nthe country of the Bundelas, affords a curious example of the mode in\r\nwhich a region became in past times cut up into a number of petty\r\nstates, and then fell in great part into British hands. It is a strip of\r\ncountry, about half the size of Scotland, lying south or southwest of\r\nthe Jumna, and separated by that river from the Doab. The country was in\r\nthe hands of the Rajpoots until the close of the fourteenth century;\r\nwhen another tribe, the Bundelas, began a system of predatory incursions\r\nwhich led to their ultimate possession of the whole tract. Early in the\r\nlast century there was a chief of Western Bundelcund tributary to the\r\nGreat Mogul, and another in Eastern Bundelcund supported by the\r\nMahrattas against that sovereign. How one chief rose against another,\r\nand how each obtained a patch of territory for himself, need not be\r\ntold; it was only an exemplification of a process to which Asiatics have\r\nbeen accustomed from the earliest ages. About the close of the century,\r\nthe East India Company began to obtain possession here, by conquest or\r\nby treaty; and in 1817, after a war with the Mahrattas, a large increase\r\nwas made in this ownership. These are matters needful to be borne in\r\nmind here; for, though the country is but small, it now contains five or\r\nsix districts belonging to the British, and nine native princedoms or\r\nrajahships; besides numerous petty jaghires or domains that may in some\r\nsense be compared to the smallest states of the Germanic confederation.\r\nAt the time of the mutiny, the British districts were managed under the\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces; while the ‘political\r\nsuperintendence,’ as it was called, of the native states was in the\r\nhands of an agent appointed by, and directly responsible to, the\r\ngovernor-general. With the principal native states, of which Jhansi was\r\none, the British government had engagements, varying on minor points\r\naccording to circumstances, but all recognising its supremacy, and\r\nbinding the dependent state to the relinquishment of all political\r\nrelations except with the superior power. Some were tributary; some\r\nexempt from that obligation. The chief towns in the portion of\r\nBundelcund belonging to the British are Jhansi, Banda, and Jaloun.\r\n\r\nBundelcund, we have said, was the scene of much outrage, especially at\r\nJhansi. This town, lying on the main route from Agra to Saugor, was much\r\nfrequented in the last century by caravans of merchants who traded\r\nbetween the Doab and the Deccan; and it is still a prosperous commercial\r\nplace, rendered conspicuous by the castellated residence of the former\r\nrajahs. The Jhansi mutiny was not followed by so many adventures and\r\nwanderings as that at other places—for a very mournful reason; nearly\r\nall the Europeans were at once put to death. A fort in the town had been\r\npreviously supplied with food and ammunition, and had been agreed on as\r\na place of refuge in time of danger. Major Skene and Captain Gordon,\r\ncivil officers of the Company, received information which tended to shew\r\nthat a petty chieftain near Jhansi was tampering with the troops; and\r\nCaptain Dunlop, in command there, made what defensive preparations he\r\ncould. Besides the fort in the town, there was one called the Star Fort\r\nin the cantonment, containing the guns and the treasure. The native\r\ntroops—portions of the 12th infantry and of the 14th irregular cavalry,\r\nand a few artillery—rose on the afternoon of the 4th of June, seized the\r\nStar Fort, and shot at all the officers in the cantonment; many were\r\nkilled, and the rest ran to the Town Fort, which they barricaded as well\r\nas they were able. The little garrison of Europeans then prepared for a\r\nsiege; but it could be only of short duration, as the place was too weak\r\nto contend against the rebel besiegers. Musketry and sword-cuts (for the\r\ngarrison often met their assailants hand to hand at the gates) brought\r\ndown many; and some of the civilians, who tried to escape disguised as\r\nnatives, were caught by the insurgents and killed. At last, when\r\nCaptains Dunlop and Gordon, and many other officers had fallen, and when\r\nthe remaining Europeans had become disheartened, by the scarcity of\r\nammunition and of food, Major Skene accepted terms offered to him, on\r\noath—that the whole of the garrison should be spared if he opened the\r\ngate and surrendered. The blood-thirsty villains soon shewed the value\r\nof the oath they had taken. They seized all—men, women, and children—and\r\nbound them in two rows to ropes, the men in one row and the women and\r\nchildren in the other. The whole were then deliberately put to death;\r\nthe poor ladies stood with their infants in their arms, and their elder\r\nchildren clinging to their gowns; and when the husbands and fathers had\r\nbeen slaughtered, then came the other half of the tragedy. It is even\r\nsaid that the innocent children were cut in halves before their mothers’\r\neyes. One relief, and one only, marked the scene; there was not, so far\r\nas is known, torture and violation of women as precursors of death. The\r\ndeath-list was a sad one. Skene, Dunlop, Gordon, Ryves, Taylor,\r\nCampbell, Burgess, Turnbull—all were military officers in the Company’s\r\nservice, employed either on military or civil duties; and all were\r\nkilled. Twenty-four civil servants and non-commissioned officers\r\nlikewise met with their death; and most painful of all, nineteen ladies\r\nand twenty-three children were butchered by the treacherous miscreants.\r\nMr Thornton, the collector for a district between Jhansi and Cawnpore,\r\nwas afterwards in a position to inform the government that the mutinous\r\ntroops intended to have left Jhansi after they had captured the\r\ntreasure; that a Bundelcund chieftainess, the Ranee of Jhansi, wishing\r\nto regain power in the district, bribed them with large presents to take\r\nthe fort and put all the Europeans to death before they finally departed\r\nfor Delhi; and that it was thus to a _woman_ that was due the inhuman\r\nslaughtering of more than forty European ladies and children. One\r\naccount, that reached the ears of officers at other stations, was to the\r\neffect that when Major Skene became aware of the miscreant treachery, he\r\nkissed his wife, shot her, and then shot himself, to avert apprehended\r\natrocities worse than death; while another narrative or rumour\r\nrepresented the murderers as having chopped off the heads of the\r\nvictims, instead of merely shooting them; but, in truth, the destruction\r\nwas so complete that scarcely one was left to tell the tale except\r\nnatives, who contradicted each other in some of the particulars.\r\n\r\nJhansi of course soon became a prey to lawless marauders; while the\r\nmutineers marched off to Delhi or elsewhere. Lieutenant Osborne, at\r\nRewah, was placed in a difficult position at that time. Rewah is a small\r\nRajpoot state, ruled by a native rajah, who is bound by treaties with\r\nthe British government, and who has a British agent as resident at his\r\ncourt. Rewah was nearly surrounded by mutinous districts, such as\r\nBenares, Allahabad, Futtehpoor, Jhansi, Saugor, and Jubbulpoor; and it\r\nbecame a difficult problem for Lieutenant Osborne, the British agent,\r\nhow to keep wild disorder away from that place. On the 8th of June, by\r\nan energetic use of his influence, he was able to announce that the\r\nMaharajah of Rewah had placed his troops at the disposal of the\r\ngovernment; that the offer had been accepted; and that eight hundred of\r\nthose troops, with two guns, had been sent off to Ummapatan, a place\r\nwhich commanded the roads to Jubbulpoor, Nagode, and Saugor—ready to\r\noppose insurgents from any of those towns, and to intercept\r\ncommunication with other mutinous towns on the Jumna. He also sent\r\neleven hundred of the Maharajah’s troops, with five guns, to Kuttra\r\nPass: a spot whence a rapid advance could be made to Benares, Chunar, or\r\nMirzapore, according as military exigencies might render desirable. A\r\nweek later, he obtained permission from the Maharajah to send seven\r\nhundred troops to Banda; and at the same time to issue a proclamation,\r\npromising rewards to any of his soldiers who should distinguish\r\nthemselves by their gallantry and fidelity. With no higher military rank\r\nthan that of lieutenant did this active officer thus lay plans, not only\r\nfor the peace of the Rewah territory itself, but also in aid of the\r\nCompany’s officers all around him. His position at a later date was very\r\nperilous.\r\n\r\nIf the destruction of life was less at Nowgong than at Jhansi, the\r\nproceedings of mutinous troops were followed by much more adventure and\r\nvaried interest. Nowgong or Nowgaon is situated about a hundred miles\r\nsoutheast of the last-named town, but, like it, in the Bundelcund\r\nterritory. At the beginning of June there were stationed at that place\r\nabout four hundred men of the 12th native infantry, and rather over two\r\nhundred of the 14th irregular cavalry—wings of the same two regiments as\r\nat Jhansi; together with a company of the 9th battalion of artillery,\r\nand a light field bullock-battery. Major Kirke, commanding the station,\r\nhad in earlier weeks often discussed the cartridge question with his\r\nmen, and believed he had removed from their minds all misgivings on that\r\nunfortunate subject. Nevertheless, as June approached, the major deemed\r\nthe appearance of affairs so suspicious, that he made such precautionary\r\narrangements as were practicable to resist an outbreak. Bungalows were\r\nnow and then discovered to be in flames, without any means of detecting\r\nthe incendiaries. When the atrocities at Meerut and elsewhere became\r\nknown, the troops stationed at Nowgong made ardent demonstrations of\r\nloyalty—so ardent, that Kirke almost upbraided himself for his momentary\r\ndistrust of them; the infantry embraced their colours, the artillery\r\nembraced their guns, and all asserted their burning desire to chastise\r\nthe rebels who had proved faithless to the Company Bahadoor. So late as\r\nthe 6th of June, even while whisperings and ominous signs were passing\r\nbetween them, these unreliable men sent in a grandiloquent petition, in\r\nwhich they said: ‘As it is necessary to avenge the government on those\r\ncowardly rascals who now, in Delhi and other places, are exciting\r\nrebellion, and for which purpose many European regiments are being\r\ndespatched; we, hearing of this, are exceedingly desirous that we be\r\nsent as volunteers to chastise these scoundrels. And that we may shew\r\nfrom our hearts our faithfulness, we are ready to go wherever sent’—and\r\nmore to the same purpose. This petition or address was presented to\r\nMajor Kirke by the wing of the 12th regiment. On that same day news\r\narrived that the other wing of the same regiment had mutinied at Jhansi;\r\nand the Neemuch men, either with childish indecision or with profound\r\nduplicity, sent off a letter to them, reproving them for their\r\ninsubordination! On the 10th, a petition was presented by the commandant\r\nof the artillery (4th company, 9th battalion), couched in similar\r\nlanguage; demanding that the artillery might be sent against the rebels;\r\n‘in order,’ as the petition averred, ‘that we may fulfil the wish of our\r\nhearts by shewing our bravery and loyalty.’\r\n\r\nNever were words uttered more hollow and treacherous. By nightfall on\r\nthat same 10th of June, the native troops at Nowgong were nearly all\r\nrebels, and the Europeans nearly all fugitives. A few hours sufficed to\r\nshew the English officers that they were powerless to contend against\r\ntheir opponents. Flight commenced. The officers and civilians, with\r\ntheir families, and Europeans of humbler station, all took their\r\ndeparture from Nowgong—some in buggies, some on horseback, and some on\r\nfoot; but all equally reft of their worldly property. Were it not that\r\nthis Chronicle has already contained examples, mournfully numerous, of\r\nsimilar wanderings over the scorching roads and through the thick jungle\r\nof India, the fate of the Nowgong party might afford materials for a\r\nvery exciting narrative; but with the reader’s experience on this\r\nmatter, a few lines of description will suffice. The party was a large\r\none. It comprised Major Kirke, Captain Scot, Lieutenants Townshend,\r\nJackson, Remington, Ewart, Franks, and Barber, about forty other\r\nEuropeans of both sexes and all ages, and about ninety sepoys of the\r\nmutinous infantry, who had not joined their brethren. The fugitives\r\nlessened in number every day; some or other of them sank under the heat\r\nand fatigue; while the sepoys deserted when they approached towns where\r\ninsurgents were in the ascendant. Either collectively or separately the\r\nwanderers found themselves on different days at Chutterpore, at\r\nLogassee, at Churkaree, at Mahoba, at Callingurh, at Kabrai, at\r\nBanda—places mostly belonging to petty rajahs of Bundelcund. The\r\nprincipal survivors of the party were about ten or twelve days on the\r\nroads and fields, before they reached friendly quarters at Banda. On one\r\noccasion they were attacked by a band of marauders, and had to buy\r\nsecurity with rupees; on another, their sepoys were seized with a panic,\r\nand ran off in large numbers; on a third, a body of matchlockmen\r\nsuddenly confronted them, and shot down Lieutenant Townshend. On one\r\npart of the journey, Captain Scot found himself in the midst of a\r\ndistressing group of women and children: having poor Townshend’s horse\r\nwith him, he loaded both horses with as many as he could carry; but it\r\nmade him heart-sick to see the others fall away one by one, utterly\r\nbroken down by fatigue, and with insufficient men to help them along—for\r\nthe flight appears to have been wanting in every semblance of\r\norganisation. A bandsman’s wife dropped dead through a sun-stroke; then\r\nan artillery sergeant, worn out, went into a hut to die. Captain Scot\r\ncame up with a lady and her child, reeling along the road as if\r\ndelirious; he readjusted his horse-load, took up the fugitives, and the\r\nlady very speedily died in his arms. Shortly after this a fine hale\r\nsergeant-major sank, to rise no more; Major Kirke died through a\r\nsun-stroke; and others dropped off in a similar way. Dr Mawe died from\r\nillness and fatigue; and then his wife, while laving her blistered feet\r\nin a pool, was set upon by ruffians and robbed of the little she had\r\nabout her. Captain Scot, after many changes in his horse-load, took up\r\nDr Mawe’s child; and ‘little Lotty,’ of two years’ old, seemed to him a\r\nblessing rather than a burden; for on the few occasions when he met\r\nfriendly natives, their friendship was generally gained for him by the\r\nsight of the little girl, whose head he endeavoured to shield from the\r\nburning sun by a portion of his shirt—the only resource for one who had\r\nlost both hat and coat, and whose own head was nearly driven wild by the\r\nintense solar heat. It is pleasant to know that the captain and ‘little\r\nLotty’ were among the few who reached a place of safety.\r\n\r\nBanda was another of the stations affected; but the details of its\r\ntroubles need not be traced here. Suffice it to say that, on the 14th of\r\nJune, there was a mutiny of a detachment of native infantry, and a few\r\ntroops belonging to the Nawab of Banda—a titular prince, possessing no\r\npolitical power, but enjoying a pension from the Company, and having a\r\nsort of honorary body-guard of native troops. The officers and their\r\nfamilies were at first in great peril; but the nawab aided them in\r\nmaking a safe retreat to Nagode. On the 16th of June, Major Ellis had to\r\nannounce to the government that his station at Nagode was beginning to\r\nbe filled with anxious fugitives from Banda, Futtehpoor, Humeerpoor, and\r\nAmeerpoor; comprising military officers, magistrates, salt-agents,\r\nrevenue servants, railway officials, and private persons. Twenty-eight\r\nof these fugitives arrived on one day. He sent to many petty chieftains\r\nof Bundelcund, who were pensioners under the Company or had treaties\r\nwith it, to exert themselves to the utmost in recovering all property\r\nseized during the events of the preceding two or three days in the Banda\r\ndistrict. Major Ellis at Nagode, and Mr Mayne at Banda, applied\r\nearnestly to Calcutta for military assistance; but they were told\r\nplainly that none could be sent to them, every European soldier being\r\nneeded in the Ganges and Jumna regions.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary, on removing the scene further to the west, to\r\nknow something concerning the Mahrattas, their relations to the two\r\ngreat families of Scindia and Holkar, the conventions existing between\r\nthose two families and the British government, and the military\r\narrangements of the Mahratta territories at the time of the outbreak.\r\nThese matters can be rendered intelligible without any very lengthened\r\nhistorical narrative.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Emperor Aurungzebe, a century and a half ago,\r\nIndia was distracted and impoverished by the contentions of his sons and\r\ndescendants; each of whom, in claiming the throne, secured the\r\npartisanship of powerful nobles, and the military aid of fighting-men in\r\nthe pay of those nobles. A civil war of terrible kind was the natural\r\nresult; and equally natural was it that other chieftains, in nowise\r\nrelated to the imperial family, should take advantage of the anarchy to\r\nfound dynasties for themselves. One such chieftain was Sevajee, a\r\nMahratta in the service of the King of Bejapore, in the southern part of\r\nIndia. The Mahrattas were (and are) a peculiar tribe of Hindoos, more\r\nfierce and predatory than most of their fellow-countrymen. Long before\r\nEuropeans settled in India, the Mahrattas were the chief tribe in the\r\nregion north, south, and east of the present city of Bombay. After many\r\nstruggles against the competitors for the throne of Delhi, the Mahrattas\r\nwere left in possession of a sovereign state, of which Satara and Poonah\r\nwere the chief cities. From 1707 till 1818, the nominal sovereign or\r\nrajah of the Mahrattas had no real power; he was a sort of state or\r\nhonorary prisoner, confined in the hill-fortress of Satara; while the\r\ngovernment was administered by the Peishwa or prime minister, whose\r\noffice became hereditary in a particular family, and whose seat of\r\ngovernment was at Poonah. After many Peishwas had held this singular\r\nkind of sovereignty at the one city—the nominal rajah being all the time\r\npowerless at the other—circumstances occurred which led to an\r\nintermeddling of the East India Company with Mahratta politics, followed\r\nby the usual results. Narrain Rao Peishwa was murdered in 1773; many\r\nrelations of the murdered man competed for the succession; and as the\r\nCompany greatly desired to possess the island of Salsette and the town\r\nof Bassein, at that time belonging to the Mahrattas, it was soon seen\r\nthat this wish might be gratified by aiding one competitor against\r\nanother. Battles and intrigues followed, ending in the possession of the\r\ntwo coveted places by the British, and in the appointment of a British\r\nresident at the Peishwa’s court at Poonah. Thus matters remained until\r\n1817, when the Peishwa engaged in intrigues with other Mahratta chiefs\r\nagainst the British; a course that led to his total overthrow after a\r\nfew fierce contests in the field. The Mahratta sovereignty at Poonah was\r\nentirely put an end to, except a small principality assigned to the\r\nRajah of Satara, the almost forgotten representative of the founder of\r\nthe Mahratta rule. The British took all the remaining territory,\r\npensioning off the Peishwa; and as to Satara, after several rajahs had\r\nreigned, under the close control of the British resident at that city,\r\nthe principality ‘lapsed’ in 1848, in default of legitimate male heirs—a\r\nlapse that led to the preparation of many ponderous blue books\r\nconcerning the grievances and complaints of a certain adopted son of the\r\nlast rajah.\r\n\r\nThus much for the south Mahratta country, having Poonah and Satara for\r\nits chief cities; but the British have had fully as much to do with the\r\nnorthern portion of the Mahratta region, represented by the two cities\r\nof Gwalior and Indore, and held by the two great Mahratta families of\r\nScindia and Holkar. As the Peishwas in past years cared little for the\r\nnominal head of the Mahrattas at Satara, so did the Scindias and Holkars\r\ncare little for the Peishwas. Each chieftain endeavoured to become an\r\nindependent sovereign. The Scindia family is traceable up to the year\r\n1720, when Ranojee Scindia was one of the dependents of the Peishwa.\r\nFrom that year, by predatory expeditions and by intrigues, the\r\nsuccessive heads of the Scindia family became more and more\r\npowerful—contending in turn against the Mogul, the Rajpoots, the\r\nPeishwa, and the British; until at length, in 1784, Madhajee Scindia was\r\nrecognised as an independent sovereign prince, with the hill-fortress of\r\nGwalior as his stronghold and seat of government. In 1794, when Madhajee\r\ndied, the Scindia dominions extended from beyond Delhi on the north to\r\nnear Bombay on the south, and from the Ganges to Gujerat—a vast region,\r\nheld and acquired by means as atrocious as any recorded in the history\r\nof India. Early in the present century, the power of the Scindia family\r\nreceived a severe check. Hostilities having broken out with the British,\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington) defeated Dowlut Rao\r\nScindia at Assaye in 1803, while Lord Lake drove the Mahrattas from the\r\nwhole of the Doab. Many desperate wars occurred in later years, ending,\r\nin 1844, by a treaty which left Bajerut Rao Scindia king or rajah of a\r\nstate barely equalling England in area, with Gwalior as his capital. A\r\ncontingent or body of troops was to be supplied by him for the service\r\nof the British, beyond which he was permitted to have an independent\r\narmy of nine thousand men; and there were numerous minor details which\r\ngave much influence to the British resident at Gwalior.\r\n\r\nOf the family of Holkar, almost the same account may be given as of that\r\nof Scindia; inasmuch as it has sprung from a Mahratta leader who\r\nacquired power a century and a half ago. The city of Indore has always\r\nbeen the centre of dominion belonging to this family—a dominion\r\nextending over a very wide region at some periods, but greatly\r\ncontracted in recent times. The ruler of the Indore territory at the\r\ntime of the mutiny was one Mulkerjee Holkar, who had been appointed by\r\nthe Calcutta government at a time of disputed succession, in such a way\r\nas to imply that the territory might pass into British hands whenever\r\nthe Company chose. Holkar’s territory is now much smaller than\r\nScindia’s, scarcely exceeding Wales in area.\r\n\r\nIt will suffice, then, to bear in mind that the southern Mahratta power,\r\nthat of the courts of Poonah and Satara, had wholly fallen into British\r\nhands before the time of the mutiny; and that the northern power, held\r\nby the courts of Gwalior and Indore, extended over a country no larger\r\nthan England and Wales united. Nevertheless, considering that that\r\nportion of central India is bounded by Bundelcund, the Doab, Rajpootana,\r\nGujerat, the Nizam’s dominions, and the Saugor and Nerbudda territories,\r\nit was of much importance to the British that Scindia and Holkar should\r\nremain faithful to their alliances at a critical period.\r\n\r\nAlthough Nuseerabad is properly in Rajpootana, of which a few words of\r\ndescription will be given shortly, the mutiny at that place may\r\nconveniently be treated here; because it was a link in a chain which\r\nsuccessively affected Neemuch, Indore, Mhow, and Gwalior.\r\n\r\nNuseerabad is near Ajmeer, the chief town of a British district\r\nsurrounded by the dominions of independent or semi-independent rajahs.\r\nAjmeer, though far smaller than most of the principal cities in India,\r\nis an ancient and important place, about two hundred and sixty miles\r\nsouthwest of Delhi; at the time of the mutiny, it was the seat of a\r\nBritish political agency; and in a ruined palace of the Emperor Akbar,\r\nconverted into an arsenal, was a powder-magazine. Nuseerabad, fifteen\r\nmiles from Ajmeer, may be regarded as the military station for that\r\ncity, and for the neighbouring British districts; it had an extensive\r\nand well-laid-out cantonment, and was the head-quarters of the corps\r\nknown as the Rajpootana Field-force. Nuseerabad had been nearly drained\r\nof troops early in the year, on account of the Persian expedition; but\r\nthis gap was afterwards partially filled up. In the month of May there\r\nwere at the station the 1st regiment Bombay lancers, the 15th and 30th\r\nBengal native infantry, and the 2d company of the 7th battalion of\r\nBengal native artillery. An instructive fact was made manifest; the\r\nBombay troops remained faithful, while those of the Bengal army became\r\nfirst restless, then mutinous, then murderous. Unfortunately, the good\r\nwere not strong enough to coerce the bad; the Bombay lancers numbered\r\nonly two hundred and fifty sabres. The month of May had not closed when\r\nthe disturbances at Nuseerabad began. The officers had been nightly in\r\nthe habit of sleeping with revolvers and swords near at hand; while the\r\nBombay lancers patrolled the cantonment—so suspicious were the symptoms\r\nobserved. On the evening of the 28th a servant rushed into the bungalow\r\nof one of the lieutenants of the 15th infantry, announcing that the\r\nregiment had risen. The officers hastened to the lines, and there found\r\nthe regiment drawn up in companies—the martial array being maintained in\r\nmutiny as it had been in regular drill. The men looked sternly at their\r\nofficers; and soon worse news arrived. The native artillerymen who\r\nworked the six guns joined the revolters—not actually firing on the\r\nofficers, but ready to do so. The Englishmen connected with the two\r\nregiments were a mere handful; they were powerless, for none of the\r\nsepoys would aid them against the rest. Colonel Penny, in command of the\r\nBombay lancers, instantly hastened down, armed and mounted his troopers,\r\nand drew them up into position. Galloping to the artillery lines, and\r\nfinding the guns pointed against him, he immediately ordered a charge\r\nfor capturing them, each troop charging in succession. Captain\r\nSpottiswoode began, and soon fell mortally wounded; other officers led\r\nsubsequent charges, but the guns could not be taken. Penny then felt\r\nobliged to relinquish this attempt, and to hold himself in readiness to\r\ncheck the mutineers in other ways; but as the two regiments of native\r\ninfantry refused to listen to their officers, nothing was left but\r\nflight. Cornet Newberry, as well as Captain Spottiswoode, fell while\r\ncharging; Colonel Penny became suddenly ill and died in a few hours;\r\nwhile two or three other officers were wounded. How perilous were those\r\ncavalry-charges against the six guns may be judged from a letter written\r\nby one of the officers: ‘I galloped towards the guns, and must have been\r\neighty or a hundred yards from them when I began to experience the\r\nunpleasant sensation of bullets whizzing past my head, and saw a lot of\r\nsepoys taking shots at me as I came along. I immediately turned my\r\npony’s head, and endeavoured to retreat under cover of a wall which ran\r\nin front of the artillery lines. Here I saw more men running up with the\r\nkind intention of having a crack at me; so I had to keep along the\r\nparade-ground right in the line of fire, and had one or two men popping\r\nat me from over the wall on my right. My tât (pony) went as fast as ever\r\nhe could go, and, thanks be to God, carried me back in perfect\r\nsafety.... Off we started towards the cavalry lines amid showers of\r\nbullets. I dodged round the first bell of arms; and as I passed the\r\nbells, saw three or four men behind each, who deliberately shot at us as\r\nwe passed.’ The ladies had been sent off from the station just in time.\r\nThe surviving officers joined them beyond the cantonment about\r\nnightfall, and then all hastened away. They rode forty miles during the\r\nnight, on roads and fields and rocky hills, and reached a place of\r\nsafety, Beaur or Beawur, towards noon—hungry, tired, and reft of\r\neverything but the clothes on their backs.\r\n\r\nAs this small body of Bombay native cavalry remained stanch when the\r\nBengal troops were faithless all around them, it was deemed right to\r\nmake some public acknowledgment of the fact. Lord Elphinstone, as\r\npresident or governor of Bombay, issued a general order on the subject,\r\nthanking the troopers, and passing lightly over the fact that a few of\r\nthem afterwards disgraced themselves.[27] The commander-in-chief\r\nafterwards ordered the report of the transaction by Captain Hardy, who\r\ntook the control of the lancers when Colonel Penny died, to be\r\ntranslated into the Hindustani and Mahratta languages, and read to all\r\nthe regiments of the Bombay native army, as an encouragement to them in\r\nthe path of duty. After the English officers and their families had\r\nescaped to Beaur, the mutinous troops made off towards Delhi. Nuseerabad\r\nbeing considered an important station in regard to the control of the\r\nsurrounding districts, a force was sent to reoccupy it towards the end\r\nof June; comprising a detachment of H.M. 83d foot, another of the 20th\r\nBombay native infantry, another of the Jhodpore legion, and a squadron\r\nof the 2d Bombay cavalry—Nuseerabad being sufficiently near Bombay to\r\nderive advantages not possessed by stations further east.\r\n\r\nThe usual consequences of the revolt of native regiments followed.\r\nNuseerabad furnished a bad example to Neemuch. As a village, Neemuch is\r\nof small consequence; as a military station, its importance is\r\nconsiderable. During some of the negotiations with Scindia in past\r\nyears, it was agreed that the British should have a cantonment at this\r\nspot, which is on the confines of Malwah and Mewar, about three hundred\r\nmiles southwest of Agra; a force in British pay was to be stationed\r\nthere, by virtue of certain terms in a treaty, and a small district,\r\nwith the village in the centre, was made over to the Company for this\r\npurpose. The cantonment thereupon built was two or three miles long by a\r\nmile in width, and comprised the usual native infantry lines, cavalry\r\nlines, artillery lines, head-quarters, offices, bungalows, bazaar,\r\nparade-ground, &c. There was also a small fort or fortified square\r\nbuilt, as a place of refuge for the families of the military when called\r\nto a distance on duty.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of June, the troops stationed at Neemuch comprised the\r\n72d Bengal N. I., the 7th regiment of Gwalior infantry, two troops of\r\nthe 1st Bengal light cavalry, and a troop of horse-artillery. Every\r\neffort had been made in the early weeks of the mutiny to insure the\r\nconfidence of these troops, and prevent them from joining the standard\r\nof rebellion. Colonel Abbott, and most of the officers of the 72d, as\r\nwell even as some of their families, slept within the sepoy lines, to\r\nwin the good-will of the men by a generous confidence. One wing (three\r\ncompanies) of the Gwalior troops held the fortified square and treasury;\r\nwhile the other wing (five companies), now quartered in a vacant\r\nhospital, about a quarter of a mile distant, was encamped just outside\r\nthe walls; Captain Macdonald, the chief officer, residing with the\r\nfirst-named wing. Colonel Abbott, who commanded the station generally,\r\nas well as the 72d regiment in particular, became convinced, on the\r\nmorning of the 2d of June, that all the hopeful expectations of himself\r\nand brother-officers were likely to be dashed; for the troops at Neemuch\r\nhad heard of the mutiny at Nuseerabad, and could be restrained no\r\nlonger. While the superintendent, Captain Lloyd, hastened to secure some\r\nof the Company’s records and accounts, and to open a line of retreat for\r\nfugitives along the Odeypore road, Colonel Abbott made such military\r\narrangements as were practicable on the spur of the moment. The colonel\r\nbrought his native officers together, and talked to them so earnestly,\r\nthat he induced them to swear, ‘on the Koran and on Ganges water,’ that\r\nthey would be true to their salt; while he, at their request, swore to\r\nhis confidence in their faithful intentions. This singular compact, in\r\nwhich Mohammedans, Hindoos, and a Christian swore according to the\r\nthings most solemn to them respectively, remained unbroken for\r\ntwenty-four hours; who broke it, after that interval, will at once be\r\nguessed. During many preceding days, a panic had prevailed in the Sudder\r\nBazaar; incendiary fires occurred at night; great numbers of persons had\r\nremoved with their property; the wildest reports were set afloat by\r\ndesigning knaves to increase the distrust; and the commonest occurrences\r\nwere distorted into phantoms of evil intended against the troops. At\r\nlast, on the night of the 3d, the troops threw off their oath and their\r\nallegiance at once. The artillery, disregarding Lieutenant Walker’s\r\nentreaties and expostulations, fired off two guns; the cavalry, on\r\nhearing this signal, rushed out to join them; and the 72d broke from\r\ntheir lines immediately afterwards. Captain Macdonald instantly ordered\r\ninto the fort the one wing of the Gwalior regiment which had been\r\nencamped outside, under Lieutenants Rose and Gurdon; and then prepared\r\nfor defence. A bold and singular expedient had just before been adopted\r\nby the civil superintendent; he authorised Macdonald to promise to the\r\nGwalior troops, if they faithfully defended the fort during any mutiny\r\noutside, a reward of a hundred rupees to each sepoy or private, three\r\nhundred to each naik or corporal, five hundred to each havildar or\r\nsergeant, higher sums to the jemadars and subadars, and five thousand\r\nrupees to the senior native officer, or to the one who should most\r\ndistinguish himself in preserving the loyalty of the regiment. These are\r\nlarge sums to the natives of India; and the superintendent must have\r\nconsidered long and fully before he promised the Company’s money in such\r\na manner. All was, however, in vain. The Gwalior troops remained\r\nfaithful under the temptation of this promise for a short time; but at\r\nlength, headed by a subadar named Heera Singh, they demanded that the\r\ngates of the fort should be opened, and requested that the officers\r\nwould make arrangements for their own safety. Macdonald, Rose, Gurdon,\r\nand other officers of the Gwalior regiment, expostulated with their men;\r\nbut entreaty was now of no avail; the troops forcibly opened the gates,\r\nand the officers took their departure when the last vestige of hope had\r\nbeen destroyed.\r\n\r\nOf the flight, little need be said; it was such a flight as almost every\r\nprovince in Northern India exhibited in those sad days. Some of the\r\nladies and children had been sent off a few hours earlier, hurried away\r\nwith no preparations for their comfort or even their sustenance; while\r\nothers waited to accompany their husbands or fathers. Very few had\r\neither horses or vehicles; they laboured on footsore to Baree, to Chota\r\nSadree, to Burra Sadree, to Doogla—straggling parties meeting and\r\nseparating according as their strength remained or failed, and all\r\ndependent on the villagers for food. At Doogla, where they arrived on\r\nthe third night, the officers strengthened a sort of mud-fort about\r\nforty yards square, within which forty persons were huddled. After being\r\nmuch straitened, they were relieved by Brigadier Showers on the 9th. The\r\nfugitive party now broke up; some returned to Neemuch, which the\r\nmutineers had abandoned; but the greater number went to Odeypore, the\r\nrana of which place gave them a hospitable reception; some of them\r\nafterwards went further west to Mount Aboo or Aboo Gurh—a celebrated\r\nplace of Hindoo pilgrimage to a sacred temple, and a sanatarium for the\r\nEuropeans stationed at the cantonment of Deesa, about forty miles\r\ndistant. Those of the party who returned to Neemuch, found everything\r\ndevastated, the bungalows and offices burnt, and the villagers stripped\r\nof their stores by the mutineers, who had afterwards started off for\r\nAgra. The officers and their families were literally beggars; they had\r\nlost their all. No Europeans were killed save the wife and three\r\nchildren of a sergeant, who could not leave Neemuch in time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fort of Mhow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus were lost to the British about fourteen hundred men and six guns at\r\nNuseerabad, and sixteen hundred men and six guns at Neemuch, all of\r\nwhich went to swell the insurgent forces inside Delhi or outside Agra.\r\n\r\nThe stations of Indore and Mhow must now engage a little of our\r\nattention—situated nearly south of Neemuch, and about four hundred miles\r\nfrom Agra. Indore, as has already been stated, is the capital of\r\nHolkar’s Mahratta dominions. It is an ill-built place, standing on the\r\nsmall river Kutki, and is less than a century old: the original Indore,\r\nor Jemnah, being on the opposite side of the river. Holkar’s palace is a\r\nbuilding possessing few attractions; and the like may be said of the\r\nother native structures. The relation existing at that time between\r\nIndore and Mhow was this—that Indore was the residence of the British\r\npolitical agent at the court of Holkar; whereas Mhow, thirteen miles\r\ndistant, was the military station or cantonment. The house of the\r\nBritish agent, and those of the other Europeans, were on the eastern\r\nside of the town. The agent, at the time of the mutiny, had an escort of\r\ncavalry and infantry at his disposal; but it was simply an escort, not a\r\nregular military force. The agent, in addition to his duties connected\r\nwith Holkar’s court, was the immediate representative of the British\r\ngovernment in relation to various petty states under its protection, but\r\nin other points differing greatly in their circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Indore agent in May and June was Colonel Durand. All was peaceful at\r\nthat place, although much agitation was visible, until the 1st of July;\r\non which day mutiny occurred. Holkar’s troops rose against the English,\r\nwithout, as it afterwards appeared, the privity or the wish of the\r\nMaharajah himself. Two companies, set apart for the protection of the\r\nResidency in the bazaar square, brought two guns to bear upon the\r\nbuilding; and the Europeans were horror-stricken at finding themselves\r\nsuddenly exposed to cannon and musketry. Fortunately a few men of the\r\nBhopal Contingent under Colonel Travers, were on duty at the Residency;\r\nand a few of these remained faithful long enough to allow the colonel\r\nand the other European officers, with their families, to escape. Not so\r\nthe civilians, however; many of the civil servants, and of the clerks in\r\nthe telegraph department, with their wives and children, were butchered\r\nin cold blood. As soon as Holkar heard of the outbreak, he ordered some\r\nof his own Mahratta troops to hasten to the Residency and aid Colonel\r\nDurand; but they told him it was a matter of _deen_ (religion), and that\r\nthey could not act against their brethren. During the next three days\r\nHolkar was almost a prisoner in his own palace; his troops rose in\r\nrevolt, and were speedily joined by those from Mhow, presently to be\r\nmentioned; they plundered the treasury, the Residency, and many parts of\r\nthe town; but as he would not countenance their proceedings, they at\r\nlength marched off towards Gwalior. This affair at Indore led to the\r\nflight of many European families, amid great misery. They collected\r\nhastily a few ammunition-wagons, two or three bullock-carts, an\r\nelephant, and some horses, and started off towards Sehore and\r\nHosungabad; escorted by a portion of the Bhopal Contingent from several\r\nsmall stations in that part of India.\r\n\r\nAn important question arose—how was Mhow affected by the mutinous\r\nproceedings? As the news of the Nuseerabad mutiny had thrown the troops\r\nat Neemuch into agitation, so did the subsequent events at Neemuch\r\nimmediately affect the sowars and sepoys at Mhow.[28] Mhow contained a\r\nsquadron of the same cavalry regiment, the 1st B. N. C., two troops of\r\nwhich had mutinied at Neemuch; and in addition to these was the 23d\r\nregiment native infantry, and a company of European artillery. Mhow\r\npresented much the appearance of an English town; having a steepled\r\nchurch on an eminence, a spacious lecture-room, a well-furnished\r\nlibrary, and a theatre; the cantonment was large and well appointed; and\r\na force was maintained there in virtue of one of the treaties made with\r\nHolkar. This relates to the station or British part of the town; the\r\nsmall native town of Mhow is a mile and a half distant. The excitement\r\ncaused at this station by the news from Neemuch was visible in the\r\nconduct of the troops throughout the whole of the month of June. Colonel\r\nPlatt and the other officers, however, kept a vigilant watch on them,\r\nand by combined firmness and kindness hoped to surmount the difficulty.\r\nCaptain Hungerford afterwards stated that such had been the excessive\r\nconfidence of some of the officers in their respective regiments, that\r\nhe could not induce them to strengthen the fort or fortified square, by\r\noccupying it with their artillery, until almost the last hour before the\r\nRevolt. The fortified square had for some time, however, been a\r\nrendezvous for all the ladies and children, who slept within it; the\r\nofficers remaining in the lines. Thus matters passed until the 1st of\r\nJuly, when Colonel Platt received a pencil-note from Colonel Durand,\r\nannouncing that the Residency at Indore had been attacked by Holkar’s\r\nsoldiers, and that aid was urgently needed. A troop of cavalry and a few\r\nguns were immediately despatched from Mhow; but when they had reached\r\nwithin four miles of Indore, news arrived that the Europeans yet living\r\nat that station were about to effect a retreat; upon which the small\r\nforce returned to Mhow. This duty the troops performed, but it was the\r\nlast they rendered. The colonel, fearing the arrival of mutinous sepoys\r\nfrom Indore, but not suspecting his own men, made such arrangements as\r\nseemed to him befitting, bringing a European battery of artillery into\r\nthe fort. Soon did the crisis arrive. At eleven o’clock on that same\r\nnight the plans and hopes were cruelly disappointed; that terrible yell\r\nwas heard which so often struck dismay into the hearts of the Europeans\r\nat the various military stations: the yell of native troops rising in\r\nmutiny. Lieutenant Martin, adjutant of the cavalry, while quietly\r\nconversing with one of the troopers, became the victim of that dastardly\r\nfellow; the war-cry arose, and the trooper turned round and shot the\r\nunfortunate officer without a moment’s warning. The other officers,\r\nhearing the report, but not suspecting the real truth, thought that\r\nHolkar’s Mahrattas had arrived; they rushed forward to head their\r\nrespective companies and troops, but sepoys and sowars alike opened fire\r\non them. The officers, now rendered painfully aware of their critical\r\nposition, ran swiftly across the parade towards the fort, having no time\r\nto mount their horses; and it is a marvel that only one of the number,\r\nMajor Harris, commandant of the cavalry, was shot by the heavy fire\r\npoured on them during this run. Colonel Platt, who was in the fort, was\r\nalmost incredulous when the breathless officers rushed in; he could with\r\ndifficulty believe the truth now presented to his notice—so fully had he\r\nrelied on the fidelity of the men. Colonel Platt and Captain Fagan rode\r\ndown to the lines of the 23d, to which regiment they both belonged, to\r\nascertain the real facts and to exhort the men; but they were never seen\r\nalive again by their brethren in arms; they fell, riddled with bullets\r\nand gashed with sword-cuts. Captain Hungerford, of the artillery,\r\nbrought two guns to bear on the mutineers, which gradually drove them\r\nfrom the lines, but not before they had fired the regimental mess-house\r\nand several bungalows; and during the darkness of night, plunderers\r\ncarried off everything that was valuable. Hungerford would have followed\r\nthe mutineers with his guns; but the roads were too dark for the\r\npursuit, and the Europeans too unprotected to be left. The remaining\r\nEnglish officers, having now no troops to command, acted as a cavalry\r\nguard in support of the European battery in the fortified square, under\r\nCaptain Hungerford. As all the civilians, women, and children were in\r\nthis place; as the square itself was quite unfitted for a long defence;\r\nand as only five native soldiers out of the whole number remained with\r\nthe officers—the prospect was precarious enough: nevertheless all did\r\ntheir best; Hungerford collected in a few days a large store of\r\nprovisions, and routed many of the insurgents in neighbouring villages.\r\nThe impulses that guided the actions of the sepoys were strangely\r\ninconsistent; for two of the men saved the life of Lieutenant Simpson,\r\nwho had been on outpost-duty on the fatal night, and brought him safely\r\ninto the fort; and yet, though offered promotion for their fidelity,\r\nthey absconded on the following morning to join their mutinous\r\ncompanions. The Europeans, about eighty in number, maintained their\r\nposition at Mhow, until a force from Bombay arrived to reoccupy all that\r\nregion. The ladies, there as everywhere, strove to lessen rather than\r\nincrease the anxieties of their male companions. One of the officers\r\nthus shut up in the extemporised stronghold said in a letter:\r\n‘Throughout all this I cannot express the admiration I feel at the way\r\nthe ladies have behaved—cheerful, and assisting in every way in their\r\npower. Poor things, without servants or quarters, huddled together; they\r\nhave had to do everything for themselves, and employ all their time in\r\nsewing bags for powder for the guns, well knowing the awful fate that\r\nawaits them if the place is taken. There has not been a sign of fear;\r\nthey bring us tea or any little thing they can, and would even like to\r\nkeep watch on the bastions if we would let them.... You should see the\r\nstate we are in—men making up canister, ladies sewing powder-bags,\r\npeople bringing plunder recovered, artillery mounting guns; all of us\r\ndirty and tired with night-watching; we mount sentry-duty to take the\r\nweight of it off the artillerymen, and snatch sleep and food as we can.’\r\n\r\nMany other stations in that part of India were disturbed in June and\r\nJuly by the mutinies of wings and detachments of regiments too small in\r\namount to need notice here. At one place, Asseerghur, Colonel Le\r\nMesurier warded off mutiny by a prompt and dexterous manœuvre, for which\r\nhe received the marked thanks of the government.\r\n\r\nGwalior now comes under notice, in relation to a mutiny of troops at\r\nthat place, and to the conduct of Scindia, the most important of the\r\nMahratta chieftains. Considered as a city or town (about sixty-five\r\nmiles south of Agra), Gwalior is not very important or interesting,\r\nbeing irregularly built and deplorably dirty, and possessing few public\r\nbuildings of any note. It is for its hill-fortress that Gwalior is so\r\nfamed. The rock on which the fortress stands is an elongated mass, a\r\nmile and a half long by a quarter of a mile in width, and reaching in\r\nsome places to a height of about three hundred and fifty feet. It is\r\nentirely isolated from other hills; and—partly from the natural\r\nstratification of the sandstone, partly from artificial construction—is\r\nin many parts quite perpendicular. A rampart runs round the upper edge,\r\nconforming to the outline of the summit. The entrance to the enclosure\r\nwithin the rampart is near the north end of the east side; in the lower\r\npart by a steep road, and in the upper part by steps cut in the rock,\r\nwide enough to permit elephants to make the ascent. A high and massive\r\nstone-wall protects the outer side of this huge staircase; seven\r\ngateways are placed at intervals along its ascent; and guns at the top\r\ncommand the whole of it. Within the enclosure of the rampart is a\r\ncitadel of striking appearance, an antique palace surmounted by kiosks,\r\nsix lofty round towers or bastions, curtains or walls of great thickness\r\nto connect those towers, and several spacious tanks. It is considered\r\nthat fifteen thousand men would be required to garrison this fortress\r\ncompletely. So striking is this rock, so tempting to a chieftain who\r\ndesires a stronghold, that Gwalior is believed to have been a fortress\r\nduring more than a thousand years. It has been captured and recaptured\r\nnearly a dozen times, by contending Hindoos and Mohammedans, in the\r\ncourse of centuries. The last celebrated contest there was in 1779, when\r\nthe Company’s forces captured it through a clever and unexpected use of\r\nladders and ropes during a dark night. In the next sixty-five years it\r\nwas possessed successively by the British, the Jâts, the Mahrattas, the\r\nBritish again, the Mahrattas again, and finally by the British,\r\naccording to the intricacies of treaties and exchanges. Since 1844,\r\nGwalior has been the head-quarters of a corps called the Gwalior\r\nContingent, commanded by British officers; and thus the hill-fortress\r\nhas virtually been placed within the power of the British government.\r\nBesides this famous stronghold, there is at Gwalior a place called the\r\nLashkar. This, in former times, was the stationary camp of the Maharajah\r\nScindia—a dirty collection of rude buildings, extending to a great\r\ndistance from the southwest foot of the rock; but the great reduction in\r\nthe number of troops allowed to be held independently by Scindia has\r\nmaterially lessened the importance of the Lashkar.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of Scindia became a question of very anxious importance at\r\nthe time of the mutinies. Holkar was possessor of a much smaller\r\nterritory than Scindia; and yet, when a rumour spread that the rising at\r\nIndore on the 1st of July had the sanction of the first-named sovereign,\r\nnumerous petty chieftains in that part of India rose against the\r\nBritish, and prepared to cut off all retreat for Europeans. It was not\r\nuntil Holkar had given undoubted evidence of his hostility to the\r\nmutineers, that these movements were checked. Much more was this\r\nrendered manifest in Scindia’s dominions. If Scindia had failed us, the\r\nmutineers from Neemuch, Nuseerabad, and Jhansi, by concentrating at\r\nGwalior, might have rendered that hill-fortress a second Delhi to the\r\nBritish. Scindia and Holkar both remained steady; it was the Contingents\r\nthat failed. These contingents were bodies of native troops, paid by the\r\nnative princes of the states or countries whose name they bore, but\r\norganised and officered by the British, in the same way as the ordinary\r\nbattalions of the sepoy army. If the native princes, for whose defence\r\nostensibly, and at whose expense really, these contingents were\r\nmaintained, wished and were permitted to have any independent military\r\nforce of their own, that could only be done additionally to the\r\ncontingent which they were bound to furnish. As a consequence of this\r\ncurious system, a distinction must be drawn between the contingent\r\ntroops and the prince’s troops. At Indore, Holkar’s little army as well\r\nas Holkar’s contingent proved hostile to the British. Scindia was in\r\nlike manner paymaster for a double force; and the British often\r\nanxiously pondered whether one or both of these might prove faithless at\r\nGwalior, with or without the consent of Scindia himself. The Gwalior\r\nContingent, though connected with a Mahratta state, consisted chiefly of\r\nHindustanis, like the sepoys of the Bengal army; the Mahrattas formed\r\nquite a minority of the number. The contingent consisted of all three\r\narms of the service—infantry, cavalry, and artillery—and formed a\r\ncompact army.\r\n\r\nThe disasters at Gwalior began on Sunday the 14th of June—as usual, on\r\nSunday. It will be remembered (p. 112) that Scindia, three or four weeks\r\nearlier, had offered the aid of his own body-guard, which had been\r\naccepted by Mr Colvin at Agra; that a portion of the Gwalior Contingent\r\n(cavalry) was also sent; that this contingent, under Lieutenant\r\nCockburn, was actively engaged against the insurgents in the region\r\nbetween Agra and Allygurh; and that about one-half of the troopers\r\ncomposing it revolted on the 28th of May, placing that gallant officer\r\nin a very embarrassing position. They were portions of the same\r\ncontingent that mutinied at Neemuch and one or two other places; and on\r\nthis account the European inhabitants at Gwalior were subject to much\r\nanxiety—knowing that that station was the head-quarters; and that,\r\nalthough the contingent was paid for by the Maharajah, the troops had\r\nbeen raised mostly in Oude, and, being disciplined and officered by the\r\nBritish, were likely to share the same sentiments as the Oudians and\r\nother Hindustanis of the Bengal army elsewhere. The Maharajah had little\r\nor no influence over them; for neither were they his countrymen, nor had\r\nhe any control over their discipline or movements. During fourteen\r\nyears, as boy, youth, and man, he had been in great measure a pupil\r\nunder the British resident at Gwalior; and if he remained an obedient\r\npupil, this was nearly all that could be expected from him—shorn, as the\r\nMahratta court was, of so much of its former influence. Dr Winlow Kirk,\r\nsuperintending surgeon of the contingent, placed upon record, ten days\r\nbefore the bloody deed which deprived him of life, a few facts relating\r\nto the position of the Europeans at Gwalior in the latter part of May\r\nand the beginning of June. The resident received information which led\r\nhim to believe that the contingent—seven regiments of infantry, two of\r\ncavalry, and four batteries of artillery—was thoroughly disaffected,\r\nboth the main body at Gwalior and the detachments elsewhere. The\r\nbrigadier commandant shared this opinion with the resident; and, as a\r\nprecautionary measure, all the ladies were sent from the station to the\r\nResidency, a distance of six miles, on the 28th of May. Dr Kirk, and\r\nmost of the military officers, dissented from this opinion; they thought\r\nthe troops were behaving in a respectful manner, and they offered to\r\nsleep among the men’s lines to shew their confidence in them. On the\r\n29th and 30th, the ladies returned to cantonment, much to the apparent\r\ndelight of the sepoys at the generous reliance thus placed in them.\r\nBitter was the disappointment and grief in store for those who had\r\ntrusted these miscreants.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 14th of June, we have said, that the uprising at Gwalior\r\nbegan. The Europeans had long wished for the presence of a few English\r\ntroops; but as none were to be had, they watched each day’s proceedings\r\nrather anxiously. At nine o’clock in the evening of the disastrous\r\nSunday, the alarm was given at the cantonment; all rushed out of their\r\nrespective bungalows, and each family found others in a similar state of\r\nalarm. Shots were heard; officers were galloping or running past; horses\r\nwere wildly rushing with empty saddles; and no one could give a precise\r\naccount of the details of the outbreak. Then occurred the sudden and\r\nmournful disruption of family ties; husbands became separated from their\r\nwives; ladies and children sought to hide in gardens and grass, on\r\nhouse-tops and in huts. Then arose flames from the burning bungalows;\r\nand then came bands of reckless sepoys, hunting out the poor homeless\r\nEnglish who were in hiding. On the morning of that day, Dr Kirk,\r\nalthough he had not shared the resident’s alarm seventeen days before,\r\nnevertheless thought with some anxiety of the ladies and children, and\r\nasked what arrangements had been made for their safety in the event of\r\nan outbreak; but the officers of the regiments, most of whom relied\r\nfully on their men, would not admit that there was any serious need for\r\nprecautionary measures. Two of these unfortunate officers, Major Blake\r\nand Major Hawkins, were especially trustful; and these were two among\r\nthe number who fell by the hands of their own men that very night.\r\nCaptain Stewart, with his wife and child, were killed, as also Major\r\nSheriff. Brigadier Ramsey, and several others, whose bungalows were on\r\nthe banks of a small river, escaped by fording. Dr Kirk was one of those\r\nwho, less fortunate, were furthest from the river. With Mrs Kirk and his\r\nchild, he hid in the garden all night; in the morning they were\r\ndiscovered; Mrs Kirk was robbed without being otherwise ill treated; but\r\nher husband was shot dead before her eyes. Thus fell an amiable and\r\nskilful man, who for nearly twenty years had been a medical officer of\r\nthe Company—first with the Bundelcund legion in Sinde; then as a medical\r\nadviser to Sir Charles Napier on matters connected with the health of\r\ntroops in that sandy region; then with the Bengal troops at Bareilly;\r\nthen with the European artillery at Ferozpore; and lastly, as\r\nsuperintending surgeon to the troops of the Gwalior Contingent, who\r\nshewed their gratitude for his medical aid by putting him to death.\r\nAfter this miserable sight, Mrs Kirk begged the murderers to put an end\r\nto her also; but they replied: ‘No, we have killed you already’—pointing\r\nto the dead body of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this story need not be told in detail. Agra was the place of\r\nrefuge sought by those who had now to flee; and it is some small\r\nalleviation of the crimes of the mutineers that they allowed the ladies\r\nand children to depart—with their lives, but with little else. How the\r\npoor things suffered during five days of weary journeying, they could\r\nthemselves hardly have told; hunger, thirst, heat, illness, fatigue, and\r\nanxiety of mind accumulated on them. Many arrived at Agra without shoes\r\nor stockings; and all were beggared of their worldly possessions when\r\nthey reached that city. When, shortly afterwards, Lieutenant Cockburn\r\nwrote to private friends of this event, he had to tell, not only of his\r\nown mortification as the officer of a disloyal corps, but of the wreck\r\nsuffered by the British station at Gwalior. ‘I fear there is no chance\r\nof my ever recovering any of your portraits; for the ruffians invariably\r\ndestroy all they cannot convert into silver or gold. All our beautiful\r\ngarden at Gwalior, on which I spent a good deal of money and care, has\r\nbeen dug up; our houses have been turned into cattle-sheds; there is not\r\na pane of glass in the station; our beautiful church has been gutted,\r\nthe monuments destroyed, the organ broken up, the stained-glass windows\r\nsmashed, and the lovely floor of encaustic tiles torn up. The\r\ndesecration of the tombs is still more horrible; in many places the\r\nremains of our countrymen have been torn from the earth, and consigned\r\nto the flames!’\r\n\r\nThe position of Scindia was sufficiently embarrassing at that time. As\r\nsoon as the troops of the contingent had murdered or driven away their\r\nofficers, they went to him, placed their services at his disposal, and\r\ndemanded that he would lead them against the British at Agra. There were\r\neight or ten thousand men in the contingent altogether, and his own\r\nMahratta army was little less numerous; it was therefore a matter of\r\ncritical importance to the English that he remained steady and faithful.\r\nHe not only refused to sanction the proceedings of the mutineers, but\r\nendeavoured to prevent them from marching towards Agra. In this he\r\nsucceeded until an advanced period of the autumn; for the troops that\r\ntroubled Agra at the end of June and the beginning of July were those\r\nfrom Mhow and Neemuch, not the larger body from Gwalior. These mutineers\r\nproceeded towards Agra by way of Futtehpore or Futhepore Sikri—a town\r\nfamed for the vast expanse of ruined buildings, erected by Akbar and\r\ndestroyed by the Mahrattas; for the great mosque, with its noble gateway\r\nand flight of steps; and for the sumptuous white marble tomb,\r\nconstructed by Akbar in memory of a renowned Mussulman ascetic, Sheik\r\nSelim Cheestee.[29] The battle that ensued, and the considerations that\r\ninduced Mr Colvin to shut up himself and all the British in the fort at\r\nAgra, will be better treated in a later page.\r\n\r\nMany of the events treated in this chapter occurred in, or on the\r\nfrontiers of, the region known as Rajpootana or Rajasthan—concerning\r\nwhich a few words may be desirable. The name denotes the land of the\r\nRajpoots. These Hindoos are a widely spread sept of the Kshetrigas or\r\nmilitary caste; but when or where they obtained a separate name and\r\ncharacter is not now known. Some of the legends point to Mount Aboo as\r\nthe original home of the Rajpoots. They were in their greatest power\r\nseven hundred years ago, when Rajpoot princes ruled in Delhi, in Ajmeer,\r\nin Gujerat, and in other provinces; but the Mohammedan conquerors drove\r\nthem out of those places; and during many centuries the region mainly\r\nbelonging to the Rajpoots has been nearly identical with that exhibited\r\nat the present time. This region, situated between Central India and\r\nSinde, is about twice as large as England and Wales. Warlike as the\r\nRajpoots have ever been, and possessing many strongholds and numerous\r\nforces, they were no match for the Mahrattas in the last century; indeed\r\nit was this inequality that led to the interference of the British, who\r\nbegan to be the ‘protector’ of the Rajpoot princes early in the present\r\ncentury. This protection, insured by various treaties, seems to have\r\nbeen beneficial to the Rajpoots, whose country has advanced in industry\r\nand prosperity during a long continuance of peace. The chief Rajpoot\r\nstates at present are Odeypore or Mewar, Jeypoor, Jhodpore or Joudpore,\r\nJhallawar, Kotah, Boondee, Alwur, Bikaneer, Jeysulmeer, Kishengurh,\r\nBanswarra, Pertabghur, Dongurpore, Kerowlee, and Sirohi. The treaties\r\nwith these several states, at the time of the mutiny, were curiously\r\ncomplicated and diverse: Odeypore paid tribute, and shared with the\r\nCompany the expense of maintaining a Bheel corps; Jeypoor, though under\r\na rajah, was virtually governed by a British resident; Jhodpore, under a\r\nsort of feudal rule, paid tribute, and maintained a Jhodpore legion\r\nbesides a force belonging to the feudatories; Kotah bore the expense of\r\na corps called the Kotah Contingent, organised and officered by the\r\nBritish; Jeysulmeer gave allegiance in return for protection, and so did\r\nKishengurh and many other of the states included in the above list. Most\r\nof the Rajpoot states had a feudal organisation for internal affairs;\r\nand most of them maintained small native corps, in addition to the\r\ncontingents furnished by three or four under arrangements with the\r\nBritish. For the whole of the Rajpoot states collectively an agent was\r\nappointed by the governor-general to represent British interests, under\r\nwhom were the civil officers at various towns and stations; while the\r\nmilitary formed a Rajpootana Field-force, with head-quarters at\r\nNuseerabad.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme north of Rajpootana is a small British district named\r\nHurrianah, of which the chief towns are Hansi and Hissar. A military\r\ncorps, called the Hurrianah Light Infantry Battalion, mutinied a few\r\nweeks after the Meerut outbreak, killing Lieutenant Barwell and other\r\nEuropeans; the men acted in conjunction with a part of the 4th regiment\r\nirregular cavalry, and, after a scene of murder and pillage, marched off\r\ntowards Delhi. At Bhurtpore, on the northeast frontier of Rajpootana, a\r\nsimilar scene was exhibited on a smaller scale; a corps called the\r\nBhurtpore Levies revolted against Captain Nixon and other officers,\r\ncompelling them to flee for their lives: the mutineers, as in so many\r\nother instances, marching off at once towards Delhi. There were other\r\nmutinies of small detachments of native troops, at minor stations in the\r\nMahratta and Rajpoot countries, which need not be traced in detail.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vast region in the centre of India has thus passed rapidly under\r\nreview. We have seen Hindustanis, Bundelas, Jâts, Mahrattas, Bheels,\r\nRajpoots, and other tribes of India revolting against English authority;\r\nwe have seen native princes and chiefs perplexed how to act between the\r\nsuzerain power on the one hand, and the turbulent soldiery on the other;\r\nwe have seen that soldiery, and the attendant rabble of marauders,\r\ninfluenced quite as much by love of plunder as by hate of the Company’s\r\nraj; we have seen British officers sorely wounded at heart by finding\r\nthose men to be traitors whom they had trusted almost to the last hour;\r\nwe have seen ladies and children driven from their bungalows, and hunted\r\nlike wild beasts from road to river, from jungle to forest; and lastly,\r\nin this vast region, we have tracked over considerably more than a\r\nthousand miles of country in length without meeting with a single\r\nregiment of British troops. The centre of India was defended from\r\nnatives by natives; and the result shewed itself in deplorable colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Girls at the Ganges.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  A curious example was afforded, in relation to the affairs of Saugor,\r\n  of the circuitous manner in which public affairs were conducted in\r\n  India, when different officials were residing in different parts of\r\n  that vast empire. The brigadier commanding the Saugor district adopted\r\n  a certain course, in a time of peril, concerning the management of the\r\n  troops under his command. He sent information of these proceedings to\r\n  Neill at Allahabad (300 miles). Neill forwarded the information to\r\n  Calcutta (500 miles). The military secretary to the government at\r\n  Calcutta sent a dispatch to the adjutant-general of the army outside\r\n  Delhi (900 miles), requesting him to ‘move’ the commander-in-chief to\r\n  send a military message to Saugor (400 miles), calling upon the\r\n  officer of that station to explain the motives for his conduct in the\r\n  matter at issue. The explanation, so given, was to be sent 400 miles\r\n  to Delhi, and then 900 miles to Calcutta; and lastly, if the conduct\r\n  were not approved, a message to that effect would be sent, by any\r\n  route that happened to be open for dâk, from Calcutta to Saugor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  ‘To mark the approbation with which he has received this report, the\r\n  Right Honourable the Governor in Council will direct the immediate\r\n  promotion to higher grades of such of the native officers and men as\r\n  his Excellency the Commander-in-chief may be pleased to name as having\r\n  most distinguished themselves on this occasion, and thereby earned\r\n  this special reward; and the Governor will take care that liberal\r\n  compensation is awarded for the loss of property abandoned in the\r\n  cantonment and subsequently destroyed, when the Lancers, in obedience\r\n  to orders, marched out to protect the families of the European\r\n  officers, leaving their own unguarded in cantonment.\r\n\r\n  ‘By a later report the Governor in Council has learned with regret\r\n  that eleven men of the Lancers basely deserted their comrades and\r\n  their standards, and joined the mutineers; but the Governor in Council\r\n  will not suffer the disgrace of these unworthy members of the corps to\r\n  sully the display of loyalty, discipline, and gallantry which the\r\n  conduct of this fine regiment has eminently exhibited.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  It is well to observe, for the aid of those consulting maps, that\r\n  there are five or six towns and villages of this name in India.

It will now be necessary, however, to obtain a\r\nfew general notions on the following points—the geographical position of\r\nthe Punjaub; the national character of the Sikhs as the chief\r\ninhabitants; the transactions which rendered the British masters of that\r\ncountry; and the circumstances that enabled Sir John Lawrence at once to\r\nhold the Punjaub intact and to aid the besiegers of Delhi. Of Sinde, a\r\nstill shorter account will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe name Punjaub is Persian; it signifies ‘five waters;’ and was given\r\nin early days to the region between the five rivers Indus, Jelum,\r\nChenab, Ravee, and Sutlej. Tho Punjaub is somewhat triangular in shape,\r\nextending from the Himalaya and Cashmere as a northern base to an apex\r\nwhere the five rivers have all coalesced into one. It is about equal in\r\narea to England and Scotland without Wales. The northern part is rugged\r\nand mountainous; the southern almost without a hill, comprising the\r\nseveral ‘Doabs’ between the rivers. The natural facilities for inland\r\nnavigation and for irrigation are great; and these, aided by artificial\r\nchannels, render the Punjaub one of the most promising regions in India.\r\nIf the Beas, an affluent of the Sutlej, be added to the five rivers\r\nabove named, then there are five Doabs or tongues of land between the\r\nsix rivers, named severally the Doabs of Jullundur, Baree, Rechna,\r\nJetch, and Sinde Sagur, in their order from east to west. The Baree\r\nDoab, between the rivers Beas and Ravee, is the most populous and\r\nimportant, containing as it does the three cities of Lahore, Umritsir,\r\nand Moultan.\r\n\r\nThe population of this country is a very mixed one; the Punjaub having\r\nbeen a battle-ground whereon Hindoos from the east and Mohammedans from\r\nthe west have often met; and as the conquerors all partially settled on\r\ntheir conquests, many races are found in juxtaposition, though each\r\nprevailing in one or other of the Doabs. For instance, the Afghans are\r\nmostly west of the Indus; the Sikhs, in the Baree Doab; and so on. The\r\ninhabitants exceed ten millions in number; nearly two-thirds of them are\r\nMohammedans—a very unusual ratio in India. The Sikhs, however, are the\r\nmost interesting constituent in this population. They are a kind of\r\nHindoo dissenters, differing from other Hindoos chiefly in these three\r\npoints—the renunciation of caste, the admission of proselytes, and the\r\npractice of the military art by nearly all the males. They trace their\r\norigin to one Nanac, who was born in 1469 in a village about sixty miles\r\nfrom Lahore; he founded a new religion, or a new modification of\r\nBrahminism; and his followers gave him the designation of _Guru_ or\r\n‘spiritual pastor,’ while they took to themselves that of _Sikhs_ or\r\n‘disciples.’ After many contests with the Mohammedans of the Punjaub,\r\nthe Sikhs ceased to have a spiritual leader, but acquired temporal\r\npower—some assuming the general surname or tribe-name of _Singh_ or\r\n‘lion,’ to denote their military prowess; while the rest became\r\n_Khalasas_, adherents to the more peaceful and religious doctrines of\r\nNanac. Some of the Singhs are Akalis, a sort of warlike priests. The\r\nSikhs are more robust than the generality of Hindoos, and more\r\nenterprising; but they are more illiterate, and speak a jargon composed\r\nof scraps from a multitude of languages.\r\n\r\nSuch being the country, and such the inhabitants, we have next to see\r\nhow the British gained influence in that quarter. From the eleventh\r\ncentury until the year 1768 the Mohammedans—Afghans, Gorians, Moguls,\r\nand other tribes—ruled in the Punjaub; but in that year the Sikhs, who\r\nhad gradually been growing in power, gained the ascendency in the region\r\neastward of the Jelum. At the close of the last century an adventurer,\r\nnamed Runjeet Singh, a Sikh of the Jât tribe, became ruler of the\r\ndistrict around the city of Lahore; and from that time the Sikh power\r\nwas in the ascendant. The Sikhs constituted a turbulent and irregular\r\nrepublic; holding, in cases of emergency, a parliament called the\r\nGuru-mata at Umritsir; but at other times engaged in petty warfare\r\nagainst each other. Runjeet Singh was ambitious of putting down these\r\ncompetitors for power. He built at Umritsir the great fort of\r\nGovindgurh, ostensibly to protect, but actually to overawe and control\r\nsome of the chieftains. In 1809 he crossed the Sutlej, and waged war\r\nagainst some of the Sikh chieftains of Sirhind who had obtained British\r\nprotection. This led, not to a war, but to a treaty; by which Runjeet\r\nagreed to keep to the west of the Sutlej, and the British not to molest\r\nhim there. This treaty, with a constancy rare in Asia, the chief of\r\nLahore respected throughout the whole of his long career: maintaining a\r\nfriendly intercourse with the British. In other directions, however, he\r\nwaged ruthless war. He conquered Moultan, then Peshawur, then the\r\nDerajat, then Cashmere, then Middle Tibet, then Little Tibet, and\r\nfinally became Maharajah of the Sikhs. In 1831 an interview, conducted\r\nwith gorgeous splendour, took place between Runjeet Singh and Lord\r\nAuckland, in which the governor-general strengthened the ties of amity\r\nwith the great Sikh. Runjeet died in 1839, and his son and grandson in\r\n1840. From that year a total change of affairs ensued; competitors for\r\nthe throne appeared; then followed warlike contests; and then a period\r\nof such excessive anarchy and lawlessness that British as well as Sikh\r\nterritory became spoliated by various chieftains. War was declared in\r\n1845, during which it required all the daring and skill of the victors\r\nat Moodkee, Ferozshah, Aliwal, and Sobraon, to subdue the fierce and\r\nwarlike Sikhs. This was ended by a treaty, signed in March 1846; but the\r\ntreaty was so frequently broken by the chieftains, that another war\r\nbroke out in 1848, marked by the battles of Moultan, Chillianwalla, and\r\nGujerat. Then ended the Sikh power. The British took the Punjaub in full\r\nsovereignty, dated from the 29th of March 1849. Commissioners were\r\nappointed, to organise a thoroughly new system of government; and it was\r\nherein that Sir Henry Lawrence so greatly distinguished himself. In less\r\nthan three years from that date, the progress made towards peaceful\r\ngovernment was so great, that the court of directors enumerated them in\r\na eulogistic dispatch to the governor in council. The progress was one\r\nof uninterrupted improvement from 1849 to 1857; and it will ever remain\r\na bright page in the East India Company’s records that, finding the\r\nPunjaub a prey to wild licence and devastating intrigues, the Company\r\nconverted it into a peaceful and prosperous country. The reward for this\r\nwas received when the rest of Northern India was in a mutinous state. It\r\nmay here be stated that, when the Punjaub was annexed, a distinct\r\narrangement was made with Cashmere. This interesting country, almost\r\nburied among the Himalaya and its offshoots, is one of the few regions\r\nin India which have suffered more from natural calamities than from the\r\nravages of man; its population has been diminished from eight hundred\r\nthousand to two hundred thousand in the course of thirty years, by a\r\ndistressing succession of pestilences, earthquakes, and famines. It was\r\ngoverned by Mohammedans during about five centuries; and was then held\r\nby the Sikhs from 1819 till the end of their power. Circumstances\r\nconnected with the annexation of the Punjaub led to the assignment of\r\nCashmere as a rajahship to Gholab Singh, one of the Sikh chieftains; he\r\nwas to be an independent prince, subsidiary to the British so far as\r\nconcerned a contingent of troops. The two Tibets were abandoned by the\r\nSikhs before the date when British sovereignty crossed the Sutlej.\r\n\r\nFor administrative purposes, the Punjaub has been separated into eight\r\ndivisions—Lahore, Jelum, Moultan, Leia, Peshawur, Jullundur, Hoshyapoor,\r\nand Kangra; of which the Lahore division alone contains three millions\r\nand a half of souls. Each division comprises several revenue and\r\njudicial districts. For military purposes, the divisions are only two,\r\nthose of Lahore and Peshawur, each under a general commandant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR JOHN LAWRENCE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of May 1857, when the mutinies began, Sir John Lawrence,\r\nwho had been knighted for his eminent services while with his brother\r\nSir Henry, and had succeeded him as chief-commissioner in the Punjaub,\r\nwas absent from the capital of that country. He was at Rawul Pindee, a\r\nstation between Lahore and Peshawur; but happily he had left behind him\r\nmen who had learned and worked with his brother and himself, and who\r\nacted with a promptness and vigour worthy of all praise. To understand\r\nwhat was done, we must attend to the city and cantonment of Lahore. This\r\nfamous capital of the Punjaub is situated about a mile east of the river\r\nRavee. It contains many large and handsome buildings—such as the Padshah\r\nMosque, said to have been built by Aurungzebe, but converted into a\r\nbarrack by Runjeet Singh, who cared little about mosques; the Vizier\r\nKhan Mosque, once celebrated for its lofty minarets, but afterwards\r\ndesecrated by the Sikhs in being used as stables for horses and shambles\r\nfor swine; the Sonara Mosque; and many other Mohammedan mosques and\r\nHindoo temples. Beyond the limits of the city are the large and\r\nonce-magnificent tomb of the Emperor Jehanghire; the tomb of Anarkalli;\r\nand the exquisite garden of Shahjehan, the Shalimar or ‘House of Joy’—at\r\none time the pride of the Mussulmans of Lahore, with its three marble\r\nterraces and its four hundred marble fountains, but afterwards\r\nruthlessly despoiled of its marble by Runjeet Singh, to adorn Umritsir.\r\nLahore presents every trace of having been a much larger city before the\r\ntime of the Sikh domination; for the ruins of palaces, serais, and\r\nmosques spread over a great area. The city now contains about a hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, a great declension from its population in former\r\ndays. Considered in a military sense, Lahore is surrounded by a brick\r\nwall, formerly twenty-five feet high, but recently lowered. Runjeet\r\nSingh ran a trench round the wall, constructed a line of works, mounted\r\nthe works with many cannon, and cleared away many ruins. This line of\r\nfortification exceeds seven miles in circuit; and within the northwest\r\nangle is a fort or citadel, containing extensive magazines and\r\nmanufactories of warlike stores.\r\n\r\nFrom evidence educed at different times, it appears certain that many of\r\nthe native troops in the Punjaub were cognizant of a conspiracy among\r\nthe ‘Poorbeahs,’ by which name the sepoys of the eastern regions are\r\nknown to the inhabitants of the Punjaub; and that they held themselves\r\nready to join in any mutiny arising out of such conspiracy. How the\r\nauthorities checked this conspiracy, was strikingly shewn by the\r\nproceedings at different stations immediately after news arrived of\r\ndisaster in the eastern provinces. We will rapidly glance in succession\r\nat Lahore, Umritsir, Ferozpore, Jullundur, and Phillour; and will then\r\nproceed to the Peshawur region. The British military cantonment for the\r\ncity of Lahore was six miles distant, at a place called Meean Meer;\r\nwhere were stationed three native infantry regiments, and one of\r\ncavalry, the Queen’s 81st foot, two troops of horse-artillery, and four\r\nreserve companies of foot-artillery. In the fort, within the city-walls,\r\nwere half a native infantry regiment, a company of Europeans, and a\r\ncompany of foot-artillery. The plot, so far as concerned the Punjaub, is\r\nbelieved to have been this.[30] On a particular day, when one wing of a\r\nnative regiment at the fort was to be exchanged for another, there\r\nwould, at a particular moment, be about eleven hundred sepoys present;\r\nthey were to rise suddenly, murder their officers, and seize the gates;\r\ntake possession of the citadel, the magazine, and the treasury;\r\noverpower the Europeans and artillery, only a hundred and fifty men in\r\nall; and kindle a huge bonfire as a signal to Meean Meer. All the native\r\ntroops in cantonment were then to rise, seize the guns, force the\r\ncentral jail, liberate two thousand prisoners, and then commence an\r\nindiscriminate massacre of European military and civilians. The other\r\ngreat stations in that part of the Punjaub—Umritsir, Ferozpore,\r\nJullundur, Phillour—were all in the plot, and the native troops at these\r\nplaces were to rise in mutiny about the 15th of May. There were many\r\nproofs, in the Punjaub and elsewhere, that the plotters at Meerut began\r\na little too early for their own object; the scheme was not quite ripe\r\nat other places, else the English might have been almost entirely\r\nannihilated throughout the northern half of India.\r\n\r\nThe authorities at Lahore knew nothing of this plot as a whole, though\r\nthey possibly observed symptoms of restlessness among the native\r\ntroops. When the crisis arrived, however, they proved themselves equal\r\nto the difficulties of their position. On the 10th of May, the\r\noutbreak at Meerut occurred; on the 11th an obscure telegram reached\r\nLahore, telling of some disaster; on the 12th the real nature of the\r\naffair became known. Sir John Lawrence being at Rawul Pindee, the\r\nother authorities—Mr Montgomery, Mr M’Leod, Mr Roberts, Colonel\r\nMacpherson, Colonel Lawrence (another member of this distinguished\r\nfamily), Major Ommaney, and Captain Hutchinson—instantly formed a sort\r\nof council of war; at which they agreed on a plan, which was assented\r\nto by Brigadier Corbett, commandant of the station at Meean Meer. This\r\nplan was to consist in depriving the native troops of their ammunition\r\nand percussion-caps, and placing more Europeans within the fort. A\r\nnative officer in the Sikh police corps, however, revealed to the\r\nauthorities the outlines of a conspiracy which had come to his\r\nknowledge; and the brigadier then resolved on the complete disarming\r\nof the native regiments—a bold step where he had so few Europeans to\r\nassist him, but carried out with admirable promptitude and success. It\r\nso happened that a ball was to be given that night (the 12th) by the\r\nmilitary officers at Meean Meer; the ball _was_ given, but\r\npreparations of a kind very different from festive were at the same\r\ntime quietly made, wholly unknown to the sepoys. Early on the morning\r\nof the 13th, the whole of the troops, native and European, were\r\nordered on parade, avowedly to hear the governor-general’s order\r\nrelating to the affairs at Barrackpore, but really that the Europeans\r\nmight disarm the natives. After this reading, a little manœuvring was\r\nordered, whereby the whole of the native regiments—the 16th, 26th, and\r\n49th Bengal infantry, and the 8th Bengal cavalry—were confronted by\r\nthe guns and by five companies of the Queen’s 81st. At a given signal,\r\nthe sepoys were ordered to pile arms, and the sowars to unbuckle\r\nsabres; they hesitated; but grape-shot and port-fires were ready—they\r\nknew it, and they yielded. Thus were disarmed two thousand five\r\nhundred native troops, by only six hundred British soldiers. Meanwhile\r\nthe fort was not forgotten. Major Spencer, who commanded the wing of\r\nthe 26th stationed there, had the men drawn up on parade on the\r\nmorning of that same day; three companies of the 81st entered the fort\r\nunder Captain Smith; and these three hundred British, or thereabouts,\r\nfound it no difficult task to disarm the five or six hundred sepoys.\r\nThis done, the 81st and the artillery were quickly placed at such\r\nposts as they might most usefully strengthen—in the lines of the 81st,\r\non the artillery parade-ground, and in an open space in the centre of\r\nthe cantonment, where the brigadier and his staff slept every night.\r\nThe ladies and children were accommodated in the barracks; while the\r\nregimental officers were ordered to sleep in certain selected houses\r\nin the lines of their own regiments—regiments disarmed but not\r\ndisbanded; and professedly disarmed only as a matter of temporary\r\nexpediency. Thus was Lahore saved.\r\n\r\nUmritsir is the next station to which attention must be directed\r\nrelatively to the Punjaub. It was an important place to hold in due\r\nsubordination, not only on account of its size and population, but for a\r\ncertain religious character that it possesses in the eyes of the Sikhs.\r\nUmritsir or Amritsir has had a career of less than three centuries. In\r\n1581, Ram Das, the fourth _Guru_ or spiritual pastor of the Sikhs,\r\nordered a reservoir or fountain to be formed at a particular spot, and\r\nnamed it _Amrita Saras_, or ‘Fount of Immortality.’ This Amrita Saras or\r\nUmritsir at once became a place of pilgrimage, and around it gradually\r\ngrew up a considerable city. One of the Mohammedan sovereigns, Ahmed\r\nShah, uneasy at the increasing power of the Sikhs, sought to terrify and\r\nsuppress them by an act of sacrilege at Umritsir; he blew up a sacred\r\nshrine, filled up the sacred pool, and caused the site to be desecrated\r\nby slaughtering kine upon it. But he miscalculated. It was this very act\r\nwhich led to the supremacy of the Sikhs over the Mohammedans in the\r\nPunjaub; they purified and refilled the pool, rebuilt the shrine, and\r\nvowed unceasing hostility to the Mussulmans. At present, the holy place\r\nat Umritsir is a very large square basin, in which Sikhs bathe as other\r\nHindoos would do in the Ganges; and in the centre, on a small island, is\r\na richly adorned temple, attended by five hundred Akalis or armed\r\npriests. Considered as a city, Umritsir is large, populous, industrial,\r\nand commercial. The most striking object in it is the Govindgurh, the\r\nfortress which Runjeet Singh constructed in 1809, professedly to protect\r\nthe pilgrims at the sacred pool, but really to increase his power over\r\nthe Sikhs generally. Its great height and heavy batteries, rising one\r\nabove another, give it a very imposing appearance; and it has been still\r\nfurther strengthened since British occupation began.\r\n\r\nDirectly the unfavourable news from Meerut was received at Lahore, or\r\nrather immediately after the disarming at the last-named place had been\r\neffected—a company of H.M. 81st foot, under Lieutenant Chichester, was\r\nsent off in eckas to Umritsir, to strengthen the garrison at Govindgurh.\r\nIt was known that this fort was regarded almost in a religious light in\r\nthe Punjaub; and that if the Poorbeahs or rebellious sepoys should seize\r\nit, the British would be lowered in the eyes of the Sikhs generally. In\r\nthe fort, and in the cantonment near the town, were two companies of\r\nartillery, one European and one native; together with the 59th B. N. I.,\r\nand a light field-battery. The wing of the Queen’s 81st, despatched from\r\nLahore on the evening of the 13th of May, reached Umritsir on the\r\nfollowing morning; and a company of foot-artillery, under Lieutenant\r\nHildebrand, intended for Phillour, was detained at Umritsir until the\r\nauthorities should feel sure of their position. The officers of the 59th\r\nhad, some time previously, discussed frankly with their men the subject\r\nof the greased cartridges, and had encouraged them to hold a committee\r\nof inquiry among themselves; the result of which was a distinct avowal\r\nof their disbelief in the rumours on that unfortunate subject. It is\r\nonly just towards the regimental officers to say that the highest\r\nauthorities were as unable as themselves to account for the pertinacious\r\nbelief of the sepoys in the greased-cartridge theory; Sir John Lawrence\r\nspoke of it as a ‘mania,’ which was to him inexplicable. With the\r\nmiscellaneous forces now at hand, the authorities made no attempt to\r\ndisarm the native regiment, but kept a watchful eye on the course of\r\nevents. On the night of the 14th, an alarm spread that the native troops\r\nat Lahore had mutinied, and were advancing on Umritsir; the ladies and\r\nchildren were at once sent into the fort, and a small force was sent out\r\non the Lahore road, to check the expected insurgents; but the alarm\r\nproved to be false, and the troops returned to their quarters. Peace was\r\nsecured at Umritsir by the exercise of great sagacity. The Mohammedans\r\nwere strong in the city, but the Sikhs were stronger; and Mr Cooper, the\r\ndeputy-commissioner, succeeded in preventing either religious body from\r\njoining the other against the British—a task requiring much knowledge of\r\nthe springs of action among the natives in general. It was not the first\r\ntime in the history of India that the British authorities had deemed it\r\nexpedient to play off the two religions against each other.\r\n\r\nFerozpore was not so happily managed as Lahore and Umritsir in this\r\nexciting and perilous week; either because the materials were less\r\nsuitable to work upon, or because the mode of treatment was not so well\r\nadapted to the circumstances. Ferozpore is not actually in the Punjaub;\r\nit is one of the towns in Sirhind, or the Cis-Sutlej states—small in\r\nsize and somewhat mean in appearance, but important through its position\r\nnear the west bank of the Sutlej, and the large fort it comprises. In\r\nthe middle of May, this station contained H.M. 61st foot, the 45th and\r\n57th Bengal native infantry, the 10th Bengal native cavalry, about 150\r\nEuropean artillery, and one light-horse field-battery, with six\r\nfield-guns—a large force, not required for Ferozpore itself, but to\r\ncontrol the district of which it was the centre. Ferozpore had been the\r\nfrontier British station before the annexation of the Punjaub, and had\r\ncontinued to be supplied with an extensive magazine of military stores.\r\nWhen Brigadier Innes heard on the 12th of May of the mutiny at Meerut,\r\nhe ordered all the native troops on parade, that he and his officers\r\nmight, if possible, judge of their loyalty by their demeanour. The\r\nexamination was in great part, though not wholly, satisfactory. At noon\r\non the 13th the disastrous news from Delhi arrived. The intrenched\r\nmagazine within the fort was at that time guarded by a company of the\r\n57th; and the brigadier, rendered somewhat uneasy on this matter,\r\nplanned a new disposition of the troops. There had been many ‘cartridge’\r\nmeetings held among the men, and symptoms appeared that a revolt was\r\nintended. The relative positions of all the military were as follows: In\r\nthe middle of the fort was the intrenched magazine, guarded as just\r\nstated; outside the fort, on the west, were the officers’ bungalows and\r\nthe official buildings; still further to the west were the sepoy lines\r\nof the 45th and 57th; northward of these lines were the artillery\r\nbarracks; still further north were the lines of the cavalry; south of\r\nthe fort were the barracks of the European regiment; on the north of the\r\nfort was the Sudder Bazaar; while eastward of it was an open place or\r\n_maîdan_. The brigadier sought to avert danger by separating the two\r\nnative regiments; but the Queen’s 61st, by the general arrangements of\r\nthe cantonment, were too far distant to render the proper service at the\r\nproper moment. The 45th were to be removed to an open spot northeast of\r\nthe cantonment, and the 57th to another open space on the south, two\r\nmiles distant; the native cavalry were to take up a position near their\r\nown lines; the 61st were to encamp near the south wall of the fort;\r\nwhile one company, with artillery and guns, was to be placed within the\r\nfort. After a parade of the whole force, on the afternoon of the 13th,\r\neach corps was ordered to the camping-ground allotted for it. The 57th\r\nobeyed at once, but some companies of the 45th, while marching through\r\nthe bazaar, refused to go any further, stopped, loaded their muskets,\r\nand prepared for resistance; they ran towards the fort, clambered over a\r\ndilapidated part of the ramparts, and advanced towards the magazine,\r\nwhere scaling-ladders were thrown over to them by a company of the 57th\r\nwho had been on guard inside. This clearly shewed complicity to exist. A\r\nshort but severe conflict ensued. Captain Lewis and Major Redmond had\r\nonly a few Europeans with them, but they promptly attacked the\r\nmutineers, drove out the 45th, and made prisoners the treacherous guard\r\nof the 57th. All was now right in the fort and magazine, but not in the\r\ncantonment. About two hundred men of the 45th commenced a system of\r\nburning and looting; officers’ bungalows, mess-houses, hospitals, the\r\nchurch—all were fired. Many isolated acts of heroism were performed by\r\nindividual Europeans, but no corps was sent against the ruffians.\r\nFortunately, a powder-magazine beyond the cavalry lines, containing the\r\nenormous quantity of three hundred thousand pounds of gunpowder, did not\r\nfall into the hands of the rebels; it might have done so, for no\r\npreparations had been made to defend it. All this time the Queen’s\r\ntroops chafed at their enforced inaction; their camping-ground had been\r\nso badly chosen that they dared not in a body attack the 45th lest the\r\n57th should in the meantime surprise them in the rear; and there is no\r\nevidence that they were ordered to do what any English regiment would\r\ncheerfully have undertaken—divide into two wings, each to confront a\r\nwhole regiment of sepoys. During the night and the following morning\r\nnearly all the sepoys decamped, some with arms and some without.\r\nFerozpore was saved for the present; but mutinous proceedings were\r\nencouraged at Jullundur, Jelum, and Sealkote, by the escape of the 45th\r\nand 57th; and the brigadier fell into disgrace for his mismanagement of\r\nthis affair. He had only just arrived to take command of that station,\r\nand it may be that he was on this account less able to judge correctly\r\nthe merits or demerits of the forces placed at his disposal.\r\n\r\nJullundur, which gives name to the Jullundur Doab between the Sutlej and\r\nthe Beas, is another of this group of stations. It is situated on the\r\nhigh road from Umballa and Umritsir to Lahore; and was formerly the\r\ncapital of an Afghan dynasty in the Punjaub. Although shorn of much of\r\nits former greatness, it is still an important and flourishing town,\r\nwith forty thousand inhabitants. Jullundur received the news from Meerut\r\non the 11th of May, and immediately precautionary measures were taken.\r\nBrigadier-general Johnstone, the commandant, being absent at the time, a\r\nplan was at once formed by Colonel Hartley of H.M. 8th foot, and Captain\r\nFarrington, the deputy-commissioner, and agreed to by all the other\r\nofficers. The station at that time contained H.M. 8th foot, the 6th\r\nlight cavalry, the 36th and 61st native infantry, and one troop of\r\nhorse-artillery. The chief officers in command were Colonels Longfield\r\nand Hartley, Majors Barton, Innes, and Olpherts, and Captain Faddy. When\r\nthe telegraph of the 12th of May confirmed the Meerut news of the 11th,\r\nit was resolved at once to control the native troops at Jullundur, and\r\nto disarm them if mutinous symptoms should appear. Part of the Queen’s\r\ntroops were marched into the artillery lines; the guns were pointed at\r\nthe lines of the native regiments in such a way as to render the sepoys\r\nand sowars somewhat uneasy; two field-guns were kept with horses ready\r\nharnessed for movement; careful patrolling was maintained during the\r\nnight; and the ladies and children were safely if not comfortably placed\r\nin barracks and rooms guarded by their own countrymen. Captain\r\nFarrington was placed in charge of the civil lines, the public\r\nbuildings, and the town generally; and most fortunate was it for him,\r\nand the English generally, that the native Rajah of Jullundur, Rundheer\r\nSingh Alloowalla, remained friendly. This prince had been deprived of\r\npart of his territory at the period of the annexation of the Punjaub,\r\nbut the deprivation had not rendered him hostile to his powerful\r\nsuperiors; he promptly aided Farrington with guns and men, instead of\r\nthrowing in his lot with the mutineers. Jullundur, like Lahore,\r\nUmritsir, and Ferozpore, was saved for the present.\r\n\r\nPhillour, the fifth station in this remarkable group, was in one sense\r\nmore perilously placed than any of the others, owing to its nearer\r\nproximity to the mutineers of Meerut and Delhi. It stands on the right\r\nbank of the Sutlej, on the great high road from Umballa and Loodianah to\r\nUmritsir and Lahore. Phillour is of no account as a town, but of great\r\nimportance as a military station on the frontier of the Punjaub, and as\r\ncommanding the passage of the grand trunk-road across the Sutlej. At the\r\ntime of the mutiny it had a magazine containing a vast supply of warlike\r\nmaterial, without any European troops whatever. The adjoining cantonment\r\ncontained one native regiment, of which one company guarded the fort and\r\nmagazine. The military authorities all over the Punjaub and Sirhind well\r\nknew that Phillour contained munitions of war that would be most\r\nperilous in the hands of mutineers. Lieutenant Hildebrand, as was lately\r\nstated, was sent from Lahore with a company of artillery to Phillour;\r\nbut he stopped on the way to aid the operations at Umritsir. When the\r\nnews from Meerut arrived, Colonel Butler made such precautionary\r\narrangements as he could at the lines, while Lieutenant Griffith looked\r\nwatchfully after the fort and arsenal. Securing the telegraph, in order\r\nthat the sepoys of the 3d native infantry might not tamper with it, they\r\ncommunicated with Jullundur, and were rejoiced to find that a small\r\nforce was about to be despatched from that place for their relief. As\r\nsoon as the authorities at the last named station became aware of the\r\ninsurgent proceedings, they determined, besides attending to the safety\r\nof their own station, to aid Phillour; they sent a telegraphic officer\r\nto make such arrangements as would keep the wire in working order; they\r\nsent a message to Loodianah, to warn the deputy-commissioner to guard\r\nthe bridge of boats across the Sutlej; and they sent a small but compact\r\nforce to Phillour. This force consisted of a detachment of the Queen’s\r\n8th foot, two horse-artillery guns, spare men and horses for the\r\nartillery, and a small detachment of the 2d Punjaub cavalry. Knowing\r\nthat this welcome force was on the road, Colonel Butler and Lieutenant\r\nGriffith sought to maintain tranquillity in Phillour during the night;\r\nthey closed the fort-gate at sunset; they placed a loaded light\r\nfield-piece just within the gate, with port-fires kept burning; and the\r\nlittle band of Europeans remained on watch all night. At daybreak their\r\nsuccour arrived; the force from Jullundur, commanded by Major Baines and\r\nLieutenants Sankey, Dobbin, and Probyn, marched the twenty-four miles of\r\ndistance without a single halt. The guns and cavalry, being intended\r\nonly as an escort on the road, and to aid in recovering the fort in the\r\nevent of its having been captured by the sepoys during the night,\r\nreturned to Jullundur, together with fifty of the infantry. The actual\r\nreinforcement, therefore, was about a hundred of H.M. 8th foot, and a\r\nfew gunners to work the fort-guns if necessary. The little garrison\r\nopened the fort-gates to admit this reinforcement—much to the dismay of\r\nthe sepoys in the cantonment; for, as was afterwards ascertained, a plot\r\nhad been formed whereby the fort was to be quietly taken possession of\r\non the 15th of the month, and used as a rendezvous for the sepoy\r\nregiments in the Punjaub, when they had risen in mutiny, and formed a\r\nsystem of tactics in reference to the great focus of rebellion at Delhi.\r\n\r\nThus were the days from the 11th to the 14th of May days of critical\r\nimportance in the eastern part of the Punjaub. Evidence almost\r\nconclusive was obtained that the 15th was intended to have been a day of\r\ngrand mutiny among the Bengal sepoys stationed in that region: the\r\nregimental officers knew nothing of this; some of them would not believe\r\nit, even at the time of the disarming; but the current of belief tended\r\nin that direction afterwards. There is very little doubt, as already\r\nimplied, that the Meerut outbreak occurred before the plans were ready\r\nelsewhere; that event seemed to the British, and rightly so, a dreadful\r\none; but, if delayed five days, it would probably have been followed by\r\nthe shedding of an amount of European blood frightful to contemplate.\r\n\r\nHaving noticed the prompt measures taken at Lahore, Umritsir, Ferozpore,\r\nJullundur, and Phillour, shortly before the middle of May; it will be\r\nuseful, before tracing the course of subsequent revolt in some of the\r\neastern Punjaub stations, to attend to the state of affairs in the\r\nwestern division, of which Peshawur was the chief city.\r\n\r\nPeshawur was beyond the limits of British India until the annexation of\r\nthe Punjaub. Situated as it is on the main road from the Indus at Attock\r\nto the Indian Caucasus range at the Khyber Pass, it has for ages been\r\nregarded as an important military position, commanding one of the gates\r\nof India. The Afghans and other Mohammedan tribes generally made their\r\nirruptions into India by this route. During the complexities of Indian\r\npolitics and warfare, Peshawur passed from the hands of the Afghans to\r\nthose of the Sikhs, and then to the British, who proceeded to make it\r\nthe head-quarters of a military division. Peshawur had been so\r\nruthlessly treated by Runjeet Singh, after his capture of that place in\r\n1818, that its fine Moslem buildings were mostly destroyed, its commerce\r\ndamaged, and its population diminished. At present, its inhabitants are\r\nbelieved to be about sixty thousand in number. The fort is very strong;\r\nit consists of lofty walls, round towers at the angles, semicircular\r\nravelins in front, faussebraies of substantial towers and walls, a wet\r\nditch, and one only gateway guarded by towers; within the enclosure are\r\ncapacious magazines and storehouses.\r\n\r\nWhen the mutiny began, the Peshawur division contained about fourteen\r\nthousand troops of all arms. A peculiar military system was found\r\nnecessary in this division, owing to the large proportion of\r\nsemi-civilised marauders among the inhabitants. The western frontier is\r\nhilly throughout, being formed of the Indian Caucasus and the Suliman\r\nRange, and being pierced by only a few roads, of which the Khyber Pass\r\nand the Bolan Pass are the most famous. These passes and roads are for\r\nthe most part under the control of hardy mountaineers, who care very\r\nlittle for any regular governments, whether Afghan, Sikh, or British,\r\nand who require constant watching. Many of these men had been induced to\r\naccept British pay as irregular horsemen; and Colonel (formerly Major)\r\nEdwardes acquired great distinction for his admirable management of\r\nthese rough materials. The fourteen thousand troops in the Peshawur\r\ndivision of the Punjaub comprised about three thousand European infantry\r\nand artillery, eight thousand Bengal native infantry, three thousand\r\nBengal native cavalry and artillery, and a few Punjaubees and hill-men.\r\nThese were stationed at Peshawur, Nowsherah, Hoti Murdan, and the\r\nfrontier forts at the foot of the hills. Major-general Reid was chief\r\nmilitary authority at Peshawur. On the 13th of May he received\r\ntelegraphic news of the mutiny at Meerut and of the disarming at Lahore,\r\nand immediately held a council of war, attended by himself, Brigadiers\r\nCotton and Neville Chamberlain, Colonels Edwardes and Nicholson.\r\nEdwardes was chief-commissioner and superintendent of the Peshawur\r\ndivision, besides being a military officer. It was resolved that, as\r\nsenior military officer in the Punjaub, General Reid should assume chief\r\ncommand, and that his head-quarters should be with those of the Punjaub\r\ncivil government, at Lahore or elsewhere; while Cotton should command in\r\nthe Peshawur division. The council also agreed that, besides providing\r\nas far as was possible for the safety of each station individually, a\r\n‘movable column’ should be formed at Jelum, a station on the great road\r\nabout midway between Lahore and Peshawur—ready to move on any point in\r\nthe Punjaub where mutinous symptoms might appear. This force, it will be\r\nseen,[31] was made up of a singular variety of troops, comprising all\r\narms of the service, irregulars as well as regulars, Europeans as well\r\nas natives; but the Oudian or ‘Poorbeah’ element was almost wholly\r\nabsent, and by this absence was the efficiency of the column really\r\nestimated. Various arrangements were at the same time made for so\r\ndistributing the European troops as to afford them the best control over\r\nthe sepoy regiments. At Peshawur itself, the Company’s treasure was sent\r\ninto the fort for safety, and the Residency was made the head-quarters\r\nof the military authorities.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, news reached Peshawur that the 55th Bengal native\r\ninfantry—encouraged probably by the withdrawal of the 27th foot from\r\nNowsherah to aid in forming the movable column—had mutinied at Murdan on\r\nthe preceding day, keeping their officers under strict surveillance, but\r\nnot molesting them; and that Colonel Spottiswoode, their commander, had\r\nput an end to his existence through grief and mortification at this act.\r\nThe crisis being perilous, it was at once resolved to disarm the native\r\ntroops at Peshawur, or so much of them as excited most suspicion. This\r\nwas successfully accomplished on the morning of the 22d—much to the\r\nchagrin of the officers of the disbanded regiments, who, here as\r\nelsewhere, were among the last to admit the probability of\r\ninsubordination among their own troops. The 24th, 27th, and 51st\r\nregiments of Bengal native infantry, and the 5th of light cavalry, were\r\non this occasion deprived of their arms; and a subadar-major of the 51st\r\nwas hanged in presence of all his companions in arms. The disarming was\r\neffected by a clever distribution of the reliable forces; small parties\r\nof European artillery and cavalry being confronted with each regiment,\r\nin such way as to prevent aid being furnished by one to another. The men\r\nwere disarmed, but not allowed to desert, on pain of instant death if\r\ncaught making the attempt; and they were kept constantly watched by a\r\nsmall force of Europeans, and by a body of irregular troopers who had no\r\nsympathy whatever with Hindustanis. This done, a relieving force was at\r\nonce sent off to Murdan; a step which would have been dangerous while\r\nsepoy troops still remained so strong at Peshawur. The small force of\r\nEuropeans and irregulars was found to be sufficient for this duty; it\r\narrived at Murdan, attacked the mutinous 55th, killed or captured two\r\nhundred, and drove the rest away. These misguided insurgents ill\r\ncalculated the fate in store for them. Knowing that Mohammedan\r\nhill-tribes were near at hand, and that those tribes had often been\r\nhostile to the English, they counted on sympathy and support, but met\r\nwith defeat and death. The chivalrous Edwardes, who had so distinguished\r\nhimself in the Punjaub war, had gained a powerful influence among the\r\nhalf-trained mountaineers on the Afghan border. While the detachment\r\nfrom Peshawur was pursuing and cutting down many of the mutineers, the\r\nhill-men were at that very time coming to Edwardes to ask for military\r\nemployment. These hill-men hated the Brahmins, and had something like\r\ncontempt for traitors; when, therefore, Edwardes sent them against the\r\nmutineers, the latter soon found out their fatal error. ‘The petted\r\nsepoy,’ says one who was in the Punjaub at the time, ‘whose every whim\r\nhad been too much consulted for forty years—who had been ready to murder\r\nhis officer, to dishonour his officer’s wife, and rip in pieces his\r\nofficer’s child, sooner than bite the end of a cartridge which he well\r\nknew had _not_ been defiled—was now made to eat the bread and drink the\r\nwater of affliction: to submit at the hazard of his wretched life, which\r\nhe still tenaciously clung to, to ceremonies the least of which was more\r\ndamning to his caste than the mastication of a million of fat\r\ncartridges.’ Even this was not the end; for the sepoys were brought back\r\nto the British cantonment, in fives and tens, and there instantly put to\r\ndeath; no quarter was given to men who shewed neither justice nor mercy\r\nto others. There were other forts in the Peshawur Valley similar to that\r\nat Murdan, places held by native regiments, in which little or no\r\nreliance could be placed. There were four native regiments altogether in\r\nthese minor forts; and it became necessary to disarm these before the\r\nsafety of the British could be insured. Peshawur contained its full\r\nAsiatic proportion of desperate scoundrels, who would have begun to\r\n_loot_ at any symptom of discomfiture of the paramount power.\r\n\r\nWhen this disarming of the native troops at the surrounding forts had\r\nbeen effected, the authorities at Peshawur continued to look sharply\r\nafter the native troops at this important station. The disarmed 5th\r\nirregular cavalry, having refused to go against the 55th at Murdan, were\r\nat once and successfully disbanded. By a dexterous manœuvre, the\r\ntroopers were deprived of horses, weapons, coats, and boots, while the\r\nmouths of cannon were gaping at them; they were then sent off in boats\r\ndown the Indus, with a hint to depart as far as possible from any\r\nmilitary stations. The authorities in the Punjaub, like Neill at Benares\r\nand Allahabad, believed that mercy to the sepoys would be cruelty to all\r\nbesides at such a time; they shot, hanged, or blew away from guns with\r\nterrible promptness, all who were found to be concerned in mutinous\r\nproceedings. On one occasion a letter was intercepted, revealing the\r\nfact that three natives of high rank (giving names) were to sit in\r\ncouncil on the morrow to decide what to do against the British; a\r\ntelegraphic message was sent off to Sir John Lawrence, for advice how to\r\nact; a message was returned: ‘Let a spy attend and report;’ this was\r\ndone, and a plot discovered; another question brought back another\r\ntelegram: ‘Hang them all three;’ and in a quarter of an hour the hanging\r\nwas completed. The importance of retaining artillery in European hands\r\nwas strongly felt at Peshawur; to effect this, after many guns had been\r\nsent away to strengthen the moving column, a hundred and sixty European\r\nvolunteers from the infantry were quickly trained to the work, and\r\nplaced in charge of a horse-battery of six guns, half the number on\r\nhorseback, and the other half sitting on the guns and wagons—all\r\nactively put in training day after day to learn their new duties.\r\nFearful work the European gunners had sometimes to perform. Forty men of\r\nthe 55th regiment were ‘blown from guns’ in three days. An officer\r\npresent on the occasion says: ‘Three sides of a square were formed, ten\r\nguns pointed outwards, the sentence of the court read, a prisoner bound\r\nto each gun, the signal given, and the salvo fired. Such a scene I hope\r\nnever again to witness—human trunks, heads, arms, legs flying about in\r\nall directions. All met their fate with firmness but two; so to save\r\ntime they were dropped to the ground, and their brains blown out by\r\nmusketry.’ It sounds strangely to English ears that such a terrible\r\ndeath should occasionally be mentioned as a _concession_ or matter of\r\nfavour; yet such was the case. Mr Montgomery, judicial commissioner of\r\nthe Punjaub, issued an address to one of the native regiments, two\r\nsepoys of which had been blown away from guns for mutinous conduct. He\r\nexhorted them to fidelity, threatened them with the consequences of\r\ninsubordination, and added: ‘You have just seen two men of your regiment\r\nblown from guns. This is the punishment I will inflict on all traitors\r\nand mutineers; and your consciences will tell you what punishment they\r\nmay expect hereafter. These men have been blown from guns, and not\r\nhanged, because they were Brahmins, and _because I wished to save them\r\nfrom the pollution of the hangman’s touch_; and thus prove to you that\r\nthe British government does not wish to injure your caste and religion.’\r\nThe treachery and cruelty of the mutinous sepoys soon dried up all this\r\ntenderness as to the mode in which they would prefer to be put to death.\r\nWe have seen Neill at Cawnpore, after the revelation of the horrors in\r\nthe slaughter-room, compelling the Brahmin rebels to pollute themselves\r\nby wiping up the gore they had assisted to shed, as a means of striking\r\nhorror into the hearts of miscreant Brahmins elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the severe measures for preserving obedience, other\r\nprecautions were taken involving no shedding of blood. A new levy of\r\nPunjaubee troopers was obtained by Edwardes from the Moultan region; the\r\ndisarmed sepoys were removed from their lines, and made to encamp in a\r\nspot where they could be constantly watched; a land-transport train was\r\norganised, for the conveyance of European troops from place to place;\r\nthe fort was strengthened, provisioned, and guarded against all\r\nsurprises; the artillery park was defended by an earthwork; and trusty\r\nofficers were sent out in various directions to obtain recruits for\r\nlocal irregular corps—enlisting men rough in bearing and unscrupulous in\r\nmorals, but who knew when they were well commanded, and who had no kind\r\nof affection for Hindustanis. Thus did Cotton, Edwardes, Nicholson, and\r\nthe other officers, energetically carry out plans that kept Peshawur at\r\npeace, and enabled Sir John Lawrence to send off troops in aid of the\r\nforce besieging Delhi. Colonel Edwardes, it may here be stated, had been\r\nin Calcutta in the month of March; and had there heard that Sikhs in\r\nsome of the Bengal regiments were taking their discharge, as if\r\nforeseeing some plot then in preparation; this confirmed his\r\npredilection for Punjaub troops over ‘Poorbeahs.’ The activity in\r\nraising troops in the remotest northwest corner of India appears to have\r\nbeen a double benefit to the British; for it provided a serviceable body\r\nof hardy troops, and it gratified the natives of the Peshawur Valley.\r\nThis matter was adverted to in a letter written by Edwardes. ‘This post\r\n(Peshawur), so far from being more arduous in future, will be more\r\nsecure. Events here have taken a wonderful turn. During peace, Peshawur\r\nwas an incessant anxiety; now it is the strongest point in India. We\r\nhave struck two great blows—we have disarmed our own troops, and have\r\nraised levies of all the people of the country. The troops (sepoys) are\r\nconfounded; they calculated on being backed by the people. The people\r\nare delighted, and a better feeling has sprung up between them and us in\r\nthis enlistment than has ever been obtained before. I have also called\r\non my old country, the Derajat, and it is quite delightful to see how\r\nthe call is answered. Two thousand horsemen, formerly in my army at\r\nMoultan, are now moving on different points, according to order, to help\r\nus in this difficulty; and every post brings me remonstrances from\r\nchiefs as to why they have been forgotten. This is really gratifying.’\r\nIt may be here stated that Sir John Lawrence, about the end of May,\r\nsuggested to Viscount Canning by telegraph the expediency of allowing\r\nBengal sepoys to retire from the army and receive their pay, if they\r\npreferred so doing, and if they had not been engaged in mutinous\r\nproceedings—as a means of sifting the good from the bad; but Canning\r\nthought this would be dangerous east of the Sutlej; and it does not\r\nappear to have been acted on anywhere.\r\n\r\nThese exertions were materially aided by the existence of a remarkable\r\npolice system in the Punjaub—one of the benefits which the Lawrences and\r\ntheir associates introduced. The Punjaub police was of three kinds.\r\nFirst was the _military_ police, consisting of two corps of irregular\r\ninfantry, seven battalions of foot, one regiment cavalry, and\r\ntwenty-seven troops of horse—amounting altogether to about thirteen\r\nthousand men. These men were thoroughly disciplined, and were ready at\r\nall times to encounter the marauding tribes from the mountains. Then\r\ncame the _civil_ police, comprising about nine thousand men, and\r\ndistributed over nearly three hundred thannahs or subordinate\r\njurisdictions, to protect thirty thousand villages and small places: the\r\nmen were armed with swords and carbines. Lastly were the _constabulary_,\r\nthirteen hundred men in the cities, and thirty thousand in the rural\r\ndistricts; these were a sort of watchmen, dressed in a plain drab\r\nuniform, and carrying only a staff and a spear. This large police army\r\nof more than fifty thousand men was not only efficient, when well\r\nofficered, in maintaining tranquillity, but furnished excellent recruits\r\nfor regiments of Sikh and Punjaubee soldiers.\r\n\r\nSir John Lawrence issued a vigorous proclamation, encouraging the native\r\ntroops to remain faithful, and threatening them with dire consequences\r\nif they revolted; but from the first he relied very little on such\r\nappeals to the Bengal troops. Leaving this subject, however, and\r\ndirecting attention to those events only which bore with any weight on\r\nthe progress of the mutiny, we shall now rapidly glance at Punjaub\r\naffairs in the summer months. Many struggles took place, too slight to\r\nrequire much notice. One was the disarming of a native regiment at\r\nNoorpore. Another, on June 13th, was the execution of twelve men at\r\nFerozpore, belonging to the 45th N. I., for mutiny after being disarmed.\r\n\r\nIt was early in June that the station at Jullundur became a prey to\r\ninsurgent violence. On the 3d of the month, a fire broke out in the\r\nlines of the 61st native infantry—a bad symptom wherever it occurred in\r\nthose days. On the following night a hospital was burned. On the 6th,\r\nthe 4th regiment Sikh infantry marched into the station, as well as a\r\nnative troop of horse-artillery; but, owing to some uneasiness displayed\r\nby the Bengal troops, the Sikh regiment was removed to another\r\nstation—as if the brigadier in command were desirous not to offend or\r\nirritate the petted regiments from the east. At eleven o’clock at night\r\non the 7th, the close of a quiet Sunday—again Sunday!—a sudden alarm of\r\nfire was given, and a lurid glare was seen over the lines of the 36th\r\nnative infantry. The officers rushed to their respective places; and\r\nthen it was found that the 6th native cavalry, wavering for a time, had\r\nat last given way to the mutinous impulse that guided the 36th and 61st\r\ninfantry, and that all three regiments were threatening the officers.\r\nThe old sad story might again be told; the story of some of the officers\r\nbeing shot as they spoke and appealed to the fidelity of their men; of\r\nothers being shot at or sabred as they ran or rode across the\r\nparade-ground; of ladies and children being affrighted at the artillery\r\nbarracks, where they had been wont to sleep for greater security. The\r\nmutineers had evidently expected the native artillery to join them; but\r\nfortunately these latter were so dove-tailed with the European\r\nartillery, and were so well looked after by a company of the 8th foot,\r\nthat they could not mutiny if they would. All the Europeans who fled to\r\nthe artillery barracks and lines were safe; the guns protected them. The\r\nmutineers, after an hour or two of the usual mischief, made off. About\r\none half the cavalry regiment mutinied, but as all confidence was lost\r\nin them, the rest were deprived of horses and arms, and the regiment\r\nvirtually ceased to exist. The officers were overwhelmed with\r\nastonishment and mortification; some of them had gone to rest on that\r\nevening in perfect reliance on their men. One of the cavalry officers\r\nafterwards said: ‘Some of our best men have proved the most active in\r\nthis miserable business. A rough rider in my troop, who had been riding\r\nmy charger in the morning, and had played with my little child, was one\r\nof the men who charged the guns.’ This officer, like many others, had no\r\nother theory to offer than that his troopers mutinied in a ‘panic,’\r\narising from the sinister rumours that ran like wildfire through the\r\nlines and bazaars of the native troops, shaking the fidelity of those\r\nwho had not previously taken part in any conspiracy. It was the only\r\ntheory which their bitterness of heart allowed them to contemplate with\r\nany calmness; for few military men could admit without deep\r\nmortification that they had been ignorant of, and deceived by, their own\r\nsoldiers down to the very last moment.\r\n\r\nWhile a portion of the 6th cavalry remained, disarmed and unhorsed but\r\nnot actually disbanded, at Jullundur, the two regiments and a half of\r\nmutineers marched off towards Phillour, as if bound for Delhi. At the\r\ninstant the mutiny began, a telegraphic message had been sent from\r\nJullundur to Phillour, to break the bridge of boats over the Sutlej, and\r\nthereby prevent the rebels from crossing from the Punjaub into Sirhind.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the telegraphic message failed to reach the officer to\r\nwhom it was sent. The 3d regiment Bengal native cavalry, at Phillour,\r\nmight, as the commanding officer at that time thought, have been\r\nmaintained in discipline if the Jullundur mutineers had not disturbed\r\nthem; but when the 36th and 61st native infantry, and the 6th cavalry\r\nwere approaching, all control was found to be lost. The telegraphic\r\nwires being cut, no news could reach Phillour, and thus the insurgents\r\nfrom Jullundur made their appearance wholly unexpected—by the Europeans,\r\nif not by the troopers. The ladies and families were at once hastened\r\noff from the cantonment to the fort, which had just before been\r\ngarrisoned by a hundred men of H.M. 8th foot. The officers then went on\r\nparade, where they found themselves unable to bring the 3d regiment to a\r\nsense of their duty; the men promised to keep their hands clear of\r\nmurder, but they would not fight against the approaching rebels from\r\nJullundur. The officers then returned to the fort powerless; for the\r\nhandful of Europeans there, though sufficient to defend the fort, were\r\nunable to encounter four mutinous regiments in the cantonment. In a day\r\nor two, all the ladies and children were sent off safely to the hills;\r\nand the cavalry officers were left without immediate duties. The tactics\r\nof the brigadier at Jullundur were at that crisis somewhat severely\r\ncriticised. It was considered that he ought to have made such\r\narrangements as would have prevented the mutineers from crossing the\r\nSutlej. He followed them, with such a force as he could spare or\r\ncollect; but while he was planning to cut off the bridge of boats that\r\nspanned the Sutlej between Phillour and Loodianah, they avoided that\r\nspot altogether; they crossed the river six miles further up, and\r\nproceeded on their march towards Delhi—attacked at certain places by\r\nEuropeans and by Sikhs, but not in sufficient force to frustrate their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAlthough belonging to a region east of the Punjaub, it may be well\r\nhere to notice another of the June mutinies nearer the focus of\r\ndisaffection. One of the regiments that took its officers by surprise\r\nin mutinying was the 60th B. N. I.; of which the head-quarters had\r\nbeen at Umballa, but which was at Bhotuck, only three marches from\r\nDelhi, when the fidelity of the men gave way. One of the English\r\nofficers, expressing his utter astonishment at this result, said: ‘All\r\ngone! The men that we so trusted; my own men, with whom I have shot,\r\nplayed cricket, jumped, entered into all their sports, and treated so\r\nkindly!’ He thought it almost cruel to subject that regiment to such\r\ntemptation as would be afforded by close neighbourhood with the\r\nmutineers at Delhi. But, right or wrong, the temptation was afforded,\r\nand proved too strong to be resisted. It afterwards became known that\r\nthe 60th received numerous letters and messages from within Delhi,\r\nentreating them to join the national cause against the Kaffir\r\nFeringhees. On the 11th of June, the sepoys suddenly rose, and fired a\r\nvolley at a tent within which many of the officers were at mess, but\r\nfortunately without fatal results. Many of the officers at once\r\ngalloped off to the camp outside Delhi, feeling they might be more\r\nuseful there than with a mutinous regiment; while others stayed a\r\nwhile, in the vain hope of bringing the men back to a sense of their\r\nduty. After plundering the mess of the silver-plate and the wine, and\r\nsecuring the treasure-chest, the mutineers made off for Delhi. Here,\r\nhowever, a warm reception was in store for them; their officers had\r\ngiven the alarm; and H.M. 9th Lancers cut the mutineers up terribly on\r\nthe road leading to the Lahore Gate. Of those who entered the city,\r\nmost fell in a sortie shortly afterwards. At the place where this\r\nregiment had been stationed, Umballa, another death-fiend—cholera—was\r\nat work. ‘We have had that terrible scourge the cholera. It has been\r\nraging here with frightful violence for two months (May to July); but,\r\nthank God, has now left us without harming the Sahibs. It seemed a\r\njudgment on the natives. They were reeling about and falling dead in\r\nthe streets, and no one to remove them. It is the only time we have\r\nlooked on it as an ally; though it has carried off many soldiers, two\r\nnative officers, and six policemen, who were guarding prisoners; all\r\nfell dead at the same place; as one dropped, another stepped forward\r\nand took his place; and so on the whole lot.’ It was one of the\r\ngrievous results of the Indian mutiny that English officers, in very\r\nbitterness of heart, often expressed satisfaction at the calamities\r\nwhich fell on the natives, even townsmen unconnected with the\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\nJelum, which was the scene of a brief but very fierce contest in July,\r\nis a considerable town on the right bank of the river of the same name;\r\nit is situated on the great line of road from Lahore to Peshawur; and\r\nplans have for some time been under consideration for the establishment\r\nof river-steamers thence down through Moultan to Kurachee. Like many\r\nother places on the great high road, it was a station for troops; and\r\nlike many other stations, it was thrown into uneasiness by doubts of the\r\nfidelity of the sepoys. The 14th regiment Bengal native infantry, about\r\nthree-fourths of which were stationed at Jelum, having excited\r\nsuspicions towards the end of June, it was resolved to disarm them; but\r\nas no force was at hand to effect this, three companies of H.M. 24th\r\nfoot, under Colonel Ellice, with a few horse-artillery, were ordered\r\ndown from Rawul Pindee. On the 7th of July the English troops arrived,\r\nand found the native regiment drawn up on parade. Whether exasperated at\r\nthe frustration of a proposed plan of mutiny, or encouraged by their\r\nstrength being thrice that of the English, is not well known; but the\r\n14th attacked the English with musketry directly they approached. This\r\nof course brought on an immediate battle. The sepoys had fortified their\r\nhuts, loopholed their walls, and secured a defensive position in a\r\nneighbouring village. The English officers of the native regiment,\r\ndeserted and fired at by their men, hastened to join the 24th; and a\r\nvery severe exchange of musketry soon took place. The sepoys fought so\r\nboldly, and disputed every inch so resolutely, that it was found\r\nnecessary to bring the three guns into requisition to drive them out of\r\ntheir covered positions. At last they were expelled, and escaped into\r\nthe country; where the British, having no cavalry, were unable to follow\r\nthem. It was an affair altogether out of the usual order in India at\r\nthat time: instead of being a massacre or a chasing of treacherously\r\nbetrayed individuals, it was a fight in which the native troops met the\r\nBritish with more than their usual resolution. The loss in this brief\r\nconflict was severe. Colonel Ellice was terribly wounded in the chest\r\nand the thigh; Captain Spring was killed; Lieutenants Streathfield and\r\nChichester were wounded, one in both legs, and the other in the arm; two\r\nsergeants and twenty-three men were killed; four corporals and\r\nforty-three men wounded. Thus, out of this small force, seventy-six were\r\neither killed or wounded. The government authorities at Jelum\r\nimmediately offered a reward of thirty rupees a head for every fugitive\r\nsepoy captured. This led to the capture of about seventy in the next two\r\ndays, and to a fearful scene of shooting and blowing away from guns.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, July 7th, when three companies of H.M. 24th were thus\r\nengaged at Jelum, the other companies of the same regiment were engaged\r\nat Rawul Pindee in disarming the 58th native infantry and two companies\r\nof the 14th. The sepoys hesitated for a time, but seeing a small force\r\nof horse-artillery confronted to them, yielded; some fled, but the rest\r\ngave up their arms. Two hundred of their muskets were found to be\r\nloaded, a significant indication of some murderous intent.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny at Sealkote, less fatal than that at Jelum in reference to\r\nthe conflict of troops in fair fight, was more adventurous, more marked\r\nby ‘hair-breadth ‘scapes’ among the officers and their families.\r\nSealkote is a town of about twenty thousand inhabitants, in the Doab\r\nbetween the Chenab and the Ravee, on the left bank of the first-named\r\nriver, and about sixty miles distant from Lahore. At the time of the\r\nmutiny there was a rifle-practice depôt at this place. The sepoys\r\nstationed at Sealkote had often been in conversation with their European\r\nofficers concerning the cartridge-question, and had expressed themselves\r\nsatisfied with the explanations offered. During the active operations\r\nfor forming movable columns in the Punjaub, either to protect the\r\nvarious stations or to form a Delhi siege-army, all the European troops\r\nat Sealkote were taken away, as well as some of the native regiments;\r\nleaving at that place only the 46th Bengal native infantry, and a wing\r\nof the 9th native cavalry, in cantonment, while within the fort were\r\nabout a hundred and fifty men of the new Sikh levies. The brigadier\r\ncommandant was rendered very uneasy by this removal of his best troops;\r\nsome of his officers had already recommended the disarming of the sepoys\r\nbefore the last of the Queen’s troops were gone; but he was scrupulous\r\nof shewing any distrust of the native army; he felt and acted in this\r\nmatter more like a Bengal officer than a Punjaub officer—relying on the\r\nhonour and fidelity of the ‘Poorbeah’ troops. His anxieties greatly\r\nincreased when he heard that the 14th native infantry, after revolting\r\nat Jelum, were approaching Sealkote. Many of them, it is true, had been\r\ncut up by a few companies of the Queen’s 24th; but still the remainder\r\nmight very easily tempt his own sepoys and troopers. Nevertheless, to\r\nthe last day, almost to the last hour, many of the regimental officers\r\nfully trusted the men; and even their ladies slept near the lines, for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe troops appear to have laid a plan on the evening of the 8th of July,\r\nfor a mutiny on the following morning. At four o’clock on the 9th,\r\nsounds of musketry and cries of distress were heard, rousing all the\r\nEuropeans from their slumbers. An officer on night-picket duty near the\r\ncavalry lines observed a few troopers going towards the infantry lines.\r\nIt was afterwards discovered that these troopers went to the sepoys,\r\ntold them ‘the letters’ had come, and urged them to revolt at\r\nonce—implying complicity with mutineers elsewhere; but the officer could\r\nnot know this at the time: he simply thought the movement suspicious,\r\nand endeavoured to keep his own sepoy guards from contact with the\r\ntroopers. In this, however, he failed; the sepoys soon left him, and\r\nwent over to the troopers. He hurried to his bungalow, told his wife to\r\nhasten in a buggy to the fort, and then went himself towards the lines\r\nof his regiment. This was a type of what occurred generally. The\r\nofficers sought to send their wives and families from their various\r\nbungalows into the fort, and then hastened to their duties. These duties\r\nbrought them into the presence of murderous troops at the regimental\r\nlines; troops who fired on the very officers that to the last had\r\ntrusted them. Especially was the mortification great among the Europeans\r\nconnected with the 46th; for when they begged their sepoys to fire upon\r\nthe mutinous troopers, the sepoys fired at them instead. A captain, two\r\nsurgeons, a clergyman, and his wife and child, were killed almost at the\r\nvery beginning of the outbreak; while Brigadier Brind and other officers\r\nwere wounded.\r\n\r\nThere were no wanderings over burning roads and through thick jungles to\r\nrecord in this case; but a few isolated adventures may be briefly\r\nnoticed. Two or three roads from the lines and bungalows to the fort\r\nbecame speedily marked by fleeing Europeans—officers, ladies, and\r\nchildren—in vehicles, on horseback, and on foot—all trying to reach the\r\nfort, and all attacked or pursued by the treacherous villains. Dr\r\nGraham, the superintending surgeon, on the alarm being raised, drove\r\nquickly with his daughter towards the fort; a trooper rode up and shot\r\nhim dead; his bereaved daughter seized the reins, and, with the corpse\r\nof her parent on her lap, drove into the nearest compound, screaming for\r\nhelp. A young lieutenant of the 9th cavalry, when it came to his turn to\r\nflee, had to dash past several troopers, who fired many shots, one only\r\nof which hit him. He galloped thirty miles to Wuzeerabad, wounded as he\r\nwas; and, all his property being left behind him only to be ruthlessly\r\ndestroyed, he had, to use his own words, to look forward to begin the\r\nworld again, ‘with a sword, and a jacket cut up the back.’ Three\r\nofficers galloped forty miles to Gujeranwalla, swimming or wading the\r\nrivers that crossed their path. One of the captains of the 46th, who was\r\npersonally much liked by the sepoys of his own company, was startled by\r\nreceiving from them an offer of a thousand rupees per month if he would\r\nbecome a rebel like them, and still remain their captain! What answer he\r\ngave to this strange offer may easily be conceived; but his company\r\nremained kind to him, for they saw him safely escorted to the fort. In\r\none of the bungalows fourteen persons, of whom only three were men,\r\nsought refuge from the murderous sepoys and troopers. The women and\r\nchildren all congregated in a small lumber-room; the three gentlemen\r\nremained in the drawing-room, pistols in hand. Then ensued a brisk scene\r\nof firing and counter-firing; during which, however, only one life\r\nappears to have been lost: the love of plunder in this case overpowered\r\nthe love of murder; for the insurgents, compelling the gentlemen to\r\nretreat to their poor companions in the lumber-room, and there besieging\r\nthem for a time, turned their attention to loot or plunder. After ten\r\nhours sojourn of fourteen persons in a small room in a sultry July day,\r\nthe Europeans, finding that the mutineers were wandering in other\r\ndirections, contrived to make a safe and hasty run to the fort, a\r\ndistance of upwards of a mile. Some of the Europeans at the station, as\r\nwe have said, were killed; some escaped by a brisk gallop; while the\r\nrest were shut up for a fortnight in the fort, in great discomfort,\r\nuntil the mutineers went away. There being no European soldiers at\r\nSealkote, the sepoys and sowars acted as they pleased; they pillaged the\r\nbungalows, exploded the magazine, let loose the prisoners in the jail,\r\nand then started off, like other mutineers, in the direction of Delhi.\r\n\r\nOne of the most touching incidents at Sealkote bore relation to a\r\nnunnery, a convent of nuns belonging to the order of Jesus Marie of\r\nLyon, a Roman Catholic establishment analogous to that at Sirdhana near\r\nMeerut, already brought under notice (p. 57). The superior at Lyon, many\r\nweeks afterwards, received a letter from one of the sisters,[32] giving\r\nan affecting account of the way in which the quiet religieuses were\r\nhunted about by the mutineers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sealkote mutineers had taken their departure towards Delhi, a\r\nforce was organised at Jelum as quickly as possible to pursue them. This\r\nforce, under Colonel Brown, comprised three companies of H.M. 24th foot,\r\ntwo hundred Sikhs, a hundred irregular horse, and three horse-artillery\r\nguns. The energetic Brigadier Nicholson, in command of a flying column\r\ndestined for Delhi, comprising the 52d light infantry, the 6th Punjaub\r\ncavalry, and other troops, made arrangements at the same time for\r\nintercepting the mutineers. It thus happened that on the 12th of July,\r\nthe insurgent 46th and 9th regiments when they reached the Ravee from\r\nSealkote, found themselves hemmed in; and after an exciting contest on\r\nan island in the river, they were almost entirely cut up.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of July, the disarmed 26th native infantry mutinied at\r\nLahore, killed Major Spencer and two native officers, and fled up the\r\nleft bank of the Ravee; but the police, the new levies, and the\r\nvillagers pursued them so closely and harassed them so continuously,\r\nthat hardly a man remained alive. In August, something of the same kind\r\noccurred at other places in the Punjaub; native Bengal regiments still\r\nwere there, disarmed but not disbanded; and it could not be otherwise\r\nthan that the men felt chafed and discontented with such a state of\r\nthings. If faithful, they felt the degradation of being disarmed; if\r\nhollow in their professed fidelity, they felt the irksomeness of being\r\nclosely watched in cantonment. At Ferozpore, on the 19th of August, a\r\nportion of the 10th native cavalry, that had before been disarmed,\r\nmutinied, and endeavoured to capture the guns of Captain Woodcock’s\r\nbattery; they rushed at the guns while the artillerymen were at dinner,\r\nand killed the veterinary surgeon and one or two other persons; but a\r\ncorps of Bombay Fusiliers, in the station at that time, repulsed and\r\ndispersed them. At Peshawur, where it was found frequently necessary to\r\nsearch the huts and tents of the disarmed sepoys, for concealed weapons,\r\nthe 51st native infantry resisted this search on the 28th of the month;\r\nthey beat their officers with cudgels, and endeavoured to seize the arms\r\nof a Sikh corps while those men were at dinner. They were foiled, and\r\nfled towards the hills; but a disastrous flight was it for them; more\r\nthan a hundred were shot before they could get out of the lines, a\r\nhundred and fifty more were cut down during an immediate pursuit, nearly\r\nfour hundred were brought in prisoners, to be quickly tried and shot,\r\nand some of the rest were made slaves by the mountaineers of the Khyber\r\nPass, who would by no means ‘fraternise’ with them. Thus the regiment\r\nwas in effect annihilated. There were then three disarmed native\r\nregiments left in Peshawur, which were kept so encamped that loaded guns\r\nin trusty hands might always point towards them.\r\n\r\nThe course of events in the Punjaub need not be traced further in any\r\nconnected form. From first to last the plan adopted was pretty uniform\r\nin character. When the troubles began, there were about twenty regiments\r\nof the Bengal native army in the Punjaub; and these regiments were at\r\nonce and everywhere distrusted by Sir John Lawrence and his chief\r\nofficers. If hope and confidence were felt, it was rather by the\r\nregimental officers, to whom disloyalty in their respective corps was\r\nnaturally mortifying and humiliating. All the sepoys were disarmed and\r\nthe sowars dismounted, as soon as suspicious symptoms appeared; some\r\nregiments remained at the stations, disarmed, throughout the whole of\r\nthe summer and autumn; some mutinied, before or after disarming; but\r\nvery few indeed lived to reach the scene of rebel supremacy at Delhi;\r\nfor they were cut up by the Europeans, Sikhs, Punjaubees, or hill-men\r\nwhich the Punjaub afforded. Gladly as every one, whether civilian or\r\nmilitary, acknowledged the eminent services of Sir John Lawrence; there\r\nwere, it must be admitted, certain advantages available to him which\r\nwere utterly denied to Mr Colvin, the responsible chief of the Northwest\r\nProvinces, in which the mutiny raged more fiercely than anywhere else.\r\nWhen the troubles began, the Punjaub was better furnished with regiments\r\nof the Queen’s army than any other part of India; while the native\r\nSikhs, Punjaubee Mohammedans, and hill-men, were either indifferent or\r\nhostile to the sepoys of Hindostan proper. The consequences of this\r\nstate of things were two: the native troops were more easily disarmed;\r\nand those who mutinied were more in danger of annihilation before they\r\ncould get east of the Sutlej. In the Northwest Provinces the\r\ncircumstances were far more disastrous; the British troops were\r\nrelatively fewer; and the people were more nearly in accord with the\r\nsepoys, in so far as concerned national and religious sympathies. In the\r\nMeerut military division, when the mutiny had fairly commenced, besides\r\nthose at Meerut station, there was only one European regiment (at Agra),\r\nagainst ten native regiments, irrespective of those which mutinied at\r\nMeerut and Delhi. In the Cawnpore military division, comprising the\r\ngreat stations of Lucknow, Allahabad, Cawnpore, and the whole of Oude,\r\nthere was scarcely more than one complete European regiment, against\r\nthirty native Bengal and Oude regiments, regular and irregular. In the\r\nDinapoor military division, comprising Benares, Patna, Ghazeepore, and\r\nother large cities, together with much government wealth in the form of\r\ntreasure and opium, there was in like manner only one British regiment,\r\nagainst sixteen native corps. There was at the same time this additional\r\ndifficulty; that no such materials were at hand as in the Punjaub, for\r\nraising regiments of horse and foot among tribes who would sympathise\r\nbut little with the mutineers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Camel and Rider.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSir John Lawrence was at first in some doubt what course to follow in\r\nrelation to the liberty of the press. The Calcutta authorities, as we\r\nshall see in the next chapter, thought it proper to curtail that liberty\r\nin Bengal and the Northwest Provinces. Sir John, unwilling on the one\r\nhand to place the Europeans in the Punjaub in the tormenting condition\r\nof seclusion from all sources of news, and unwilling on the other to\r\nleave the news-readers at the mercy of inaccurate or unscrupulous\r\nnews-writers at such a critical time, adopted a medium course. He caused\r\nthe _Lahore Chronicle_ to be made the medium of conveying official news\r\nof all that was occurring in India, so far as rapid outlines were\r\nconcerned. The government secretary at that place sent every day to the\r\neditor of the newspaper an epitome of the most important public news.\r\nThis epitome was printed on small quarter-sheets of paper, and\r\ndespatched by each day’s post to all the stations in the Punjaub. The\r\neffect was—that false rumours and sinister reports were much less\r\nprevalent in the Punjaub than in Bengal; men were not thrown into\r\nmystery by a suppression of journalism; but were candidly told how\r\nevents proceeded, so far as information had reached that remote part of\r\nIndia. The high character of the chief-commissioner was universally held\r\nas a guarantee that the news given in the epitome, whether little or\r\nmuch in quantity, would be honestly rendered; the scheme would have been\r\na failure under a chief who did not command respect and win confidence.\r\nAs the summer advanced, and dâks and wires were interrupted, the news\r\nobtainable became very scanty. The English in the Punjaub were placed in\r\na most tantalising position. Aware that matters were going wrong at\r\nDelhi and Agra, at Lucknow and Cawnpore, they did not know _how_ wrong;\r\nfor communication was well-nigh cut off. As the cities just named lie\r\nbetween the Punjaub and Calcutta, all direct communication with the seat\r\nof government was still more completely cut off. The results of this\r\nwere singularly trying. ‘Gradually,’ says an officer writing from the\r\nPunjaub, ‘papers and letters reached us from Calcutta _viâ_ Bombay. It\r\nis not the least striking illustration of the complete revolution that\r\nhas occurred in India, that the news from the Gangetic valley—say from\r\nAllahabad and Cawnpore—was known in London sooner than at Lahore. We had\r\nbeen accustomed to receive our daily letters and newspapers from every\r\npart of the empire with the same unfailing regularity as in England.\r\nSuddenly we found ourselves separated from Calcutta for two months of\r\ntime. Painfully must a letter travel from the eastern capital to the\r\nwestern port—from Calcutta to Bombay; painfully must it toil up the\r\nunsettled provinces of the western coast; slowly must it jog along on\r\nmule-back across the sands of Sinde; many queer twists and unwonted\r\nturns must that letter take, many enemies must it baffle and elude,\r\nbefore, much bestamped, much stained with travel—for Indian letter-bags\r\nare not water-proof—it is delivered to its owner at Lahore.... Slowly,\r\nvery slowly, the real truth dragged its way up the country. It is only\r\nthis very 29th of September that this writer in the Punjaub has read\r\nanything like a connected account of the fearful tragedy at Cawnpore,\r\nwhich, once read or heard, no Englishman can ever forget.’\r\n\r\nAttention must now for a brief space be directed to the country of Sinde\r\nor Scinde; not so much for the purpose of narrating the progress of\r\nmutiny there, as to shew how it happened that there were few materials\r\nout of which mutiny could arise.\r\n\r\nSinde is the region which bounds the lower course of the river Indus,\r\nalso called Sinde. The name is supposed to have had the same origin as\r\nSindhi or Hindi, connected with the great Hindoo race. When the Indus\r\nhas passed out of the Punjaub at its lower apex, it enters Sinde,\r\nthrough which it flows to the ocean, which bounds Sinde on the south;\r\neast is Rajpootana, and west Beloochistan. The area of Sinde is about\r\nequal to that of England without Wales. The coast is washed by the\r\nIndian Ocean for a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles; being,\r\nwith very few exceptions, little other than a series of mud-banks\r\ndeposited by the Indus, or low sand-hills blown in from the sea-beach.\r\nSo low is most of the shore, that a wide expanse of country is\r\noverflowed at each high tide; it is a dreary swamp, scarcely observable\r\nfrom shipboard three or four miles out at sea. The mouths of the Indus\r\nare numerous, but so shallow that only one of them admits ships of any\r\nconsiderable burden; and even that one is subject to so many\r\nfluctuations in depth and in weather, that sea-going vessels scarcely\r\nenter it at all. Kurachee, the only port in Sinde, is a considerable\r\ndistance west of all these mouths; and the mercantile world looks\r\nforward with much solicitude to the time when a railway will be formed\r\nfrom this port to Hydrabad, a city placed at the head of the delta of\r\nthe Indus. This delta, in natural features, resembles that of the Nile\r\nrather than that of the Ganges, being nearly destitute of timber. On\r\neach side of the Indus, for a breadth varying from two to twelve miles,\r\nis a flat alluvial tract, in most places extremely fertile. Many parts\r\nof Sinde are little better than desert; such as the _Pât_, between\r\nShikarpore and the Bolan Pass, and the _Thur_, nearer to the river. In\r\ngeneral, it may be said that no part of Sinde is fertile except where\r\nthe Indus irrigates it; for there is little either of rain or dew, and\r\nthe climate is intensely hot. Camels are largely reared in Sinde; and\r\nthe Sindians have abundant reason to value this animal. It is to him a\r\nbeast of burden; its milk is a favourite article of diet; its hair is\r\nwoven into coarse cloth; and it renders him service in many other ways.\r\n\r\nThe Sindians are an interesting race, both in themselves and in their\r\npolitical relations. They are a mixture of Jâts and Beloochees, among\r\nwhom the distinction between Hindoo and Mussulman has a good deal broken\r\ndown. The Beloochees are daring, warlike Mohammedans; the Jâts are\r\nHindoos less rigorous in matters of faith and caste than those of\r\nHindostan; while the Jâts who have become Mohammedans are a peaceful\r\nagricultural race, somewhat despised by both the others. The Sindians\r\ncollectively are a dark, handsome, well-limbed race; and it was a\r\nfavourite opinion of Sir William Jones, that they were the original of\r\nthe gipsies. The languages spoken are a mixture of Hindi, Beloochee, and\r\nPersian.\r\n\r\nThe chain of events which brought Sinde under British rule may be traced\r\nin a few sentences. About thirteen centuries ago the country was invaded\r\nby the Persians, who ravaged it without making a permanent settlement.\r\nThe califs at a later date conquered Sinde; from them it was taken by\r\nthe Afghans of Ghiznee; and in the time of Baber it fell into the hands\r\nof the chief of Candahar. It was then, for a century and a half, a\r\ndependency of the Mogul Empire. For a few years Nadir Shah held it; next\r\nthe Moguls retook it; and in 1756 Sinde fell under the rule of the\r\nCabool khans, which was maintained nearly to the time when the British\r\nseized the sovereign power. Although subject to Cabool, Sinde was really\r\ngoverned by eight or ten native princes, called Ameers, who had among\r\nthem three distinct territories marked by the cities of Hydrabad,\r\nKhyrpore, and Meerpoor. Under these ameers the government was a sort of\r\nmilitary despotism, each ameer having a power of life and death; but in\r\nwarlike affairs they were dependent on feudal chieftains, each of whom\r\nheld an estate on condition of supplying a certain number of soldiers.\r\nThe British had various trading treaties with the ameers; one of which,\r\nin 1832, opened the roads and rivers of Sinde to the commerce of the\r\nCompany. When, in 1838, the eyes of the governor-general were directed\r\nanxiously towards Afghanistan, Sinde became involved in diplomatic\r\nconferences, in which the British, the Afghans, the Sindians, and\r\nRunjeet Singh were all concerned. These conferences led to quarrels, to\r\ntreaties, to accusations of breach of faith, which we need not trace:\r\nsuffice it to say that Sir Charles James Napier, with powers of the pen\r\nand of the sword intrusted to him, settled the Sinde difficulty once for\r\nall, in 1848, by fighting battles which led to the annexation of that\r\ncountry to the Company’s dominions. The former government was entirely\r\nput an end to; and the ameers were pensioned off with sums amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to about fifty thousand pounds per annum. Some of these\r\nAmeers, like other princes of India, afterwards came to England in the\r\nhope of obtaining better terms from Queen Victoria than had been\r\nobtainable from the Company Bahadoor.\r\n\r\nWhen Sinde became a British province, it was separated into three\r\ncollectorates or districts—Shikarpore, Hydrabad, and Kurachee; a new\r\nsystem of revenue administration was introduced; annual fairs were\r\nestablished at Kurachee and Sukur; and peaceful commerce was everywhere\r\nso successfully established, that the country improved rapidly, greatly\r\nto the content of the mass of the people, who had formerly been ground\r\ndown by the ameers’ government. For military purposes, Sinde was made a\r\ndivision, under the Bombay presidency.\r\n\r\nSinde, at the commencement of the mutiny, contained about seven thousand\r\ntroops of all arms, native and European. The military arrangements had\r\nbrought much distinction to Colonel (afterwards Brigadier-general) John\r\nJacob, whose ‘Sinde Irregular Horse’ formed a corps much talked of in\r\nIndia. It consisted of about sixteen hundred men, in two regiments of\r\neight hundred each, carefully drilled, and armed and equipped in the\r\nEuropean manner, yet having only five European officers; the squadron\r\nand troop commanders were native officers. The brigadier uniformly\r\ncontended that it was the best cavalry corps in India; and that the\r\nefficiency of such a regiment did _not_ depend so much on the number of\r\nEuropean officers, as on the manner in which they fulfilled their\r\nduties, and the kind of discipline which they maintained among the men.\r\nOn these points he was frequently at issue with the Bengal officers; for\r\nhe never failed to point out the superiority of the system in the Bombay\r\narmy, where men were enlisted irrespective of caste, and where there\r\nwere better means of rewarding individual merit.[33] Nationally\r\nspeaking, they were not Sindians at all; being drawn from other parts of\r\nIndia, in the ratio of three-fourths Mohammedans to one-fourth Hindoos.\r\n\r\nWhen the mutiny began in the regions further east, ten or twelve\r\npermanent outposts on the Sinde frontier were held by detachments of the\r\nSinde Irregular Horse, of forty to a hundred and twenty men each, wholly\r\ncommanded by native officers. These men, and the head-quarters at\r\nJacobabad (a camp named after the gallant brigadier), remained faithful,\r\nthough sometimes tempted by sepoys and troopers of the Bengal army. A\r\ncurious correspondence took place later in the year, through the medium\r\nof the newspapers, between Brigadier Jacob and Major Pelly on the one\r\nside, and Colonel Sykes on the other. The colonel had heard that Jacob\r\nridiculed the greased cartridge affair, as a matter that would never be\r\nallowed to trouble _his_ corps; and he sought to shew that it was no\r\nsubject for laughter: ‘Brigadier John Jacob knows full well that if he\r\nwere to order his Mohammedan soldiers (though they may venerate him) to\r\nbite a cartridge greased with pigs’ fat, or his high-caste troopers to\r\nbite a cartridge greased with cows’ fat, both the one and the other\r\nwould promptly refuse obedience, and in case he endeavoured to enforce\r\nit, they would shoot him down.’ Jacob and Pelly at once disputed this;\r\nthey both asserted that the Mohammedans and Hindoos in the Sinde Horse\r\nwould never be mutinous on such a point, unless other sources of\r\ndissatisfaction existed, and unless they believed it was _purposely_\r\ndone to insult their faith. ‘If it were really necessary,’ said the\r\nbrigadier, ‘in the performance of our ordinary military duty, to use\r\nswine’s fat or cows’ fat, or anything else whatever, not a word or a\r\nthought would pass about the matter among any members of the Horse, and\r\nthe nature of the substances made use of would not be thought of or\r\ndiscussed at all, except with reference to the fitness for the purpose\r\nto which they were to be applied.’ The controversialists did not succeed\r\nin convincing each other; they continued to hold diametrically opposite\r\nopinions on a question intimately connected with the early stages of the\r\nmutiny—thereby adding to the perplexities of those wishing to solve the\r\nimportant problem: ‘What was the cause of the mutiny?’\r\n\r\nOwing partly to the great distance from the disturbed provinces of\r\nHindostan, partly to the vicinity of the well-disposed Bombay army, and\r\npartly to the activity and good organisation of Jacob’s Irregular Horse,\r\nSinde was affected with few insurgent proceedings during the year. At\r\none time a body of fanatical Mohammedans would unfurl the green flag,\r\nand call upon each other to fight for the Prophet. At another time,\r\ngangs of robbers and hill-men, of which India has in all ages had an\r\nabundant supply, would take advantage of the troubled state of public\r\nfeeling to rush forth on marauding expeditions, caring much for plunder\r\nand little for faith of any kind. At another, alarms would be given\r\nwhich induced European ladies and families to take refuge in the forts\r\nor other defensive positions at Kurachee, Hydrabad, Shikarpore,\r\nJacobabad, &c., where English officers were stationed. At another,\r\nregiments of the Bengal army would try to tamper with the fidelity of\r\nother troops in Sinde. But of these varied incidents, few were so\r\nserious in results as to need record here. One, interesting in many\r\nparticulars, arose out of the following circumstance: When some of the\r\nSinde forces were sent to Persia, the 6th Bengal irregular cavalry\r\narrived to supply their place. These troopers, when the mutiny was at\r\nleast four months old, endeavoured to form a plan with some Beloochee\r\nMohammedans for the murder of the British officers at the camp of\r\nJacobabad. A particular hour on the 21st of August was named for this\r\noutrage, in which various bands of Beloochees were invited to assist.\r\nThe plot was revealed to Captain Merewether, who immediately confided in\r\nthe two senior native officers of the Sinde Irregular Horse. Orders were\r\nissued that the day’s proceedings should be as usual, but that the men\r\nshould hold themselves in readiness. Many of the border chiefs\r\nafterwards sent notice to Merewether of what had been planned,\r\nannouncing their own disapproval of the conspiracy. At a given hour, the\r\nleading conspirator was seized, and correspondence found upon him\r\ntending to shew that the Bengal regiment having failed in other attempts\r\nto seduce the Sinde troops from their allegiance, had determined to\r\nmurder the European officers as the chief obstacles to their scheme. The\r\nauthorities at Jacobabad wished Sir John Lawrence to take this Bengal\r\nregiment off their hands; but the experienced chief in the Punjaub would\r\nnot have the dangerous present; he thought it less likely to mutiny\r\nwhere it was than in a region nearer to Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe troops in the province of Sinde about the middle of August were\r\nnearly as follows: At Kurachee—the 14th and 21st Bombay native infantry;\r\nthe 2d European infantry; the depôt of the 1st Bombay Fusiliers; and the\r\n3d troop of horse artillery. At Hydrabad—the 13th Bombay native\r\ninfantry; and a company of the 4th battalion of artillery. At\r\nJacobabad—the 2d Sinde irregular horse; and the 6th Bengal irregular\r\ncavalry. At Shikarpore and Sukur, the 16th Bombay native infantry; and a\r\ncompany of the 4th battalion of artillery. The whole comprised about\r\nfive thousand native troops, and twelve hundred Europeans.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, when thanks were awarded by parliament to those who\r\nhad rendered good service in India, the name of Mr Frere, commissioner\r\nfor Sinde, was mentioned, as one who ‘has reconciled the people of that\r\nprovince to British rule, and by his prudence and wisdom confirmed the\r\nconquest which had been achieved by the gallant Napier. He was thereby\r\nenabled to furnish aid wherever it was needed, at the same time\r\nconstantly maintaining the peace and order of the province.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  This will be a suitable place in which to introduce two tabular\r\n  statements concerning the military condition of India at the\r\n  commencement of the mutiny. All the occurrences narrated hitherto\r\n  are those in which the authorities at Calcutta were compelled to\r\n  encounter difficulties without any reinforcements from England, the\r\n  time elapsed having been too short for the arrival of such\r\n  reinforcements.\r\n\r\n  _Military Divisions of India._—At the period of the outbreak, and\r\n  for some time afterwards, India was marked out for military purposes\r\n  into divisions, each under the command of a general, brigadier, or\r\n  other officer, responsible for all the troops, European and native,\r\n  within his division. The names and localities of these divisions are\r\n  here given; on the authority of a military map of India, engraved at\r\n  the Topographical Depôt under the direction of Captain Elphinstone\r\n  of the Royal Engineers, and published by the War Department. Each\r\n  division was regarded as belonging to, or under the control of, one\r\n  of the three presidencies. We shall therefore group them under the\r\n  names of the three presidential cities, and shall append a few words\r\n  to denote locality:\r\n\r\n                       UNDER CALCUTTA GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n        Name.

The Company, to respond to\r\n  this wish, caused an elaborate return to be prepared, from which a\r\n  few entries are here selected. The names and limits of the military\r\n  divisions correspond nearly, but not exactly, to those in the above\r\n  list.\r\n\r\n                      BENGAL ARMY, MAY 10, 1857.\r\n\r\n            Military Divisions.

The natives, in like manner, include all\r\n  grades, from subadars down to sepoys and sowars. The Punjaub, it\r\n  will be seen, alone contained 40,000 troops. The troops were\r\n  stationed at 160 cantonments, garrisons, or other places. As shewing\r\n  gradations of rank, the Europeans comprised 2271 commissioned\r\n  officers, 1602 non-commissioned officers, and 18,815 rank and file;\r\n  the natives comprised 2325 commissioned officers, 5821\r\n  non-commissioned officers, and 110,517 rank and file.

The ratio of Europeans to\r\n  native troops was rather higher in the Madras army (about 20 per\r\n  cent.) than in that of Bengal (19 per cent.) More fully made out in\r\n  some particulars, it was less instructive in others; the Madras list\r\n  pointed out the location of all the detachments of each regiment,\r\n  whereas the Bengal list gave the actual numbers at each station,\r\n  without mentioning the particular regiments of which they were\r\n  composed. Hence the materials for comparison are not such as they\r\n  might have been had the lists been prepared on one uniform plan.\r\n  There were about 36 stations for these troops, but the places which\r\n  they occupied in small detachments raised the total to a much higher\r\n  number. Although Pegu is considered to belong to the Bengal\r\n  presidency, it was mostly served by Madras troops.

They became\r\n  furious, and secretly planned a revolt. They carried their plans into\r\n  execution at an early hour on the following morning. We were\r\n  immediately apprised of it, and I hastened to awake our poor children,\r\n  and all of us, half-clad, prayed for shelter at a Hindoo habitation.\r\n  Some vehicles had been prepared for us to escape, when the servants\r\n  desired us to conceal ourselves, as the sepoys were coming into the\r\n  garden. We returned to our hiding-place; the soldiers arrived; they\r\n  took away our carriages, and a shot was fired into the house where we\r\n  were concealed. The ball passed close to where our chaplain was\r\n  sitting, and slightly wounded a child in the leg. At the same moment\r\n  three soldiers, well armed, presented themselves at the door. The good\r\n  father, holding the holy sacrament, which he never quitted, advanced\r\n  to meet them. Several of us accompanied him. “We have orders to kill\r\n  you,” said the sepoys; “but we will spare you if you give us money. Go\r\n  out, all, that we may see there are no men concealed here.” Having\r\n  searched and found nothing, one of the soldiers raised his sabre over\r\n  the chaplain, and cried out: “You shall die.” “Mercy, in the name of\r\n  God!” exclaimed I. “I will open every press to shew you that there is\r\n  no money concealed here.” He followed me, and having satisfied himself\r\n  that there was no money, the soldiers went away. We then broke a hole\r\n  in the wall of our garden, and fled into the jungle. We had scarcely\r\n  escaped when thirty more sepoys entered the house; but the Almighty\r\n  preserved us from this danger. We were crossing the country, when a\r\n  faithful servant brought us to a house where several Europeans had\r\n  taken refuge. We breathed freely there for a moment, but the\r\n  government treasure was deposited there, and the house was soon\r\n  attacked by the mutinous sepoys. We believed that our last hour was at\r\n  hand; but the savages were too much occupied with pillage to notice\r\n  us, and the Europeans escaped. At this moment a Catholic soldier\r\n  offered to guide us to the fort, where we arrived at twelve o’clock.\r\n  We do not know how long we shall remain in the fort. The English\r\n  officers have treated us with the greatest kindness and attention, and\r\n  have supplied us with provisions both for ourselves and our pupils. We\r\n  trust we shall one day make our way to Bombay; but that will depend on\r\n  the orders we receive from the government.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  The brigadier’s confidence in his men was conditional on their\r\n  implicit obedience; and he was wont to affirm that his ‘Irregulars’\r\n  were as ‘regular’ in conduct and discipline as the Queen’s Life-guards\r\n  themselves. He would allow no religious scruples to interfere with\r\n  their military efficiency. On one occasion, during the _Mohurram_ or\r\n  Mohammedan religious festival in 1854, there was great uproar and\r\n  noise among ten thousand Mussulmans assembled in and near his camp of\r\n  Jacobabad to celebrate their religious festival. He issued a general\r\n  order: ‘The commanding officer has nothing to do with religious\r\n  ceremonies. All men may worship God as they please, and may act and\r\n  believe as they choose, in matters of religion; but no men have a\r\n  right to annoy their neighbours, or to neglect their duty, on pretence\r\n  of serving God. The officers and men of the Sinde Horse have the name\r\n  of, and are supposed to be, excellent soldiers, and not mad\r\n  fakeers.... He therefore now informs the Sinde Irregular Horse, that\r\n  in future no noisy processions, nor any disorderly display whatever,\r\n  under pretence of religion or anything else, shall ever be allowed in,\r\n  or in neighbourhood of, any camp of the Sinde Irregular Horse.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR COLIN CAMPBELL.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                   PREPARATIONS: CALCUTTA AND LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering on a narrative of the great military operations\r\nconnected with the siege of Delhi, and with Havelock’s brilliant advance\r\nfrom Allahabad to Cawnpore and Lucknow, it will be necessary to glance\r\nrapidly at the means adopted by the authorities to meet the difficulties\r\narising out of the mutiny—by the Indian government at Calcutta, and by\r\nthe imperial government in London. For, it must be remembered\r\nthat—however meritorious and indispensable may have been the services of\r\nthose who arrived in later months—the crisis had passed before a single\r\nadditional regiment from England reached the scene of action. There was,\r\nas we have seen in the note appended to the preceding chapter, a certain\r\ndefinite amount of European military force in India when the mutiny\r\nbegan; there were also certain regiments of the Queen’s army known to be\r\nat different spots in the region lying between the Cape of Good Hope on\r\nthe west and Singapore on the east; and it depended on the mode of\r\nmanaging those materials whether India should or should not be lost to\r\nthe English. There will therefore be an advantage in tracing the manner\r\nin which the Calcutta government brought into use the resources\r\nimmediately or proximately available; and the plans adopted by the home\r\ngovernment to increase those resources.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended in this place to discuss the numerous questions which\r\nhave arisen in connection with the moral and political condition of the\r\nnatives of India, or the relative fitness of different forms of\r\ngovernment for the development of their welfare. Certain matters only\r\nwill be treated, which immediately affected the proceedings of those\r\nintrusted with this grave responsibility at so perilous a time. Three\r\nsuch at once present themselves for notice, in relation to the Calcutta\r\ngovernment—namely, the military measures taken to confront the\r\nmutineers; the judicial treatment meted out to them when conquered or\r\ncaptured; and the precautions taken in reference to freedom of public\r\ndiscussion on subjects likely to foster discontent.\r\n\r\nFirst, in relation to military matters. England, by a singular\r\ncoincidence, was engaged in two Asiatic wars at the time when the Meerut\r\noutbreak marked the commencement of a formidable mutiny. Or, more\r\nstrictly, one army was returning after the close of a war with Persia;\r\nwhile another was going out to begin a war with China. It will ever\r\nremain a problem of deep significance what would have become of our\r\nIndian empire had not those warlike armaments, small as they were, been\r\non the Indian seas at the time. The responsible servants of the Company\r\nin India did not fail to recognise the importance of this problem—as\r\nwill be seen from a brief notice of the plans laid during the earlier\r\nweeks of the mutiny.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, three days after the troubles began at Meerut, Mr\r\nColvin, lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces, telegraphed to\r\nCalcutta, suggesting that the returning force from Persia should be\r\nordered round to Calcutta, in order to be sent inland to strengthen the\r\nfew English regiments by which alone the Revolt could be put down. On\r\nthe next day, Viscount Canning, knowing that the Queen’s 43d foot and\r\nthe 1st Madras Fusiliers were at Madras, telegraphed orders for those\r\ntwo regiments to be forwarded to Calcutta—seeing that the Bengal\r\npresidency was more likely than that of Madras to be troubled by\r\nmutinous sepoys. On the same day orders were sent to Pegu to bring the\r\ndepôt of the Queen’s 84th foot to Calcutta, the bulk of the regiment\r\nbeing already in or near that city. On the 16th, a message was sent to\r\nLord Elphinstone at Bombay, requesting him to send round to Calcutta two\r\nof the English regiments about to return from Persia; another message\r\nwas sent to Pegu, summoning every available soldier of the Queen’s 35th\r\nfoot from Rangoon and Moulmein; and orders were issued that all\r\ngovernment river-steamers and flats in India should be held ready for\r\narmy use. On the 17th, Lord Harris at Madras telegraphed to Canning,\r\nrecommending him to stop the army going to China under Lord Elgin and\r\nGeneral Ashburnham, and to render it immediately available for Indian\r\nwants. It was on this day, too, that Sir John Lawrence announced his\r\nintention of disarming the Bengal sepoys in the Punjaub, and of raising\r\nnew Punjaub regiments in their stead; and that Mr Frere, commissioner of\r\nSinde, was ordered by Lord Elphinstone to send the 1st Bombay Europeans\r\nfrom Kurachee up the Indus to Moultan, and thence to Ferozpore. On the\r\n18th, Canning telegraphed to Elphinstone, naming the two regiments—the\r\nQueen’s 78th foot and the 2d Europeans—which were to be sent round to\r\nCalcutta, together with artillery; on the same day Elphinstone\r\ntelegraphed to Canning that he would be able to send the Queen’s 64th as\r\nwell as 78th foot; and on the same day the authorities at Sinde arranged\r\nfor sending a Beloochee regiment up from Hydrabad to Ferozpore. On the\r\n19th, the Madras Fusiliers started for Calcutta; and on the same day Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence, to strengthen his military command in Oude, was raised\r\nfrom the rank of colonel to that of brigadier-general. Without dwelling,\r\nday by day, on the proceedings adopted, it will suffice to say that,\r\nduring the remaining period of May, the Madras Fusiliers, which were\r\ndestined to render such good service under the gallant Neill, arrived at\r\nCalcutta; that the Queen’s 64th and 78th made their voyage from Bombay\r\nto Calcutta; and that steamers were sent to Ceylon to bring as many\r\nroyal troops as could be spared from that island.\r\n\r\nWhen June arrived, the same earnest endeavours were made to bring troops\r\nto bear upon the plague-spots of mutiny. Orders were sent to transfer a\r\nwing of the Queen’s 29th foot from Pegu, the 12th Lancers from Bombay,\r\nand cavalry horses from Bushire and elsewhere, to Calcutta. Later in the\r\nmonth, messages were transmitted to Madras, commanding the sending to\r\nCalcutta of everything that had been prepared there for the service of\r\nthe expedition to China; such as tents, clothing, harness, and\r\nnecessaries; but it was at the same time known that the regiments on\r\nthat service available for India could be very few for a considerable\r\ntime to come—the only certain news being of the 5th Fusiliers, which\r\nleft Mauritius on the 23d of May, and the 90th foot, which left England\r\non the 18th of April. Towards the close of the month, an arrangement was\r\nmade for accepting the aid of an army of Nepaulese from Jung Bahadoor,\r\nto advance from Khatmandoo through Goruckpore towards Oude—a matter on\r\nwhich Lord Canning was much criticised, by those who thought the\r\narrangement ought to have been made earlier. As soon as news reached\r\nCalcutta of the death of General Anson, Sir Patrick Grant,\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Madras army, was summoned from Madras to hold\r\nthe office of commander-in-chief of the army of Bengal, subject to\r\nsanction from the home authorities. When he had accepted this\r\nprovisional appointment, and had arrived at Calcutta, Sir Patrick wrote\r\na ‘memorandum,’ expressing his views of his own position towards the\r\nsupreme government. It was to the effect that—seeing that there was in\r\nfact no native army to rely upon; that the European army was very small;\r\nand that this army had to operate on many different points, in portions\r\neach under its own commandant—it would be better for the\r\ncommander-in-chief to remain for a while at Calcutta, than to move about\r\nfrom station to station. If near the seat of government, he would be in\r\ndaily personal communication with the members of the supreme council; he\r\nwould learn their views in relation to the innumerable questions likely\r\nto arise; and he would be in early receipt of the mass of intelligence\r\nforwarded every day to Calcutta from all parts of India. On these\r\ngrounds, Sir Patrick proposed to make Calcutta his head-quarters. All\r\nthe members of the council—Canning, Dorin, Low, J. P. Grant, and\r\nPeacock—assented at once to these views; the governor-general added: ‘I\r\nam of opinion, however, that as soon as the course of events shall tend\r\nto allay the general disquiet, and to shew to what points our force\r\nshould be mainly directed, with the view of crushing the heart of the\r\nrebellion, it will be proper that his excellency should consider anew\r\nthe question of his movements.’\r\n\r\nAs it was difficult in those days of interrupted dâks and severed wires\r\nto communicate intelligence between Calcutta and Lahore, the general\r\nofficers in the Punjaub and Sirhind made the best readjustment of\r\noffices they could on hearing of Anson’s death; but when orders could be\r\ngiven from Calcutta, Sir Henry Barnard, of the Sirhind division, was\r\nmade commander of the force against Delhi; General Penny, from Simla,\r\nreplaced General Hewett at Meerut; General Reid, of the Peshawur\r\ndivision, became temporary commander in the west until other\r\narrangements could be made; and Brigadier Cotton was appointed to the\r\ncommand at Peshawur, with Colonel Edwardes as commissioner. Later in the\r\nmonth, when Henry Lawrence was hemmed in at Lucknow, Wheeler beleaguered\r\nat Cawnpore, and Lloyd absorbed with the affairs of Dinapoor brigade,\r\ncommands were given to Neill and Havelock, the one from Madras and the\r\nother from the Persian expedition; while Outram, who had been commander\r\nof that expedition, also returned to assume an important post in India.\r\nSeveral colonels of individual regiments received the appointment of\r\nbrigadier-general, in command of corps of two or more regiments; and in\r\nthat capacity became better known to the public than as simple\r\ncommandants of regiments.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of July arrived, the British troops in India, though\r\nlamentably few for the stern work to be done, were nevertheless\r\nincreasing in number; but it is doubtful whether, at the end of the\r\nmonth, the number was as large as at the beginning; for many desperate\r\nconflicts had taken place, which terribly thinned the European ranks.\r\nThe actual reinforcements which arrived at Calcutta during eight months,\r\nirrespective of any plans laid in England arising out of news of the\r\nmutiny, consisted of about twenty regiments, besides artillery. Some of\r\nthese had been on the way from England before the mutiny began; the 84th\r\nfoot arrived in March from Rangoon; none arrived in April; in May\r\narrived the 1st Madras Fusiliers; in June, the 35th, 37th, 64th, and\r\n78th Queen’s regiments, together with artillery belonging to all the\r\nthree presidential armies; in July, the 5th Fusiliers, the 90th foot,\r\nand a wing of the 29th; in August, the 59th foot, a military train, a\r\nnaval brigade from Hong Kong, and royal marines from the same place; in\r\nSeptember, the 23d Welsh Fusiliers, 93d Highlanders, four regiments of\r\nMadras native infantry (5th, 17th, 27th, and 36th), and detachments of\r\nartillery and engineers; in October, the 82d foot, the 48th Madras\r\nnative infantry, and recruits for the East India Company’s service—all\r\nthese, be it again remarked, were troops which reached Calcutta without\r\nany reference to the plans laid by the home government to quell the\r\nmutiny; those which came from England started before the news was known;\r\nthe rest came from Rangoon, Moulmein, Madras, Bombay, Ceylon, Mauritius,\r\nHong Kong, Cape of Good Hope, &c. A few observations may be made in\r\nconnection with the above list—that some of these regiments were native\r\nMadras troops, on whom reliance was placed to fight manfully against the\r\nBengal sepoys; that some of the Madras companies advanced inland to\r\nBengal, without taking the sea-voyage to Calcutta; that no cavalry\r\nwhatever were included in the list; and that the list does not include\r\nthe regiments which advanced from Bombay or Kurachee towards the\r\ndisturbed districts.\r\n\r\nCavalry, just adverted to, was the arm of the service in which the\r\nIndian government was throughout the year most deficient. During a long\r\nperiod of peace the stud-establishments had been somewhat neglected; and\r\nas a consequence, there were more soldiers able and willing to ride,\r\nthan horses ready to receive them. In the artillery and baggage\r\ndepartments, also, the supply of horses was very deficient. When news of\r\nthis fact reached Australia, the colonists bestirred themselves to\r\nascertain how far they could assist in remedying the deficiency. The\r\nwhole of New South Wales was divided into eight districts, and\r\ncommittees voluntarily undertook the duty of ascertaining how many\r\navailable horses fit for cavalry were obtainable in each district.\r\nColonel Robbins was sent from Calcutta to make purchases; and he was\r\nenabled to obtain several hundred good strong horses at prices\r\nsatisfactory both to the stock-farmers and to the government. The good\r\neffected by the committees consisted in bringing together the possible\r\nsellers and the willing buyer.\r\n\r\nBy what means the troops, as they arrived at Calcutta from various\r\nquarters, were despatched to the scene of action in the upper provinces,\r\nand by what difficulties of every kind this duty was hampered—need not\r\nbe treated here; sufficient has been said on this subject in former\r\npages.\r\n\r\nWe pass to the second of the three subjects marked out, in reference to\r\nthe proceedings at Calcutta for notice—the arrangements for preventing\r\nthe mutiny of native troops, or for punishing those who had already\r\nmutinied: a very important and anxious part of the governor-general’s\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for all classes in India, there was a hostile feeling\r\ntowards the governor-general, entertained by many of the European\r\ninhabitants unconnected with the Company; they accused him of favouring\r\nthe natives at the expense of the English. There was also a sentiment of\r\ndeep hatred excited against the natives, owing to the barbarous\r\natrocities perpetrated by the mutinous sepoys and the rabble budmashes\r\non the unfortunate persons at the various military and civil stations of\r\nthe Company during the course of the Revolt. There was at the same time\r\na certain jealousy existing between the military and civil officers in\r\nIndia. These various feelings conspired to render the supreme government\r\nat Calcutta, and especially Viscount Canning as its head, the butt for\r\nincessant ridicule and the object of incessant vituperation. When the\r\nmutiny was many months old, the Calcutta government gave a full reply to\r\ninsinuations which it would have been undignified to rebut at the time\r\nwhen made, and which, indeed, would have fallen with little force on the\r\npublic mind while convulsed with passion at the unparalleled news from\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIt was repeatedly urged upon the governor-general to proclaim martial\r\nlaw wherever the Europeans found or fancied themselves in peril; to\r\nencounter the natives with muskets and cannon instead of courts of\r\njustice; and to adopt these summary proceedings all over India. In\r\nreply, Viscount Canning states that this was actually done wherever it\r\nwas necessary, and as soon as it could answer any good purpose. Martial\r\nlaw was proclaimed in the Delhi province in May; in the Meerut province\r\nabout the same time; in Rohilcund on the 28th of the same month; in the\r\nAgra province in May and the early part of June; in the Ajmeer district\r\non the 12th of June; in Allahabad and Benares about the same date; in\r\nNeemuch also at the same time; in the Patna district on the 30th of\r\nJune; and afterwards in Nagpoor. In the Punjaub and Oude, governed by\r\nspecial regulations, it was not necessary that martial law should be\r\nproclaimed, but the two Lawrences acted as if it was. Martial law, where\r\nadopted, was made even more stringent than in European countries; for\r\nthere only military men take part in courts-martial; whereas in India,\r\nthe military officers at the disposal of the government being too few\r\nfor the performance of such duties at such a time, an act of the\r\nCalcutta legislature was passed directly after the news from Meerut\r\narrived, authorising military officers to establish courts-martial for\r\nthe trial of mutineers and others, and empowering them to obtain the aid\r\nat such courts, not only of the Company’s civil servants, but of\r\nindigo-planters and other Europeans of intelligence and of independent\r\nposition. On the 30th of May, to meet the case of a rebellious populace\r\nas well as a mutinous soldiery, another act was passed authorising all\r\nthe local executive governments to issue special commissions for the\r\nsummary trial of delinquents, with power of life and death in addition\r\nto that of forfeiture of property—without any tedious reference to the\r\nordinary procedures of the law-courts. On the 6th of June a third act\r\nwas passed, intended to reach those who, without actually mutinying or\r\nrebelling, should attempt to excite disaffection in the native army, or\r\nshould harbour persons guilty of that offence; general officers were\r\nempowered to appoint courts-martial, and executive bodies to appoint\r\nspecial commissions, to try all such offenders at once and on the spot,\r\nand to inflict varying degrees of punishment according to the offence.\r\nSome time afterwards a fourth act gave an extended application of these\r\nstringent measures to India generally. In all these instances Europeans\r\nwere specially exempted from the operation of the statutes. The enormous\r\npowers thus given were largely executed; and they were rendered still\r\nmore formidable by another statute, enabling police-officers to arrest\r\nwithout warrant persons suspected of being mutineers or deserters, and\r\nrendering zemindars punishable if they failed to give early information\r\nof the presence of suspicious persons on their respective estates. ‘Not\r\nonly therefore,’ says the governor-general in council, ‘is it not the\r\ncase that martial law was not proclaimed in districts in which there was\r\na necessity for it; but the measures taken for the arrest, summary\r\ntrial, and punishment of heinous offenders of every class, civil as well\r\nas military, were far more widely spread and certainly not less\r\nstringent than any that could have resulted from martial law.’\r\n\r\nThe outcry against Viscount Canning became so excessively violent in\r\nconnection with two subjects, that the Court of Directors sought for\r\nexplanations from him thereon, superadded to the dispatches forwarded in\r\nthe regular course. The one referred to the state of Calcutta; the other\r\nto the proceedings of special commissioners in the Allahabad district. A\r\npetition was presented from about two hundred and fifty inhabitants of\r\nCalcutta, praying that martial law should at once be proclaimed\r\nthroughout the whole of the Bengal presidency; on the ground that the\r\nwhole native population was in a disaffected state, that the native\r\npolice were as untrustworthy as the native soldiery, and that the\r\nCompany’s civil authorities were wholly unable to cope with an evil of\r\nso great magnitude. The governor-general in council declined to accede\r\nto this request. He urged in reply—that there was no evidence of the\r\nnative population of Bengal being in so disaffected a state as to render\r\nmartial law necessary; that such law had already been enforced in the\r\nnorthwest provinces, where the mutineers were chiefly congregated; that\r\nin Bengal the native police, aided by the European civilians, would\r\nprobably be strong enough to quell ordinary disturbances; that, as all\r\nhis European troops were wanted to confront the mutinous sepoys, he had\r\nnone to spare for ordinary police duties; and that in Calcutta\r\nespecially, where a zealous volunteer guard had been organised, the\r\npeace might easily be preserved by ordinary watchfulness on the part of\r\nthe European inhabitants. This reply was in many quarters interpreted\r\ninto a declaration that the natives would be petted and favoured more\r\nthan the Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe second charge, as stated above, related to the proceedings in\r\nthe Allahabad district. When the power of appointing special\r\ncommissions for trying the natives was given, the civilians in that\r\nregion entered on the duty in a more stern manner than anywhere\r\nelse. In about forty days a hundred and seventy natives were tried,\r\nof whom a hundred were put to death. When a detailed report of the\r\nproceedings reached Calcutta, grave doubts were entertained whether\r\nthe offences generally were proportionate to the punishment. Many\r\npersons had been put to death for having plundered property in their\r\npossession, without being accused of having actually been engaged in\r\nmutiny; some were put to death for obtaining by threats salary that\r\nwas not due to them from the revenue establishments; several others\r\nfor ‘robbing their masters,’ and some for ‘plundering salt;’ six\r\nwere condemned to death in one day for having in their possession\r\nmore rupees than they could or would account for. The question\r\nforced itself on Lord Canning’s attention, whether such offences and\r\nsuch punishments as these were intended to be met by the\r\nextraordinary tribunals established in time of danger. The culprits\r\nmight have been and probably were rogues; but it did not follow that\r\nthey deserved death at the hands of civilians, irrespective of\r\nmilitary proceedings. The Calcutta authorities considered, from all\r\nthe information that reached them, that these large powers ‘had been\r\nin some cases unjustly and recklessly used; that the indiscriminate\r\nhanging, not only of persons of all shades of guilt, but of those\r\nwhose guilt was at the least very doubtful, and the general burning\r\nand plunder of villages, whereby the innocent as well as the guilty,\r\nwithout regard to age or sex, were indiscriminately punished, and in\r\nsome instances sacrificed,’ were unjustifiable. It further became\r\nmanifest that ‘the proceedings of the officers of government had\r\ngiven colour to the rumour, which was industriously spread and\r\ncredulously received in all parts of the country, that the\r\ngovernment meditated a general bloody prosecution of Mohammedans and\r\nHindoos in revenge for the crimes of the sepoys, and only awaited\r\nthe arrival of European troops to put this design into execution.’\r\nThis led the governor-general to issue a resolution on the 31st of\r\nJuly, containing detailed instructions for the guidance of civil\r\nofficers in the apprehension, trial, and punishment of natives\r\ncharged with or suspected of offences. This resolution was\r\ninterpreted by the opponents of Viscount Canning as a check upon all\r\nthe heroes who were fighting the battles of the British against the\r\nmutinous natives; but it was afterwards clearly shewn that the\r\nresolution applied, and was intended to apply, only to the civil\r\nservants, among whom such vast powers were novel and often\r\nsusceptible of abuse; it did not cramp the energies of generals or\r\nmilitary commanders who might feel that martial law was necessary to\r\nthe successful performance of their duties. So obstructive, however,\r\nwas the bitter hostility felt in many quarters against the supreme\r\ngovernment at Calcutta, that it led to a ready belief in charges\r\nwhich were afterwards shewn to be wholly untrue. When the Northwest\r\nProvinces had fallen into such utter anarchy by the mutiny, that the\r\nrule of the lieutenant-governor was little better than a name, a new\r\ngovernment was formed called the Central Provinces, comprising the\r\nregions of Goruckpore, Benares, Allahabad, the Lower Doab,\r\nBundelcund, and Saugor, and placed under the lieutenant-governorship\r\nof Mr Grant, who had until that time been one of the members of the\r\nsupreme council. A rumour reached London, and was there credited\r\nthree months before Viscount Canning knew aught concerning it, that\r\n‘Mr Grant had liberated a hundred and fifty mutineers or rebels\r\nplaced in confinement by Brigadier-general Neill.’ As a consequence\r\nof this rumour, it was often asserted in London that Mr Grant was\r\nmore friendly to the native mutineers than to the British soldiery.\r\nKnowing the gross improbability of such a story, Viscount Canning at\r\nonce appealed to the best authority on the subject—Mr Grant himself.\r\nIt then appeared that the lieutenant-governor had never pardoned or\r\nreleased a single person seized by Neill or any other military\r\nauthority; that he had never commuted or altered a single sentence\r\npassed by such authorities; that he had never written to or even\r\nseen Neill; that he had neither found fault with, nor commented\r\nupon, any of that general’s proceedings—in short, the charge was an\r\nunmitigated, unrelieved falsehood from beginning to end. As a mere\r\n_canard_, the governor-general would not have noticed it; but the\r\ncalumny assumed historical importance when it affected public\r\nopinion in England during a period of several months.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the third subject marked out—the attitude of the Indian\r\ngovernment towards the European population. It has been shewn in former\r\nchapters that, when the mutinies began, addresses were presented from\r\nvarious classes of persons at Calcutta, some expressing alarm, but all\r\ndeclaratory of loyalty. Similar declarations were made at Madras and\r\nBombay—two cities of which we have said little, because they were\r\nhappily exempt from insurgent difficulties. A few lines will suffice to\r\nshew the relation between these two cities and Calcutta, as seats of\r\npresidential government. Madras is situated on the east coast, far down\r\ntowards Ceylon—perhaps the worst port in the world for the arrival and\r\ndeparture of shipping, on account of the peculiar surf that rages near\r\nthe shore. Fort St George, the original settlement, is the nucleus\r\naround which have collected the houses and buildings which now\r\nconstitute Madras. As Calcutta is called ‘Fort William’ in official\r\ndocuments, so is Madras designated ‘Fort St George.’ The principal\r\nstreets out of the fort constitute ‘Black Town.’ Bombay, on the opposite\r\ncoast, boasts of a splendid harbour that often excites the envy of the\r\nMadras inhabitants. The city is built on two or three islands, which are\r\nso connected by causeways and other constructions as to enclose a\r\nmagnificent harbour. Nevertheless Madras has the larger population, the\r\nnumbers being seven hundred and twenty thousand against five hundred and\r\nsixty thousand. So far as this Chronicle is concerned, both cities may\r\npass without further description. Each was a metropolis, in all that\r\nconcerned military, judicial, and civil proceedings; and each remained\r\nin peace during the mutiny, chiefly owing to the native armies of Madras\r\nand Bombay being formed of more manageable materials than that of\r\nBengal. Lord Harris at the one city, and Lord Elphinstone at the other,\r\nreceived numerous declarations of loyalty from the natives; and were\r\nenabled to render military service to the governor-general, rather than\r\nseek aid from him.\r\n\r\nIn Calcutta, there was more difficulty than in Madras and Bombay. The\r\ngovernment had to defend itself against Europeans as well as natives. It\r\nhas already been stated that great hostility was shewn towards this\r\ngovernment by resident Europeans not belonging to the Company’s service.\r\nOn the one side, the Company was accused of regarding India as a golden\r\negg belonging to its own servants; on the other, the Company sometimes\r\ncomplained that missionaries and newspapers encouraged disaffection\r\namong the natives. This had been a standing quarrel long before the\r\nmutiny broke out. As ministers of religion, missionaries of various\r\nChristian denominations were allowed to pursue their labours, but\r\nwithout direct encouragement. They naturally sympathised with the\r\nnatives; but, however pure may have been their motive, it must be\r\nadmitted that the missionaries often employed language that tended to\r\nplace the Company and the natives in the antagonistic position of the\r\ninjurers and the injured. In September 1856 certain missionaries in the\r\nBengal presidency presented a memorial, setting forth in strong terms\r\nthe deplorable social condition of the natives—enumerating a series of\r\nabuses and defects in the Indian government; and recommending the\r\nappointment of a commission of inquiry, to comprise men of independent\r\nminds, unbiassed by official or local prejudices. The alleged abuses\r\nbore relation to the police and judicial systems, gang-robberies,\r\ndisputes about unsettled boundaries, the use of torture to extort\r\nconfession, the zemindary system, and many others. The memorialists\r\nasserted that if remedies were not speedily applied to those abuses, the\r\nresult would be disastrous, as ‘the discontent of the rural population\r\nis daily increasing, and a bitter feeling of hatred towards their rulers\r\nis being engendered in their minds.’ Mr Halliday, lieutenant-governor of\r\nBengal, in reply to the memorial, pointed out the singular omission of\r\nthe missionaries to make any even the most brief mention of the numerous\r\nmeasures undertaken by the government to remove the very evils\r\ncomplained of; thereby exhibiting a one-sided tendency inimical to the\r\nends of justice. He declined to accede to the appointment of a\r\ncommission on these grounds: That without denying the existence of great\r\nsocial evils, ‘the government is in possession of full information\r\nregarding them; that measures are under consideration, or in actual\r\nprogress, for applying remedies to such of them as are remediable by the\r\ndirect executive or legislative action of the government; while the cure\r\nof others must of necessity be left to the more tardy progress of\r\nnational advancement in the scale of civilisation and social\r\nimprovement.’ He expressed his ‘absolute dissent from the statement\r\nmade, doubtless in perfect good faith, that the people exhibit a spirit\r\nof sullen discontent, on account of the miseries ascribed to them; and\r\nthat there exists amongst them that bitter hatred to the government\r\nwhich has filled the memorialists, as they declare, with alarm as well\r\nas sorrow.’ The British Indian Association, consisting of planters,\r\nlanded proprietors, and others, supported the petition for the\r\nappointment of a commission, evidently with the view of fighting the\r\nmissionaries with their own weapons, by shewing that the missionaries\r\nwere exciting the natives to disaffection. Mr Halliday declined to rouse\r\nup these elements of discord; Viscount Canning and the supreme council\r\nsupported him; and the Court of Directors approved of the course\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier weeks of the mutiny, or rather before the mutiny had\r\nactually begun, the colonel of a regiment at Barrackpore, as has already\r\nbeen shewn, brought censure upon himself by taking the duties of a\r\nmissionary or Christian religious teacher among his own troops. Whatever\r\njudgment may be passed on this officer, or on those who condemned him,\r\nit is at least important to bear in mind that, throughout the whole\r\nduration of the mutiny and the battles consequent on it, one class of\r\ntheorists persisted in asserting that the well-meant exertions of pious\r\nChristians had alarmed the prejudices of the native soldiers, and had\r\nled to the Revolt. Right or wrong, this theory, and the line of conduct\r\nthat had led to it, greatly increased the embarrassments of the\r\ngovernor-general, and rendered it impossible for him to pursue a line of\r\nconduct that would please all parties.\r\n\r\nMuch more hostile, however, was the feeling raised against him in\r\nrelation to an important measure concerning newspapers—turning against\r\nhim the bitter pens of ready writers who resented any check placed upon\r\ntheir licence of expression. On the 13th of June, the legislative\r\ncouncil of Calcutta, on the motion of the governor-general, passed an\r\nact whereby the liberty of the press in India was restricted for one\r\nyear. The effect of this law was to replace the Indian press, for a\r\ntime, very much in the position it occupied before Sir Charles\r\nMetcalfe’s government gave it liberty in 1835. Sir Thomas Munro and\r\nother experienced persons had, long before this last-named date,\r\nprotested against any analogy between England and India, in reference to\r\nthe freedom of the press. Sir Thomas was connected with the Madras\r\ngovernment; but his observations were intended to apply to the whole of\r\nBritish India. In 1822 he said: ‘I cannot view the question of a free\r\npress in this country without feeling that the tenure by which we hold\r\nour power never has been and never can be the liberties of the people.\r\nWere the people all our own countrymen, I would prefer the utmost\r\nfreedom of the press; but as they are, nothing could be more dangerous\r\nthan such freedom. In place of spreading useful knowledge among the\r\npeople and tending to their better government, it would generate\r\ninsubordination, insurrection, and anarchy.... A free press and the\r\ndominion of strangers are things which are incompatible, and which\r\ncannot long exist together. For what is the first duty of a free press?\r\nIt is to deliver the country from a foreign yoke, and to sacrifice to\r\nthis one great object every meaner consideration; and if we make the\r\npress really free to the natives as well as to Europeans, it must\r\ninevitably lead to this result.’ Munro boldly, whether wisely or not,\r\nadopted the theory of India being a conquered country, and of the\r\nnatives being more likely to write against than for their English\r\nrulers, if allowed unfettered freedom of the press. He pointed out that\r\nthe restrictions on this freedom were really very few; extending only to\r\nattacks on the character of government and its officers, and on the\r\nreligion of the natives. In reply to a suggestion that the native press\r\nmight be placed under restriction, without affecting the Indo-British\r\nnewspapers read by Europeans, he said: ‘We cannot have a monopoly of the\r\nfreedom of the press; we cannot confine it to Europeans only. There is\r\nno device or contrivance by which this can be done.’ In fine, he\r\ndeclared his opinion that if the native press were made free, ‘it must\r\nin time produce nearly the same consequences here which it does\r\neverywhere else; it must spread among the people the principles of\r\nliberty, and stimulate them to expel the strangers who rule over them,\r\nand to establish a national government.’ When the liberty of the press\r\nwas made free and full in 1835, the Court of Directors severely censured\r\nSir Charles Metcalfe’s government for having taken that step without\r\npermission from London, and directed that the subject should be\r\nreconsidered; but Lord Auckland, who succeeded Sir Charles as\r\ngovernor-general, pointed out what appeared to him the difficulty of\r\nrescinding the liberty when once granted; and the directors yielded,\r\nthough very unwillingly. The minute, in which the alteration of the law\r\nwas made in 1835, was from the pen of Mr (afterwards Lord) Macaulay; but\r\nthis eminent person at the same time admitted that the governor-general\r\nhad, and ought to have, a power suddenly to check this liberty of the\r\npress in perilous times. The members of the supreme council at Calcutta,\r\nin their minutes on this subject, asserted the power and right of the\r\ngovernment to use the check in periods of exigency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  General View of MADRAS.—From a Drawing by Thomas Daniell.\r\n]\r\n\r\nViscount Canning, conceiving that all his predecessors had recognised\r\nthe possible necessity of curbing the liberty of the press, considered\r\nwhether the exigency for so doing had arrived. He found that it would be\r\nof little use to control the native press unless that of the English\r\nwere controlled also; because he wished to avoid invidious distinctions;\r\nand because some of the newspapers, though printed in the English\r\nlanguage, were written, owned, and published by natives, almost\r\nexclusively for circulation among native readers. The natives, it was\r\nfound, were in the habit of procuring English newspapers, not only those\r\npublished in India, but others published in England, and of causing the\r\npolitical news relating to their own country to be translated and read\r\nto them. This might not be amiss if the government were made responsible\r\nfor such articles only as emanated from it; but the natives were often\r\ngreatly alarmed at articles and speeches directed against them, or\r\nagainst their usages and religion, in the Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay\r\nnewspapers—not by the government, but by individual writers. The\r\nnewspaper press in India, whether English or native, has generally been\r\ndistinguished by great violence in the mode of opposing the government;\r\nthis violence, in times of peace, was disregarded by those against whom\r\nit was directed; but at a time when a hundred thousand native troops\r\nwere more or less in mutiny, and when Mohammedan leaders were\r\nendeavouring to enlarge this military revolt into a national rebellion,\r\nViscount Canning and his colleagues deemed it right to place a\r\nrestriction on the liberty of the press, during the disturbed state of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BOMBAY.—From a View in the Library of the East India Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\nVery little has hitherto been known in England concerning the native\r\nnewspapers of India; for few except the Company’s servants have come in\r\ncontact with them. Their number is considerable, but the copies printed\r\nof each are exceedingly limited. In the Agra government alone, a few\r\nyears ago, there were thirty-four native papers, of which the aggregate\r\ncirculation did not reach _two thousand_, or less than sixty each on an\r\naverage. Some appeared weekly, some twice a week. Some were printed in\r\nPersian, others in Oordoo, others in Hindee. About twenty more were\r\npublished in various towns in the northwest regions of India. A few were\r\nsensible, many more trivial, but nearly all abusive of the government.\r\nAs estimated by an English standard, the extremely small circulation\r\nwould have rendered them wholly innocuous; but such was not the case in\r\nthe actual state of affairs. The miserably written and badly\r\nlithographed little sheets of news had, each, its group of men seated\r\nround a fluent reader, and listening to the contents; one single copy\r\nsufficed for a whole regiment of sepoys; and it was observed, during a\r\nyear or two before the Revolt, that the sepoys listened with unwonted\r\neagerness to the reading of articles grossly vituperative of the\r\ngovernment. The postal reform, effected by the Marquis of Dalhousie,\r\nexceeding in liberality even that of England itself, is believed to have\r\nled to an unexpected evil connected with the dissemination of seditious\r\nintelligence in India. To save expense, he placed natives instead of\r\nEuropeans in most of the offices connected with this service; and it\r\nappears probable, from facts elicited during the mutiny, that Hindoo and\r\nMohammedan postmasters were far too well acquainted with the substance\r\nof many of the letters which passed through their hands.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to state that Lord Harris, governor of the\r\npresidency of Madras, dwelt on the unfair tone of the British press in\r\nIndia, before the actual commencement of the mutiny at Meerut. On the 2d\r\nof May he made a minute commencing thus: ‘I have now been three years in\r\nIndia, and during that period have made a point of keeping myself\r\nacquainted with the tenor of the larger portion of the British press,\r\nthroughout the country; and I have no hesitation in asserting my\r\nimpression to be that it is, more particularly in this presidency,\r\ndisloyal in tone, un-English in spirit, and wanting in principle—seeking\r\nevery opportunity, whether rightly or wrongly, of holding up the\r\ngovernment to opprobrium.’ He denied that any analogy could be furnished\r\nfrom the harmlessness of such attacks in the home country; because, in\r\nEngland, ‘every man is certain of having an opportunity of bringing his\r\ncase before the public, either by means of rival newspapers or in\r\nparliament.’ This facility is not afforded in India; and thus the\r\nnewspaper articles are left to work their effects uncompensated. ‘I do\r\nnot see how it is possible for the natives, in the towns more\r\nespecially, with the accusations, misrepresentations, and calumnies\r\nwhich are constantly brought before them, to come to any other\r\nconclusion than that the government of their country is carried on by\r\nimbecile and dishonest men.’\r\n\r\nThe legislative statute of the 13th of June may be described in a few\r\nwords. All printing-presses, types, and printing-machinery throughout\r\nBritish India were, by virtue of this act, to be registered, and not\r\nused without licence from the government. Magistrates were empowered to\r\norder a search of suspected buildings, and a seizure of all unregistered\r\nprinting-apparatus and printed paper found therein. All applications for\r\na printing-licence were to be made on oath of the proprietor, with full\r\nparticulars on certain specified matters. The licence might be refused\r\nor granted; and, if granted, might be at any time revoked. A copy of\r\nevery paper, sheet, or book was required to be sent to the authorities,\r\nimmediately on being printed. The government, by notice in the\r\ngovernment gazette, might prohibit the publication of the whole or any\r\npart of any book or paper, either in the whole or any part of India; and\r\nthis was equally applicable whether the book or paper were printed in\r\nIndia or any other country. The penalty—for using unlicensed\r\nprinting-machinery, or for publishing in defiance of a gazette order—was\r\na fine of 5000 rupees (£500), or two years’ imprisonment, or both. This\r\npunishment was so rigorous, that the instances were very few in which\r\nthe press disobeyed the new law; it produced great exasperation in some\r\nquarters; but the proprietors of newspapers generally placed such a\r\ncheck upon editors and writers as to prevent the insertion of such\r\narticles as would induce the government to withdraw the\r\nprinting-licence.\r\n\r\nSo alien are such restrictions to the genius of the English people, that\r\nnothing but dire necessity could have driven the Calcutta government to\r\nmake them. They must be judged by an Indian, not an English standard. It\r\nis well to remark, however, as shewing the connection of events, that\r\nthis statute was one cause of the violent attacks made against Lord\r\nCanning in London; the freedom, checked in India, appeared in stronger\r\nform than ever when several of the writers came over to England, or sent\r\nfor printing in England books or pamphlets written in India. When one of\r\nthese editors arrived in London, he brought with him a petition or\r\nmemorial, signed by some of the Europeans at Calcutta not connected with\r\nthe government, praying for the removal of Viscount Canning from the\r\noffice held by him.\r\n\r\nHaving thus passed in review three courses of proceeding adopted by the\r\nIndian government consequent on the outbreak—in reference to military\r\noperations, to judicial punishments, and to public opinion—we will now\r\nnotice in a similarly rapid way the line of policy adopted by the home\r\ngovernment to stem the mutiny, and by the British nation to succour\r\nthose who had suffered or were suffering by it.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 27th of June that the government, the parliament, and the\r\npeople of England were startled with the news that five or six native\r\nregiments had revolted at Meerut and Delhi, and that the ancient seat of\r\nthe Mogul Empire was in the hands of mutineers and rebels. During some\r\nweeks previously, observations had occasionally been made in parliament,\r\nrelating to the cartridge troubles at Barrackpore and Berhampore; but\r\nthe ministers always averred that those troubles were slight in\r\ncharacter. The Earl of Ellenborough, who had been governor-general from\r\n1842 to 1844, and who possessed extensive knowledge of Indian affairs\r\ngenerally, had also drawn attention occasionally to the state of the\r\nIndian armies. While India was in commotion, but six or seven weeks\r\nbefore England was aware of that fact, the earl asked the ministers (on\r\nMay 19th) what arrangements had been made for reinforcing the British\r\narmy in India. Lord Panmure, as war-minister, replied that certain\r\nregiments intended for India had been diverted from that service and\r\nsent to China; but that four other regiments would be ready to depart\r\nfrom England about the middle of June, to relieve regiments long\r\nstationed in the East Indies; irrespective of four thousand recruits for\r\nthe Company’s service. On the 9th of June Lord Ellenborough expressed\r\nsuspicions that a mutinous feeling was being engendered among the\r\nsepoys, by a fear on their part that their religion was about to be\r\ntampered with; this expression of opinion led to various counter-views\r\nin both Houses of parliament.\r\n\r\nTwo or three paragraphs may here be usefully given, to shew to how great\r\nan extent the number and distribution of European troops in India had\r\nbeen a subject of consideration among the governing authorities, both at\r\nCalcutta and in London. Towards the close of 1848 the Marquis of\r\nDalhousie drew attention to the propriety, or even necessity, of\r\nincreasing the European element in the Indian armies; and, to this end,\r\nhe suggested that an application should be made to the crown for three\r\nadditional regiments of the royal army. This was attended to; three\r\nregiments being promptly sent. In March 1849, consequent on the\r\noperations in the Punjaub, application was made for two more Queen’s\r\nregiments; which was in like manner quickly responded to. All these\r\nadditions, be it observed, were to be fully paid for by the Company.\r\nThese five regiments, despatched during the early months of 1849,\r\ncomprised 220 commissioned officers, and 5335 non-commissioned, rank and\r\nfile. In 1853, after the annexation of Pegu, the marquis wrote home to\r\nannounce that that newly-acquired province could not be securely held\r\nwith a less force than three European regiments, eight native regiments,\r\nand a proportionate park of artillery; and he asked: ‘Whence is this\r\nforce to be derived?’ The British empire in India was growing; the\r\nEuropean military element, he urged, must grow with it; and he demanded\r\nthree new regiments from England to occupy Pegu, seeing that those\r\nalready in India were required in the older provinces and presidencies.\r\nThere were at that time five regiments of European cavalry in India, all\r\nbelonging to the Queen’s army; and thirty regiments of European\r\ninfantry, of which twenty-four were Queen’s, and the remaining six\r\nbelonging to the Company. As the crown retained the power of drawing\r\naway the royal regiments from India at any time of emergency, the\r\nmarquis deemed it prudent that the three additional regiments required\r\nshould belong to the Company, one to each presidential army, and not to\r\nthe royal forces. The Company, by virtue of the act passed that year\r\n(1853), obtained permission to increase the number of European troops\r\nbelonging absolutely to it in India; and, that permission being\r\nobtained, three additional regiments were planned in the year, to\r\ncomprise about 2760 officers and men. Only two out of the three,\r\nhowever, were really organised. When the war with Russia broke out in\r\n1854, a sudden demand was made for the services of several of the\r\nQueen’s regiments in India—namely, the 22d, 25th, 96th, and 98th foot,\r\nand the 10th Hussars; at the same time, as only the 27th and 35th foot\r\nwere ordered out to India, the royal troops at the disposal of the\r\ngovernor-general were lessened by three regiments. This step the Marquis\r\nof Dalhousie, and his colleagues at Calcutta, most earnestly deprecated.\r\nA promise was made that two more regiments, the 82d and 90th foot,\r\nshould be sent out early in 1855; but the marquis objected to the\r\nweakening of the Indian army even by a single English soldier. In a long\r\ndispatch, he dwelt upon the insufficiency of this army for the\r\nconstantly increasing area of the British army in India. The European\r\narmy in India, the Queen’s and the Company’s together, was in effect\r\nonly two battalions stronger in September 1854 than it had been in\r\nJanuary 1847; although in that interval of nearly eight years the\r\nPunjaub, Pegu, and Nagpoor, had been added to British India. The army\r\nwas so scattered over this immense area, that there was only one\r\nEuropean battalion between Calcutta and Agra, a distance of nearly eight\r\nhundred miles. The marquis earnestly entreated the imperial government\r\nnot to lessen his number, already too small, of European troops—not only\r\nbecause the area to be defended had greatly increased; but because many\r\nof the princes of India were at that time looking with a strange\r\ninterest at the war with Russia, as if ready to side with the stronger\r\npower, whichever that might be. There were symptoms of this kind in\r\nPegu, in Nepaul, and elsewhere, which he thought ought not to be\r\ndisregarded. No document penned by the marquis throughout his eight\r\nyears’ career in India was more energetic, distinct, or positive than\r\nthis; he protested respectfully but earnestly against any further\r\nweakening of the European element in his forces. The home government,\r\nhowever, had engaged in a war with a great power which needed all its\r\nresources; the withdrawal of the regiments was insisted on; and the\r\ngovernor-general was forced to yield.\r\n\r\nThe year 1855 presented nothing worthy of comment in relation to the\r\nIndian armies; but in February 1856, just on surrendering the reins of\r\ngovernment to Viscount Canning, the Marquis of Dalhousie drew up a\r\nminute bearing on this subject. At that time, fifteen months before the\r\ncommencement of the mutiny at Meerut, there were thirty-three regiments\r\nof European infantry in India.[34] The marquis sketched a plan for so\r\nredistributing the forces as to provide for the principal stations\r\nduring peace, and also for a field-army in case of outbreak in Cabool,\r\nCashmere, Nepaul, Ava, or other adjacent states; he required two\r\nadditional regiments to effect this, and shewed how the whole\r\nthirty-five might most usefully be apportioned between the three\r\npresidencies.[35] He suggested that this number of 24 Queen’s regiments\r\nof foot should be a _minimum_, not at any time reducible by the imperial\r\ngovernment without consent of the Indian authorities; he remembered the\r\nCrimean war, and dreaded the consequence of any possible future war in\r\ndepriving India of royal troops. These were suggestions, made by the\r\nMarquis of Dalhousie when about to leave India; they possessed no other\r\nauthority than as suggestions, and do not appear to have been taken\r\nofficially into consideration until the mutiny threw everything into\r\nconfusion. During the later months of 1856, Viscount Canning, the new\r\ngovernor-general, drew the attention of the Court of Directors to the\r\nfact that the English officers in the native regiments had become far\r\ntoo few in number; some were appointed to irregular corps, others to\r\ncivil duties, until at length the regiments were left very much\r\nunder-officered. As a means of partially meeting this want, the\r\ndirectors authorised in September that every regular native infantry or\r\ncavalry regiment should have two additional officers, one captain and\r\none lieutenant; and that each European regiment in the Company’s service\r\nshould have double this amount of addition. In the same month it was\r\nannounced by the military authorities in London that the two royal\r\nregiments, 25th and 89th, _borrowed_ from India for the Russian war in\r\n1854, should be replaced by two others early in 1857; and that at the\r\nsame time two additional regiments of Queen’s foot should be sent out,\r\nto relieve the 10th and 29th, which had been in India ever since 1842.\r\n\r\nThe year of the mutiny, 1857, witnessed the completion of the military\r\narrangement planned in 1856, and the organisation of others arising out\r\nof the complicated state of affairs in Persia, China, and India. About\r\nthe middle of February, the second division of the army intended for the\r\nPersian expedition left Bombay, making, with the first division, a force\r\nof about 12,000 men under the command of Sir James Outram. About 4000 of\r\nthat number were European troops.[36] Viscount Canning, speculating on\r\nthe probability that a third division would be needed, pointed out that\r\nIndia could not possibly supply it; and that it would be necessary that\r\nthe home government should send out, not only the four regiments already\r\nagreed on, but three others in addition, and that the 10th and 29th\r\nregiments should not return to Europe so early as had been planned.\r\nThere was another complication, arising out of the Chinese war; the 82d\r\nand 90th foot, intended to replace the two regiments withdrawn from\r\nIndia during the Crimean war, were now despatched to the Chinese seas\r\ninstead of to India; and the directors had to make application for two\r\nothers. Early in May, before any troubles in India were known to the\r\nauthorities in London, it was arranged that the plan of 1856 should be\r\nrenewed—two Queen’s regiments to be sent out to replace those withdrawn\r\nfor the Crimean war; and two others to relieve the 10th and\r\n29th—bringing the royal infantry in India to the usual number of\r\ntwenty-four regiments. Of these four regiments, two were to proceed to\r\nCalcutta, one to Madras, and one to Kurachee. They were to consist of\r\nthe 7th Fusiliers, the 88th and 90th foot, and the 3d battalion of the\r\nRifle Brigade. It was also planned that the 2d and 3d Dragoons should go\r\nout to India to relieve the 9th Lancers and 14th Dragoons. Furthermore,\r\nit was arranged that these six regiments should take their departure\r\nfrom England in June and July, so as to arrive in India at a favourable\r\nseason of the year; and that with them should go out drafts from\r\nChatham, in number sufficient to complete the regiments already in India\r\nup to their regular established strength. So far as concerned Persia,\r\nthe proposed third division was not necessary; the Shah assented to\r\nterms which—fortunately for British India—not only rendered this\r\nincreased force unnecessary, but set free the two divisions already\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the European element in the Indian army at, and\r\nsome time before, the commencement of the mutiny. It was on the 27th of\r\nJune, we have said, that the bad news from Meerut reached London. Two\r\ndays afterwards, the Court of Directors ordered officers at home on\r\nfurlough or sick-leave to return to their regiments forthwith, so far as\r\nhealth would permit. They also made a requisition to the government for\r\nfour full regiments of infantry, in addition to those already decided\r\non; to be returned, or replaced by other four, when the mutiny should be\r\nended. On the 1st of July—shewing thereby the importance attached to the\r\nsubject—the government announced, not only its acquiescence in the\r\ndemand, but the numbers or designations of the regiments marked\r\nout—namely, the 19th, 38th, and 79th foot, and the 1st battalion of the\r\n1st foot. It was also agreed to that the four regiments intended to have\r\nbeen relieved—namely, the 10th and 29th foot, and the 9th and 14th\r\nDragoons—should _not_ be relieved at present, but that, on the contrary,\r\ndrafts should go out to reinforce them. Another mail arrived, making\r\nknown further disasters; whereupon the directors on the 14th of July\r\nmade another application to government for _six_ more regiments of\r\ninfantry, and eight companies of royal artillery—the artillerymen to be\r\nsent out from England, the horses from the Cape of Good Hope, and the\r\nguns and ammunition to be provided in India itself. Two days\r\nafterwards—so urgent did the necessity appear—the government named the\r\nsix regiments which should be sent out in compliance with this\r\nrequisition—namely, the 20th, 34th, 42d, 54th, and 97th foot, and the 2d\r\nbattalion of the Rifle Brigade; together with two troops of\r\nhorse-artillery, and six companies of royal (foot) artillery.\r\n\r\nSumming up all these arrangements, therefore, we find the following\r\nresult: Two regiments of royal infantry—7th Fusiliers and 88th foot—were\r\nto go to India, to replace two borrowed or withdrawn from the Company in\r\n1854; two others—the 90th foot and the 3d battalion of the Rifle\r\nBrigade—to relieve the 10th and 29th foot, and two regiments of\r\ncavalry—the 2d and 3d Dragoons—to relieve the 9th Lancers and 14th\r\nDragoons, but the four relieved regiments not to return till the mutiny\r\nshould be quelled; four regiments of infantry—the 19th, 38th, and 79th\r\nfoot, and the 1st battalion of the 1st foot—to go out in consequence of\r\nthe bad news received from India at the end of June; six regiments of\r\ninfantry—the 20th, 34th, 42d, 54th, 97th, and 2d battalion of the Rifle\r\nBrigade—together with several troops and companies of artillery, were to\r\ngo out in consequence of the still more disastrous news received in the\r\nmiddle of July; drafts were to go out to bring up to the full strength\r\nthe whole of the Queen’s regiments in India; and, lastly, recruits were\r\nto go out, to bring up to the full complement the whole of the European\r\nregiments belonging to the Company. These various augmentations to the\r\nstrength of armed Europeans in India amounted to little less than\r\ntwenty-four thousand men, all placed under orders by the middle of July.\r\n\r\nVarious discussions bearing on the military arrangements for India, took\r\nplace in the two houses of parliament. Lord Ellenborough frequently\r\nrecommended the embodiment of the militia and the calling out of the\r\nyeomanry, in order that England might not be left defenceless by sending\r\na very strong royal army to India. The Earl of Hardwicke suggested that\r\nall the troops at Aldershott camp, about sixteen thousand in number,\r\nshould at once be sent off to India. These, and other members of both\r\nHouses, insisted on the perilous position of India; whereas the\r\nministers, in their speeches if not in their proceedings, treated the\r\nmutiny as of no very serious importance. Differences of opinion existed\r\nto a most remarkable extent; but the president of the Board of Control,\r\nMr Vernon Smith, subjected himself at a later period to very severe\r\ncriticism, on account of the boldness of the assertions made, or the\r\nextent of the ignorance displayed, in the earlier stages of the mutiny.\r\nWhen the news from Meerut and Delhi arrived, he said in the House of\r\nCommons: ‘I hope that the House will not be carried away by any notion\r\nthat we exaggerate the danger because we have determined upon sending\r\nout these troops. It is a measure of security alone with respect to the\r\ndanger to be apprehended. I cannot agree with the right honourable\r\ngentleman (Mr Disraeli) that our Indian empire is imperiled by the\r\npresent disaster. I say that our Indian empire is _not_ imperiled; and I\r\nhope that in a short time the disaster, dismal as it is, will be\r\neffectually suppressed _by the force already in that country_....\r\nLuckily the outrage has taken place at Delhi; because it is notorious\r\nthat that place _may be easily surrounded_; so that if we could not\r\nreduce it by force, we could by famine.... Unfortunately, the mail left\r\non the 28th of May; and I cannot, therefore, apprise the House that the\r\nfort of Delhi has been razed to the ground; but I hope that ample\r\nretribution has by this time been inflicted on the mutineers.’ That\r\nother persons, military as well as civil, felt the mutiny to be a wholly\r\nunexpected phenomenon, is true; but this minister obviously erred by his\r\npositive assertions; his idea of ‘easily surrounding’ a walled city\r\nseven miles in circuit was preposterous; and there was displayed an\r\nunpardonable ignorance of the state of the armies in that country in the\r\nfurther assertion that ‘there are troops in India equal to _any_\r\nemergency.’\r\n\r\nA question of singular interest and of great importance arose—how should\r\nthe reinforcements of troops be sent to India? But before entering on\r\nthis, it will be well to notice the arrangements made for providing a\r\ncommander for them when they should reach their destination. As soon as\r\nit was known in London, early in July, that General Anson was dead, the\r\ngovernment appointed Sir Colin Campbell as his successor. The\r\nprovisional appointment of Sir Patrick Grant as commander of the forces\r\nin India was approved as a judicious step on the part of the Calcutta\r\ngovernment; but, rightly or wrongly, the permanent appointment to that\r\nhigh office had come to be considered a ministerial privilege in London;\r\nand thus Sir Colin was sent out to supersede Sir Patrick. Fortunately,\r\nthe general selected carried with him the trust and admiration of all\r\nparties. For a time, it is true, there was a disposition to foster a\r\nCampbell party and a Grant party among newspaper writers. One would\r\ncontend that Sir Colin, though a brave and good soldier, and without a\r\nsuperior in command of a brigade, had nevertheless been without\r\nopportunity of shewing those powers of combination necessary for the\r\nsuppression of a wide-spread mutiny, perhaps the reconquest of an\r\nimmense empire; whereas Sir Patrick was just the man for the occasion,\r\npossessing the very experience, temper, and other qualities for dealing\r\nwith the native soldiers. On the other hand, it was contended that\r\nCampbell was something more than a mere general of brigade, having\r\nsuccessfully commanded masses of troops equal in extent to armies during\r\nthe Punjaub war; whereas Grant, being by professional education and\r\nmilitary sympathies a Bengal officer—although afterwards commander at\r\nMadras—had imbibed that general leaning towards the sepoys which\r\nrendered such officers unfit to deal sternly with them in time of\r\ndisaffection. Happily, this controversy soon came to an end; Sir Colin\r\nwas pronounced by the public verdict to be the right man, without any\r\ndisparagement to Sir Patrick; and it was judiciously suggested by the\r\nEarl of Ellenborough that the last-named general might, with great\r\nadvantage to the state, be made a military member of the supreme council\r\nat Calcutta, to advise the governor-general on army and military\r\nsubjects. The nation recognised in Sir Colin the soldierly promptness\r\nwhich had distinguished Wellington and Napier, and which he illustrated\r\nin the following way: On the morning of Saturday the 11th of July, the\r\nnews of General Anson’s death reached London; at two o’clock on the same\r\nday a cabinet council was held; immediately after the council an\r\ninterview took place between the minister of war and the commander of\r\nthe forces; consequent on this interview, Sir Colin Campbell was offered\r\nthe post of commander-in-chief in India; he accepted it; he was asked\r\nhow soon he could take his departure; his reply was ‘To-morrow;’ and,\r\ntrue to his word, he left England on the Sunday evening—taking very\r\nlittle with him but the clothes on his back. Men felt that there would\r\nbe no unnecessary amount of ‘circumlocution’ in the proceedings of such\r\na general—a veteran who had been an officer in the army forty-nine\r\nyears; and who, during that long period, had served in the Walcheren\r\nexpedition; then in the Peninsular battles and sieges of Vimieira,\r\nCorunna, Barossa, Vitoria, San Sebastian, and Bidassoa; then in North\r\nAmerica; then in the West Indies; then in the first Chinese war; then in\r\nthe second Sikh war; and lastly in the Crimea.\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell, as a passenger remarkably free from luggage and\r\nbaggage of every kind, was able to take advantage of the quickest route\r\nto India—by rail to Folkestone, steam to Boulogne, rail to Marseille,\r\nsteam to Alexandria, rail and other means to Suez, and thence steam to\r\nCalcutta. Whether the troops could take advantage of this or any other\r\nkind of _swift_ conveyance, was a question whereon public authorities\r\nand public advisers soon found themselves at variance. There were four\r\nprojects—to proceed through France to Alexandria and Suez; to reach\r\nAlexandria by sea from Southampton; to steam from England to Calcutta\r\nround the Cape of Good Hope; and to take this last-named route by\r\nsailing-ships instead of steamers. A few words may usefully be said on\r\neach of these four plans.\r\n\r\nAs the overland route through France is the quickest, some advisers\r\nurged that it would therefore be the best; but this was by no means a\r\nnecessary inference. It would require an immense amount of changing and\r\nshifting. Thrice would the men of the various regiments have to enter\r\nrailway-trains—at London or some other English station, at Boulogne, and\r\nat Alexandria—perhaps also a fourth time at Paris; thrice would they\r\nhave to leave railway-trains—at Folkestone, at Marseille, and at Cairo\r\nor some other place in Egypt; thrice would they have to embark in\r\nsteamers—at Folkestone, at Marseille, and at Suez; and thrice would they\r\nhave to disembark—at Boulogne, at Alexandria, and at Calcutta. The\r\ndifficulties incidental to these many changes would be very great,\r\nalthough of course not insuperable. There would, in addition, be\r\ninvolved a delicate international question touching the passage of large\r\nbodies of troops through the territories of another sovereign. The\r\nEmperor of France, at a time of friendly alliance, would possibly have\r\ngiven the requisite permission; but other considerations would also have\r\nweight; and it is, on the whole, not surprising that the route through\r\nFrance was left unattempted.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, from difficulties in the French route, that\r\nthe sea-route to Alexandria would be unavailable; on the contrary, that\r\nmode of transit found many advocates. The distance from Southampton to\r\nAlexandria is about three thousand miles; and this distance could\r\nobviously be traversed, in a number of days easy of estimate, by a\r\nsteamer requiring no transhipment of cargo. Another steamer would make\r\nthe voyage from Suez to Calcutta; and an overland passage through Egypt\r\nwould complete the route. This is a much shorter route to Calcutta than\r\nthat _viâ_ the Cape of Good Hope, in the ratio of about eight thousand\r\nmiles to twelve thousand; it is adopted for the heavy portion of the\r\nIndia mail; and many persons thought it might well be adopted also for\r\nthe transmission of troops. The ministers in parliament, however,\r\nexplained their reasons for objecting to this route. These objections\r\nreferred principally to steamers and coal, of which there were no more\r\nin the Indian seas than were necessary for the mail service. The matter\r\nwas argued thus: The first mail from England, after the news of the\r\nmutiny, left on the 10th of July; it would reach Bombay about the 10th\r\nof August; a return mail would start from Bombay on the 16th of August,\r\ndescribing the arrangements made for receiving at Suez any troops sent\r\nby the Egyptian route; that letter would reach London about the 16th of\r\nSeptember; and if troops were sent off immediately, with everything\r\nprepared, they could not have reached India till towards the end of\r\nOctober—four months after the receipt of the first disastrous news from\r\nMeerut. A vessel by the Cape route, if sent off _at once_, would reach\r\nas soon. This argument depended wholly on the assumption that it would\r\nbe necessary to spend three months in sending and receiving messages,\r\nbefore the troops could safely be started off from Southampton to\r\nAlexandria. Some of those who differed from the government on this point\r\nadmitted that only a small number of troops could be conveyed by this\r\nroute, owing to the unfinished state of the land-conveyance from\r\nAlexandria to Suez.[37] The thirty miles of sandy desert to be\r\ntraversed, either by marching or in vehicles, would necessarily entail\r\nmuch difficulty and confusion if the number of troops were large,\r\nespecially as neither the isthmus nor its railway belonged to England.\r\nThen, again, there are questions concerning calms, storms, monsoons,\r\ntrade-winds, shoals, and coral reefs, which were warmly discussed by the\r\nadvocates of different systems; some of whom contended that the Red Sea\r\ncannot safely be depended on by ship-loads of troops during the second\r\nhalf of the year; while others argued that the dangers of the route are\r\nvery slight. On the one side, it was represented that, by adopting the\r\nSuez route, there would be many changes in the modes of travel, many\r\nsources of confusion wherever those changes were made, many\r\nuncertainties whether there would be steamers ready at Suez, many doubts\r\nabout the supply of coal at Aden and elsewhere, many perils of wreck in\r\nand near the Red Sea, much deterioration of health to the troops during\r\nthe hot weather in that region, and much embarrassment felt by Viscount\r\nCanning if the troops came to him faster than he could transfer them up\r\nthe country. Certain of these government doubts were afterwards admitted\r\nto be well founded; others were shewn to be erroneous; and though a few\r\nregiments were sent by the Suez route later in the year, it became\r\npretty generally admitted, that if only one or two regiments had taken\r\nthat route _early in July_, the benefit to India would have been very\r\ngreat, and the difficulties not more than might have been easily\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nNext for consideration was the Cape route. Those who admitted that the\r\noverland journey was suited only for a _small_ body of troops, and not\r\nfor an army of thirty thousand men, had yet to settle whether\r\nsailing-ships or steamers were best fitted for this service. In some\r\nquarters it was urged: ‘Employ our screw war-steamers; we are at peace\r\nin Europe, and can send our soldiers quickly by this means to India,\r\nwithout the expense of chartering steamers belonging to companies or\r\nprivate persons. If sufficient bounties are offered, in one week we\r\ncould obtain seamen enough to man twenty war-steamers. Take the main\r\nand lower-deck guns out of the ships; place fifteen hundred troops in\r\neach of the large screw line-of-battle ships; and man each ship with\r\nhalf the war complement, the soldiers themselves serving as marines.’\r\nTo this it was replied that line-of-battle ships would be dearer\r\nrather than cheaper than chartered vessels, because they could not\r\nlessen the charge by back-cargoes. Sir Charles Napier contended,\r\nmoreover, that screw war-steamers could not be fitted out as\r\ntroop-ships in less than three months after the order was given; and\r\nthat great difficulty would be found in raising men for them. The\r\ngovernment was influenced by these or similar considerations; for no\r\ntroops were sent out in war-vessels—possibly owing to a prudential\r\nwish to keep all war-ships ready for warlike exigencies.\r\n\r\nThere remained, lastly, the question whether, the Cape route being\r\nadopted, it would be better to hire steam-ships or sailing-ships for\r\nconveying troops to India. Eager inquiries on this question were made in\r\nparliament soon after the news of the outbreak arrived. The ministers,\r\nin reference to the superiority of steamers over sailing-ships, stated\r\nthat, from the difficulty in procuring steamers of the requisite kind,\r\nand the delay caused by the number of intermediate points at which they\r\nwould have to touch for coal, steamers would probably not reach the\r\nIndian ports more quickly than sailing-ships. Lord Ellenborough admitted\r\nthat, when he was in India, sailing-vessels were found better than\r\nsteamers for India voyages in the autumnal half of the year; but this\r\nleft untouched the important improvements effected in steam-navigation\r\nduring the intervening period of fourteen years. The battle was much\r\ncontested. Sir Charles Wood, First Lord of the Admiralty, pointed out\r\nthat fast sailing-ships often went from England to Calcutta in 90 to 100\r\ndays; that auxiliary screws had been known to take from 90 to 120 days;\r\nand therefore that we were not certain of quicker voyages by steam than\r\nby sail, even (which was doubtful) if coal enough were procurable at the\r\nCape. This roused the advocates of steaming, who complained that the\r\nminister had compared quick sailing-ships with slow steamers. Mr Lindsey\r\nasserted that the average duration of twenty-two sail-voyages was 132\r\ndays; and that the steam-average would not exceed 94 days. Another\r\nauthority averred that the average of ninety-eight sail-voyages was 130\r\ndays; and that of seven screw-steam voyages, 93 days.\r\n\r\nSuch were a few of the points brought under consideration, in connection\r\nwith the schemes for sending troops to India. We mention them here,\r\nbecause they bore intimately on the mutiny and its history. A compromise\r\nbetween the various schemes was effected by the government, in this\r\nway:—The ten thousand troops intended to be sent out, as reinforcements,\r\nreliefs, and recruits, _before_ the news of the disasters reached\r\nEngland, were despatched as originally intended, in ordinary\r\nsailing-vessels; the four thousand additional troops, immediately\r\napplied for by the Company, were despatched, half in screw-steamers, and\r\nhalf in fast-sailing clippers; while the six thousand supplied on a\r\nstill later requisition were sent almost wholly in steamers. It was not\r\nuntil late in the year, when the slowness of most of the voyages had\r\nbeen made manifest, that the superiority of steaming became\r\nunquestionable—provided the various coal-depôts could be kept well\r\nsupplied. Setting aside all further controversy as to the best mode of\r\ntransit, the activity of the movements was unquestionable. In May and\r\nJune few of the regiments and ships were ready, and therefore few only\r\nwere despatched; but after that the rapidity was something remarkable.\r\nIn July more than thirty troop-laden ships departed from our shores,\r\ncarrying numbers varying from 131 to 438 soldiers each. August was a\r\nstill more busy month, in relation both to the number of ships and the\r\naverage freight of each; there being forty troop-laden ships, carrying\r\nfrom 208 to 1057 soldiers each. In July not a single steam-ship was\r\nincluded in the number; but in August nearly half were steamers. The\r\nmost remarkable shipments were those in the _James Baines_ clipper\r\nsailing-ship (1037 men of the 42d and 92d foot), the _Champion of the\r\nSeas_ clipper (1032 men of the 42d and 20th foot) and the _Great\r\nBritain_ screw-steamer (1057 men of the 8th Hussars and 17th Lancers).\r\nIn these three splendid ships the troops were conveyed with a degree of\r\ncomfort rarely if ever before attained in such service. While the\r\nnecessary arrangements were in progress for shipping off the twenty-four\r\nthousand men chosen by the middle of July, other plans were being\r\norganised for despatching further regiments; insomuch that, by the end\r\nof the year, very nearly forty thousand men had been sent off to the\r\nscene of mutiny. In what order and at what times these troops reached\r\ntheir destination, may usefully be noted in a later page. Towards the\r\nclose of the year the Suez route was adopted for a few regiments; and\r\nthe rapidity of passage was such as to lead to much expression of regret\r\nthat that route had not been adopted earlier—although an opinion\r\ncontinued to prevail on the part of the government and the Company that\r\nit would not have been practicable to send the bulk of the army by that\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nAnother important question arose during the year, how these troops ought\r\nto be clothed, and their health secured. English soldiers complain of\r\ntheir tightly buttoned and buckled garments in hot weather, even in an\r\nEnglish climate; but in an Indian summer the oppression of such clothing\r\nis very grievous; and much anxiety was manifested, when it became known\r\nthat thirty or forty thousand troops were to set out for the East, as to\r\nthe dress to be adopted. The War-office issued a memorandum on the\r\nsubject, chiefly with the view of allaying public anxiety;[38] but it\r\nbecame afterwards known that, owing to blunders and accidents similar to\r\nthose which so disastrously affected the Crimean army, the light\r\nclothing, even if sufficient in quantity, was not in the right place at\r\nthe right time; and our gallant men were only kept from complaining by\r\ntheir excitement at the work to be done. It must at the same time be\r\nadmitted that, owing to the slowness of the voyages, the majority of the\r\nreinforcements did not land in India till the intense heat of summer had\r\npassed. In reference to the important question of the health of the\r\ntroops, Dr James Harrison, of the Company’s service, drew up a series of\r\nrules or suggestions, for the use of officers in the management of their\r\ntroops. These rules, which received the approval of Sir Colin Campbell,\r\nbore relation to the hours of marching; the length of each march; the\r\nkind of beverage best for the soldier before starting; the\r\nmarching-dress in hot weather; the precautions against sitting or lying\r\nin wet clothes; the necessity for bathing; the best choice of food and\r\nthe best mode of cooking; the stimulants and beverages, &c.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to enumerate all the modes in which the\r\ngovernment, the legislature, and the press, sought to meet the\r\ndifficulties and remedy the evils arising out of the Indian mutiny; nor\r\nwould such an enumeration be necessary, further than concerned the\r\nreally practicable and adopted measures. At a time when each mail from\r\nIndia increased the sum-total of disastrous news, each grievance found\r\nits own peculiar expositor, who insisted that _that_ particular\r\ngrievance had been the main cause of the mutiny, and that a remedy must\r\nbe found in that particular direction. Nevertheless, in a series of\r\nshort paragraphs to close the present chapter, it may be possible to\r\nsketch the general character of the plans and thoughts that occupied the\r\npublic mind.\r\n\r\nRailways were not forgotten. It was strongly urged that if Indian\r\nrailways had been begun earlier, and carried to a further stage towards\r\ncompletion, the mutiny either could not have happened at all, or might\r\nhave been crushed easily by a small force having great powers of\r\nlocomotion. The disorders in India did not prevent the forwarding of\r\nschemes for new lines of railway—such as the Sinde Railway, from\r\nKurachee to Hydrabad, there to be connected with steamers up the Indus\r\nto Moultan; the Punjaub Railway, from Moultan to Lahore, there to join\r\nthe grand trunk railway; the Oude Railway, to supply Lucknow with a\r\nseries of lines radiating in various directions; and the East Bengal\r\nRailway, to accommodate the region eastward of Calcutta. But besides\r\nthese, the mutiny gave a new impetus to schemes for carrying railways\r\nacross Western Asia towards India; either from Scutari (opposite\r\nConstantinople) to Bagdad, or from Antioch to the Euphrates, with a\r\nrailway or a steam-route thence through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf.\r\nSome parts of these schemes were very wild; the projectors, in every\r\ncase, required guaranteed interest from government, on the ground that\r\nthe particular railway advocated would form a new and quick route from\r\nEngland to India available for government purposes; but as no guarantee\r\nwas forthcoming, the schemes remained in abeyance.\r\n\r\nElectric telegraphs did not fail to occupy a portion of public favour;\r\nand there is no question that their benefit was immense. Every lessening\r\nof the time for transmitting a message from India to London, or _vice\r\nversâ_, was so much gained to those responsible for quelling the mutiny.\r\nIn the middle of 1857, small portions of submarine cable were immersed\r\nin the Mediterranean; but by the end of the year the islands of Corsica,\r\nSardinia, Malta, and Corfu were all connected, greatly shortening the\r\ntime for transmitting a telegram from Alexandria to Marseille.\r\nSuperadded to this, the usefulness of the telegraph encouraged the\r\nprojectors of new lines—from Corfu to Alexandria; from Antioch to the\r\nEuphrates and the Persian Gulf; from Suez down the Red Sea to Aden and\r\nKurachee. Rival companies occupied much of the public attention; and,\r\nhad the British government been favourably disposed towards a guarantee\r\nor subsidy, engineers were not wanting who would have undertaken to\r\nconnect London with Calcutta by an unbroken wire.\r\n\r\nRiver-steaming was advocated as one of the great things needed for\r\nIndia. One scheme was for an Indus flotilla. Supposing a hundred miles\r\nof railway to be constructed from Kurachee to Hydrabad, then the Indus\r\nwould be reached at a point whence it is navigable to Moultan for five\r\nhundred and seventy miles; and it was proposed for this service to\r\nestablish a flotilla of fifteen steamers, fitted up for passengers and a\r\nlittle cargo, and each towing two flat-bottom barges for the conveyance\r\nof troops and heavy cargo. Irrespective of the success or failure of any\r\nparticular project, the establishment of steamers on the Indus was\r\nunquestionably a practical good to which India had a right to look\r\nforward; for, as a glance at a map will shew, the Indus instead of the\r\nGanges seems the natural route of communication from Europe to the upper\r\nprovinces of India. The Ganges provinces also would undergo an immense\r\ndevelopment of resources by the increase of steam-navigation on that\r\nnoble river.\r\n\r\nGun-boats for India did not fail to find advocates. It was deemed almost\r\na certainty that if light-draught vessels of this description had been\r\non two or three of the Indian rivers, especially the Ganges and the\r\nJumna, the mutineers would have met with formidable opponents; and even\r\nif the mutiny were quelled, a few gun-boats might act as a cheap\r\nsubstitute for a certain number of troops, in protecting places near the\r\nbanks of the great rivers. Impressed with this conviction, the East\r\nIndia Company commissioned Messrs Rennie to build a small fleet of\r\nhigh-pressure iron gun-boats; each to have one boiler, two engines, two\r\nscrew-propellers, and to carry a twelve-pounder gun amidships. The boats\r\nwere seventy-five feet long by twelve wide, and were so constructed as\r\nto be stowed away in the hold of a ship for conveyance from England to\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe means of locomotion or communication—railways, electric telegraphs,\r\nriver-steamers, river gun-boats—formed only one portion of the schemes\r\nwhich occupied public thought during the first six months of the mutiny.\r\nStill more attention was paid to men—men for fighting in India and for\r\ndefending our home-coasts. Shortly before the bad news began to arrive\r\nfrom India, a council order announced that the militia would _not_ be\r\ncalled out in 1857; two months afterwards, in reply to a question in the\r\nHouse of Commons, Viscount Palmerston would not admit that circumstances\r\nwere so serious as to necessitate a change in this arrangement; he\r\nthought that recruiting would be cheaper than the militia, as a means of\r\nkeeping up the strength of the army. In August, however, the ministers\r\nobtained an act of parliament empowering them to embody some of the\r\nmilitia during the recess, if the state of public affairs should render\r\nsuch a step necessary. A system of active recruiting commenced, and was\r\ncontinued steadily during several months. These recruits were intended,\r\nnot to increase the number of regiments, but to add a second battalion\r\nto many regiments, and to increase the number of men in each battalion;\r\nsome of the regiments were, by this twofold process, raised from 800 or\r\n1000 to 2000 or 2400 men each. Volunteers, also, came forward from\r\nFrance, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and other foreign countries; but these\r\nwere mostly adventurers who sought officers’ commissions in India, and\r\ntheir services were not needed. The government made an attempt to\r\nencourage enlisting by offering commissions in the army to any private\r\ngentlemen who could bring forward a certain number of men each—a project\r\nnot attended with much success. At certain crises, when the news from\r\nIndia was more than usually disastrous, appeals to patriotism shewed\r\nthemselves in the newspapers—‘A Young Englishman;’ ‘Another Young\r\nEnglishman;’ ‘A True Briton;’ ‘One of the Middle Class;’ or ‘A Young\r\nScotsman’—would write to the journals, pour out his patriotism or his\r\nindignation, and shew what he would do if he only had the power. One\r\nproposed that clerks and shopmen out of situations should be embodied\r\ninto a distinct volunteer corps; another said that, as he was a\r\ngentleman, and wished to avenge the foul murder of innocent women and\r\nchildren, he thought that he and such as he ought to be encouraged by\r\ncommissions in the Indian army; another suggested that, if government\r\nwould use them well, many young men would volunteer to serve in India,\r\nto return to their former mode of life when the mutiny was over. Some,\r\nrather in sarcasm than in earnest, suggested that drapers’ shopmen\r\nshould drop the yard-measure, and go to India to fight; leaving to women\r\nthe duty of serving muslins, and laces, and tapes. There was a certain\r\nmeaning in all the suggestions, as expressive of honest indignation at\r\nthe atrocities in India, especially those at Cawnpore; but, in its\r\npractical result, volunteering fell to the ground; and even the militia\r\nwas not much appealed to. Various improvements were made in the\r\ncondition of the common soldier; and recruits for the regular army came\r\nforward with much readiness.\r\n\r\nWe must now mention those who offered their monetary instead of their\r\npersonal services in alleviation of the difficulties experienced in our\r\nIndian empire. Long before the mutinies in India had arrived at their\r\ngreatest height, the question was anxiously debated both in that country\r\nand in England, what would be the worldly condition of the numerous\r\nfamilies driven from their homes and robbed of all they possessed by the\r\nsepoys and marauders at the various stations? Every mail brought home\r\nfresh confirmation of the fact that the number of families thus\r\nimpoverished was rapidly increasing; while on the other hand it was\r\nknown that the East India Company could not reimburse the sufferers\r\nwithout much previous consideration. For, in the first place, it would\r\nhave to be considered whether any distinction ought to be made between\r\nthe two classes of Europeans in India—the civil and military servants of\r\nthe Company, and those who, independent of the Company, had embarked\r\ncapital in enterprises connected with indigo factories, opium farms,\r\nbanks, printing-presses, &c.; and then would come a second inquiry\r\nwhether the personal property only, or the commercial stock in trade\r\nalso, should be considered as under the protection of the government. It\r\nwas felt that immediate suffering ought not to wait for the solution of\r\nthese questions; that when families had been burnt out or driven out of\r\ntheir homes, penniless and almost unclothed, immediate aid was needed\r\nfrom some quarter or other. This was admitted in the Punjaub, where Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence organised a fund for the relief of the necessitous; and it\r\nwas admitted at Calcutta, where Lord and Lady Canning headed a\r\nsubscription for providing shelter, raiment, and food to the hundreds of\r\nterrified fugitives who were constantly flocking to that capital. By the\r\ntime the principal revolts of June were known in England, the last week\r\nof August had arrived; and then commenced one of those wonderful efforts\r\nin which London takes the lead of all the world—the collection of a\r\nlarge sum of money in a short time to ameliorate the sufferings arising\r\nout of some great calamity.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 25th of August that the lord-mayor presided at a meeting\r\nat the Mansion House to establish a fund for the relief of the sufferers\r\nby the Indian mutiny. The sum subscribed at the meeting did not much\r\nexceed a thousand pounds; but the whole merits of the case being set\r\nforth in newspapers, contributions poured in from all quarters, in the\r\nsame noble spirit as had been manifested during the Crimean disasters.\r\nThe high-born and the wealthy contributed large sums; the middle classes\r\nrendered their aid; country committees and town committees organised\r\nlocal subscriptions; large sums, made up of many small elements, were\r\nraised as collections after sermons in the churches and chapels; and\r\nwhen the Queen’s subjects in foreign and colonial regions heard of this\r\nmovement, they sought to shew that they too shared in the common English\r\nfeeling. Thousands swelled to tens of thousands, these to a hundred\r\nthousand, until in the course of a few months the fund rose to three or\r\nfour hundred thousand pounds. In order to give system to the operations,\r\nthirty-five thousand circulars were issued, by the central committee in\r\nLondon, to all the authorities in church and state, to the ambassadors\r\nand ministers at foreign courts, to the governors of British colonies,\r\nand to the consuls at foreign ports.\r\n\r\nThis Mutiny Relief Fund was administered by four committees—General,\r\nFinancial, Relief, and Ladies’ Committees. The General Committee settled\r\nthe principles on which the fund was to be administered, determined the\r\namount and destinations of the remittances to India, and controlled the\r\nproceedings of the subordinate committees. The Financial Committee\r\nsupervised the accounts, the investments of the money, and the\r\narrangement of remittances. The Relief Committee decided on applications\r\nfor relief, on the administration of relief by donation or by loan, and\r\non the application of means for the maintenance and education of\r\nchildren. The Ladies’ Committee took charge of such details as pertained\r\nmore particularly to their own sex. Each of these committees met once a\r\nweek. The first remittance was a sum of £2000 to Calcutta, to relieve\r\nsome of the families who had been driven by the mutineers to seek\r\nshelter in that city. This was followed by frequent large remittances to\r\nthe same place, and to Agra, Delhi, Lucknow, Bombay, and Lahore.\r\nCommittees, formed in Calcutta and Bombay, corresponded with the head\r\ncommittee in London, and joined in carrying out plans for the\r\nexpenditure of the fund. The donations and loans to persons who had\r\narrived in England were small in amount; most of the aid being afforded\r\nto those who had not been able to leave India. The money was put out at\r\ninterest as fast as the amount in hand exceeded the immediate\r\nrequirements. At one time the government made an offer to appoint a\r\nroyal commission for the administration of the fund; but this was\r\ndeclined; and there has been no reason for thinking that the\r\ntransference of authority would have been beneficial. It was soon found\r\nthat there were five classes of sufferers who would greatly need\r\nassistance from this fund—families of civil and military officers whose\r\nbungalows and furniture had been destroyed at the stations; the families\r\nof assistants, clerks, and other subordinate _employés_ at the stations;\r\nEuropean private traders and settlers, many of whom had been utterly\r\nimpoverished; many missionary families and educational establishments;\r\nand the families of a large number of pensioners, overseers, artificers,\r\nindigo-workers, schoolmasters, shopkeepers, hotel-keepers, newspaper\r\nprinters, &c. To apportion the amount of misery among these five classes\r\nwould be impossible; but the past chapters of this work have afforded\r\nexamples, sufficiently sad and numerous, of the mode in which all ranks\r\nof Europeans in India were suddenly plunged into want and desolation. At\r\nAgra, when the fort had been relieved from a long investment or siege by\r\nthe rebels, almost the entire Christian population was not only\r\nhouseless, but the majority were without the most essential articles of\r\nfurniture or clothing; nearly all were living in cellars and vaults. At\r\nmany other stations it was nearly as bad; at Lucknow it was still worse.\r\n\r\nIndia speedily raised thirty thousand pounds on its own account,\r\nirrespective of aid from England; and most of this was expended at\r\nCalcutta in providing as follows: Board and lodging on arrival at\r\nCalcutta for refugees without homes or friends to receive them; clothing\r\nfor refugees; monthly allowances for the support of families who were\r\nnot boarded and lodged out of the fund; loans for purchasing furniture,\r\nclothing, &c.; free grants for similar purposes; passage and diet money\r\non board Ganges steamers; loans to officers and others to pay for the\r\npassage of their families to England; free passage to England for the\r\nwidows and families of officers; and education of the children of\r\nsufferers. These were nearly the same purposes as those to which the\r\nlarger English fund was applied. The East India Company adopted a wholly\r\ndistinct system in recognising the just claims of the officers more\r\nimmediately in its service, and of the widows and children of those who\r\nfell during the mutiny—a system based on the established emoluments and\r\npensions of all in the Company’s service.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the news of the Indian Revolt, when it reached\r\nLondon by successive mails, led to a remarkable and important series of\r\nsuggestions and plans—intended either to strengthen the hands of the\r\nexecutive in dealing with the mutineers, or to succour those who had\r\nbeen plunged into want by the crimes of which those mutineers were the\r\nchief perpetrators.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  At the end of the last chapter a table was given of the number of\r\n  troops, European and native, in all the military divisions of India,\r\n  on the day when the mutiny commenced at Meerut. It will be\r\n  convenient to present here a second tabulation on a wholly different\r\n  basis—giving the _designations_ of the regiments instead of the\r\n  _numbers_ of men, and naming the _stations_ instead of the\r\n  _divisions_ in which they were cantoned or barracked. This will be\r\n  useful for purposes of reference, in relation to the gradual\r\n  annihilation of the Bengal Hindustani army. The former table applied\r\n  to the 10th of May 1857; the present will apply to a date as near\r\n  this as the _East India Register_ will permit—namely, the 6th of\r\n  May; while the royal troops in India will be named according to the\r\n  _Army List_ for the 1st of May—a sufficiently near approximation for\r\n  the present purpose. A few possible sources of error may usefully be\r\n  pointed out. 1. Some or other of the India regiments were at all\r\n  times moving from station to station; and these movements may in a\r\n  few cases render it doubtful whether a particular corps had or had\r\n  not left a particular station on the day named. 2. The station named\r\n  is that of the head-quarters and the bulk of the regiment:\r\n  detachments may have been at other places. 3. The Persian and\r\n  Chinese wars disturbed the distribution of troops belonging to the\r\n  respective presidencies. 4. The disarming and disbanding at\r\n  Barrackpore and Berhampore are not taken into account; for they were\r\n  not known in London at the time of compiling the official list. 5.\r\n  The _Army List_, giving an enumeration of royal regiments in India,\r\n  did not always note correctly the actual stations at a particular\r\n  time. These sources of error, however, will not be considerable in\r\n  amount.\r\n\r\n             REGIMENTS AND STATIONS OF BENGAL ARMY—MAY 1857.\r\n\r\n                   GENERAL ANSON, Commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n                           _European Cavalry._\r\n      6th Carabiniers (Queen’s),                          Meerut.\r\n      9th Lancers (Queen’s),                              Umballa.\r\n\r\n                        _Native Regular Cavalry._\r\n      1st Regiment,                                       Mhow.\r\n       2d Regiment,                                       Cawnpore.\r\n       3d Regiment,                                       Meerut.\r\n      4th Regiment,                                       Umballa.\r\n      5th Regiment,                                       Peshawur.\r\n      6th Regiment,                                       Nowgong.\r\n      7th Regiment,                                       Lucknow.\r\n      8th Regiment,                                       Lahore.\r\n      9th Regiment,                                       Sealkote.\r\n     10th Regiment,                                       Ferozpore.\r\n\r\n                     _Irregular and Local Cavalry._\r\n      1st Bengal Ir.

Every eye was turned towards that\r\nplace. The British felt that there was no security for their power in\r\nIndia till Delhi was retaken; the insurgents knew that they had a\r\nrallying-point for all their disaffected countrymen, so long as the\r\nMogul city was theirs; and hence bands of armed men were attracted\r\nthither by antagonistic motives. Although the real siege did not\r\ncommence till many weary weeks had passed, the plan and preparations for\r\nit must be dated from the very day when the startling news spread over\r\nIndia that Delhi had been seized by rebellious sepoys, under the\r\nauspices of the decrepit, dethroned, debauched representative of the\r\nMoguls.\r\n\r\nIt was, as we have already seen (p. 70), on the morning of Monday the\r\n11th of May, that the 11th and 20th regiments Bengal native infantry,\r\nand the 3d Bengal cavalry, arrived at Delhi after a night-march from\r\nMeerut, where they had mutinied on the preceding evening. At Delhi, we\r\nhave also seen, those mutineers were joined by the 38th, 54th, and 74th\r\nnative infantry. It was on that same 11th of May that evening saw the\r\nsix mutinous regiments masters of the imperial city; and the English\r\nofficers and residents, their wives and children, wanderers through\r\njungles and over streams and rivers. What occurred within Delhi on the\r\nsubsequent days is imperfectly known; the few Europeans who could not or\r\ndid not escape were in hiding; and scanty notices only have ever come to\r\nlight from those or other sources. A Lahore newspaper, three or four\r\nmonths afterwards, gave a narrative prepared by a native, who was within\r\nDelhi from the 21st of May to the 23d of June. Arriving ten days after\r\nthe mutiny, he found the six regiments occupying the Selimgurh and\r\nMohtabagh, but free to roam over the city; where the sepoys and sowars,\r\naided by the rabble of the place, plundered the better houses and shops,\r\nstole horses from those who possessed them, ‘looted’ the passengers who\r\ncrossed the Jumna by the bridge of boats, and fought with each other for\r\nthe property which the fleeing British families had left behind them.\r\nAfter a few days, something like order was restored, by leaders who\r\nassumed command in the name of the King of Delhi. This was all the more\r\nnecessary when new arrivals of insurgent troops took place, from\r\nAllygurh, Minpooree, Agra, Muttra, Hansi, Hissar, Umballa, Jullundur,\r\nNuseerabad, and other places. The mutineers did not, at any time, afford\r\nproof that they were really well commanded; but still there _was_\r\ncommand, and the defence of the city was arranged on a definite plan. As\r\nat Sebastopol, so at Delhi; the longer the besiegers delayed their\r\noperations, the greater became the number of defenders within the place,\r\nand the stronger the defence-works.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in tracing the history of the siege of Delhi,\r\nthat every soldier necessary for forming the siege-army had to be\r\nbrought from distant spots. The cantonment outside the city was wholly\r\nin the hands of the rebels; and not a British soldier remained in arms\r\nin or near the place. Mr Colvin at Agra speedily heard the news, but he\r\nhad no troops to send for the recapture. General Hewett had a British\r\nforce at Meerut—unskilfully handled, as many persons thought and still\r\nthink; and it remained to be seen what arrangements the\r\ncommander-in-chief could make to render this and other forces available\r\nfor the reconquest of the important city.\r\n\r\nMajor-general Sir Henry Barnard was the medium of communication on this\r\noccasion. Being stationed at Umballa, in command of the Sirhind military\r\ndivision, he received telegraphic messages on the 11th of May from\r\nMeerut and Delhi, announcing the disasters at those places. He\r\nimmediately despatched his aid-de-camp to Simla, to point out the urgent\r\nneed for General Anson’s presence on the plains instead of among the\r\nhills. Anson, hearing this news on the 12th, first thought about his\r\ntroops, and then about his own movements. Knowing well the extreme\r\npaucity of European regiments in the Delhi and Agra districts, and in\r\nall the region thence eastward to Calcutta, he saw that any available\r\nforce to recover possession of Delhi must come chiefly from Sirhind and\r\nthe Punjaub. Many regiments were at the time at the hill-stations of\r\nSimla, Dugshai, Kussowlie, Deyrah Dhoon, Subathoo, &c., where they were\r\nposted during a time of peace in a healthy temperate region; but now\r\nthey had to descend from their sanitaria to take part in stern\r\noperations in the plains. The commander-in-chief sent instant orders to\r\ntransfer the Queen’s 75th foot from Kussowlie to Umballa, the 1st and 2d\r\nBengal Europeans from Dugshai to Umballa, the Sirmoor battalion from\r\nDeyrah Dhoon to Meerut, two companies of the Queen’s 8th foot from\r\nJullundur to Phillour, and two companies of the Queen’s 81st foot,\r\ntogether with one company of European artillery, from Lahore to\r\nUmritsir. These orders given, General Anson himself left Simla on the\r\nevening of the 14th, and arrived at Umballa early on the 15th. Before he\r\nstarted, he issued the proclamation already adverted to, announcing to\r\nthe troops of the native army generally that no cartridges would be\r\nbrought into use against the conscientious wishes of the soldiery; and\r\nafter he arrived at Umballa, fearing that his proclamation had not been\r\nstrong enough, he issued another, to the effect that no new cartridges\r\nwhatever should be served out—thereby, as he hoped, putting an end to\r\nall fear concerning objectionable lubricating substances being used; for\r\nhe was not aware how largely hypocrisy was mixed up with sincerity in\r\nthe native scruples on this point.\r\n\r\nAnson and Barnard, when together at Umballa, had to measure well the\r\nforces available to them. The Umballa magazines were nearly empty of\r\nstores and ammunition; the artillery wagons were in the depôt at\r\nPhillour; the medical officers dreaded the heat for troops to move in\r\nsuch a season; and the commissariat was ill supplied with vehicles and\r\nbeasts of burden and draught. The only effectual course was found to be,\r\nthat of bringing small detachments from many different stations; and\r\nthis system was in active progress during the week following Anson’s\r\narrival at Umballa. On the 16th, troops came into that place from\r\nPhillour and Subathoo. On the 17th arrived three European regiments from\r\nthe Hills,[49] which were shortly to be strengthened by artillery from\r\nPhillour. The prospect was not altogether a cheering one, for two of the\r\nregiments at the station were Bengal native troops (the 5th and 60th),\r\non whose fidelity only slight reliance could be placed at such a\r\ncritical period. In order that no time might he lost in forming the\r\nnucleus of a force for Delhi, some of the troops were despatched that\r\nsame night; comprising one wing of a European regiment, a few horse, and\r\ntwo guns. On successive days, other troops took their departure as\r\nrapidly as the necessary arrangements could be made; but Anson was\r\ngreatly embarrassed by the distance between Umballa and the station\r\nwhere the siege-guns were parked; he knew that a besieging army would be\r\nof no use without those essential adjuncts; and it was on that account\r\nthat he was unable to respond to Viscount Canning’s urgent request that\r\nhe would push on rapidly towards Delhi.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of May, Anson sketched a plan of operations, which he\r\ncommunicated to the brigadiers whose services were more immediately at\r\nhis disposal. Leaving Sir Henry Barnard in command at Umballa, he\r\nproposed to head the siege-army himself. It was to consist[50] of three\r\nbrigades—one from Umballa, under Brigadier Halifax; a second from the\r\nsame place, under Brigadier Jones; and a third from Meerut, under\r\nBrigadier Wilson. He proposed to send off the two brigades from Umballa\r\non various days, so that all the corps should reach Kurnaul, fifty miles\r\nnearer to Delhi, by the 30th. Then, by starting on the 1st of June, he\r\nexpected to reach Bhagput on the 5th, with all his Umballa force except\r\nthe siege-train, which might possibly arrive on the 6th. Meanwhile\r\nMajor-general Hewett was to organise a brigade at Meerut, and send it to\r\nBhagput, where it would form a junction with the other two brigades.\r\nGhazeeoodeen Nuggur being a somewhat important post, as a key to the\r\nUpper Doab, it was proposed that Brigadier Wilson should leave a small\r\nforce there—consisting of a part of the Sirmoor battalion, a part of the\r\nRampore horse, and a few guns—while he advanced with the rest of his\r\nbrigade to Bhagput. Lastly, it was supposed that the Meerut brigade, by\r\nstarting on the 1st or 2d of June, could reach the rendezvous on the\r\n5th, and that then all could advance together towards Delhi. Such was\r\nGeneral Anson’s plan—a plan that he was not destined to put in execution\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to trace the course of proceeding in the following\r\nmode—to describe the advance of the Meerut brigade to Bhagput, with its\r\nadventures on the way; then to notice in a similar way the march of the\r\nmain body from Umballa to Bhagput; next the progress of the collected\r\nsiege-army from the last-named town to the crest or ridge bounding Delhi\r\non the north; and, lastly, the commencement of the siege-operations\r\nthemselves—operations lamentably retarded by the want of a sufficient\r\nforce of siege-guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR HENRY BARNARD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMajor-general Hewett, at Meerut, proceeded to organise a brigade in\r\naccordance with the plan laid down by General Anson: retaining at his\r\nhead-quarters a force sufficient to protect Meerut and its\r\nneighbourhood. It was on the 27th of May that this brigade was ready,\r\nand that Colonel Archdall Wilson was placed in command of it—a gallant\r\nofficer afterwards better known as Brigadier or General Wilson. The\r\nbrigade was very small; comprising less than 500 of the 60th Rifles, 200\r\nof the Carabiniers, one battery and a troop of artillery. They started\r\non the evening of the 27th; and after marching during the cooler hours\r\nof the 28th and 29th, encamped on the morning of the 30th at\r\nGhazeeoodeen Nuggur (Ghazee-u-deen Nuggur, Guznee de Nuggur). This was a\r\nsmall town or village on the left bank of the river Hindoun, eighteen\r\nmiles east of Delhi, important as commanding one of the passages over\r\nthat river from Meerut, the passage being by a suspension-bridge.\r\n\r\nOn that same day, the 30th of May, Brigadier Wilson was attacked by the\r\ninsurgents, who had sallied forth from Delhi for this purpose, and who\r\nwere doubtless anxious to prevent a junction of the Meerut force with\r\nthat from Kurnaul. The enemy appeared in force on the opposite side of\r\nthe river, with five guns in position. Wilson at once sent a body of\r\nRifles to command the suspension-bridge; while a few Carabiniers were\r\ndespatched along the river-bank to a place where they were able to ford.\r\nThe insurgents opened fire with their five heavy guns; whereupon the\r\nbrigadier sent off to the attacked points all his force except\r\nsufficient to guard his camp; and then the contest became very brisk.\r\nThe Rifles, under Colonel Jones, were ordered to charge the enemy’s\r\nguns; they rushed forward, disregarding grape and canister shot, and\r\nadvanced towards the guns. When they saw a shell about to burst, they\r\nthrew themselves down on their faces to avoid the danger, then jumped\r\nup, and off again. They reached the guns, drove away the gunners, and\r\neffected a capture. The enemy, beaten away from the defences of the\r\nbridge, retreated to a large walled village, where they had the courage\r\nto stand a hand-to-hand contest for a time—a struggle which no native\r\ntroops could long continue against the British Rifles. As evening came\r\non, the enemy fled with speed to Delhi, leaving behind them five guns,\r\nammunition, and stores. Colonel Coustance followed them some distance\r\nwith the Carabiniers; but it was not deemed prudent to continue the\r\npursuit after nightfall. In this smart affair 11 were killed, 21 wounded\r\nor missing. Captain Andrews, with four of his riflemen, while taking\r\npossession of two heavy pieces of ordnance on the causeway, close to the\r\ntoll-house of the bridge, were blown up by the explosion of an\r\nammunition-wagon, fired by one of the sepoy gunners.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers did not allow Brigadier Wilson to remain many hours quiet.\r\nHe saw parties of their horse reconnoitring his position all the morning\r\nof the 31st; and he kept, therefore, well on the alert. At one o’clock\r\nthe enemy, supposed to be five thousand in number, took up a position a\r\nmile in length, on a ridge on the opposite side of the Hindoun, and\r\nabout a mile distant from Wilson’s advanced picket. Horse-artillery and\r\ntwo 18-pounders were at once sent forward to reply to this fire, with a\r\nparty of Carabiniers to support; while another party, of Rifles,\r\nCarabiniers, and guns, went to support the picket at the bridge. For\r\nnearly two hours the contest was one of artillery alone, the British\r\nguns being repeatedly and vainly charged by the enemy’s cavalry; the\r\nenemy’s fire then slackening, and the Rifles having cleared a village on\r\nthe left of the toll-bar, the brigadier ordered a general advance. The\r\nresult was as on the preceding day; the mutineers were driven back. The\r\nBritish all regretted they could not follow, and cut up the enemy in the\r\nretreat; but the brigadier, seeing that many of his poor fellows fell\r\nsun-stricken, was forced to call them back into camp when the action was\r\nover. This victory was not so complete as that on the preceding day; for\r\nthe mutineers were able to carry off all their guns, two heavy and five\r\nlight. The killed and wounded on the side of the English were 24 in\r\nnumber, of whom 10 were stricken down by the heat of the sun—a cause of\r\ndeath that shews how terrible must have been the ordeal passed through\r\nby all on such a day. Among the officers, Lieutenant Perkins was killed,\r\nand Captain Johnson and Ensign Napier wounded.\r\n\r\nAfter the struggle of the 31st of May, the enemy did not molest Wilson\r\nin his temporary camp at Ghazeeoodeen Nuggur. He provided for his\r\nwounded, refitted his brigade, and waited for reinforcements. On the\r\nmorning of the 3d of June he was joined by another hundred of the 60th\r\nRifles from Meerut, and by a Goorkha regiment, the Sirmoor battalion,\r\nfrom Deyrah Dhoon; and then lost no time in marching to the rendezvous.\r\nThe route taken was very circuitous, hilly, and rugged; and the brigade\r\ndid not reach the rendezvous head-quarters at Bhagput till the morning\r\nof the 6th.\r\n\r\nWe have now to trace the fortunes of the Umballa force. It was on the\r\n23d of May, as has been shewn, that General Anson put forth the scheme\r\nfor an advance towards Delhi, in which the brigade from Meerut was to\r\ntake part. He left Umballa on the 24th, and reached Kurnaul on the 25th.\r\nAll the proposed regiments and detachments from Umballa had by that time\r\ncome in to Kurnaul except two troops of horse-artillery; but as the\r\nsiege-train was far in arrear, Anson telegraphed to Calcutta that he\r\nwould not be in a position to advance from Kurnaul towards Delhi until\r\nthe 31st of the month. On the 26th, the commander-in-chief’s plans were\r\nended by the ending of his life; an attack of cholera carried him off in\r\na few hours. He hastily summoned Sir Henry Barnard from Umballa; and his\r\nlast words were to place the Delhi force under the command of that\r\nofficer. At that time news and orders travelled slowly between Calcutta\r\nand the northwest; for dâks were interrupted and telegraph wires cut;\r\nand it was therefore necessary that the command should at once be given\r\nto some one, without waiting for sanction from the governor-general.\r\nViscount Canning heard the news on the 3d of June, and immediately\r\nconfirmed the appointment of Sir Henry to the command of the siege-army;\r\nbut that confirmation was not known to the besiegers till long\r\nafterwards. Major-general Reed, by the death of Anson, became\r\nprovisional commander-in-chief; and he left Rawul Pindee on the 28th of\r\nMay to join the head-quarters of the siege-army, but without superseding\r\nBarnard. It was a terrible time for all these generals: Anson and\r\nHalifax had both succumbed to cholera; Reed was so thoroughly broken\r\ndown by illness that he could not command in person; and Barnard was\r\nsummoned from a sick-bed by the dying commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barnard did not feel justified in advancing from Kurnaul until\r\nheavier guns than those he possessed could arrive from the Punjaub. On\r\nthe 31st, a 9-pounder battery—those already at hand being only\r\n6-pounders—came into camp; and the march from Kurnaul to Paniput\r\ncommenced on that evening. Sir Henry expected to have met Brigadier\r\nWilson at Raee, where there was a bridge of boats over the Jumna; but\r\nthrough some misconstruction or countermanding of orders, Wilson had\r\ntaken a much more circuitous route by Ghazeeoodeen Nuggur, and could not\r\njoin the Umballa brigade at the place or on the day expected. Barnard,\r\nafter a brief sojourn and a slight change of plan, sent out elephants to\r\naid in bringing forward the Meerut brigade, and advanced with the\r\ngreater portion of his own force to Alipore (or Aleepore), where he\r\narrived on the morning of the 5th of June. The chief artillery force\r\nbeing with the Meerut brigade, Sir Henry waited for Wilson, who effected\r\na junction with him on the 6th; and on the 7th, the united forces were\r\nreorganised, at a point so near Delhi that the troops looked forward\r\neagerly to a speedy encounter with the enemy.\r\n\r\nMany of the soldiers who thus assembled at a place distant only a few\r\nmiles from the famous city, which they all hoped soon to retake from the\r\nhands of the enemy, had marched great distances. Among the number was\r\nthe corps of Guides, whose march was one of those determined exploits of\r\nwhich soldiers always feel proud, and to which they point as proof that\r\nthey shrink not from fatigue and heat when a post of duty is assigned to\r\nthem. This remarkable corps was raised on the conclusion of the Sutlej\r\ncampaign, to act either as regular troops or as guides and spies,\r\naccording as the exigencies of the service might require. The men were\r\nchosen for their sagacity and intelligence, as well as for their courage\r\nand hardihood. They were inhabitants of the Punjaub, but belonged to no\r\none selected race or creed; for among them were to be found\r\nmountaineers, borderers, men of the plains, and half-wild warriors.\r\nAmong them nearly all the dialects of Northern India were more or less\r\nknown; and they were as familiar with hill-fighting as with service on\r\nthe plains. They were often employed as intelligencers, and in\r\nreconnoitring an enemy’s position. They were the best of all troops to\r\nact against the robber hill-tribes, with whom India is so greatly\r\ninfested. Among the many useful pieces of Indian service effected by Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence, was the suggestion of this corps; and Lord Hardinge,\r\nwhen commander-in-chief, acted on it in 1846. The corps was at first\r\nlimited to one troop of cavalry and two companies of artillery, less\r\nthan three hundred men in all; but the Marquis of Dalhousie afterwards\r\nraised it to three troops and six companies, about eight hundred and\r\nfifty men, commanded by four European officers and a surgeon. The men\r\nwere dressed in a plain serviceable drab uniform. Their pay was eight\r\nrupees per month for a foot-soldier, and twenty-four for a trooper.\r\nThese, then, were the Guides of whom English newspaper-readers heard so\r\nmuch but knew so little. They were stationed at a remote post in the\r\nPunjaub, not far from the Afghan frontier, when orders reached them to\r\nmarch to Delhi, a distance of no less than 750 miles. They set off,\r\nhorse and foot together, and accomplished the distance in twenty-eight\r\ndays—a really great achievement in the heat of an Indian summer; they\r\nsuffered much, of course; but all took pride in their work, and obtained\r\nhigh praise from the commander-in-chief. One of the English officers\r\nafterwards declared that he had never before experienced the necessity\r\nof ‘roughing’ it as on this occasion. Captain Daly commanded the whole\r\ncorps, while Captain Quintin Battye had special control of that portion\r\nof it which consisted of troopers.\r\n\r\nThe Guides, as has just been shewn, were an exceptional corps, raised\r\namong the natives for a peculiar service. But the siege-army contained\r\ngallant regiments of ordinary troops, whose marching was little less\r\nsevere. One of these was the 1st Bengal European Fusiliers; a British\r\nregiment wholly belonging to the Company, and one which in old times was\r\nknown as Lord Lake’s ‘dear old dirty shirts.’ On the 13th of May it was\r\nat Dugshai, a sanatarium and hill-station not far from Simla. Major\r\nJacob rode in hastily from Simla, announced that Meerut and Delhi were\r\nin revolt, and brought an order for the regiment to march down to\r\nUmballa forthwith, to await further orders. At five o’clock that same\r\nday the men marched forth, with sixty rounds in pouch, and food in\r\nhaversack. After a twenty-four miles’ walk they refreshed on the ground,\r\nsupping and sleeping as best they could. At an hour after midnight they\r\nrenewed their march, taking advantage—as troops in India are wont to\r\ndo—of the cool hours of the night; they marched till six or seven, and\r\nthen rested during the heat of the day at Chundeegurh. From five till\r\nten in the evening they again advanced, and then had supper and three\r\nhours’ rest at Mobarrackpore. Then, after a seven hours’ march during\r\nthe night of the 14th-15th, they reached Umballa—having accomplished\r\nsixty miles in thirty-eight hours. Here they were compelled to remain\r\nsome days until the arrangements of the general in other directions were\r\ncompleted; and during this detention many of their number were carried\r\noff by cholera. At length four companies were sent on towards Kurnaul on\r\nthe 17th, under Captain Dennis; while the other companies did not start\r\ntill the 21st. The two wings of the regiments afterwards effected a\r\njunction, and marched by Paniput, Soomalka, and Sursowlie, to Raee,\r\nwhere they arrived on the 31st of May. Under a scorching sun every day,\r\nthe troops were well-nigh beaten down; but the hope of ‘thrashing the\r\nrebels at Delhi’ cheered them on. One officer speaks of the glee with\r\nwhich he and his companions came in sight of a field of onions, ‘all\r\ngreen above and white below,’ and of the delightful relish they enjoyed\r\nduring a temporary rest. The regiment, after remaining at Raee till the\r\nmorning of the 5th of June, was then joined by its commandant, Colonel\r\nWelchman. Forming now part of Brigadier Showers’ brigade, the 1st\r\nEuropeans marched to Alipore, where its fortunes were mixed up with\r\nthose of the other troops in the besieging army.\r\n\r\nMany at Calcutta wondered why Barnard did not make a more rapid advance\r\nfrom Paniput and Raee to Alipore; and many at Raee wondered why Wilson\r\ndid not come in more quickly from Ghazeeoodeen Nuggur. The brigadier was\r\nsaid to have had his plans somewhat changed by suggestions from one of\r\nthe Greatheds (Mr H. H. Greathed was agent, and Lieutenant W. H.\r\nGreathed, aid-de-camp, for the lieutenant-governor of the Northwest\r\nProvinces in the camp of the siege-army); while Sir Henry was anxious\r\nboth to secure Wilson’s co-operation as soon as he started, and to\r\npreserve the health of his men during the trying season of heat. It is\r\ngreatly to the credit of him and all the officers, that the various\r\nregiments, notwithstanding their long marches and fierce exposure to\r\nheat, reached Delhi in admirable health—leaving cholera many miles\r\nbehind them. Having been joined by a siege-train on the 6th of June, and\r\nby Brigadier Wilson’s forces on the 7th, Barnard began at once to\r\norganise his plans for an advance. The reinforcements brought by Wilson\r\nwere very miscellaneous;[51] but they had fought well on the banks of\r\nthe Hindoun, and were an indispensable aid to the general. Major-general\r\nReed arrived from Rawul Pindee at midnight, not to take the command from\r\nBarnard, but to sanction the line of proceedings as temporary\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nIt was at one o’clock on the morning of the 8th of June that the\r\nsiege-army set out from Alipore, to march the ten miles which separate\r\nthat village from Delhi. Some of the reinforcements, such as the Guides,\r\nhad not yet arrived; but the troops which formed the army of march on\r\nthis morning, according to Sir Henry’s official dispatch, were as noted\r\nbelow.[52] They advanced to a village, the name of which is variously\r\nspelt in the dispatches, letters, and maps as Badulla Serai,\r\nBardul-ki-Serai, Badulee-ke-Serai, Bardeleeke Serai, Budleeka Suraee,\r\n&c., about four miles from Delhi. Here the fighting began; here the\r\nbesiegers came in contact with the enemy who had been so long sought.\r\nWhen within a short distance of the village, the sepoy watch-fires were\r\nseen (for day had scarcely yet broken). Suddenly a report was heard, and\r\na shot and shell came roaring down the road to the advancing British\r\nforce; and then it became necessary to plan a mode of dealing with the\r\nenemy, who were several thousands in number, in a strongly intrenched\r\nposition, with artillery well served. Sir Henry Barnard intrusted\r\nBrigadiers Showers, Graves, and Grant with distinct duties—the first to\r\nadvance with his brigade on the right of the main trunk-road; the second\r\nto take the left of the same road; and the third to cross the canal,\r\nadvance quietly, and recross in the rear of the enemy’s position at such\r\na time as a signal should direct them to effect a surprise. The guns\r\nwere placed in and on both sides of the road. When the hostile forces\r\nmet, the enemy opened a severe fire—a fire so severe, indeed, that the\r\ngeneral resolved to stop it by capturing the battery itself. This was\r\neffected in a gallant manner by the 75th foot and the 1st Europeans; it\r\nwas perilous work, for the troops had to pass over open ground, with\r\nvery little shelter or cover. Several officers were struck down at this\r\npoint; but the most serious loss was produced by a cannon-shot which\r\nkilled Colonel Chester, adjutant-general of the army. The battery was\r\ncharged so determinedly that the artillerymen were forced to flee,\r\nleaving their guns behind them; while the advance of the other two\r\nbrigades compelled them to a general flight. Colonel Welchman, of the\r\n1st Fusiliers, in his eagerness galloped after three of the mutineers\r\nand cut one of them down; but the act would have cost him his own life,\r\nhad not a private of his regiment come opportunely to his aid.\r\n\r\nA question now arose, whether to halt for a while, or push on towards\r\nDelhi. It was between five and six o’clock on a summer morning; and\r\nBarnard decided that it would be advisable not to allow the enemy time\r\nto reassemble in or near the village. The men were much exhausted; but\r\nafter a hasty taste of rum and biscuit, they resumed their march.\r\nAdvancing in two columns, Brigadiers Wilson and Showers fought their way\r\nalong the main trunk-road; while Barnard and Graves turned off at\r\nAzadpore by the road which led through the cantonment of Delhi—a\r\ncantonment lately in the hands of the British authorities, but now\r\ndeserted. This advance was a continuous fight the whole way: the rebels\r\ndisputing the passage inch by inch. It then became perceptible that a\r\nrocky ridge which bounds Delhi on the north was bristling with bayonets\r\nand cannon, and that the conquest of this ridge would be a necessary\r\npreliminary to an approach to Delhi. Barnard determined on a rapid\r\nflank-movement to turn the right of the enemy’s position. With a force\r\nconsisting of the 60th Rifles under Colonel Jones, the 2d Europeans\r\nunder Captain Boyd, and a troop of horse-artillery under Captain Money,\r\nSir Henry rapidly advanced, ascended the ridge, took the enemy in flank,\r\ncompelled them to flee, and swept the whole length of the ridge—the\r\nenemy abandoning twenty-six guns, with ammunition and camp-equipage. The\r\nRifles rendered signal service in this movement; taking advantage of\r\nevery slight cover, advancing closer to the enemy’s guns than other\r\ninfantry could safely do, and picking off the gunners. Brigadier Wilson\r\nand his companions were enabled to advance by the main road; and he and\r\nBarnard met on the ridge. From that hour the besieging army took up its\r\nposition before Delhi—never to leave it till months of hard fighting had\r\nmade them masters of the place. During the struggle on the ridge, two\r\nincidents greatly exasperated the troops: one was the discovery that a\r\ncaptured cart, which they supposed to contain ammunition, was full of\r\nthe mangled limbs and trunks of their murdered fellow-Christians; the\r\nother was that two or three Europeans were found fighting for and with\r\nthe rebels—probably soldiers of fortune, ready to sell their services to\r\nthe highest bidders. Every European—and it was supposed that Delhi\r\ncontained others of the kind—so caught was sure to be cut to pieces by\r\nthe enraged soldiery, with a far more deadly hatred than sepoys\r\nthemselves could have inspired. This day’s work was not effected without\r\nserious loss. Colonel Chester, we have said, was killed; as were\r\nCaptains Delamain and Russell, and Lieutenant Harrison. The wounded\r\ncomprised Colonel Herbert; Captains Dawson and Greville; Lieutenants\r\nLight, Hunter, Davidson, Hare, Fitzgerald, Barter, Rivers, and Ellis;\r\nand Ensign Pym. In all, officers and privates, there were 51 killed and\r\n133 wounded. Nearly 50 horses were either killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in the afternoon of the 8th of June, were the British posted\r\nbefore Delhi. It will be necessary to have a clear notion of the\r\nrelative positions of the besiegers and the besieged, to understand the\r\nnarrative which is to follow. Of Delhi itself an account is given\r\nelsewhere, with a brief notice of the defence-works;[53] but the gates\r\nand bastions must here be enumerated somewhat more minutely, as the plan\r\nof the siege mainly depended on them. A small branch or nullah of the\r\nJumna is separated from the main stream by a sand-bank which forms an\r\nisland; the junction or rejoining of the two takes place where the Jumna\r\nis crossed by a bridge of boats, and where the old fort called the\r\nSelimgurh was built. Beginning at this point, we trace the circuit of\r\nthe wall and its fortifications. From the Selimgurh the wall borders—or\r\nrather bordered (for it will be well to speak in the past tense)—the\r\nnullah for about three-quarters of a mile, in a northwest direction,\r\nmarked by the Calcutta Gate, a martello tower, the Kaila Gate, the\r\nNuseergunje Bastion, and the Moree or Moira Bastion. The wall then\r\nturned sharply to the west, or slightly southwest; and during a length\r\nof about three-quarters of a mile presented the Moree Bastion just\r\nnamed, the Cashmere Gate, the Moree Gate, and the Shah Bastion. To this\r\nsucceeded a portion about a mile in length, running nearly north and\r\nsouth, and marked by the Cabool Gate, a martello tower, Burn Bastion,\r\nthe Lahore Gate, and the Gurstin Bastion. Then, an irregular polygonal\r\nline of two miles in length carried the wall round to the bank of the\r\nJumna, by a course bending more and more to the east; here were\r\npresented the Turushkana Gate, a martello tower, the Ajmeer Gate, the\r\nAkbar Bastion, another martello tower, the Ochterlony Bastion, the\r\nTurcoman Gate, a third and a fourth martello towers, and the Delhi Gate.\r\nLastly, along the bank of the river for a mile and a half, and separated\r\nfrom the water at most times by a narrow sandy strip, was a continuation\r\nof the wall, broken by the Wellesley and Nawab Bastions, the Duryagunje\r\nGate, a martello tower, the Rajghat Gate, the wall of the imperial\r\npalace, and the defence-wall entirely surrounding the Selimgurh. Such\r\nwere the numerous gates, bastions, and towers at that period; many parts\r\nof the wall and bastions were formed of masonry twelve feet thick, and\r\nthe whole had been further strengthened by the rebels during four weeks\r\nof occupation. Outside the defences was a broad ditch twenty feet deep\r\nfrom the ground, or thirty-five from the top of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe position taken up by the besiegers may be thus briefly described.\r\nThe camp was pitched on the former parade-ground of the deserted\r\nencampment, at a spot about a mile and a half from the northern wall of\r\nthe city, with a rocky ridge acting as a screen between it and the city.\r\nThis ridge was commanded by the rebels until the afternoon of the 8th;\r\nbut from that time it was in the hands of the besiegers. The British\r\nline on this ridge rested on the left on an old tower used as a\r\nsignal-post, often called the Flagstaff Tower; at its centre, upon an\r\nold mosque; and at its right, upon a house with enclosures strongly\r\nplaced at the point where the ridge begins to slope down towards the\r\nplain. This house, formerly occupied by a Mahratta chief named Hindoo\r\nRao, was generally known as Hindoo Rao’s house. Owing to the ridge being\r\nvery oblique in reference to the position of the city, the right of the\r\nline was of necessity thrown much forward, and hence Hindoo Rao’s house\r\nbecame the most important post in the line. Near this house, owing to\r\nits commanding position, the British planted three batteries; and to\r\nprotect these batteries, Rifles, Guides, and Sirmoor Goorkhas were\r\nposted within convenient distance. Luckily for the British, Hindoo Rao’s\r\nhouse was ‘pucka-built,’ that is, a substantial brick structure, and\r\nbore up well against the storm of shot aimed at it by the rebels.\r\n\r\nWhen the British had effected a permanent lodgment on the ridge, with\r\nthe camp pitched in the old cantonment behind the ridge as a screen, the\r\ntime had arrived when the detailed plan for the siege was to be\r\ndetermined, if it had not been determined already. Some military critics\r\naverred that Sir Henry Barnard, only acquainted in a slight degree with\r\nthat part of India, displayed indecision, giving and countermanding\r\norders repeatedly, and leaving his subordinates in doubt concerning the\r\nreal plan of the siege. Others contended that the sudden assumption of\r\ncommand on the death of General Anson, the small number of troops, and\r\nthe want of large siege-guns, were enough to render necessary great\r\ncaution in the mode of procedure. The truth appears to be, that the\r\nrebels were found stronger in Delhi, than was suspected before the\r\nsiege-army approached close to the place; moreover, they had contested\r\nthe advance from Alipore more obstinately than had been expected—shewing\r\nthat, though not equal to British soldiers, it would not be safe to\r\ndespise their prowess. The plan of attack would obviously depend upon\r\nthe real or supposed defensive measures of the besieged. If the rebels\r\nrisked a battle outside the walls, they might very likely be defeated\r\nand followed into the city and palace; but then would come a disastrous\r\nstreet-fighting against enemies screened behind loopholed walls, and\r\nfiring upon besiegers much less numerous than themselves. Or the\r\nhalf-crumbled walls might easily be scaled by active troops; but as\r\nthese troops would be a mere handful against large numbers, their\r\nsuccess would be very doubtful. A third plan, suggested by some among\r\nthe many advisers of that period, was to make an attack by water, or on\r\nthe river-side. The Jumna is at certain times so shallow at Delhi as to\r\nbe almost fordable, and leaving a strip of sand on which batteries might\r\nbe planted; these batteries might breach the river-wall of the palace,\r\nand so disturb the garrison as to permit a large body of the besiegers\r\nto enter under cover of the firing; but a rise in the river would\r\nfatally affect this enterprise. A fourth plan suggested was to attack\r\nnear the Cashmere Gate, on the north side of the city; the siege-army\r\nwould in this case be protected on its left flank by the river, and\r\nmight employ all its force in breaching the wall between the gate and\r\nthe river; the guns would render the mainguard untenable; when the\r\nassault was made, it would be on a part where there is much vacant\r\nground in the interior; and the besieging troops would have a better\r\nchance than if at once entangled among the intricacies of loopholed\r\nhouses. Any project for starving out the garrison, if it ever entered\r\nthe mind of any soldier, was soon abandoned; the boundary was too\r\nextensive, the gates too many, and the besiegers too few, to effect\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hindoo Rao’s House—Battery in front.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the early days after the arrival of the British, indications\r\nappeared of an intention to blow open the Cashmere Gate, and effect a\r\nforcible entry into the city at once; but these indications soon ceased;\r\nand the besiegers found themselves compelled rather to resist attacks\r\nthan to make them; for the enemy, strong in numbers, made repeated\r\nsorties from the various gates of the city, and endeavoured to dislodge\r\nthe British. One such sortie was made about noon on the 9th, within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the arrival of the besiegers; the enemy were,\r\nhowever, easily repulsed, and driven in again. The corps of Guides met\r\nwith a loss on this day which occasioned much regret. Among those who\r\naccompanied the hardy men all the way from the Afghan frontier was\r\nCaptain Quintin Battye, a young officer much beloved as commandant of\r\nthe cavalry portion of the corps. They arrived on the 8th; and on the\r\nnext day poor Battye was shot through the body; he lived twenty-four\r\nhours in great agony, and then sank. The Guides had a large share in\r\nthis day’s work; many of them fell, in dislodging the enemy from a rocky\r\nposition which they temporarily occupied. On the 10th a little\r\nskirmishing took place, but not so serious as on the preceding day; it\r\nwas found, however, that the white shirts of the men were a little too\r\nconspicuous; and they underwent an extemporaneous process of dyeing to\r\ndeepen the colour. On the 12th, early in the morning, the enemy made a\r\nsudden attack on both flanks; but all points were speedily defended.\r\nThey were first driven back on the left; then, after a repulse on the\r\nright, they advanced a second time under the cover of thickly wooded\r\ngardens near the Subzee Mundee—a suburb of Delhi about a mile and a\r\nquarter northwest of the Cabool Gate. Major Jacob was then sent against\r\nthem with some of the Bengal Europeans; he beat them back till they got\r\nbeyond the suburb, and then returned to the camp. This morning’s affair\r\nwas supposed to have cost the enemy 250 men; the British loss was very\r\nsmall. On this day, the British had the mortification of seeing two\r\nregiments of Rohilcund mutineers, the 60th native infantry and the 4th\r\nnative cavalry, enter Delhi with bands playing and colours flying; the\r\ndefiant manner was quite as serious an affair as the augmentation of the\r\nstrength of the garrison. On the 13th a large enclosure in advance of\r\nthe British left, known as Metcalfe House, was occupied by them, and the\r\nerection of a battery of heavy guns and mortars commenced.\r\n\r\nNot a day passed without some such struggles as have just been adverted\r\nto. The besieging of the city had not really commenced, for the British\r\nhad not yet a force of artillery sufficient for that purpose; indeed,\r\nthey were now the besieged rather than the besiegers; for the enemy came\r\nout of the city—horse, foot, and guns—and attempted to effect a surprise\r\non one part or other of the position on the ridge. Against the battery\r\nat Metcalfe House a sortie was made on the 15th, and another was made on\r\nthe same day at the right of the line. On the 17th an exciting encounter\r\ntook place. A shot from the city struck the corner of Hindoo Rao’s\r\nhouse, and glancing off, killed Lieutenant Wheatley of the Goorkhas. It\r\nwas then suspected that the enemy, besides their attacks on this house\r\nin front, were throwing up a battery outside the western gates of the\r\ntown, at a large building known as the Eedghah, formerly used as a\r\nserai. Thereupon a force was immediately organised, consisting of\r\nhorse-artillery, cavalry, Goorkhas, and Rifles, to drive them away from\r\nthat position. They passed through the Subzee Mundee to the Eedghah,\r\ndrove out the enemy, and captured the only gun which had yet been placed\r\nthere. One of the officers on this duty had a finger shot off, a bullet\r\nthrough the wrist, another through the cheek, and another which broke\r\nthe collar-bone; yet he recovered, to fight again.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of June it came to the knowledge of Brigadier Grant that the\r\nenemy intended to attack the camp in the rear; and as the safety of the\r\ncamp had been placed under his keeping, he made instant preparations to\r\nfrustrate the insurgents. These troops are believed to have been\r\naugmentations of the insurgent forces, consisting of the 15th and 30th\r\nnative regiments from Nuseerabad. The brigadier advanced with six guns\r\nand a squadron of lancers to reconnoitre, and found the enemy in\r\nposition half a mile in rear of the Ochterlony Gardens, northwest of the\r\ncamp. Troops quickly arrived, and a rapid exchange of fire began, the\r\nenemy being strong in artillery as well as in infantry. Just as the dusk\r\nof the evening came on, the enemy, by a series of skilful and vigorous\r\nattacks, aided by well-served artillery, very nearly succeeded in\r\nturning the flank of the British, and in capturing two guns; but both\r\nthese disasters were frustrated. The dusk deepened into darkness; but\r\nthe brigadier felt that it would not do to allow the enemy to occupy\r\nthat position during the night. A charge was made with great impetuosity\r\nby horse and foot, with so much success, that the enemy were driven back\r\nquite into the town. The brigadier had to regret the loss of Colonel\r\nYule of the 9th Lancers, who was knocked off his horse, and not found\r\nagain by his men till next morning; when they were shocked to see him\r\ndead and mangled, with both thighs broken, a ball through the head just\r\nover the eyes, his throat cut, and his hands much gashed. He had been on\r\nleave of absence in Cashmere, but directly he heard of the work to be\r\ndone, travelled night and day till he reached his regiment just before\r\nits arrival at Delhi. Lieutenant Alexander was also among the killed.\r\nCaptain Daly of the Guides, and six other officers, were wounded. All\r\nthe officers of the Guides, but one, received wounds. Altogether, the\r\nday’s fighting resulted to the British in the loss of 19 killed and 77\r\nwounded; and it was a source of much regret that a few of these fell by\r\nthe hands of their own comrades, while fighting in some confusion as\r\ndarkness approached. No less than sixty horses fell. The brigadier did\r\nnot fail to mention the names of three private soldiers—Thomas Hancock,\r\nJohn Purcell, and Roopur Khan—who behaved with great gallantry at a\r\ncritical moment.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barnard, for very cogent reasons, watched every movement on\r\nthe part of the mutineers who sallied forth from Delhi. On the 22d, he\r\nsaw a body of them come out of the city; and as they were not seen to\r\nreturn at night, he suspected a masked attack. At six in the evening, he\r\nsent out a party of infantry, Guides, and Sappers, to demolish two\r\nbridges which carried the great road across a canal westward of the\r\ncamp, and over which the enemy were in the habit of taking their\r\nartillery and columns when they wished to attack the camp in the rear;\r\nthis was a work of six hours, warmly contested but successfully\r\naccomplished. On the 23d, Sir Henry, expecting a valuable convoy from\r\nthe Punjaub, adopted prompt measures for its protection. He sent out a\r\nstrong escort, which safely brought the convoy into camp. Scarcely had\r\nthis been effected, when his attention was drawn to the right of his\r\nposition, near Hindoo Rao’s house. It was afterwards ascertained that\r\nthe enemy, remembering the 23d of June as the centenary of the battle of\r\nPlassy, had resolved to attempt a great victory over the British on that\r\nday; incited, moreover, by the circumstance that two festivals, one\r\nMussulman and the other Hindoo, happened to occur on that day; and they\r\nemerged from the city in vast force to effect this. They commenced their\r\nattack on the Subzee Mundee side, having a strong position in a village\r\nand among garden-walls. Here a combat was maintained during the whole of\r\nthe day, for the rebels continued their attacks with much pertinacity;\r\nthey lodged themselves in loopholed houses, a serai, and a mosque,\r\nwhence they could not be dislodged till they had wrought much mischief\r\nby musketry. At length, however, they were driven back into the city.\r\nThe value of the precaution taken on the preceding evening, in\r\ndestroying the bridges, was made fully evident; for the rebels were\r\nunable to cross the canal to get to the rear of the camp. The 1st\r\nEuropeans had a desperate contest in the Subzee Mundee, where\r\nstreet-fighting, and firing from windows and house-tops, continued for\r\nmany hours. The British troops suffered terribly from the heat of the\r\nmidsummer sun, to which they were exposed from sunrise to sunset. Many\r\nofficers were brought away sun-struck and powerless. The Guides fought\r\nfor fifteen hours uninterruptedly, with no food, and only a little\r\nwater. At one o’clock, when the enemy were strengthened by large\r\nreinforcements from the city, the Guides found themselves without\r\nammunition, and had to send back to the camp for more; but as great\r\ndelay occurred, they were in imminent peril of annihilation. Fortunately\r\na corps of Sikhs, who had arrived at camp that morning, rushed forward\r\nat a critical moment, and aided the Guides in driving back the enemy.\r\nOne of the incidents of the day has been thus narrated, shewing how\r\nlittle scruple a Goorkha felt when he met a sepoy: ‘In the intense heat,\r\na soldier of the 2d Europeans and a Goorkha sought the shade and\r\nprotection of a house near the Subzee Mundee, a window of which looked\r\ninto a lane where they were seated. Not long had they rested when, from\r\nthe open window, was seen to project the head of a sepoy. Now all\r\nHindoos have what ladies at home call “back-hair,” and this is usually\r\nturned up into a knot; by this the unlucky wretch was at once seized,\r\nand before he could even think of resistance, his head was at a stroke\r\nsevered from his body by the sharp curved knife of the Goorkha!’ This\r\nday’s work was in every way very severe, and shewed the besiegers that\r\nthe rebels were in great strength. Lieutenant Jackson was killed;\r\nColonel Welchman, Captain Jones, and Lieutenant Murray, wounded. The\r\ntotal loss of the day was 39 killed and 121 wounded. The enemy’s loss\r\nwas very much larger; indeed, one of the estimates raised the number up\r\nto a thousand. The loss appears to have somewhat dispirited the\r\nmutineers, for they made very few attacks on the following three days.\r\n\r\nBut although there was a temporary cessation, Sir Henry Barnard, in his\r\nofficial dispatches, shewed that he was much embarrassed by this\r\ncondition of affairs. His forces were few; those of the enemy were very\r\nlarge; and the attacks were rendered more harassing by the uncertainty\r\nof the point on which they would be made, and the impossibility of\r\njudging whether they were about to be made on more points than one. The\r\nonslaughts could only be successfully repulsed by the untiring and\r\nunflinching gallantry of a small body of men. The enemy, instead of\r\nbeing beleaguered within Delhi, were free to emerge from the city and\r\nattack the besiegers’ position. The British did not complain: it was not\r\ntheir wont; but they suffered greatly from this harassing kind of\r\nwarfare. Reinforcements were slowly coming in; in the last week of June\r\nthe Europeans numbered about three thousand; and they were well\r\nsatisfied with the native corps who fought by their side—the Guides, the\r\nGoorkhas, and the Sikhs—all of whom joined very heartily in opposing the\r\nrebel sepoys. The siege-material at this time consisted of five\r\nbatteries, mounting about fifteen guns and mortars, placed on various\r\npoints of the ridge; the bombardment of the city by these guns was not\r\nvery effective, for the distance averaged nearly a mile, and the guns\r\nwere not of large calibre.\r\n\r\nThe interval from the 23d to the 30th of June passed much in the same\r\nway as the two preceding weeks; the British siege-guns wrought very\r\nlittle mischief to the city; while the enemy occasionally sallied forth\r\nto attack either the camp or the works on the ridge. It was often\r\nasserted, and facts seemed to corroborate the statement, that when\r\nmutinous regiments from other places appeared before Delhi, they were\r\nnot afforded reception and shelter until they had earned it by making an\r\nattack on the British position; and thus it happened that the besiegers\r\nwere opposed by a constantly increasing number of the enemy. The\r\ndefenders of the garrison fitted up a large battery on the left of the\r\nCashmere Gate, one at the gate itself, one at the Moree Gate, one at the\r\nAjmeer Gate, and one directly opposite Hindoo Rao’s house; against these\r\nfive batteries, for a long time, the British had only three; so that the\r\nbesieged were stronger than the besiegers in every way. The gunners,\r\ntoo, within Delhi, were fully equal to those of the siege-army in\r\naccuracy of aim; their balls and shells fell near Hindoo Rao’s house so\r\nthickly as to render that post a very perilous one to hold. One shell\r\nentered the gateway, and killed eight or nine officers and men who were\r\nseeking shelter from the mid-day heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The General and his Staff at the Mosque Picket before Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was pretty well ascertained, before June was half over, that Delhi\r\nwas not to be taken by a _coup de main_; and when Sir John Lawrence\r\nbecame aware of that fact, he sent reinforcements down from the Punjaub\r\nas rapidly as they could be collected. Every sepoy regiment that was\r\neither disbanded or disarmed lessened his own danger, for he trusted\r\nwell in his Sikhs, Punjaubees, and Guides; and on that account he was\r\nable to send Europeans and artillery. The reserve and depôt companies of\r\nthe regiments already serving before Delhi were sent down from the hills\r\nto join their companions. A wing of H.M. 61st foot, a portion of the\r\n8th, artillery from Jullundur, and artillerymen from Lahore, followed\r\nthe Guides and Sikhs, and gradually increased the besieging force. Then\r\ncame Punjaub rifles and Punjaub light horse; and there were still a few\r\nHindustani cavalry and horse-artillery in whom their officers placed\r\nsuch unabated confidence that they were permitted to take part in the\r\nsiege-operations, on the ground that there were Europeans enough to\r\noverawe them if they became unruly. These reinforcements of course came\r\nin by degrees: we mention them all in one paragraph, but many weeks\r\nelapsed before they could reach the Delhi camp. Fortunately, supplies\r\nwere plentiful; the country between Delhi and the Sutlej was kept pretty\r\nfree from the enemy; and the villagers were glad to find good customers\r\nfor the commodities they had to sell. It hence arose that, during the\r\nlater days of June, the British were well able to render nugatory all\r\nsallies made by the enemy; they had food and beverages in good store;\r\nand they were free from pestilential diseases. On the other hand, they\r\nsuffered intensely from the heat; and were much dissatisfied at the\r\nsmall progress made towards the conquest of the city. Some expressed\r\ntheir dissatisfaction by adverse criticisms on the general’s tactics;\r\nwhile others admitted that a storming of Delhi would not be prudent\r\nwithout further reinforcements. As to the heat, the troops wrote of it\r\nin all their letters, spoke of it in all their narrations. One officer,\r\nwho had seventy-two hours of outpost-duty on a plain without the\r\nslightest shelter, described his sensation in the daytime as if ‘a hot\r\niron had been going into his head.’ On a certain day, when some\r\nadditional troops arrived at camp after a twenty-two miles’ march, they\r\nhad scarcely lain down to rest when they were ordered out to repel an\r\nattack by the enemy: they went, and gallantly did the work cut out for\r\nthem; but some of them ‘were so exhausted that they sank down on the\r\nroad, _even under fire_, and went off to sleep.’\r\n\r\nJuly arrived. Brigadier Chamberlain had recently joined the camp, and\r\nreinforcements were coming in; but on the other hand the rebels were\r\nincreasing their strength more rapidly than the British. The enemy began\r\nthe month by an attack which tried the prowess of the Guides and\r\nPunjaubees, in a manner that brought great praise to those corps. In the\r\nafternoon of the 1st, Major Reid, who was established with the\r\nhead-quarters of the Sirmoor battalion at Hindoo Rao’s house, observed\r\nthe mutineers turning out in great force from the Ajmeer and Turcoman\r\nGates, and assembling on the open plain outside. Then, looking round on\r\nhis rear right, he saw a large force, which was supposed to have come\r\nout of Delhi on the previous day; comprising thirteen guns and mortars,\r\nbesides cavalry and infantry. The two forces joined about a mile from\r\nthe Eedghah Serai. At sunset 5000 or 6000 infantry advanced, passed\r\nthrough the Pahareepore and Kissengunje suburbs, and approached towards\r\nthe British lines, taking cover of the buildings as they passed. The\r\nextreme right of the line was attacked at the Pagoda picket, which was\r\nheld only by 150 Punjaubees and Guides, under Captain Travers. Major\r\nReid sent him a message to reserve his fire till the enemy approached\r\nnear, in order to husband his resources; while 150 British were being\r\ncollected to send to his aid. Throughout the whole night did this little\r\nband of 300 men resist a large force of infantry and artillery, never\r\nyielding an inch, but defending the few works which had been constructed\r\nin that quarter. At daybreak, the enemy renewed the attacks with further\r\ntroops; but Reid brought a few more of his gallant fellows to repel\r\nthem. Evening, night, morning, noon, all passed in this way; and it was\r\nnot until the contest had continued twenty-two hours that the enemy\r\nfinally retired into the city. There may have been sufficient military\r\nreasons why larger reinforcements were not sent to Major Reid from the\r\ncamp behind the ridge; but let the reasons have been what they may, the\r\nhandful of troops fought in the ratio of hundreds against thousands, and\r\nnever for an instant flinched during this hard day’s work. Major Reid\r\nhad the command of all the pickets and defence-works from Hindoo Rao’s\r\nhouse to the Subzee Mundee. During the first twenty-eight days of the\r\nsiege, his positions were attacked no fewer than twenty-four times; yet\r\nhis singular medley of troops—Rifles, Guides, Sikhs, Punjaubees,\r\nGoorkhas, &c.—fought as if for one common cause, without reference to\r\ndifferences of religion or of nation. The officers, in these and similar\r\nencounters, often passed through an ordeal which renders their survival\r\nalmost inconceivable. An artillery officer, in command of two\r\nhorse-artillery guns, on one occasion was surprised by 120 of the\r\nenemy’s cavalry; he had no support, and could not apply his artillery\r\nbecause his guns were limbered up. He fired four barrels of his revolver\r\nand killed two men; and then knocked a third off his horse by throwing\r\nhis empty pistol at him. Two horsemen thereupon charged full tilt, and\r\nrolled him and his horse over. He got up, and seeing a man on foot\r\ncoming at him to cut him down, rushed at him, got inside his sword, and\r\nhit him full in the face with his fist. At that moment he was cut down\r\nfrom behind; and was only saved from slaughter by a brother-officer, who\r\nrode up, shot one sowar and sabred another, and then carried him off,\r\nbleeding but safe.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d, the Bareilly mutineers—or rather Rohilcund mutineers from\r\nBareilly, Moradabad, and Shahjehanpoor, consisting of five regiments and\r\na battery of artillery—crossed the Jumna and marched into Delhi, with\r\nbands playing and colours flying—a sight sufficiently mortifying to the\r\nbesiegers, who were powerless to prevent it; for any advance in that\r\ndirection would have left the rear of their camp exposed. It afterwards\r\nbecame known that the Bareilly leader was appointed general within\r\nDelhi. The emergence of a large body of the enemy from the city on the\r\nnight of the 3d of July, induced Sir Henry Barnard to send Major Coke to\r\noppose them; with a force made up of portions of the Carabiniers, 9th\r\nLancers, 61st foot, Guides, Punjaubees, horse and foot artillery. Coke\r\nstarted at two in the morning of the 4th. He went to Azadpore, the spot\r\nwhere the great road and the road from the cantonment met. He found that\r\nthe enemy had planned an expedition to seize the British depôt of stores\r\nat Alipore, and to cut off a convoy expected to arrive from the Punjaub.\r\nWhen the major came up with them near the Rohtuk road, he at once\r\nattacked them. During many hours, his troops were confronted with\r\nnumbers greatly exceeding their own; and what with the sun above and\r\nswamps below, the major’s men became thoroughly exhausted by the time\r\nthey returned to camp. The rebels, it was true, were driven back; but\r\nthey got safely with their guns into Delhi; and thus was one more added\r\nto the list of contests in which the besiegers suffered without\r\neffecting anything towards the real object of the siege. The enemy’s\r\ninfantry on this occasion seem to have comprised the Bareilly men. An\r\nofficer of the Engineers, writing concerning this day’s work, said: ‘The\r\nBareilly rascals had the impudence to come round to our rear, and our\r\nonly regret is that one of them ever got back. I was out with the force\r\nsent against them, and cannot say that I felt much pity for the\r\nred-coated villains with “18,” “28,” and “68” on their buttons.’ This\r\nofficer gives expression to the bitter feeling that prevailed generally\r\nin the British camp against the ‘Pandies’[54] or mutinous sepoys, for\r\ntheir treachery, black ingratitude, and cruelty. ‘This is a war in its\r\nvery worst phase, for generosity enters into no one’s mind. Mercy seems\r\nto have fled from us; and if ever there was such a thing as war to the\r\nknife, we certainly have it here. If any one owes these sepoys a grudge,\r\nI think I have some claim to one; but I must say that I cannot bring\r\nmyself to put my sword through a wounded man. I cannot say that I grieve\r\nmuch when I see it done, as it invariably is; but grieve or not as you\r\nplease—he is a clever man who can now keep back a European from driving\r\nhis bayonet through a sepoy, even in the agonies of death.’ These were\r\nthe motives and feelings that rendered the Indian mutiny much more\r\nterrible than an ordinary war. In allusion to sentiments at home, that\r\nthe British soldiers were becoming cruel and blood-thirsty, the same\r\nofficer wrote to a friend: ‘If you hear any such sentiments, by all\r\nmeans ship off their propounder to this country at once. Let him see one\r\nhalf of what _we_ have seen, and compare our brutality with that of the\r\nrebels; then send him home again, and I think you will find him pretty\r\nquiet on the subject for the rest of his life.’\r\n\r\nA new engineer officer, Colonel Baird Smith, arrived to supersede\r\nanother whose operations had not met with approval. The colonel took\r\ninto consideration, with his commander, a plan for blowing in the Moree\r\nand Cashmere Gates, and escalading the Moree and Cashmere Bastions; but\r\nthe plan was abandoned on account of the weakness of the siege-army.\r\n\r\nThe 5th of July was marked by the death of Major-general Sir Henry\r\nBarnard, who had held practical command of the Delhi field-force during\r\nabout five weeks, and had during that time borne much anxiety and\r\nsuffering. He knew that his countrymen at Calcutta as well as in England\r\nwould be continually propounding the question, ‘Why is Delhi not yet\r\ntaken?’ and the varied responsibilities connected with his position\r\nnecessarily gave him much disquietude. During the fierce heat of the 4th\r\nhe was on horseback nearly all day, directing the operations against the\r\nBareilly mutineers. Early on the following morning he sent for Colonel\r\nBaird Smith, and explained his views concerning the mode in which he\r\nthought the siege-operations should be carried on; immediately\r\nafterwards he sent for medical aid; and before many hours had passed, he\r\nwas a corpse. Many of his friends afterwards complained that scant\r\njustice was done to the memory of Sir Henry Barnard; in the halo that\r\nwas destined to surround the name of Wilson, men forgot that it was his\r\npredecessor who had borne all the burden of collecting the siege-force,\r\nof conducting it to the ridge outside Delhi, and of maintaining a\r\ncontinued series of conflicts almost every day for five or six weeks.\r\n\r\nMajor-general Reed, invalid as he was, immediately took the command of\r\nthe force after Barnard’s death; leaving, however, the active direction\r\nmainly to Brigadier Chamberlain. It became every day more and more\r\napparent that, notwithstanding reinforcements, the British artillery was\r\ntoo weak to cope with that of the enemy—whose artillerymen, taught by\r\nthose whom they now opposed, had become very skilful; and whose guns\r\nwere of heavier metal. The besiegers’ batteries were still nearly a mile\r\nfrom the walls, for any nearer position could not be taken up without\r\nterrible loss. To effect a breach with a few 18-pounders at this\r\ndistance was out of the question; and although the field-guns were\r\ntwenty or thirty in number, they were nearly useless for battering down\r\ndefences.\r\n\r\nThe attacks from the enemy continued much as before, but resistance to\r\nthem became complicated by a new difficulty. There were two regiments of\r\nBengal irregular cavalry among the troops in the siege-army, and there\r\nwere a few ‘Poorbeahs’ or Hindustanis in the Punjaub regiments. These\r\nmen were carefully watched from the first; and it became by degrees\r\napparent that they were a danger instead of an aid to the British. Early\r\nin the month a Brahmin subadar in a Punjaubee regiment was detected\r\ninciting his companions-in-arms to murder their officers, and go over to\r\nDelhi, saying it was God’s will the Feringhee ‘raj’ should cease. One of\r\nthe Punjaubees immediately revealed this plot to the officers, and the\r\nincendiary was put to death that same evening. The other Poorbeahs in\r\nthe regiment were at once paid up, and discharged from the\r\ncamp—doubtless swelling the number of insurgents who entered Delhi.\r\nAgain, on the 9th, a party of the enemy’s cavalry, while attempting an\r\nattack on the camp, was joined by some of the 9th irregulars belonging\r\nto the siege-army, and with them tried to tempt the men of the native\r\nhorse-artillery. They were beaten back; and the afternoon of the same\r\nday, the 9th of July, was marked by one of the many struggles in the\r\nSubzee Mundee, all of which ended by the enemy being driven into Delhi.\r\nIf the rebel infantry had fought as well as the artillery, it might have\r\ngone hard with the besiegers, for the sallies were generally made in\r\nvery great force. The rebels counted much on the value of the Subzee\r\nMundee; as a suburb, it had been rendered a mass of ruins by repeated\r\nconflicts, and these ruins precisely suited the sepoy mode of fighting.\r\nThe sepoys found shelter in narrow streets and old houses, and behind\r\ngarden-walls, besides being protected by heavy guns from the city. In\r\nthis kind of skirmishing they were not far inferior to their opponents;\r\nbut in the open field, and especially under a charge with the bayonet,\r\nthey were invariably beaten, let the disparity of numbers be what it\r\nmight. All the officers, in their letters, spoke of the terrible\r\nefficacy of the British bayonet; the sepoys became paralysed with terror\r\nwhen this mode of attack was resorted to. On one occasion they were\r\nconstructing a defensive post at the Eedghah; the British attacked it\r\nand drove in the entrance; there was no exit on the other side, and the\r\ndefenders were all bayoneted in the prison-house which they had thus\r\nunwittingly constructed for themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th, the mutineers poured out in great numbers,\r\nand attacked the batteries at Hindoo Rao’s house, and the picket in the\r\nSubzee Mundee. The troops stationed at those places remained on the\r\ndefensive till three o’clock in the afternoon, struggling against a\r\nforce consisting of many regiments of insurgent infantry, a large body\r\nof cavalry, and several field-pieces. It was indeed a most determined\r\nattack, supported, moreover, by a fire of heavy artillery from the\r\nwalls. Why it was that so many hours elapsed before succour was sent\r\nforth, is not very clear; but the troops who had to bear the brunt of\r\nthis onslaught comprised only detachments of the 60th and 75th foot,\r\nwith the Goorkhas of the Sirmoor battalion and the infantry of the\r\nGuides. A column was formed, however, at the house above named, under\r\nBrigadier Showers, consisting of the 1st Punjaub infantry, the 1st\r\nEuropeans, and six horse-artillery guns. Then commenced a double\r\ncontest; Showers attacking the enemy at the picket-house, and Major Reid\r\nat Hindoo Rao’s house. After a fierce struggle the enemy were driven\r\nback into the city, and narrowly escaped losing some of their guns. It\r\nwas a day’s work that could not be accomplished without a serious loss.\r\nNone of the officers, it is true, were killed in the field; but the list\r\nof wounded was very large, comprising Brigadier Chamberlain (at that\r\ntime adjutant-general of the army), and Lieutenants Roberts, Thompson,\r\nWalker, Geneste, Carnegie, Rivers, Faithful, Daniell, Ross, Tulloch,\r\nChester, Shebbeare, Hawes, Debrett, and Pollock. Tho wounding of so many\r\nsubalterns shews how actively different companies of troops must have\r\nbeen engaged. Altogether, the operations of this day brought down 15 men\r\nkilled and 193 officers and men wounded.\r\n\r\nThe heat was by this time somewhat alleviated by rains, which, however,\r\nbrought sickness and other discomforts with them. Men fell ill after\r\nremaining many hours in damp clothes; and it was found that the fierce\r\nheat was, after all, not so detrimental to health. Many young officers,\r\nit is true, lately arrived from England, and not yet acclimatised, were\r\nsmitten down by sun-stroke, and a few died of apoplexy; but it is\r\nnevertheless true that the army was surprisingly healthy during the hot\r\nweather. One of the Carabiniers, writing in the rainy season, said: ‘The\r\nlast three days have been exceedingly wet; notwithstanding which we are\r\nconstantly in the saddle; no sooner has one alarm subsided than we are\r\nturned out to meet the mutineers in another quarter.’ An officer of\r\nSappers, employed in blowing up a bridge, said: ‘We started about two\r\nP.M., and returned about twelve at night drenched through and thoroughly\r\nmiserable, it having rained the whole time.’\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in the middle of July was peculiar. It seemed to\r\nthe nation at home that the army of Delhi ought to be strong enough to\r\nretake the city, especially when a goodly proportion of the number were\r\nEuropeans. Yet that this was not the case, was the opinion both of Reed\r\nand of Wilson; although many daring spirits in the army longed to breach\r\nthe walls and take the place by storm. Twelve hundred wounded and sick\r\nmen had to be tended; all the others were kept fully employed in\r\nrepelling the sallies of the enemy. Major-general Reed, who ought never\r\nto have assumed the command at all—so broken-down was he in health—gave\r\nin altogether on the 17th, after the wounding of Chamberlain; he named\r\nBrigadier Wilson, who had brought forward the Meerut brigade, as his\r\nsuccessor. The new commander immediately wrote to Sir John Lawrence a\r\nletter (in French, as if distrusting spies), in which he candidly\r\nannounced that it would be dangerous and disastrous to attempt a storm\r\nof the city; that the enemy were in great force, well armed, strong in\r\nposition, and constantly reinforced by accessions of insurgent\r\nregiments; that they daily attacked the British, who could do little\r\nmore than repel the attacks; that his army was gradually diminishing by\r\nthese daily losses; that it would be impossible to take Delhi without at\r\nleast one more European regiment and two more Sikh regiments from the\r\nPunjaub; and that if those additions did not speedily reach him, he\r\nwould be obliged to raise the siege, retreat to Kurnaul, and leave the\r\ncountry all around Delhi to be ravaged by the mutineers. This letter\r\nshewed the gravity with which Brigadier Wilson regarded the state of\r\nmatters at that critical time. Lawrence fully recognised the importance\r\nof the issue, for he redoubled his exertions to send 900 European\r\nFusiliers and 1600 Punjaubees to the camp.\r\n\r\nGeneral Reed’s resignation was twofold. He resigned the provisional\r\ncommand-in-chief of the Bengal army as soon as he was officially\r\ninformed of the assumption of that office by Sir Patrick Grant; and he\r\nresigned the command of the Delhi field-force to Brigadier Wilson,\r\nbecause his health was too far broken to permit him to take part in\r\nactive duties. It was the virtual ending of his part in the wars of the\r\nmutiny; he went to the hills, in search of that health which he could\r\nnever have recovered in the plains.\r\n\r\nAmong the many contests in the second half of the month was one near\r\nLudlow Castle, a name given to the residence of Mr Fraser, the\r\ncommissioner of Delhi, one of those foully murdered on the 11th of May.\r\nThis house was within half a mile of the Cashmere Gate, near the river;\r\nthe enemy were found to be occupying it; but their works were attacked\r\nand destroyed by a force under Brigadier Showers; while Sir T.\r\nMetcalfe’s house, further northward, was taken and strengthened as a\r\ndefensive post by the British.\r\n\r\nMr Colvin, writing from Agra to Havelock on the 22d of July, giving an\r\naccount of such proceedings at Delhi as had come to his knowledge, made\r\nthe following observations on the character which the struggle had\r\nassumed: ‘The spirit by which both Hindoos and Mohammedans act together\r\nat Delhi is very remarkable. You would well understand a gathering of\r\nMohammedan fanatical feeling at that place; but what is locally, I find,\r\nknown by the name of “Pandyism,” is just as strong. Pandies are, among\r\nthe Hindoos, all Brahmins. What absurd, distorted suspicions of our\r\nintentions (which have been so perfectly innocent towards them) may have\r\nbeen first worked upon, it is scarcely possible to say; but the thing\r\nhas now got beyond this, and it is a struggle for mastery, not a\r\nquestion of mistrust or discontent. Mohammedans seem to be actively\r\nmisleading Hindoos for their own purposes. Sir Patrick Grant will not\r\nknow the Bengal army again. The Goorkhas, Sikhs, and Punjaubee\r\nMohammedans have remained quite faithful, and done their duty nobly at\r\nDelhi; the bad spirit is wholly with the Poorbeahs.’ Mr Greathed,\r\nColvin’s commissioner with the siege-army, made every attempt to\r\nascertain, by means of spies and deserters, what were the alleged and\r\nwhat the real motives for the stubborn resistance of the mutineers to\r\nBritish rule. He wrote on this subject: ‘The result of all questionings\r\nof sepoys who have fallen into our hands, regarding the cause of the\r\nmutiny, is the same. They invariably cite the “cartouche” (cartridge) as\r\nthe origin; no other cause of complaint has been alluded to. His majesty\r\nof Delhi has composed a couplet, to the effect that the English, who\r\nboast of having vanquished rods of iron, have been overthrown in\r\nHindostan by a single cartridge. A consciousness of power had grown up\r\nin the army, which could only be exercised by mutiny. The cry of the\r\ncartridges brought the latent spirit of revolt into action.’ Mr Muir of\r\nAgra, commenting on these remarks, said: ‘I fully believe this to be the\r\ncase with the main body of the sepoys. There were ringleaders, no doubt,\r\nwho had selfish views, and possibly held correspondence with the Delhi\r\nfamily, &c.; but they made use of the cartridge as their argument to\r\ngain over the mass of the army to the belief that their caste was\r\nthreatened.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL WILSON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will be unnecessary to trace day by day the struggles outside Delhi.\r\nThey continued as before; but the frequency was somewhat lessened, and\r\nthe danger also, for the defence-works on the ridge had been much\r\nstrengthened. Every bridge over the canal was blown up, except that on\r\nthe main road to Kurnaul and Umballa; and thus the enemy could not\r\neasily attack the camp in the rear. It was not yet really a siege, for\r\nthe British poured very few shot or shell into the city or against the\r\nwalls. It was not an investment; for the British could not send a single\r\nregiment to the southwest, south, or east of the city. It was little\r\nmore than a process of _waiting_ till further reinforcements could\r\narrive.\r\n\r\nAt the close of July, Brigadier Wilson forwarded to the government a\r\nvery exact account of the state of his army, shewing what were his\r\nresources for maintaining the siege on the one hand, and repelling\r\nattacks by the enemy on the other. We present the chief particulars in a\r\nfoot-note, in an altered and more condensed form.[55] It appears that\r\nout of this army of something more than 8000 men, above 1100 were\r\nrendered non-effective by sickness or wounds; that of the whole number\r\nof effectives, just about one-half were Europeans, belonging either to\r\nthe Queen’s or to the Company’s army; and that no European corps, except\r\nperhaps the Lancers, comprised more than a fractional percentage of a\r\nfull regiment. A return sent in about the middle of the month had\r\ncomprised 300 men of the 4th and 17th Bengal irregular cavalry; but the\r\nomission of this element at the end of the month shewed that those\r\ndangerous companions had been got rid of. The corps of Guides and\r\nGoorkhas had in a fortnight diminished from an aggregate number of 923\r\nto 571—so rapidly had those gallant men been brought down by balls,\r\nbullets, and cholera. Ranked among the artillery and engineers were many\r\nhundred syces and bildars, natives who merely aided in certain labouring\r\noperations; and among the Sappers and Miners the Punjaubees were only\r\njust learning their trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Engineer Officers in Battery before Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe casualty list of officers was a very serious one. From the time when\r\nBrigadier Wilson encountered the enemy at Ghazeeoodeen Nuggur at the end\r\nof May, till he made up his report at the end of July, the officers who\r\nwere killed or wounded were 101 in number. Anson, Barnard, Reed,\r\nChamberlain, Halifax, Graves—nearly all the general officers except\r\nWilson and Showers, were either dead or in some way disabled; and these\r\nfrequent changes in command doubtless affected the organisation and\r\nmovements of the army.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Wilson made every attempt, while doing the best he could with\r\nhis own forces, to ascertain the number and components of those\r\npossessed by the enemy. Military commanders always aim at the\r\nacquisition of such knowledge, effected by a species of espionage which,\r\nhowever opposed to general feeling at other times, is deemed quite fair\r\nin war. From the 11th of May, when the troubles began in Delhi, to the\r\nend of July, there arrived in the city mutinous regiments from Meerut,\r\nHansi, Muttra, Lucknow, Nuseerabad, Jullundur, Ferozpore, Bareilly,\r\nJhansi, Gwalior, Neemuch, Allygurh, Agra, Rohtuk, Jhuggur, and\r\nAllahabad. The list given in a note[56] is taken from the official\r\ndispatch, which was itself a record of information obtained from various\r\nnative sources; but after making allowance for the fact that portions\r\nonly of many of the regiments had entered Delhi, and that the numbers\r\nhad been considerably lessened by the thirty or more encounters which\r\nhad taken place outside the walls, the military authorities brought down\r\nthe supposed number to a much lower limit than had before been\r\nnamed—namely, 4000 disciplined cavalry, and 12,000 infantry, besides\r\n3000 undisciplined levies. The rebels retained the formidable defensive\r\nartillery which they found in Delhi, and brought thirty field-guns also\r\nwith them; but these guns were lessened in number one-half by successive\r\nseizures made by the British.\r\n\r\nThe condition and proceedings of the rebels within the city could, of\r\ncourse, be known only imperfectly. The old king was looked up to by all\r\nas the centre of authority, but it is probable that his real power was\r\nsmall. Where regiments had arrived from so many different quarters, we\r\nmay suppose that the apportionment of military command was no easy\r\nmatter; and indeed there was, throughout, little evidence that the rebel\r\nforce had one head, one leader whose plans were obeyed by all. The\r\n_Lahore Chronicle_ some time afterwards printed a narrative by a native,\r\nof a residence in Delhi from the 13th to the 30th of July. Such\r\nnarratives can seldom be relied on; but so far as it went, this\r\nrevelation spoke of great discord among the leaders; great discontent\r\namong the troops because their pay was in arrear; great perplexity on\r\nthe part of the old king because he had not funds enough to pay so large\r\nan army; and great plundering of the citizens by the rude soldiery, who\r\ndeemed themselves masters of the situation. ‘When the sepoys,’ said this\r\nnative, ‘find out a rich house in the city, they accuse the owner after\r\nthe following manner, in order to plunder his property. They take a loaf\r\nof bread and a bottle of grog with them, and make a noise at the door\r\nand break it in pieces, get into the house, take possession of the cash\r\nand valuables, and beat the poor householder, saying: “Where is the\r\nEnglishman you have been keeping in your house?” When he denies having\r\ndone so, they just shew him the bread and the bottle, and say: “How is\r\nit that we happened to find these in your house? We are quite sure there\r\nwas an Englishman accommodated here, whom you quietly sent elsewhere\r\nbefore our arrival.” Soon after, the talk is over, and the poor man is\r\ndisgracefully put into custody, where there is no inquiry made to prove\r\nwhether he is innocent or guilty; he cannot get his release unless he\r\nbribes the general.’ The known attributes of oriental cunning give a\r\nstrong probability to this curious story.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere, for the present, we take leave of the siege of Delhi, and of the\r\nstage at which it had arrived by the end of July. Much has to be\r\nnarrated, in reference to other places, other generals, other\r\noperations, before the final capture of the imperial city will call for\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Bullock-wagon.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Grenadiers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Rifles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  The first troop of horse-artillery was called Leslie’s Troop.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  The troops at Umballa on the 17th comprised:\r\n\r\n        Queen’s 75th foot.                   } Weak: only 1800\r\n        1st Bengal European Fusiliers.       } bayonets in all.\r\n        2d Bengal European Fusiliers.        }\r\n\r\n        5th Bengal native infantry.\r\n        60th Bengal native infantry.\r\n        Queen’s 9th Lancers.\r\n        4th Bengal cavalry.\r\n        Two troops European horse-artillery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n            1st Umballa     { Queen’s 75th foot.\r\n              Brigade.      { 1st Bengal Europeans.\r\n         Brigadier Halifax. { Two squadrons 9th Lancers.\r\n                            { One troop horse artillery.\r\n\r\n                            { 2d Bengal Europeans.\r\n             2d Umballa     { 60th native infantry.\r\n              Brigade.      { Two squadrons 9th Lancers.\r\n          Brigadier Jones.  { One squadron 4th Bengal Lancers.\r\n                            { One troop horse-artillery.\r\n\r\n                            { One wing Queen’s 60th Rifles.\r\n               Meerut       { Two squadrons Carabiniers.\r\n              Brigade.      { One light field-battery.\r\n         Brigadier Wilson.  { One troop horse-artillery.\r\n                            { Native Sappers (if reliable).\r\n                            { 120 artillerymen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n    Four guns of Major Tombs’ horse-artillery.\r\n    Major Scott’s horse field-battery.\r\n    Two 18-pounders, under Lieutenant Light.\r\n    Two squadrons of Carabiniers.\r\n    Six companies of 60th Rifles.\r\n    400 Sirmoor Goorkhas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n    Head-quarters and six companies of H.M. 60th Rifles.\r\n    Head-quarters and nine companies of H.M. 75th foot.\r\n    1st Bengal European Fusiliers.\r\n    2d Bengal European Fusiliers head-qurs. and six companies.\r\n    Sirmoor battalion (Goorkhas), a wing.\r\n    Head-quarters detachment Sappers and Miners.\r\n    H.M. 9th Lancers.\r\n    H.M. 6th Dragoon-guards (Carabiniers), two squadrons.\r\n    Horse-artillery, one troop of 1st brigade.\r\n    Horse-artillery, two troops of 3d brigade.\r\n    Foot-artillery, two companies,\r\n    and No. 14 horse-battery.\r\n    Artillery recruits, detachment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Chapter iv., pp. 63-65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  After the execution of Mungal Pandy at Barrackpore on the 8th of\r\n  April, for mutiny, the rebel sepoys acquired the soubriquet of\r\n  ‘Pandies’—especially those belonging to the Brahmin caste.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n _Infantry_—                                                  Officers\r\n                                                              and Men.\r\n    H.M. 8th foot, head-quarters,                             188\r\n    H.M. 61st foot, head-quarters,                            296\r\n    H.M. 75th foot, head-quarters,                            513\r\n    H.M. 60th Rifles,  head-quarters,                         299\r\n    1st European Bengal Fusiliers,                            520\r\n    2d  European Bengal Fusiliers,                            556\r\n    Guide Infantry,                                           275\r\n    Sirmoor battalion, Goorkhas,                              296\r\n    1st Punjaub Infantry,                                     725\r\n    4th Sikh Infantry,                                        345\r\n                                                             ———— = 4023\r\n\r\n _Cavalry_—\r\n    H.M.

There are peculiar reasons for this. He came like a brilliant\r\nmeteor at a time when all else was gloomy and overshadowed. Anson had\r\ndied on the way to Delhi; Barnard had died in the camp before that city;\r\nReed had retired, broken down by age and sickness; Wilson had not yet\r\nshewn whether he could work out victory at the great Mogul capital;\r\nWheeler was falling, or had fallen, a miserable victim to the treachery\r\nof Nena Sahib; Henry Lawrence was no more; Hewett and Lloyd were under a\r\ncloud, for mismanagement as military commanders—all this had rendered\r\nthe British nation grieved and irritated; and men fiercely demanded\r\n‘Who’s to blame?’—as if it were necessary to seek relief by wreaking\r\nvengeance on some persons or other. It was a crisis that pressed heavily\r\non Viscount Canning; but it was at the same time a crisis that insured\r\nfervid gratitude to any general who could achieve victories with small\r\nmeans. Such a general was Havelock. The English public knew little of\r\nhim, although he was well known in India. Commencing his career as a\r\nsoldier in 1816, Henry Havelock had borne his full share in all a\r\nsoldier’s varied fortune. He went to India in 1823; engaged in the\r\nBurmese war in 1824; took part in a mission to the court of Siam in\r\n1826; was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 1838; took an active\r\nshare in the stirring scenes of the Afghan campaign, which brought him a\r\nbrevet majority, and the order of C. B.; acted as Persian interpreter to\r\ngenerals Elphinstone, Pollock, and Gough; fought at Gwalior in 1843;\r\nbecame brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1844; fought with the bravest in\r\n1845 at Moodkee, Ferozshah, and Sobraon; and in 1846 received the\r\nappointment of deputy adjutant-general of the Queen’s troops at Bombay.\r\nAn Indian climate during so many years having told—in its customary sad\r\nway—on his constitution, Henry Havelock returned for a sojourn in\r\nEngland. Returning to Bombay in 1851, he became brevet colonel; and in\r\nafter years he was appointed quarter-master-general, and then\r\nadjutant-general, of the whole of the Queen’s troops in India. When the\r\nwar with Persia broke out, he took command of one of the divisions in\r\n1857; and when that war was ended, he returned to Bombay. All this was\r\nknown to official persons in India, but very few of the particulars were\r\nfamiliar to the general public in the home-country; hence, when\r\nHavelock’s victories were announced, the public were surprised as if by\r\nthe sudden appearance of a great genius. That he bore so heavy a\r\nresponsibility, or suffered such intense mental anxiety, as Wheeler at\r\nCawnpore, Inglis at Lucknow, or Colvin at Agra, is not probable; for he\r\nhad not hundreds of helpless women and children under his charge; but\r\nthe astonishing victories he achieved with a mere handful of men, and\r\nthe moral influence he thereby acquired for the British name throughout\r\nthe whole of the Doab, well entitled him to the outburst of grateful\r\nfeeling which the nation was not slow to exhibit. The only danger was,\r\nlest this hero-worship should render the nation blind for a time to the\r\nmerits of other generals.\r\n\r\nNeill and Havelock, who worked so energetically together in planning the\r\nrelief of Lucknow, were brought from other regions of India to take part\r\nin the operations on the Ganges. Neill, as colonel of the 1st Madras\r\nEuropean Fusiliers, accompanied that regiment to Calcutta, and thence\r\nproceeded up the country to Benares, where his contest with the rebels\r\nfirst began. Havelock, landing at Bombay from Persia, set off by steam\r\nto go to Calcutta; he was wrecked on the way near Ceylon, and\r\nexperienced much perilous adventure before he could proceed on his\r\njourney. At Calcutta—where he arrived, in the same steamer which brought\r\nSir Patrick Grant, on the 17th of June—he received the appointment of\r\nbrigadier-general,[57] to command such a force as could be hastily\r\ncollected for the relief, first of the Europeans at Cawnpore, and then\r\nof those at Lucknow; and it was towards the close of June that he made\r\nhis appearance at Allahabad.\r\n\r\nSufficient has been stated in former chapters to shew what was the state\r\nof affairs at that time. Lucknow, Cawnpore, Agra, and Delhi were either\r\nin the hands of the rebels, or were so beset by them that no British\r\ncommander was able to assist his brother-officers. Oude, the Doab, and\r\nRohilcund were in deplorable anarchy; and it depended either upon\r\nViscount Canning at Calcutta, or Sir John Lawrence at Lahore, to send\r\naid to the disturbed districts. Lawrence, as we have seen, and as we\r\nshall see again in a future chapter, with admirable energy and\r\nperseverance, sent such assistance as enabled Wilson to conquer Delhi;\r\nwhile Canning, under enormous difficulty, sent up troops to Allahabad by\r\nscores and fifties at a time, as rapidly as he could collect them at\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Neill preceded Havelock in the operations connected with the\r\nrepression of the mutiny in the Doab and adjacent regions. His own\r\nregiment, the 1st Madras European Fusiliers, had been ordered to proceed\r\nto Persia in the spring, but had received counter-orders in consequence\r\nof the sudden termination of the war in that country. While at Bombay,\r\nuncertain whether commands might be received to proceed to China, the\r\nregiment heard the news of a revolt among the Bengal troops; and very\r\nspeedily, both Persia and China were forgotten in matters of much\r\ngreater exigency and importance. After making the voyage back from\r\nBombay to Madras, the regiment proceeded to Calcutta, and the men were\r\nthen sent up the country as rapidly as possible to Benares, some by road\r\nand the rest by steamers. Neill himself reached that city on the 3d of\r\nJune, and was immediately engaged, as we have already seen (p. 154), in\r\ndisarming a mutinous regiment, and in maintaining order in the vicinity.\r\nAfter six days of incessant work at Benares, the brigadier, hearing of\r\nthe mutiny at Allahabad, started off on the 9th to render service in\r\nthat region. With what a powerful hand he put down the rebels; with what\r\nstern and prompt firmness he retained possession of that important city,\r\nthe ‘key to Upper India’—has already been briefly shewn.[58] The various\r\ncorps of the Madras Fusiliers reached Benares and Allahabad by degrees;\r\nand fragments of other European regiments were sent up as fast as\r\npossible, as the nucleus of a little army forming at Allahabad.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of July may be taken as the day that marked the commencement of\r\nGeneral Havelock’s career in relation to the Indian Revolt. He and his\r\nstaff arrived at Allahabad on that day, after a rapid journey from\r\nCalcutta. A few hours before his arrival, the first relieving column had\r\nbeen sent off by Neill towards Cawnpore: consisting of 200 Madras\r\nFusiliers, 200 of the 84th foot, 300 Sikhs, and 120 irregular cavalry,\r\nunder Major Renaud; and a second, of larger proportions, was to follow\r\nin a week or ten days’ time. The immediate object held in view, in the\r\nmarch of both columns, was to liberate Sir Hugh Wheeler and his hapless\r\ncompanions at Cawnpore; and, if this were accomplished, the second work\r\nto be done was to advance and relieve Sir Henry Lawrence and the British\r\nat Lucknow. It was not at that time known that, before the second column\r\ncould start from Allahabad, both Wheeler and Lawrence had been numbered\r\nwith the dead. Neill superseded the officer previously in command at\r\nAllahabad; Havelock superseded Neill in command of the relieving force;\r\nwe shall have to speak of Outram superseding Havelock; and we have\r\nalready spoken of Patrick Grant superseding Reed, and of Colin Campbell\r\nsuperseding Grant. All these supersessions were in virtue of military\r\nroutine, depending either on seniority, or on the exercise of a right to\r\nmake appointments. If these various officers had been unsuccessful, the\r\nsystem of supersession would have been attacked by adverse judges as the\r\ncause of the failure; but there was so much nobility of mind displayed\r\nby four or five of the gallant men here named, that the vexation often\r\ncaused by supersession was much alleviated; while the nation at large\r\nhad ample reason to admire and be thankful for the deeds of arms that\r\naccompanied generosity of feeling.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d, an auxiliary force under Captain Spurgin, left Allahabad for\r\nCawnpore, irrespective of the two columns. It consisted only of 100\r\nMadras Europeans armed with rifles, 12 artillerymen, and two 6-pounder\r\nguns; it went by steamer up the Ganges, partly in order to control the\r\nmutineers on the banks, but in part also on account of the paucity of\r\nmeans for land-conveyance. No steamer had had much success in that part\r\nof the Ganges; and hence great interest was felt in the voyage of the\r\n_Brahmaputra_. As a first difficulty, the engineers, having no coals,\r\nwere obliged to forage for wood every day on shore. On the second day of\r\nthe trip, this foraging had to be protected by half the force, against a\r\nbody of 500 insurgents on the Oude bank, provided with a large piece of\r\nordnance; the wood was not obtained without a regular battle, in which\r\n50 English ‘thrashed’—to use a very favourite term among the\r\nsoldiers—just ten times their number of rebels, and captured their gun.\r\nOn they went, struggling against the rapid stream of the Ganges, and\r\nnever making more than two miles an hour. The enemy hovered on the\r\nbanks, and sent several round shot into the little iron steamer—a sort\r\nof irritation that kept the crew and soldiers well on the alert. Day\r\nafter day passed in this way, Captain Spurgin timing his movements so as\r\nto accord with the march of the land-columns. The steamer reached\r\nCawnpore on the 17th, just a fortnight after the departure from\r\nAllahabad—a degree of slowness not altogether dependent on the\r\ndifficulty of the navigation, but partly due to the necessity of not\r\nadvancing more rapidly than the columns could fight their way on shore.\r\n\r\nThe dismal news gradually reached Allahabad that some dreadful calamity\r\nhad occurred at Cawnpore. This information led Havelock to modify his\r\nplans and quicken his movements; and, full of heart, he transmitted to\r\nCalcutta the telegram already quoted, to the effect that ‘1000\r\nEuropeans, 1000 Goorkhas, and 1000 Sikhs, with 8 or 10 guns, will thrash\r\neverything.’ Among the troops he collected was a handful of volunteer\r\ncavalry, consisting chiefly of officers who had been left without\r\ncommand by the mutiny of their respective native regiments, or had\r\nnarrowly escaped massacre; the number amounted only to a score; but it\r\ncomprised just the sort of men who would be ready for any enterprise at\r\nsuch a time.\r\n\r\nMajor Renaud had every reason to be satisfied with the gallantry of the\r\nMadras Fusiliers—to which corps he belonged—and of the other troops who\r\naided in forming his small column, in various minor operations during\r\nthe first nine days of the march from Allahabad. He everywhere pacified\r\nthe country by punishing the ringleaders in mutiny and rebellion\r\nwherever and whenever they fell into his hands. Suddenly, however, he\r\nfound himself placed in an awkward position on the 10th. Cawnpore had\r\nfallen; the British at that station had either been killed or thrown\r\ninto prison; and the rebel force thus freed from occupation had rapidly\r\npushed down to the vicinity of Futtehpoor—a town which had been in the\r\nhands of the rebels since the 9th of June (see p. 172). That force was\r\nat least 3500 strong, with 12 guns; whereas Renaud had at that time only\r\n820 men and 2 guns. General Havelock, becoming aware of this state of\r\nthings, saw that his force ought to join that of Renaud as quickly as\r\npossible. He marched twenty miles on the 11th, under a frightful sun, to\r\nSynee; then, after resting a few hours, he and his troops resumed their\r\nmarch at eleven o’clock in the evening, overtook Renaud during the\r\nnight, and marched with him by moonlight to Khaga, five miles short of\r\nFuttehpoor. His little army consisted of about 2000 men, made up of a\r\ncurious collection of fragments from various regiments; and as it was\r\ndestined to achieve great results with limited resources, it may be\r\ninteresting to tabulate the component elements of this admirable little\r\nband.[59] Havelock’s information proved to be better than that of the\r\nenemy, for when he sent forward Colonel Tytler with a reconnaissance,\r\nthe enemy supposed they had only Renaud’s small force to contend with;\r\nthey fired on the colonel and his escort, and pushed forward two guns\r\nand a force of infantry and cavalry. When the enemy began to cannonade\r\nhis front and threaten his right and left, Havelock saw that the time\r\nwas come to undeceive them: he would have preferred to give his worn-out\r\nsoldiers a few hours’ rest; but this was not now to be thought of, as,\r\nto use his own words, ‘it would have injured the _morale_ of the troops\r\nto permit them thus to be bearded.’ The work before him was sufficiently\r\nformidable; for there was only the main trunk-road by which to approach\r\nFuttehpoor easily; the fields on either side were covered with a depth\r\nof two or three feet of water; there were many enclosures of great\r\nstrength, with high walls; and in front of the city were many villages,\r\nhillocks, and mango-groves which the enemy occupied in force. Havelock\r\nplaced his eight guns on and near the main road, protected by 100\r\nriflemen of the 64th; the infantry came up at deploying distance,\r\ncovered by rifle-skirmishers; and the cavalry moved forward on the\r\nflanks. The struggle was literally decided in ten minutes. The enemy saw\r\na few riflemen approach; but they knew little of the Enfield rifle; and\r\nwere panic-stricken with the length and accuracy of its range; they\r\nshrank back in astonishment; and then Captain Maude, who had dashed over\r\nthe swamps with his artillery, poured into them a fire so rapid and\r\naccurate as to complete their discomfiture. Three guns were abandoned at\r\nonce, and Havelock steadily advanced, with the 64th commanding the\r\ncentre, the 78th the right, the 84th and the Sikhs the left. He drove\r\nthe enemy before him at every point, capturing their guns one by one;\r\nthe garden enclosures, the barricades on the road, the city wall, the\r\nstreets of Futtehpoor, all were gained in turn. The enemy retreated\r\nright through the city, till they reached a mile beyond it; but they\r\nthen attempted to make a stand. This attempt gave Havelock some trouble,\r\nbecause his infantry were almost utterly exhausted by fatigue, and\r\nbecause the few irregular horse shewed symptoms of a tendency to go over\r\nto the enemy unless narrowly watched. Again the guns and rifles came to\r\nthe front, and again they attacked in a manner so irresistible as to put\r\nthe enemy effectively to flight. Havelock thus became master of\r\nFuttehpoor, and parked 12 captured guns. It was with a justifiable pride\r\nthat the general, in sending his list of ‘casualties,’ remarked that it\r\nwas ‘perhaps the lightest that ever accompanied the announcement of such\r\nsuccess. Twelve British soldiers were struck down by the sun, and never\r\nrose again;’ but not one was either killed or wounded in the action; his\r\ncasualties, 6 killed and 3 wounded, were among his native troops. The\r\ntruth seems to be, that the enemy were dismayed, first by finding that\r\nHavelock had joined Renaud, and then by the wonderful range of the\r\nEnfield rifles. ‘Our fight was fought neither with musket, nor bayonet,\r\nnor sabre, but with Enfield rifles and cannon; so we took no prisoners.\r\nThe enemy’s fire scarcely reached us; ours, for four hours, allowed him\r\nno repose.’ It was with good cause that he thanked and congratulated his\r\ntroops on the following day, in a ‘morning order,’ short but pithy.[60]\r\n\r\nWhile encamped at Kullenpore or Kullianpore, on the 14th, to which he\r\nhad marched after a sojourn at Futtehpoor sufficient to afford his\r\ntroops that rest which had become absolutely necessary, Havelock sent\r\noff a brief telegram, announcing that his capture of artillery at\r\nFuttehpoor would enable him to substitute nine excellent field-guns for\r\nsix of lighter calibre, and also to bring into action two light\r\n6-pounders.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the brigadier-general’s first victory over the rebels;\r\nit elated his own troops, and checked the audacity of those to whom he\r\nwas opposed. Neill, meanwhile, was anxiously watching at Allahabad. He\r\nhad worked hard to organise and send off the first portion of the force\r\nunder Renaud, the second under Spurgin, and the third under Havelock. He\r\nhad received from Renaud, on the 4th of the month, information which\r\nrendered only too probable the rumour that an act of black treachery on\r\nthe part of Nena Sahib at Cawnpore had been followed by a wholesale\r\ndestruction of hapless fugitives in boats on the Ganges. Neill was thus\r\nespecially anxious that Renaud should advance at once with the first\r\ncolumn, and Spurgin with the detachment up the river; but Havelock saw\r\nreason why those officers should somewhat delay their advance until he\r\ncould come up to them, in order that all might if possible enter\r\nCawnpore together.\r\n\r\nHavelock, after marching and resting on the 13th and 14th, came up again\r\nwith the enemy on the 15th. When approaching the small stream called the\r\nPandoo Nuddee, it became important to him to ascertain what was the\r\nstate of the bridge which carried the high road over that river, at a\r\nspot about twenty miles from Cawnpore. The stream was too deep to be\r\nfordable at that season: hence the importance of obtaining command of\r\nthe bridge. His intelligencers ascertained that the enemy intended to\r\ndispute his passage at the village of Aong, four miles short of the\r\nNuddee; by means of two guns commanding the high road, skirmishers on\r\nthe right and left of those guns, and cavalry to hover on the flanks of\r\nany advancing force. This information being obtained, Havelock sent\r\nforward his skirmishers on the right and left of the road; then his\r\nvolunteer cavalry on the road itself; then the ten guns in line, mostly\r\non the left of the road; and then the infantry in line—the 64th and 84th\r\non the right flank; the 78th, Fusiliers, and Sikhs, on the left. The\r\nstruggle ahead was not a severe one, for the enemy receded as the\r\nBritish under Colonel Tytler advanced; but Havelock was much harassed by\r\nthe attempts of the hostile cavalry to get into his rear and plunder his\r\nbaggage: attempts that required much exertion from his infantry to\r\nresist, seeing that the thickly wooded country interfered with the\r\neffect of cannon and musketry. The enemy after a time abandoned guns,\r\ntents, ammunition, and other materials of war, and made a hasty retreat\r\nthrough the village.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty over, Havelock prepared for another struggle at the\r\nPandoo Nuddee, which it was necessary for him to cross as speedily as\r\npossible. He rested and refreshed his troops for a few hours, and\r\nadvanced the same afternoon, on a fiercely hot July day. The enemy had\r\nnot destroyed the bridge, but had placed two guns in épaulement to\r\ncommand it at the opposite side of the stream. Captain Maude disposed\r\nhis artillery so as to bring a converging fire upon the two guns of the\r\nenemy; while the Madras Fusiliers commenced a fire with Enfield rifles\r\nto pick off the gunners. The two guns were fired directly down the road\r\nat the advancing British column; but after Maude had somewhat checked\r\nthis fire, the Fusiliers gallantly closed, rushed upon the bridge, and\r\ncaptured both guns—an exploit in which Major Renaud was wounded. The\r\nmutineers precipitately retreated. Thus did the brigadier-general\r\nachieve two victories in one day—those of Aong and Pandoo Nuddee. True,\r\nthe victories were not great in a military sense; but they were effected\r\nover a numerous force by a mere handful of troops, who fought after\r\nwearying marches under a solar heat such as residents in England can\r\nwith difficulty imagine. Havelock had only 1 man killed during these two\r\nactions; 25 were wounded. The loss of the enemy was at least ten times\r\ngreater; but the chief result of the battles was the dismay into which\r\nNena Sahib was thrown.\r\n\r\nGeneral Havelock, like other commanders at that critical time, found the\r\nnative Bengal troops in his force not to be trusted. Their conduct in\r\npresence of the enemy on the 12th excited his suspicion; it was, indeed,\r\nworse than doubtful; and on the 14th he found it necessary to disarm and\r\ndismount his sowars of the 13th Irregulars and 3d Oude Irregulars—at the\r\nsame time threatening with instant death any one of their number who\r\nshould attempt to escape. One of the officers at Allahabad who joined\r\nthe volunteer cavalry, and had opportunity of observing the conduct of\r\nthe irregulars at the battle of Futtehpoor, wrote thus concerning it:\r\n‘On seeing the enemy, Palliser called to the men to charge, and dashed\r\non; but the scoundrels scarcely altered their speed, and met the enemy\r\nat the same pace that they came down towards us. Their design was\r\nevident; they came waving their swords to our men, and riding round our\r\nparty, making signs to them to go over to their side. When our men thus\r\nhung back, a dash out would certainly have ended in our being cut up.’\r\nDuring a subsequent skirmish, ‘our rear-men turned tail and left us,\r\ngalloping back as hard as their horses could go; and we were forced to\r\ncommence a regular race for our necks.... I write this with shame and\r\ngrief; but it was no fault of Palliser’s or ours.’ Havelock saw the\r\nnecessity of disarming and dismounting such fellows.\r\n\r\nThe scene of operations now approaches Cawnpore, that city of\r\nunutterable horrors! It was a desperate struggle that Nena Sahib made to\r\nretain the supremacy he had obtained at Cawnpore. He probably cared\r\nlittle for kings of Delhi or for greased cartridges, provided he could\r\nmaintain a hold of sovereign power. When he had broken faith with Sir\r\nHugh Wheeler, and had carried his treachery to the extent of\r\nindiscriminate slaughter in the Ganges boats, he naturally hoped to\r\nbecome leader of the rebellious sepoys. In this object, however, he did\r\nnot wholly succeed; he and his immediate followers were Mahrattas; the\r\nmutineers were mostly Hindustanis; and the latter made little account of\r\nthe Nena’s claim to sovereignty. Had the issue depended upon the\r\ninfantry sepoys, who were in chief part Hindoos, and who chiefly looked\r\nfor plunder, his projects might speedily have come to an end; but the\r\ncavalry sepoys, being mostly Mohammedans, and exhibiting a more deadly\r\nhatred towards the British, more readily joined him in a combined plan\r\nof operations, and drew the sepoys to act with them. Leaving Delhi to be\r\nheld by the large body of mutineers, Nena Sahib took upon himself the\r\noffice of crushing any British force that might make its appearance from\r\nAllahabad. When he heard that Renaud had started with his little band,\r\nhe got together a force of sowars, sepoys, Mahrattas, artillery, and\r\nrabble; having motives of fear as well as of self-interest to induce him\r\nto prevent the advance of his opponent. Not knowing that Renaud had been\r\njoined by Havelock, the Mahratta chieftain sent bodies of troops\r\nsufficient, as he believed, to check the advance; but when the gallant\r\ngeneral swept everything before him, the arch-fiend of Bithoor saw that\r\nthe matter was becoming serious. He had had experience of the\r\nindomitable resistance, under accumulated suffering, of the hapless Sir\r\nHugh Wheeler and his companions; but now a British general had to be\r\nencountered in the open field. So far as is known, it appears that as\r\nsoon as he heard of the passage of the Pandoo Nuddee by Havelock, Nena\r\nSahib ordered the slaughter of all the captives yet remaining alive at\r\nCawnpore—in order either that the dead might tell no tales, or that he\r\nmight wreak vengeance on the innocent for the frustration of his plans.\r\nHaving committed this bloody deed, he went out with an army, and took up\r\na position at Aherwa, the point at which the road to the cantonment\r\nbranches out from the main trunk-road to Cawnpore city. Nena Sahib\r\ncommanded five villages, with numerous intrenchments, armed with seven\r\nguns; and in the rear was his infantry. Havelock, after advancing\r\nsixteen miles from the Pandoo Nuddee to Aherwa during the night of the\r\n15th, and after measuring the strength of this force, saw that his\r\ntroops would be shot down in alarming numbers before the guns could be\r\nsilenced and the intrenchments carried; he resolved, therefore, on a\r\nflank-movement on the enemy’s left. As a preliminary, he left his camp\r\nand baggage under proper escort at Maharajpoor, a few miles in the rear;\r\nand gave his sunburnt and exhausted troops two or three hours’ rest in a\r\nmango-grove during mid-day of the 16th, until the fierce heat should\r\nhave somewhat abated. The hour of struggle having arrived, Havelock\r\nquietly wheeled his force round to the left flank of the enemy’s\r\nposition, behind a screen of clumps of mango. When the enemy detected\r\nthis manœuvre, great sensation was displayed; a body of horse was soon\r\nsent to the left, and cannon opened fire in that direction. Then came a\r\nseries of operations in which the superb qualities of British infantry\r\nwere strikingly displayed. Villages were attacked and captured one after\r\nanother, by fragments of regiments so small that one marvels how the\r\nenemy could have yielded before them. One such exploit is thus narrated\r\nin Havelock’s own language: ‘The opportunity had arrived, for which I\r\nhave long anxiously waited, of developing the prowess of the 78th\r\nHighlanders. Three guns of the enemy were strongly posted behind a lofty\r\nhamlet, well intrenched. I directed this regiment to advance; and never\r\nhave I witnessed conduct more admirable. They were led by Colonel\r\nHamilton, and followed him with surpassing steadiness and gallantry\r\nunder a heavy fire. As they approached the village, they cheered and\r\ncharged with the bayonet, the pipes sounding the pibroch. Need I add\r\nthat the enemy fled, the village was taken, and the guns captured?’\r\nAfter three or four villages had thus changed hands, the enemy planted a\r\n24-pounder gun on the cantonment road in such a position as to work much\r\nmischief upon Havelock, whose artillery cattle were so worn out with\r\nheat and fatigue that they could not drag the guns onward to a desired\r\nposition. The Nena appearing to have in project a renewed attack,\r\nHavelock resolved to anticipate him; he cheered on his infantry to a\r\ncapture of the 24-pounder; they rushed along the road amid a storm of\r\ngrape-shot from the enemy, and never slackened till they had reached the\r\ngun and captured it. Especially was the 64th, led by Major Stirling,\r\nconspicuous in this bold enterprise. The enemy lost all heart; they\r\nretreated, blew up the magazine of Cawnpore on their way, and then went\r\non to Bithoor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Plan of action near Cawnpore, July 16, 1857.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus was fought the battle of Cawnpore, the conquest of which place had\r\nfor so many weeks been anxiously looked forward to by the British. True,\r\nthey had heard, and under too great a variety of detail to warrant\r\ndisbelief, that Sir Hugh Wheeler and his gallant companions had been\r\nmost treacherously murdered by the ruthless chieftain of Bithoor; but\r\nyet a hope clung to them that some of their compatriots at least might\r\nbe alive at Cawnpore. On this 16th of July, Havelock’s small force was\r\nlessened by the loss of 6 killed and 98 wounded or missing—a loss\r\nwonderfully slight under the circumstances, but serious to him. Captain\r\nCurrie of the 84th received a wound so desperate that he sank under it\r\nin a few hours; Major Stirling was slightly wounded; Captain Beatson,\r\nattacked with cholera on the morning of the fight, held up with heroic\r\nbearing during the whole day, but died soon afterwards. The enemy lost\r\nseven guns on this day, of which three were 24-pounders.\r\n\r\nSome of the Europeans bore an almost incredible amount of hard labour on\r\nthis day of fierce July heat. One, a youth of eighteen who had joined\r\nthe volunteer cavalry, had been on picket all the preceding night, with\r\nno refreshment save biscuit and water; he then marched with the rest\r\nsixteen miles during the forenoon; then stood sentry for an hour with\r\nthe enemy hovering around him; then fought during the whole afternoon;\r\nthen lay down supperless to rest at nightfall, holding his horse’s\r\nbridle the while; then mounted night-guard from nine till eleven\r\no’clock; and then had his midnight sleep broken by an alarm from the\r\nenemy. It was on this occasion, too, that Lieutenant Marshman Havelock,\r\nson of the general, to whom he acted as aid-de-camp, performed a\r\nperilous duty in such a way as to earn for himself the Victoria Cross—a\r\nbadge of honour established in 1856 for acts of personal heroism. The\r\ngeneral thus narrated the incident, in one of his dispatches: ‘The 64th\r\nregiment had been much under artillery-fire, from which it had severely\r\nsuffered. The whole of the infantry were lying down in line, when,\r\nperceiving that the enemy had brought out the last reserved gun, a\r\n24-pounder, and were rallying round it, I called up the regiment to rise\r\nand advance. Without any other word from me, Lieutenant Havelock placed\r\nhimself on his horse, in front of the centre of the 64th, opposite the\r\nmuzzle of the gun. Major Stirling, commanding the regiment, was in\r\nfront, dismounted; but the lieutenant continued to move steadily on in\r\nfront of the regiment at a foot-pace, on his horse. The gun discharged\r\nshot until the troops were within a short distance, when it fired grape.\r\nIn went the corps, led by the lieutenant, who still steered steadily on\r\nthe gun’s muzzle until it was mastered by a rush of the 64th.’ It is\r\ndifficult for civilians adequately to comprehend the cool courage\r\nrequired in an act like this; where a soldier walks his horse directly\r\nup in front of a large piece of cannon which is loaded and fired at him\r\nand his comrades as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat the British troops saw when they entered Cawnpore, has already\r\nengaged our attention (pp. 142-145). None could ever forget it to their\r\ndying day. It was on the 17th of July that Havelock, after a night’s\r\nrest for his exhausted troops, entered the city, and learned the hideous\r\nrevelations of the slaughter-room and the well. What steps were\r\nimmediately taken in Cawnpore, has been noticed in the chapter just\r\ncited; and the dismal story need not be repeated. The general could not\r\nwait to attend to those matters at that time; he had still to learn what\r\nwere the movements of Nena Sahib after the battle of the preceding\r\nday—whether the Mahratta intended or not to make a stand in his palace\r\nat Bithoor. Sending forward part of his troops therefore on the\r\nafternoon of the 17th, he found the enemy in a very strong position.\r\nTheir force consisted of the insurgent 31st and 42d Bengal infantry from\r\nSaugor, the 17th from Fyzabad, sepoys from various other regiments,\r\ntroops of the cavalry regiments, and a portion of Nena Sahib’s\r\nMahrattas—about 4000 men in all. The plain in front of Bithoor,\r\ndiversified by thickets and villages, had two streams flowing through\r\nit, not fordable, and only to be crossed by two narrow bridges. The\r\nenemy held both bridges, and defended them well. The streams prevented\r\nHavelock from turning the enemy’s flanks; and when his infantry\r\nassaulted the position, they were received with heavy rifle and musketry\r\nfire. After an hour of very severe struggle, he effected a crossing,\r\ndrove them back, captured their guns, and chased them towards Sorajpore.\r\nHe had no cavalry to maintain a pursuit—indeed the want of cavalry was\r\nfelt sadly by him in every one of his battles. This contest cost the\r\nenemy about 250 men, the British about one-fifth of the number; in this\r\nlast-named list was included only one officer, Captain Mackenzie of the\r\n78th Highlanders, who was slightly wounded.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was one part of the enterprise accomplished. Cawnpore had\r\nbeen recaptured, and the road cleared of rebels between that place and\r\nAllahabad. It was on the 30th of June that Renaud had left the\r\nlast-named place with the first division, and on the 3d of July that\r\nSpurgin had set off with the detachment by steamer. It was on the 7th\r\nthat Havelock had placed himself at the head of the second division, and\r\nmarched forth to overtake the two others—carrying with him the\r\nrecollection of a scowl from many of the Mussulman inhabitants of the\r\ncity. He had seen, as he went along, evidences of Renaud’s stern energy,\r\nin the number of rebellious sepoys hanging from gibbets and trees by the\r\nroadside. He and his troops had made ordinary Indian marches the first\r\nthree or four days, in alternate rain and fierce heat, and within sight\r\nof destroyed bungalows and devastated homesteads; but when the news from\r\nRenaud arrived, forced marches were made. Then came the battle of\r\nFuttehpoor on the 12th, that of Aong on the morning of the 14th, that of\r\nPundoo Nuddee on the afternoon of the same day, that of Cawnpore on the\r\n16th, and that of Bithoor on the 17th—five victories in six days,\r\nspreading the fame of Havelock far and wide throughout the surrounding\r\ndistricts. The future tactics had then to be resolved upon. Cawnpore had\r\nbeen recovered, although the garrison could not be saved; but there was\r\nanother British garrison, another group of suffering British women and\r\nchildren, to be thought of—at Lucknow. The general well knew how\r\ndesperate was the work before him, with the reduced and sickened force\r\nat his command; but he was not the man to shrink from making an attempt,\r\nat least, to relieve Brigadier Inglis and his companions. Feeling the\r\nurgent need of more troops, and the imperative necessity of holding\r\nCawnpore safely while he himself advanced into Oude, Havelock had\r\nalready sent to Allahabad, requesting Neill to come if possible in\r\nperson to Cawnpore, and to bring reinforcements with him. It was easier\r\nfor Neill to respond to the first of these two appeals than to the\r\nsecond; he would have gone anywhere, borne any amount of fatigue, to\r\nshare in the good work; but he found himself already reduced to so few\r\ntroops at Allahabad as to be barely able to maintain that place.\r\nNevertheless, after counting heads and measuring strength, he ventured\r\nto draft off 227 men of the 84th foot from his little force; he started\r\nthem forth on the 15th, partly by bullock-trains, to reach Cawnpore on\r\nthe 20th. He himself set out on the 16th—the day of the battle of\r\nCawnpore—leaving Allahabad under the command of Captain Drummond Hay of\r\nthe 78th Highlanders, until Colonel O’Brien could arrive. After a rapid\r\njourney, Neill reached Cawnpore, took military command of that place and\r\nits neighbourhood, and assisted Havelock in the preparations necessary\r\nfor crossing the Ganges into Oude. One great necessity was perceived on\r\nthe instant by both generals; English soldiers, with all their good\r\nqualities, are prone to drink; and Havelock soon found, to use his own\r\nwords, that ‘half his men would be needed to keep the other half from\r\ngetting drunk’ if they had easy access to liquor; he therefore bought up\r\nall spare beverages in Cawnpore, and placed them in the hands of the\r\ncommissariat. A calamity much grieved the little army at this time.\r\nMajor Renaud, who had so successfully brought forward the first column\r\nfrom Allahabad, sank under the effects of a wound he had received. A\r\nbullet had hit him above the knee, forcing part of the scabbard of his\r\nsword into the wound, and causing much suffering; amputation seemed to\r\nafford some relief, but only for a time; he died soon after the arrival\r\nof Neill, who had highly valued him as a trusty officer in his own\r\nMadras Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nGlancing at a map, we see that the high road from Cawnpore to Lucknow is\r\nbroken at its very commencement by the river Ganges, which, at this\r\npoint, varies from five hundred to two thousand yards in width. There\r\nis, of course, no bridge here; and as the stream is usually very rapid,\r\nthe transport of troops necessarily becomes slow, difficult, and\r\ndangerous work. Havelock began to cross on the 20th of July, but many\r\ndays elapsed before the task was completed. The _Brahmaputra_ steamer,\r\nwhich brought Spurgin’s detachment to Cawnpore on the 17th, was, with a\r\nfew open boats, the only available resource for this work. By the 23d,\r\nabout 1100 of his troops had crossed over into Oude—every boat-load\r\nhaving to battle against a broad and swift current. All possible baggage\r\nwas left behind, each man taking with him a very small supply of\r\nclothing and food.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, Havelock sent a short telegram to the\r\ncommander-in-chief—announcing that Nena Sahib’s followers appeared to be\r\ndeserting him; that he had fled from Bithoor; that the British had\r\nre-entered that place on the 19th; and that the palace had been reduced\r\nto ashes, and 13 guns captured. On the next day a further communication\r\nwas sent to the effect that three more guns, and a number of animals,\r\nhad been brought along from Bithoor, and that the magazine had been\r\nblown up. Subsequent events proved that the Nena, though forced to flee,\r\nstill retained a body of troops under his command.\r\n\r\nWhen the brigadier-general, on the 23d of July, had so far succeeded in\r\ntransporting his gallant little army over the majestic Ganges; and when\r\nhis sanguine hopes had led him to believe that he could conquer Lucknow\r\nin two or three days, then arose in his mind the important strategic\r\nquestion—What next? Should he remain in Oude after the capture of\r\nLucknow, and effect the thorough reconquest of that province; or should\r\nhe hastily recross the Ganges, march to Agra, liberate Colvin and the\r\nother Europeans in the fort, pick up any available force there, and\r\nadvance to aid in the siege of Delhi? Sir Patrick Grant, who was\r\ncommander-in-chief at that time, was solicited by telegram for an answer\r\nto this query. He strenuously recommended that Havelock, once in Oude,\r\nshould remain there if possible. ‘If he merely relieves the beleaguered\r\ngarrison of Lucknow, and, after accomplishing that object, instantly\r\nrecrosses the Ganges into our own provinces, it will be thought and\r\nbelieved throughout India that he had signally failed to reconquer Oude,\r\nand that he was driven out of the province by force of arms. The\r\ninsurgents, though beaten before Lucknow, would assuredly collect again,\r\nand follow up the retiring army, prevent supplies from coming into camp,\r\nand reduce our troops to great straits and hazards when recrossing the\r\nGanges—the passage of which, even when wholly unopposed, the\r\nbrigadier-general describes as having been a very difficult and tedious\r\noperation.’ This exactly coincided with Havelock’s own view; and he\r\ntherefore turned a deaf ear to all applications for aid made to him by\r\nthe commanders at Agra and Delhi.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 25th that Havelock, after seeing his army safely\r\nacross the river, made the passage himself from the Doab into Oude.\r\nNeill, with a very small number of troops, prepared to hold Cawnpore\r\nsafely during Havelock’s absence. He re-established British power\r\nthroughout the place; offered government rewards for bringing in\r\ncaptured rebels and public property; appointed Captain Bruce to the post\r\nof superintendent of the police and intelligence departments; purchased\r\ntroop-horses in the neighbouring districts; and made arrangements for\r\nkeeping the road open and unmolested between Cawnpore and Allahabad. All\r\nthis he did, besides taking care of Havelock’s sick and wounded, with a\r\nforce of only 300 men—such was the result of the bravery of a soldier\r\nand the skill of a commander, when combined in the same person.\r\n\r\nWhen Havelock had advanced six miles from the Ganges, at a place called\r\nMungulwar, he was met by a messenger who had succeeded in eluding the\r\nvigilance of the insurgents at Lucknow, and had brought a plan of that\r\ncity prepared by Major Anderson, together with some brief but valuable\r\ninformation from Brigadier Inglis. The details were partly written in\r\nGreek character, as a measure of precaution. Havelock now saw the full\r\nimportance and difficulty of the work before him. His own little band\r\nwas reduced to 1500 men, supported by 10 badly equipped and manned guns.\r\nOn the other hand, he learned that the enemy had intrenched and covered\r\nwith guns the long bridge across the Sye (Saee) at Bunnee, and had made\r\npreparations for destroying it if the passage were forced. Nor was his\r\nrear less imperiled than his front; for Nena Sahib had collected 3000\r\nmen and several guns, with which he intended to get between Havelock and\r\nthe Ganges, to cut off his retreat. Nothing but the anxious dangers and\r\ndifficulties of the Europeans at Lucknow would have induced the gallant\r\nman to advance under such perilous odds. He said in one of his\r\ndispatches to the government on the 28th: ‘The communications convince\r\nme of the extreme delicacy and difficulty of any operation to relieve\r\nInglis; it shall be attempted, however, at every risk.’ Could he have\r\nknown how anxiously the beleaguered British in the Residency at Lucknow\r\nwas looking for him, his heart would have bled for them; Major Anderson\r\nhad sent him a military plan, but the messenger was too much imperiled\r\nto bring any lengthened narrative.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Onao or Oonao was one of the most surprising of the series\r\nin which Havelock was engaged. His passage towards Lucknow was disputed\r\non the 29th by the enemy, who had taken up a strong position. Their\r\nright was protected by a swamp which could neither be forced nor turned;\r\ntheir advanced corps was in a garden enclosure which assumed the form of\r\na bastion; and the rest of their force was posted in and behind a\r\nvillage, the houses of which were loopholed and defended by 15 guns. The\r\npassage between the village and the town of Onao was very narrow; but\r\nalong this passage the attack had to be made—because the swamp precluded\r\nan advance on the one flank, while the flooded state of the country\r\nequally rendered the other impassable. The attack was commenced by the\r\n78th Highlanders and the 1st Fusiliers, who, with two guns, soon drove\r\nthe enemy out of the bastioned enclosure; but when they approached the\r\nvillage, they were exposed to a hot fire from the loopholed houses. A\r\nparty of the 84th foot advanced in aid; and then a determined struggle\r\nensued; the village was set on fire, but still the enemy resisted with a\r\nbravery worthy of a better cause. At length the passage between the town\r\nand the village was forced; and then the enemy were seen drawn up in\r\ngreat strength in an open plain—infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\r\nNevertheless Havelock attacked them, captured their guns, and put the\r\nhorse and foot to flight. During all this time a large detachment of\r\nNena Sahib’s troops, under Jupah Singh, threatened the left flank of the\r\nBritish, in the not unreasonable hope of being able to annihilate such a\r\nhandful of men. No sooner had Havelock given his troops two or three\r\nhours’ rest, than he advanced from Onao to Busherutgunje. This was a\r\nwalled town, with wet ditches, a gate defended by a round tower, four\r\npieces of cannon on and near the tower, loopholed and strengthened\r\nbuildings within the walls, and a broad and deep pond or lake beyond the\r\ntown. Havelock sent the Highlanders and Fusiliers, under cover of the\r\nguns, to capture the earthworks and enter the town; while the 64th made\r\na flank movement on the left, and cut off the communication from the\r\ntown by a chaussée and bridge over the lake. His few horse could do\r\nnothing for want of open ground on which to manœuvre; but his guns and\r\nhis infantry soon captured the place and drove the enemy before them. In\r\nthese two battles on one day, he had 12 killed and 76 wounded; while the\r\nenemy is supposed to have lost half as many men as Havelock’s whole\r\nforce. He also captured 19 guns, but as he had no gunners to work them,\r\nor horses to draw them, they were destroyed—two by spiking, and\r\nseventeen by shot. In a dispatch relating to this day’s hard work, the\r\ngeneral, after describing the brief but desperate contest among the\r\nloopholed houses, said: ‘Here some daring feats of bravery were\r\nperformed. Private Patrick Cavanagh, of the 64th, was cut literally in\r\npieces by the enemy, while setting an example of distinguished\r\ngallantry. Had he lived I should have deemed him worthy of the Victoria\r\nCross; it could never have glittered on a more gallant breast.’ This\r\nmode of noticing the merit of private soldiers endeared Havelock to his\r\ntroops. Cavanagh had been the first to leap over a wall from behind\r\nwhich it was necessary to drive the enemy; he found himself confronted\r\nby at least a dozen troopers, two or three of whom he killed; but he was\r\ncut to pieces by the rest before his comrades could come to his aid.\r\n\r\nIt must have been with a pang of deep regret that the general, hitherto\r\nsuccessful in every encounter, found it necessary, on the 31st of July,\r\nto make his first retrograde movement. He never scrupled to attack\r\nthousands of the enemy with hundreds of his own troops, in open battle;\r\nthe odds, whether five to one or ten to one, did not deter him; but when\r\nhis whole force, his miniature army of operations, became reduced to\r\nlittle more than the number for one full regiment, the question arose\r\nwhether any men would be left at all, after fighting the whole distance\r\nto Lucknow. He had no means for crossing the Sye river or the great\r\ncanal, as the enemy had taken care either to destroy or to guard all the\r\nbridges; and in every military requirement—except courage—his force was\r\nbecoming daily weaker. Besides officers and men who had been killed or\r\nwounded in fair fight, numbers had been struck down by the sun; while\r\nothers, through exposure to swamps and marshes, had been seized with\r\ncholera, diarrhœa, and dysentery; insomuch that Havelock was losing at\r\nthe rate of fifty men a day. In addition to all this, as he could leave\r\nno men behind him to keep open the communication with Cawnpore, he was\r\nobliged to take all his sick and wounded with him. His little band being\r\nnow reduced by battle and disease to 1364 men, he determined on receding\r\ntwo short marches, to wait until reinforcements of some kind could reach\r\nhim. Colonel Tytler, his quartermaster-general, strongly confirmed the\r\nnecessity of this retreat. He saw no possibility of more than 600 men\r\nreaching Lucknow alive and in fighting condition; and they would then\r\nhave had two miles of street-fighting before reaching the Residency. He\r\nrecommended a retreat from Busherutgunje to Mungulwar; and this retreat\r\nwas made under the earnest hope that aid would arrive soon enough to\r\npermit an advance to Lucknow within a week—aid most urgently needed,\r\nseeing that the garrison at that place was becoming very short of\r\nprovisions. The troops, of course, were a little disheartened by this\r\nretrograde movement. They rested in Busherutgunje from the early morning\r\nof the 30th to the afternoon, when they received the order to retreat.\r\nIt was not till after the reasons were explained to them, that his\r\ngallant companions in arms could at all reconcile themselves to this\r\norder from the general. They marched back that evening to Onao, and the\r\nfollowing morning to Mungulwar.\r\n\r\nThe month of August began under dispiriting circumstances to Havelock.\r\nHis chance of reaching Lucknow was smaller than ever; although greater\r\nthan ever was the need of the garrison at that place for his assistance.\r\nHe sent back his sick and wounded from Mungulwar to Cawnpore, across the\r\nGanges, and committed them to Neill’s keeping. He explained to that\r\ngeneral the reasons for his retreat, and asked for further\r\nreinforcements if such were by any means obtainable. Neill was able\r\nsimply to send a few dozens of men, bringing Havelock’s effective number\r\nup to about 1400. With these he set about reorganising his little band\r\nduring the first three days of the month—counting each man as if he had\r\nbeen a gem above price. Every native had been got rid of; all his troops\r\nwere British; and therefore, few as they were, he felt entire reliance\r\non them. On the 4th he sent out his handful of volunteer cavalry to\r\nreconnoitre the Lucknow road, to see what had become of the enemy. The\r\ntroopers dashed through Onao without interruption; but on approaching\r\nBusherutgunje they saw ample evidence that the enemy were endeavouring\r\nto block up the line of communication, by occupying in force a series of\r\nhamlets between the town and the lake beyond it. The cavalry, having\r\nthus obtained news critically important to the general, galloped back\r\nthe same evening to Onao, where they were joined by Havelock and his\r\nforce from Mungulwar. After a night’s bivouac at Onao, the British\r\nmarched forth in early morn, and met their old enemy for a second time\r\nat Busherutgunje. Havelock, after a reconnaissance, resolved to deceive\r\nthe enemy by a show of cavalry in front, while he sent round guns and\r\ninfantry to turn their flanks. This manœuvre completely succeeded; the\r\nenemy were surprised, shelled out of the town, and pursued by the\r\nbayonet and the rifle through the whole of the hamlets to an open plain\r\nbeyond. They suffered much, but safely drew off all their guns except\r\ntwo. Though a victory for Havelock, shewing the high qualities of his\r\nmen, it was not one that cheered him much. The enemy were still between\r\nhim and Lucknow, and he would have to encounter them again and again,\r\nwith probably great reinforcements on their side, ere he could succeed\r\nin the object he had at heart. The morning of the 6th of August rose\r\ngloomily to him; for he was forced to a conclusion that an attack on\r\nLucknow was wholly beyond his force. He returned from Busherutgunje\r\nthrough Onao to his old quarters at Mungulwar; and when encamped there,\r\nwrote or telegraphed to the commander-in-chief that he must abandon his\r\nlong-cherished enterprise until strengthened. All his staff-officers\r\njoined in the opinion that to advance now to Lucknow would be ‘to court\r\nannihilation,’ and would, moreover, seal the doom of the heroic Inglis\r\nin that city—seeing that that officer could not possibly hold out\r\nwithout the hopeful expectation, sooner or later, of relief from\r\nCawnpore. ‘I will remain,’ added Havelock in his notification, ‘till the\r\nlast moment in this position (Mungulwar), strengthening it, and hourly\r\nimproving my bridge-communication with Cawnpore, in the hope that some\r\nerror of the enemy may enable me to strike a blow against them, and give\r\nthe garrison an opportunity of blowing up their works and cutting their\r\nway out.’ Havelock’s army now only just exceeded 1000 effective men—a\r\nnumber absurd to designate as an army, were it not for its brilliant\r\nachievements. Between Mungulwar and Lucknow it was known that there were\r\nthree strong posts, defended by 50 guns and 30,000 men. Every village on\r\nthe road, too (this being, in the turbulent province of Oude), was found\r\nto be occupied by zemindars deadly hostile to the British. Neill had\r\nonly 500 reliable troops at Cawnpore, of whom one-half were on the\r\nsick-list. Who can wonder, then, that even a Havelock shrank from an\r\nadvance to Lucknow at such a time?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Plan of action near Bithoor, August 16, 1857.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the evening of the 6th to the morning of the 11th was the small\r\noverworked column encamped at Mungulwar—fighting against cholera as a\r\nmore dreaded opponent than rebellious sepoys, and keeping a guarded\r\nwatch on the distrusted Oudians around. On the 11th, however, this\r\nsojourn was disturbed; and the British found themselves called upon to\r\nmeet the enemy for the third time at the town of Busherutgunje. Early in\r\nthe morning Havelock received information that 4000 rebels, with some\r\nguns, had advanced from Nawabgunge to that place. It did not suit his\r\nviews to have such a hostile force in position within a few hours’ march\r\nof him; he therefore put his column in motion. His advanced guard drove\r\nthe enemy’s parties out of Onao; but when he marched onward to the\r\nvicinity of Busherutgunje, he found the enemy far more numerous than he\r\nhad expected—spread out to a great distance right and left, and strongly\r\nintrenched in the centre. Havelock saw reasons for postponing his attack\r\ntill the following day. He returned to Onao, where his troops bivouacked\r\non the wet ground amid much discomfort, and after a very scanty supper.\r\nSuch men, however, were not likely to make the worst of their troubles;\r\nthey rose on the 12th, ready to vanquish the enemy in their usual style.\r\nIn the two former battles of Busherutgunje, the enemy had depended\r\nchiefly on defences in and behind the town; but in this instance they\r\nhad adopted the plan of intrenching the village of Boursekee Chowkee, in\r\nadvance of the town. Havelock was much retarded in bringing his battery\r\nand supporting troops across the deep and wide morasses which protected\r\nthe enemy’s front, during which operation the enemy’s shot and shell\r\ncaused him some loss; but when these obstacles were surmounted, and his\r\nartillery brought into play, the 78th Highlanders, without firing a\r\nshot, rushed with a cheer upon the principal redoubt, and captured two\r\nout of the three horse-battery guns with which it was armed. The enemy’s\r\nextreme left being also turned, they were soon in full retreat. But\r\nhere, as before, the victory was little more than a manifestation of\r\nBritish superiority in the field of battle; the enemy lost six to one of\r\nthe British, but still they remained on or near the Lucknow road. The\r\nbrigadier, just alike to his humble soldiers and to his\r\nbrother-officers, did not fail to mention the names of those who\r\nparticularly distinguished themselves. On one occasion it was his own\r\nson Lieutenant Havelock; on another it was Patrick Cavanagh the private;\r\nand now it was Lieutenant Crowe of the 78th Highlanders, who, on this\r\n12th of August, had been the first man to climb into the enemy’s redoubt\r\nat Boursekee Chowkee—an achievement which afterwards brought him the\r\nVictoria cross.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror for the third time retreated from Busherutgunje to\r\nMungulwar, of course a little weaker in men than in the morning.\r\nHavelock’s object, in this third retreat, was not merely to reach\r\nMungulwar, but to recross the Ganges to Cawnpore, there to wait for\r\nreinforcements before making another attempt to relieve Lucknow. The\r\nadvance of the 4000 rebels on the 11th had been mainly with the view of\r\ncutting off the little band of heroes during this embarkation; but the\r\nbattle of the 12th frustrated this; and by evening of the 13th the whole\r\nof the British had crossed the Ganges from the Oude bank to the Cawnpore\r\nbank, by a bridge of boats and a boat-equipage which Colonel Tytler and\r\nCaptain Crommelin had used indefatigable exertions to prepare.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that this retreat was regarded by the\r\ninsurgents as a concession to their superior strength, as an admission\r\nthat even a Havelock could not penetrate to Lucknow at that time; it\r\nelated them, and for the same reason it depressed the little band who\r\nhad achieved so much and suffered so severely. The general himself was\r\ndeeply grieved, for the prestige of the British name, but more\r\nimmediately for the safety of Brigadier Inglis and his companions. But\r\nthough grieved, he was too good a soldier to despond: he looked at his\r\ndifficulties manfully. Those difficulties were indeed great. While he\r\nwas fighting in Oude, bravely but vainly striving to advance to Lucknow,\r\nNena Sahib had been collecting a motley assemblage of troops near\r\nBithoor, for the purpose of re-establishing his power in that region. A\r\nwhole month had been available to him for this purpose, from the middle\r\nof July to the middle of August; and during this time there had been\r\nassembled the 31st and 42d native infantry from Saugor, the 17th from\r\nFyzabad, portions of the 34th disbanded at Barrackpore, troops of three\r\nmutinied cavalry regiments, and odds and ends of Mahrattas. The Nena had\r\nimitated Havelock in crossing into Oude, but had afterwards recrossed\r\ninto the Doab, with the evident intention of attacking Neill’s weak\r\nforce at Cawnpore. Bithoor he reoccupied without difficulty, for Neill\r\nhad no troops to station at that place, but now he planned an advance to\r\nCawnpore itself. As soon as Havelock had brought his column across the\r\nGanges on the 13th, the two generals concerted a plan; they resolved to\r\nrest the troops on the 14th, attack Nena Sahib’s left wing on the 15th,\r\nand march to Bithoor on the 16th. Neill, with a mere handful of men,\r\nwent out of his intrenchment, surprised the enemy’s left, and drove them\r\nwith precipitation from the vicinity of Cawnpore. This done, Havelock\r\nlaid his plan for a third visit to Bithoor on the 16th. He marched out\r\nwith about 1300 men—nearly all that he and Neill possessed between\r\nthem—and came up to the enemy about mid-day. They had established a\r\nposition in front of Bithoor, which Havelock characterised as one of the\r\nstrongest he had ever seen. They had two guns and an earthen redoubt in\r\nand near a plantation of sugar and castor-oil plants, intrenched\r\nquadrangles filled with troops, and two villages with loopholed houses\r\nand walls. Havelock, after surveying the position, sent his artillery\r\nalong the main road; consisting of Maude’s battery, which had already\r\nrendered such good service, and Olphert’s battery, recently forwarded\r\nfrom Allahabad under Lieutenant Smithett. While the guns proceeded along\r\nthe main road, the infantry advanced in two wings on the right and left.\r\nAfter a brief exchange of artillery-fire, the 78th Highlanders and the\r\nMadras Fusiliers advanced in that fearless way which struck such\r\nastonishment and panic into the mutineers; they captured and burned a\r\nvillage, then forced their way through a sugar-plantation, then took the\r\nredoubt, then captured two guns placed in a battery, and drove the\r\nrebels before them at every point. The battery, redoubt, quadrangles,\r\nvillages, and plantations having been thus conquered, the British\r\ncrossed a bridge over a narrow but unfordable stream, and pursued the\r\nenemy into and right through the town of Bithoor. Beyond this it was\r\nimpossible to pursue them, for Havelock had now scarcely a dozen\r\ntroopers, and his infantry were utterly exhausted by marching and\r\nfighting during a fiercely hot day. The 64th and 84th foot, with the\r\nFerozpore Sikhs, were disabled from taking a full share in the day’s\r\noperations, by a bend or branch of the unfordable stream which\r\nintercepted their intended line of march; the chief glory of the day\r\nrested with the 78th Highlanders and the Madras Fusiliers. Havelock, in\r\nhis dispatch relating to this battle, said: ‘I must do the mutineers the\r\njustice to pronounce that they fought obstinately; otherwise they could\r\nnot for a whole hour have held their own, even with such advantages of\r\nground, against my powerful artillery-fire.’ Worn out with fatigue, the\r\nBritish troops bivouacked that night near Bithoor; and on the 17th they\r\nreturned to Cawnpore. They had been fighting for six or seven weeks\r\nunder an Indian sun, almost from the day of their leaving Allahabad.\r\n‘Rest they must have,’ said Neill, in one of his pithy telegrams.\r\nCaptain Mackenzie, of the Highlanders, was among those who received\r\nwounds on this day.\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as terminating the Havelock campaign in the strict\r\nsense of the term; that is, the campaign in which he was undisputed\r\nchief. He was destined, before the hand of death struck him down, to\r\nfight again against the rebellious sepoys, but under curious relations\r\ntowards a brother-officer—relations strikingly honourable to both, as\r\nwill presently be explained. A wonderful campaign it must indeed be\r\ncalled. Between the 12th of July and the 17th of August, Havelock had\r\nfought and won three battles in the Doab east of Cawnpore, three in the\r\nvicinity of Cawnpore and Bithoor, and four in Oude—ten battles in\r\nthirty-seven days; and this against an enemy manifold superior in\r\nnumbers, and with an army which naturally became weaker by each battle,\r\nuntil at length its fighting power was almost extinguished.\r\n\r\nPrecarious, indeed, was the state to which Havelock’s little force was\r\nreduced. Shells, balls, bullets, sabres, heat, fatigue, and disease,\r\nlaid his poor fellows low; while his constant cry for reinforcements\r\nwas—not unheeded, certainly—but left unsatisfied. The cry was everywhere\r\nthe same—‘Send us troops;’ and the reply varied but little: ‘We have\r\nnone to send.’ On the 19th of August, he had 17 officers and 466 men\r\nsick at Cawnpore; while those who were not sick were so exhausted as to\r\nbe scarcely fit for active service. Havelock and Neill thirsted to\r\nencourage their handful of men by some brilliant achievement; but the\r\none essential would be the relief of Lucknow, and for this they were not\r\nstrong enough. The rebels, encouraged by this state of affairs,\r\nassembled in great force on the Oude side of the Ganges; they threatened\r\nto cross at Cawnpore, at a spot twelve miles lower down, and at\r\nFuttehpoor; while, on the other side, the Gwalior Contingent threatened\r\nthe small British force from Calpee. Havelock telegraphed to the\r\ncommander-in-chief: ‘I could bring into the field 8 good guns, but the\r\nenemy are reported to have 29 or 30; these are great odds, and my 900\r\nsoldiers may be opposed to 5000 organised troops. The loss of a battle\r\nwould ruin everything in this part of India.’ After deducting his sick\r\nand wounded, and two detachments to guard the cantonment and the road to\r\nit, he had only 700 men ready for the field—perhaps the smallest ‘army’\r\nthat modern warfare has exhibited. Every day the general became more\r\nearnest and urgent in the language of his telegrams; he was quite\r\nwilling to ‘fight anything, and at any odds;’ but his failure of victory\r\nwould be ruinous at such a critical time. There were 5000 Gwalior troops\r\nthreatening his rear on the Jumna; there were 20,000 Oudians watching\r\nhim from the other side of the Ganges; there were 12,000 of the enemy on\r\nhis left at Furruckabad; and to oppose these 37,000 armed and\r\ndisciplined soldiers, he had only 700 effective men! The contrast would\r\nhave been ridiculous, but for the moral grandeur which gave almost a\r\nsublimity to the devotedness of this little band. On the 21st, he\r\nannounced that unless reinforcements arrived soon, he would be compelled\r\nto abandon all his hopes and plans, and return to Allahabad, whence he\r\nhad started on his career of conquest seven weeks before. He\r\nendeavoured, meanwhile, to strengthen his position at Cawnpore, and to\r\nsend off sick and wounded to Allahabad, as a temporary relief.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to decide who was beset by most anxiety towards the\r\nclose of August—Havelock or Inglis. The former, after his vain attempt\r\nto reach Lucknow, wrote a note on the 4th which happily reached Inglis;\r\ntelling him of what had occurred, and adding, ‘You must aid us in every\r\nway, even to cutting your way out, if we can’t force our way in. We have\r\nonly a small force.’ This note reached Inglis on the 15th; he wrote a\r\nreply on the 16th, which—after the messenger had been exposed to seven\r\ndays of great peril—Havelock received on the 23d. This reply told how\r\nterrible was the position of the Lucknow garrison—120 sick and wounded;\r\n220 women, and 230 children; food and all necessaries scanty; disease\r\nand filth all about them; officers toiling like common labourers from\r\nmorning till night; soldiers and civilians nearly worn out with fatigue;\r\nenemy attacking every day, and forming mines to blow up the feeble\r\nintrenchments; and no means of carriage even if the garrison succeeded\r\nin quitting the place. The remaining days of the month were spent by\r\nHavelock inactively but hopefully. True, he was becoming almost invested\r\nby the rebels at Cawnpore, who saw that his handful of men could do\r\nlittle against them; but, on the other hand, telegraphic communication\r\nwas well kept up with Allahabad, Benares, and Calcutta. He learned that\r\nCanning, Campbell, and Outram were busily engaged in sending up every\r\npossible reinforcement to him; and he wrote again and again to Inglis,\r\nurging him to remain firm to the last, in the cheerful trust that aid\r\nwould come before the last act of despair—a surrender to the insurgents\r\nat Lucknow. There was mention of nearly 2000 men being either on their\r\nway or about to start from Calcutta, belonging to the 5th, 64th, 78th,\r\n84th, and 90th regiments, the Madras Fusiliers, and the artillery; and\r\nthere were confident hopes expressed of great service being rendered by\r\nthe Naval Brigade, 500 ‘blue jackets,’ under Captain Peel, who left\r\nCalcutta by steamer on the 20th. The governor-general knew that\r\nBrigadier Inglis had a quarter of a million sterling of government money\r\nunder his charge in the Residency of Lucknow; and he sent telegrams to\r\nHavelock and Neill, urging them, if possible, to convey instructions to\r\nInglis not to care about the money, but rather to use it in any way that\r\nmight best contribute to the liberation of his heroic and suffering\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nNew names now appear upon the scene—those of Outram and Campbell.\r\nMajor-general Sir James Outram, after successfully bringing the Persian\r\nwar to an end, had been appointed by the governor-general to the\r\nmilitary command of the Dinapoor and Cawnpore divisions; succeeding\r\nWheeler, who was killed at Cawnpore, and Lloyd, who had fallen into\r\ndisgrace at Dinapoor. This was a very important trust, seeing that it\r\nplaced under his control all the British officers engaged in the various\r\nstruggles at Lucknow, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Benares, Dinapoor, &c. He\r\narrived at Dinapoor to assume this command on the 18th of August, two\r\ndays after the date when Havelock had ended his series of ten battles.\r\nIt happened, too, that Sir Colin Campbell arrived in India about the\r\nsame time, to fill the office of commander-in-chief of all the armies of\r\nthe crown and the Company in India. For a period of two months, Sir\r\nPatrick Grant had superintended military matters, remaining in\r\nconsultation with Viscount Canning at Calcutta, and corresponding with\r\nthe generals in the various provinces and divisions. Now, however, Sir\r\nPatrick returned to his former post at Madras, and Sir Colin assumed\r\nmilitary command in his stead—remaining, like him, many weeks at\r\nCalcutta, where he could better organise an army than in the upper\r\nprovinces. Campbell and Outram, the one at Calcutta and the other at\r\nDinapoor, speedily settled by telegram that every possible exertion\r\nshould be made to send up reinforcements to Havelock and Neill at\r\nCawnpore; and that those gallant men should be encouraged to hold on,\r\nand not retreat from their important position. Outram had formed a plan\r\nentirely distinct from that in which Havelock was concerned—namely, to\r\nadvance from Benares direct to Lucknow _viâ_ Jounpoor, a route\r\naltogether northeast of the Ganges and the Doab; and to relieve\r\nBrigadier Inglis and the devoted garrison of that city. When, however,\r\nit became known that Inglis could not cut his way out of Lucknow without\r\npowerful assistance, and that Havelock himself was in danger at\r\nCawnpore, Sir Colin Campbell suggested to Sir James Outram a\r\nreconsideration of his plan; pointing out that an advance of a hundred\r\nand fifty miles from Benares to Lucknow, through a country mostly in the\r\nhands of the enemy, would under any circumstances be very perilous; and\r\nsubmitting that a march by Allahabad to Cawnpore might probably be\r\nbetter. The great problem in effect was—how could Outram best assist\r\nHavelock and Neill, and how could all three best liberate Inglis from\r\nhis difficulties? To solve this problem, the few remaining days of\r\nAugust, and the month of September, were looked forward to with anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe plan of operations once agreed upon, Sir James Outram engaged in it\r\nas quickly as possible. On the 1st of September, having made the\r\nnecessary military arrangements for the safety of the Dinapoor region,\r\nhe arrived at Allahabad, making a brief sojourn at Benares on his way.\r\nHe took with him 90 men of H.M. 90th foot—a small instalment of the\r\nforces with which he hoped to strengthen Havelock’s little band. Three\r\ndays afterwards, 600 men of the same regiment reached Allahabad by\r\nsteamers—a slow and sure way which the government was forced to adopt\r\nowing to the miserable deficiency in means of land-transport. No time\r\nwas lost in making these valuable troops available. Reckoning up the\r\nvarious fragments of regiments which had arrived at Allahabad since\r\nHavelock took his departure from that place two months before, Outram\r\nfound them to amount to something over 1700 men; he set off himself on\r\nthe 5th with a first column of 673 men; Major Simmonds started on the\r\nsame day with a second column of 674; about 90 more followed on the 6th;\r\nand 300 remained to guard Allahabad, and to form the nucleus for further\r\nreinforcements. On the 7th, Outram was at Hissa, progressing at a rate\r\nthat would probably carry him to Cawnpore by the 15th—all his men\r\neagerly hoping to have a brush with the ‘Pandies,’ and to aid in\r\naugmenting the gallant little band under Havelock.\r\n\r\nWhile Sir James was on his march, he received information that a party\r\nof insurgents from Oude were about to cross the Ganges into Doab, at a\r\nplace called Koondun Puttee, between Allahabad and Futtehpoor, and about\r\ntwenty miles from the last-named town. Seeing the importance of\r\nfrustrating this movement, he made arrangements accordingly. Being at\r\nThureedon on the 9th of September, he placed a small force under the\r\ncharge of Major Vincent Eyre, who had lately much distinguished himself\r\nat Arrah; consisting of 100 of H.M. 5th, and 50 of the 64th regiments,\r\nmounted on elephants, with two guns, tents, two days’ cooked provisions,\r\nand supplies for three days more. These troops, not sorry at being\r\nselected for such a novel enterprise, started off and reached Hutgong by\r\ndusk on the 10th, where they were joined by 40 troopers of the 12th\r\nIrregular Horse under Captain Johnson. Eyre, after resting his men, made\r\na moonlight march to Koondun Puttee, where he arrived at daybreak. The\r\nenemy, in surprise, rushed hastily to their boats, with a view of\r\nrecrossing the Ganges into Oude; but this escape was not allowed to\r\nthem. The sword, musket, rifle, and cannon brought them down in such\r\nnumbers that hardly any saw Oude again. The number of the enemy was\r\nabout 300; a number not large, but likely to prove very disastrous if\r\nthey had obtained command of the road between Allahabad and Cawnpore.\r\nHavelock evidently attached much importance to this service, for he said\r\nin his dispatch: ‘I now consider my communications secure, which\r\notherwise must have been entirely cut off during our operations in Oude;\r\nand a general insurrection, I am assured, would have followed throughout\r\nthe Doab had the enemy not been destroyed—they being but the\r\nadvanced-guard of more formidable invaders.’ This work achieved, the\r\ndifferent columns continued their march, until at length they safely\r\nreached Cawnpore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BRIGADIER-GENERAL NEILL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe three generals—Outram, Havelock, and Neill—met on the 15th of\r\nSeptember at Cawnpore, delighted at being able to reinforce each other\r\nfor the hard work yet to be done. And now came a manifestation of noble\r\nself-denial, a chivalrous sacrifice of mere personal inclination to a\r\nhigher sense of justice. Outram was higher in rank as a military\r\nofficer, and held a higher command in that part of India; he might have\r\nclaimed, and officially was entitled to claim, the command of the\r\nforthcoming expedition; but he, like others, had gloried in the deeds of\r\nHavelock, and was determined not to rob him of the honour of relieving\r\nLucknow. On the 16th, Sir James Outram issued an order,[61] in which,\r\namong other things, he announced that Havelock had been raised from\r\nbrigadier-general to major-general; that that noble soldier should have\r\nthe opportunity of finishing what he had so well begun; that Outram\r\nwould accompany him as chief-commissioner of Oude, and would fight under\r\nhim as a volunteer, without interfering with his command; and that\r\nHavelock should not be superseded in the command by Outram until the\r\nrelief of Lucknow should have been achieved. It was a worthy deed,\r\nmarking, as Havelock well expressed it, ‘characteristic generosity of\r\nfeeling;’ he announced it to his troops by an order on the same day, and\r\n‘expressed his hope that they would, by their exemplary and gallant\r\nconduct in the field, strive to justify the confidence thus reposed in\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\nThe two generals wished at once to ascertain from Calcutta what were the\r\nviews of Viscount Canning and Sir Colin Campbell concerning any ulterior\r\nproceedings at Lucknow. Outram sent a telegram to Canning to inquire\r\nwhether, if Lucknow were recaptured, it should be held at all hazards,\r\nas a matter of success and prestige. The governor-general at once sent\r\nback a reply: ‘Save the garrison; never mind our prestige just now,\r\nprovided you liberate Inglis; we will recover prestige afterwards. I\r\ncannot just now send you any more troops. Save the British in the\r\nResidency, and act afterwards as your strength will permit.’ The two\r\ngenerals proceeded to act on these instructions. Just two months had\r\nelapsed since Havelock had made his appearance at Cawnpore as a victor;\r\nand it was with great pain and anxiety that he had been forced to allow\r\nthose two months to pass away without sending one single soldier, one\r\nsingle ration of food, to the forlorn band who so wonderfully stood\r\ntheir ground in the Residency at Lucknow. Now, however, he looked\r\nforward with brighter hopes; Outram was with him, under relations most\r\nfriendly and honourable; and both generals were fully determined to\r\nsuffer any sacrifice rather than leave Inglis and his companions\r\nunrelieved.\r\n\r\nOutram himself planned the organisation of the new force for operations\r\nin Oude; but he placed Havelock at the head of it, and took care that\r\nNeill should have a share in the glory.[62] It consisted of two brigades\r\nof infantry, one of cavalry, one of artillery, and an engineer\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 19th of September that the two generals crossed with this\r\narmy into Oude, making use for that purpose of a bridge of boats over\r\nthe Ganges, most laboriously constructed by Captain Crommelin. The\r\nenemy, assembled near the banks, retired after a nominal resistance to\r\nMungulwar. The heavy guns and the baggage were crossed over on the 20th.\r\nOn the 21st the British again came up with the enemy, turned their right\r\nflank, drove them from their position, inflicted on them a severe loss,\r\nand captured four guns. With the heroism of a true soldier, Sir James\r\nOutram headed one of the charges that brought about this victory;\r\nserving as a volunteer under Havelock. The enemy were not permitted to\r\ndestroy the Bunnee bridge over the Sye; and thus the victors were\r\nenabled to pursue their route towards Lucknow. On the 23d, Havelock\r\nagain found himself in presence of the enemy, who had taken up a strong\r\nposition; their left posted in the enclosure of the Alum Bagh—a place\r\ndestined to world-wide notoriety—and their centre and right on low\r\nhills. Alum Bagh is so near Lucknow that firing in the city could be\r\ndistinctly heard; and Havelock therefore gave a volley with his largest\r\nguns, to tell the beleaguered garrison that aid was near. The British,\r\nin order to encounter the enemy, had to pass straight along the high\r\nroad between morasses, during which they suffered much from artillery;\r\nbut when once enabled to deploy to the right and left, they gradually\r\ngained an advantage, and added another to the list of their\r\nvictories—driving the enemy before them, but at the same time suffering\r\nseverely from the large numbers and the heavy firing of those to whom\r\nthey were opposed. They had been marching three days under a perfect\r\ndeluge of rain, irregularly fed, and badly housed in villages. Havelock\r\ndetermined, therefore, to pitch camp, and to give his exhausted troops\r\none whole day’s rest on the 24th.\r\n\r\nAt last came the eventful day, the 25th of September, when the\r\nbeleaguered garrison at Lucknow were to experience the joy of seeing\r\nthose whose arrival had been yearned for during so long and anxious a\r\nperiod. Early on that morning, after depositing his baggage and tents\r\nunder an escort in the Alum Bagh, Havelock pursued his march. The 1st\r\nbrigade, with Outram attached to it as a volunteer, drove the enemy from\r\na succession of gardens and walled enclosures; while the other brigades\r\nsupported it. From the bridge of the Char Bagh over the canal, to the\r\nResidency at Lucknow, was a distance in a straight line of about two\r\nmiles; and this interval was cut by trenches, crossed by palisades, and\r\nintersected by loopholed houses. Progress in this direction being so\r\nmuch obstructed, Havelock resolved to deploy along a narrow road that\r\nskirted the left bank of the canal. On they went, until they came\r\nopposite the palace of Kaiser or Kissurah Bagh, where two guns and a\r\nbody of insurgents were placed; and here the fire poured out on them was\r\nso tremendous that, to use the words of the general, ‘nothing could live\r\nunder it;’ his troops had to pass a bridge partly under the influence of\r\nthis fire; but immediately afterwards they received the shelter of\r\nbuildings adjacent to the palace of Fureed Buksh. Darkness now coming\r\non, it was at one time proposed that the force should halt for the night\r\nin and near the court of this palace; but Havelock could not bear the\r\nidea of leaving the Residency for another night in the hands of the\r\nenemy; he therefore ordered his trusty Highlanders, and little less\r\ntrusty Sikhs, to take the lead in the tremendous ordeal of a\r\nstreet-fight through the large city of Lucknow. It was a desperate\r\nstruggle, but it was for a great purpose—and it succeeded. On that\r\nnight, within the British Residency, Havelock and Outram clasped hands\r\nwith Inglis, and listened to the outpourings of full hearts all around\r\nthem. The sick and the wounded, the broken-down and the emaciated, the\r\nmilitary and the civilians, the officers and the soldiers, the women and\r\nthe children—all within the Residency had passed a day of agonised\r\nsuspense, unable to help in their own deliverance; but when at length\r\nHavelock’s advanced column could be seen in a street visible from the\r\nbuildings of the Residency—then broke forth such a cheer as none can\r\nknow but those placed in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen General Havelock penned a hasty dispatch narrating the events of\r\nthis day, he said: ‘To form a notion of the obstacles overcome, a\r\nreference must be made to the events that are known to have occurred at\r\nBuenos Ayres and Saragossa. Our advance was through streets of\r\nflat-roofed and loopholed houses, each forming a separate fortress. I am\r\nfilled with surprise at the success of operations which demanded the\r\nefforts of 10,000 good troops.’ The advantage cost him dearly. Sir James\r\nOutram received a flesh-wound in the arm early in the day, but nothing\r\ncould subdue his spirit; though faint from loss of blood, he continued\r\ntill the end of the operations to sit on his horse, from which he only\r\ndismounted at the gate of the Residency. Greatest loss of all was that\r\nof the gallant and energetic Brigadier-general Neill, who from the 3d of\r\nJune to the 25th of September had been almost incessantly engaged in\r\nconflicts with the enemy, in and between the cities of Benares,\r\nAllahabad, Cawnpore, and Lucknow. He fell, to fight no more. From the\r\ntime when he left his native home in Ayrshire, a stripling sixteen years\r\nof age, he had passed thirty years of his life in service, and had been\r\na trusty and trusted officer.[63] But although the loss of Neill was the\r\nmost deplored, on account of the peculiar services which he had\r\nrendered, Havelock had to lament the melancholy list of gallant officers\r\nwho had equally desired to shew themselves as true soldiers on this\r\nday.[64] No less than ten officers were either killed or wounded in the\r\n78th Highlanders alone—shewing how terrible must have been the work in\r\nwhich that heroic regiment led. The whole list of casualties comprised\r\n119 officers and men killed, 339 wounded, and 77 missing. Of these last\r\nHavelock said: ‘I much fear that, some or all, they have fallen into the\r\nhands of a merciless foe.’ Thus was the force reduced by more than five\r\nhundred men in one day.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of this day, the 25th of September, Major-general\r\nHavelock, within the Residency at Lucknow, gave back to Sir James Outram\r\nthe charge which had so generously been intrusted to him. He became\r\nsecond in command to one who had all day fought chivalrously under him\r\nas a volunteer. Here, then, this chapter may end. It was the last day of\r\nHavelock’s campaign as an independent commander. What else he did before\r\ndisease ended his valuable life; what the Lucknow garrison had effected\r\nto maintain their perilous position during so many weary weeks; what\r\nwere the circumstances that rendered necessary many more weeks of\r\ndetention in the Residency; by whom and at what time they were really\r\nand finally relieved—are subjects that will engage our attention in\r\nfuture pages.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  It may be useful to note, for readers unfamiliar with military\r\n  matters, the meaning of the words _brevet_ and _brigadier_. A brevet\r\n  is a commission, conferring on an officer a degree of rank _next\r\n  above_ that which he holds in his particular regiment; without,\r\n  however, conveying the power of receiving the corresponding pay.\r\n  Besides being honorary as a mark of distinction, it qualifies the\r\n  officer to succeed to the full possession of the higher rank on a\r\n  vacancy occurring, in preference to one not holding a brevet. In the\r\n  British army brevet rank only applies to captains, majors, and\r\n  lieutenant-colonels. A _brigadier_ is a colonel or other officer of a\r\n  regiment who is made temporarily a general officer for a special\r\n  service, in command of a brigade, or more than one regiment. It is not\r\n  a permanent rank, but is considered as a stepping-stone to the office\r\n  of major-general. Many Indian officers who were colonels when the\r\n  Indian mutiny began, such as Henry Lawrence and Neill, were appointed\r\n  brigadier-generals for a special service, and rose to higher rank\r\n  before the mutiny was ended.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Chapter ix., pp. 159-161.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n             _British Troops_:\r\n    H.M. 64th foot (from Persia),         435 men; Major Stirling.\r\n    H.M. 78th Highlanders (from Persia),  284 men; Col.

This military station is in the midst of\r\nthe thickly populated province of Behar, between Bengal and Oude; a\r\nprovince rich in opium, rice, and indigo plantations, and inhabited\r\nchiefly by a class of Hindoos less warlike than those towards the west.\r\nThe Dinapoor mutiny was the one great event in the eastern half of\r\nNorthern India during July and August; and on this account it may\r\nconveniently be treated as the central nucleus around which all the\r\nminor events grouped themselves. In the regions surrounding the lower\r\ncourse of the Ganges, and its branch the Hoogly, the disturbances were\r\nof minor character; but along both sides of the great trunk-road there\r\nwas much more agitation, especially after the mutiny at the station\r\nabove named. Nevertheless, it will be desirable to take a bird’s-eye\r\nglance at Bengal and Behar generally in this chapter, in relation to the\r\nevents of July and August—keeping steadily in mind the 25th of July, as\r\nthe day on which the occurrences at Dinapoor agitated all the natives,\r\nparalysed many of the Europeans, and led to a train of truly remarkable\r\nproceedings in and near the town of Arrah.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, for Calcutta, the Anglo-Indian capital. This city was not\r\nafflicted by a mutiny, in the usual meaning of the term, at any time\r\nduring the year. Many reasons might be assigned for this exemption.\r\nThere were on all occasions more Europeans at Calcutta than in any other\r\ncity in India, who could have presented a formidable defence-corps if\r\nthey chose to combine for that purpose. There was the majesty of a\r\nvice-regal court at Calcutta, not without its effect on the\r\nimpressionable minds of Asiatics. There were the head-quarters of all\r\nauthority in the city, insuring the promptest measures if exigency\r\nshould demand them. And lastly, Calcutta being the landing-place for\r\nmost of the English troops, rebel sepoys could never hope for much\r\nchance of success in that capital. Mutiny there was not, but panic\r\nunquestionably appeared—panic among the Europeans who did not belong to\r\nthe Company’s service, and whose imaginations were excited by the\r\nterrible narratives brought in from the northwest, and highly coloured\r\nduring their transmission. It was an unfortunate circumstance that many\r\nof these persons were hostile to the government of Viscount Canning; and\r\nthis hostility was especially displayed by those connected with the\r\npress, on account of the restrictions already adverted to. Whatever may\r\nbe the varieties of opinion on the matters at issue, it is\r\nunquestionable that difficulties were thrown in the way of the executive\r\nby this want of accord. India has for a long period been rich in\r\ncoteries and parties. Among military men, the Queen’s officers and the\r\nCompany’s officers have had a little emulative pique; among non-military\r\nmen, there has been an envy by the non-officials of the civil servants\r\nof the Company; and the military and the civilians have had their own\r\ngrounds for antagonism. Calcutta, above all other places, has been\r\nmarked by these sources of discord.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of July the government deemed it prudent to ascertain\r\nwhat was the state of affairs in Calcutta with reference to the\r\npossession, sale, or concealment of arms. The Europeans in the city, in\r\na state of perpetual alarm, kept up by unauthenticated paragraphs in the\r\nnewspapers, had indulged a belief that the natives had lately made large\r\npurchases of arms, as if plotting mischief. Especially was this\r\nsuspicion entertained when news arrived from Havelock and Neill that all\r\nthe Europeans at Cawnpore had been murdered; almost wild with\r\nexcitement, rage, and terror, the Calcutta community set no bounds to\r\ntheir apprehensions; they would fain have shot all the natives around\r\nthem, in vague dread of some diabolical plot. Mr Wauchope, commissioner\r\nof police, was ordered to make strict inquiry concerning the possession\r\nof arms. He found that the sale of weapons had been very large during\r\nthree mouths, but that nearly all the purchases had been made by\r\nEuropeans, and that hardly a house in Calcutta, inhabited by Christians,\r\nwas without one or more muskets or pistols. Many arms also had been\r\npurchased in Calcutta, and taken into the provinces for the use of\r\nindigo-planters, zemindars, and others, who naturally wished to have\r\nnear them a few weapons at such a turbulent period. Of any considerable\r\npurchases of arms by the native population of Calcutta there was no\r\nproof, and the superintendent disbelieved the rumour. This was the third\r\ntime in two months that the Anglo-Indian capital had been thrown into a\r\nparoxysm of terror on this subject; and although the panic was shewn to\r\nbe groundless, the authorities nevertheless believed it to be expedient\r\nto cause all firearms in the city to be registered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAJOR VINCENT EYRE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo small part of the agitation at Calcutta arose from the shackles on\r\nthe press, already adverted to. Men of extreme opinions, and men of\r\nexcited feelings, longing to pour out their thoughts on paper, found\r\nthemselves less able so to do than in times gone by; there was the\r\nseizure of their printing apparatus, the infliction of a heavy fine,\r\nconfronting them, and checking the movement of their pens. Sufficient\r\ntranspired, however, to render manifest these two facts—that the\r\nEuropean community at Calcutta violently hated the natives generally,\r\nand violently opposed Viscount Canning personally. There was a very\r\ngeneral acquiescence in some such code of rules as the following, for\r\ndealing with the natives—that every mutineer who had taken up arms or\r\nquitted his ranks should be put to death; that every native, not a\r\nsoldier, who aided the mutineers, should in like manner be put to death;\r\nthat in every village in which a European had been murdered, a telegraph\r\nwire cut, or a dâk stolen, a swift tribunal should exercise summary\r\njustice; that every village in which a European fugitive had been\r\ninsulted or refused aid should be heavily fined; and that vengeance,\r\nburning vengeance, was the only adequate measure to deal out to all who\r\nhad offended. The distressing tales brought by the fugitives had much\r\neffect in keeping up the feeling denoted by such suggestions as these.\r\nIt was under the influence of the same disturbed state of the public\r\nmind, that an address or petition was got up, condemnatory alike of\r\nViscount Canning and of the East India Company; it was intended to work\r\na considerable effect in England; but the obviously one-sided line of\r\nargument vitiated its force and damaged its reception.\r\n\r\nAs the month of July advanced, and fugitives came in from the disturbed\r\nprovinces, arrangements were made for accommodating them at Calcutta,\r\nand—as we have seen—for alleviating their wants. It became also a point\r\nof much importance to provide barracks or temporary homes of some kind\r\nfor the troops expected to arrive by sea from various regions. Among\r\nbuildings set apart for this latter purpose were the Town Hall, the Free\r\nSchool, the Pleaders’ Chambers in the Sudder Court, and the Lower Orphan\r\nSchool at Kidderpore. Many months would necessarily elapse before troops\r\nin large numbers could arrive; but even a single regiment would require\r\nconsiderable space to house it before it could be sent up the country.\r\nIn what way, during July and August, the English troops were sent to the\r\nseats of disturbance, has already been sufficiently noticed; some were\r\ndespatched by steamers up the Ganges to Patna, Benares, and Allahabad;\r\nwhile the rest mostly went from Calcutta to Raneegunge by railway, and\r\nthence pursued their land-journey by any vehicles obtainable.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked, that when Sir Colin Campbell arrived at\r\nCalcutta, an immense amount of labour presented itself to his notice.\r\nBefore he could decide whether to advance northwest to the seat of war,\r\nor to remain at the capital, he had carefully to examine the military\r\ncondition of India. The records of the war department were at Simla,\r\nwhile the centre of authority was at Calcutta. The principal officers\r\nwere scattered throughout the disturbed districts; the desultory and\r\nisolated struggles had relaxed the bond of military obedience; the\r\nreinforcements as they arrived had to be fitted into their places; the\r\ndetached forces had to be brought into subordination to some general\r\nplan; and the different branches of the service had to be brought into\r\nharmony one with another. Hence Calcutta was for several weeks the\r\nhead-quarters of the veteran commander-in-chief, while these\r\nall-important details of military organisation were in progress.\r\n\r\nIn the wide belt of country forming the eastern margin of India, from\r\nthe Himalaya in the north to Pegu in the south, there was no mutiny\r\nproperly so called during July and August. All the disturbances were\r\nlimited to threatening symptoms which, if not attended to, might have\r\nproved dangerous. The nature of these symptoms may be illustrated by a\r\nfew examples. At Jelpigoree, early in July, two men were detected\r\ntampering with the sepoys of the 73d N. I.; and a trooper of the 11th\r\nirregular cavalry was found guilty of insubordination. At Dinagepore the\r\nmoulvies or Mussulman religious teachers began to spread seditious\r\nrumours. At Jessore, similar Mussulman tendencies were manifested. In\r\nthe third week of July tranquillity prevailed throughout the divisions\r\nof Aracan, Chittagong, Dacca, Assam, and Darjeeling, comprising the belt\r\nabove adverted to; and if agitation were more observable towards the\r\nclose of the month, it was traceable to news of the Dinapoor mutiny,\r\npresently to be noticed. Early in August the Jelpigoree native troops\r\nwere found to be in a very unsettled state, ready to mutiny at any time;\r\nand on the 15th a plot was discovered for murdering the officers and\r\ndecamping towards the west. In consequence of this, orders were sent to\r\nAssam and Darjeeling to aid the Jelpigoree officers in case of need.\r\nDuring the remainder of August, a close watch was kept on the 73d N. I.,\r\nthe chief native regiment in that part of India, sufficient to prevent\r\nactual outbreaks; and native servants were disarmed during the Mohurrum\r\nor Mohammedan festival, to guard against the effects of fanaticism.\r\nPerhaps, however, the tranquillity of this eastern belt was more\r\nefficiently secured by the near neighbourhood of half-civilised border\r\ntribes, who had but little sympathy with the real Hindustanis, and were\r\nwilling to enter into the Company’s service as irregular troops and\r\narmed police.\r\n\r\nPassing westward, to the line of route along the Hoogly to the Ganges,\r\nand the country near it, we find traces of a little more turbulency,\r\nowing to the presence of a greater number of native troops. About the\r\nmiddle of July, the Barrackpore authorities asked for permission to\r\ndisarm the villages near at hand, in order to render more effectual the\r\nprevious disarming of native troops at Barrackpore itself—treated in a\r\nformer chapter. Early in August the behaviour of the troops at\r\nBerhampore became suspicious; they had heard of the mutiny of the 8th N.\r\nI. at places further west, and were with difficulty kept from imitating\r\nthe pernicious example. In the middle of the month, the commissioner of\r\nBhagulpore deemed it necessary to detain two detachments of H.M. 5th\r\nFusiliers, on their way up the Ganges, at Bhagulpore and Monghir; for\r\nthe 32d native infantry, and the 5th irregular cavalry, exhibited\r\nsymptoms not to be neglected. After the occurrences at Dinapoor, the\r\nregion around Berhampore and Moorshedabad could no longer be kept in\r\npeace while the native troops retained their arms; it was determined\r\ntherefore, by Mr Spencer the commissioner, and Colonel Macgregor the\r\ncommandant, to adopt decisive measures while there was yet time. On the\r\n1st of August, having the aid of H.M. 90th foot, they disarmed the 63d\r\nnative infantry and the 11th irregular cavalry at Berhampore; and on the\r\nfollowing day they similarly disarmed all the inhabitants of that place\r\nand of Moorshedabad. Colonel Campbell, of the 90th, who had brought that\r\nregiment from England in splendid condition in the _Himalaya_ steamer,\r\nand who was on his way up the Ganges to the disturbed districts, was the\r\nofficer who practically effected this disarming at Berhampore; he spoke\r\nof the 11th irregular cavalry as one of the most superb regiments he had\r\never seen, in men, horses, and equipments; they were rendered almost\r\nsavage by the skill with which the colonel managed his delicate task;\r\nand they reproached the sepoys of the 63d for having submitted so\r\nquietly to the disarming. A little further up the country, at\r\nBhagulpore, about 200 troopers of the 5th irregular cavalry mutinied on\r\nthe 14th of August, taking the road towards Bowsee, but harming none of\r\ntheir officers; on the 15th they passed through Bowsee to Rownee; and on\r\nthe 18th left Rownee for Gayah—bound for the disturbed regions in the\r\nwest. At Monghir, still higher up the Ganges, a terrible commotion was\r\nproduced by this occurrence; the civil commissioner shut himself up in a\r\nfort, with a few of H.M. 5th Fusiliers, and left the city to its fate;\r\nbut fortunately Sir James Outram was at the time passing up the Ganges\r\nin a steamer; he rebuked this pusillanimity, and recommended the\r\nofficials to shew a bolder front.\r\n\r\nArriving now at the Patna and Dinapoor district, we must trace the\r\nprogress of affairs more in detail, to shew how the authorities were\r\nplaced before, and how after, the mutiny which it is the chief object of\r\nthis chapter to narrate. Patna is a large and important city, the centre\r\nof an industrious region; while Dinapoor, in the immediate vicinity, is\r\nthe largest military station between Barrackpore and Allahabad. Mr\r\nTayler, civil commissioner, was the chief authority at the one place;\r\nMajor-general Lloyd was military commandant at the other; and it was\r\nessentially necessary, for the preservation of peace in all that region,\r\nthat these two officials should act in harmony. We have already seen\r\n(pp. 151-154) that, about the middle of June, the Patna district became\r\nmuch agitated by the news of disturbances in other quarters; that the\r\npolice force was thereupon strengthened, and the ghats or landing-places\r\nwatched; that some of the Company’s treasure was removed to other\r\nstations; that places of rendezvous were agreed upon in case of\r\nemergency; that conspiracies among the Moslem inhabitants were more than\r\nonce discovered, in concert with other conspirators at Lucknow and\r\nCawnpore; and that on the 3d of July some of the fanatics murdered Dr\r\nLyell, principal assistant to the opium agent. We have also seen, in the\r\nsame chapter, that Dinapoor reposed upon a sort of moral volcano\r\nthroughout June; that although the native troops made loud professions\r\nof loyalty, the Europeans were nevertheless in a very anxious\r\nposition—all living near together, all on the alert, and most of them\r\nbelieving that the fidelity of the sepoys was not worth many days’\r\npurchase. Being thus on their guard, a mutiny ought not to have occurred\r\nat their station; but it _did_ occur, and brought disgrace to the\r\ngeneral who was responsible for military affairs in that division.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent clue to this whole series of transactions will be\r\nobtained by tracing—first, the Dinapoor mutiny itself; then the mingled\r\ndisasters and successes, blunders and heroism, at Arrah; then the effect\r\nof the mutiny on the districts of Behar north of the Ganges; and,\r\nlastly, the effects on the wide-spreading region south of that river.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the two cities is about ten miles. The barracks of\r\nthe European troops at Dinapoor were situated in a large square westward\r\nof the native town; beyond this were the native lines; and most western\r\nof all, by a very injudicious arrangement, was the magazine in which the\r\npercussion-caps were stored—a matter apparently small in itself, but\r\nserious in its consequences, as we shall presently see. Major-general\r\nLloyd, commander of the station, and of a vast military region called\r\nthe Dinapoor Division, had for some weeks been an object of almost as\r\nmuch anxiety to the Europeans at the station as the sepoys themselves.\r\nHe was advanced in years, infirm, and irresolute. Unable to mount his\r\nhorse without assistance, and dreading to give orders that would have\r\nthe effect of sending any European troops away from Dinapoor, he was\r\nsingularly unfitted to cope with the difficulties of those times. It\r\npoints to some great defect in military routine, when one who had been a\r\ngallant officer in his better days was thus left in possession of a\r\ncommand he was no longer fitted to wield. Towards the close of July\r\nthere were three regiments of Bengal native infantry at that station,\r\nthe 7th, 8th, and 40th. There was also the greater portion of H.M. 10th\r\nfoot, together with two companies of the 37th, and two troops of\r\nartillery. Not a British officer, except the major-general, doubted that\r\nthese Europeans could have disarmed and controlled the sepoys, had the\r\nattempt been made at the proper time. The Calcutta inhabitants had\r\npetitioned the governor-general to disarm the native regiments at\r\nDinapoor, and the officers of the Queen’s regiments at that station had\r\nall along advocated a similar measure; but General Lloyd, like many\r\nother Company’s officers, was proud of the sepoys, and trusted them to\r\nthe last; and Viscount Canning placed reliance on his experience, to\r\ndetermine whether and when to effect this disarming. This reliance ended\r\nin unfortunate results.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, the appearance of affairs led the major-general to\r\nexhibit less than his former confidence in the native troops; he shrank,\r\nit is true, from disarming them; but he sought to render their arms less\r\ndangerous by quietly removing the percussion-caps from the magazine. Now\r\nthese caps had to be brought in front of the whole length of the sepoy\r\nlines on the way from the magazine to the English barracks. Early in the\r\nmorning he sent the 10th and the artillery to the grand square, ready to\r\nbe moved towards the sepoy lines if disturbance should occur. Two\r\nhackeries went down to the magazine under charge of an officer; the caps\r\nwere placed in them; and the vehicles were drawn some distance towards\r\nthe English lines. There then arose a shout among the sepoys: ‘Kill the\r\nsahibs; don’t let the caps be taken away!’ The caps were taken, however,\r\nand safely conveyed to the officers’ mess-room. The 10th were kept idle\r\nin the square or in barracks all the forenoon; while the native officers\r\nwere ordered to go to the native lines, and ask the sepoys to give up\r\nthe caps already issued to them. Some of the sepoys obeyed this strange\r\ndemand—strange, because backed by no display of power; while some fired\r\ntheir muskets and threatened to shoot the officers. At the sound of\r\nthese shots the 10th were ordered hastily to advance; they did so, but\r\nonly to see the rebel sepoys run off as fast as their legs could carry\r\nthem. Inexpressible was the mortification of the officers at this sight;\r\nthree entire regiments escaped across fields, with their arms and\r\naccoutrements, to swell the ranks of the mutineers elsewhere; and so\r\nstupid had been the orders given, that there was no force at hand to\r\nstop them. The 10th, two companies of the 37th, and the artillery, all\r\nwere burning to castigate these men; yet was the escape so quickly and\r\ncompletely effected that very few of the sepoys fell. The English\r\ndestroyed the sepoy lines, but did not pursue the mutineers, for their\r\nperplexed commander would not permit them to leave him in danger. A\r\nsurgeon of the 10th, on seeing the officers threatened by the sepoys,\r\nbrought his hospital-guards to confront them; and even some of his\r\npatients got upon the flat roof of the hospital, and fired at the\r\nrebels. He then galloped off, and brought all the ladies and children to\r\nthe barracks for safety. Every man of the 10th regiment was vexed and\r\nirritated by this day’s work; complaints against the general were loud,\r\ndeep, and many; and all the officers’ letters told plainly of the\r\ngeneral feeling among them. The regiment numbered little more than four\r\nhundred bayonets; for many men were sick in hospital, and a detachment\r\nwas at Benares; but the four hundred, highly disciplined men, would not\r\nhave hesitated an instant to disarm, to fight, to pursue, the three\r\nthousand rebels, had they been properly instructed and permitted so to\r\ndo. During eight or ten weeks the officers of that regiment had urged\r\nthe disarming of the sepoys; but their recommendations had not been\r\nlistened to, and now it was too late. The general himself, on the\r\nforenoon of the 25th, went on board a steamer in the Ganges: ‘I had no\r\nhorse in cantonment,’ he said. ‘My stable was two miles distant; and\r\nbeing unable at the time to walk far or much, I thought I should be most\r\nuseful on board the steamer with guns and riflemen.’ It is deeply to be\r\nregretted that an old soldier should have been so placed as to find such\r\nan explanation necessary. As a consequence of this retreat to a place of\r\nshelter, the officers remained without commands and without a commander.\r\nSome of the mutineers embarked in boats, with the intention of going\r\ndown the Ganges to Patna, or of crossing the river; but the detachment\r\nof the 37th, on shore and in the steamer, killed most of them by\r\nrifle-shots. The steamer did its work, unquestionably; but it was not\r\nthe place for a military commander at such a time.\r\n\r\nThe question at once presented itself to the minds of all—whither had\r\nthe rebels gone? Evidence was soon afforded that the direction taken was\r\nthat of Arrah, a town twenty-four miles from Dinapoor, and separated\r\nfrom it by the river Sone. Arrah, as a town, was not of great\r\nimportance; but it was the chief place in the district of Shahabad, and\r\nwas surrounded by a country whence much revenue was obtained by the East\r\nIndia Company. During the troubles arising out of the mutiny, the chief\r\nauthority at Arrah was the magistrate, Mr Wake—a man who, by his energy\r\nand public spirit, proved to be eminently fitted to hold power in\r\nperilous times. During the whole of June and July he had watched the\r\nprogress of events with an anxious eye. Very soon after the mutiny\r\ncommenced, he wrote to the authorities at Calcutta, describing the\r\ncontents of certain native newspapers published about that time, and\r\nsuggesting the propriety of curbing the licence of those productions. On\r\nthe 10th of June he announced—with something like contempt in his\r\nmanner—that most of the Europeans employed on the railway-works near\r\nArrah had hurried away frightened by reports of mutinous symptoms at\r\nGhazeepore and Buxar; and he dwelt on the pernicious effects of the\r\nexample afforded by this timidity. About a week afterwards he induced\r\nthem all to return. From time to time he applied to Dinapoor, Patna, and\r\nCalcutta, for a small detachment of troops to protect Arrah; but none\r\ncould be afforded. He suspected some of the chieftains and zemindars\r\nnear at hand, and more than suspected numerous disbanded sepoys who were\r\nseen in the district; to detect plots, he detained and opened letters at\r\nthe post-office; but this course met with disapproval, as commencing a\r\nsystem liable to great abuse. There were two influential men in the\r\nneighbourhood—Baboo Koer Singh, and the Rajah of Doomraon—whose conduct\r\nMr Wake scrutinised very closely; they professed friendship and loyalty\r\nto the government, but he doubted them. On the 11th of July, Arrah had\r\nbecome surrounded by so many disbanded sepoys, and natives ready for any\r\nmischief, that he applied to Patna for a party of Captain Rattray’s Sikh\r\npolice, which was furnished to him.\r\n\r\nThus matters proceeded until the 25th of July, when rumours of something\r\ndisastrous at Dinapoor arrived. Arrah was now about to become suddenly\r\nfamous. The ‘Defence of Arrah’ was to be narrated in dispatches and\r\nletters, in pamphlets and books, and was to cheer up many who had been\r\nhumiliated by blunders committed elsewhere. True, it was only a house\r\ndefended, not a town; it was less than a score of Europeans saved, not a\r\nwhole community; yet did it bring well-deserved praise to those\r\nconcerned in it, and encouragement to a spirited line of conduct on the\r\npart of the Company’s civil servants elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr Boyle’s house at Arrah, defended for seven days against 3000\r\n    rebels.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day just named, Mr Wake received express news that\r\nthe native troops at Dinapoor had actually mutinied, or shewed symptoms\r\nof so doing within a few hours. On the morning of the 26th, he heard\r\nthat some of the mutineers were crossing the river Sone, at a point\r\nsixteen miles from Dinapoor, and advancing upon Arrah. His Hindustani\r\nlocal police speedily ran away; but he and a trusty band of civilians\r\nresolved to remain at their posts. They selected the bungalow of one of\r\ntheir number, Mr Boyle, an engineer of the main trunk railway, and made\r\nthat their fortress. Or, more correctly, it was a building which Mr\r\nBoyle had selected for some such purpose as this many days or even weeks\r\nbefore, when the state of affairs began to look gloomy; it was a\r\ndetached two-storied house, about fifty feet square, standing within the\r\nsame compound as the bungalow inhabited by Mr Boyle; he fortified it\r\nwith stones and timber, and always kept some provisions in it. When the\r\nother civilians learned this, some of them smiled; but the smile became\r\none of gratitude on the 26th of July. The Europeans who now took up\r\ntheir abode in this fortified house were Messrs Wake, Boyle, Littledale,\r\nCombe, Colvin, Halls, Field, Anderson, Godfrey, Cock, Tait, Hoyle,\r\nDelpeiron, De Songa, and Dacosta; and a Mohammedan deputy-collector,\r\nSyud Azimoodeen—all employed in various civil duties in or near Arrah:\r\nnot a military man among them. With them were 50 Sikhs of Captain\r\nRattray’s police battalion. The ladies and children had been sent away\r\nto a place of safety. All that the defenders could bring into the house\r\nwas meat and grain for a few days’ short allowance for the Europeans,\r\nwith a very scanty supply of food for the Sikhs. As to weapons, most of\r\nthe Europeans, besides revolvers and hog-spears, had two\r\ndouble-barrelled guns each, or a gun and a rifle; they had abundance of\r\nammunition, and wherewithal to make cartridges by thousands. Early in\r\nthe morning of the 27th, nearly the whole of the Dinapoor mutineers\r\nmarched into Arrah, released the prisoners in the jail, about four\r\nhundred in number, rushed to the collectorate, and looted the treasury\r\nof eighty thousand rupees. They then advanced to Boyle’s house, and kept\r\nup a galling fire against it during the whole day, finding shelter\r\nbehind trees and adjacent buildings. And now did Baboo Koer Singh shew\r\nhimself in his true colours; he threw off the mask of friendliness, and\r\nboldly headed the mutineers. It was afterwards ascertained that this\r\nman, supposed to be in league with Nena Sahib, had openly become a rebel\r\ninstantly on hearing of the mutiny at Dinapoor: it was he who had\r\nprocured the boats in which they crossed the Sone; and he formed a plan\r\nfor joining the Oude insurgents after plundering the treasury of Arrah.\r\nWhen in front of Mr Boyle’s house, Koer Singh and his myrmidons\r\nendeavoured to bribe the Sikhs to desert; but these stanch fellows\r\nremained true to their salt. On the 28th the insurgents having brought\r\ntwo small cannon, the hastily defended house had then to bear a torrent\r\nof cannon-balls as well as of musket-bullets. Thus the siege continued\r\nday after day. The rebels even dragged one of the cannon up to the roof\r\nof Mr Boyle’s bungalow, about sixty yards off, whence they could fire\r\ninto the defended house. ‘Nothing,’ said Mr Wake in his dispatch, ‘but\r\nthe cowardice, ignorance, and want of unanimity of our enemies,\r\nprevented our fortification from being brought down about our ears.’ As\r\nfast as the strength of the attack was increased, so fast did the\r\ngarrison increase their defences; to oppose a new battery, a new\r\nbarricade was raised; to defeat a mine, a countermine was run out. The\r\nSikhs worked untiringly, and seemed to glory in the gallant defence they\r\nwere making. When provisions began to run low, they made a sally one\r\nnight, and brought in four sheep—a precious treasure to them at such a\r\ntime. Seven whole days and nights did this continue—three thousand men\r\nbesieging seventy. On the last two days the cowards offered ‘terms,’\r\nwhich were contemptuously rejected. On the 2d of August the mutineers\r\nmarched off to the west of Arrah to fight Major Vincent Eyre; how they\r\nfared, we shall see presently; but the battle brought about the\r\nliberation of Mr Wake and his companions. Wonderful to relate, only one\r\nmember of the garrison, a Sikh policeman, received a dangerous wound;\r\nall the rest escaped with mere bruises and scratches. The Sikhs were\r\njustly proud of their share in the work. During the siege, when water\r\nran short, they dug a well underneath the house, and continued their\r\nlabour till they came to a spring; when all was happily ended, they\r\nrequested that the well might be built into a permanent one, as a\r\nmemento of their services; and that the house itself should receive the\r\ninscription of ‘Futtehgurh’ or ‘stronghold of victory’—requests with\r\nwhich Mr Boyle was not at all unwilling to comply.\r\n\r\nWe must now direct attention again to Patna and Dinapoor, and notice the\r\nmeasures taken to check if possible the triumph of the mutineers. Mr\r\nTayler at the one place had civil control, and General Lloyd at the\r\nother had military control, over Arrah as well as all other towns in the\r\nneighbourhood; and both felt that that station was placed in peril as\r\nsoon as the mutineers moved westward from Dinapoor. Some weeks earlier,\r\nwhen the railway officials had hurried away from Arrah to Dinapoor in\r\naffright, Mr Tayler rebuked them, saying that, ‘this is a crisis when\r\nevery Englishman should feel that his individual example is of an\r\nimportance which it is difficult to calculate. It is of great\r\nconsequence that Europeans should exhibit neither alarm nor panic; and\r\nthat, whenever it is practicable, they should band together for mutual\r\ndefence and protection.’ This rebuke aided Mr Wake’s advice in bringing\r\nthe railway people back to Arrah. It may here be remarked that Mr Tayler\r\nhimself was, during the early part of July, in a state of discord, not\r\nonly with the natives, but with many of the Europeans at Patna. He had\r\nan unseemly wrangle with Mr Lowis the magistrate; and was himself\r\nfrequently reprimanded by the lieutenant-governor of Bengal. This\r\nanarchy appears to have arisen from the fact that, at a time of much\r\ndifficulty, different views were entertained concerning the best policy\r\nto be pursued—views, advocated in a way that much obstructed public\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIt was about one o’clock on the 25th that the authorities at Patna heard\r\nalarming intelligence from Dinapoor. Mr Tayler at once summoned all the\r\nEuropeans resident in the city to his house, where measures of defence\r\nwere planned in case of an attack. At three o’clock a distant firing\r\nannounced that the mutiny had taken place; and within an hour or two\r\ncame the news that the mutinous regiments had marched off towards the\r\nwest. Mr Tayler made up an expeditionary force of about 100\r\npersons—Sikhs, Nujeebs, recruits, and volunteers—and sent it off that\r\nsame night towards Arrah, to watch the movements of the rebels. At dawn\r\non the following morning, however, unfavourable news came in from many\r\ncountry stations; and the commissioner, uneasy about Patna and its\r\nneighbourhood, recalled the corps. Tayler and Lloyd did not work well\r\ntogether at that crisis. The commissioner wrote to the general on the\r\nday after the mutiny, urging him to send 50 European troops either to\r\nChupra or to Mozufferpoor, or both, to protect those places from an\r\nattack threatened by insurgents. To this application Lloyd returned a\r\nsomewhat querulous answer—that he had only 600 Europeans at Dinapoor;\r\nthat he was afraid of treachery on the part of Koer Singh; that he had\r\nalready been blamed by the Calcutta authorities for listening to\r\napplications for troops to defend Patna, instead of sending them on to\r\nAllahabad; and that he could render no aid for the purposes required. Mr\r\nTayler renewed the subject by announcing that he would send 50 Sikhs to\r\nthe two places named; and he strongly urged the general to send 200 men\r\nto rout the mutineers who had gone to Arrah—proposing, at the same time,\r\nthe establishment of a corps of volunteer cavalry among the officers and\r\ngentlemen of Patna and Dinapoor. In most of these matters Mr Tayler\r\nappears to have judged more soundly than General Lloyd; but in one point\r\nhe was fatally in error—he believed that Baboo Koer Singh of Jugdispore\r\nwould remain faithful to the British government.\r\n\r\nIf the ‘defence of Arrah’ has acquired notoriety, so has the ‘disaster’\r\nat that place—to which we must now direct attention. This disaster was\r\npeculiarly mortifying to the British, as giving a temporary triumph to\r\nthe mutineers, and as involving a positive loss of many English soldiers\r\nat a critical period. The revolt at Dinapoor having occurred on Saturday\r\nthe 25th of July, General Lloyd made no effort until Monday the 27th to\r\nlook after the sepoys; but on that day he sent a party of the 37th foot\r\nfrom Dinapoor towards Arrah, for the purpose of dispersing the mutineers\r\nassembled at that place, and for rescuing the European community hemmed\r\nin there. The troops went in the _Horungotta_ steamer; but this\r\nunfortunately went aground after three hours’ steaming, and the plan was\r\nfrustrated. On the evening of Tuesday the 28th, another expedition was\r\norganised; and it was to this that the disastrous loss occurred. The\r\nsteamer _Bombay_ happening to arrive at Dinapoor in her downward passage\r\non the Ganges, Lloyd detained it, and arranged to send a detachment on\r\nboard. The _Bombay_ was to take a certain number of troops, steam up to\r\nthe spot where the _Horungotta_ had run aground, take in tow the\r\ndetachment from that steamer, and proceed up the river Sone to a\r\nlanding-place as near as possible to Arrah. This river enters the Ganges\r\nat a point a few miles west of Dinapoor. Early in the morning of\r\nWednesday the 29th, the steamer started, and after picking up the other\r\ndetachment, the whole disembarked in the afternoon at Beharee Ghat—over\r\n400 men in all, under Captain Dunbar.[65] The landing having been safely\r\neffected on the left or west bank of the Sone, the troops marched to a\r\nnullah which it was necessary to cross by means of boats. When, after a\r\nconsiderable delay, this was accomplished, they resumed their march,\r\nwith a bright moon above them, a rough road beneath them, and a very few\r\nof the enemy in sight; and the evening was far advanced when they\r\nreached a bridge about a mile and a half short of Arrah. Here Captain\r\nHarrison of the 37th suggested that they should halt until daylight, and\r\nnot incur the danger of entering the town by night; but Captain Dunbar,\r\nof the 10th, who commanded the force, overruled this suggestion, under\r\nan unfortunate impression that there would be little or no opposition.\r\nThis was the fatal mistake that wrecked the whole enterprise. The troops\r\narrived at Arrah at eleven at night, in black darkness, for the moon had\r\nset; then passed through the outskirts of the town—the 10th leading,\r\nthen the Sikhs, then the 37th. Suddenly, while passing by a large tope\r\nof mango-trees, a dreadful musketry-fire flashed out of the gloom; the\r\nenemy, it now appeared, had been lying in ambush awaiting the arrival of\r\nthe unsuspecting force. Mr Wake and his companions were startled by the\r\nsound of this musketry, audible enough in their beleaguered but\r\nwell-defended house; they at once inferred that something wrong had\r\noccurred to British troops, and in this inference they were only too\r\ncorrect. The suddenness of the attack, and the blackness of the night,\r\nseem to have overwhelmed the detachment; the men lost their officers,\r\nthe officers their men: some ran off the road to fire into the tope,\r\nothers to obtain shelter; Dunbar fell dead; and Harrison had to assume\r\nthe command of men whom, at midnight and in utter darkness, he could not\r\nsee. The main body succeeded in reassembling in a field about four\r\nhundred yards from the tope; and there they remained until\r\ndaylight—being joined at various periods of the night by stragglers,\r\nsome wounded and some unhurt, and being fired at almost continually by\r\nthe mutineers. It was a wretched humiliating night to the British. At\r\ndaybreak they counted heads, and then found how severe had been their\r\nloss. Captain Harrison at once collecting the survivors into a body,\r\nmarched them back ten or eleven miles to the steamer. The men had fasted\r\nso long (twenty-four hours), through some mismanagement, that they were\r\ntoo weak to act as skirmishers; they defended themselves as long as\r\ntheir ammunition lasted, but kept in column, pursued the whole way by a\r\nlarge body of the enemy, who picked off the poor fellows with fatal\r\ncertainty. Arrived at the banks of the nullah, all organisation ceased;\r\nthe men rushed to the boats in disorder; some were run aground, some\r\ndrowned, some swam over, some were shot by sepoys and villagers on\r\nshore. How the rest reached the steamer, they hardly knew; but this they\r\ndid know—that they had left many of their wounded comrades on shore,\r\nwith the certain fate of being butchered and mutilated by the enemy. It\r\nwas a mournful boat-load that the _Bombay_ carried back to Dinapoor on\r\nthe evening of the 30th of July. Captain Dunbar, Lieutenants Bagnall and\r\nIngilby, Ensigns Erskine, Sale, Birkett, and Anderson, and Messrs Cooper\r\nand Platt (gentlemen-volunteers) were killed; Lieutenant Sandwith,\r\nEnsign Venour, and Messrs Garstin and Macdonell (gentlemen-volunteers)\r\nwere wounded. Out of fifteen officers, twelve were killed or wounded.\r\nThe dismal list enumerated 170 officers and men killed, and 120\r\nwounded—290 out of 415! Havelock won half-a-dozen of his victories with\r\nno greater loss than this.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was one disaster on the heels of another. General Lloyd’s\r\nvacillation had permitted the native troops at Dinapoor to mutiny; and\r\nnow the unfortunate Captain Dunbar’s mismanagement had led to the\r\ndestruction of nearly two-thirds of the force sent to rout those\r\nmutineers. Happily, Messrs Wake and Boyle, and their companions, still\r\nheld out; and happily there was a gallant officer near who had the skill\r\nto command as well as the courage to fight. This officer was Major\r\nVincent Eyre, of the artillery. Being _en route_ up the Ganges with some\r\nguns from Dinapoor to Allahabad, and having arrived at Ghazeepore on the\r\n28th of July, he there learned the critical position of the handful of\r\nEuropeans in the house at Arrah. He applied to the authorities at\r\nGhazeepore for permission to make an attempt to relieve Mr Wake; they\r\ngave it: he steamed back to Buxar, and there met a detachment of the 5th\r\nFusiliers going up the Ganges. Finding the officers and men heartily\r\nwilling to aid him, he formed a plan for marching a field-force from\r\nBuxar to Arrah, and there attacking the Dinapoor mutineers and their\r\naccomplice Koer Singh. Although dignified with the name of a\r\nfield-force, it consisted simply of about 160 men of H.M. 5th Fusiliers\r\nunder Captain L’Estrange, 12 mounted volunteers of the railway\r\ndepartment, and three guns; but under an able commander, it was destined\r\nto prove more than a match for nearly _twenty times_ its number of\r\nnative troops. On the 30th of July, the morning when the detachment from\r\nDinapoor retreated from Arrah under such deplorable circumstances, Eyre\r\ncommenced a series of operations west of that town. He started from\r\nBuxar, and marched twenty-eight miles to Shawpoor, where he heard of the\r\ndisaster that had overwhelmed Captain Dunbar’s party. He at once stated\r\nto General Lloyd, in a dispatch: ‘I venture to affirm confidently that\r\nno such disaster would have been likely to occur, had that detachment\r\nadvanced less precipitately, so as to have given full time for my force\r\nto have approached direct from the opposite side; for the rebels would\r\nthen have been hemmed in between the two opposing forces, and must have\r\nbeen utterly routed.’ Regret, however, being useless, Eyre proceeded to\r\ncarry out his own plan. Hearing that the enemy intended to destroy the\r\nbridges _en route_, he pushed on again towards Arrah. On the 1st of\r\nAugust, finding the bridge at Bullowtee just cut, he hastily constructed\r\na substitute, and marched on to Gujeratgunje by nightfall. Here he\r\nbivouacked for the night. At daybreak on the 2d he started again, and\r\nsoon came in sight of the enemy, drawn up in great force in plantations\r\non either side of the road, with inundated rice-fields in front; they\r\nhad sallied out of Arrah to meet him. Perceiving that the enemy intended\r\nto turn his flanks, he boldly pushed on against their centre, penetrated\r\nit, and advanced to the village of Beebeegunje. The enemy, baffled by\r\nhis tactics, gave up their first plan, and hastily sought to prevent his\r\npassage over a bridge near the village. In this they succeeded for a\r\ntime, by destroying the bridge. After resting his troops a while,\r\nEyre—seeing that the enemy had formed extensive earthworks beyond the\r\nstream, and that they occupied the houses of the village in great\r\nforce—determined to make a detour to the right, and try to cross about a\r\nmile higher up. The enemy, seeing his object, followed him quickly, and\r\nattacked him with great boldness, being flushed by their recent victory\r\nover the luckless river detachment. They were nearly 2500 strong in\r\nmutinous sepoys alone, besides Koer Singh and his followers. After an\r\nhour’s hard fighting, Eyre ordered Captain L’Estrange to make a charge\r\nwith infantry. Promptly and gallantly that officer obeyed the order; his\r\nskirmishers on the right turned the enemy’s flank, the guns with grape\r\nand shrapnell shells drove in the centre; and then the infantry\r\nadvanced—driving the enemy, panic-stricken, in all directions. Losing no\r\ntime, the major crossed the stream, and advanced through an open country\r\nto within four miles of Arrah. Here he was suddenly brought up by an\r\nimpassable river, which cost him many hours’ hard labour to bridge\r\nover—obtaining, fortunately, for that purpose, the aid of labourers\r\nemployed on the East Indian Railway, just close at hand. Koer Singh and\r\nthe rebels were so dismayed at these proceedings, that they left Arrah\r\naltogether, and retreated in various directions. It seems almost\r\nincredible, although the detailed official list places the matter beyond\r\nall doubt, that Major Eyre, during nine hours’ severe fighting on this\r\nday, lost only 2 killed and 14 wounded.\r\n\r\nAs a means of enabling this energetic officer to follow up his success,\r\na reinforcement was sent to him from Dinapoor on the 7th of August,\r\nconsisting of 200 of H.M. 10th foot. This reinforcement entered Arrah on\r\nthe next day; and a party of 100 Sikhs having arrived a day or two\r\nafterwards, the major was enabled to lay his plans for an expedition to\r\nJugdispore, twelve miles distant, to which place Koer Singh and a large\r\nnumber of the mutineers had retired. The enterprise was not to be\r\ncommenced without some caution; for the roads were difficult for the\r\npassage of troops at that season of the year, and the rebel chief’s fort\r\nat Jugdispore was represented as being very strong and well defended.\r\nAll this, however, only whetted the desire of Eyre’s troops to try their\r\nmettle against the enemy. The force consisted of just 500 men,[66] with\r\nthree guns. On the afternoon of the 11th he took his departure from\r\nArrah, marched eight miles, and encamped for the night on the bank of\r\nthe Gagur Nuddee. Resuming his progress next morning, he passed over two\r\nmiles of rice-fields nearly under water, which rendered the draught of\r\nhis guns very difficult. At eleven o’clock he espied some of the enemy\r\nin the village of Tola Narainpore, evidently preparing to resist his\r\npassage of a river immediately beyond. After a fight of skirmishers,\r\nEyre opened a fire of grape which roused up a large body of the enemy\r\nconcealed behind bushes. The detachment of the 10th foot, eager to\r\nemulate the previous heroism of their comrades of the 5th Fusiliers, and\r\nexasperated by their previous loss under Captain Dunbar, asked to be\r\npermitted to charge the enemy at once; Eyre consented; Captain Patterson\r\nled them on; they rushed with a shout and a cheer, and the enemy gave\r\nway before a charge which they found irresistible. The other infantry\r\ncame up and assisted in dispersing the enemy from another village,\r\nDullaur, beyond the river. This accomplished, Eyre marched a mile and a\r\nhalf through thick jungle to Jugdispore, maintaining a running-fight the\r\nwhole way. The treacherous Koer Singh’s stronghold was but feebly\r\ndefended; Eyre took possession of it early in the afternoon, and with it\r\nlarge stores of grain, ammunition, and warlike material. The villagers\r\naround Jugdispore immediately sent in tokens of submission to the\r\nconqueror. Here as in the former instance, Major Eyre suffered\r\nwonderfully small loss; not a man of his force was killed on this 12th\r\nof August, and only six were wounded. The enemy lost 300.\r\n\r\nEyre did not give Koer Singh much time to recover himself. The rebel\r\nchief fled with a few followers to the Jutowrah jungle, where he had a\r\nresidence. Thither the major followed him on the 14th, or rather sent\r\nCaptain L’Estrange with a detachment; but all had dispersed, sepoys and\r\nrebels alike; and L’Estrange returned after destroying residences\r\nbelonging to Koer Singh and his two brothers.\r\n\r\nIt may suffice here to mention, that, so far as concerned the region\r\nsouth and southwest of Arrah, the remaining days of August were spent in\r\nthe marching of the Dinapoor mutineers from place to place, and the\r\nplundering or threatening of many towns as they passed. The authorities\r\nwould gladly have checked the course of so many armed rebels; but it\r\nbecame a question whether Eyre or any other officer was strong enough in\r\nEuropeans to do so, and whether their aid was not more urgently needed\r\nat Allahabad, Cawnpore, and Lucknow. The mutineers marched southward of\r\nMirzapore into Bundelcund, with the treacherous Koer Singh at their\r\nhead. The engineers and others connected with the works for the East\r\nIndian railway were among those most perplexed by this movement of the\r\nrebels; because the various places occupied temporarily by those persons\r\nwere just in the way of the mutineers. A lady, wife to one of these\r\nofficials, has recorded in a letter that she and her friends received\r\nearly news on the 25th of July that something was wrong at Dinapoor;\r\nthat on the 26th the rebels themselves made their appearance; that the\r\nfamily got into a boat on the Sone, with no property but the clothes on\r\ntheir backs; that they immediately rowed off towards Dinapoor as the\r\nonly means of escape; and that scarcely had they embarked when they saw\r\nbungalow’s and property of every description—belonging to individuals,\r\nto the railway company, and to the East India Company—a prey to\r\ndevastating flames. ‘Everything we have in the world is gone,’ said the\r\ndisconsolate writer; ‘what to do, or where to go, we know not.’ It is no\r\nwonder that the letters of such sufferers contained bitter comments on\r\nthe government and politics of India—bitter, but often unjust.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this mutiny of the Dinapoor sepoys were, as has already\r\nbeen remarked, deep and wide-spreading. It is scarcely too much to say\r\nthat twenty or thirty millions of persons were thrown into agitation by\r\nit. Along the whole line of the Ganges it was felt, from Calcutta up to\r\nAllahabad; along the great trunk-road between these two cities, it was\r\nfelt; in the belt of country north of the Ganges; in the belt between\r\nthe Ganges and the great road; in the belt south of the great road—in\r\nall these extensive regions, the news from Dinapoor threw Christians and\r\nnatives alike into a ferment. Some discontented natives had vague hopes\r\nof advantage by the threatened dissolution of the English ‘raj;’ some of\r\nthe villagers dreaded the approach of marauders who made little scruple\r\nin pillaging friend as well as foe; while all the Europeans cried out as\r\nwith one voice: ‘Send us reliable British troops.’ Viscount Canning had\r\nnone to send; and when ship-loads of troops did at length arrive at\r\nCalcutta, they were so urgently wanted higher up the country that he\r\ncould spare few or none for regions east of Allahabad.\r\n\r\nThe revenue-officers were placed in a position of trying difficulty in\r\nthose days. Besides collecting the taxes on land, salt, &c., and keeping\r\nthe money in the local treasuries until it could be sent safely to\r\nCalcutta, they stored up large quantities of opium at certain factories,\r\nwhich were in their special keeping. The Company were the purchasers of\r\nthe opium from the poppy-growers, and the sellers of it (at a large\r\nprofit) to British merchants at Calcutta or Bombay; and during the\r\ninterval of time between the buying and selling, the opium was stored in\r\ngodowns or warehouses at certain large towns. Patna was the chief of\r\nthese towns; and thus the revenue-officers of that place were especially\r\ninterested in the maintenance of tranquillity among the native troops in\r\nthe neighbouring station at Dinapoor. Dr Lyell, as was stated in a\r\nformer page, fell a victim to Mussulman fanaticism at Patna early in\r\nJuly, about three weeks before the mutiny at Dinapoor. On the very day\r\nbefore his murder, anxious for the responsibility thrown upon him, he\r\nwrote an official letter which is interesting as illustrating the matter\r\nnow under consideration. He had just succeeded the chief opium-agent,\r\nlately deceased, and had under his charge opium to the enormous value of\r\n_two millions_ sterling, together with other government property of a\r\nquarter of a million. He had endeavoured to strengthen the opium godowns\r\nby barricading the gates with timber, and raising a breastwork of chests\r\nfilled with sand on the flat roofs—fearful lest an excited rabble should\r\nattack the place. He had less than twenty Europeans on whom he could\r\nrely. Major-general Lloyd at Dinapoor either could not or would not\r\nsupply him with any troops; and he sent to Calcutta urgent requisitions\r\nfor British troops, Sikh police, and guns. Matters became worse; Lyell\r\nhimself was massacred, and the native troops at Dinapoor mutinied; then,\r\nat the end of July, the revenue-officers at Patna announced to the\r\ngovernment that the property under their charge had accumulated to three\r\nmillions sterling, and that they could not adequately protect it unless\r\nreinforcements were sent. This appeared so serious at Calcutta, that\r\narrangements were made for throwing a few British troops, and a few\r\nreliable Sikhs, into Patna.\r\n\r\nThe region north of the Ganges and east of Oude was in a perpetual state\r\nof flutter and uneasiness during those troubled weeks. There were few\r\ntroops, either native or British; but the rumours from other quarters,\r\ngaining strength as they passed from mouth to mouth, occasioned great\r\nuneasiness, especially among the Europeans engaged in indigo-planting\r\nand other industrial pursuits. There was a small military station at\r\nSegowlie, not far from the Nepaul frontier, under the charge of Major\r\nHolmes; and this officer thought proper, even before the month of June\r\nwas ended, to proclaim martial law in the districts between Segowlie and\r\nPatna. Mr Tayler, commissioner at the last-named city, thought this a\r\nbold proceeding; but he sanctioned it on account of the disturbed state\r\nof the country. The Calcutta government, however, considered that the\r\nmajor had overstrained his authority, and rebuked him for so doing.\r\nBefore he could be informed of this rebuke, Holmes had assumed absolute\r\nmilitary control over all the region between Patna and Goruckpore—giving\r\norders to magistrates to watch the ghats or landing-places, to arrest\r\nsuspicious persons, to offer rewards for the apprehension of rebels, to\r\nkeep an eye on the petty rajahs and chieftains, to strengthen the native\r\npolice, and to act in all things subordinately to him as military\r\ncommander throughout the districts of Sarun, Tirhoot, and Chumparun.\r\nMilitary men applauded this step, but the civilians took umbrage at an\r\nassumption of power not warranted by any instructions received from\r\nCalcutta. This energetic but hapless officer was not permitted to remain\r\nmany weeks in the position which he had taken up; his chief troops were\r\nthe 12th irregular cavalry; and these rose on the 24th of July at\r\nSegowlie, murdered him and Mrs Holmes, as well as other Europeans, and\r\nthen bent their steps towards Azimghur. This atrocity caused great\r\nconsternation; for the 12th had been much trusted among the native\r\nregiments, as one whose gallantry was a guarantee for its fidelity.\r\nGallantry was exchanged for cowardice and villainy this day. While the\r\nmajor and his wife were riding out, four of the troopers came up to the\r\nvehicle and _beheaded them both_ as they sat; this being the signal, the\r\nrest of the regiment rose in mutiny, murdered the surgeon, his wife, and\r\nchildren, plundered the treasury, and made off in the way just noticed.\r\nWhen this savage act became known, and when the mutiny at Dinapoor on\r\nthe next following day was also known, nothing could exceed the\r\nagitation among the Europeans. At Chupra, a station nearly opposite\r\nArrah, the Europeans at once abandoned their homes and occupations, and\r\nran off to Dinapoor, to be behind the shelter of a few hundred English\r\nbayonets; this was, indeed, not to be wondered at, for Chupra itself was\r\nthreatened by the Segowlie mutineers. On the 30th, when the events at\r\nDinapoor became known at Calcutta, the government did all and more than\r\nall that Major Holmes had before done; they declared martial law—not\r\nonly in the northern districts of Sarun, Tirhoot, and Chumparun, but\r\nalso in those districts of the Patna division south of the Ganges—Patna,\r\nBehar, and Shahabad. All through the month of August, the districts\r\nnorth of the river were in the state just noticed; no further mutinies\r\ntook place there, but the various stations were thrown into frequent\r\npanics by the threatened irruption of insurgents from other quarters. It\r\nwas chiefly from Oude that these onslaughts were feared; for that\r\nprovince contained more rebels than any other—more natives who, without\r\nbeing actually soldiers, were quite ready to embark in any desperate\r\nenterprise, military or marauding, against the English.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the whole region right and left of the main trunk-road\r\nwas thrown into commotion by the mutiny at Dinapoor; this was certainly\r\nthe case, if we add to the disturbing causes the revolt of one or two\r\nminor corps within this region itself. To describe how the region is\r\nparcelled out into divisions, districts, and collectorates, is wholly\r\nunnecessary: few in England know, and still fewer care, much concerning\r\nthese territorial details; but if the reader will roughly mark out with\r\nhis eye a sweep of country four hundred miles long by a hundred and\r\nfifty in width, beginning at Moorshedabad or Midnapore, and ending at\r\nBenares, and lying on the right or south of the Ganges—he will there see\r\nthat which, in July and August, was a region of perplexity. Small\r\nmilitary stations, and much more numerous civil stations, dot this\r\nspace. The dispatches relating to the events of those two months spoke\r\nof dangers and alarms at places not one half of which are known even by\r\nname to any but persons intimately connected with India—Hazarebagh,\r\nSheergotty, Burhee, Ramgurh, Sasseram, Bhagulpore, Bagoda, Ranchee,\r\nBowsee, Gayah, Pittorea, Raneegunge, Rownee, Dorunda, Chyebassa, Rotas,\r\nPurulia, Bancorah, Dehree, Rotasgurh—all were places either disturbed by\r\nthe visits of mutineers, or thrown into commotion lest those visits\r\nshould be made at a time when means of defence were scanty.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happened, at that troubled period, that while the\r\nBritish officers were making arrangements to disarm suspected regiments,\r\nthe men of those regiments anticipated that proceeding by marching off\r\nin mutiny, of course taking their arms with them. Such happened to\r\nLieutenant Graham, commanding at Hazarebagh. Being at Dorunda on the\r\n30th of July, and learning that the 8th B. N. I. were unreliable at\r\nHazarebagh, he marched off with a view to disarm them; taking with him\r\nabout 220 Ramgurh infantry, 30 Ramgurh cavalry, and two 6-pounder guns.\r\nOn that very day, long before he could reach Hazarebagh, the sepoys rose\r\nin mutiny, plundered the treasury, and released all the prisoners.\r\nGraham soon found himself in difficulties; he could not pass his guns\r\nover the river Damoodah at Ramgurh, because his bullocks were too few\r\nand too weak; and his Ramgurh infantry shewed signs of a disposition to\r\nmarch back to Dorunda and take the guns with them. After an anxious\r\nnight, he crossed the river on the morning of the 31st, with his few\r\ntroopers; but his infantry broke their faith, and marched away with the\r\ntwo guns. So far, therefore, from being able to disarm a suspected\r\nregiment, the lieutenant had the mortification of hearing that the\r\nregiment had mutinied, and, in addition, of seeing his own infantry\r\nfollow the pernicious example. One fact cheered Lieutenant Graham in his\r\nanxious duty; his 30 sowars remained faithful to him. When Captain Drew,\r\nwho commanded the detachment at Hazarebagh, came to make his report, it\r\nappeared that the men of the 8th B. N. I. numbered just 200 bayonets,\r\nforming two companies of one of the regiments lately mutinied at\r\nDinapoor. When news reached the captain, on the 28th, of this last-named\r\nmutiny, he made arrangements for removing the ladies and children from\r\nthe station, as he had seen enough to make him distrust his own men; he\r\nalso sent to Colonel Robbins at Dorunda, for the aid of Lieutenant\r\nGraham’s Ramgurh force, and to Calcutta for any available aid in the\r\nshape of European troops. Four ladies and six children were forwarded to\r\na place of safety, and Captain Drew passed the 29th in some anxiety. On\r\nthe 30th he addressed his men, praising the sepoys who in certain\r\nregiments had remained faithful while their comrades revolted; his\r\nnative officers seemed to listen to him respectfully, but the sepoys\r\nmaintained an ominous silence. On that same afternoon the men ran to the\r\nbells of arms, broke them open, and seized their muskets. The die was\r\ncast. All the officers, military and civil, jumped on their horses, and\r\nrode for twelve hours through jungle, reaching Bagoda on the trunk-road\r\non the morning of the 31st; after two hours’ rest they galloped forty\r\nmiles further, then took transit dâk to Raneegunge, whence they\r\ntravelled to Calcutta by railway. Meanwhile the mutineers released 800\r\nprisoners, burned the bungalows, and pillaged the treasury of seventy\r\nthousand rupees. Whether a bold front might have prevented all this,\r\ncannot now be known; Captain Drew asserted that if he and the other\r\nofficers had remained, they must inevitably have been killed on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nAn instructive illustration was afforded towards the close of July, of\r\nthe intimate connection between the rebel sepoys and the villages of\r\nBehar or Western Bengal. The government issued a proclamation, offering\r\nrewards for the apprehension of mutineers and deserters. Mr Money,\r\nmagistrate at Gayah, found by inquiries that the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages refused to aid in giving up such men; but he hit upon a mode of\r\nascertaining at least the connection between the sepoys and the villages\r\nrespectively. Every sepoy remitted to his village a portion of his pay,\r\nby means of remittance-bills and descriptive rolls; each bill went to\r\nthe accountant; the receipt of the payee went back to the regiment;\r\nwhile the descriptive roll was kept and filed in the office of the\r\nmagistrate, shewing the name and regiment of the remitter. Mr Money\r\nthought it useful to collect and tabulate all these descriptive rolls\r\nfor two years; and thus was able to obtain a record of the name of every\r\nsepoy belonging to every village within his jurisdiction. He could thus\r\ntrack any rebel soldier who might return to his village in hope of\r\nescaping punishment; for the native police, if ordered to apprehend a\r\nparticular man in a particular district would do so, although unwilling\r\nto initiate inquiries. The matter is noted here, as shewing how closely\r\nthe ties of family were kept up by the sepoys in this regular\r\ntransmission of money from the soldier in his camp to his relations in\r\ntheir village.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the month of July, before the state of affairs\r\nat Dinapoor had assumed a serious import, the towns and districts\r\nrecently named were troubled rather by vague apprehensions than by\r\nactual dangers. At Gayah, the chief town of a district south of Patna,\r\nthe magistrate was in much anxiety; the native inhabitants, in part\r\nhopefully and in part fearfully, were looking out daily for news from\r\nthe mutineers in the Jumna and Ganges regions; and he felt much doubt\r\nwhether the Company’s treasury at that place was safe. So it was in most\r\nof the towns and stations; from Raneegunge, where the finished portion\r\nof the railway ended (at about a hundred and twenty miles from\r\nCalcutta), to the districts approaching Benares and Patna, magistrates\r\nand revenue-collectors, feeling their responsibility as civil servants\r\nof the Company, cried aloud to Calcutta for a few, even a very few,\r\nEnglish troops, to set at rest their apprehensions; but Calcutta, as\r\nthese pages have over and over again shewn, had no troops to spare\r\nexcept for the great stations further to the northwest.\r\n\r\nAs the month advanced, these symptoms of uneasiness increased in number\r\nand intensity; and when the isolated mutineers at Rownee, Monghir,\r\nHazarebagh, &c., became intensified by the more momentous outbreak at\r\nDinapoor, fear grew in some instances up to panic, and the Company’s\r\nofficers hastened away from stations which they believed themselves\r\nunable to hold. But here, as elsewhere, difficulties raised different\r\nqualities in different minds; many of these gentlemen behaved with a\r\nheroism worthy of all praise, as Mr Wake and Mr Boyle had done at Arrah.\r\nAt some of the places not a single English soldier could be seen, or was\r\nlikely to be seen at that time; and under those circumstances it was a\r\nfact of high importance that Captain Rattray’s battalion of Sikh police\r\nremained stanch and true—ready to march in small detachments to any\r\nthreatened spot, and always rendering good service. When the two\r\ncompanies of the 8th B. N. I. mutinied at Hazarebagh, towards the close\r\nof the month, and when the Ramgurh force followed their example instead\r\nof opposing them, the civilians in this wide region were really placed\r\nin great peril; Hazarebagh wished to know what Ramgurh would do,\r\nSheergotty looked anxiously towards Gayah, and Raneegunge feared for the\r\nsafety of its railway station. The Raneegunge officials, after fleeing\r\nto Calcutta, returned to their station about the middle of August, under\r\nthe protection of Sikh police. The wife of one of the civil servants of\r\nthe Company, writing from Raneegunge on the 7th of August, told of the\r\nsad condition in which European fugitives reached that place, coming\r\nfrom various disturbed districts. ‘We are overwhelmed with refugees from\r\nall places. Some of the poor creatures have come without a thing but\r\nwhat they have on, and I am obliged to give them all changes of clothes\r\nfor a time. Many came after riding seventy miles on one horse, and one\r\ngentleman without a saddle—a doctor and two others in their\r\nnight-clothes—as they started while the wretches were firing into their\r\nbungalows. My husband had to lend them clothes to go to Calcutta in.’\r\nThe telegraphic messages or written letters that passed between Calcutta\r\nand the various stations in Western Bengal, in July and August, occupy a\r\nvery large space in the blue-books relating to the mutiny; they\r\neverywhere tell of officials expressing apprehensions of being obliged\r\nto flee unless reinforcements could be sent to them; and of distinct\r\nreplies from the governor-general that, as he had no troops to send\r\nthem, they must bear up as long as their sagacity and resolution would\r\npermit. The Europeans at Sheergotty left that station in a body, not\r\nbecause they were attacked, but because they saw no hope of defence if\r\nenemies should approach. Many Europeans, however, similarly placed,\r\nafterwards regretted that they had fled; instances were not few of the\r\nmoral power obtained over the native mind by men who resolutely clung to\r\ntheir duty in moments of peril; while in those cases where the\r\nabandonment took place, ‘the thieves and rabble of the neighbourhood,’\r\nas an eye-witness remarked, ‘plundered the cutcheries and private\r\nhouses; and those who had grudges against their neighbours began to hope\r\nand to prepare for an opportunity of vengeance.’\r\n\r\nAugust found matters in an equally unsettled state. Many of the\r\nmagistrates and collectors now had a new difficulty. Mr Tayler, as\r\ncommissioner for the whole of the Patna division, ordered such of them\r\nas were under his control to abandon their stations and come into Patna\r\nfor shelter; many were quite willing to do so; but others, resolute and\r\ndetermined men, did not like this appearance of shrinking from their\r\nduty in time of trouble. Mr Money, the magistrate of Gayah, called a\r\nmeeting of the Europeans at that station, and read Mr Tayler’s order to\r\nthem; it was decided by vote to abandon the place and its treasure, and\r\nretreat to Patna. ‘We formed rather a picturesque cavalcade,’ said one\r\nof the number, ‘as we wound out from Gayah; the elephants and horses;\r\nthe scarlet of the Europeans contrasting with the white dresses of the\r\nSikh soldiery; the party of gentlemen, armed to the teeth, who rode in\r\nthe midst; and the motley assemblage of writers, servants, and\r\nhangers-on that crowded in the rear.’ While on the road towards Patna,\r\ntwo of the gentlemen, Mr Money and Mr Hollings, feeling some humiliation\r\nat the position they were in, resolved to march back to their posts even\r\nif none others accompanied them. It happened that a few men of the 64th\r\nfoot had passed through Gayah a day or two before, and Mr Money was\r\nenabled to bring them back for a short period. These two officials, it\r\nis true, were afterwards driven away from Gayah by a band of released\r\nprisoners, and fled to Calcutta; but their firmness in an hour of\r\ndifficulty won for them approval and promotion from the government. This\r\ntransaction at Gayah was connected with a series of quarrels which led\r\nto much partisan spirit. Mr Tayler had long been in disfavour with Mr\r\nHalliday, lieutenant-governor of Bengal, as an official of a very\r\nintractable and insubordinate character; and after the issue of the\r\norder lately adverted to, Mr Tayler was removed from his office\r\naltogether—a step that led to a storm of letters, papers, pamphlets,\r\ncharges, and counter-charges, very exciting to the Calcutta community at\r\nthat time, but having little permanent interest in connection with the\r\nmutiny.\r\n\r\nAs the month advanced, the government were able to send a few English\r\ntroops to some of the stations above named. When Mr Halliday had\r\nlearned, by telegrams and letters, that not a single European remained\r\nin Sheergotty or Bagoda, and that the native troops of the Ramgurh\r\nbattalion had mutinied at Ranchee, Purulia, and elsewhere, he earnestly\r\nbegged Lord Canning to send a few troops thither, or the whole region\r\nwould be left at the mercy of marauding bands. This the governor-general\r\nwas fortunately enabled to do, owing to the arrival about that time of\r\ntroops from the China expedition.\r\n\r\nWhen August ended, the Dinapoor mutineers, under Koer Singh, were\r\nmarching onwards to the Jumna regions, as if with the intention of\r\njoining the mutineers in Bundelcund; the 12th irregulars, after their\r\natrocity at Segowlie, were bending their steps towards Oude; the Ramgurh\r\nmutineers were marching westward to the Sone, as if to join Koer Singh;\r\nwhile the petty chieftains, liberated prisoners, and ruffians of all\r\nkinds, were looking out for ‘loot’ wherever there was a chance of\r\nobtaining it. Bengal and Behar exhibited nothing that could be dignified\r\nwith the name of battles or war; it was simply anarchy, with\r\ninsufficient force on the part of the authorities to restore order.\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate result of the Dinapoor mutiny was, that the Europeans\r\ncontracted a sentiment of hatred towards the natives, so deadly as to\r\ndefeat all the purposes of justice and fairness. When Sir James Outram\r\nwas at Dinapoor, on his way up the Ganges, he found that some of the\r\nEnglish soldiers had murdered several sepoys against whom nothing could\r\nbe charged—in revenge for the terrible loss suffered at Arrah. Sir James\r\nnoticed in one of his dispatches, with strong expressions of regret, the\r\ndistortion of feeling thus brought about by the mutiny; distortion,\r\nbecause those soldiers were not, at other times, less inclined to be\r\njust and manly than the other regiments of her Majesty’s army. It was a\r\nsore trial for men, when scenes of brutal cruelty were everywhere before\r\ntheir eyes, coolly to draw the line between justice and vengeance, and\r\nto discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n           H.M. 10th foot,              153 officers and men.\r\n           H.M. 37th foot,              197 officers and men.\r\n           Sikhs of police battalion,    50 officers and men.\r\n           Sikhs of mutinied regiments,  15 officers and men.\r\n                                        ———\r\n                                        415\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  H.M. 5th Fusiliers, 137 men, under Captain L’Estrange; H.M. 10th foot,\r\n  197 men, under Captain Patterson; Sikh battalion, 150 men, under Mr\r\n  Wake, of Arrah celebrity; mounted volunteers, 16, under Lieutenant\r\n  Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n                    MINOR MUTINIES: JULY AND AUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily appreciate the grounds on which it is deemed\r\ninexpedient to carry out uninterruptedly the history of the mutiny at\r\nany one spot. Unless contemporaneous events elsewhere be noticed, links\r\nin the chain of causes and effects will be wanting. We have traced the\r\nsiege of Delhi down to a certain point in the line of operations; we\r\nhave followed the footsteps of Havelock until he reached the\r\nball-shattered home of the European residents at Lucknow; we have\r\nwatched the more immediate effects of the Dinapoor mutiny in the regions\r\nof Bengal and Behar. It now, however, becomes necessary to inquire what\r\nwas doing elsewhere during the months of July and August—how the\r\nEuropeans at Agra fared, when the stations on all sides of them were in\r\nthe hands of the insurgents; how far the affrighted women and tender\r\nchildren succeeded in finding refuge at the hill-stations of Nynee Tal\r\nand its neighbourhood; what the Mahratta followers of Scindia and Holkar\r\nwere doing; to what extent Rohilcund and the Cis-Sutlej territory were\r\nthrown into anarchy; whether or not Bombay and Madras, Nagpoor and the\r\nNizam’s country, remained at peace; how, in short, India generally was\r\naffected during the two months above named. Fortunately, this duty will\r\nnot demand so full a measure of treatment as the analogous narratives\r\nfor earlier months. The isolated revolts in June occupied attention in\r\nthree successive Chapters[67]—because of their great number, the\r\nwide-spreading area over which they occurred, the sufferings of many of\r\nthe Europeans, the romantic adventures of others, the daring bravery of\r\nnearly all, and the necessity for describing the geographical and\r\nmilitary peculiarities of the several provinces and stations. These\r\nmatters having once been treated with moderate fulness, the narrative\r\nmay now proceed at an accelerated pace; insomuch that we shall be\r\nenabled, in the present chapter, to take a bird’s-eye glance at the\r\nisolated or miscellaneous events, whether mutinies or suppressions of\r\nmutiny, belonging to the months of July and August.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by directing attention to that small but thickly populated\r\ncountry lying between Patna and Allahabad, and extending in the other\r\ndirection from the Ganges to Nepaul. Goruckpore, Ghazeepore, Azimghur,\r\nJounpoor, and Benares, all lie within this region; Dinapoor, Buxar,\r\nMirzapore, Sultanpore, and Fyzabad, lie just beyond it; and towns and\r\nvillages of smaller character bestrew it more thickly than any other\r\npart of India. When Henry Lawrence was dead, and Inglis powerless in\r\nOude for anything beyond maintaining his position in Lucknow; when\r\nWheeler had been killed at Cawnpore, and Lloyd superseded at Dinapoor;\r\nwhen Colvin was shut up in Agra, and could do very little as\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces—there was scarcely any\r\none who could exercise control within the region just marked out. If a\r\nmagistrate, collector, or commandant, succeeded in maintaining British\r\nsupremacy by mingled courage and sagacity, so far well; but he was in\r\nfew instances able to exercise power beyond the limits of his own town\r\nor station. Under these circumstances, Viscount Canning created a new\r\noffice, that of ‘Lieutenant-governor of the Central Provinces,’ and gave\r\nit to Mr J. P. Grant, one of the members of the Supreme Council at\r\nCalcutta. The object in view was to restore order to a large range of\r\ncountry that had been thrown into utter anarchy. The title was not,\r\nperhaps, happily chosen; for there was already a ‘Central India,’\r\ncomprising the Mahratta country around Indore or Malwah; and, moreover,\r\na jurisdiction was hardly ‘central’ that ran up to the borders of\r\nNepaul. Passing by this, however, the newly aggregated ‘Central\r\nProvinces’ comprised the Allahabad division, the Benares division, and\r\nthe Saugor division; containing a large number of important cities and\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Grant assumed his new duties in August, he found that the\r\nGoruckpore district was entirely in the hands of rebels. The leader of\r\nthe rebels was one Mahomed Hussein, who was at the head of a poorly\r\narmed rabble, rather than of an organised military force, and who, with\r\nthat rabble, had been perpetrating acts of great barbarity. One\r\ncivilian, Mr Bird, had displayed that gallant spirit which so honourably\r\nmarked many of the Company’s servants: he remained behind, at his own\r\nrequest, when the rest of the civil officers fled from Goruckpore; he\r\nhoped to be able to maintain his position, but was forced after a time\r\nto yield to the pressure of adverse circumstances, and escape to\r\nBettiah. The governor-general, during the month of June, accepted aid\r\nwhich had been offered some time previously, by Jung Bahadoor of Nepaul.\r\nIn pursuance of this agreement, three thousand Goorkhas were sent down\r\nfrom Khatmandoo, and entered British territory northward of Goruckpore.\r\nThey were ordered on shortly afterwards to Azimghur; and most of the\r\nGoruckpore officials, availing themselves of this escort, quitted the\r\nstation with their movables and the government treasure. Some of the\r\nGoorkhas then remained for a time at Azimghur, while the rest went to\r\nescort the treasure to Jounpoor and Benares. While at Goruckpore, the\r\nGoorkhas assisted in disarming such native troops as were at the\r\nstation. Much was expected from these hardy troops, and it is only just\r\nto observe that they generally warranted the expectation. It was late in\r\nJune that the arrangement was entered into, the immediate object in view\r\nbeing the pacification of the very districts now under notice.\r\n\r\nThe Azimghur district had its full share in the troubles of the period.\r\nDuring the first half of July, mutinous sepoys from other stations were\r\nfrequently threatening the town of Azimghur, and keeping the Europeans\r\nperpetually on the watch. The 65th native infantry were very turbulent\r\nin the vicinity. On a particular day the Company’s servants at the\r\nstation held a council of war; some voted that Azimghur was untenable,\r\nand that a retreat should be made to Ghazeepore; but bolder councils\r\nprevailed with the majority. At last a regular battle with the enemy\r\ntook place; a battle which has been described in such a lively manner by\r\nMr Venables, deputy-magistrate of Azimghur, that we cannot do better\r\nthan quote a portion of a letter in which he narrated the events of the\r\nday.[68] The action was really worthy of note even in a military sense;\r\nfor a small force, headed by a civilian, defeated an enemy ten times as\r\nnumerous. Mr Venables received the thanks of the government for his\r\nskill and courage on this occasion. But afterwards came a time of\r\nmortification. Of the native troops which formed his little army on the\r\n18th, more than half belonged to the very regiment which mutinied a few\r\ndays afterwards at Segowlie, after murdering their commandant, Major\r\nHolmes. Mr Venables pondered on the question: ‘Will the detachment of\r\nthe 12th irregulars remain faithful at Azimghur, when another portion of\r\nthe same regiment has mutinied at Segowlie?’ He thought such a proof of\r\nfidelity improbable; and therefore, he and the other Europeans sought to\r\navert danger by removing from Azimghur to Ghazeepore, which they did on\r\nthe 30th of July. The district all around the station at Azimghur\r\nremained at the mercy of lawless marauders until the arrival of the\r\nGoorkhas from Goruckpore, mentioned in the last paragraph. Then began a\r\nstruggle, which should act with the most effective energy—Oudian\r\ninsurgents from the west, openly hostile to the British; or Nepaul\r\nGoorkhas from the north, serving in alliance with the British—a struggle\r\nin which, it hardly need be said, many villages were reduced to ashes,\r\nand much disturbance of peaceful industry produced.\r\n\r\nThe Jounpoor district was even more completely disorganised than those\r\nof Goruckpore and Azimghur; it had been almost entirely abandoned since\r\nthe first mutiny of the troops at that station in June. Not until after\r\na Goorkha force had marched into Jounpoor in August, could the civil\r\nofficers feel any safety in returning to their duties at that station.\r\n\r\nBenares, the most important place hereabouts, became a temporary home\r\nfor many officers who, by the revolt of their several native regiments,\r\nhad been suddenly and unwillingly deprived of active duties; there were\r\neight or ten of them, mostly belonging to Oude regiments which had\r\nrevolted. When Jung Bahadoor agreed to send a body of Goorkha troops\r\nfrom Nepaul to the disturbed districts, the Calcutta government\r\ntransmitted orders for some of these unemployed officers to meet those\r\ntroops at Goruckpore, and act with them. Among those officers were\r\nCaptain Boileau and Lieutenants Miles, Hall, and Campbell. It was early\r\nin July when this order was sent to Benares, but some weeks elapsed ere\r\nthe Goorkhas reached Goruckpore. Before this co-operation with the\r\nGoorkhas took place, Benares was enabled to render a little good service\r\nagainst the rebels by the aid of British troops, not stationed at that\r\nplace, but while on transit to the upper provinces. The gallant 78th\r\nHighlanders, journeying from Calcutta to Allahabad, were divided into\r\nportions according as the means of transport were presented, and\r\naccording to the necessities of the districts through which they passed.\r\nOn the 5th of July, Lieutenant-colonel Gordon, commanding the Benares\r\ndistrict, saw the necessity of checking some insurgents near that city;\r\nand he intrusted that duty to Major Haliburton of the 78th. The major\r\nstarted on the morning of the 6th, with a mixed detachment of Europeans\r\nand natives, and marched eight miles on the Azimghur road. His advanced\r\ncavalry reported a large body of the enemy half a mile ahead, with their\r\ncentre posted across the road, and their flanks resting on villages,\r\npartially concealed behind trees and rising-ground. Their number was\r\nabout 500, aided by an equal number of villagers apparently eager for\r\nmischief. The contest was soon over, and the enemy repelled. The chief\r\npoint that rendered the incident worthy of note was that a few of the\r\n12th irregular cavalry, employed by Haliburton, shewed bad symptoms\r\nduring the day; they did not charge the enemy with alacrity; and they\r\nappeared inclined to listen to the appeals made to their religious\r\nfeelings by the natives whom they were called upon to oppose. These\r\ntroopers belonged to the same regiment as those who afterwards mutinied\r\nat Segowlie.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Highlanders, this great and important Hindoo\r\ncity was frequently thrown into excitement by mutinies or reports of\r\nmutinies at other places. Rumours came in early in August, to the effect\r\nthat the irregular cavalry from Segowlie, after murdering their\r\nofficers, were on their way to Jounpoor, thirty-five miles from Benares,\r\nwith the intention of visiting Benares itself. The city contained at\r\nthat time only 300 English soldiers, none of whom could safely be spared\r\nto go out and confront the rebels. The civil lines at Benares comprised\r\nthat portion of the British station which contained the jails, the\r\ncourts of justice, and the residences of the commissioner, judge,\r\nsurgeon, &c.; it lay on the north of the Burnah River, while the\r\nmilitary lines were on the south, the two being connected by a bridge.\r\nThe civil station was thus peculiarly open to attack; and all that the\r\nauthorities could do for it was to post a party of soldiers and two guns\r\non the bridge; the prisoners were removed to the other side of the\r\nriver, the courts were abandoned, and all valuable property was taken\r\nfrom the civil station to that of the European military in the\r\ncantonment. The Rev. James Kennedy, chaplain of the station, has in a\r\nletter mentioned a fact which shews in how agitated a state the English\r\ncommunity at Benares were at that time;[69] illustrating in a striking\r\nway—as was more than once shewn during those turmoils in India—that the\r\npanic arising from an apprehended danger was often worse than the\r\nreality, paralysing the exertions of those who would have rendered good\r\nservice had actual fighting with an open enemy commenced. No sooner had\r\nthe dread of the Segowlie mutineers passed away, than an approach of\r\nthose from Dinapoor was threatened. Colonel Gordon, seeing the mischief\r\nthat would accrue from such a step, resolved to prevent it: he sent out\r\nhis handful of English soldiers, not merely to check the approach of the\r\nrebels, but to drive them from the district altogether. Koer Singh and\r\nhis rabble army did not wait for this conflict; they gave Benares a\r\n‘wide offing,’ and bent their steps towards Mirzapore. While the few\r\nEnglish soldiers were engaged on this duty, the sentinels left behind\r\nwere aided by the residents, headed by the judge—all keeping watch and\r\nward in turn, for the common safety.\r\n\r\nMirzapore, from its large size and great importance as a commercial\r\ncity, and its position on the banks of the Ganges between Benares and\r\nAllahabad, was often placed in considerable peril. No mutiny actually\r\noccurred there, but the city was repeatedly threatened by mutineers from\r\nother quarters, who, if successful, would certainly have been aided by\r\nall the budmashes of the place, and by many Mussulmans higher in station\r\nthan mere rabble. The European residents were perpetually on the watch.\r\nWhen a battery of artillery came up the Ganges _en route_ to Allahabad,\r\nthey earnestly entreated to be allowed to retain it for their own\r\nprotection; but Neill, the presiding genius at that time, would not\r\nlisten to this; Allahabad and Cawnpore must be thought of, and Mirzapore\r\nmust shift for itself. When the affairs at Segowlie and Dinapoor became\r\nknown, measures were taken for making some kind of stronghold at\r\nMirzapore. The Europeans intrenched the largest and strongest house\r\nbelonging to them, barricaded the streets, buried much property, placed\r\nother property in guarded boats on the river, and prepared for service\r\nfour small guns and five hundred rounds of ammunition. On numbering\r\nheads, they found 135 persons, all of whom had separate duties or posts\r\nassigned to them in the hour of need; they also secured provision for a\r\nmonth. This judicious line of policy answered the desired purpose: the\r\nDinapoor mutineers did not enter or molest Mirzapore. Those marauders\r\npassed westward along a line of route further removed from the Ganges,\r\nplundering as they went, and committing great devastation. On the 19th\r\nof August, a small force set out from Mirzapore to check those acts of\r\nviolence; but the Dinapoor men generally managed to keep beyond the\r\nreach of pursuers. A little later, when other regiments had mutinied in\r\nthe Saugor division, it was deemed prudent by the Calcutta authorities\r\nto send a portion of a Madras regiment, with two guns, to aid in the\r\nprotection of Mirzapore.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked, that along the line of country immediately\r\nadjacent to the eastern frontier of Oude, the influence of that\r\nturbulent province was made abundantly manifest during the period now\r\nunder notice. There were many zemindars near the border who maintained\r\nbodies of armed men on foot. A rebel chief of Sultanpore, one Mehudee\r\nHussein, appeared to direct the movements in that region; he was one\r\namong many who received direct commissions from the rebel authorities at\r\nLucknow, as chieftains expected to bring all their forces to bear\r\nagainst the British. This fact alone suffices to shew how completely\r\nOude was at that time in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nMr Grant, as lieutenant-governor of the Central Provinces, was called\r\nupon to exercise authority in the districts of Allahabad, Futtehpoor,\r\nCawnpore, Banda, and Humeerpoor, as well as in those of Goruckpore,\r\nGhazeepore, Jounpoor, Benares, and Mirzapore. When he settled down at\r\nBenares as his head-quarters, towards the close of August, he found that\r\nno civil business of the Company was carried on throughout the Doab,\r\nfrom Allahabad to Cawnpore, except at Allahabad itself. Neill and\r\nHavelock, by the gallant operations already described, obtained military\r\ncontrol of the great line of road; but their troops being lamentably\r\nsmall in number, they were nearly powerless beyond a few miles’ distance\r\non either side of that road; while the judges and magistrates, the\r\ncommissioners and collectors, had in only a few instances been able to\r\nresume their duties as civil servants of the Company. A large portion of\r\nthe population, driven from their villages either by the rebel sepoys or\r\nby the British, had not yet returned; and the fertile Doab had become,\r\nfor a time, almost a desert. Banda and Humeerpoor, British districts\r\nimmediately south of the Doab, were temporarily but completely given up;\r\nscarcely an Englishman remained within them, unless at hide-and-seek.\r\nSome of the petty chiefs, including the rajahs of Mundah and Churkarree,\r\nremained faithful. For a time, police in the service of the Company were\r\nable to retain command in that part of the Allahabad division which lay\r\nnorth of the Ganges; but the Oudians, as August advanced, crossed the\r\nfrontier, and gradually drove them away, thus further narrowing the belt\r\nof country within which the Company’s ‘raj’ was respected. Koer Singh,\r\nwhose name has so often been mentioned, was ruler for a time south of\r\nthe Jumna, with his Dinapoor mutineers; it was supposed that he had\r\noffered his services to Nena Sahib and to the King of Delhi, in hopes of\r\nsome substantial authority or advantages as a reward for his\r\nco-operation. This unsettled state of the region south of the Jumna\r\nplaced Lieutenant Osborne in an extraordinary position. He was, as we\r\nhave already seen (p. 180), British representative at the court of the\r\nRajah of Rewah, a place southwest of Allahabad—unimportant in itself,\r\nbut surrounded by districts every one of which was in a state of\r\nanarchy. Although the young rajah was friendly to the English, and aided\r\nthe lieutenant in his military plans for checking the mutineers, it was\r\nat all times uncertain how far the Rewah troops themselves could be\r\ndepended on. At a somewhat later date than that to which this chapter\r\nrelates, Osborne was living in a tent at Rewah, with no Englishman of\r\nany grade near him, and uncertain whether he could rely for an hour on\r\nthe fidelity of the native troops belonging to the rajah—defended by\r\nlittle else than his own indomitable force of character. Koer Singh and\r\nthe Dinapoor mutineers had asked the rajah either to join them, or to\r\nallow them to pass through his territory; he opposed it; his troops\r\nwished it; and thus the rajah and the lieutenant were thrown into\r\nantagonism with the Rewah troops.\r\n\r\nAnother region or division placed under Mr Grant’s\r\nlieutenant-governorship, Saugor, had witnessed very great disturbance\r\nduring the month of June, as has already been shewn;[70] and he found\r\nthe effects of that disturbance manifested in various ways throughout\r\nJuly and August. Rewah, Nowgong, Jhansi, Saugor, Jubbulpoor,\r\nHosungabad—all had suffered, either from the mutiny of troops at those\r\ntowns, or by the arrival of mutineers from other stations. Nagpoor was\r\nunder a different government or control; but it would not on that\r\naccount have escaped the perils of those evil days, had it not been that\r\nthe troops distributed over that province belonged to the Madras rather\r\nthan to the Bengal army—a most important difference, as we have had many\r\nopportunities of seeing. Mr Plowden, commissioner of Nagpoor, found it\r\ncomparatively easy to maintain his own territory in peace, for the\r\nreason just stated; and he used all possible exertion to bring up troops\r\nfrom Madras, and send them on to the Saugor province. His advice to\r\nMajor Erskine was, to disarm his Bengal troops at all the stations as\r\nsoon as he could obtain Madras troops; but the numbers of these latter\r\nwere not sufficient to permit the carrying out of such a plan. The\r\nSaugor territory, in having the peaceful part of Bengal on the east, and\r\nNagpoor territory on the south, was pretty safe from disturbance on\r\nthose frontiers; but having the Jumna region on the north, and the\r\nMahratta dominions on the west, it had many sources of disturbance in\r\nthose directions.\r\n\r\nIn the town and military station of Saugor, the state of affairs was\r\nvery remarkable. Brigadier Sage, in the month of June (p. 178), had\r\nconverted a large fort into a place of refuge for the ladies and\r\nfamilies of the officers, provisioned it for six months, placed the guns\r\nin position, and guarded the whole by a body of European gunners. This\r\nhe did, not because the native regiments at the station (31st and 42d B.\r\nN. I., and 3d irregular cavalry) had mutinied, but because they appeared\r\nvery unsettled, and received tempting offers from scheming chieftains in\r\nthe vicinity. The Calcutta authorities called upon the brigadier for an\r\nexplanation of the grounds on which he had shut up all the Europeans at\r\nSaugor, three hundred in number, in the fort, without any actual mutiny\r\nat that place; but on account of interrupted dâks and telegraphs, many\r\nweeks elapsed before the various official communications could take\r\nplace, and during those weeks the brigadier was responsible for the\r\nsafety of the residents. The remarkable feature in all this was, not\r\nthat the native troops should mutiny, or that the Europeans should live\r\nin a fortified residence, but that one regiment should remain faithful\r\nwhen others at the same spot repudiated allegiance. Early in July the\r\n42d and the cavalry endeavoured to incite the 31st to mutiny; but not\r\nonly did the latter remain true to their salt—they attacked and beat off\r\nthe rebels. On the 7th of the month a regular battle ensued; the 31st\r\nand some of the irregular cavalry attacking the 42d and the rest of the\r\nirregulars, and expelling them altogether from the station. ‘Well done,\r\n31st,’ said Major Erskine, when news of this event reached Jubbulpoor.\r\nIt was not merely that two infantry regiments were in antagonism; but\r\ntwo wings of one cavalry regiment were also at open war with each other.\r\nSo delighted were the English officers of the 31st at the conduct of\r\ntheir men, that they were eager to join in the fray; but the brigadier\r\nwould not allow this; he distrusted all these regiments alike, and would\r\nnot allow the officers to place themselves in peril. Many at Saugor\r\nthought that an excess of caution was herein exhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fort at Agra, from the river Jumna.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe other chief place in the province, Jubbulpoor, as shewn in a former\r\nchapter (p. 178), had been thrown into much perplexity in the month of\r\nJune by the news of mutiny at Jhansi and Nuseerabad; and Major Erskine,\r\ncommissioner of the province, sought how he might best prevent the\r\npestilence from spreading southeastward. He was at Jubbulpoor with the\r\n52d B. N. I. By a system of constant watchfulness he passed through that\r\nmonth without an outbreak. It was, however, a month of anxiety; for such\r\nof the ladies as did not retire to Kamptee for shelter, remained in\r\ncontinual dread near their husbands at Jubbulpoor, seldom taking off\r\ntheir clothes at night, and holding ready to flee at an hour’s warning—a\r\nstate of suspense entailing almost as much suffering as mutiny itself.\r\nEarly in July the Europeans fortified the Residency, and stored it with\r\nhalf a year’s provisions for thirty officers, thirty ladies and\r\nchildren, and several civilians; this was done on receipt of news that\r\nthe 42d native infantry and the 3d irregular cavalry had mutinied at\r\nSaugor. The Residency was made very strong, being converted from a house\r\ninto a fort; three officers were made garrison engineers, two acted as\r\ncommissariat officers, and all the rest took specific duties. It became\r\nnot only the stronghold, but the home, night and day, for nearly seventy\r\npersons. One of the officers who had the best means of knowing the\r\ntemper of the troops, while praising the 52d for still remaining\r\nfaithful under so many temptations from mutineers elsewhere, and while\r\npromising them extra pay for their fidelity, nevertheless acknowledged\r\nin a private letter that the regiment was a broken reed to rest upon.\r\n‘To tell the truth, I doubt the regiment being much better than any\r\nother. Circumstances alone keep the sepoys quiet. There is no treasure;\r\nwe merely collect enough to pay ourselves and them. If they plundered\r\nthe country, they could not take away the property; as the Bundelas\r\nwould loot and murder them.’ Speaking of the domestic economy of his\r\nbrother-officers and their families in the fortified Residency, he said:\r\n‘The 52d mess manage everything in the _Khana peena_ line (eating and\r\ndrinking). Ladies and gentlemen all dine together—a strange scene, quite\r\na barrack-life. In the evening a few of us drive out; others ride and\r\nwalk. We cannot afford above six or eight to leave the garrison\r\ntogether.’ July passed over in safety in Jubbulpoor. Early in August a\r\nrelieving force arrived from the Nagpoor territory, which, nearly\r\ntranquil itself, was able to forward trusty Madras troops to regions\r\ntroubled by the faithless sepoys of the Bengal army. This force\r\nconsisted of the 33d Madras native infantry, a squadron of the 4th\r\nMadras cavalry, 75 European artillerymen, and six guns. Major Erskine,\r\nthus reinforced, set forth to restore order at Dumoh, and to proceed\r\nthence to Saugor; to which place a Bombay column was expected to come,\r\nviâ Indore and Bhopal. This was a part of the policy determined on by\r\nthe government at that time. Calcutta could supply no troops except for\r\nthe Cawnpore and Lucknow region; the Punjaub could furnish\r\nreinforcements only for the siege of Delhi; and therefore it was\r\ndetermined that columns should start from the Madras and Bombay\r\npresidencies, comprising _no_ Bengal native troops, and should work\r\ntheir way inwards and upwards to the disturbed provinces, sweeping away\r\nmutineers wherever they encountered them. It was not until the latter\r\npart of August that the Madras movable column could safely leave the\r\nvicinity of Jubbulpoor for Dumoh and other disturbed stations, and even\r\nthen Major Erskine found it necessary to retain a portion of the troops.\r\nHow long the 52d remained faithful at Jubbulpoor we shall see in a\r\nfuture page; but it may here be remarked that the English officers of\r\nthe native regiments were at that time placed in a position of\r\ndifficulty hardly to be comprehended by others. They either trusted\r\ntheir sepoys, or felt a kind of shame in expressing distrust: if not in\r\nactual peril, they were at least mortified and vexed; for they felt\r\ntheir own honour touched when their regiments proved faithless.\r\n\r\nThe Bengal troops at Nagode appear to have remained untouched by mutiny\r\nuntil the 25th of August. On that day the 50th native infantry shewed\r\nsymptoms which caused some anxiety to the officers; two days afterwards\r\ndisturbances took place, and at a period somewhat beyond the limit to\r\nwhich this chapter is confined the bulk of the regiment mutinied, and\r\nmarched off to join mutineers elsewhere. About 250 of the sepoys\r\nremained true to their colours; they escorted their officers, and all\r\nthe ladies and children, safely from Nagode to Mirzapore. These\r\ndivergences among the men of the same regiment greatly complicate any\r\nattempts to elucidate the causes of the Indian mutiny generally. That\r\nthe sepoys were often excited by temporary and exceptional impulses, is\r\nquite certain; and such impulses were wholly beyond the power of the\r\nEuropeans correctly to estimate. There was one station at which a\r\nportion of a native regiment mutinied and shot an officer; the sepoys of\r\nhis company threw themselves upon his body and wept, and then—joined the\r\nmutineers!\r\n\r\nWe pass from the Saugor province to those which were nominally under the\r\ncontrol of Mr Colvin as lieutenant-governor of the Northwest\r\nProvinces—nominally, for, being himself shut up in Agra, he exercised\r\nscarcely any control beyond the walls of the fort. Of the Doab,\r\nsufficient has already been narrated to shew in what condition that\r\nfertile region was placed during the months of July and August. Where\r\nHavelock and Neill pitched their tents, there was British supremacy\r\nmaintained; but beyond the three cities of Allahabad, Futtehpoor, and\r\nCawnpore, and the high road connecting them, British power was little\r\nmore than a name. Higher up the Doab, at Etawah, Minpooree, Furruckabad,\r\nFutteghur, Allygurh, Bolundshuhur, &c., anarchy was paramount. Crossing\r\nthe Ganges into Oude, the cessation of British rule was still more\r\ncomplete. Scarcely an Englishman remained alive throughout the whole of\r\nOude, except in Lucknow; all who had not been killed had precipitately\r\nescaped. Almost every landowner had become a petty chieftain, with his\r\nfort, his guns, and his band of retainers. In no part of India, at no\r\ntime during the mutiny, was the hostility of the villagers more\r\nstrikingly shewn than in Oude: in other provinces the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages often aided the British troops on the march; but when Havelock,\r\nNeill, and Outram were in Oude, every village on the road had to be\r\nconquered, as if held by an avowed enemy. It has been often said that\r\nthe Indian outbreak was a revolt of soldiery, not a rebellion of a\r\npeople; but in Oude the contest was unquestionably with something more\r\nthan the military only. Whether their love for their deposed king was\r\nsincere or only professed, the Oudians exhibited much animosity against\r\nthe British. What the beleaguered garrison of Lucknow were doing, we\r\nshall see in the proper place.\r\n\r\nOf Agra city, and the fort or residency in which the Europeans were for\r\nsafety assembled, it will be remembered (p. 173) that after peaceably\r\nbut anxiously passing through the month of May, Mr Colvin, on the 1st of\r\nJune, found it necessary or expedient to disarm the 44th and 67th Bengal\r\nnative infantry—because two companies of those regiments had just\r\nmutinied near Muttra, and because the bulk of the regiments exhibited\r\nunmistakable signs of disaffection. This great and important city was\r\nthen left under the charge of the 3d European Fusiliers, a corps of\r\nvolunteer European cavalry under Lieutenant Greathed, and Captain\r\nD’Oyley’s field-battery of six guns. Most of the disarmed native troops\r\ndeserted, to swell the insurgent ranks elsewhere; and in the course of\r\nthe month the jail-guard deserted also. Thus June came to its end—the\r\nEuropean residents still remaining at large, but making certain\r\nprecautions for their common safety at night.\r\n\r\nWhen July arrived, however, the state of affairs became much more\r\nserious. The Europeans were forced into a battle, which ended in a\r\nnecessity for their shutting themselves up in the fort. The force was\r\nvery weak. The 3d Europeans only numbered about 600 men, the militia and\r\nvolunteers 200, and a few artillerymen belonging to the guns. Among the\r\nofficers present were several who had belonged to the Gwalior\r\nContingent, the various regiments and detachments of which had mutinied\r\nat Hattrass, Neemuch, Augur, Lullutpore, and Gwalior, on various days\r\nbetween the 28th of May and the 3d of July; these officers, having now\r\nno commands, were glad to render aid in any available way towards the\r\ndefence of Agra. Just at this critical time, when the approach of a\r\nhostile force was imminent, the Europeans were further troubled by the\r\nsudden mutiny of the Kotah Contingent. This force—consisting of\r\ninfantry, cavalry, and artillery, about 700 men in all—having been\r\ndeemed loyal and trustworthy, had been brought about a month previously\r\nto Agra from the southwest, and had during that time remained\r\ntrue—collecting revenue, burning disaffected villages, capturing and\r\nhanging rebels and mutineers. They were brought in from the vicinity\r\ntowards the close of June, to aid if necessary against the Neemuch\r\nmutineers, and were encamped half-way between the barracks and\r\ngovernment-house. Suddenly and unexpectedly, on the evening of the 4th,\r\nthe cavalry portion of the Contingent rose in revolt, fired at their\r\nofficers, killed their sergeant-major, and then marched off, followed by\r\nthe infantry and the artillery—all but a few gunners, who enabled the\r\nBritish to retain the two guns belonging to the Contingent. This revolt\r\nstartled the authorities, and necessitated a change of plan, for it had\r\nbeen intended to attack the Neemuch force that very evening; nay,\r\nmatters were even still worse, for the Kotah villains at once joined\r\nthose from Neemuch.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sunday the 5th of July (again Sunday!), an army of\r\nmutineers being known to be near at hand, a reconnoitring party was sent\r\nout to examine their position. The enemy were found to consist of about\r\n4000 infantry and 1000 cavalry, with ten or twelve guns; they comprised\r\nthe 72d B. N. I., the 7th Gwalior Contingent infantry, the 1st Bengal\r\nnative cavalry, the Malwah Contingent cavalry—which had joined the\r\nNeemuch men at Mehidpore—and fragments of other mutinied regiments,\r\ntogether with a very efficient artillery corps. The arrival of the\r\nNeemuch mutineers had for some time been expected; and as soon as it was\r\nknown, on the 3d, that the enemy had reached Futtehpore Sikri, about\r\ntwenty miles from Agra, the ladies and children, as well as many of the\r\ncivilians and traders, had as a measure of precaution abandoned their\r\nhouses in the city, and gone into the fort, which had been cleaned out,\r\nmade as habitable as possible, and largely supplied with provisions. The\r\nreconnoitring party returned to announce that the enemy were at\r\nShahgunje, a village close to the lieutenant-governor’s house, three\r\nmiles from the cantonment and four from the fort. The authorities at\r\nAgra resolved at once to go out and fight the enemy in open field;\r\nseeing that the native citizens had begun to think slightingly of their\r\nBritish masters, and that it was necessary to remove any suspicion of\r\nfear or timidity. The brigadier made up a force equal to about\r\none-eighth of the enemy’s numbers; it consisted of seven very weak\r\ncompanies of the 3d European Fusiliers, the militia and volunteers, and\r\na battery of artillery. The infantry were placed under Colonel Riddell,\r\nand the artillery under Captain D’Oyley. As to the volunteer cavalry, it\r\nwas made up of a curious medley of unemployed military officers,\r\ncivilians, merchants, and writers—all willing to share the common danger\r\nfor the common good; but with untrained horses, and without regular\r\ncavalry drill, they laboured under many disadvantages. About 200 men of\r\nthe 3d Europeans remained behind to guard the fort.\r\n\r\nAt noon, the opposing forces met. The enemy occupied a strong position\r\nbehind Shahgunje, with their guns flanking the village, and the cavalry\r\nflanking the guns. The British advanced in line, with their guns on each\r\nflank, the infantry in the middle, and the mounted militia and\r\nvolunteers in the rear. When about six hundred yards from the enemy, the\r\ninfantry were ordered to lie down, to allow the guns to do their work\r\nagainst the village, from behind the houses and walls of which the\r\nenemy’s riflemen opened a very destructive fire. It was a bad omen that\r\nwomen were seen in the village loading the rifles and muskets and\r\nhanding them to the mutineers to fire. For two hours an exchange of\r\nartillery-fire was kept up—extremely fierce; shrapnel shells,\r\nround-shot, and grape-shot, filling the air. A tumbril belonging to\r\nD’Oyley’s battery now blew up, disabling one of the guns; the enemy’s\r\ncavalry took advantage of this to gallop forward and charge; but the 3d\r\nEuropeans, jumping up, let fly a volley which effectually deterred them.\r\nMost of the officers and soldiers had wished during these two hours for\r\na bolder course of action—a capture of the enemy’s guns by a direct\r\ncharge of infantry. Then followed a rapid musketry-fire, and a chasing\r\nof the enemy out of the village by most of the infantry—the rest\r\nguarding the guns. Unfortunately another tumbril blew up, disabling\r\nanother gun; and, moreover, D’Oyley had used up all the ammunition which\r\nhad been supplied to him. Upon this the order was given for retreat to\r\nthe city; and the retreat was made—much to the mortification of the\r\ntroops, for they had really won a victory. The rebels, it was afterwards\r\nknown, were themselves out of ammunition, and were just about to retreat\r\nwhen they saw the retreat of the British; their infantry marched off\r\ntowards Muttra, but their cavalry and one gun harassed the British\r\nduring their return to the city. The artillery-fire of the mutineers\r\nduring the battle was spoken of with admiration even by those who were\r\nevery minute suffering from it; the native artillerymen had learned to\r\nuse effectively against us those guns which they had been paid and fed\r\nto use in our defence. If the cavalry had been equally effective, the\r\nBritish would probably have been cut off to a man. This battle of Agra\r\nwas a severe one to the British, for one-fourth of the small force were\r\nkilled or wounded. The officers suffered much: Majors Prendergast and\r\nThomas, Captains D’Oyley, Lamb, and Alexander, Lieutenants Pond,\r\nFellowes, Cockburn, Williams, and Bramley, were wounded, as well as many\r\ngentlemen belonging to the volunteer horse. The loss of Captain D’Oyley\r\nwas very much deplored, for he was a great favourite. While managing his\r\nguns, a shot struck him; he sat on the carriage, giving orders, in spite\r\nof his wound; but at last he fell, saying: ‘Ah, they have done for me\r\nnow! Put a stone over my grave, and say I died at my guns.’ He sank the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nThe British returned to Agra—not to the city, but to the fort; for three\r\nor four thousand prisoners had got loose during the day, and had begun\r\nto fire all the European buildings in the city. Officers and privates,\r\ncivilians and ladies, all who wrote of the events at Agra at that time,\r\ntold of the wild licence of that day and night. One eye-witness said:\r\n‘Hardly a house has escaped destruction; and such houses and their\r\ncontents as were not consumed by fire have been completely gutted and\r\ndestroyed by other means. In fact, even if we were to leave the fort\r\nto-morrow, there are not four houses in the place with roofs remaining\r\nunder which we could obtain shelter; and as for household property and\r\nother things left outside, there is not a single article in existence in\r\nserviceable order. The very doors and windows are removed, and every bit\r\nof wood torn out, so that nothing remains but the bare brick walls.\r\nThings are strewed about the roads and streets in every direction; and\r\nwherever you move you see broken chairs and tables, carriages in\r\nfragments, crockery, books, and every kind of property wantonly\r\ndestroyed.’ An officer of the 3d Europeans, after describing the battle,\r\nand the return of the little force to the fort, said: ‘Immediately\r\nafterwards the work of destruction commenced, the budmashes began to\r\nplunder, bungalows on every side were set on fire—one continued blaze\r\nthe whole night. I went out the next morning. ‘Twas a dreadful sight\r\nindeed; Agra was destroyed; churches, colleges, dwelling-houses,\r\nbarracks, everything burned.’\r\n\r\nBut they had something more to think of than the devastation in Agra\r\ncity; they had to contemplate their own situation in Agra Fort. Among\r\nthe number of Europeans, some had already borne strange adversities. One\r\nofficer had escaped, with his wife, in extraordinary guise, from Gwalior\r\nat the time of the mutiny of the Contingent at that place. He had been\r\nobliged to quit his wife at their bungalow in the midst of great danger,\r\nto hasten down to his regiment in the lines; and when he found his\r\ninfluence with his men had come to naught, and that shots were aimed at\r\nhim, three sepoys resolved to save him. They took off his hat, boots,\r\nand trousers, wrapped him in a horse-cloth, huddled him between them,\r\nand passed him off as a woman. They left him on the bank of a stream,\r\nand went to fetch his wife from a position of great peril. She being too\r\nweak to walk, they made up a horse-cloth into a sort of bag, tied it to\r\na musket, put her into it, shouldered the musket horizontally, and\r\ncarried her seven miles—her husband walking by her side, barefoot over\r\nsharp stones. After meeting with further assistance, they reached Agra\r\nsomewhat more in comfort. Another officer, who had likewise served in\r\nthe Gwalior Contingent, and who had seen much hard service before the\r\nmutiny of his corps compelled him to flee to Agra, counted up the wreck\r\nof his property after the battle of the 5th of July, and found it to\r\nconsist of ‘a coat, a shirt, the greater portion of a pair of breeches,\r\na pair of jack-boots, one sock, a right good sword’—and a cannon-ball\r\nthrough his leg; yet, recognising the useful truth that grumbling and\r\ncomplaining are but poor medicines in a time of trouble, he bore up\r\ncheerfully, and even cheered up Mr Colvin, who was at that time nearly\r\nworn to the grave by sickness and anxiety. An officer of the 3d\r\nEuropeans said in a letter: ‘I lost everything in the world.... The\r\nenemy went quietly off; but here we are; we can’t get out—no place to go\r\nto—nothing to do but to wait for assistance.’ And a few days afterwards\r\nhe added: ‘Here we are like rats in a trap; there are from four to five\r\nthousand people in this fort, military and civil, Eurasians,\r\nhalf-castes, &c.; and when we shall get out, is a thing to be guessed\r\nat.’ A surgeon of the recently mutinied Gwalior Contingent thus spoke of\r\nwhat he saw around him: ‘The scene in the fort for the first few days\r\nwas a trying one. All the native servants ran off. I had eleven in the\r\nmorning, and at night not one. Ladies were seen cooking their own food,\r\nofficers drawing and carrying water from the wells, &c. Many people were\r\nruined, having escaped with only their clothes on their backs. We are\r\nnow shut up here, five hundred fighting-men with ammunition, and about\r\nfour or five thousand altogether, eagerly awaiting the arrival of\r\nEuropean troops.’ A commissariat officer said: ‘Here we are all living\r\nin gun-sheds and casemates. The appearance of the interior is amusing,\r\nand the streets (of the fort) are named; we have Regent and Oxford\r\nStreets, the Quadrant, Burlington and Lowther Arcades, and Trafalgar\r\nSquare.’ The wife of one of the officers described her strange home: ‘We\r\nare leading a very unsettled ship-like life. No one is allowed to leave\r\nthe fort, except bodies of armed men. We are living in a place they call\r\nPalace Yard; it is a square, with a gallery round it, having open\r\narches; every married couple are allowed two arches.... It is no easy\r\nmatter to keep our arches clean and tidy.’ As all the Europeans in Agra\r\nwent to live in the fort, the number included the staff of the\r\n_Mofussilite_ (’Provincial European’) newspaper, one of the journals\r\nwhich had for some time been published in that city; the issue for the\r\n3d of July had been printed at the usual office of the paper; but none\r\nother appeared for twelve days, when a _Mofussilite_ was printed within\r\nthe fort itself.\r\n\r\nThere was no exaggeration in the accounts of the number of persons thus\r\nstrangely incarcerated. So completely were the Europeans and their\r\nnative servants at Agra shut up within the fort, and so much was that\r\nplace regarded as a refuge for those who had been forced to flee from\r\nother stations, that it gradually became crowded to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. On the 26th of July Mr Colvin determined to take a census of all\r\nthe persons who slept within the fort on that night; he did so, and\r\nfound them to amount to no less a number than 5845[71]—all of whom had\r\nto be supplied with their daily food under military or garrison\r\narrangements. More than 2000 of the number were children, who could\r\nrender little or no return for the services so anxiously demanded by and\r\nfor them. Provided, however, the supply of food and other necessaries\r\nwere sufficient, the danger of the position was not at all comparable to\r\nthat of Sir Hugh Wheeler at Cawnpore or of Brigadier Inglis at Lucknow.\r\nThe fort at Agra (see wood-cut, p. 109) was a very large structure, a\r\nsort of triangle whose sides extended from three to five eighths of a\r\nmile each; it contained numerous large buildings within the walls, of\r\nwhich the chief were the palace of Shahjehan, the Hall of Audience built\r\nby the same emperor, and the Moti Musjid or Pearl Mosque. All the\r\nbuildings were at once appropriated, in various ways, to the wants of\r\nthe enormous number of persons who sought shelter therein. The defences\r\nof the place, too, were greatly strengthened; sixty guns of heavy\r\ncalibre were mounted on the bastions; thirteen large mortars were placed\r\nin position; the powder-magazines were secured from accidental\r\nexplosion; the external defences were improved by the levelling of many\r\nhouses in the city which approached too near the fort; and preparations\r\nwere completed for blowing up the superb Jumma Musjid (p. 229) if any\r\nattempt were made by a hostile force to occupy it, seeing that its upper\r\nranges commanded the interior of the fort. The only insurgent force at\r\nthat time in possession of guns and mortars powerful enough to breach\r\nstrong walls was the Gwalior Contingent; and even if Scindia lost all\r\nhold over that force, Agra was provisioned for ten months, and had\r\nammunition enough to stand a whole year’s siege. An officer of a\r\nmutinied Gwalior regiment, writing from Agra after some weeks’\r\nconfinement, said: ‘Almost all the roads are closed, and it is only by\r\nsecret messengers and spies that we can get any intelligence of what is\r\ngoing on in the convulsed world around us. My letters from Scotland used\r\nto reach me in thirty days; now if I get one in eighty days I\r\ncongratulate myself on my good-luck.... As for this fort, we can hold it\r\nagainst any number for months; our only fear being for the women and\r\nchildren, who would suffer much, and of whom we have some three\r\nthousand. The health of the troops, &c., is, thank God, excellent, and\r\nthe wounded are doing well.’ Nevertheless, with all their sense of\r\nsecurity, the Europeans within the fort had enough to do to maintain\r\ntheir cheerfulness. On the day and night of the 5th of July, property\r\nhad been burned and despoiled in the city to an enormous amount; and\r\nmost of this had belonged to the present inmates of the fort. The\r\nmerchants had been prosperous, their large shops had abounded with the\r\nmost costly articles of necessity and luxury—and now nearly all was\r\ngone. The military officers had of course less to lose, but their\r\ndeprivation was perhaps still more complete.\r\n\r\nThroughout July and August the state of affairs thus continued at Agra.\r\nThe danger was small, but the discomforts of course numerous. Mr Colvin\r\nsent repeated applications for a relieving force. There was, however,\r\nnone to aid him. His health failed greatly, and he did not bear up\r\nagainst the anxieties of his position with the cheerful firmness\r\nexhibited by many other of the officials at that trying time. Brigadier\r\nPolwhele, former military commandant, was superseded by Colonel Cotton\r\nwhen the account of the battle of the 5th of July became known at\r\nCalcutta. Occasional sallies were made from the fort, to punish isolated\r\nbodies of rebels at Futtehpore Sikri, Hattrass, and Allygurh; but the\r\nEuropean troops were too few to be very effective in this way. The most\r\nnote-worthy exploit took place during the latter half of August, when Mr\r\nColvin requested Colonel Cotton to organise a small force for driving\r\nsome mutineers from Allygurh. Major Montgomery set forth with this\r\nminiature army,[72] reached Hattrass on the 21st, and there learned that\r\n6000 mutineers, under Ghose Mahomed Khan, náib or lieutenant of the King\r\nof Delhi, were prepared to resist him at Allygurh. Montgomery marched\r\nfrom Allygurh to Sarsnee on the 23d, rested for the night in an indigo\r\nfactory and other buildings, and advanced on the following day to\r\nAllygurh. There ensued a sharp conflict of two hours’ duration, in\r\ngardens and enclosures outside the town; it ended in the defeat and\r\ndispersion of the enemy, who left 300 dead on the field. The battle was\r\na gallant affair, worthy of ranking with those of Havelock; for\r\nMontgomery contended against twenty times his own number; and, moreover,\r\nmany of the troops among the enemy were Ghazees or fanatic Mussulmans\r\nwho engaged fiercely in hand-to-hand contests with some of his troops.\r\nHis detachment of men was too small to enable him to enter and reoccupy\r\nAllygurh: he was obliged to leave that place in the hands of the rebels,\r\nand to return to Hattrass; but having replenished his stock of\r\nammunition and supplies, he advanced again to Allygurh, held it for\r\nseveral days, and left a detachment there when he took his departure.\r\n\r\nTaking leave for the present of Agra, we may briefly state that almost\r\nevery other city and station in that part of India was in the hands of\r\nthe enemy during the months of July and August. Delhi was still under\r\nsiege; but there was scarcely a British soldier in any part of the Delhi\r\ndivision except in the siege-camp before Delhi itself. In the Agra\r\ndivision, as we have just seen, British influence extended very little\r\nfurther than the walls of Agra Fort. In the Meerut division, the station\r\nat that town was still held; the military lines were strongly fortified,\r\nand supplied with provisions to an extent sufficient to remove immediate\r\nanxiety. The region between Delhi and the Sutlej, containing Hansi,\r\nHissar, Sirsa, and other towns, was fortunately kept in some order by a\r\ncolumn under General Van Cortlandt, which moved quickly from place to\r\nplace, and put down a swarm of petty chieftains who were only too ready\r\nto take advantage of the mutinies of the native troops. In the Rohilcund\r\ndivision scarcely a town, except up in the hills, remained under British\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nWelcome as was the refuge which the wives and children of officers found\r\nat the hill-stations in the Rohilcund and Cis-Sutlej provinces, their\r\ntranquillity was frequently disturbed by the movements of rebels. Early\r\nin August the civil commissioner of Kumaon received intelligence that an\r\nattack was contemplated on Nynee Tal by Kalee Khan, one of the myrmidons\r\nof Khan Bahadoor Khan of Bareilly, who had 3000 rabble with him; the\r\nplunder and destruction of the station being the main objects in view.\r\nCaptain Ramsey, commandant at Nynee Tal, and Colonel M’Causland,\r\ncommanding the troops in the various stations of Kumaon, at once\r\ndetermined to remove the ladies and children, two hundred in number,\r\nfrom Nynee Tal to Almora, further away from Bareilly: this was done; and\r\nthen the colonel prepared to meet the mutineers, and confront them with\r\na detachment of the 66th Goorkhas. Kalee Khan set forth on his mission;\r\nbut when he heard that M’Causland was calmly waiting for him, he changed\r\nhis plan, returned to Bareilly, and avoided a conflict, the probable\r\nresult of which presented itself very clearly to his mind. At Nynee Tal,\r\nat Almora, at Mussouree, at Simla, and at other places among the cool\r\nhilly regions, ladies and children were assembled in large numbers, some\r\nwith their husbands and fathers, but many sent away from scenes of\r\nstrife in which those dear to them were compelled to engage. It was not\r\nall idle hopelessness with them. Englishwomen can always find some\r\nuseful service to render, and are always ready to render it. A lady,\r\nwriting from Mussouree on the 9th of August, said: ‘We are very busy\r\nworking flannel clothes for our army before Delhi. They are very badly\r\noff for these things; and being so much exposed at such a season of the\r\nyear, and in such a proverbially unhealthy locality, and fighting as\r\nthey have done so nobly, they really deserve to be provided for by us.’\r\nAfter enumerating the sums subscribed towards this object from various\r\nquarters, the writer went on to say: ‘Mrs —— and myself are constantly\r\nat work; for, with the exception of our tailors, and one or two others\r\ngiven up to us by ladies, we can get none.... Wonderful to say, though I\r\nnever did such a thing in my life before, I have the management of our\r\nportion of the business, which keeps me employed from early morning till\r\nlate at night. We meet, with several other ladies, at ——‘s house every\r\nday, with as many tailors as we can collect, and stitch away.’\r\n\r\nThe great and important country of the Punjaub, though not free from\r\ndisturbance, was kept pretty well under control during July and August,\r\nby the energy of Sir John Lawrence and the other officers of the\r\nCompany. We have seen[73] that on the 13th of May the 16th, 26th, and\r\n49th regiments of Bengal native infantry, and the 8th Bengal cavalry,\r\nwere disarmed at Meean Meer, a cantonment six miles from the city of\r\nLahore; that on the same day the 45th and 57th native infantry mutinied\r\nat Ferozpore, while the 10th cavalry was disarmed; that during the same\r\nweek, Umritsir, Jullundur, and Phillour were only saved from mutiny by\r\nthe promptness and spirit of some of the officers; that on the 20th, the\r\n55th native infantry mutinied at Murdan in the Peshawur Valley; that\r\nconsequent upon this, the 24th, 27th, and 51st native infantry, and the\r\n5th native cavalry, were on the 22d of the month disarmed in the station\r\nof Peshawur itself; that early in June, the 4th native regiment was\r\ndisarmed at Noorpore; that on the 6th, the 36th and 61st native\r\ninfantry, and the 6th native cavalry, mutinied at Jullundur, and marched\r\noff towards Phillour; that the 3d native cavalry, at the last-named\r\nstation, mutinied on the following day, unable to resist the temptation\r\nthrown out to them by those from Jullundur; that the 14th native\r\ninfantry mutinied at Jelum on the 7th of July, maintaining a fierce\r\nfight with a British detachment before their departure; that on the same\r\nday the 58th native infantry, and two companies of the 14th, were\r\ndisarmed at Rawul Pindee; that on the 9th, the 46th native infantry, and\r\na wing of the 9th native cavalry, mutinied at Sealkote, and decamped\r\ntowards Delhi; that towards the close of July, the disarmed 26th\r\nmutinied at Meean Meer, murdered Major Spencer, and marched off with the\r\nintention of strengthening the insurgents at Delhi; that on the 19th of\r\nAugust, a portion of the disarmed 10th cavalry mutinied at Ferozpore;\r\nand that on the 28th of the same month, the disarmed 51st mutinied at\r\nPeshawur, fled to the hills, and were almost annihilated. It thus\r\nappears that about a dozen regiments mutinied in the Punjaub between the\r\nmiddle of May and the end of August; that some of these had been\r\npreviously disarmed; and that others had been disarmed without having\r\nmutinied.\r\n\r\nA few additional words may be given here relating to the partial mutiny\r\nat Meean Meer. The four native regiments at that station, disarmed on\r\nthe 13th of May, remained in their lines until the 30th of July,\r\npeaceful and without arms. On the last-named day, however, it became\r\nknown to the authorities that the men meditated flight. Major Spencer of\r\nthe 26th, and two native officers, were killed by the sepoys of that\r\nregiment on that day—with what weapons does not clearly appear. The\r\nmurder of the unfortunate English officer deranged the plans of the\r\ntroops; all were to have decamped at a given signal; but now only the\r\n26th made off, leaving the other three regiments in their lines. The\r\nauthorities, not well knowing whither the fugitives had gone, sent off\r\nthree strong parties of mounted police, to Umritsir, Hurrekee, and\r\nKussoor, the three routes towards the Sutlej. The men, however, had gone\r\nnorthward; but within a few days they were almost entirely destroyed,\r\nfor the villagers aided the police in capturing or shooting the\r\nmiserable fugitives as they marched or ran in field and jungle.\r\n\r\nWithout going over in detail any proceedings already recorded, it may be\r\nconvenient to condense in a small space a narrative of Brigadier-general\r\nNicholson’s operations in the later days of June and the first half of\r\nJuly with a movable column placed under his command by Sir John\r\nLawrence. Having disarmed the 33d and 35th B. N. I., for reasons which\r\nappeared to him amply sufficient, he began on the 27th of June to\r\nretrace his steps from Phillour, and on the 5th of July he encamped at\r\nUmritsir, to overawe the 59th B. N. I., and to hold a central position\r\nwhence he might march to any threatened point east or west. On the 7th,\r\nhearing of the mutiny of the 14th native infantry at Jelum, and\r\nreceiving no satisfactory evidence that Colonel Ellice had been able to\r\nfrustrate or defeat the mutineers, he at once resolved on a measure of\r\nprecaution. He disarmed the 59th on the following morning—with very\r\ngreat regret; for he had nothing to censure in the conduct of the men;\r\nhe took that step solely on account of the peril which, at such a time,\r\nthreatened any station containing Bengal troops without British; and he\r\nadded in his dispatch: ‘I beg very strongly to recommend this corps,\r\nboth as regards officers and men, to the favourable consideration of\r\ngovernment.’ On the 10th, receiving intelligence that the 46th native\r\ninfantry, and a wing of the 9th native cavalry, had mutinied at\r\nSealkote, Nicholson at once disarmed the other wing of the same cavalry\r\nregiment, which formed part of his column. In the course of the same day\r\nhe learned that the Sealkote mutineers intended to march eastward,\r\nthrough Goordaspore, Noorpore, Hoshyapoor, and Jullundur, to\r\nDelhi—endeavouring to tempt to mutiny, on their way, the 2d irregular\r\ncavalry at Goordaspore, the 4th native infantry at Noorpore, and the\r\n16th irregular cavalry at Hoshyapoor. The problem thence arose—could\r\nNicholson intercept these mutineers before they reached Goordaspore? He\r\nfound he would have to make a forced march of forty miles in a northeast\r\ndirection to effect this. He did so, by energetic exertions, in twenty\r\nhours. He came up with them at the Trimmoo ford over the Ravee, nine\r\nmiles from Goordaspore, on the 12th of July—his force now consisting of\r\nH.M. 52d foot, 184 men of the Punjaub infantry, a company of the police\r\nbattalion, a few irregular horse, a troop of artillery, and three guns.\r\nNicholson defeated them after a short but sharp conflict on the river’s\r\nbank; but his horsemen were not trustworthy, and he could not pursue the\r\nenemy. About 300 mutineers, with one gun, took post on an island in the\r\nriver; these, by a well-planned movement, were almost entirely\r\nannihilated on the 16th—and the ‘Sealkote mutineers’ disappeared from\r\nthe scene. It was with justice that the active leader thanked his troops\r\non the following day: ‘By a forced march of unusual length, performed at\r\na very trying season of the year, the column has been able to preserve\r\nmany stations and districts from pillage and plunder, to save more than\r\none regiment from the danger of too close a contact with the mutineers;\r\nwhile the mutineer force itself, 1100 strong, notwithstanding the very\r\ndesperate character of the resistance offered by it, has been utterly\r\ndestroyed or dispersed.’\r\n\r\nLet us now, as in a former chapter, glance at the state of affairs in\r\nthe vast region of India southward of the Ganges, the Jumna, and the\r\nSutlej—passing over Sinde without special mention, as being nearly free\r\nfrom disturbing agencies. The reader will remember[74] that among the\r\nvarious states, provinces, and districts of Nagpoor, Hyderabad,\r\nCarnatic, Madras, Bombay, Holkar, Scindia, Rajpootana, &c., some became\r\nsubject to anarchy in certain instances during the month of\r\nJune—especially the three last-named states; and we have now to shew\r\nthat this anarchy continued, and in some cases extended, during July and\r\nAugust; but it will also be made manifest that the amount of insurgency\r\nbore a very small ratio to that in the stormy districts further north.\r\n\r\nOf Southwestern Bengal, Orissa, and Nagpoor, it is scarcely necessary\r\nhere to speak. The native troops were not influenced by a hostility so\r\nfierce, a treachery so villainous, as those in Hindostan proper; there\r\nwere not so many zemindars and petty chieftains who had been wrought up\r\nto irritation by the often questionable appropriations and annexations\r\nof the Company; and there was easier access for the troops of the Madras\r\npresidency, who, as has already been more than once observed, had small\r\nsympathy with the petted sepoys and sowars of the larger presidency. The\r\nmutinies or attempts at mutiny, in these provinces, were of slight\r\ncharacter during July and August. Mr Plowden, commissioner of Nagpoor,\r\nwas enabled, with troops sent by Lord Harris from Madras, not only to\r\nmaintain British supremacy throughout that large country (nearly equal\r\nin size to England and Scotland combined), but also to assist Major\r\nErskine in the much more severely threatened territory of Saugor and\r\nNerbudda, lying between Nagpoor and the Jumna.\r\n\r\nThe Madras presidency remained almost entirely at peace. Not only did\r\nthe native troops hold their faith with the government that fed and paid\r\nthem, but they cheerfully volunteered to serve against the mutinous\r\nBengal sepoys in the north. On the 3d of July the governor in council\r\nissued a proclamation, announcing that several regiments had expressed\r\ntheir desire to be employed in the Northwest Provinces or wherever else\r\ntheir services might be required; that thanks would be publicly awarded\r\nto the native officers and men of all the regiments who had thus come\r\nforward; and that the favourable attention of the supreme government\r\ntowards them would be solicited. The corps that thus proffered their\r\nservices were the 3d, 11th, 16th, and 27th Madras native infantry, the\r\n3d and 8th Madras native cavalry, a company of native foot-artillery, a\r\ntroop of native horse-artillery, and a detachment of native sappers and\r\nminers. Many of these afterwards rendered good service in the battles\r\nwhich distinguished—and we may at the same time add devastated—Northern\r\nand Central India. Four days afterwards, Lord Harris was able to\r\nannounce that other regiments—the 17th, 30th, 36th, and 47th native\r\ninfantry, and the 5th native cavalry—had in a similar way come forward\r\n‘to express their abhorrence of the traitorous conduct of the mutineers\r\nof the Bengal army, and their desire to be employed wherever their\r\nservices may be required.’ Besides thus providing faithful soldiers, the\r\ngovernor of Madras was in a position, at various times during July and\r\nAugust, to send large supplies of arms, ammunition, and camp-equipage,\r\nfrom Madras to Calcutta. In the city of Madras itself, and in the\r\nvarious southern provinces and countries of Carnatic, Tanjore,\r\nTravancore, Canara, Malabar, and Mysore, the same exemption from mutiny\r\nwas experienced. There were, it is true, discontents and occasional\r\nplottings, but no formidable resistance to the British power. Many\r\npersons there were who, without being rebels or open malcontents,\r\nthought that the Company had dealt harshly with the native princes, and\r\nwere on that account deterred from such hearty sympathy with the British\r\nas they might otherwise possibly have manifested. An officer in the\r\nMadras army, writing when the mutiny was four months old, stated that in\r\nthe previous February, when that terrible movement had not yet\r\ncommenced, he went one day to take a sketch of a mosque, or rather a\r\ncollection of mosques, in the suburbs of Madras—tombs that were the\r\nmemorials of past Mussulman greatness. His conversation with an old man\r\nof that faith[75] left upon his mind the impression that there was a\r\nsentiment of injury borne, rights violated, nationality disregarded,\r\nconveyed in the words of his temporary companion.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one occurrence in the Madras presidency which gave\r\nrise to much uneasiness. The 8th Madras native cavalry was ordered to\r\nmarch from Bangalore to Madras, and there embark for Calcutta. On\r\narriving at a place about twenty-five miles from Madras, on the 17th of\r\nAugust, the men put forward a claim for the rates of pay, batta, and\r\npension which existed before the year 1837, and which were more\r\nfavourable than those of subsequent introduction. Such a claim, put\r\nforward at such a moment, was very perplexing to the officers; they\r\nhastened to Madras, and obtained the consent of the government to make\r\nconciliatory offers to the men. After a further march of thirteen miles\r\nto Poonamallee, the troopers again stopped, and declared they would not\r\ngo forth ‘to war against their countrymen.’ This being an act of\r\ninsubordination which of course could not be overlooked, two guns and\r\nsome artillerymen were promptly brought forward; the 8th cavalry were\r\nunhorsed and disarmed, and sent to do dismounted duty at Arcot; while\r\ntheir horses were forthwith shipped to Calcutta, where such accessions\r\nwere specially valuable. The affair caused great excitement at Madras;\r\nthe volunteers were warned that their services were to be available at a\r\nmoment’s notice; patrols were placed in the streets by day and night;\r\nand guns were planted in certain directions. Happily, the prompt\r\ndisarming of this turbulent regiment prevented the poison from spreading\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SKETCH MAP\r\n  _TO ILLUSTRATE_\r\n  HAVELOCK’S OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n  _DURING JULY & AUGUST_.\r\n  1857\r\n\r\n  _From a Government Survey._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBombay, like its sister presidency Madras, was affected only in a slight\r\ndegree by the storms that troubled Bengal and the northwest. The Bombay\r\ntroops, though, as the sequel shewed, not altogether equal in fidelity\r\nto those of Madras, did nevertheless pass through the perilous ordeal\r\nvery creditably—rendering most valuable service in Rajpootana and other\r\nregions of the north. There was a wealthy and powerful native community\r\nat Bombay—that of the Parsees—which was nearly at all times ready to\r\nsupport the government, and which greatly strengthened the hands of Lord\r\nElphinstone by so doing. It consisted of merchants, shipowners, and\r\nbankers, many of whom had made large fortunes in the ordinary way of\r\ntrade. Those Parsees may always be distinguished from the other natives\r\nof India by something peculiar in their names—Jamsetjee, Nowrojee,\r\nCursetjee, Bomanjee, Rustomjee, Hormuzjee, Luxmonjee, Maneekjee,\r\nSorabjee, Furdoonjee, Soonderjee, Ruttonjee, Wassewdewjee, Dhakjee, &c.\r\nThe Parsees are the descendants of those Persians who, refusing to\r\nexchange the religion of Zoroaster for that of Mohammed, migrated to\r\nIndia more than a thousand years ago; those still remaining in Persia\r\nare few in number and degraded in position; but those at Bombay are\r\nwealthy and active, and bear a high character both morally and\r\nintellectually. The property in the island on which the city of Bombay\r\nstands is chiefly in the hands of the Parsees; and it is usual for the\r\nEuropean commercial firms of Bombay to have a Parsee capitalist as one\r\nof the partners. Although wearing the Asiatic costume, and adhering very\r\nrigidly to their religious customs and observances, the Parsees\r\nassimilate more than other eastern people to the social customs of\r\nEuropeans: they nearly all speak English, and have it carefully taught\r\nto their children. There is something remarkable in a Parsee holding the\r\ndignity of a baronet, in English fashion; such was the case a few years\r\nago, when a Parsee of enormous wealth, and of liberality as great as his\r\nwealth, was made by Queen Victoria a baronet under the title of Sir\r\nJamsetjee Jejeebhoy. It will at once be seen that such a body as the\r\nParsees, having little or no sympathy with Hindustani sepoys, and having\r\ntheir worldly interests much bound up with the English, were likely to\r\nbe sources of strength instead of weakness in troubled times. They\r\nheaded an address to Lord Elphinstone, signed by about four hundred\r\nnatives of various castes and creeds.[76] It was not more adulatory, not\r\nmore filled with enthusiastic professions of loyalty, than many\r\naddresses presented to Viscount Canning in Bengal; but it more nearly\r\ncorresponded with the conduct of those who signed it.\r\n\r\nIf Bombay city, however, remained nearly undisturbed during July and\r\nAugust, there were symptoms that required close watching in various\r\ndistricts to the north, south, and east. Kolapore, one of the places\r\nhere adverted to, is distant about a hundred and eighty miles south from\r\nBombay. It is the chief place of a raj or state of the same name, and\r\nwas in the last century a scene of frequent contest between two Mahratta\r\nprinces, the Peishwa of Satara and the Rajah of Kolapore, each of whom\r\nstruggled against the claims to superiority put forth by the other.\r\nAbout half a century ago began those relations towards the Company’s\r\ngovernment, which, as in so many other parts of India, led to the\r\ngradual extinction of the rule of the native rajah; the British govern\r\n‘in the name of the rajah,’ but the rajah’s authority remains in\r\nabeyance. The military force belonging specially to the state, at the\r\ntime of the mutiny, amounted to about ten thousand men of all arms. It\r\nwas, however, among the Company’s own troops that the disaffection above\r\nadverted to took place. The 27th Bombay native infantry, without any\r\nprevious symptoms of disaffection, suddenly mutinied at Kolapore, on the\r\nday of a festival called the Buckree Eed (1st of August); or rather, a\r\nportion of the regiment mutinied. While the officers were assembled in\r\nthe billiard-room of their mess-house on the evening of that day, a\r\njemadar rushed in and informed them that some of the sepoys had risen in\r\nrevolt; the officers hastened out; when three of them, ignorant of the\r\nplace, or bewildered in the darkness, went astray, and were taken and\r\nmurdered by the mutineers. The mother of the jemadar went to the house\r\nof Major Rolland, the commanding officer, to warn the ladies of their\r\ndanger, and to afford them means of escape. No sooner had the ladies\r\nhurried away, than the house was surrounded by mutineers, who,\r\ndisappointed at finding it empty, revenged themselves by slaughtering\r\nthe old woman. After plundering the treasury of forty thousand rupees,\r\nthe mutineers retired to a religious edifice in the town, and marched\r\noff in early morning by the Phoonda Ghat towards Wagotun, on the coast.\r\nThe native commissioned officers of the regiment remained faithful; none\r\nof them accompanied the mutineers. The outbreak ended most disastrously\r\nto those concerned in it. When they got some distance from Kolapore,\r\nthey found themselves without food and without friends; and gradually\r\nnearly all were destroyed by detachments sent against them, headed by\r\nMajor Rolland and Colonel Maughan, the latter of whom was British\r\nresident at Kolapore. There were circumstances which justify a belief\r\nthat this was not so much a mutiny after the Bengal type, as an\r\nassociation of the bad men of the regiment for purposes of plunder.\r\n\r\nThis event at Kolapore threw the whole of the south Mahratta country\r\ninto a ferment. At Poonah, Satara, Belgaum, Dharwar, Rutnagherry, Sawunt\r\nWaree, and other places, the threads of a Mohammedan conspiracy were\r\ndetected; and fortunately the germs of insurrection were nipped in the\r\nbud. When Mr Rose, commissioner of Satara, found that the deposed royal\r\nfamily of that state were engaged in plots and intrigues, he took a\r\nsmall but reliable English force, entered Satara before daylight on the\r\n6th of August, surrounded the palace, and ordered the rajah and the\r\nranees to prepare for instant departure. Resistance being useless, the\r\nroyal prisoners entered phaetons which had been brought for that\r\npurpose, and before eight o’clock they were on the way to Poonah—to be\r\nkept under the eye of the Bombay authorities until the political\r\natmosphere should become clearer, in a navy depôt on an island near\r\nBombay city. A plot was about the same time discovered at Poonah,\r\nconcerted between the moulvies of that place and of Belgaum, for\r\nmassacring the Europeans and native Christians of those stations;\r\nletters were intercepted at the Poonah post-office, which enabled the\r\nauthorities to shun the coming evil. Many arrests of Mussulman\r\nconspirators were made; and it was then found that matters had gone so\r\nfar as a preparation to blow up the arsenal at Poonah. The authorities\r\nat once disarmed the natives of the cantonment bazaar. From most of the\r\nout-stations, being troubled by these events, the English ladies were\r\nsent by military escort to Bombay or to Poonah. Among other measures of\r\nprecaution, the remaining companies of the 27th native regiment were\r\ndisarmed at Kolapore and Rutnagherry; and examples of the terrible\r\n‘blowing away from guns’ were resorted to, to check this incipient\r\nrevolution. The 28th Bombay native infantry, stationed at Dharwar, and\r\nthe 29th, stationed at Belgaum, had been raised at the same time as the\r\n27th; and a few symptoms of insubordination were manifested by sepoys of\r\nthose regiments; but the timely arrival of a European regiment restored\r\nquiet. The English were greatly exasperated when the fact came to light\r\nthat one of the conspirators detected at Belgaum was a moonshee who had\r\nbeen receiving a hundred and fifty rupees per month for instructing\r\nofficers of regiments in Hindustani.\r\n\r\nThe three presidencies were all anxiously watching the state of feeling\r\nin the large and important country of Hyderabad, the dominions of the\r\nNizam; for that country borders on Nagpoor on the northeast; while on\r\nthe southeast and on the west it is conterminous with districts\r\nbelonging to Madras and to Bombay respectively. Its two largest cities,\r\nHyderabad in the southeast portion, and Aurungabad in the northwest,\r\ncontained many English families belonging to military and civil servants\r\nof the Company; or at least the families were at stations not far from\r\nthose cities. By the terms of various treaties between the Nizam and the\r\nCompany, the latter had the right of maintaining a large military\r\ncantonment at Secunderabad, a few miles north of Hyderabad city. This\r\ncantonment was three miles in length, and was well provided with\r\nofficers’ bungalows and mess-houses, European barracks, sepoy lines,\r\nhorse-artillery lines, foot-artillery barracks, native bazaars,\r\nparade-ground, hospitals, arsenal, and all the other requisites for a\r\nlarge military station. The cavalry lines were two miles north of the\r\ncantonment, at Bowenpilly. The military station for the troops belonging\r\nto the Nizam as an independent sovereign was at Bolarum, somewhat\r\nfurther away from Hyderabad, but still within easy reach of\r\nSecunderabad. At the time of the mutiny the British resident at\r\nHyderabad was placed in a position of some difficulty. Although there\r\nwas a large force at Secunderabad, it comprised scarcely any British\r\ntroops; and therefore, if trouble arose, he could only look to defence\r\nfrom natives by natives. The capital of the Deccan, or the Nizam’s\r\nterritory, comprised within itself many elements of insecurity. The\r\ngovernment and a large portion of the inhabitants were Mohammedan; the\r\nrabble of the city was numerous and ruthless; the Nizam’s own army was\r\nformed on the same model as the contingents which had so generally\r\nmutinied in Hindostan; the Company’s own forces, as just mentioned, were\r\nalmost entirely native; and the city and province were at all times\r\nthronged with predatory bands of Rohillas, Afghans, Arabs, and other\r\nmercenaries, in the pay of the nobles and jaghiredars of the Hyderabad\r\ncourt. It is almost certain that if the Nizam had turned against us,\r\nSouthern India would have been in a blaze of insurrection; but he was\r\nfaithful; and his chief minister, Salar Jung, steadily supported him in\r\nall measures calculated to put down disturbance. The news of the\r\nrebel-triumph at Delhi set in tumultuous motion the turbulent Mussulmans\r\nof Hyderabad; and it has been well observed that ‘a single moment of\r\nindecision, a single act of impolicy, a single false step, or a single\r\nadmission of weakness, might have turned Hyderabad into a Lucknow and\r\nmade a second Oude of the Deccan.’ The Nizam, his prime minister, and\r\nthe British resident, all brought sagacity and firmness to bear on the\r\nduties of their respective offices; and thus the Deccan and Southern\r\nIndia were saved. What might have been the case under other\r\ncircumstances was foreshadowed by the events of the 17th of July. On the\r\npreceding day, intelligence was received at the Residency, which stands\r\nclear of the city, but at the distance of some few miles from the\r\nBritish cantonment at Secunderabad, that the mob in the city was much\r\nexcited, and that a scheme was on foot to press the Nizam to attack the\r\nResidency. Notice was sent from the Residency to Salar Jung, and\r\npreparations were made. Early in the evening on the 17th, a Rohilla\r\nrabble stole forth from the city, and made for the Residency. An express\r\nwas at once sent off to cantonments for aid; and in the meantime the\r\nguard, with three guns, went out to attack the insurgents. Captain\r\nHolmes plied his grape-shot effectively from the three guns; and when\r\ncavalry and horse-artillery arrived from Secunderabad, the Rohillas\r\nreceived a total discomfiture. This was almost the only approach to a\r\nmutiny that occurred in the portion of the Deccan near the Carnatic\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nAurungabad, on the Bombay side of the Nizam’s dominions, was, in regard\r\nto mutinies, less important than Hyderabad, because more easily\r\naccessible for European troops; but more important, in so far as the\r\nsepoy regiments of Malwah and Rajpootana were nearer at hand to be\r\naffected by evil temptation. The city is about seventy miles distant\r\nfrom Ahmednuggur, and a hundred and seventy from Bombay. Uneasiness\r\nprevailed here so early as June. The 1st cavalry and the 2d infantry, of\r\nthe corps called the Hyderabad Contingent, were stationed at Aurungabad;\r\nand of these, the former shewed signs of disaffection. Captain Abbott,\r\ncommanding the regiment, found on the morning of the 13th that his men\r\nwere murmuring and threatening, as if unwilling to act against mutineers\r\nelsewhere; indeed, they had sworn to murder their officers if any\r\nattempt were made to employ them in that way. Fortunately, the\r\nressaldars—each being a native captain of a troop of cavalry, and there\r\nbeing therefore as many ressaldars in a regiment as there were troops or\r\ncompanies—remained faithful; and Captain Abbott, with Lieutenant Dowker,\r\nwere enabled to discuss with these officers the state of the regiment.\r\nThe ressaldars assured the captain that many of the troopers had begun\r\nto talk loudly about the King of Delhi as their rightful ruler. The\r\nresident at the court of the Nizam, through the military secretary,\r\nMajor Briggs, advised Captain Abbott—seeing that no aid could be\r\nexpected from any other quarter—to speak in as conciliatory a tone as\r\npossible to the men, and to promise them that they should not be\r\nrequired to act against the insurgents at Delhi, provided they would be\r\nobedient to other orders. Quiet was in this way restored; but it being a\r\ndangerous precedent thus to allow troops to decide where and against\r\nwhom they would choose to fight, Major-general Woodburn, who had been\r\nplaced in command of a movable column from Bombay, marched through\r\nAhmednuggur to Aurungabad. This column consisted of the 28th Bombay\r\nnative infantry, the 14th dragoons, Captain Woolcombe’s battery, and a\r\npontoon train. When Woodburn arrived, he found that the ladies had all\r\nleft the Aurungabad station, that the officers were living barricaded in\r\nthe mess-room, and that all the Nizam’s troops exhibited unfavourable\r\nsymptoms. The first native cavalry, when confronted with Woodburn’s\r\ntroops, behaved in a very daring way; and about a hundred of them made\r\noff, owing to the unwillingness of the general to open fire upon them,\r\nalthough Abbott and Woolcombe saw the importance of so doing.\r\n\r\nIn the country north of Bombay, and between it and Malwah, many slight\r\nevents occurred, sufficient to shew that the native troops were in an\r\nagitated state, as if oscillating between the opposite principles of\r\nfidelity and treachery. It was worthy of note, however, that the troops\r\nthus affected were, in very few instances, those belonging to the\r\nCompany’s Bombay army; they were generally contingent corps, or\r\nMahrattas, or Rajpoots, or men imbued with the same ideas as the\r\nHindustanis and Oudians. Towards the close of July, a few troopers of\r\nthe Gujerat Irregular Horse endeavoured to incite their companions to\r\nmutiny; they failed, and then decamped; but were pursued and captured,\r\nand then hung in presence of their own regiment.\r\n\r\nStill further northward lies the country which, under the various names\r\nof Scindia’s territory, Holkar’s territory, Malwah, and Bhopal, has\r\nalready been described as the chief seat of the Mahratta power, and\r\nwhich corresponds pretty nearly with the region marked out by the\r\nCompany’s officials as ‘Central India.’ We have seen in former pages[77]\r\nthat Scindia, chief of the Mahratta state of which Gwalior is the\r\ncapital, offered the aid of his Contingent army to Mr Colvin in May;\r\nthat Lieutenant Cockburn, with half a cavalry regiment of this\r\nContingent, rendered good service in the region around Agra, until the\r\ntroopers deserted him; that the fidelity of Scindia to the British alone\r\nprevented his troops generally from joining the rebels, for they\r\nbelonged to the same Hindustani and Oudian families, though serving a\r\nMahratta prince in a Mahratta state; that after certain detachments had\r\nmutinied at Neemuch and elsewhere, the main body rose in revolt at\r\nGwalior on the 14th of June, murdered some of the English officers,\r\ndrove away the rest with their families, and formally threw off all\r\nallegiance to the Company; and that Maharajah Scindia, under\r\ncircumstances of great difficulty and peril, managed to keep peace at\r\nGwalior—retaining and feeding the troops at that place, and yet\r\ndiscountenancing their mutinous tendencies against the British. If he\r\nhad not acted with much tact and judgment, the Gwalior Contingent would\r\nhave marched to Agra in a body, and greatly imperiled the British ‘raj.’\r\nNot only did he keep those troublesome troops near him during the\r\nremaining half of June, but also during July and August. Scindia’s\r\nspecial army, entirely under his own control, were chiefly Mahrattas,\r\nwho had little sympathy with the soldiers of the Contingent; but they\r\nwere too few in number to put down the latter, and therefore he was\r\nforced to temporise—partly by persuasions and promises, partly by\r\nthreats. Major Macpherson, the British political agent, and Brigadier\r\nRamsey, the military commandant, ceased to have influence at Gwalior; it\r\nwas Scindia’s good faith alone that stood the British in stead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mount Aboo—Military Sanitarium in Rajpootana.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHolkar’s Mahratta territory, with Indore for its chief city, we have, in\r\nlike manner, seen to be troubled with a mutinous spirit in the\r\nContingent troops, partly owing to temptation from other quarters. We\r\nhave briefly shewn in the chapters lately cited, that on the 28th of May\r\nthe 15th and 30th Bengal native infantry revolted at Nuseerabad; that on\r\nthe 2d of June, influenced by this pernicious example, the 72d B. N. I.,\r\nthe 7th regiment of Gwalior Contingent infantry, and the main body of\r\nthe 1st Bengal native cavalry, mutinied at Neemuch; that on the 1st of\r\nJuly, a portion of Holkar’s Contingent rose against the British at\r\nIndore, without his wish or privity, and that he could not get even his\r\nown special troops to act against those of the Contingent; that, on the\r\nevening of the same day, the 23d Bengal native infantry, and one\r\nsquadron of the 1st Bengal native cavalry, mutinied at Mhow; and that\r\nnumerous British officers and their families were thrown into great\r\nmisery by these several occurrences. It now remains to be stated that,\r\nduring July and August, Holkar adopted nearly the same course as\r\nScindia; he remained faithful to the British, and endeavoured to quell\r\nthe mutinous spirit among his troops. Holkar possessed, however, less\r\ninfluence than his brother-chieftain; most of the mutineers from Indore\r\nand Mhow marched to Gwalior, and were only prevented by the shrewdness\r\nof Scindia from extending their march to Agra.\r\n\r\nAmong the troops in Rajpootana were the Deesa Field Brigade, commanded\r\ntowards the close of August by Brigadier Creagh, who had under his\r\ncontrol the troops at Deesa, those at the sanitarium on Mount Aboo, and\r\nthose at Erinpoora and other places in the neighbourhood. These places\r\nwere thrown into confusion during the last two weeks of the month, by\r\nthe mutiny of the Jhodpore legion, consisting partly of cavalry and\r\npartly of infantry. Such of these men as were stationed at Erinpoora,\r\nabout 550 in number, rose in mutiny on the 22d. They suddenly threw off\r\ntheir allegiance; seized the guns; made prisoners of Lieutenant Conolly\r\nand the European serjeants; plundered the bazaar and some of the native\r\nvillages; burned all the officers’ bungalows, and destroyed or\r\nappropriated all that they found therein; lived in tents on the\r\nparade-ground for three days; and then marched off in the direction of\r\nNuseerabad. The cavalry, although forming part of the same legion, and\r\nsharing in the movement, protected the Europeans from the infantry.\r\nAmong the latter, it was only the Hindustani portion which revolted;\r\nthere were some Bheels in the legion who remained faithful. On the\r\npreceding day (21st), about 100 men of the legion had mutinied at Mount\r\nAboo; but as there was a detachment of H.M. 83d there, the mutineers did\r\nnothing but hastily escape. A native chieftain, the Rao of Sihori, was\r\nprompt to render any aid he could to Captain Hall at Mount Aboo. Another\r\nportion of the Jhodpore legion was at Jhodpore itself, where the mutiny\r\nplaced in great peril Captain Monck Mason, British resident at that\r\nnative state; by his energy, he provided an asylum for many ladies and\r\nchildren who had been driven from other stations; but he himself fell by\r\nthe swords of a body of mutinous troopers, under circumstances of\r\nmingled cowardice and brutality.\r\n\r\nThe state of this part of India during July and August may be summed up\r\nin a few words. By the revolt of the Contingents of Scindia, Holkar, and\r\nBhopal, and of the Jhodpore legion, English residents were driven from\r\nstation to station in much peril and suffering, and English influence\r\nbecame for a time almost a nullity; but the native chieftains for the\r\nmost part remained faithful, even though their troops revolted; and\r\nthere were hopes of ultimate success from the arrival of relieving\r\ncolumns belonging to the Bombay army. Of that army, a few fragments of\r\nregiments occasionally displayed mutinous symptoms, but not to such a\r\ndegree as to leaven the whole mass. What the officers felt through the\r\ntreachery of the troops, and what their families suffered during all\r\nthese strange events, need not again be described; both phases of the\r\nRevolt have received many illustrations in former pages; but this\r\nchapter may fittingly close with two short extracts from letters\r\nrelating to the mutinies at the stations of Mhow and Indore. An\r\nartillery officer, commenting on the ingratitude of the sepoys towards\r\ncommanders who had always used them well, said: ‘I must not forget to\r\nmention that Colonel Platt was like a father to the men; and that when\r\nhe had an opportunity of leaving them and joining a European corps last\r\nsummer, the men petitioned him to stay. He had been upwards of thirty\r\nyears with them, and when the mutiny took place he had so much\r\nconfidence in them that he rode up to their lines before we could get\r\nout. When we found him next morning, both cheeks were blown off, his\r\nback completely riddled with balls, one through each thigh, his chin\r\nsmashed into his mouth, and three sabre-cuts between the cheekbone and\r\ntemple; also a cut across the shoulder and the back of the neck.’ The\r\nfollowing few words are from the letters of a lady who was among those\r\nthat escaped death by flight from Indore: ‘I have already given you an\r\naccount of our three days and three nights of wandering, with little\r\nrest and not much food, no clothes to change, burning sun, and deluges\r\nof rain; but —— and I, perhaps, could bear these things better than\r\nothers, and suffered less. When we heard the poor famishing children\r\nscreaming for food, we could but thank God that ours were not with us,\r\nbut safe in England. We found kind friends here, and I am in Mrs ——‘s\r\nclothes; everything we had being gone. The destructive wretches, after\r\nwe left Indore, commenced doing all the damage they could—cutting up\r\ncarpets with their tulwars, smashing chandeliers, marble tables, slabs,\r\nchairs, &c.; they even cut out the cloth and lining of our carriages,\r\nhacking up the woodwork. The Residency is uninhabitable, and almost all\r\nhave lost everything. I might have saved a few things in the hour and a\r\nhalf that elapsed between the outbreak and our retreat; but I had so\r\nrelied on some of our defenders, and felt so secure of holding on, that\r\nflight never for a moment occurred to me.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _The British at the Military Stations._—The reader will have\r\n  gathered, from the details given in various chapters, that the\r\n  stations at which the military servants of the Company resided, in\r\n  the _Mofussil_ or country districts, bore a remarkable relation to\r\n  the Indian towns and cities. They were in most cases separated from\r\n  the towns by distances varying from one mile to ten, and formed\r\n  small towns in themselves. Sometimes the civil officers had their\r\n  bungalows and cutcheries near these military cantonments; while in\r\n  other instances they were in or near the city to which the\r\n  cantonment was a sort of appendage. Such, with more or less variety\r\n  of detail, was the case at Patna (Dinapoor), Benares (Chunar),\r\n  Cawnpore, Lucknow, Allahabad, Furruckabad (Futteghur), Agra, Delhi,\r\n  Gwalior, Lahore (Meean Meer), Nagpoor (Kamptee), Indore (Mhow),\r\n  Hyderabad (Secunderabad), Moorshedabad (Berhampore), Saugor, &c. The\r\n  marked separation between the native and the British portions of the\r\n  military stations has been described in a very animated way, by an\r\n  able and distinguished correspondent of the _Times_, one of whose\r\n  letters contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n  ‘For six miles along the banks of the Ganges extend the ruins of the\r\n  English station of Cawnpore. You observe how distinct they are from\r\n  the city. The palace of the Victoria Regia at Chatsworth is not more\r\n  unlike the dirty ditch in which lives the humble duck-weed—Belgravia\r\n  is not more dissimilar to Spitalfields—than is the English quarter\r\n  of an Indian station to the city to which it is attached. The one is\r\n  generally several miles away from the other. There is no common\r\n  street, no link to connect the one with the others; and the one\r\n  knows nothing of the other. Here are broad roads, lined on each side\r\n  with trees and walls, or with park-like grounds, inside which you\r\n  can catch glimpses of gaily-painted one-storied villas, of brick,\r\n  covered with cement, decorated with Corinthian colonnades,\r\n  porticoes, and broad verandahs—each in its own wide park, with\r\n  gardens in front, orchards, and out-offices. There are narrow,\r\n  tortuous, unpaved lanes, hemmed in by tottering, haggard, miserable\r\n  houses, close and high, and packed as close as they can stand (and\r\n  only for that they would fall), swarming with a hungry-eyed\r\n  population. The mosque and the Hindoo temple are near each other,\r\n  but they both shun the church, just as the station avoids the\r\n  city.... In the station there are hotels, ball-rooms, magazines,\r\n  shops, where all the habits and customs of Europe, sometimes\r\n  improved and refined by the influence of the East, are to be found;\r\n  and when the cool of the evening sets in, out stream the carriages\r\n  and horses and buggies, for the fashionable drive past the long line\r\n  of detached villas within their neat enclosures, surrounded by\r\n  shadowing groves and rich gardens. They pass the lines or barracks\r\n  of the native infantry—a race of whom they know almost less than\r\n  they do of the people of the town; and they are satisfied with the\r\n  respect of action, with the sudden uprising, the stiff attitude of\r\n  attention, the cold salute, regardless of the insolence and dislike\r\n  of the eye; they chat and laugh, marry and are given in marriage,\r\n  have their horse-races, their balls, their card-parties, their\r\n  dinners, their plate, their tradesmen’s bills, their debts; in fact,\r\n  their everything that English society has, and thus they lived till\r\n  the deluge came upon them. We all know how nobly they stemmed its\r\n  force, what heroic struggles they made against its fury. But what a\r\n  surprise when it burst in upon them! What a blow to all their\r\n  traditions! What a rebuke to their blind confidence! There is at the\r\n  moment I write these lines a slight explosion close at hand,\r\n  followed by the ascent of some dark columns of earth and bricks into\r\n  the air. We are blowing up the Assembly-rooms of Cawnpore in order\r\n  to clear the ground in front of the guns of our intrenchment, and\r\n  billiard-rooms and ball-rooms are flying up in fragments to the\r\n  skies. Is not that a strange end for all Cawnpore society to come\r\n  to? Is it not a curious commentary on our rule, and on our position\r\n  in India?’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Native Musicians at a Sepoy station.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Chaps. ix., x., xi.: pp. 147-191.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  ‘On the morning of the 18th they were not a mile off, so at noon we\r\n  marched through the city to meet them. Our force consisted of 160\r\n  sepoys and 100 irregular cavalry or sowars, one six-pounder, and eight\r\n  men to work it. This gun was an old one that had been put up to fire\r\n  every day at noon. I rigged it out with a new carriage, made shot and\r\n  grape, and got it all in order. With my gun I kept the fellows in\r\n  front in check; but there were too many of them. There were from 2500\r\n  to 3000 fighting-men, armed with matchlocks and swords, and many\r\n  thousands who had come to plunder. They outflanked us on both sides,\r\n  and the balls came in pretty fast. Men and horses were killed by my\r\n  side, but, thank God, I escaped unhurt! We retired through the city to\r\n  our intrenchments, followed by the enemy. They made several attacks,\r\n  coming up every time within a hundred yards; but they could not stand\r\n  the grape. At five P.M. they made their last attempt; but a lucky shot\r\n  I made with the gun sent them to the right-about. They lost heart, and\r\n  were seen no more. We killed from 150 to 200 of them, our own loss\r\n  being 18 killed and wounded, and eight horses. All their wounded and a\r\n  lot of others were cut up during their retreat by the rascally\r\n  villagers, who would have done the same to us had the day gone against\r\n  us. Our victory was complete. Not a house in Azimghur was plundered,\r\n  and the whole of the rebels have since dispersed. Please God, as soon\r\n  as I hear of Lucknow being relieved, I’ll be after them again. They\r\n  have paid me the compliment of offering five hundred rupees for my\r\n  head.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  ‘In the evening there was a fearful though causeless panic at Rajghat,\r\n  where the intrenchment is being made. The cry arose: “The enemy are\r\n  coming.” The workmen, 3000 in number, rushed down the hill as for\r\n  their lives. Prisoners who were at work tried to make their escape,\r\n  and were with difficulty recovered. Gentlemen ran for their rifles;\r\n  the soldiers got under arms; the gunners rushed to their guns; and\r\n  altogether, there was indescribable confusion and terror. All this was\r\n  the result of a succession of peals of thunder, which were mistaken\r\n  for the firing of artillery!’\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Chapter xi., pp. 177-181.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n                              Men.

His reply struck me at the time as rather remarkable. “That,”\r\n  said he, pointing to the largest, “is the tomb of the Nawab Mustapha;\r\n  he reigned about 100 years ago: and that,” pointing to a smaller\r\n  mausoleum near it, “is the tomb of his dewan, and it was he who\r\n  counselled the nawab thus: ‘Beware of the French, for they are\r\n  soldiers, and will attack and dispossess you of your country; but\r\n  cherish the Englishman, for he is a merchant, and will enrich it.’ The\r\n  nawab listened to that advice, and see here!” The old man was\r\n  perfectly civil and respectful in his manner, but his tone was sad: it\r\n  spoke the language of disappointment and hostility, if hostility were\r\n  possible. In this case the man referred to our late assumption of the\r\n  Carnatic, upon the death of the last nawab, who died without issue. As\r\n  a general rule, never was a conquered country so mildly governed as\r\n  India has been under our rule; but you can scarcely expect that the\r\n  rulers we dispossessed, even though like ourselves they be foreigners,\r\n  and only held the country by virtue of conquest, will cede us the\r\n  precedence without a murmur.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  ‘MY LORD—We, the undersigned inhabitants of Bombay, have observed with\r\n  sincere regret the late lamentable spread of mutiny and disaffection\r\n  among the Bengal native soldiery, and we have read with feelings of\r\n  horror and indignation the accounts of the cowardly and savage\r\n  atrocities perpetrated by the ruthless mutineers on such unfortunate\r\n  Europeans as fell into their hands.\r\n\r\n  ‘While those who have ever received at the hands of government such\r\n  unvarying kindness and consideration have proved untrue to their salt\r\n  and false to their colours, it has afforded us much pleasure to\r\n  observe the unquestionable proof of attachment manifested by the\r\n  native princes, zemindars, and people of Upper India in at once and\r\n  unsolicited rallying around government and expressing their abhorrence\r\n  of the dastardly and ungrateful conduct of the insurgent soldiery.\r\n  Equally demanding admiration are the stanchness and fidelity displayed\r\n  by the men of the Bombay and Madras armies.\r\n\r\n  ‘That we have not earlier hastened to assure your lordship of our\r\n  unchangeable loyalty, and to place our services at the disposal of\r\n  government, has arisen from the entire absence in our minds of any\r\n  apprehension of disaffection or outbreak on this side of India.\r\n\r\n  ‘We still are without any fears for Bombay; but, lest our silence\r\n  should be misunderstood, and with a view to allay the fears which\r\n  false reports give rise to, we beg to place our services at the\r\n  disposal of government, to be employed in any manner that your\r\n  lordship may consider most conducive to the preservation of the public\r\n  peace and safety.\r\n\r\n  ‘We beg to remain, my lord, your most obedient and faithful servants,\r\n\r\n                                          ‘NOWROJEE JAMSETJEE, &c., &c.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Chapter vii., p. 111; chapter xi., pp. 181-189.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BRIGADIER-GENERAL NICHOLSON.—Copied by permission from a Portrait\r\n    published by Messrs Gambart.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                 THE SIEGE OF DELHI: FINAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter eleven weeks of hostile occupation, after seven weeks of\r\nbesieging, the great city of Delhi still remained in the hands of a\r\nmingled body of mutineers and rebels—mutineers who had thrown off their\r\nsoldierly allegiance to their British employers; and rebels who\r\nclustered around the shadowy representative of an extinct Mogul dynasty.\r\nNay, more—not only was Delhi still unconquered at the end of July; it\r\nwas relatively stronger than ever. The siege-army had been increased;\r\nbut the besiegers had increased in number in a still larger ratio.\r\nGeneral Anson[78] had had thirteen days of command, in reference to the\r\npreparations for the reconquest of the city, before his death; General\r\nBarnard, forty, before he likewise died; General Reed, twelve, before\r\nhis retirement; General Wilson, thirteen, by the end of July; and now\r\nthe last-named commander was called upon to measure the strength with\r\nwhich he could open the August series of siege-operations.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient slightly to recapitulate a few events, and to\r\nmention a few dates, connected with the earlier weeks of the siege, as a\r\nmeans of refreshing the memory of the reader concerning the train of\r\noperations which, in the present chapter, is to be traced to an end.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, then, that as soon as the startling mutinies at\r\nDelhi and Meerut became known to the military authorities at the\r\nhill-stations, the 75th foot were ordered down from Kussowlie, the 1st\r\nEuropeans from Dugshai, and the 2d Europeans from Subathoo—all to\r\nproceed to Umballa, there to form portions of a siege-army for Delhi;\r\nthat a siege-train was prepared at Phillour; that Generals Anson and\r\nBarnard, and other officers, held a council of war at Umballa on the\r\n16th of May, and concerted such plans as were practicable on the spur of\r\nthe moment; and that troops began at once to march southeastward towards\r\nDelhi. We have further seen that Anson was troubled by the presence of\r\nBengal native troops whom he could not trust, and by the scarcity of\r\ngood artillerymen to accompany his siege-train; and that his operations\r\nwere suddenly cut off by a fatal attack of cholera, under which he sank\r\non the 27th. Next we traced twelve days’ operations of Sir Henry\r\nBarnard, during which he had advanced to Raneeput, Paniput, Rhye,\r\nAlipore, Badulla Serai, and Azadpore, to the ridge northward of Delhi,\r\non which he established his siege-camp on the 8th of June; he had just\r\nbeen joined by General Wilson, who had beaten the enemy at Ghazeeoodeen\r\nNuggur, and had crossed the Jumna from Meerut near Bhagput. Then came\r\nthe diversified siege-operations of the month of June, with a force\r\nwhich began about 3000 strong, aided by 22 field-guns and 17 siege-guns\r\nand mortars—the arrival on the 9th of the Guide corps, after their\r\nsurprising march in fiercely hot weather from Peshawur; the bold attack\r\nmade by the rebels on the same day; the manifest proofs that the\r\nsiege-guns were too light, too few, and too distant, to batter the\r\ndefences of the city; the commencement on the 13th, but the speedy\r\nabandonment as impracticable, of a project for storming the place; the\r\ncontinual arrival of mutineers to swell the number of defenders within\r\nDelhi; the daily sallies of the enemy; the daily weakening of the small\r\nBritish force; and the necessity for employing one-half of the whole\r\nsiege-army on picket-duty, to prevent surprises. We have seen how Hindoo\r\nRao’s house became a constant target for the enemy’s guns, and Metcalfe\r\nHouse for attacks of less frequency; how Major Reid, with his Goorkhas\r\nand Guides, guarded the ridge with indomitable steadiness, and made\r\nsuccessful attacks on the Eedghah and Kissengunje suburbs; and how\r\nsedulously Barnard was forced to watch the movements of the enemy in the\r\nrear of his camp. Passing from June to July, the details of the former\r\nchapter told us that the siege-army became raised to about 6000 men, by\r\nvarious reinforcements early in the last-named month; that an assault of\r\nthe city was again proposed, and again abandoned; that insurgent troops\r\npoured into Delhi more rapidly than ever; that Sir Henry Barnard died on\r\nthe 5th, worn down by anxiety and cholera; that numerous canal-bridges\r\nwere destroyed, to prevent the enemy from gaining access to the rear of\r\nthe camp; that the British were continually thrown on the defensive,\r\ninstead of actively prosecuting the siege; that the few remaining Bengal\r\nnative troops in the siege-army were either sent to the Punjaub, or\r\ndisarmed and unhorsed, in distrust of their fidelity; that on the 17th,\r\nGeneral Reed gave up the command which had devolved upon him after the\r\ndeath of Barnard, and was succeeded by Brigadier-general Wilson; and\r\nthat towards the close of the month the enemy made many desperate\r\nattempts to turn the flanks and rear of the siege-camp, requiring all\r\nthe skill of the British to frustrate them.[79]\r\n\r\nAugust arrived. The besieged, in every way stronger than the besiegers,\r\ncontinued their attacks on various sides of the heights. They gave\r\nannoyance, but at the same time excited contempt by the manner in which\r\nthey avoided open hand-to-hand conflicts. An officer of engineers,\r\ncommenting on this matter in a private letter, said: ‘At Delhi, they are\r\nfive or six to one against us, and see the miserable attempts they make\r\nto turn us out of our position. They swarm up the heights in front of\r\nour batteries by thousands; the ground is so broken and full of ravines\r\nand rocks, that they can come up the whole way unseen, or you may depend\r\nupon it they would never venture. If they had the pluck of a goose,\r\ntheir numbers might terrify us. It is in the Subzee Mundee that most of\r\nthe hard fighting goes on; they get into and on the tops of the houses,\r\nand fire into our pickets there; this goes on until we send a force from\r\ncamp to turn them out, which we invariably do, but not without loss. We\r\nhave now cleared the ground all around of the trees, walls, and houses;\r\nas a consequence, there is a large clear space around our pickets, and\r\nPandy will not venture out of cover; so we generally let him pop away\r\nfrom a distance until he is tired.’ Early in the month, an attempt was\r\nmade to destroy the bridge of boats over the Jumna; the rains had set\r\nin, the river was high, the stream strong, and these were deemed\r\nfavourable conditions. The engineers started three ‘infernal machines,’\r\neach consisting of a tub containing fifty pounds of powder, a stick\r\nprotruding from the tub, and a spring connected with an explosive\r\ncompound; the theory was, that if the tubs floated down to the bridge,\r\nany contact with the stick would explode the contents of the tub, and\r\ndestroy one or more of the boats of the bridge; but there is no record\r\nof success attending this adventure. The bridge of boats being a mile\r\nand a half distant from the batteries on the ridge, it could not be\r\nharmed by any guns at that time possessed by the British; and thus the\r\nenemy, throughout the siege, had free and unmolested passage over the\r\nJumna. The supply of ammunition available to the mutineers seemed to be\r\nalmost inexhaustible; the British collected 450 round shot that had been\r\nfired at them from the enemy’s guns in one day; and as the British\r\nartillerymen were few in number, they were worked nearly to exhaustion\r\nin keeping up the necessary cannonade to repel the enemy’s fire.\r\nAlthough the ‘Pandies’ avoided contests in the open field, many of their\r\nmovements were made with much secrecy and skill—especially that of the\r\n1st of August, when at least 5000 troops appeared in the vicinity of the\r\nBritish position, by a combined movement from two different quarters,\r\nand made an attack which nothing but the courage and skill of Major Reid\r\nand his handful of brave fellows could have withstood. In some of these\r\nnumerous operations, when the rainy season commenced, the amount of\r\nfatigue borne by the troops was excessive. It was the special duty of\r\nthe cavalry, not being immediately available for siege-services, to\r\nguard the rear of the camp from surprise; and to insure this result,\r\nthey held themselves ready to ‘boot and saddle’ at a few minutes’\r\nnotice—glad if they could insure only a few hours of sleep in the\r\ntwenty-four. Many an officer, on picket or reconnoitring duty, would be\r\nin the saddle twelve hours together, in torrents of rain, without food\r\nor refreshment of any kind. Yet, with all their trials, they spoke and\r\nwrote cheerfully. An artillery-officer said: ‘Our position here is\r\ncertainly by nature a wonderfully secure one; and if the Pandies could\r\nnot have found a better place than Delhi as the head-quarters of their\r\nmutiny, with an unlimited magazine at their disposal, I doubt if _we_\r\ncould have been so well off anywhere else. Providence has assisted us in\r\nevery way. From the beginning, the weather has been most propitious; and\r\nin cantonments I have never seen troops so healthy as they are here now.\r\nCholera occasionally pays us a visit, but that must always be expected\r\nin a large standing camp. The river Jumna completely protects our left\r\nflank and front; while the large jheel (water-course) which runs away to\r\nthe southwest is at this season quite impassable for miles, preventing\r\nany surprise on our right flank; so that a few cavalry are sufficient as\r\na guard for three faces of our position’—that is, a few, if constantly\r\non the alert, and never shirking a hard day’s work in any weather.\r\n\r\nThe enemy gradually tired of attacks on the rear of the camp, which\r\nuniformly failed; but they did not cease to maintain an aggressive\r\nattitude. Early in the month, they commenced a series of efforts to\r\ndrive the British from the Metcalfe post or picket. This Metcalfe House,\r\nthe peaceful residence of a civil-service officer until the disastrous\r\n11th of May, had become an important post to the besiegers. As early as\r\nfour days after the arrival of the siege-army on the ridge, the enemy\r\nhad emerged from the city, concealed themselves in some ravines around\r\nSir T. Metcalfe’s house, and thence made a formidable attack on the\r\nFlagstaff Tower. To prevent a recurrence of this danger, a large picket\r\nwas sent to occupy the house, and to form it into a river-side or left\r\nflank to the siege-position. This picket was afterwards thrown in\r\nadvance of the house, and divided into three portions—one on a mound\r\nnear the road leading from the Cashmere Gate to the cantonment Sudder\r\nbazaar; a second in a house midway between this mound and the river; and\r\na third in a range of stables close to the river. All the portions of\r\nthis picket were gradually strengthened by the engineers, as\r\nreinforcements reached them. The Flagstaff Tower was also well guarded;\r\nand as the night-sentries paced the whole distance between the tower and\r\nthe Metcalfe pickets, the belt of rugged ground between the ridge and\r\nthe river was effectually rendered impassable for the enemy. These\r\nvarious accessions of strength, however, were made only at intervals, as\r\nopportunity offered; at the time now under notice, they were very\r\nimperfectly finished. The enemy plied the Metcalfe picket vigorously\r\nwith shot and shell, from guns brought out of the Cashmere Gate and\r\nposted a few hundred yards in advance of the city wall; while a number\r\nof infantry skirmishers, many of whom were riflemen, kept up a nearly\r\nincessant fire from the jungle in front. Although the losses at the\r\nMetcalfe picket were not numerous, owing to the good cover, the approach\r\nto it for reliefs, etc., was rendered extremely perilous; and as this\r\nspecies of attack was in many ways annoying to the British, General\r\nWilson resolved to frustrate it. He placed under the command of\r\nBrigadier Showers a force of about 1300 men,[80] by whom the insurgents\r\nwere suddenly surprised on the morning of the 12th, and driven off with\r\ngreat loss. It was a sharp contest, for the brigadier had more than a\r\nhundred killed and wounded. Showers himself was in the list of wounded;\r\nas were also Major Coke, Captain Greville, Lieutenants Sherriff, James,\r\nLindesay, Maunsell, and Owen. Four guns belonging to the enemy were\r\ncaptured and brought into camp; but the chief advantage derived from the\r\nskirmish was in securing the abandonment of a mode of attack likely to\r\nbe very annoying to the besiegers. The insurgents, it is true, by\r\nplacing guns on the opposite side of the Jumna, frequently sent a shot\r\nor shell across; but the danger here was lessened by shifting the camp\r\nof the 1st Punjaub infantry.\r\n\r\nThat the siege-army was weakened by these perpetual encounters, need\r\nhardly be said. Every day witnessed the carrying of many gallant fellows\r\nto the camp-hospital or to the grave. At about the middle of August, the\r\nforce comprised 3571 European officers and men, and 2070 native officers\r\nand men, fit for duty; with 28 horse-artillery guns (6 and 9 pounders)\r\nand a small supply of siege-artillery. A detail of the component\r\nelements of the force, and of the ratio which the effectives bore to the\r\nsick and wounded, will be more usefully given presently in connection\r\nwith the September operations. Knowing well from dearly-bought\r\nexperience that he could not successfully assault and capture Delhi with\r\nhis present force, General Wilson looked anxiously for reinforcements\r\nfrom the Punjaub, which were due about the middle of the month. Indeed,\r\nall in camp were prepared to welcome one who, from the daring and energy\r\nwhich characterised nearly all the operations with which he had been\r\nintrusted, had earned from some the title of the ‘Lion,’ from others\r\nthat of the ‘Bayard,’ of the Punjaub. This was Brigadier-general\r\nNicholson, a soldier who had attained to that rank at an unusually early\r\nage. About the end of June, Sir John Lawrence had intrusted to him a\r\nflying column which had been organised at Wuzeerabad,[81] but which had\r\nundergone many vicissitudes; for Nicholson had been compelled to disarm\r\nall the Bengal native troops who were in his column. As we have seen in\r\nformer pages, the brigadier struck terror into the mutineers, and swept\r\naway bands of rebels in front and on either side of him in the region\r\nbetween the Chenab and the Sutlej. He nearly annihilated the Sealkote\r\nmutineers near Goordaspore,[82] and then cleared the country during a\r\nlong march, in fearfully hot weather, to Delhi. He himself with a few\r\ncompanions reached the city on the 8th of August; but the bulk of his\r\ncolumn did not arrive till the 14th. Its composition had undergone some\r\nchange; and it now comprised H.M. 52d foot, the remaining wing of the\r\n61st foot, the 2d Punjaub infantry, 200 Moultan horse, and a small force\r\nof artillery—in all, about 1100 Europeans and 1400 Punjaub troops.\r\nValuable, however, as was this accession of strength, it could not\r\nimmediately affect the siege-operations; seeing that it was necessary to\r\nawait the arrival of another siege-train, which Sir John Lawrence had\r\ncaused to be collected at Ferozpore, and which was on its way to Delhi,\r\nwith great stores of ammunition.\r\n\r\nAs soon as General Wilson found himself aided by the energetic\r\nNicholson, he gave additional efficiency to his army by grouping the\r\ninfantry into four brigades, thus constituted: _First_ brigade, under\r\nBrigadier Showers, H.M. 75th foot, 2d Bengal Europeans, and the Kumaon\r\nbattalion of Goorkhas; _Second_, under Colonel Lenfield, H.M. 52d foot,\r\nH.M. 60th Rifles, and the Sirmoor battalion of Goorkhas; _Third_, under\r\nColonel Jones, H.M. 8th foot, H.M. 61st foot, and Rothney’s Sikhs;\r\n_Fourth_, under Brigadier Nicholson, 1st Bengal Europeans, 1st Punjaub\r\ninfantry (Coke’s rifles), and 2d Punjaub infantry (Green’s Rifles). The\r\nGuides were not brigaded, but were left free for service in any quarter.\r\nThe cavalry was placed under Brigadier Grant, and the artillery under\r\nBrigadier Garbett. Nicholson had brought with him a few guns;\r\nnevertheless it was necessary, as just remarked, to wait for a regular\r\nsiege-train before a bombardment of the city could be attempted. The\r\ncamp, organised as it now was, although it put on a somewhat more\r\nregular appearance than before, was a singular phenomenon, owing to the\r\nmode in which European and Asiatic elements were combined in it. An\r\nofficer who was present through all the operations has given, in a\r\nletter which went the round of the newspapers, a graphic account of the\r\ncamp, with its British and native troops, its varieties of costume, its\r\ndealers and servants, its tents and animals, and all the details of a\r\nscene picturesque to an observer who could for a moment forget the stern\r\nmeaning which underlay it.[83] About the time of Nicholson’s arrival,\r\nLieutenant Hodson was intrusted by General Wilson with an enterprise\r\nsmall in character but useful in result. It was to watch a party of the\r\nenemy who had moved out from Delhi on the Rohtuk road, and to afford\r\nsupport, if necessary, either to Soneeput or to the Jheend rajah, who\r\nremained faithful to his alliance with the British. Hodson started on\r\nthe night of the 14th of August with a detachment of about 350 cavalry,\r\ncomprising 230 of the irregular horse named after himself, 100 Guide\r\ncavalry, and a few Jheend cavalry. The enemy were known to have passed\r\nthrough Samplah on the way to Rohtuk; and Hodson resolved to anticipate\r\nthem by a flank-movement. On the 15th, at the village of Khurkowdeh, he\r\ncaptured a large number of mutineer cavalry, by a stratagem at once bold\r\nand ingenious. On the 16th the enemy marched to Rohtuk, and Hodson in\r\npursuit of them. On the 17th skirmishes took place near Rohtuk itself;\r\nbut on the 18th Hodson succeeded in drawing forth the main body of\r\nrebels, who suffered a speedy and complete defeat. They were not simply\r\nmutineers from Delhi; they comprised many depredatory bodies that\r\ngreatly troubled such of the petty rajahs as wished to remain faithful\r\nto or in alliance with the British. Lieutenant Hodson, by dispersing\r\nthem, aided in pacifying the district around the siege-camp—a matter of\r\nmuch consideration. A letter from one of the officers of the Guides will\r\nafford a good idea of the manner in which all fought in those stirring\r\ntimes, and of the language in which the deeds were narrated when the\r\nformality of official documents was not needed.[84]\r\n\r\nFor ten days after Nicholson’s arrival, little was effected on either\r\nside save this skirmish of Hodson’s at Rohtuk. Wilson did not want to\r\nbegin; it was not his strategy; he steadily held his own until the\r\nformidable siege-train could arrive. On the other hand, the enemy were\r\nfoiled in every movement; all their attacks had failed.\r\n\r\nNicholson was on the alert to render good service; and the opportunity\r\nwas not long in presenting itself. His energy as a soldier and his skill\r\nas a general were rendered very conspicuous in his battle of Nujuffghur,\r\nresembling in its tactics some of those in which Havelock had been\r\nengaged. General Wilson obtained intelligence that a force of the enemy\r\nwas advancing from Delhi towards Bahadoorghur, with the apparent\r\nintention of attacking the siege-camp in the rear; the distance between\r\nthe city and the town being about twenty miles, and the latter being\r\nnearly due west of the former. Or, as seems more probable (seeing that\r\nall attacks on the rear of the camp had signally failed), the enemy may\r\nhave intended to cross the Nujuffghur jheel or water-course, and\r\nintercept the siege-train which they as well as the British knew to be\r\non the way from Ferozpore. One account of the matter is, that Bukhtar\r\nSingh, a rebel who had gained unenviable notoriety at Bareilly, had got\r\ninto disfavour with the King of Delhi for his want of success as one of\r\nthe military leaders within the city; that he had offered, if a good\r\nforce were only placed at his disposal, to wipe off the discredit by a\r\ncrowning victory over the Feringhees; and that, in pursuance of this\r\nobject, he proposed to get in rear of the siege-camp, intercept the\r\nexpected siege-train, capture it, and cut off all communication between\r\nthe camp and Umballa. Whatever may have been the main purpose, the\r\nexpeditionary force was of considerable strength, amounting to 7000 men,\r\nand comprising the whole or large portions of six mutinied infantry\r\nregiments, three of irregular cavalry, and numerous artillery. The\r\ngeneral, on receipt of this information, at once placed a column[85]\r\nunder the command of Brigadier Nicholson, with instructions to frustrate\r\nthe operations of the enemy. The brigadier started at daybreak on the\r\n25th of August, crossed two difficult swamps, and arrived at Nanglooe, a\r\nvillage about midway between Delhi and Bahadoorghur. During a halt and a\r\nreconnoitre, it was found that the enemy had crossed a bridge over the\r\nNujuffghur jheel, and would probably encamp in the afternoon near the\r\ntown of the same name. Nicholson determined to push on against them that\r\nsame evening. After another ten-mile march, during which his troops had\r\nto wade through a sheet of water three feet deep, he came up with the\r\nenemy about five o’clock, and found them posted in a position two miles\r\nin length, extending from the bridge to the town: they had thirteen\r\nguns, of which four were in a strong position at an old serai on their\r\nleft centre. The brigadier, after a brief reconnaissance, resolved first\r\nto attack the enemy’s left centre, which was their strongest point, and\r\nthen, ‘changing front to the left,’ sweep down their line of guns\r\ntowards the bridge. His guns having fired a few rounds, the critical\r\nmoment for a charge arrived; he addressed his men, told them what a\r\nbayonet charge had always been in the British army, and\r\nshouted—‘Advance!’ The infantry charged, and drove the enemy out of the\r\nserai with great impetuosity. He then changed front to the left, and so\r\ncompletely outflanked the enemy that they fled at once from the field,\r\nleaving thirteen guns behind them. While this was being done, Lieutenant\r\nLumsden advanced to Nujuffghur, and cleared it of insurgents. A small\r\nnumber of the enemy concealed themselves in the neighbouring village of\r\nNuglee; and when attacked, in a way that left no loophole for escape,\r\nthey fought so desperately as to bring down a considerable number of\r\nLumsden’s party, including the lieutenant himself. The enemy’s cavalry\r\neffected little or nothing; while Nicholson’s was employed chiefly in\r\nguarding baggage and escorting guns. Nicholson passed the night near the\r\nbridge, which had been the object of a fierce attack and defence during\r\nthe evening, and which he succeeded in blowing up about two o’clock in\r\nthe morning—thus cutting off one of the few approaches by which the\r\nmutineers from the city could get to the main line of road behind the\r\ncamp. Nicholson returned to camp on the 26th, after a few hours’ rest\r\nfor his exhausted troops. They had indeed had a hard day’s labour on the\r\n25th; for they marched eighteen miles to the field of battle—starting at\r\ndaybreak, and crossing two difficult swamps before they could arrive at\r\nNanglooe; and, to use the words of their commander in his dispatch, ‘as\r\nit would not have been prudent to take the baggage across the ford at\r\nBaprowla, they were obliged, after fourteen hours’ marching and\r\nfighting, to bivouac on the field without food or covering of any kind.’\r\nThere seems to have been something wrong here. One of the officers has\r\nsaid: ‘Unfortunately, through some mistake, I suppose, the grog for the\r\nmen had not arrived, nor commissariat rations; and it is wonderful how\r\nthey bore up against the privations of a long march, some hard fighting,\r\nand no food. A little grumbling was occasionally heard, but good-humour\r\nand cheerfulness were the order of the day.’ Such of them as had time to\r\nsleep at all during the night, slept on the damp ground; but all these\r\nexigencies of a soldier’s life were soon forgotten, and the troops\r\nreturned to camp in high spirits at their success. Nicholson had relied\r\nfully on the Punjaubees in the day of battle, and they justified his\r\nreliance, for they emulated the courage and soldierly qualities of the\r\nEuropean troops who formed the _élite_ of the force. He had to regret\r\nthe loss of 25 killed, including Lieutenants Lumsden and Gabbett; and of\r\n70 wounded, including Major Jacob and Lieutenant Elkington. The\r\nbrigadier’s official dispatch contained some curious particulars not\r\nalways given in such documents. It appears that during the day his men\r\nfired off 17,000 musket and rifle charges, and 650 cannon-shot and\r\nshells—a murderous torrent, that may perhaps convey to the mind of a\r\nreader some faint idea of the terrible ordeal of a battle. He captured\r\nall the enemy’s guns and ammunition; but a better result was, the\r\nfrustration of an attack which might have been very annoying, if not\r\ndangerous, on the rear of the camp. Of the guns captured, nine were\r\nEnglish field-pieces, formerly belonging to the regular Bengal army;\r\nwhile the other four were native brass guns belonging to the imperial\r\npalace at Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe Delhi insurgents, whether well or ill commanded, manifested no\r\ncareless inattention to what was occurring outside the city walls. They\r\nwere nearly always well informed of the proceedings of the besiegers.\r\nThey knew that a large siege-train was expected, which they much longed\r\nto intercept; they knew that Brigadier Nicholson had gone out to\r\nNujuffghur on the morning of the 25th; they knew that he had not\r\nreturned to camp on the morning of the 26th; and they resolved on\r\nanother attack on the camp in its then weakened state. All was in vain,\r\nhowever; in this as in every similar attempt they were beaten. As soon\r\nas they made their appearance, General Wilson strengthened his pickets.\r\nThe enemy commenced by a fire with field-guns from Ludlow Castle against\r\nthe Mosque picket; but the attack never became serious; it was steadily\r\nmet, and the enemy, after suffering severely, retired into the city.\r\n\r\nDuring the later days of August, the enemy attempted little more than a\r\nseries of skirmishing attacks on the pickets. If, once now and then,\r\nthey appeared in force outside the walls as though about to attack in a\r\nbody, the intention was speedily abandoned, and they disappeared again\r\nwithin the city. No evidence was afforded that they were headed by any\r\nofficer possessing unity of command and military ability. There was no\r\nSevajee, no Hyder among them. ‘Often,’ as an eye-witness observed, ‘like\r\nan undisciplined mob, at best merely an agglomeration of regiments, the\r\nrebels have attacked us again and again, and fiercely enough when under\r\ncover, but always with a poverty of conception and want of plan that\r\nbetrayed the absence of a master-mind. And now that they know strong\r\nreinforcements have joined our army, and that the day of retribution is\r\nnot far distant—although they may make an attempt to intercept the\r\nsiege-train—yet by their vacillating and abortive gatherings outside the\r\nwalls, and by the dissensions and desertions that are rife within, they\r\nshew that the huge body of the insurrection is still without a vigorous\r\nand life-giving spirit.’\r\n\r\nTrue as this may have been in the particular instance, it is\r\nnevertheless impossible not to be struck with the fact that the\r\nmutineers maintained a remarkable degree of organisation after they had\r\nforsworn their allegiance; the men of all the corps rallied round the\r\ncolours belonging to each particular regiment; and those regiments which\r\nhad customarily been massed into brigades, long strove to maintain the\r\nbrigade character. Although the insurrection possessed few elements of\r\nunity, although the rebels could not form an army, or operate\r\ncomprehensively in the field, they sought to maintain the organisation\r\nwhich their late British masters had given to them. There had usually\r\nbeen a brigade of two, three, or four native regiments at each of the\r\nlarger military stations; from the station the brigade took its name;\r\nand when the mutiny was many months old, the mutineers were still\r\nrecognisable as belonging to the brigades which they had once loyally\r\nserved—such as the Bareilly brigade, the Neemuch brigade, the Dinapoor\r\nbrigade, the Nuseerabad brigade, &c. Although single regiments and\r\nfragments of regiments entered Delhi, to maintain the standard of\r\nrebellion against the English ‘raj,’ nevertheless the majority were\r\ndistinguishable as brigaded forces. The Delhi brigade itself, consisting\r\nof the 38th, 54th, and 74th regiments native infantry, formed the\r\nmaterial on which the Meerut brigade had worked on the 11th of May. This\r\nMeerut brigade comprised the 11th and 20th infantry, and the 3d cavalry.\r\nOn the 16th of June arrived the Nuseerabad brigade, consisting of the\r\n15th and 30th infantry, with horse and foot artillery; on the 22d, the\r\nJullundur and Phillour brigades entered, comprising the 3d, 36th, and\r\n61st infantry, and the 6th cavalry; on the 1st and 2d of June came the\r\nBareilly or Rohilcund brigade, including the 18th, 28th, 29th, and 68th\r\ninfantry, and the 8th irregular cavalry; and later in the same month\r\ncame the Neemuch and Jhansi brigades. Even when combined within the\r\nwalls of Delhi, each brigade constituted a sort of family or community,\r\nhaving to a great extent a way and a will of its own. The history of a\r\nhundred years has shewn that the sepoys always fought well when well\r\ncommanded; and their ineffective fighting as mutineers may hence be\r\nattributed in part to the fact that they were _not_ well commanded.\r\n\r\nIt was about this period, the latter half of August, that an unfortunate\r\nEnglish lady—unfortunate in being so long in the hands of brutal\r\nmen—escaped from Delhi under circumstances which were narrated by the\r\nBombay and Calcutta newspapers as below.[86] She was the wife of one of\r\nthe civil officers of the Company engaged at Delhi before the mutiny;\r\nbut as the newspaper narratives were not always correct in matters of\r\nidentification, the name will not be given here.\r\n\r\nSeptember arrived, and with it many indications that the siege would\r\nsoon present new and important features. Little is known of what passed\r\nwithin Delhi during those days; but General Wilson learned from various\r\nsources that the mutineers were in a very dissatisfied state at the\r\nfailure of all their attempts to dislodge the besiegers, or even to\r\ndisturb in any material degree the plan of the siege. They were without\r\na responsible and efficient leader, and were split up into small\r\nsections; they had no united scheme of operations; nor were they\r\nadequately provided with money to meet their daily demands.\r\n\r\nWith the besiegers, on the other hand, prospects were brightening. The\r\nsiege-train, when it arrived early in September, made a formidable\r\nincrease in the ordnance before Delhi. As the name implies, the guns\r\nwere larger, and carried shot and shell more weighty, than those used in\r\nbattles and skirmishes; their main purpose being to make breaches in the\r\ndefence-works of the city, through which infantry might enter and\r\ncapture the place. Sir John Lawrence had been able to collect in the\r\nPunjaub, and send to Delhi from Ferozpore, a train of about thirty heavy\r\npieces of artillery, consisting of guns, howitzers, and mortars of large\r\ncalibre. The difficulty was not to obtain the guns, but to secure and to\r\nforward men to escort them, animals to draw them, ammunition to serve\r\nthem, carriages to convey the auxiliary stores, food and camp-equipage\r\nfor the men, fodder for the animals—whether horses, oxen, camels, or\r\nelephants. Such was the disturbed state of India at that time, that\r\nLawrence had not been able to send this reinforcement until September;\r\nand even then, all his skill, influence, and energy, were required to\r\nsurmount the numerous difficulties. About the same time there arrived in\r\ncamp a Belooch battalion from Kurachee, the 4th Punjaub infantry, the\r\nPatan Irregular Horse, and reinforcements to H.M. 8th, 24th, 52d, and\r\n60th regiments. The siege-army now reached an aggregate of about 9000\r\nmen of all arms, effectives and non-effectives, including gun-lascars,\r\nsyce-drivers, Punjaubee Sappers and Miners, native infantry recruits,\r\nand other men not comprised in regular regiments. There were also near\r\nthe camp or on their march to it, numerous troops belonging to the\r\nCashmere, Jheend, and Putialah Contingents. Out of the total number of\r\ntroops of all kinds, Wilson hoped to be enabled to find 9000 effective\r\ninfantry to make an assault on the city after a bombardment. To what\r\nextent this hope was realised, we shall see presently.\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear clearly in mind the relative positions of the\r\nbesiegers and the besieged, the siege-camp and the fortified city, at\r\nthat time. Let it not be forgotten that the British position before\r\nDelhi, from the early days of June to those of September, was purely a\r\ndefensive one. The besiegers could neither invest the city nor batter\r\ndown its walls; the troops being too few for the first of these\r\nenterprises, and the guns too weak for the second; while an assault,\r\nthough twice intended, was not attempted, because there was no force\r\nsufficient to hold the city, even if it were captured. The position on\r\nthe north of the city, from Metcalfe House to the Subzee Mundee, was the\r\nonly one which they could successfully maintain. Nevertheless, though\r\nlimited to that one side, it was invaluable, because it enabled the\r\nBritish to keep open a road of communication with the northwest, whence\r\nall supplies must necessarily be obtained. The English public, grieved\r\nand irritated by the astounding news from India, often reproached\r\nBarnard and Wilson for their delay in ‘taking Delhi;’ and many of the\r\nofficers and soldiers on the spot longed for some dashing movement that\r\nwould restore British prestige, and give them their hour of revenge\r\nagainst the mutineers. Subsequent experience, however, has gone far to\r\nprove that the generals were right. The grounds for so thinking have\r\nbeen thus set forth by an artillery-officer whose account of the siege\r\nhas found a place among the Blue-books: ‘Whether the city might or might\r\nnot have been carried by a _coup de main_, as was contemplated first in\r\nJune and afterwards in July, it is needless now to inquire; but judging\r\nfrom the resistance we afterwards experienced in the actual assault,\r\nwhen we had been greatly reinforced in men and guns, it appears to me\r\nfortunate the attempt was not made. The strength of the place was never\r\nsupposed to consist in the strength of its actual defences, though these\r\nwere much undervalued; but every city, even without fortifications, is,\r\nfrom its very nature, strongly defensible, unless it can be effectually\r\nsurrounded or bombarded. Moreover, within Delhi, the enemy possessed a\r\nmagazine containing upwards of two hundred guns, and an almost\r\ninexhaustible supply of ammunition; while their numbers were certainly\r\nnever less than double those of the besiegers.’ But, more than this,\r\nDelhi was not so weak a place as public opinion in England at that time\r\nrepresented it to be. The numerous bastions presented regular faces and\r\nflanks of masonry, with properly cut embrasures. The portions of wall or\r\ncurtain between the bastions were twenty-four feet high, two-thirds of\r\nthe height being twelve feet thick, and the remainder near the top being\r\na parapet three feet in thickness. Outside the wall was a broad beam or\r\nledge, screened by a parapet as a place for musketeers; below the beam\r\nwas a ditch, sixteen feet deep by twenty feet wide at the bottom, with\r\nwell-constructed escarp and counterscarp; and a good sloping glacis,\r\ndescending from the outer edge of the ditch, covered nearly half the\r\nheight of the wall from all assaults by distant batteries. Captain\r\nNorman, who was present during the whole of the siege as assistant\r\nadjutant-general, and who wrote a very lucid semi-official account of\r\nthe siege-operations, fully corroborates this statement of the strength\r\nof the position.\r\n\r\nAs a memento of a remarkable event in the military history of India, it\r\nmay be acceptable to present here a detailed list of all the troops\r\nconstituting the siege-army of Delhi in the second week of September,\r\nwhen the assault was about to be made. The number, it will be seen, was\r\n9866,[87] besides ‘unarmed and undisciplined pioneers,’ of whom no\r\nenumeration was given. These, it must be remembered, were all\r\n_effective_ troops, and did not include those who were disabled by\r\nwounds or sickness. It should also be observed, that the Cashmere,\r\nJheend, and Putialah Contingents find no place in this list; they were\r\nscarcely mentioned by General Wilson in his dispatches, although from\r\nother sources of information they seem to have reached nearly three\r\nthousand in number. Why the general and his staff should have had to\r\nmake the entry ‘strength unknown,’ in reference to them, does not\r\nclearly appear. Concerning the other or more important elements of the\r\narmy, many of the regiments were represented only by detachments or\r\nwings in the camp, the rest being at other places; but all that need be\r\nnoted in the list is the exact number of men. Glancing over this list,\r\nit is impossible to avoid being struck with the fact how nearly the\r\nOudian or Hindustani element is excluded from it. There are Europeans,\r\nGoorkhas, Sikhs, Punjaubees, Beloochees, and mountaineers from the\r\nAfghan frontier; but the only entry referring clearly to the Bengal\r\nnative army is that of 78 men of the 4th irregular cavalry, and these\r\nappear in the unsoldierlike condition, ‘disarmed and unhorsed.’ The\r\nhorse-artillery were frequently referred to in dispatches by the names\r\nof the officers in command—such as Tombs’, Turner’s, Renny’s, and\r\nRemington’s troops; while two light field-batteries were named after\r\nScott and Bourchier. There were also several companies of foot-artillery\r\nserving with the siege-guns, which altogether numbered more than sixty\r\nheavy pieces of ordnance of various kinds. It has been said above that\r\nthe list of 9866 excluded sick and wounded; these latter numbered at\r\nthat time no less than 3074; therefore the total of all ranks and all\r\ndegrees of efficiency nearly reached 13,000 men, even excluding the\r\nunenumerated pioneers and contingents. In five regiments alone there\r\nwere 1300 men sick and wounded, almost equalling in number those in an\r\neffective state; the 52d royal regiment and the Sirmoor battalion\r\nexhibited a greater number on the sick-list than on that of the\r\neffectives.\r\n\r\nNow commenced those operations of siege-warfare which depend more on\r\nengineers and artillerymen than on infantry and cavalry—the arrangements\r\nfor bringing near the city guns numerous and powerful enough to batter\r\nthe walls. All hands were busy. The engineers and their assistants had\r\nmade 10,000 fascines, 10,000 gabions, and 100,000 sand-bags;\r\nfield-magazines, scaling-ladders, and spare platforms had been made in\r\ngreat number. The north side of the city being that which was to be\r\nassaulted, it was resolved to maintain the right of the position\r\nstrongly against the enemy, while the main attack was pushed on the\r\nleft—first, because the river would protect the left flank of the\r\nadvancing columns; and, secondly, because the troops would find\r\nthemselves in comparatively open ground in that part after a successful\r\nassault, instead of being cooped up in narrow and fiercely defended\r\nstreets. One of the subsidiary measures taken was to form a trench to\r\nthe left of the Samee, and to construct at the end of it a battery for\r\nfour guns and two large howitzers. This Samee, better known to the\r\nsoldiers as the Sammy House, was an old temple, situated some way down\r\nthe slope of the ridge towards the city, and about half a mile distant\r\nfrom the Moree Bastion; it had for some weeks been held by the British.\r\nThe purpose of this newly constructed Samee Battery was to prevent\r\nsorties from the Lahore or Cabool Gates passing round the city wall to\r\nannoy the breaching-batteries, and also to assist in keeping down the\r\nfire of the Moree Bastion. The three main works on the north side of the\r\ncity were the Moree, Cashmere, and Water Bastions—all of which had been\r\nstrengthened by the British authorities some years before, when no one\r\ndreamed that those strengthenings would be a disaster to the power which\r\nordered them to be effected.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 7th of September that the besiegers began to render\r\nvisible those works which pertain especially to the storming of a\r\nfortified post. Until then, there had been few or no trenches,\r\nparallels, or zigzags, intended to enable the besiegers to approach near\r\nthe beleaguered city, preparatory to a forcible entry. On that night,\r\nhowever, a working-party was sent out to establish two batteries about\r\nseven hundred yards distant from the Moree Bastion. The sappers,\r\nattacked by the enemy and defended by infantry, prosecuted their work\r\namid the peril which always surrounds that species of military labour.\r\nOne battery, on the left, of four 24-pounders, was intended to hold the\r\nCashmere Bastion partially in check; while the other, of five\r\n18-pounders and one 8-inch howitzer, was to silence the Moree Bastion,\r\nand prevent it interfering with the attack on the left. A trench was\r\nmade to connect the two batteries, and extending beyond them a little to\r\nthe right and left, so as to communicate with a wide and deep ravine\r\nwhich, extending very nearly up to the left attack, formed a sort of\r\nfirst parallel, affording good cover to the guard of the trenches. All\r\nthis was completed during the night or by the forenoon of the 8th; and\r\nthe two portions, with the trench connecting them, became known as\r\nBrind’s Battery, named after the officer who worked it.\r\n\r\nAt dusk on the evening of the 8th, a second working-party set forth, to\r\nconstruct a battery to be called ‘No. 2.’ The enemy, influenced by an\r\nopinion that the attack would be made on the right, had neglected the\r\nground at and near Ludlow Castle, a house situated barely seven hundred\r\nyards from the Cashmere Gate. The British engineers, taking advantage of\r\nthis neglect, seized the position, occupied it with a strong detachment,\r\nand employed the nights of the 9th and 10th in constructing a battery\r\nupon it. The enemy, alarmed at this near approach, kept up a fierce\r\ncannonade from the Cashmere and Water Bastions and from the Selimgurh;\r\nbut the besiegers had made their approach so carefully, that few of them\r\nsuffered. This battery, like Brind’s, was in two portions; one,\r\nimmediately in front of Ludlow Castle, for nine 24-pounders, was\r\nintended to breach the wall between the Cashmere and Water Bastions, and\r\nto render the parapet untenable by musketeers; the other, two hundred\r\nyards further to the right, for seven 8-inch howitzers and two\r\n18-pounders, was to aid in attaining the same objects. The ‘No. 2’\r\nBattery, from its magnitude, and the important duty assigned to it, was\r\nplaced under the control of two officers; Major Kaye commanded the right\r\nposition; while the left was intrusted to Major Campbell, who, being\r\nwounded soon afterwards, was succeeded by Captain Johnson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Jumana Musjid at Delhi. From a Photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nStill further was the powerful machinery for attack carried. On the\r\nnight of the 10th, Battery No. 3 was commenced, within two hundred yards\r\nof the Water Bastion, behind a small ruined house in the custom-house\r\ncompound; it was bold and hazardous work to construct a battery in such\r\na spot, for the enemy kept up a destructive fire of musketry the whole\r\ntime. The object of No. 3, when mounted with six 18-pounders, was to\r\nopen a second breach in the Water Bastion. Battery No. 4 was in like\r\nmanner constructed during the nights of the 10th and 11th, at the\r\nKoodseebagh near Ludlow Castle; it was mounted with ten heavy mortars,\r\nplaced under the charge of Major Tombs. Later in the siege a battery of\r\nlight mortars was worked by Captain Blunt from the rear of the\r\ncustom-house. To enable the whole of the siege-batteries to be armed,\r\nmost of the heavy guns were withdrawn from the ridge, leaving only a few\r\nthat were necessary to defend it from any attacks made by the enemy from\r\nthe Kissengunje and Subzee Mundee quarters. There being a deficiency of\r\nfoot-artillerymen to man the heavy guns and mortars, nearly all the\r\nofficers and men of the horse-artillery quitted the duties to which they\r\nmore especially belonged, and worked in the batteries during the\r\nbombardment; as did likewise many volunteers from the British cavalry,\r\nwho were eager to take part in the fray. Even the infantry regiments\r\nfurnished volunteers from among the officers, who practised at the\r\nridge-batteries for many days before the breaching-batteries opened\r\ntheir fire, when they transferred their services to the latter. The\r\nnewly raised Sikh artillerymen, proud to share the dangers and emulate\r\nthe courage of the British, were intrusted with the working of two of\r\nthe great guns, a duty which they afterwards performed to admiration.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the works at the newly constructed\r\nbreaching-batteries bristled with forty-four heavy pieces of ordnance,\r\nbesides guns of lighter weight and smaller calibre at more distant\r\npoints. The murderous conflict could not much longer be delayed. The\r\nbesieged knew well the danger impending over them, and made arrangements\r\nfor a desperate resistance. No sooner did Brind’s Battery open fire on\r\nthe 8th than the enemy made a sortie from the city, principally of\r\ncavalry; but they were soon driven in by the artillery. From the broken\r\nground below the ridge, and from a trench in front of the battery, they\r\nkept up a constant fire of musketry; grape-shot had to be used against\r\nthem, from a light gun-battery near the Samee House. In like manner,\r\nduring the construction of the remaining breaching-batteries, the enemy\r\nkept up a fierce and continuous fire from every available point, causing\r\ngreat loss to the besiegers—not only among the fighting-men, but among\r\nthe natives employed as porters, magazine lascars, ordnance-drivers, &c.\r\nThe enemy went to work on the night of the 11th, and constructed an\r\nadvanced trench parallel to the British left attack, three or four\r\nhundred yards distant from it; and from this they opened a very hot fire\r\nof musketry. They also got some light guns, and one of heavier calibre,\r\ninto the open ground on the right of the siege-position, from which they\r\nmaintained an annoying enfilade fire. At the Custom-house Battery,\r\nwithin two hundred yards of the city, the British were continually\r\nassailed with a storm of bullets, which rendered their passage to and\r\nfrom the spot extremely perilous. On more than one occasion, before\r\nBattery No. 2 was finished, the mutineers sallied out from the Cashmere\r\nGate, and poured forth a volley of musketry at that spot; and it\r\nrequired a very strong guard of infantry to protect the battery from a\r\ncloser attack. Some of the enemy’s guns, planted to enfilade the\r\nbatteries Nos. 1 and 2, were so sheltered that the ordnance on the ridge\r\nand at the Samee House were never able effectually to silence them. From\r\nanother quarter, the Selimgurh or old fort, a constant fire of shells\r\nwas kept up, so skilfully pointed as to drop with perilous accuracy upon\r\nthree of the breaching-batteries. During the actual progress of the\r\nbombardment and assault, only one attempt was made by the enemy to annoy\r\nthe besiegers in the rear; a body of horse crossed the canal at Azadpore\r\n(at the junction of the two roads leading from the city and the\r\ncantonment), drove in a picket of irregular horse, and created some\r\nconfusion; but parties of Punjaub and Guide cavalry, quickly arriving at\r\nthe spot, checked, pursued, and dispersed the intruders.\r\n\r\nNow commenced the fearful thunder of a cannonading. The engineers having\r\nfinished their work, handed it over to the artillerymen, who collected\r\naround them vast stores of shot and shell. It was on the 11th of\r\nSeptember that the British siege-guns may be said to have opened their\r\nsystematic fire, although some had been already tested, and others were\r\nnot quite ready. The nine 24-pounders, in Major Campbell’s No. 2\r\nBattery, ‘opened the ball,’ to use the language of one of the engineers,\r\nand soon shewed their tremendous power in bringing down huge pieces of\r\nthe wall near the Cashmere Bastion. The enemy’s guns on that bastion\r\nattempted to reply, but were soon knocked over, and the bastion itself\r\nrendered untenable. The work was hot on the 11th, but much hotter on the\r\n12th, when Battery No. 3 opened its fire, and upwards of forty ponderous\r\npieces of ordnance belched forth ruin and slaughter on the devoted city.\r\nAll that night, all the next day and night, until the morning of the\r\n14th, did this cannonading continue, with scarcely an interval of\r\nsilence. Soldiers like to be met in soldierly fashion, even if they\r\nsuffer by it. The British did not fail to give a word of praise to the\r\nenemy; who, though unable to work a gun from any of the three bastions\r\nthat were so fiercely assailed, stuck to their artillery in the open\r\nground which enfiladed the right attack; they got a gun to bear through\r\none of the holes breached in the wall; they sent rockets from one of\r\ntheir martello towers; and they poured forth a torrent of musketry from\r\ntheir advanced trench and from the city walls. Throughout the warlike\r\noperations here and elsewhere, the enemy were more effective in\r\nartillery than in infantry, and less in cavalry than in either of the\r\nother two.\r\n\r\nWhen the great day arrived—the day with which hopes and fears, anxieties\r\nand responsibilities, had been so long associated—General Wilson made\r\narrangements for the final assault. The plan of operations was dependent\r\non the state to which the breaching-batteries had brought the\r\ndefence-works of the city during two or three days’ bombarding, by the\r\nengineers under Colonel Baird Smith, and the artillery under Major\r\nGaitskell. It was known that the force of shot and shell poured against\r\nthe place had made breaches near the Cashmere and Water Bastions,\r\ndestroyed the defences of those bastions, and knocked down the parapets\r\nwhich had afforded shelter to the enemy’s musketeers; but wishing to\r\nascertain the exact state of matters, the general, on the night of the\r\n13th, sent down Lieutenants Medley and Lang on the dangerous duty of\r\nexamining the breach made in the city wall near the Cashmere Bastion;\r\nwhile Lieutenants Greathed and Home made a similar examination of the\r\nbreach near the Water Bastion. These officers having announced that both\r\nbreaches were practicable for the entrance of storming-parties, the\r\ngeneral resolved that the next day, the 14th of September, should be\r\nsignalised by a storming of the great Mogul stronghold. He marshalled\r\nhis forces into columns,[88] the exact components of which it will be\r\ninteresting to record here; and to each column he prescribed a\r\nparticular line of duty. The 1st column, of 1000 men, was to assault the\r\nmain breach, and escalade the face of the Cashmere Bastion, after the\r\nheavy siege-guns had finished their destructive work; it was to be\r\ncovered by a detachment of H.M. 60th Rifles. The 2d column, of 850 men,\r\nsimilarly covered by a body of Rifles, was to advance on the Water\r\nBastion and carry the breach. The 3d column, of 950 men, was to be\r\ndirected against the Cashmere Gate, preceded by an explosion-party of\r\nengineers under Lieutenants Home and Salkeld, and covered by a party of\r\nRifles. The 4th column (strength unrecorded) was to assail the enemy’s\r\nstrong position in the Kissengunje and Pahareepore suburbs, with a view\r\nboth of driving in the rebels, and of supporting the main attack by\r\nforcing an entrance at the Cabool Gate; for this duty a miscellaneous\r\nbody of troops, almost wholly native, was told off. In addition to the\r\nfour columns, there was a reserve of 1300 men, covered by Rifles, which\r\nwas to await the result of the main attack, and take possession of\r\ncertain posts as soon as the columns entered the place. No more troops\r\nwere left at camp than were absolutely necessary for its protection; a\r\nfew convalescents of the infantry, and a few troopers and\r\nhorse-artillery, were all that could be spared for this duty. Nearly all\r\nthe pickets were handed over to the cavalry to guard. Arrangements were,\r\nhowever, made to send back a force as speedily as possible to the camp\r\nto guard the sick, wounded, stores, &c., which naturally became objects\r\nof much solicitude to the general at such a time. Brigadier Grant, with\r\nthe bulk of the cavalry and some horse-artillery, moved down to the\r\nvicinity of No. 1 Battery, to check any attempt that might be made by\r\nthe enemy, after a sortie from the Lahore or Ajmeer Gates, to attack the\r\nstorming columns in flank.\r\n\r\nThe night which closed in the 13th and opened the 14th of September was\r\nnot one to be soon forgotten by the soldiers of the siege-army. Few of\r\nthem, officers or men, slept much; their thoughts were too intensely\r\ndirected towards the stern realities of the morrow, which would end the\r\ncareer of so many among their number. At four o’clock on the morning of\r\nthe 14th, the different columns set forth on their march from the camp\r\nto their respective places. The first three columns were, according to\r\nthe programme just cited, to engage in the actual assault on the\r\nnorthern side of the city; the heads of those columns were to be kept\r\nconcealed until the moment for assault had arrived; and the signal for\r\nthat crisis was to be, the advance of the Rifles to the front, to act as\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Nicholson took the lead. He gave the signal; the Rifles rushed\r\nto the front with a cheer, and skirmished along through the low jungle\r\nwhich extended to within fifty yards of the ditch. The 1st and 2d\r\ncolumns, under himself and Brigadier Jones, emerged from behind the\r\nKoodseebagh, and advanced steadily towards the breached portions of the\r\nwall. Up to this time the enemy’s guns had wrought little mischief on\r\nthe columns; but as soon as the latter emerged into the open ground, a\r\nperfect storm of bullets met them from the front and both flanks;\r\nofficers and men were falling fast on the glacis; and for several\r\nminutes it was impossible to get the ladders placed for a descent into\r\nthe ditch and an ascent of the escarp. After a fierce struggle, the\r\nBritish bayonet, as usual, won the day; the troops dashed through and\r\nover all obstacles, and entered the city through the breaches which the\r\nguns had previously made in the walls. Now within the boundary of the\r\nimperial city, the two brigadiers at once turned to the right, proceeded\r\nalong the ramparts, fought the sepoys inch by inch, overcame all\r\nopposition, and captured in succession a small battery, a tower between\r\nthe Cashmere and Moree Bastions, the Moree itself, and the Cabool Gate;\r\nbut the vigorous attempts they made to take the Burn Bastion and the\r\nLahore Gate failed, so determined was the resistance opposed to them,\r\nand so terrible the loss they suffered in officers and men. It was in\r\none of the many attacks on the Lahore Gate, when the troops had to\r\nadvance along a narrow lane swept by the enemy’s grape-shot and\r\nmusketry, that the bullet was fired which laid low the gallant\r\nNicholson—an officer in whom the whole army had reposed a full and deep\r\nreliance. As far as the Cabool Gate, the two columns were enabled to\r\nmaintain their conquests; and they immediately made preparations for\r\nopening fire from the bastions inwards upon the yet unconquered\r\nbuildings of the city—a sand-bag parapet being constructed across the\r\ngorge or open rear of each bastion.\r\n\r\nWe have now to see what was transpiring in another quarter, on this\r\nmorning of heroism and slaughter. While the 1st column was engaged in\r\nforcing an entrance through the breach near the Cashmere Bastion, and\r\nthe 2d column a similar entrance through that near the Water Bastion,\r\nthe 3d directed its operations against the Cashmere Gate—through which,\r\nit will be remembered, the troops of that column were to rush after an\r\nexplosion-party had blown in the gate itself. If there be any sublimity\r\nin bloody warfare, it is manifested in the self-devotion with which a\r\nsoldier marches steadfastly to a position where he knows that death will\r\nbe almost certain and immediate. Such self-devotion was shewn by the\r\nlittle band of heroes forming this explosion-party. They had to advance\r\nin broad daylight to the gate, amid a storm of bullets from above, from\r\nboth flanks, and from a wicket in the gate itself; they had carefully to\r\nlay down and adjust the bags of gunpowder close to the gate, to arrange\r\na train or fuse, to fire the bags, and to take their chance of being\r\nthemselves blown up by the explosion. The gallant men intrusted with\r\nthis dangerous duty were divided into two parties—an advanced and a\r\nfiring party. The first consisted of an engineer officer, Lieutenant\r\nHome, two non-commissioned officers, Sergeants Smith and Carmichael, and\r\na few native sappers, who carried the powder-bags. The firing-party\r\nconsisted of Lieutenant Salkeld, Corporal Burgess, and a few native\r\nsappers. Owing to some delay, the two parties did not set out for their\r\nrendezvous at Ludlow Castle until broad daylight, and then they had to\r\nencounter a heavy fire of musketry all the way. When the advanced party\r\nreached the gate—a heavy wooden structure, flanked by massive walls—they\r\nfound that a part of the drawbridge over the ditch had been destroyed;\r\nbut, passing across the precarious footing afforded by the remaining\r\nbeams, they proceeded to lodge their powder-bags against the gate. The\r\nwicket was open, and through it the enemy kept up a heavy fire. Sergeant\r\nCarmichael, and a native sapper named Madhoo, were killed while laying\r\nthe bags; but Lieutenant Home only received a blow from a stone thrown\r\nup by a bullet. The perilous duty of laying the bags being completed,\r\nthe advanced party slipped down into the ditch, to make room for the\r\nfiring-party, which then advanced. ‘Lieutenant Salkeld,’ said Colonel\r\nBaird Smith, in his report of the engineering operations of the day,\r\n‘while endeavouring to fire the charge, was shot through the arm and\r\nleg, and handed over the slow match to Corporal Burgess, who fell\r\nmortally wounded just as he had successfully accomplished the onerous\r\nduty. Havildar Tilluh Singh, of the Sikhs, was wounded, and Ramloll\r\nSepoy of the same corps, was killed during this part of the operation.\r\nThe demolition being most successful, Lieutenant Home, happily not\r\nwounded, caused the bugler (Hawthorne) to sound the regimental call of\r\nthe 52d, as the signal for the advancing columns. Fearing that amid the\r\nnoise of the assault the sounds might not be heard, he had the call\r\nrepeated three times, when the troops advanced and carried the gateway\r\nwith complete success.’ Sergeant Smith had a narrow escape from being\r\nblown up. Seeing Burgess fall, and not knowing the exact result of the\r\ngallant fellow’s efforts to fire the train, he ran forward; but seeing\r\nthe train alight, he had just time to throw himself into the ditch\r\nbefore the explosion took place. The perilous nature of this kind of\r\nduty gave rise to a correspondence in the public journals, from which a\r\nfew lines may not unsuitably be given in a note.[89]\r\n\r\nColonel Campbell, with the 3d column, after the heroic explosion-party\r\nhad forced an entry for him through the Cashmere Gate, marched boldly\r\nthrough the city towards the Jumma Musjid—a perilous enterprise; for the\r\ndistance was upwards of a mile even in a straight line, and many\r\npopulous streets would need to be traversed. In this march he was aided\r\nby Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, a member of the Company’s civil service,\r\nwhose house outside Delhi has been so often mentioned, and who had been\r\na valuable adviser to the siege-army during the whole period of its\r\noperations on the ridge. He knew Delhi well, and was thus enabled to\r\nrender Campbell essential service. Conducting the column by a circuitous\r\nroute, he kept it nearly free from opposition until the fine street,\r\ncalled the Chandnee Chowk, was reached, where they took possession of\r\nthe Kotwallee. At this point, however, the troops began to fall rapidly\r\nunder the muskets of the enemy, and it was found to be impracticable to\r\nachieve the object fondly hoped—the capture of the Jumma Musjid itself.\r\nAfter a gallant struggle, the column fell back to the neighbourhood of\r\nthe English church near the Cashmere Gate, where it had the support of\r\nthe reserve. The colonel at once placed the 52d regiment in the church,\r\nthe Kumaon battalion in Skinner’s house, and the Punjaub infantry in the\r\nhouses at the junction of two streets that led from the centre of the\r\ncity to the open space around the church. Guns, too, were posted at the\r\nlast-named place, to check the advance of insurgents who had begun to\r\ntreat Campbell as a fleeing and defeated officer. He was in one sense\r\ndefeated; for he had to retreat nearly a mile, and saw his fine troops\r\ncut up terribly all around him; nevertheless, before nightfall he had\r\nplaced himself in a position from which the enemy could not dislodge\r\nhim, and which enabled him to take a prominent part in the subsequent\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CORPORAL BURGESS, blown up at Cashmere Gate.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRather as a support to Colonel Campbell’s 3d column, than as a leading\r\ncorps, the reserve now comes for notice—its position being indeed\r\ndenoted by its name. This reserve column, under Brigadier Longfield,\r\nhad, it will be remembered, the duty of watching the result of the main\r\nattack, and of taking possession of certain posts as soon as the other\r\ncolumns had effected an entry into the city. The reserve followed the 3d\r\ncolumn through the Cashmere Gate, having previously spared the Belooch\r\nbattalion to render service near Hindoo Rao’s house. Longfield at once\r\ncleared the college gardens of insurgents, and then told off his troops\r\nso as to obtain efficient hold of the Water Bastion, the Cashmere Gate,\r\nSkinner’s house, and a large commanding building called Ahmed Ali Khan’s\r\nhouse. Skinner’s house, or in Indian form, Sikunder’s, had at one time\r\nbeen the residence of Major Skinner, commander of a regiment of\r\nirregular horse, which had acquired much celebrity; the house was large,\r\nand presented many important advantages for a military force.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another portion of the siege-army, whose fortune on this\r\n14th of September has to be noticed—namely, that which was placed under\r\nthe command of Major Reid, for a series of operations in the western\r\nsuburbs of the city. Everything here was under a cloud of\r\ndisappointment; the operations were not attended with that degree of\r\nsuccess which the officers and men had fondly hoped. Captain Dwyer, in\r\ncommand of the Cashmere field-force, was intrusted with the management\r\nof 400 men of that force, and four guns; and the object he was to\r\nendeavour to attain was the safe occupation of the Eedghah Serai, in\r\ndangerous proximity to the garrison within the city. Early in the\r\nmorning he set out from the camp. Finding the road very difficult for\r\nartillery, he pulled down a portion of stone-wall to enable his guns to\r\nget upon the Rohtuk high road; the noise unfortunately attracted the\r\nenemy, who immediately sent down 2000 men to that point. Dwyer kept up a\r\nfire of artillery for three quarters of an hour; but finding that the\r\nenemy, instead of being discomfited, were about to outflank him, he\r\nresolved on a bold advance on the Eedghah. This resolve he could not\r\ncarry out; his troops were widely spread in skirmishing order, and could\r\nnot be collected in column; the guns could not be properly moved, for\r\nthe grass-cutters had taken away the horses. In short, the attempt was a\r\ntotal failure, and the captain was compelled to retire without his guns.\r\nThe force appears to have been too small, and the Cashmerian troops\r\nscarcely equal in soldierly discipline to the demands of the work\r\nintrusted to them. This attack on the Eedghah was to have been part of a\r\nlarger enterprise intrusted to Major Reid, having in view the conquest\r\nof the whole western suburb of Delhi, and the command of all outlets by\r\nthe western gates. The major advanced from the Subzee Mundee towards the\r\nKissengunje suburb; but he found the enemy so numerous and strongly\r\nposted, and he met with such a strenuous opposition, that his progress\r\nwas soon checked. The gallant Reid himself being struck down wounded, as\r\nwell as many other officers, Captain Muter of the 60th Rifles, and\r\nCaptain R. C. Lawrence, political agent with the Cashmere Contingent,\r\nfelt it necessary promptly to decide on the course best to be pursued.\r\nThey found the different detachments, of which the column consisted, so\r\nbroken and disorganised by the heavy fire of the enemy, that it was\r\nimpossible to reform them on broken ground, and under a severe fire the\r\nattack on the Kissengunje could not be renewed; all they attempted was\r\nto keep the enemy in check for an hour, without losing ground. They\r\nwaited for a reinforcement of artillery, which Reid had sent for before\r\nbeing wounded; but these guns, through some unexplained cause, failed to\r\narrive. Seeing the enemy increase in force, and fearing for the safety\r\nof the batteries below Hindoo Rao’s house, the officers gave up the\r\nattack and retired, strengthening the batteries and the Subzee Mundee\r\npicket. The failure of Captain Dwyer’s attack greatly increased the\r\ndifficulty of the position; for the enemy was thereby enabled to advance\r\non the right flank of the main column, endanger its rear, and hotly\r\npress the Subzee Mundee picket. Reid, Lawrence, Dwyer, Muter—all were\r\nmortified at their failure in this suburban operation.\r\n\r\nThus ended the 14th of September, a day on which British authority was\r\npartially restored in the ‘city of the Moguls,’ after an interregnum of\r\neighteen weeks. Partial, indeed, was the reconquest; for the portion of\r\nthe city held bore so small a ratio to the whole, that the troops\r\nforesaw a terrible and sanguinary ordeal to be gone through before the\r\nBritish flag would again wave undisputed over the conquered city. The\r\nloss was very large, in relation to the strength of the army generally.\r\nThere fell on this one day, 8 British officers, 162 British troops, and\r\n103 native troops, killed; while the list of wounded comprised 52\r\nBritish officers, 512 British troops, and 310 native troops—a total of\r\n1135. When night closed around the survivors, the 1st and 2d columns\r\nheld all the towers, bastions, and ramparts from the vicinity of the\r\nCashmere Gate to the Cabool Gate; the 3d column and the reserve held the\r\nCashmere Gate, the English church, Skinner’s house, the Water Bastion,\r\nAhmed Ali Khan’s house, the college gardens, and many buildings and open\r\nspots in that part of Delhi; while the 4th column, defeated in the\r\nwestern suburbs, had retreated to the camp or the ridge.\r\n\r\nSnatching a little occasional repose during the night, the besiegers\r\nfound themselves at dawn on the 15th, as we have said, masters of a\r\n_part_ only of Delhi; and they prepared for the stern work before them.\r\nThey dragged several mortars into position, at various points between\r\nthe Cashmere and Cabool Gates, to shell the heart of the city and the\r\nimperial palace. A battery, commanding the Selimgurh and a part of the\r\npalace, was also established in the college gardens; and several houses\r\nwere taken and armed in advance or further to the south. The enemy,\r\nmeanwhile, kept up a vigorous fire from the Selimgurh and the magazine\r\nupon the positions occupied by the British, and skirmishing went on at\r\nall the advanced posts. This, be it understood, was within the city\r\nitself; the British being in command of a strip of ground and buildings\r\njust within the northern wall; while all the rest was still in the hands\r\nof the rebels. It was in every way a strange position for an army to\r\noccupy; the city was filled with hostile soldiery, who had the command\r\nof an immense array of guns and a vast store of ammunition, and whose\r\nmusketry told with fatal effect from loopholed walls and houses in all\r\nthe streets within reach; while the besiegers themselves were separated\r\nby a lofty city wall from their own camp.\r\n\r\nThe 16th was marked by a greater progress than the 15th towards a\r\nconquest of the city, because the newly established batteries began to\r\nshew signs of work. The guns in the college garden having effected a\r\nbreach in the magazine defences, that important building was stormed and\r\ntaken, with a loss comparatively slight, by the 61st, the 4th Punjaub,\r\nand the Beloochees.[90] Outside the city, the Kissengunje suburb was\r\nthis day evacuated by the enemy, leaving five guns, which were speedily\r\ncaptured by a detachment sent down from Hindoo Rao’s house; it was then\r\nfound that the enemy’s position here had been one of immense strength,\r\nand the failure of Major Reid’s attack received a ready explanation.\r\n\r\nAnother day dawned, and witnessed the commencement of operations which\r\nplaced a further portion of the city in the hands of the conquerors. The\r\nmagazine having been captured, it became important to secure the whole\r\nline of rampart and forts from that point to the Cabool Gate, comprising\r\nthe northeast as well as the north sides of the city. This was begun on\r\nthe 17th, and completed on the 18th, giving to the British a firm hold\r\nof everything behind a straight line extending from the magazine to the\r\nCabool Gate. A bold advance southward could now be made. Columns were\r\nsent forth, which captured the Delhi bank, Major Abbott’s house, and the\r\nhouse of Khan Mohammed Khan, and made a near approach to the palace and\r\nthe Chandnee Chowk. The pen can easily record this, but it must leave to\r\nthe imagination of the reader to conceive how great must have been the\r\nperil of soldiers thus advancing inch by inch through a crowded city;\r\nfield-artillery was brought to bear against them from almost every\r\nstreet, muskets from almost every house-top and window; and many a\r\ngallant fellow was laid low. One great advantage the besiegers now had,\r\nwas in the command of mortars brought out from the magazine; these were\r\nplaced in selected positions, and employed to shell the palace and the\r\nquarters of the town occupied by the enemy. It was now that the\r\ninsurgents were seen to be gradually escaping from the palace into the\r\nsouthern parts of the city, and thence through the southern gates into\r\nopen country not yet attacked by the British. Over the bridge of boats\r\nthey could not go, for the guns of the conquerors commanded it. Or, it\r\nmay more correctly be said, the command of the bridge of boats enabled\r\nthe conquerors to check that passage if they chose; but General Wilson\r\ndid not make war on women and children, or on such males as appeared to\r\nbe peaceful citizens: he allowed them to depart from the city if they\r\nwished—which nearly all did, for they feared terrible retribution at the\r\nhands of the British soldiery.\r\n\r\nAfter another night within the imperial city, the conquerors achieved\r\nfurther successes on the 19th. The post called the Burn Bastion,\r\nsituated on the west side of the city, close to the Lahore Gate, was\r\nsurprised and captured by a detachment sent from the already conquered\r\nCabool Gate. This swept the enemy from another large extent of wall. On\r\nthe following morning a detachment of cavalry, going from the ridge by\r\nway of the Kissengunje and the Eedghah, found that the enemy had\r\nevacuated a large and strong camp long occupied by them outside the\r\nDelhi Gate. Lieutenant Hodson at once took possession of it; and a mere\r\nglance shewed, by the quantities of clothing, plunder, and ammunition\r\nlying around, that the enemy must have made a very precipitate flight.\r\nThe cavalry, entering the city by the Delhi Gate—which, together with\r\nthe Gurstin Bastion, had just been attacked and taken by the infantry,\r\ngalloped on to the sumptuous Jumma Musjid, of which they took\r\npossession, being speedily supported by infantry and guns. While all\r\nthis was going on, the imperial palace was the object of a distinct\r\nattack. A column advanced along the Chandnee Chowk, placed powder-bags\r\nagainst the gate, blew it in, and entered the palace. The enormous\r\nbuilding was found to be deserted by all but a few fanatics and numerous\r\nwounded sepoys.\r\n\r\nThus at length was the great city of Delhi reconquered by its former\r\nmasters; thus again did the Feringhee become paramount over the Mogul.\r\nCaptain Norman, whose semi-official account of the siege has already\r\nbeen adverted to, closed his narrative by saying: ‘It is impossible to\r\nconclude without alluding to the trials and constancy of the troops\r\nemployed in this arduous siege. Called on at the hottest season of the\r\nyear to take the field, imperfectly equipped, and with the extent of\r\ndifficulties to be faced very imperfectly known, all felt that a crisis\r\nhad arrived, to meet which every man’s cheerful, willing, and heartfelt\r\nenergies must be put forth to the utmost; and how well this was done,\r\nthose who were with the army know and can never forget. For the first\r\nfive weeks every effort was required, not indeed to take Delhi, but even\r\nto hold our own position; and day after day, for hours together, every\r\nsoldier was under arms under a burning sun, and constantly exposed to\r\nfire. Notwithstanding the daily casualties in action, the numerous\r\ndeaths by cholera, the discouraging reports relative to the fidelity of\r\nsome of the native portions of our own force, the distressing accounts\r\nfrom all parts of the country, the constant arrival of large\r\nreinforcements of mutineers, and the apparent impossibility of aid ever\r\nreaching in sufficient strength to enable us to take the place—the\r\ncourage and confidence of the army never flagged. And, besides enduring\r\na constant and often deadly cannonade, for more than three months, in\r\nthirty different combats, our troops invariably were successful, always\r\nagainst long odds, and often opposed to ten times their numbers, who had\r\nall the advantages of ground and superior artillery.’\r\n\r\nTaking the 30th of May as the date when the first conflict between the\r\nbesiegers and defenders of Delhi took place, at some distance from Delhi\r\nitself, the interval of 113 days between that date and the final capture\r\non the 20th of September was marked by a very large death-list. It could\r\nnot be otherwise. Where men were exposed during so many days and nights\r\nto shells, balls, bullets, swords, heat, swamps, fatigue, and disease,\r\nthe hand of the destroyer must indeed have been heavy. And, as in all\r\nsimilar instances, the list of wounded was much larger than that of\r\nkilled. The official list comprised the names of 46 European officers\r\nwho had either been killed in battle, or died from wounds received; and\r\nof 140 others whose wounds had not proved fatal. But the\r\nadjutant-general is seldom accustomed to comprise in his lists those who\r\nfall with disease without being wounded; and thus the Delhi enumeration\r\ndid not include the names of Generals Anson and Barnard, or of any of\r\nthe numerous officers, who, though not wounded before Delhi,\r\nunquestionably met their death in connection with the preparations for,\r\nor conduct of, the siege. Distributed under different headings, the\r\nkilled and wounded amounted altogether to 3807,[91] to which were added\r\n30 missing. Of the horses there were 186 killed and 378 wounded. Of the\r\nnumber of insurgents who fell during the struggle, no authentic\r\nknowledge could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe official dispatches were nearly silent concerning the proceedings,\r\nexcept military, in the interval of six days between the first assault\r\nof the city and the final subjugation, and during the remaining ten days\r\nof September. General Wilson, shortly before the final attack was to be\r\nmade, issued an address to his soldiers, from which a few sentences are\r\nhere given in a note;[92] and in which, it will be seen, they were\r\ninstructed to give no quarter to the mutineers—that is, make no\r\nprisoners, but put all armed rebels to death. This was attended to; but\r\nsomething more was done, something darker and less justifiable. It is\r\nnot customary for soldiers to stab wounded and sick men in an enemy’s\r\narmy; but such was done at Delhi. The sense of hatred towards the\r\nmutinous sepoys was so intense, the recollection of the atrocities at\r\nCawnpore was so vivid, that vengeance took place of every other feeling.\r\nThe troops did that which they would have scorned to do against the\r\nRussians in the Crimean war—they bayoneted men no longer capable of\r\nresistance. They refused to consider the rules of honourable warfare\r\napplicable to black-hearted traitors; their officers joined them in this\r\nrefusal; and their general’s address justified them up to a certain\r\npoint. If the rule laid down by Wilson had been strictly adhered to,\r\nthere would have been military precedence to sanction it; but the common\r\nsoldiers did not discriminate in their passion; and many a dark-skinned\r\ninhabitant of Delhi fell under the bayonet, against whom no charge of\r\ncomplicity with the mutineers could be proved. The letters written home\r\nto friends in England, soon after the battle, and made public,\r\nabundantly prove this; the soldiers were thirsting for vengeance, and\r\nthey slaked their thirst. Many of the villagers of India, indeed, bore\r\ncruel injustice during that extraordinary period. Instances frequently\r\ncame to light, such as the following: A revolted regiment or a predatory\r\nband would enter a village, demand and obtain money, food, and other\r\nsupplies by threats of vengeance if the demand were not complied with,\r\nand then depart; an English corps, entering soon afterwards, would fine\r\nand punish the villagers for having aided the enemy. One thing, however,\r\nthe British soldiers did _not_ do; they did not murder women and\r\nchildren. This humanity, heroism, justice, or whatever it may best be\r\ncalled, was more than the natives generally expected: the leaders in the\r\nrevolt had sedulously disseminated a rumour that the British would abuse\r\nall the women, and murder them and their children, in all towns and\r\nstations where mutinies had taken place; and under the influence of this\r\nbelief, many of the natives put their wives to death rather than expose\r\nthem to the apprehended indignities. While, at one part of Delhi, the\r\nconquerors (if the narrators are to be believed) found Christian women\r\n_crucified_ against the walls in the streets; at another part, nearly\r\ntwenty native women were found lying side by side with their throats\r\ncut, their husbands having put them to death to prevent them from\r\nfalling into the hands of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nWhat other scenes of wild licence took place within Delhi during those\r\nexcited days, we may infer from collateral evidence. The mutineers,\r\nquite as much in love with plunder as with nationality, had been wont to\r\ncarry about with them from place to place the _loot_ which they had\r\ngathered during the sack of the stations and towns. As a consequence,\r\nDelhi contained temporarily an enormous amount of miscellaneous wealth;\r\nand such of this as the fugitives could not carry away with them, was\r\nregarded as spoil by the conquerors. There are certain rules in the\r\nEnglish army concerning prizes and prize-money, which the soldiers more\r\nor less closely obey; but the Punjaubee and Goorkha allies, more\r\naccustomed to Asiatic notions of warfare, revelled in the unbridled\r\nfreedom of their new position, and were with difficulty maintained in\r\ndiscipline. There was a large store of beverage, also, in the city,\r\nwhich the conquerors soon got at; and as intemperance is one of the weak\r\npoints of English soldiers, many scenes of drunkenness ensued.\r\n\r\nBut all these are among the exigencies of war. The soldiers bore up\r\nmanfully against their varied trials, fought heroically, and conquered;\r\nand it is not by the standards of conduct familiar to quiet persons at\r\nhome that they should be judged. When General Wilson reported the result\r\nof his hard labours, he said in his dispatch: ‘Thus has the important\r\nduty committed to this force been accomplished, and its object attained.\r\nDelhi, the focus of rebellion and insurrection, and the scene of so much\r\nhorrible cruelty, taken and made desolate; the king a prisoner in our\r\nhands; and the mutineers, notwithstanding their great numerical\r\nsuperiority and their vast resources in ordnance, and all the munitions\r\nand appliances of war, defeated on every occasion of engagement with our\r\ntroops, are now driven with slaughter in confusion and dismay from their\r\nboasted stronghold.... Little remains for me to say, but to again\r\nexpress my unqualified approbation of the conduct and spirit of the\r\nwhole of the troops, not only on this occasion, but during the entire\r\nperiod they have been in the field.... For four months of the most\r\ntrying season of the year this force, originally very weak in number,\r\nhas been exposed to the repeated and determined attacks of an enemy far\r\noutnumbering it, and supported by a numerous and powerful artillery. The\r\nduties imposed upon all have been laborious, harassing, and incessant,\r\nand notwithstanding heavy losses, both in action and from disease, have\r\nbeen at all times zealously and cheerfully performed.’ And in similar\r\nlanguage, when the news was known at Calcutta, did Viscount Canning\r\nacknowledge the heroism of those who had conquered Delhi.[93]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen above that the governor-general spoke of the ‘king a\r\nprisoner.’ This must now be explained. When all hope of retaining Delhi\r\nfaded away, the aged king—who had in effect been more a puppet in the\r\nhands of ambitious leaders than a king, during four months—fled from the\r\ncity, as did nearly all the members and retainers of the once imperial\r\nfamily. It fell to the lot of Captain (afterwards Major) Hodson to\r\ncapture the king and other royal personages. This officer was assistant\r\nquartermaster-general, and intelligence-officer on General Wilson’s\r\nstaff. His long acquaintance as a cavalry officer with Sikhs,\r\nPunjaubees, and Afghans had given him much knowledge of the native\r\ncharacter, and enabled him to obtain remarkably minute information\r\nconcerning the movements and intentions of the enemy; to insure this, he\r\nwas invested with power to reward or punish in proportion to the deserts\r\nof those who assisted him. It was known directly the Cashmere Gate was\r\nconquered that the exodus of the less warlike inhabitants of Delhi was\r\nbeginning; but not then, nor until six days afterwards, could this be\r\nstopped, for the southern gates were wholly beyond reach of the\r\nconquerors. The imperial palace was captured, and was found nearly\r\nempty, on the 20th; and on the following day Captain Hodson learned that\r\nthe king and his family had left the city with a large force by the\r\nAjmeer Gate, and had gone to the Kootub, a suburban palace about nine\r\nmiles from Delhi. Hodson urged that a detachment should be sent in\r\npursuit, but Wilson did not think he could spare troops for this\r\nservice. While this subject was under consideration, messengers were\r\ncoming from the king, and among others Zeenat Mahal, a favourite begum,\r\nmaking ridiculous offers on his part, as if he were still the power\r\nparamount—all of which were of course rejected. As these offers could\r\nnot be accepted; as Wilson could not or would not send a detachment at\r\nonce to defeat or capture the mutinous troops who had departed with the\r\nking; and as it was, nevertheless, desirable to have the king’s person\r\nin safe custody—Captain Hodson received permission to promise the aged\r\nsovereign his life, and exemption from immediate personal indignity, if\r\nhe would surrender.\r\n\r\nThus armed, Hodson laid his plans. He started with fifty of his own\r\nnative irregular troopers to Humayoon’s Tomb, about three miles from the\r\nKootub. Concealing himself and his men among some old buildings close by\r\nthe gateway of the tomb, he sent his demand up to the palace. After two\r\nhours of anxious suspense, he received a message from the king that he\r\nwould deliver himself up to Captain Hodson only, and on condition that\r\nhe repeated with his own lips the pledge of the government for his\r\nsafety. The captain then went out into the middle of the road in front\r\nof the gateway, and said he was ready to receive his captives and renew\r\nthe promise. ‘You may picture to yourself,’ said one familiar with the\r\nspot, ‘the scene before that magnificent gateway, with the milk-white\r\ndomes of the tomb towering up from within, one white man among a host of\r\nnatives, yet determined to secure his prisoners or perish in the\r\nattempt.’ After a time, a procession began to arrive from the palace.\r\nThreats and promises soon did their work; and the king, his begum Zeenat\r\nMahal, and her son Jumma Bukht, were escorted to Delhi. It was a\r\nstriking manifestation of moral power; for there were hundreds or even\r\nthousands of retainers in the procession, any one of whom could by a\r\nshot have put an end to Hodson’s life; but he rode at the side of the\r\nimperial palanquins, cool and undaunted, and they touched him not. As\r\nthe city was approached, the followers and bystanders slunk away, being\r\nunwilling to confront the British troops. The captain rode on a few\r\npaces ahead, and ordered the Lahore Gate to be opened. ‘Who have you\r\nthere in the palanquin?’ asked the officer on duty. ‘Only the King of\r\nDelhi,’ was the reply. The guard were all enraptured, and wanted to\r\ngreet Hodson with a cheer; but he said the king would probably take the\r\nhonour to himself, which was not desirable. On they went, through the\r\nonce magnificent but now deserted Chandnee Chowk; and the daring captor,\r\nat the gate of the palace, handed up his royal prisoners to the civil\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scene of Capture of the Princes of Delhi—Tomb of Emperor Humayoon.\r\n]\r\n\r\nCaptain Hodson’s work was not yet finished; there were other members of\r\nthe royal family towards whom his attention was directed. Early on the\r\nfollowing morning, he started to avail himself of information he\r\nobtained concerning three of the princes, who were known to have been\r\nguilty of monstrous deeds which rendered them worthy of instant death.\r\nHe went with a hundred of his troopers to the Tomb of Humayoon, where\r\nthe princes were concealed. After accepting ‘king’s evidence,’ bribing,\r\nthreatening, and manœuvring, Hudson secured his prisoners, and sent them\r\noff with a small escort to the city. Entering the tomb, he found it\r\nfilled with an enormous number of palace scum and city rabble, mostly\r\narmed; but so thoroughly cowed were they by his fearless demeanour, that\r\nthey quietly obeyed his order to lay down their arms and depart. The\r\ncaptain and his men then moved warily off to the city; and at a short\r\ndistance from the gate, he found the vehicle containing the princes\r\nsurrounded by a mob, who seemed disposed to resist him. What followed\r\nmust be given in the words of an officer who was in a position to obtain\r\naccurate information. ‘This was no time for hesitation or delay. Hodson\r\ndashed at once into the midst—in few but energetic words explained “that\r\nthese were the men who had not only rebelled against the government, but\r\nhad ordered and witnessed the massacre and shameful exposure of innocent\r\nwomen and children; and that thus therefore the government punished such\r\ntraitors, taken in open resistance”—shooting them down at the word. The\r\neffect was instantaneous and wonderful. Not another hand was raised, not\r\nanother weapon levelled, and the Mohammedans of the troop and some\r\ninfluential moulvies among the bystanders exclaimed, as if by\r\nsimultaneous impulse: “Well and rightly done! Their crime has met with\r\nits just penalty. These were they who gave the signal for the death of\r\nhelpless women and children, and outraged decency by the exposure of\r\ntheir persons, and now a righteous judgment has fallen on them. God is\r\ngreat!” The remaining weapons were then laid down, and the crowd slowly\r\nand quietly dispersed. The bodies were then carried into the city, and\r\nthrown out on the very spot where the blood of their innocent victims\r\nstill stained the earth. They remained there till the 24th, when, for\r\nsanitary reasons, they were removed from the Chibootra in front of the\r\nKotwallee. The effect of this just retribution was as miraculous on the\r\npopulace as it was deserved by the criminals.’ Thus were put to death\r\ntwo of the old king’s sons, Mirza Mogul Beg, and another whose name is\r\ndoubtful, together with Mirza’s son.\r\n\r\nWhat was done to restore order in Delhi after its recapture; who was\r\nappointed to command it; what arrangements were made for bringing to\r\njustice the wretched king who was now a prisoner; and what military plan\r\nwas formed for pursuing the mutinous regiments which had escaped from\r\nthe city—will more conveniently be noticed in subsequent pages.\r\n\r\nThe country did not fail to do honour to those who had been concerned in\r\nthe conquest of the imperial city. The commander of the siege-army was\r\nof course the first to be noticed. Although he had no European\r\nreputation, Archdale Wilson had served as an artillery officer nearly\r\nforty years in India. He was employed at the siege of Bhurtpore in 1824,\r\nand in many other active services; but his chief duties confined him to\r\nthe artillery depôts. It is a curious fact that most of the guns\r\nemployed by him at the siege of Delhi, as well as those used by the\r\nenemy against him, had been cast by him as superintendent of the\r\ngun-foundry at Calcutta many years before, and bore his name as part of\r\nthe device. He held in succession the offices of adjutant-general of\r\nartillery and commandant of artillery. At the commencement of the\r\nmutiny, his regimental rank was that of lieutenant-colonel of the Bengal\r\nartillery; but he acted as brigadier at Meerut, and was afterwards\r\npromoted to the rank of major-general. The Queen, in November, raised\r\nhim to the baronetcy, and made him a Knight Commander of the Order of\r\nthe Bath; and thus the artillery officer had risen to the rank of\r\n‘Major-general Sir Archdale Wilson, K.C.B.’ The East India Company, too,\r\nsought to bestow honour—or something more solid than honour—on the\r\nvictorious commander; the court of proprietors, on the suggestion of the\r\ncourt of directors, voted a pension of £1000 per annum to Sir Archdale\r\nWilson, to commence from the day when his troops entered Delhi.\r\n\r\nWhat honours Brigadier Nicholson would have earned, had his valuable\r\nlife been spared, it would be useless to surmise. He was an especial\r\nfavourite among the soldiers in the Indian army—more so, perhaps, than\r\nsome whose names are better known to English readers; and his death\r\nwithin the walls of Delhi was very generally deplored. He had not yet\r\nattained his 35th year—a very early age at which to obtain brigade\r\ncommand, either in the Company’s or the Queen’s armies. Nothing but the\r\nunbounded confidence of Sir John Lawrence in the military genius of\r\nNicholson would have justified him in making so young a man, a simple\r\nregimental captain (brevet-major), brigadier of a column destined to\r\nfight the rebels all the way from the Punjaub to Delhi; yet even those\r\nseniors who were superseded by this arrangement felt that the duty was\r\nintrusted to one equal to its demands. He had seen hard service during\r\nthe Afghan and Punjaub campaigns, as captain in the 27th Bengal native\r\ninfantry; and had, instead of idling his time during a furlough visit to\r\nEngland, studied the armies and military organisation of continental\r\nEurope. An officer who served with him during the mutiny said: ‘He had a\r\nconstitution of iron. The day we marched to Murdan he was _twenty-six_\r\nhours in the saddle, following up the mutineers.’ The Queen granted the\r\nposthumous dignity of Knight Commander of the Bath upon\r\nBrigadier-general John Nicholson; and as he was unmarried, the East\r\nIndia Company departed from their general rule, by bestowing a special\r\ngrant of £500 per annum upon his widowed mother, who had in earlier\r\nyears lost another son in the Company’s service.\r\n\r\nOne among many civil servants of the Company who fell during the siege\r\nwas Hervey Harris Greathed, a member of a family well known in India.\r\nAfter filling various official situations in the Punjaub, Rajpootana,\r\nand Meerut, he became chief-commissioner of Delhi, after the foul murder\r\nof Mr Simon Fraser on the 11th of May. Serve or remain in Delhi itself\r\nhe could not, for obvious reasons; but he was with Wilson’s army in the\r\nexpedition from Meerut to Delhi, and then remained with the siege-army\r\non the heights, where his intimate knowledge of India and the natives\r\nwas of essential value. He died of cholera just before the conclusion of\r\nthe siege. His brothers, Robert and George Herbert, had already died in\r\nthe services of the Company or the crown; but two others, Edward Harris\r\nand William Wilberforce Harris, survived to achieve fame as gallant\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nAnother of those who fell on the day of the assault was Lieutenant\r\nPhilip Salkeld, of the Bengal engineers. He was the son of a Dorsetshire\r\nclergyman, and went to India in 1850, in his twentieth year, in the\r\ncorps of Sappers and Miners. He was employed for four years as an\r\nengineer in connection with the new works of the grand trunk-road, in\r\nUpper India; and was then transferred to the executive engineers’\r\ndepartment in the Delhi division. His first taste of war was in relation\r\nto the mutinies; he was engaged in all the operations of the siege of\r\nDelhi, and was struck down while gallantly exploding the Cashmere Gate.\r\nHe lingered in great pain, and died about the 10th of October. The Rev.\r\nS. G. Osborne, in a letter written soon after the news of Salkeld’s\r\ndeath reached England, said: ‘This young officer has not more\r\ndistinguished himself in his profession by his devotion to his country’s\r\nservice of his life, than he stands distinguished in the memory of those\r\nwho knew him for his virtues as a son and brother. His father, a\r\nclergyman in Dorsetshire, by a reverse of fortune some years since, was\r\nwith a large family reduced, I may say, to utter poverty. This, his\r\nsoldier son, supported out of his own professional income one of his\r\nbrothers at school, helping a sister, obliged to earn her own bread as a\r\ngoverness, to put another brother to school. Just before his death he\r\nhad saved a sum of £1000, which was in the bank at Delhi, and was\r\ntherefore lost to him, and, more than this, it was lost to the\r\nhonourable purpose to which, as a son and brother, he had devoted it. In\r\nhis native county it has been determined to erect a monument to his\r\nmemory by subscription. Cadetships having been given to two of his young\r\nbrothers, it is now wisely resolved that while the memorial which is to\r\nhand down his name to posterity in connection with his glorious death\r\nshall be all that is necessary for the purpose, every farthing collected\r\nbeyond the sum necessary for this shall be expended as he would have\r\ndesired, for the good of these his young brothers.’\r\n\r\nLieutenant Duncan Home, another hero of the Cashmere Gate, was not one\r\nof the wounded on that perilous occasion; he lived to receive the\r\napproval of his superior in the engineering department; but his death\r\noccurred even sooner than that of his companion in arms, for he was\r\nmortally wounded on the 1st of October while engaged with an\r\nexpeditionary force in pursuit of the fleeing rebels. It was on that\r\nday, a few hours before he received the fatal bullet, that he wrote a\r\nletter to his mother in England; in which, after describing the\r\noperations at the Cashmere Gate, he said: ‘I was then continually on\r\nduty until the king evacuated the palace. I had never more than four\r\nhours’ sleep in the twenty-four, and then only by snatches. I had also\r\nthe pleasure of blowing in the gate of the palace; luckily no one fired\r\nat me, there being so few men left in the palace.’\r\n\r\nSalkeld and Home received the ‘Victoria Cross,’ a much-coveted honour\r\namong the British troops engaged in the Indian war. As did likewise\r\nSergeant Smith, who so boldly risked, yet saved, his life; and also\r\nBugler Hawthorne of the 52d, who blew his signal-blast in spite of the\r\nshots whistling around him. Poor Sergeant Carmichael and Corporal\r\nBurgess did not live to share in this honour; they fell bullet-pierced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  State Palanquin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xiv., pp. 230-246.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  By comparing two wood-cuts—‘Bird’s-eye View of Delhi’ (p. 64), and\r\n  ‘Delhi from Flagstaff Tower’ (p. 76)—the reader will be assisted in\r\n  forming an idea of the relative positions of the mutineers within the\r\n  city, and of the British on the ridge and in the camp behind it.

It was work worthy of a regiment\r\n  which had marched _three thousand miles in four years_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  ‘What a sight our camp would be even to those who visited Sebastopol!\r\n  The long lines of tents, the thatched hovels of the native servants,\r\n  the rows of horses, the parks of artillery, the English soldier in his\r\n  gray linen coat and trousers (he has fought as bravely as ever without\r\n  pipeclay), the Sikhs with their red and blue turbans, the Afghans with\r\n  their red and blue turbans, their wild air, and their gay head-dresses\r\n  and coloured saddle-cloths, and the little Goorkhas, dressed up to the\r\n  ugliness of demons in black worsted Kilmarnock hats and woollen\r\n  coats—the truest, bravest soldiers in our pay. There are scarcely any\r\n  Poorbeahs (Hindustanis) left in our ranks, but of native servants many\r\n  a score. In the rear are the booths of the native bazaars, and further\r\n  out on the plain the thousands of camels, bullocks, and horses that\r\n  carry our baggage. The soldiers are loitering through the lines or in\r\n  the bazaars. Suddenly the alarm is sounded. Every one rushes to his\r\n  tent. The infantry soldier seizes his musket and slings on his pouch,\r\n  the artilleryman gets his guns harnessed, the Afghan rides out to\r\n  explore; in a few minutes everybody is in his place.\r\n\r\n  ‘If we go to the summit of the ridge of hill which separates us from\r\n  the city, we see the river winding along to the left, the bridge of\r\n  boats, the towers of the palace, and the high roof and minarets of the\r\n  great mosque, the roofs and gardens of the doomed city, and the\r\n  elegant-looking walls, with batteries here and there, the white smoke\r\n  of which rises slowly up among the green foliage that clusters round\r\n  the ramparts.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  ‘The first day we marched to a place called Khurkowdeh, but such a\r\n  march! We had to go through water for miles up to the horses’ girths.\r\n  We took Khurkowdeh by surprise, and Hodson immediately placed men over\r\n  the gates, and we went in. Shot one scoundrel instanter, cut down\r\n  another, and took a ressaldar (native officer) and some sowars\r\n  (troopers) prisoners, and came to a house occupied by some more, who\r\n  would not let us in at all; at last, we rushed in and found the\r\n  rascals had taken to the upper story, and still kept us at bay. There\r\n  was only one door and a kirkee (window). I shoved in my head through\r\n  the door, with a pistol in my hand, and got a clip over my turban for\r\n  my pains; my pistol missed fire at the man’s breast (you must send me\r\n  a revolver), so I got out of that as fast as I could, and then tried\r\n  the kirkee with the other barrel, and very nearly got another cut. We\r\n  tried every means to get in, but could not, so we fired the house, and\r\n  out they rushed a muck among us. The first fellow went at ——, who\r\n  wounded him, but somehow or other he slipped and fell on his back. I\r\n  saw him fall, and, thinking he was hurt, rushed to the rescue. A Guide\r\n  got a chop at the fellow, and I gave him such a swinging back-hander\r\n  that he fell dead. I then went at another fellow rushing by my left,\r\n  and sent my sword through him, like butter, and bagged him. I then\r\n  looked round and saw a sword come crash on the shoulders of a poor\r\n  youth; oh, such a cut; and up went the sword again, and the next\r\n  moment the boy would have been in eternity, but I ran forward and\r\n  covered him with my sword and saved him. During this it was over with\r\n  seven men. —— had shot one with his revolver, and the other four were\r\n  cut down at once. Having polished off these fellows, we held an\r\n  impromptu court-martial on those we had taken, and shot them\r\n  all—murderers every one, who were justly rewarded for their deeds.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n      H.M. 9th Lancers     (Captain Sarrell),       One squadron.\r\n      Guide cavalry        (Captain Sandford),      120 men.\r\n      2d Punjaub cavalry,                            80 men.\r\n      Moultan horse.\r\n      H.M. 61st foot       (Colonel  Renny),        420 men.\r\n      1st Bengal Europeans (Major Jacob),           380 men.\r\n      1st Punjaub infantry (Coke’s),                400 men.\r\n      2d Punjaub Infantry  (Green’s),               400 men.\r\n      Sappers and Miners,                            30 men.\r\n      Horse-artillery      (Tombs’ and Olphert’s), Sixteen guns.\r\n\r\n  Captain (now Major) Olphert being ill, the command of his troop was\r\n  taken by Captain Remington.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  ‘Mrs ——, the wife of Mr ——, made her escape from Delhi on the morning\r\n  of the 19th. Poor creature, she was almost reduced to a skeleton; as\r\n  she had been kept in a sort of dungeon while in Delhi. Two\r\n  chuprassees, who, it appears, have all along been faithful to her,\r\n  aided her in making her attempt to escape. They passed through the\r\n  Ajmeer Gate, but not wholly unobserved by the mutineers’ sentries, as\r\n  one of the chuprassees was shot by them. It being dark at the time,\r\n  she lay hidden among the long web-grass until the dawn of day, when\r\n  she sent the chuprassee to reconnoitre, and as luck would have it, he\r\n  came across the European picket stationed at Subzee Mundee. So soon as\r\n  he could discover who they were, he went and brought the lady into the\r\n  picket-house amongst the soldiers, who did all they could to insure\r\n  her safety. As soon as she arrived inside the square, she fell down\r\n  upon her knees, and offered up a prayer to Heaven for her safe\r\n  deliverance. All she had round her body was a dirty piece of cloth,\r\n  and another piece folded round her head. She was in a terrible\r\n  condition; but I feel assured that there was not a single European but\r\n  felt greatly concerned in her behalf; and some even shed tears of pity\r\n  when they heard the tale of woe that she related. After being\r\n  interrogated by the officers for a short time, Captain Bailey provided\r\n  a doolie for her, and sent her under escort safe to camp, where she\r\n  has been provided with a staff-tent, and everything that she\r\n  requires.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n                      _Artillery, Engineers, &c._\r\n    European  { Artillerymen of all kinds,                     1350\r\n    and       { Engineers, Sappers, Miners, &c.,                722\r\n    Native.   { Pioneers, unarmed and undisciplined,              ?\r\n                                                               ————\r\n                                                               2072\r\n\r\n                              _Cavalry._\r\n              { H.M.

In ancient warfare, all nations appear to have\r\n  defended themselves from the deadly arrow by shields, and why the\r\n  principle of the testudo should be ignored in modern times is not\r\n  obvious. Take the instance before us—Lieutenant Salkeld and a few\r\n  others undertake the important, but most perilous duty of blowing in\r\n  the Cashmere Gate, by bags of gunpowder, in broad daylight, and in the\r\n  face of numerous foes, whose concentrated fire threatens the whole\r\n  party with certain death. It is accomplished, but at what a loss!\r\n  Marvellous indeed was it that one escaped. Now, as a plain man,\r\n  without any scientific pretensions, I ask, could not, and might not,\r\n  some kind of defensive screen have been furnished for the protection\r\n  of these few devoted men? Suppose a light cart or truck on three\r\n  wheels, having a semicircular framework in front, against which might\r\n  be lashed a rope-matting, and inside a sufficient number of sacks of\r\n  wool or hay, propelled by means of a central cross-bar pushed against\r\n  by four men within the semicircle, the engineers could advance, and on\r\n  reaching the gate, perform their work through a central orifice in the\r\n  outer matting, made to open like a flap. The party would then retire\r\n  in a similar manner, merely reversing the mode of propulsion, until\r\n  the danger was past.’ Another, Mr Rock of Hastings, said: ‘In July\r\n  1848, I sent a plan for a movable shield for attacking barricades, to\r\n  General Cavaignac, at Paris; and on the 13th or 14th of July your own\r\n  columns (the _Times_) contained descriptions of my machine, and a\r\n  statement by your Paris correspondent that it had been constructed at\r\n  the Ecole Militaire in that city. Fortunately, it was never used\r\n  there, but there seems to me no valid reason why such a contrivance\r\n  should not be used on occasions like that which recently occurred at\r\n  Delhi. The truck proposed, with a shield in front, would serve to\r\n  carry the powder-bags, without incurring the chance of their being\r\n  dropped owing to the fall of one or two of the men employed on the\r\n  service, while the chances of premature ignition would be diminished.\r\n  These, I think, are advantages tending to insure success which should\r\n  induce military engineers to use movable cover for their men when\r\n  possible, even if they despise it as a personal protection.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  When the magazine was so heroically fired by Lieutenant Willoughby,\r\n  four months earlier, the destruction caused was very much smaller than\r\n  had been reported and believed. The stores in the magazine had been\r\n  available to the rebels during the greater part of the siege.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n           _Europeans_—                    Killed.

The time is now drawing near\r\n  when the major-general commanding the force trusts that their labours\r\n  will be over, and that they will be rewarded by the capture of a city\r\n  for all their past exertions and for a cheerful endurance of still\r\n  greater fatigue and exposure.... The artillery will have even harder\r\n  work than they yet have had, and which they have so well and\r\n  cheerfully performed hitherto; this, however, will be for a short\r\n  period only, and when ordered to the assault, the major-general feels\r\n  assured British pluck and determination will carry everything before\r\n  them, and that the blood-thirsty and murderous mutineers against whom\r\n  they are fighting will be driven headlong out of their stronghold or\r\n  be exterminated.\r\n\r\n  ‘Major-general Wilson need hardly remind the troops of the cruel\r\n  murders committed on their officers and comrades, as well as their\r\n  wives and children, to move them in the deadly struggle. _No quarter\r\n  should be given to the mutineers_; at the same time, for the sake of\r\n  humanity, and the honour of the country they belong to, he calls upon\r\n  them to spare all women and children that may come in their way.... It\r\n  is to be explained to every regiment that indiscriminate plunder will\r\n  not be allowed; that prize-agents have been appointed, by whom all\r\n  captured property will be collected and sold, to be divided, according\r\n  to the rules and regulations on this head fairly among all men\r\n  engaged; and that any man found guilty of having concealed captured\r\n  property will be made to restore it, and will forfeit all claims to\r\n  the general prize; he will also be likely to be made over to the\r\n  provost-marshal, to be summarily dealt with.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  ‘The reports and returns which accompany this dispatch establish the\r\n  arduous nature of a contest carried on against an enemy vastly\r\n  superior in numbers, holding a strong position, furnished with\r\n  unlimited appliances, and aided by the most exhausting and sickly\r\n  season of the year.\r\n\r\n  ‘They set forth the indomitable courage and perseverance, the heroic\r\n  self-devotion and fortitude, the steady discipline, and stern resolve\r\n  of English soldiers.\r\n\r\n  ‘There is no mistaking the earnestness of purpose with which the\r\n  struggle has been maintained by Major-general Wilson’s army. Every\r\n  heart was in the cause; and while their numbers were, according to all\r\n  ordinary rule, fearfully unequal to the task, every man has given his\r\n  aid, wherever and in whatever manner it could most avail, to hasten\r\n  retribution upon a treacherous and murderous foe.\r\n\r\n  ‘In the name of outraged humanity, in memory of innocent blood\r\n  ruthlessly shed, and in acknowledgment of the first signal vengeance\r\n  inflicted upon the foulest treason, the governor-general in council\r\n  records his gratitude to Major-general Wilson and the brave army of\r\n  Delhi. He does so in the sure conviction that a like tribute awaits\r\n  them, not in England only, but wherever within the limits of\r\n  civilisation the news of their well-earned triumph shall reach.’\r\n\r\n  Some days afterwards, Lord Canning issued a more formal and complete\r\n  proclamation, of which a few paragraphs may here be given: ‘Delhi, the\r\n  focus of the treason and revolt which for four months have harassed\r\n  Hindostan, and the stronghold in which the mutinous army of Bengal has\r\n  sought to concentrate its power, has been wrested from the rebels. The\r\n  king is a prisoner in the palace. The head-quarters of Major-general\r\n  Wilson are established in the Dewani Khas [the “Elysium” of the Mogul\r\n  palace-builders, and of Moore’s _Lalla Rookh_]. A strong column is in\r\n  pursuit of the fugitives.\r\n\r\n  ‘Whatever may be the motives and passions by which the mutinous\r\n  soldiery, and those who are leagued with them, have been instigated to\r\n  faithlessness, rebellion, and crimes at which the heart sickens, it is\r\n  certain that they have found encouragement in the delusive belief that\r\n  India was weakly guarded by England, and that before the government\r\n  could gather together its strength against them, their ends would be\r\n  gained.\r\n\r\n  ‘They are now undeceived.\r\n\r\n  ‘Before a single soldier of the many thousands who are hastening from\r\n  England to uphold the supremacy of the British power has set foot on\r\n  these shores, the rebel force, where it was strongest and most united,\r\n  and where it had the command of unbounded military appliances, has\r\n  been destroyed or scattered by an army collected within the limits of\r\n  the Northwestern Provinces and the Punjaub alone.\r\n\r\n  ‘The work has been done before the support of those battalions which\r\n  have been collected in Bengal from the forces of the Queen in China\r\n  and in her Majesty’s eastern colonies could reach Major-general\r\n  Wilson’s army; and it is by the courage and endurance of that gallant\r\n  army alone, by the skill, sound judgment, and steady resolution of its\r\n  brave commander, and by the aid of some native chiefs true to their\r\n  allegiance, that, under the blessing of God, the head of the rebellion\r\n  has been crushed, and the cause of loyalty, humanity, and rightful\r\n  authority vindicated.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR J. E. W. INGLIS, defender of Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n                  THE STORY OF THE LUCKNOW RESIDENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were events that made a deeper impression on the minds of the\r\nEnglish public; military exploits more grand and comprehensive; episodes\r\nmore fatal, more harrowing; trains of operation in which well-known\r\nheroic names more frequently found place—but there was nothing in the\r\nwhole history of the Indian mutiny more admirable or worthy of study\r\nthan the defence of Lucknow by Brigadier Inglis and the British who were\r\nshut up with him in the Residency. Such a triumph over difficulties has\r\nnot often been placed upon record. Nothing but the most resolute\r\ndetermination, the most complete soldierly obedience, the most untiring\r\nwatchfulness, the most gentle care of those who from sex or age were\r\nunable to defend themselves, the most thorough reliance on himself and\r\non those around him, could have enabled that gallant man to bear up\r\nagainst the overwhelming difficulties which pressed upon him throughout\r\nthe months of July, August, and September. He occupied one corner of an\r\nenormous city, every other part of which was swarming with deadly\r\nenemies. No companion could leave him, without danger of instant death\r\nat the hands of the rebel sepoys and the Lucknow rabble; no friends\r\ncould succour him, seeing that anything less than a considerable\r\nmilitary force would have been cut off ere it reached the gates of the\r\nResidency; no food or drink, no medicines or comforts, no clothing, no\r\nammunition, in addition to that which was actually within the place at\r\nthe beginning of July, could be brought in. Great beyond expression were\r\nthe responsibilities and anxieties of one placed in command during\r\neighty-seven of such days—but there was also a moral grandeur in the\r\nsituation, never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn former chapters of this work,[94] much has been said concerning\r\nLucknow, its relations towards the British government on the one hand,\r\nand the court of Oude on the other, and the operations which enabled\r\nHavelock and Neill to bring a small reinforcement to its British\r\ngarrison towards the close of September; but what the garrison did and\r\nsuffered during the three months before this succour could reach them,\r\nhas yet to be told. The eventful story may be given conveniently in this\r\nplace, as one among certain intermediate subjects between the military\r\noperations of Sir Henry Havelock and those of Sir Colin Campbell.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour, by recapitulating a few facts, to realise in some\r\ndegree the position of the British at Lucknow when July commenced. The\r\ncity is a little over fifty miles from Cawnpore—exactly fifty to the\r\nAlum Bagh, fifty-three to the Residency, and fifty-seven to the\r\ncantonment. Most of its principal buildings, including the Residency,\r\nwere on the right or southwest bank of the river Goomtee. There was a\r\ncantonment Residency, and also a city Residency, at both of which,\r\naccording to his daily duties, it was the custom of the lamented Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence to dwell, before the troubles of the mutiny began; but it\r\nis the city Residency which has acquired a notoriety that will never\r\ndie. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the mere official mansion\r\ncalled the Residency bore but a small ratio to the area and the\r\nbuildings now known to English readers by that name. This ambiguity is\r\nnot without its inconveniences, for it denotes a Residency _within_ a\r\nResidency. Understanding the Residency to mean English Lucknow, the part\r\nof the city containing the offices and dwellings of most of the official\r\nEnglish residents, then it may be described as an irregular quadrangle a\r\nfew hundred yards square, jutting out at the north corner, and indented\r\nor contracted at the west. Within that limit were numerous residences\r\nand other buildings, some military, some political or civil, some\r\nprivate. The word ‘garrison’ was applied after the defence began, to\r\nbuildings which had previously been private or official residences; if,\r\ntherefore, the reader meets in one map with ‘Fayrer’s House,’ and in\r\nanother with ‘Fayrer’s Garrison,’ he must infer that a private residence\r\nwas fortified as a stronghold when the troubles began. In this chapter\r\nwe shall in most instances denominate the whole area as the\r\n_intrenchment_ or _enclosure_, with the Residency itself as one of the\r\nbuildings; and we shall furthermore retain the original designation of\r\n_house_, rather than _garrison_, for each of the minor residences. The\r\nnortheast side of the whole enclosure was nearly parallel with the\r\nriver; and the north corner was in near proximity to an iron bridge\r\ncarrying a road over the river to the cantonment.\r\n\r\nHow the British became cooped up within that enclosure, the reader\r\nalready knows; a few words will bring to recollection the facts fully\r\ntreated in the chapters lately cited. We have there seen that there were\r\nburnings of bungalows, and cartridge troubles, as early as April, in the\r\ncantonment of Lucknow; that on the 3d of May some of the native troops\r\nbecame insubordinate at the Moosa Bagh, a military post three or four\r\nmiles northwest of the Residency; that the 3d Oude infantry was broken\r\ninto fragments by this mutiny and its consequences; that Sir Henry\r\nLawrence sought to restore a healthy feeling by munificently rewarding\r\ncertain native soldiers who had remained faithful under temptation; that\r\ntowards the close of the month he attended very sedulously to various\r\nmagazines and military posts in and near the city; that he fortified the\r\nEnglish quarter by placing defence-works on and near the walls by which\r\nit was already three-fourths surrounded, and by setting up other\r\ndefences on the remaining fourth side; that he brought all the women and\r\nchildren, and all the sick, of the English community, into the space\r\nthus enclosed and guarded; that on the last two days of the month he had\r\nthe vexation of seeing most of the native troops in Lucknow and at the\r\ncantonment, belonging to the 13th, 48th, and 71st infantry, and the 7th\r\ncavalry, march off in mutiny towards Seetapoor; and that of the seven\r\nhundred who remained behind, he did not know how many he could trust\r\neven for a single hour. Next, under the month of June, we have seen that\r\nnearly all the districts of Oude fell one by one into the hands of the\r\ninsurgents, increasing at every stage the difficulties which beset Sir\r\nHenry as civil and military chief of the province; that he knew the\r\nmutineers were approaching Lucknow as a hostile army, and that he looked\r\naround in vain for reinforcements; that he paid off most of the sepoys\r\nstill remaining with him, glad to get rid of men whose continuance in\r\nfidelity could not be relied on; that he greatly strengthened the\r\nResidency, and also the Muchee Bhowan, a castellated structure northwest\r\nof it, formerly inhabited by the dependents of the King of Oude; that\r\nall his letters and messages to other places became gradually cut off,\r\nleaving him without news of the occurrences in other parts of India;\r\nthat he stored the Residency with six months’ provisions for a thousand\r\npersons as a means of preparing for the worst; and that on the last day\r\nof the month he fought a most disastrous battle with the mutineers at\r\nChinhut, seven or eight miles out of Lucknow. Then, when July opened, we\r\nhave seen the British in a critical and painful situation. Lawrence\r\nhaving lost many of his most valued troops, could no longer garrison the\r\nMuchee Bhowan, the cantonment, the dâk bungalow, or any place beyond the\r\nResidency. No European was safe except within the Residency enclosure;\r\nand how little safety was found there was miserably shewn on the 2d of\r\nthe month, when a shell from the insurgents wounded the great and good\r\nSir Henry Lawrence, causing his death on the 4th, after he had made over\r\nthe military command of Lucknow to Brigadier Inglis, and the civil\r\ncommand to Major Banks.\r\n\r\nThe Europeans, then, become prisoners within the walls of the Residency\r\nenclosure at Lucknow—officers, soldiers, revenue-collectors, judges,\r\nmagistrates, chaplains, merchants, ladies, children. And with them were\r\nsuch native soldiers and native servants as still remained faithful to\r\nthe British ‘raj.’ What was the exact number of persons thus thrown into\r\ninvoluntary companionship at the beginning of July appears somewhat\r\nuncertain; but an exact enumeration has been given of those who took up\r\ntheir quarters within the Residency on the 30th of May, when the\r\nsymptoms of mutiny rendered it no longer safe that the women and\r\nchildren should remain in the city or at the cantonment. The number was\r\n794.[95] The principal persons belonging to the European community at\r\nLucknow were the following: Sir Henry Lawrence, chief-commissioner;\r\nCaptain Hayes, military secretary; Major Anderson, chief-engineer;\r\nBrigadier Inglis, commandant of the garrison; Brigadier Handscomb,\r\ncommandant of the Oude brigade; Captain Carnegie, provost-marshal;\r\nCaptain Simons, chief artillery officer; Colonel Master, 7th native\r\ncavalry; Colonel Case and Major Low, H.M. 32d foot; Major Bruyère, 13th\r\nnative infantry; Major Apthorp, 41st native infantry; Colonel Palmer and\r\nMajor Bird, 48th native infantry; Colonel Halford, 71st native infantry;\r\nBrigadier Gray, Oude Irregulars; Mr Gubbins, finance commissioner; Mr\r\nOmmaney, judicial commissioner; Mr Cooper, chief-secretary. Some of\r\nthese died between the 30th of May and the 4th of July, but a few only.\r\nWhen the whole of the Europeans, officers and privates, had been hastily\r\ndriven by the mutiny from the cantonment to the Residency; when all the\r\nnative troops who remained faithful had been in like manner removed to\r\nthe same place; and when the Muchee Bhowan and all the other buildings\r\nin Lucknow had been abandoned by the British and their adherents—the\r\nintrenched position at and around the Residency became necessarily the\r\nhome of a very much larger number of persons; comprising, in addition to\r\nthe eight hundred or so just adverted to, many hundred British soldiers,\r\nand such of the sepoys as remained ‘true to their salt.’\r\n\r\nIn one sense, the Europeans were not taken by surprise. They had watched\r\nthe energetic exertions of Sir Henry during the month of June, in which\r\nhe exhibited so sagacious a foresight of troubles about to come. They\r\nhad seen him accumulate a vast store of provisions; procure tents and\r\nfirewood for the Residency; arm it gradually with twenty-four guns and\r\nten mortars; order in vast quantities of shot, shell, and gunpowder,\r\nfrom the Muchee Bhowan and the magazines; make arrangements for blowing\r\nup all the warlike _matériel_ which he could not bring in; bury his\r\nbarrels of powder beneath the earth in certain open spots in the\r\nenclosure; bury, in like manner, twenty-three lacs of the Company’s\r\nmoney, until more peaceful days should arrive; destroy many outlying\r\nbuildings which commanded or overtopped the Residency; organise all the\r\nmales in the place as component elements in a defensive force; bring in\r\neverything useful from the cantonment; build up, in front of the chief\r\nstructures in the enclosure, huge stacks of firewood, covered with earth\r\nand pierced for guns; bring the royal jewels and other valuables from\r\nthe king’s palace into the Residency for safety; and disarm—much to\r\ntheir chagrin—the servants and dependents of the late royal family. All\r\nthis the Europeans had seen the gallant Lawrence effect during the five\r\nweeks which preceded his death. Of the non-military men suddenly\r\nconverted into soldiers, Captain Anderson says: ‘Sir Henry Lawrence\r\ndeemed it expedient to enrol all the European and Eurasian writers in\r\nthe public offices as volunteers, and he directed arms and ammunition to\r\nbe served out to them. Some of these men were taken into the volunteer\r\ncavalry—which also comprised officers civil and military—and the\r\nremainder were drilled as infantry. At the commencement, when these men\r\nwere first brought together, to be regularly drilled by sergeants from\r\nHer Majesty’s 32d regiment, the chance of ever making them act in a body\r\nseemed almost hopeless. There were men of all ages, sizes, and figures.\r\nHere stood a tall athletic Englishman; there came a fat and heavy\r\nEurasian, with more width about the waist than across the chest; next to\r\nthe Eurasian came another of the same class, who looked like a\r\nporter-barrel, short and squat, and the belt round his waist very\r\nclosely resembled a hoop; not far off you observed an old, bent-double\r\nman, who seemed too weak to support the weight of his musket and\r\npouch.... We must not always judge by appearances. Amongst this\r\nawkward-looking body there sprang up, during the siege, bold, intrepid,\r\nand daring men!’\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these preparations, however, the calamity fell upon the\r\ninmates too suddenly. The fatal result of the battle of Chinhut\r\ncompelled every one to take refuge within the Residency enclosure; even\r\nthose who had hitherto lived in the city, rushed in, without\r\npreparation, many leaving all their property behind them except a few\r\ntrifling articles. No one was, or ever could be, bitter against Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence; yet were there many criticisms, many expressions of\r\nregret, at the policy which led to the battle; and it is unquestionable\r\nthat much of the misery subsequently borne arose from the precipitate\r\narrangements rendered inevitable on the 30th of June and the following\r\nday. When they saw the rebels march into Lucknow, invest the Residency,\r\nset up a howitzer-battery in front of it, and loophole the walls of\r\nhouses for musketry, the Europeans could no longer wait to provide for\r\ndomestic and personal comforts, or even conveniences: they hastened to\r\ntheir prison-house with such resources as could be hastily provided.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a British community thrown most unexpectedly into close\r\ncompanionship, under circumstances trying to all. It is no wonder that\r\nsome among the number kept diaries of the strange scenes they witnessed,\r\nthe sad distresses they bore; nor could there be other than a strong\r\nyearning on the part of the English public for a perusal of such diaries\r\nor narratives. Hence the publication of several small but deeply\r\ninteresting volumes relating to the defence of Lucknow—one by Mr Rees, a\r\nCalcutta merchant, who happened, unluckily for himself, to be at Lucknow\r\nwhen the troubles began; another by the wife of one of the two English\r\nchaplains; a third by Captain Anderson; a fourth by a staff-officer.[96]\r\nSuch diaries, when used in illustration and correction one of another,\r\nare and must ever be the best sources of information concerning the\r\ninner life of Lucknow during that extraordinary period.\r\n\r\nTerrible was the confusion within the Residency enclosure for the first\r\nfew days. Those who had hastened into the place from other spots were\r\nendeavouring to find or make something which they could call ‘home;’\r\nthose who had been wounded at Chinhut were suffering in agony within the\r\nwalls of a building hastily fitted up for them; while the military men\r\nlooked anxiously around at the defences of the place, to see what could\r\nbe done to keep the enemy out. When the officers, civil or military,\r\nwent on the roofs of the houses, they had the mortification of seeing\r\nthe mutineers gradually concentrating their forces towards the\r\nResidency; they saw, also, that the prisoners had escaped from the\r\njails, to join the ranks of those who hated or at any rate opposed the\r\nFeringhees.\r\n\r\nArrangements had for some time been in progress, and were now hastily\r\ncompleted, to fortify the principal buildings within the enclosure. If\r\nwe imagine this English Lucknow to be an irregular diamond-shaped\r\nenclosure, with the acute angles very nearly north and south; then it\r\nmay be said that the south angle was the nearest point to the Cawnpore\r\nroad, and the north angle the nearest to the iron bridge over the\r\nGoomtee towards the cantonment. Near the south point was the house of\r\nCaptain Anderson, standing in the middle of a garden or open court\r\nsurrounded by a wall; the house was defended by barricades, and\r\nloopholed for musketry; while the garden was strengthened by a trench\r\nand rows of palisades. Next to this house, and communicating with it by\r\na hole in the wall, was a newly constructed defence-work that received\r\nthe name of the Cawnpore Battery, mounted with guns, and intended to\r\ncommand some of the houses and streets adjacent to the Cawnpore road. Mr\r\nDeprat’s house had a verandah which, for defensive purposes, was blocked\r\nup with a mud-wall six feet high and two feet and a half thick; this\r\nwall was continued in a straight line to that of the next house, and\r\ncarried up to a height of nine feet, with loopholes for musketry. Next\r\nto this was a house occupied as a school for boys of the Martinière\r\nCollege,[97] strengthened by a stockade of beams placed before it; and\r\nadjacent was a street or road defended by stockades, barricades, and a\r\ntrench. Further towards the western angle of the enclosure was a\r\nbuilding formerly known as the Daroo Shuffa or King’s Hospital, but now\r\ncalled the Brigade Mess-house, having a well-protected and lofty terrace\r\nwhich commanded an exterior building called Johannes’ house. In its rear\r\nwas a parallelogram, divided by buildings into two squares or courts,\r\noccupied in various ways by officers and their families. Then came\r\ngroups of low brick buildings around two quadrangles called the Sikh\r\nSquares, on the tops of which erections were thrown up to enable the\r\ntroops to fire out upon the town. Separated from these by a narrow lane\r\nwas the house of Mr Gubbins, the financial commissioner; the lane was\r\nbarricaded by earth, beams, and brambles; the buildings were\r\nstrengthened in every way; while the extreme western point was a battery\r\nformed by Mr Gubbins himself. Then, passing along the northwest side\r\nwere seen in turn the racket-court, the slaughter-house, the sheep-pen,\r\nand the butcher-yard, all near the boundary of the fortified position,\r\nand separated one from another by wide open spaces; there was a\r\nstorehouse for _bhoosa_ (cut chaff for cattle-food), and a guardhouse\r\nfor Europeans; and all the buildings were loopholed for musketry. In the\r\nrear of the Bhoosa Intrenchment, as this post was called, was Mr\r\nOmmaney’s house, guarded by a deep ditch and a cactus-hedge, and\r\nprovided with two pieces of ordnance. North of the slaughter-house a\r\nmortar-battery was formed. The English church was the next important\r\nbuilding towards the north; it was speedily converted into a granary;\r\nand in the church-yard was formed a mortar-battery capable of shelling\r\nall the portion of the city between it and the iron bridge. This\r\nchurch-yard was destined afterwards to present melancholy proofs of the\r\nlarge number of deaths among the English defenders of the place. Beyond\r\nthe church-yard was Lieutenant Innes’s house, in dangerous proximity to\r\nmany buildings held by the rebels, and bounded on two sides by a garden;\r\nit was a difficult but most important duty to strengthen this house as\r\nmuch as possible. The extreme northern part of the whole enclosure, not\r\nfive hundred yards from the iron bridge, was scarcely susceptible of\r\ndefence in itself; but it was fully protected by the Redan Battery,\r\nconstructed by Captain Fulton: this was decidedly the best battery in\r\nthe whole place, commanding a wide sweep of city and country on both\r\nbanks of the river. Along the northeast side, connected at one end with\r\nthe Redan, was a series of earthworks, fascines, and sand-bags,\r\nloopholed for musketry, and mounted with guns. A long range of sloping\r\ngarden-ground was turned into a glacis in front of the line of\r\nintrenchment just named. In the centre of the northern half of the whole\r\nplace was the Residency proper, the official home of the\r\nchief-commissioner; this was a large and beautiful brick building, which\r\nwas speedily made to accommodate many hundred persons; and as it was on\r\nhigh ground, the terrace-roof commanded a view of the whole city—to\r\nwhoever would incur the peril of standing there.[98] The hospital, a\r\nvery large building near the eastern angle of the whole enclosure, had\r\nonce been the banqueting-room for the British resident at the King of\r\nOude’s court; but it was now occupied as a hospital, a dispensary,\r\nofficers’ quarters, and a laboratory for making fuses and cartridges; it\r\nwas defended by mortars and guns in various directions. The Ballee or\r\nBailey guard was near the hospital, but on a lower level; various parts\r\nof it were occupied as a store-room, a treasury, and barracks; the\r\nportion really constituting the Bailey guard gate, the station of the\r\nsepoys formerly guarding the Residency, was unluckily beyond the limits\r\nof the enclosure, and was productive of more harm than good to the\r\ngarrison; as a means of security, the gateway was blocked up with earth,\r\nand defended by guns. Dr Fayrer’s house, south of the hospital, had a\r\nterrace-roof whence rifles were frequently brought to bear on the\r\ninsurgents, and near it a gun or two were placed in position. Southward\r\nagain was the civil dispensary; and near this the post-office, a\r\nbuilding which, from its position and construction, was one of the most\r\nimportant in the whole place; soldiers were barracked in the interior, a\r\nshell and fuse room was set apart, the engineers made it their\r\nhead-quarters, several families resided in it, and guns and mortars were\r\nplanted in and around it. The financial-office, and the house of Mrs\r\nSago (mistress of a charity-school), were on the southeast side of the\r\nenclosure, and were with great difficulty brought into a defensive\r\nstate. The judicial office, near Sago’s house, could only be protected\r\nfrom an open lane by a wall of fascines and earth. The jail, near the\r\nCawnpore Gate, was converted into barracks; and the native hospital\r\nbecame a tolerably sheltered place. The Begum’s Kothee, or ‘lady’s\r\nhouse’ (formerly belonging to a native lady of rank), was in the centre\r\nof the whole enclosure; it comprised many buildings, which were\r\nafterwards parcelled off as commissariat store-rooms, cooking-rooms, and\r\ndwellings for officers’ families.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the Residency at Lucknow, so often mentioned\r\nin connection with the history of the mutiny, was a small town rather\r\nthan a single building. But it will also be seen that this small town\r\nwas most dangerously placed, in juxtaposition to a large city full of\r\nhostile inhabitants and revolted sepoys. Before Sir Henry Lawrence took\r\nit in hand in June, it could be approached and entered from all sides;\r\nand at the beginning of July only a part of the defence-works above\r\ndescribed were completed. The officers had to fight and build, to suffer\r\nand work, to watch and fortify, day after day, under privations\r\ndifficult for others to appreciate. The various houses, more frequently\r\ndesignated _garrisons_ by those engaged in the siege, did really deserve\r\nthat title in a military sense; for they were gradually transformed into\r\nlittle forts or strongholds, each placed under one commander, and each\r\ndefended indomitably against all attacks from the enemy. To give one as\r\nan example of many—Captain Anderson, who had resided at Lucknow, as\r\nassistant-commissioner, ever since the annexation of Oude, made his own\r\nhouse one of these fortified posts; he had under him eighteen men and\r\none subaltern officer, with whose aid he withstood a _five months’_\r\nsiege, notwithstanding the enemy had nine 9-pounder guns playing on his\r\nhouse. The wall of the compound around the house was levelled, and a\r\nstockade put in its place; within the stockade was a ditch, then an\r\nearthwork five feet high, and then another ditch with pointed bamboos,\r\nforming a _chevaux-de-frise_. It was, in truth, a small citadel, and one\r\nvery important for the safety of the whole place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Plan of Residency and part of the City of Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe siege began on the 1st of July, the day following the disastrous\r\nbattle of Chinhut. It was indeed a siege, even more so than that to\r\nwhich Sir Hugh Wheeler had been exposed at Cawnpore; for there was not\r\nonly constant firing of musketry, cannon, and mortars, by the\r\nmutineers against the Residency; but there were also subterranean\r\nmines or galleries dug from the outer streets under the enclosing\r\nwall, to blow up the defenders and their defence-works. At every hour\r\nof the day, at every corner of the Residency enclosure, was it\r\nnecessary to keep strict watch. A telegraph, worked at the top of one\r\nof the buildings, gave signals to the officers at the Muchee Bhowan,\r\ndirecting them to blow up that fort, and retire to the Residency with\r\nthe treasure and the guns. This was a most perilous enterprise, but\r\nunder the skilful superintendence of Captain Francis and Lieutenant\r\nHuxhain it succeeded; 240 barrels of gunpowder, and 600,000 rounds of\r\nammunition, were blown into the air, to prevent them from falling into\r\nthe hands of the enemy; and then the few officers and soldiers marched\r\nfrom the Muchee Bhowan to the Residency, where they helped to\r\nstrengthen the wofully small number of efficient fighting-men.[99] All\r\nthis was done by midnight on the 1st. On the 2d, while resting on a\r\ncouch after his exhausting and anxious labours, Sir Henry Lawrence was\r\nstruck by the shell which took away his valuable life; for it was a\r\nday on which _ten thousand_ rebels were firing shells, balls, and\r\nbullets into or at the Residency. Miss Palmer, daughter of Colonel\r\nPalmer of the 48th, had her thigh shattered by a ball which entered\r\none of the buildings; and Mr Ommaney was among the wounded. On the 3d\r\ndire confusion was everywhere visible; for all felt that their great\r\nleader would die of his wound: none had yet fully realised the\r\nappalling difficulties of their position; yet were they distracted by\r\nfamily anxieties on the one hand, and public duty on the other. On the\r\n4th, Lawrence descended to the grave; on that day his nephew, Mr G. H.\r\nLawrence, was wounded; and on that day, also, all order or legitimate\r\ntrade ceased in the city, for marauders and budmashes plundered the\r\nshops. No military honours marked the funeral of Sir Henry; there was\r\nneither time nor opportunity for any display; a hurried prayer was\r\nrepeated amid the booming of the enemy’s cannon, and a few spadefuls\r\nof earth speedily covered the mortal remains of one whose good name\r\nwas not likely soon to die.[100] On or about the 5th, the enemy seized\r\nthe building known as Johannes’ house, from which they were able to\r\nkeep up a deadly fire of musketry against Anderson’s house, the jail\r\nbarracks, the post-office, and the Begum’s Kothee; it was afterwards\r\nmuch regretted that this house had not been included among those\r\ndemolished by Sir Henry. On the 6th and 7th, the harassing fire\r\ncontinued from various points. Some of the bhoosa, or chopped straw\r\nfor bullocks’ fodder, had been left in an ill-defended place; it was\r\nfired by the enemy, and totally consumed, placing in imminent danger a\r\npowder-magazine at no great distance. Major Francis had both his legs\r\ncut off by a cannon-ball, while quietly sitting in the mess-room; Mr\r\nMarshall, an opium-merchant, was killed, and the Rev. Mr Polehampton\r\nwas wounded, about this time. It was a cruel vexation to the garrison\r\nto see and feel how much they were suffering through the skilful\r\ngunnery which the British had taught to the miscreants now in the\r\ninsurgent army. The enemy’s artillerymen displayed great rapidity,\r\ningenuity, and perseverance, in planting batteries in positions\r\ntotally unlooked for; some even on house-tops, and others in spots\r\nwhere the garrison could not respond to their fire. It was more than\r\nsuspected that Europeans were among them; indeed one reckless member\r\nof an otherwise worthy English family was recognised among the number,\r\nbringing discredit upon brothers and cousins who were at that very\r\ntime gallantly serving the Company elsewhere. Many of the enemy’s\r\nbatteries were not more than fifty or a hundred yards distant from the\r\nmarginal buildings of the Residency enclosure; the balls knocked down\r\npillars and verandahs with fearful accuracy. Most of the deaths,\r\nhowever, from ten to twenty a day, were caused by musket-bullets; the\r\nenemy had many good marksmen—especially a rebel African, who used his\r\nmusket with deadly effect from Johannes’ house. If Sir Henry Lawrence\r\nhad been a sterner soldier, if he had not been influenced by such\r\nconsiderate feelings for the opinions and prejudices of others, the\r\nBritish would have lost fewer lives than they did in Lucknow. We have\r\nalready said that many of the houses around the Residency were\r\ndestroyed by orders of Sir Henry, to prevent the enemy from converting\r\nthem into strongholds; but it was afterwards known that the military\r\nofficers under him urged the necessity for a still greater demolition.\r\nBrigadier Inglis, when at a later date he made a military report of\r\nthe siege and the defence, adverted to this point in very decisive\r\nlanguage. ‘When the blockade commenced,’ he said, ‘only two of our\r\nbatteries were completed, part of the defences were yet in an\r\nunfinished condition, and the buildings in the immediate vicinity,\r\nwhich gave cover to the enemy, were only very partially cleared away.\r\nIndeed, our heaviest losses have been caused by the fire from the\r\nenemy’s sharpshooters, stationed in the adjoining mosques and houses\r\nof the native nobility, to the necessity of destroying which the\r\nattention of Sir Henry had been repeatedly drawn by the staff of\r\nengineers; but his invariable reply was: “Spare the holy places, and\r\nprivate property too, as far as possible;” and we have consequently\r\nsuffered severely from our very tenderness to the religious prejudices\r\nand respect to the rights of our rebellious citizens and soldiery. As\r\nsoon as the enemy had thoroughly completed the investment of the\r\nResidency, they occupied these houses, some of which were within easy\r\npistol-shot of our barricades, in immense force, and rapidly made\r\nloopholes on those sides which bore on our post, from which they kept\r\nup a terrific and incessant fire day and night.’\r\n\r\nThe second week of the siege began, bringing with it an augmentation of\r\nthe troubles already bitterly tasted. One day the Bailey guard would be\r\nfiercely attacked, another day the Cawnpore Battery, demanding incessant\r\nwatchfulness on the part of the officers and men posted at those\r\noutworks. Brigadier Inglis sent off letters and messages to Cawnpore and\r\nAllahabad; but none reached their destination, the messengers being all\r\nintercepted on the way. He did not know how his missives fared; he only\r\nknew that no aid, no intelligence, reached him, and he measured his\r\nresources with an anxious heart. Sometimes a few officers would retire\r\nto snatch a little rest just before midnight, and then would be roused\r\nat one or two o’clock in the morning by a message that Gubbins’s\r\nhouse—or ‘garrison,’ as most of the houses within the enclosure were now\r\ncalled—or the Bailey guard, or some other important post, was closely\r\nattacked. Sleep, food, everything was forgotten at such moments, except\r\nthe one paramount duty of repelling the enemy at the attacked point. One\r\nday a rebel musketeer pushed forward to such a spot as enabled him to\r\nshoot Lieutenant Charlton within side the very door of the church. The\r\nenemy sometimes fired logs of wood from their cannon and mortars, as if\r\ndeficient in shot and shell; but they did not slacken from this or any\r\nother cause; they sent shots which set the commissioner’s house on fire,\r\ncausing much danger and difficulty in extinguishing the flames; and it\r\nbecame perilous for any one within the enclosure to be seen for an\r\ninstant by the enemy—so deadly accurate were their marksmen. Once now\r\nand then the officers with a few men, longing for a dash that would\r\ninspirit them in the midst of their troubles, would astonish the enemy\r\nby making a sortie beyond the defences, spiking a gun or two,\r\ndespatching a few of the rebels, and hastening back to the enclosure.\r\nLives being, however, too valuable to be risked for advantages so small\r\nas these, the brigadier sought rather to discourage than encourage such\r\nacts of heroism. Mr Bryson and Lieutenant Baxter were among the many who\r\nfell at this time. The officers did men’s duty, the civilians did\r\nmilitary duty; for there were not hands enough to guard properly the\r\nnumerous threatened points. One night all spare hands would be called\r\nupon to cover with tarpaulin the bhoosa stacks in the racket-court; on\r\nanother, civilians who never before did labourers’ work were called up\r\nto dig earth and to carry sand-bags for batteries or breastworks; or\r\nthey would stand sentinels all night in drenching rains. And then,\r\nperhaps on returning to their houses or ‘garrisons’ in the morning, they\r\nwould find them untenable by reason of the torrent of balls and bullets\r\nto which they had been exposed. The open spots between the several\r\nbuildings became gradually more and more dangerous. ‘A man could not\r\nshew his nose,’ says Captain Anderson, ‘without hearing the whiz of\r\nbullets close to his head. The shot, too, came from every direction; and\r\nwhen a poor fellow had nearly jerked his head off his shoulders in\r\nmaking humble salutations to passing bullets, he would have his penance\r\ndisagreeably changed into a sudden and severe contortion of the whole\r\nbody to avoid a round shot or shell. So soon as a man left his post he\r\nhad no time for meditation; his only plan was to proceed rapidly. In\r\nfact, to walk slow was in some places very, very dangerous; and many a\r\npoor fellow was shot, who was too proud to run past places where bullets\r\ndanced on the walls like a handful of pease in a frying-pan.’\r\n\r\nThe third week arrived. Now were the gallant defenders still more\r\ndistressed and indignant than they had hitherto been; for the enemy\r\ncommenced firing at the Brigade Mess, where large numbers of ladies and\r\nchildren had taken refuge; attacks were thus made on those who could not\r\ndefend themselves, and the officers and soldiers found their attention\r\ndistracted from necessary duties at other points. Anderson’s house had\r\nby this time become so riddled with shot, that the stores were removed\r\nfrom it; and Deprat’s house, similarly battered by the enemy, in like\r\nmanner became uninhabitable. The buildings near the boundary naturally\r\nsuffered most; and, as a consequence, those nearer the centre became\r\nmore and more crowded with inmates. Day by day did officers and men work\r\nhard to strengthen the defences. Mortars were placed behind the\r\nearthwork at the post-office, to jet forth shells upon the troublesome\r\nJohannes’ house; stockades and traverses were made, to screen the\r\nentrance to the Residency, within which so many persons were domiciled.\r\nNevertheless the attack increased in vigour quite as rapidly as the\r\ndefence; for the insurgents appear to have received large\r\nreinforcements. Their custom was to fire all night, so as to afford the\r\ngarrison no rest, and thus tire them out; they so pointed a mortar as to\r\nsend two shells directly into the Residency itself; they commenced a new\r\nbattery, to bear upon Gubbins’s house; their cannon-balls—of which there\r\nwere indications of a new supply—fell upon and into Fayrer’s and\r\nGubbins’s houses, the post-office and the Brigade Mess; a shot burst\r\nthrough a room in which many of the principal officers were\r\nbreakfasting; a mine was sprung inside the Water Gate, intended to blow\r\nup the Redan Battery; and at the same time vigorous attacks were made\r\nwith guns and musketry on almost every part of the enclosure, as if to\r\nbewilder the garrison with crushing onslaughts on every side. The pen\r\ncannot describe the state of incessant anxiety into which these daily\r\nproceedings threw the forlorn inmates of the place: no one could look\r\nforward to a night of sleep after a harassing day; for the booming of\r\ncannon, and the anticipated visit of a cannon-ball or a mortar-shell,\r\ndrove away sleep from most eyelids. It was on the 20th that the\r\nspecially vigorous attack, just adverted to, was made; so general and\r\nenergetic, that it almost partook of the character of a storming or\r\nassault of a beleaguered city. Nothing but the most untiring assiduity\r\ncould have saved the garrison from destruction. Every one who could\r\nhandle a musket or load a cannon, did so; others helped to construct\r\nstockades and earthen barriers; and even many of the sick and wounded\r\nrose from their pallets, staggered along to the points most attacked,\r\nsought to aid in the general cause, and in some instances dropped dead\r\nwhile so doing. Almost every building was the object of a distinct\r\nattack. The Redan Battery was fortunately not blown up, the enemy having\r\nmiscalculated the distance of their mine; but the explosion was followed\r\nby a desperate struggle on the glacis outside, in which the insurgents\r\nwere mowed down by grape-shot before they would abandon their attempt to\r\nenter at that point. At Innes’s house, Lieutenant Loughnan maintained a\r\nlong and fierce contest against a body of insurgents twentyfold more\r\nnumerous than the little band who aided him; before they desisted, no\r\nless than a hundred dead and wounded were carried off by the rebels. The\r\nfinancial office and Sago’s house, entirely defended by non-military\r\nmen, bore up bravely against the torrent brought against them. The\r\njudicial office, under Captain Germon, and Anderson’s house, under\r\nCaptain Anderson, were not only successfully defended, but the handful\r\nof troops aided other points where there were no military men. The\r\nBrigade Mess, Gubbins’s house, the houses near the Cawnpore Battery—all\r\nwere attacked with vigour, but every attack was repelled.\r\n\r\nWhen the muster-roll was called after these exciting scenes, it was\r\nfound that many valuable lives had been lost. Yet is it truly remarkable\r\nthat less than thirty persons of all classes in the garrison were killed\r\nor wounded on the 20th. No officer was killed; among the wounded were\r\nCaptains Lowe and Forbes, Lieutenants Edmonstone and M’Farlane, and\r\nAdjutant Smith. Mr Rees asserts that the loss of the enemy, during seven\r\nhours of incessant fighting, could hardly have been less than a thousand\r\nmen. It was the grape-shot poured forth from the garrison that worked\r\nthis terrible destruction. The week had been attended with its usual\r\nlist of isolated losses within the enclosure. On one day Lieutenant\r\nLester was killed; on another, Lieutenants Bryce and O’Brien were\r\nwounded; and on another, Lieutenant Harmer was laid low.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the fourth week of the siege found Brigadier Inglis and\r\nhis companions stout in heart, but yet depressed in spirits; proud of\r\nwhat they had achieved on the 20th, but fearful that many more such\r\ndangers would beset them. The detachment of the 32d foot was that on\r\nwhich Inglis most relied in a military point of view, and in that the\r\ncasualties had been 150 in three weeks. He had sent out repeated\r\nmessengers, but had hitherto obtained not a word of news from any\r\nquarter; shut out from the world of India, he knew of nothing but his\r\nown cares and responsibilities. On the 23d, however, a gleam of joy shot\r\nthrough the garrison; a messenger, amid imminent peril, had been to\r\nCawnpore, and brought back news of Havelock’s victories in the Doab.\r\nInglis immediately sent him off again, with an urgent request to the\r\ngallant general to advance with his column to Lucknow as quickly as\r\npossible. The English residents began to count the days that must elapse\r\nbefore Havelock could arrive—a hopeful thing at the time, but bitterly\r\ndisappointing afterwards; for they knew not how or why it was that\r\nsuccour did not arrive. Whatever might be the hopes or fears for the\r\nfuture, there was an ever-present danger which demanded daily and hourly\r\nattention. Although mortified by their late defeat, the enemy did not on\r\nthat account give up their attacks. On narrowly watching, the engineers\r\ndetected the enemy forming a mine beneath the ground from Johannes’\r\nhouse to the Sikh Square and the Brigade Mess; they could hear the\r\nminers at their subterraneous work, and they did what military engineers\r\nare accustomed to in such cases—run out a countermine, and destroy the\r\nenemy’s handiwork by an explosion. Above ground the attack was\r\nmaintained chiefly by artillery, the hurling of balls, shells,\r\nshrapnels, and those abominable compounds of pitchy and sulphureous\r\nsubstances which artillerymen call ‘stinkpots.’ The breakfast-table of\r\nthe officers at the post-office was one morning visited by an eight-inch\r\nshell, which fell on it without exploding. On the 25th a letter arrived\r\nfrom Colonel Tytler at Cawnpore, the first received from any quarter\r\nthroughout July; for the former messenger had brought rumours concerning\r\nHavelock, not a letter or a message. Great was the joy at learning that\r\nHavelock intended to advance to Lucknow; and Inglis at once sent off to\r\nhim a plan of the city, to aid his proceedings—offering the messenger\r\nfive thousand rupees if he safely brought back an answer. An anxious\r\ntime indeed was it for all, and well might they look out for succour.\r\nMajor Banks, the civil commissioner appointed by Sir Henry Lawrence, was\r\nshot dead while reconnoitring from the top of an outhouse; he was an\r\nofficer who had served nearly thirty years in India, and who, both as a\r\nsoldier and a linguist, had won a good name. Dr Brydon was wounded; the\r\nRev. Mr Polehampton was killed, as were Lieutenants Lewin, Shepherd, and\r\nArcher, and many others whose lives were valuable, not only to their\r\nfamilies, but to all in the garrison. The death of Major Banks increased\r\nthe cares and responsibilities of Brigadier Inglis, who, now that there\r\nwas no chief-commissioner, felt the necessity of placing the whole\r\ncommunity under strict military-garrison rules.\r\n\r\nIn the official dispatch afterwards prepared by Inglis, full justice was\r\ndone to the ingenuity and perseverance of the besiegers. Speaking of the\r\nlarge guns placed in batteries on every side of the enclosure, he said:\r\n‘These were planted all round our post at small distances, some being\r\nactually within fifty yards of our defences, but in places where our own\r\nheavy guns could not reply to them; while the perseverance and ingenuity\r\nof the enemy in erecting barricades in front of and around their guns,\r\nin a very short time rendered all attempts to silence them by musketry\r\nentirely unavailing. Neither could they be effectually silenced by\r\nshells, by reason of their extreme proximity to our position, and\r\nbecause, moreover, the enemy had recourse to digging very narrow\r\ntrenches about eight feet in depth in rear of each gun, in which the men\r\nlay while our shells were flying, and which so effectually concealed\r\nthem, even while working the gun, that our baffled sharpshooters could\r\nonly see their hands while in the act of loading.’\r\n\r\nAnd now, the reader may ask, what were the ladies and children doing\r\nduring this terrible month of July; and how did the officers and men\r\nfare in their domestic and personal matters? It is a sad tale, full of\r\ntrouble and misery; and yet it is a heroic tale. No one flinched, no one\r\ndreamed for an instant of succumbing to the enemy. It must be\r\nremembered, as a beginning of all the privations, that the Europeans\r\nwent into the Residency very scantily supplied with personal\r\nnecessaries. When the cantonment was burned during the mutiny of the\r\n31st of May, much property belonging to the officers was destroyed; and\r\nwhen every one hurried in for shelter after the disastrous 30th of June,\r\nno time was allowed for making purchases in the city, or bringing in\r\nproperty from bungalows or storehouses outside the official stronghold.\r\nHence every one was driven to make the best of such commodities as had\r\nbeen secured by the last day of June. Even during the greater part of\r\nthat month the troubles were many; the enclosure Residency was full of\r\nofficers and men, all hard at work; the heat was excessive; cholera,\r\ndysentery, and small-pox were at their deadly work; the church being\r\nfull of grain, those who sought religious aid in time of need met for\r\ndivine service in any available spot; most of the native servants ran\r\naway when the troubles began; and many of them ended their service by\r\nrobbing their masters.\r\n\r\nHow July opened for the British, may faintly be imagined. The\r\ncommissariat chief was ill; no one could promptly organise that office\r\nunder the sudden emergency; the food and draught bullocks, unattended\r\nto, roamed about the place; and many of them were shot, or tumbled into\r\nwells. Terrible work was it for the officers to bury the killed\r\nbullocks, lest their decaying carcasses should taint the air in\r\nexcessively hot weather. Some of the artillery horses were driven mad\r\nfor want of food and water. Day after day, after working hard in the\r\ntrenches, the officers had to employ themselves at night in burying dead\r\nbullocks and horses—officers, be it understood; for the men were all\r\nemployed as sentries or in other duties. It was not until after many\r\ndays that they could turn out of the enclosure all the spare horses, and\r\nsecure the rest. As the heat continued, and as the dead bodies of\r\nanimals increased in number, the stench became overpowering, and was one\r\nof the greatest grievances to which the garrison were exposed; the\r\ntemperature at night was often less patiently borne than that by day,\r\nand the officers and men were troubled by painful boils. Even when wet\r\ndays occurred, matters were not much improved; for the hot vapours from\r\nstagnant pools engendered fever, cholera, dysentery, and diarrhœa. The\r\nchildren died rapidly, and the hospital-rooms were always full; the sick\r\nand wounded could not be carried to upper apartments, because the\r\nenemy’s shot and shell rendered all such places untenable. The officers\r\nwere put on half-rations early in the month; and even those rations they\r\nin many cases had to cook for themselves, owing to the disappearance of\r\nthe native servants. The English ladies suffered unnumbered privations\r\nand inconveniences. The clergyman’s wife, in her _Diary_, told of the\r\nvery first day of the siege in these words: ‘No sooner was the first gun\r\nfired, than the ladies and children—congregated in large numbers in Dr\r\nFayrer’s house—were all hurried down stairs into an underground room\r\ncalled the Tye Khana, damp, dark, and gloomy as a vault, and excessively\r\ndirty. Here we sat all day, feeling too miserable, anxious, and\r\nterrified to speak, the gentlemen occasionally coming down to reassure\r\nus and tell us how things were going on. —— was nearly all the day in\r\nthe hospital, where the scene was terrible; the place so crowded with\r\nwounded and dying men that there was no room to pass between them, and\r\neverything in a state of indescribable misery, discomfort, and\r\nconfusion.’ In the preceding month it had been a hardship for the ladies\r\nto be deprived of the luxuries of Anglo-Indian life; but they were now\r\ndriven to measure comforts by a different standard. They were called\r\nupon to sweep their own rooms, draw water from the wells, wash their own\r\nclothes, and perform all the menial duties of a household; while their\r\nhusbands or fathers were cramped up in little outhouses or stables, or\r\nanywhere that might afford temporary shelter at night. When food became\r\nscanty and disease prevalent, these troubles were of course augmented,\r\nand difference of rank became almost obliterated where all had to suffer\r\nalike. Many families were huddled together in one large room, and all\r\nprivacy was destroyed. The sick and wounded were, as may be supposed, in\r\nsad plight; for, kind as the rest were, there were too many harassing\r\nduties to permit them to help adequately those who were too weak to help\r\nthemselves. Officers and men were lying about in the hospital rooms,\r\ncovered with blood and often with vermin; the _dhobees_ or washermen\r\nwere too weak-handed for the preservation of cleanliness, and few of the\r\nBritish had the luxury of a change of linen; the windows being kept\r\nclosed and barricaded, to prevent the entrance of shot from without, the\r\npestilential atmosphere carried off almost as many unfortunates as the\r\nenemy’s missiles. The writer of the _Lady’s Diary_, whose narrative is\r\nseldom relieved by one gleam of cheerfulness, departs from her habitual\r\nsadness when describing the mode in which eleven ladies and seven\r\nchildren slept on the floor in the Tye Khana or cellar, ‘fitting into\r\neach other like bits into a puzzle.’ Chairs being few in number, most of\r\nthe ladies sat on the floor, and at meal-times placed their plates on\r\ntheir knees. The cellar being perfectly dark, candles were lighted at\r\nmeal-times. The reason for keeping so many persons in this subterranean\r\nabode was to lessen the chance of their being shot in any upper\r\napartment. Of one torment, the flies, every person complained bitterly\r\nwho was shut up in the Residency enclosure on those fearfully hot days.\r\nMr Rees says: ‘They daily increased to such an extent that we at last\r\nbegan to feel life irksome, more on their account than from any other of\r\nour numerous troubles. In the day, flies; at night, mosquitoes. But the\r\nlatter were bearable; the former intolerable. Lucknow had always been\r\nnoted for its flies; but at no time had they been known to be so\r\ntroublesome. The mass of putrid matter that was allowed to accumulate,\r\nthe rains, the commissariat stores, the hospital, had attracted these\r\ninsects in incredible numbers. The Egyptians could not possibly have\r\nbeen more molested than we were by this pest. They swarmed in millions,\r\nand though we blew daily some hundreds of thousands into the air, this\r\nseemed to make no diminution in their numbers; the ground was still\r\nblack with them, and the tables were literally covered with these cursed\r\nflies. We could not sleep in the day on account of them. We could\r\nscarcely eat. Our beef, of which we got a tolerably small quantity every\r\nday, was usually studded with them; and when I ate my miserable boiled\r\nlentil-soup and unleavened bread, a number of scamps flew into my mouth,\r\nor tumbled into and floated about in my plate.’\r\n\r\nLet us proceed, and watch the military operations of the month of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThe fifth week of the siege opened with the same scenes as before,\r\ndeepened in intensity. The enemy, it is true, did not attack with more\r\nvigour, but the defenders were gradually weakened in every one of their\r\nresources—except courage, and the resolution to bear all rather than\r\nyield to the enemy. Colonel Tytler’s letter had afforded hope that the\r\nrelieving column under Havelock would arrive at Lucknow before the end\r\nof July; but when the 30th and 31st had passed, and the 1st and 2d of\r\nAugust had passed also, then were their hopes cruelly dashed. It\r\nrequired all the energy of Brigadier Inglis to keep up the spirits of\r\nhimself and his companions under the disappointment. He did not know,\r\nand was destined to remain for some time in ignorance, that Havelock had\r\nbeen forced to return to Cawnpore, owing to the losses suffered by his\r\nheroic little band. About the beginning of the month, great numbers of\r\nadditional rebel sepoys entered Lucknow, increasing the phalanx opposed\r\nto the British. They began a new mine near Sago’s house, and another\r\nnear the Brigade Mess, in which many of the ladies and children were\r\nsheltered; and it required all the activity of the officers to frustrate\r\nthese underground enemies. The rebels planted a 24-pounder near the iron\r\nbridge, to batter the church and the Residency. On one day a shell burst\r\nin a room of the Begum’s Kothee, where Lieutenant James and Mr Lawrence\r\nwere ill in bed, but without injuring them; and on another a soldier was\r\nshot dead by a cannon-ball in the very centre room of the hospital.\r\nInglis tried, but tried in vain, to get any one to take a letter, even\r\nso small as to go into a quill, to Havelock; the enterprise was so\r\nperilous, that the offer of a great reward fell powerless. Thus reduced\r\nto his own resources, he began anxiously to count up his stores and\r\nsupplies: he protected the powder-magazine with heavy beams, laden with\r\na great thickness of earth; and he got the civilians to labour at the\r\nearthworks, and to watch the batteries, for nearly all his engineers\r\nwere ill. One engineer-officer, Captain Fulton, was happily spared from\r\nillness longer than most of the others; and he laboured unremittingly\r\nand most skilfully to baffle the enemy’s mining by countermining: he\r\norganised a body of sappers from among the humbler members of the\r\ngarrison, and begged every one who did sentry-duty at night to listen\r\nfor and give information concerning any underground sounds that denoted\r\nthe driving of galleries or mines by the enemy. One of the ladies, Mrs\r\nDorin, was among the number who this week fell from the shots of the\r\nenemy. An event of this kind was peculiarly distressing to all; an\r\nofficer learns to brave death, but he is inexpressibly saddened when he\r\nsees tender women falling near him by bullets.\r\n\r\nThe sixth week arrived. The brigadier, by redoubling his offers, did at\r\nlength succeed in obtaining the aid of a native, who started on the\r\ndangerous duty of conveying a small note to General Havelock at\r\nCawnpore. This done, he renewed his anxious superintendence of matters\r\nwithin the enclosure. The enemy mounted on the top of Johannes’ house,\r\nand thence kept up a very annoying fire on the Brigade Mess. They also\r\nrecommenced mining near the Redan. On the 8th of August the garrison\r\ncould hear and see much marching and countermarching of troops within\r\nthe city, without being able to divine its cause; they fondly hoped,\r\nwhen the booming of guns was heard, that Havelock was approaching. This\r\nhope was, however, speedily and bitterly dashed; for on the following\r\nday a great force of rebels was seen to approach from the direction of\r\nthe cantonment, cross the river, and join the main body of the\r\ninsurgents within Lucknow. This was a bad omen, for it prefigured an\r\nincrease in the number, frequency, and varieties of attack. On the 10th\r\nthe enemy succeeded in exploding one of their mines opposite Johannes’\r\nhouse; it blew up sixty feet of palisades and earthen defences. Under\r\ncover of this surprise, and of a tremendous firing of guns, the enemy\r\npushed forward into all the buildings near the Cawnpore Battery and\r\nJohannes’ house; but they encountered so steady and determined a\r\nresistance that they were beaten at all points. Near Sago’s house, too,\r\nthey fired another mine, which blew up two soldiers; but here, in like\r\nmanner, they were repulsed after a fierce contest. This explosion was\r\naccompanied or attended by an incident almost as strange as that\r\nconnected with the soldier at Muchee Bhowan; the two men were blown into\r\nthe air, but both escaped with their lives; one fell within the\r\nenclosure, slightly bruised, but not seriously injured; the other,\r\nfalling into an open road between the enclosure and the enemy, jumped up\r\nwhen he found himself unhurt, and clambered over a wall or through the\r\nbreach, untouched by the storm of bullets sent after him. On the same\r\nday there were other attacks on Innes’s, Anderson’s, and Gubbins’s\r\nhouses or garrisons. Of the attacks on the Brigade Mess, the Cawnpore\r\nBattery, and Anderson’s house, Brigadier Inglis afterwards thus spoke in\r\nhis dispatch: ‘The enemy sprang a mine close to the Brigade Mess, which\r\nentirely destroyed our defences for the space of twenty feet, and blew\r\nin a great portion of the outside wall of the house occupied by Mr\r\nSchilling’s garrison. On the dust clearing away, a breach appeared\r\nthrough which a regiment could have advanced in perfect order, and a few\r\nof the enemy came on with the utmost determination; but they were met\r\nwith such a withering flank-fire of musketry from the officers and men\r\nholding the top of the Brigade Mess, that they beat a speedy retreat,\r\nleaving the more adventurous of their numbers lying on the crest of the\r\nbreach. While this operation was going on, another large body advanced\r\non the Cawnpore Battery, and succeeded in locating themselves for a few\r\nminutes in the ditch. They were, however, dislodged by hand-grenades. At\r\nCaptain Anderson’s post, they also came boldly forward with\r\nscaling-ladders, which they planted against the wall; but here, as\r\nelsewhere, they were met with the most indomitable resolution; and the\r\nleaders being slain, the rest fled, leaving the ladders, and retreated\r\nto their batteries and loopholed defences, whence they kept up for the\r\nrest of the day an unusually heavy cannonade and musketry fire.’ All the\r\nattacks, it is true, were frustrated, but only by fearful labour on the\r\npart of the defenders; every man was worn down by exhaustion on this\r\nterrible day. A message or rather a rumour was received, obscure in its\r\npurport, but conveying the impression that Havelock had been baffled in\r\nhis attempt to reach Lucknow: news that produced very great despondency\r\nin the garrison, among those who had become sick at heart as well as in\r\nbody. When a cannon-ball rushed along and demolished the verandah of the\r\nResidency or chief-commissioner’s house, it could not do less than add\r\nto the trepidation of the numerous families domiciled within the walls\r\nof that building, already brought into a state of nervous agitation by\r\nthe incessant noises and dangers. Death and wounds were as rife as ever\r\nduring this week. A shot broke the leg of Ensign Studdy while\r\nbreakfasting in the Residency; Captain Waterman was wounded; Lieutenant\r\nBryce died of a wound received some days earlier; Major Anderson,\r\nchief-engineer, died of dysentery and over-fatigue, bringing grief to\r\nthe whole garrison for the loss of a most valuable and intrepid officer.\r\nThese were the chief names: those of humbler rank who fell to rise no\r\nmore were too many to be officially recorded; they were hastily buried\r\nin the church-yard, and soon driven from the memories of those who had\r\nno time to dwell on the past.\r\n\r\nUp to the day when the seventh week of the siege opened, there had been\r\ntwenty letters sent for succour, first by Sir Henry Lawrence, and then\r\nby Brigadier Inglis; and to only one of these had a direct reply been\r\nreceived. Only a few of them, indeed, had reached their destinations;\r\nand of these few, a reply from one alone safely passed through all the\r\nperils between Cawnpore and Lucknow. As has been already said, this\r\nreply was not such as to comfort the British residents; they had to\r\nrouse themselves to a continuance of the same kind of exertions as\r\nbefore. The enemy did not give them one day, scarcely one hour, of rest.\r\nOn the 12th of August so fierce an attack was made on the Cawnpore\r\nBattery, that all the defenders were forced to shield themselves from\r\nthe balls and bullets—still remaining at hand, however, in case a closer\r\nassault were attempted. It being found, too, that a mine was being run\r\nby the enemy in the direction of Sago’s house, some of the officers made\r\na daring sortie to examine this mine, much to their own peril. Then\r\ncommenced, as before, a system of countermining, each party of miners\r\nbeing able to hear the other working in an adjoining gallery; it became\r\na struggle which should blow the other up; the British succeeded, and\r\nshattered all the works of the enemy at that spot. Nothing in the whole\r\nprogress of the siege was more extraordinary than this perpetual mining\r\nand countermining. While the infantry and artillery on both sides were\r\nat their usual deadly work in the open air, the Sappers and Miners were\r\nconverting the ground beneath into a honey-comb of dark galleries and\r\npassages—the enemy attempting to blow up the defence-works, and the\r\ndefenders attempting to anticipate this by blowing up the enemy.\r\nWhenever the firing by the mutineers slackened in any material degree,\r\nthe defenders took advantage of the opportunity to make new sand-bags\r\nfor batteries and earthworks, in place of the old ones which had been\r\ndestroyed. The 15th of August was a white day within the enclosure; _no\r\nburial took place_. It was also rendered notable by the receipt of a\r\nletter from General Havelock—a letter telling of inability to afford\r\npresent succour, and therefore a mournful letter; but still it was\r\nbetter than none, seeing that it pointed out to all the necessity for\r\ncontinued exertions in the common cause. Now came the time when a great\r\nincrease of discomfort was in store for the numerous persons who had\r\nbeen accommodated in the Residency, the official house of the\r\nchief-commissioner. The building had been so shaken by shells and balls\r\nthat it was no longer secure; and the inmates were removed to other\r\nquarters. On the 18th a terrible commotion took place; the enemy\r\nexploded a mine under the Sikh Square or barrack, and made a breach of\r\nthirty feet in the defence-boundary of the enclosure. Instantly all\r\nhands were set to work; boxes, planks, doors, beams, were brought from\r\nvarious quarters to stop up the gap; while muskets and pistols were\r\nbrought to bear upon the assailants. Not only did the gallant fellows\r\nwithin the enclosure repel the enemy, but they made a sortie, and blew\r\nup some of the exterior buildings which were in inconvenient proximity.\r\nBy the explosion on this day, Captain Orr, Lieutenant Meecham, and other\r\nofficers and men, were hurled into the air, but with less serious\r\nresults than might have been expected; several, however, were suffocated\r\nby the débris which fell upon them.\r\n\r\nBy the eighth week the garrison had become in a strange way accustomed\r\nto bullets and balls; that is, though always in misery of some kind or\r\nother, the report of firearms had been rendered so thoroughly familiar\r\nto them, through every day and night’s experience, that it was a matter\r\nof course to hear missiles whiz past the ear. Mr Rees, speaking of his\r\ndaily movements from building to building in the enclosure, says: ‘At\r\none time a bullet passed through my hat; at another I escaped being shot\r\ndead by one of the enemy’s best riflemen, by an unfortunate soldier\r\npassing unexpectedly before me, and receiving the wound through the\r\ntemples instead; at another I moved off from a place where in less than\r\na twinkling of an eye afterwards a musket-bullet stuck in the wall; at\r\nanother, again, I was covered with dust and pieces of brick by a\r\nround-shot that struck the wall not two inches away from me; at another,\r\nagain, a shell burst a couple of yards away from me, killing an old\r\nwoman, and wounding a native boy and a native cook.’ Every day was\r\nmarked by some vicissitudes. On the 20th, the enemy opened a tremendous\r\ncannonading, which knocked down a guard-room over the Mess-house, and\r\nlessened the number of places from which the garrison could obtain a\r\nlook-out. The enemy were also on that day detected in the attempt to run\r\nnew mines under the Cawnpore Battery and the Bailey guard. This led to a\r\nbrilliant sortie, headed by Captain M’Cabe and Lieutenant Browne, which\r\nresulted not only in the spiking of two of the enemy’s guns, but also in\r\nthe blowing up of Johannes’ house, which had been such a perpetual\r\nsource of annoyance to the garrison. It was one of the best day’s work\r\nyet accomplished, and cheered the poor, hard-worked fellows for a time.\r\nYet they had enough to trouble them; the Cawnpore and Redan batteries\r\nwere almost knocked to pieces, and needed constant repair; the judicial\r\noffice became so riddled with shot that the women and children had to be\r\nremoved from it; the enemy’s sharpshooters were deadly accurate in their\r\naim; their miners began new mines as fast as the old ones were destroyed\r\nor rendered innoxious; and Inglis’s little band was rapidly thinning.\r\n\r\nAnother week arrived, the last in August, and the ninth of this perilous\r\nlife in the fortified enclosure. The days exhibited variations in the\r\ndegree of danger, but not one really bright gleam cheered the hearts of\r\nthe garrison. An advantage had been gained by the successful mining and\r\nblowing up of Johannes’ house, once the residence of a merchant of that\r\nname; it had been a post from which an African eunuch belonging to the\r\nlate king’s court had kept up a most fatal and accurate fire into the\r\nenclosure, bringing down more Europeans than any other person in the\r\nenemy’s ranks. An advantage was thus gained, it is certain; but there\r\nwere miseries in abundance in other quarters. Gubbins’s house had become\r\nso shot-riddled, that the ladies and children domiciled there were too\r\nmuch imperiled to remain longer; they were removed to other buildings,\r\nadding to the number of inmates in rooms already sadly overcrowded.\r\nAmong the natives in the enclosure, desertions frequently took place; a\r\nfact at which no one could reasonably be surprised, but which\r\nnevertheless greatly added to the labours of those on whom devolved the\r\ndefence of the place. Distressingly severe as those labours had all\r\nalong been, they were now doubly so; for the enemy erected a new battery\r\nopposite the Bailey guard, and commenced new mines in all directions. As\r\nthe defenders could seldom venture on a sortie to examine the enemy’s\r\nworks of attack, they were driven to the construction of\r\n‘listening-galleries’—underground passages where the sound of the\r\nenemy’s mining picks and shovels could be heard. And then would be\r\nrenewed the digging of countermines, and a struggle to determine which\r\nparty should be the first to blow up the other. The Mohurrum or\r\nMohammedan festival commenced this week; a period in which fanatical\r\nMussulmans are so fierce against all who dissent from their faith, that\r\nthe garrison apprehended a new onslaught with more force than ever; this\r\nfear passed away, however, for though there was much ‘tom-tom’\r\nprocessioning and buffalo-horn bugling in the city, the attacks on the\r\nenclosure did not differ much from their usual character. Another letter\r\nwas received from Havelock, which gave joy to men who found that they\r\nwere not wholly forgotten by friends in the outer world; but when they\r\nheard that a period of at least three weeks longer must elapse before he\r\ncould possibly reach them, their overcharged hearts sank again, and deep\r\ndespondency existed for a time among them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  English Church and Residency at Lucknow—from Officers’ Quarters.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring this month of August, the women and children, the sick and\r\nwounded, of course suffered much more terribly than in the previous\r\nmonth of July. Every kind of peril and discomfort had increased in\r\nseverity; every means of succour and solace had diminished in quantity.\r\nDeath struck down many; disease and wounds laid low a still greater\r\nnumber; and those who remained were a prey to carking cares, which wore\r\ndown both mind and body. Those who, in a Christian country, are\r\naccustomed to pay the last token of respect to departed friends by\r\ndecent funeral ceremonies, were often pained by their disability to do\r\nso in the Lucknow enclosure, under the straitened circumstances of their\r\nposition. The Rev. Mr Polehampton, after working day and night in his\r\nkindly offices among the sick and wounded, was at length himself struck\r\ndown by cholera; and then came the mournful question, whether he could\r\nhave a coffin and a separate grave. The writer of the _Diary_, wife of\r\nthe clergyman who succeeded Mr Polehampton in his duties as a pastor,\r\nsays that her husband read the funeral-service over the dead body in\r\npresence of the mourning widow, on the day and in the room where the\r\ndeath took place, before removal for instant interment. ‘She (the widow)\r\nwas extremely anxious he should have a coffin, a wish it seemed\r\nimpossible to gratify; but —— instituted a search, and found one stored\r\naway with some old boxes under the staircase in the hospital; and he\r\nalso had a separate grave dug for him. Since the siege, the bodies have\r\nhitherto always been buried several in the same grave, and sewn up in\r\ntheir bedding, as there are no people and no time to make coffins.’ In\r\ntheir troubled state of feeling, vexations affected the different\r\nmembers of the imprisoned community more acutely than would have been\r\nthe case at other times. The plague of flies can be adverted to in a\r\nhalf-laughing manner by a man in health; but in the Lucknow enclosure it\r\nwas a real plague, a source of exquisite misery, against which more\r\ncomplaints were uttered than almost anything else. There were also\r\ntroublesome and painful boils on the person, brought on by high\r\ntemperature and insufficient diet and medicines. Whatever might be the\r\namount of care taken, bullocks were frequently killed by the shot of the\r\nenemy; and as animals so dying were not fit for human food, it became\r\nnecessary to bury the carcasses at once. A frightful duty this was,\r\nmostly performed (as has already been stated) at night by officers,\r\nwhose few hours of possible sleep were cut short by this revolting sort\r\nof labour. No one could leave the enclosure, except native servants\r\ndetermined on escape; not an inch of ground belonged to the British\r\nbeyond the limits of the intrenched position; and therefore whatever had\r\nto be put out of sight—dead bodies of human beings, carcasses of\r\nbullocks and horses, garbage and refuse of every kind—could only so be\r\ntreated by being buried underground in the few open spots between the\r\nbuildings. And this, too, in the August of an Indian climate, when even\r\nthe best sanitary arrangements fail to remove offensive odours. The\r\nofficers, in all their letters and diaries, spoke of this portion of\r\ntheir labours as being most distressing; while the poor women, cabined\r\nby dozens together in single rooms, yearned, but yearned in vain, for\r\nthe breathing of a little air free from impurities. They dared not move\r\nout, for the balls and bullets of the enemy were whizzing across and\r\ninto every open spot. Sometimes an 18-pounder shot would burst into a\r\nroom where two or three of them were dressing, or where a larger number\r\nwere at meals. In some of the houses or ‘garrisons,’ where many ladies\r\nformed one community, they used to take it in turn to keep awake for\r\nhourly watches during the night; one of them said in a letter: ‘I don’t\r\nexactly know what is gained by these night-watchings—except that we are\r\nall very nervous, and are expecting some dreadful catastrophe to\r\nhappen.’ The little children died off rapidly, their maladies being more\r\nthan could be met by the resources at hand; and those who bore up\r\nagainst the afflictions were much emaciated. The husbands and fathers,\r\nworn out with daily fatigue and nightly watching, had little solace to\r\nafford their families; and thus the women and children were left to pass\r\nthe weary hours as best they could. A few little creatures,\r\n‘siege-babies,’ as their poor mothers called them, came into the world\r\nduring this stormy period; and with them each day was a struggle for\r\nlife. When the native servants one by one escaped, the discomforts of\r\nthe English women of course underwent much aggravation; and when the\r\nhouse or bungalow of Mr Gubbins became untenable through shot and\r\nbullet, the difficulty was immense of finding shelter elsewhere; every\r\nplace was already overcrowded. Much additional misery befell the\r\nofficers and men from this fact—that the commissariat quarter, offensive\r\nto every sense on account of the organic accumulations inseparable from\r\nthe slaughtering and cutting up of animals—was one of the weakest parts\r\nin the whole enclosure, and required to be guarded at all hours by armed\r\nmen, who loathed the spot for the reason just mentioned. The chaplain,\r\ntoo, found the church-yard getting into such a horrible state that he\r\ndared not go near the graves to read the funeral-service. Mr Rees\r\nmentions an instance to illustrate the anxieties of those who, willing\r\nto suffer themselves, were almost crushed by witnessing the privations\r\nof those dear to them. ‘He’ (mentioning one of the officers) ‘had at\r\nfirst told me of his wife being feverish and quite overcome with the\r\nabominable life she had to lead. And then he talked to me of his boy\r\nHerbert; how he was attacked with cholera, and feared he was very ill;\r\nand how, instead of being able to watch by his bedside, he had been all\r\nnight digging at Captain Fulton’s mine; and then how his child next\r\nnight was convulsed, and what little hope of his darling being spared to\r\nthem—how heart-rending the boy’s sufferings were to his parents’\r\nfeelings—how even his (the father’s) iron constitution was at last\r\ngiving way—how he had neither medicine, nor attendance, nor proper food\r\nfor the child—and how the blowing up of the mine so close to his sick\r\nchild had frightened him. And then to-day he told me, with tears in his\r\neyes, that yesterday—the anniversary of his birthday—his poor child was\r\ncalled away. “God’s will be done,” said he; “but it is terrible to think\r\nof. At night we dug a hole in the garden, and there, wrapped in a\r\nblanket, we laid him.”’ This case is not singular; many another poor\r\nparent’s heart was thus torn.\r\n\r\nThe provisioning of the garrison was of course a perpetual source of\r\nanxiety to Brigadier Inglis and the other officers; or rather, the\r\ndistribution of the food already possessed, and rapidly becoming\r\nexhausted, without any prospect of replenishing. Fresh meat was in store\r\nfor the garrison as long as any healthy bullocks remained; but in other\r\narticles of food the deficiency became serious as the month advanced. An\r\nimmense store of attah—the coarse meal from which chupatties or cakes\r\nwere made—had been provided by Sir Henry Lawrence; but this was now\r\nnearly exhausted, and the garrison had to grind corn daily, from the\r\nstore kept in the impromptu granaries. The women and the elder children\r\nwere much employed in this corn-grinding, by means of hand-mills. To\r\neconomise the meal thus laboriously ground, rice and unground wheat were\r\nserved out to the natives. The animal food was likely to be limited, by\r\nthe want not of bullocks, but of bhoosa or fodder to feed them; and the\r\ncommissariat-officers saw clearly before them the approach of a time\r\nwhen the poor animals must die for want of food. The tea and sugar were\r\nexhausted, except a little store kept for invalids. The tobacco was all\r\ngone; and the soldiers, yearning for a pipe after a hard day’s work,\r\nsmoked dried leaves as the only obtainable substitute. A few casks of\r\nporter still remained, to be guarded as a precious treasure. Once now\r\nand then, when an officer was struck down to death, an auction would be\r\nheld of the few trifling comforts which he had been able to bring with\r\nhim into the enclosure; and then the prices given by those who possessed\r\nmeans plainly told how eager was the desire for some little change in\r\nthe poor and insufficient daily food. A few effects left by Sir Henry\r\nLawrence were sold; among them, £16 was given for a dozen bottles of\r\nbrandy, £7 for a dozen of beer, the same amount for a dozen of sherry,\r\n£7 for a ham, £4 for a quart bottle of honey, £5 for two small tins of\r\npreserved soup, and £3 for a cake of chocolate. Sugar was the luxury for\r\nwhich most craving was exhibited.\r\n\r\nWe pass on now to another month, September, whose early days ushered in\r\nthe tenth week of the captivity.\r\n\r\nNew mines were everywhere discovered. The British, officers and men,\r\nattended sedulously to the underground listening-galleries adverted to\r\nin a former paragraph, and there obtained unmistakable evidence that the\r\nenemy were running mines towards Sago’s house, the Brigade Mess, the\r\nBailey guard, and other buildings, with the customary intent of blowing\r\nthem up, and making a forcible entry into the enclosure. Untiring\r\nexertions at countermining alone frustrated these terrible operations.\r\nOn one day, the upper part of the Brigade Mess was smashed in by a shot;\r\non another, a breach was made in the wall of the Martinière temporary\r\nschool, requiring very speedy stockading and barricading to prevent the\r\nentrance of the enemy; on another, a few engineers made a gallant sortie\r\nfrom Innes’s house, and succeeded in blowing up a building from which\r\nthe enemy had maintained an annoying fire of musketry; and on another\r\nday, an officer had the curiosity to count the cannon-balls, varying\r\nfrom 3 to 24 pounds each, which had fallen on the roof of one building\r\nalone, the Brigade Mess—they were no less than 280 in number! On the 5th\r\nof the month, the enemy made a more than usually impetuous attack; there\r\nwere 5000 of them in sight from the Residency; they had formed a battery\r\non the other side of the river; they exploded two mines near the Bailey\r\nguard and the mess-house; they advanced to Gubbins’s house and to the\r\nSikh Square, bringing with them long ladders to effect an escalade—in\r\nshort, they seemed determined to carry their point on this occasion. All\r\nwas in vain, however; the garrison, though worked almost to death,\r\ngallantly rushed to every endangered spot and repelled the enemy,\r\nhastily reconstructing such defence-works as had been destroyed or\r\ndamaged. Fortunately, the two exploded mines were short of their\r\nintended distance: they wrought but little damage. Much marching and\r\ncountermarching were occasionally visible among the troops in the city:\r\nvague rumours reached the Residency that Havelock had a second time\r\nvanquished Nena Sahib’s troops at Cawnpore or Bithoor; but to what\r\nextent these movements and rumours would influence the garrison was left\r\npainfully undecided. The nights were more terrible than the days; for\r\nthe enemy, as if to destroy all chance of sleep, kept up a torrent of\r\nmusketry, accompanied by much shouting and screaming. Many of the\r\nofficers worked with almost superhuman energy at this time. Captains\r\nFulton and Anderson, Lieutenants Aitken, Clery, Innes, Hutchinson,\r\nTulloch, Birch, Hay, and others, were constantly on the watch for mines,\r\nand sedulously digging countermines to foil them.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh week found the garrison more than ever exposed to hourly\r\nperil. The officers, driven from place to place for their few hours of\r\nrepast and repose, had latterly messed in one of the buildings of the\r\nBegum’s Kothee; this fact seemed to be well known to the rebels, who\r\nwere from the first better acquainted with what transpired inside the\r\nfort than the garrison were with external affairs; they directed their\r\nshells and balls so thickly on that spot, that ingress and egress were\r\nequally difficult. Two sides of Innes’s house were blown in, and the\r\nwhole structure made little else than a heap of ruins; the Residency,\r\ntoo, became so tottering, that renewed precautions had to be taken in\r\nthat quarter; new mines were perpetually discovered, directed to points\r\nunderneath the various buildings; and the enemy sought to increase their\r\nmeans of annoyance by booming forth shells filled with abominable and\r\nfilthy compositions. Perhaps the most harassing troubles were owing to\r\nthe uncertainty of the time and place when active services would be\r\nneeded. The officers could not reckon upon a single minute of peace. ‘In\r\nthe midst of all these miseries,’ says Captain Anderson, ‘you would hear\r\nthe cry of “Turn out;” and you had to seize your musket and rush to your\r\npost. Then there was a constant state of anxiety as to whether we were\r\nmined or not; and we were not quite sure, whilst we were at a loophole,\r\nthat we might not suddenly see the ground open, or observe the whole\r\nmaterials of the house fly into the air by the explosion of a mine.\r\nShells came smashing into our rooms, and dashed our property to pieces;\r\nthen followed round-shot, and down tumbled huge pieces of masonry, while\r\nhits of wood and brick flew in all directions. I have seen beds\r\nliterally blown to atoms, and trunks and boxes completely smashed into\r\nlittle bits.’ Nevertheless, there was no flinching in the garrison; if a\r\nmine were discovered, a countermine was run out to frustrate it; if a\r\nwall or a verandah were knocked down by shot, the débris was instantly\r\nused to form a rampart, barricade, or stockade. On the 14th of the\r\nmonth, a loss was incurred which caused grief throughout the garrison.\r\nCaptain Fulton, whose indomitable energy had won the admiration of all\r\nin his duties as engineer, and whose kindness of manner had rendered him\r\na general favourite, was struck by a cannon-ball which took his head\r\ncompletely off. Brigadier Inglis felt this loss sensitively, for Fulton\r\nhad been to him an invaluable aid in all his trials and difficulties.\r\nFulton, who was especially marked by his skill and promptness in\r\ncountermining, had succeeded Major Anderson as chief-engineer, and was\r\nhimself now succeeded by Captain Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth week, the last which the beleaguered English were destined\r\nto suffer before the one which was to bring Havelock and Neill to\r\nLucknow, found them in great despondency. They had lately lost a number\r\nof valuable officers. Lieutenant Birch fell; then M. Deprat, a merchant\r\nwho worked and fought most valiantly at the defences; then Captain\r\nCunliffe; and then Lieutenant Graham, whose mental firmness gave way\r\nunder privation, grief, and wounds, leading him to commit suicide. As a\r\nnatural consequence of these and similar losses, harder work than ever\r\npressed on those who remained alive. Never for a moment was the look-out\r\nneglected. At all hours of the day and night, officers were posted on\r\nthe roofs of the Residency and the post-office, finding such shelter as\r\nthey could while watching intently the river, the bridges, the roads,\r\nand the buildings in and around the city; every fact they observed,\r\nserious in its apparent import, was at once reported to Brigadier\r\nInglis, who made such defensive arrangements as the circumstances made\r\ndesirable, and as his gradually lessened means rendered possible. What\r\nwere the sleepless nights thus added to harassing days for the\r\nresponsible guardian of the forlorn band, may to some extent be\r\nconceived. The enemy’s batteries were now more numerous than ever. They\r\nwere constructed near the iron bridge; in a piece of open ground that\r\nformerly comprised the Residency kitchen-garden; near a mosque by the\r\nswampy ground on the river’s bank; in front of a range of buildings\r\ncalled the Captan Bazaar; in the Taree Kothee opposite the Bailey guard;\r\nnear the clock-tower opposite the financial office; in a garden and\r\nbuildings opposite the judicial office and Anderson’s house; in numerous\r\nbuildings that bore upon the Cawnpore Battery and the Brigade Mess; in\r\nfields and buildings that commanded Gubbins’s house; and in positions on\r\nthe northwest of the enclosure—in other words, the whole place was\r\nsurrounded by batteries bristling with mortars and great guns, some or\r\nother of which were almost incessantly firing shot and shell into it.\r\n\r\nAnd what, the reader may anxiously ask, was the domestic or personal\r\nlife of the inmates of the enclosure during these three weeks of\r\nSeptember? It was sad indeed—beyond the former sadness. If the men\r\ntoiled and watched in sultry dry weather, they were nearly overcome by\r\nheat and noisome odours; if they slept in the trenches in damp nights\r\nafter great heat, they suffered terribly in their limbs and bones, for\r\nthey had neither tents nor change of clothing. Such was the state to\r\nwhich the whole of the ground was brought, by refuse of every kind, that\r\na pool resulting from a shower of rain soon became an insupportable\r\nnuisance; sanitary cleansings were unattainable by a community who had\r\nneither surplus labour nor efficient drains at command. Half the\r\nofficers were ill at one time, from disease, over-fatigue, and\r\ninsufficient diet; and when they were thus laid prostrate, they had\r\nneither medicines nor surgeons sufficient for their need. There was not\r\na sound roof in the whole place. On one day a cannon-ball entered at one\r\nend of the largest room in the hospital, traversed the whole length, and\r\nwent out at the other—but, singular to relate, it did not hurt one human\r\nbeing in the whole crowded apartment. In the commissariat department,\r\nsome of the bullocks yet remaining fell sick through privations, others\r\nwere shot; thereby lessening the reserve store, and adding to the\r\nrepulsive night-duties of the officers already adverted to. Of the few\r\nnative servants still remaining, hardly one now could be retained; and\r\nthe saving of their simple food was an inadequate counterbalance for the\r\nloss of their assistance in drudgery labours. There were not, however,\r\nwanting proofs of a fact abundantly illustrated in many walks of\r\nlife—the moral healthiness of useful employment. One of the ladies,\r\nwhose early weeks in the Residency had been weeks of misery, afterwards\r\nwrote thus: ‘I now find every hour of the day fully occupied. It is a\r\ngreat comfort to have so much to do, and to feel one’s self of some\r\nlittle use; it helps one to keep up one’s spirits much better than would\r\notherwise be possible under the circumstances.’ The live-stock, the rum,\r\nthe porter, were all getting low; tea, sugar, coffee, and chocolate had\r\nlong disappeared from the rations. Such officers and civilians as had\r\nmoney in their pockets, were willing to give almost any prices for the\r\nfew luxuries still remaining in private hands, in order that they might\r\nin some degree alleviate the sufferings of their wives and children.\r\nForty shillings were eagerly given for a bottle of brandy; thirty-two\r\nfor a bottle of curaçoa; forty for a small fowl; sixteen shillings per\r\npound were offered, but offered in vain, for sugar; two shillings a\r\npound for coarse flour; ten shillings a pound for a little half-rancid\r\nbutter or ghee; tobacco, four shillings _a leaf_; a bottle of pickles,\r\nforty shillings. Mr Rees sold a gold watch to a companion who had money\r\nto spare, and with it purchased the luxury of smoking cigars at two\r\nshillings each; but when those bits of rolled tobacco-leaf commanded\r\nthree rupees or six shillings each, he bade adieu to his last remaining\r\nsource of personal enjoyment. What any one _gave_, he gave out of kind\r\nsympathy to his suffering companions; but what he _sold_, he sold in the\r\nusual commercial spirit to the highest bidder. The attire was reduced to\r\nthe most piteous condition. Many of the officers had found much of their\r\nclothing burned nearly four months earlier, during the mutiny at the\r\ncantonment; and the troubles of June had prevented them from making\r\npurchases in the city before the arrival of the day when they were all\r\nalike to be shut up in the enclosure. As a consequence, their remaining\r\nclothes wore away to rags, or something worse. There was scarcely a\r\nvestige of a military uniform visible throughout the place. Officers\r\nworked and fought, dined and slept, in shirt, trousers, and slippers;\r\none made himself a coat out of a billiard table-cloth; and another\r\ncontrived a sort of shirt out of a piece of floor-cloth. When the\r\ntrifling effects of one of the deceased officers came to be examined and\r\nsold, a little underclothing was sought for with an eagerness which\r\nsumptuous garments would not have excited; four pounds sterling were\r\ngiven for a new flannel-shirt, and twelve pounds for five others which\r\nhad already rendered much service.\r\n\r\nJoy, joy beyond expression rang through the enclosure when, on the 21st\r\nof September, the rumour ran round that a messenger had arrived with\r\ngood news. Inglis had, a few days before, sent off a spy on the\r\noften-tried but generally unsuccessful attempt to carry a small note\r\n(enclosed in a quill); the peril had been great, but the man safely\r\nreturned with a small written reply from Havelock, announcing that\r\nOutram and himself were on the road from Cawnpore, and expected to reach\r\nLucknow in three or four days. Hearts were filled to overflowing with\r\nthis announcement. Many wept for joy, some laughed and shouted, more\r\nsank on their knees in thanksgiving, while the sick and wounded rose\r\nfrom their pallets, as if wondrously strengthened by the glad tidings.\r\nAll worked hard and vigorously, in their respective ways, to prepare for\r\nthe struggle inevitable on any attempt of the two generals to penetrate\r\nthrough the streets of the city; the inmates of the garrison could not,\r\nit is true, leave their stronghold to join in the fight, but they might\r\npossibly aid when the forlorn-hope was approaching the Bailey guard, the\r\nprobable place of entrance. The 22d passed over in hopes and fears,\r\nexpectations and preparations. On the 23d, musketry was heard on the\r\nCawnpore road, and much agitation was visible within the city. On the\r\nnext day, cannonading and musketry were again heard; and then were the\r\ngarrison rejoiced at seeing multitudes escaping out of the city, and\r\nover the bridge to the other side of the river—rejoiced, because this\r\nmovement denoted success on the part of the advancing British.\r\n\r\nThe 25th arrived—the day of deliverance! Prodigious agitation and alarm\r\nhad marked the city all night: movements of men and horses, and all the\r\nindications of a city in commotion. At noon, the increasing sounds told\r\nthat street-fighting was going on; those who went on the top of the\r\nResidency for a look-out could see the smoke of musketry, but nothing\r\nelse. As the afternoon advanced, the sounds came nearer and nearer;[101]\r\nthen was heard the sharp crack of rifles; then was gradually perceived\r\nthe flash of musketry; and then the well-known uniforms of a friendly\r\nhand. Outram and Havelock, when they had fought their way over the canal\r\nby the Char Bagh Bridge (bridge of the ‘four gardens’), intended to have\r\ntaken the straight road to the Residency; but this road had been blocked\r\nup by the enemy with guns, palisades, stockades, barricades, concealed\r\npits and trenches, and other obstacles. The two generals therefore\r\ndiverged to the right, marched along a by-road to the eastern part of\r\nthe city, and there fought their way through a continuous line of\r\nstreets to the Bailey guard entrance of the Residency enclosure,\r\nsuffering terribly as they went.[102] Great was the shout with which\r\nthey were welcomed, and warm the grasp with which Inglis thanked his\r\ndeliverers. ‘The immense enthusiasm,’ says Mr Rees, ‘with which they\r\nwere greeted defies description. As their hurrah and ours rang in my\r\nears, I was nigh bursting with joy.... We felt not only happy, happy\r\nbeyond imagination, and grateful to that God of mercy who, by our noble\r\ndeliverers, Havelock and Outram, and their gallant troops, had thus\r\nsnatched us from imminent death; but we also felt proud of the defence\r\nwe had made, and the success with which, with such fearful odds to\r\ncontend against, we had preserved, not only our own lives, but the\r\nhonour and lives of the women and children intrusted to our keeping. As\r\nour deliverers poured in, they continued to greet us with loud\r\nhurrahs.... We ran up to them, officers and men without distinction, and\r\nshook them by the hands—how cordially, who can describe? The shrill\r\nnotes of the Highlanders’ bagpipes now pierced our ears. Not the most\r\nbeautiful music ever was more welcome, more joy-bringing. And these\r\nbrave men themselves, many of them bloody and exhausted, forgot the loss\r\nof their comrades, the pain of their wounds, the fatigue of overcoming\r\nthe fearful obstacles they had combated for our sakes, in the pleasure\r\nof having accomplished our relief.’ What the women felt on this day, the\r\n_Lady’s Diary_ will tell us. ‘Never shall I forget the moment to the\r\nlatest day I live. It was most overpowering. We had no idea they were so\r\nnear, and were breathing air in the portico as usual at that hour,\r\nspeculating when they might be in—not expecting they could reach us for\r\nseveral days longer; when suddenly, just at dark, we heard a very sharp\r\nfire of musketry close by, and then a tremendous cheering. An instant\r\nafter, the sound of bagpipes, then soldiers running up the road, our\r\ncompound and verandah filled with our deliverers, and all of us shaking\r\nhands franticly, and exchanging fervent “God bless you’s!” with the\r\ngallant men and officers of the 78th Highlanders. Sir James Outram and\r\nstaff were the next to come in, and the state of joyful confusion and\r\nexcitement was beyond all description. The big, rough-bearded soldiers\r\nwere seizing the little children out of our arms, kissing them with\r\ntears rolling down their cheeks, and thanking God they had come in time\r\nto save them from the fate of those at Cawnpore. We were all rushing\r\nabout to give the poor fellows drinks of water, for they were perfectly\r\nexhausted; and tea was made down in the Tye Khana, of which a large\r\nparty of tired, thirsty officers partook, without milk or sugar; we had\r\nnothing to give them to eat. Every one’s tongue seemed going at once\r\nwith so much to ask and to tell; and the faces of utter strangers beamed\r\nupon each other like those of dearest friends and brothers.’\r\n\r\nAfter a night, in which joy kept many awake whom fatigue would have else\r\nsent into a deep sleep, the dawn of the 26th ushered in a day in which\r\nthere was again to be much severe fighting; for some of Havelock’s\r\nheroic little band had been left in palatial buildings outside the\r\nResidency enclosure, which they managed to hold during the night. To\r\nsuccour these comrades, to bring in the guns which they had guarded, and\r\nto obtain firm possession of the buildings, were objects that required\r\ngreat exertion and daring courage. The attempt succeeded. The palaces of\r\nFureed Buksh and Taree Kothee were conquered from the enemy, and formed\r\ninto new intrenched positions, which greatly relieved the overcrowded\r\nResidency. When the further conquest of the Chuttur Munzil palace and\r\nother buildings near the river-side had been effected, the position held\r\nby the British was thrice as large in area as that which Brigadier\r\nInglis had so long and so gallantly defended. It lay along the\r\nriver-bank for a considerable distance; while on the other side it was\r\nbounded by a dense mass of the streets constituting the main portion of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nOne of the results of Havelock and Outram’s advance was the capture of\r\nan important outpost. At a spot three or four miles out of Lucknow, near\r\nthe new road from Cawnpore, was the Alum Bagh, the ‘garden of the Lady\r\nAlum or beauty of the world.’ It comprised several buildings, including\r\na palace, a mosque, and an emambarra or private temple, bounded by a\r\nbeautiful garden, which was itself in the middle of a park, and the park\r\nenclosed in a wall with corner towers. There was abundant space within\r\nit for a large military force, and it was susceptible of being made a\r\nstronghold if the defences were well maintained. Havelock, on his\r\nadvance from Cawnpore, found the enemy drawn up in considerable\r\nstrength, within and without the wall of the Alum Bagh; and it was only\r\nafter a hot and fierce contest that he could capture the place. He\r\nencamped there on the night of the 23d, and had to bear many attacks\r\nfrom the enemy near the same spot on the 24th. On the 25th he advanced\r\nto Lucknow, and maintained the sanguinary street-fight already noticed.\r\nThe Alum Bagh was too important a place to be abandoned when once\r\nconquered. Havelock left there the baggage, ammunition, sick, and\r\nwounded, of his relieving force; with 300 men to protect them, and an\r\nimmense array of elephants, camels, horses, camp-followers, and laden\r\ncarts; and with four guns to aid in the defence. No one for an instant\r\nsupposed that that detachment would be left there without further aid.\r\nHavelock and his men fully expected, that, Lucknow once conquered, the\r\nAlum Bagh would simply be one of the strongholds of his position with\r\nwhich he could communicate when he pleased. Little did he look forward\r\nto the state of things actually produced, when the occupants of the Alum\r\nBagh were so completely isolated from the British in the city, that they\r\ncould not send even a message, unless by good-fortune a _kossid_ or\r\nnative messenger succeeded in conveying, in a quill or in the sole of\r\nhis shoe, a brief letter from the one place to the other.\r\n\r\nThis isolated position of the little garrison at Alum Bagh was,\r\nmoreover, only one among many grave subjects that speedily presented\r\nthemselves for consideration. After the first outburst of thankfulness\r\nat the arrival of the welcome deliverers, the residents in the Lucknow\r\nintrenchment had to ask themselves to what extent it was really a\r\ndeliverance. Then did they find that, in effect, they were as close\r\nprisoners as ever. Havelock had lost nearly one-third of his small force\r\nduring the desperate encounters of the past few days; and those who\r\nsurvived were far too weak for any considerable military operations. The\r\none great, absorbing, sacred, deeply earnest object he had all along\r\nheld in view, was to save his fellow-countrymen, their wives and\r\nchildren, from horrors such as had been perpetrated at Cawnpore. To his\r\ndying day he remained deeply grateful that he had been permitted to\r\neffect this; but what more could he do? Could he remain a conqueror in\r\nLucknow, or could he bring away from that city all those who for four\r\nmonths had been exposed to such peril! He could do neither the one nor\r\nthe other. The result of the fighting on the 25th and 26th of September\r\nhad given to him the command of a larger portion of the city than the\r\nResidency enclosure, which had been so long and so gallantly maintained\r\nby Inglis; but he could neither gain another inch without struggling for\r\nit, nor retain the portion already acquired without incessant\r\nwatchfulness and assiduity. Nor could he make the Residency and the Alum\r\nBagh component parts of one great stronghold, seeing that the British\r\nwere alike besieged in the one and the other, and could not hold\r\nintercommunication. Nor could he send the women and children to\r\nAllahabad or any other place of safety; they would all have been cut to\r\npieces on the road, so small was the escort he could afford, and so\r\noverwhelming the force of the enemy. The whole of the immediate benefit\r\nconsisted in an increase in the number of British for the defence-works;\r\nbut as these hard-working and hard-fighting troops brought little or no\r\nsupplies further than the Alum Bagh, there was an increase rather in the\r\nnumber of mouths to be fed than in the means of feeding them. The\r\ndisappointment of Inglis’s garrison, after the first joy had passed, was\r\nvery severe. Captivity and short commons were still to be their lot.\r\nMany councils of war were held, to determine what should be done. A\r\nparty of volunteer cavalry on one day set out with the intention of\r\ncutting their way to the Alum Bagh, and perhaps to Cawnpore, to seek for\r\nreinforcements and to give notice of the exact state of affairs; but\r\nthey were driven back almost immediately, by a body of rebels too large\r\nto be resisted. Sir James Outram sought to ascertain whether any of the\r\ninfluential natives in the city were disposed, by tempting offers, to\r\nrender him and his companions aid in their difficulties; but here in\r\nlike manner failure resulted. The scene was very miserable until\r\nsomething like order could be restored. The poor fellows who had fallen\r\non the 25th and 26th had been brought into the intrenchment, some to be\r\nburied, some to be healed if possible. The authoress of the _Lady’s\r\nDiary_ said: ‘The hospital is so densely crowded, that many have to lie\r\noutside in the open air, without bed or shelter. —— says he never saw\r\nsuch a heart-sickening scene. It is far worse than that after\r\nChinhut—amputated arms and legs lying about in heaps all over the\r\nhospital, and the crowd and confusion such that little can be done to\r\nalleviate the intense discomfort and pain of the poor sufferers.’\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to surviving friends, but would be tedious to\r\ngeneral readers, to present here a list of all the persons mentioned by\r\nname in Brigadier Inglis’s dispatch as having distinguished themselves\r\nin this most gallant struggle. They amount to about ninety in number.\r\nIndeed, it may well be supposed that at such a time every soldier worthy\r\nof the name, every civilian with a drop of honest blood in him, would\r\nachieve things of which, at another time, he would scarcely deem himself\r\ncapable. Not only British; for Captain Anderson mentions two gentlemen\r\nof foreign birth, a Frenchman and an Italian, who, shut up like the rest\r\nin the intrenchment, fought and worked as untiringly as their\r\ncompanions. In a foot-note we give the names of officers mentioned by\r\nBrigadier Inglis as having died during the siege;[103] and in another,\r\nof those who commanded eleven of the outposts or ‘garrisons,’ those\r\nfortified houses which were defended in so extraordinary a way.[104] Of\r\nall these he had a kindly word to say; as well as of the artillery and\r\nengineer officers, the infantry officers, the officers of the staff, the\r\nsurgeons and the chaplains, the commissariat-officers, the\r\ngentlemen-volunteers, the humble rank and file, and the ladies who\r\nbecame the ‘Florence Nightingales’ of the garrison. Nothing, perhaps, in\r\nthe whole course of the siege, was more remarkable than the conduct of\r\nthe native troops. It will be remembered that when three native infantry\r\nregiments mutinied at the cantonment on the 30th of May, some of the\r\nsepoys in each remained faithful. This select band shared all the\r\nlabours and sufferings of the British during the siege. With scanty\r\nfood, little and broken sleep, harassing exertions, daily fightings,\r\nthey remained steadfast to the last. Though sorely tempted by the\r\nmutineers, who would often converse with them over the palisades of the\r\nintrenchment, they never flinched from their duty. What they were on the\r\n30th of May, they were on the 25th of September, soldiers ‘true to their\r\nsalt.’ Few things are more embarrassing, in taking an estimate of the\r\ncauses and progress of the Revolt, than to meet with such anomalies as\r\nthis. Explain it how we may, it would be gross injustice to withhold\r\nfrom such men a tribute of admiration for their fidelity at so trying a\r\ntime. May there not have been something of a moral grandeur, a sublimity\r\nof heroism, in the conduct of the devoted garrison, that touched the\r\nhearts of these sepoys, and appealed to their better nature?\r\n\r\nViscount Canning did not fail to give an official recognition of the\r\nmerits of those who had made this glorious defence. In an ‘Order in\r\nCouncil,’ issued at Calcutta, after adverting to the receipt of a\r\nmilitary account of the proceedings from Brigadier Inglis, his lordship\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n‘The governor-general in council believes that never has a tale been\r\ntold which will so stir the hearts of Englishmen and Englishwomen....\r\nThere does not stand recorded in the annals of war an achievement more\r\ntruly heroic than the defence of the Residency at Lucknow. That defence\r\nhas not only called forth all the energy and daring which belong to\r\nEnglishmen in the hour of active conflict, but it has exhibited\r\ncontinuously, and in the highest degree, that noble and sustained\r\ncourage which against enormous odds and fearful disadvantages, against\r\nhope deferred, and through increasing toil and wear of body and mind,\r\nstill holds on day after day, and triumphs. The heavy guns of the\r\nassailants, posted almost in security within fifty yards of the\r\nintrenchments—so near, indeed, that the solicitations, threats, and\r\ntaunts which the rebels addressed to the native defenders of the\r\ngarrison were easily heard by those true-hearted men; the fire of the\r\nenemy’s musketry, so searching that it penetrated the innermost retreat\r\nof the women and children and of the wounded; their desperate attempts,\r\nrepeatedly made, to force an entry after blowing in the defences; the\r\nperpetual mining of the works; the weary night-watching for the expected\r\nsignal of relief; and the steady waste of precious lives until the\r\nnumber of English gunners was reduced below that of the guns to be\r\nworked—all these constitute features in a history which the\r\nfellow-countrymen of the heroes of Lucknow will read with swelling\r\nhearts, and which will endure for ever as a lesson to those who shall\r\nhope, by treachery, numbers, or boldness in their treason, to overcome\r\nthe indomitable spirit of Englishmen.’\r\n\r\nThe officer who so nobly held the command after Lawrence and Banks\r\nhad been stricken down by death, well earned the honours which the\r\nQueen afterwards conferred upon him. He entered Lucknow as a\r\nlieutenant-colonel; he left it as Major-general Sir John Eardley\r\nWilmot Inglis, K.C.B. Promotion in various ways awaited many of\r\nthe other officers; but the immediate recognition by the\r\ngovernor-general of the services rendered by the garrison was\r\nembodied in the following general order: ‘Every officer and\r\nsoldier, European and native, who has formed part of the garrison\r\nof the Residency between the 29th of June and the 25th of\r\nSeptember last shall receive six months’ batta. Every civilian in\r\nthe covenanted service of the East India Company who has taken\r\npart in the defence of the Residency within the above-named dates\r\nshall receive six months’ batta, at a rate calculated according to\r\nthe military rank with which his standing corresponds. Every\r\nuncovenanted civil officer or volunteer who has taken a like part\r\nshall receive six months’ batta, at a rate to be fixed according\r\nto the functions and position which may have been assigned to him.\r\nEvery native commissioned and non-commissioned officer and soldier\r\nwho has formed part of the garrison shall receive the Order of\r\nMerit, with the increase of pay attached thereto, and shall be\r\npermitted to count three years of additional service. The soldiers\r\nof the 13th, 48th, and 71st regiments native infantry, who have\r\nbeen part of the garrison, shall be formed into a regiment of the\r\nline, to be called “the Regiment of Lucknow,” the further\r\nconstitution of which, as regards officers and men, will be\r\nnotified hereafter.’\r\n\r\nWhat was done at Lucknow during October and November must be recorded in\r\na future chapter. While Outram, Havelock, and Inglis were maintaining\r\nthemselves, by indomitable resolution, in the Residency and the Alum\r\nBagh, Sir Colin Campbell was collecting a force adequate, if not to the\r\nactual reconquest of Lucknow, at least to the rescue of all the British\r\nof every class residing in that hateful city. Those two concurrent lines\r\nof proceeding will be treated in intimate connection, a few pages on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Brigadier Inglis’s Dispatch._—In order that the narrative contained\r\n  in the foregoing chapter might not be interrupted by too many\r\n  extracts from official documents, little has been said of the report\r\n  which Brigadier Inglis drew up of the siege soon after the arrival\r\n  of Outram and Havelock. So vividly, however, and in all respects so\r\n  worthily, did that report or dispatch portray the trying\r\n  difficulties of the position, and the heroic conduct of the\r\n  garrison, that it may be well to give a portion of it in this place.\r\n\r\n  ‘The right honourable the governor-general in council will feel that\r\n  it would be impossible to crowd within the limits of a dispatch even\r\n  the principal events, much less the individual acts of gallantry,\r\n  which have marked this protracted struggle. But I can\r\n  conscientiously declare my conviction, that few troops have ever\r\n  undergone greater hardships, exposed as they have been to a\r\n  never-ceasing musketry-fire and cannonade. They have also\r\n  experienced the alternate vicissitudes of extreme wet and of intense\r\n  heat, and that, too, with very insufficient shelter from either, and\r\n  in many places without any shelter at all. In addition to having had\r\n  to repel real attacks, they have been exposed night and day to the\r\n  hardly less harassing false alarms which the enemy have been\r\n  constantly raising. The insurgents have frequently fired very\r\n  heavily, sounded the advance, and shouted for several hours\r\n  together, though not a man could be seen: with the view, of course,\r\n  of harassing our small and exhausted force. In this object they\r\n  succeeded, for no part has been strong enough to allow of a portion\r\n  only of the garrison being prepared in the event of a false attack\r\n  being turned into a real one; all, therefore, had to stand to their\r\n  arms and to remain at their posts until the demonstration had\r\n  ceased; and such attacks were of almost nightly occurrence. The\r\n  whole of the officers and men have been on duty night and day during\r\n  the 87 days which the siege had lasted up to the arrival of Sir J.\r\n  Outram, G.C.B. In addition to this incessant military duty, the\r\n  force has been nightly employed in repairing defences, in moving\r\n  guns, in burying dead animals, in conveying ammunition and\r\n  commissariat stores from one place to another, and in other\r\n  fatigue-duties too numerous and too trivial to enumerate here. I\r\n  feel, however, that any words of mine will fail to convey any\r\n  adequate idea of what the fatigue and labours have been—labours in\r\n  which all ranks and all classes, civilians, officers, and soldiers,\r\n  have all borne an equally noble part. All have together descended\r\n  into the mine, and have together handled the shovel for the\r\n  interment of the putrid bullocks; and all, accoutred with musket and\r\n  bayonet, have relieved each other on sentry without regard to the\r\n  distinctions of rank, civil or military. Notwithstanding all these\r\n  hardships, the garrison has made no less than five sorties, in which\r\n  they spiked two of the enemy’s heaviest guns, and blew up several of\r\n  the houses from which they had kept up their most harassing fire.\r\n  Owing to the extreme paucity of our numbers, each man was taught to\r\n  feel that on his own individual efforts alone depended in no small\r\n  measure the safety of the entire position. This consciousness\r\n  incited every officer, soldier, and man, to defend the post assigned\r\n  to him with such desperate tenacity, and to fight for the lives\r\n  which Providence had intrusted to his care with such dauntless\r\n  determination, that the enemy, despite their constant attacks, their\r\n  heavy mines, their overwhelming numbers, and their incessant fire,\r\n  could never succeed in gaining one single inch of ground within the\r\n  bounds of this straggling position, which was so feebly fortified,\r\n  that had they once obtained a footing in any of the outposts the\r\n  whole place must inevitably have fallen.\r\n\r\n  ‘If further proof be wanting of the desperate nature of the struggle\r\n  which we have, under God’s blessing, so long and so successfully\r\n  waged, I would point to the roofless and ruined houses, to the\r\n  crumbled walls, to the exploded mines, to the open breaches, to the\r\n  shattered and disabled guns and defences, and lastly, to the long\r\n  and melancholy list of the brave and devoted officers and men who\r\n  have fallen. These silent witnesses bear sad and solemn testimony to\r\n  the way in which this feeble position has been defended.\r\n\r\n  ‘During the early part of these vicissitudes, we were left without\r\n  any information whatever regarding the posture of affairs outside.\r\n  An occasional spy did indeed come in with the object of inducing our\r\n  sepoys and servants to desert; but the intelligence derived from\r\n  such sources was, of course, entirely untrustworthy. We sent our\r\n  messengers, daily calling for aid, and asking for information, none\r\n  of whom ever returned until the 26th day of the siege; when a\r\n  pensioner named Ungud came back with a letter from General\r\n  Havelock’s camp, informing us that they were advancing with a force\r\n  sufficient to bear down all opposition, and would be with us in five\r\n  or six days. A messenger was immediately despatched, requesting that\r\n  on the evening of their arrival on the outskirts of the city two\r\n  rockets might be sent up, in order that we might take the necessary\r\n  measures for assisting them while forcing their way in. The sixth\r\n  day, however, expired, and they came not; but for many evenings\r\n  after, officers and men watched for the ascension of the expected\r\n  rockets, with hopes such as make the heart sick. We knew not then,\r\n  nor did we learn until the 29th of August—or 35 days later—that the\r\n  relieving force, after having fought most nobly to effect our\r\n  deliverance, had been obliged to fall back for reinforcements; and\r\n  this was the last communication we received until two days before\r\n  the arrival of Sir James Outram, on the 25th of September.\r\n\r\n  ‘Besides heavy visitations of cholera and small-pox, we have also\r\n  had to contend against a sickness which has almost universally\r\n  pervaded the garrison. Commencing with a very painful eruption, it\r\n  has merged into a low fever, combined with diarrhœa; and although\r\n  few or no men have actually died from its effects, it leaves behind\r\n  a weakness and lassitude which, in the absence of all material\r\n  sustenance, save coarse beef, and still coarser flour, none have\r\n  been able entirely to get over. The mortality among the women and\r\n  children, and especially among the latter, from these diseases and\r\n  from other causes, has been perhaps the most painful characteristic\r\n  of the siege. The want of native servants has also been a source of\r\n  much privation. Owing to the suddenness with which we were besieged,\r\n  many of these people, who might perhaps have otherwise proved\r\n  faithful to their employers, but who were outside the defences at\r\n  the time, were altogether excluded. Very many more deserted, and\r\n  several families were consequently left without the services of a\r\n  single domestic. Several ladies have had to tend their children, and\r\n  even to wash their own clothes, as well as to cook their scanty\r\n  meals, entirely unaided. Combined with the absence of servants, the\r\n  want of proper accommodation has probably been the cause of much of\r\n  the disease with which we have been afflicted.\r\n\r\n  ‘I cannot refrain from bringing to the prominent notice of his\r\n  lordship in council the patient endurance and the Christian\r\n  resignation which have been evinced by the women of this garrison.\r\n  They have animated us by their example. Many, alas! have been made\r\n  widows and their children fatherless in this cruel struggle. But all\r\n  such seem resigned to the will of Providence; and many—among whom\r\n  may be mentioned the honoured names of Birch, of Polehampton, of\r\n  Barbor, and of Gall—have, after the example of Miss Nightingale,\r\n  constituted themselves the tender and solicitous nurses of the\r\n  wounded and dying soldiers in the hospital.’\r\n\r\n  [After enumerating the officers and civilians who had wrought\r\n  untiringly in the good cause, Brigadier Inglis did ample justice to\r\n  the humbler combatants.]\r\n\r\n  ‘Lastly, I have the pleasure of bringing the splendid behaviour of\r\n  the soldiers—namely, the men of her Majesty’s 32d foot, the small\r\n  detachment of her Majesty’s 84th foot, the European and native\r\n  artillery, the 13th, 48th, and 71st regiments of native infantry,\r\n  and the Sikhs of the respective corps—to the notice of the\r\n  government of India. The losses sustained by her Majesty’s 32d,\r\n  which is now barely 300 strong, by her Majesty’s 84th, and by the\r\n  European artillery, shew at least that they knew how to die in the\r\n  cause of their countrymen. Their conduct under the fire, the\r\n  exposure, and the privations which they have had to undergo, has\r\n  been throughout most admirable and praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n  ‘As another instance of the desperate character of our defence, and\r\n  the difficulties we have had to contend with, I may mention that the\r\n  number of our artillerymen was so reduced, that on the occasion of\r\n  an attack, the gunners, aided as they were by men of her Majesty’s\r\n  32d foot, and by volunteers of all classes, had to run from one\r\n  battery to another wherever the fire of the enemy was hottest, there\r\n  not being nearly enough men to serve half the number of guns at the\r\n  same time. In short, at last the number of European gunners was only\r\n  24, while we had, including mortars, no less than 30 guns in\r\n  position.\r\n\r\n  ‘With respect to the native troops, I am of opinion that their\r\n  loyalty has never been surpassed. They were indifferently fed and\r\n  worse housed. They were exposed, especially the 13th regiment, under\r\n  the gallant Lieutenant Aitken, to a most galling fire of round-shot\r\n  and musketry, which materially decreased their numbers. They were so\r\n  near the enemy that conversation could be carried on between them;\r\n  and every effort, persuasion, promise, and threat, was alternately\r\n  resorted to in vain to seduce them from their allegiance to the\r\n  handful of Europeans, who, in all probability, would have been\r\n  sacrificed by their desertion.’\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  Chap. vi., pp. 82-96.

His name will, however, be more favourably\r\n  held in remembrance as the founder of a college, named by him the\r\n  Martinière, for Eurasian or half-caste children. This college was\r\n  situated near the eastern extremity of the city; but when the troubles\r\n  began, the principals and the children removed to a building hastily\r\n  set apart for them within the Residency enclosure. The authoress of\r\n  the _Lady’s Diary_, whose husband was connected as a pastor with the\r\n  Martinière, thus speaks of this transfer: ‘The Martinière is\r\n  abandoned, and I suppose we shall lose all our remaining property,\r\n  which we have been obliged to leave to its fate, as nothing more can\r\n  be brought in here. We got our small remnant of clothes; but\r\n  furniture, harp, books, carriage-horses, &c., are left at the\r\n  Martinière. The poor boys are all stowed away in a hot close native\r\n  building, and it will be a wonder if they don’t get ill.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  The wood-cut at p. 93 represents a part of the Residency in this\r\n  limited sense of the term; the view at p. 82 will convey some notion\r\n  of the appearance of the city of Lucknow as seen from the terrace-roof\r\n  of this building. The plan on next page will give an idea of the\r\n  Residency before siege; and in the next Part will be given a plan of\r\n  the Residency under siege, shewing the relation which the enemies’\r\n  guns bore to those of the besieged.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Mr Rees relates a strange anecdote in connection with this retreat\r\n  from the Muchee Bhowan to the Residency: ‘We saved all but one man,\r\n  who, having been intoxicated, and concealed in some corner, could not\r\n  be found when the muster-roll was called. The French say, _Il y a un\r\n  Dieu pour les ivrognes_; and the truth of the proverb was never better\r\n  exemplified than in this man’s case. He had been thrown into the air,\r\n  had returned unhurt to mother-earth, continued his drunken sleep\r\n  again, had awaked next morning, found the fort to his surprise a mass\r\n  of deserted ruins, and quietly walked back to the Residency without\r\n  being molested by a soul; and even bringing with him a pair of\r\n  bullocks attached to a cart of ammunition. It is very probable that\r\n  the débris of these extensive buildings must have seriously injured\r\n  the adjacent houses and many of the rebel army—thus giving the\r\n  fortunate man the means of escaping.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  The authoress of the _Lady’s Diary_ gives an affecting account of the\r\n  hour that succeeded the wounding of Sir Henry Lawrence. She, with her\r\n  husband, was at that time in the house of Dr Fayrer, a surgeon who had\r\n  more than once urged upon Sir Henry the paramount duty of cherishing\r\n  his own life as one valuable to others even if slighted by himself.\r\n  ‘He was brought over to this house immediately. —— prayed with him,\r\n  and administered the Holy Communion to him. He was quite sensible,\r\n  though his agony was extreme. He spoke for nearly an hour, quite\r\n  calmly, expressing his last wishes with regard to his children. He\r\n  sent affectionate messages to them and to each of his brothers and\r\n  sisters. He particularly mentioned the Lawrence Asylum, and entreated\r\n  that government might be urged to give it support. He bade farewell to\r\n  all the gentlemen who were standing round his bed, and said a few\r\n  words of advice and kindness to each.... There was not a dry eye\r\n  there; every one was so deeply affected and grieved at the loss of\r\n  such a man.’\r\n\r\n  It may here be stated that the Queen afterwards bestowed a baronetcy\r\n  on Sir Henry’s eldest son, Alexander Lawrence; to whom also the East\r\n  India Company voted a pension of £1000 per annum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  The _Jersey Times_ of December 10, 1857, contained what professed to\r\n  be an extract of a letter from M. de Bannerol, a French physician in\r\n  the service of Mussur Rajah, dated October 8, and published in _Le\r\n  Pays_ (Paris paper), giving an account of the feelings of the\r\n  Christian women shut up within Lucknow just before their relief. It\r\n  went on to state how Jessie Brown, a corporal’s wife, cheered the\r\n  party in the depth of their terrors and despair, by starting up and\r\n  declaring that, amidst the roar of the artillery, she caught the faint\r\n  sound of the _slogan_ of the approaching Highlanders, particularly\r\n  that of the Macgregor, ‘the grandest of them a’!’ The soldiers\r\n  intermitted firing to listen, but could hear nothing of the kind, and\r\n  despair once more settled down upon the party. After a little\r\n  interval, Jessie broke out once more with words of hope, referring to\r\n  the sound of the Highland bagpipes, which the party at length\r\n  acknowledged they heard; and then by one impulse, all fell on their\r\n  knees, ‘and nothing was heard but the bursting sob and the voice of\r\n  prayer.’ The tale has made so great an impression on the public mind,\r\n  that we feel much reluctance in expressing our belief that it is\r\n  either wholly a fiction, or only based slightly in fact. What excited\r\n  our distrust from the first was the allusion to the slogans or\r\n  war-cries of the respective clans—things which have had no practical\r\n  existence for centuries, and which would manifestly be inappropriate\r\n  in regiments composed of a miscellany of clansmen, not to speak of the\r\n  large admixture of Lowlanders. We are assured that the story is looked\r\n  upon in the best-informed quarters as purely a tale of the\r\n  imagination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  See chap. xv., p. 263.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  Sir Henry Lawrence; Major Banks; Lieutenant-colonel Case, Captains\r\n  Steevens, Mansfield, Radcliffe, and M’Cabe, 32d foot; Captain Francis,\r\n  13th N.

The subject may be\r\ntreated in the same style as in Chapter xvii., relating to the months of\r\nJuly and August, but more briefly; for, in truth, so few Bengal native\r\nregiments now remained ‘true to their salt,’ that the materials for\r\nfurther mutiny were almost exhausted.\r\n\r\nOf Calcutta, and the region around it on all sides, little need be said.\r\nMutiny in that neighbourhood would not have been easy during the autumn\r\nmonths; for British troops were gradually arriving, who would speedily\r\nhave put down any rebellious risings. Sometimes alarms agitated the\r\ncivilians and traders in the city; but nothing really serious called for\r\nnotice. The ex-king of Oude continued to be watched carefully at\r\nCalcutta. Whatever honeyed phrases may have been used to render his\r\ndetention more palatable, none of the government officers placed any\r\nreliance on his fidelity or peacefulness. In truth, if he _had_\r\ndisplayed those qualities, after being compelled to witness the\r\nannexation of his country to the British raj, he would have been\r\nsomething more (or less) than oriental. At various times during the\r\nsummer and autumn months, scrutinising inquiries were made into the\r\nconduct of the king and his retainers. Thus, on the 16th of August, a\r\nperson who had for some time resided at Calcutta, under the assumed\r\ntitle of Bishop of Bagdad, but whose real name was Syed Hossein Shubber,\r\nwas with five others arrested, for complicity in plots affecting the\r\nBritish government; and, consequent on papers discovered, three\r\nretainers of the king were arrested about a week afterwards. The\r\ngovernment kept secret the details of these affairs, pending further\r\ninquiry; but it was apparent enough that mischief was fermenting in the\r\nminds of the royal prisoner’s retainers. Unquestionably many natives\r\nsincerely believed the king to have been an ill-used man—an opinion\r\nshared also by many Europeans—and they did not deem it treason to aid\r\nhim in his misfortunes.\r\n\r\nMuch to the vexation of the government, the district of Assam, little\r\nknown to Europeans except as a region where tea is experimentally grown,\r\nwas drawn into the vortex of trouble early in September. Many of the\r\nsepoys of the 1st Assam native infantry came from the neighbourhood of\r\nArrah, and were closely related to one regiment (the 40th) of the\r\nDinapoor mutineers; while others were from the estates of Koer Singh.\r\nWhen, therefore, the news of the Dinapoor mutiny became known, the Assam\r\nregiment was thrown into much agitation. There was a rajah in Assam, one\r\nSaring Kunderpessawar Singh, who secretly engaged in treasonable\r\ncorrespondence, and who received offers of support from the Arrah men of\r\nthe Assam regiment, if he would openly break with the British. There\r\nwere also Hindustanis in the 2d Assam native regiment; while the\r\nartillery companies at Debrooghur were entirely Hindustanis. It was\r\nknown likewise that many of the neighbouring tribes were in a\r\ndisaffected state, and that a religious mendicant was rapidly moving\r\nabout with some secret but apparently mischievous purpose. By degrees a\r\nplot was discovered. The conspirators planned on a given day to murder\r\nall the Christians in Assam, and then plunder the stations. Fortunately\r\nthis project was known in time. The Calcutta government having no\r\nsoldiers to spare, organised a force of English seamen, trained as\r\ngunners, and sent them by a steamer up the Brahmaputra to Debrooghur, to\r\nbe employed as the local authorities might deem advisable. One of the\r\ncircumstances connected with this movement illustrates the antagonism\r\nbetween governing authorities and newspaper writers on military\r\nmatters—an antagonism frequently felt during the Indian Revolt as during\r\nthe Russian war. A responsible leader wishes to keep his plans of\r\nstrategy secret from the enemy; a newspaper writer wishes to give as\r\nmuch news as possible on all subjects; and these two modes of\r\nprocedure do not always flow in harmonious concord. Mr Halliday,\r\nlieutenant-governor of Bengal, in reporting on this Assam affair, said:\r\n‘The utmost care was taken to despatch the force to Assam with the\r\nsecrecy necessary to prevent its destination being known; but it is\r\nfeared that this intention has been frustrated by the ill-judged\r\npublication of the departure of the steamer, and notification of its\r\nobjects, by the Calcutta papers. It is hoped that this injudicious\r\nproceeding may not be attended with the serious results that would ensue\r\nfrom a revolt in the province in its present unprotected state. Such an\r\nuntoward contingency was feared by the officers in Assam, who pointed\r\nout the urgent necessity of extreme care being observed in preventing\r\nthe promulgation of the transmission, before its arrival, of any\r\nEuropean force that might be sent; lest the knowledge of the approach of\r\naid should cause a premature explosion of the expected revolt.’ The\r\nforce consisted of 100 armed sailors, with two 12-pounder guns; they set\r\nout on the 11th of September, under the charge of Lieutenant Davies, in\r\nthe steamer _Horungotta_; and were to be at the disposal of Colonel\r\nJenkins on arriving in Assam. As a curious example of the different\r\nlight in which different tribes were at this time viewed, it may be\r\nstated that all the men of the 1st Assam infantry who were _not_\r\nHindustanis were called in from the outposts to Debrooghur, as a\r\nprotection in case the remainder of the regiment should mutiny. Captain\r\nLowther, commanding a corps of Goorkhas, was sent from another station\r\nto capture the rajah; this he managed admirably, and in so doing,\r\neffectually crushed the incipient mutiny. The captain, in a private\r\nletter, told in excellent style the story of his expedition; from which\r\nwe will extract so much as relates to the night-scene in the rajah’s\r\npalace at Debrooghur.[105]\r\n\r\nSome weeks afterwards, towards the close of October, Mr Halliday\r\nentertained much distrust of the 73d Bengal native infantry, of which\r\ntwo companies were at Dacca, and the main body at Jelpigoree, near the\r\nBhotan frontier. By precautionary measures, however, he prevented for a\r\ntime any actual outbreak of this particular regiment.\r\n\r\nThere were reasons why the towns on the banks of the Lower Ganges\r\nremained tolerably free from rebellion during the months now under\r\nnotice. English regiments, in wings or detachments, were sent up the\r\nriver in flats tugged by steamers, from Calcutta towards Upper India;\r\nand the turbulent rabble of the towns were awed into quietness by the\r\nvicinity of these red-coats. Berhampore, Moorshedabad, Rajmahal,\r\nBhagulpore, Monghir, Patna, Dinapoor, Buxar, Ghazeepore, Benares,\r\nMirzapore—all felt the benefit of this occasional passing of British\r\ntroops along the Ganges, in the moral effect produced on the natives.\r\nTrue, the arrivals at Calcutta were few and far apart until October was\r\nwell advanced; true, many of the troops were sent by land along the main\r\ntrunk-road, for greater expedition; true, those who went by water were\r\ntoo urgently needed in the Doab and in Oude to be spared for\r\nintermediate service at the towns above named; but, nevertheless, the\r\nmere transit of a few English regiments effected much towards the\r\ntranquillising of Bengal. Early in the month of August, Lord Elgin had\r\ncome to Calcutta, and placed at the disposal of Lord Canning two\r\nwar-steamers, the _Shannon_ and the _Pearl_; and from among the\r\nresources of these steamers was organised a splendid naval brigade,\r\nconsisting of 400 able British seamen, and no less than ten of the\r\nenormous 68-pounder guns which such seamen know so well how to handle.\r\nThey started from Calcutta up the Hoogly and the Ganges, under the\r\ncommand of Captain Peel, who had so gallantly managed a naval-battery in\r\nthe Crimea during the siege of Sebastopol. If such a man could fret, he\r\nwould have fretted at the slowness of his voyage. Week after week\r\nelapsed, without his reaching those districts where his services would\r\nbe invaluable. Half of August and the whole of September thus passed\r\nwearily away in this most tedious voyage. The upward passage is always\r\ntardy, against the stream; and his ponderous artillery rendered slowness\r\nstill more slow. It was not until the 30th of September that he, with\r\n286 men of his brigade, arrived at Benares. Hastening on, he arrived\r\nwith 94 men at Allahabad on the 3d of October; and four days afterwards\r\nthe rest joined him, with their enormous guns and store of ammunition. A\r\nsmall naval brigade, under Captain Sotheby, was placed at the disposal\r\nof the Patna authorities, to be used against certain insurgents in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe portion of Bengal north of the Ganges was almost entirely free from\r\ndisturbance during these two months; but the parallel portion of Behar\r\nwas in a very different state. The actual mutinies there had been few in\r\nnumber, for in truth there had not been many native troops quartered in\r\nthat region; but the rebellious chieftains and zemindars were many, each\r\nof whom could command the services of a body of retainers ready for any\r\nmischief. Patna, in September, as in earlier months, was disturbed\r\nrather by anarchy in other regions than by actual mutinies within the\r\ncity itself. In what way the Dinapoor troubles affected it, we have seen\r\nin an earlier chapter. Its present difficulties lay rather with the\r\ndistricts north and northwest of the city, where the revenue collectors\r\nhad been driven from place to place by mutinous sepoys, and by petty\r\nchieftains who wished to strengthen themselves at the expense of the\r\nEnglish ‘raj.’ The abandonment of Goruckpore by the officials, in a\r\nmoment of fright, had had the effect of exposing the Chupra, Chumparun,\r\nand Mozufferpoor districts to the attacks of rebels, especially such as\r\nhad placed themselves under the banner of the Mussulman chieftain\r\nMahomed Hussein Khan, the self-appointed ‘ruler in the name and on\r\nbehalf of the King of Oude.’ This man had collected a considerable\r\nforce, and had organised a species of government at Goruckpore. The\r\nmilitary power in the hands of the Company’s servants in the Chupra and\r\nTirhoot districts consisted chiefly of a few Sikhs of the police\r\nbattalion, quite unequal to the resistance of an incursion by Mahomed\r\nHussein. The civilians of those districts sent urgent applications to\r\nPatna for military aid. But how could this be furnished? Troops and\r\nartillery were so imperatively demanded at Cawnpore, to aid the\r\noperations at Lucknow, that none could be detained on their passage up\r\nthe river; the Dinapoor garrison, reduced by the mutiny and its\r\nconsequences, could only spare a few troops for Patna itself; the troops\r\ngoing up the main trunk-road from Calcutta to Upper India could barely\r\nafford time and strength to encounter the Ramgurh insurgents, without\r\nattempting anything north of the Ganges. There happened, however, to be\r\na Madras regiment passing up by steamer to Allahabad; and permission was\r\nobtained to detain a portion of this regiment for service in the\r\nGoruckpore region; while the Rajahs of Bettiah and Hutwah were\r\nencouraged to maintain a friendly attitude in support of the British\r\nauthorities. The rebel or rather rabble forces under Mahomed Hussein\r\nwere ill armed and worse disciplined; and it was probable that a few men\r\nof the 17th M. N. I., with a few Sikhs, could have beaten them at any\r\ntime; but it was felt necessary to reoccupy Goruckpore at once, to\r\nprevent the neighbouring zemindars and thalookdars from joining the\r\nmalcontents.\r\n\r\nThat Lord Canning accepted an offer of several Goorkha regiments, from\r\nJung Bahadoor of Nepaul, has been stated in a former chapter; but a very\r\nlong time elapsed before those hardy little troops were enabled to\r\nrender much service. The process of collecting them at Khatmandoo and\r\nelsewhere occupied several weeks, and it was not until the beginning of\r\nSeptember that they reached Jounpoor, a station in the very heart of the\r\ndisturbed districts. Even then, there was much tardiness in bringing\r\nthem into active service; for the English officers appointed to command\r\nthem did not at first understand the difference of management required\r\nby Hindustani sepoys and Nepaulese Goorkhas. Happily, an opportunity\r\noccurred for remedying this defect. A smart affair on the 20th of\r\nSeptember afforded the Goorkhas an opportunity of shewing their\r\ngallantry. Colonel Wroughton, military commandant at Jounpoor, having\r\nheard that Azimghur was threatened with an attack by 8000 rebels under\r\nMadhoo Singh of Atrowlia, resolved to send a regiment of Goorkhas from\r\nJounpoor to strengthen the force already at Azimghur. They started at\r\nonce, marched the distance in a day and a half, and reached the\r\nthreatened city on the evening of the 19th. This was the Shere regiment\r\nof Jung Bahadoor’s force, under Colonel Shumshere Singh, a Nepaulese\r\nofficer. At a very early hour on the morning of the 20th, it was\r\nascertained that a large body of rebels had assembled in and near the\r\nneighbouring village of Mundoree. A force of 1200 men, mostly belonging\r\nto three Goorkha regiments, was immediately sent out to disperse\r\nthem—Captain Boileau commanding, Colonel Shumshere Singh heading the\r\nGoorkhas, and Mr Venables (whose prowess had already been displayed in\r\nthe same district) taking charge of a small body of local horse. Finding\r\nthat the rebels were posted in a clump of trees and in a jheel behind\r\nthe village, Captain Boileau directed Shumshere Singh to advance his\r\nGoorkhas at double pace. This was done, despite the fire from several\r\nguns; the little Goorkhas charged, drove the enemy away towards\r\nCaptangunje, and captured three brass guns and all the camp-equipage. Mr\r\nVenables was seen wherever the fighting was thickest; he was up at the\r\nfirst gun taken, and killed three of the enemy with his own hand. About\r\n200 of the enemy were laid low in this brief encounter, and one-sixth of\r\nthis number on the part of the victors.\r\n\r\nThis little battle of Mundoree had a moral effect, superadded to the\r\nimmediate dispersing of a body of rebels. It shewed the soldierly\r\nconduct of the Goorkhas, who had marched fifty miles in two days, and\r\nthen won a battle in a kind of country to which they were unaccustomed.\r\nIt proved the intrepidity of one of the civil servants of the Company,\r\nwhose sterling qualities were brought forth at a critical time.\r\nMoreover, it dissipated a prejudice against the Goorkhas formed by some\r\nof the British officers. These troops had hitherto remained nearly\r\ninactive in the region between Nepaul and the Ganges. Jung Bahadoor had\r\nsent them, under a native officer, Colonel Puhlwan Singh, to be employed\r\nwherever the authorities deemed best. Colonel Wroughton, and other\r\nBritish officers, formed an opinion that the Nepaulese troops were\r\nincapable of rapid movement, and that their native officers dreaded the\r\nresponsibility of independent action. Mr Grant, lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe Central Provinces, in an official letter to Colonel Wroughton after\r\nthe battle of Mundoree, pointed out that this opinion had been very\r\ndetrimental to the public service, in discouraging any employment of the\r\nGoorkhas. He added: ‘It was natural to expect that foreigners, and those\r\nforeigners mountaineers, unaccustomed either to the plains or to their\r\ninhabitants, should at first feel some awkwardness in the new position\r\nin which they were placed, with everything strange around them. The\r\nsagacity of Jung Bahadoor had already foreseen this difficulty; and it\r\nwas at his earnest desire that British officers were attached to the\r\nGoorkha force, to encourage the officers and men, and to explain how\r\noperations should be carried on in such a country and such a climate as\r\nthat in which they now for the first time marched, and against such an\r\nenemy as they now for the first time met.... The lieutenant-governor\r\nwill now confidently look to you that the Goorkha force is henceforth\r\nactively employed in the service for which it was placed at the disposal\r\nof the British government by the Nepaulese.’ It must be borne in mind,\r\nto prevent confusion, that this Goorkha force, lent by Jung Bahadoor,\r\nwas distinct from the Goorkha battalions of Sirmoor and Kumaon, often\r\nmentioned in former chapters; those battalions were part of the Bengal\r\nnative army, fortunately consisting of Goorkhas instead of ‘Pandies;’\r\nwhereas the new force was a Nepaulese army, lent for a special purpose.\r\n\r\nMr Grant, the temporarily appointed lieutenant-governor just mentioned,\r\nemployed all his energies throughout September and October in promoting\r\nthe transit of British troops from the lower to the upper provinces, to\r\naid in the operations at Cawnpore and Lucknow. He could not, however,\r\nforget the fact that the eastern frontier of Oude adjoined the British\r\ndistricts of Goruckpore, Jounpoor, and Azimghur; and that the Oude\r\nrebels were continually making demonstrations on that side. He longed\r\nfor British troops, to strengthen and encourage the Goorkhas in his\r\nservice, and occasionally applied for a few; but he, as all others, was\r\ntold that the relief of the residents at Lucknow must precede, and be\r\nparamount over, all other military operations whatever. Writing to Lord\r\nCanning from Benares on the 15th of October, he said: ‘It is a point for\r\nconsideration, how much longer it will be otherwise than imprudent to\r\ncontinue to send the whole of the daily arrivals of Europeans nearly\r\nhalf-way round the province of Oude, in order to create a pressure upon\r\nthe rear of the mutineers and insurgents of that province from the\r\ndirection of Cawnpore and Lucknow, whilst our home districts are left\r\nthus open to them in their front.’ He expressed a hope that the Punjaub\r\nand Delhi regions would be able to supply nearly troops enough for\r\nimmediate operations at Lucknow; and that a portion of the British\r\nregiments sent up from the lower provinces would be permitted to form\r\nthe nucleus of a new army at Benares, for operations on the eastern\r\nfrontier of Oude. Many weeks elapsed, however, before this suggestion\r\ncould meet with practical attention.\r\n\r\nThus it was throughout the districts of Goruckpore, Jounpoor, Azimghur,\r\nand others eastward of Oude and north of the Ganges. If the British had\r\nhad to contend only with mutinied sepoys and sowars, victory would more\r\ngenerally and completely have attended their exertions; but rebellious\r\nchieftains were numerous, and these, encouraged by the newly established\r\nrebel government at Lucknow, continually harassed the British officials\r\nplaced in charge of those districts. The colonels, captains, judges,\r\nmagistrates, collectors—all cried aloud for more European troops; their\r\ncries were heeded at Calcutta, but could not be satisfied, for reasons\r\nalready sufficiently explained.\r\n\r\nLet us cross the Ganges, and watch the state of affairs in the\r\nsouthwestern districts of Bengal and Behar during the months of\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\nThroughout this wide region, the troubles arose rather from sepoys\r\nalready rebellious, than from new instances of mutiny. Preceding\r\nchapters have shewn that the 8th Bengal native infantry mutinied at\r\nHazarebagh on the 30th of July; that the infantry of the Ramgurh\r\nbattalion followed the pernicious example on the next day; that the 5th\r\nirregular cavalry mutinied at Bhagulpore on the 14th of August; and that\r\nthe 7th, 8th, and 40th regiments of native infantry which mutinied at\r\nDinapoor on the 25th of July, kept the whole of Western Bengal in\r\nagitation throughout August, by rendering uncertain in which direction\r\nthey would march, under the rebel chieftain, Koer Singh. The only\r\nadditional mutiny, in this region, was that of the 32d native infantry,\r\npresently to be noticed. The elements of anarchy were, however, already\r\nnumerous and violent enough to plunge the whole district into disorder.\r\nSome of the towns were the centres of opium-growing or indigo-producing\r\nregions; many were surrounded simply by rice or cornfields; others,\r\nagain, were military stations, at which the Company were accustomed to\r\nkeep troops; while several were dâk or post stations, for the\r\nmaintenance of communication along the great trunk-road from Calcutta to\r\nBenares. But wherever and whatever they may have been, these towns were\r\nseldom at peace during the months now under notice. The towns-people and\r\nthe surrounding villagers were perpetually affected by rumours that the\r\nmutinous 5th cavalry were coming, or the mutinous 8th infantry, or the\r\nRamgurh mutineers, or those from Dinapoor. For, it must be borne in\r\nmind, we are now treating of a part of India inhabited chiefly by\r\nBengalees, a race too timid to supply many fighting rebels—too fond of\r\nquiet industry willingly to belt on the sword or shoulder the matchlock.\r\nThey may or may not have loved the British; if not, they would rather\r\nintrigue than fight against them. In the contest arising out of the\r\nmutiny, these Bengalees suffered greatly. The mutineers, joined by the\r\nreleased vagabonds from the jails, too frequently plundered all alike,\r\nFeringhee and native; and the quiet trader or cultivator had much reason\r\nto dread the approach of such workers of mischief. The Europeans, few in\r\nnumber, and oppressed with responsibility, knew not which way to turn\r\nfor aid. Revenue collectors, with many lacs of the Company’s rupees,\r\nfeared for the safety of their treasure. Military officers, endeavouring\r\nwith a handful of troops to check the passage of mutineers, were\r\nbewildered by the vague and conflicting intelligence which reached them.\r\nOfficials at the dâk-stations, impressed daily by stringent orders from\r\nCalcutta to keep open the main line of road for the passage of English\r\ntroops to Upper India, were in perpetual anxiety lest bands of mutineers\r\nshould approach and cut off the dâks altogether. Every one begged and\r\nprayed the Calcutta government to send him a few trusty troops; every\r\none assured the government that the salvation of that part of India\r\ndepended on the request being acceded to.\r\n\r\nDorunda, sixty miles south of Hazarebagh, was a scene of violence on the\r\n11th of September. The Ramgurh mutineers destroyed the public and\r\nprivate buildings at this place, plundered the town, committed great\r\natrocities on the towns-people, beheaded a native surgeon belonging to\r\nthe jail, and marched off in the direction of Tikhoo Ghat, taking with\r\nthem four guns and a large amount of plunder and ammunition. Their\r\napparent intention was to march through the Palamow district, and effect\r\na junction with Koer Singh, with whom they had been in correspondence.\r\nOnly four men of the Ramgurh irregular cavalry were of the party; all\r\nthe rest were infantry. The cavalry, remaining faithful as a body,\r\nseized the first opportunity of joining their officers at Hazarebagh.\r\nThis was another instance of divergence between the two parts of one\r\ncorps, wholly inexplicable to the British officers, who could offer no\r\nreason why the infantry had lapsed, while the cavalry remained faithful.\r\nIn this part of India the mutineers were not supported by the zemindars\r\nor landowners, as in other districts; and hence the few British troops\r\nwere better enabled to lay plans for the frustration of these workers of\r\nmischief. Captain Fischer, Captain Dalton, Major English, Captain Oakes,\r\nCaptain Davies, Captain Rattray, Lieutenant Graham, Lieutenant Birch,\r\nand other officers, were in command of small bodies of troops in this\r\nregion during the greater part of the month; these troops consisted of\r\nMadras natives, Sikhs, and a very few British; and the numerous trifling\r\nbut serviceable affairs in which they were engaged bore relation to the\r\nregiments which had mutinied at Ramgurh, Bhagulpore, and Dinapoor, and\r\nto the chieftains and marauders who joined those disloyal soldiers.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons already assigned, however, the British troops were very\r\nfew in number; while the Madras troops were so urgently needed in the\r\nmore turbulent Saugor provinces, that they could barely be spared for\r\nservice in Bengal. Regiments had not at that time begun to arrive very\r\nrapidly from England; the few that did land at Calcutta, were eagerly\r\ncaught up for service in the Doab and Oude. In most instances, the aid\r\nwhich was afforded by English troops to the region now under notice,\r\ndepended on a temporary stoppage of a regiment or detachment on its\r\npassage to the upper provinces; in urgent cases, the government ordered\r\nor permitted a small British force to diverge from its direct line of\r\nmarch, and render aid to a Bengal town or station at a particular\r\njuncture. Such was the case with H.M. 53d foot. Major English, with a\r\nwing of this regiment, had a contest with the Ramgurh mutineers on the\r\n29th of September. He marched from Hazarebagh to Sillis Chowk, where he\r\nheard news of these insurgents; and by further active movements he came\r\nup with them on the 2d of October, just as they had begun to plunder the\r\ntown of Chuttra. The mutineers planted two guns so as to play upon the\r\nBritish; but the latter, in the way which had by this time become quite\r\ncommon with their comrades in India, determined to attack and take the\r\nguns by a fearless advance. On they went, through rice-fields, behind\r\nrocks and underwood, through lanes and round buildings, running and\r\ncheering, until they had captured four guns in succession, together with\r\nammunition, ten elephants, and other warlike appliances, and sent the\r\nenemy fleeing. The officers dashed on at the head of their respective\r\nparties of men in a way that astonished the enemy; and the major,\r\nviewing these enterprises with the eye of a soldier, said in his\r\ndispatch: ‘It was splendid to see them rush on the guns.’ His loss was,\r\nhowever, considerable; 5 killed and 33 wounded out of three companies\r\nonly. In addition to military trophies, Major English took fifty\r\nthousand rupees of the Company’s treasure from the mutineers, who, like\r\nmutineers elsewhere, regarded the revenue collections as fair booty when\r\nonce they had thrown off allegiance. During the operations of the 53d in\r\nthis region—one, in many parts of which British soldiers had never been\r\nseen—an instance was afforded of the dismay into which the civilians\r\nwere sometimes thrown by the withdrawal of trusty troops; it was\r\nnarrated in a letter written by an officer of that regiment.[106]\r\n\r\nThe native regiments were often distributed in detachments at different\r\nstations; and it frequently happened—as just adverted to—for reasons\r\nwholly inexplicable to the authorities, that some of those component\r\nelements remained faithful long after others had mutinied. Such was the\r\ncase in reference to the 32d B. N. I. Two companies of that regiment,\r\nstationed at Deoghur in the Sonthal district, rose in mutiny on the 9th\r\nof October, murdered Lieutenant Cooper and the assistant-commissary,\r\nlooted the bazaar, and then marched off to Rohnee, taking with them\r\nLieutenant Rennie as a prisoner. Two other companies of the regiment\r\nwere at that time _en route_ from Burhait to Soorie, while the\r\nheadquarter companies were at Bowsee. The authorities at Calcutta at\r\nonce sought to ascertain what was the feeling among the men at the\r\nstations just named; but, pending these inquiries, orders were given to\r\ndespatch a wing of H.M. 13th foot from Calcutta to the Sonthal district,\r\nto control the mutineers. Major English was at that time going to the\r\nupper provinces with a detachment of H.M. 53d foot; but he was now\r\nordered to turn aside for a while, and aid in pacifying the district\r\nbefore pursuing his journey to Benares. Although the remaining companies\r\nof the native 32d did afterwards take rank among the mutineers, they\r\nwere ‘true to their salt’ for some time after the treachery of their\r\ncompanions had become known.\r\n\r\nThis 32d mutinous regiment succeeded in crossing the Sone river, with\r\nthe intention of joining Koer Singh and the Dinapoor mutineers—a feat\r\nmanaged in a way that greatly mortified Major English’s 53d. On the 20th\r\nof October the wing of this latter regiment proceeded from Sheergotty to\r\nGayah, to reassure the uneasy officials at that station; and on the 22d\r\nthey started again, to intercept the mutineers. After much hot and\r\nwearying marching, they returned to Gayah, without having encountered\r\nthe mutineers, one portion of whom had crossed the Sone. Some days\r\nlater, news arrived that the second portion of the 32d, that which had\r\nnot at first mutinied, was, in like manner, marching towards the river.\r\nOn the 1st of November the 53d started in pursuit, marched thirty miles\r\nduring the night to Hurwa, rested a while, marched ten miles further to\r\nNowada during the evening, and came up with the mutineers in the night.\r\nA skirmish by moonlight took place, greatly to the advantage of the\r\nrebels, who had a better knowledge of the country than their opponents.\r\nThe sepoys did not want to fight, they wished to march towards the Sone;\r\nand this they did day after day until the 6th, followed closely all the\r\nway by the British. The pursued outstripped the pursuers, and safely\r\ncrossed the river—much to the vexation of the major and his troops. One\r\nof the officers present has said: ‘This was very provoking; for if we\r\nhad but caught them, we should have got as much credit for it as for\r\nChuttra. The country we went through was, for the most part, over swampy\r\nrice-fields; when we gave up the pursuit we had gone 130 miles in 108\r\nhours; and, on our return to Gayah, we had been 170 miles in exactly one\r\nweek. After the second day we sent our tents and bedding back; so that\r\nwe marched as lightly as possible, and were by that means able to give\r\nthe men an occasional lift on the elephants.’\r\n\r\nThroughout these miscellaneous and often desultory operations in Bengal,\r\nif the Sikhs had proved faithless, all would have gone to ruin. It was\r\nmore easy to obtain a thousand Sikhs than a hundred British, and thus\r\nthey were made use of as a sort of military police, irrespective of the\r\nregular regiments raised in the Punjaub. Few circumstances are more\r\nobservable throughout the Revolt, than the fidelity of these men.\r\nInsubordination there was, certainly, in some instances, but not in\r\nsufficient degree to affect the character of the whole. Captain\r\nRattray’s Sikhs have often been mentioned. These were a corps of\r\nmilitary police, formed for rendering service in any part of Bengal; and\r\nin the rendering of this service they were most admirable. The\r\nlieutenant-governor of Bengal, in a paper drawn up early in September,\r\nsaid: ‘The commandant of the Sikh Police Battalion has pleaded strongly\r\non his own behalf, and on that of his men, for the assembling of the\r\nscattered fragments of his corps, to enable them to strike such a blow\r\nas to prove the high military spirit and discipline of the regiment. The\r\nurgent necessities which caused the separation of Captain Rattray’s\r\nregiment renders it impossible, in existing circumstances, to call in\r\nall detachments to head-quarters; but its admirable discipline, daring,\r\nand devotion at Arrah and Jugdispore, and its good conduct everywhere,\r\nhave fully established its character for soldierly qualities of the\r\nhighest order. It would be difficult to exaggerate the value of the\r\nservices which it has rendered to the state since the commencement of\r\nthe present troubles; and the trust and confidence everywhere reposed in\r\nit, prove that these services are neither underrated nor disregarded. Of\r\nthe men, all who have distinguished themselves for conspicuous deeds of\r\nvalour and loyalty, have already been rewarded.’ As individuals, too,\r\nthe Sikhs were reliable in a remarkable degree, when Hindustanis were\r\nfalling away on all sides. When the troubles broke out at Benares, early\r\nin the mutiny, a Sikh chieftain, by name Rajah Soorut Singh, rendered\r\ninvaluable service to the British residents, which they did not fail\r\ngratefully to remember at a later period. A few of the Company’s\r\nservants, civil and military, at Benares and other towns in that part of\r\nIndia, caused to be manufactured by Mr Westley Richards of Birmingham,\r\nfor presentation to Soorut Singh, a splendid set of firearms, effective\r\nfor use as well as superb in appearance.\r\n\r\nWe will now cross the Sone, and trace the progress of affairs in the\r\nBundelcund and Saugor provinces.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, from the details given in former chapters, that\r\nthe native inhabitants of Bundelcund, and other regions south of the\r\nJumna and the Central Ganges, displayed a more turbulent tendency than\r\nthose of Bengal. They had for ages been more addicted to war, and had\r\namong them a greater number of chieftains employing retainers in their\r\npay, than the Bengalese; and they were within easier reach of the\r\ntemptations thrown out by Nena Sahib, the King of Delhi, Koer Singh, and\r\nthe agents of the deposed King of Oude. Lieutenant (now Captain)\r\nOsborne, the British resident at Rewah, was one who felt the full force\r\nof this state of circumstances. As he had been in August, so was he now\r\nin September, almost the only Englishman within a wide range of country\r\nsouthwest of Allahabad; the rajah of Rewah was faithful, but his native\r\ntroops were prone to rebellion; and it was only by wonderful sagacity\r\nand firmness that he could protect both the rajah and himself from the\r\nvortex.\r\n\r\nIn a wide region eastward of Rewah, the question arose, every day\r\nthroughout September, where is Koer Singh? This treacherous chieftain,\r\nwho headed the Dinapoor mutineers from the day of their entering Arrah,\r\nwas continually marching about with his rebel army of something like\r\n3000 men, apparently uncertain of his plans—an uncertainty very\r\nperplexing to the British officials, who, having a mere handful of\r\ntroops at their disposal, did not know where that handful might most\r\nprofitably be employed. On one day Koer Singh, with his brother Ummer\r\nSingh, would be reported at Rotas, on another day at Sasseram; sometimes\r\nthere was a rumour of the rebels being about to march to Rewah and\r\nBundelcund; at others, that they were going to join the Goruckpore\r\ninsurgents; and at others, again, that the Dinapoor and Ramgurh\r\nmutineers would act in concert. Wherever they went, however, plunder and\r\nrapine marked their footsteps. At one of the towns, the heirs of a\r\nzemindar, whose estates had been forfeited many years before, levied a\r\nthousand men to aid in seizing the property from the present\r\nproprietors. This was one among many proofs afforded during the mutiny,\r\nthat chieftains and landowners sought to make the revolt of the native\r\nsoldiery a means for insuring their own private ends, whether those ends\r\nwere justifiable or not. The authorities at Patna and elsewhere\r\nendeavoured to meet these varied difficulties as best they could with\r\ntheir limited resources. They sent to Calcutta all the ladies and\r\nchildren from disturbed districts, so far as they possessed means of\r\nconveyance. They empowered the indigo-planters to raise small bodies of\r\npolice force in their respective districts. They obtained the aid of two\r\nregiments of Goorkhas in the Chumparun district, by which the\r\nrestoration of tranquillity might reasonably be expected. They seized\r\nthe estates of Koer Singh and Ummer Singh at Arrah, as traitors. They\r\nimposed heavy fines on villages which had sent men to take active part\r\nin the disturbances. Lastly, they used all their energies to protect\r\nthat part of the main trunk-road which passes near the river Sone;\r\nseeing that the march of European troops from Calcutta to the upper\r\nprovinces would be materially affected by any interruption in that\r\nquarter. The newly arrived British regiments could not go up as an army,\r\nbut as small detachments in bullock-wagons, and therefore were not\r\nprepared for sudden encounters with large numbers of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe 5th irregular cavalry, who had mutinied in this part of India some\r\nweeks before, continued a system of plundering, levying contributions,\r\nand destroying public property. Every day that transpired, leaving these\r\ndaring atrocities unchecked, weakened British prestige, and encouraged\r\nmarauders on all sides to imitate the example so fatally set before\r\nthem. The authorities felt and acknowledged this; yet, for the reasons\r\nalready noticed, they could do little to check it. Captain Rattray, at\r\nthe head of a portion of his Sikh police, encountered the 5th irregulars\r\non the 8th of the month; but, as a cavalry force, they were too strong\r\nfor him; they beat him in action, out-generalled him in movement,\r\nreleased four hundred prisoners from one of the jails, and then marched\r\nwest toward the river Sone. The mutinous sowars were subsequently heard\r\nof at Tikane, Daoodnuggur, Baroon, and other places; everywhere\r\ncommitting great depredations. Thus was a large and important region, on\r\neither side of the main trunk-road, and extending two hundred miles\r\nalong that road, kept in a state of daily agitation. The 5th irregular\r\ncavalry in one quarter, Koer Singh in another, and his brothers Ummer\r\nSingh and Nishan Singh in a third, were all busily employed in\r\ndepredation; patriotism or nationality had little hold on their thoughts\r\njust then; for they plundered whomsoever had property to lose, without\r\nmuch regard to race or creed. The government offered large rewards for\r\nthe capture of these leaders, but without effect: the rebels generally\r\nresisted this kind of temptation. Opium-crops to the value of half a\r\nmillion sterling were at that time ripening in the Behar and Arrah\r\ndistricts alone; and it was feared that all these would be devastated\r\nunless aid arrived from Calcutta.\r\n\r\nMr Wake, and the other civil servants who had so gallantly defended\r\nthemselves at Arrah, against an enormous force of the enemy, returned to\r\nthat station about the middle of September, to resume their duties; but\r\nas it was feared that Ummer Singh and the 5th irregulars would effect a\r\njunction, and attempt to reoccupy Jugdispore, those officers were\r\nauthorised to fall back upon Dinapoor or Buxar, in the event of being\r\nattacked; although they themselves expressed a wish rather to remain at\r\ntheir posts and fortify themselves against the rebels as they had done\r\nbefore. The necessity of making this choice, however, did not arise. The\r\n5th cavalry, after their victory over Rattray’s Sikhs, and during their\r\nvisits to the towns and villages near the Sone, committed, as we have\r\njust said, every kind of atrocity—plundering houses, levying\r\ncontributions, breaking open the zenanas of Hindoo houses, abusing the\r\nwomen, and destroying property too bulky to be carried away—all this\r\nthey did; but for some unexplained reason, they avoided the redoubtable\r\nlittle band at Arrah.\r\n\r\nThe Saugor and Nerbudda provinces, of which the chief towns and stations\r\nwere Banda, Jaloun, Jhansi, Saugor, Jubbulpoor, Nagode, Dumoh, Nowgong,\r\nMundlah, and Hosungabad, were, as we have seen, in a very precarious\r\nstate in the month of August. At Saugor, so early as the month of June,\r\nBrigadier Sage had brought all the Europeans into a well-armed and amply\r\nprovisioned fort, guarded by a body of European gunners, and by the\r\nstill faithful 31st regiment of Bengal infantry; and there the Europeans\r\nremained at the close of August, almost cut off from communication with\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen elsewhere. Jubbulpoor had passed through the\r\nsummer months without actual mutiny; but the revolt of the 42d infantry\r\nand the 3d irregular cavalry, at neighbouring stations, and certain\r\nsuspicious symptoms afforded by the 52d at Jubbulpoor itself, led Major\r\nErskine to fortify the Residency, and provision it for six months.\r\nBanda, Jhansi, and Jaloun, had long fallen into the hands of the rebels;\r\nMundlah and Hosungabad were at the mercy of circumstances occurring at\r\nother places; Nagode would be reliable only so long as the 50th native\r\ninfantry remained true; and Dumoh would be scarcely tenable if\r\nJubbulpoor were in danger. Thus, at the end of August, British supremacy\r\nin the Saugor and Nerbudda territories hung by a thread. The Calcutta\r\nauthorities, unable to supply British troops for Bengal or Behar, were\r\nequally debarred from rendering assistance to these territories.\r\nSeptember opened very gloomily for the officers intrusted with duties in\r\nthis quarter. The Punjaub and Calcutta could only furnish trustworthy\r\ntroops for the Jumna and Doab regions, where the war raged with greatest\r\nfierceness; it was from Madras and Bombay alone that aid could be\r\nexpected. Fortunately, the large regions of Nagpoor and Hyderabad were\r\nnearly at peace, and thus a passage could be afforded for troops from\r\nthe south which would not have been practicable had those countries been\r\nplunged in anarchy.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of September, Lieutenant Clark, deputy-commissioner\r\nof Jubbulpoor, learned a few facts that put him on the track of a\r\nconspiracy. It came out, on inquiry, that Rajah Shunker Shah, and many\r\nother chieftains and zemindars in the neighbourhood of Jubbulpoor,\r\nacting in concert with some of the sepoys of the 52d B. N. I., intended\r\nto attack the cantonment on the last day of the Mohurrum, murder all the\r\nEuropeans, burn the cantonments, and plunder the treasury and city. By a\r\nbold and prompt movement, the chief conspirators were seized on the\r\n14th. The lieutenant, writing to the commissioner of Nagpoor, announced\r\nthe result in brief but significant language. ‘I have been fortunate\r\nenough to get conclusive evidence by means of spies, without the\r\nconspirators taking alarm; and this morning, with a party of sowars and\r\npolice, bagged thirty, and two rajahs (ringleaders) among them. Of\r\ncourse they swing. Many of my principal zemindars, and some—I wish I\r\nknew how many—of the 52d, are in the plot.’ In Rajah Shunker’s house,\r\namong other treasonable papers, was found a sort of prayer, invoking his\r\ndeity to aid him in the destruction of all Europeans, the overturning of\r\nthe government, and the re-establishment of his own power. The paper was\r\nfound in a silk bag in which he kept his fan, and was a scrap torn from\r\na government proclamation issued after the massacre at Meerut. In this\r\ninstance, therefore, the official expression of horror and wrath at the\r\nopening scene of the mutiny, instead of deterring, encouraged others to\r\nwalk in the same bloody path. The prayer or invocation was afterwards\r\ntranslated from the Hindee into English, and published among the\r\nparliamentary papers.[107] The execution of the rajah and his son was\r\nsomething more terrible than was implied by the lieutenant’s curt\r\nannouncement, ‘of course they swing.’ It was one among many examples of\r\nthat ‘blowing away from guns’ to which the records of the mutiny\r\nhabituated English newspaper readers. An officer stationed at Jubbulpoor\r\nat the time, after noticing the complicity of these two guilty men,\r\ndescribes the execution in a brief but painfully vivid way. ‘At the head\r\nof the conspiracy was Shunker Shah, the Ghond rajah, and his son. Their\r\nplace of abode is about four miles from Jubbulpoor. In former days this\r\nfamily ruled over all this part of the country; they can trace their\r\ndescent for sixty generations. The family had been deprived of\r\neverything by the Mahrattas, and were in great poverty when we took\r\npossession. Our government raised them up from this state, and gave them\r\nsufficient to support themselves comfortably; and now they shewed their\r\ngratitude by conspiring against us in our time of sore trial. The family\r\nhave neither much property nor power, but the ancient name and prestige\r\nwas a point on which to rally.... On the 18th, at 11 o’clock A.M., our\r\ntwo guns were advanced a few hundred yards in front of the Residency,\r\ncovered by a company of the 33d and a few troopers, and it became known\r\nthat the Ghond rajah and his son were about to be blown away from the\r\ncannon’s mouth. The old man walked up to the guns with a firm stride;\r\nthe son appeared more dejected. The old man, with his snow-white hair\r\nand firm manner, almost excited compassion; and one had to remember,\r\nbefore such feelings could be checked, how atrociously he intended to\r\ndeal with us had his conspiracy succeeded; the evidence of his guilt was\r\noverwhelming. All was over in a few minutes. The scattered remains were\r\npounced upon by kites and vultures, but what could be collected was\r\nhanded over to the ranee.’\r\n\r\nAlthough Lieutenant Clark was thus enabled, by mingled caution and\r\ndecision, to frustrate the atrocious plot of which Jubbulpoor was to\r\nhave been the theatre, he could not prevent the mutiny of the 52d native\r\nregiment. That corps revolted, albeit without perpetrating the cruelties\r\nand rapine intended. It was on the 18th that this rising took place, the\r\ntroops at once marching off quietly towards Dumoh. One old subadar they\r\ntied on a horse, because he did not wish to join, and because they did\r\nnot choose to leave him behind. It was supposed that the 52d had gone\r\ntowards Dumoh, to capture guns there, and then return to plunder\r\nJubbulpoor. Two days before this, namely, on the 16th, the greater part\r\nof the 50th regiment Bengal infantry threw off allegiance. Being\r\nstationed at Nagode, they suddenly rose, released the prisoners from the\r\njail, burned the bungalows, and rendered the place no longer safe for\r\nEuropeans. Mr Ellis and the other civilians fled to Paunna, while\r\nColonel Hampton and the other military officers made their escape\r\ntowards Jokhie—leaving every vestige of their property behind, except\r\nthe clothes on their backs. Two companies of the regiment, remaining\r\nfaithful, accompanied their officers safely to Mirzapore, a journey\r\nwhich occupied them twelve days.\r\n\r\nThe Europeans at Dumoh, a civil station on the road from Saugor to\r\nJubbulpoor, were thrown into much tribulation by news of these mutinies\r\nat other places. When both the 50th and 52d regiments had ‘gone’—a term\r\nthat acquired much significance in India at that time—Major Erskine,\r\nchief-commissioner of the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, who happened\r\nto be at Dumoh, summoned a council of war on the 20th of September, to\r\nconsider what was best to be done. It was resolved that Dumoh could not\r\nlong be held against any considerable body of mutineers; and that\r\nadvantage should be taken of the temporary presence of a column of\r\nMadras native troops to employ that column as an escort for the\r\ncivilians and the Company’s treasure from Dumoh to Jubbulpoor. There was\r\na detachment of the still faithful 31st at Dumoh; and this was sent to\r\njoin the main body of the regiment at Saugor, to be out of the way of\r\ntemptation from mutinous sepoys.\r\n\r\nThis convoy of men and money from Dumoh led to a smart military\r\nencounter. The Madras movable column which afforded the required\r\nprotection numbered about 500 men of all arms, under Colonel Miller.\r\nLeaving Dumoh on the 21st, and being much obstructed in passing the\r\nriver Nowtah, Colonel Miller reached Sigrampore on the 26th; where he\r\nheard that the main body of the mutineers were at Konee, on the banks of\r\na river which the column would need to cross on its way to Jubbulpoor.\r\nThe colonel at once despatched a force of about 100 men, under\r\nLieutenant Watson, to secure the boats on the river; but the enemy\r\nbaffled this officer, who had much difficulty in preserving his men.\r\nMiller then advanced with his whole column, met the enemy, and fought a\r\nbrief but decisive battle, which ended in the utter rout of the rebel\r\nsepoys. If it had been a purely military affair, the colonel was strong\r\nenough to defeat a more numerous body of the enemy; but he was hampered\r\nby the presence of civilians, treasure, and 120 sepoys of the 52d, who\r\nhad been disarmed at Dumoh on news of the revolt of the main body, and\r\nwhom it was necessary to take with the column. It was, indeed, a strange\r\nstate of things; for the disarmed men were of course eager enough to\r\nrush over and join their companions of the same regiment.\r\n\r\nIt is not matter for censure if men placed in authority at different\r\nstations, in time of peril, occasionally differed concerning the\r\nrelative importance of those stations. Thus, when the 50th and 52d\r\nnative regiments mutinied, a question arose which principal city, Saugor\r\nor Jubbulpoor, should be regarded as a last stronghold in the event of\r\nthe British being nearly overpowered. Major Erskine, at Jubbulpoor,\r\nurged the claims of that city, as having certain facilities for the\r\nreceipt of reinforcements, should such happily be afforded; and as\r\nhaving many European women and children within the fort, who could not\r\nbe removed without danger. Brigadier Sage, on the other hand,\r\nurged—‘Whatever you do, let me retain Saugor. It is the key to Central\r\nIndia. It has a good fort and magazine. It is provisioned for six or\r\neight months for three hundred men, and has thirty thousand maunds of\r\ngrain in addition. It has a siege-train, which will fall into the hands\r\nof the enemy if we leave the place. It contains 170 women and children,\r\nwho could not be withdrawn without danger.’ In such or similar words was\r\nthe retention of Saugor advocated. The discussion happily ended by both\r\ntowns being retained. Those officials of the Company, military or civil,\r\nwho resolutely fortified, instead of abandoning their positions, were in\r\nmost instances rewarded with success—unless the enemy were in unusually\r\noverwhelming force.\r\n\r\nNearly all parts of the Saugor and Nerbudda territories were in wild\r\nconfusion at the close of September. The Kamptee column of Madras troops\r\nhad, as we have just seen, broken up the 52d mutineers; but still those\r\nrebels lay concealed in jungles, ready for mischief whenever an\r\nopportunity might offer; while the Madrasses, distracted by many\r\napplications from different quarters, had been unable to prevent the\r\nmutinous 50th regiment, at Nagode, from marching off to join the\r\nDinapoor mutineers near Banda. At Saugor, Brigadier Sage and the British\r\nwere safe, because they were in a strong and well-provisioned fort, and\r\nbecause the 31st native infantry exhibited no signs of disaffection;\r\nnevertheless the whole country around was in the hands of rebellious\r\nchieftains. On one occasion he sent out the greater part of his force to\r\nattack the Rajah of Bankipore at Nurriowlee, ten miles from Saugor; but\r\nthe attack was unskilfully made—it failed, and greatly lowered British\r\nprestige in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAs in September, so in October, these provinces were held by a very\r\nslender tie. Nearly all the chiefs of Bundelcund, on the border, were\r\nready to rise in rebellion at news of any discomfiture of the British.\r\nNumerous thakoors had risen, and, with their followers, were plundering\r\nthe villages in every direction. At Jubbulpoor, Hosungabad, Nursingpore,\r\nJaloun, Jhansi, Saugor, Mundlah, Dumoh, there was scarcely an English\r\nsoldier; and the presence of a few hundred Madras troops alone stood\r\nbetween the authorities and frightful anarchy. Indeed, Jaloun, Jhansi,\r\nand Dumoh were out of British hands altogether. The commissioner of\r\nNagpoor was unable to send up any more Madrasses from the south; Mr\r\nGrant was unable to send any from Benares; the independent and\r\nhalf-distrusted state of Rewah lay on one border; the thoroughly\r\nrebellious state of Banda on another—and thus Major Erskine looked with\r\ngloomy apprehensions on the fate of the provinces under his charge. As\r\nthe month drew to a close, his accounts were still more dismal. In one\r\nletter he said: ‘The mass of native chiefs disbelieve in the existence\r\nof a British army; and nothing but the presence of troops among them\r\nwill convince them of their error.’ Again find again were such messages\r\nand representations sent to Viscount Canning, as chief authority in\r\nIndia; again and again did he announce that he had no British troops to\r\nspare. To Major Erskine’s letters he replied that he ‘must say broadly\r\nand plainly that he would consider the sacrifice of the garrison in\r\nLucknow as a far greater calamity and reproach to the government than an\r\noutbreak of the Rewah or Bundelcund states, even if followed by\r\nrebellion and temporary loss of our authority in our own territories on\r\nthe Nerbudda.’ At the close of the month, Koer Singh and the Dinapoor\r\nmutineers were somewhere between Banda and Calpee; while Captain\r\nOsborne-one of the most remarkable men whom the Indian Revolt brought\r\ninto notice—still maintained his extraordinary position at Rewah.\r\n\r\nWe pass now further to the west—to the cities and towns on the Jumna\r\nriver, and to the regions of Central India between that river and\r\nBombay. Here, little need detain us until we come to Agra. Futtehpoor,\r\nCawnpore, and Futteghur, though not in Oude, were on its frontier, and\r\nwere involved in the fortunes of that province. Captain Peel’s movements\r\nwith his naval brigade, in the Doab, may be left for treatment in\r\nconnection with the affairs of Lucknow.\r\n\r\nAgra experienced a loss early in September, in the death of John Russell\r\nColvin, the lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces. He fell from\r\nsickness, brought on mainly by the intense anxieties arising out of his\r\nposition. He was a remarkable man, a true specimen of those civilians\r\ndeveloped into usefulness by the unique policy of the East India\r\nCompany. In England a public man becomes a statesman through a multitude\r\nof minor and exceptional causes; in India, under the Company’s ‘raj,’\r\nstatesmen were educated professedly and designedly for their work. In\r\nEngland, we have seen the same statesman transferred from the Exchequer\r\nto the India Board, and from thence to the Admiralty, as if the same\r\nkind of knowledge were required for all three situations; in India, the\r\nstatesman’s education bore more close relation to the duties of the\r\noffices he was likely to fill. No defects in the Company’s government,\r\nno evils arising out of ‘traditional policy,’ no favouritism or\r\nnepotism—can blot out the fact that the system brought out the best\r\nqualities of the men in their service. Well will it be if the imperial\r\ngovernment, in future ages, is served so faithfully, skilfully, and\r\nenergetically in India as the Company’s government, during the last\r\nhalf-century, has been served by the Malcolms, Metcalfes, Munros, Birds,\r\nThomasons, Elphinstones, Montgomerys, Outrams, Lawrences, and\r\nColvins—most of them civilians, whose apprenticeship to Indian\r\nstatesmanship began almost from boyhood.\r\n\r\nMr Colvin, whose death has suggested the above few remarks, had seen as\r\nmuch political service as almost any man in India. He was born in\r\nCalcutta, the son of a merchant engaged in the Calcutta trade. After\r\nreceiving his education in England, and carrying off high honours at\r\nHaileybury, he went to India in the Company’s service in 1826; and for\r\nthirty-one years was seldom free from public duties, mostly special and\r\nlocal. The number of offices he served in succession was remarkably\r\nlarge. He was assistant to the registrar of the Sudder Court at\r\nCalcutta; assistant to the British resident at Hyderabad;\r\nassistant-secretary in the revenue and judicial department at Calcutta;\r\nsecretary to the Board of Revenue in the Lower Provinces; private\r\nsecretary to Governor-general Lord Auckland; British resident in Nepaul;\r\ncommissioner of the Tenasserim provinces; judge of the Sudder Court; and\r\nlastly, lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces—ruler over a\r\nterritory containing as many inhabitants as the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. All these offices he filled in succession, and the\r\nfirst eight qualified him for the onerous duties of the ninth and last.\r\nThroughout the mutiny, the only point on which Mr Colvin differed from\r\nViscount Canning was in the policy of the proclamation issued on the\r\n25th of May. It was at the time, and will ever remain, a point fairly\r\nopen to discussion, whether Colvin’s proclamation[108] was or was not\r\ntoo lenient towards the rebellious sepoys. If Canning’s decision partook\r\nmore of that of John Lawrence, it is equally certain that Colvin’s views\r\nwere pretty nearly shared by Henry Lawrence, in the early stages of the\r\nmutiny. Irrespective of this question of the proclamation, Colvin’s\r\nposition at Agra was one of painful difficulty. He was not so successful\r\nas Sir John Lawrence in the Punjaub, and his name has not found a place\r\namong the great men whom the mutiny brought into notice; but it would be\r\nunfair to leave unnoticed the circumstances which paralysed the ruler of\r\nAgra. A distinguished civilian, who knew both Colvin and Lawrence, and\r\nwho has written under the assumed name of ‘Indophilus,’ thus compares\r\nthe position of the two men: ‘Colvin, with a higher official position,\r\nhad less real command over events than his neighbour in the Punjaub.\r\nJohn Lawrence ruled a people who had for generations cherished a\r\nreligious and political feud with the people of Hindostan Proper; and\r\nDelhi was, in Sikh estimation, the accursed city drunk with the blood of\r\nsaints and martyrs. John Colvin’s government was itself the focus of the\r\ninsurrection. Lawrence may be said to have been his own\r\ncommander-in-chief; and after a European force had been detached to\r\nDelhi immediately on the outbreak, he still had at his disposal seven\r\nEuropean regiments, including the one sent from Bombay to Moultan,\r\nbesides European artillery and a local Sikh force of about 20,000\r\nfirst-rate irregulars of all arms. Colvin was merely the civil governor\r\nof the Northwest Provinces; and as the posts (dâks) were stopped, he\r\ncould not even communicate with the commander-in-chief, with whom the\r\nentire disposal of the military force rested. Lawrence had three days’\r\nexclusive knowledge by telegraph of what had taken place at Meerut and\r\nDelhi, during which interval he made his arrangements for disarming the\r\nsepoy regiments stationed in the Punjaub. Colvin had no warning; and the\r\nmilitary insurrection had actually broken out within his government, and\r\nthe mutineers were in possession of Delhi, before he could begin to act;\r\nbut he promptly and vigorously did what was in his power.’ We have seen\r\nin former chapters what course Mr Colvin adopted between May and\r\nAugust.[109] He opened communications with the authorities all around\r\nhim, as soon as he knew that the mutiny had begun; he disarmed the 44th\r\nand 67th native infantry on the 1st of June; he raised a corps of\r\nvolunteer horse for service in the neighbourhood; he organised a\r\nfoot-militia among the civilians and traders, for the protection of the\r\ncity; and he kept a close watch on the proceedings of the Gwalior\r\nmutineers. In July occurred the mutiny of the troopers of the Kotah\r\nContingent; then the ill-managed battle outside Agra on the 5th; then\r\nthe shutting up of Mr Colvin and six thousand persons within the fort;\r\nand then the passing of two weary months, during which the\r\nlieutenant-governor was powerless through his inability to obtain trusty\r\ntroops from any quarter whatever. His health and spirits failed, and he\r\ndied on the 9th of September—still hemmed within the walls of the fort\r\nat Agra. Mr Reade, the leading civilian, assumed authority until orders\r\ncould be received from Calcutta; Colonel Frazer afterwards received the\r\nappointment—not of lieutenant-governor of the Northwest Provinces, for\r\nthat government had by this time disappeared under the force of the\r\nmutiny—but of chief-commissioner at Agra. Viscount Canning, in a\r\ngovernment order, gracefully and properly acknowledged the merits of Mr\r\nColvin.[110]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Camp within the Fort, Agra.—From a Photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Europeans resident in Agra, after Mr Colvin’s decease, were still\r\nunable to liberate themselves; for Delhi had not yet fallen, nor had\r\nEnglish prestige been yet restored by Havelock’s success at Lucknow. The\r\nEnglish officers felt their enforced idleness very irksome. They, like\r\nall the other Europeans, were confined within the fort; no daring\r\nmilitary exploits could be looked forward to hopefully, because there\r\nware scarcely any troops to command. For three months the Gwalior\r\nmutineers had been their _bête noir_, their object of apprehension, as\r\nbeing powerful and not far distant. They occasionally heard news from\r\nGwalior, but of too uncertain a nature to satisfy their doubts. Early in\r\nSeptember one of the officers wrote: ‘A portion of the rebel army of\r\nGwalior has marched; but their intentions are not yet known. They still\r\nsay they are coming to turn us out of the fort, and perform all sorts of\r\ngallant deeds. Had they come at first, they would have given us a good\r\ndeal of trouble, as we were not prepared for a siege—guns not mounted,\r\nmagazines not shell-proof, provisions not in sufficient quantity, and\r\n(worst of all) two thousand women and children without any protection\r\nfrom the enemy’s fire. All this is now being rapidly remedied, and now\r\nwe could stand a siege with comfort. One of the greatest wants is that\r\nof tobacco; the soldiers have none; and few men know so well as they do\r\nthe comfort of a pipe after a hard day’s work, whether under a broiling\r\nsun or in drenching rain.’ The British officers at Agra were embittered\r\nby becoming acquainted with the fact, that many influential natives now\r\nin rebellion were among those who made the most fervent demonstrations\r\nof loyalty when the mutiny first began.\r\n\r\nOf the affairs of Delhi we shall speak presently. Meanwhile, it may be\r\nwell to describe the movements of a distinct corps, having its origin in\r\nthe capture of that city. Although General Wilson seized all the gates\r\nand buildings of the imperial city one by one, he could not prevent the\r\nescape of the mutineers from the southern gate, the opposite to that\r\nwhere the siege-works had been carried on. By the 21st of September,\r\nwhen the conquest was completed, large bodies of the rebels were far\r\naway, on their march to other scenes of struggle. The chief body marched\r\ndown the right bank of the Jumna on the Muttra road, with the intention\r\nof crossing over into the Doab. Brigadier Showers was sent with a force\r\nto pursue another body of rebels in another direction; but the\r\noperations now under notice were those of the column under Colonel E. H.\r\nGreathed (of H.M. 8th foot), organised at Delhi on the 23d of\r\nSeptember—about 3000 strong.[111] Starting on the 24th, Greathed crossed\r\nthe Jumna, and marched towards Bolundshuhur. Here a body of fugitive\r\nmutineers was encountered on the 28th. A sharp action ensued, which\r\nended in the flight of the enemy, leaving behind them two guns and much\r\nammunition. As a consequence of this defeat, a newly set-up rajah, one\r\nWaladad Khan, abandoned the fort of Malagurh, and fled. It was in the\r\nblowing-up of this fort, by order of the colonel, that Lieutenant Home,\r\nwho had so distinguished himself at the storming of the Cashmere Gate,\r\nwas killed. One of his brother-officers said in a letter: ‘The loss of\r\npoor Home has thrown a cloud over all our successes. He was brave among\r\nbrave men, and an honour to our service.’ Greathed advanced day after\r\nday, burning villages which were known to have been nests of insurgents.\r\nIn one of those places, Koorjah, he found the skeleton of a European\r\nwoman, the head cut off, and the legs hacked and cut. On the 5th of\r\nOctober, the column reached Allygurh, scoured through the town, and cut\r\nup a large body of rebels, taking eleven guns from them. Greathed was at\r\nAkerabad the next day, where Mungal Singh and his brother had raised the\r\nstandard of rebellion; but these chieftains were killed, as well as most\r\nof their retainers. On the 9th, he reached Hattrass. At this place his\r\nmovements were suddenly disturbed; he had intended to march down the\r\nDoab to aid Havelock, Outram, and Inglis; but now news from Agra reached\r\nhim that led to a change of plan. To understand this, attention must be\r\nturned to the state of affairs in the Mahratta dominions of Scindia, the\r\nnorthern boundary of which approached very near Agra.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when Scindia’s Gwalior Contingent rose in mutiny against\r\nBritish authority, on the 14th of June, nothing but the personal\r\nfaithfulness of Scindia himself prevented the mutineers from joining\r\ntheir compatriots at Delhi or elsewhere. Every British officer being\r\ndriven away from Gwalior, the powerful army forming the Contingent might\r\neasily have made itself master of all that part of the Mahratta\r\ndominions; but Scindia, by a remarkable exercise of steadiness and\r\nshrewdness, kept them near him. He would not make himself personally an\r\nenemy to them; neither, on the other hand, would he express approval of\r\ntheir act of mutiny. He still remained their paymaster, and held his\r\npower over them partly by keeping their pay in arrear. All through the\r\nmonths of July and August did this singular state of affairs continue. A\r\nfew detachments of the Contingent had marched off from other stations,\r\nbut the main body remained quiet. The Indore mutineers from Holkar’s\r\nContingent had for some time been encamped near them at Gwalior, much\r\nagainst Scindia’s inclination. Early in September the two bodies\r\ndisagreed concerning future plans—the Indore men wishing to speed to\r\nDelhi, the Gwalior men to Cawnpore. Some of the maharajah’s own troops,\r\ndistinct from the Contingent, were seduced from their allegiance by the\r\nIndore men, and marched off with them on the 5th, with seven guns and a\r\ngood store of ammunition. Some of the budmashes or vagabonds of Gwalior\r\njoined them; but the Gwalior Contingent proper still remained quiet near\r\nthat city. This quietness, however, did not promise to be of long\r\ncontinuance. On the 7th, the native officers went to Scindia, and\r\ndemanded from him food and conveyance for a march either to Agra or to\r\nCawnpore. The maharajah’s response not being satisfactory to them, they\r\nbegan to seize oxen, buffaloes, mules, horses, camels, and carts from\r\nthe neighbouring villagers, and a few elephants from the richer men.\r\nSome violence against Scindia himself appeared probable; but he found\r\nthe main body of his own little army disposed to remain faithful, and\r\nhence the Contingent had little inducement to attack him. The landowners\r\nin the neighbourhood offered to aid him with their retainers, thus\r\nlessening the danger to which he might otherwise have been exposed.\r\nAbout the middle of the month a fierce struggle seemed imminent; but\r\nScindia and his supporters continued firm, and the Contingent did not\r\nfor some time attempt any manœuvre likely to be serious to the British.\r\nWe can therefore follow the steps of the other army of mischief-workers.\r\n\r\nWhen the miscellaneous body of Indore mutineers, Gwalior traitors, and\r\nbudmashes left Gwalior, they proceeded towards the river Chumbul, which\r\nthey crossed on the 7th of September, and then took possession of the\r\nfort of Dholpore, a place about thirty miles from Agra—at the point\r\nwhere the trunk-road from Delhi to Bombay crosses the Chumbul, and\r\ntherefore a very important spot in relation to any arrival of\r\nreinforcements for the British. In that very week the final bombardment\r\nof Delhi began; and if the mutineers had marched thither, they might\r\nseriously have embarrassed General Wilson’s operations. They appear,\r\nhowever, to have remained near Dholpore, supporting and strengthening\r\nthemselves by plunder in the neighbouring region. When Delhi fell, and\r\nits defenders escaped, the Dholpore mutineers—as we may now conveniently\r\ncall them—had no motive for marching towards the imperial city; but,\r\nnear the close of the month, they began to lay plans for an attack on\r\nAgra.\r\n\r\nWhen October arrived, Mr Reade, and Colonels Cotton and Frazer, had to\r\ndirect their attention not only to these Dholpore mutineers, but to\r\ndangerous neighbours from other quarters. A glance at a map will shew\r\nthat when mutineers and marauders escaped from Delhi towards the Lower\r\nGanges, Agra would necessarily be not far from the line of route. When,\r\ntherefore, the authorities at the last-named city heard of the fall of\r\nDelhi, they naturally looked with some anxiety to the course pursued by\r\nthe fugitives. They speedily heard that a crowd of mutineers, fanatics,\r\nfelons, and miscreants of every description, had found their way to\r\nMuttra, and were engaged in constructing a bridge of boats over the\r\nJumna; in order, as appeared probable, to open a communication with the\r\nIndore or Dholpore mutineers. Hence the extreme anxiety of the Agra\r\nauthorities that Greathed’s column, in pursuit of the fugitive rebels,\r\nshould march down the right instead of the left bank of the Jumna, in\r\norder to aid Agra, and cut off the communication with Dholpore; and\r\nhence great disappointment, when it was found that the active leader of\r\nthat column was marching rapidly on towards Cawnpore—without thinking of\r\nAgra. At such a time, each officer naturally thought first and\r\nprincipally of the safety of the city or station for which he was\r\nresponsible; and the commanders of movable columns were often\r\nembarrassed by conflicting requisitions from different quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LIEUTENANT HOME, Bengal Engineers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of feeling in Agra at the end of September. Early in\r\nOctober, matters became more serious. The authorities received news that\r\nan attack on Agra was meditated by the rebels—comprising the 23d B. N.\r\nI. and the 1st B. N. C. of the Indore Contingent, from Mhow; a part of\r\nthe fugitive forces from Delhi; and malcontents from Dholpore and the\r\nneighbourhood. Means were immediately sought for frustrating this\r\nattack. The rebels were known to be on the advance on the 6th; it was\r\nalso known that on that day Colonel Greathed had arrived with his column\r\nat Akrabad, one day’s march from Allygurh, on his way towards Cawnpore.\r\nIt was thereupon resolved to obtain the aid of Greathed at Agra, before\r\nhe further prosecuted his march. This energetic officer, who was rapidly\r\nfollowing up a fugitive brigade from Delhi, very unwillingly postponed\r\nan object on which he had set his heart; but the danger to Agra becoming\r\nvery imminent, he turned aside to lend his aid at that point. After\r\nmarching forty-four miles in twenty-eight hours—a tremendous achievement\r\nin an Indian climate—Greathed arrived at the parade-ground of Agra on\r\nthe morning of the 10th of October. Before his tired troops could enjoy\r\neven three hours’ rest, they found themselves engaged in battle with the\r\nenemy, who suddenly attacked their camp. The rebels made a spirited dash\r\nwith their cavalry, and opened a brisk fire with artillery half hidden\r\nbehind luxuriant standing corn. Not a moment did Greathed delay. He\r\nmoved to the right with a view of outflanking the enemy and capturing\r\ntheir guns on that side; and his arrangements in other quarters soon\r\nenabled him to charge and capture the enemy’s guns and standards. On\r\nthey went, the mutineers retreating and Greathed following them up,\r\nuntil he reached a village three miles out on the Gwalior road. Here\r\nColonel Cotton came up, and assumed the command; the infantry drove the\r\nrebels to the five-mile point, and the cavalry and artillery continued\r\nthe pursuit; until at length the enemy were utterly routed. They lost\r\ntwelve guns, and the whole of their tents, baggage, ammunition, and\r\nvehicles of every description. It was a complete discomfiture. Colonel\r\nGreathed obtained, and deservedly, high praise for the celerity and\r\nenergy of his movements. By the time the battle and pursuit were over,\r\nhis cavalry had marched sixty-four and his infantry fifty-four miles in\r\nthirty-six hours; while Captain Bourchier’s 9-pounder battery had come\r\nin from Hattrass, thirty miles distant, during the night without a halt.\r\nGreathed’s loss in the action was 11 killed and 56 wounded. It was a\r\nstrange time for the mutineers to make an attack on Agra. During the\r\nsiege of Delhi, Wilson could not have spared a single regiment from his\r\nsiege-camp, nor could any other general have brought resources to bear\r\non the relief of Agra; whereas now, in this second week of October,\r\nGreathed with a strong column was within two days’ march of the city. If\r\nthey were not aware of this fact, then was their information less\r\ncomplete than usual; if they hoped to check his advance down the Doab,\r\nthen did they wofully underrate his strength and gallantry.\r\n\r\nWhile tracing briefly the progress of the movable column after this\r\nbattle of Agra, it may be well to advert to a source of vexation that\r\nsometimes presented itself during the wars of the mutiny, at Agra as\r\nelsewhere. Many of the gallant men concerned in struggling against the\r\nmutineers were occasionally much perplexed by questions of seniority, at\r\ntimes and places when they could refer for solution neither to the\r\ngovernor-general nor to the commander-in-chief. Such was the case in\r\nreference to Greathed’s column. General Gowan in Sirhind, General Penny\r\nat Delhi, the chief-commissioner at Agra, all had some authority in\r\nmilitary matters in the Northwest Provinces. Colonel Cotton, at Agra,\r\nfinished the battle which Greathed began—not because it had been badly\r\nfought, but because Cotton was senior to Greathed. Again, while Greathed\r\nwas marching quickly and fighting valiantly on the road to Cawnpore,\r\nafter the battle of Agra, Colonel Hope Grant of the 9th Lancers, made\r\nbrigadier in order that he might assume higher command, was sent out\r\nfrom Delhi viâ Agra to supersede him—not because he was a better officer\r\nthan Greathed, but because he was senior in rank. Grant joined the\r\ncolumn on the 19th of October, and became its leader. The change caused\r\na busy paper-war between the generals and commissioners who had made the\r\nrespective appointments, and who could not, at such a troubled time,\r\nrightly measure the relative strength of their own claims to authority.\r\nWhether under Hope Grant, however, or under Greathed, the column was in\r\ngood hands. On the 19th, the column marched twenty-four miles, and\r\nentered Minpooree. A native rajah had long ruled that place during the\r\nanarchy of the provinces; but no sooner did he hear of the approach of\r\nthe British than he fled—leaving behind him several guns, 14,000 pounds\r\nof powder, 230,000 rupees, and much other property, which had been taken\r\nfrom the Company’s officers when the mutiny began. There was no\r\nfighting, only a re-occupation. After another severe punishment of the\r\nrebels at Kanouge on the 23d, the column marched towards Cawnpore, which\r\nwas reached on the 26th.\r\n\r\nReturning to the affairs of the various Mahratta states, it may now be\r\nmentioned that the Gwalior Contingent did at last, in the month of\r\nOctober, make a move. They marched slowly and heavily (six regiments,\r\nfour batteries, and a siege-train), leaving Gwalior on the 15th, and\r\nadvancing eastward towards Jaloun and Calpee, as if with the intention\r\nof crossing the Jumna at the last-named place into the Doab; but the\r\nmonth came to an end without any serious demonstration on their part.\r\nHad Nena Sahib been as bold and skilful as he was vicious, he might have\r\nwrought great mischief to the English at this time. If he had placed\r\nhimself at the head of the Gwalior Contingent (which was fully\r\nexpected), and had marched with them southward through Bundelcund to the\r\nSaugor and Nerbudda territories, he would have picked up rebellious\r\nBundelas at every village, and have advanced towards the Nerbudda in\r\nsuch strength as to render it very doubtful whether the available Madras\r\nand Bombay troops could have confronted him. He had ambition enough to\r\nplace himself at the head of all the Mahratta princes, but neither skill\r\nnor courage for such a position. So far as concerns Agra, the residents\r\ncontinued in the fort, in no great danger, but too weak in military to\r\nengage in any extensive operations. The only contest, indeed, during the\r\nrest of the month was on the 28th, when a party from the fort sallied\r\nout, and dispersed a body of rebels assembled at Futtehpore Sikri.\r\n\r\nThe wide region comprised within the political limits of the Mahratta\r\nand Rajpootana states was in a very disturbed condition during September\r\nand October. Besides the Gwalior Contingent in Scindia’s dominions,\r\nthere were Holkar’s Contingent, the Bhopal and Kotah Contingents, the\r\nJhodpore legion, and other bodies of native troops, the partial mutiny\r\nof which kept the country in perpetual agitation. All Bengal troops were\r\nsources of mischief, for they were the very elements among which the\r\ndisaffection grew up; European troops could be sent neither from\r\nCalcutta nor the Punjaub; and therefore it depended either on Bombay or\r\nMadras (chiefly the former) to send troops by whom the insurgents could\r\nbe put down. These troops, for reasons already sufficiently explained,\r\nwere few in number; and it was a work of great difficulty to transfer\r\nthem from place to place where anarchy most prevailed; indeed, the\r\ncommanding officers were often distracted by appeals to them from\r\nvarious quarters for aid—appeals incompatible one with another.\r\n\r\nColonel Lawrence had a contest with the mutineers of the Jhodpore\r\nlegion, about the middle of September, in Rajpootana. He marched to and\r\nthrough various places, the names of which have hardly been heard of in\r\nEngland, such as Beaur, Chiliamas, Barr, Peeplia, Bugree, Chaputtia, and\r\nAwah; these movements took place between the 14th and the 18th of the\r\nmonth; and on the last-named date he encountered the rebels at Awah. He\r\nhad with him 200 of H.M. 83d foot, 250 Mhairwara battalion, two\r\nsquadrons of Bombay native cavalry, and 5 guns. It was an artillery\r\nattack on both sides, lasting three hours. Lawrence seems to have\r\ndistrusted his own strength; he would not bring his infantry and cavalry\r\ninto action, fearful of losing any of his men just at that place and\r\ntime. In short, his attack failed; the rebels retained hold of Awah, and\r\nLawrence, finding his supplies running short, retired to Beaur. The\r\nrebels had the guns of the legion with them, and worked them well. It\r\nwas an untoward affair; for the Rajah of Jhodpore, friendly to the\r\nEnglish, had just before met with a defeat of his own troops by the same\r\nlegion, in an action which involved the death of Captain Monck Mason,\r\nthe British resident; and now prestige was still further damaged by the\r\nretreat of Lawrence after a desultory action. The colonel had come with\r\na small Bombay column to Ajmeer, to watch the movements of rebels in and\r\nnear Ajmeer, Nuseerabad, Awah, and other places in that part of\r\nRajpootana; and any discomfiture at such a time was likely to afford a\r\nbad example. At Kotali, Neemuch, Mundisore, Mehidpore, Indore, Mhow,\r\nBhopal, &c., an uneasy feeling similarly prevailed, arising out of\r\ndisturbances too small to be separately noticed here, but important as\r\nindicating a wide belt of disaffected country between the Jumna and the\r\nBombay presidency. The strange character of the whole of that region, in\r\na political sense, was well expressed by an English officer, who,\r\nwriting from Neemuch, said: ‘This station is in the heart of Rajpootana,\r\na country abounding in and surrounded by native states which compose\r\nanything but one family, and between any two of which it is very\r\ndifficult to determine at any given time what relation exists. There are\r\nHolkar’s troops, and Scindia’s troops, and Salomba’s troops, and the\r\nmercenary troops of Odeypore, the Kotah Contingent, the Jeypoor,\r\nJhodpore, Meywar, and Malwar corps, and a host more; and when any little\r\ndispute arises in the country, a sort of jumble takes place between\r\nthese bodies, during which two of them at least are pretty sure to come\r\ninto collision.’ These petty quarrels among the chieftains were\r\nsometimes advantageous to the British; but the soldiery were so strongly\r\naffected with mutinous tendencies, that a friendly rajah could seldom\r\ngive practical value to his friendliness.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to notice in detail the petty military operations of\r\nthat region. No great success attended any of them. One was at Nimbhera,\r\nor Nimbhaira, between Neemuch and Nuseerabad. Here a contest took place\r\non the 20th of September, in which a native rajah was worsted by Colonel\r\nJackson and 350 miscellaneous troops. Another occurred some weeks later,\r\nwhen the Mundisore insurgents, on the 22d of October, made an attack on\r\nJeerun, a town about ten miles from Neemuch. A force of about 400 men\r\nwas at once sent out from this station, chiefly Bombay native troops,\r\nbut headed by 50 of H.M. 83d foot, under Captains Simpson, Bannister,\r\nand Tucker. The enemy were found drawn up in force. Tucker brought two\r\nguns and a mortar to bear upon them, and sent his infantry to attack the\r\ntown; but the enemy checked them by overpowering numbers, and captured\r\nthe mortar. The cavalry now made an attack, followed by the infantry,\r\nand the mortar was speedily retaken. The enemy were driven into the\r\nfort, and their fire entirely silenced. The Neemuch force was not strong\r\nenough to take the fort at that time, but the insurgents evacuated it\r\nduring the night, and marched off. The encounter was rather severe to\r\nthe British officers engaged; for two of them (Captains Tucker and Read)\r\nwere killed, and five wounded. The miscreants cut off Captain Tucker’s\r\nhead as soon as he had fallen.\r\n\r\nOne of the most pathetic stories of that period had relation, not to a\r\nbattle or a wholesale slaughter, but to the assassination of a father\r\nand two sons under very cowardly and inexplicable circumstances. Major\r\nBurton was British political agent at Kotah, a Rajpootana state of which\r\nthe chief town lies northeast of Neemuch—a situation he had filled for\r\nthirteen years, always on friendly terms with the native rajah and the\r\npeople generally. He had been four months at Neemuch, but returned to\r\nKotah on the 12th of October, accompanied by two sons scarcely arrived\r\nat manhood. On the 15th, two regiments of the rajah’s native army\r\nrevolted, and surrounded the Residency in which Major Burton and his\r\nsons had just taken up their abode. What followed may best be told in\r\nthe words of a third son, Mr C. W. Burton, of Neemuch.[112]\r\n\r\nLet us on to Delhi, and watch how the imperial city fared after the\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the conquest had been completely effected, on the 21st of\r\nSeptember,[113] it became necessary to make arrangements for the\r\ninternal government of the city, irrespective of any more permanent or\r\nimportant appointments. Colonel Burn was made military governor. This\r\nofficer had been thirty years in the Company’s service—first in the\r\nBengal native infantry; then in raising three native regiments on the\r\nAfghan frontier; next in the operations of the Afghan war; then in those\r\nof the Sikh war; afterwards as secretary to the commissioners of the\r\nPunjaub; and, lastly, as an officer in Nicholson’s movable column.\r\nColonel Burn being made military governor of Delhi, Colonel Innes\r\nreceived the appointment of commandant of the palace. Mr Hervey Harris\r\nGreathed, who had been appointed civil commissioner for Delhi as soon as\r\nthe murder of Mr Simon Fraser on the 11th of May became known, lived\r\nthrough all the vicissitudes of the siege, but sank through illness\r\nalmost as soon as the victorious army entered the imperial city; he was\r\nsucceeded in his office by Mr Saunders. Another change may here be\r\nmentioned. General Wilson, worn out by his anxieties and labours in the\r\nsiege-camp, retired two or three weeks after the conquest, for the\r\nrecovery of his health in the hill-country, and was succeeded in the\r\nsupreme command at Delhi by General Penny—subject to any more\r\nauthoritative change by order of the Calcutta government.\r\n\r\nWithin, the city of Delhi was a very desolation. Nearly all the native\r\ninhabitants left it, in dread lest the English soldiers should retaliate\r\nupon them the atrocities perpetrated by the insurgents upon defenceless\r\nEuropeans. The authorities had no wish for the immediate return of these\r\npeople, until it could be ascertained to what extent the traders and\r\nworking population had connived at the rebellion of the sepoys. Even\r\nmany weeks after all fighting had ceased in and near the city, one of\r\nthe officers wrote of the state of Delhi in the following terms: ‘Every\r\nwall or bastion that faced our camp is in almost shapeless ruin; but the\r\nwhite marble pavilions of the palace rise unharmed along the Jumna’s\r\nbank. In one of these live the.... There is no describing the beauty and\r\nquaintness of their rooms. I long for photographs to send home. They are\r\nall of inlaid marble, with semianahs pitched in the zenana courts\r\nbetween. But all around speaks of awful war—the rows on rows of captured\r\nguns—the groups of English soldiers at every post; and not English only,\r\nfor our brave defenders the Goorkhas, Sikhs, and Punjaubees mingle among\r\nthem. A strange army indeed, with not a trace of pipeclay! It is a\r\nfrightful drive from the palace to the Cashmere Gate—every house rent,\r\nriven, and tottering; the church battered, and piles of rubbish on every\r\nside. Alas! the burnt European houses and deserted shops! Desolate\r\nDelhi! and yet we are told it is clearing and much improved since the\r\nstorming of the place. It has only as yet a handful of inhabitants in\r\nits great street, the Chandnee Chowk, who are all Hindoos, I believe.\r\nMany miserable wretches prowl through the camps outside the city begging\r\nfor admission at the various gates; but none are admitted whose\r\nrespectability cannot be vouched for. Cart-loads of ball are being daily\r\ndug out from the Moree Bastion, now a shapeless, battered mass.’\r\n\r\nThe conquerors of Delhi, wishing to prevent for ever the imperial city\r\nfrom becoming a stronghold for rebels, proposed to destroy at once all\r\nthe fortifications. The Calcutta government, on receiving news of the\r\nfinal capture, telegraphed to General Wilson to the following effect:\r\n‘The governor-general in council desires that you will at once proceed\r\nto demolish the defences of Delhi. You will spare places of worship,\r\ntombs, and all ancient buildings of interest. You will blow up, or\r\notherwise destroy all fortifications; and you will so far destroy the\r\nwalls and gates of the city as to make them useless for defence. As you\r\nwill not be able to do this completely with the force at present\r\navailable at Delhi, you will select the points at which the work may be\r\ncommenced with the best effect, and operate there.’ After General Wilson\r\nhad retired, and General Penny had assumed command at Delhi, information\r\nreached Sir John Lawrence at Lahore of the intended demolition. He\r\nevidently did not approve of the plan in its totality, and suggested\r\ndelay even in commencing it, until further orders could be received from\r\nCalcutta. He thus telegraphed to Delhi on the 21st of October: ‘I do not\r\nthink any danger could arise from delay. If the fortifications be\r\ndismantled, I would suggest that it be done as was the case at Lahore;\r\nwe filled in the ditches by cutting down the glacis, lowered the walls,\r\nand dismantled the covering-works in front of the gates and bastions. A\r\nwall of ten or twelve feet high could do no harm, and would be very\r\nuseful for police purposes. Delhi, without any walls, would be exposed\r\nto constant depredations from the Meeras, Goojurs, and other predatory\r\nraces. Even such a partial demolition will cost several lacs of rupees\r\nand take a long time; at Lahore it cost two lacs, and occupied upwards\r\nof two years.’\r\n\r\nOne subject connected with the capture of Delhi was curiously\r\nillustrative of the state of the public mind as exhibited during the\r\nautumn of 1857. Anything less than a sanguinary retaliation for the\r\natrocities committed by the natives in India was in many quarters\r\nregarded almost as a treasonable shrinking from justice. Kill, kill,\r\nkill all—was the injunction implied, if not expressed. Among the British\r\nresidents in India this desire for blood was so strong, that it\r\ndistempered the judgment of persons otherwise amiable and generous.\r\nInstead of acting on the principle that it is better for a few guilty to\r\nescape than for one innocent man to be punished, the doctrine\r\nextensively taught at that time reversed this rule of conduct. It is of\r\ncourse not difficult to account for this. The feelings of those who, a\r\nfew short months before, had been peacefully engaged in the usual\r\nAnglo-Indian mode of life, were suddenly rent by a terrible calamity.\r\nHusbands, brothers, sons—wives, sisters, daughters—were not only put to\r\ndeath unjustly, but the black deed was accompanied by brutalities that\r\nstruck horror into the hearts of all survivors. It was not at such a\r\ntime that men could judge calmly. The subject is mentioned here because\r\nit points to one of the difficulties, almost without parallel in\r\nintensity, that pressed upon the nobleman whose fate it was to govern\r\nIndia at such a time. Every proclamation or dispatch, issued by Viscount\r\nCanning, which contained instructions to the Company’s officers tending\r\nto leniency towards any of the dark skins, was misquoted,\r\nmisrepresented, violently condemned, and attributed to what in bitter\r\nscorn was called the ‘clemency of Canning.’ It required great moral\r\ncourage, at such a time, to form a definite plan of action, and to\r\nmaintain it in spite of clamour. Differences of opinion on these\r\ndifficult matters of state policy are of course reasonable enough; the\r\npoint is mentioned here only in its historical relation to an almost\r\nfrenzied state of public opinion at a particular time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COLONEL BURN, Military Governor of Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the King of Delhi was one of the subjects connected\r\nwith this state of feeling. When taken a prisoner, the dethroned monarch\r\nwas not shot. ‘Why is this?’ it was asked. Because Captain Hodson\r\npromised the king his life if he would surrender quietly. For a long\r\ntime this gallant officer was an object of violent abuse for this line\r\nof conduct. ‘Why did Hodson dare to do this?’ was the inquiry. It was\r\nnot until evidence clear and decisive had been afforded, of General\r\nWilson’s sanction having been given to this proceeding, that the subject\r\nfell into its proper place as one open to fair and temperate discussion.\r\nAgain, letters written anonymously at Delhi appeared in the Calcutta\r\nnewspapers, announcing that the ex-royal family were treated with the\r\nmost obsequious deference; and the ‘clemency’ was again contrasted with\r\nthe ‘righteous demand for blood.’ So much of this as was untrue\r\ngradually fell out of repute; and then the simple fact became known that\r\nthe king was to be tried as a traitor, but was not to be treated as a\r\nfelon until found guilty. Mrs Hodson, wife to the officer who effected\r\nthe capture, paid a visit to the royal captives, which she described in\r\na highly interesting letter to an English relation, afterwards made\r\npublic; whatever else it shewed, it afforded no indication that the aged\r\nprofligate was treated with a degree of luxurious attention offensive to\r\nthe European residents of the place.[114]\r\n\r\nFor all else, Delhi furnished nothing calling for special notice during\r\nthe six weeks following the siege.\r\n\r\nOf two columns, despatched from Delhi to pursue and punish the rebels\r\nafter the siege, that under Colonel Greathed has already been noticed. A\r\nsecond, under Brigadier Showers, was engaged throughout October, mostly\r\nwest and northwest of Delhi. Some of the petty rajahs between the Jumna\r\nand the Sutlej were in an embarrassing position; they would have drawn\r\ndown on their heads eventual defeat by the British if they joined the\r\nrebels; while they were in immediate danger from the enmity of marauders\r\nand mutineers if they remained faithful to the British. To their credit\r\nbe it said, most of them remained true to their treaties; they assisted\r\nthe British in a time of trouble to the extent of their means.\r\nEspecially was this the case in relation to the Rajahs of Jheend and\r\nPutialah, without whose friendly aid it would have scarcely been\r\npossible for Sir John Lawrence to send reinforcements from the Punjaub\r\nto General Wilson at Delhi. An exception was afforded by the Rajah of\r\nJhujjur, whose treacherous conduct earned for him a severe defeat by\r\nBrigadier Showers about the middle of October. That officer was, later\r\nin the month, actively engaged in defeating and punishing rebels at\r\nSonah, Bullubgurh, and other places.\r\n\r\nOf the country north and northeast of Delhi, little need be said.\r\nRohilcund was almost wholly in the hands of the rebels during September\r\nand October. In the districts of Bareilly, Boodayoun, Mooradabad,\r\nShahjehanpoor, and Bijnour, the English might be reckoned by tens—so\r\nfierce had been the tempest which had swept them away. Happily Nynee Tal\r\nstill remained a refuge for many non-combatants, who could not yet be\r\nsafely removed to Calcutta or Bombay. Khan Bahadoor Khan—a notorious\r\noffender whose name has more than once been mentioned in these pages,\r\nand who, after being a well-paid deputy-collector in the Company’s\r\nservice, shewed his gratitude by committing great atrocities as\r\nself-elected Nawab of Bareilly—planned an attack on Nynee Tal about the\r\nmiddle of September. He sent a force of 800 men, under his nephew, Nizam\r\nUllie Khan. Major Ramsey, however, speedily mustered 300 Goorkhas, and\r\nabout 50 miscellaneous volunteers and troopers; this force, sallying\r\nforth from Nynee Tal on the 18th, encountered the Bareilly rebels at\r\nHuldwanee, near the foot of the hills, and gave so effective a defeat to\r\nthem as to prevent any repetition of the attack for a very long time.\r\n\r\nAll around the district of Meerut the movements of the rebels were\r\nsensibly checked by the fact that that important military station still\r\nremained in the hands of the British. After the first day of outbreak\r\n(10th of May), Meerut was provisioned and intrenched in such a way as to\r\nrender it safe from all attacks, especially as the garrison had a good\r\nstore of artillery; and as small bands of trusty troops could\r\noccasionally be spared for temporary expeditions, the mutineers were\r\nkept from any very near approach to Meerut itself. The chief annoyance\r\nwas from the Goojurs and other predatory tribes, who sought to reap a\r\ngolden harvest from the social anarchy around them.\r\n\r\nHappily, the extreme northwest remained nearly at peace. The Punjaub,\r\nunder the firm control of Sir John Lawrence, although occasionally\r\ndisturbed by temporary acts of lawlessness, was in general tranquil. A\r\nfew English troops ascended from Kurachee by way of the Indus and\r\nMoultan; and a few native regiments came from Bombay and Sinde; but the\r\nSikhs and Mussulmans of the Punjaub itself were found to be for the most\r\npart reliable, under the able hands of Cotton and Edwardes. In Sinde a\r\nsimilar state of affairs was exhibited: a few isolated acts of\r\nrebellion, sufficient to set the authorities on the alert without\r\nseriously disquieting them. On one occasion a company of native\r\nartillery was disarmed at Hydrabad, on suspicion of being tainted with\r\ndisloyalty. On another occasion the 21st native infantry was disarmed at\r\nKurachee, because twenty or thirty of the men displayed bad symptoms.\r\nAnd on another, a few men of the 16th native infantry were detected in\r\nan attempt to excite their companions to mutiny. All these instances\r\ntended to shew, that if Sinde had been nearer to Hindostan or Oude, the\r\nBengal portion of the army there stationed would in all probability have\r\nrevolted; but being in a remote region, and among a people who had few\r\nsympathies with Brahmin sepoys, the incendiarism died out for lack of\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nHappily, again, the southern or peninsular portion of India was left\r\nnearly free from the curse of rebellion during the two months now under\r\nnotice in Mysore, in the various provinces of the Madras presidency, in\r\nthe South Mahratta country, and in the provinces around Bombay, the\r\ndisturbances were few. In the Deccan, the Nizam and his prime minister\r\nremained stanch throughout; and although the city of Hyderabad was kept\r\nin much commotion by fanatical moulvies and fakeers, and by turbulent\r\nRohillas and Deccanees, there was no actual mutiny of entire regiments,\r\nor successful scheme of rebellion. At Ahmedabad, midway between Bombay\r\nand the disturbed region of Rajpootana, one of those terrible events\r\noccurred on the 26th of October—a blowing away of five men from guns.\r\nAll the officers whose duty it was to attend on those fearful occasions\r\nunited in hoping that such a sight might never again meet their eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ruins near Kootub Minar, Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  ‘I told off my men rapidly, and formed them into parties, so as\r\n  completely to surround and cover every outlet and corner. The main\r\n  party, consisting mostly of my own particular sharpshooters and\r\n  body-guard, watched the front; another moved towards the town, there\r\n  to arrest an educated Bengalee, agent to the conspirators; another to\r\n  the rear, to cut off escape towards the town; while my friend the\r\n  Political crept quietly past some outhouses with his police, and under\r\n  the palace walls awaited my signal for opening the ball.\r\n\r\n  ‘Before long the ominous barking of a disturbed cur in the direction\r\n  of the party sent after the prime-minister proclaimed that no time was\r\n  to be lost. Off I went towards the guard-shed in front of the palace,\r\n  my personal sharpshooters following at the double. The noise, of\r\n  course, awoke the sleeping guard, and as they started up from their\r\n  slumbers I caught one firmly by the throat; the little Goorkha next me\r\n  felled with a but-end blow another of them while they were getting to\r\n  arms, I having strictly forbidden my men to fire until obliged; the\r\n  remainder, as we rushed in, took to flight, and my eager party wished\r\n  to fire on them, which I prevented, not considering such valiant game\r\n  worth powder and shot. In the darkness and confusion, no means of\r\n  entrance could at once be found. My police guide, however, having been\r\n  often in the palace, knew every room in it, and, thrusting himself in\r\n  at a door, acted ferret to perfection, and by dint of activity, soon\r\n  brought me into the presence of the rajah, who, though young in years,\r\n  is old in sin: he refused to surrender or admit any one—a resolution\r\n  which cooled instanter on my calling my men to set fire to the palace;\r\n  he then with a bad grace delivered up to me his state-sword. A shout\r\n  from the opposite doors proclaimed an entry there. The queen-mother\r\n  and the rest of the female royalty and attendants were seized while\r\n  trying to descend on that side. Then came a chorus of shouting and\r\n  struggling, and bawling for lights and assistance; at last, a lamp\r\n  being procured, we proceeded to examine the palace: we wandered in\r\n  dark passages and cells, while I mounted a guard at every door. The\r\n  air being confined and heated within the royal residence, I sat\r\n  outside until after daybreak, and then proceeded to rummage for papers\r\n  and letters; several boxes of these we appropriated, and counted out\r\n  his treasure, all in gold vessels and ingots; we found a quantity of\r\n  arms, spiked some guns, one of them of French make; all day we were\r\n  hard at work, searching and translating papers. The prime-minister was\r\n  found at his house, fast asleep. In the heat of the afternoon, we went\r\n  to his residence in the town, and by dint of keeping fans going over\r\n  us, carried out a thorough search. We did not get as many of his\r\n  papers as we wanted, he having been told by his correspondents to\r\n  destroy all letters after reading them.\r\n\r\n  ‘At sunset I carried off my prisoners over the same bad ground by\r\n  which we had so stealthily arrived. We were followed by about 2000\r\n  infuriated Mussulmans, crying, praying, and prostrating themselves to\r\n  the object of their lingering hope of rebellion (the rajah), but we\r\n  drove them off.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  ‘The ejected civilians from Dorunda had come on ahead and offered our\r\n  small party breakfast, which we gladly accepted. While waiting until\r\n  it was ready, the chief-commissioner got an electric-telegraph\r\n  dispatch from the governor-general, ordering the whole of the 53d\r\n  party under Major English back again to the main trunk-road. You never\r\n  saw anything like the long faces they all had at this announcement;\r\n  for the commissioner had just had intelligence on which he thought he\r\n  could rely, that the mutineers were still kept at bay by the party at\r\n  the pass, through which they must get through to effect their escape\r\n  from us; and they did not think that 250 Madras sepoys with two guns\r\n  would be sufficient to attack 850 desperate men caught in a trap.\r\n  Moreover, the retirement of the Europeans would run like wildfire\r\n  through the district; and I heard them all say they would not answer\r\n  for what might happen.’ The column _did_ advance to Dorunda, and\r\n  dispersed the miscreants; but it had to hasten to other regions, and\r\n  then—‘All the residents are very much disgusted at our going back, as\r\n  the moral effect of our arrival must be great, the natives here having\r\n  as much idea of a European soldier as they have of a whale, never\r\n  having seen either; and the fact of their being put as prisoners under\r\n  a European guard frightens them more than a thousand deaths.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n           Shut the mouth of slanderers, bite and\r\n           Eat up backbiters, trample down the sinners,\r\n           You, _Sutrsingharka_.\r\n           Kill the British, exterminate them,\r\n           _Mat Chundee_.\r\n           Let not the enemy escape, nor the offspring of such,\r\n           Oh, _Singharka_.\r\n           Shew favour to Shunker!\r\n           Support your slave!\r\n           Listen to the cry of religion,\r\n           _Mathalka_.\r\n           Eat up the unclean!\r\n           Make no delay!\r\n           Now devour them,\r\n           And that quickly,\r\n           _Ghormatkalka_.\r\n\r\n  The words in italics are various names of the goddess Devee or Deva,\r\n  ‘the destroyer.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  See p. 111.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Chap. vii., pp. 109-111.

In a second he was\r\n  cruelly undeceived. The mutineers rushed into the house; the servants,\r\n  both private and public, abandoned him with only one exception (a\r\n  camel-driver); and the agent, his boys, and this one solitary servant\r\n  fled to the top of the house for safety, snatching up such few arms as\r\n  were within their reach. The fiends pursued; but the cowardly ruffians\r\n  were driven back for the time by the youngest boy shooting one in the\r\n  thigh. When there, they naturally hoped the agency-servants or their\r\n  own would have returned with assistance from the chief; but no—all\r\n  fled, and no help came. In the meantime, the mutineers proceeded to\r\n  loot the house, and they (the major and his sons) saw from their\r\n  position all their property carried away. A little while and two guns\r\n  were brought to play upon the bungalow, the upper part of which caught\r\n  fire from the lighted sticks which the miscreants from time to time\r\n  threw up. Balls fell around them, the little room at the top fell in,\r\n  and they were yet unhurt—and this for five long and weary hours. Major\r\n  Burton wished to parley with the mutineers, in the hope they would be\r\n  contented if he gave himself up, and allow his boys to escape; but his\r\n  children would not allow of such a sacrifice for their sakes; and like\r\n  brave men and good Christians, they all knelt down and uttered their\r\n  last prayers to that God who will surely avenge their cause. All now\r\n  seemed comparatively quiet, and they began to hope the danger over,\r\n  and let down the one servant who was still with them on a mission to\r\n  the Sikh soldiers and others, who were placed by the chief for the\r\n  personal protection of the agent round his bungalow, and of whom at\r\n  the time there were not less than 140, to beg of them to loosen the\r\n  boat, that an escape might be attempted across the river. They said:\r\n  “We have had no orders.” At this moment a shot from a pistol was\r\n  fired. Scaling-ladders had been obtained, the murderers ascended the\r\n  walls, and the father and his sons were at one fell stroke\r\n  destroyed.... The maharajah was enabled to recover the bodies of the\r\n  agent and both his sons in the evening, and they were carefully buried\r\n  by his order. Dr Salder’s house was attacked at the same time with the\r\n  agency-house. He was cut down outside, in sight of the agent, as was\r\n  also Mr Saviell, the doctor of the dispensary in the city, and one or\r\n  two others whose names are not certain.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xviii., pp. 295-315.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  ‘There is a report, which has been mischievously set about, and may\r\n  have mischievous consequences—namely, that the king has the whole of\r\n  his retinue, and has returned to his own apartments in the palace.\r\n\r\n  ‘This is perfectly untrue. I went with Mr Saunders, the civil\r\n  commissioner, and his wife, to see the unfortunate and guilty wretch.\r\n  We mounted a flight of stone steps, at the bottom and top of which was\r\n  a European sentry.

In the other half was a native bedstead—that is, a frame of\r\n  bamboo on four legs, with grass-rope strung across it; on this was\r\n  lying and smoking a hookah an old man with a long white beard; no\r\n  other article of furniture whatever was in the room, and I am almost\r\n  ashamed to say that a feeling of pity mingled with my disgust at\r\n  seeing a man recently lord of an imperial city, almost unparalleled\r\n  for riches and magnificence, confined in a low, close, dirty room,\r\n  which the lowest slave of his household would scarcely have occupied,\r\n  in the very palace where he had reigned supreme, with power of life\r\n  and death, untrammelled by any law, within the precincts of a royal\r\n  residence as large as a considerable-sized town; streets, galleries,\r\n  towers, mosques, forts, and gardens, a private and a public hall of\r\n  justice, and innumerable courts, passages, and staircases. Its\r\n  magnificence can only be equalled by the atrocities which have been\r\n  committed there. But to go back to the degraded king. The boy, Jumma\r\n  Bukht, repeated my name after Mr Saunders. The old man raised his head\r\n  and looked at me, then muttered something I could not hear, and at the\r\n  moment the boy, who had been called from the opposite door, came and\r\n  told me that his mother, the begum, wished to see me. Mrs Saunders\r\n  then took possession of me, and we went on into a smaller, darker,\r\n  dirtier room than the first, in which were some eight or ten women\r\n  crowding round a common “charpoy” or couch, on which was a dark, fat,\r\n  shrewd, but sensual-looking woman, to whom my attention was\r\n  particularly drawn. She took hold of my hand—I shuddered a little—and\r\n  told me that my husband was a great warrior; but that if the king’s\r\n  life and her son’s had not been promised them by the government, the\r\n  king was preparing a great army which would have annihilated us. The\r\n  other women stood round in silence till her speech was finished, and\r\n  then crowded round, asking how many children I had, and if they were\r\n  all boys; examined my dress, and seemed particularly amused by my\r\n  bonnet and parasol. They were, with one exception, coarse, low-caste\r\n  women, as devoid of ornament as of beauty. Zeenat Mahal asked me—a\r\n  great honour, I found, which I did not appreciate—to sit down on her\r\n  bed; but I declined, as it looked so dirty. Mr Saunders was much\r\n  amused at my refusal, and told me it would have been more than my life\r\n  was worth six months before to have done so; and I have no doubt of\r\n  it.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Lucknow, from the Observatory.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n             THE RESCUE AT LUCKNOW, BY SIR COLIN CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little care is needed to avoid confusion in the use of the words\r\n‘siege,’ ‘defence,’ and ‘relief,’ relating to Lucknow—so peculiar and\r\ncomplicated were the military operations in and near that city during\r\nthe mutiny. In the first place, there was the defence of the Residency\r\nby Brigadier Inglis, during July, August, and September: the mutineers\r\nand rebels in the city itself being the besiegers. Secondly, in the\r\nclosing week of September, came the siege of Lucknow city by the British\r\nunder Havelock, Outram, and Neill: the rebels being the besieged, and\r\nInglis’s little band, still shut up within the Residency enclosure,\r\nbeing unable to take an active part in the operations. Next, for a\r\nfurther period of seven or eight weeks, a renewed defence of the British\r\nposition was maintained by Havelock, Outram, and Inglis—the mutineers\r\nand rebels being, as in the first instance, the besiegers. Then, in the\r\nthird week of November, occurred a siege of the city by Sir Colin\r\nCampbell: the mutineers and rebels being the defenders, and the British\r\ninmates of the Residency being enabled to aid the operations of the\r\ncommander-in-chief. After this, there was another defence of the Alum\r\nBagh against the rebels by Outram, and another siege of Lucknow by\r\nCampbell. It follows, therefore, that the ‘siege,’ the ‘defence,’ or the\r\n‘relief’ of Lucknow should not be mentioned without defining the period\r\nto which the expression refers.\r\n\r\nWith this explanatory remark, the scope of the present chapter may be\r\neasily shewn. In former pages[115] the eventful defence of the Residency\r\nat Lucknow from the beginning of July to near the close of September, by\r\nBrigadier Inglis, was described; together with the arrival of a small\r\narmy under Havelock and Outram, and the terrible conflict in the streets\r\nof the city. In the present chapter the sequel of the story will be\r\ngiven—shewing how it arose that Havelock and Outram could not escort the\r\nsuffering women and children, sick and wounded, from Lucknow to a place\r\nof safety; how they struggled on for eight weeks longer; what\r\npreparations Sir Colin Campbell made to collect an army of relief; how\r\nhe fought his way to Lucknow; and by what felicitous arrangements he\r\nsafely brought away those who, from sex, age, sickness, or wounds, were\r\nunable to defend themselves against a fierce and relentless enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of September, when a few hours’ sleep had closed the\r\nagitating proceedings of the previous day, it was found that the\r\n‘relief’ of Lucknow was a relief rather in name than in substance. Sir\r\nHenry Havelock surrendered the command which had been generously left in\r\nhis hands up to this time by a superior officer; Brigadier Inglis\r\nsurrendered the military control of the intrenched position, or rather\r\ncontinued to hold it under the supervision of another; while Sir James\r\nOutram, in virtue of an arrangement previously made, assumed the\r\nleadership of all the British forces, and the exercise of all British\r\npower, throughout Oude. At present, this leadership and power were of\r\nhumble dimensions, for he commanded very little more of the province\r\nthan the few acres at the Residency and the Alum Bagh. Of the gallant\r\ntroops, under 3000 in number, who, led by Havelock, Outram, and Neill,\r\nhad left Cawnpore on the 19th of September, nearly one-third were\r\nstricken down by the time the Residency was reached. The survivors were\r\ntoo few in number to form a safe escort for the women and children from\r\nLucknow to Cawnpore; the march would have been an awful one, marked by\r\nbloodshed at every step; the soldiers, distracted by the double duties\r\nof protectors and combatants, would have been too weak for either. They\r\nbrought muscle and sinew to aid in constructing countermines and\r\nbatteries; they enlarged the area of the intrenched or fortified\r\nposition—but they could not rescue those who had so long borne the\r\nwonderful siege.\r\n\r\nSome of the troops, in charge of guns, baggage, and baggage animals, had\r\ndefended a position outside the Residency enclosure during the night;\r\nand arrangements were now made to secure the new or enlarged\r\narea—including the Clock Tower, the Jail, a mosque, the Taree Kothee,\r\nthe Chuttur Munzil palace, the Fureed Buksh palace, the Pyne Bagh, and\r\nother buildings and gardens. It was not without severe fighting and much\r\nloss on the 26th that the wounded were placed in safety, the guns\r\nsecured, and the new position fortified. When these palaces, which had\r\nuntil now been respected, were conquered from the enemy, they were\r\nregarded as fair military spoil. The buildings formed a labyrinth of\r\ncourt-yards, inner gardens, balconies, gateways, passages, verandahs,\r\nrotundas, outhouses, and pavilions; and all became a scene of plunder.\r\n‘Everywhere,’ says Mr Rees, ‘might be seen people helping themselves to\r\nwhatever they pleased. Jewels, shawls, dresses, pieces of satin, silk,\r\nbroadcloths, coverings, rich embroidered velvet saddles for horses and\r\nelephants, the most magnificent divan carpets studded with pearls,\r\ndresses of cloth of gold, turbans of the most costly brocade, the finest\r\nmuslins, the most valuable swords and poniards, thousands of flint-guns,\r\ncaps, muskets, ammunition, cash, books, pictures, European clocks,\r\nEnglish clothes, full-dress officers’ uniforms, epaulettes,\r\naiguillettes, manuscripts, charms; vehicles of the most grotesque forms,\r\nshaped like fish, dragons, and sea-horses; imauns or representations of\r\nthe Prophet’s hands, cups, saucers, cooking-utensils, china-ware\r\nsufficient to set up fifty merchants in Lombard Street, scientific\r\ninstruments, ivory telescopes, pistols; and (what was better than all)\r\ntobacco, tea, rice, grain, spices, and vegetables.’ There is no proof\r\nthat much order was observed in the partition or distribution; every one\r\nappears to have helped himself to what he pleased; and many collected\r\nlarge stores of useful and ornamental articles which they afterwards\r\nsold at high prices. There was a good deal of luxurious living for the\r\nfirst few days, on the savoury provisions found in the palaces; and we\r\nmay in some degree imagine how this was enjoyed, after such sorry\r\nrations of chupatties, stewed peas, and morsels of tough gun-bullock\r\nbeef. There was, perhaps, something undignified in all this scrambling\r\nspoliation that jars with one’s notions of heroism and exalted courage;\r\nbut military men are accustomed to overlook it in the moment of victory.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir James Outram clearly ascertained that the rebels and mutineers,\r\ninstead of escaping from the city, were closing in more and more\r\nresolutely, he saw that no departure would be practicable either for\r\nofficers or men, military or civilians, women or children. He\r\nendeavoured to open negotiations with Maun Singh, a powerful thalookdar\r\nor landowner;[116] to win him over to the side of the British, and\r\nthereby lessen the difficulties of the position; but the wily Oudian,\r\nbalancing the relative advantages of loyalty and rebellion, gave\r\nspecious answers on which no dependence could be placed. It became\r\nnecessary to prepare for a new defence against a new siege. All the old\r\n‘garrisons’ were strengthened, and new ones formed; all the guns and\r\nmortars were placed in effective positions, and all the soldiers told\r\noff to regular duties. As Outram and Havelock had brought scarcely any\r\nprovisions with them into the Residency; and as those found in the\r\npalaces were articles of luxury rather than of solid food, a very\r\ncareful commissariat adjustment became necessary—it being now evident\r\nthat the daily rations must of necessity be small in quantity and coarse\r\nin quality. The enemy renewed their old system of firing, day after day,\r\ninto the British position; they broke down the bridges over canals and\r\nsmall streams between the Residency and the Alum Bagh; and they\r\ncaptured, or sought to capture, every one who attempted to leave the\r\nintrenchment. On the other hand, the British made frequent sorties, to\r\ncapture guns, blow up buildings, and dislodge parties of the enemy. Six\r\ndays after the entry of Outram and Havelock, a soldier was found under\r\ncircumstances not a little strange. Some of the garrison having sallied\r\nforth to capture two guns on the Cawnpore road, a private of the Madras\r\nEuropeans was discovered in a dry well, where the poor fellow had been\r\nhiding several days. He had fortunately some tea-leaves and biscuits in\r\nhis pockets, on which he had managed to support life; he had heard the\r\nenemy all round him, but had not dared to utter a sound. The well\r\ncontained the dead body of a native sepoy; and the atmosphere hence\r\nbecame so pestilential and frightful that the poor European was wont to\r\ncreep out at night to breathe a little fresh air. Great was his joy when\r\nat length he heard friendly voices; he shouted loudly for help, in spite\r\nof his exhausted state, and was barely saved from being shot by his\r\ncountrymen as a rebel, so black and filthy was his appearance.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of October did this state of affairs in Lucknow\r\ncontinue. Outram had brought his guns into the intrenchment by clearing\r\na passage for them through the palaces; he had destroyed Phillips’ or\r\nPhilip’s Battery, with which the enemy had been accustomed greatly to\r\nannoy the garrison; he had blown up and cleared away a mass of buildings\r\non the Cawnpore road; he had strengthened all the points of the position\r\nheld by himself and Havelock; but still he could neither send aid to the\r\nAlum Bagh, nor receive aid from it. He could do nothing but maintain his\r\nposition, until Sir Colin Campbell should be able to advance from\r\nCawnpore with a new army. A few messages, in spite of the enemy’s\r\nvigilance, were sent and received. Outram was glad to learn that a\r\nconvoy of provisions had reached the Alum Bagh from Cawnpore, and that\r\nGreathed was marching down the Doab with a column from Delhi. As for\r\nLucknow itself, matters remained much as before—sorties, firing, blowing\r\nup, &c.; but it must at the same time be admitted that Outram was more\r\nfavourably placed in this respect than Inglis had been; his fighting-men\r\nwere three or four times as numerous, and were thus enabled to guard all\r\nthe posts with an amount of labour less terribly exhausting. Danger was,\r\nof course, not over; cannon-balls and bullets still did their work. The\r\nauthoress of the _Lady’s Diary_ on one day recorded: ‘An 18-pounder came\r\nthrough our unfortunate room; it broke the panel of the door, and\r\nknocked the whole of the barricade down, upsetting everything. My\r\ndressing-table was sent flying through the door, and if the shot had\r\ncome a little earlier, my head would have gone with it. The box where E.\r\nusually sits to nurse baby was smashed flat.’ Breakfasts of chupatties\r\nand boiled peas were now seldom relieved by better fare; many a diner\r\nrose from his meal nearly as hungry as when he sat down. Personal attire\r\nwas becoming more and more threadbare. Poor Captain Fulton’s very old\r\nflannel-shirt, time-worn and soiled, sold by auction for forty-five\r\nrupees—four pounds ten shillings sterling.\r\n\r\nLittle news could be obtained from the city itself, beyond the limits of\r\nthe British position; but that little tended to shew that the rebels had\r\nset up a natural son of the deposed king as ‘Padishah’ of Oude, as a\r\nsort of tributary prince to the King of Delhi. Being a child only eight\r\nor ten years old, the real power was vested in a minister and a council\r\nof state. The minister was one Shirreff-u-Dowlah; the commander-in-chief\r\nwas Hissamut-u-Dowlah; the council of state was formed of the late\r\nking’s principal servants, the chieftains and thalookdars of Oude, and\r\nthe self-elected leaders of the rebel sepoys; while the army was\r\nofficered in the orthodox manner by generals, brigadiers, colonels,\r\nmajors, captains, subalterns, &c. There was a strange sort of democracy\r\nunderlying the despotism; for the sepoys elected their officers, and the\r\nofficers their commander; and as those who built up felt that they had\r\nthe right to pull down, the tenure of office was very precarious. The\r\nmongrel government at Lucknow was thus formed of three elements—regal,\r\naristocratic, and military, each trusting the other two only so far as\r\nself-interest seemed to warrant. The worst news received was that a\r\nsmall body of Europeans, including Sir Mountstuart Jackson and his\r\nsister, fugitives from Seetapoor, were in the hands of the rebels, in\r\none of the palaces in Lucknow, and that a terrible fate impended over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Residency and its Defences, Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNovember began with very low resources, but with raised hopes; for it\r\nwas known that the commander-in-chief was busily making arrangements for\r\na final relief of the garrison. Brigadier—or, as his well-earned\r\ninitials of K.C.B. now entitled him to be called, Sir John—Inglis\r\nremained in command of the old or Residency intrenchment; Sir Henry\r\nHavelock took charge of the new or palatial position; while Sir James\r\nOutram commanded the whole. Labour being abundant, great improvements\r\nwere made in all parts; sanitary plans were carried out, and hospitals\r\nmade more comfortable; overcrowded buildings were eased by the occupancy\r\nof other places; cool weather brought increase of health; and\r\nimprovements were visible in every particular except two—food and\r\nraiment. On the 9th of the month, Mr Cavanagh, who in more peaceful\r\ntimes had been an ‘uncovenanted servant’ of the Company, or clerk to a\r\ncivil officer in Lucknow, made a journey on foot to a point far beyond\r\nthe Alum Bagh under most adventurous circumstances,[117] to communicate\r\nin person full details of what was passing within the Residency, to\r\nconcert plans in anticipation of the arrival of Sir Colin, and perhaps\r\nto act as a guide through the labyrinthine streets of the city. As an\r\nimmediate consequence of this expedition, a system of semaphore\r\ntelegraphy was established from the one post to the other, by which it\r\nwas speedily known that Mr Cavanagh had succeeded in his bold attempt,\r\nand that Sir Colin arrived at the Alum Bagh on the 11th. Arrangements\r\nwere now at once made to aid the advance of the commander-in-chief as\r\neffectively as possible. Day after day Havelock sent out strong parties\r\nto clear some of the streets and buildings in the southeastern half of\r\nthe city—blowing up batteries and houses, and dislodging the enemy, in\r\norder to lessen the amount of resistance which Sir Colin would\r\ninevitably encounter.[118]\r\n\r\nAll this time, while the British in Lucknow were stoutly maintaining\r\ntheir ground against the enemy, some of their companions-in-arms—near at\r\nhand, but as inaccessible as if fifty miles distant—had their own\r\ntroubles to bear. The position of the small detachment at the Alum Bagh\r\nwas as trying as it was unexpected. When Havelock left a few hundred\r\nsoldiers at that post, with four guns, vehicles, animals, baggage,\r\nammunition stores, camp-followers, sick, and wounded, he never for an\r\ninstant supposed that he would be cut off from them, and that the\r\nResidency and the Alum Bagh would be the objects of two separate and\r\ndistinct sieges. Such, however, was the case. Not a soldier could go\r\nfrom the one place to the other; and it was with the utmost difficulty\r\nthat a messenger could convey a small note rolled up in a quill. The\r\nplace, however, was tolerably well armed and fortified; and as the enemy\r\ndid not swarm in any great numbers between it and Cawnpore,\r\nreinforcements were gradually able to reach the Alum Bagh, although they\r\ncould not push on through the remaining four miles to the Residency. On\r\nthe 3d of October, a convoy of 300 men of the 64th regiment, with\r\nprovisions, under Major Bingham, started from Cawnpore, and safely\r\nreached the Alum Bagh; he could not penetrate further, but the supplies\r\nthus obtained at the Alum Bagh itself were very valuable. On the 14th, a\r\nsecond convoy, under Major M’Intyre of the 78th Highlanders, was\r\ndespatched; but he was attacked by the enemy in such force, that he\r\ncould not reach the Alum Bagh; he returned, and had some difficulty in\r\npreventing the supplies from falling into the hands of the enemy.\r\nAnother attempt afterwards succeeded. Colonel Wilson, commanding at\r\nCawnpore, received the small detachments of British troops sent up from\r\ntime to time from the lower provinces, as well as the supplies coming in\r\nfrom every quarter. His duty was, not to make conquests, but to send men\r\nand provisions to the Alum Bagh or the Residency as often as any\r\nopportunity occurred for so doing, he knew that the Alum Bagh batteries\r\ncommanded all the approaches, and that the ground was cleared and\r\nexposed for five hundred yards on all sides; he did not therefore\r\napprehend any serious calamity to the miscellaneous force shut up in\r\nthat place, provided he could send provisions in good time. The three or\r\nfour miles from the Alum Bagh to the Residency were, it is true, beset\r\nby difficulties of a most formidable character; bridges were broken, and\r\nlines of intrenchment formed, while mutineers and rebels occupied the\r\ndistrict in great force; but they directed their attention rather to the\r\nResidency than to the Alum Bagh, thereby leaving the latter\r\ncomparatively unmolested. Much sickness arose within the place, owing to\r\nthe deficiency of space and of fresh air; and in the intervals between\r\nthe arrivals of the convoys, provisions were scanty, and the distress\r\nwas considerable. Nevertheless, the occupants of the Alum Bagh, with\r\nsuch men as Havelock and Inglis near them, never for an instant thought\r\nof succumbing; they would fight and endure till aid arrived.\r\n\r\nHaving thus watched the proceedings of the beleaguered garrisons at the\r\nResidency and the Alum Bagh, we may now trace the footsteps of Sir Colin\r\nCampbell, in his operations for their relief.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief, as has already been stated, remained at Calcutta\r\nmany weeks after his arrival in India. He was called upon to remodel the\r\nwhole military machinery, and to arrange with the governor-general the\r\nsystem of strategy which would be most desirable under the actual state\r\nof affairs. He watched with intense interest the progress of events on\r\nthe banks of the Jumna and the Ganges. He gave due praise to Wilson for\r\nthe conquest of Delhi, and to Greathed for the conquering march through\r\nthe Doab. He admired, as a soldier might well admire, the struggles of\r\nHavelock’s gallant little army ere Outram had joined him; the combined\r\noperations of Havelock and Outram; and the wonderful defence made by\r\nInglis against a host of opponents. He sent up from Calcutta, as soon as\r\nthey arrived, reinforcements for the lamentably small British army; and\r\nhe sent orders for brigading and marshalling, at Allahabad and at\r\nCawnpore, such troops as could arrive from Calcutta on the one hand, and\r\nfrom Delhi on the other. At last, he himself departed from Calcutta on\r\nthe 28th of October, travelling like a courier, narrowly escaping\r\ncapture by rebels on the way, and arriving at Cawnpore on the 3d of\r\nNovember—utterly heedless of the glitter and trappings that usually\r\nsurround a commander-in-chief in India.\r\n\r\nBy what steps the various regiments reached Cawnpore, need not be traced\r\nin detail. As fast as they arrived, so did some degree of tranquillity\r\nsucceed to anarchy. A portion of railway had for some weeks been\r\nfinished from Allahabad to Lohunda, forty-two miles towards Futtehpoor,\r\nbut had been stopped in its working by the mutiny; arrangements were now\r\nmade, however, for bringing it into use, and for finishing the section\r\nbetween Lohunda and Futtehpoor. The English regiments, from China and\r\nelsewhere, went up from Calcutta by road or river, in the modes so often\r\ndescribed; and were engaged in occasional skirmishes on the way, at\r\ntimes and places which have in like manner been mentioned. Benares was\r\nthe converging point for the road and river routes; from thence the\r\ntroops went up by Mirzapore to Allahabad; thence to Lohunda by rail;\r\nand, lastly, to Futtehpoor and Cawnpore by road-march or\r\nbullock-vehicles. A column under Colonel Berkeley was on its way;\r\nanother under Colonel Hinde was in or near Rewah; another under Colonel\r\nLongden was near Jounpoor; while Colonel Wroughton, with the Goorkhas\r\nfurnished by Jung Bahadoor, was on the Goruckpore frontier of Oude.\r\nTrue, some of these so-called columns were scarcely equal to one\r\nregiment in strength; but each formed a nucleus around which other\r\ntroops might accumulate. Greathed’s column, now better known as Hope\r\nGrant’s, was the main element in Sir Colin’s present force. It crossed\r\nthe Ganges from Cawnpore into Oude on the 30th of October, about 3500\r\nstrong, with 18 guns, and advanced without opposition towards the Alum\r\nBagh, near which it encamped, and awaited the arrival of the\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nA little may usefully be said here concerning the proceedings of the\r\nnaval brigade, already noticed as having been placed under the command\r\nof Captain Peel, and as having arrived safely at Allahabad after a very\r\nwearisome voyage up the Ganges. On the 4th of October Sir Colin\r\nCampbell, then at Calcutta, telegraphed to Peel: ‘In the course of about\r\na week there will be a continuous stream of troops, at the rate of about\r\nninety a day, passing into Allahabad, which I trust will not cease for\r\nthe next three months.’ Captain Peel was employed during October in\r\nfacilitating the passage of troops and artillery up to Cawnpore. On the\r\n20th Lieutenant Vaughan joined him, bringing 126 more naval officers and\r\nseamen, which raised the strength of the naval brigade to 516. Most of\r\nthese new arrivals were sailors of the merchant service at Calcutta, who\r\nhad agreed with much alacrity to join the brigade. On the 23d he sent\r\noff 100 seamen to Cawnpore, in charge of four siege train 24-pounders.\r\nOn the 27th he despatched 170 more, in charge of four 24-pounders and\r\ntwo 8-inch howitzers; and on the same day a military escort was provided\r\nfor a large amount of ammunition. Next, Captain Peel himself started for\r\nCawnpore; and was soon afterwards joined on the road by Colonel Powell\r\nwith the head-quarters of H.M. 53d regiment. Rather unexpectedly, a\r\nbattle took place on the way. While at Thurea, on the 31st, news reached\r\nthem that the Dinapoor mutineers, with three guns, had crossed the\r\nJumna, and were about either to attack Futtehpoor, or to march towards\r\nOude. Powell and Peel had with them troops and sailors numbering\r\naltogether about 700, in charge of a large and valuable convoy of siege\r\nand other stores: They marched that same evening to the camping-ground\r\nof Futtehpoor, where they were joined by some of the 93d Highlanders;\r\nand on the morning of the 1st of November a column of about 500 men\r\nmarched twenty-four miles to Kudjna. The enemy were here found, with\r\ntheir guns commanding the road, their right occupying a high embankment,\r\nscreened by a grove, and their left on the other side of the road. A\r\npart of the column advanced against the guns, while the rest rendered\r\nsupport on either side. A sharp battle of two hours’ duration ensued,\r\nduring which the enemy kept up so severe a fire of musketry that many of\r\nthe English fell, including Colonel Powell, who received a musket-ball\r\nin the forehead. Captain Peel, although a sailor, then took the command;\r\nhe carried a force round the upper end of the embankment, divided the\r\nenemy, and drove them from all their positions, capturing their camp and\r\ntwo of their tumbrils. His men were so worn out by 72 miles of marching\r\nin three days, that he could not organise a pursuit. Collecting his dead\r\nand wounded, which amounted in number to no less than 95, he marched\r\nback to Binkee; and after a little rest, the column, minus those who\r\nfell in this battle, continued the march towards Cawnpore. It was\r\nsupposed the enemy numbered not fewer than 4000 men, of whom one half\r\nwere mutinous sepoys from the Bengal army, and the other half rebels\r\nwhom they had picked up on the way. After leaving some of his men at\r\nCawnpore, to serve as artillerymen, Peel advanced with his heavy guns,\r\nand about 250 sailors, towards the Alum Bagh.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding, then, that regiments and detachments of various kinds\r\nwere working their way, at the close of October and early in November,\r\ntowards Cawnpore, and across the Ganges into Oude, we may resume our\r\nnotice of Sir Colin Campbell’s movements.\r\n\r\nRemaining at Cawnpore no longer than was necessary to organise his\r\nvarious military arrangements, the commander-in-chief crossed the Ganges\r\non the 9th of November, and joined Hope Grant’s column on the same day\r\nat camp Buntara, six miles short of the Alum Bagh. Wishing to have the\r\naid of other detachments which were then on the road, he remained at\r\nBuntara till the morning of the 12th, when he started with the force\r\nwhich he had collected with so much trouble.[119] Advancing towards the\r\nAlum Bagh, he defeated a party of the enemy in a skirmish at a small\r\nfort called Jellalabad, a little way to the right of the main road, and\r\nfive or six miles from the city. This fort being taken and blown up, Sir\r\nColin pushed on and encamped for the night outside the Alum Bagh.\r\nKnowing that Havelock and Outram two months before had suffered severely\r\nin cutting their way through the city, Campbell now formed a plan of\r\napproach at the extreme eastern or rather southeastern suburb, and of\r\nbattering down the enemy’s defences step by step, and day after day, so\r\nas to form a passage for his infantry with comparatively small loss.\r\nThis he had reason to hope; because there was a large open space at that\r\nend of the city, which—although containing many mosques, palaces, and\r\nother buildings—had few of those deep narrow lanes which had proved so\r\ndangerous to the former force. Hence the tactics of the next few days\r\nwere to consist of a series of partial sieges, each directed against a\r\nparticular stronghold, and each capture to form a base of operations for\r\nattacks on other posts nearer the heart of the city, until at length the\r\nResidency could be reached. The palaces, buildings, and gardens that\r\nwould be encountered in this route were the Dil Koosha palace and park,\r\nthe Martinière college, the Secunder Bagh, the Shah Nujeef, the palace\r\nMess-house, the Observatory, the Motee Mehal, the Keisah or Kaiser Bagh,\r\nand various palatial buildings, of which the names are not clearly\r\nrendered; until at length those posts would be reached (the Chuttur\r\nMunzil, the Pyne Bagh, the Fureed Buksh palace, the Clock Tower, and the\r\nTaree Kothee) which were held by Havelock, and lastly those (the\r\nResidency and the other buildings within Inglis’s original intrenchment)\r\nwhich were held by Outram.\r\n\r\nAfter changing the garrison at the Alum Bagh, giving a little rest to\r\ntroops who had recently had much heavy marching, and receiving an\r\naddition of about 650 men[120] from Cawnpore, Sir Colin commenced his\r\narduous operations on the morning of the 14th, with a miscellaneous\r\nforce of about 4000 men. As he approached the Dil Koosha park, the\r\nleading troops encountered a long line of musketry-fire; he quickly sent\r\nup reinforcements; and after a running-fight of about two hours, he\r\ndrove the enemy down the hill to the Martinière college, across the\r\ngarden and park of the Martinière, and far beyond the canal. This was\r\neffected without any great loss on either side. Campbell had now secured\r\nthe Dil Koosha (’Heart’s Delight’) and the Martinière (Martine’s college\r\nfor half-caste children). Hope Grant’s brigade, flanked by Bourchier’s\r\nfield-battery and Peel’s heavy guns, was brought to the side of the\r\ncanal (which enters the river Goomtee close to the Martinière), where\r\nthey effectually kept the enemy in check. When night came, Sir Colin\r\nfound he had made a good beginning; he had not only secured the\r\neasternmost buildings of Lucknow, but he had brought with him fourteen\r\ndays’ provisions for his own troops, and an equal proportion for those\r\nunder Outram and Havelock; he had also brought all his heavy baggage\r\n(except tents, left at the Alum Bagh), and was therefore prepared to\r\nmake a stand for several days at the Dil Koosha if necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter further completing his arrangements on the 15th, and exchanging\r\nmessages or signals with Havelock and Outram, the commander-in-chief\r\nresumed his operations on the 16th. Leaving every description of baggage\r\nat the Dil Koosha, and supplying every soldier’s haversack with three\r\ndays’ food, he crossed the canal and advanced to the Secunder Bagh—a\r\nhigh-walled enclosure of strong masonry, about a hundred and twenty\r\nyards square, loopholed on all sides for musketry, and held in great\r\nforce by the enemy. Opposite to it was a village at a distance of about\r\na hundred yards, also loopholed and guarded by musketeers. After a\r\ndetermined struggle of two hours, during which artillery and infantry\r\nwere brought to bear against them in considerable force, the enemy were\r\ndriven out of the Secunder Bagh, the village, and a range of barracks\r\nhard by—all of which speedily became valuable strongholds to the\r\nconquerors. Sir Colin described this as a very desperate encounter, no\r\nless than 2000 of the enemy having fallen, chiefly after the storming of\r\nthe Secunder Bagh itself by parties of the 53d and 93d regiments, aided\r\nby the 4th Punjaub infantry and a few miscellaneous troops. Indeed the\r\nenemy, well armed, crowded the Secunder Bagh in such numbers, that he\r\nsaid ‘there never was a bolder feat of arms’ than the storming. Captain\r\nPeel’s naval siege-train then went to the front, and advanced towards\r\nthe Shah Nujeef—a domed mosque with a garden, which had been converted\r\ninto a strong post by the enemy; the wall of the enclosure had been\r\nloopholed with great care; the entrance had been covered by a regular\r\nwork in masonry; and the top of the building had been crowned with a\r\nparapet. Peel was aided by a field-battery and some mortars; while the\r\nvillage to the left had been cleared of the enemy by Brigadier Hope and\r\nColonel Gordon. A heavy cannonade was maintained against the Shah Nujeef\r\nfor no less a space than three hours. The enemy defended the post very\r\nobstinately, keeping up an unceasing fire of musketry from the mosque\r\nand the defences in the garden. At last Sir Colin ordered the place to\r\nbe stormed, which was effected in an intrepid manner by the 93d\r\nHighlanders, a battalion of detachments, and the naval brigade. In his\r\ndispatch, the commander-in-chief said: ‘Captain Peel led up his heavy\r\nguns with extraordinary gallantry to within a few yards of the building,\r\nto batter the massive stone-walls. The withering fire of the Highlanders\r\neffectually covered the naval brigade from great loss; but it was an\r\naction almost unexampled in war. Captain Peel behaved very much as if he\r\nhad been laying the _Shannon_ alongside an enemy’s frigate.’\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Colin and his troops were thus engaged, Havelock contributed\r\ntowards the success of the general plan by the capture of a range of\r\nbuildings in advance of the palace of Fureed Buksh. It had been agreed\r\nby signal and secret message, that as soon as Sir Colin should reach the\r\nSecunder Bagh, the outer wall of the advance garden of the Fureed Buksh\r\n(Havelock’s most eastern post), in which the enemy had before made\r\nseveral breaches, should be blown in by mines previously prepared; that\r\ntwo powerful batteries erected in the enclosure should then open on the\r\ninsurgents in front; and that after the desired effect had been\r\nproduced, the troops should storm two buildings known as the Hern Khana\r\nor Deer-house and the Engine-house. This was successfully accomplished.\r\nAt about eleven o’clock, the operations began. The mines were exploded;\r\nthe wall was demolished; the works beyond were shelled by mortars; two\r\nof the mines at the Hern Khana were charged with destructive effect; and\r\nthe infantry—eager for a little active work after being many weeks pent\r\nup within their intrenchment—dashed through the Chuttur Munzil and\r\ncarried all before them, capturing the several buildings which had been\r\nmarked out by previous arrangement.\r\n\r\nThus ended the important operations of the 16th, sanguinary in Sir\r\nColin’s force, but much less so in that of Havelock—operations during\r\nwhich the Secunder Bagh, the Shah Nujeef, the Hern Khana, the\r\nEngine-house, and many minor buildings, were captured. On the 17th, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, after overcoming many obstacles, opened a\r\ncommunication between the canal and the left rear of a range of\r\nbarracks, that facilitated his subsequent proceedings. Captain Peel\r\nmeanwhile began to operate with his now famous naval brigade against a\r\nbuilding called in the maps the Mess-house—a large structure, defended\r\nby a ditch twelve feet broad, and scarped with masonry, and by a\r\nloopholed mud-wall beyond the ditch. As a part of Sir Colin’s general\r\nplan—that of employing artillery as much as possible, to save his\r\ninfantry—a cannonading was continued for several hours against this\r\nMess-house; and then it was stormed and taken without much difficulty by\r\nvarious detachments of the 53d, the 90th, the Punjaubees, and other\r\nregiments. This done, the troops pressed forward with great vigour, and\r\nlined a wall that separated the Mess-house from the Motee Mehal (’Pearl\r\nPalace’). This last-named place consisted of a wide enclosure containing\r\nmany buildings. Here the enemy determined to make one last desperate\r\nstand; they fought with energy and determination for an hour, but then\r\ngave way. Sir Colin’s troops broke an opening through the wall, aided by\r\nthe sappers, and then they poured through, rushing onward until they\r\nreached the part of the city which for seven or eight weeks had been in\r\nthe hands of Havelock. On the evening of this day the British found\r\nthemselves in possession of nearly the whole river-side of Lucknow from\r\nthe iron bridge to the Dil Koosha.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss here to mention that these operations during the\r\nsecond decade of November were conducted by the following officers: Sir\r\nColin Campbell commanded the whole. General Mansfield officiated as\r\nchief of the staff. Brigadier Hope Grant was in immediate command of the\r\ncolumn, formerly known as Greathed’s, which constituted the chief part\r\nof Sir Colin’s force. Colonel Greathed, now raised to brigadier-general\r\nas a mark of Sir Colin’s estimate of his services, commanded one of the\r\nbrigades of infantry. Brigadiers Russell and Adrian Hope took two other\r\ninfantry brigades. Brigadier Little commanded the cavalry, Brigadier\r\nCrauford the artillery, Lieutenant Lennox the engineers, and Captain\r\nPeel the naval brigade. The operations brought the honorary distinction\r\nof K.C.B. to Grant and Peel, who became Sir James Hope Grant and Sir\r\nWilliam Peel. Sir Colin’s advance to the Residency, however, with the\r\ncollateral struggles to which it gave rise, was severe in its results to\r\nhis force, though less so than the operations of Outram and Havelock in\r\nSeptember. He had to mourn the loss of 122 killed and 345 wounded. Out\r\nof this number there were 10 officers killed and 33 wounded. Sir Colin\r\nhimself received a slight wound, but not such as to check his activity\r\nfor an hour.[121] The loss of the enemy was frightfully severe; the\r\nexact amount was not known to the British, but it must have reached\r\nthree or four thousand. They fought at the Secunder Bagh and the Shah\r\nNujeef with a fierceness which rendered immense slaughter inevitable;\r\nfor Peel’s powerful artillery swept them down fearfully.\r\n\r\nWhether the transports of joy that animated the British in Lucknow on\r\nthe 17th of November were equal in intensity to those which had broken\r\nforth fifty-three days before, can never be exactly measured; men’s\r\nemotions are not susceptible of such nice estimate. Suffice it to say,\r\nthat as Inglis, on the 25th of September, had warmly grasped the hands\r\nof his deliverers Havelock and Outram; so did Outram, Havelock, and\r\nInglis now welcome with all fervour Sir Colin Campbell and those who\r\nwith him had just fought their way through the hostile streets of\r\nLucknow. Then, when a few hours had enabled the new-comers to spread\r\nforth some of the supplies which their commissariat had provided, and\r\nthe old inmates had done what little they could to render quiet eating\r\nand drinking possible—then were experienced once again the luxuries of\r\nwheaten bread, fresh butter, oranges, and other articles which are never\r\nluxuries save to those who have been long unable to obtain them. And\r\nthen the feast of letters and newspapers from England was scarcely less\r\ndelightful; for so close had been the investment of the Residency, that\r\nthe inmates had been practically shut out from the world during the\r\ngreater part of the summer and autumn.\r\n\r\nThe jubilation was, however, soon ended. Almost immediately on Sir\r\nColin’s arrival, an announcement was made that every European was to\r\nleave Lucknow and retire to Cawnpore. Many in the garrison had fondly\r\nhoped that the success of the commander-in-chief would have restored\r\nBritish control over the city; that comfort was about to succeed\r\ndiscomfort; that officers and civilians would resume their former duties\r\nunder their former easy conditions; and that the ladies and children\r\nmight rest a while in quiet, to recover health and strength before\r\nretiring to Calcutta or to the Hills. But such was not to be. Campbell\r\nhad come to Lucknow almost solely to liberate them; and his plan of\r\nstrategy—or, more probably, the number of available troops at his\r\ncommand—did not permit him to leave his small force in the Oudian\r\ncapital; for there was hot work to look forward to. The enemy,\r\nnotwithstanding their losses, still numbered fifty thousand fighting-men\r\nin and near Lucknow, shewing no symptoms of retreat, but rather a\r\ndetermination to defend the rest of the city street by street. To attack\r\nthem further would have been to sacrifice a force already much reduced,\r\nand to risk the necessity for a third relief. Sir Colin issued an order,\r\ntherefore, not only that all were to depart, but to depart quickly. The\r\nsick and wounded were to be removed directly from the Residency to the\r\nDil Koosha—a distance of four miles in a straight line, but five or six\r\nif it were necessary to take a circuitous route to avoid the enemy; the\r\nwomen and children were to follow the same route on the next day; and\r\nthe bulk of the soldiers were to depart when all else had been provided\r\nfor. An encampment was prepared in the Dil Koosha park, with such\r\nnecessaries and comforts as could be hastily brought together for sick,\r\nwounded, women, and children. The sojourn at the Dil Koosha was to be a\r\nbrief one, sufficient only for the organisation of a convoy to Cawnpore.\r\nOnly a small amount of personal baggage was allowed for each person; and\r\nthus those who possessed property were forced to leave most of it\r\nbehind. The property, it is true, was very scanty; but the garrison felt\r\nvexed at leaving even a trifle as a booty to the rebels. As the ordnance\r\nstores and the Company’s treasure (twenty-three lacs of rupees, safely\r\npreserved through all the trying scenes of half a year) were to be\r\nremoved to the Dil Koosha about the same time as the non-combatants, and\r\nas all this was to be effected without exciting the suspicions of the\r\nrebels, the utmost vigilance and caution were needed.\r\n\r\nThe exodus from the Residency, and the escape to the Dil Koosha, through\r\nnearly the whole length of the city of Lucknow, will never be forgotten\r\nby those who took part therein. Many delicate ladies, unprovided with\r\nvehicles or horses, had to walk over five or six miles of very rough\r\nground, exposed at one place to the fire of the enemy’s musketry. The\r\nauthoress of the _Lady’s Diary_, with two other ladies, secured a\r\ncarriage to convey them. ‘We had a pair of starved horses of Mr\r\nGubbins’s to drag us; but the wretched animals had been on siege-fare so\r\nlong that they had forgotten the use of their legs, and had no strength,\r\nso came to a stand-still every five minutes, invariably choosing the\r\nmost dangerous parts of the road for their halt. At one place we were\r\nunder so hot a fire that we got out and ran for our lives—leaving the\r\nvehicle to its fate; and two poor natives, who were helping to push it\r\non behind, were shot. At the Fureed Buksh we had to wait a long time, as\r\nthe carriage could not be got through a gateway till some stores were\r\ncleared away. Some of the officers of the 90th invited us inside, and\r\ngave us wine and water, which was very refreshing. We walked after that\r\nevery step of the way to Secunderabad [Secunder Bagh], where we all had\r\nto wait several hours till doolies arrived to take on all the women; and\r\nwe proceeded under a strong escort to Dil Koosha. The road to\r\nSecunderabad was frightfully dangerous in places. In one spot we were\r\npassing a 24-pounder manned by some sailors of the naval brigade; they\r\nall called out to us to bend low and run as fast as we could; we had\r\nhardly done so when a volley of grape whizzed over our heads and struck\r\na wall beyond. At Secunderabad we found the place overflowing with women\r\nand children of the Lucknow garrison.... At about nine o’clock P.M. we\r\nstarted again in doolies. The crowd and confusion were excessive, the\r\nenemy hovering round and firing occasional shots, and we were borne\r\nalong in the most solemn silence; the only sounds were the tramp, tramp,\r\ntramp of the doolie-bearers and the screaming of the jackals. It was an\r\nawful time; one felt as if one’s life hung in a balance, with the fate\r\nwe had so long dreaded; but our merciful Father, who has protected us\r\nthrough so many and great dangers, brought us in safety to Dil Koosha,\r\nwhere we arrived about two o’clock in the morning.’ They found shelter\r\nin the hastily prepared Dil Koosha encampment, already mentioned; and\r\nthen, for the first time during five months, they snatched a little\r\nsleep beyond the Residency intrenchment. Mrs (now Lady) Inglis behaved\r\non this occasion in a manner worthy of her name; a doolie or\r\nhospital-litter was prepared for her accommodation; but she refused it,\r\nin order that the sick and wounded might be better attended to. Mr Rees\r\ngives an extract from a letter of this lady, in which the incidents of\r\nthe day are narrated nearly in the same terms as by the chaplain’s wife;\r\nbut the following few additional facts may be given: ‘The road was quite\r\nsafe except in three places, where it was overlooked by the enemy’s\r\nposition, and where we had to run. One poor woman was wounded at one of\r\nthese places. We arrived at Secunder Bagh about six, and found every one\r\nassembled there, awaiting an escort and doolies to carry us on. When I\r\ntell you that upwards of two thousand men had been hastily buried there\r\nthe day before, you can fancy what a place it was.... We were regaled\r\nwith tea and plenty of milk, and bread and butter—luxuries we had not\r\nenjoyed since the commencement of our troubles. At ten o’clock we\r\nrecommenced our journey; most of the ladies were in palanquins, but we\r\nhad a covered-cart drawn by two obstinate bullocks. We had a force of\r\ninfantry and cavalry with us, but had not proceeded half a mile when the\r\ncolumn was halted, and an order sent back for reinforcements; some noise\r\nwas heard, and it was believed we might be attacked. However, it proved\r\na false alarm; and after two disagreeable and rather anxious hours, we\r\narrived safely at the Dil Koosha, and were quartered in tents pitched\r\nfor our reception.’ The charnel-house at the Secunder Bagh, mentioned in\r\nthis extract, was the place where most of the slaughter of the enemy had\r\noccurred, and where the dead bodies had been hastily interred; the\r\natmosphere around it was for many days in a frightful state.\r\n\r\nThe military movement in this evacuation of the Residency was spoken of\r\nby Sir Colin, in his official dispatch, as something masterly. He told\r\nhow Outram so planned that each corps and regiment, each detachment and\r\npicket, should be able to march out silently in the dead of the night,\r\nwithout exciting suspicion among the myriads of enemies near; and yet\r\nthat there should be guns and riflemen so posted as to repel the enemy\r\nif they should attempt any serious molestation of the retiring troops.\r\nIt must be remembered that Outran and Havelock’s gallant and\r\nmuch-enduring men had many things to effect after the non-combatants had\r\ndeparted from the Residency. They were called upon to bring away as many\r\nof the stores as could conveniently be conveyed, and to destroy those\r\nwhich, if left behind, would too much strengthen the enemy; they had to\r\nescort and protect their weaker companions, and to maintain a\r\nbombardment of the Kaiser Bagh and other posts, to deceive the enemy.\r\nThe last of the men came out as quietly and cautiously as possible, in\r\nthe dead of the night between the 22d and 23d of November, leaving\r\nlights burning, that the departure might not be suspected. They silently\r\npassed through the streets and roads, and safely reached the Dil Koosha.\r\nCaptain Waterman, through some misconception, was left behind, and found\r\nhimself, at two o’clock in the morning, the only living man in the\r\nintrenched position which had lately been so crowded. The situation was\r\na terrible one, surrounded as he was by fifty thousand vindictive armed\r\nenemies. In an agony of mind, he ran past the Taree Kothee, the Fureed\r\nBuksh, the Chuttur Munzil, the Motee Mehal, the Secunder Bagh, and the\r\nMartinière, to the Dil Koosha, which he reached in a state of mental and\r\nbodily prostration. Sir Colin was among the last to leave the place. So\r\ncleverly was the evacuation managed (without the loss of one man), that\r\nthe enemy continued to fire into the Residency enclosure long after the\r\nBritish had quitted it. What the scene was among the women and children,\r\nwe have just been informed; what it was among the soldiers, is well\r\ndescribed in a letter from one of the officers: ‘An anxious night indeed\r\nthat was! We left at twelve o’clock, having withdrawn all our guns from\r\nposition, so that if the scoundrels had only come on, we should have had\r\nto fight every inch of our way while retiring; but the hand of\r\nProvidence, which had watched the little garrison for so long a time,\r\nnever left it to the last. The eye of the wicked was blinded while we\r\nmarched breathlessly with beating hearts from our post, and, forming\r\ninto line, walked through the narrow defiles and trenches leading from\r\nthe ever-memorable Bailey guard. Out we went, while the enemy’s guns\r\nstill pounded the old wall, and while the bullets still whistled over\r\nthe buildings; and, after a six miles’ walk in ankle-deep sand, we were\r\nhalted in a field and told to make ourselves comfortable for the night.\r\nHere we were in a pretty plight. Nothing to cover ourselves, while the\r\ncold was intense; so we lay down like so many sheep huddled together to\r\nkeep ourselves warm, and so lay till the morning, when we rose stiff and\r\ncold, with a pretty prospect of the chance of finding our servants in a\r\ncamp of 9000 men.’\r\n\r\nThe world-renowned ‘Residency’ at Lucknow being thus abandoned, it may\r\nbe well to give in a note[122] Sir James Outram’s comments on the eight\r\nweeks’ defence of that place, as a sequel to Brigadier Inglis’s account\r\n(p. 336) of the previous three months’ defence before Outram arrived. To\r\nOutram was due the planning and execution of the strategical movement by\r\nwhich the evacuation of the Residency was accomplished. The\r\ncommander-in-chief, in a general order issued on the 23d, thus spoke of\r\nit: ‘The movement of retreat last night, by which the final rescue of\r\nthe garrison was effected, was a model of discipline and exactness. The\r\nconsequence was, that the enemy was completely deceived, and the force\r\nretired by a narrow, tortuous lane—the only line of retreat open—in the\r\nface of fifty thousand enemies, without molestation.’[123]\r\n\r\nGreat and universal was the grief throughout the camp when the rumour\r\nrapidly spread that Havelock, the gallant Christian soldier, was dead.\r\nHe shared the duties of Outram at the Dil Koosha on the 23d and 24th,\r\nbut died the next day, stricken down by dysentery, brought on by\r\nover-fatigue. All men talked of him as a religious as well as a brave\r\nman—as one, more than most men of his time, who resembled some of the\r\nPuritans of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A few words may\r\ngive the outline of his career. Henry Havelock was born near\r\nSunderland in 1795. He was educated at the Charterhouse, and then\r\nstudied for the bar for a short time; but afterwards adopted the\r\nmilitary profession, following the example of his elder brother\r\nWilliam. He entered the 95th regiment just after the battle of\r\nWaterloo, and during forty-two years saw a good deal of active\r\nservice. After serving eight years in the United Kingdom, he exchanged\r\ninto the 13th regiment, and went to India in 1823. He joined in the\r\nfirst Burmese war, of which he afterwards wrote and published a\r\nnarrative. He served in various capacities twenty-three years before\r\nhe became a captain, having no patronage in high places to facilitate\r\nhis advancement. Then he served in the Afghan campaign, of which he\r\nwrote a memoir; and took a leading part in the memorable defence of\r\nJelalabad. Rising gradually in office and in influence, he served in\r\nlater periods at Gwalior, Moodkee, Ferozshah, Sobraon, the Sutlej, and\r\nother scenes of battle. When the Persian war broke out at the close of\r\n1856, he was put in command of one division of the Anglo-Indian army;\r\nand when that war ended, he returned to India. What he achieved during\r\n1857 the foregoing pages have shewn. All classes in England mourned\r\nhis death. The Duke of Cambridge as commander-in-chief, Lords\r\nPalmerston and Panmure as ministers of the crown, the Earl of Derby as\r\nchief representative of the party at that time in opposition, the\r\nCourt of Directors, the Court of Proprietors, the corporation of\r\nLondon, public functionaries and municipal bodies, religious and\r\nmissionary societies—all sought to pay respect to the noble soldier\r\nwho was at once pious, daring, and skilful. His widow, made Lady\r\nHavelock in virtue of his knighthood, received a pension of £1000 a\r\nyear. His son received a baronetcy from the Queen, the rank of major\r\nfrom the commander-in-chief, and a pension of £1000 a year from the\r\nHouse of Commons. The public afterwards took up the subject of a\r\nmonument to the hero, and a provision for his daughters, as matters\r\nnot unworthy of support by voluntary efforts independent of the\r\ngovernment. With or without a monument, the name of Henry Havelock\r\nwill be held in grateful remembrance by the nation.\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell, like all around him, mourned the loss of his gallant\r\ncoadjutor; but his thoughts had no time to dwell on that topic. He had\r\nto think of the living, to plan the march from the Dil Koosha to the\r\nAlum Bagh, and thence onward to Cawnpore. Certain state-prisoners had to\r\nbe guarded, as well as the women and children, the sick and the wounded,\r\nthe treasure and the stores. The whole army was thrown into two\r\ndivisions: one under Brigadier Hope Grant, to form an escort from the\r\nDil Koosha to the Alum Bagh; the other, under Outram, to keep the enemy\r\nat bay until the convoy was safely on its road. It was on the 24th that\r\nthis novel and picturesque procession set out. The distance to the Alum\r\nBagh was about four miles; and over the whole length of very rough road\r\nwas a stream of bullock-carriages, palanquins, carts, camels, elephants,\r\nguns, ammunition and store wagons, soldiers, sailors (of the naval\r\nbrigade), sick, wounded, women, children, and prisoners. The delays were\r\ngreat, the stoppages many, the fatigue distressing, the dust annoying;\r\nand all gladly rested their weary limbs at the Alum Bagh when night\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nIt had been fully intended to afford the troops and their convoy several\r\ndays’ repose at the Alum Bagh; but on the 27th, Sir Colin was surprised\r\nto hear very heavy firing in the direction of Cawnpore. No news had\r\nreached him from that place for several days; therefore fearing some\r\ndisaster, he felt it necessary to push forward as quickly as possible.\r\nLeaving Outram in command of part of the force at the Alum Bagh, and\r\nplacing the rest under the immediate command of Hope Grant, he resumed\r\nhis march at nine o’clock on the morning of the 28th. Messages now\r\nreached him, telling of a reverse which General Windham had suffered at\r\nCawnpore, at the hands of the Gwalior mutineers. Sir Colin hastened\r\nforward, convoy and all; but he and a few officers took the start, and\r\ngalloped on to Cawnpore that same night. The nature of Windham’s\r\ndisaster will come for notice in the next chapter; here we have only to\r\nspeak of its immediate effect upon Sir Colin’s plans. The enormous train\r\nof helpless women, children, sick, and wounded, could cross the Ganges\r\nand quit Oude only by a bridge of boats; if that were broken, the result\r\nmight be tragical indeed. Orders were sent for the heavy guns to hurry\r\non, and to take up such a position as would prevent the enemy from\r\ndestroying or attacking the bridge; while a mixed force of infantry,\r\ncavalry, and horse-artillery was to cross quickly, and command the\r\nCawnpore end of the bridge. Happily all this was effected just in time.\r\nWhen the passage was rendered safe, the artillery, the remaining troops,\r\nand the non-combatants, were ordered to file over the bridge; this they\r\ndid, occupying the bridge in a continuous stream for _thirty\r\nhours_—unmolested, owing to Sir Colin’s prompt plans, by the enemy’s\r\nguns. All having safely crossed, the troops encamped around the ruinous\r\nold intrenchment rendered memorable by the gallant spirit and hapless\r\nfate of Sir Hugh Wheeler; while the women, children, sick, and wounded,\r\nwere put temporarily into occupation of the old foot-artillery lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fort of Alum Bagh, near Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough Sir Colin Campbell abandoned Lucknow for a while, he did not\r\nabandon the Alum Bagh. This post, a compact enclosure, capable of being\r\ndefended on all sides, would afford an important base for future\r\noperations if maintained. Taking Hope Grant’s division back with him to\r\nCawnpore, he left Outram with three to four thousand men to hold the\r\nAlum Bagh against all odds, furnishing him with as large a supply as\r\npossible of provisions and stores. This force consisted of all the\r\nremaining or available companies of H.M. 5th, 78th, 84th, and 90th foot,\r\nthe Madras Europeans, the Ferozpore Sikhs, three field-batteries, some\r\nheavy guns, two squadrons of the military train acting as dragoons, and\r\na body of irregular cavalry. While the enemy were busily engaged in\r\nrefortifying the city, so as to make it more formidable than ever, Sir\r\nJames was making the Alum Bagh proof against all their attacks. The\r\nposition thus occupied included not only the Alum Bagh itself, but a\r\nstanding camp about three-quarters of a mile distant, and the bridge of\r\nBunnee, which was separately held by 400 Madras sepoys and two guns.\r\n\r\nSerious work and anxious thoughts occupied the mind of the\r\ncommander-in-chief. He could do little in active military operations\r\nwhile so many helpless beings were depending on him for protection.\r\nHence the sojourn of those who, from sex, age, or sickness, could render\r\nno active service at Cawnpore, was rendered as brief as possible.\r\nVehicles, animals, provisions, and stores, were quickly collected; and\r\non the 3d of December the march was resumed towards Allahabad—under an\r\nescort of H.M. 34th foot, two guns, and some cavalry. How the released\r\nEuropeans fared on their journey; how they were cheered and greeted at\r\nAllahabad; how they felicitated themselves on once again sleeping in\r\nsafety; and how they ultimately reached Calcutta by steamers on the\r\nGanges—need not be told in detail. Let it suffice to say that when the\r\nladies and children, with the invalided officers, who had passed through\r\nso wonderful a series of events, were approaching Calcutta, Lord Canning\r\nissued a notification, in which he said: ‘No one will wish to obtrude\r\nupon those who are under bereavement or sickness any show of ceremony\r\nwhich shall impose fatigue or pain. The best welcome which can be\r\ntendered upon such an occasion is one which shall break in as little as\r\npossible upon privacy and rest. But the rescue of these sufferers is a\r\nvictory beyond all price; and in testimony of the public joy with which\r\nit is hailed, and of the admiration with which their heroic endurance\r\nand courage are viewed,’ it was ordered that a royal salute should be\r\nfired from the ramparts of Fort William as soon as the steamer arrived;\r\nthat all ships-of-war in the river should be dressed in honour of the\r\nday; that officers would be appointed to conduct the passengers on\r\nshore; and that the state-barges of the governor-general should be in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nThus ended a great achievement. The women, children, sick, and wounded,\r\nwho had to be brought away from the very heart of a city swarming with\r\ndeadly enemies, and escorted through a country beset by mutinous sepoys\r\nand rebellious chieftains, were not fewer than _two thousand_ in number.\r\nLet it be remembered, that while this helpless train of persons was on\r\nthe way through Oude, behind them was the enormous hostile force of\r\nLucknow, while in front of them were the Gwalior mutineers flushed by a\r\nrecent victory. That all should have passed through this perilous ordeal\r\nwith scarcely the loss of one life, reflects lasting credit on the\r\ngenerals who planned and executed the manœuvre. Of the five noble\r\nofficers whose names are imperishably connected with the extraordinary\r\nsieges and defences of Lucknow—Inglis, Havelock, Neill, Outram, and\r\nCampbell—two fell before the grateful thanks of their countrymen at home\r\ncould reach them; but the remaining three, when Christmas arrived, had\r\nthe infinite satisfaction of knowing that their arduous labours had been\r\nrewarded by the safe arrival, at or near Calcutta, of the tender and\r\nweakened, the broken-down and invalided—those who had so long formed the\r\nEuropean community in the Lucknow Residency.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Cavanagh’s Adventure._—At p. 362 it is mentioned that Mr Cavanagh,\r\n  an uncovenanted civil servant of the Company in the Residency at\r\n  Lucknow, volunteered to make the perilous journey from that post to\r\n  the commander-in-chief’s camp many miles beyond the Alum Bagh, in\r\n  order to establish more complete correspondence between Sir James\r\n  Outram and Sir Colin Campbell than was possible by the simple medium\r\n  of a small note enclosed in a quill. Mr Cavanagh’s account of his\r\n  hair-breadth run was afterwards published in the Blue-books; and as\r\n  it affords a good idea of the state of Lucknow and its environs at\r\n  the time, we will reprint it here:\r\n\r\n  ‘While passing through the intrenchment of Lucknow, about ten\r\n  o’clock A.M. on the 9th inst., I learned that a spy had come in from\r\n  Cawnpore, and that he was going back in the night as far as the Alum\r\n  Bagh with dispatches to his excellency, Sir Colin Campbell, the\r\n  commander-in-chief, who, it was said, was approaching Lucknow with\r\n  5000 or 6000 men.\r\n\r\n  ‘I sought out the spy, whose name is Kanoujee Lall, and who was in\r\n  the court of the deputy-commissioner of Duriabad before the outbreak\r\n  in Oude. He had taken letters from the intrenchment before, but I\r\n  had never seen him till now. I found him intelligent, and imparted\r\n  to him my desire to venture in disguise to the Alum Bagh in his\r\n  company. He hesitated a great deal at acting as my guide, but made\r\n  no attempt to exaggerate the dangers of the road. He merely urged\r\n  that there was more chance of detection by our going together, and\r\n  proposed that we should take different roads, and meet outside of\r\n  the city, to which I objected. I left him to transact some business,\r\n  my mind dwelling all the time on the means of accomplishing my\r\n  object.\r\n\r\n  ‘I had, some days previously, witnessed the preparation of plans\r\n  which were being made by direction of Sir James Outram to assist the\r\n  commander-in-chief in his march into Lucknow for the relief of the\r\n  besieged, and it then occurred to me that some one with the\r\n  requisite local knowledge ought to attempt to reach his excellency’s\r\n  camp beyond or at the Alum Bagh. The news of Sir Colin Campbell’s\r\n  advance revived the idea, and I made up my mind to go myself at two\r\n  o’clock, after finishing the business I was engaged upon. I\r\n  mentioned to Colonel R. Napier, chief of Sir James Outram’s staff,\r\n  that I was willing to proceed through the enemy to the Alum Bagh, if\r\n  the general thought my doing so would be of service to the\r\n  commander-in-chief. He was surprised at the offer, and seemed to\r\n  regard the enterprise as fraught with too much danger to be assented\r\n  to; but he did me the favour of communicating the offer to Sir James\r\n  Outram, because he considered that my zeal deserved to be brought to\r\n  his notice.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir James did not encourage me to undertake the journey, declaring\r\n  that he thought it so dangerous that he would not himself have asked\r\n  any officer to attempt it. I, however, spoke so confidently of\r\n  success, and treated the dangers so lightly, that he at last\r\n  yielded, and did me the honour of adding, that if I succeeded in\r\n  reaching the commander-in-chief, my knowledge would be a great help\r\n  to him.\r\n\r\n  ‘I secretly arranged for a disguise, so that my departure might not\r\n  be known to my wife, as she was not well enough to bear the prospect\r\n  of an eternal separation. When I left home, about seven o’clock in\r\n  the evening, she thought I was gone on duty for the night to the\r\n  mines; for I was working as an assistant field-engineer, by order of\r\n  Sir James Outram.\r\n\r\n  ‘By half-past seven o’clock my disguise was completed, and when I\r\n  entered the room of Colonel Napier, no one in it recognised me. I\r\n  was dressed as a budmash, or as an irregular soldier of the city,\r\n  with sword and shield, native-made shoes, tight trousers, a yellow\r\n  silk koortah over a tight-fitting white muslin shirt, a\r\n  yellow-coloured chintz sheet thrown round my shoulders, a\r\n  cream-coloured turban, and a white waistband or kumurbund. My face,\r\n  down to the shoulders, and my hands, to the wrists, were coloured\r\n  with lampblack, the cork used being dipped in oil to cause the\r\n  colour to adhere a little. I could get nothing better. I had little\r\n  confidence in the disguise of my features, and I trusted more to the\r\n  darkness of the night; but Sir James Outram and his staff seemed\r\n  satisfied. After being provided with a small double-barrelled\r\n  pistol, and a pair of broad pyjamahs over the tight drawers, I\r\n  proceeded with Kanoujee Lall to the right bank of the river Goomtee,\r\n  running north of our intrenchment, accompanied by Captain Hardinge,\r\n  of the irregular cavalry.\r\n\r\n  ‘Here we undressed and quietly forded the river, which was only\r\n  about four and a half feet deep, and about a hundred yards wide at\r\n  this point. My courage failed me while in the water, and if my guide\r\n  had been within reach, I should perhaps have pulled him back and\r\n  abandoned the enterprise; but he waded quickly through the stream.\r\n  Reaching the opposite bank, we went crouching up a ditch for three\r\n  hundred yards, to a grove of low trees on the edge of a pond, where\r\n  we stopped to dress. While we were here, a man came down to the pond\r\n  to wash, and went away again without observing us.\r\n\r\n  ‘My confidence now returned to me, and with my tulwar resting on my\r\n  shoulder we advanced into the huts in front, where I accosted a\r\n  matchlockman, who answered to my remark that the night was cold: “It\r\n  is very cold—in fact, it is a cold night.” I passed him, adding that\r\n  it would be colder by and by.\r\n\r\n  ‘After going six or seven hundred yards further, we reached the iron\r\n  bridge over the Goomtee, where we were stopped and called over by a\r\n  native officer who was seated in an upper-storied house, and seemed\r\n  to be in command of a cavalry picket, whose horses were near the\r\n  place saddled. My guide advanced to the light, and I stayed a little\r\n  back in the shade. After being told that we had come from\r\n  Mundeon—our old cantonment, and then in the possession of the\r\n  enemy—and that we were going into the city to our homes, he let us\r\n  proceed. We continued on along the left bank of the river to the\r\n  stone bridge, which is about eight or nine hundred yards from the\r\n  iron bridge, passing unnoticed through a number of sepoys and\r\n  matchlockmen, some of whom were escorting persons of rank in\r\n  palanquins preceded by torches.\r\n\r\n  ‘Recrossing the Goomtee by the stone bridge, we went by a sentry\r\n  unobserved, who was closely questioning a dirtily dressed native,\r\n  and into the chowk or principal street of the city of Lucknow, which\r\n  was not illuminated as much as it used to be previous to the siege,\r\n  nor was it so crowded. I jostled against several armed men in the\r\n  street without being spoken to, and only met one guard of seven\r\n  sepoys, who were amusing themselves with some women of pleasure.\r\n\r\n  ‘When issuing from the city into the country, we were challenged by\r\n  a chowkeedar, or watchman, who, without stopping us, merely asked\r\n  who we were. The part of the city traversed that night by me seemed\r\n  to have been deserted by at least a third of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  ‘I was in great spirits when we reached the green fields, into which\r\n  I had not been for five months. Everything around us smelt sweet,\r\n  and a carrot I took from the roadside was the most delicious I had\r\n  ever tasted. I gave vent to my feelings in a conversation with\r\n  Kanoujee Lall, who joined in my admiration of the province of Oude,\r\n  and lamentation that it was now in the hands of wretches whose\r\n  misgovernment and rapacity were ruining it.\r\n\r\n  ‘A further walk of a few miles was accomplished in high spirits. But\r\n  there was trouble before us. We had taken the wrong road, and were\r\n  now quite out of our way in the Dil Koosha Park, which was occupied\r\n  by the enemy. I went within twenty yards of two guns to see what\r\n  strength they were, and returned to the guide, who was in great\r\n  alarm, and begged I would not distrust him because of the mistake,\r\n  as it was caused by his anxiety to take me away from the pickets of\r\n  the enemy. I bade him not to be frightened of me, for I was not\r\n  annoyed, as such accidents were not unfrequent even when there was\r\n  no danger to be avoided. It was now about midnight. We endeavoured\r\n  to persuade a cultivator, who was watching his crop, to shew us the\r\n  way for a short distance, but he urged old age and lameness; and\r\n  another, whom I peremptorily told to come with us, ran off\r\n  screaming, and alarmed the whole village. We next walked quickly\r\n  away into the canal, running under the Char Bagh, in which I fell\r\n  several times, owing to my shoes being wet and slippery and my feet\r\n  sore. The shoes were hard and tight, and had rubbed the skin off my\r\n  toes, and cut into the flesh above the heels.\r\n\r\n  ‘In two hours more we were again in the right direction, two women\r\n  in the village we passed having kindly helped us to find it. About\r\n  two o’clock we reached an advanced picket of sepoys, who told us the\r\n  way, after asking where we had come from, and whither we were going.\r\n  I thought it safer to go up to the picket, than to try to pass them\r\n  unobserved.\r\n\r\n  ‘Kanoujee Lall now begged I would not press him to take me into the\r\n  Alum Bagh, as he did not know the way in, and the enemy were\r\n  strongly posted around the place. I was tired, and in pain from the\r\n  shoes, and would therefore have preferred going into the Alum Bagh;\r\n  but, as the guide feared attempting it, I desired him to go on to\r\n  the camp of the commander-in-chief, which he said was near Bunnee (a\r\n  village eighteen miles from Lucknow) upon the Cawnpore road. The\r\n  moon had risen by this time, and we could see well ahead.\r\n\r\n  ‘By three o’clock we arrived at a grove of mango-trees, situated on\r\n  a plain, in which a man was singing at the top of his voice. I\r\n  thought he was a villager, but he got alarmed on hearing us\r\n  approach; and astonished us, too, by calling out a guard of\r\n  twenty-five sepoys, all of whom asked questions. Kanoujee Lall here\r\n  lost heart for the first time, and threw away the letter intrusted\r\n  to him for Sir Colin Campbell. I kept mine safe in my turban. We\r\n  satisfied the guard that we were poor men travelling to Umroula, a\r\n  village two miles this side of the chief’s camp, to inform a friend\r\n  of the death of his brother by a shot from the British intrenchment\r\n  at Lucknow, and they told us the road. They appeared to be greatly\r\n  relieved on discovering that it was not their terrible foe, who was\r\n  only a few miles in advance of them. We went in the direction\r\n  indicated by them, and after walking for half an hour we got into a\r\n  jheel or swamp, which are numerous and large in Oude. We had to wade\r\n  through it for two hours up to our waists in water, and through\r\n  weeds; for before we found out that we were in a jheel, we had gone\r\n  too far to recede. I was nearly exhausted on getting out of the\r\n  water, having made great exertions to force our way through the\r\n  weeds, and to prevent the colour being washed off my face. It was\r\n  nearly gone from my hands.\r\n\r\n  ‘I now rested for fifteen minutes, despite the remonstrances of the\r\n  guide, and went forward, passing between two pickets of the enemy,\r\n  who had no sentries thrown out. It was near four o’clock in the\r\n  morning when I stopped at the corner of a tope or grove of trees to\r\n  sleep for an hour, which Kanoujee Lall entreated I would not do; but\r\n  I thought he overrated the danger, and, lying down, I told him to\r\n  see if there was any one in the grove who would tell him where we\r\n  then were.\r\n\r\n  ‘We had not gone far when I heard the English challenge “Who comes\r\n  there?” with a native accent. We had reached a British cavalry\r\n  outpost: my eyes filled with joyful tears, and I shook the Sikh\r\n  officer in charge of the picket heartily by the hand. The old\r\n  soldier was as pleased as myself when he heard whence I had come;\r\n  and he was good enough to send two of his men to conduct me to the\r\n  camp of the advance-guard. An officer of her Majesty’s 9th Lancers,\r\n  who was visiting his pickets, met me on the way, and took me to his\r\n  tent, where I got dry stockings and trousers, and, what I much\r\n  needed, a glass of brandy—a liquor I had not tasted for nearly two\r\n  months.\r\n\r\n  ‘I thanked God for having safely conducted me through this dangerous\r\n  enterprise, and Kanoujee Lall for the courage and intelligence with\r\n  which he had conducted himself during this trying night. When we\r\n  were questioned, he let me speak as little as possible. He always\r\n  had a ready answer, and I feel that I am indebted to him in a great\r\n  measure more than to myself for my escape. It will give me great\r\n  satisfaction to hear that he has been suitably rewarded.\r\n\r\n  ‘In undertaking this enterprise, I was actuated by a sense of duty,\r\n  believing that I could be of use to his excellency the\r\n  commander-in-chief when approaching, for its relief, the besieged\r\n  garrison, which had heroically resisted the attack of thirty times\r\n  its own number for nearly five months, within a weak and irregular\r\n  intrenchment; and, secondly, because I was anxious to perform some\r\n  service which would insure to me the honour of wearing our Most\r\n  Gracious Majesty’s Cross.\r\n\r\n  ‘My reception by Sir Colin Campbell and his staff was cordial and\r\n  kind to the utmost degree; and if I never have more than the\r\n  remembrance of their condescension and of the heartfelt\r\n  congratulation of Sir James Outram and of all the officers of his\r\n  garrison on my safe return to them—I shall not repine, though to be\r\n  sure having the Victoria Cross would make me a prouder and a happier\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n                                                      ‘JAMES CAVANAGH.\r\n\r\n  ‘_Camp, Alum Bagh, Nov. 24._’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GROUP OF MAHRATTA ARMS.—From the Collection of Sir S.

Most of the annexations\r\n  effected by the East India Company were followed by changes either in\r\n  the ownership of the soil, or in the assessment of land-tax—such\r\n  land-tax being the chief item in the Company’s revenue. When the\r\n  several annexations occurred, it was found throughout a great part of\r\n  India that superior holders—whether proprietors, hereditary farmers of\r\n  revenue, or hereditary middlemen—held large tracts of land, in a\r\n  middle position between the native governments and the cultivating\r\n  communities, and were responsible for the revenue to the state. In\r\n  Bengal, these influential men were generally recognised by the Company\r\n  as proprietors, and the rights of the sub-holders almost wholly\r\n  ignored. In the Northwest Provinces, acquired by the Company at a much\r\n  later date, the thalookdars, zemindars, or whatever these landowners\r\n  may have been called, were generally set aside; but the asserted\r\n  rights of some of them became subjects of endless litigation in the\r\n  courts of law; the landowners frequently obtained decrees against the\r\n  Company, and many received a percentage in compromise of their rights\r\n  or claims. In Oude, annexed in 1856, the thalookdaree system was\r\n  particularly strong. Almost the whole country had by degrees become\r\n  parcelled out among great thalookdars or zemindars. Though under a\r\n  Mohammedan government, these men were almost universally\r\n  Hindoos—native chiefs who had obtained great prescription, exercised\r\n  great power and authority, and were in fact feudatories of the\r\n  government. They were much more than mere middlemen or farmers of\r\n  revenue. They had their own forts, troops, and guns; they obeyed their\r\n  nawab or king so far as they chose or were compelled; they seized with\r\n  the strong hand estates which had unquestionably belonged to village\r\n  communities in earlier times; and they fought with each other as\r\n  English barons or Scottish clan-chieftains were wont to do in past\r\n  ages. Sir William Sleeman estimated the number of armed retainers,\r\n  whose services these thalookdars could command, at scarcely less than\r\n  one hundred thousand; while they had nearly five hundred pieces of\r\n  cannon in their several forts or strongholds. Under this system the\r\n  village proprietary rights, even if not actually thrown aside and\r\n  disregarded, became more weak and undefined than when the villagers\r\n  held directly from the government. Hence arose a very embarrassing\r\n  question when the Company took possession of Oude. With whom was the\r\n  settlement to be made? The thalookdars were strong and in possession;\r\n  the village communities were dormant, broken, and ill defined. It\r\n  would have taken some time to suppress the one and revive the other.\r\n  The opinions of revenue officers in the Northwest Provinces ran\r\n  strongly in favour of village proprietaries; still stronger in the\r\n  Punjaub; and Oude was treated somewhat in the same way. The result in\r\n  many cases was to eject the thalookdars, and make direct settlements\r\n  with the village communities. When the Revolt began, the thalookdars\r\n  at first behaved well to the British personally; with the butchery by\r\n  a rabble they had no sympathy; and many were the Europeans whose lives\r\n  they saved. But, the Company’s government being for a time upset; and\r\n  the period since the annexation having been too short to destroy the\r\n  strength of the thalookdars, or to enable the village proprietors to\r\n  acquire a steady possession of their rights—the thalookdars almost\r\n  universally resumed what they considered to be their own. There is\r\n  evidence, too, that in this course of proceeding they met with a\r\n  considerable amount of popular support. It was in this way they became\r\n  committed against the British government. Till Havelock’s retreat from\r\n  his unsuccessful attempt to relieve Lucknow in August, the thalookdars\r\n  adopted a temporising policy; but when they saw him and Outram retreat\r\n  across the Ganges to Cawnpore, they thought their time had arrived.\r\n  They began to act in concert—not because they had much sympathy with\r\n  mutinous sepoys, with the decrepit king of Delhi, or with the deposed\r\n  king of Oude—but in the hope that, amid the general anarchy, they\r\n  might regain their old influence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  See NOTE, at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  One of the two hard-worked and sorely tried chaplains, in a letter to\r\n  a relation when the dangers were past, employed a few simple words\r\n  that really described the position of the Residency enclosure better\r\n  than any long technical details. English friends had talked and\r\n  written concerning the ‘impregnable fort’ in which the garrison were\r\n  confined; to which he replied: ‘We were in no fort at all; we occupied\r\n  a few houses in a large garden, with a low wall on one side, and only\r\n  an earthen parapet on the other, in the middle of a large city, the\r\n  buildings of which completely commanded us, and swarming with\r\n  thousands of our deadly foes, thirsting for our blood. God gave us\r\n  protection and pluck, the former in a wonderful degree, or not one of\r\n  us would be here to tell about it.... The engineers calculated that\r\n  all those months never one second elapsed without a shot being thrown\r\n  in at us, and at times upwards of seventy per second, besides round\r\n  shot and shell.’ This probably means that the _average_ was a shot per\r\n  second for nearly five months—_twelve or fourteen million deadly\r\n  missiles_ thrown into this narrow and crowded space.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n    H.M. 8th, 53d, 75th, and 93d foot.\r\n    2d and 4th Punjaub infantry.\r\n    H.M. 9th Lancers.\r\n    Detachments 1st, 2d, and 5th Punjaub cavalry.\r\n    Detachment Hodson’s Horse.\r\n    Detachments Bengal and Punjaub Sappers and Miners.\r\n    Naval brigade, 8 guns; Bengal H.A., 10 guns.\r\n    Bengal horse field-battery, 6 guns; Heavy field-battery.\r\n    —About 700 cavalry and 2700 Infantry, besides artillery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  Detachments H.M. 23d and 82d foot.\r\n\r\n  Detachments Madras horse-artillery, royal artillery, royal engineers,\r\n  and military train.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  The officers killed were Lieutenant-colonel Biddulph; Captains Hardy,\r\n  Wheatcroft, Dalzell, and Lumsden; Lieutenants Mayne, Frankland, and\r\n  Dobbs; Ensign Thompson; and Midshipman Daniel.

The enemy advanced twenty mines against\r\n  the palaces and outposts; of these they exploded three, which caused\r\n  us loss of life, and two which did no injury; seven have been blown\r\n  in; and out of seven others the enemy have been driven, and their\r\n  galleries taken possession of by our miners—results of which the\r\n  engineer department may well be proud. The reports and plans forwarded\r\n  by Sir Henry Havelock, K.C.B., and now submitted to his excellency,\r\n  will explain how a line of gardens, courts, and dwelling-houses,\r\n  without fortified _enceinte_, without flanking defences, and closely\r\n  connected with the buildings of a city, has been maintained for eight\r\n  weeks in a certain degree of security; notwithstanding the close and\r\n  constant musketry-fire from loopholed walls and windows, often within\r\n  thirty yards, and from every lofty building within rifle-range, and\r\n  notwithstanding a frequent though desultory fire of round-shot and\r\n  grape from guns posted at various distances, from seventy to five\r\n  hundred yards. This result has been obtained by the skill and courage\r\n  of the engineer and quartermaster-general’s departments, zealously\r\n  aided by the brave officers and soldiers, who have displayed the same\r\n  cool determination and cheerful alacrity in the toils of the trench\r\n  and amid the concealed dangers of the mine that they had previously\r\n  exhibited when forcing their way into Lucknow at the point of the\r\n  bayonet, and amid a most murderous fire.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  The fate of the few English prisoners at Lucknow is not clearly\r\n  traceable; but one account has stated that four Englishmen were put to\r\n  death on the night when the Residency was finally evacuated. When the\r\n  English troops, the women and children, the guns and baggage, and a\r\n  quarter of a million sterling in silver, had safely reached the Dil\r\n  Koosha, the leaders among the rebels became enraged beyond measure at\r\n  a manœuvre which completely balked them. A few of them rushed to the\r\n  Kaiser Bagh, where the unfortunate prisoners were confined, tied four\r\n  of them—Sir Mountstuart Jackson, Mr Orr, Mr Barnes, and Sergeant\r\n  Martin—to guns, and blew them away. The ladies were said to have been\r\n  spared at the intercession of one of the begums or princesses of Oude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n                      CLOSING EVENTS OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Sir Colin Campbell to Lucknow in November, followed by\r\nthe extraordinary rescue of the British residents at that city, formed\r\nan episode in the history of the Indian Revolt well worthy of being\r\ntreated singly and separately from other matters. This having been done,\r\nthe present chapter may conveniently be devoted to the closing events of\r\nthe year in other places, touching only upon such occurrences as\r\nimmediately affected the mutiny or the plans for its suppression. As in\r\nthe former chapters[124]—relating, the one to July and August, and the\r\nother to September and October—the survey (applicable in this case to\r\nNovember and December) may usefully begin in the Calcutta provinces, and\r\nthence travel westward.\r\n\r\nCalcutta itself, for reasons more than once stated, was not likely to be\r\nmaterially affected by mutinous proceedings. The interests of the native\r\ntowns-people, concerned in supplying the wants of a larger number of\r\nEuropeans than resided at any other city in India, led them to prefer\r\nscenes of quiet, even if the Bengalee character had been more warlike\r\nthan is its wont; while the frequent landing of British troops from\r\nother shores kept in awe such of the sepoy soldiers as still remained in\r\narms. A naval squadron anchored in the Hoogly, with sufficient power of\r\nmetal to batter the city to ruins if danger arose. The natives, except a\r\nfew of fanatical character, were more disposed to seek for holiday than\r\nfor war; and holiday occasionally fell to their share, in the\r\nproceedings of the British themselves. On one day, towards the close of\r\nNovember, there were 4500 British troops temporarily garrisoned at\r\nCalcutta, and 11 ships-of-war anchored in the river. The troops\r\ncomprised H.M. 19th, 20th, 42d, 54th, 79th, and 97th regiments of foot,\r\nor portions of them, together with one battalion of the 60th Rifles, and\r\none of the Rifle brigade. A review of most of these fine troops was held\r\non the Calcutta volunteers’ parade-ground, before the journey to the\r\nupper provinces commenced. The Calcutta government commenced operations\r\nfor reorganising the vast regions which had been thrown into confusion\r\nby the Revolt. A plan was sketched out for separating the divisions of\r\nDelhi and Meerut from the Northwest Provinces, and transferring them to\r\nthe government of the Punjaub—in order that they might share in the\r\npeculiar system of executive rule which had been found to work well in\r\nthe Punjaub, under the energetic control of Sir John Lawrence. The rest\r\nof the Northwest Provinces could not be permanently reorganised until\r\nthe warlike operations had made further advance. Another proceeding on\r\nthe part of the government was to send out a commission to the Andaman\r\nIslands, to examine how far they were suited as a penal settlement for\r\nrebels or traitors sentenced to transportation; the commission comprised\r\nnaval and medical officers, who were empowered to select a spot healthy\r\nin situation and easily defended.\r\n\r\nIn the easternmost districts of India, mutiny shewed itself in small\r\ndegree. It could hardly be other than slight, however; for the\r\nHindustani troops were few in number, and the general population not ill\r\naffected. Three companies of the 34th Bengal native infantry, it will be\r\nremembered,[125] were stationed at Chittagong at the very beginning of\r\nthe troubles in March and April; they not only remained faithful when\r\nthe other companies of the same regiment became mutinous at Berhampore,\r\nbut made a very high-flown declaration of their loyalty. After remaining\r\n‘true to their salt’ throughout the whole of the summer and autumn,\r\nthese three companies at length yielded to the general mania. They broke\r\nout into mutiny at Chittagong on the 18th of November, burnt their\r\nlines, blew up the magazine, looted the treasury, and commenced a search\r\nfor Europeans. These latter escaped, chiefly in boats upon the river.\r\nThe mutineers then released the convicts from the jail, and decamped.\r\nThey moved northward, apparently tending toward Tipperah, where a petty\r\nrajah held his court. Directly this was known, Major Byng, commanding a\r\nSilhet native regiment, marched down from the hills, and met the\r\nmutineers. A brief conflict ensued, in which the major unfortunately\r\nreceived a mortal wound; but the misguided men of the 34th, meeting with\r\nno kind of sympathy from the Silhetees, were almost wholly annihilated\r\nwithin a few days.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time two companies of the 73d native regiment at\r\nDacca; and as soon as the authorities received from the magistrate of\r\nChittagong news of what had occurred at the last-mentioned place, they\r\nresolved to disarm those two companies, as a precaution against\r\nmischief. The sepoys, however, hearing the news from Chittagong more\r\nspeedily than the authorities, prepared for resistance. A party of\r\nvolunteers disarmed a few scattered sepoys; but as the others had\r\nartillery to assist them, a hundred English sailors, with two or three\r\nhowitzers, were told off to deal with them. A sharp contest ensued at\r\nthe sepoy barracks, with balls, grape, and musketry; until at length the\r\nsailors, determined on a closer attack, rushed upon the sepoys, drove\r\nthem out of the barracks, and killed many on the spot. The rest set off\r\non a hasty march to Jelpigoree, the head-quarters of the regiment. So\r\nutterly was that part of India denuded of British troops, that there\r\nwere none to repel even one or two hundred mutineers; and many villages\r\nwere plundered on the road. The check came from a quarter where\r\napparently the mutineers least expected it—from the men of their own\r\nregiment. The motives of the native troops were as inscrutable now as at\r\nany former time; for although the two companies thus rebelled, fought,\r\nand fled, the bulk of the regiment remained faithful. They had even\r\nquietly permitted two hundred Goorkhas to join the regiment—that step\r\nhaving been adopted by the authorities to infuse new blood into the\r\ncorps. An officer of the 73d, writing from Jelpigoree on the 3d of\r\nDecember, said: ‘Our men have sworn to their native officers (not to us)\r\nthat they will do their duty; and our spies, who have hitherto proved so\r\ntrustworthy, declare that we may fully depend on the regiment. Yesterday\r\nthe test commenced by our ordering accoutrements and ammunition to be\r\nserved out to our two hundred Goorkhas. This was done cheerfully, and is\r\na very good indication of the prevailing feeling. A strange scene it\r\nwas, watching the sepoys doling out ammunition to Goorkhas to fight\r\nagainst their own (the sepoys’) comrades, and it did one’s heart good to\r\nsee it: we are all under arms, and very sanguine.’ These men actually\r\njoined in routing the mutinous companies of their own regiment, and in\r\ndriving them towards Bhotan, where they died miserably among an\r\nunsympathising population.—Such discrepancies in conduct between\r\ndifferent regiments and different companies of the same regiment, threw\r\ngreat difficulties in the way of any logical tracing of the causes of\r\nthe Revolt.\r\n\r\nIn a wide region of Bengal westward of Calcutta, the only incidents\r\nrequiring notice were two or three in which the Shekhawuttie battalion\r\nshewed that it still remained faithful to the Company’s raj—almost the\r\nlast relic of the once magnificent Bengal army. With this regiment\r\nColonel Forster put down the recusant Rajah of Pachete, whose domain\r\ntouched the grand trunk-road above Raneegunge. After hovering some time\r\non the verge of treason, this man at length refused to obey the British\r\nresident at Rugonauthpoor, Mr Lushington, who was obliged to intrench\r\nhimself in self-defence. Colonel Forster hastened thither; and by his\r\nown boldness of bearing, and the faithfulness of his Shekhawutties, he\r\ncaptured the rajah, a fort of no inconsiderable strength, much wealth,\r\nand a mass of treasonable correspondence—without firing a shot. Shortly\r\nafterwards, Forster marched to Sumbhulpore, where a band of ruffians,\r\nheaded by one of their own class, had commenced a course of violence\r\nthat needed and obtained a prompt check.\r\n\r\nLet us hasten on to the busier scenes of the northwest, viewing them in\r\nconnection with Cawnpore as a central point of strategy, and with Sir\r\nColin Campbell as leader of all the British operations. This may the\r\nmore appropriately be done; because there were no events on the Lower\r\nGanges, between Calcutta and Benares, requiring notice, so far as\r\nconcerned the months of November and December.\r\n\r\nCawnpore was a centre in military matters for the following reasons. On\r\none side of it was Lucknow, so important in relation to the occupancy of\r\nOude; Allahabad, on another side, was on the great line of route for\r\ntroops from Calcutta; Agra and Delhi, towards the northwest, lay on the\r\npath of approach from the Punjaub; while on the south and southwest were\r\nthe roads along which armies or columns of armies might march from the\r\ntwo southern provinces of Madras and Bombay. Hence Sir Colin Campbell\r\nmade earnest endeavours to maintain a good position at Cawnpore, as a\r\nconvenient base of operations. Colonel Wilson, as commandant, was\r\ninstructed to attend to the wants of Lucknow so far as he could, and to\r\nwatch the movements of insurgent troops in the neighbourhood. This\r\ncontinued throughout October. In November, when Sir Colin went with his\r\nsmall army to relieve Lucknow, he left General Windham—well known in\r\nCrimean warfare as the ‘hero of the Redan’—in command at Cawnpore, not\r\nto fight, but to keep communication safely open from Lucknow _viâ_\r\nCawnpore to Allahabad. Sir Colin, it will be remembered,[126] hurried\r\nback to Cawnpore at the end of November on account of events that had\r\noccurred during his absence. What those events were, we have now to\r\nnarrate.\r\n\r\nThe series of disasters that occurred to General Windham originated in\r\npart in the want of good communication between him and Sir Colin\r\nCampbell. Whether the messengers were stopped by the way, does not\r\nclearly appear; but Sir Colin remained in ignorance that the Gwalior\r\nmutineers were approaching Cawnpore; while Windham received no replies\r\nto letters sent by him, asking for instructions for his guidance. Sir\r\nColin knew nothing of Windham’s troubles until, on the 27th of November,\r\nhe heard at the Alum Bagh the noise of artillery-firing at Cawnpore;\r\nwhile Windham received no aid or advice until Sir Colin himself appeared\r\nlate on the following day. Whether or not there were defective tactics\r\nin the subsequent management of the affair, this uncertainty at the\r\nbeginning was unquestionably disadvantageous. Windham knew, about the\r\nmiddle of the month, that the Gwalior and Indore mutineers, swelled to\r\n20,000 strong by reinforcements of rebels from various quarters, had\r\nreached within about thirty miles of Cawnpore, on the Calpee road; and a\r\nweek later he found that they were within twenty miles. As the troops at\r\nhis command barely exceeded 2000 men, and as he received no news from\r\nCampbell, he considered how best to maintain his position. He was in an\r\nintrenchment or intrenched fort, far distant from the one formerly\r\noccupied by Sir Hugh Wheeler, and placed close to the Ganges, so as to\r\ncommand the bridge of boats; there being within the intrenchment the\r\nrequisite buildings for the daily necessities of his force. As the city\r\nof Cawnpore lay between him and the Calpee road, he deemed it necessary\r\nto take up a new position. Leaving some of his troops, therefore, in the\r\nintrenchment, he formed with the remainder a new camp at Dhuboulee,\r\nclose to the canal westward of the city, at a point where he believed he\r\nwould be able to watch and frustrate the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, finding that the mutineers were approaching, he went out to\r\nencounter them. He started at three in the morning with about 1200\r\ninfantry (chiefly of the 34th, 82d, 88th, and Rifles, 100 Sikh cavalry\r\nand eight guns), and marched eight or nine miles to Bhowsee, near the\r\nPandoo Nuddee—leaving his camp-equipage and baggage near the city.\r\nBrigadier Carthew was second in command; and the chief officers under\r\nhim were Colonels Walpole, Kelly, and Maxwell. The enemy were found\r\nstrongly posted on the opposite side of the dry bed of the Pandoo\r\nNuddee. The British advanced with a line of skirmishers along the whole\r\nfront, with supports on each flank, and a reserve in the centre. The\r\nenemy opened a heavy fire of artillery from siege and field guns; but\r\nsuch was the eagerness of the British troops to engage, that they\r\ncarried the position with a rush, cheering as they went; and a village,\r\nhalf a mile in the rear of the enemy, was rapidly cleared. The mutineers\r\nhastily took to flight, leaving behind them two howitzers and one gun.\r\nAt this point, apparently for the first time, Windham became aware that\r\nhe had been engaging the advanced column only of the enemy, and that the\r\nmain force was near at hand. Rendered uneasy by his position, he\r\nresolved on retiring to protect the city, camp, cantonment,\r\nintrenchment, and bridge of boats. This he did.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, the operations of the 26th were to a certain extent\r\nsuccessful. But disaster followed. He encamped for the night on the\r\nJewee Plain, on the Calpee side of Cawnpore, having the city between him\r\nand the intrenchment. Whether Windham did not know that the enemy were\r\nso near in great force, whether his camping-ground was ill chosen, or\r\nwhether he left his flanks unprotected, certain it is that, about noon\r\non the 27th, when his men were preparing for a camp-dinner, they were\r\nsurprised by an onslaught of the enemy in immense force, from behind a\r\nthick cover of trees and brushwood, beginning with an overwhelming\r\nartillery cannonade. For five hours did this attack continue, chiefly\r\nnear the point of junction of the Delhi and Calpee roads. Distracted by\r\nan attack on three sides of him, Windham hastened to see what was doing\r\non the fourth side, towards the city; and here he ascertained that the\r\nmutineers had turned his flanks, got into the city, and were beginning\r\nto attack the intrenchment near the bridge. Retreat was at once resolved\r\non; and although the general’s dispatch did not state the fact, the\r\nprivate letters shew that the retreat was _sauve qui peut_. For, in\r\ntruth, it became a matter of speed, whether the British could rush back\r\nto the intrenchment in time to save it. They did so; but at the expense\r\nof a large store of tents, saddlery, harness, camp-equipage, and private\r\nproperty—all of which had to be abandoned in the hasty scamper from the\r\ncamp to the intrenchment. This booty the enemy at once seized upon, and\r\neither appropriated or burned according to its degree of usefulness. No\r\nless than five hundred tents fed a bonfire that night—a loss quite\r\nirreparable at that time to the British.\r\n\r\nBitter was the mortification with which the troops contemplated this\r\nday’s work. One of the officers said in a private letter: ‘You will read\r\nthe account of this day’s fighting with astonishment; for it tells how\r\nEnglish troops, with their trophies and their mottoes, and their\r\nfar-famed bravery, were repulsed and lost their camp, their baggage, and\r\ntheir position, by [to?] the scouted and degraded natives of India.’ The\r\nbeaten ‘Feringhees,’ as the enemy had now a right to call them, did\r\ncertainly retreat to their intrenchment amid overturned tents, pillaged\r\nbaggage, men’s kits, fleeing camels, elephants, horses, and servants.\r\nAnother officer who had just come up from Allahabad, and who was within\r\nthe intrenchment on the afternoon of this day, thus described the scene:\r\n‘Saw our troops retreating into the outer intrenchment. A regular panic\r\nfollowed. Trains of elephants, camels, horses, bullock-wagons, and\r\ncoolies came in at the principal gate, laden with stuff. The principal\r\nbuildings are the General Hospital, the Sailors’ Hospital, the\r\nPost-office, and the Commissariat-cellars. Around these houses, which\r\nare scattered, crowds of camels, bullocks, and horses were collected,\r\nfastened by ropes to stakes in the ground, and among the animals, piles\r\nof trunks, beds, chairs, and miscellaneous furniture and baggage. There\r\nwas scarcely room to move. Met one of the chaplains hastening into the\r\nintrenchment. He had left everything in his tent outside. The servants\r\nalmost everywhere abandoned their masters when they heard the guns.\r\nMounted officers were galloping across the rough ground between the\r\ninner and outer intrenchments, and doolie after doolie, with its red\r\ncurtains down, concealing some poor victim, passed on to the hospitals.\r\nThe poor fellows were brought in, shot, cut, shattered, and wounded in\r\nevery imaginable way; and as they went by, raw stumps might be seen\r\nhanging over the sides of the doolies, literally like torn butcher-meat.\r\nThe agonies which I saw some of them endure during the surgical\r\noperations were such as no tongue or pen can describe. The surgeons, who\r\ndid their utmost, were so overworked, that many sufferers lay bleeding\r\nfor hours before it was possible to attend to them.’ During the hasty\r\nretreat, one of the guns had been overturned in a narrow street in\r\nCawnpore. The British could not wait to bring it away; but at night\r\nGeneral Windham ordered 100 men of the 64th to aid a few seamen of the\r\nnaval brigade in an expedition to secure the gun. It was a delicate\r\ntask, in a city crowded with the enemy; how it was done, one of the\r\nofficers of the naval brigade has told.[127]\r\n\r\nWhat was next to be done, became an important question. General Windham\r\nassembled his superior officers, and conferred with them. If he could\r\nhave obtained reliable information concerning the position of the\r\nenemy’s artillery, he would have proposed a night-attack; but, in\r\nignorance on this important point, it was resolved to defer operations\r\ntill the morrow. Early on the 28th, accordingly, the force was divided\r\ninto four sections, thus distributed: One, under Walpole, was to defend\r\nthe advanced portion of the town on the left side of the canal; a\r\nsecond, under Wilson, was to hold the intrenchment, and establish a\r\nstrong picket on the extreme right; a third, under Carthew, was to hold\r\nthe Bithoor road in advance of the intrenchment, receiving support from\r\nthe picket there if needed; while the fourth section, under Windham\r\nhimself, was to defend the portion of the town nearest the Ganges on the\r\nleft of the canal, and support Walpole if needful. These several\r\narrangements were especially intended to protect the intrenchment and\r\nthe bridge of boats—so important in relation to Sir Colin Campbell’s\r\noperations in Oude. The British position was to be wholly defensive. A\r\nsevere struggle ensued. The Gwalior mutineers were now joined by another\r\nforce under Nena Sahib, and a third under his brother Bhola Sahib;\r\naltogether the insurgents numbered 21,000. They marched unmolested\r\ntowards the city and cantonment; and then were the few British sorely\r\npressed indeed. Walpole was speedily engaged in very hard fighting; and\r\nit was on his side only that anything like a victory was achieved. Aided\r\nby Colonels Woodford and Watson, and Captain Greene, Walpole repulsed a\r\nvigorous attack made by the enemy, and captured two 18-pounder guns.\r\nCarthew, who struggled from morning till night against a most formidable\r\nbody of the enemy, was at length obliged to retire from his position.\r\nWilson, eager to render service at an exposed point, led his section of\r\ntroops—chiefly consisting of H.M. 64th foot—against four guns planted by\r\nthe enemy in front of Carthew’s position. He and his gallant men\r\nadvanced in the face of the enemy, and under a murderous fire, for more\r\nthan half a mile, up a ravine commanded by high ground in front as well\r\nas on both sides. From the ridge in front, the four 9-pounders played\r\nupon them as they rushed forward. After reaching and almost capturing\r\nthe guns, they were encountered by a very large force of the enemy who\r\nhad hitherto been hidden; further progress was impossible; they\r\nretreated, and saw their officers falling around them in mournful\r\nnumber. Colonel Wilson himself was killed; as were also Major Stirling,\r\nCaptain M’Crea, and Captain Morphey; while many other officers were\r\nwounded. It was a defeat and a loss, for which no counterbalancing\r\nadvantage was gained.\r\n\r\nThus the 28th had increased the humiliation of the preceding day. Tents,\r\nbaggage, officers, prestige—all had suffered. The mutineers revelled in\r\nthe city as conquerors on the night of the 28th, seizing everything\r\nwhich had belonged to the British. More than 10,000 rounds of Enfield\r\ncartridges, the mess-plate of four Queen’s regiments, paymasters’\r\nchests, and a large amount of miscellaneous property, fell into their\r\nhands. On the morning of the 29th the insurgents began to bombard the\r\nintrenchment and the bridge of boats. Had not Sir Colin Campbell arrived\r\nat that critical time, it is hard to say what might have been the amount\r\nof disaster; for the enemy were in immense strength; and if the bridge\r\nof boats had been broken, the fate of the refugees from Lucknow might\r\nhave been sad indeed. All that day did the firing of the enemy continue.\r\nAll that day did the living stream from Lucknow approach the bridge. Sir\r\nColin immediately assumed command at Cawnpore. Mortifying as it was to\r\nhim to leave the enemy in possession of the city and everything west of\r\nit, he had no alternative. One holy duty pressed upon him—to protect the\r\nhelpless Lucknow convoy until it could be sent on to Allahabad. He\r\ndespatched Hope Grant with a column, to keep open the road from Cawnpore\r\nthrough Futtehpoor to Allahabad; while he employed all his other troops\r\nin keeping the enemy at bay. The officers in the intrenchment, looking\r\nover their earthworks, could see the six miles’ train of women,\r\nchildren, sick, wounded, bearers, servants, camp-followers, horses,\r\noxen, camels, elephants, wagons, carts, palanquins, doolies, advancing\r\nalong the road to the bridge; and most narrowly were the movements of\r\nthe enemy watched, to prevent any interruption to the passage of the\r\ncavalcade over the frail bridge.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate series of events at Cawnpore greatly disconcerted Sir\r\nColin Campbell. In his first dispatch to government relating to them, he\r\nreferred almost without comment to Windham’s own narrative. Three weeks\r\nafterwards a singularly worded dispatch was issued from his camp near\r\nCawnpore, expressing a regret at an ‘omission’ in his former dispatch;\r\nand adding, ‘I desire to make my acknowledgment of the great\r\ndifficulties in which Major-general Windham, C.B., was placed during the\r\noperations he describes in his dispatch; and to recommend him and the\r\nofficers whom he notices as having rendered him assistance to your\r\nlordship’s protection and good offices.’ Lord Canning shortly afterwards\r\nissued a general order, containing an echo of Sir Colin’s dispatch.\r\nGeneral Windham continued for a time with the commander-in-chief. If\r\nofficial dissatisfaction with his management at Cawnpore existed, it was\r\neither hushed up or smoothed away by subsequent explanations.\r\n\r\nThe month of December opened amid events that caused sufficient anxiety\r\nto Sir Colin Campbell. The convoy of Lucknow fugitives had not yet been\r\nsent away; the Gwalior mutineers had not yet been defeated. He was\r\ncompelled to act on the defensive until his helpless non-combatants were\r\nprovided for. During one week, from the 26th of November to the 2d of\r\nDecember, the loss in British officers had been very considerable in and\r\nnear Cawnpore; for 10 were reported killed, 32 wounded, and 2 missing.\r\nThe commander-in-chief, therefore, while repelling the still audacious\r\ninsurgents, had to promote and establish numerous officers, as well as\r\nto reorganise his force.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to Sir Colin when the convoy left Cawnpore on its\r\nmarch towards Allahabad. He was then free to act as a military\r\ncommander; and the enemy did not long delay in giving him an opportunity\r\nof proving his powers of command. On the 5th of December the enemy’s\r\nartillery attacked his left pickets, while their infantry shewed on the\r\nsame quarter; they also fired on the British pickets in the\r\nGeneralgunje—an old bazaar extending along the canal in front of the\r\nline occupied by the camp. Brigadier Greathed had held this advanced\r\nposition supported by Peel’s and Bourchier’s guns. Sir Colin resolved to\r\ntake the offensive on the following day. The enemy occupied a strong\r\nposition. Their centre was in the city of Cawnpore, and lined the houses\r\nand bazaars overhanging the canal and the barricaded streets; their\r\nright stretched away to a point beyond the crossing of the main\r\ntrunk-road over the canal; while their left occupied the old cantonment,\r\nfrom which General Windham’s post had been principally assailed. The\r\ncanal, along which were placed the centre and the right, was thus the\r\nmain feature of the enemy’s position, and could only be passed by two\r\nbridges. The enemy’s camp was two miles in rear of their right, on the\r\nCalpee road, which was intended to be their line of advance and retreat.\r\nSir Colin well studied this position before he formed his plan. ‘It\r\nappeared to me,’ he said in his dispatch, ‘that if the enemy’s right\r\nwere vigorously attacked, it would be driven from its position without\r\nassistance being able to come from other parts of the line: the wall of\r\nthe town, which gave cover to our attacking columns on the right, being\r\nan effective obstacle to the movement of any portion of the enemy’s\r\ntroops from their left to their right.’ In fact, his quick eye saw that\r\nthe Gwalior mutineers had placed one-half their force in such a spot\r\nthat it could not help the other half, provided the attack were made in\r\na certain fashion. It was really a large and powerful army to which he\r\nwas now confronted; so many other mutinous regiments had joined the\r\nGwalior Contingent, that their force was now estimated at little short\r\nof 25,000 men, with about 40 pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Battle of Cawnpore, December 6, 1857.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, the commander-in-chief assigned to all his\r\nseveral corps and regiments their respective duties.[128] General\r\nWindham opened a heavy bombardment at nine o’clock, from the\r\nintrenchment in the old cantonment, to induce the enemy to believe that\r\nthe attack would be in that quarter. For two hours, the rest of the\r\nforce was quietly taking up its position—Greathed’s column in front of\r\nthe enemy’s centre, and the other columns in rear of the old cavalry\r\nlines, effectually masked from observation. When it was judged that\r\nWindham’s fire had drawn the enemy’s attention away from the real point\r\nof attack, Sir Colin sent his cavalry and horse-artillery by a detour on\r\nthe left, to cross the canal a mile and a half higher up, and assail the\r\nenemy’s rear; while the infantry deployed in parallel lines fronting the\r\ncanal. Captain Peel was the first man to cross the canal bridge for the\r\nattack on the enemy’s camp; the heavy guns followed him; and in a few\r\nminutes the enemy were astonished at finding themselves in the heat of\r\nbattle on a side not at all contemplated by them. Their defeat was equal\r\nto their surprise. Sir Colin’s regiments crossed the canal by various\r\nbridges, reached the enemy’s camp, cut their forces in two, and then\r\ncompletely routed them—pursuing them for fourteen miles on the Calpee\r\nroad, and capturing guns and wagons as they went. In all this work the\r\nsailors of the naval brigade pushed forward with an energy which seems\r\nto have struck even the commander-in-chief, accustomed as he was to\r\ndeeds of daring. In his official dispatch he said: ‘I must here draw\r\nattention to the manner in which the heavy 24-pounder guns were impelled\r\nand managed by Captain Peel and his gallant sailors. Through the\r\nextraordinary energy and good-will with which the latter have worked,\r\ntheir guns have been constantly in advance throughout our late\r\noperations, from the relief of Lucknow till now—as if they were light\r\nfield-pieces. The service rendered by them in clearing our front has\r\nbeen incalculable. On this occasion there was the sight beheld of\r\n24-pounder guns advancing with the first line of skirmishers.’ Before\r\nSir Colin returned to camp in the evening, the enemy had been driven\r\nentirely and completely away from Cawnpore. The four infantry brigades\r\nengaged in this hot day’s work were headed by Brigadiers Greathed,\r\nAdrian Hope, Walpole, and Inglis. Windham was only employed in masking\r\nthe real nature of the attack. Sir Colin mentioned this matter in the\r\nfollowing peculiar terms: ‘Owing to his knowledge of the ground, I\r\nrequested Major-general Windham to remain in command of the\r\nintrenchment, the fire of which was a very important feature in the\r\noperations of the 6th of December; although I felt and explained to\r\nGeneral Windham that it was a command hardly worthy of his rank.’\r\n\r\nThere was a subsidiary operation in this battle of the 6th. After the\r\ncapture of the enemy’s camp, in the afternoon, General Mansfield was\r\nsent to occupy a position called the Subadar’s Tank, in rear of the\r\nenemy’s left, and about a mile and a half from the intrenchment. Having\r\ntaken measures for the safeguard of the captured camp, and for\r\nmaintaining a good post on the Calpee road, Mansfield advanced towards\r\nthe Tank—struggling over broken ground and through enclosures, and\r\ndriving parties of the enemy before him. After a good deal of\r\nmanœuvring, in ground that greatly assisted the rebels, Mansfield\r\nsucceeded in securing the position sought, and had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing large bodies of the enemy’s infantry and cavalry move off\r\nwestward in full retreat. As it was not practicable to communicate with\r\nSir Colin after sunset, the position taken up being almost isolated; and\r\nas there were considerable numbers of the enemy still in occupation of\r\nthe town and the old cantonment—Mansfield strengthened the pickets all\r\nround his position, and bivouacked his troops for the night, where they\r\nwere left undisturbed by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers were so thoroughly worsted in these operations on the 6th,\r\nthat they retired from Cawnpore, irresolute touching their future\r\nplans—some marching in one direction, some in another. After securing\r\nand consolidating his position on the 7th, Sir Colin prepared further\r\nwork for his lieutenants. On the 8th, he gave orders to Brigadier Hope\r\nGrant to march to Bithoor, and, if it should appear to him desirable, to\r\nadvance further to Serai Ghat, a ferry over the Ganges about twenty-five\r\nmiles above Cawnpore. This energetic officer set off with a strong\r\ncolumn of 2800 men[129] and 11 guns, and marched through Bithoor to\r\nSoorajpore, three miles short of Serai Ghat. Here he bivouacked for the\r\nnight. Early in the morning of the 9th, leaving a portion of his column\r\nto guard the baggage, he advanced with the main body, and found the\r\nenemy assembling on the bank of the river. The opposing forces soon got\r\nengaged in an artillery action, in which Grant’s guns narrowly escaped\r\nbeing lost in a quicksand at the river-side. After a sharp firing for\r\nhalf an hour, the enemy’s guns were silenced and then withdrawn. Then\r\ncame up a force of the rebels’ cavalry, to endeavour to capture Grant’s\r\nguns; but he promptly sent forward his own cavalry, which advanced upon\r\nthem, drove them away, pursued them, and cut up a considerable number.\r\nThe nature of the ground, however, was such that most of the enemy\r\nreached the cover of trees and houses before the British could intercept\r\nthem. Hope Grant’s infantry was not engaged in this conflict; the\r\nretreat of the enemy taking place before their aid was needed. The enemy\r\nleft behind them fourteen brass guns and howitzers, one iron 18-pounder,\r\ntogether with a large store of wagons and ammunition—all of which were\r\nspeedily secured by the conquerors. These trophies were brought away by\r\nthe exertions of the infantry, who had much difficulty to contend\r\nagainst along the quicksands. The troops had been marching and fighting\r\nfor thirty hours, with few and short intervals, and had scarcely eaten\r\nfor twenty-four hours; so that a supper, a night’s rest, and a quiet day\r\non the 10th, were very welcome to them. This affair at Serai Ghat\r\ncompletely succeeded; but the most extraordinary fact relating to it has\r\nyet to be mentioned. Hope Grant’s casualty-list _was a blank_! In his\r\ndispatch he said: ‘I am truly grateful to God, and happy to say, that\r\nthough the fire of grape from the enemy was most severe and well placed,\r\nfalling among the artillery like hail, I had not a single man even\r\nwounded, and only one horse of Captain Middleton’s battery killed. It\r\nwas truly marvellous and providential. Thirteen guns, most of them\r\n9-pounders and 24-pounder howitzers, were playing with grape on the\r\ngallant artillery, and with round-shot upon the cavalry, the former\r\nwithin about five hundred yards—and his excellency is well aware with\r\nwhat precision these rebels fire their guns—yet not one single man was\r\nwounded.’ It requires all one’s faith in the honour of a truthful man to\r\ncredit such a marvellous announcement.\r\n\r\nIn the various operations from the 3d to the 8th of December inclusive,\r\nSir Colin suffered a loss of 13 killed and 86 wounded—a mere trifle\r\ncompared with the strength of his force and the kind of enemy with whom\r\nhe had to deal. Among the killed were Lieutenants Salmond and Vincent;\r\nand among the wounded, General Mansfield, Lieutenant-colonel Horsford,\r\nCaptains Longden, Forbes, and Mansfield, Lieutenants Neill and Stirling,\r\nEnsigns Wrench, Graham, and Dyce. Lieutenant Stirling afterwards died\r\nfrom the effects of a wound which was at first reputed curable.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences narrated in the last few pages will have shewn by what\r\nsteps Sir Colin Campbell obtained a firm footing at Cawnpore, as a\r\ncentre from which he and his officers might operate in various\r\ndirections. He had removed the British from Lucknow; he had furnished to\r\nOutram such a force as would enable that general to hold the Alum Bagh\r\nagainst all assailants; and he had dispersed the formidable rebel army\r\nwhich so endangered Windham and the British interests at Cawnpore. In\r\nthe latter half of December he prepared to start off, with one portion\r\nof his force, towards Furruckabad; while Walpole was to proceed to\r\nEtawah, and Hope Grant to Futtehpoor; leaving Seaton to operate near\r\nMinpooree, Franks near Benares, and other brigadiers and colonels in\r\nvarious directions as rapidly as small columns could be brought\r\ntogether. The object appeared to be, to attack and disperse the enemy in\r\nvarious parts of the Northwest Provinces, and either permit or compel\r\nthem to retreat into Oude—where a great effort, made early in the\r\nensuing year, might possibly crush the rebellion altogether. So much of\r\nthese operations as took place in December may briefly be noticed here,\r\nbefore proceeding to the affairs of Central India.\r\n\r\nThe whole region around Benares, Mirzapore, Allahabad, Goruckpore, and\r\nJounpoor was thrown into occasional uneasiness—not so much by rebellious\r\nmanifestations at those places, as by temptations thrown out by the\r\nOudians. Mahomed Hussein was still powerful as a leader near the Oudian\r\nfrontier; and he left no means untried to rally numerous insurgents\r\naround his standard. As the British could spare very few troops for\r\nservice in this quarter, Mahomed Hussein remained throughout the most of\r\nthe year master in and near Goruckpore. Even if the British were enabled\r\nto defeat him occasionally, they had no cavalry wherewith to organise a\r\npursuit, and he speedily returned to his old quarters. Thus, towards the\r\nclose of December, Colonel Rowcroft, with a mixed body of English\r\nsailors, Sikh police, and Goorkha irregulars, defeated this chieftain\r\nnear Mujhowlee; but, unable to pursue him without cavalry, the victory\r\nwas of little effect. Jung Bahadoor, as we have seen in a former\r\nchapter, sent a strong body of Goorkhas several weeks earlier to aid in\r\nthe pacification of this part of India; and the gallant little Nepaulese\r\nwarriors enabled the few English officers to effect that which would\r\nhave been impracticable without such assistance. Jung Bahadoor himself,\r\nin conformity with an engagement made with Viscount Canning, prepared to\r\njoin in the scene in person. He descended with 9000 picked men from his\r\nmountains in December, to attack the Oudian rebels near Goruckpore and\r\nAzimghur, and drive them back to their own country. It was just at the\r\nclose of the year that he began to encounter the enemy, and to obtain\r\nsuccesses which left Franks, Rowcroft, Longden, and other officers, free\r\nto engage in such operations as Sir Colin Campbell might plan for them\r\nat the opening of the new year.\r\n\r\nAllahabad and Mirzapore, though often threatened, remained safely in\r\nBritish hands. In the Rewah district, southwest of those cities, the\r\nrajah still continued faithful, and Captain Osborne still carried on\r\nthose energetic operations by which he had so long and so wonderfully\r\nmaintained his post in a territory where he was almost the sole\r\nEnglishman, and where many of the rajah’s troops were burning with\r\nimpatience to join the insurgents elsewhere. Osborne was incessantly on\r\nthe watch, and almost incessantly in motion, to keep open the important\r\nline of route between Mirzapore through Rewah to Jubbulpoor—part of the\r\navailable postal route between Calcutta and Bombay. There was a nest of\r\nrebels at Myhere that gave him much trouble; but, aided by the faithful\r\nportion of the rajah’s troops, he defeated them at Kunchynpore and\r\nZorah; and finally, on the 28th of December, stormed and captured Myhere\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn Oude, as the last chapter sufficiently shewed, British power was\r\nrepresented simply and solely by Sir James Outram and his companions in\r\nthe Alum Bagh and at the Bridge of Bunnee. Lucknow was quite in the\r\nhands of the enemy, as were all the provincial districts of Oude. Sir\r\nJames maintained his post steadily; not strong enough to make conquests,\r\nbut holding the key to a position that might become all-important as\r\nsoon as the commander-in-chief should resume operations in that quarter.\r\nSo well did he keep watch and guard, that the movements of any insurgent\r\ntroops in his vicinity became speedily known to him. On the 22d of\r\nDecember, the rebels made a clever attempt to obtain possession of the\r\nroad to Cawnpore. They posted 1200 men inside a jungle, with a sandy\r\nplain in front and a road close at hand. Sir James, detecting the\r\nintended plan, silently moved out two regiments in the dead of the\r\nnight. The soft sand deadened all sound; and dawn found them within the\r\nenemy’s pickets. A rattling volley and a cheer startled the enemy, who,\r\nafter one discharge of their muskets, fled, leaving a hundred of their\r\nnumber dead on the field, besides four guns and several\r\nammunition-wagons. One good result of this victory was, to induce some\r\nof the villagers to bring supplies for sale to the camp.\r\n\r\nIn Rohilcund, nothing could at present be effected to wrest the province\r\nfrom the enemy, until the Doab had been cleared from the host of rebels\r\nand marauders who infested it.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of certain columns in the Doab, both before and after\r\nSir Colin’s victory at Cawnpore, must here be noticed.\r\n\r\nColonel Seaton, during the month of November, was placed in command of a\r\ncolumn—consisting of one wing of the 1st Bengal Europeans, the 7th\r\nPunjaub infantry, a squadron of Carabiniers, Hodson’s Horse, a troop of\r\nhorse-artillery, and two companies of Sappers and Miners. Seaton started\r\nfrom Delhi, and worked his way southeastward, between the Jumna and the\r\nGanges, clearing off small portions of the enemy as he went. After\r\npicking up at Allygurh a small force from the Agra garrison under Major\r\nEld, he started again on the 13th of December, towards Etawah and\r\nMinpooree. The self-styled Rajah of Minpooree, who had fled at the\r\napproach of Greathed’s column in October, afterwards returned to his old\r\nhaunts, and expelled the officials established there by Greathed. His\r\npalace had been blown up, and his treasury and jewel-house looted; yet\r\nhe possessed influence enough to collect a band of retainers in his\r\nservice. To punish this rebel was one of the duties intrusted to Colonel\r\nSeaton. On the 14th, he fell in with a body of the insurgents, 4000\r\nstrong, at Gunjeree, on a small stream called the Neem Nuddee. His\r\ncolumn suddenly surprised them, disordered them by a brilliant charge of\r\nCarabiniers, and drove them in confusion along the Futteghur\r\nroad—capturing several guns on the way. Hodson’s Horse cut down many of\r\nthem during a brief pursuit. On the 15th, the column marched to\r\nKhasgunj, and on the 16th to Sahawur—in each case only to learn that the\r\nenemy had just fled. Seaton, determined not to give them up readily,\r\nmarched on to Putialah, several miles further on the Furruckabad road,\r\nwhere he came up with them on the morning of the 17th. They were drawn\r\nup in a good position, with their centre and left posted behind ravines,\r\nand their right abutting on a tope of trees in front of the village.\r\nAfter having caused this position to be well reconnoitred by Captain\r\nHodson and Lieutenant Greathed, Colonel Seaton began the contest with a\r\nsharp fire of light artillery, to which the enemy promptly responded. He\r\nthen ordered the cavalry round to the right, to avoid the ravines, and\r\nto attack the enemy in flank. While this was being done, the infantry,\r\ndeploying into line, advanced boldly on the enemy’s right, charged with\r\nthe bayonet, and speedily drove them out of the tope and village. The\r\nrout was complete, the cavalry having got round beyond the ravines, and\r\nreached a point whence they could pursue the fleeing enemy. Thirteen\r\nguns, camp-equipage, baggage, ammunition, and stores fell into the hands\r\nof the conquerors; while no less than 600 of the enemy were computed to\r\nhave fallen in the field or during the pursuit. Leaving Furruckabad and\r\nits chieftain to be dealt with by Sir Colin Campbell, Colonel Seaton\r\nmoved on towards Minpooree. He found the enemy awaiting him, posted a\r\nmile west of the city, with their front screened by large trees, under\r\ncover of which their guns opened upon the column as it came up. Seaton,\r\nby a flank-movement, disconcerted them, and they commenced a retreat,\r\nwhich resulted in the loss of six guns and a large number of men. The\r\ncolonel at once took possession of Minpooree.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Showers, another officer to whom the management of a column\r\nwas intrusted, started, like Seaton, from Delhi, and, like him, sought\r\nto regain towns and districts which had long been a prey to misrule.\r\nThis column began its operations in October, and during the following\r\nmonth returned to Delhi, after having retaken Nunoond, Dadree, and other\r\nplaces southwest of the city, together with many lacs of rupees which\r\nthe rebels had looted from the several treasuries of the Company.\r\nBetween Delhi and the Sutlej, General Van Cortlandt maintained\r\ntranquillity by the aid of a small force. Colonel Gerrard was the\r\ncommander of another small column; consisting of one European regiment\r\nand a miscellaneous body of native troops. With this he marched to\r\nRewaree, and thence to the town of Narnoul in Jhujjur, where a rebel\r\nchief, Sunnand Khan, had taken post with a number of armed retainers.\r\nGerrard defeated them, and captured their stronghold, but his own\r\ngallant life was forfeited. Another small force, divided into\r\ndetachments according to the services required, took charge of the\r\ntriangular space of country included between Agra, Muttra, and Allygurh.\r\nColonel Riddell and Major Eld moved about actively within this space—now\r\nwatching the movements of rebellious chieftains, now cutting off the\r\nadvance of mutineers from Rohilcund.\r\n\r\nColonel Walpole of the Rifle Brigade, in the higher capacity of\r\nbrigadier, was intrusted by Sir Colin Campbell with the command of a\r\ncolumn, consisting of H.M. 88th foot, two battalions of the Rifle\r\nBrigade, three squadrons of the 9th Lancers, the 1st Punjaub cavalry,\r\nBourchier’s battery, and Blunt’s troop of horse-artillery. His duty was\r\nto sweep along the western half of the Doab, near the Jumna, and clear\r\nit of rebels. He started from Cawnpore on the 18th of December, and on\r\nthe following day reached Akburpore, half-way to Calpee. Here he\r\nremained a few days, settling the surrounding country, which had long\r\nbeen disturbed by the Gwalior mutineers. From thence he proceeded\r\ntowards Etawah, to clear the country in the direction of Agra and\r\nDholpore.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that, while Sir Colin was engaged in the larger\r\noperations at Lucknow and Cawnpore, and soon after the completion of\r\nthose operations, small columns of troops were marching and fighting in\r\nvarious parts of the Northwest Provinces, clearing away bands of\r\ninsurgents. The mutinied sepoy regiments still kept together in large\r\nbodies, mostly in Oude or on its borders; the insurgents here adverted\r\nto were rather marauders and plunderers, who were influenced very little\r\neither by creed or by nationality in taking up arms; they were retainers\r\nof ambitious petty chieftains, or they were reckless men, who hoped in\r\nthe scramble to enrich themselves with plunder.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief himself took the field just before the close of\r\nthe year. Having made arrangements for the security of Cawnpore after\r\nthe great victory over the Gwalior mutineers, and having marked out\r\nseparate paths of duty to be followed by Seaton, Walpole, Hope Grant,\r\nFranks, Rowcroft, and other officers, he directed his attention towards\r\nFurruckabad, which had long been in hostile hands. This city, near the\r\npoint of junction of Oude, Rohilcund, and the Doab, it was important to\r\nplace again under British control. Colonel Seaton was ordered to direct\r\nhis march towards that point, after other operations in the Doab; and\r\nSir Colin now arranged to co-operate with him. Leaving Cawnpore in the\r\nlast week of December, he marched up the great trunk-road, by way of\r\nMeerun-ke-Serai. It was not, however, until the year 1858 had arrived,\r\nthat Campbell, Walpole, and Seaton, meeting from various points,\r\neffected a thorough capture of Furruckabad, and of the long deserted\r\ncantonment at Futteghur. Here, however, as in many other quarters, the\r\ncommander-in-chief had to bear the vexation of losing his prey; the\r\nenemy, wonderfully alert in their movements, escaped from those places\r\njust before he reached them; he captured both the towns, but the enemy\r\nwere still at large to fight elsewhere.\r\n\r\nLet us on to Delhi.\r\n\r\nEver since the conquest in September, the imperial city had gradually\r\nassumed a state somewhat more orderly than was possible immediately\r\nafter the siege. Many weeks after the conquest, when the _Delhi Gazette_\r\nhad again got into working-order, it contained a graphic account of the\r\ncity in its condition at that time. On the road from Kurnaul to Delhi\r\nwas an almost continuous line of dead carcasses of camels, horses, and\r\nbullocks, with their skins dried into parchment over the mouldering\r\nbones. Here and there were remains of intrenchments, where battles had\r\nbeen fought on the road. From Badulla Serai to the Lahore Gate of the\r\ncity every tree was either levelled with the ground, or the branches\r\nlopped off with round-shot. The garden-houses of the wealthy citizens\r\nwere in almost every instance masses of ruins, with the bleaching\r\nremains of men and beasts around them. Here and there might be seen a\r\nperfectly white skeleton of a human being; while on all sides lay\r\nscattered fragments of red and blue clothing, cartouch-boxes,\r\nround-shot, fragments of shell, and grape-shot. Near the Subzee Mundee\r\nevery tree was a mere bare trunk, with the branches and foliage gone,\r\nand shot-marks visible all around. The gaily ornamented residences near\r\nat hand were masses of blackened ruins, with sand-bags and loopholed\r\nscreens which told of many a scene of fiery warfare. With the exception\r\nof the Moree Bastion and the Cashmere Gate, the northern wall of the\r\ncity did not exhibit much evidence of devastation. The Cashmere Gate\r\nbreach had been repaired. The mainguard was wholly destroyed. St James’s\r\nChurch was full of shot-holes, even up to the ball and cross. Most of\r\nthe houses in this part of the city were utter ruins, some blackened as\r\nif by fire. The Bank, formerly the residence of the Begum Sumroo, had\r\nnothing but the walls and fragments of verandah remaining; and in a like\r\nstate was the house of Sir T. Metcalfe. In the narrow street leading\r\nfrom Skinner’s house to the Chandnee Chowk, every house bore visible\r\nproof of the showers of musket-balls that must have fallen; and every\r\ndoor was completely riddled. The roads were still cut up with shot and\r\nshell furrows. In many of the streets might be seen the _débris_ of\r\narchways, which had been built up by the city people, but broken into by\r\nour troops. Shop-doors and huge gates lay about in all directions, many\r\nof which were well backed up by heavy stone-work, logs of wood, &c.; and\r\nremains of sand-bag defences were numerous. In short, the city shewed\r\nthat it had been obstinately defended, and that its conquest must have\r\nbeen terrible work for besiegers as well as besieged.\r\n\r\nThe aged king and his family still continued to be the subjects of\r\nnewspaper gossip, mostly in a strain of fierce invective against the\r\nauthorities for shewing lenity. It was stated in a former chapter,[130]\r\nthat Mrs Hodson, wife to the gallant officer who had captured the king,\r\nmade public the result of a visit to the royal captives, as shewing that\r\nno undue luxury marked their prison-life. But still the charges and\r\ninsinuations continued. Newspaper paragraphs circulated the news that\r\nJumma Bukht, son or grandson of the king, was allowed to ride about the\r\nstreets of Delhi on an elephant, with an English colonel behind him; and\r\nthat indulgence was granted to men whose only desert was speedy hanging.\r\nCaptain (Major) Hodson himself made public a refutation of this charge,\r\nshewing the absurd way in which a very trifling incident had been\r\nmagnified into a state proceeding. A military commission was appointed\r\nto try such leaders of the mutiny as were captured in or near Delhi. By\r\nsentence of this tribunal, twenty subordinate members of the royal\r\nfamily were executed on the 18th of November. Shortly afterwards,\r\nvarious chiefs of Goorgaon, Jhujjur, and Babulgurh were similarly put\r\nupon their trial, and sentenced according to the strength of the\r\nevidence brought against them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  St James’s Church, Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe subject of prize-money remained for many weeks, or even months,\r\ninvolved in much controversy in Delhi. Notwithstanding the ruin and\r\ndevastation, the amount of property recovered was very large, including\r\nforfeitures declared against those who were convicted of treason. This\r\nwealth reverted to the state, as a slight set-off for the vast expenses\r\nincurred. Some of the officers and soldiers, however, fondly hoped that\r\nit would be regarded as booty for the troops; and were thrown rather\r\ninto discontent by an announcement that the reward of the conquerors of\r\nDelhi was to consist of six months’ ‘batta’ or pay. It was just one of\r\nthose questions on which much might be said on both sides. By a\r\nsubsequent arrangement, much of the personal property lately belonging\r\nto the rebels was set apart, and treated as prize-money to be shared by\r\nthe soldiers engaged in the capture.\r\n\r\nThe leniency question, the prize-money question, and the paucity of\r\nreward to the engineer officers engaged in the siege of Delhi, were\r\namong many subjects made matter for controversy during the later weeks\r\nof the year. But these we may pass over without further comment. Suffice\r\nit to say that the reconquered city remained in British hands, and was\r\ngradually brought under the control of the British authorities. As to\r\nthe aged king, preparations were made for subjecting him to a regular\r\ntrial, to be commenced shortly after the arrival of the new year.\r\n\r\nOf the Punjaub, little need be said. Happily for British interests in\r\nIndia, the same powerful mind continued to wield the destinies of the\r\nremote province. Sir John Lawrence, watchful over everything that\r\noccurred, not only maintained the Punjaub in quiet, but sent frequent\r\nreinforcements to other provinces. During the summer and autumn, the\r\nnumber of Sikh and Punjaubee regiments which he raised was something\r\nmarvellous. Occasionally some of the wild tribes exhibited signs of\r\ninsubordination; but they were met with such a determined front, and\r\nthey received so little sympathy from the mass of the people, that their\r\nturbulence fell harmless. John Lawrence saved the Punjaub, and the\r\nPunjaub saved British India.\r\n\r\nIn all the portion of the empire included within the Saugor territories,\r\nBundelcund, the Mahratta states, and Rajpootana, the months of November\r\nand December differed from the previous months principally in this\r\ncircumstance—that the new mutinies were fewer, because the materials for\r\nmutiny were becoming exhausted; but that the battles were more numerous,\r\nbecause small armies were gradually being sent up from Madras and\r\nBombay.\r\n\r\nIn October and November, many military operations in the Mahratta and\r\nSaugor countries were placed in doubt, so far as concerned the\r\ncomprehension of them in England, by a difference of only one letter in\r\nthe names of two commanders. The movements of Brigadier Steuart were\r\noften attributed to Brigadier Stuart, and _vice versâ_. Steuart\r\ncommanded a column in the Deccan, which marched to Hosungabad, and then\r\nacross the Nerbudda to Sehore. His duty was to protect Saugor on the\r\nright, Indore on the left, and Bhopal in the centre. By these movements,\r\nSaugor and Jubbulpoor were rendered tolerably safe. Holkar, at Indore,\r\nwas sadly troubled by the mutinous feeling among his own troops. In\r\norder to maintain British influence in that important quarter, the\r\nBombay government organised a new column, which, strengthened by other\r\ntroops, would form a Malwah Field Force, to be placed under the command\r\nof Sir Hugh Rose; while Sir Robert Hamilton was ordered to resume his\r\nold appointment as British resident at Holkar’s court.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Stuart, portions of whose column were engaged in and near\r\nNeemuch, Mundisore, Dhar, Mehidpore, Rampoora, and Kotah in October,\r\nswept off many parties of rebels from the regions bordering on Malwah\r\nand Rajpootana. Nevertheless the state of affairs remained very\r\nunsettled. Many petty chieftains, incited by the numerical weakness of\r\nthe British, and by the unexpected stand made by rebels elsewhere,\r\nappeared by tacit agreement to consider this the proper time to set up\r\nas little kings on their own account, each relying on the services of\r\nretainers who probably thought that something good might come to their\r\nshare in the scramble.\r\n\r\nAt a somewhat later date, when Stuart was in command of the Malwah Field\r\nForce, before its name was changed to the ‘First Brigade of the Nerbudda\r\nField Force,’ he had a contest with the Mundisore rebels. Being joined\r\nby a portion of the Hyderabad Contingent under Major Orr, Stuart\r\napproached within three or four miles of Mundisore on the 21st of\r\nNovember. This town is a few miles south of Neemuch, on the road to\r\nIndore. The brigadier encamped until a good reconnaissance could be\r\neffected. The rebel enemy at Mundisore, hearing of his approach, had\r\nposted pickets entirely covering the country over which he was\r\nadvancing; they also mustered in some force outside the walls, and\r\nappeared inclined to attack. In the afternoon he found that the enemy\r\nwere advancing in form, threatening his centre and both flanks at the\r\nsame time. They advanced steadily, in great numbers and with banners\r\nflying: and he went forth to meet them. The struggle was a brief one.\r\nMajor Orr easily repulsed the enemy’s attack on the left flank; Captain\r\nOrr and Lieutenant Dew checked that on the right; a few rounds of\r\nartillery preserved the centre; and the enemy, giving way at all points,\r\nretreated into the town. Brigadier Stuart had now another matter to\r\nconsider. He heard that a rebel army of 5000 men, employed in besieging\r\nNeemuch, intended to raise the siege, and to join their companions at\r\nMundisore. This he resolved to prevent if possible by intercepting them.\r\nAccordingly, early on the 22d, he marched to such a position as would\r\ncommand the approaches to Mundisore; and later in the day his cavalry\r\nwere engaged with a party of rebel horse under Heera Singh—one of many\r\nRajpoot chieftains who took up arms at that disturbed period. Keeping a\r\nsharp watch during the night, Stuart prepared on the morning of the 23d\r\nto control the Neemuch and Mundisore road both from the north and the\r\nsouth. The enemy appeared, and took up a strong position with their\r\nright in and beyond the village of Goraria, their right centre covered\r\nby a date nullah and lines of date-trees, their battery of six guns on\r\nrising ground, with a large mud-hut protecting their gunners, and their\r\nleft stretched along the ridge running east from the village. The battle\r\nthat ensued was a very severe one. Stuart was obliged to recall a body\r\nof infantry, who charged a village that seemed full of the enemy; the\r\nrebels took possession of the houses, from which they kept up a very\r\ngalling fire. The British could doubtless have taken the village; but\r\nthe brigadier found his rear attacked by a second body of the enemy,\r\nrequiring a new distribution of his troops. The engagements of this day\r\nresulted in a sort of drawn battle. On the 24th, the village was shelled\r\nfor three hours; and was then captured by H.M. 86th and a native\r\nregiment, with considerable loss on both sides. During the ensuing night\r\nthe enemy evacuated Mundisore and the whole vicinity, dispersing in\r\nflight throughout the country, after having lost at least fifteen\r\nhundred men during the four days. The brigadier then moved his camp to\r\nMundisore, and made arrangements for dismantling the fort and destroying\r\nthe guns before leaving the neighbourhood. By this series of operations,\r\nnot only was Mundisore cleared of rebels, but Neemuch was relieved from\r\na force which pressed very threateningly upon it.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Neemuch must now be noticed. The small English garrison at\r\nthis station had for months been threatened by the Mundisore rebels; but\r\nit was not until the 8th of November that a formidable attack was\r\nactually made. A force of 5000 infantry, with three guns, advanced to\r\nwithin two miles of the town; and as it was impossible to meet such\r\nnumbers in the open field, Captain Simpson prepared for the best defence\r\nhe could make within the fort. Intrenchments had been formed some time\r\nbefore; but unfortunately they were too extensive to be effectively\r\ndefended by the few hands in the garrison; and they thus speedily became\r\noccupied by the enemy. On the 9th, the enemy marched in full force into\r\nthe bazaar and cantonment, plundering wherever they went. They then\r\nplaced their guns at convenient distances, and began playing steadily\r\nagainst the fort. This cannonading was continued for several days. The\r\nrebels managed to build batteries for their guns in such positions that,\r\nfrom the foliage and other obstacles, they were unobservable from the\r\nwalls of the fort. After about a fortnight of this battering, the rebels\r\nresolved to attempt an escalade. They brought forward huge ladders on\r\nwheels, affording room for four men abreast, and placed them against the\r\nwalls of the fort; but here they were met by such steady and continuous\r\nvolleys of musketry that not a man could enter. A Beloochee Mohammedan,\r\nbelonging to the 12th Bombay native infantry, doing duty in Neemuch,\r\nperformed an act of gallantry that won for him much and well-deserved\r\napplause. One of the besiegers, in retreating from the withering\r\nmusketry-fire from the fort, dropped a splendid Mussulman green flag on\r\nthe ground. The Beloochee at once offered to capture this flag. Under\r\ncover of a tremendous fire of musketry, he and a havildar were lowered\r\nby a rope from one of the enclosures; quick as lightning the flag was\r\nsecured, and in a few minutes waved on the walls of Neemuch. The\r\nmovements of Brigadier Stuart, recorded in the last paragraph, now\r\ndisturbed the rebels; they departed, and Neemuch was for a time spared\r\nfurther molestation.\r\n\r\nThis narrative may pass over without particular mention the other\r\nregions of the vast empire of India. Disturbances there were in November\r\nand December, but not of such grave importance as to call for record. At\r\nSaugor and at Jubbulpore, the Europeans cried loudly for more troops,\r\nbut they were still able to defend themselves against actual attacks. At\r\nGwalior and at Bhopal, at Indore and at Mhow, although the vexations\r\nwere many, the continued fidelity of Scindia and Holkar lessened the\r\ncalamities that might otherwise have befallen the British. In Rajpootana\r\nand Gujerat, petty chieftains would from time to time unfurl the flag of\r\nrebellion, and collect a band of fighting retainers around them; but\r\nthese territories were within practicable reach of Bombay, whence\r\ncolumns marched for the pacification of the upper country. Some portions\r\nof the Nizam’s territory were occasionally troubled by insubordinate\r\ntroops belonging to the contingent; as the Nizam and his prime-minister,\r\nhowever, remained firm in their alliance with the British, and as the\r\ndistance was very great to the turbulent regions of the Jumna, serious\r\ndanger was averted. In the South Mahratta country, around Kolapore,\r\nSholapore, Satara, and Poonah, indications once now and then appeared\r\nthat fanatic Mohammedans were ready to unfurl the green flag against the\r\ninfidel Feringhees; but the near vicinity of the presidential city of\r\nBombay, and the quiet demeanour of the natives further south, prevented\r\nthe intended conspiracies from becoming serious in magnitude. In the\r\nMadras presidency, tranquillity was almost wholly undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThus ended the extraordinary year 1857—the most momentous that the\r\nEnglish had ever experienced in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  _Proposed Re-organisation of the Indian Army._—In closing the\r\n  narrative for the year 1857, it may be useful to advert to two\r\n  important subjects which occupied the attention of the East India\r\n  Company—the state of the army, and the causes of the mutiny. Instead\r\n  of rushing to conclusions on imperfect data, the Court of Directors\r\n  instructed the governor-general to appoint two commissions of\r\n  inquiry, empowered to collect information on those two subjects. The\r\n  letters of instruction were both dated the 25th of November; the\r\n  first ran as follows:\r\n\r\n  ‘1. We trust that when success, by the blessing of Divine\r\n  Providence, shall have attended your efforts to put down the\r\n  mutiny of the native army of your presidency, and to re-establish\r\n  the authority of the government in the disturbed districts, you\r\n  will be enabled to take advantage of the services of select\r\n  officers of ability and experience, to assist you, by\r\n  investigation and by practical counsel founded thereon, in forming\r\n  wise conclusions on the most important subject which must soon\r\n  press for decision—namely, the proper organisation of our army in\r\n  India.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. To this end we authorise you to appoint, as soon as\r\n  circumstances will permit, a commission, composed of military\r\n  officers of the armies of the three presidencies (with whom should\r\n  be associated officers of the Queen’s army who have had experience\r\n  of Indian service), on whose knowledge, experience, and judgment you\r\n  can rely; together with one or more civil servants, whom you may\r\n  consider to be specially qualified for such a duty by their\r\n  knowledge of the native character and general administrative\r\n  experience.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. In framing instructions for the guidance of this commission, we\r\n  are desirous that the following heads of inquiry should be\r\n  specified, in addition to any others which you may consider to\r\n  deserve their attention:\r\n\r\n  ‘1st, Should corps be raised each in a prescribed district, and be\r\n  recruited there, and there only?\r\n\r\n  ‘2d, Should corps be composed of troops or companies, each of which\r\n  shall consist of separate tribes or castes; or should the tribes or\r\n  castes be mixed up together in the whole regiment?\r\n\r\n  ‘3d, Should a company or companies of Europeans form a component\r\n  part of a native regiment?\r\n\r\n  ‘4th, What alterations should be made in your recruiting regulations\r\n  relating to tribes and castes, with a view to determine the future\r\n  composition of the native army?\r\n\r\n  ‘5th, Will it be expedient to enlist natives of other tropical\r\n  countries, equally qualified for service in India, with the natives\r\n  of the country; and if so, should they be formed in separate\r\n  regiments, or in companies, or otherwise?\r\n\r\n  ‘6th, Whether, in native infantry regiments, the discontinuance of\r\n  the grades of native commissioned officers, and the substitution of\r\n  a European sergeant and corporal to each company, is advisable; and\r\n  if so, whether, in lieu of the prospect of distinction and emolument\r\n  arising out of these grades, it would be advisable to establish\r\n  graduated scales of good-service pay and retiring pensions,\r\n  claimable after specified periods of service?\r\n\r\n  ‘7th, Whether the system of promotion generally, by seniority, to\r\n  the grades of native commissioned officers (if these are retained),\r\n  should not be altered and assimilated to the systems in force at\r\n  Madras and Bombay?\r\n\r\n  ‘8th, If separate corps are to be maintained for military and police\r\n  purposes, what will be the best organisation for each branch\r\n  respectively?\r\n\r\n  ‘9th, Have the powers of commanding officers of native corps, and\r\n  the powers of officers in charge of companies, been diminished? What\r\n  consequences have been the result? Is it desirable that those powers\r\n  should be increased, or what other measures should be adopted for\r\n  the improvement of discipline?\r\n\r\n  ‘10th, Should cadets be trained and drilled in European regiments\r\n  before they are posted to native regiments; or what would be the\r\n  best mode of drilling and training cadets before they are posted to\r\n  native regiments?\r\n\r\n  ‘11th, Should the special rules regulating punishment in the native\r\n  army be retained; or should they be assimilated to the rules which\r\n  obtain in the British army; or ought there to be any, and what,\r\n  changes in those rules, or in the system of punishment?\r\n\r\n  ‘12th, How can the demands for European officers for staff and\r\n  detached employments be best provided for, without injuring the\r\n  efficiency of regiments?\r\n\r\n  ‘4. It is to be understood that the inquiries to be made by the\r\n  commission, and the opinions to be offered by them, are to have\r\n  reference to the several branches of the native army—infantry,\r\n  regular and irregular; cavalry, regular and irregular; artillery,\r\n  and Sappers and Miners; and, with respect to the artillery, and\r\n  Sappers and Miners, whether they should be composed, as heretofore,\r\n  of Europeans and natives, or be entirely European?\r\n\r\n  ‘5. To aid your government in forming an opinion as to the\r\n  proportion which the European should bear to the native portion of\r\n  the army in India generally, and at each presidency separately, we\r\n  would recommend that your government should call upon the commission\r\n  to give their opinions on this very important question; and we can\r\n  entertain no doubt that the enlarged knowledge and experience of the\r\n  members of the Commission will enable them to furnish you with\r\n  valuable information on this head.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. Having obtained opinions on all these heads of inquiry, and on\r\n  such other heads as you may deem to be essential to the thorough\r\n  development of the important questions at issue, you will refer\r\n  the views of the commission for the consideration of the\r\n  commander-in-chief, and will then furnish us with the results of\r\n  your careful deliberation upon the whole of the measures which\r\n  should, in your judgment, be taken for the organisation and\r\n  maintenance, in the utmost practicable state of efficiency, of\r\n  whatever military force you may think it desirable to form.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. The commission itself may be instructed to make to the\r\n  governor-general in council any suggestions or recommendations which\r\n  occur to them, although not on matters comprised in the specified\r\n  heads of inquiry.’\r\n\r\n  _Proposed Inquiry into the Causes of the Mutiny._—The second letter\r\n  adverted to above was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n  ‘1. Although we are well aware that, from the period when the mutiny\r\n  of the Bengal army assumed a formidable aspect, your time must\r\n  necessarily have been too much engrossed by the pressing exigencies\r\n  of the public-service during each passing day, and in taking\r\n  provident measures for the future, to admit of your directing much\r\n  of your attention to past events, we have no doubt that you have not\r\n  omitted to take advantage of all the means and opportunities at your\r\n  command for the important purpose of investigating the causes of the\r\n  extraordinary disaffection in the ranks of that army, which has,\r\n  unhappily, given rise to so much bloodshed and misery.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. In this persuasion, and as a review of the voluminous records\r\n  containing the details of the events which have occurred since the\r\n  first display of disaffection at Barrackpore, has entirely failed to\r\n  satisfy our minds in regard to the immediate causes of the mutiny,\r\n  we desire that you will lose no time in reporting to us your\r\n  opinions on the subject, embracing the following heads, together\r\n  with any others which you may deem it necessary to add, in order to\r\n  the full elucidation of the subject:\r\n\r\n  ‘1st, The state of feeling of the sepoy towards the government for\r\n  some time preceding the outbreak.\r\n\r\n  ‘2d, Any causes which of late years may be thought likely to have\r\n  affected their loyalty and devotion to the service.\r\n\r\n  ‘3d, Whether their loyalty had been affected by the instigations of\r\n  emissaries of foreign powers, or native states, or by any general\r\n  measures of our administration affecting themselves or any other\r\n  classes of our subjects?\r\n\r\n  ‘4th, Whether the proposed use of the new cartridges was to any, and\r\n  what, extent the cause of the outbreak?\r\n\r\n  ‘5th, Whether the objects which the mutineers are supposed to have\r\n  had in view were directed to the subversion of the British power in\r\n  India, or to the attainment of pecuniary or other advantages?\r\n\r\n  ‘6th, Whether the progress of the mutiny can be traced to general\r\n  combination or concert, or was the result of separate impulses at\r\n  the several stations of regiments; and, if the former, how the\r\n  combination was carried on without any knowledge or suspicion of it\r\n  on the part of the regimental officers?\r\n\r\n  ‘3. If, however, you should not feel yourselves to be in possession\r\n  of information sufficient to form a well-grounded opinion upon the\r\n  causes and objects of the mutiny, we authorise you to appoint a\r\n  special mixed commission for a preliminary investigation into the\r\n  same, to be composed of officers selected from all branches of the\r\n  services of India, in whose personal experience and soundness of\r\n  judgment you have entire confidence. In that case, you will lose no\r\n  time in reporting to us your sentiments upon the conclusions arrived\r\n  at by the commission.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xvii., pp. 277-294; chap. xx., pp. 338-358.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  See p. 103.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xxi., p. 369.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  ‘We marched off under the guidance of a native, who said he would take\r\n  us to the spot where the gun lay. We told him he should be well\r\n  rewarded if he brought us to the gun, but if he brought us into a\r\n  trap, we had a soldier by him “at full cock” ready to blow his brains\r\n  out. We passed our outside pickets, and entered the town through very\r\n  narrow streets without a single nigger being seen, or a shot fired on\r\n  either side. We crept along; not a soul spoke a word, all was still as\r\n  death; and after marching in this way into the very heart of the town,\r\n  our guide brought us to the very spot into which the gun was capsized.\r\n  The soldiers were posted on each side, and then we went to work. Not a\r\n  man spoke above his breath, and each stone was laid down quietly. When\r\n  we thought we had cleared enough, I ordered the men to put their\r\n  shoulders to the wheel and gun, and when all was ready, and every man\r\n  had his pound before him, I said “Heave!” and up she righted. We then\r\n  limbered up, called the soldiers to follow, and we marched into the\r\n  intrenchments with our gun without a shot being fired. When we got in,\r\n  the colonel returned us his best thanks, and gave us all an extra\r\n  ration of grog; we then returned to our guns in the battery.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  The regiments or portions of regiments—made up into four brigades of\r\n  infantry, one of cavalry, one of artillery, and one of engineers—were\r\n  the following: H.M. 8th, 23d, 32d, 38th, 42d, 53d, 64th, 82d, and 93d\r\n  foot; Rifle Brigade; 2d and 4th Punjaub infantry; H.M. 9th Lancers;\r\n  1st, 2d, and 5th Punjaub cavalry; Hodson’s Horse; horse-artillery;\r\n  light field-battery; heavy field-battery; Naval brigade; Queen’s and\r\n  Company’s Engineers; Sappers and Miners.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n                        42d Highlanders,     403\r\n                        53d foot,            413\r\n                        93d Highlanders,     806\r\n                        4th Punjaub rifles,  332\r\n                        9th Lancers,         327\r\n                        5th Punjaub cavalry,  85\r\n                        Hodson’s Horse,      109\r\n                        Horse-artillery,      83\r\n                        Foot-artillery,      139\r\n                        Sappers,             100\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  P. 356\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COLONEL E. H. GREATHED.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n                      A SECOND YEAR OF REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, at the opening of 1858, the stirring events of the preceding year\r\ncame to be passed in review, most men admitted that the progress of the\r\nIndian Revolt had outrun their expectations and falsified their hopes.\r\nSome had believed that the fall of Delhi would occur after a few days of\r\nbesieging, bringing with it a pacification of the whole country. Some,\r\nallowing that this capture might very probably be retarded several\r\nweeks, did not the less look to a general pacification as a natural\r\nresult. Others, relying on the heroic Havelock and the energetic Neill,\r\nprepared to date the termination of the rebellion from the expected\r\ncapture of Lucknow. Others, recognising Sir Colin Campbell as ‘the right\r\nman in the right place,’ strengthened themselves in the belief that he\r\nwould march at once from Calcutta to Cawnpore, and put down all the\r\nrebels before the summer was well over. Some believed that the sepoys,\r\nlamenting the ill success of their treachery to the British government,\r\nwould return to their allegiance without inoculating other portions of\r\nthe Indian community with the virus of lawlessness. Others had fondly\r\nhoped that, under the pressure of public opinion in England, such large\r\nnumbers of fine troops would have been sent over in the summer and\r\nautumn, as would suffice to quell the mutiny even though the sepoys\r\nremained obstinate.\r\n\r\nAll these hopes were dashed. The gloomy prophets, on this occasion, were\r\nin the ascendant. The mutiny had spread to almost every native regiment\r\nin the Bengal army. It had been accompanied by an unexpected display of\r\nmilitary organisation among the revolted sepoys. It had incited many\r\nambitious chieftains to try their chance for an increase of power. It\r\nhad been encouraged and extended by the long delay in the conquest of\r\nDelhi. It had further received a certain glow of triumph from the\r\nextraordinary events at Lucknow, which left the rebels perfect masters\r\nof the city at the end of the year. It had been permitted to grow to\r\nunwonted magnitude by the extreme slowness with which British troops\r\narrived at Indian ports. Lastly, it had become surrounded by very\r\nun-English attributes, in the savage feeling of vengeance engendered in\r\nthe minds of English officers and soldiers by the sepoy atrocities.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Englishmen had much to be proud of, in the achievements\r\nof their countrymen during the past year. They could point to the\r\nsagacity of Sir Henry Lawrence, in quietly fortifying and provisioning\r\nthe Residency at Lucknow at a time when less acute observers saw no\r\nstorm in the distance. They could admire, and wonder while they admired,\r\nthe heroism with which Sir Hugh Wheeler and his companions had so long\r\nmaintained a wretchedly weak position against a large army of mutineers\r\nheaded by an arch-traitor. They could follow with delight the footsteps\r\nof Sir Henry Havelock, winning victory after victory over forces five or\r\nten times as strong as his own. They could shew how, in a hot climate,\r\nNeill had advanced from the east and Nicholson from the west, fighting\r\nenergetically against all obstacles, and dying like true soldiers at the\r\nhead of their columns. They could ask the world whether a garrison was\r\never more nobly defended, under circumstances of trying difficulty, than\r\nthe Residency under Inglis; and whether a garrison was ever brought away\r\nfrom the middle of a hostile city under more extraordinary conditions,\r\nand with more complete success, than was achieved in the ‘Exodus from\r\nLucknow’ under Campbell, Outram, and Havelock. They could point to Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence for an example of what a civilian could do, maintaining a\r\nlarge and recently conquered country at peace by the energy of his own\r\nindividual character, raising regiment after regiment of trustworthy\r\nnative troops, and sending an army to reconquer Delhi before a single\r\nadditional soldier could arrive from England. They could point to the\r\nexertions of numerous individuals, any one of whom would have been a\r\nhero if his heroism had not been eclipsed by that of men better known to\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThese recollections afforded some consolation under the disappointment\r\noccasioned by the long continuance of the war waged by the mutineers.\r\nYet were they far from being an adequate reward for the blood and\r\ntreasure expended; the prevailing natural feeling was one of\r\ndisappointment. Nor were theorists less at fault in their estimate of\r\ncauses, than practical men in their expectation of results. Still was\r\nthe question put, ‘What was the cause of the mutiny?’ And still were the\r\nanswers as diverse as ever. From May to December the theories multiplied\r\nfaster than the means of solving them. On the religious side, men banded\r\nthemselves chiefly into two parties. One said that the native troops in\r\nIndia had revolted because we, as a nation, had tampered with their\r\nreligion. We had nearly put down infanticide and suttee; we paid less\r\nrespect than formerly to their idols and holy places; we had allowed\r\npious officers to preach to the sepoys in their regiments, and\r\nmissionaries to inveigh against brahmins and temples; and we so clumsily\r\nmanaged a new contrivance in the fabrication and use of cartridges, as\r\nto induce a suspicion in the native mind that a personal insult to their\r\nreligious prejudices was intended. On the other hand, religious\r\nChristians contended that the revolt was a mark of God’s anger against\r\nthe English nation. They urged that a people possessing the Bible ought\r\nlong ago, by government as well as by individual efforts, to have\r\ndistributed it throughout the length and breadth of India; that we ought\r\nto have encouraged churches and chapels, ministers and missionaries,\r\nBible-classes and Scripture-readers; that we ought to have disregarded\r\ncaste prejudices, and boldly proclaimed that Hindooism and Moslemism\r\nwere worse than mockeries, and that no expectations of happiness in this\r\nlife or the next were sound but such as rested on Biblical grounds—in\r\nshort, that England had had a magnificent opportunity, and a deep\r\nobligation, to teach with all her power the way of salvation to two\r\nhundred million benighted beings; and that, failing this, the Revolt had\r\nbeen a consequent and deserved calamity. Another class of reasoners\r\nattributed the outbreak to the want of sympathy between the Europeans\r\nand the natives in the general relations of life. A young man was sent\r\nout to India by the Company, either as a writer in the civil service or\r\nas a cadet in the army; he learned the immediate duties of his office,\r\nstudied just so much of the vernacular languages and customs as were\r\nabsolutely needed, rose in the middle years of his life to higher\r\noffices and emoluments, and returned to end his days in England. He held\r\nthe natives in contempt; he neither knew nor cared what passed in their\r\ninmost hearts; he treated India as a conquered country, held especially\r\nfor the benefit of the Company’s servants. Hence, according to the view\r\nnow under notice, the natives, having nothing for which to love and\r\nrespect the British, were glad to avail themselves of any pretext to\r\nexpel the foreign element from their land. Military men, acquainted with\r\nthe Bombay and Madras armies, insisted that the mutiny had arisen from\r\nthe organisation of that of Bengal; in which the Brahmin sepoys and\r\nRajpoot sowars had been so pampered and petted, that they began to deem\r\nthemselves masters instead of subjects, and to aim at a sort of military\r\ndespotism on their own account. Other speculators, pointing to the fact\r\nthat Mohammedans have in all ages been intensely fanatical, regarded the\r\nmutiny as only one among many indications of an attempt to revive the\r\npast glories of the Moguls, when the followers of Mahomet were the\r\nrulers in India. Others again, keeping clear of the larger questions of\r\ncreed and race, attributed the troubles to the policy of annexation,\r\nwhich had been pursued to so extraordinary a degree in recent years.\r\nThese reasoners urged that, whatever may have been the faults and\r\nfollies of the King of Oude, five million natives unquestionably looked\r\nup to him as their sovereign, and felt their prejudices shocked and\r\ntheir alarm excited, when, in 1856, he was rudely hurled from his\r\nthrone, and made a pensioner dependent on a company of merchants.\r\nAnother class of theorists, impressed with a horror of taxation, pitied\r\nthe poor Hindoos who had to pay so much to the Company for permission to\r\nlive on the soil, so much for the salt monopoly, so much for other dues;\r\nand sought to find a reason for the mutiny in the desire to throw off\r\nthese imposts. Commercial men, estimating nations and countries by a\r\nstandard familiar to themselves, had long complained that the Company\r\ndid not encourage independent commerce in India; and now they said: ‘If\r\nyou had acted with English good sense, the revolt would never have\r\noccurred. Afford facilities for the construction of railways, canals,\r\nand docks; build ships and steamers; develop your mineral wealth in coal\r\nand iron; sell or let plots of land to men who will bring English\r\nexperience and English machinery to bear on its cultivation; grow tea\r\nand coffee, sugar and cocoa, timber and fruits, cotton and flax, corn\r\nand pulse, on the soils favourable to the respective produce—do all\r\nthis, or afford facilities for others to do it, and the natives of India\r\nwill then have something more profitable to think of than mutiny and\r\nbloodshed.’\r\n\r\nWe point to these various theories for the purpose of remarking, that\r\nthe controversies relating to them were as warmly conducted at the end\r\nof the year as when the news of the cartridge troubles first reached\r\nEngland. The higher the position, the more extensive the experience, of\r\npublic men, the more chary were they in committing themselves to any\r\nspecial modes of explanation; it was by those who knew little, that the\r\nboldest assertions were hazarded. An opinion was gradually growing up\r\namong cautious reasoners, that the revolt must have been the composite\r\nresultant of many co-ordinate or coexistent causes, each of which\r\ncontributed towards it in a particular way; but such reasoners would\r\nnecessarily perceive that a true solution could only be arrived at when\r\nall the separate items were known, and properly estimated. Hence the\r\nauthorities, both in England and in India, recommended and followed a\r\nplan that may thus be enunciated—first suppress the mutiny; then collect\r\ngradually evidence of its various predisposing causes; and, finally,\r\nmake use of that evidence in remodelling the institutions of British\r\nIndia on a firmer basis. The NOTES at the end of the last chapter shewed\r\nthat the Company took the common-sense view, of inquiring into the\r\nprobable causes of the mutiny before planning the reorganisation of\r\nIndian affairs. The candid acknowledgment by the Directors, that the\r\nvoluminous documents hitherto produced had ‘entirely failed to satisfy\r\ntheir minds in regard to the immediate causes of the mutiny,’ was full\r\nof significance, and, it may be added, of caution to others.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the present Chronicle, the treatment will necessarily\r\nbe affected by the character of the struggle. At the beginning of 1858,\r\nscarcely any symptoms of further mutiny were presented. The Bengal army\r\nwas gone, scattered in anarchy; the armies of Bombay, Madras, and the\r\nPunjaub, were almost wholly sound; and the daily events consisted mainly\r\nof military operations against the revolted sepoy regiments of the\r\nBengal army, and against such chieftains as had brought their retainers\r\ninto the field for selfish purposes. Hence the narrative may march on\r\nmore rapidly than before.\r\n\r\nAll the interest of the military operations in India, at the opening of\r\nthe new year, grouped itself around the commander-in-chief. Slow as had\r\nbeen the arrival of British troops in India, during the months when\r\nWheeler, Havelock, Neill, Outram, Inglis, Barnard, Wilson, and Nicholson\r\nwere struggling against difficulties, the disembarkations were very\r\nnumerous in November and December. When the old year gave place to the\r\nnew, it was estimated that 23,000 British troops had landed at Calcutta\r\nsince the troubles began, besides others put on shore at Bombay, Madras,\r\nand Kurachee.[131] They had advanced into the upper provinces, by those\r\nroutes and modes which have so often been adverted to, and were placed\r\nunder the brigadiers whom Sir Colin Campbell had appointed to conduct\r\nthe various operations planned by him. We have first, therefore, to\r\nnotice such of the proceedings of the commander-in-chief as took place\r\nduring the month of January; turning attention afterwards to military\r\nproceedings in other quarters.\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell, as the last chapter shewed, rescued Cawnpore and\r\nGeneral Windham from trouble at the close of November and the beginning\r\nof the following month. He did not move from the vicinity of that city\r\ntill towards the end of December. Writing to Viscount Canning on this\r\nsubject, on the 6th of January, he said: ‘I am informed by the civil\r\nauthorities that my protracted stay at Cawnpore was of much benefit; and\r\nI am convinced that, apart from any immediate military object, it is\r\nnecessary, for the re-establishment of authority, that the march of the\r\ntroops should be deliberate. Time is thus afforded to the magistrates\r\nand special commissioners to visit rebellious towns and villages, and\r\nagain display to the people in unmistakable manner the resolution of\r\nyour lordship’s government to visit punishment on all those who during\r\nthe last few months have set aside their allegiance.’ He at the same\r\ntime glanced rapidly at the chief military operations which had marked\r\nthe month of December in the Gangetic and Jumna regions—such as Outram’s\r\ndefence at the Alum Bagh; Adrian Hope’s clean sweep of Nena Sahib’s\r\nproperty at Bithoor;[132] Walpole’s expedition to Etawah and Minpooree;\r\nSeaton’s energetic movements with a column from Delhi; and Windham’s\r\nexpedition to Futtiah.\r\n\r\nWhen the vehicles had returned to Cawnpore, after conveying the Lucknow\r\nfugitives to Allahabad, the commander-in-chief prepared to move his\r\nhead-quarters to Furruckabad and Fort Futteghur, near which places many\r\ninsurgent chieftains required to be dealt with. He started on the 24th\r\nof December and marched to Chowrepore. After remaining there some time\r\nto organise his force into brigades, &c., he renewed his march on the\r\n28th, and reached Meerun-ke-Serai. At the several halting-places of\r\nhimself and his brigadiers, he made arrangements for destroying the\r\ncountry-boats on the Ganges, in order to prevent molestation of the Doab\r\nfrom the Oude side of the river when the troops should have moved on. On\r\nthe 31st he arrived at Goorsaigunje; Greathed, Windham, and Hope Grant\r\nall being with him. On the first day of the new year, Sir Colin sent\r\nforth two regiments under Adrian Hope to secure the iron\r\nsuspension-bridge over the Kallee Nuddee, a very important point on the\r\nroad from Cawnpore to Futteghur. A party of sailors were quite delighted\r\nto assist in this work, replacing with ropes some of the ironwork which\r\nthe rebels had begun to destroy. On the 2d the enemy, hovering in\r\nvillages near the bridge, attacked Sir Colin’s pickets and advanced\r\ncolumns; but they were speedily defeated and driven across the Ganges\r\ninto Rohilcund.[133] Proof was here afforded that the insurgents had not\r\nforgotten the advantages of organisation. ‘The rebels,’ said the\r\ncommander-in-chief in his dispatch, ‘who were dispersed on this\r\noccasion, consisted of three or four battalions of the 41st and other\r\ncorps of native infantry. In the 41st, the rebels had begun with much\r\nsystem to organise a second battalion, their recruits being dressed in a\r\nneat uniform.’ On the 3d, Sir Colin reached Futteghur, the old British\r\nstation near the city of Furruckabad. Fortunately, the enemy, who had\r\nheld Futteghur for at least six months, now retreated so precipitately\r\nthat they had not time to destroy the government property within the\r\nplace. Sir Colin found a large amount of stores of the most valuable\r\ndescription, belonging to the gun and clothing agencies. Having secured\r\nthese important items of military property, he sent a large stock of\r\ngrain to Cawnpore, to lighten the labours of the commissariat for the\r\nsupply of Sir James Outram at the Alum Bagh. The Nawab of Furruckabad\r\nhad long been among the most ferocious leaders of the insurgents; and\r\nthe commander-in-chief now proceeded to such measures as would punish\r\nhim severely for his treachery. ‘The destruction of the Nawab’s palaces\r\nis in process. I think it right that not a stone should be left unturned\r\nin all the residences of the rebellious chiefs. They are far more guilty\r\nthan their misguided followers.’\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, then, the commander-in-chief was on the banks of\r\nthe Ganges at Futteghur. With him were the brigades and columns of Hope\r\nGrant, Adrian Hope, Walpole, Windham, Seaton, Greathed, and Little;\r\nInglis, with a movable column, was restoring order in a part of the Doab\r\nbetween Cawnpore and Etawah; while Outram was still at the Alum Bagh.\r\nSir Colin scarcely moved from that spot during the remainder of the\r\nmonth. He was waiting for more troops from Calcutta, and for vast stores\r\nof warlike material from the upper provinces. It may here be remarked\r\nthat the enormous weight of stores and ammunition required for an army,\r\nand the vast distances to be traversed in India, gave a stupendous\r\ncharacter to some of the convoys occasionally prepared. Thus, on the 22d\r\nof January, about 3000 troops started from Agra for the Cawnpore\r\nregions, having in charge 19 guns of various calibre, and 1500 carts\r\nladen with stores and ammunition. There were 750 rounds of ammunition\r\nfor each of 24 guns, and 500 for each of 44 howitzers and mortars—all\r\nrequired by the commander-in-chief. Several ladies, _en route_ to\r\nCalcutta, took advantage of the protection of this force. The above\r\nnumbers give a very imperfect idea of the convoy; for native servants\r\nand camp-followers, together with animals of draught and burden, always\r\naccompany such a train in swarms almost inconceivable.\r\n\r\nWhen the English public found that the whole of the autumn months, and\r\nthe winter so far as the end of January, had passed away without any\r\ngreat achievement except the relief of Lucknow, portions of them began\r\nto complain and to censure. They could not and would not find fault with\r\nSir Colin, because he was a general favourite; and therefore they rushed\r\nto a conclusion inimical to Viscount Canning, who from the first had\r\nbeen made to bear the burden of a vast amount of anonymous abuse. A\r\nstory arose that the governor-general and the commander-in-chief were at\r\n‘cross-purposes,’ that Campbell was doing nothing because Canning\r\nthwarted him. The Duke of Cambridge and Lord Panmure took occasion, in\r\nthe House of Lords, to give authoritative contradictions to these\r\nrumours; and among other evidence adduced was a letter written by Sir\r\nColin to his royal highness—the one as commander-in-chief in India, the\r\nother as commander-in-chief of all the Queen’s forces generally—just\r\nwhen he was about to set off to head the military operations at Cawnpore\r\nand Lucknow. ‘Now that I am on the point of leaving Calcutta,’ he said,\r\n‘I would beg, with the greatest respect to the governor-general, to\r\nrecord the deep sense of the obligation I entertain towards his\r\nlordship. Our intercourse has been most cordial, intimate, and\r\nunreserved. I cannot be sufficiently thankful for his lordship’s\r\nconfidence and support, and the kindly manner in which they have been\r\nafforded, to my great personal satisfaction. One at a distance, and\r\nunacquainted with the ordinary mode of transacting business in this\r\ncountry, could hardly estimate the gain to the public service which has\r\nthus been made. But I allude principally to my own feelings of\r\ngratification.’ Whether or not the governor-general and the\r\ncommander-in-chief were divided in opinion touching the best policy to\r\npursue, it is certain that men in lower though influential positions\r\ndiffered widely in their views on this point. Some were anxious that\r\nLucknow should be attacked at once. They urged that that city being the\r\nchief seat of rebellion, a crushing of the force there would dishearten\r\nthe rebels elsewhere; whereas every day lost would add to the strength\r\nof Lucknow. Even our victories increased the number and desperation of\r\nits defenders; and, therefore, till this central point was captured, the\r\nrevolt would always have a nucleus, a flag around which the discontented\r\nmight rally. On the other hand, it was urged that Rohilcund should be\r\ncleared before Lucknow could be profitably seized. Large bands still\r\nroaming over that province might interrupt the commander-in-chief’s\r\ncommunications, if he left them in his rear while engaged in Oude.\r\nAgain, Sir Colin was waiting for more troops. It was asserted that, even\r\nif he could conquer sixty or eighty thousand fighting-men in the streets\r\nof Lucknow, he could not leave a force there while he was endeavouring\r\nto clear out Rohilcund. So far as can be judged from attainable\r\nevidence, it appears that Sir Colin himself held this second\r\nopinion—resolving to clear the outworks before attacking the central\r\nstronghold of rebellion.\r\n\r\nLeaving the commander-in-chief for a while, we may suitably direct\r\nattention to the proceedings of other generals in other parts of the\r\nwide field of operations—beginning with those connected with Sir James\r\nOutram.\r\n\r\nThe Alum Bagh, never once out of English hands since the month of\r\nSeptember, remained a very important stronghold. The reader will perhaps\r\nrecall to mind the relation which that fort bore to the operations at\r\nLucknow; but a short recapitulation may not be misplaced here. When\r\nHavelock and Outram, on the 25th of September, advanced to Lucknow, they\r\nleft Colonel M’Intyre, of the 78th Highlanders, in command at the Alum\r\nBagh, with orders to maintain that post until further instructions\r\nreached him. He had with him 280 English soldiers of various regiments,\r\na few Sikhs, 4 guns, 128 sick and wounded, between 4000 and 5000 native\r\ncamp-followers, large numbers of cattle, and a valuable store of\r\nbaggage, ammunition, and other military appliances. His supply of food\r\nfor the natives was very scanty, and those poor creatures soon suffered\r\nterribly from hunger. After a few days, they stealthily collected crops\r\nof rice and grain in fields near at hand, under protection of the guns;\r\nbut this resource was soon exhausted. It is a familiar occurrence in the\r\nannals of Indian warfare, that the camp-followers and army-servants\r\nexceed by five or ten fold the number of actual combatants; and thus is\r\nto be explained the strange composition of the miscellaneous body\r\ncollected within the walls of the Alum Bagh. Unable to receive aid or\r\neven instructions from the Residency, M’Intyre maintained his position\r\nas best he could. A convoy of provisions reached him from Cawnpore on\r\nthe 7th of October, under Major Bingham, and another on the 25th under\r\nMajor Barnston. Some of the troops remained with him on each occasion,\r\nraising his force altogether to 900 fighting-men and ten guns. Meanwhile\r\nhe fortified his position with bastions and other defence-works, and\r\ncontended successfully against the enemy, who constructed five batteries\r\nin various parts of the exterior, and brought artillery-fire to bear\r\nagainst him day after day. They also held the neighbouring fort of\r\nJelalabad, which formed a sixth base of attack. So steadily and\r\nactively, however, did the colonel maintain his defence, that the\r\nenemy’s fire occasioned him very little loss. Matters continued thus\r\nuntil the middle of November, when Sir Colin Campbell, conquering\r\nJelalabad, and reaching Alum Bagh, made a few changes in the garrison.\r\nThen, in the last week of the month, Sir James Outram became master of\r\nthe Alum Bagh, with a picked force of 3000 to 4000 men. He easily\r\nmaintained his position throughout December, and gave the enemy a severe\r\ndefeat on the 22d, at a place called Giulee, three miles from Alum Bagh\r\non the Dil Koosha road. The opening of the year 1858 found Outram still\r\nat his post, and the enemy still endeavouring or hoping to cut off his\r\ncommunications and starve him out.[134] Some of his troops were away,\r\nconvoying a supply of provisions from Cawnpore; and the enemy, knowing\r\nthis, resolved to attack him on the 12th of January in his weakened\r\nstate. Fathoming their intentions, he prepared for defence. At sunrise\r\nthey appeared, to the immense number of at least 30,000, and formed a\r\nwide semicircle in front and flank of his position. Outram, massing his\r\ntroops into two brigades, sent them out to confront the enemy. Then\r\ncommenced a very fierce battle; for while the main body of the enemy\r\nattacked these two brigades, a second proceeded to assault the fort of\r\nJelalabad, while a third by a detour reached the Alum Bagh itself, and\r\nendeavoured to cut off Outram’s communications with it. From sunrise\r\ntill four o’clock in the afternoon did the struggle continue, every\r\nBritish gun being incessantly engaged in repelling the advances of dense\r\nmasses of the enemy. Foiled at every point, the insurgents at length\r\nwithdrew to the city or to their original positions in the gardens and\r\nvillages. It was a very serious struggle, for the enemy fought well and\r\nwere in overwhelming numbers; nevertheless, their discomfiture was\r\ncomplete. Four days afterwards they made another attack, in smaller\r\nnumbers, but with greater boldness: the result was the same as\r\nbefore—complete defeat and severe loss. Thus did this skilful and\r\nwatchful commander frustrate every hostile attempt made by the swarms of\r\ninsurgents who surrounded him.\r\n\r\nWe turn our attention next further eastward. The Nepaulese leader, Jung\r\nBahadoor, with Brigadier MacGregor as representative of British\r\ninterests, entered Goruckpore on the 6th of January, thus taking\r\npossession of a city which for many months had been almost entirely in\r\nthe hands of rebels. The force was Goorkha, the officers were Nepaulese\r\nand English. Jung Bahadoor and Brigadier MacGregor being the two\r\nleaders, the brigades were thus commanded—the first by Run Singh and\r\nCaptain Plowden, the second by Sunmuck Singh and Captain Edmonstone, the\r\nthird by Junga Doge and Lieutenant Foote, and the artillery by Loll\r\nSingh and Major Fitzgerald. This singular combination was made because,\r\nalthough Jung Bahadoor was entitled to appoint his own native officers,\r\nit was nevertheless desirable that English officers should be at hand to\r\nadvise or even control if necessary. The advancing force had first to\r\neffect a passage over a nullah, the bridge of which was broken, and the\r\nbanks stoutly defended by the enemy; this was done after a short but\r\nsharp conflict. The enemy fled from the nullah through a jungle towards\r\nthe city, pursued by the Goorkhas; but the latter could not equal the\r\nsepoys in running over loose sand, and therefore could not come up with\r\nthem. All the baggage having crossed the nullah, Jung Bahadoor steadily\r\nadvanced towards the city, attacked by new parties of the enemy in\r\nskirmishing form on both flanks. Many hundreds of the rebels rushed into\r\nthe river Ribtee, to effect a safe crossing to the other side, adjacent\r\nto the Oude frontier; but they were shot down or drowned in considerable\r\nnumbers in this attempt to escape. Goruckpore was entered, and taken\r\npossession of in the English name. It is curious to trace, in the\r\nmilitary dispatch of Brigadier MacGregor to the Calcutta authorities,\r\nthe same conventional ‘mention’ of Nepaulese officers as is customary in\r\nthe British army. Colonel Loll Singh ‘proved himself a good artillery\r\nofficer;’ Captain Suzan Singh’s ‘very effective fire was much admired;’\r\nBrigadier Junga Doge ‘reaped, conjointly with the artillery, the\r\nprincipal honours of the day;’ Brigadier Sunmuck Singh’s brigade ‘was\r\nwell in advance;’ Brigadier Run Singh’s brigade ‘was most skilfully led\r\nthrough the forest;’ and Brigadier Jodh Adhikaree was only shut out from\r\npraise by the fact that his brigade was not brought into action. The\r\nnames of the British officers were set forth in parallel order, each to\r\nreceive praise by the side of his Nepaulese companion. The English\r\ncommander of a military force, we may here remark, must often be\r\nembarrassed while writing his dispatches; for unless he mentions the\r\nname of almost every officer, he gives offence; while it taxes his\r\npowers of composition to vary the terms in which encomiums are\r\nexpressed. When Goruckpore was once again placed under British control,\r\nthe authorities quickly put down the so-called government which had been\r\nintroduced by Mahomed Hussein, the self-appointed nazim or chief. Such\r\nof his adherents as had clearly been rebellious were quickly tried, and\r\nmany of them executed. All the convicted natives who were not sentenced\r\nto hanging were made to do sweeper’s work, within the church, jail, and\r\nother buildings, without respect to their caste, creed, or former\r\ndignity. Mushurruff Khan, and other rebellious leaders in the district\r\nbetween Goruckpore and the Oude frontier, were one by one captured, to\r\nthe manifest pacification of the country villages and planters’ estates.\r\n\r\nIn the wide stretch of country between Patna and Allahabad, and between\r\nthe Ganges on the south and Nepaul on the north, everything was awaiting\r\nthe completion of the commander-in-chief’s plans. In and near Arrah,\r\nAzimghur, Ghazeepore, Jounpoor, Benares, and Mirzapore, there were\r\nbodies of malcontents ready to break out into open rebellion as soon as\r\nany favourable opportunities should occur for so doing, but checked by\r\nthe gradually increasing power of the British. On one occasion, towards\r\nthe close of the month, Brigadier Franks marched out of Secundra, near\r\nAllahabad, against a body of 500 rebels, who were posted with several\r\nguns at Nussunpore. He totally defeated them, and captured two of their\r\nguns. About the same time, on the 22d of the month, Colonel Rowcroft,\r\nwith detachments of H.M. 10th foot, sailors, Sikhs, and Goorkhas,\r\nproceeded from Azimghur towards the Oudian frontier, there to aid in\r\nhemming in the rebels. Indeed, Jung Bahadoor, Franks, and Rowcroft, at\r\nthe end of the month, feeling that all was pretty secure on the east of\r\nthe frontier, were gradually drawing a cordon round the Oudians, from\r\nNepaul in the north to the Ganges on the south—ready to concur in any\r\nlarge scheme of operations which Sir Colin Campbell might be enabled to\r\ninitiate.\r\n\r\nThe brigadiers who were more immediately under the eye of Sir Colin\r\nCampbell were employed during the month of January, as has already been\r\nimplied, in clearing away bands of insurgents in the Doab and\r\nneighbouring districts. To detail the various minor contests will be\r\nunnecessary; one or two will suffice as samples of all. On the 27th of\r\nthe month, Brigadier Adrian Hope had a smart contest with the enemy at\r\nShumshabad. Taking with him a small column,[135] he started from\r\nFutteghur on the previous day, and proceeded through Kooshinabad to\r\nShumshabad, where he found the enemy in considerable force. They\r\noccupied a commanding knoll on the edge of the plateau overlooking the\r\nplain stretching towards the river. On the knoll was a Mussulman tomb,\r\nsurrounded by the remains of an old intrenchment, upon which they had\r\nraised a sand-bag battery; their front was defended by a ravine\r\nimpassable for cavalry or guns. Hope, having formed his plan of attack,\r\nmoved over some broken ground towards the enemy’s camp. They at once\r\nopened with a well-directed fire of round-shot. Silencing these guns by\r\na flank fire, Hope ordered his infantry to advance out of a hollow where\r\nthey had been screened; they did so, rushed upon the camp, and captured\r\nit. Then began a pursuit of the fleeing enemy by Hope’s cavalry, and the\r\nsecuring of several guns and much ammunition which they had left behind\r\nthem. The brigadier believed the insurgents to consist of two of the\r\nmutinied Bareilly regiments, accompanied by a motley group of rebels\r\nanxious for plunder. About the same day, another district near\r\nFurruckabad became the scene of a fierce encounter. A body of rebels\r\nabout 5000 strong, with four guns, being heard of at a distance of some\r\nmiles from the city, a force was sent out—consisting of H.M. 42d and 53d\r\nfoot, the 4th Punjaubees, two squadrons of H.M. 9th Lancers, two of\r\nHodson’s Horse, a horse-battery, and two troops of horse-artillery. The\r\nenemy’s guns were planted on the site of an old mud-fort on rising\r\nground, whence they opened fire as soon as the British came in sight.\r\nThe morning being densely foggy, the column proceeded cautiously to\r\nprevent a surprise. The action that ensued was chiefly carried on by\r\nartillery and cavalry, and was marked by several deaths on the side of\r\nthe British owing to the blowing up of tumbrils. Among the wounded was\r\nthe gallant Hodson, whose name had become so well known in connection\r\nwith an active and useful body of Punjaub or Sikh irregular cavalry. The\r\nresult of this, as of almost all similar contests, was the defeat and\r\ndispersion of the enemy. A glance at a map will shew that at Furruckabad\r\nand Futteghur (the latter a military station near the former), the\r\ncommander-in-chief was in an admirable position to send out detachments\r\non special service. Bareilly, Allygurh, Agra, Muttra, Minpooree,\r\nGwalior, Etawah, Calpee, Cawnpore, and Lucknow, formed an irregular\r\ncircle of which Furruckabad was the centre.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the year the little colony at Nynee Tal received one\r\nof the alarms to which it had been so often subjected for six months;\r\nbut, as in all the other instances, the danger was promptly averted. The\r\nsubsidiary station at Huldwanee, eighteen miles distant, was attacked\r\nearly in the morning by a large number of the Bareilly rebels. Some time\r\npreviously, a force of about 600 Goorkhas had been sent to that station;\r\nbut owing to the absence of the commandant at Almora, and to the neglect\r\nin making any defensive arrangements, the place was not well prepared to\r\nresist a surprise. The enemy opened an artillery fire most unexpectedly,\r\nfor their approach was not in the least anticipated. The gallant little\r\nGoorkhas, however, speedily turned out, met the enemy hand to hand,\r\ndefeated them, pursued them three or four miles from the station, and\r\ncut down a considerable number of them.\r\n\r\nOf the two imperial or once imperial cities, Agra and Delhi, little need\r\nbe said in connection with the events of January. Agra, it will be\r\nremembered, was never out of British hands during the turmoils of 1857,\r\nalthough severely pressed; and when Delhi on the one side, and Cawnpore\r\non the other, were recovered, there was less chance than ever that Agra\r\nwould fall into the hands of the enemy. The citizens resumed their\r\nordinary employments, and the British authorities re-established their\r\ncivil control.[136]\r\n\r\nAfter four months of strict military occupancy, the city of Delhi was\r\nthrown open to natives who during that interval had been excluded. On\r\nthe 18th of January an order to this intent came into operation. Each\r\nperson availing himself of it had to pay one rupee four annas to the\r\nkotwallee or police authority; for this he was provided with a ticket,\r\nwhich insured him certain facilities for living and trading within the\r\ncity. The Chandnee Chowk began to resume its former lively appearance; a\r\nmilitary band resumed its evening music in the open space fronting the\r\nEnglish church; and, ‘but for the shot-holes all around,’ as an\r\neye-witness observed, ‘the signs of many sanguinary months were passing\r\naway.’ A formal charge was drawn up, and judicial proceedings commenced,\r\nagainst the imprisoned king; but as the trial chiefly took place in\r\nFebruary, we may defer for a few pages any notice of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nEverything westward of Delhi may happily be dismissed in the same\r\nlanguage which has so often sufficed in former chapters. Sir John\r\nLawrence, with his able coadjutors Montgomery, Cotton, and Edwardes,\r\nstill held the whole length and breadth of the Punjaub at peace or\r\nnearly so. And the same may in like manner be said of Sinde, where Mr\r\nFrere and General Jacob held sway.\r\n\r\nOf the state of the widely scattered and diversely governed regions of\r\nCentral India and Rajpootana at the beginning of the year, it is\r\ndifficult to give a correct picture. Unlike the Hindustani regions, they\r\nwere inhabited by a very motley population—Bundelas, Rajpoots, Rohillas,\r\nMahrattas, Bheels, Jâts, Ghonds, all mingled, and governed by chieftains\r\nwho cared much more for their own petty authority than for the kings of\r\nDelhi and Lucknow, or for castes and creeds. Luckily the two principal\r\nMahratta leaders, Scindia and Holkar, still remained faithful to the\r\nBritish, and thus rendered possible what would have been impossible\r\nwithout their assistance. If to Central India and Rajpootana, we add\r\nBundelcund and the Saugor territories, we shall have a wide sweep of\r\ncountry approached nearest at one point by the Calcutta presidency, at\r\nanother by the Madras presidency, and at a third by that of Bombay. As,\r\nhowever, Calcutta had no troops to spare for that part of India, Madras\r\nand Bombay sent up columns and ‘field-forces’ as fast as they could be\r\nprovided; and thus it is that we read of small military bodies under\r\nStuart, Steuart, Roberts, Whitlock, Rose, Raines, and other officers.\r\nAccording to the number of troops composing them, and the districts in\r\nwhich their services were required, these columns received various\r\nnames—such as ‘Rajpootana Field-force,’ ‘Nerbudda Field-force,’ ‘Malwah\r\nField-force,’ and ‘Central India Field-force.’ The mere naming might be\r\nof small consequence, were it not that confusion arose occasionally by\r\ndifferent appellations being employed at different times for the very\r\nsame force. At various periods during the month encounters took place, a\r\nfew of which may briefly be noticed.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, a small force of about 500 miscellaneous troops,\r\nwith guns, set out from Camp Muddah in Rajpootana, under Major Raines,\r\nto rout a body of rebels at Rowah. They found the village strongly\r\nfortified by a hedge fronting a deep ditch and breastwork of earth,\r\nthick and loopholed. After a reconnaissance the major advanced; when the\r\nenemy opened fire, bringing down branches of trees with a crash among\r\nthe British. When a hot artillery and infantry fire had been maintained\r\nfor some time, about 200 men of the 10th Bombay N.I. received orders to\r\nstorm the village; they advanced in admirable order, dashed forward,\r\ncleared the hedge, mounted to the opposite side, and compelled the\r\ninsurgents to make a precipitate retreat. The village was burned to\r\nashes, and the force returned to camp—having marched over deep sand in a\r\nthick jungle for twenty-two miles. One of the horrors of war was\r\nillustrated forcibly in a few brief words contained in an officer’s\r\nnarrative of this engagement: ‘The villagers were mowed down in sections\r\nby the artillery, as they were entering a cave on the sides of the rock\r\nin rear of the village.’ Nothing perplexed the English officers more\r\nthan to determine how far to compassionate the native villagers;\r\nsometimes these poor creatures suffered terribly and undeservedly; but\r\non other occasions they unquestionably assisted the rebels.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Houses in the Chandnee Chowk, Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose had a short but decisive encounter with a body of rebels\r\nat Ratgurh or Rutgurh towards the close of the month. This was a town in\r\nCentral India, between Saugor and Bhopal, in and near which many\r\nchieftains had unfurled the banner of rebellion, at the head of whom was\r\nNawab Fazil Mahomed Khan. Ratgurh was a strong place, in good repair,\r\nand supplied with a year’s provisions. The rebels intended to have made\r\na bold stand; but they lost heart when they saw siege-artillery brought\r\nup to a position which they had deemed unattainable, and applied to the\r\nbreaching of their fort. Many of the defenders abandoned the fort during\r\nthe night, letting themselves down by ropes from the rocks, &c. On the\r\nnext day some of their number, aided by many mutinous sepoys, emerged\r\nfrom the thick jungles in the neighbourhood, attacked the videttes\r\nguarding the rear of Sir Hugh’s camp, and attempted to relieve the fort;\r\nbut they were driven across the river Betwah, and the fort securely\r\ncaptured. It is worthy of note how many of the contests during the wars\r\nof the mutiny partook of the nature of sieges. Mud-forts have been\r\nfamous in India for centuries, and the natives exhibit much tact in\r\ndefending them. As long as guns attack from a safe distance, such\r\nstrongholds may be long defended; but a storming by British bayonets\r\nutterly paralyses the garrisons. Sir Hugh bent his attention towards\r\nSaugor also, which had for many months been invested by a large body of\r\nthe enemy. With the second brigade of the Central India Field-force,\r\nreinforced by the 3d Europeans and the 3d native cavalry from the Poonah\r\ndivision, he laid his plans for an effective relief of that place.\r\nGeneral Whitlock, with a Madras column, was also bound for Saugor; but\r\nit was expected that Rose would reach that place before him.\r\n\r\nIn another region, much nearer Calcutta, a small military affair\r\npresented itself for notice. Just before the commencement of the new\r\nyear, Sumbhulpore was relieved from a trouble that had pressed upon it,\r\nin the presence of a miscellaneous body of rebels. A small force of less\r\nthan 300 troops, consisting of Madras native infantry, Ramgurh infantry,\r\nand Nagpoor irregular cavalry, made a forced march from Nagpoor to\r\nSumbhulpore; and on the 30th of December Captain Wood marched out with\r\nthis force to chastise a body of rebels encamped in a gorse-land near\r\nthe city. The victory was speedy and decisive, and was rendered more\r\nvaluable by the capture of three native chieftains who had been leaders\r\nin the rebellion. The rebels were not sepoys, but escaped convicts.\r\n\r\nThe large and important regions of Nagpoor and Hyderabad exhibited\r\nnearly the same features at the beginning of the year as they had done\r\nduring the summer and autumn. Containing very few pure Hindustanis of\r\nthe Brahmin and Rajpoot castes, and being within comparatively easy\r\nreach of the trusty and trusted native troops of the Madras presidency,\r\nthey were seldom disturbed by symptoms of mutiny. The British\r\ncommissioners or residents had, it is true, much to render them anxious;\r\nbut the perils were not so great as those which weighed down their\r\nbrother-officials in other regions. The Deccan, or Hyderabad, or the\r\nNizam’s Country—for it was known by all three names—had from the first\r\nbeen more troubled by marauders than by regular military mutineers. The\r\nvillages of Mugrool, Janappul, Sind Kaid, Rungeenee, and Dawulgaum,\r\nmostly distant about twenty or thirty miles from Jaulnah, were infested\r\nduring January by predatory bands of Rohillas and Bheels, who alarmed\r\nthe villages by acts of plunder, dacoitee, and cruelty. They even went\r\nso far as to plunder the treasure-chest of a regiment of the Hyderabad\r\nContingent, while on the way from Aurungabad to Jaulnab, and barely two\r\nmiles from the last-named place. The officer commanding at Jaulnah sent\r\na small force in pursuit; but the marauders, here as elsewhere, were\r\nswift of foot, and made clear off with their booty. These Bheels, a\r\nhalf-savage mountain tribe, gave annoyance in more districts than one.\r\nCaptain Montgomery, superintendent of police at Ahmednuggur, a city\r\nbetween Jaulnah and Bombay, found it necessary to go out and attack a\r\nstrong body of them, who held a position in a jungle twelve miles from\r\nChandore. He had with him a miscellaneous force of Bombay native troops;\r\nbut after three successive attempts he was beaten back from the enemy’s\r\nposition, and wounded, as well as three of his officers.\r\n\r\nThe Nagpoor force, though never very closely in league with the\r\nmutineers further north, contrived to rouse suspicion and bring down\r\npunishment early in the year. The Nagpoor irregulars had been disarmed\r\nby Brigadier Prior very early in the history of the Revolt; but Mr\r\nPlowden, commissioner of the Nagpoor territory, believing that they\r\nmight be trusted, advised that their weapons should again be given to\r\nthem. The conduct of the men throughout the rest of the year justified\r\nthis reliance; but, with the strange inconsistency that so often marked\r\nthe proceedings of the natives, they stained the first month of the year\r\nwith a deed of violence. On the 18th of January, at Raeepore, a place on\r\nthe road between Nagpoor and Cuttack, a party of Mussulman gunners in\r\nthe Nagpoor artillery suddenly rose, murdered Sergeant-major Sidwell,\r\nand called on the 3d Nagpoor irregular infantry to assist them in\r\nexterminating the Europeans. Either the 3d were innocent in the matter,\r\nor their hearts failed them; for they not only remained firm, but at\r\nonce assisted in disarming the gunners. On the 22d, Lieutenant Elliott,\r\ndeputy-commissioner, rode into Raeepore, and immediately brought the\r\ngunners to trial; all but one were found guilty, and were hung that same\r\nevening, amid frantic appeals to their comrades to save them for the\r\nsake of their common faith—an appeal to which the infantry did not\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, in relation to all the military operations in the\r\nmonth of January, that there were certain rebel leaders whose personal\r\nmovements were seldom clearly known to the British officers. Nena Sahib\r\nof Bithoor, Koer Singh of Jugdispore, and Mohammed Khan of Bareilly,\r\nwere unquestionably urging the sepoys and rebels to continue the\r\nstruggle against the Company’s ‘raj;’ but their own marchings and\r\nretreatings from place to place were veiled in much obscurity. There\r\nwas, in truth, a very intelligible motive for this; for a price was\r\nplaced upon the head of each, and he could not fully know whether any\r\ntraitor were at his elbow. Some of the leaders, such as the Rajah of\r\nMinpooree and the Nawab of Furruckabad, were believed to have joined\r\ntheir fortunes with those of the defenders of Lucknow; while Mahomed\r\nHussein, as we have seen, was hovering between Oude and Goruckpore,\r\naccording to the strength of the Goorkhas sent against him. It was known\r\nthat many of the Gwalior mutineers, after their severe defeat in\r\nDecember, had collected again in Bundelcund; but it was not clearly\r\nascertained who among them assumed the post of leader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  A return was prepared by order of parliament, of the odds and ends\r\n  composing what was called the _sea-kit_ of English soldiers going out\r\n  to India, the cost at which they were estimated, and the mode of\r\n  paying for them:\r\n\r\n                           Articles.

An officer writing at the\r\n  close of the year, said: ‘We have made very good use of our delay at\r\n  Cawnpore. The Highland brigade was encamped at Bithoor, and employed\r\n  in raising all Nena Sahib’s valuables from a well. The operation was a\r\n  most difficult one, as the well was deep and full of water. However,\r\n  it was very successful; for not including their last day’s work (a\r\n  very good one) they raised 75½ pounds of gold in various shapes, and\r\n  252 pounds of silver. The last day they got an enormous quantity of\r\n  gold and silver, so heavy that a man could just carry it. I hope they\r\n  will come upon Bajee Rao’s Jewels. There are two more wells yet to\r\n  open. The Nena is “beating his breast” at our well-successes.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  One incident of this affair was afterwards thus described by an\r\n  officer present: ‘A brigade was sent to repair the suspension-bridge.\r\n  They commenced work on the 1st, and by morning of the 2d had finished\r\n  it all but one or two planks, which they were laying down, when the\r\n  chief saw the villagers come out of the village opposite. He desired\r\n  some one to go and tell them not to be afraid, as they would not be\r\n  hurt; when all of a sudden bang came a round-shot from amongst them,\r\n  which killed four men of the 53d. The enemy were then discovered to be\r\n  in force; the naval brigade soon opened on them, pitching into the\r\n  village for about two hours, they returning it with an 18-pounder and\r\n  a 9-pounder. When the firing commenced, we were all sent for, the\r\n  bridge was soon finished, and then the chief with his force crossed,\r\n  turned them out of the village, and pursued them with cavalry and\r\n  artillery for about eight miles.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Sir James Outram’s total force in and near the Alum Bagh, at the\r\n  beginning of the year, was made up of the following elements:\r\n\r\n    H.M. 5th, 75th, 78th, 84th, and 90th foot.\r\n    1st Madras Europeans.\r\n    Brasyer’s Ferozpore Sikhs.\r\n    12th irregular cavalry.\r\n    Hardinge’s corps.\r\n    Military train.\r\n    Engineer park.\r\n    Artillery park.\r\n    Madras Sappers and Miners.\r\n    Royal artillery, under Eyre and Maude.\r\n    Bengal artillery, under Olphert.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n    9th Lancers, two squadrons.\r\n    Hodson’s Horse, 200.\r\n    Bengal H.A. one troop.\r\n    Bengal F.A. 4 guns.\r\n    42d Highlanders.\r\n    53d foot.\r\n    4th Punjaub rifles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  The condition of the British quarters in Agra at the beginning of the\r\n  year was briefly told by one of the writers in the _Mofussilite_\r\n  newspaper, after the severe pressure on the garrison had ceased: ‘The\r\n  fort is being abandoned by every one who has a house which can be made\r\n  in the least degree habitable; but many people will still be compelled\r\n  to remain within its gloomy walls for an indefinite period; as in many\r\n  instances the destruction of houses has been so complete, that it will\r\n  be a work of time and a matter of considerable expense to place them\r\n  in anything like decent repair.... As we are fortunate enough to\r\n  possess a good house with a pucka roof, which has been put into\r\n  excellent repair, we intend publishing next Tuesday’s paper in that\r\n  building—the former printing-office of the _Mofussilite_. We shall all\r\n  be put to great straits for furniture, crockery, and such like things;\r\n  for although a charpoy (stump-bedstead), a teapoy, and a couple of\r\n  broken chairs, were as much as we could find room for in one of our\r\n  little cells of the fort, yet we shall soon require rather more when\r\n  we dwell in roomier habitations. Our distant friends must know that it\r\n  is a rare thing to see two plates of the same pattern on any table,\r\n  and that none but those upon whom fortune has smiled indulge in glass\r\n  tumblers. Tin pots are the height of our ambition. Port, sherry,\r\n  brandy, Allsopp, and Bass, are beverages generally as unknown to this\r\n  community as they were to Robinson Crusoe.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR JAMES OUTRAM.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n                    MILITARY OPERATIONS IN FEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpatient as the whole British nation was to hear of a brilliant and\r\nsuccessful termination of the struggle in India, every telegram, every\r\nweekly mail, shewed that the time for this satisfaction was still far\r\ndistant. The mutineers were beaten, but not crushed; the rebellious\r\nchieftains were checked, but not extinguished; their deluded followers\r\nwere disappointed in the results obtained, but not deterred from making\r\nfurther efforts. England, with all her delays and waverings of opinion,\r\nhad sent over a large, fine, and complete army; the Punjaub had supplied\r\nsuch a force of reliable troops as no one would have ventured beforehand\r\nto anticipate; generals had been brought into notice by the exigencies\r\nof public affairs who possessed those fine soldierly attributes which a\r\nnation is proud to recognise; the authorities, steady at their posts,\r\nnever for a moment doubted that the British ‘raj’ would be established\r\non a firmer basis than ever—and yet everything was in turmoil in India.\r\nBlood and treasure were being daily expended; but the time had not\r\narrived when any adequate return was obtained for these losses. January\r\nhaving passed, men speculated whether Lucknow and Oude—to say nothing of\r\nother cities and provinces—would fall permanently into British hands\r\nduring the month of February. What was the response to this much-mooted\r\nquestion, the present chapter will shew.\r\n\r\nThe gallant commander-in-chief, Sir Colin Campbell, being the chief\r\nactor in the busy military scenes of the period, it may be well to trace\r\nhis movements during the month of February, before noticing the\r\nmarchings and battles of other generals.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, from the details given in the last chapter, that\r\nSir Colin, after the capture of Furruckabad and Futteghur early in\r\nJanuary, remained during the greater part of that month encamped in that\r\nneighbourhood, organising the military arrangements necessary for an\r\nadvance into Oude. These arrangements involved the arrival of siege-guns\r\nfrom Delhi and Agra, and the concentration at one point of different\r\ncolumns under his brigadiers. Among various subsidiary operations,\r\nCaptain Taylor, of the Engineers, was sent to the Alum Bagh, to report\r\nas far as possible on the defensive works thrown up by the enemy in and\r\nnear Lucknow, and to gather a strong engineer force to aid the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Sir Colin remained nearly stationary during these\r\npreliminary proceedings, elaborating the details of his plan of\r\nstrategy, in conjunction with his chief of the staff, General Mansfield.\r\nWhen his troops and his missiles, his _personnel_ and _matériel_, were\r\npretty well collected, he returned from Futteghur to Cawnpore on the 4th\r\nof February. Viscount Canning had shortly before gone up from Calcutta\r\nto Allahabad; and Sir Colin started off on the 8th to meet him. What\r\nthese two representatives of British power agreed on during their\r\ninterview, they of course kept to themselves; but every one felt the\r\nprobability that some extensive scheme of policy, military and\r\npolitical, to be worked out by soldiers and civilians in unison, was\r\ndiscussed and mutually accepted. Returning again to Cawnpore, the\r\ncommander-in-chief made the last arrangements for giving activity to the\r\nforce which had been so slowly and with so much difficulty collected.\r\nFain would many critics have censured the old general for delay; fain\r\nwould they have urged that in two months he had only fought two\r\nbattles—at Cawnpore and at Furruckabad—while the world was impatiently\r\nwaiting to hear of the reconquest of Oude; but as he kept his own\r\ncouncil with remarkable reticence, criticism gave way to a belief that\r\nthere must have been good and sufficient cause for the caution which\r\nmarked all his proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 11th of February, all the preparatory operations were\r\ncompleted, and an army, larger than any which had up to that time\r\nappeared against the rebels, began to cross the Ganges from Cawnpore\r\ninto Oude. It had originally been intended to effect the crossing of a\r\nportion of the army at Futteghur; but Cawnpore was afterwards selected.\r\nThe crossing was necessarily a slow and difficult one, on account of the\r\nvast _impedimenta_ of an Indian army. To increase the facilities, a\r\nsecond bridge of boats was constructed. Even with this addition the\r\npassage across the Ganges lasted several days; for each bullock-cart\r\ncarried but little. A small portion only of the ammunition, irrespective\r\nof all other equipage and baggage, required the services of fifteen\r\nhundred carts. The artillery was on an enormous scale; the siege-guns,\r\nthe naval-brigade guns, the field-guns, and the horse-artillery guns,\r\nnumbered not much less than two hundred in all. After crossing, the army\r\ndistributed itself at certain places on the line of route from Cawnpore\r\nto Lucknow. For instance, on the 15th of the month, the head-quarters\r\nwere still at Cawnpore; one portion of the army was encamped at Onao,\r\none march from Cawnpore; another at Busherutgunje, a march and a half\r\nfrom Cawnpore; a third at Nawabgunge, two marches from Cawnpore; a\r\nfourth, under Outram, at the Alum Bagh; and a fifth at Sheorajpore,\r\ntwenty miles from Cawnpore on the Allygurh road. Sir Colin himself still\r\nremained with head-quarters at Cawnpore—partly to provide for the safety\r\nof convoys of ladies and children passing down from Agra through\r\nCawnpore to Allahabad; partly to await the entry into Oude, from the\r\neast, of the forces under Jung Bahadoor and Brigadier Franks; and partly\r\nto watch the proceedings of a large body of the enemy near Calpee, who\r\nwere threatening again to overrun the Doab unless strongly held in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nIt may here usefully be stated that Sir Colin organised his Oudian army\r\nbefore any of the regiments began to cross into that province. As a\r\npermanent record of the component elements of that fine force, we give\r\nthe details in a note at the end of the present chapter; but a summary\r\nmay not be out of place here. The ‘army of Oude,’ as tabulated on the\r\n10th of February, comprised such regiments and corps as were at that\r\ntime under the more immediate command of Sir Colin Campbell; and took no\r\naccount of the separate forces under Jung Bahadoor, Franks, Seaton,\r\nMacgregor, Windham, Inglis, Van Cortlandt, Rose, Stuart, Steuart, Orr,\r\nWhitlock, Greathed, Penny, M’Causland, Roberts, and other officers whose\r\nservices were required elsewhere, or who had not reached the Oudian\r\nfrontier at that date. The army of Oude, thus limited in its meaning,\r\nwas systematically classified. There were three divisions of infantry,\r\nunder Outram, Walpole, and a third general afterwards to be named. These\r\nwere subdivided into six brigades, under Hamilton, Russell, Franklyn,\r\nAdrian Hope, Douglas, and Horsford—two brigades to each division. Each\r\nbrigade was further divided into three regiments or battalions. The\r\nQueen’s regiments of infantry in the six brigades were the 5th, 23d,\r\n34th, 38th, 42d, 53d, 78th, 79th, 84th, 90th, and 93d, and two\r\nbattalions of the Rifle Brigade. The other infantry regiments were\r\nCompany’s Europeans, Sikhs, and Punjaubees; the Goorkhas were in corps\r\nnot yet incorporated in the army of Oude. A fourth division of infantry,\r\nunder Franks, Wroughton, and Puhlwan Singh, was provided for, but did\r\nnot at that time form a part of the army of Oude. The cavalry formed one\r\ndivision, under Hope Grant, and was separated into two brigades, under\r\nWilliam Campbell and Little. The Queen’s cavalry regiments in this\r\ndivision were the 2d Dragoon Guards, the 7th Hussars, and the 9th\r\nLancers; the other cavalry were Sikhs, Punjaubees, and a few volunteers\r\nand irregulars of miscellaneous origin. The artillery division, under\r\nArchdale Wilson (the conqueror of Delhi), comprised a field-artillery\r\nbrigade under Wood, a siege-artillery brigade under Barker, a naval\r\nbrigade under Peel, and an engineer brigade under Napier.\r\n\r\nNot until the last day of February did the commander-in-chief cross over\r\nthe Ganges, and take command of the army destined to besiege and finally\r\ncapture the great city of Lucknow. Meanwhile Sir James Outram, at the\r\nAlum Bagh, had been daily in communication with the other officers, and\r\nhad prepared detailed plans of everything relating to Lucknow and its\r\ndefences, so far as he was acquainted with them. The engineers, too, had\r\nbeen busily engaged in preparing that vast store of siege-materials\r\nwhich is necessary for the attack of strongly defended fortifications.\r\n\r\nWhat the army of Oude effected during the month of March, the next\r\nchapter will shew. Before quitting this part of the February operations,\r\nhowever, it may be well to notice episodically the remarkable connection\r\nbetween the newspaper press and the battle-field in recent times. In the\r\ngreat wars of former days, correspondents residing at the chief cities\r\nin foreign countries were wont to send such items of information as they\r\ncould pick up to the editors of English newspapers; and military\r\nofficers, cautiously and anonymously, sent occasional criticisms on the\r\ndetails of the battles in which they were engaged. It was left for the\r\nperiod of the Crimean war, however, to commence, or at least to perfect,\r\na system by which a non-military writer is sent out at enormous expense,\r\nto join an army in the field or at a siege, to bear some danger and much\r\nprivation, to see with his own eyes everything that can be seen, and to\r\nwrite such descriptions of the scenes as shall be intelligible to\r\nordinary newspaper readers. Mr W. H. Russell, of the _Times_, gave an\r\nimportance to such communications never before equalled, by the\r\nbrilliant style in which he described the military operations in\r\nBulgaria and the Crimea during the Russian war of 1854-5; and the system\r\nwas ably carried out by special correspondents connected with the staff\r\nof some of the other London newspapers. When the Indian mutiny was half\r\na year old, Mr Russell started from England, to do that for India which\r\nhe had before done for the Crimea—mix in the turmoil of war, and\r\ndescribe battles in a graphic and vivid way. What he saw and what he did\r\nin February initiated him into many of the peculiarities of Indian life,\r\nwhen scenes of slaughter had not yet come under his notice. Leaving\r\nCalcutta on the 4th of February, he went like other travellers to\r\nRaneegunge by railway, and thence to Benares by gharry dâk—a\r\nfour-wheeled, venetian-blinded, oblong vehicle, driven by a native with\r\n‘mail post guard’ inscribed on his brass belt-plate, and drawn at the\r\nrate of seven miles an hour by a single horse, the horse being changed\r\nat post-houses at every few miles’ distance. On the way were troops\r\ngoing up with great regularity, travelling 35 miles per day in\r\nbullock-carts, and supplied with comfortable meals and sleeping-places\r\nat the dâk-bungalows. Travelling thus by way of Burdwan, Nimeaghat,\r\nSheergotty, and Noubutpore, he arrived at Benares; this city, ‘long,\r\nstraggling, and Turkish looking,’ was completely commanded by a new fort\r\nat Rajghat, built since the troubles of the preceding summer. Thence to\r\nAllahabad the fields were rich with corn, and the roads thronged by\r\nnatives and trains of bullock-hackeries laden with cotton for the\r\nBenares and Mirzapore markets. Arrived at Allahabad, Mr Russell\r\ncommenced his camp-life, messing generally with some of the officers,\r\nand sleeping under a tent. Viscount Canning and his suite were at that\r\ntime living under canvas within the fort; while all around were\r\nevidences of military preparation for the English regiments sent up from\r\nCalcutta. Thence he travelled for fifty miles by the second portion of\r\nthe great trunk-railway. The rebels in the preceding June had attacked\r\nthe locomotives in an extraordinary way, if his account is to be taken\r\nas anything more than mere raillery: ‘They fired musketry at the engines\r\nfor some time at a distance, as if they were living bodies; then\r\nadvanced cautiously, and finding that the engines did not stir, began to\r\nbelabour them with sticks, all the time calling them names and abusing\r\nthem.’ By horse-dâk Mr Russell proceeded through Futtehpoor to Cawnpore,\r\nwhere he, like all others, was struck with astonishment that poor Sir\r\nHugh Wheeler’s ‘intrenchment’ could ever have held out so long as it\r\ndid. Sir Colin Campbell was then at Cawnpore, living in a small\r\nsubaltern’s tent, working incessantly, and provided with an amount of\r\npersonal ‘baggage’ so marvellously small as to shew how little the old\r\nsoldier regarded luxuries. Mr Russell remained at Cawnpore till the\r\n27th, when he joined the army in the march towards Lucknow. He had\r\nprovided, in true Indian fashion, for the carriage of himself and\r\nbaggage, a saddle-horse, a horse-gharry, and four camels. His account of\r\nthe preparations for his march is not only amusing from the way in which\r\nit is told, but is instructive on matters relating to travelling in\r\nIndia.[137] The end of February found Mr Russell, a civilian immersed in\r\nall the bustle of an army, ready to see and hear whatever the month of\r\nMarch should present to his attention.\r\n\r\nLeaving for the present the commander-in-chief and his army, we shall\r\nbriefly trace the operations, so far as they occurred in the month of\r\nFebruary, of such of his generals as were employed in duties away from\r\nhis immediate control and supervision.\r\n\r\nSir James Outram at once presents claims for notice; for though\r\nappointed general of one of the divisions of the army of Oude, he held\r\nan independent command until the month had expired. During more than\r\nthree months this distinguished officer had never seen Sir Colin\r\nCampbell; during more than five months he had never once been away from\r\nthe vicinity of Lucknow and the Alum Bagh. He marched with Havelock and\r\nNeill from Cawnpore to the capital of Oude in September, and relieved or\r\nrather reinforced Inglis; he commanded the British Residency at Lucknow\r\nduring October, with Havelock and Inglis as his subordinates; he aided\r\nSir Colin to effect the ‘rescue’ in November; and then he commanded at\r\nthe Alum Bagh throughout the whole of December, January, and February.\r\nWhat he did in the first two of these months, we have seen in former\r\nchapters; what were his military proceedings in February, a few lines\r\nwill suffice to shew.\r\n\r\nWhether the enemy supposed that, by another attack on the Alum Bagh,\r\nthey might disturb the extensive plans of the British; whether they were\r\ninfluenced by a sudden impulse to achieve a limited success; or whether\r\nanother motive existed, presently to be mentioned—they fought another\r\nbattle with Sir James Outram, and received their usual defeat. On the\r\nmorning of the 21st of February, no less than 20,000 of the enemy\r\nattacked the Alum Bagh. Having filled all the trenches with as many men\r\nas they could hold, and placed large masses of infantry in the topes as\r\na support, they commenced a simultaneous movement round both flanks of\r\nOutram’s position—threatening at the same time the whole length of\r\nfront, the northeast corner of the Alum Bagh, and the picket and fort at\r\nJelalabad. Outram, perceiving at a glance the nature of the attack,\r\nstrengthened the several endangered points. At the Alum Bagh and\r\nJelalabad posts the enemy received a severe check, having come within\r\nrange of the grape-shot which the British poured out upon them. He\r\ndetached about 250 cavalry, and two field-pieces, under Captain Barrow,\r\nto the rear of Jelalabad; here Barrow came suddenly upon 2000 of the\r\nenemy’s cavalry, and 5000 infantry, whom he kept at bay so effectually\r\nwith his two field-guns, that they were quite frustrated in their\r\nintended scheme of attack. The enemy’s attack on Outram’s left flank was\r\nmade by no fewer than 5000 cavalry and 8000 infantry. To oppose these he\r\nsent only four field-guns and 120 men of the military train, under Major\r\nRobertson; but this mere handful of men, with the guns, drove away the\r\nenemy. A large convoy was at the time on the road from Cawnpore; and the\r\nescort for this convoy had taken away most of Outram’s cavalry. It is\r\nnot surprising that the enemy should select such a time for attacking\r\nthe Alum Bagh and endeavouring to intercept the convoy; but it is\r\ncertainly a matter for wonder that such a large army should suffer\r\nitself to be beaten by a few hundred men. The casualty-list, too, was as\r\nsurprising as anything else; for Outram had only 9 wounded and _none_\r\nkilled; whereas the enemy’s loss was adverted to in the following terms:\r\n‘The reports from the city state the enemy to have lost 60 killed and\r\n200 wounded in their attack on the Alum Bagh, and about 80 or 90 killed\r\nin front of Jelalabad. This was exclusive of their loss on the left\r\nflank, and along our front, where our heavy artillery had constant\r\nopportunities of firing shell and shrapnel into the midst of their\r\nmoving masses. I consider their loss to have been heavier than on any of\r\ntheir previous attacks.’ At this very time the bulk of Sir Colin’s army\r\nwas approaching the Alum Bagh; the enemy well knew that fact, and had\r\nonly been induced to hazard the attack on the 21st by the temporary\r\nabsence of some of Outram’s troops. The attack having failed, they\r\nhastened back to strengthen their defensive arrangements at Lucknow.\r\n\r\nIt may now be well to notice what was doing eastward of Oude. The strong\r\nGoorkha force under Jung Bahadoor, and the effective column of\r\nmiscellaneous troops under Brigadier Franks, had greatly improved the\r\ncondition of that portion of country which lay between Oude and Lower\r\nBengal, around the cities and stations of Patna, Dinapoor, Arrah, Buxar,\r\nGhazeepore, Azimghur, Goruckpore, Jounpoor, Benares, and Mirzapore.\r\nMutineers there were, and marauders connected with rebel chieftains; but\r\ntheir audacity, except in the immediate vicinity of Oude, was checked by\r\nthe increasing power of the forces brought to bear against them.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Franks, one of the most energetic and admired of the officers\r\nwhom the wars of the mutiny brought forth, had since the month of\r\nDecember commanded a column called the Jounpoor Field-force, which had\r\nbeen employed in chastising and expelling bodies of rebels from the\r\nAzimghur, Allahabad, and Jounpoor districts. During these operations, he\r\nhad defeated the enemy at many places. The time was now approaching when\r\nFranks was to join Sir Colin in the final operations against Lucknow;\r\nand when his Jounpoor field-force, losing its individuality, was to form\r\nthe fourth division of infantry in the army of Oude, with Franks as its\r\ngeneral of division. That change, however, was not likely to occur until\r\nthe month of March had arrived. About the middle of February he was with\r\nhis force at Budleepore, a town on the route from Jounpoor to Sultanpore\r\nin Oude. His force comprised H.M. 10th, 20th, and 97th regiments, six\r\nregiments of Goorkhas, and twenty guns. Colonel Puhlwan Singh commanded\r\nthe Goorkhas, and Colonel Maberley the artillery. The force was a strong\r\none, containing 2300 Europeans and 3200 Goorkhas, and an excellent park\r\nof guns. There was one month’s provisions collected; and Franks was\r\nawaiting the orders of Sir Colin for an advance into Oude. Colonel\r\nWroughton was with him, having no distinct military command, but acting\r\nas a medium of communication between Franks and Puhlwan Singh; being\r\nfamiliar with the Goorkhas, his services were valuable in giving such\r\ninstructions to the Nepaulese auxiliaries as would enable them to\r\nunderstand and obey the orders of the brigadier.\r\n\r\nAlthough placed in an expectant attitude, until he could receive\r\ninstructions from Sir Colin, and until he heard of Jung Bahadoor’s\r\ncrossing of the frontier into Oude, Brigadier Franks was quite ripe for\r\nan encounter with the enemy whenever and wherever he could meet with\r\nthem. They gave him an opportunity before the month was out, and he made\r\nample use of it. He crossed the frontier into Oude near Singramow, on\r\nthe 19th, and received speedy proof that a very large body of the enemy\r\nwas before him—ordered, apparently, by the self-appointed authorities at\r\nLucknow, to prevent him from approaching that city. Franks, however,\r\ncleverly deceiving the rebel leader, Nazim Mahomed Hossein, attacked his\r\narmy in detail, first at Chandah and then at Humeerpoor. The section of\r\nthe rebels at Chandah, under Bunda Hossein, comprised among other troops\r\nthe mutinous sepoys of the 20th, 28th, 48th, and 71st Bengal native\r\nregiments. Franks attacked them in a strong position. They were in the\r\nfort and intrenchments, and crowning a long row of hillocks in front of\r\nthe town; every neighbouring tope and village was full of them.\r\nNevertheless he defeated them, and captured six of their guns. Giving\r\nhis troops only a very brief rest, he marched on to Humeerpoor, two or\r\nthree miles distant, on that same evening, and attacked a still larger\r\nforce under the Nazim himself. The defeat was equally significant. ‘Our\r\nEnfield rifles did it all,’ wrote one of the English officers. The enemy\r\nretreated during the night, and Franks and his brave men bivouacked,\r\nafter having, in the two engagements, inflicted a loss on their\r\nopponents of six guns and 800 men killed and wounded. The brigadier\r\nhimself had been in the saddle fifteen hours on this severe day. After\r\nresting on the 20th, Franks and his opponent the Nazim, the one at\r\nHumeerpoor and the other at Warree, sought which should be the first to\r\nobtain possession of the pass, jungle, and fort of Badshaigunje. By a\r\nforced march, the English brigadier outmanœuvred the Nazim, gained the\r\nfort, and waited till reinforcements could reach him. The two forces\r\ncame in sight of each other again on the 23d, by which time the Nazim\r\nand Bunda Hossein had swelled their motley army to no less than 25,000\r\nmen, comprising 5000 revolted sepoys, 1100 sowars, and the rest rabble;\r\nhaving with them 25 guns. The result of this encounter was a severe\r\nbattle, fought near Sultanpore. The enemy had taken up a very wide\r\nposition; their centre resting on the old cantonment and sepoy lines,\r\nthence extending through villages and topes, and screened in front by\r\nhillocks and nullahs. Franks turned the enemy’s right by a detour, drew\r\nthem into a hot struggle, and won a complete victory. No less than 1800\r\ninsurgents were killed and wounded, including two or three rebel\r\nchieftains. The victors captured twenty pieces of artillery, and the\r\nwhole of the enemy’s standing camp, baggage, ammunition, &c. The result\r\nof this battle was that the enemy were frustrated in the attempt to\r\ncheck the advance of Franks into Oude; he found the roads to Lucknow and\r\nFyzabad entirely open to him. If he had had cavalry, he would have\r\npursued and cut up the enemy in retreat; but 250 horse, long and\r\nanxiously expected from Allahabad, did not arrive at Sultanpore until\r\nthe day after the battle. These three actions, two on the 19th and one\r\non the 23d, were marked by that anomaly which the military operations in\r\nIndia so often exhibited—the disparity between the losses on the two\r\nsides. Nothing but a full trust in the truthfulness of a gallant officer\r\nwould render credible the fact that, after conflicts in which 2600 of\r\nthe enemy were killed and wounded, the conqueror could write as follows:\r\n‘I am proud to announce that, through the glorious conduct of the\r\nofficers and men of this force, European and Nepaulese, I have been\r\nenabled by manœuvring to achieve these brilliant results with the loss\r\non our side, in all three actions, of only 2 men killed and 16\r\nwounded’—and this, be it remembered, in contesting against four times\r\nhis own numbers.\r\n\r\nWhile this Jounpoor field-force was thus actively engaged, a small body\r\nof English sailors were slowly advancing by another route into Oude.\r\nEver active to be up and doing, a band of about 250 tars, belonging to\r\nthe steam-frigate _Pearl_, were delighted at being formed into a naval\r\nbrigade, and offered a chance of meeting and well belabouring the\r\n‘Pandies.’ Under Captain Sotheby, they were sent up the river Gogra in\r\nthe Company’s steamer _Jumna_. They embarked near Dinapoor, and\r\ndisembarked on the 20th at Nowraine, twenty miles short of Fyzabad. The\r\nenemy had two forts at that place, both of which were speedily taken,\r\ntogether with guns and ammunition, and the enemy driven away with great\r\nloss. Jung Bahadoor, with his Nepaulese contingent, was at the time not\r\nfar distant; and Colonel Rowcroft, with 2000 Goorkhas, aided in the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Nepaulese leader must now be noticed. The English\r\nofficers frequently, though cautiously, complained of the slowness of\r\nhis movements; and Sir Colin Campbell was becoming impatient for his\r\nappearance near the great scene of conflict at Lucknow. He had been many\r\nweeks in the region around Goruckpore, with a fine army of 9000\r\nGoorkhas; and though he had aided in putting down many bands of\r\ninsurgents, it was now hoped that he would at once advance towards the\r\ncentre of Oude. This he did, but not rapidly, during the month of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, while Jung Bahadoor and Brigadier Macgregor were on the\r\nmarch from Mobarukhpoor to Ukberpoor, on the way to Fyzabad, they\r\nlearned that a small body of rebels were in a fort at Berozepoor. A\r\nportion of the body-guard went to the place, and relied on a promise\r\nmade by the rebels that they would evacuate the fort in forty minutes.\r\nInstead of departing, the enemy prepared for a defence; and a desperate\r\nfight ensued around a small fort distinguished by much novelty of\r\nconstruction. The fort was so completely surrounded by an impenetrable\r\nhedge of bamboos, that the besiegers were in much doubt concerning the\r\nnature of the defences within. At one place they were stopped by a\r\nditch, at another by a high mud-wall and bastion, at another by a row of\r\nlofty bamboo-stakes. The place being very small, an attempt was made to\r\nstorm it by assault; but so many were the obstacles, that a clearance by\r\ncannonade became necessary; and it was not until after much artillery\r\nfiring, and much loss of life, that the fort was captured. So peculiar\r\nwas the construction of the place, that Captain Holland was obliged to\r\ndrag a 6-pounder gun through a bamboo-fence and an outer ditch, before\r\nhe could breach a mud-wall which had until then been invisible. It was\r\ncertainly no small achievement, in a military point of view, for the\r\nenemy to have constructed a fort entirely novel to the besiegers, and\r\ncapable of being defended for several hours by less than forty men\r\nagainst many hundreds. When all was over, Brigadier Macgregor, wishing\r\nto know something more of the nature and construction of this little\r\nfort of Berozepoor, requested Lieutenant Sankey, of the Madras\r\nEngineers, to examine and report thereon—seeing that there might be like\r\nforts elsewhere, with which it would be well to be familiar. Near the\r\nvillage of Berozepoor, then, the fort was built. It was only sixty feet\r\nsquare, with circular bastions at the angles, and a banquette just\r\nwithin the parapet on which musketeers might stand. The mud-rampart was\r\nfifteen feet above the level of the ground, very thick at the bottom and\r\nloopholed for musketry at the top. It was surrounded by a ditch, this\r\nagain by a belt of high bamboos, which was in turn encircled by another\r\nditch ten or twelve feet deep. A row of newly planted bamboo slips,\r\neight or ten feet high, was placed on the immediate lip of the\r\ncounterscarp of the outer ditch. Lieutenant Sankey said in his report:\r\n‘Viewed from the outside, nothing very suspicious or formidable was\r\ndiscoverable about the place. It had all the appearance of an ordinary\r\nclump of bamboos at the corner of a village; which latter, like all\r\ninhabited places in this part of the country, was very well screened in\r\nfoliage.’ He found it, however, ‘a very hedgehog of fortification.\r\nNothing could be more difficult of approach; every portion bristling\r\nwith thorns, and intercepted by ditches and banks.’\r\n\r\nA little must now be said concerning a few isolated operations,\r\nbelonging to the month of February, near the Jumna and the Ganges, in\r\nwhich Seaton, Maxwell, and Hope Grant were concerned. Colonel Seaton, at\r\nthe close of the month, was at Mahomedabad, a few miles distant from\r\nFutteghur. He had with him a detachment of the 82d foot, 300 of De\r\nKantzow’s horse, 350 of De Kantzow’s foot, and 40 Sikh troopers. After\r\nwaiting for the arrival of the 4th Punjaub infantry, the 3d Europeans,\r\nAlexander’s Horse, and nine guns, he was enabled to organise an\r\nefficient column for chastising the rebels in a number of villages\r\naround Futteghur. Those operations, however, scarcely commenced until\r\nthe month of March.\r\n\r\nColonel Maxwell had the gratification of defeating a body of insurgents\r\nwho had for a long time given much anxiety to the British\r\nofficers—anxiety arising from a doubt concerning the plans and movements\r\nof the insurgents. The Gwalior mutineers are here alluded to. They did\r\nnot allow the month to pass away wholly without giving signs of\r\nactivity; though those signs were few and unimportant. Colonel Maxwell,\r\ncommanding a detachment sent out from Cawnpore, suddenly found himself\r\nattacked on the 4th by the mutineers, who marched from Calpee to his\r\ncamp at Bhogneepore. The broken nature of the ground, the cover of the\r\ncrops, and the dimness of the light at five o’clock on a winter’s\r\nmorning, prevented Maxwell from forming a correct estimate of numbers;\r\nbut he had every reason for believing them to be in great strength. He\r\ncould only bring against them five companies of H.M. 88th foot, 50\r\ntroopers, and 2 guns; yet with this small force he maintained a\r\nrunning-fight for four hours. The enemy disputed every inch of the\r\nground, making a stand at Chowra, a place three or four miles distant\r\nfrom the camp. He pursued them until they retreated across a small\r\nriver, keeping up the fire of their skirmishers to the very last. It is\r\ndifficult to understand what could have been the nature of the enemy’s\r\nfire; for while, after the battle, the bodies of eighty rebels were\r\nfound dead upon the field, Colonel Maxwell recorded only five wounded\r\n(none killed) in his own little force. Among the wounded was Lieutenant\r\nThompson, one of the few who escaped alive from Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of February, it became known that bodies of the enemy\r\nwere in motion near the fords or ghats on the left bank of the Ganges,\r\nbetween Futteghur and Cawnpore, ready for any mischief that might\r\npresent itself. To clear away these rebels, a movable column was\r\norganised, consisting of H.M. 34th, 38th, and 53d regiments, squadrons\r\nof the 7th Hussars and 9th Lancers, squadrons of Hodson’s Horse and\r\nWatson’s Horse, a company of Sappers and Miners, and a few guns. This\r\ncolumn was to start from the main Lucknow road at a point near Bunnee,\r\nand to proceed on a line inclining towards the Ganges at such an angle\r\nas to sweep the rebels towards the west, where, at present, they would\r\nbe less mischievous than if near the banks of the river. Sir Hope Grant\r\ntook command of this column, which consisted of 3246 men (2240 infantry,\r\n636 cavalry, 326 artillery, and 44 native Sappers). One of his\r\nachievements with this column consisted in the storming and capture of\r\nthe town of Meeangunje or Meagunje, on the 23d of February. In the\r\ncourse of his various marchings, he learned that a body of the enemy had\r\ntaken up a strong position at Meeangunje, a town between Lucknow and\r\nFutteghur. They had 2000 infantry in the town, 300 cavalry outside, and\r\nfive or six guns. Hope Grant’s force being stronger than theirs, a\r\nvictory was naturally to be expected, although the position was a strong\r\none. Meeangunje was surrounded by a stone wall fourteen feet high, and\r\nhad three strong gates, opening into the Lucknow, Cawnpore, and\r\nRohilcund roads respectively; there were also numerous bastions on all\r\nsides. At each of the gates the enemy placed guns behind strong\r\nbreastworks, and the breastworks themselves were covered by trees. After\r\na careful reconnoitring, Grant found a weak point on the fourth side of\r\nthe town, where he could bring two heavy guns within three or four\r\nhundred yards of the wall, at a place where a postern-gate pierced it.\r\nTelling off part of his force to command the Lucknow road, another part\r\nto the Rohilcund road, and the rest to await behind a village the result\r\nof the cannonading, he opened fire. In less than an hour, the two heavy\r\nguns made a practicable breach in the wall. Grant at once ordered H.M.\r\n53d to advance to the assault. The regiment separated into two wings,\r\none of which, after entering the breach, proceeded under Colonel English\r\nthrough the left of the town; while the other, under Major Payne,\r\npenetrated to the right. This work was admirably done; the infantry\r\nadvancing through a labyrinth of lanes, and driving the enemy before\r\nthem at every yard. The town was captured, and with it six guns. The\r\nenemy, in endeavouring to escape by the several gates, were killed or\r\ncaptured to the number of nearly a thousand altogether. Here occurred\r\nanother of those inexplicable anomalies already adverted to; Sir Hope\r\nGrant, in language too distinct to be misinterpreted, stated that his\r\nloss was only 2 killed and 19 wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Doab had undergone a wonderful improvement during the winter months.\r\nDistrict after district was gradually falling out of the enemy’s hands,\r\nand into the power of the British. Nevertheless, there was much need for\r\ncaution. The insurgents were cunning, and often appeared where little\r\nexpected. The commander-in-chief’s operations, in February as in\r\nDecember, were influenced by the necessity of providing for the safety\r\nof non-combatants escaping from the scenes of strife. In the earlier\r\nmonth, as we have already seen, Sir Colin could not chastise the Gwalior\r\nmutineers until he had sent off the women, children, sick, and wounded\r\nfrom Lucknow to Cawnpore, Futtehpoor, and Allahabad; and now, in\r\nFebruary, he had to secure the passage of a convoy from Agra, comprising\r\na large number of ladies and 140 children. Protected by the 3d Bengal\r\nEuropeans, some irregular horse, and two guns, these helpless persons\r\nleft Agra on the 11th of February, and proceeded by way of Ferozabad and\r\nMinpooree to Cawnpore—thence to be forwarded to Allahabad. On the way,\r\nthe convoy watched narrowly for any indications of the presence of Nena\r\nSahib, who was reported to be in movement somewhere in that quarter.\r\n\r\nOf Delhi, the chief matter here to be noticed, is the trial of the old\r\nimprisoned king, for complicity in the mutiny and its atrocities.\r\nWithout formally limiting the account to the month of February, the\r\ngeneral course of the investigation may briefly be traced.\r\n\r\nThe trial commenced on the 27th of January, in the celebrated imperial\r\nchamber of the Dewani Khas, the ‘Elysium’ where in former days Mogul\r\npower had been displayed in all its gorgeousness. The tribunal was a\r\ncourt-martial, all the members being military officers. The president\r\nwas Colonel Dawes (in lieu of Brigadier Showers, who, though first\r\nappointed, had been obliged to leave for service elsewhere). The other\r\nmembers were Major Palmer, Major Redmond, Major Sawyers, and Captain\r\nRothney. Major Harriott, deputy-judge-advocate-general, officiated as\r\ngovernment prosecutor. The charges against the king were set forth under\r\nfour headings.[138] It may be doubted whether the wearisome legal\r\nphraseology (’to raise, levy, and make insurrection, rebellion, and\r\nwar’—‘treasonably conspire, consult, and agree with,’ &c.) was well\r\nfitted for the purpose; but this may depend on the mode in which the\r\nEnglish was translated into Hindustani.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the spectators to regard without emotion the\r\nappearance of the aged monarch, the last representative of a long line\r\nof Indian potentates, thus brought as a culprit before a tribunal of\r\nEnglish officers. Even those who considered him simply as a hoary-headed\r\nvillain were interested by the proceedings. After being in attendance\r\nsome time, sitting in a palanquin outside the court, under a guard of\r\nRifles, he was summoned within at about noon. He appeared very infirm,\r\nand tottered into court supported on one side by his favourite son,\r\nJumma Bukht, and on the other by a confidential servant. He sat coiled\r\nup on a cushion at the left of the president; and ‘presented such a\r\npicture of helpless imbecility as, under other circumstances, must have\r\nawakened pity.’ His son stood a few yards to the left, and the guard of\r\nRifles beyond all.\r\n\r\nAfter the members of the court, the prosecutor, and the interpreter, had\r\ntaken the usual oaths, the prosecutor proceeded to read the charges\r\nagainst the prisoner. He next addressed the court in a concise and\r\nexplanatory manner; and announced that, though the king would be tried\r\nto ascertain whether he were guilty or not guilty, no capital sentence\r\ncould be passed upon him, in consequence of his life having been\r\nguaranteed to him by Sir Archdale Wilson, through Captain Hodson. When\r\nthe king was asked, through the interpreter, whether he was guilty or\r\ninnocent, he professed to be ignorant of the nature of the charges\r\nagainst him. This, however, was affected ignorance, for the charges had\r\nlong before been presented to him, translated into his own language.\r\nAfter considerable delay, he pleaded ‘not guilty.’\r\n\r\nDuring several sittings of the court, occupying many weeks, numerous\r\nwitnesses were examined. Among them were Jutmull, Mukkhun Lall, Captain\r\nForrest, Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, Hussun Uskeree, Bukhtawar, Kishen,\r\nChunee, Golam, Essamoola Khan, and other persons, European, Eurasian or\r\nhalf-caste, and native. The evidence brought against the king was of\r\nvery varied character, tending to shew that he both aided in inciting\r\nthe mutiny, and in encouraging the atrocities of the mutineers. Some of\r\nthe evidence proved that, so long ago as the summer of 1856, the King of\r\nDelhi had been in correspondence with the Shah of Persia, touching an\r\noverturning of the English ‘raj’ in India: in a manner and at a time\r\ncorresponding with the advance of the Persians towards Herat. Other\r\nportions confirmed the fact that many of the massacres at Delhi, at the\r\nbeginning of the Revolt, were sanctioned by the palace profligates, and\r\neven committed immediately under the king’s own apartments. Sir T.\r\nMetcalfe, in his evidence, stated it as his opinion, derived from an\r\nintimate acquaintance with Delhi and its inhabitants, that the Revolt\r\nwas the legitimate fruit of a Mussulman conspiracy; that the courts of\r\nDelhi and Lucknow were concerned in this conspiracy; that the war with\r\nPersia helped to strengthen it; that the Hindoos were used as tools in\r\nthe matter by the Mohammedans; and that the affair of the greased\r\ncartridges was regarded as a lucky opportunity for enlisting Hindoo\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial the king displayed a mingled silliness and cunning that\r\nrevealed much of his character. Sometimes, while the evidence was being\r\ntaken, he would coil himself up on his cushion, and appear lost in the\r\nland of dreams. Except when anything particular struck him, he paid, or\r\nappeared to pay, no attention whatever to the proceedings. On one of the\r\ndays he was aroused from sleep, to reply to a question put by the court.\r\nSometimes he would rouse up, as if by some sudden impulse, and make an\r\nexclamation in denial of a witness’s statement. Once, when the intrigues\r\nof Persia were under notice, he asked whether the Persians and the\r\nRussians were the same people. On the twelfth day of the trial, the king\r\nwas more animated than usual; he several times declared his innocence of\r\neverything; and amused himself by twisting and untwisting a scarf round\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWithout tracing the incidents of the trial day by day, or quoting the\r\nevidence, it may suffice to say that the guilt of the aged sinner was\r\nsufficiently proved, on some if not all of the charges. The safety of\r\nhis life being guaranteed, imprisonment became the only probable\r\npunishment. He was sentenced for the rest of his days to\r\ntransportation—either to one of the Andaman Islands (a group in the\r\neastern portion of the Bay of Bengal), or to some other place that might\r\nbe selected. It may not be inappropriate to mention that some of the\r\nwitnesses proved that Mr Colvin at Agra, and Sir Theophilus Metcalfe at\r\nDelhi, were told of a forthcoming Mohammedan conspiracy many weeks\r\nbefore the Meerut outbreak; so utterly, however, did these authorities\r\ndisregard the rumour, that they did not even report it to the Calcutta\r\ngovernment. There were only a few men in India, in the spring of 1857,\r\nwho believed that the British ‘raj’ was ‘on the edge of a volcano.’\r\n\r\nIn connection with the fate of the old king, much attention was\r\nnecessarily bestowed on the past conduct of his favourite young wife,\r\nthe intriguing Sultana Zeenat Mahal, the ‘dark, fat, shrewd, but\r\nsensual-looking woman,’ whom Mrs Hodson visited in the prison,[139] in\r\nrelation to the Revolt. Ever since the year 1853, a feud had existed in\r\nthe royal family, arising out of the polygamic troubles so frequent in\r\noriental countries. The king, instigated by Zeenat Mahal, wished to name\r\nthe child of his old age, Mirza Jumma Bukht, heir to the throne of\r\nAkbar; but the British government insisted on recognising the superior\r\nclaims of an elder son, Mirza Fukhr-oo-deen. Strife and contest\r\nimmediately commenced, and never ceased until one obstacle was removed\r\nfrom the path. Mirza Fukhr-oo-deen died in 1856, as alleged, of cholera,\r\nbut not without suspicion of foul play. From that time till the\r\nbeginning of the mutiny in the following year, the imperial palace was a\r\nfocus of intriguing. The sultana bent her whole energies towards\r\nobtaining the heirship to the throne of the Moguls for her own son. She\r\nwas known to have declared that this object would be persistently and\r\nsteadily pursued, and to have opened many communications thereon with\r\nthe authorities at Calcutta. When, however, it was announced that a\r\ngrandson of the king should, after him, possess all that remained of\r\nimperial power, her plans were at once dashed. It thenceforward became a\r\nquestion with her whether, by an overturn of the English ‘raj,’ she\r\ncould obtain that which was denied to her by the government; and when\r\nother sources of revolt and rebellion appeared, there was an\r\nintelligible reason why she should encourage the insurgents. Nothing\r\ncame out at the trial so clear as to fix guilt unquestionably upon her;\r\nbut there remained on men’s minds a suspicion to which collateral\r\ncircumstances afforded much probability.\r\n\r\nTransferring attention from Delhi to Rohilcund and the Hills, it may at\r\nonce be explained that little occurred during the month of February\r\nrequiring detailed notice. The time had not yet arrived when Sir Colin\r\nCampbell could send strong columns to sweep away the rebels in that\r\nquarter. Bareilly was still the head-quarters of a rebel force, which\r\nruled almost the whole of Rohilcund. Khan Bahadoor Khan, the\r\nself-appointed chief, had still around him a large body of revolted\r\nsepoys and insurgent retainers; and in the whole region between Oude on\r\nthe one side, and Delhi and Meerut on the other, very little was under\r\nBritish control. The time, however, for making a demonstration in this\r\nquarter was approaching. Among other military arrangements planned about\r\nthe middle of February, was the formation of a movable column at Meerut,\r\nto be held in readiness to march anywhere at a short notice. It was to\r\nconsist of a squadron of Carabiniers, a wing of the 60th Rifles, a wing\r\nof the Belooch battalion, the 1st Punjaub infantry, the Moultanee horse,\r\na field-battery, two 18-pounders, and one 8-inch howitzer. There was at\r\nthe same time at Looksar, near Roorkee, a small force under Captain\r\nBrind, consisting of a squadron of Carabiniere, Hughes’s irregular\r\ncavalry, detachments of Coke’s Rifles, of the Nusseree battalion, and of\r\nthe 3d Punjaub infantry, and a troop of horse-artillery. At Roorkee\r\nanother corps was to be formed, under Major Coke, to consist of Punjaub\r\nregiments about to arrive. It was proposed that these three bodies—the\r\nmovable column at Meerut, Brind’s corps at Looksar, and Coke’s corps at\r\nRoorkee—should ultimately form a Rohilcund field-force, under General\r\nPenny. What was effected by means of this force, will come for notice in\r\na future page; little could be achieved until the commander-in-chief had\r\nbroken the strength of the enemy in Oude, now the great centre of\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe hilly country in and around Kumaon, although too far removed from\r\nthe Jumna regions to be frequently engaged in the horrors of war, was\r\nnevertheless occasionally made a battle-ground between hostile forces.\r\nEarly in February, Colonel M’Causland, commanding in Kumaon, formed a\r\ncamp at Huldwanee, to protect the Kumaon hills, and to clear the Barbur\r\nand Turale districts of rebels. He found two formidable bodies of the\r\nenemy threatening that region. One, under a leader named Fuzul Huq,\r\nconsisting of 4000 men and 6 guns, was encamped at Sunda, in a strong\r\nposition on the banks of the Sookhee river, about fifteen miles from\r\nHuldwanee, on the Peleebheet road. The other, under Khali Khan,\r\nconsisting of 5000 men and 4 guns, was encamped at Churpurah, on the\r\nPaha Nuddee, sixteen miles from Huldwanee, on the Bareilly road. So far\r\nas could be judged, it appeared as if these 9000 men intended to make a\r\ncombined attack on Huldwanee, and then to force the hill-passes. To\r\nencounter these enemies, M’Causland’s force was but small, consisting of\r\n700 Goorkha infantry, 200 horse, and 2 field-guns; nevertheless he\r\nresolved to confront them boldly. On the 9th of February he commenced a\r\nmovement intended to prevent the junction of the two hostile forces. In\r\nthe dead of the night, leaving his tents to be guarded by a few men in a\r\nbarricaded square called the Mundee, he marched out as quietly as\r\npossible to the place occupied by Khali Khan’s army. He came up to them\r\nat daybreak on the 10th, and found them encamped in a strong position;\r\nwith their rear and left protected by the Paha Nuddee, a small village\r\nfilled with infantry on their right flank, their front protected by\r\nrough ground intersected with nullahs and long jungle-grass, and the\r\nroad commanded by four pieces of artillery. So completely did he\r\nsurprise them, that when his cavalry first appeared, the rebels thought\r\ntheir allies under Fuzul Huq had arrived. Finding the enemy’s right\r\nflank the best to attack, the colonel sent most of his men to that\r\npoint, covered by the fire of his two guns. The contest was sharp and\r\nsevere. In about an hour the Goorkhas had captured the enemy’s guns, cut\r\ndown every artilleryman serving them, and dislodged the enemy from the\r\nvillage. Meanwhile the few horse made a gallant charge, repulsing a\r\nsuperior body of the enemy’s cavalry, and taking a standard. The\r\ncolonel’s two guns worked immense execution among the enemy’s cavalry,\r\n‘into which’ (to use the professional language of the commander) ‘they\r\npoured shrapnel with beautiful precision and tremendous effect.’ The\r\nvictory was complete. The enemy lost their guns, ammunition,\r\nstanding-camp, baggage, 300 killed, and 600 wounded. The colonel, having\r\nthus defeated nearly six times his number, returned to Huldwanee—his\r\ngallant Goorkhas having marched thirty-four miles and fought a severe\r\nbattle in thirteen hours. It was deemed necessary to return at once,\r\nlest their prolonged absence from Huldwanee should tempt Fuzul Huq,\r\nwhose army was not far distant, to make a dash on the camp and station.\r\n\r\nNynee Tal was deeply interested in all these movements. During February\r\nit was hemmed in by the rebels on one side, and by the hill-snows on the\r\nother. The enemy, deterred by the gallant force at Huldwanee, hoped to\r\npenetrate to the little colony by a detour through the Kulleedongee\r\nPass. This hope, however, was not worth much to them; for the pass was\r\nlong and fatiguing; and near its top was a small body of Goorkhas, who,\r\nwith a few guns, were determined to make a stout resistance if any\r\nattack were made.\r\n\r\nThe Punjaub and Sinde were nearly at peace. The few instances of\r\nturbulence, or of military operation, may pass without record here.\r\n\r\nIn that vast range of country which has in so many chapters required\r\nattention, comprising Rajpootana, Gujerat, Central India, the Mahratta\r\nStates, Bundelcund, and the Saugor territories, the month of February\r\nexhibited the gradual strengthening of British columns sent up from\r\nBombay and Madras, and the success of numerous small engagements in\r\nwhich the names of Rose, Roberts, Orr, Whitlock, Stuart, Steuart, and\r\nother officers are concerned. Being small in themselves, these\r\nengagements hardly need separate notice; but taken collectively, they\r\ntended to assist the commander-in-chief’s plans towards the general\r\npacification of India.\r\n\r\nThe month of February witnessed the conclusion of a series of services\r\nrendered by a small force under somewhat remarkable circumstances.\r\nMention has frequently been made of Captain Osborne, political agent at\r\nRewah, almost the only Englishman within a turbulent district.\r\nFortunately, the Rajahs of Rewah and Nagode remained faithful to the\r\nBritish; they, with the aid of Osborne, formed a corps of such of their\r\nnative troops as they felt could be trusted; and this corps was placed\r\nunder Colonel Hinde for active service. It was November when the corps\r\nwas first organised; but, the troops being undisciplined, badly\r\nequipped, and badly armed, and the arrangements for marching and camping\r\nbeing very defective, it was the middle of December before the corps\r\nstarted from the town of Rewah. The duty to be performed was to keep\r\nopen and safe the road from Rewah to Jubbulpoor (one of the great\r\nhighways of India), and to capture such forts by the way as were in\r\nhostile hands. Imperfect as were the materials at his command, Colonel\r\nHinde nevertheless, between the middle of December and the middle of\r\nFebruary, captured six forts, forty guns, two mortars, and two\r\nstandards; rendered the great road to the Deccan secure; re-established\r\ndâk and police bungalows; restored order in the Myhere territory;\r\nannexed the small territory of the rebellious chieftains of\r\nBijeeragooghar; appointed tehsildars and police therein; and captured a\r\nlarge number of turbulent rebels. The six forts taken were Kunchunpore,\r\nGoonah, Myhere, Jokai, Khunwara, and Bijeeragooghar. These services\r\nhaving been rendered, Captain Osborne recalled the corps to Rewah; and\r\nthe governor-general thanked both him and Colonel Hinde for what they\r\nhad effected in a troubled region, with very limited means. It is\r\npleasant—amid the treachery of so many ‘Pandies’ and ‘Singhs’—to read\r\nthat Osborne and Hinde had a good word to say for Dinbund Pandy, Lullaie\r\nSingh, Sewgobind Pandy, Davy Singh, and Bisseshur Singh—Rewah and Nagode\r\nnative officers, who were both faithful and brave in the hour of need.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Whitlock, with a Madras column, was rendering service in the\r\ncountry between Nagpoor and Bundelcund. He had various skirmishes with\r\nbands of rebels at Jubbulpoor and Sleemanabad; and when he had restored\r\nsomething like order in that region, he moved off towards Cawnpore,\r\nthere to take part if necessary in the operations of the army of Oude.\r\n\r\nFew Europeans in India had better reason than those at Saugor to welcome\r\nthe approach of some of their countrymen as deliverers. So far back as\r\nthe month of June, the officers, their ladies, and the civilians, had\r\nbeen shut up in the fort by orders of Brigadier Sage, on account of the\r\nsuspicious symptoms presented by the 31st, 42d, and other native\r\nregiments. There they remained throughout the whole of the autumn and\r\npart of the winter, too strong to be seriously molested, and too well\r\nsupplied with food to suffer those privations which were so sadly\r\nexperienced at Lucknow. Sir Hugh Rose arrived with his force at Saugor\r\non the 3d of February, and liberated those who had so long been confined\r\nwithin the fort. No battle was needed to effect this; for though the\r\ngarrison were almost entirely without reliable troops, they were not\r\nbesieged by any considerable force of the enemy. Rose, who had collected\r\na force with much difficulty from various quarters, prepared after the\r\nrelief of Saugor to attack numerous bands of rebels in that part of\r\nIndia. He assaulted the strong fortress of Garra Kotah, at the\r\nconfluence of the Sonah and the Guddarree; he captured it, pursued and\r\ncut up the enemy, and then marched towards Jhansi, where busy work\r\nawaited him in the following month.\r\n\r\nGeneral Roberts, towards the close of February, was collecting a force\r\nat and near Nuseerabad, for operations in that part of Rajpootana. He\r\nwent with the head-quarters of H.M. 95th from Deesa to Beaur, and thence\r\nto Nuseerabad, where he arrived on the 22d. He was to be joined shortly\r\nafterwards by the 72d Highlanders from Deesa, and by 200 of the Sinde\r\nhorse under Major Green; and when strengthened by other regiments,\r\nespecially a good body of cavalry, he intended to march towards Kotah, a\r\nvery strong fortress which had long been in the hands of a rebel\r\nchieftain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Moulvies, or Mohammedan Religious Teachers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe regions forming the central and southern portions of the Bombay\r\npresidency were a little disturbed by fanatical Mohammedans, who, though\r\nunable to bring any very large number of conspirators into their plan of\r\naction, did nevertheless make many attempts to raise the green flag, the\r\nsymbol of Moslem supremacy. There were no mutinies of whole regiments,\r\nhowever, or even companies of regiments. Indeed the instigators of\r\nmischief were rather rioters than soldiers; and the authorities only\r\nregarded these outbreaks seriously as sparks that might possibly kindle\r\ninflammable materials elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Nizam’s country, generally peaceful on account of his fidelity to\r\nthe English, became a field of temporary struggle owing to the\r\ninsubordination of a minor chieftain, the Rajah of Shorapore. His small\r\nterritory, bounded on one side by the river Kistnah, occupied an angle\r\nin the dominions of the Nizam. Wishing, perhaps, to rise from the rank\r\nof a petty chieftain to one of greater power, he had for some time\r\ndisplayed hostility towards the British. But his career now came to an\r\nend. A force left Belgaum at the end of January, to advance to\r\nShorapore; another left Kulladghee for the same destination; while a\r\nthird advanced from Madras. The Nizam, at the same time, acting in\r\nharmony with his prime minister and Colonel Davidson, issued a\r\nproclamation denouncing as rebels any of his subjects who should assist\r\nthe chief of Shorapore. These various measures had the desired result;\r\nthe insurgents were dispersed, Shorapore seized, and the chief made\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nIn reference to such occurrences as the one described in the last\r\nparagraph, it may be observed that many of the residents, or British\r\nrepresentatives at the courts of native princes, exhibited a wisdom and\r\nintrepidity which claim for them a rank by the side of the military\r\nheroes whose names are much better known to the world. Such a one was\r\nColonel Davidson, British resident at the Nizam’s court at Hyderabad in\r\nthe Deccau. During many months, he, with a few hundred faithful troops,\r\nmaintained English prestige amongst a fanatic Mussulman population of\r\ntwo or three hundred thousand men, who often threatened the handful of\r\nBritish in the city. ‘Disaffected persons,’ a well-informed authority\r\nhas said, ‘thronged to the Nizam’s palace by day and by night, with\r\nimprecations upon their lips against Europeans. It was impossible to\r\ntell when mutiny might break out among the native soldiers; and it was\r\ncertain that the rabble were only awaiting their opportunity to glut\r\nthemselves with English blood. Yet amidst all this the British resident\r\nnever faltered or wavered; and by mere force of character he preserved\r\npeace in the city and district, and succeeded in securing to our side\r\nthe Nizam and his minister Salar Jung. This Salar Jung was a young and\r\nwell-educated man, who for his friendship to the British was hated by\r\nthe Mussulmans.’ The position of this minister was almost as dangerous\r\nas that of the resident; for if the attack of the 17th of July[140] had\r\nsucceeded, he would have shared the common fate of the British. Colonel\r\nDavidson not only secured Hyderabad, but was subsequently enabled to\r\nsend a considerable cavalry force for service elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAmong other political arrangements of the month, was the termination of\r\na short governorship in the regions around Allahabad. On the 4th of\r\nAugust, in the preceding year, after the Northwest Provinces had been\r\nthrown into anarchy by the mutiny, a ‘lieutenant governorship of the\r\nCentral Provinces’ was established, and placed in the hands of Mr John\r\nPeter Grant, one of the members of the Supreme Council at Calcutta. A\r\nfew weeks afterwards, on the 19th of September, some of the other\r\nprovinces in the Jumna regions were placed under a ‘chief-commissioner\r\nof the Northwest Provinces.’ Both of these offices were abolished by the\r\ngovernor-general in council, on the 9th of February; and Viscount\r\nCanning, then at Allahabad, took under his immediate authority and\r\ncontrol the whole of the provinces lately placed under those officers.\r\nHe became in fact, though not in name, and for a temporary period,\r\ngovernor of a presidency of which Allahabad was the capital. At or about\r\nthe same time, Meerut and Delhi were handed over to the\r\nchief-commissioner of the Punjaub. Thus, all the political power between\r\nCalcutta and the Afghan frontier being in the hands of Canning and\r\nLawrence, and all the military power in Sir Colin Campbell, it was hoped\r\nthat greater energy and precision would be thrown into the combined\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  _Sir Colin Campbell’s Army of Oude._—On the 10th of February, as\r\n  stated in the text of this chapter, the commander-in-chief made a\r\n  formal announcement of the component elements of the army with which\r\n  he was about to enter Oude. These particulars we give here in a\r\n  note, as a permanent record of an interesting matter in the military\r\n  history of the Revolt. It must be clearly borne in mind, however,\r\n  that this army of Oude comprised only such troops as were at that\r\n  date under the immediate command of Sir Colin. Columns, corps, and\r\n  field-forces, under Franks, Seaton, Jung Bahadoor, Macgregor,\r\n  Windham, Van Cortlandt, Penny, M’Causland, Greathed, Roberts, Rose,\r\n  Steuart, Stuart, Whitlock, and other officers, were rendering active\r\n  or defensive services in various parts of India; and it depended on\r\n  the course of circumstances whether any and which of these could\r\n  assist in the grand operations against Lucknow.\r\n\r\n                             ‘_Head-quarters, Camp Cawnpore, Feb. 10._\r\n\r\n  ‘The troops now in Oude, and those advancing into that province, are\r\n  formed into divisions and brigades, and staff-officers are attached\r\n  us follows; the whole being under the personal command of his\r\n  Excellency the Commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n  ‘Such appointments as now appear for the first time will take effect\r\n  from this date.\r\n\r\n  Artillery Division.\r\n\r\n  ‘Staff.—Major-general Sir A.

They talked more frequently and fiercely about fighting for\r\n  the faith; and they dragged into the meshes of a net many Hindoos\r\n  who would otherwise have remained free from treasonable\r\n  entanglement. Several native proclamations have been noticed in\r\n  earlier chapters of this work; and we now present another,\r\n  illustrative of Mussulman intrigues. It purports to come from Prince\r\n  Mirza Mahomed Feroze Shah, and was dated the 3d of Rujub 1274,\r\n  corresponding to the 17th of February 1858:\r\n\r\n  ‘Be it known to all the Hindoo and Mohammedan inhabitants of India\r\n  that to rule over a country is one of the greatest blessings from\r\n  Heaven, and it is denied to a tyrant or an oppressor. Within the\r\n  last few years the British commenced to oppress the people in India\r\n  under different pleas, and contrived to eradicate Hindooism and\r\n  Mohammedanism, and to make all the people embrace Christianity. The\r\n  Almighty Power observing this, diverted the hearts of the people to\r\n  a different course, and now every one has turned to annihilate the\r\n  English, and they have nearly done so. Through avarice and ambition,\r\n  the British have shewn some resistance, though in vain. Through\r\n  Divine mercy, that will in a short time be reduced to nothing. Let\r\n  this also be known to all the Hindoos and Mussulmans, that the\r\n  English bear the bitterest enmity towards them. Should they again\r\n  become predominant in this country—which, God forbid—they will\r\n  destroy religion, property, and even the life of every one. A brief\r\n  sketch of the views and intentions of the Supreme Court and\r\n  Parliament is hereby given, in order to warn the people that they\r\n  should get rid of habits of negligence, and strive in unity to\r\n  destroy the infidels. When the Indian troops mutinied to save their\r\n  religion, and killed all infidels in several places, the wise men of\r\n  England were of opinion that had the British authorities in India\r\n  kept the following things in view, the mutiny would never have\r\n  broken out: 1. They should have destroyed the race of the former\r\n  kings and nobles. 2. They should have burnt all books of every other\r\n  religion. 3. They should not have left even a biswa of ground to any\r\n  of the native rulers. 4. They should have intermarried among the\r\n  natives, so that after a short time all would have become one race.\r\n  5. They should not have taught the use of artillery to the natives.\r\n  6. They should not have left arms among the natives. 7. They should\r\n  not have employed any native until he consented to eat and drink\r\n  with Europeans. 8. The mosques and Hindoo temples should not have\r\n  been allowed to stand. 9. Neither Moulvies nor Brahmins should have\r\n  been allowed to preach. 10. The several cases brought into the\r\n  courts should have been decided according to English laws. 11.\r\n  English priests should have performed all nuptial ceremonies of the\r\n  natives according to their English customs. 12. All prescriptions of\r\n  the Hindoo and Mussulman physicians should have been prohibited, and\r\n  English medicines furnished instead. 13. Neither Hindoo nor\r\n  Mussulman fakeers should have been allowed to convert people without\r\n  the permission of English missionaries. 14. European doctors only\r\n  should have been allowed to assist native women in childbed.—But the\r\n  authorities did not take means to introduce these measures. On the\r\n  contrary, they encouraged the people: so much so, that they at last\r\n  broke out. Had the authorities kept in view the maxims above alluded\r\n  to, the natives would have remained quiet for thousands of years.\r\n  These are now the real intentions of the English; but all of us must\r\n  conjointly exert ourselves for the protection of our lives,\r\n  property, and religion, and to root out the English from this\r\n  country. Thus we shall, indeed, through Divine mercy, gain a great\r\n  victory over them. I (the prince) now draw a brief sketch of my\r\n  travels, and I hope the people will pay attention to what I say.\r\n  Before the destruction of the English, I went on a pilgrimage to\r\n  Mecca, and on my return I observed that the English were in a bad\r\n  and hazardous position. I therefore offered thanks to God, because\r\n  it is in my nature to follow the principles of my religion and to\r\n  promulgate justice. I persuaded many at Delhi to raise a religious\r\n  war; I then hastened towards Gwalior, where the majority of the\r\n  military officers promised to kill the English and take up my cause.\r\n  A small portion of the Gwalior army accompanied me. I had not the\r\n  least intention to announce war before I had everything in order;\r\n  but the army became very enthusiastic, and commenced fighting with\r\n  the enemy (the English). Though our army was then but a handful, and\r\n  that of the enemy very large in numbers, still we fought manfully;\r\n  and, though apparently we were defeated, in reality we were\r\n  victorious over our enemy, for we killed 1000 of them. Since then I\r\n  have been collecting as well as exhorting the people. I have exerted\r\n  myself in procuring ammunition up to this day, now four months since\r\n  the commencement. Thank God, an army of 150,000 old and new men are\r\n  now bound by a solemn oath to embrace my cause. I have collected\r\n  considerable treasury and munitions of war in many places, and in a\r\n  short time I shall clear the country of all infidels. Since the real\r\n  purpose of this war is to save religion, let every Hindoo and\r\n  Mussulman render assistance to the utmost. Those that are old should\r\n  offer their prayers. The rich, but old, should assist our sacred\r\n  warriors with money. Those in perfect health, as well as young,\r\n  should attend in person. But all those who are in the service of\r\n  either Mirza Birjish Kadur Bahadoor in Lucknow and of Khan Bahadoor\r\n  Khan at Bareilly should not venture out to join us, for these rulers\r\n  are themselves using their best endeavours to clear the country of\r\n  all infidels. All who join us should do so solely with a view of\r\n  promulgating their religion, not with that of worldly avarice. Thus\r\n  victory will certainly smile upon us; then distinguished posts will\r\n  be conferred on the people at large. The delay in defeating the\r\n  English has been caused by people killing innocent children and\r\n  women without any permission whatever from the leaders, whose\r\n  commands were not obeyed. Let us all avoid such practices, and then\r\n  proclaim a sacred war. Lastly, the great and small in this campaign\r\n  will be equal, for we are waging a religious war. I (the prince) do\r\n  now proclaim a sacred war, and exhort all, according to the tenets\r\n  of their religion, to exert themselves. The rest I leave to God. We\r\n  shall certainly conquer the English, consequently I invite the\r\n  people again to my assistance.—Printed at Bareilly, by Shaick Nisar\r\n  Ally, under the supervision of Moulvie Mahomed Kootoob Shah.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  ‘I have not as yet said one word of the two other camels which were\r\n  appointed to carry my tent. Under the eaves of that tent had gathered\r\n  a strange population—they came as sparrows come to a house, without\r\n  the knowledge or consent of the owner; but the analogy fails in other\r\n  respects except noise, because the natives require to be paid. There\r\n  are two men who belong to the tent-post, as in England certain\r\n  gentlemen belong to horses; then there is a man to carry water, who\r\n  belongs to a large skin to contain that liquid; next there is a\r\n  cleaner or sweeper; then there is a khitmutgar or servant, and there\r\n  is his and my master, one Simon, “an assizes man” he says himself, but\r\n  he only means that he is a follower of St Francisco d’Assisi; and then\r\n  follow camel-keepers, and horse-keepers, and grass-cutters; so that I\r\n  feel very much as Sancho did in his government of Barataria. On the\r\n  morning of the 27th, soon after midnight, commenced a tumult in camp,\r\n  the like of which I never heard before; first began a loud tapping of\r\n  all the tent-pegs, as if an army of gigantic woodpeckers were\r\n  attacking us. This was caused by the kélassies, or tent-men, loosening\r\n  the tent-pegs, so that they might be drawn easily from the ground when\r\n  the word to march was given. Then followed a most hideous grumbling,\r\n  growling, roaring noise, as if many thousands of aldermen were choking\r\n  all at once, only that it was kept up for hours; that was caused by\r\n  the camels objecting to the placement of the smallest article on their\r\n  backs, and continuing their opposition till they stalked off with\r\n  their loads. Then came the trumpeting of elephants, the squeaking of\r\n  bullock cart-wheels, the hum and buzz of thousands of voices, and at\r\n  last the first bugle-call, which announced that the time for turning\r\n  out had arrived. Daylight was still striving with the moonlight for\r\n  mastery, and casting a sort of neutral tint over the camping-ground,\r\n  on which blazed the flames of many watch-fires, when the heads of our\r\n  columns began to cross the bridge of boats at Cawnpore. There was but\r\n  a waste of baked earth where, at sunset, had been a camp—only a few\r\n  tents belonging to the commander-in-chief and the head-quarters’\r\n  staff, were left behind; and for hours the bridge echoed to the tramp\r\n  of men and horse, the rumble of artillery, and the tread of\r\n  innumerable elephants, and camels, and oxen. The Ganges is at this\r\n  season at its lowest, and the bridges are not, I should think, more\r\n  than 300 yards long; one is used for the exit, the other for the\r\n  entrance of Cawnpore. They lead to a level sandy plain, overflowed by\r\n  the Ganges for several hundred yards in the rainy season, on which\r\n  there were now moving, as far as the eye could reach, the strings of\r\n  baggage animals and the commissariat carts of the army, with their\r\n  fantastic followers.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n   ‘COPY OF CHARGES PREFERRED AGAINST MAHOMED BAHADOOR SHAH, EX-KING OF\r\n                                  DELHI.\r\n\r\n  ‘1.

The city which, excepting\r\na small portion near and around the Residency, had been wholly in the\r\nhands of the rebels since the beginning of July, was to revert to the\r\nCompany’s possession in March, by a series of military operations which\r\nit is the purpose of this chapter to trace.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary events in that city have been too frequently dwelt on\r\nin past chapters to render any lengthened notice here necessary. The\r\nreader will only have to bear in mind that Lawrence maintained the\r\nResidency intact until his death early in July; that Inglis continued\r\nthe defence until September; that Outram and Havelock held the same\r\nposition until November; and that from thence to March the city was\r\nwholly in the hands of the enemy—the Alum Bagh alone being held by\r\nOutram. Concerning the buildings and general arrangement of Lucknow, it\r\nmay be useful here to freshen the recollection by a few descriptive\r\ndetails. The city lies on the right bank of the river Goomtee, which\r\nthere runs nearly from northwest to southeast. All the buildings on the\r\nopposite or left bank of the river are merely suburban. After winding\r\nround the buildings called the Martinière and the Dil Koosha, the river\r\nchanges its course towards the south. The southeastern extremity of the\r\ncity is bounded by a canal, which enters the Goomtee near the\r\nMartinière. There is no defined boundary on the southwest, west, or\r\nnorthwest, the urban giving way to the rural in the same gradual way as\r\nin most English towns. Between the crowded or commercial part of the\r\ncity, and the river, extends—or extended at the time of the Revolt (for\r\nit will be convenient to adopt the past tense in this description)—a\r\nlong series of palaces and gardens, occupying collectively an immense\r\narea, and known by the several names of the Taree Kothee, Fureed Buksh,\r\nPyne Bagh, Chuttur Munzil, Kaiser Bagh, Shah Munzil, Motee Mehal, Shah\r\nNujeef, Secunder Bagh, &c. Still further in the same line, were the\r\nbuildings once famous as the Residency, the Muchee Bhowan, the great\r\nEmanbarra, and the Moosa Bagh. In short, for a distance of at least five\r\nmiles, there was a string of royal or governmental buildings along the\r\nright bank of the river, forming a belt between it and the poorer or\r\ndenser streets of the city. There was a stone bridge beyond the Muchee\r\nBhowan, an iron bridge near the Residency, and—in peaceful times—a\r\nbridge of boats near the Motee Mehal. As to the general aspect of the\r\ncity, when seen from a distance, writers have been at a loss for similes\r\napplicable to it, owing chiefly to the vast space over which the\r\nbuildings are dotted. ‘If,’ in the quaint words of one writer, ‘Clapham\r\nwere overrun by a Mohammedan conqueror, who stuck up domes, cupolas, and\r\nminarets on half the meeting-houses and mansions; and if that pleasant\r\nsuburb, when all the trees are green, were spread for eighteen or twenty\r\nmiles over a dead level surface—the aspect it would present might in\r\nsome degree give one a notion of Lucknow.’\r\n\r\nThe city, in the interval between November and March, had been fortified\r\nby the rebels in great strength. Although not enclosed like Delhi by a\r\nfortified wall, its many square miles of area, full of narrow streets\r\nand high houses, and occupied by an enormous military force in addition\r\nto the ordinary population, constituted a formidable stronghold in\r\nitself. But the rebels did not neglect the usual precautions of\r\ndefensive warfare. Rightly judging that the English commander would\r\navoid a hand-to-hand contest in the streets, and would direct his attack\r\ntowards the southeastern suburb, they spared no labour in strengthening\r\nthat side of the city. In considering their plan of fortification, they\r\ntreated the courts and buildings of the Kaiser Bagh as a sort of\r\ncitadel, and interposed a triple series of obstacles between it and the\r\nbesiegers. First, exterior of the three, was a line of defence extending\r\nfrom the river to a building known as Banks’s house, once occupied by\r\nMajor Banks; the canal formed the wet ditch of this line, and within the\r\ncanal was a rampart or elevated earthwork. The second defence consisted\r\nof an earthwork beginning at the river-side near the Motee Mehal, the\r\nMess-house, and the Emanbarra. The third or interior defence was the\r\nprincipal rampart of the Kaiser Bagh itself. All these lines consisted\r\nof well-constructed earthen parapets or ridges, fronted by wide and deep\r\nditches, and strengthened at intervals by bastions. Not relying wholly\r\non these formidable lines, the enemy had loopholed and fortified almost\r\nevery house and enclosure, constructed strong counter-guards in front of\r\nthe gateways, and placed isolated bastions, stockades, and traverses\r\nacross the principal streets. The three lines of defence all abutted at\r\none end on the river Goomtee, and at the other on the great street or\r\nroad called the Huzrutgunje; which street was among the principal of\r\nthose loopholed and bastioned. It was estimated that the enemy defended\r\ntheir works with nearly 100 guns and mortars. The insurgent troops were\r\nvariously computed at 40,000 to 80,000 in number; the estimate could not\r\nbe a precise one, because it was impossible to determine how many\r\npeasants from the country or desperate characters from the city joined\r\nthe regular sepoys. There is, however, reason to believe that, at the\r\nbeginning of March, the city contained 30,000 revolted sepoys, 50,000\r\nvolunteers and armed retainers of chieftains, and an ordinary city\r\npopulation of no less than 300,000 souls. It was a terrible thought that\r\na city should be bombarded containing so large a number of living\r\nbeings; but, as one of the stern necessities of the war, it was\r\nimperative. The chieftains of Oude, and the revolted sepoys of the\r\nCompany’s army, were there in great number; and until they were subdued,\r\nnothing could be effected towards the pacification of this part of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place here to notice a few of the individuals who,\r\nduring the interregnum in Oude, assumed sovereign or governing power.\r\nThe newly set up king was a boy of eight or ten years old, a son of the\r\ndeposed king living at that time under surveillance at Calcutta. As a\r\nboy, he was a puppet in the hands of others. The prime mover in all the\r\nintrigues was his mother, the Begum Huzrut Mehal, who professed to be\r\nregent during his minority, and to be assisted by a council of state.\r\nShe was a woman of much energy of character, and conducted public\r\naffairs in an apartment of the Kaiser Bagh. Morally she was tainted in\r\nfull measure with oriental vices. Like Catherine of Russia she raised\r\none of her paramours, Mummoo Khan, to the office of chief judge, and did\r\nnot scruple openly to acknowledge her relations towards him. “While\r\nexecuting the Begum’s commands in all that related to the management of\r\nthe newly formed government, he enriched himself at the expense of the\r\npeople generally. The chief minister was one Shirreff-u-Dowlah, and the\r\ngeneralissimo Hissamut-u-Dowlah; but Mummoo Khan, held up by courtly\r\nfavour, had sources of power superior to both. Another notability was a\r\nMoulvie or Mussulman fanatic who, though professing allegiance to the\r\nboy-king of Oude, was suspected of aiming at the throne himself. Most of\r\nthe officers of the government purchased their places by large gifts to\r\nthe Begum or her favourite, knowing that they would obtain an ample\r\nreturn during the anarchy of the period. The eunuchs of the royal\r\npalaces held, nominally if not really, military commands. The whole city\r\nof Lucknow, it is quite evident, was a hideous mass of intrigue, in\r\nwhich the various members of the royal family sought how best they could\r\nobtain power and wealth at the expense of the bulk of the people; while\r\ntheir ministers and officers were parasitical just so far as might be\r\nsubservient to their own interests. The trading classes generally had\r\nvery little reason to rejoice at the temporary cessation of the British\r\n‘raj.’ The Begum and the Moulvie leader were regarded as the chief\r\ninstruments in the opposition to the British. Every measure was resorted\r\nto that could raise the fanaticism of the native population. The\r\nEnglish, and especially their Sikh allies, were represented as\r\nsystematically murdering all who fell into their hands. On one occasion,\r\nshortly before the arrival of Sir Colin, the Begum rode through the\r\nstreets of the city on an elephant, as one might imagine our Elizabeth\r\nappearing before her troops at Tilbury; and she used all her arts to\r\ninduce the several chieftains to make her cause theirs.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries settled, the narrative may be proceeded with. How\r\nthe troops under the commander-in-chief approached Lucknow in February,\r\nand what were the components of the army of Oude, in generals and\r\nsoldiers, the last chapter shewed.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 1st of March, Sir Colin Campbell was within a few miles of\r\nLucknow, in his camp at Buntara, he fully considered all the information\r\nobtainable up to that time concerning the defences of the city. One\r\nresult of the inquiry, was to convince him that a necessity would arise\r\nfor operating from both sides of the Goomtee river, whenever the actual\r\nassault should take place.[141] This would be necessary, or at least\r\ndesirable, because such a course would enable him to enfilade (that is,\r\nattack laterally or at the extremities) many of the enemy’s newly\r\nconstructed works; and because he would thus be able to cut off the\r\nenemy from their external sources of supply. It is true that he could\r\nnot hope wholly to surround a city which, with its fortified suburbs,\r\nhad a circuit of little less than twenty miles; still he would make an\r\nimportant approach towards that condition by cannonading from both sides\r\nof the river. One of his earliest preparations, therefore, had relation\r\nto the means of crossing the river; and to this end his engineers were\r\nbusily engaged in fitting casks so that they might be placed across the\r\nriver as a floating-bridge. The former bridge of boats, opposite some of\r\nthe palaces, had been removed by the insurgents; while the iron and\r\nstone bridges were well watched by them.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d, Sir Colin marched at daybreak from his camp at Buntara,\r\ndiverged from the road to the Alum Bagh, and took that which went near\r\nthe Jelalabad fort towards the eastern margin of the suburbs. With a\r\nportion only of his army, he advanced to the Dil Koosha, the palace and\r\npark at the easternmost extremity of the city. The chief officers with\r\nhim at the time of this advance were Generals Lugard, Adrian Hope, Hope\r\nGrant, Little, and Archdale Wilson. His main object at first, with a\r\nforce of five or six thousand men, was to march to such a spot, near the\r\nDil Koosha, as would enable him to form a camp just beyond reach of the\r\nenemy’s guns; and to protect his enormous siege-train as it gradually\r\narrived, until the time was come for commencing active operations. Not\r\nonly the siege-train, but the countless appendages of an Indian army,\r\nwould equally require protection during its passage from Buntara to the\r\nDil Koosha. Mr Russell, who accompanied this expedition in person, says\r\nthat no language can correctly convey an idea of the vastness in the\r\nnumber of elephants, camels, oxen, horses, camp-followers, and vehicles\r\nthat daily demanded the commander-in-chief’s attention at this period.\r\n‘Who really can bring before his mind’s eye a train of baggage-animals\r\ntwenty-five miles long, a string of sixteen thousand camels, a\r\nsiege-train park covering a space of four hundred by four hundred yards,\r\nwith twelve thousand oxen attached to it, and a following of sixty\r\nthousand non-combatants?’ Even the doolies or litter-carriages for\r\nwounded men constituted a formidable item. To each company of a regiment\r\nthere were ten doolies, and to each dooly were six coolies or native\r\nporters: thus there were nearly five hundred dooly-carriers for each\r\naverage regiment; and even with this large supply, if the sick and\r\nwounded in any one regiment exceeded eighty men, there would be more\r\nthan the coolies could properly attend to.\r\n\r\nThe force with which Sir Colin started from Buntara brought a few guns\r\nonly. These were dragged along the centre of the line of route; the\r\ninfantry were on either side of them, the cavalry and horse-artillery\r\noutside all, and the baggage in the rear. Each soldier took a small\r\nquantity of food with him. The march was through a flat well-cultivated\r\ncountry, past the Jelalabad fort, but a mile or so distant from the Alum\r\nBagh. The skirmishers at the head of the column, as they approached the\r\nDil Koosha, found a body of insurgent troopers watching their progress.\r\nWhen the column began to close on the advance-guard, the enemy opened\r\nfire with several guns which were in position in strong bastions along\r\nthe line of canal—the outermost of the three lines of defence before\r\nadverted to. This fire was heavy and well sustained. It was not\r\ndifficult to capture the Dil Koosha itself; but Sir Colin’s troops were\r\nmuch annoyed by the enemy’s fire over the open country, until they could\r\nsecure the Dil Koosha and the Mahomed Bagh as advanced pickets, with\r\nheavy guns placed in battery to oppose the enemy’s artillery. This once\r\neffected, a secure base for further operations was obtained, with the\r\nright resting on the river. It was a good day’s work, not in conquest,\r\nbut in the preparations for conquest.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Colin came to reconnoitre the enemy’s position, he found that\r\nthe new lines of defence, constructed since November, were vast and well\r\nplanned. He further saw that no immediate attack could be successfully\r\nmade upon them by infantry, without such a sacrifice of life as he had\r\ndetermined if possible to avoid. To fight with artillery, before sending\r\nin his foot-soldiers to fight, was his plan; and he now at once sent\r\nback a messenger to the camp at Buntara, for the rest of the troops and\r\nheavy siege-artillery to advance without delay. All during the following\r\nnight was the road from Buntara to the Dil Koosha filled with an\r\napparently endless train of soldiers, guns, commissariat-carts, beasts\r\nof burden and of draught, and camp-followers—ready to swell the large\r\nnumber already at the last-named place. This train was protected on\r\neither side by cavalry and horse artillery, ready to dash out against\r\nany of the enemy that should threaten interruption.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole day on the 3d, the operations consisted chiefly in this\r\nbringing forward of guns and bodies of troops to positions necessary to\r\nbe occupied when the regular siege began. When the remainder of the\r\nsiege-train had arrived, and also General Walpole’s division, Sir\r\nColin’s position embraced all the open ground on the southeastern margin\r\nof the city, with his right flank resting on the Goomtee, and his left\r\nin the direction of the Alum Bagh. The Alum Bagh and the Jelalabad fort\r\nwere both occupied by portions of his troops, and the country between\r\nthem was controlled by Hodson’s Irregular Horse; while a strong brigade\r\nof cavalry, under Brigadier W. Campbell, swept the suburbs northwest of\r\nthe Alum Bagh. By this arrangement, almost the entire southern half of\r\nthe city was invested by his forces. The Dil Koosha was head-quarters,\r\nsurrounded by the tents in which the soldiers took their few brief hours\r\nof repose. The palace, built in an Italian style, still retained much of\r\nthe splendour belonging to it in more peaceful days, when it was the\r\n‘Heart’s Delight’ of the sensual monarch; but now it was well guarded by\r\n42d Highlanders, ready to grapple with princelings and sepoys at any\r\nmoment. From the roof of this palace could be seen the chief buildings\r\nof the city, as well as the vast defensive preparations which the enemy\r\nhad made. The sepoys in the Martinière maintained a rifle-fire against\r\nsuch of the British as made their appearance on the flat roof of the Dil\r\nKoosha; but the distance was too great to render the fire dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the 4th were a sequel to those of the 3d—not an actual\r\ncommencement of the siege, but a furtherance of the arrangements\r\nnecessary to render the siege successful. The camp was extended from the\r\nDil Koosha to Bibiapore, a house and enclosure a little further down the\r\nright bank of the river. From the glimpses obtained by the skirmishers\r\nand pickets, and from the information brought in by spies, it was\r\nascertained that many of the inhabitants, terrified at the formidable\r\npreparations for the siege, were fleeing from the city on the opposite\r\nside; and that the ‘authorities’ were endeavouring to check this flight,\r\nwishing the inhabitants to fight for their property and their lives\r\nwithin the city itself. There were intelligible reasons for this on both\r\nsides. The citizens, whether their love for their native royal family\r\nwas great or small, had little inclination to sacrifice their own\r\npersonal interests to that sentiment; while, on the other hand, the\r\nrebel leaders cared not how many townsmen were ruined, so long as the\r\nprivileges and profits of government remained with themselves, rather\r\nthan reverting to the British.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 5th that General Franks joined the commander-in-chief,\r\nwith that corps which now became the fourth division of the army of\r\nOude. He had fought his way half across the province, from the Jounpoor\r\nfrontier, defeating many bodies of rebels on the way, and arriving at\r\nLucknow precisely at the time which had been agreed on. Jung Bahadoor\r\nand his large Nepaulese army did not arrive at the time specified: a\r\nwant of punctuality which disturbed both the plans and the equanimity of\r\nSir Colin. The components of the army of Oude, as laid down by the\r\ncommander-in-chief on the 10th of February, were enumerated in a note at\r\nthe end of the last chapter. At present, on the 5th of March, when\r\nFranks had arrived, the army before Lucknow consisted approximately of\r\nthe following numbers of troops—First division of infantry, under\r\nOutram, about 5000 strong; second, under Lugard, 5400; third, under\r\nWalpole, 4300; fourth, under Franks, 4800; cavalry, under Hope Grant and\r\nother commanders, distributed among the infantry divisions; artillery,\r\nincluding the naval brigade, 1100; and engineers, 1700. The army of Oude\r\nwas often said to consist of 30,000 troops, of whom 18,000 were British\r\nand the rest native; but such an estimate was worth little unless the\r\nexact day be named to which it applied. The army varied both by arrivals\r\nand departures.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the siege-plan connected with the left bank of the river\r\nhad never been lost sight of during the preparatory operations on the\r\nright. While the infantry, cavalry, artillery, and commissariat were\r\nbusily engaged in camping near the Dil Koosha, the engineers were\r\ncollecting the casks, fascines of fagots, ropes, and timbers, necessary\r\nfor forming a bridge, or rather two bridges, across the Goomtee, at some\r\npoint below where the enemy were in greatest force. The spot selected\r\nwas near head-quarters at Bibiapore, where the river was about forty\r\nyards wide. The enemy, uneasy at the proceedings of the engineers,\r\ngradually assembled in considerable numbers on the opposite bank; but as\r\nthe British brought up guns to oppose them, the engineering works\r\nproceeded without much molestation. These bridges exemplified some of\r\nthe contrivances which military commanders are accustomed to adopt, in\r\nthe course of their onerous duties. The groundwork of each was a\r\ncollection of empty beer-casks, lashed by ropes to timber cross-pieces,\r\nand floated off one by one to their positions; a firm roadway of\r\nplanking was afterwards fixed on the top of the whole range from end to\r\nend. Firm indeed must the construction necessarily have been; for\r\ntroopers on their horses, heavy guns and mortars, ammunition-wagons, and\r\ncommissariat carts, all would have to pass over these bridges, secure so\r\nfar as possible from accident to man or beast.\r\n\r\nTo Sir James Outram was intrusted the command of that portion of the\r\narmy which was to cross by these bridges of casks, and operate against\r\nthe city from the left bank of the Goomtee. This gallant officer had\r\nbeen in and near the Alum Bagh for a period of just one hundred days,\r\nfrom November to March, defending himself successfully against numerous\r\nattacks made on him by the enemy, as narrated in former chapters. It was\r\nright that he should now have the most important command under Sir\r\nColin. He took his departure from the Alum Bagh—leaving that important\r\npost, which he had so long and so well defended, to the care of\r\nBrigadier Franklyn and of the 5th and 78th Queen’s regiments of foot.\r\nThe force intrusted to him consisted of Walpole’s division of infantry,\r\ntogether with regiments and detachments from other divisions.[142]\r\nFranks with his division took Walpole’s place near the Dil Koosha. The\r\nplan of attack agreed upon was, that Outram, after crossing the Goomtee,\r\nshould advance up the left bank; while the troops in position at the Dil\r\nKoosha were to remain at rest until it should have become apparent that\r\nthe first line of the enemy’s works, or the rampart running along the\r\ncanal and abutting on the Goomtee, had been turned. Sir James, arriving\r\nat the Dil Koosha from the Alum Bagh, effected his crossing safely on\r\nthe 6th, and pitched his camp for the night on the left bank of the\r\nriver, near the race-course. It was a formidable burden for the bridges\r\nto bear, comprising, besides the infantry and cavalry, thirty guns, and\r\na large train of baggage and ammunition animals; nevertheless the\r\nfloating fabrics bore up well, and fully answered their intended\r\npurpose. English troops of the line, Highlanders, lancers, hussars,\r\ndragoons, artillery, engineers, commissariat, horses, oxen, camels,\r\nelephants—all passed safely over, and speedily fell into orderly array\r\non the other side of the river. This was, of course, not done without a\r\nlittle fighting. The enemy could not be blind to the proceeding, nor to\r\nthe consequences likely to result from it. There was skirmishing in\r\nfront of the Chukkur Walla Kothee, or Yellow House, a circular building\r\non the left bank of the river; and there was much prancing about of\r\nleading personages who hastily came out of the city; but nothing\r\ndisturbed Sir James from securely encamping at night.\r\n\r\nWhile Outram was thus crossing the river on the 6th, Sir Colin remained\r\nsimply on the defensive near the Dil Koosha, deferring all active\r\noperations until the subsidiary force had got into fighting order on the\r\nleft bank. The enemy maintained a continuous fire from the Martinière;\r\nbut the gunnery was not good, and very little mischief was occasioned.\r\nOne of the most striking circumstances connected with the position and\r\nproceedings of the commander-in-chief was that he _carried the electric\r\ntelegraph with him_ from camp to camp, from post to post. Chiefly\r\nthrough the energy of Lieutenant Patrick Stewart, poles were set up and\r\nwires extended wherever Sir Colin went. Calcutta, Allahabad, Cawnpore,\r\nBuntara, and the Alum Bagh, could all communicate instantly; and now a\r\nwire made its appearance through a drawing-room window at the Dil Koosha\r\nitself, being stretched over a row of poles along the line of route\r\nwhich the commander-in-chief and his troops had followed. Nay, the wires\r\neven followed Outram over the river, and made their appearance—for the\r\nfirst time in the history of Oude—on the left bank. No sooner did Sir\r\nColin advance a few miles, than Stewart followed him with poles and\r\nwires, galvanic batteries and signalling apparatus—daring all dangers,\r\nconquering all difficulties, and setting up a talking-machine close to\r\nthe very enemy themselves. It may almost literally be said that,\r\nwherever he lay down his head at night, Sir Colin could touch a handle,\r\nand converse with Lord Canning at Allahabad before he went to sleep. The\r\nvalue of the electric telegraph was quite beyond all estimate during\r\nthese wars and movements: it was worth a large army in itself.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, Sir James Outram, while making his arrangements on the\r\nopposite side of the river, was attacked in great force by the enemy. On\r\nthe preceding day, he had baffled them in all their attempts, with a\r\nloss of only 2 killed and 10 wounded; and he was not now likely to be\r\nseriously affected even by four or five times his number. The enemy\r\noccupied the race-course stand with infantry, and bodies of cavalry\r\ngalloped up to the same spot with the intention of disturbing Outram’s\r\ncamp. He resisted all the attacks, chased them to a distance with his\r\ncavalry, and maintained his advantageous camping-ground.[143] The road\r\nfrom Fyzabad and from the cantonment passed near his camp; and as all\r\nthat region had for many months been entirely in the hands of the\r\nrebels, there was a liability at any moment of some sudden onslaught\r\nbeing made on him. The commander-in-chief had foreseen this, when he\r\nplaced at the disposal of Outram a division strong enough to form a\r\ncompact little army in itself.\r\n\r\nThe result of a careful reconnaissance made on the 8th, by Sir Colin,\r\nresulted in instructions to Outram to arrange his batteries during the\r\nnight, and on the following day to attack the enemy’s position, the key\r\nto which was the Chukkur Walla Kothee. On the morning of the 9th,\r\naccordingly, Sir James made the attack with excellent effect; the enemy\r\nbeing driven out at all points, and the Yellow House seized. He advanced\r\nhis whole force for some distance through ground affording excellent\r\ncover for the enemy. He was by that means enabled to bring his right\r\nflank forward to occupy the Fyzabad road, which he crossed by a bridge\r\nover a nullah, and to plant his batteries for the purpose of enfilading\r\nthe works upon the canal. During this day’s operations, much skirmishing\r\ntook place between his Sikhs and Rifles and the enemy; but the most\r\nobstinate contest was maintained within the Yellow House itself, where a\r\nfew fanatics, shutting themselves up, resisted for several hours all\r\nattempts to dislodge them. They were at length expelled, fighting\r\ndesperately to the last. Outram was then enabled to take the villages of\r\nJeamoor and Jijowly, and to advance to the Padishah Bagh or King’s\r\nGarden, opposite the Fureed Buksh palace, and to commence an enfilade\r\nfire on the lines of the Kaiser Bagh defences.\r\n\r\nWhile Outram was engaged in these successful operations of the 9th on\r\nthe left bank of the Goomtee, a very heavy fire was kept up against the\r\nMartinière, from mortars and guns placed in position on the Dil Koosha\r\nplateau. Sir Colin had purposely deferred this assault until Outram had\r\ncaptured the Yellow House, and commenced that flank attack which so\r\nembarrassed the enemy. The sailors of the naval brigade were joyously\r\nengaged on this day; for the thicker the fight, the better were they\r\npleased. They commanded four great guns on the road near the Dil Koosha;\r\nand with these they battered away, not only against the Martinière, but\r\nalso against a cluster of small houses near that building. Captain Sir\r\nWilliam Peel managed to throw not only shot and shell, but also rockets,\r\ninto enclosures which contained numerous insurgent musketeers—a\r\nvisitation which necessarily prompted a hasty flight. It had well-nigh\r\nbeen a bad day for the British, however; for Peel received a musket-ball\r\nin the thigh while walking about fearlessly among his guns; the ball was\r\nextracted under the influence of chloroform; but the wound nearly proved\r\nfatal through the eagerness of the gallant man to return to the fray. He\r\nwas, however, spared for the present. The enemy resisted this day’s\r\nattack with a good deal of resolution; for they fired shot right over\r\nthe Martinière towards the Dil Koosha, from guns in their bastions on\r\nthe canal line of defence. When the cannonading had proceeded to the\r\ndesired extent, a storming of the Martinière took place, by troops under\r\nthe command of Sir Edward Lugard and other able officers. The\r\ninstructions given by the commander-in-chief for this enterprise were\r\nminute and complete,[144] and were carried out to the letter. The\r\ninfantry marched forward from their camp behind the Dil Koosha, their\r\nbayonets glittering in the sun; and it was remarked that the sight of\r\nthese terrible bayonets appeared to throw the enemy into more\r\ntrepidation than all the guns and howitzers, mortars and rockets. A\r\nbayonet-charge by the British was more than any of the ‘Pandies’ could\r\nbear. Silently and swiftly the Highlanders and Punjaubees marched on,\r\nthe former towards the Martinière, and the latter towards the trenches\r\nthat flanked that building; while the other regiments of Lugard’s column\r\nfollowed closely in the rear. Distracted by Outram’s enfilade fire from\r\nthe other side of the river, and by Lugard’s advance in front, the enemy\r\nmade but a feeble resistance. The 42d Highlanders and the Punjaubee\r\ninfantry climbed up the intrenchment abutting on the river, and rushed\r\nalong the whole line of works, till they got to the neighbourhood of\r\nBanks’s house. Meanwhile, another body of infantry advanced to the\r\nMartinière, and captured the building and the whole of the enclosure\r\nsurrounding it. All this was done with very little bloodshed on either\r\nside; for Lugard’s men, in obedience to orders, did not fire; while the\r\nenemy escaped from the walls and trenches without maintaining a\r\nhand-to-hand contest. This abandonment of the defence-works would not\r\nhave taken place so speedily had not Outram’s flanking fire enfiladed\r\nthe whole line; but the insurgent artillerymen found it impossible to\r\nwithstand the ordeal to which they were now exposed. Sir Colin’s plan\r\nhad been so carefully made, and so admirably carried out, that this\r\ncapture of the enemy’s exterior line of defence was effected almost\r\nwithout loss.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, while Outram was engaged in strengthening the position\r\nwhich he had taken up, he sent Hope Grant with the cavalry of the\r\ndivision to patrol over the whole of the country between the left bank\r\nof the Goomtee and the old cantonment. This was done with the view of\r\npreventing any surprise by the approach of bodies of the rebels in that\r\nquarter. An extensive system of patrolling or reconnaissance had formed\r\nfrom the first a part of Sir Colin’s plan for the tactics of the siege.\r\nOutram on this day brought his heavy guns into a position to rake the\r\nenemy’s lines, to annoy the Kaiser Bagh with a vertical and direct fire,\r\nto attack the suburbs in the vicinity of the iron and stone bridges, and\r\nto command the iron bridge from the left bank; all of which operations\r\nhe carried out with great success. The enemy, however, still held the\r\nright end of the iron bridge so pertinaciously, that it was not until\r\nafter a very heavy cannonading that the conquest was effected.\r\n\r\nOn the city side of the river, on this day, the operations consisted\r\nmainly in securing the conquests effected on the 9th. At a very early\r\nhour in the morning, while yet dusk, the rebel sepoys advanced in great\r\nstrength to reoccupy the defence-line of the canal, apparently not\r\nknowing that the Highlanders and Punjaubees had maintained that position\r\nduring the night; they were speedily undeceived by a volley of musketry\r\nwhich put them to flight. At sunrise a disposition of troops and heavy\r\nguns was made by Lugard for an attack on Banks’s house; and this house,\r\ncaptured about noon, was at once secured as a strong military post.\r\n\r\nThus did this remarkable siege go on day after day. Nothing was hurried,\r\nnothing unforeseen. All the movements were made as if the city and its\r\nenvirons formed a vast chess-board on which the commander-in-chief could\r\nsee the position of all the pieces and pawns. Nay, so fully had he\r\nstudied the matter, that he had some such command over the ground as is\r\nmaintained by a chess-player who conducts and wins a game without seeing\r\nthe board. Every force, every movement, was made conducive to one common\r\nend—the conquest of the city without the loss of much British blood, and\r\nwithout leaving any lurking-place in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe conquest and fortifying of Banks’s house enabled Sir Colin to\r\ncommence the second part of his operations. Having captured the enemy’s\r\nexterior line of defence, he had now to attack the second or middle\r\nline, which (as has been already shewn) began at the river-side near the\r\nMotee Mehal, the Mess-house, and the Emanbarra. The plan he formed was\r\nto use the great block of houses and palaces extending from Banks’s\r\nhouse to the Kaiser Bagh as an approach, instead of sapping up towards\r\nthe second line of works. ‘The operation,’ as he said in his dispatch,\r\n‘had now become one of an engineering character; and the most earnest\r\nendeavours were made to save the infantry from being hazarded before due\r\npreparation had been made.’ The chief engineer, Brigadier Napier, placed\r\nhis batteries in such positions as to shell and breach a large block of\r\nthe palaces known as the Begum Kothee. This bombardment, on the 11th,\r\nwas long and severe; for the front of the palaces was screened by\r\nouthouses, earthworks, and parapets, which required to be well battered\r\nbefore the infantry could make the assault. The 8-inch guns of the naval\r\nbrigade were the chief instruments in this formidable cannonade. At\r\nlength, about four o’clock in the afternoon, Napier announced that the\r\nbreaches were practicable, and Lugard at once made arrangements for\r\nstorming the Begum Kothee. He had with him the 93d Highlanders, the 4th\r\nPunjaub Rifles, and 1000 Goorkhas, and was aided in the assault by\r\nAdrian Hope. His troops speedily secured the whole block of buildings,\r\nand inflicted a very heavy loss on the enemy. The attack was one of a\r\ndesperate character, and was characterised by Sir Colin as ‘the sternest\r\nstruggle which occurred during the siege.’ From that point Napier pushed\r\nhis engineering approaches with great judgment through the enclosures,\r\nby the aid of the sappers and the heavy guns; the troops immediately\r\noccupying the ground as he advanced, and the mortars being moved from\r\none position to another as the ground was won on which they could be\r\nplaced. Outram was not idle during these operations. He obtained\r\npossession of the iron bridge, leading over the river from the\r\ncantonment to the city, and swept away the enemy from every part of the\r\nleft bank of the river between that bridge and the Padishah Bagh; thus\r\nleaving him in a position to enfilade the central and inner lines of\r\ndefence established by the enemy among the palaces.\r\n\r\nIt was while these serious and important operations were in progress, on\r\nthe 11th of March, that the commander-in-chief was called upon to attend\r\nto a ceremonial affair, from which he would doubtless have willingly\r\nbeen spared. The preceding chapters have shewn how Jung Bahadoor,\r\ndescending from the Nepaulese mountains with an army of 9000 Goorkhas,\r\nrendered a little service in the Goruckpore and Jounpoor districts, and\r\nthen advanced into Oude to assist in the operations against Lucknow. His\r\nmovements had been dilatory; and Sir Colin was forced to arrange all the\r\ndetails of the siege as if no reliance could be placed in this ally. At\r\nlength, however, on the afternoon of the 11th, Jung Bahadoor appeared at\r\nthe Dil Koosha; he and Sir Colin met for the first time. The meeting was\r\na curious one. The Nepaul chieftain, thoroughly Asiatic in everything,\r\nprepared for the interview as one on which he might lavish all his\r\nsplendour of gold, satin, pearls, and diamonds; the old Highland\r\nofficer, on the other hand, plain beyond the usual plainness of a\r\nsoldier in all that concerned personal indulgences,[145] was somewhat\r\ntried even by the necessity for his full regimentals and decorative\r\nappendages. A continuous battle was going on, in which he thought of his\r\nsoldiers’ lives, and of the tactics necessary to insure a victory; at\r\nsuch a time, and in such a climate, he would gladly have dispensed with\r\nthe scarlet and the feathers of his rank, and of the oriental\r\ncompliments in which truth takes little part. A tasteful canopy was\r\nprepared in front of Sir Colin’s mess-tent; and here were assembled the\r\ncommander-in-chief, Archdale Wilson, Hope Grant, a glittering group of\r\nstaff-officers and aids-de-camp, a Highland guard of honour, an escort\r\nof Lancers, bands, pipers, drums, flags, and all the paraphernalia for a\r\nmilitary show. Sir Colin was punctual; Jung Bahadoor was not. Sir Colin,\r\nhis thoughts all the while directed towards Lugard’s operations at the\r\nBegum Kothee, felt the approaching ceremony, and the delay in beginning\r\nit, as a sore interruption. At length the Nepaulese chieftain appeared.\r\nJung Bahadoor had, as Nepaulese ambassador, made himself famous in\r\nLondon a few years before, by his gorgeous dress and lavish expenditure;\r\nand he now appeared in fully as great splendour. The presentations, the\r\ngreetings, the compliments, the speeches, were all of the wonted kind;\r\nbut when Captain Hope Johnstone, as one of the officers of the chief of\r\nthe staff, entered to announce that ‘the Begum Kothee is taken,’ Sir\r\nColin broke through all ceremony, expressed a soldier’s pleasure at the\r\nnews, and brought the interview to a termination. Jung Bahadoor returned\r\nto his own camp; and the commander-in-chief instantly resumed his\r\nordinary military duties. Sir Colin was evidently somewhat puzzled to\r\nknow how best to employ his gorgeous colleague; although his courtesy\r\nwould not allow him to shew it. The Goorkhas moved close to the canal on\r\nthe 13th; and on the following day Sir Colin requested Jung Bahadoor to\r\ncross the canal, and attack the suburbs to the left of Banks’s house. As\r\nhe was obliged, just at that critical time, to mass all the available\r\nstrength of his British troops in the double attack along the banks of\r\nthe Goomtee, the commander-in-chief had few to spare for his left wing;\r\nand he speaks of the troops of the Nepaulese leader as being ‘most\r\nadvantageously employed for several days,’ in thus covering his left.\r\n\r\nWe return to the siege operations. So great had been the progress made\r\non the 11th, that the development of the commander-in-chief’s strategy\r\nbecame every hour more and more clear. Outram’s heavy fire with guns and\r\nmortars produced great effect on the Kaiser Bagh; while the Begum Kothee\r\nbecame a post from which an attack could be made on the Emanbarra, a\r\nlarge building situated between the Begum Kothee and the Kaiser\r\nBagh.[146] The Begum Kothee palace, when visited by the officers of the\r\nstaff on the morning of the 12th, astonished them by the strength which\r\nthe enemy had given to it. The walls were so loopholed for musketry, the\r\nbastions and cannon were so numerous, the ditch around it was so deep,\r\nand the earthen rampart so high, that all marvelled how it came to be so\r\neasily captured on the preceding day. The enemy might have held it\r\nagainst double of Lugard’s force, had they not been paralysed by the\r\nbayonet. It was a strange sight, on the following morning, to see\r\nHighlanders and Punjaubees roaming about gorgeous saloons and zenanas,\r\nstill containing many articles of dress and personal ornaments which the\r\nladies of the palace had not had time to carry away with them. Whither\r\nthe inmates had fled, the conquerors at that time did not know, and in\r\nall probability did not care. It was a strange and unnatural sight;\r\nsplendour and blood appeared to have struggled for mastery in the\r\nvarious courts and rooms of the palace, many contests having taken place\r\nwith small numbers of the enemy.[147] From this building, we have said,\r\nSir Colin determined that progress should be made towards the Emanbarra,\r\nnot by open assault, but by sapping through a mass of intermediate\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Gateway of the Emanbarra at Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe 12th was the day when the sapping commenced; but so many and so\r\nintricate were the buildings, that three days were occupied in this\r\nseries of operations; seeing that it was necessary to destroy or at\r\nleast to render innoxious such houses as might have concealed large\r\nbodies of the enemy. Lugard’s troops having been hotly engaged on the\r\n11th, they were now relieved by others under Franks. The work was of\r\nformidable character; for the flat roofs of many of the houses were\r\ncovered with two or three feet of earth, baked in the sun, and loopholed\r\nfor musketry. Every such house had to be well scrutinised, before a\r\nfurther advance was made. The sappers made passages, either actually\r\nunderground, or through the lower portions of the walls and enclosures\r\nsurrounding the buildings. On the 13th these approaches were so far\r\ncompleted that a large number of guns and mortars could be brought\r\nforward, and placed in position for bombarding the Emanbarra. On this\r\nday, too, Jung Bahadoor’s troops took possession of a mass of suburban\r\nhouses southward of the city, between Sir Colin’s camp and the Alum\r\nBagh; after which the commander-in-chief paid a return visit to the\r\nNepaulese chieftain, who strove to display still more magnificence than\r\nat the former interview.\r\n\r\nThe 14th of March was one of the busy days of the siege. The sap was\r\ncarried on so successfully that the Emanbarra could be bombarded by\r\nheavy guns and mortars, and then taken. Directly this was done,\r\nBrasyer’s Sikhs, pressing forward in pursuit of the fleeing enemy,\r\nentered the Kaiser Bagh—the third or inner line of defence having been\r\nturned without a single gun being fired from it. Supports were quickly\r\nthrown in, and the British troops found themselves speedily in a part of\r\nthe city already well known to Campbell and Outram during their\r\noperations of November—surrounded by the Mess-house, the Taree Kothee,\r\nthe Motee Mehal, and the Chuttur Munzil. All these buildings were near\r\nthem, and all were occupied by them before night closed in. As fast as\r\nthe infantry seized these several positions, so did the engineers\r\nproceed to secure the outposts towards the south and west. As in many\r\nother cases when it was the lot of the English in India to fight their\r\ngreatest battles, or bear their greatest sufferings, on Sundays; so was\r\nit on a Sunday that these busy operations of the 14th took place. The\r\nfront walls of the Kaiser Bagh and the Motee Mehal were extensively\r\nmined; insomuch that when the artillery had effected its dread work, the\r\ninfantry could approach much more safely than if exposed to the sight of\r\nsharpshooters and matchlockmen. It is true that neither English nor\r\nHighlanders, neither Sikhs nor Goorkhas, would have hesitated to rush\r\nforward and storm these buildings without a sap; but as Sir Colin was\r\nwell supplied with heavy guns, he acted steadily on the plan of\r\nemploying them as much as possible before sending on his men—feeling\r\nthat the loss of men would be more difficult to replace than that of\r\nguns and missiles, at such a time and in such a country. In his dispatch\r\nrelating to the operations of the 14th of March, he said: ‘The day was\r\none of continued exertion; and every one felt that, although much\r\nremained to be done before the final expulsion of the rebels, the most\r\ndifficult part of the undertaking had been overcome. This is not the\r\nplace for a description of the various buildings sapped into or stormed.\r\nSuffice it to say that they formed a range of massive palaces and walled\r\ncourts of vast extent, equalled perhaps, but not surpassed, in any\r\ncapital of Europe. Every outlet had been covered by a work, and on every\r\nside were prepared barricades and loopholed parapets. The extraordinary\r\nindustry evinced by the enemy in this respect has been really\r\nunexampled. Hence the absolute necessity for holding the troops in hand,\r\ntill at each successive move forward the engineers reported to me that\r\nall which could be effected by artillery and the sappers had been done,\r\nbefore the troops were led to the assault.’\r\n\r\nA little must here be said concerning the share which Sir James Outram\r\nhad in the operations of the 12th and two following days. All his\r\ntactics, on the left bank of the river, were especially intended to\r\nsupport those of the commander-in-chief on the right bank. On the 12th\r\nhis heavy guns, at and near the Padishah Bagh, poured forth a torrent of\r\nshot, to dislodge the enemy from certain positions near the city. His\r\nhead-quarters were established under a small tope of trees near a ruined\r\nmosque; and he, as well as Lugard and Walpole, lived as simply as\r\npossible under tents. The Padishah Bagh itself—a suburban palace with\r\nbeautiful saloons, halls, terraces, orange-groves and fountains—was held\r\nby H.M. 23d. The left bank of the river being occupied as far up as the\r\niron suspension bridge, Outram planted two or three guns to guard that\r\nposition from any hostile attack from the north; while two or three\r\nregiments of his own infantry, in convenient spots near the bridge, kept\r\nup a musketry-fire against such of the enemy as were visible and within\r\nreach on the opposite or city side of the river. This musketry-fire was\r\ncontinued all day on the 13th, while the batteries of heavy guns were\r\nbeing brought further and further into position. On the 14th, the same\r\noperations were continued; but the conquest of the Kaiser Bagh was so\r\nsudden and unexpected on this day, that the proceedings on the left bank\r\nof the river were relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning of the 15th arrived, Sir Colin Campbell felt that he\r\nmight call Lucknow his own; for although much remained to be done, the\r\nconquests achieved were vast and important. The Mahomed Bagh, the Dil\r\nKoosha, the Martinière, the Secunder Bagh, the Emanbarra, the\r\nMess-house, the Shah Munzil, the Motee Mehal, the Begum Kothee, and the\r\nKaiser Bagh, were all in his hands—constituting by far the strongest and\r\nmost important of the palatial buildings along the banks of the river.\r\nMoreover, the natives were evidently dismayed; vast numbers were leaving\r\nthe city on the Rohilcund side; and spies brought information that the\r\nrebel leaders encountered much difficulty in keeping the sepoys steadily\r\nat the defence-works. The progress made by the British had surprised and\r\nalarmed the insurgents, and tended to paralyse their exertions. Some of\r\nthe British officers had entertained a belief that the Kaiser Bagh was\r\nthe key to the enemy’s position, whereas others had looked rather to the\r\nBegum Kothee. The latter proved to be right. The enemy had greatly\r\nrelied on the last-named building; insomuch that, when it was captured,\r\nthey rushed in wild confusion to the Kaiser Bagh, intent rather upon\r\nflight than upon a stubborn resistance. The garrison of the Kaiser Bagh,\r\ndisconcerted by this irruption of their brother insurgents, were\r\nrendered almost unable, even if willing, to make a manful resistance.\r\nThe British were almost as much surprised by the speedy capture of the\r\nKaiser Bagh, as the enemy were by the loss of the Begum Kothee. When the\r\ngreat palace changed hands, the smoke and blood and cries of war were\r\nstrangely mingled with the magnificence of kiosks, mosques, corridors,\r\ncourts, gardens, terraces, saloons, mirrors, gilding, chandeliers,\r\ntapestry, statues, pictures, and costly furniture, in this strange\r\njumble of oriental and European splendour.\r\n\r\nA soldier loses all his heroism when the hour for prize and plunder\r\narrives. Those, whether officers or spectators, who have described the\r\nscene which was presented when these Lucknow palaces were conquered,\r\ntell plainly of a period of wild licence and absorbing greed. On the one\r\nhand there were palaces containing vast stores of oriental and European\r\nluxuries; on the other, there were bands of armed men, brave and\r\nfaithful, but at the same time poor and unlettered, who suddenly found\r\nthemselves masters of all these splendours, with very little check or\r\nsupervision on the part of their officers. At first, in a spirit of\r\ntriumphant revenge, costly articles were broken which were too large to\r\nbe carried away; glass chandeliers were hurled to the ground, mirrors\r\nshattered into countless fragments, statues mutilated and overturned,\r\npictures stabbed and torn, doors of costly wood torn from their hinges.\r\nBut when this destruction had been wreaked, and when the troops had\r\nforced their way through courts and corridors strewn with sepoys’ brass\r\nlotas or drinking-vessels, charpoys, clothing, belts, ammunition,\r\nmuskets, matchlocks, swords, pistols, chupatties, and other evidences of\r\nprecipitate flight—when this had all occurred, then did the love of\r\nplunder seize hold of the men. The Kaiser Bagh had been so quickly\r\nconquered, that the subaltern officers had not yet received instructions\r\nhow to control the movements of the troops in this matter. Sikhs,\r\nHighlanders, English, were soon busily engaged. In one splendid saloon\r\nmight be seen a party of Sikhs melting down gold and silver lace for the\r\nsake of the precious metals; in another, a quantity of shawls, lace,\r\npearls, and embroidery of gold and silver, was being divided equally\r\namong a group of soldiers. In a sort of treasure-room, apparently\r\nbelonging to some high personage, a few men of two British regiments\r\nfound caskets and boxes containing diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls,\r\nopals, and other gems, made into necklaces, bracelets, earrings,\r\ngirdles, &c.; together with gold-mounted pistols, jewel-hilted swords,\r\nsaddle-cloths covered with gold and pearls, gold-handled riding-canes,\r\njewelled cups of agate and jade, japanned boxes filled with crystal and\r\njade vessels. And, as it appeared that every one felt himself permitted\r\nor at least enabled to retain whatever he could capture, the\r\ncamp-followers rushed in and seized all that the soldiers had left.\r\nCoolies, syces, khitmutgars, dooly-bearers, and grass-cutters, were seen\r\nrunning hither and thither, laden with costly clothing, swords,\r\nfirelocks, brass pots, and other articles larger in bulk than the actual\r\nsoldiers could readily have disposed of. It was a saturnalia, during\r\nwhich it is believed that some of the troops appropriated enough\r\ntreasure, if converted into its value in money, to render them\r\nindependent of labour for the rest of their lives. But each man kept, in\r\nwhole or in part, his own secret.\r\n\r\nLet us on from this extraordinary scene. The 15th was chiefly employed\r\nin securing what had been captured, removing powder, destroying mines,\r\nand fixing mortars for the further bombardment of the positions still\r\nheld by the enemy, on the right bank of the Goomtee, and in the heart of\r\nthe city. As the infantry and artillery could fulfil this duty, without\r\nthe aid of horse, two bodies of cavalry, under Walpole and Hope Grant,\r\nwere sent out to prevent, if possible, the escape of the enemy on the\r\nsides of the city not subject to immediate attack. One of these generals\r\nproceeded towards the Sundeela road, and the other to that leading to\r\nSeetapoor. Whether this flight of the enemy disappointed or not the\r\nexpectations of the commander-in-chief, was a question which he kept to\r\nhimself. The city, for all practical military purposes, was twenty miles\r\nin circumference; and he could not have guarded all the outlets without\r\na very much larger army than that which was at his disposal. Like as at\r\nSebastopol, the siege was not aided by a complete investiture of the\r\nplace besieged. It is possible that the capture of the Kaiser Bagh, and\r\nthe consequent flight of the enemy, occurred too early for Sir Colin to\r\nbe enabled to put in operation certain manœuvres on the other side of\r\nthe city. Be this as it may, large numbers of rebel sepoys, and a still\r\nlarger of the regular inhabitants of the city escaped during the 14th\r\nand 15th, mostly over the stone bridge—as if hopeful of safety in\r\nRohilcund and Upper Oude.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th Sir James Outram, after ten days of active operation on the\r\nleft bank of the Goomtee, crossed over by a bridge of casks opposite the\r\nSecunder Bagh; and he then advanced through the Chuttur Munzil towards\r\nthe Residency. To lessen the chance of the enemy’s retreat as much as\r\npossible, he marched right through the city, not only to the iron bridge\r\nnear the Residency, but to the stone bridge near the Muchee Bhowan. All\r\nthis was an enterprise of remarkable boldness, for the buildings to be\r\nsuccessively conquered and entered were very numerous. Outram shifted\r\nhis own head-quarters to Banks’s house, on the city side of the river;\r\nand it was here that he received a letter from the Begum, or mother of\r\nthe young boy-king, containing some sort of proposition for compromise\r\nor cessation of hostilities. Whatever it may have been, no successful\r\nresult attended this missive: the progress and conquest went on as\r\nbefore. His troops, as they advanced to the Chuttur Munzil, the Pyne\r\nBagh, the Fureed Buksh, and the Taree Kothee, found all these buildings\r\nabandoned by the enemy—who had been too much dismayed by the operations\r\nof the 16th to make a bold stand. At length he approached the Residency,\r\nthe enclosed spot whose name will ever be imperishably associated with\r\nInglis’s defence of the British garrison, and in which Outram himself\r\nhad passed many anxious weeks between September and November. Hardly a\r\nbuilding remained standing within the enclosure; all had been riddled\r\nand shattered during the long period from July to November, and most of\r\nthem subsequently destroyed by the enemy. Up to this time Outram’s march\r\nof the 16th through the city had been almost unopposed; but he now\r\nascertained that the houses and palaces between the iron and stone\r\nbridges were occupied by the enemy in considerable force. Hard fighting\r\nat once commenced here, in which the 20th, 23d, and 79th regiments were\r\nactively engaged. They advanced at a rapid pace from the Residency\r\ntowards the iron bridge. A 9-pounder, planted to command a road by the\r\nway, fired grape into them; but it was speedily captured. By that time\r\nthe large guns were brought into position, to play upon the stone\r\nbridge, the Emanbarra of Azof-u-Dowlah, and other structures northwest\r\nof the iron bridge. At that time Grant and his troopers were near the\r\nstone bridge on the left side of the river, while Outram’s guns were\r\nfiring on it from the right bank; as a consequence, no more escape was\r\npermitted by that channel; and the fugitives therefore ran along the\r\nright bank of the river, to a part of the open country northwest of\r\nLucknow, not yet controlled by the English. Many of the rebel sepoys\r\nresolved to make a stand at the Moosa Bagh, a building at the extreme\r\nlimits of the city in this direction; but the day was too far advanced\r\nto attack them at that spot; and the troops were glad to rest for the\r\nnight in the splendid saloons and courts of the Emanbarra—one of the\r\ngrandest among the many grand structures in Lucknow.\r\n\r\nWhile Outram was engaged in these operations on the 16th, obtaining a\r\nmastery along almost the whole right bank of the river, the enemy very\r\nunexpectedly made an attack on the Alum Bagh, which was only held by a\r\nsmall English force under Brigadier Franklyn. Sir Colin Campbell\r\nimmediately requested Jung Bahadoor to advance to his left up the canal,\r\nand take in reverse the post from which the enemy was making the attack.\r\nThe Nepaulese chieftain performed this service successfully, capturing\r\nthe post and the guns, and expelling the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning of the 17th arrived, the commander-in-chief found\r\nhimself so undoubtedly the master of Lucknow, that he was enabled to\r\ndispense with the services of some of his gallant artillery officers,\r\nwhose aid was much wanted at Futteghur and elsewhere. Still, though the\r\ngreat conquest was mainly effected, the minor details had yet to be\r\nfilled up. There were isolated buildings in which small knots of the\r\nenemy had fortified themselves; these it would be necessary to capture.\r\nIt was also very desirable to check the camp-followers in their manifest\r\ntendency for plundering the shops and private houses of the city. Sir\r\nColin did not wish the townsmen to regard him as an enemy; he encouraged\r\nthem, so far as they had not been in complicity with the rebels, to\r\nreturn to their homes and occupations; and it was very essential that\r\nthose homes should, in the meantime, be spared from reckless _looting_.\r\nIn some of the streets, pickets of soldiers were placed, to compel the\r\ncamp-followers to disgorge the plunder which they had appropriated; and\r\nthus was collected a strange medley of trinkets and utensils, which the\r\ntemporary holders gave up with sore unwillingness. Here and there, where\r\na soldier had a little leisure and opportunity, he would hold a kind of\r\nmock-auction, at which not only camp-followers but officers would buy\r\ntreasures for a mere trifle; but these instances were few, for there was\r\nnot much ready cash among the conquerors. Sir Colin found it necessary\r\nto issue an order concerning the plundering system.[148] Outram and Jung\r\nBahadoor took part in a series of operations, on the 17th, intended to\r\nobtain control over the northwest section of the city. The one set forth\r\nfrom the river, the other from the vicinity of the Alum Bagh; and during\r\nthe day they cleared out many nests of rebels. There was also an action\r\non the margin of the city, in which the enemy managed to bring together\r\na considerable force of horse, foot, and artillery; their guns were\r\ncaptured, however, and themselves put to flight.\r\n\r\nSir Colin, responsible for many places besides Lucknow, and for many\r\ntroops besides those under his immediate command, now made daily changes\r\nin the duties of his officers. Major (now Lieutenant-colonel) Vincent\r\nEyre and Major (now also Lieutenant-colonel) Turner, two of the most\r\ndistinguished artillery officers, departed for Futteghur and Idrapore;\r\nand Franklyn went to Cawnpore. Inglis succeeded Franklyn at the Alum\r\nBagh. Sir Archdale Wilson and Brigadier Russell took their departure on\r\nsick-leave.\r\n\r\nA considerable force of the enemy still lingered around the Alum Bagh,\r\nirresolute as to any actual attacks, but loath to quit the neighbourhood\r\nuntil the last ray of hope was extinguished. With these rebels Jung\r\nBahadoor had many smart contests. He had been instructed by Sir Colin to\r\nobtain secure possession of the suburbs of the city near the Char\r\nBagh—the bridge that carried the Cawnpore road over the canal.\r\n\r\nIt was on this day, the 17th, and partly in consequence of the success\r\nattending the operations of the Goorkhas, that two English ladies, Mrs\r\nOrr and Miss Jackson, were delivered from the hands of enemies who had\r\nlong held them in bondage. It will be remembered that on the night of\r\nthe 22d of November,[149] the insurgents in Lucknow, enraged at the safe\r\nevacuation of the Residency by the British, put to death certain English\r\nprisoners who had long been in confinement in the Kaiser Bagh. Among\r\nthem were Mr Orr and Sir Mountstuart Jackson. So far as any authentic\r\nnews could be obtained, it appeared that Mrs Orr and Miss Jackson had\r\nbeen spared; partly, as some said, through the intervention of the\r\nBegum. During the subsequent period of nearly four months, the fate of\r\nthose unhappy ladies remained unknown to their English friends. On the\r\nday in question, however (the 17th of March), Captain M’Neil and\r\nLieutenant Bogle, both attached to the Goorkha force, while exploring\r\nsome of the deserted streets in the suburb, were accosted by a native\r\nwho asked their protection for his house and property. The man sought to\r\npurchase this protection by a revelation concerning certain English\r\nladies, who, he declared, were in confinement in a place known to him.\r\nAlmost immediately another native brought a note from Mrs Orr and Miss\r\nJackson, begging earnestly for succour. M’Neil and Bogle instantly\r\nobtained a guard of fifty Goorkhas, and, guided by the natives, went on\r\ntheir errand of mercy. After walking through half a mile of narrow\r\nstreets, doubtful of an ambush at every turning, they came to a house\r\noccupied by one Meer Wajeed Ali, who held, or had held, some office\r\nunder the court. After a little parleying, M’Neil and Bogle were led to\r\nan obscure apartment, where were seated two ladies in oriental costume.\r\nThese were the prisoners, who had so long been excluded from every one\r\nof their own country, and who were overwhelmed with tearful joy at this\r\nhappy deliverance. It was not clearly known whether this Meer Wajeed Ali\r\nwas endeavouring to buy off safety for himself by betraying a trust\r\nimposed in him; but the two English officers deemed it best to lose no\r\ntime in securing their countrywomen’s safety, whether he were a\r\ndouble-dealer or not; they procured a palanquin, put the ladies into it,\r\nand marched off with their living treasure—proud enough with their\r\nafternoon’s work. When these poor ladies came to tell their sad tale of\r\nwoe, with countenances on which marks of deep suffering were expressed,\r\nit became known that, though not exposed to any actual barbarities or\r\natrocities, like so many of their countrywomen in other parts of India,\r\ntheir lives had been made very miserable by the unfeeling conduct of\r\ntheir jailers, who were permitted to use gross and insulting language in\r\ntheir presence, and to harrow them with recitals of what Europeans were\r\nand had been suffering. They had had food in moderate sufficiency, but\r\nof other sources of solace they were almost wholly bereft. It was fully\r\nbelieved that they would not have been restored alive, had the jailer\r\nobeyed the orders issued to him by the Moulvie.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of comparative repose on the 18th, a combined movement\r\nagainst the Moosa Bagh was organised on the 19th. This was the last\r\nposition held by the enemy on the line of the Goomtee, somewhat beyond\r\nthe extreme northwest limit of the city. Outram moved forward directly\r\nagainst the place; Hope Grant cannonaded it from the left bank; while\r\nWilliam Campbell, approaching on the remote side from the Alum Bagh,\r\nprevented retreat in that direction. Some said the Begum was there, some\r\nthe Moulvie or fanatic chieftain; but on this point nothing was known.\r\nAll that was certain was that several thousand insurgents, driven from\r\nother places, had congregated within the buildings and courts of the\r\nMoosa Bagh. Outram’s troops started from the Emanbarra on this\r\nexpedition early in the morning; he himself joined them from Banks’s\r\nhouse, while Sir Colin rode over to see in person how the work was\r\neffected. Opposite the Moosa Bagh, which was a large structure\r\nsurrounded by an enclosed court, was the residence of Ali Nuckee Khan,\r\nvizier or prime-minister to the deposed King of Oude; and in other parts\r\nof the vicinity were numerous mansions and mosques. If the rebels had\r\nheld well together, they might have made a stout resistance here, for\r\nthe buildings contained many elements of strength; but discord reigned;\r\nthe Begum reproached the thalookdars, the thalookdars the sepoys; while\r\nthe Moulvie was suspected of an intention to set up as King of Oude on\r\nhis own account. Outram’s column was to make the direct attack; Hope\r\nGrant’s cavalry and horse-artillery were to command certain roads of\r\napproach and exit on the river-side; while William Campbell’s cavalry,\r\naided by two or three infantry regiments, were to command the opposite\r\nside. The contest can hardly be called a battle or a siege; for as soon\r\nas the rebels clearly ascertained that the British were approaching,\r\nthey abandoned court after court, house after house, and escaped towards\r\nthe northwest, by the only avenue available. Although they did not\r\nfight, they escaped more successfully than Sir Colin had wished or\r\nintended. Whether the three movements were not timed in unison, or\r\nwhether collateral objects engaged the attention of Brigadier Campbell,\r\ncertain it is that few of the enemy were killed, and that many thousands\r\nsafely marched or ran out. The open country, covered with enclosures and\r\ncornfields, enabled the sepoys better to escape than the British to\r\npursue them. A regiment of Sikhs was sent to occupy the Moosa Bagh; and\r\nnow was Lucknow still more fully than before in the hands of the\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, further measures were taken, by proclamation and otherwise,\r\nto induce the peaceful portion of the inhabitants to return to their\r\nhomes. This was desirable in every sense. Until the ordinary relations\r\nof society were re-introduced, anything like civil government was simply\r\nimpossible; while, so long as the houses, deserted by their proper\r\ninhabitants, served as hiding-places for fanatics and budmashes, the\r\nstreets were never for an instant safe. Many officers and soldiers were\r\nshot by concealed antagonists, long after the great buildings of the\r\ncity had been conquered. Moreover, the Sikhs and Goorkhas were becoming\r\nvery unruly. The plunder had acted upon them as an intoxicating\r\nindulgence, shaking the steady obedience which they were wont to exhibit\r\nwhen actively engaged against the enemy. Even at a time when Sir Colin\r\nwas planning which of his generals he could spare, for service elsewhere\r\nor for sick-leave, and which regiments should form new columns for\r\nactive service in other districts—even at such a time it was discovered\r\nthat bodies of the enemy were lurking in houses near Outram’s\r\nhead-quarters, bent upon mischief or revenge; and there was much\r\nmusketry-fire necessary before they could be dislodged. The\r\n‘sick-leave,’ just adverted to, was becoming largely applied for. Many\r\nofficers, so gallant and untiring as to be untouched by any suspicion of\r\ntheir willingness to shirk danger and hard work, gave in; they had\r\nbecome weakened in body and mind by laborious duties, and needed repose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAJOR HODSON, Commandant of Hodson’s Horse.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Moulvie, who had held great power within Lucknow, and whose\r\ninfluence was even now not extinguished, commanded a stronghold in the\r\nvery heart of the city. Sir Edward Lugard was requested to dislodge him\r\non the 21st. This he did after a sharp contest; and Brigadier W.\r\nCampbell, with his cavalry, placed himself in such a position, that he\r\nwas enabled to attack the enemy who were put to flight by Lugard, and to\r\ninflict heavy loss on them during a pursuit of six miles. The conquest\r\nof the Moulvie’s stronghold had this useful effect among others; that it\r\nenabled Sir Colin to expedite the arrangements for the return of such of\r\nthe inhabitants as were not too deeply steeped in rebellion to render\r\nreturn expedient. Among those who fell on this occasion, on the side of\r\nthe enemy, was Shirreff-u-Dowlah, the chief-minister of the rebel\r\nboy-king, or rather of his mother the Begum; this man had been in\r\ncollision with the Moulvie, each envious of the other’s authority; and\r\nthere were those who thought it was by a treacherous blow that he now\r\nfell. Even in this, the last contest within the city, the sappers had to\r\nbe employed; for the Moulvie had so intrenched himself, with many\r\nhundred followers, that he could not be dislodged by the force at first\r\nsent against him; the engineers were forced to sap under and through\r\nsome surrounding buildings, before the infantry could obtain command of\r\nthat in which the Moulvie was lodged.\r\n\r\nThis was the last day of those complicated scenes of tactics and\r\nfighting which formed collectively the siege of Lucknow, and which had\r\nlasted from the 2d to the 21st of March. Concerning the cavalry\r\nexpeditions, during the third week of this period, it is pretty evident\r\nthat they had been fruitless in great results. Sir Hope Grant had cut up\r\na few hundred fugitive rebels in one spot, and intercepted more in\r\nanother; Brigadier William Campbell had rendered useful service both in\r\nand beyond the suburbs of the city; but the proofs were not to be\r\ndoubted that the mutinied sepoys and rebel volunteers had safely escaped\r\nfrom the city, not merely by thousands, but by tens of thousands; and\r\nthat they still retained a sufficiency of military organisation to\r\nrender them annoying and even formidable. When this news reached\r\nEngland, it damped considerably the pleasure afforded by the conquest of\r\nLucknow. The nation asked, but asked without the probability of\r\nreceiving a reply, whether the enemy had in this particular foiled a\r\npart of the commander-in-chief’s plan; and whether the governor-general\r\nshared the opinions of the commander concerning the plan of strategy,\r\nand the consequences resulting from it?\r\n\r\nThe losses suffered by the British army during the operations at\r\nLucknow, though necessarily considerable, were small in comparison\r\nwith those which would have been borne if artillery had not been so\r\nlargely used. Sir Colin from the first determined that shells and\r\nballs should do as much of the dread work as possible, clearing away\r\nor breaching the enemy’s defence-works before he sent in his infantry\r\nto close quarters. During the entire series of operations, from the 2d\r\nto the 21st of March, he had 19 officers killed and 48 wounded. The\r\nwhole of the generals and brigadiers escaped untouched; and there were\r\nonly two officers among the wounded so high in military rank as\r\nlieutenant-colonel. The killed and wounded among the troops generally\r\nwere about 1100. The enemy’s loss could hardly have been less than\r\n4000. One of the deaths most regretted during these operations was\r\nthat of Major Hodson; who, as the commander of ‘Hodson’s Horse,’ and\r\nas the captor of the King of Delhi, had been prominently engaged in\r\nthe Indian wars. It was on the day marked by the conquest of the Begum\r\nKothee that he fell. Having no especial duty on that day, and hearing\r\nthat Brigadier Napier was busily engaged in engineering operations\r\nconnected with the attack on that palace, he rode over to him, and\r\njoined in that storming attack which Sir Colin characterised as ‘the\r\nsternest struggle which occurred during the siege.’ Hodson, while\r\nassisting in clearing the court-yards and buildings near the palace of\r\nparties of the enemy lurking there, was shot by a sepoy. His orderly,\r\na large powerful Sikh, carried him in his arms to a spot beyond the\r\nreach of shot, whence he was carried in a dooly to Banks’s house,\r\nwhere surgical aid could be obtained. Some of his own irregular\r\ntroopers cried over him like children. The shot had passed through the\r\nliver, and he died after a night of great agony. A spot was chosen for\r\nhis grave near a tope of bamboos behind the Martinière. Sir Colin and\r\nhis staff attended the funeral, at which the old chief was much\r\naffected; he had highly valued Hodson, and did not allow many hours to\r\nelapse before he wrote a graceful and feeling letter to the widow of\r\nthe deceased officer. As soon as possible a telegraphic message was\r\nsent to bring down Captain Daly, the commandant of the famous corps of\r\nGuides; he was every way fitted to command a similar body of irregular\r\ncavalry, ‘Hodson’s Horse.’\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the city of Lucknow clearly and unequivocally in the hands\r\nof Sir Colin Campbell, than he completely broke up the lately formidable\r\n‘army of Oude.’ The troops had nothing more immediately to do at that\r\nspot; while their services were urgently needed elsewhere. With regret\r\ndid the soldiers leave a place where such extraordinary gains had fallen\r\nto the lot of some among their number; or, more correctly, this regret\r\nendured only until the very stringent regulations put an effectual stop\r\nto all plundering. The regiments were reorganised into brigades and\r\ndivisions; new brigadiers were appointed in lieu of those on\r\n‘sick-leave;’ and a dispersion of the army commenced.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read Sir Colin Campbell’s mention of Jung Bahadoor\r\nwithout feeling that he estimated at a small price the value of the\r\nservices yielded by the Nepaulese leader. Whether it was that the\r\narrival of the Goorkha army was delayed beyond the date when the\r\ngreatest services might have been rendered, or that Sir Colin found it\r\nembarrassing to issue orders to one who was little less than a king, it\r\nis plain that not much was effected by Jung Bahadoor during the\r\noperations at Lucknow. He came when the siege was half over; he departed\r\na fortnight afterwards; and although the commander-in-chief said in a\r\ncourteous dispatch: ‘I found the utmost willingness on his part to\r\naccede to any desire of mine during the progress of the siege; and from\r\nthe first his Highness was pleased to justify his words that he was\r\nhappy to be serving under my command’—although these were the words\r\nused, there was an absence of any reference to special deeds of\r\nconquest. It was a pretty general opinion among the officers that the\r\nnine thousand soldiers of the Nepaulese army were far inferior in\r\nmilitary qualities to those Goorkhas who had for many years formed two\r\nor three regiments in the Bengal army. When the looting in the city\r\nbegan, Jung Bahadoor’s Goorkhas could scarcely be held in any control;\r\nlike the Sikhs, they were wild with oriental excitement, and Sir Colin\r\nwas more anxious concerning them than his own European troops. Viscount\r\nCanning, who was in intimate correspondence with the commander-in-chief\r\nthrough the medium of the electric telegraph, exchanged opinions with\r\nhim in terms known only to themselves; but the announcement made public\r\nwas to the effect that the governor-general solicited the aid of the\r\nGoorkha troops in the neighbourhood of Allahabad, and invited Jung\r\nBahadoor to a personal conference with him at that city. It was during\r\nthe last week in March that the Nepaulese allies quitted Lucknow, and\r\nmarched off towards the Oude frontier.\r\n\r\nOf the troops which remained at Lucknow, after the departure of some of\r\nthe brigades, it need only be said in this place that they began to\r\nexperience the heat of an Indian equinox, which, though much less than\r\nthat of summer, is nevertheless severely felt by Europeans. A letter\r\nfrom an assistant-surgeon in the division lately commanded by Brigadier\r\nFranks, conveyed a good impression of camp-troubles at such a time.[150]\r\n\r\nWhen the governor-general wrote the usual thanks and compliments after\r\nthe conquest of Lucknow, he adverted very properly to the previous\r\noperations, which, though not conquests in the ordinary sense of the\r\nterm, had won so much fame for Inglis, Havelock, Neill, Outram, and\r\nCampbell; and then after mentioning some of the most obvious facts\r\nconnected with the siege,[151] praised all those whom Sir Colin had\r\npointed out as being worthy of praise. Concerning the proclamation which\r\nLord Canning issued, or proposed to issue, to the natives of Oude, it\r\nwill be convenient to defer notice of it to a future chapter; when\r\nattention will be called to the important debates in the imperial\r\nlegislature relating to that subject.\r\n\r\nHere this chapter may suitably end. It was designed as a medium for the\r\nremarkable episode of the final conquest of Lucknow in the month of\r\nMarch; and will be best kept free from all topics relating to other\r\nparts of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Lucknow Proclamations._—When Sir Colin Campbell had effectually\r\n  conquered Lucknow, and had gathered information concerning the\r\n  proceedings of the rebels since the preceding month of November, it\r\n  was found that no means had been left untried to madden the populace\r\n  into a death-struggle with the British. Among other methods, printed\r\n  proclamations were posted up in all the police stations, not only in\r\n  Lucknow, but in many other parts of Oude.\r\n\r\n  One of these proclamations, addressed to the Mohammedans, ran thus:\r\n\r\n  ‘God says in the Koran: “Do not enter into the friendship of Jews\r\n  and Christians; those who are their friends are of them—that is, the\r\n  friends of Christians are Christians, and friends of Jews are Jews.\r\n  God never shews his way to infidels.”\r\n\r\n  ‘By this it is evident that to befriend Christians, is irreligious.\r\n  Those who are their friends are not Mohammedans; therefore all the\r\n  Mohammedan fraternity should with all their hearts be deadly enemies\r\n  to the Christians, and never befriend them in any way; otherwise,\r\n  all will lose their religion, and become infidels.\r\n\r\n  ‘Some people, weak in faith and worldly, think that if they offend\r\n  the Christians, they will fall their victims when their rule is\r\n  re-established. God says of these people: “Look in the hearts of\r\n  these unbelievers, who are anxious to seek the friendship of\r\n  Christians through fear of receiving injury,” to remove their doubts\r\n  and assure their wavering mind. It is also said that “God will\r\n  shortly give us victory, or will do something by which our enemies\r\n  will be ashamed of themselves.” The Mussulmans should therefore\r\n  always hope, and never believe that the Christians will be\r\n  victorious and injure them; but, on the contrary, should hope to\r\n  gain the victory and destroy all Christians.\r\n\r\n  ‘If all the Mohammedans join and remain firm to their faith, they\r\n  would no doubt gain victory over the Christians, because God says\r\n  that the victory is due to the faithful from Him; but if they become\r\n  cowards and infirm to their religion, and do not sacrifice their\r\n  private interest for the public good, the Europeans will be\r\n  victorious, and, having subdued the Mohammedans, they will disarm,\r\n  hang, shoot, or blow them away, seize upon their women and children,\r\n  disgrace, dishonour, and christianise them, dig up their houses and\r\n  carry off their property; they will also burn religious and sacred\r\n  books, destroy the musjids, and efface the name of Islam from the\r\n  world.\r\n\r\n  ‘If the Mohammedans have any shame, they should all join and prepare\r\n  themselves to kill the Christians without minding any one who says\r\n  to the contrary; they should also know that no one dies before his\r\n  time, and when the time comes, nothing can save them. Thousands of\r\n  men are carried off by cholera and other pestilence; but it is not\r\n  known whether they die in their senses, and be faithful to their own\r\n  religion.\r\n\r\n  ‘To be killed in a war against Christians is a proof of obtaining\r\n  martyrdom. All good Mohammedans pray for such a death; therefore,\r\n  every one should sacrifice his life for such a reward. Every one is\r\n  to die assuredly, and those Mohammedans who would spare themselves\r\n  now will be sorry on their death for their neglect.\r\n\r\n  ‘As it is the duty of all men and women to oppose, kill, and expel\r\n  the Europeans for deeds committed by them at Delhi, Jhujur, Rewaree,\r\n  and the Doab, all the Mohammedans should discharge their duty with a\r\n  willing heart; if they neglect, and the Europeans overpower them,\r\n  they will be disarmed, hung, and treated like the inhabitants of\r\n  other unfortunate countries, and will have nothing but regret and\r\n  sorrow for their lot. Wherefore this notice is given to warn the\r\n  public.’\r\n\r\n  Another proclamation, addressed principally to zemindars and Hindoos\r\n  in general, but to Mohammedans also, was couched in the following\r\n  terms:\r\n\r\n  ‘All the Hindoos and Mohammedans know that man loves four things\r\n  most: 1, his religion and caste; 2, his honour; 3, his own and his\r\n  kinsmen’s lives; 4, his property. All these four are well protected\r\n  under native rulers; no one interferes with any one’s religion;\r\n  every one enjoys his respectability according to his caste and\r\n  wealth. All the respectable people—Syad, Shaikh, Mogul, and Patan,\r\n  among Mohammedans; and Brahmins, Chatrees, Bys, and Kaeths, among\r\n  the Hindoos—are respected according to their castes. No low-caste\r\n  people like chumars, dhanook, and passees, can be equal to and\r\n  address them disrespectfully. No one’s life or property is taken\r\n  unless for some heinous crime.\r\n\r\n  ‘The British are quite against these four things—they want to spoil\r\n  every one’s caste, and wish both the Mohammedans and Hindoos to\r\n  become Christians. Thousands have turned renegades, and many will\r\n  become so yet; both the nobles and low caste are equal in their\r\n  eyes; they disgrace the nobles in the presence of the ignoble; they\r\n  arrest or summon to their courts the gentry, nawabs, and rajahs at\r\n  the instance of a chumar, and disgrace them; wherever they go they\r\n  hang the respectable people, kill their women and children; their\r\n  troops dishonour the women, and dig up and carry off their buried\r\n  property. They do not kill the mahajuns, but dishonour their women,\r\n  and carry off their money. They disarm the people wherever they go,\r\n  and when the people are disarmed, they hang, shoot, or blow them\r\n  away.\r\n\r\n  ‘In some places, they deceive the landholders by promising them\r\n  remittance of revenue, or lessen the amount of their lease; their\r\n  object is that when their government is settled, and every one\r\n  becomes their subject, they can readily, according to their wish,\r\n  hang, disgrace, or christianise them. Some of the foolish\r\n  landholders have been deceived, but those who are wise and careful\r\n  do not fall into their snares.\r\n\r\n  ‘Therefore, all the Hindoos and Mohammedans who wish to save their\r\n  religion, honour, life, and property, are warned to join the\r\n  government forces, and not to be deceived by the British.\r\n\r\n  ‘The passees (low-caste servants) should also know that the\r\n  chowkeedaree (office of watchmen) is their hereditary right, but the\r\n  British appoint burkundauzes in their posts, and deprive them of\r\n  their rights; they should therefore kill and plunder the British and\r\n  their followers, and annoy them by committing robbery and thefts in\r\n  their camp.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HINDOO METALLIC ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\n  _a_ Women’s Earrings. _b_ Parsee Women’s Neck-ring. _c_ Women’s\r\n    Nose-rings. _d_ Women’s Forehead Ornament. _f_ Men’s Earrings. _g_\r\n    Women’s Anklets. _h_ Women’s Armlets. _i_ Women’s Toe-rings. _k_\r\n    Women’s Finger-rings. _l_ Women’s Necklace. _m_ Men’s Necklace.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  The plans of Lucknow at pp. 321 and 362 will convey an idea of the\r\n  situation of the city relatively to the river.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n    23d Fusiliers.\r\n    79th Highlanders.\r\n    Rifle Brigade, two battalions.\r\n    1st Bengal Europeans.\r\n    3d Punjaub infantry.\r\n    2d Dragoon Guards.\r\n    9th Lancers.\r\n    1st, 2d, and 5th Punjaub cavalry, detachment.\r\n    D’Aguilar’s troop, horse-artillery.\r\n    Remington’s troop, royal artillery.\r\n    M’Kinnon’s troop, royal artillery.\r\n    Gibbon’s light field-battery.\r\n    Middleton’s light field-battery.\r\n    Head-quarters, field-artillery brigade.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Mr Russell, all day on the 6th and 7th, was watching the proceedings\r\n  from a position such as has seldom before been occupied by a newspaper\r\n  writer. He was on the roof of the Dil Koosha, taking his chance of\r\n  such shots as came from the Martinière, and viewing Outram’s marchings\r\n  and fightings by means of a telescope. Sometimes his resolution was\r\n  nearly baffled by heat and dust. ‘The wind was all but\r\n  intolerable—very hot and very high, and surcharged with dust. I had a\r\n  little camp-table and chair placed on the top of the building, and\r\n  tried to write; but the heat and the dust were intolerable. I tried to\r\n  look out, but the glasses were filled with dust; a fog would be just\r\n  as good a medium.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  ‘He (Sir Edward Lugard) will employ for the purpose the 4th brigade,\r\n  with the 38th and 53d regiments of the 3d brigade in support.\r\n\r\n  ‘The 42d Highlanders will lead the attack, and seize, as a first\r\n  measure, the huts and ruined houses to the left of the Martinière, as\r\n  viewed from the brigadier-general’s front.\r\n\r\n  ‘While the movement is being made upon the huts in question, the wall\r\n  below the right heavy battery will be lined very thickly, with at\r\n  least the wing of a regiment, which will be flanked again by a troop\r\n  of R.A. The huts having been seized, this extended wing behind the\r\n  wall will advance right across the open on the building of the\r\n  Martinière, its place being taken immediately by a regiment in\r\n  support, which will also move rapidly forward on the building. But the\r\n  attack on the huts is not to stop there. As soon as they are in, the\r\n  Highlanders must turn sharp on the building of the Martinière, also\r\n  following up the retreating enemy. The heavy guns of the right\r\n  battery, as well as those belonging to the troop, will search the\r\n  intrenchments of the tank and the brushwood to the right while this\r\n  advance is going forward.\r\n\r\n  ‘The whole line of the ruined huts, Martinière, &c., having been\r\n  seized, the engineers attached to the 2d division for the operation\r\n  will be set to work immediately by the brigadier-general to give cover\r\n  to the troops.\r\n\r\n  ‘The men employed in the attack will use nothing but the bayonet. They\r\n  are absolutely forbidden to fire a shot till the position is won. This\r\n  must be thoroughly explained to the men, and they will be told also\r\n  that their advance is flanked on every side by heavy and light\r\n  artillery, as well as by the infantry fire on the right.\r\n\r\n  ‘The brigadier-general will cause his whole division to dine at 12\r\n  o’clock. Inlying pickets will remain in camp. The 90th foot, now in\r\n  the Mahomed Bagh, will be relieved by a regiment from\r\n  Brigadier-general Franks’s division. The troops will not be allowed to\r\n  pass the lines of huts and the building without orders.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  When Sir Colin started from Buntara to the Dil Koosha on the 2d of\r\n  March, Mr Russell says of his personal appearance: ‘He wears a\r\n  serviceable air which bespeaks confidence and resolution, and gives\r\n  the notion of hard work and success. Everything about him is for\r\n  service, even down to the keen-edged sabre in a coarse leather sheath,\r\n  not dangling and clattering from his side and hitting the flanks of\r\n  his horse from gaudy sling-belts, but tucked up compactly by a stout\r\n  shoulder-belt just over his hip.... And so of his nether man; not\r\n  clothed in regulation with gold stripes, but in stout brown corduroy,\r\n  warranted to wear in any climate. The chief of the staff and the\r\n  officers of the staff for the most part follow the example of the\r\n  commander-in-chief.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  It is well to bear in mind the distinction between two great\r\n  Emanbarras at Lucknow; one, called the Emanbarra of Ghazee-u-deen\r\n  Hyder, just mentioned; and the other, the Emanbarra of Azof-u-Dowlah,\r\n  between the Muchee Bhowan and the Moosa Bagh.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  The graphic writer to whom we have more than once adverted was among\r\n  those who hastened to the Begum Kothee as a spectator on this morning.\r\n  Among the scenes that met his view he said: ‘I saw one of the\r\n  fanatics, a fine old sepoy with a grizzled moustache, lying dead in\r\n  the court, a sword-cut across his temple, a bayonet-thrust through his\r\n  neck, his thigh broken by a bullet, and his stomach slashed open, in a\r\n  desperate attempt to escape. There had been five or six of these\r\n  fellows altogether, and they had either been surprised and unable to\r\n  escape, or had shut themselves up in desperation in a small room, one\r\n  of many looking out on the court. At first, attempts were made to\r\n  start them by throwing in live shell. A bag of gunpowder was more\r\n  successful; and out they charged, and, with the exception of one man,\r\n  were shot and bayoneted on the spot. The man who got away did so by a\r\n  desperate leap through a window, amid a shower of bullets and many\r\n  bayonet-thrusts. Such are the common incidents of this war. From court\r\n  to court of the huge pile of buildings we wandered through the same\r\n  scenes—dead sepoys—blood-splashed gardens—groups of eager Highlanders,\r\n  looking out for the enemy’s loopholes—more eager groups of plunderers\r\n  searching the dead, many of whom lay heaped on the top of each other,\r\n  amid the ruins of rooms brought down upon them by our cannon-shot. Two\r\n  of these were veritable chambers of horrors. It must be remembered\r\n  that the sepoys and matchlockmen wear cotton clothes, many at this\r\n  time of year using thickly quilted tunics; and in each room there is a\r\n  number of _resais_, or quilted cotton coverlets, which serve as beds\r\n  and quilts to the natives. The explosion of powder sets fire to this\r\n  cotton very readily, and it may be easily conceived how horrible are\r\n  the consequences where a number of these sepoys and Nujeebs get into a\r\n  place whence there is no escape, and where they fall in heaps by our\r\n  shot. The matches of the men and the discharges of their guns set fire\r\n  to their cotton clothing; it is fed by the very fat of the dead\r\n  bodies; the smell is pungent and overpowering, and nauseous to a\r\n  degree. I looked in at two such rooms, where, through the dense smoke,\r\n  I could see piles of bodies; and I was obliged to own that the horrors\r\n  of the hospital at Sebastopol were far exceeded by what I witnessed.\r\n  Upwards of 300 dead were found in the courts of the palace, and, if we\r\n  put the wounded carried off at 700, we may reckon that the capture of\r\n  the place cost the enemy 1000 men at least. The rooms of the building\r\n  round the numerous courts were for the most part small and dark,\r\n  compared with the great size of the corridors and garden enclosures.\r\n  The state-saloon, fitted up for durbars and entertainments, once\r\n  possessed some claims to magnificence, which were, however, now lying\r\n  under our feet in the shape of lustres, mirrors, pier-glasses, gilt\r\n  tables, damask, silk and satin, embroidered fragments of furniture,\r\n  and marble tables, over which one made his way from place to place\r\n  with difficulty. The camp-followers were busily engaged in selecting\r\n  and carrying away such articles as attracted their fancy—shawls,\r\n  _resais_, cushions, umbrellas, swords, matchlocks, tom-toms or drums,\r\n  pictures, looking-glasses, trumpets; but the more valuable plunder\r\n  disappeared last night. It will be long before a Begum can live here\r\n  in state again. Every room and wall and tower are battered and\r\n  breached by our shot.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  ‘It having been understood that several small pieces of ordnance\r\n  captured in the city have been appropriated by individuals, all\r\n  persons having such in their possession are directed at once to make\r\n  them over to the commissary of ordnance in charge of the park.\r\n\r\n  ‘It is reported to the commander-in-chief that the Sikhs and other\r\n  native soldiers are plundering in a most outrageous manner, and refuse\r\n  to give up their plunder to the guards told off for the express\r\n  purpose of checking such proceedings. His excellency desires that\r\n  strong parties, under the command of European officers, be immediately\r\n  sent out from each native regiment to put a stop to these excesses.\r\n\r\n  ‘Commanding officers of native regiments are called upon to use their\r\n  best endeavours to restore order, and are held responsible that all\r\n  their men who are not on duty remain in camp, and that those who are\r\n  on duty do not quit their posts.\r\n\r\n  ‘All native soldiers not on duty are to be confined to camp till\r\n  further orders, and all who may now be on duty in the city are to be\r\n  relieved and sent back to camp.\r\n\r\n  ‘All commanding officers are enjoined to use their best endeavours to\r\n  prevent their followers quitting camp.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xxi. p. 369.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  ‘Though we are all in the town, our camp and hospital are still in the\r\n  old place. While I write this in my tent in camp, the thermometer is\r\n  at 100 degrees; not a breath of wind, and the flies—I can pity the\r\n  Egyptians now—the tent is filled with them, and everything edible\r\n  covered with them. We drink and eat flies, and in our turn are eaten\r\n  by them. They nestle in your hair, and commit the most determined\r\n  suicides in your tea or soup. Old-fashioned looking crickets come out\r\n  of holes and stare at you; lizards run wildly across the tent; and\r\n  ants by the thousand ply their wonted avocations utterly unmindful of\r\n  your presence. When night arrives, it becomes a little cooler, the\r\n  candles are lit, all the flies (save the suicides) have gone to roost\r\n  upon the tent-poles, and you fancy that your troubles are over. Vain\r\n  hope! the tent-doors are open; in flies a locust, hops into some dish,\r\n  kicks himself out again, hitting you in the face, and finally bolts\r\n  out at the opposite door. Then comes a flock of moths, all sizes and\r\n  shapes, which dart madly at the lights. At last you put out your\r\n  candle, and get into bed, when a new sound commences. Hum, hum,\r\n  something soft and light settles on your face and hands: a sensation\r\n  of red-hot needles intimates that the mosquitoes are upon you. The\r\n  domestic flea and bug also abound; their appetites quite unimpaired by\r\n  the climate. Jackals and pariah dogs yell and howl all night. Day\r\n  dawns, and you have your flies down upon you lively as ever. This will\r\n  give you some idea of our tent comforts.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  ‘From the 2d to the 16th of March a series of masterly operations took\r\n  place, by which the commander-in-chief, nobly supported in his\r\n  well-laid plans of attack by the ability and skill of the general\r\n  officers, and by the indomitable bravery and resolution of the\r\n  officers and men of all arms, drove the rebels successively from all\r\n  their strongly fortified posts, till the whole fell into the\r\n  possession of our troops. That this great success should have been\r\n  accomplished at so little cost of valuable lives, enhances the honour\r\n  due to the leader who has achieved it.’ After mentioning the\r\n  remarkable services rendered by Outram during more than five months in\r\n  the Residency and the Alum Bagh, Viscount Canning could not do other\r\n  than recognise the crowning service of that distinguished man, as the\r\n  second in command under Campbell during the great operations of March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BARRACKPORE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n                         MINOR EVENTS IN MARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving briefly narrated in the last chapter the progress of Sir Colin\r\nCampbell’s army in Oude, from the beginning towards the close of March;\r\nit now becomes expedient to watch the operations of those military\r\nofficers who, during the same month, were engaged in services in other\r\nparts of India. The achievements were not so great in magnitude or\r\nnotoriety, but they do not the less require to be noticed: seeing that\r\nthey illustrate the state of feeling among the native population, the\r\nfluctuations of fortune among the rebels, and the struggles of British\r\nofficers amid great difficulties.\r\n\r\nAs in former chapters, there will be a convenience in beginning with the\r\nCalcutta regions, and transferring attention successively to the west,\r\nnorthwest, and southwest.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Indian capital was shorn of somewhat of its splendour during\r\nthe spring months, by the absence of the governor-general at Allahabad;\r\nbut in truth this was a secondary matter; for it was not a time for\r\nlevees, gaieties, or vice-regal presentations and splendour. Calcutta\r\nexperienced a panic so late in the history of the mutiny as the 3d of\r\nMarch—one of many to which a somewhat excitable population had been\r\nexposed. A telegraphic message was received from Barrackpore, to the\r\neffect that the sepoys of two native regiments at that station—the 2d\r\nand the 23d B. N. I.—were deserting in bodies of ten or twelve; and that\r\nthe deserters were supposed to be making their way to Calcutta. The\r\nofficers of the volunteer guards were at once requested to send pickets\r\nto certain unprotected buildings in Calcutta. Very speedily these\r\npickets were told off; cavalry patrolled the streets all night; the\r\nartillerymen remained watchful within the fort; and the English troops\r\npresent were kept under arms. The rumour proved to have been greatly\r\nexaggerated, and the suspected danger passed away—but not without\r\ncausing much trepidation among the unwarlike portion of the Calcutta\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nSo numerous were the European troops that arrived at Calcutta during the\r\nwinter, and so obvious the necessity for increasing the strength of that\r\nbranch of the army in India, that preparations were made for\r\naccommodating them within easy reach of the capital. Barrackpore,\r\nalthough well supplied with sepoy lines, had never held European troops\r\nin large number. It was now resolved, instead of building new European\r\nbarracks at that place, to increase those at Chinsura. This town, about\r\ntwenty miles from Calcutta, on the banks of the Hoogly, had already a\r\nfine European barrack and military hospital, in a very healthy spot.\r\nAbout the month of March, many hundred men were set to work, to increase\r\nthe barrack accommodation to a level with the wants of five thousand\r\nEuropean troops, and to raze all the buildings within five hundred yards\r\non all sides, to form parade-grounds, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the regions north and east of Calcutta, the materials for rebellion\r\nwere pretty nearly exhausted. There had from the first been only a small\r\namount of disturbance in those districts; and it became gradually\r\nevident that the town and village population were desirous of continuing\r\ntheir peaceful avocations, uninterrupted by mutinous sepoys or fanatical\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\nIt was in many ways fortunate that the recently acquired province of\r\nPegu had remained peaceful during the dangerous periods of the mutiny.\r\nHad revolt or treason been at work in that quarter, the embarrassment of\r\nthe government would have been seriously aggravated. Disturbances, it is\r\ntrue, did take place; but they were not of such magnitude as to give\r\noccasion for alarm. This was mainly owing to the policy of the King of\r\nBurmah. We had taken from him a rich province, a slice out of his\r\nempire, by a mingled course of war and politics; and he was no more\r\nlikely to be content with that result than any other defeated monarch.\r\nBut he was a shrewd observant man; he measured the power of England, and\r\nsaw reason to believe that he would weaken rather than strengthen\r\nhimself by any hostility at this time. There were not wanting those near\r\nhim who urged him to a different policy. Burmah, like other countries,\r\nhad its war-party, who kept up a spirit of bitterness towards the\r\nBritish. This party was headed by the king’s brother, and by many of the\r\nold dispossessed Burman officials of Pegu. There is reason to believe\r\nthat, had the strength of the rebels in Oude remained much longer\r\nunbroken, the King of Burmah might have been drawn or driven into\r\nhostility in spite of himself. Whenever news came over from the opposite\r\nside of the Bay of Bengal, the Mohammedans resident in Burmah made the\r\nmost of such parts of it as indicated a decline of the English ‘raj,’\r\nand gave strength to a feeling among the Burmese which the king might\r\nnot much longer have been able to resist. In the early part of 1857\r\nthere were four European regiments in Pegu; but the urgent demands from\r\nIndia had led to the withdrawal of all these, except a wing of the 2d\r\nMadras Europeans at Toungoo, and a few of H.M. 29th at Thayetmyo; and\r\neven of native Madras troops in Pegu, the number was but small. There\r\nwas a time, in the autumn of that year, when the war-party might have\r\nwrought serious mischief to British interests; but when steam-frigates,\r\ncorvettes, gun-boats, and regiments from various quarters began to shew\r\nthemselves at Rangoon or in the Irrawaddy, or were known to be passing\r\nup the Bay towards Calcutta, the chances were altered. Instead of\r\nfighting, the king did a much wiser thing, whether from humane or from\r\npolitic motives—he subscribed ten thousand rupees towards the Mutiny\r\nRelief Fund.\r\n\r\nWest and southwest of Calcutta, in a part of India very imperfectly\r\nknown to Europeans, tranquillity was occasionally disturbed, not so much\r\nby mutinous sepoys, as by ambitious chieftains desirous of strengthening\r\nthemselves in a time of anarchy and uncertain allegiance. In the region\r\naround Chyabassa, many petty occurrences from time to time kept the few\r\nEuropeans in anxiety. There were not many rebel sepoys in that quarter,\r\nit is true; but, on the other hand, there were few troops of any kind to\r\naid Captain Moncrieff, the senior assistant-commissioner. A semi-savage\r\ntribe, called Coles or Koles, infested the neighbourhood. On the 25th of\r\nMarch, three thousand of these Coles, with a medley of guns, muskets,\r\nand native weapons of all kinds, assembled at Chuckerderpore, where\r\nMoncrieff had a small camp of marines and two guns; they were, however,\r\ndispersed by a mere handful of men, and three of their guns taken. This\r\ndistrict was kept in an agitated state mainly by the machinations of a\r\nturbulent chieftain, the Rajah of Porahat.\r\n\r\nLet us advance, however, to those regions where the audacity of the\r\ninsurgents was more seriously felt—the regions of the Middle Ganges and\r\nthe Lower Jumna. The Lower Ganges, between Calcutta and Dinapoor,\r\nremained peacefully in the hands of cultivators and traders, who were\r\nglad enough to be free from the visitations of fighting-men; but from\r\nDinapoor upwards the sources of discordance were numerous. A few\r\nmutineers lurked about, aided by a much larger proportion of desperate\r\ncharacters, who took service under chieftains (mostly Mohammedan) bent\r\nupon increasing their own power at the expense of the British.\r\n\r\nThe Azimghur district, nearly north of Benares, became in March the\r\nscene of a conflict which certainly gave a triumph for a time to the\r\nenemy, although it was favourable to the British in the first instance.\r\nThis conflict took place on the 21st at Atrowlia, between a body of\r\ninsurgents on the one side, and a small force under Colonel Millman of\r\nH.M. 37th, commandant of the Azimghur field-force. Being in camp at\r\nKoelsa, he received information from Mr Davies, magistrate of Azimghur,\r\nthat a considerable body of mutineers was in the neighbourhood of\r\nAtrowlia, a place about twenty-five miles from that city. The colonel\r\nimmediately set out, with about 260 infantry, cavalry, and gunners, and\r\ntwo pieces of ordnance—his troops being British and Madrasses. At\r\ndaybreak on the 22d, he espied the enemy—chiefly sepoys of the Dinapoor\r\nbrigade, who had followed the fortunes of Koer Singh—posted in several\r\ntopes of mango-trees. His infantry of the 37th, his Madras cavalry under\r\nColonel Cumberlege, and his two guns, speedily discomfited the enemy and\r\nput them to flight; but his day’s work was not ended. While his men were\r\nhalting in the neighbourhood of Atrowlia, and breakfast was being\r\nprepared among the topes of trees, news was suddenly brought that the\r\nrebels were advancing in great force. Millman, immediately proceeding\r\nwith some skirmishers to ascertain their strength, found them strongly\r\nposted behind a mud-wall, in the midst of topes of trees and\r\nsugar-canes. He sent back orders for his troops to advance; but the\r\nenemy increased in number so rapidly, that he could not contend against\r\nthem; he retired slowly from Atrowlia to his camp at Koelsa, followed by\r\nthe enemy, who fired at a distance, and endeavoured to turn his flanks.\r\nHe made one dash with his cavalry; but news, or at least a rumour,\r\nreaching the camp, that no fewer than 5000 rebels were approaching, such\r\na panic was created among his camp-followers, that many of the\r\nhackery-drivers left their carts, and all the cooks ran away. The\r\ncolonel, perplexed both by his foes and his camp-followers, and\r\nconscious that his camp was untenable in case of a night-attack, and\r\nthat adequate supplies would be wanting for his men—deemed it expedient\r\nto retreat to Azimghur, which he did the same day. He was compelled to\r\nabandon a portion of his tents and baggage, which fell into the hands of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThis was a vexatious and serious discomfiture. It told unfavourably in\r\ntwo directions; for while it paralysed the exertions of the few British\r\nofficers and troops in that region, it afforded to the rebels an excuse\r\nfor vaunting abroad their prowess and success. The natives, inexplicable\r\nin character to Europeans, were often incredulous to rumours of defeat\r\namong their own countrymen; but rumours on the other side spread among\r\nthem with astounding rapidity, encouraging them to schemes of resistance\r\nwhich they might possibly otherwise have avoided.\r\n\r\nIt was a natural consequence of the withdrawal from Atrowlia, and the\r\nretreat to Azimghur, that the last-named station should itself become\r\nimperiled; for a wide range of country was thus left wholly at the mercy\r\nof Koer Singh and his associates. The British in Azimghur proceeded to\r\nintrench themselves within the jail, which was surrounded by a deep\r\nditch; and every man was set to work to strengthen the fortifications.\r\nThe rebels gradually approached, to the number of four or five thousand;\r\nand then the small garrison was fairly besieged—all the rest of the city\r\nbeing in the hands of the insurgents. A messenger was despatched to\r\nBenares on the 26th, to announce the state of affairs; but all that the\r\nauthorities at that place could do, on the spur of the moment, was to\r\nsend fifty dragoons in carts, drawn by bullocks and pushed on by\r\ncoolies. A telegraphic message was at the same time sent to Allahabad;\r\nconsequent upon which a wing of H.M. 13th foot, and the depôt of the 2d,\r\nstarted off to Benares, for service at that place or at Azimghur. There\r\nwas a rumour that Koer Singh intended to attack Ghazeepore or Benares,\r\nor both, on his way from Azimghur to Arrah; and this rumour led to much\r\nentreaty for aid to the threatened stations.\r\n\r\nIt will hereafter be seen that Azimghur needed the care of Sir Colin\r\nCampbell. Meanwhile we may notice the state of affairs in a district\r\nsomewhat further north.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Goruckpore was the scene of a contest early in\r\nMarch. At that time there were assembled about 200 men of the naval\r\nbrigade, under Captain Sotheby, 200 Bengal yeomanry cavalry, 900\r\nGoorkhas, a few Sikhs and four guns—under Colonel Rowcroft. This motley\r\nbut stanch garrison was attacked on the 5th in great force by several\r\ninfluential rebels, who had with them an army of 12,000 men, including\r\n3500 sepoys of mutinied Bengal regiments. Between eight o’clock and\r\nnoon, Rowcroft not only defeated this greatly superior force, but chased\r\nthe enemy seven miles, nearly to their encampment at Bilwa or Belwar.\r\nThe enemy lost 400 or 500 in killed and wounded, eight guns, and much\r\nammunition. Among the leaders of the rebels were the Nazim Mahomed\r\nHussein, Rajah Dabie Buksh of Gonda, the Rajah of Churdah, and Mehndee\r\nAli Hussein, who were all mounted on elephants. This victory was a very\r\nfortunate one; for not only was Goruckpore saved from being a second\r\ntime overrun by insurgents, but Colonel Rowcroft received news that many\r\nthousand villagers on the banks of the Gogra were ready to rise in\r\nrebellion if he had been defeated. This kind of peril was constantly\r\nimpressed on the minds of the British officers; the consequences of a\r\ndisaster were always more than they could safely calculate.\r\n\r\nA defeat was experienced by a small force in the Allahabad district\r\ntowards the close of March, owing to the want of due information\r\nconcerning the position and strength of the enemy. Two companies of H.M.\r\n54th, a hundred Sikhs, a few Madras cavalry, and two guns, went out to\r\nattack some rebels at a place called Suraon, between Allahabad and\r\nGopeegunje. Insufficiently informed of the locality, the force came\r\nsuddenly to a spot surrounded by a jungle, in which a large body of\r\nrebels were concealed. Much to the astonishment of the magistrate of the\r\ndistrict, those rebels possessed six pieces of artillery; a fire was\r\nopened, which wrought much mischief to the British force, and eventually\r\ncompelled it to retreat. This was a small affair, but it rendered the\r\nauthorities uneasy; for it shewed that within a few hours of Allahabad,\r\nwhere the governor-general had temporarily taken up his quarters, there\r\nwere not only insurgents ready for mischief, but that those insurgents,\r\nin some way and from some source not easily accounted for, had possessed\r\nthemselves of artillery.\r\n\r\nJung Bahadoor’s participation in the later stages of the siege of\r\nLucknow was noticed in the last chapter. He had entered Oude from the\r\neast; and shortly before his junction with Sir Colin, his advanced\r\ndivision had a sharp engagement with a force of the enemy, which may\r\nbriefly be noticed here. Captain Plowden was in charge of this division;\r\nand under him were a few English and many Nepaulese officers, commanding\r\nthe Goorkha regiments of which the division consisted. Having received\r\ninformation that the Nazim Mahomed Hussein, with a force of 4000 men,\r\nintended to dispute the passage of Jung Bahadoor’s army at the road to\r\nLucknow over the Kandoo Nuddee, Captain Plowden prepared to contest the\r\nmatter with him. His division consisted of seven Goorkha regiments,\r\nabout 4000 strong, with thirteen guns. On the morning of the 5th of\r\nMarch, he found the enemy drawn up in detached parties near the bridge;\r\nhe opened fire with his guns, and then charged with infantry in line.\r\nHis progress was much disturbed by an intervening space of bush-jungle\r\nand deep ravines; nevertheless his Goorkhas charged resolutely, drove\r\nback the enemy at all points, pursued them for two or three miles,\r\nkilled 600 of their number, and captured a gun—without losing more than\r\n17 in killed and wounded. Captain Plowden, in his dispatch, told how he\r\nhad been aided by the Nepaulese General Khurruk Bahadoor, the two\r\nbrigadiers Junga Doje and Run Sing Bahadoor, Colonel Teela Bickrum Singh\r\nTappah, and other officers whose names present a formidable appearance.\r\nThe Nepaulese army pursued its way to Lucknow, and rendered a small\r\namount of assistance. When their services had terminated at that city,\r\nJung Bahadoor took a few of the best regiments with him to Allahabad, on\r\nhis expedition to an interview with the governor-general; but the main\r\nbody of his army marched off _viâ_ Nawabgunge, on the Fyzabad route,\r\ntowards the Nepaul and Goruckpore frontier. Whether Jung Bahadoor was\r\nnegotiating with Lord Canning concerning the price at which the services\r\nof the Goorkhas were to be purchased; or whether any project was afoot\r\nfor transferring some of the Goorkha regiments formally to the British\r\nservice—was not made publicly known; but it was understood that the main\r\nNepaulese force would remain near Nawabgunge until after the interview\r\nbetween the two great personages.\r\n\r\nOf the wildly excited province of Oude, it is scarcely necessary to say\r\nmuch here. The great event of the month, the siege of Lucknow, has\r\nalready been recorded; the other parts of the province were still almost\r\nwholly in the hands of the insurgents. It will, however, contribute\r\ntowards an understanding of the state of the province in March, if we\r\nadvert to a few facts concerning the temporary occupants of the city of\r\nLucknow, and the arrangements made by Sir Colin affecting his army.\r\n\r\nFirst, a word or two concerning the soldiery. It would be quite\r\nimpossible to say which regiments of the Queen’s army rendered most\r\nservice or behaved most valiantly; but the defence of Lucknow had been\r\nso extraordinary in its character, that the government deemed it right\r\nto notice specially the courage and fortitude of the 32d\r\ninfantry—Inglis’s main prop during his defence of the Residency from the\r\n1st of July till the arrival of Havelock and Outram near the end of\r\nSeptember. There was put forth an announcement to the effect that ‘her\r\nMajesty, in consideration of the enduring fortitude and persevering\r\ngallantry displayed in defence of the Residency at Lucknow, has been\r\ngraciously pleased to command that the 32d be clothed, equipped, and\r\ntrained as a light infantry regiment, from the 26th of February 1858.\r\nHer Majesty has also been pleased to command that the word “Lucknow”\r\nshall be borne on the regimental colour of the 32d light infantry, in\r\ncommemoration of the enduring fortitude and persevering gallantry\r\ndisplayed in the defence of the Residency of Lucknow for eighty-seven\r\ndays.’ Many of the other royal regiments had borne more fighting in the\r\nopen field; but none equalled the 32d in long enduring privation and\r\nheroism, owing to the extraordinary circumstances in which the regiment\r\nhad been placed.\r\n\r\nNext, concerning the city itself, the place which had undergone so\r\nstrange a series of sieges and defences. In Lucknow, after the\r\nrecapture, the shopkeepers gradually returned, opened their places of\r\nbusiness, and resumed commercial dealings. Many parts of the city had\r\nbeen so battered by shot and shell that the buildings were scarcely\r\nhabitable; but as this only occurred to a small extent in the trading\r\nstreets, there was little interruption on that ground to the return of\r\nthe inhabitants. The chief obstacles were—the complicity of many of the\r\ntowns-people in the proceedings of the mutineers, and the impoverishment\r\nof others by several days of fighting, anarchy, and plunder. The troops\r\ndestined for the defence of the city were quartered in some among the\r\nmany palaces, not so much battered by cannonading as the others. A clear\r\nspace was formed around the Kaiser Bagh, by the demolition of small\r\nbuildings; and operations were made for opening a wide street or avenue\r\nentirely through the city, from the iron bridge to the canal—strategic\r\nprecautions, intended to give the garrison control over the city in case\r\nof a turbulent rising. Precautions were in truth still necessary.\r\nLucknow had contained more ruffians, more desperate characters ready for\r\nany lawless enterprises, than most other cities in India; and the\r\nBritish authorities felt by no means certain that the lurking-places in\r\nthe narrow streets were yet cleared of them. The officers bore in mind,\r\nwith regret and resentment, that two of their companions had been\r\nmurdered in the city when the siege might have been deemed fairly over.\r\nThese two were Lieutenants Cape and Thackwell. They rode from the camp\r\ninto the city, but for what purpose was not clearly known to their\r\ncompanions. They got off their horses, tied them to a doorpost, and went\r\ninto a house. It is supposed that budmashes, prowling about, shot them;\r\nbut the only certainty is that, when some of the Madras fusiliers went\r\nout to search for them, the headless trunks of the two unfortunate\r\nofficers were all that remained to reveal the secret of their fate.\r\n\r\nThe details given in the last chapter will have rendered evident the\r\nfact that the escape of the rebels from Lucknow after the siege was far\r\nmore complete than the English public had expected or wished. How far it\r\ndisappointed those immediately responsible, no one but themselves knew.\r\nA secrecy enveloped the plans of the commander-in-chief; he told just so\r\nmuch as he wished to be known, and kept the rest to himself, or shared\r\nit with the governor-general. Whether foreseen or not, however, the\r\nescape of the rebels was very marked and significant. Sir Hope Grant and\r\nother cavalry leaders endeavoured to check them, but the check was of\r\nsmall account; in truth, the cavalry were too few for a belt of country\r\nso wide. When the fact became indisputably clear that the main body of\r\ninsurgents had got away, the question arose—whither? The camping-grounds\r\nof the fugitive rebels were very imperfectly known to the British\r\nauthorities. It was supposed, but on uncertain information, that, at the\r\nend of the month of March, Nena Sahib was at Bareilly, with 2000 men,\r\nand many members of his family; that the Begum of Oude was at Khyrabad,\r\nwith nearly 10,000 men; that 2000 more were near Shahjehanpoor; and that\r\nKhan Bahadoor Khan was concocting some scheme of operations with the\r\nNena, having Rohilcund for its theatre. These were the suppositions,\r\nfounded on vague data.\r\n\r\nOne thing Sir Colin speedily decided on. It was useless to keep a fine\r\narmy at Lucknow, while so much serious work had to be done elsewhere. As\r\nalready mentioned, he broke up his ‘army of Oude’ into separate\r\nportions. Jung Bahadoor having taken his departure with his nine\r\nthousand Nepaulese, the commander-in-chief proceeded to organise columns\r\nor divisions for special service in various directions. On the 29th of\r\nMarch Sir Colin issued a general order, pointing to the forthcoming\r\nduties of these portions of the army. The 5th and 78th regiments were to\r\nmarch from the Alum Bagh to Cawnpore. The artillery at the Alum Bagh was\r\nto be divided, some to return to the camp at Lucknow, the rest to join\r\nthe 5th regiment. The troops to be left at Lucknow were to be formed\r\ninto a division under Sir Hope Grant. This was to comprise H.M. 20th,\r\n28th, 33d, 53d, 90th, and 93d infantry, the 2d Dragoon Guards, three\r\nPunjaub regiments of horse, and various detachments of artillery and\r\nengineers, with Brigadiers W. Campbell and Barker as subordinate\r\ncommanders. Sir Edward Lugard was to form and command a division to be\r\ncalled the ‘Azimghur Field-force,’ to consist of H.M. 10th regiment,\r\nvarious detachments of cavalry, artillery, and engineers, and whatever\r\ntroops might at that time be in the Azimghur district. The infantry of\r\nthis force was to form a brigade under Brigadier Douglas; and the\r\ndestination was the district from which the force was named—a district,\r\nas we have lately seen, greatly endangered by the presence of a large\r\nrebel force. Indeed, so urgent was the need for aid in that quarter,\r\nthat Lugard started off at once. Another division, for service in\r\nRohilcund, was placed under the command of General Walpole. It comprised\r\nH.M. 42d, 79th, and 93d infantry, two battalions of the Rifle Brigade,\r\nthe 1st Bengal Europeans, two regiments of native infantry, H.M. 7th\r\nHussars and 9th Lancers, three regiments of Punjaub cavalry, the Naval\r\nBrigade from H.M. steamer _Shannon_, and various detachments of\r\nartillery and engineers. Everything portended that this division would\r\nhave hot work before it—hot both in the common and the figurative sense;\r\nfor the powerful sun of the month of April would soon pour down on the\r\nheads of the troops; while it was quite certain that Rohilcund contained\r\na large number of mutinied sepoys, rebel leaders, and desperate men\r\nready for any deeds of violence and anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt may here suitably be mentioned, that Sir Colin Campbell’s experience\r\nof Oudian warfare taught him the necessity of caution in all attacks on\r\nthe forts with which that province was so fully provided. His officers\r\nwould have dashed at them, as at other obstacles; but he forbade\r\nenterprises likely to be followed by losses which good guns might\r\nobviate. On the 24th of March, just when the army of Oude was about to\r\nbe broken up, he issued a general order concerning the arrangements to\r\nbe made for attacking such strongholds.[152]\r\n\r\nQuitting Oude for a time, and transferring attention to the important\r\nand fertile Doab between the Ganges and the Jumna, we shall see that the\r\nmonth of March found that part of India still much distracted by\r\nfighting and lawless violence. True, Allahabad was in British hands at\r\none end of it, Delhi at the other, Cawnpore and Agra at intermediate\r\npoints; but nevertheless there were numerous bands of rebels roaming\r\nabout the open country. Whether two or three of these towns were on\r\nriver-banks just beyond the Doab, does not affect the question, which is\r\nnot one of mere geographical nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Doab was brought more fully than before within the influence\r\nof military control, by the opening of a further portion of the great\r\ntrunk-railway to Futtehpoor, placing that town within a few hours’\r\ndistance of Allahabad. This opening took place on the 25th of March;\r\nwhen Viscount Canning, with nearly all the civil officers of the\r\nlast-named city, made the inaugurating journey to Futtehpoor, amid the\r\nholiday accompaniments of flags, triumphal arches, bands of music,\r\nfeasting, and speech-making. Further to the northwest, Cawnpore remained\r\na kind of central point, whence troops could be sent to quarters where\r\nthey were most needed. A few regiments only were kept there, sufficient\r\nto guard against sudden surprises. All the British who entered the place\r\nbeheld with melancholy interest the cross erected near the terrible well\r\nby the men of the 32d, in memory of the women and children of that\r\nregiment, included among the victims of Nena Sahib.\r\n\r\nThere was an important town, southwest of Cawnpore, which seemed likely\r\nto be a scene of warfare. During the month of March, it became very\r\napparent that Calpee was a spot which would speedily require attention\r\non the part of the military authorities. When Sir Colin Campbell\r\ndefeated the Gwalior mutineers at Cawnpore, many weeks earlier, they\r\nfled from that neighbourhood. Rumours spread around that a considerable\r\nportion of the defeated force had fled southwest to Calpee, fortified\r\nthemselves there, and called upon the neighbouring zemindars for\r\nsupplies of men and money—both of which were forthcoming. The truth of\r\nthis rumour, doubtful for a time, became confirmed as the spring\r\nadvanced. It was now certain that rebels in great force occupied Calpee,\r\nwell supplied with artillery and other munitions of war, and eagerly\r\nwatching for a chance of making an attack on Cawnpore—should that\r\noft-besieged place be left at any time insufficiently guarded. To what\r\nextent Nena Sahib or his brothers were connected with this Calpee force,\r\nwas not known. The struggles in and near that town belong to a month\r\nbeyond that to which this chapter relates.\r\n\r\nThe great city of Agra remained peacefully in the hands of the British.\r\nOccasionally, small columns were sent out to attack and disperse bodies\r\nof mutineers who were working mischief in the country districts; but the\r\nformidable brigades of mutinied regiments were not in that quarter. As\r\none instance; on the 11th of March, Brigadier Showers found it necessary\r\nto chastise some rebels at Bah, in the Agra district. He set forth with\r\ntwo companies of the 8th foot, 400 of the Sikh police, two guns, a\r\nhowitzer, and a mortar; and encountered a motley force of 4000\r\nrebels—comprising three troops of insurgent cavalry, three companies of\r\ninfantry, and a body of escaped convicts. These ruffians had assaulted\r\nand captured the town of Bah, plundered all the houses, carried off the\r\ncattle, and murdered some of the wealthier inhabitants. This body of\r\nrebels appeared to have come from the direction of the Gwalior\r\nterritories across the Chumbul. Many of their leaders had been in the\r\ncivil service of the Company, but turned rebels when they thought\r\nrebellion would be more profitable. Against these men Brigadier Showers\r\nmarched from Agra. A strange wild contest ensued. The enemy did not\r\nstand to fight a battle, but made use of ravines, rocks, temples, topes,\r\nand villages as places whence masked attacks might be effected. There\r\nwere no roads thereabouts, and Showers experienced much difficulty in\r\nstruggling through jungles and ravines.\r\n\r\nIt was often difficult for the officers in command to muster troops\r\nenough to put down these bands of insurgents. At one period during the\r\nmonth, Colonel Riddell marched out from Minpooree to aid in intercepting\r\nfugitives from Lucknow. While he was gone, information arrived that\r\nEtawah was threatened by a large body of rebels. No aid being available\r\nfrom Minpooree, a telegraphic message was sent on to Futteghur\r\n(Furruckabad); and Colonel Seaton immediately ordered a regiment of\r\nBengal Europeans to march to the threatened spot. These minor operations\r\nwere often very harassing to the troops, who had to march great\r\ndistances, and wage contests which did not bring them so much glory as a\r\nregular siege or a great battle. Officers naturally preferred those\r\nbattle-fields which would bring their names in honourable form into the\r\nofficial gazettes; and private soldiers those which might earn for some\r\nof them the Victoria Cross; but many weary months passed over some of\r\nthe corps, during which the troops were engaged in harassing pursuit of\r\nmarauders and ruffians whom they heartily despised, and to conquer whom\r\nbrought them very little increase of military reputation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, it may be said that, at the end of March, the\r\nefforts made by the British officers in the Doab were directed chiefly\r\nto prevent the escape of rebels across the Ganges from Oude. One small\r\nforce was watching to this intent at and near Cawnpore; another was in\r\nthe Minpooree district; a third was marching down the road from Meerut\r\nto Futteghur; while two others, under Chamberlain and Coke, were\r\nendeavouring to control the Gangetic valley between Futteghur and\r\nRoorkee.\r\n\r\nFurther to the northwest, the region around Delhi was nearly all in\r\nBritish hands, and the city itself wholly so—all the mutinous regiments\r\nbeing far away. The authorities, after Delhi had remained several months\r\npeacefully in their hands, resolved on the formation of a camel corps,\r\nunder a peculiar system of organisation. It was completed by the end of\r\nMarch, by a native named Lalla Jotee Pershaud, under the superintendence\r\nof Captain Chalmers, assistant commissary-general. The camels, 400 in\r\nnumber, were selected with great care, in the Bikaneer district. The\r\ndrivers were armed each with a sword and fusil; and each camel was\r\nfitted to carry a European soldier if necessary. The drivers, equivalent\r\nto troopers or cavalry-men, were carefully selected from the natives of\r\nRajpootana. The purpose in view was to form a corps of armed men capable\r\nof moving with great rapidity to any spot where their services might be\r\nurgently needed. Lalla Jotee Pershaud was a wealthy and influential man;\r\nand it was intended to make the officering of the corps such as would\r\nrender it an acceptable compliment to friendly natives of good position.\r\n\r\nAs to the city itself, no semblance of fighting was presented. The\r\nconquest by Sir Archdale Wilson, half a year before, had been so\r\ncomplete, that no enemy remained to fight with. The British kept just\r\nsufficient reliable troops in the place to defend it from surprise; but\r\nthe authority was mainly transferred to civil commissioners, who\r\ngradually re-established order and reorganised the revenue department.\r\nThe old king still resided there, waiting for his time of punishment. A\r\nspecial tribunal tried and executed a large number of rebels.\r\n\r\nA curious struggle of opinions arose on the question—What should be done\r\nwith Delhi? Not only within that city itself, but all over India, the\r\ncontroversy was maintained with much earnestness. The opinions resolved\r\nthemselves into three varieties—advocating destruction, decay, and\r\nconservation, respectively. When the city was captured, a very general\r\ndesire was expressed, under the influence of fierce indignation, to\r\ndestroy the place altogether, leaving not one stone upon another to tell\r\nwhere Delhi had been—or rather, leaving the stones to tell where Delhi\r\nhad ceased to be. The destructives, if these persons may thus be called,\r\nargued that Delhi should be extinguished from the list of cities,\r\nbecause it was the centre of disaffection, the scene of the first and\r\nworst stroke levelled at British power; that the Mohammedans of India\r\nwould ever think they had a national rallying-point, so long as Delhi\r\nremained; and that the destruction of this rallying-point would impress\r\nthem with an idea of British power. The place has a charm for native\r\nears; it is a sign, a symbol, a standard, a flag of nationality, the\r\nmemory of which should be effaced, as something dangerous to the future\r\nsecurity of the British ‘raj.’ Delhi, they urged, should be regarded\r\nrather as a dynastic than a commercial capital; everything in it recalls\r\nthe past greatness of a race which had just been foremost in mutiny. For\r\nall these reasons—destroy Delhi. Gradually there arose a second party,\r\nwho suggested decay rather than destruction. They said: ‘Destroy Delhi,\r\nand it would be perpetually an object of regret to the followers of\r\nIslam; but Delhi decayed would excite only a feeling of contempt. No\r\ntradition of sovereignty could attach to a dirty little village in which\r\na population of pauper Mussulmans, around the ruins of old palaces,\r\nscrambled for the charity of a contemptuous traveller.’ They recommended\r\nthat the European troops at Delhi should be removed to Hansi, where they\r\nmight be easily accommodated; that the arsenal should be removed to\r\nFerozpore; or that an entirely new European city should be built, lower\r\ndown the Jumna; and that Delhi should then be left to be supported by\r\nnatives alone, burdened by a special taxation as a punishment for\r\ntreason—this, it was believed, would gradually rob the city of all its\r\ndignity and importance. But there arose a third party, to which, it was\r\nreputed, no less a personage than Sir John Lawrence belonged, urging the\r\npreservation of Delhi. The grounds for this advice were many and\r\nimportant. It was pointed out, among other things—that Delhi is\r\nadmirably placed, geographically and politically; that its site was\r\nselected by men who looked primarily to the maintenance of power in the\r\nnorthwestern regions of India; that, as a commercial entrepôt, it is the\r\npoint at which the two great streams of Central Asian trade diverge to\r\nCalcutta and Bombay; that, as a military cantonment, the city commands\r\nthe Jumna at the best point for crossing the river; that it is the most\r\ncentral point from which the marauding Goojurs and Meewatties could be\r\ncontrolled; that the imperial palace would form an admirable fortress,\r\nto be garrisoned by British troops; and that the walls, brought at one\r\npoint within a narrower sweep, would keep out plunderers and protect the\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nWhatever was to be the course pursued, Delhi remained, at the period to\r\nwhich this chapter relates, undestroyed. The city-wall was still\r\nstanding, with the breaches hastily earthed up; all the gates had been\r\nclosed, except the Cashmere, Lahore, and Calcutta Gates, but none\r\ndestroyed; the fractured Cashmere Gate had been replaced by a temporary\r\nwooden barrier; the English church had been painted and repaired; the\r\ncollege, riddled by cannon and musket balls, had been converted into a\r\nbarrack; the magazine remained as poor Willoughby had left it, half\r\nblown up; and the palace had not suffered very materially from the\r\nsiege. Concerning the principal street of the city, an eye-witness wrote\r\nas follows: ‘The Chandnee Chowk is the only street we have seen in India\r\nto which the terms of descriptive admiration bestowed on European cities\r\njustly apply. If the traveller does not examine details too minutely,\r\nthe cheerful picturesque aspect of the Chandnee Chowk may remind him for\r\na moment of the Parisian boulevards. In the centre of a spacious street\r\nis a double row of well-grown trees, on either side a broad roadway\r\nflanked by irregular picturesque buildings. But if we speak of this\r\nstreet as being in 1858 cheerful, we can allude only to its\r\narchitectural structure. Neither its associations nor its own present\r\naccompaniments and accessories are other than gloomy. Every house has\r\nbeen plundered; and the little show of property, as it begins again\r\nunder the protection of British bayonets slowly to accumulate, cannot\r\ndisguise the ruin which 1857 has created. To a stranger, the population\r\nthat flows up and down the shining street would seem large; but to one\r\nwho saw Delhi and the Chandnee Chowk before the rebellion, it is but as\r\nthe ghost of the former life of the place that moves to and fro. There\r\nis the mosque where Nadir Shah sat and witnessed his great massacre.\r\nThere is the Kotwallee or police-station, whereat were exposed the\r\nbodies of murdered Europeans, and afterwards of their murderers the\r\nprinces, whom Hodson slew. In front of this building stand now three\r\nlarge gibbets, whereon have been already justly executed between two and\r\nthree hundred of those who joined in the murder and rapine of the 11th\r\nof May, and on which more culprits are destined yet to pay for their\r\ncrimes. Everywhere the demeanour of the native population is more than\r\nrespectful to the Europeans—it is cringing. Fear possesses every soul.\r\nNever was a conquest more thorough than is for the present that of Delhi\r\nand its neighbourhood by the British. The present disposition of the\r\nnative mind in Delhi towards us, of terror and trembling obedience, is\r\none which no wise man can wish permanently to continue. It is a\r\ndisposition, however, which no wise man will deny that it was necessary\r\ntemporarily to create, if the mild uniformity of British rule was ever\r\nagain to be asserted in Delhi.’ In connection with these observations,\r\nit may be stated that the cringing servility of the natives, so manifest\r\nat Delhi, was by no means so evident in Oude and the Doab. A sullen\r\nhaughtiness, or perhaps a fierce vindictiveness, was visible on the\r\ncountenances of a very large percentage of those natives with whom the\r\nBritish came into contact, telling of discontent, or of hostile passion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Kootub Minar, near Delhi.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf Rohilcund it is not necessary to say much in this chapter. The\r\ngreater part of it still continued, as it had been for nine months, in\r\nthe hands of the rebels; and in addition to this, many of the escaped\r\nmutineer regiments from Lucknow had unquestionably directed their steps\r\nto this province, to swell the numbers of those who were in arms against\r\nthe British. General Walpole was sent out against them with a powerful\r\ncolumn; what he achieved, we shall see in the proper place.\r\n\r\nThat part of Rohilcund which constitutes the ‘Hills,’ the group of\r\nhealthy hill-stations at the base of the Himalaya, though nearly cut off\r\nfrom communication with the Jumna regions, maintained itself bravely,\r\nnever once falling into the hands of the armed insurgents. Colonel\r\nM’Causland, military commandant in Kumaon, so steadily and watchfully\r\nmaintained British interests in that remote hilly province, that he\r\ngenerally detected hostile machinations in time to frustrate them. He\r\nhad chiefly Goorkhas for troops, Rohilcund rebels for opponents; and he\r\nseldom failed to baffle and defeat those rebels, whether his force were\r\ngreat or small. Early in March he heard that the insurgents had sent a\r\ndetachment to collect revenue—that is, to plunder—at Sitargunje, a place\r\ntwenty-five miles from his camp at Huldwanee. He determined to surprise\r\nthem; and although the success was not so great as he could have wished,\r\nthrough the unexpected absence of the larger part of the enemy’s force,\r\nstill those who were met with were speedily vanquished. He intrusted the\r\nenterprise to Captain Baugh, who commanded the Nepaul Contingent in the\r\nKumaon brigade. Baugh started off on the evening of the 3d, taking with\r\nhim about 220 horse and foot, and two mountain howitzers. To expedite\r\nmatters, he mounted his infantry and artillery on elephants; but during\r\nthe night his progress was retarded ‘by an elephant carrying one of the\r\nmountain howitzers falling sick.’ Arriving at Sitargunje early in the\r\nmorning of the 4th, he found that the main body of rebels had departed\r\non the preceding day to a village about six miles distant. Most of those\r\nremaining were within the government tehseel, a high building forty or\r\nfifty yards square; and these did not fight; they fell or escaped as\r\ntheir individual luck determined. Captain Baugh brought away from the\r\nplace whatever he thought might be most useful. Finding that the main\r\nbody of the insurgents, under Fuzul Huq, numbered not less than 5000\r\nmen, with six guns, he did not deem it prudent to march after them with\r\nhis little force to Butteree, the village where they were on that day\r\nencamped, about midway between Huldwanee and Bareilly.\r\n\r\nThe Punjaub and Sirhind continued to be nearly free from anarchy. Yet\r\nthere were symptoms which, if left unattended to, might have led to\r\nevil. The 4th regiment Bengal native cavalry, one of the last remaining\r\nlinks in that fine army, was disarmed and unhorsed at Umballa during the\r\nmonth of March. After ten months of faithfulness, amid the treachery of\r\nso many of their compatriots, these troopers at length exhibited a\r\ntendency to insubordination, not safely to be overlooked. In the Punjaub\r\ngenerally the movements of troops were very frequent and rapid, shewing\r\nthat the authorities were well on the alert. Wishing to obtain a healthy\r\nmilitary station west of the Indus, the brigadier in command laid the\r\nfoundation of Campbellpore—a station named in honour of the\r\ncommander-in-chief. This custom was often adopted in India: witness\r\nJacobabad and Sleemanabad.\r\n\r\nOne of the most instructive facts brought to light during the wars of\r\nthe mutiny, was the ardour with which some of the natives of India\r\njoined in waging battle with others. During the first and second Sikh\r\nwars, the sepoys of the Bengal native army unquestionably fought\r\nheroically against the Sikhs, winning battles in a way that excited the\r\nadmiration of their British officers. And now the Sikhs shewed\r\nthemselves equally willing to aid the British against the sepoys, and\r\nequally able to vanquish them in the field. Two inferences may\r\nlegitimately be drawn from this—that success depended rather on the\r\nBritish officers than on the kind of troops whom they commanded; and\r\nthat the maintenance of an army formed of any one nation in India is not\r\nso safe as the admixture of nationalities, each to act as a check upon\r\nthe other. The subject is adverted to in this place, because the month\r\nof March witnessed the return of the Guides to Peshawur, and the honours\r\nthat marked that event. It will be remembered[153] that this celebrated\r\ncorps, chosen among the Punjaubees for their activity and intelligence,\r\nconsisted of two small regiments, one of infantry and one of cavalry;\r\nthat they made an extraordinary march of 750 miles, from Peshawur to\r\nDelhi, in the hot weather of June 1857; and that they served most\r\ngallantly in the operations against that city during the autumnal\r\nmonths. They remained until February in and near Delhi, and then\r\nreturned to their native country. Major-general Cotton, commanding in\r\nthe Peshawur division, made a point of giving the gallant fellows an\r\nhonorary reception. He caused all the troops in the Peshawur cantonment\r\nto be paraded on the 16th of March. On the approach of the Guides to the\r\nparade-ground, the assembled troops saluted and the guns fired; the\r\nmajor-general delivered an address; a _feu de joie_ and an ordnance\r\nsalute of twenty guns followed; and the Guides marched past him in full\r\nmilitary array. Captain Battye, who had commanded the cavalry portion of\r\nthe force, was killed almost immediately on the arrival of the Guides at\r\nDelhi; but Captain Daly lived to return. Cotton addressed Daly and his\r\ncompanions first, welcoming them back to Peshawur; and then he addressed\r\nthe Peshawur force generally, telling them of the wonderful march which\r\nthe Guides had made nine months before, and of their deeds at Delhi.\r\n‘Within three hours after reaching Delhi, the Guides engaged the enemy,\r\nand every one of their officers was wounded. For nearly four months,\r\nofficers and men were almost constantly in action, sometimes twice a\r\nday. They took 600 men to Delhi, and received 200 recruits during the\r\nsiege. Not one man deserted to the enemy or from the corps; but no less\r\nthan 350 were killed and wounded, and 120 fell to rise no more. I need\r\nnot dwell on their separate deeds of valour, their general actions,\r\ntheir skirmishes, or their single combats; but as a specimen of the\r\nspirit that animated the corps, I will mention that a mere boy, Singh by\r\nname, bore a wounded European soldier out of the battle.’\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, it may be remarked that the personal\r\ncharacter of the British officers has always exercised a very notable\r\ninfluence over the native troops of India. In Brigadier Hodgson’s\r\n_Opinions on the Indian Army_, an anecdote is related, illustrative of\r\nthe power possessed over the sepoys by any commander whose prowess and\r\ngenius they had learned to value. A native officer, speaking to him of\r\nevents which he had himself witnessed, said: ‘During the campaign\r\nagainst the Mahrattas, in the year 1804, we made a tremendous forced\r\nmarch of 54 miles in 30 hours, and surprised Holkar and his cavalry at\r\nFurruckabad, and routed them with great slaughter. We had marched 250\r\nmiles in 13 days. The troops had been upon very short commons for some\r\ntime; and you, sir, know what a tyrant a hungry belly is. The sepahees\r\n(sepoys) began to be very loud in their grumblings, and expressed their\r\ndiscontent pretty freely. This was reported. A short time afterwards,\r\nLick Sahib Bahadoor (Lord Lake) was observed riding past the column\r\n_eating dry pulse_. This fact spread rapidly through the ranks; and from\r\nthat moment, not the whisper of a murmur was heard. I believe, sir, had\r\na man grumbled after that, he would have run the risk of being put to\r\ndeath by his companions—such was the love and veneration the sepahees\r\nhad for Lick Sahib Bahadoor.’\r\n\r\nSome of the half-savage mountain tribes of Peshawur and the Afghan\r\nfrontier gave occasional trouble; but neither there nor in Sinde were\r\nthe authorities prevented from sending reinforcements to the more\r\ntroubled provinces. In connection with Sinde, it may be mentioned that\r\nMr Frere, commissioner of that province, communicated a singular\r\ndocument to Lord Elphinstone, governor of the Bombay presidency. It was\r\nnot directly connected with the mutiny or its instigators; but was\r\nnevertheless deemed important by Mr Frere, as illustrating phases of\r\nHindoo character concerning which Europeans know so little. The\r\ninformation was given by Mr Macdonald, deputy-collector of Larkhana, in\r\nhis weekly digest under date 20th of March. We transcribe it in a\r\nfoot-note.[154]\r\n\r\nWe may now conveniently turn our attention to Central India—that region,\r\nsouth of the Jumna, in which Mahrattas and Bundelas were so strong. We\r\nhave stated in former chapters that Sir Hugh Rose, a distinguished\r\nBombay officer, was placed in command of various regiments and\r\ndetachments known collectively as the ‘Central India Field-force.’ He\r\nwas gradually working his way northward to the notorious city of Jhansi,\r\ndefeating rebels everywhere on his road. On the 4th of March, Sir Hugh\r\nRose was enabled to telegraph the following news, from his camp at\r\nPeeplia: ‘Yesterday, the troops under my command forced the pass of\r\nMudenpore, after a short but very vigorous resistance. The troops,\r\nBritish and native, behaved gallantly. The pass is extremely strong, and\r\nthe enemy suffered severely. They numbered about 4000 or 5000 Pathans\r\nand Bundelas, and 600 or 700 sepoys of the 52d and other regiments. I\r\nsent Major Orr in pursuit; and he cut up 50 or 60 rebels, of whom a\r\nlarge proportion were sepoys. The enemy are scattered in every\r\ndirection. They have abandoned the little fortress of Seraj, a fort or\r\narsenal which is the property of the Rajah of Shagurh, in which I shall\r\nhave a small force to keep up my communication with Saugor. I am now in\r\ncommunication with my first brigade (under Brigadier Stuart) at\r\nChendaree, and this gives me command of the whole of the country up to\r\nJhansi, with the exception of two or three forts, which I can take.’\r\nAbout a week later, he sent news to Bombay that the capture of the pass\r\nof Mudenpore—on the line of hills which separated the British district\r\nof Saugor from the little state of Shagurh—and the defeat of the rebels\r\non the 3d, had produced advantages far exceeding those at first\r\nanticipated by him. The rebels had successively abandoned several\r\nstrongholds which they had possessed—first the fort of Seraj, with four\r\nguns, a rude manufactory for powder, shot and shell, carriages and\r\ntents; then the town and fort of Murrowra, with a triple line of\r\ndefences; then the town and fort of Multhone; next the pass of Goonah;\r\nthen the pass and town of Hurat; and lastly, the fort of Cornel Gurh. As\r\nall the passes had been fortified and barricaded, their precipitate\r\nabandonment by the rebels was fortunate for Sir Hugh. Another result was\r\nthe occupation by him of the hitherto independent district of Shagurh;\r\nthe rajah having joined the rebels, Sir Robert Hamilton and Sir Hugh\r\nRose resolved to punish him by ‘annexing’ his small territory, or at\r\nleast occupying it until instructions could be received from Calcutta.\r\nAccordingly, on the 10th of March, the British flag was hoisted at\r\nMurrowra, in Shagurh, in presence of Rose’s second brigade, under a\r\nsalute of twenty-one guns. The encampment of the brigade at this time\r\nwas about twenty-five miles from Jhansi. Rose and Hamilton were well on\r\nthe alert; for Balla Sahib, brother of the Nena, was at that time\r\nheading an army of rabble, and levying contributions in various parts of\r\nBundelcund. What troops this rebel had with him, was not clearly known;\r\nbut it was found that the Rajah of Chuanpore had been mulcted by him of\r\nseven lacs of rupees; and the Rajah of Churkaree, resisting a similar\r\ndemand, had had his town destroyed by fire, and was compelled to take\r\nrefuge in his fort. Mr Carne, British resident in Churkaree, narrowly\r\nescaped capture at the hands of the rebels.\r\n\r\nWhile Rose was thus engaged, Brigadier Stuart, with the first brigade of\r\nthe Central India Field-force, was clearing out various rebel haunts in\r\ndistricts lying southward of Jhansi. On the morning of the 6th of March,\r\nStuart’s column or brigade set out from his camp near the Chendaree\r\nfort, and marched six or eight miles to Khookwasas, a fort near which a\r\nlarge body of rebels were assembled. The route being through a thick\r\njungle nearly the whole distance, the 25th and 86th regiments advanced\r\ncautiously, in skirmishing order. Arriving at a small pass near the\r\nfort, Stuart found that the enemy had barricaded the road, and lined the\r\nhills on either side with matchlockmen. The engineers soon cleared away\r\nthe barricades; while a small party of the 86th rushed up the hills and\r\ndislodged the matchlockmen. Shortly afterwards, however, it was\r\nascertained that the chief body of the enemy had taken up a position\r\nbehind the wall of an enclosure about a mile from the fort. The 86th\r\ndashed forwards to gain this enclosure; two of the officers, Lieutenant\r\nLewis and Captain Keating, climbed to its top before any of their men,\r\nand jumped down into the interior of the enclosure. The troops soon\r\ncleared out the enclosure, and then pursued their operations against the\r\nfort itself. Working his way steadily onwards, defeating and expelling\r\nbodies of insurgents from neighbouring villages, Stuart was at length\r\nenabled, on the 17th, to capture the fort of Chendaree itself. This\r\nplace, situated in Malwah, about a hundred miles from Gwalior, is in a\r\ndistrict which was assigned by Scindia in 1844, according to agreement\r\nwith the British government, to assist in the maintenance of the Gwalior\r\nContingent. The fort—consisting of a strong rampart of sandstone,\r\nflanked by circular towers, and crowning a high hill—was in the hands of\r\ninsurgents at the date now under notice; and it was Brigadier Stuart’s\r\nduty to capture it. After cannonading on the evening of the 16th, he\r\nformed a practicable breach in the walls, and resolved to take the place\r\nby assault on the following morning. This he did very effectually. The\r\n25th and 86th regiments, by an impetuous rush, carried everything before\r\nthem. Captain Keating was severely wounded whilst foremost with the\r\nstorming-party. The enemy mostly escaped, on account of the simple\r\nfailure of a letter. On the preceding evening, the brigadier received a\r\nmessage informing him that Captain Abbott was within available distance\r\nwith a considerable body of irregular cavalry; and in return a letter\r\nwas despatched to Abbott, requesting him to gallop forward and invest\r\nthe north side of the fort. This letter did not reach Abbott in time;\r\nand as a consequence, there was no obstacle to the escape of the rebels\r\nnorthward. All the guns, eight of iron and two of brass, were taken. The\r\nfort was given up to the keeping of one of Scindia’s lieutenants or\r\nsoubahs, in friendly relation with the British; and the inhabitants of\r\nthe town resumed their peaceful avocations, apparently glad to get rid\r\nof the presence of the rebels.\r\n\r\nStuart’s operations at Chendaree greatly facilitated the advance of Sir\r\nHugh Rose towards Jhansi. He marched on, with the second brigade of his\r\nCentral India Field-force, and reached that blood-stained city on the\r\n21st of March. He gave a sketch of his operations from the 20th to the\r\n25th in the following brief telegraphic form: ‘On the 20th my cavalry\r\ninvested as much as possible the fort and town of Jhansi. The next day\r\nthe rest of my force arrived. The rebels have fortified the walls of the\r\ntown, and, shutting themselves up in the town and fort, have not\r\ndefended the advanced position of Jhansi. The ranee has left her palace\r\nin the town, and has gone into the fort. The rebel garrison numbers\r\nabout 1500 sepoys, of whom 500 are cavalry, and 10,000 Bundelas, with 30\r\nor 40 cannon. Their position is strong; but I have occupied two good\r\npositions, one a breaching, the other a flanking one. I have been\r\ndelayed by the want of a plan of Jhansi, and consequently have been\r\nobliged to make long and repeated reconnaissances. I opened a flanking\r\nfire, vertical and horizontal, yesterday (the 25th), and hope to open a\r\nbreaching fire to-morrow, or at latest the next day.’ We shall see in a\r\nlater page that Sir Hugh completely succeeded in his assault, early in\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nThe present may be a proper place in which to advert to a matter which\r\ngreatly agitated the public mind from time to time, both in England and\r\nIndia—namely, the conduct of the insurgents towards those of the British\r\nwho unfortunately fell into their power. Jhansi was one of the stations\r\nin respect to which horror was most distressingly expressed. The morbid\r\ntaste for horrors engendered by the incidents of the Revolt gave rise to\r\nmany exaggerations. The terrible news from Delhi, Cawnpore, Jhansi, and\r\nother places, during the early months of the struggle, produced mischief\r\nin two ways; it created a demand for indiscriminate sanguinary\r\nvengeance; and it produced a tendency, not only to believe, but to\r\nexaggerate, all rumours of atrocities as committed by the natives. In\r\nEngland as well as at Calcutta, controversies almost of a fierce\r\ncharacter arose on these points; the advocates on one side treating it\r\nas a point of honour to believe the tragedies in their worst form; while\r\nthose on the other, in bitter terms demanded proof that the rumours were\r\ntrue. It was extremely difficult to disprove any statements concerning\r\natrocities committed; for in most cases there were no Europeans left\r\nbehind to give trustworthy testimony. Circumstances became known, during\r\nthe progress of the military operations, which led to an inference that,\r\nthough inhuman slaughter of innocent persons unquestionably took place\r\nsoon after Delhi fell into the hands of the insurgents, it was not\r\npreceded by so much of hideous barbarity towards the women and children\r\nas had at first been reported and believed. It also became more and more\r\nevident, as time advanced, that many of the inscriptions on the wall of\r\nthe slaughter-room at Cawnpore must have been written _after_ the\r\ndeparture or death of the hapless persons whose writing they professed\r\nto be, by some one who failed to see the cruelty of the hoax he was\r\nperpetrating. This subject is adverted to in the present place, because\r\nthe month of March lightened a little the terrible severity of the story\r\nof Jhansi, one of those which made a distressing impression on the\r\npublic mind. It will be remembered[155] that, early in June of the\r\npreceding year, the British at Jhansi, upwards of fifty in number, were\r\nall put to death by the insurgents, acting at the instigation of a\r\nwoman, the ranee or chieftainess of Jhansi; the destruction was so\r\ncomplete, that no European was left to tell the true incidents. Nine\r\nmonths afterwards, in the month of March, some of the English newspapers\r\nin India gave a detail of revolting indignities said to have been\r\ninflicted on the females of the party at Jhansi—greatly adding to the\r\ndistress already felt by the relatives of the murdered persons. Jhansi\r\nhad by that time been restored to British rule; and Captain Pinkney,\r\nsuperintendent of Jhansi, Jaloun, and Chendaree, determined to ascertain\r\nhow far the real facts could be got at. After a diligent inquiry in\r\nvarious quarters, he arrived at a belief that the massacre, however\r\nbarbarous, had not been deepened in atrocity by the frightful\r\ncircumstances put forth in the newspapers. The truth appeared to him to\r\nbe as follows: When the British in the fort were unable longer to hold\r\nout through want of food, they surrendered to the rebels, who swore that\r\nthey would spare all their lives. No sooner, however, were the\r\nfort-gates opened, than the rebels entered, bound the men, and took them\r\nas well as the women and children to a place outside the city-walls\r\ncalled the Jokun Bagh. Here the men were placed in one group, and the\r\nwomen and children in another. The rebels and the ranee’s armed servants\r\nthen murdered all the men, Major Skene being the first cut down by the\r\njail darogah, one Bukshish Ali. After this the women and children were\r\nput to death with swords and spears. The dead bodies were stripped, and\r\nleft two days in the Jokun Bagh, when they were all thrown into a\r\nneighbouring stream. Shortly after the writing of Captain Pinkney’s\r\nreport, a letter was sent to the supreme government by Sir Robert\r\nHamilton, political agent in Central India, in which a few of the facts\r\nwere somewhat differently stated. According to his account, when the\r\nunhappy Europeans reached the Jokun Bagh, ‘they were stopped on the\r\nroadside under some trees. They were accompanied by a crowd of mutinous\r\nsepoys, irregular sowars, disaffected police, fanatic Mussulmans, men in\r\nthe service of the ranee, inhabitants of the town, and rabble. Here\r\nBukshish Ali, jail darogah, called out: “It is the ressaldar’s order\r\nthat all should be killed;” and immediately cut down Captain (Major)\r\nSkene, to whom he was indebted for his situation under government. An\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of the men, women, and children then commenced;\r\nall were mercilessly destroyed, and their bodies left strewn about the\r\nroad, where they remained until the third day, when, by permission of\r\nthe same ressaldar, they were all buried in two gravel-pits close by.’\r\nExecrable as this was, it was far less harrowing than the newspaper\r\nnarratives which had given rise to the investigation. Captain Pinkney\r\nascertained that the total number of Europeans thus barbarously murdered\r\nwas sixty-seven, of whom just about one half were women and children.\r\nSir Robert Hamilton caused the ground around the two gravel-pits to be\r\ncleared, and an enclosing wall to be built; he and all the other\r\nofficials, on a selected day, attended a funeral-service at the spot,\r\ndelivered by the Rev. Mr Schwabe, chaplain to the station; and he also\r\nplanned the erection of an obelisk. Strange that India should become the\r\nground for so many obelisks and crosses erected in memory of Europeans\r\nruthlessly murdered by natives. One hundred and two years before, in\r\n1756, Suraj-u-Dowlah, after conquering Calcutta from the Company’s\r\nservants, drove a hundred and forty-six adult Europeans, on a sultry\r\nJune evening, into a dungeon only twenty feet square; and of those\r\nmiserable creatures, a hundred and twenty-three died during the night,\r\nof heat, thirst, pressure, suffocation, and madness. An obelisk was\r\nafterwards set up, to mark this terrible ‘Black Hole of Calcutta.’ And\r\nnow, in the middle of the nineteenth century, the English again found\r\nthemselves engaged in erecting these damning memorials of native\r\nbrutality, at Cawnpore and at Jhansi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Obelisk built on the Site of the Black Hole, Calcutta, to commemorate\r\n    the Murder of the One Hundred and Twenty-three Englishmen.—From a\r\n    Drawing in the India House.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLeaving Jhansi and its mournful recollections for a while, we pass over\r\nfrom the Mahratta territories into Rajpootana; where numerous petty\r\nchieftains kept the territory in a state of much agitation. There were\r\nscarcely any of the mutinied Bengal regiments in that part of India; but\r\nthe Kotah Contingent, and other auxiliary corps which had revolted,\r\nsided with some of the chieftains in hostilities against the British. So\r\nfar as concerns the operations of the month of March, those of the Kotah\r\ninsurgents were the chief that call for attention. We have in former\r\npages alluded to a ‘Rajpootana Field-force,’ formed of several regiments\r\nsent up from Bombay. The first division of this force set forth from\r\nNuseerabad on the 10th of March, for service against Kotah. It consisted\r\nof H.M. 95th foot, a wing of the 83d, the 10th Bombay infantry, the\r\nSinde horse, and some horse and foot artillery. Siege-material of\r\nformidable character accompanied the column; comprising eighteen\r\nfield-pieces, of which ten were 8-inch mortars and howitzers, and an\r\nimmense supply of ammunition. The second division, that started on the\r\nfollowing day, consisted of H.M. 72d foot, a wing of the 83d, the 1st\r\nBombay Lancers, a mountain train, Brown’s battery, and an engineering\r\ncorps. The 8th Hussars, with detachments of horse and foot artillery,\r\nwere afterwards to join the columns. Several of the guns in the\r\nsiege-train were drawn by elephants. Brigadier-general Lawrence\r\naccompanied this field-force, but only in a political capacity; the\r\nmilitary command was held by General Roberts. The conquest of Kotah was\r\nlooked forward to as a difficult enterprise, not only from the force of\r\nthe enemy in men and guns, but from the peculiar position of the town\r\nitself. Kotah is bounded by the deep river Chumbul on one side, and by a\r\nlake on the other; and there was a probability that batteries would have\r\nto be erected on the opposite side of the river. The approach to it by\r\nland from Nuseerabad was also beset by many obstacles. It would be\r\nnecessary to traverse the Mokundurra Pass, a long and narrow valley\r\nbetween two parallel ranges of hills, easily rendered formidable by a\r\nsmall number of men. It was altogether a larger and more important\r\noperation than the conquest of the numerous petty forts with which\r\nRajpootana abounded. Many persons in India thought that those forts\r\nmight safely be left to themselves; since the hill-chieftains were more\r\nfrequently incited by hostility towards each other than towards the\r\nBritish, and since it was very little better than a waste of power to\r\npursue them into the wilds and jungles which intersect that part of\r\nIndia. One favourable circumstance in connection with Kotah was, that\r\nthe rajah was faithful, and as much opposed as the British to the\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the month was occupied by the march of Roberts’s force\r\nfrom Nuseerabad, over a difficult country. Surmounting all obstacles,\r\nthe general arrived at Kotah on the 22d of March, and encamped a mile or\r\ntwo distant, on the north bank of the Chumbul. The rebels were in\r\npossession of the south bank, having with them a powerful array of guns,\r\nmany of large calibre. The fort, the palace, and half the city, were\r\nheld by the rajah, with Rajpoots and troops from Kerowlie. On the 25th,\r\na portion of the British, about 300 in number, under Major Heatley,\r\ncrossed the river, to aid the rajah at a critical moment. The rebels had\r\nthat morning made a desperate attempt to escalade the walls, and drive\r\nthe rajah’s troops into their only remaining stronghold, the castle; but\r\nthis attempt was frustrated; had it succeeded, the rebels would have\r\ncommanded the ferry over the river. Portions of H.M. 83d, and of the\r\nBombay troops, formed the small force which crossed the river on the\r\n25th. Two days afterwards, 600 men of H.M. 95th, with two 9-pounders,\r\ncrossed over. On the 30th General Roberts was able to announce by\r\ntelegraph, ‘I this day assaulted the town of Kotah with complete\r\nsuccess, and comparatively trifling loss. No officer killed. The whole\r\ntown is in my possession.’ Upwards of fifty guns were captured. The\r\nvictory was gained by a clever flank-movement, which turned the enemy’s\r\nposition, and rendered their defences useless. This was a point in\r\ntactics which the rebels seldom attended to sufficiently; they\r\nrepeatedly lost battles by allowing their flanks to be turned.\r\n\r\nEastward of the Mahratta and Rajpoot territories, there were isolated\r\nbodies of insurgents in the Saugor regions, between the Jumna on the\r\nnorth and Nagpoor on the south. But General Whitlock, with a field-force\r\ngathered from the Madras presidency, kept these rebels under some\r\ncontrol. His movements, however, scarcely need record here.\r\n\r\nThe South Mahratta country kept up just so much disturbance as to demand\r\nthe vigilant attention of the authorities, without exciting any serious\r\napprehension. In the month of March there was much of this disturbance,\r\nnear the frontier between the two presidencies of Bombay and Madras, at\r\nBelgaum. On the one side, the Bombay government offered a large reward\r\nfor the apprehension of three brothers, rebel leaders, Baba Desaee, Nena\r\nDesaee, and Hunmunt Desaee; while the governor of the Madras presidency\r\nput in force a disarming statute on his side of the frontier. One of the\r\nleaders, Hunmunt Desaee, after many contests, was driven, with the wives\r\nand families of others among the insurgents, into a tower on the summit\r\nof a peak in the Coonung range; it was a one-storied structure, with a\r\nladder leading to an entrance trap-door. Such towers had been used by\r\nthe military police in that range, and Hunmunt defended himself here as\r\nlong as he could. There were other traitors in this part of the country.\r\nTowards the close of March, Mr Manson, one of the Company’s civil\r\nservants, obtained a clue to a conspiracy in which several natives—Naga\r\nRamchunder, Balla Bhoplay, Bhow Shrof Chowdry, and others—were\r\nconcerned; having for its object the collecting of guns unknown to the\r\nBritish authorities, and the inciting of other natives to acts of\r\nrebellion. One of these men was the chief of Jamkhundie, one a\r\nmoney-lender, and two others were Brahmins. The money-lender was\r\nsupposed to have assisted the mutineers of Kolapore with pecuniary means\r\nfor carrying on their operations. By lodging these mischief-makers in\r\nsafe keeping at Belgaum and Satara, preparatory to a trial, the\r\nauthorities checked an incipient disturbance.\r\n\r\nThis little patch of country, inhabited to a considerable extent by the\r\nsouthern Mahrattas, was the only part of the Bombay presidency south of\r\nthe city itself which was in any anxiety concerning the proceedings of\r\nthe insurgents. And indeed, northward of the city, there were no\r\nmanifestations of rebellion short of the regions around Gujerat and\r\nRajpootana; where even those who were disposed to be peaceful found\r\nthemselves embarrassed and imperiled by the turbulence of their\r\nneighbours. In Gujerat, Sir Richmond Shakespear commenced and steadily\r\ncarried on a general disarming of the population; the Guicowar or native\r\nsovereign cordially assisted him, and the two together collected many\r\nguns and thousands of stands of arms. As to the Madras presidency, it\r\nwas quite at peace. From Cuttack in the north to Travancore in the\r\nsouth, there were no rebellious regiments, and few chieftains who\r\nventured to endanger their safety by disputing the British ‘raj.’ In the\r\nNagpoor and Saugor territories, belonging rather to the Bengal than to\r\nthe Madras presidency, the elements of convulsion surged occasionally,\r\nbut not to a very alarming extent. The Nizam’s country was troubled in a\r\nway which shews how desirable it is that orientals should not be tempted\r\nby anarchy or weakness in the governing power. The regular troops were\r\nmoderately steady; but the news of mutiny elsewhere excited all the\r\nturbulent elements of the Deccan. Robber chieftains and city ruffians\r\nrose, not so much against the British, as against any who had property\r\nto lose. The town of Mulgate, held by a chieftain who commanded a motley\r\nband of Rohillas and Arabs, resisted the Nizam’s authority for some\r\ntime; but it fell, and the leaders were taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will have shewn that, when the last day of March arrived,\r\nthe attention of the military authorities in India was chiefly directed\r\nto those districts which had Azimghur, Bareilly, Calpee, and Jhansi for\r\ntheir chief cities, and which swarmed with large bodies of rebels ready\r\nto make a desperate resistance. It was left for the months of April and\r\nMay to develop the strategic operations against those places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  So frequent is the mention, in all matters relating to the local\r\n  government of India, of ‘covenanted’ and ‘uncovenanted’ service, and\r\n  so peculiar the duties of those covenanted servants who bear or bore\r\n  the title of ‘collectors’—that it may be well to sketch briefly the\r\n  Company’s remarkable system, so far as it refers to those two\r\n  subjects. The collectors and magistrates suffered much and braved\r\n  much during the mutiny, owing to their peculiarly intimate relations\r\n  with the natives; and their duties deserve on that account a little\r\n  attention in the present work. For many reasons it will be\r\n  desirable, as in the volume generally, to adopt the past tense in\r\n  speaking of this system—bearing in mind, however, that the system\r\n  was fully in operation during the mutiny, except when the officials\r\n  were actually driven away from their districts.\r\n\r\n  _’Covenanted’ and ‘Uncovenanted’ Service._—The ‘services’ supported\r\n  by the East India Company were of four kinds—civil, military, naval,\r\n  and ecclesiastical. The military has already been frequently\r\n  noticed; the Company supported a military force of something near\r\n  three hundred thousand men, involving various engagements on the one\r\n  hand with the British crown, and on the other with native princes.\r\n  The naval service was limited to a force of about sixty vessels and\r\n  five thousand men, employed chiefly in surveying, coast-guarding,\r\n  mail-conveyance, and the prevention of piracy. The ecclesiastical\r\n  service, maintained by the Company for their own servants only,\r\n  consisted of three Church of England bishops, about a hundred and\r\n  forty Protestant clergymen, three Roman Catholic bishops, and about\r\n  eighty Roman Catholic priests. The Protestants were liberally\r\n  supported; the Roman Catholics simply received a grant, in aid of\r\n  larger funds to be derived by them from other quarters. But it was\r\n  the civil service that constituted the most remarkable feature in\r\n  the Company’s organisation, embracing all the persons engaged in the\r\n  collection of revenue or the administration of justice.\r\n\r\n  The civil service was of two kinds, covenanted and uncovenanted. The\r\n  uncovenanted civil servants were very much like _employés_ in other\r\n  countries, paid reasonably for their services, but having no\r\n  peculiar privileges—no declared provision for life, no claim to\r\n  promotion by seniority, no stipulated furlough or leave of absence,\r\n  no claimable pension. They comprised Europeans, Eurasians or\r\n  half-castes, and natives. Subordinate duties, fiscal and judicial,\r\n  were intrusted to them, according to their range of ability and\r\n  supposed honesty, as judged by the local governments. The Europeans\r\n  in this class were chiefly persons who had gone out to India in some\r\n  other capacity, or were sons of officers already in service in\r\n  India. The European and Eurasian uncovenanted servants barely\r\n  reached three thousand in number. The class was mainly composed of\r\n  natives—Mohammedans more generally than Hindoos. The employment of\r\n  natives as uncovenanted servants of the Company was commenced by\r\n  Lord William Bentinck (1828 to 1835), and steadily increased under\r\n  other governors-general: insomuch that the judicial administration\r\n  of the lower courts fell almost wholly into the hands of natives.\r\n  The humbler offices in the revenue department were also filled by\r\n  them. A few of the uncovenanted servants received salaries ranging\r\n  from £500 to £800 per annum; but in the greater number of instances\r\n  the amount was far lower.\r\n\r\n  The covenanted servants comprised nominated or favoured persons who,\r\n  after receiving a special education in the Company’s seminary at\r\n  Haileybury, were subjected to examination in England, and then sent\r\n  out to India at the Company’s expense. They entered into a covenant,\r\n  prescribed by ancient custom, ‘That they shall obey all orders; that\r\n  they shall discharge all debts; and that they shall treat the\r\n  natives of India well.’ Until 1853 (when a system of public\r\n  competition was established by the charter granted to the Company in\r\n  that year), the appointment of persons to this favoured service was\r\n  wholly in the patronage of the directors. After a certain amount of\r\n  tuition and examination, the young men (’writers,’ as they were\r\n  sometimes called) were conveyed to India, where they pursued further\r\n  studies, chiefly in oriental languages, at Calcutta, Madras, or\r\n  Bombay. While so studying, they received an ‘out-of-employ\r\n  allowance.’ At length they commenced employment as ‘assistants’ to\r\n  magistrates and collectors in country districts, as soon as they\r\n  possessed a certain amount of knowledge of vernacular languages,\r\n  criminal law, and revenue law. Their daily duties were partly\r\n  magisterial, partly fiscal. After some years’ practice, the\r\n  assistant was competent for promotion. He became collector or\r\n  magistrate of a district, under regulations differing in the\r\n  different presidencies. In Bengal, the offices of judge, magistrate,\r\n  and collector were held by three different persons, all\r\n  ‘covenanted;’ in the other presidencies the offices of magistrate\r\n  and collector were held by the same person; in the ‘non-regulation\r\n  provinces’ (Punjaub, Nagpoor, Sinde, &c.), all three offices were\r\n  held by one person. The local government had a voice in the\r\n  selection of persons to fill these offices; but the principle of\r\n  promotion by seniority was extensively acted on, and was almost\r\n  claimed as a right by the ‘covenanted.’ The salaries paid were very\r\n  munificent. The lowest assistant received £500 per annum, and the\r\n  amount rose gradually to £10,000 per annum, the salary of a member\r\n  of the Supreme Council at Calcutta.\r\n\r\n  Such were the chief points of difference between the covenanted and\r\n  uncovenanted services of the East India Company. It was not so much\r\n  a distinction of race, colour, or creed, as a means of favouring\r\n  selected persons in England, and of giving those persons a special\r\n  education to fit them for civil duties in India.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Collectors and Collectorates._—We shall next notice in a succinct\r\n  way the remarkable duties of such of the covenanted civil servants\r\n  as filled the office of collector—especially in those districts\r\n  where the collector was also the magistrate. In the Northwest\r\n  Provinces, to which the mutiny was mainly confined, the\r\n  collector-magistrate of each district was in many matters controlled\r\n  by the commissioner of the province in which the district was\r\n  situated; but he had in a larger degree than the commissioner an\r\n  intimate knowledge of the villages and villagers of India, their\r\n  incomes, hopes, fears, wants, and peculiarities; and he became more\r\n  deeply involved in anxieties and dangers consequent on the mutiny.\r\n\r\n  The term ‘collector’ very inadequately expresses the status and\r\n  duties of the official so named. So far from being a mere\r\n  tax-gatherer, he was a revenue judge, an executive district\r\n  authority, with large powers and heavy responsibilities. As\r\n  collector and magistrate, he was responsible to two different\r\n  departments—to the higher judicial courts for his conduct as a\r\n  magistrate, and to the revenue department in all that concerned his\r\n  collectorship. He had two sets of assistants, with duties clearly\r\n  defined and separated. The magisterial duties being dismissed\r\n  without further description, as susceptible of easy comprehension,\r\n  we shall dwell only on the collectorship.\r\n\r\n  The duties of the collector were fivefold. He was collector of\r\n  government revenue; registrar of landed property in his district;\r\n  revenue judge between landlord and tenant; ministerial officer of\r\n  courts of justice; and treasurer and accountant of the district.\r\n  None but a man of varied and extensive attainments, united to zeal\r\n  and industry, could adequately fulfil so many duties; many of the\r\n  great names in the recent years of Indian history are those of men\r\n  who laid the foundations for their greatness as collectors. The\r\n  districts over which the collectors presided varied greatly in size\r\n  and wealth; but in all cases they comprised several thousand\r\n  villages each, and yielded revenue varying from one to two hundred\r\n  thousand pounds per annum—for the whole of which the collector was\r\n  responsible. In the whole of India, the collectorates were somewhat\r\n  under a hundred and seventy in number, for the most part identical\r\n  with districts, but in a few cases comprising whole provinces newly\r\n  annexed; and these collectorates yielded, in 1856, revenue to the\r\n  amount of about thirty millions sterling.\r\n\r\n  The collector-magistrate had generally two assistants, like himself\r\n  ‘covenanted’ servants of the Company. Besides these there were\r\n  ‘uncovenanted’ servants, European and native, sufficient in number\r\n  for the duties to be rendered. The district was marked out into\r\n  sub-districts containing from one to two hundred villages each. The\r\n  collector resided at the head-station of the district, with a staff\r\n  of clerks, writers, and record-keepers. Each sub-district was under\r\n  the revenue management of a responsible native officer, who had\r\n  subordinates under him to keep his accounts and conduct the details\r\n  of his office. Carrying down the classification still more minutely,\r\n  every village in every sub-district had its headman and its native\r\n  accountant, who were in intimate correspondence concerning the\r\n  revenue of the village.\r\n\r\n  The chief official of the district, as collector of government\r\n  revenue, obtained this revenue mainly from three sources—land-tax,\r\n  spirit and drug duty, and stamps. The second and third items were so\r\n  small in amount, that many well-wishers of the Company urged the\r\n  abandonment of those imposts; and at anyrate only a small share of\r\n  the collector’s attention was devoted to them. The land-tax was the\r\n  great source of revenue; and until the government of India undergoes\r\n  an entire revolution both in spirit and in practice, such must\r\n  continue to be the case. So decided was the importance of this tax\r\n  compared with all others, that of the thirty millions sterling\r\n  raised in 1856, no less than seventeen millions resulted from\r\n  land-tax. The land-tax formed the great fund out of which the vast\r\n  expenses for the executive government, military and civil, were\r\n  mainly paid. Hence the importance of the revenue-collector and his\r\n  land-tax duties. The assessment of the land, for the realisation of\r\n  the tax, differed in different presidencies, according to the\r\n  relations existing between the state, the landowners, the farmers,\r\n  and the labourers. In Bengal the revenue was collected in gross from\r\n  great and powerful zemindars, the state having little or nothing to\r\n  do with the actual cultivators. In Madras no zemindars or great men\r\n  were recognised; the state drew the tax from the ryots or\r\n  cultivators, each on his own bit of land. In Bombay the Madras\r\n  system existed in a modified form. In Oude nothing could be done\r\n  till the annexation in 1856, when the peculiar _thalookdaree_\r\n  system[156] laid a foundation for many troubles in the following\r\n  year. In the Northwest Provinces the assessment depended on the\r\n  peculiar village tenures, which had existed from time immemorial,\r\n  and according to which the ownership of the soil could not be\r\n  interfered with by the state so long as the village paid the\r\n  revenue. Great as may have been, and great as were, the differences\r\n  between the Hindoo, Mohammedan, and English governments, this\r\n  village system maintained its ground century after century. The\r\n  tenure of land in these provinces, recognised by the Company as\r\n  among those institutions which they wished to respect, were mainly\r\n  three in number:\r\n\r\n    _Zemindaree_—denoting those estates where the property was held\r\n      collectively without any territorial division, whether the\r\n      owners were one, few, or many.\r\n\r\n    _Puttidaree_—those estates where the property was partially or\r\n      entirely divided, and held separately by the coparceners.\r\n\r\n    _Bhyacharuh_—estates held by coparcenary communities, where\r\n      actual possession had overborne law; it was a kind of\r\n      Puttidaree founded on actuality rather than right.\r\n\r\n  Whichever of these systems prevailed, the Company respected it in\r\n  assessing the land-tax; and thus each piece of land was represented\r\n  in the tax-books by the name of a particular tax-payer or community\r\n  of tax-payers. The actual assessment, the percentage on produce,\r\n  depended on circumstances specially ascertained in each district;\r\n  but the two guiding principles laid down by the Company, when they\r\n  established a revenue-system for the Northwest Provinces were—that\r\n  the rate should be light enough to leave a wide margin of profit to\r\n  the cultivators; and that it should be fixed without alteration for\r\n  a considerable period of years. The collector, knowing how much was\r\n  assessed upon every village or every piece of land, was armed with\r\n  powers sufficient to enforce payment. Whether the assessment was\r\n  ‘light’ or not, was a standing controversy between those who\r\n  respectively supported the zemindaree, the ryotwaree, and the\r\n  village systems. The Company’s advocates generally urged that,\r\n  though the ratio of tax to produce seemed heavy, any comparison with\r\n  English land-tax would be fallacious; seeing that the villagers and\r\n  cultivators in India were not called upon to pay, in addition to\r\n  land-tax, any such imposts as excise, tithes, church-rates,\r\n  county-rates, poor-rates, or income-tax. The excellences and defects\r\n  of the system, however, are not discussed here; we simply describe\r\n  the system itself.\r\n\r\n  The collector, having a definite amount to receive, from a definite\r\n  number of villages, represented by a definite number of persons,\r\n  could neither increase nor lessen, anticipate nor postpone, the tax,\r\n  without special reasons. If a district suffered from drought, the\r\n  government often deferred or wholly remitted the tax; but this only\r\n  under well-defined circumstances. The collector’s register recorded\r\n  all changes in ownership or occupancy by death or private transfer;\r\n  and as he knew each year who _ought_ to pay, he was intrusted with\r\n  certain powers to enforce payment by imprisonment, distraint of\r\n  personal property, annulment of lease, sequestration of profits,\r\n  transfer of defaulting share to a solvent shareholder of the same\r\n  community, farming of the estate to a stranger, or sale by public\r\n  auction.\r\n\r\n  In most districts, until the time of the Revolt, the collection of\r\n  revenue was an easy task, occupying only a portion of the\r\n  collector’s thoughts in May and June, November and December. ‘So\r\n  complete the machinery,’ said a writer in the _Calcutta Review_, ‘so\r\n  prosperous the provinces, so well adjusted the assessment, that the\r\n  golden shower fell uninterruptedly; and the collector, who had\r\n  without an effort of his own transmitted a royal ransom half-yearly\r\n  to the public treasury, was scarcely aware of the financial feat\r\n  which he and his subordinates had performed.’ But when a drought, an\r\n  inundation, or any great calamity interfered with the growth or\r\n  harvesting of the crop, the collector’s duties were most trying and\r\n  laborious; seeing that he had to listen to petitions for relief or\r\n  delay from hundreds or thousands of villages in his district.\r\n\r\n  His ordinary duties as a collector of revenue occupied only a\r\n  small portion of his time and thoughts. As registrar of landed\r\n  property, he kept maps and registers of land, drawn out with a\r\n  degree of minuteness scarcely paralleled in any other country in\r\n  the world; and these maps and registers were renewed or corrected\r\n  annually, to shew the size, position, ownership, and crop of every\r\n  cultivated field in the whole district. As revenue judge between\r\n  landlord and tenant, he was often called upon to assist the\r\n  responsible landowner to collect his rent from the cultivators, or\r\n  to assist the cultivator in resisting oppression by the landlord;\r\n  it was a duty requiring a knowledge both of law and of revenue\r\n  matters. As a ministerial officer of the courts of justice, he had\r\n  to put in force, somewhat in the manner of a sheriff, all\r\n  decisions of the judge relating to land, transfers of property, or\r\n  arrears of land-tax; and his local knowledge often enabled him to\r\n  assist the judge in arriving at an equitable decision. As\r\n  treasurer and accountant, he took care of the bags of silver coin\r\n  in which the land-tax and the other taxes were chiefly paid,\r\n  tested and weighed the coin before making up his accounts, paid\r\n  monthly stipends to some of the military and civil officers of the\r\n  district, kept a minute debtor and creditor account, and\r\n  transmitted his accounts and his surplus silver to Calcutta. In\r\n  addition to all these duties, the collector, considered as the\r\n  European who possessed most knowledge on various subjects in his\r\n  district, performed miscellaneous duties scarcely susceptible of\r\n  enumeration. ‘Everything that is to be done by the executive, must\r\n  be done by him, in one of his capacities; and we find him, within\r\n  his jurisdiction, publican [tax-gatherer], auctioneer, sheriff,\r\n  road-maker, timber-dealer, enlisting sergeant, sutler, slayer of\r\n  wild beasts, wool-seller, cattle-breeder, postmaster, vaccinator,\r\n  discounter of bills, and registrar-general—in which last capacity\r\n  he has also to tie the marriage-knot for those who object to the\r\n  Thirty-nine Articles. Latterly, he has been made schoolmaster of\r\n  his district also. Every new measure of government places an extra\r\n  straw on the collector’s back. Whatever happens to be the\r\n  prevailing hobby, the collector suffers. One day specimens are\r\n  called for, for the Exhibitions of London or Paris; the next day,\r\n  the cry is for iron and timber for the railway, or poles for the\r\n  telegraph.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GROUP OF INDIAN ARMS.\r\n\r\n  1.

In the\r\n  talooka of Nuseerabad, below the hills which form the western boundary\r\n  of Sinde, and not far south of the jaghire of Ghybee Khan, the Sirdar\r\n  of the Chandia tribe, there stands the ancient and still important\r\n  town of Hamal. It is situated on a mound close to the great Western\r\n  Trunk-road, which runs from the town of Dost Allee, in Kumbur, to that\r\n  of Gool Mahomed Luggaree; this part of the country is annually flooded\r\n  by the hill-torrents, and for this reason all the towns are built on\r\n  eminences, and surrounded by strong bunds. About twelve months ago, a\r\n  certain shopkeeper of the town went out to his field with his donkey\r\n  to work. On returning in the evening he loaded the ass, and was\r\n  proceeding homewards, when the animal fell down and died. The Hindoos\r\n  of that town consider that if, through any man’s carelessness, the\r\n  death of a beast of burden is caused, that man must make a pilgrimage\r\n  to the town of Narrainsir, a few miles south of Lucput, in the Runn of\r\n  Kutch, and there, shaving his head and performing other numerous\r\n  ceremonies, expiate his fault. Consequently, when this unfortunate man\r\n  returned home and reported the death of the donkey, he was at once\r\n  told that, unless he immediately made the requisite pilgrimage to\r\n  Narrainsir, and there expiated his fault, they would neither eat nor\r\n  drink with him, nor hold any intercourse whatever with him. As the\r\n  poor man thought the ass’s death was in no way brought about by any\r\n  fault of his, he appealed to the punchayets (Hindoo juries of five\r\n  persons each) of Larkhana, Guerrilla, and Kumbar, other large towns in\r\n  the Larkhana district. They returned answer that the punchayet of\r\n  Hamal was wrong in its decision, and that they acquitted the man of\r\n  all blame as to the cause of the ass’s death. A controversy was at\r\n  once raised throughout this part of the country, and it ended in all\r\n  the punchayets of the towns of the Katcha country siding with the\r\n  punchayet of Hamal, and the punchayets of the towns on the plain near\r\n  the river taking part with Larkhana. The dispute came to a climax\r\n  during the past week, when the Larkhana punchayet, in the name and\r\n  acting for the minor towns near the river, issued a notice that the\r\n  Hindoos of these towns would no longer associate with, nor have any\r\n  intercourse with those of Hamal, Ghybee Dherah, and other towns of the\r\n  Katcha country. This challenge was at once accepted, and the\r\n  punchayets of the Katcha country issued a counter-notice, forbidding\r\n  all Hindoos of their towns to hold intercourse with those of the\r\n  district towns above mentioned; marriages before agreed upon have been\r\n  broken off, agencies broken up, partnerships dissolved, and even the\r\n  ties of relationship are no longer binding. To such an extent do the\r\n  superstitious feelings of these men act upon their social conduct.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xi., p. 179.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Chap. xxi., p. 360.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Zemindar, Hindoo landowner.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n                   DISCUSSIONS ON REBEL PUNISHMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the military struggles that marked the month of\r\nApril, it may be desirable to notice the phases of public feeling\r\nconcerning the amount of punishment due to the mutineers and rebels in\r\nIndia. The discussions on this subject undoubtedly influenced the course\r\nof proceeding adopted both by the military and the civil authorities;\r\nalthough it may not be possible to measure the exact amount of that\r\ninfluence, or the exact date at which it was felt. Some of the\r\nproceedings of Viscount Canning at Calcutta, in reference to this\r\nmatter, belonged to the month of March; some of the discussions in the\r\nimperial parliament, and at the India House, bearing on Canning’s line\r\nof policy, belonged to later months; but it will be useful to give a\r\nrapid sketch, in this place, of the nature of the discussion generally,\r\nand of the remarkable tone given to it by party politics in England. All\r\nreference to the debates concerning the reorganisation of the Indian\r\ngovernment, whether at home or in India itself, may more fittingly be\r\npostponed to a later chapter.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first, a large portion of the Anglo-Indian population\r\ncried aloud for most summary and sanguinary vengeance on rebels and\r\nmutineers of all kinds, Mohammedan and Hindoo, towns-people and country\r\npeasants. General Neill was idolised for a time by this class—not so\r\nmuch because he was a gallant soldier and a skilful commander, as\r\nbecause he was supposed to be terribly severe in his treatment of\r\ninsurgents. This matter has been adverted to in former pages, as well as\r\nthe torrents of abuse that were poured upon the governor-general for\r\n‘clemency’—a word used in a mocking and bitter spirit. Many of the\r\ncensors afterwards joined the ranks of those who abused the same\r\ngovernor-general for a policy supposed to be antagonistic to that of\r\n‘clemency.’ The fact is again mentioned here, owing to its connection\r\nwith a controversy that gave rise to formidable parliamentary struggles\r\nmany months afterwards. The proceedings of four different bodies—the\r\nCalcutta government, the Board of Control, the Houses of Parliament, and\r\nthe Court of Directors—must be briefly noticed to shew the course of\r\nthis controversy.\r\n\r\nAt first, when the mutiny was still in its earlier stages, the friends\r\nand relations of those who had suffered barbarous treatment at the hands\r\nof the natives gave utterance to a wild demand for vengeance, springing\r\nnot unnaturally from an excited state of feeling. The following, from\r\none of the Calcutta journals, is a fair example of this kind of writing\r\nin its milder form: ‘Not the least amongst the thousand evils which will\r\nfollow in the track of the rebellion is the indurating effect it will\r\nhave upon the feelings of our countrywomen when the struggle is over.\r\nThere are many hundreds of English ladies who lie down nightly to dream\r\nof horrors too great for utterance; who scarcely converse except upon\r\none dreadful subject; and who would be found almost as willing as their\r\nhusbands and fathers to go out and do battle with the mutineers, _if\r\nthey could only insure the infliction of deep and thorough vengeance_.\r\nIt is a contest with murderers who are not satisfied with their life’s\r\nblood, that they have to expect daily. Their very servants are perhaps\r\nin league to destroy them. They suffer almost hourly worse than the\r\npains of death. Many have already died by homicidal hands; but more from\r\nthe pangs of starvation and travel, from the agonies of terror, and the\r\nslow process of exhaustion. _And all this while friends and relatives\r\nsigh vainly for the coming of the day of retribution._’ The italicised\r\npassages shew only a very moderate use of the words ‘vengeance’ and\r\n‘retribution,’ but may suffice to indicate the feeling here adverted to.\r\n\r\nThe Calcutta government, as has been duly recorded in the proper\r\nchapters, from time to time issued orders and proclamations relating to\r\nthe treatment which the mutineers were to receive, or which was to be\r\nmeted out to non-military natives who should shew signs of\r\ninsubordination. There was, as one instance, the line of policy\r\ncontested between Mr Colvin and Lord Canning. The former issued, or\r\nintended to issue, a proclamation to the mutineers of the Northwest\r\nProvinces, in which, among other things, he promised that ‘soldiers\r\nengaged in the late disturbances, who are desirous of going to their own\r\nhomes, and who give up their arms at the nearest government civil or\r\nmilitary post, and retire quietly, shall be permitted to do so\r\nunmolested;’ whereas Lord Canning insisted that this indulgence or\r\nleniency should not be extended to any regiments which had murdered or\r\nill-used their officers, or committed cruel outrages on other persons.\r\nThen there were several orders and statutes proclaiming martial law in\r\nthe disturbed districts; appointing commissioners to try mutineers by a\r\nvery summary process; authorising military officers to deal with rebel\r\ntowns-people as well as with revolted sepoys; enabling the police to\r\narrest suspected persons without the formality of a warrant; making\r\nzemindars and landowners responsible for the surrendering of any\r\nill-doers on their estates; and other measures of a similar kind. When,\r\nin the month of July, Viscount Canning found it needful to check the\r\nover-zeal of some of the tribunals at Allahabad, who were prone to hang\r\naccused persons without sufficient evidence of their guilt, he was\r\naccused of interference with the righteous demand for blood. It is true,\r\nthat these were, in the first instance, merely newspaper accusations;\r\nbut as the English public looked to newspapers for the chief part of\r\ntheir information concerning India, these controversies gave rise to a\r\nvery unhealthy excitement; and weeks, or even months, often passed\r\nbefore the truth could be known—as was strikingly evidenced in the case\r\nof the lieutenant-governor of the Central Provinces, whose supposed\r\n‘clemency’ (in a matter of which, as soon appeared, he knew absolutely\r\nnothing) was held over him as a reproach for nearly four months. In\r\nSeptember appeared a proclamation at Agra, warning the natives of the\r\npossible consequences of any complicity on their parts in the\r\nproceedings of the mutineers. Part of the proclamation ran as follows:\r\n‘The government of these provinces calls on all landowners and farmers,\r\nwith their tenantry, and on all well-disposed subjects, to give all\r\npossible assistance to the authorities in bringing those outcasts\r\n(mutineers and rebels) to justice. Landowners and farmers of land,\r\nespecially, are reminded of the terms of their engagement not to harbour\r\nor countenance criminals and evil-disposed persons. The government\r\nrequires proofs of the fidelity and loyalty of all classes of its\r\nsubjects, in recovering the arms, elephants, horses, camels, and other\r\ngovernment property, which have been feloniously taken by the offenders.\r\nAll persons are warned against purchasing or bartering for any such\r\nproperty of the state under the severest penalties; and rewards will be\r\npaid to those who, immediately on obtaining possession of the same,\r\nbring them to the nearest civil or military station.’\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the imperial parliament, little took place during the\r\nyear 1857 touching on the subject of the present chapter. The opposition\r\nparty sought to shew that her Majesty’s ministers were responsible for\r\nthe outbreak; some members of both Houses broached their views\r\nconcerning the causes of the mutiny; others criticised the mode in which\r\ntroops were sent to India; some condemned, others defended, Viscount\r\nCanning; many put forth suggestions concerning the future government of\r\nIndia; many more sought to overwhelm with guilt the East India Company;\r\nwhile missionaries, civil servants, Indian judges, aristocratic\r\nofficers, favoured commanders, were made subjects of frequent and warm\r\ndebate—but the members of the legislature generally held aloof from that\r\nexcessive demand for a sanguinary policy towards the insurgents, so much\r\ndwelt on by many of the Anglo-Indians. After passing an act, containing\r\namong other provisions clauses relating to ‘The Punishment of Mutiny and\r\nDesertion of Officers and Soldiers in the Service of the East India\r\nCompany,’ parliament was prorogued on the 28th of August. During the\r\nrecess, the press was busy on those accusations and reclamations already\r\nadverted to—in turn correcting, and corrected by, the official documents\r\nwhich from time to time appeared. Commercial troubles having agitated\r\nthe country during the autumn, parliament met again on the 3d of\r\nDecember, for a short session before Christmas. Although the purpose of\r\nmeeting was prescribed and limited, the members of the legislature did\r\nnot deem it necessary or desirable to remain silent on a subject so\r\nuppermost in men’s thoughts as the mutiny in India. Speeches were made,\r\nmotions brought forward, explanations given, and returns ordered, on the\r\nstate of the army, the mode of sending over troops, the conduct of the\r\ngovernment, and various other matters bearing on the struggle in the\r\nEast. The speech from the throne contained many allusions to that\r\nstruggle, but none that bore on the mode of punishing the rebels. The\r\nEarl of Derby, in a speech on the opening-night, sought to discourage\r\nthe cry for vengeance raised in many quarters. After urging that England\r\nshould deal with the mutineers in justice and not in revenge, he added:\r\n‘For every man taken with arms in his hands there ought to be a\r\nrighteous punishment, and that punishment death. For those miscreants\r\nwho have perpetrated unmentionable and unimaginable atrocities upon\r\nwomen, death is too mild a sentence. On them should be inflicted the\r\nheavier punishment—a life embittered by corporal punishment in the first\r\ninstance, and afterwards doomed to the most degrading slavery. Be they\r\nBrahmins of the highest caste, they should be forced to undergo the\r\nlowest, most degrading, most hopeless slavery. But, while he would take\r\nthis course, he earnestly deprecated the extension of a feeling of\r\nhostility to the whole native population. From letters which he had\r\nseen, he feared that every white man in India who had suffered in any\r\nway by the mutiny came to regard every man with a black face as his\r\nenemy. Now, that was a feeling which should be restrained, if not by\r\nChristianity, at least by motives of sound policy. Measures should be\r\ntaken to convince the natives that the English are their masters; but\r\nthey must also be convinced that the English are their benefactors. We\r\nshould not try to govern India by the sword alone.’ This sentiment was\r\nalso well expressed by Mr Mangles, chairman of the East India Company,\r\nat the Haileybury examination on the 7th of December. Addressing the\r\nassembled professors, prizemen, students, and Company’s officers\r\npresent, he adverted to the sudden rupture of friendly relations in\r\nIndia, and added: ‘For many years to come, there must exist strong\r\nmistrust and suspicion, if not more bitter feelings, between those who\r\nrule and those who are subject. It is impossible that it should be\r\notherwise, after the scenes which have been passed through, the\r\ntreacheries and murders—and worse than murders—that have been rife\r\nthroughout the land. But, gentlemen, you are bound to struggle with\r\nthose feelings and subdue them. It will be your duty to remember that\r\nonly a small part, an infinitesimal part, of the population of India\r\nhave been engaged in these frightful and scandalous outrages.’ [Here\r\nmany striking instances of fidelity were brought to notice.] ‘It would\r\ntherefore be most unjust to bring the charge of treachery against the\r\nwhole people of India. It will be your duty, under these circumstances,\r\nto struggle against the suspicion and distrust which have been\r\nengendered by recent events, and to endeavour to win the affections of\r\nthe people over whom you are called upon to exercise power. If we cannot\r\ngovern India in that way, we ought to give up the country and come\r\naway.’\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met for the usual session, in February, a question was\r\nput by the Earl of Ellenborough, concerning the policy intended to be\r\npursued towards the rebels. Adverting to a rumour of some very wholesale\r\nseries of military executions in Central India, he said: ‘Without\r\nquestioning the justice of the sentence in that particular case, he\r\ndoubted if capital punishment was so efficacious as a severe flogging.\r\nThe natives were not afraid of death, but shrank from corporal pain.\r\nBesides, it is quite impossible to hang all the mutineers, and the\r\ncontinued exhibition of unrelenting severity must inevitably create a\r\nblood-feud between the natives and their European masters.’ Earl\r\nGranville, on the part of the government, replied that no particular\r\ninstructions had been sent out to Viscount Canning on this matter,\r\nbecause the utmost reliance was placed on the justice and firmness of\r\nthat nobleman: he added, that he agreed in the opinion that the frequent\r\nspectacle of capital punishment must have the worst possible effect; and\r\nhe concluded by stating that the governor-general was directing his\r\nthoughts towards the possibility of transporting some of the evildoers\r\nto the Andaman Islands.\r\n\r\nNow occurred a change in political matters which threw Indian\r\ndiscussions into a new channel. Hitherto, the subject of the punishment\r\nof mutineers had been discussed in parliament with reference rather to\r\npersons than to property. The ministry, however, having been changed on\r\ngrounds quite irrespective of Indian affairs, and the Earl of Derby\r\nhaving succeeded Viscount Palmerston as premier, India was dragged into\r\nthe consequences of this change. The Earl of Ellenborough, admitted on\r\nall hands to be a well-informed statesman on Indian matters, however\r\nopinions might differ concerning his temper and prudence, was appointed\r\npresident of the Board of Control. When governor-general of India, many\r\nyears earlier, he had been in frequent collision with the East India\r\nCompany, as represented both by the Court of Directors and by the\r\nCalcutta government; and it was thought probable that his new assumption\r\nof authority in Indian affairs would be marked by something notable and\r\nimportant. It was so. The singular termination of his ministerial career\r\nwas closely and immediately connected with the subject to which this\r\nchapter relates, in a way that may now be briefly narrated.\r\n\r\nAt first this question of punishment had to be discussed by the new\r\ngovernment in the same manner as before—that is, in relation to the\r\nsanguinary vengeance advocated by many writers of letters and newspaper\r\narticles, especially at Calcutta. On the 18th of March, Mr Rich moved in\r\nthe House of Commons for the production of certain papers which he\r\nexpected would throw light on this matter, he contended that the conduct\r\nof the army, in the punishment of the insurgents, was merciless and\r\ncruel. He intimated the necessity of requiring the authorities in India\r\nto act strictly up to the instructions of Lord Canning, who, he thought,\r\ndeserved honour for his firmness and humanity. The Calcutta journals, he\r\nasserted, recommended that Oude should be made one wide slaughter-house,\r\nin which extermination should be the rule rather than the exception; and\r\nit was but right that the government should at once check this terrible\r\nfeeling of sanguinary animosity. Most of the speakers in the debate that\r\nfollowed agreed in the view taken by Mr Rich; and more than one of them\r\nbroached the doctrine that the insurgents in Oude ought not to be\r\ntreated like rebel sepoys—seeing that, whether wisely or unwisely, they\r\nwere fighting for what they deemed national independence.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the month of April, nothing occurred in\r\nparliament involving any very great collision of opinions on this\r\nparticular subject; but towards the close of the month a clashing of\r\nviews on Oude affairs became manifest to the public. Throughout the\r\nfirst ten months of the mutiny, while Viscount Palmerston was at the\r\nhead of affairs, the opposition party, in both Houses of Parliament,\r\nfrequently appeared as advocates for the deposed royal family of Oude,\r\ndwelling on the injustice involved in the deposition. Much of this\r\nadvocacy may have been sincere, but much also was mere special pleading;\r\nfor the speakers well knew that, if in office, they would not and could\r\nnot seek to undo what had been done. No sooner did a change of ministry\r\ntake place, than the new occupants of office became much more cautious\r\nin denouncing the ‘annexation of Oude;’ seeing that, if an iniquity at\r\nall, it was one in which the Marquis of Dalhousie, the Calcutta\r\ngovernment, the Court of Directors, the Crown, and both Houses of\r\nParliament, were all implicated. Every one now saw that the practical\r\nquestion before the country was—not the rights or wrongs of the\r\nannexation—but the treatment of insurgents engaged in the warlike\r\nstruggle. It became known that the Secret Committee of the Court of\r\nDirectors had sent a letter to the governor-general in council, dated\r\nthe 24th of March, relating to the treatment which it was desirable that\r\nrebels and mutineers should receive. So peculiar and anomalous were the\r\nfunctions of this Secret Committee, that although nominally belonging to\r\nthe Court of Directors, it was little other than the mouthpiece of the\r\npresident of the Board of Control. The letter was really from the Earl\r\nof Ellenborough, rather than from any one else.\r\n\r\nBefore pursuing this narrative, it may be well to say a few words\r\nconcerning the organisation and functions of this Secret Committee—one\r\nof the many anomalies connected with our government of India. Mr Arthur\r\nMills (_India in 1858_) described the relation between the Secret\r\nCommittee, the Court of Directors, and the Board of Control, in the\r\nfollowing terms: ‘The Court of Directors meets weekly at the East India\r\nHouse for the transaction of business, the ordinary details of which are\r\ndischarged by three committees—1. Finance and home; 2. Political and\r\nmilitary; 3. Revenue, judicial, and legislative. There is also a “Secret\r\nCommittee,” with peculiar functions altogether different from those of\r\nthe three ordinary committees. The office of the Secret Committee is\r\npurely ministerial. It receives from India all dispatches on matters\r\nwith respect to which secrecy is deemed important—including those which\r\nrelate to war, peace, or negotiations with native powers or states\r\nwithin the limits of the charter, or other states or princes; and\r\nforwards such dispatches to the Board of Control. The Secret Committee\r\nalso transmits to India, after signature, dispatches prepared by that\r\nBoard, which it is bound to do, under oath, “without disclosing the\r\nsame.” The Secret Committee is composed, as prescribed by act of\r\nparliament, of three directors. The court may elect whom they please;\r\nbut the chairman, deputy-chairman, and senior member of the court, are\r\nalmost invariably appointed. The papers of the Secret Committee are in\r\ncharge of the examiner at the East India House, who is clerk to the\r\ncommittee.... There is also a secret department in the Board of Control,\r\nfor the purpose of carrying on written and oral communications with the\r\nSecret Committee of the Court of Directors. The oral communications are\r\nfor the most part carried on through the president personally; in the\r\nwritten communications he is assisted by a senior clerk, and\r\noccasionally by the secretaries of the Board. On the arrival of secret\r\ndispatches from India, the copy intended for the Board is sent to the\r\nsenior clerk in the secret department, who prepares a _précis_ of all\r\nthe letters and enclosures, which he lays before the president; who\r\nthereupon gives him instructions, oral or written, for the preparation\r\nof an answer, or sometimes drafts one himself. It is then copied in\r\nofficial form, and transmitted to the Secret Committee of the East India\r\nHouse.’\r\n\r\nThe secret dispatch, produced by the authority here described, began by\r\nexpressing a hope[157] that, as soon as Lucknow should fall before the\r\nconquering arm of Sir Colin Campbell, the governor-general would feel\r\nhimself sufficiently strong to act towards the natives with the\r\ngenerosity as well as the justice which is congenial to the British\r\ncharacter. The subsequent paragraphs laid down the propositions that it\r\nwould be better, except in aggravated instances, to award punishment\r\nsuch as is usual against enemies captured in regular war, than against\r\nrebels and mutineers—the exceptions being those in which the fighting by\r\nthe insurgents ‘exceeded the licence of legitimate hostilities;’ that\r\nthe insanity of ten months ought not to blot out the recollection of a\r\nhundred years of fidelity; that the punishment of death had been far too\r\nfrequently awarded; and that the governor-general ought sternly to\r\nresist the entreaties of those who would urge him to the adoption of a\r\nsanguinary policy.\r\n\r\nThe 6th of May was the date on which the battle may be said to have\r\nbegun in parliament, on the policy to be pursued towards Oude. Mr\r\nBright, in the House of Commons, asked the ministers whether there was\r\nany authenticity in a certain proclamation concerning Oude, said to have\r\nbeen issued by Viscount Canning; whether, if authentic, it had been\r\nissued in accordance with any directions from the home government; and,\r\nif not so sanctioned, what steps the government intended to take in\r\nrelation to it? These questions came upon the House generally by\r\nsurprise, as indicating a revelation of things hitherto hidden; and it\r\nwas then for the first time made public, by the minister who replied to\r\nthese questions—that the government had, three weeks before, received a\r\ndispatch containing a copy of the proclamation adverted to; that the\r\nmatter was immediately taken into consideration by the government; that\r\na _secret_ dispatch had been sent off, stating the views of the\r\ngovernment on the matter; and that there would be no objection to\r\nproduce both the proclamation and the dispatch. This announcement was\r\nthe forerunner of a storm, in which the passion of party was strongly\r\nmixed up. On the 7th, in the House of Lords, the Earl of Ellenborough\r\nmoved for the production of certain papers, analogous to those ordered\r\nby the other House on the preceding night; and then arose a debate\r\nwhether Viscount Canning had really issued the proclamation he intended;\r\nwhether it was a proper proclamation to issue; whether it was right that\r\nthe Earl of Ellenborough should reprimand Viscount Canning in so\r\nimperious a way as he was accused of doing; whether the secret dispatch\r\ncontaining that reprimand should have been kept so entirely concealed\r\nfrom the Court of Directors; whether it should have been sent out to\r\nCalcutta at the time it was; and whether a so-called _secret_ dispatch\r\nought to make its appearance among parliamentary papers, unrelieved by\r\nany comments on it by Viscount Canning. There was unquestionably\r\nsomething strange in the mode of proceeding; for the dispatch, although\r\nnot made known to the Court of Directors until the morning of the 7th,\r\nhad been communicated to certain members of both Houses on the 6th. Earl\r\nGranville urged that, if the government wished to get rid of Viscount\r\nCanning, the usual course might have been adopted for so doing; but that\r\nit was neither just nor generous to keep him in office, and yet give\r\npublicity to such insulting censure on him. The Earls of Derby and\r\nEllenborough replied that it was not intended to dismiss Viscount\r\nCanning, or even to censure him; but to induce him to make such\r\nmodifications in his proposed proclamation as would render the policy\r\nadopted in Oude less severe.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to attend to this much-canvassed proclamation\r\nitself, before noticing the further debates concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation in question, and the explanations bearing on it, were\r\ndated at a period when, from the absence of an electric telegraph\r\nbetween England and India, they could not of course be known in the\r\nformer country. On the 3d of March, while at Allahabad, paying anxious\r\nattention to the daily telegrams received from Oude, Viscount Canning\r\nsent a proclamation and an explanatory letter to that province, relating\r\nto the treatment to be meted out to rebels.[158] Although Sir Colin\r\nCampbell commanded the army of Oude, and conducted the military\r\noperations, Sir James Outram was chief-commissioner of the province; and\r\non his shoulders rested, at that time, all that could be effected in the\r\nway of civil government. The proclamation was to be at once a sentence,\r\na warning, and a threat, addressed to the inhabitants of Oude. It\r\nannounced that Lucknow, after months of anarchy, was now again in\r\nBritish hands; it dwelt on the fact that many of the citizens, even\r\nthose who had shared the bounty of the government, had joined the\r\ninsurgents; and it declared, that the day of retribution for evildoers\r\nhad arrived. It proceeded to name six rajahs, thalookdars, and\r\nzemindars, who had remained faithful amid great temptation, and who were\r\nnot only to retain their estates, but were to receive additional\r\nrewards. It promised a proportionate reward to all other chieftains who\r\ncould prove that they had been loyal. With these exceptions, the whole\r\nproprietary right to the soil of Oude was declared to be forfeited to\r\nthe British crown—subject only to such indulgences as might, as a matter\r\nof _favour_, be conceded to individuals, conditional on their immediate\r\nsubmission to the supreme authority, their surrendering of arms, and\r\ntheir steady assistance in the maintenance of order and discipline; and\r\nconditional, also, on their innocence of shedding the blood of\r\nEnglishmen and Englishwomen in the cruel outrages which had taken place.\r\nThe stringent and startling clause in this proclamation was that which\r\nrelated to the confiscation: declaring that, with the few specified\r\nexceptions, ‘the proprietary right in the soil of the province is\r\nconfiscated to the British government, which will dispose of that right\r\nin such manner as it may seem fitting.’ In the letter to Sir James\r\nOutram accompanying this draft of a proclamation, Viscount Canning\r\nstated that the proclamation was not to be issued until Lucknow had been\r\nfully conquered by Sir Colin Campbell; and that, when so issued, it was\r\nto be addressed only to the non-military inhabitants of Oude, without in\r\nthe slightest degree offering pardon or lenity to rebel sepoys. The\r\nproclamation was spoken of as a very indulgent one; seeing that it\r\npromised an exemption, almost general, from the penalties of death and\r\nimprisonment, to Oudian chieftains and others who had gone against the\r\ngovernment; the confiscation of estates was treated as a merciful\r\ndiminution of punishment, rather than as a severe measure of justice.\r\nSir James Outram was to exercise his judgment as to the mode and the\r\ntime for issuing the proclamation, in the English, Hindee, and Persian\r\nlanguages. He was supplied with suggestions, rather than strict\r\ninstructions, how to deal with those Oudians who had been inveterate\r\nopponents of the government, but without being concerned in actual\r\nmurder; how to regard those who had fought in the insurgent ranks, but\r\nshewed a willingness to surrender their arms; and how to draw a line\r\nbetween the chieftains on the one hand and their less responsible\r\nretainers on the other.\r\n\r\nSuch being the general character of the proposed proclamation and its\r\naccompanying letter, we proceed with the debate.\r\n\r\nAfter the discussions on Friday the 7th of May, the conduct of the\r\ngovernment underwent much discussion out of parliament; the supporters\r\nof Viscount Canning contending that the publication of the secret\r\ndispatch was unfair to that nobleman, even if the dispatch itself were\r\ndefensible. On the 10th, the Earl of Shaftesbury gave notice of a\r\nresolution condemnatory of the publication; and Mr Cardwell gave notice\r\nof a similar resolution in the House of Commons. In the course of an\r\nirregular discussion, it appeared that the government had not received a\r\nsingle official dispatch from Viscount Canning since that which\r\ncontained the draft of his proposed proclamation, and they were quite in\r\nthe dark whether the proclamation had been issued, altered or unaltered.\r\nIt also became known that the _late_ president of the Board of Control,\r\nMr Vernon Smith, had received a letter from Viscount Canning, stating\r\nthat the proclamation would require an explanatory dispatch, which he\r\nhad not had time to prepare.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, March 11th, parliament was surprised by an announcement\r\nthat the Earl of Ellenborough, without consulting his colleagues, had\r\nresigned into the Queen’s hands his seals of office as president of the\r\nBoard of Control. Amid the courteous expressions of regret on the part\r\nof the other ministers, at losing so important a coadjutor, it soon\r\nbecame evident that the publication of the secret dispatch had emanated\r\nfrom the Earl of Ellenborough, without the knowledge or consent of the\r\nEarl of Derby and the cabinet. He found that he had drawn them into\r\ntrouble; and he resolved to take the whole blame on himself—resigning\r\noffice to shield others from censure. There was a generosity in this\r\nwhich touched his colleagues. The Earl of Derby candidly admitted that\r\nthere were parts of the secret dispatch which he could not quite\r\napprove, and that the publication of it was indefensible; but that he\r\ndeeply regretted the resignation of the Earl of Ellenborough.\r\n\r\nThis will be the proper place in which to notice the celebrated dispatch\r\nfraught with such important consequences. On the 24th of March, after\r\nViscount Canning’s proclamation had been penned, but long before any\r\nnews concerning it could reach England, the Secret Committee wrote to\r\nhim on the subject of the treatment of the rebels generally. The letter\r\nwas virtually from the Earl of Ellenborough; although, on account of the\r\nabsurd system of double government, it professed to emanate from a\r\ncommittee sitting in Leadenhall Street. The general character of this\r\nletter was noticed in a recent paragraph, and the letter itself is given\r\nin Note G; it may therefore be passed without further notice here. When,\r\non the 12th of April, a draft-copy of Viscount Canning’s proposed\r\nproclamation reached England, the Earl of Ellenborough wrote the\r\nmuch-discussed ‘secret dispatch,’ purporting, as before, to come from\r\nthe Secret Committee of the Court of Directors. A few days elapsed\r\nbefore the writing, and a few more before the forwarding, of this\r\ndocument. The earl[159] expressed his apprehension that the proposed\r\nproclamation would raise such a ferment in Oude as to render\r\npacification almost impossible. He declared his belief that the mode of\r\nsettling the land-tenure when the British took possession of Oude had\r\nbeen in many ways unjust, and had been the chief cause of the general\r\nand national character of the disaffection in that province. He asserted\r\nthat the Oudians would view with dismay a proclamation which cut them\r\noff, as a nation, from the ownership of land so long cherished by them;\r\nand would deem it righteous to battle still more energetically than\r\nbefore against a government which could adopt such a course of policy.\r\nHe went through a process of argument to shew that the Oudians regretted\r\nthe dethronement of their native king; that their regret ought to be at\r\nleast respected; that they had never, as a nation, acknowledged British\r\nsuzerainty; that they ought not to be treated as rebels in the same\r\nsense as the inhabitants of those parts of India which had long been\r\nunder British control; and that the conflict in which they had engaged\r\nshould on this account be regarded rather as legitimate war than as\r\nrebellion. The haughty and stinging portions of the dispatch were\r\ncontained in the fifteenth and two following clauses or paragraphs; in\r\nwhich the earl, addressing the greatest British functionary in India,\r\nsaid: ‘Other conquerors, when they have succeeded in overcoming\r\nresistance, have excepted a few persons as still deserving of\r\npunishment; but have, with a generous policy, extended their clemency to\r\nthe great body of the people. You have acted upon a different principle.\r\nYou have reserved a few as deserving of special favour, and you have\r\nstruck with what they will feel as the severest of punishment the mass\r\nof the inhabitants of the country. We cannot but think that the\r\nprecedents from which you have departed will appear to have been\r\nconceived in a spirit of wisdom superior to that which appears in the\r\nprecedent you have made.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  East India House.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch was the celebrated secret dispatch, the writing and promulgation of\r\nwhich led to the resignation of the Earl of Ellenborough. That\r\nresignation produced an exciting controversy in and out of parliament.\r\nAs the offender, the president of the Board of Control, had sacrificed\r\nhimself, was it necessary or desirable to make the ministry generally\r\nresponsible for his supposed or alleged misdeeds? Party considerations\r\nspeedily became mixed up with the discussion of this question. The Whigs\r\nhad recently been displaced by the Conservatives, under circumstances\r\nthat occasioned much irritation; and each party availed itself of the\r\nIndia controversy as a handle to be employed against the other. On the\r\none side it was contended that Viscount Canning deserved praise rather\r\nthan censure, for his untiring attention to the affairs of India during\r\na troubled period; that, even if his proposed proclamation were\r\ninjudicious, it was not right to publish the secret dispatch relating\r\nthereto, until he had explained the reasons for framing his\r\nproclamation; and that the ministers ought not to be shielded from blame\r\nsimply on account of the resignation of their colleague. On the other\r\nhand, the ministers endeavoured to shew that this resignation ought to\r\nbe taken into account; and when this failed, they took up the cause of\r\nthe Oudians, contending that the inhabitants of that province were in a\r\ndifferent category from the other natives of India.\r\n\r\nWhen the great debates on this subject came on in both Houses, on the\r\n14th of May, the ministers dwelt forcibly on the conduct of Mr Vernon\r\nSmith, who had received a letter or letters from Viscount Canning, which\r\nhe ought, in the interests of the public, to have communicated to the\r\ngovernment, but which he shewed only to members of his own party. It was\r\nurged—and the argument made a great impression both in and out of\r\nparliament—that if the Earl of Ellenborough had known of Viscount\r\nCanning’s intention to send home an explanation concerning the intent\r\nand scope of the proclamation, it might possibly have led to a\r\nmodification of the secret dispatch, or even to an abandonment of it. In\r\nthe House of Lords, the case against the government was argued by Lords\r\nShaftesbury, Argyll, Somerset, Cranworth, Grey, Newcastle, and\r\nGranville; while the arguments on the other side were maintained by\r\nLords Ellenborough, Derby, Carnarvon, Chelmsford, and Donoughmore. The\r\nEarl of Shaftesbury had couched his resolution in such a form[160] as he\r\nthought was calculated to insure Viscount Canning fair-play whenever his\r\nintentions and proceedings should be really known. Without undertaking\r\nto defend the proclamation, in the absence of any proof whether that\r\ndocument had or had not undergone modification, he contended that the\r\ndispatch passed on the governor-general a cruel and unmerited censure;\r\nthat this so-called ‘secret’ dispatch was evidently intended by its\r\nwriter to be a public one, administering rebuke that should be known to\r\nall the world; that its publication was perilous, even seditious,\r\ninasmuch as it encouraged the people of Oude to persevere in rebellion,\r\nand virtually absolved them from all blame for their past conduct. The\r\nEarl of Ellenborough, in reply, defended every word of the dispatch; he\r\ninsisted that it would be impossible to govern India peacefully even for\r\na day, if the proclamation were acted on in its full spirit. He cared\r\nnot for office; he resigned because he had unintentionally embarrassed\r\nhis colleagues, not because he regretted any part of his conduct. The\r\nEarl of Derby, and other members of the cabinet, described the\r\nresolutions as a party manœuvre to overthrow the government; claimed an\r\nacquittal on the plea that their colleague had taken all the blame of\r\nthe publication to himself; and complained that the governor-general had\r\nnot sent one single letter to the new government, explanatory of his\r\nplans and motives. When the debate was ended, the result shewed a very\r\nclose division—there being contents, 159, non-contents, 168; giving a\r\nmajority of 9 for ministers.\r\n\r\nFar more exciting and influential was the debate in the Commons on the\r\nsame night. From the day when Mr Cardwell gave notice of his\r\nresolutions, the case was regarded as a serious one for the ministers;\r\nseeing that he was a distinguished member of an independent party in the\r\nHouse, and would be able to bring a large accession to the regular\r\nopposition votes. The very fact of the Earl of Ellenborough having\r\nresigned, seemed to afford proof that the publication of the dispatch,\r\nif not the writing of it, was disapproved by some of the ministers, and\r\nwould weaken them in the approaching debate. Mr Cardwell’s\r\nresolutions,[161] like those of the Earl of Shaftesbury, did not bind\r\nthe House to any approval of the much-talked-of proclamation, whether\r\nissued or unissued; they related only to the unfairness of the dispatch\r\nin the absence of further news from India, and to the still greater\r\nunfairness of making the reproof contained in that dispatch patent to\r\nall the world. The members of the Whig opposition, and all who sided\r\nwith them in the debate, adhered pretty closely to this line of\r\nargument; but the ministers and their supporters travelled much further.\r\nThey felt that the only justification for the dispatch and its\r\npublication was to be found in the proclamation; and they therefore gave\r\nthe proclamation as black a character as it could well receive. Viscount\r\nCanning was abused in round terms as a tyrant and spoliator; and those\r\nwho supported him were accused of being influenced purely by factious\r\nmotives in bringing forward the resolutions. The attack against the\r\ngovernment was maintained by Mr Cardwell, Lord John Russell, Mr Vernon\r\nSmith, Mr Lowe, Colonel Sykes, and others, and resisted by the\r\nsolicitor-general, Lord Stanley, Mr Baillie, &c. The debate was\r\nadjourned to the 17th, when it became evident that many of the\r\nindependent members intended to support the government—partly because\r\nthey disapproved of the Canning proclamation; partly because they\r\nsuspected the Whigs of an intention to make this Indian question a\r\nstepping-stone to a return to office; and partly because they condemned\r\nthe conduct of the late president of the Board of Control, in\r\nwithholding Canning’s letter. This last-named circumstance told very\r\nseriously against the Whig party; the Conservatives made the most of it,\r\nand won over many adherents from among the independent members. Again\r\nwas the debate adjourned, to the 18th. It now became still more evident\r\nthat the division-list would present an aspect far different from that\r\nat first expected; the prophesied majority for the resolutions gradually\r\nfell, and the ministers began to look confidently to a decision in their\r\nfavour. A new element had entered into the case. If the Derby ministry\r\nwould have resigned office when beaten, there was a sufficient number of\r\nindependent members ready to carry the motion against them; but as there\r\nwas a threat of a dissolution, and as many seats would be endangered by\r\na general election, self-interest became mixed up with patriotism.\r\nAnother adjournment took place, to the 20th, on which day the House was\r\naddressed by Sir James Graham, Mr Bright, Sir R. Bethell, Mr Labouchere,\r\nand other members of influence. The current of debate set in very much\r\nin favour of the government. It transpired that many eminent men in\r\nIndia—including Sir James Outram, Sir John Lawrence, General Mansfield,\r\nand General Franks—had all in various ways expressed an opinion that\r\nLord Canning’s proclamation, if issued in the form originally intended,\r\nwould be productive of some mischief in Oude.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, will be a convenient place in which to notice the\r\nofficially recorded opinions of Outram on the subject—the only ones\r\nwhich were presented before the House in a formal and undoubted manner.\r\nThe documents received from India shewed that Sir James entertained many\r\nmisgivings concerning the proclamation and its probable tendency. The\r\nproclamation and its accompanying letter being sent to him from\r\nAllahabad, he replied on the 8th, in a communication[162] pointing out\r\nto Viscount Canning the paragraphs which appeared to him mischievous. He\r\ndeclared his belief that there were not a dozen landowners throughout\r\nthe whole of Oude who had not in some way or other assisted the rebels\r\nduring the past struggle; and that, therefore, there would be hardly any\r\nexceptions to the sweeping confiscation proposed by the\r\ngovernor-general. He asserted most distinctly his conviction that, as\r\nsoon as the proclamation should be made public, nearly all the chiefs\r\nand thalookdars would retire to their domains, and prepare for a\r\ndesperate resistance. He expressed an opinion that the landowners had\r\nbeen very unjustly treated in the land-settlement after the annexation;\r\nthat, apart from this, their sympathy with the rebels was an exceedingly\r\nnatural feeling, under the peculiar circumstances of Oude; that it was\r\nnot until the mutiny was many weeks old that they turned against us;\r\nthat they ought to be regarded rather as honourable enemies than as\r\nrebels; that they would be converted into relentless enemies if their\r\nlands were confiscated, maintaining a guerrilla war which would ‘involve\r\nthe loss of thousands of Europeans by battle, disease, and exposure;’\r\nbut that if their lands were insured to them, they would probably be\r\nmore attached to British rule than ever they had yet been. It is evident\r\nthat Sir James Outram had already discussed this subject with the\r\ngovernor-general, for he apologises for ‘once more’ urging his views\r\nupon his lordship. A brief reply[163] was immediately sent to this\r\nletter, proposing a very slight increase of leniency in the treatment of\r\nthe landowners, but leaving the general spirit of the proclamation\r\nuntouched. Later in the month, the governor-general replied more at\r\nlength to the arguments of Sir James. He admitted[164] that the\r\ninhabitants of Oude were far differently placed from those of Bengal and\r\nthe Northwest Provinces, in respect to allegiance to the British crown;\r\nboth because the annexation had been recent, and because it had been no\r\nvoluntary act on the part of the Oudians. But he would not admit that,\r\non those grounds, the rebel thalookdars should be treated so indulgently\r\nas Outram proposed. He urged that exemption from death, transportation,\r\nand imprisonment, was a great boon, sufficiently marking the treatment\r\nof the Oudians from that of other natives. Without entering on the\r\nquestion whether the settlement of the land-claims had been unjust, he\r\noffered his reasons for thinking that that matter had not had much to do\r\nwith the complicity of the thalookdars in the rebellion. He attributed\r\nthis complicity mainly to ‘the repugnance which they feel to suffer any\r\nrestraint of their hitherto arbitrary powers over those about them; to a\r\ndiminution of their importance by being brought under equal laws; and to\r\nthe obligation of disbanding their armed followers, and of living a\r\npeaceful and orderly life.’ He maintained that if Sir James’s suggestion\r\nwere acted on, the rebels would be treated, not merely as honourable\r\nenemies, but as enemies _who had won the day_; and that this would be\r\naccepted by the natives as a confession of fear and weakness,\r\nencouraging them to regard rebellion as likely to be a profitable game.\r\nIn short, Viscount Canning insisted on his proclamation being maintained\r\nin its chief features.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that such a letter as that of Sir James Outram could\r\nfail, when made known, to exert a considerable influence in the House of\r\nCommons. The resemblance between it and the Earl of Ellenborough’s\r\ndispatch was very close, except in relation to discourteous and haughty\r\nlanguage, which Outram neither did nor could use. On the 21st of May,\r\nafter five nights’ debate, marked by speeches from almost all the\r\neminent men in the House, the contest ended in a kind of drawn battle.\r\nInfluenced by a great variety of motives, the opponents of the\r\ngovernment urged upon Mr Cardwell the withdrawal of his resolutions.\r\nThey did not wish to be compelled to vote. Some had been impressed by\r\nthe recorded opinion of Outram, and the rumoured opinions of Lawrence\r\nand other eminent men in India; some disliked party tactics, even\r\nagainst their opponents; some were afraid of a general election, if\r\ntheir votes should lead to a dissolution of parliament. All the leaders\r\nof the Whig party joined in a wish to withdraw the resolutions; and this\r\nwas done. The affair had, however, been so managed throughout as to give\r\na good deal of triumph to the Conservative government, and to strengthen\r\nthat government for the rest of the session.\r\n\r\nWhat was the ultimate fate of the much-condemned proclamation, will\r\nremain to be shewn in a later page. Two further documents relating to\r\nthis matter are given in Notes I and K.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes.\r\n\r\n  The official documents referred to in this chapter are of so much\r\n  importance, in reference to the political history of the Indian\r\n  Revolt, and to the opinions entertained by public men concerning the\r\n  feelings of the natives, that it may be well to present the chief of\r\n  them in full. Owing to the length of time necessary for the\r\n  transmission of letters between England and India, two or more of\r\n  these documents were crossing the ocean at the same time, in\r\n  opposite directions, and therefore could not exactly partake of the\r\n  nature of question and answer. We shall attempt no other\r\n  classification than that of placing in one group the documents\r\n  written in India; and in another those written in London—observing,\r\n  in each group, the order of dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A.\r\n\r\n  The first document here given is a letter dictated by Viscount\r\n  Canning when at Allahabad, and signed by his secretary, Mr\r\n  Edmonstone. It was addressed to Sir James Outram, in his capacity of\r\n  chief-commissioner of Oude, and was written at a time when the fall\r\n  of Lucknow was soon expected:\r\n\r\n                                          ‘ALLAHABAD, _March 3, 1858_.\r\n\r\n  ‘SIR—I am directed by the Right Honourable the Governor-general, to\r\n  enclose to you a copy of a proclamation which is to be issued by the\r\n  chief-commissioner at Lucknow, as soon as the British troops under\r\n  His Excellency the Commander-in-chief shall have possession or\r\n  command of the city.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. This proclamation is addressed to the chiefs and inhabitants of\r\n  Oude only, and not to the sepoys.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. The governor-general has not considered it desirable that this\r\n  proclamation should appear until the capital is either actually in\r\n  our hands or lying at our mercy. He believes that any proclamation\r\n  put forth in Oude in a liberal and forgiving spirit would be open to\r\n  misconstruction, and capable of perversion, if not preceded by a\r\n  manifestation of our power; and that this would be especially the\r\n  case at Lucknow—which, although it has recently been the scene of\r\n  unparalleled heroism and daring, and of one of the most brilliant\r\n  and successful feats of arms which British India has ever\r\n  witnessed—is still sedulously represented by the rebels as being\r\n  beyond our power to take or to hold.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. If an exemption, almost general, from the penalties of death,\r\n  transportation, and imprisonment, such as is now about to be offered\r\n  to men who have been in rebellion, had been publicly proclaimed\r\n  before a heavy blow had been struck, it is at least as likely that\r\n  resistance would have been encouraged by the seeming exhibition of\r\n  weakness, as that it would have been disarmed by a generous\r\n  forbearance.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. Translations of the proclamation into Hindee and Persian\r\n  accompany this dispatch.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. It will be for the chief-commissioner in communication with His\r\n  Excellency the Commander-in-chief, to determine the moment at which\r\n  the proclamation shall be published, and the manner of disseminating\r\n  it through the province; as also the mode in which those who may\r\n  surrender themselves under it shall be immediately and for the\r\n  present dealt with.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. This last question, considering that we shall not be in firm\r\n  possession of any large portion of the province when the\r\n  proclamation begins to take effect, and that the bulk of our troops,\r\n  native as well as European, will be needed for other purposes than\r\n  to keep guard through its districts—is one of some difficulty. It is\r\n  clear, too, that the same treatment will not be applicable to all\r\n  who may present themselves.\r\n\r\n  ‘8. Amongst these there may be some who have been continuously in\r\n  arms against the government, and who have shewn inveterate\r\n  opposition to the last, but who are free from the suspicion of\r\n  having put to death or injured Europeans who fell in their way.\r\n\r\n  ‘9. To these men their lives are guaranteed and their honour; that\r\n  is, in native acceptation—they will neither be transported across\r\n  sea, nor placed in prison.\r\n\r\n  ‘10. Probably the most easy and effectual way of disposing of them,\r\n  in the first instance, will be to require that they shall reside in\r\n  Lucknow under surveillance and in charge of an officer appointed for\r\n  that purpose.\r\n\r\n  ‘11. Their ultimate condition and place of residence may remain to\r\n  be determined hereafter, when the chief-commissioner shall be able\r\n  to report fully to the governor-general upon the individual\r\n  character and past conduct of each.\r\n\r\n  ‘12. There will be others who, although they have taken up arms\r\n  against the government, have done so less heartily, and upon whom,\r\n  for other causes, the chief-commissioner may not see reason to put\r\n  restraint. These, after surrendering their arms, might be allowed to\r\n  go to their homes, with such security for their peaceable conduct as\r\n  the chief-commissioner may think proper to require.\r\n\r\n  ‘13. One obvious security will be that of making it clearly\r\n  understood by them, that the amount of favour which they shall\r\n  hereafter receive, and the condition in which they shall be\r\n  re-established, will be in part dependent upon their conduct after\r\n  dismissal.\r\n\r\n  ‘14. The permission to return to their homes must not be considered\r\n  as a reinstatement of them in the possession of their lands, for the\r\n  deliberate disposal of which the government will preserve itself\r\n  unfettered.\r\n\r\n  ‘15. There will probably be a third class, less compromised by acts\r\n  of past hostility to the government, in whom the chief-commissioner\r\n  may see reason to repose enough of confidence to justify their\r\n  services being at once enlisted on the side of order, towards the\r\n  maintenance of which in their respective districts they might be\r\n  called upon to organise a temporary police.\r\n\r\n  ‘16. The foregoing remarks apply to the thalookdars and chiefs of\r\n  the province. As regards their followers who may make submission\r\n  with them, these, from their numbers, must of necessity be dismissed\r\n  to their homes. But before this is done, their names and places of\r\n  residence should be registered, and they should receive a warning\r\n  that any disturbance of the peace or resistance of authority which\r\n  may occur in their neighbourhood, will be visited, not upon the\r\n  individual offenders alone, but by heavy fines upon the villages.\r\n\r\n  ‘17. I am to observe that the governor-general wishes the\r\n  chief-commissioner to consider what has been above written as\r\n  suggestions rather than instructions, and as indicating generally\r\n  the spirit in which his lordship desires that the proclamation\r\n  should be followed up, without tying down the action of the\r\n  chief-commissioner in matters which may have to be judged under\r\n  circumstances which cannot be foreseen.\r\n\r\n  ‘18. There remains one more point for notice.\r\n\r\n  ‘19. The proclamation is addressed to the chiefs and inhabitants of\r\n  Oude, not to mutineers.\r\n\r\n  ‘20. To the latter, the governor-general does not intend that any\r\n  overture should be made at present.\r\n\r\n  ‘21. But it is possible that some may surrender themselves, or seek\r\n  terms, and it is necessary that the chief-commissioner should be\r\n  prepared to meet any advances from them.\r\n\r\n  ‘22. The sole promise which can be given to any mutineer is, that\r\n  his life shall be spared; and this promise must not be made if the\r\n  man belongs to a regiment which has murdered its officers, or if\r\n  there be other _primâ facie_ reason to suppose that he has been\r\n  implicated in any specially atrocious crime. Beyond the guarantee of\r\n  life to those who, not coming within the above-stated exception,\r\n  shall surrender themselves, the governor-general cannot sanction the\r\n  giving of any specific pledge.\r\n\r\n  ‘23. Voluntary submission will be counted in mitigation of\r\n  punishment, but nothing must be said to those who so submit\r\n  themselves which shall bar the government from awarding to each such\r\n  measure of secondary punishment as in its justice it may deem\r\n  fitting.—I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n                                           (Signed) ‘G.

Many who owed their prosperity to the British government, as\r\n  well as those who believed themselves aggrieved by it, have joined\r\n  in this bad cause, and have ranged themselves with the enemies of\r\n  the state.\r\n\r\n  ‘They have been guilty of a great crime, and have subjected\r\n  themselves to a just retribution.\r\n\r\n  ‘The capital of their country is now once more in the hands of the\r\n  British troops.\r\n\r\n  ‘From this day it will be held by a force which nothing can\r\n  withstand, and the authority of the government will be carried into\r\n  every corner of the province.\r\n\r\n  ‘The time, then, has come at which the Right Honourable the\r\n  Governor-general of India deems it right to make known the mode in\r\n  which the British government will deal with the thalookdars, chiefs,\r\n  and landholders of Oude, and their followers.\r\n\r\n  ‘The first care of the governor-general will be to reward those who\r\n  have been steadfast in their allegiance at a time when the authority\r\n  of the government was partially overborne, and who have proved this\r\n  by the support and assistance which they have given to British\r\n  officers.\r\n\r\n  ‘Therefore the Right Honourable the Governor-general hereby declares\r\n  that\r\n\r\n    ‘Drigliejjie Singh, Rajah of Bulrampore;\r\n    ‘Koolwunt Singh, Rajah of Pudnaha;\r\n    ‘Rao Hurdeo Buksh Singh, of Kutiaree;\r\n    ‘Kasheepershaud, Thalookdar of Sissaindee;\r\n    ‘Zuhr Singh, Zemindar of Gopaul Kheir; and\r\n    ‘Chundeeloll, Zemindar of Moraon (Baiswarah),\r\n\r\n  are henceforward the sole hereditary proprietors of the lands which\r\n  they held when Oude came under British rule, subject only to such\r\n  moderate assessment as may be imposed upon them, and that those\r\n  loyal men will be further rewarded in such manner and to such extent\r\n  as, upon consideration of their merits and their position, the\r\n  governor-general shall determine.\r\n\r\n  ‘A proportionate measure of reward and honour, according to their\r\n  deserts, will be conferred upon others in whose favour like claims\r\n  may be established to the satisfaction of the government.\r\n\r\n  ‘The governor-general further proclaims to the people of Oude that,\r\n  with the above-mentioned exceptions, the proprietary right in the\r\n  soil of the province is confiscated to the British government, which\r\n  will dispose of that right in such manner as it may seem fitting.\r\n\r\n  ‘To those thalookdars, chiefs, and landholders, with their\r\n  followers, who shall make immediate submission to the\r\n  chief-commissioner of Oude, surrendering their arms and obeying his\r\n  orders, the Right Honourable the Governor-general promises that\r\n  their lives and honour shall be safe, provided that their hands are\r\n  unstained with English blood murderously shed.\r\n\r\n  ‘But, as regards any further indulgence which may be extended to\r\n  them, and the condition in which they may hereafter be placed, they\r\n  must throw themselves upon the justice and mercy of the British\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  ‘To those among them who shall promptly come forward and give to the\r\n  chief-commissioner their support in the restoration of peace and\r\n  order, this indulgence will be large, and the governor-general will\r\n  be ready to view liberally the claims which they may thus acquire to\r\n  the restitution of their former rights.\r\n\r\n  ‘As participation in the murder of Englishmen and Englishwomen will\r\n  exclude those who are guilty of it from all mercy, so will those who\r\n  have protected English lives be specially entitled to consideration\r\n  and leniency.\r\n\r\n  ‘By order of the Right Honourable the Governor-general of India.\r\n\r\n                                          ‘G. F. EDMONSTONE,\r\n                              _Secretary to the Government of India_.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   C.\r\n\r\n  Sir James Outram, not fully satisfied with this proclamation,\r\n  directed his secretary, Mr Couper, to write as follows to Mr\r\n  Edmonstone:\r\n\r\n                                      ‘CAMP, CHIMLUT, _March 8, 1858_.\r\n\r\n  ‘SIR—I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No.\r\n  191, dated 3d inst., enclosing a proclamation to be issued to the\r\n  landholders, chiefs, and inhabitants of Oude, upon the fall of the\r\n  capital.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. In this proclamation a hereditary title in their estates is\r\n  promised to such landholders as have been steadfast in their\r\n  allegiance, and, with these exceptions, the proprietary right in the\r\n  soil of the province is confiscated.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. The chief-commissioner desires me to observe that, in his\r\n  belief, there are not a dozen landowners in the province who have\r\n  not themselves borne arms against us, or sent a representative to\r\n  the durbar, or assisted the rebel government with men or money. The\r\n  effect of the proclamation, therefore, will be to confiscate the\r\n  entire proprietary right in the soil; and this being the case, it\r\n  is, of course, hopeless to attempt to enlist the landowners on the\r\n  side of order; on the contrary, it is the chief-commissioner’s firm\r\n  conviction that as soon as the chiefs and thalookdars become\r\n  acquainted with the determination of the government to confiscate\r\n  their rights, they will betake themselves at once to their domains,\r\n  and prepare for a desperate and prolonged resistance.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. The chief-commissioner deems this matter of such vital\r\n  importance, that, at the risk of being deemed importunate, he\r\n  ventures to submit his views once more, in the hope that the Right\r\n  Hon. the Governor-general may yet be induced to reconsider the\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. He is of opinion that the landholders were most unjustly treated\r\n  under our settlement operations, and even had they not been so, that\r\n  it would have required a degree of fidelity on their part quite\r\n  foreign to the usual character of an Asiatic, to have remained\r\n  faithful to our government under the shocks to which it was exposed\r\n  in Oude. In fact, it was not until our rule was virtually at an end,\r\n  the whole country overrun, and the capital in the hands of the rebel\r\n  soldiery, that the thalookdars, smarting as they were under the loss\r\n  of their lands, sided against us. The chief-commissioner thinks,\r\n  therefore, that they ought hardly to be considered as rebels, but\r\n  rather as honourable enemies, to whom terms, such as they could\r\n  without loss of dignity accept, should be offered at the termination\r\n  of the campaign.\r\n\r\n  ‘If these men be given back their lands, they will at once aid us in\r\n  restoring order; and a police will soon be organised with their\r\n  co-operation, which will render unnecessary the presence of our\r\n  enormous army to re-establish tranquillity and confidence.\r\n\r\n  ‘But, if their life and freedom from imprisonment only be offered,\r\n  they will resist; and the chief-commissioner foresees that we are\r\n  only at the commencement of a guerrilla war for the extirpation,\r\n  root and branch, of this class of men, which will involve the loss\r\n  of thousands of Europeans by battle, disease, and exposure. It must\r\n  be borne in mind that this species of warfare has always been\r\n  peculiarly harassing to our Indian forces, and will be far more so\r\n  at present, when we are without a native army.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. For the above reasons, the chief-commissioner earnestly requests\r\n  that such landholders and chiefs as have not been accomplices in the\r\n  cold-blooded murder of Europeans may be enlisted on our side by the\r\n  restoration of their ancient possessions, subject to such\r\n  restrictions as will protect their dependents from oppression. If\r\n  his lordship agree to this proposition, it will not yet be too late\r\n  to communicate his assent by electric telegraph before the fall of\r\n  the city, which will probably not take place for some days. Should\r\n  no such communication be received, the chief-commissioner will act\r\n  upon his present instructions, satisfied that he has done all in his\r\n  power to convince his lordship that they will be ineffectual to\r\n  re-establish our rule on a firm basis in Oude.—I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n                               (Signed)        ‘G.

Birch, and it will\r\n  receive a detailed reply in due course.\r\n\r\n  ‘Meanwhile, I am desired by the Right Honourable the\r\n  Governor-general to subjoin a clause which may be inserted in the\r\n  proclamation (forwarded with my letter, No. 191, of the 3d instant),\r\n  after the paragraph which ends with the words, “justice and mercy of\r\n  the British government.”\r\n\r\n  ‘“To those amongst them who shall promptly come forward, and give to\r\n  the chief-commissioner their support in the restoration of peace and\r\n  order, this indulgence will be large, and the governor-general will\r\n  be ready to view liberally the claims which they may thus acquire to\r\n  a restitution of their former rights.”\r\n\r\n  ‘2. This clause will add little or nothing to your discretionary\r\n  power, but it may serve to indicate more clearly to the thalookdars\r\n  the liberal spirit in which the governor-general is prepared to\r\n  review and reciprocate any advances on their part.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. It is expected that you will find means to translate this\r\n  additional clause into the vernacular languages, and that you will\r\n  be able to have copies of the proclamation, so amended, prepared in\r\n  sufficient numbers for immediate use. If more should be required,\r\n  the magistrate of Cawnpore will lithograph them on your requisition.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. It is very important, as you will readily see, that every copy\r\n  of the vernacular version of the proclamation sent to you, with my\r\n  letter of the 3d instant, should be carefully destroyed.—I have,\r\n  &c.,\r\n\r\n                              (Signed) ‘G. F. EDMONSTONE,\r\n                            ‘_Secretary, Government of India, with the\r\n                                         Governor-general_.\r\n\r\n  ‘_Allahabad, March 10, 1858._’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   E.\r\n\r\n  It was not until after a lapse of three weeks that the promised\r\n  detailed reply was sent to Sir James Outram, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n                                         ‘ALLAHABAD, _March 31, 1858_.\r\n\r\n  ‘SIR—In replying at once on the 10th inst. to your secretary’s\r\n  letter of the 8th, in which you urged reasons against the issue of\r\n  the proclamation to the thalookdars and landholders of Oude, which\r\n  had been transmitted to you by the Right Hon. the Governor-general,\r\n  my answer was confined to communicating to you the addition which\r\n  his lordship was willing to make to that proclamation, without\r\n  entering into the general questions raised in your letter. The\r\n  governor-general desires me to express his hope that you will not\r\n  have supposed that the arguments adduced by you were not fully\r\n  weighed by him, or that your opinion upon a subject on which you are\r\n  so well entitled to offer one, has not been received with sincere\r\n  respect, although he was unable to concur in it.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. I am now directed by his lordship to explain the grounds upon\r\n  which the course advocated in your letter—namely, that such\r\n  landholders and chiefs as have not been accomplices in the\r\n  cold-blooded murder of Europeans should be enlisted on our side by\r\n  the restoration of their ancient possessions, subject to such\r\n  restrictions as will protect their dependents from oppression—is, in\r\n  the opinion of the governor-general, inadmissible.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. The governor-general entirely agrees with you in viewing the\r\n  thalookdars and landholders of Oude in a very different light from\r\n  that in which rebels in our old provinces are to be regarded. The\r\n  people of Oude had been subjects of the British government for\r\n  little more than one year when the mutinies broke out; they had\r\n  become so by no act of their own. By the introduction of our rule\r\n  many of the chiefs had suffered a loss of property, and all had\r\n  experienced a diminution of the importance and arbitrary power which\r\n  they had hitherto enjoyed; and it is no marvel that those amongst\r\n  them who had thus been losers should, when they saw our authority\r\n  dissolved, have hastened to shake off their new allegiance.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. The governor-general views these circumstances as a palliation\r\n  of acts of rebellion, even where hostility has been most active and\r\n  systematic. Accordingly, punishment by death or imprisonment is at\r\n  once put aside by the proclamation in the case of all who shall\r\n  submit themselves to the government, and who are not murderers; and\r\n  whilst confiscation of proprietary rights in the land is declared to\r\n  be the general penalty, the means of obtaining more or less of\r\n  exemption from it, and of establishing a claim to restitution of\r\n  rights, have been pointed out, and are within the reach of all\r\n  without injury to their honour. Nothing more is required for this\r\n  than that they should promptly tender their adhesion, and help to\r\n  maintain peace and order.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. The governor-general considers that the course thus taken is one\r\n  consistent with the dignity of the government, and abundantly\r\n  lenient. To have followed that which is suggested in your\r\n  secretary’s letter would, in his lordship’s opinion, have been to\r\n  treat the rebels not only as honourable enemies, but as enemies who\r\n  had won the day.\r\n\r\n  ‘In the course of the rebellion, most of the leaders in it, probably\r\n  all, have retaken to themselves the lands and villages of which they\r\n  were deprived, by the summary settlement which followed the\r\n  establishment of our government in Oude. If upon the capture of\r\n  Lucknow by the commander-in-chief, before our strength had been seen\r\n  or felt in the distant districts, and before any submission had been\r\n  received or invited from them, the rights of the rebel chiefs to all\r\n  their ancient possessions had been recognised by the government, it\r\n  is not possible that the act would not have been viewed as dictated\r\n  by fear or weakness. It would have led the people of Oude, and all\r\n  who are watching the course of events in that province, to the\r\n  conclusion that rebellion against the British government cannot be a\r\n  losing game; and although it might have purchased an immediate\r\n  return to order, it would not assuredly have placed the future peace\r\n  of the province upon a secure foundation.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. You observe, indeed, that the landholders were most unjustly\r\n  treated under our settlement. The governor-general desires me to\r\n  observe that if this were unreservedly the case, or if the\r\n  proceedings of the commissioners by which many of the thalookdars\r\n  were deprived of portions of their possessions had been generally\r\n  unjust, he would gladly have concurred in your recommendation, and\r\n  would have been ready, at the risk of any misinterpretation of the\r\n  motives of the government, to reinstate the thalookdars at once in\r\n  their old possessions. But it is not so. As a question of policy,\r\n  indeed, the governor-general considers that it may well be doubted\r\n  whether the attempt to introduce into Oude a system of village\r\n  settlement in place of the old settlement under thalookdars was a\r\n  wise one; but this is a point which need not be discussed here. As a\r\n  question of justice, it is certain that the land and villages taken\r\n  from the thalookdars had, for the most part, been usurped by them\r\n  through fraud or violence.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. That unjust decisions were come to by some of our local officers\r\n  in investigating and judging the titles of the landowners is, the\r\n  governor-general fears, too true; but the proper way of rectifying\r\n  such injustice is by a re-hearing where complaint is made. This, you\r\n  are aware, is the course which the governor-general is prepared to\r\n  adopt, and to carry out in a liberal and conciliatory spirit. It is\r\n  a very different one from proclaiming that indiscriminate\r\n  restitution of all their ancient possessions is at once to be\r\n  yielded to the landowners.\r\n\r\n  ‘8. That the hostility of the thalookdars of Oude who have been most\r\n  active against the British government has been provoked, or is\r\n  excused, by the injustice with which they have been treated, would\r\n  seem to be your opinion.\r\n\r\n  ‘But I am to observe, that there are some facts which deserve to be\r\n  weighed before pronouncing that this is the case.\r\n\r\n  ‘9. No chiefs have been more open in their rebellion than the rajahs\r\n  of Churda, Bhinga, and Gonda. The governor-general believes that the\r\n  first of these did not lose a single village by the summary\r\n  settlement, and certainly his assessment was materially reduced. The\r\n  second was dealt with in a like liberal manner. The Rajah of Gonda\r\n  lost about 30 villages out of 400; but his assessment was lowered by\r\n  some 10,000 rupees.\r\n\r\n  ‘10. No one was more benefited by the change of government than the\r\n  young Rajah of Naupara. His estates had been the object of a civil\r\n  war with a rival claimant for three years, and of these he was at\r\n  once recognised as sole proprietor by the British government, losing\r\n  only six villages out of more than a thousand. His mother was\r\n  appointed guardian, but her troops have been fighting against us at\r\n  Lucknow from the beginning.\r\n\r\n  ‘11. The Rajah of Dhowrera, also a minor, was treated with equal\r\n  liberality. Every village was settled with his family; yet these\r\n  people turned upon Captain Hearsey and his party, refused them\r\n  shelter, pursued them, captured the ladies, and sent them into\r\n  Lucknow.\r\n\r\n  ‘12. Ushruf Bux Khan, a large thalookdar in Gonda, who had long been\r\n  an object of persecution by the late government, was established in\r\n  the possession of all his property by us; yet he has been strongly\r\n  hostile.\r\n\r\n  ‘13. It is clear that injustice at the hands of the British\r\n  government has not been the cause of the hostility which, in these\r\n  instances at least, has been displayed towards our rule.\r\n\r\n  ‘14. The moving spirit of these men and of others amongst the chiefs\r\n  of Oude must be looked for elsewhere; and, in the opinion of the\r\n  governor-general, it is to be found mainly in the repugnance which\r\n  they feel to suffer any restraint of their hitherto arbitrary powers\r\n  over those about them, to a diminution of their importance by being\r\n  brought under equal laws, and to the obligation of disbanding their\r\n  armed followers, and of living a peaceful and orderly life.\r\n\r\n  ‘The penalty of confiscation of property is no more than a just one\r\n  in such cases as have been above recited; and although\r\n  considerations of policy and mercy, and the newness of our rule,\r\n  prescribe a relaxation of the sentence more or less large according\r\n  to the features of each case, this relaxation must be preceded by\r\n  submission, and the governor-general cannot consent to offer all,\r\n  without distinction, an entire exemption from penalty, and the\r\n  restoration of all former possessions, even though they should not\r\n  have been guilty of the murder of Europeans.—I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n                       (Signed)         ‘G. F. EDMONSTONE,\r\n                               ‘_Secretary to the Government of India,\r\n                                     with the Governor-general_.\r\n\r\n  ‘_Allahabad, March 31, 1858._’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   F.\r\n\r\n  The following document, though not pertaining to the affairs of\r\n  Oude, may usefully be given here, bearing as it does on the\r\n  treatment proposed to be adopted towards mutineers and rebels. It\r\n  was written, in the name of Viscount Canning, by the secretary to\r\n  the government of the Northwest Provinces, and was addressed to the\r\n  functionaries of the disturbed province of Rohilcund:\r\n\r\n                                              ‘AGRA, _April 28, 1858_.\r\n\r\n  ‘SIR—I am directed to communicate to you the general principles\r\n  which the Right Honourable the Governor-general desires to see\r\n  followed by all civil and other officers who will exercise judicial\r\n  or magisterial powers in Rohilcund, on the re-entry of British\r\n  troops into that province.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. The condition of Rohilcund has been, in some respects, peculiar.\r\n  The progress of the Revolt in the interior has until lately suffered\r\n  little check. The people, left to themselves, have in many quarters\r\n  engaged actively in hostilities against each other; but direct\r\n  opposition to British authority has been mainly confined to the\r\n  several Sudder towns, to the frontier on the Ganges, and to the\r\n  expeditions against Nynee Tal.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. Under these circumstances, his lordship considers it just to\r\n  distinguish, by a widely differing treatment, the simple bearing of\r\n  arms, or even acts of social violence committed at a period when the\r\n  check of lawful government was removed, from acts directly involving\r\n  treason against the state, or a deliberate defiance of its\r\n  authority. Excepting instances of much aggravation, it is not the\r\n  wish of government that public prosecutions should be set on foot on\r\n  account of offences of the former class.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. Further, in respect of treason and defiance of British\r\n  authority, his lordship desires that criminal proceedings shall be\r\n  taken only against leaders, and against such persons, whether high\r\n  or low, as have distinguished themselves by activity and rancour\r\n  against the government, or by persistence in opposition to its\r\n  authority after the advance of troops and the re-occupation of\r\n  stations. The governor-general will admit to amnesty all other\r\n  classes, even though they have borne arms on the side of the rebels,\r\n  provided that they tender an early and complete submission. But\r\n  continuance in opposition will exclude from pardon.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. The governor-general has reason to believe that an impression\r\n  exists in Rohilcund that the Mohammedan population, as such, is to\r\n  be proscribed and crushed. It is likely that the rumour has been\r\n  raised and fostered by the rebel leaders to excite apprehension and\r\n  mistrust of the government. His lordship desires that every\r\n  appropriate occasion may be taken to disabuse the people of this\r\n  gross error. Such suspected rebels as may be brought to trial will\r\n  be tried each by his own acts. Each will stand or fall by the line\r\n  of conduct which he shall be proved to have followed. The government\r\n  will maintain, as it has always maintained, a strict impartiality in\r\n  its administration. Equal justice will be shared by all its\r\n  subjects, whether Hindoos or Mohammedans. You will make public these\r\n  views, and instruct the chief district officers to make them widely\r\n  known, in such manner as may appear to be most effectual.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. It will be your care, in accordance with the injunctions of\r\n  his lordship’s orders, embodied in the circular order dated the\r\n  19th February, to bring forward, for early notice by the\r\n  governor-general, the several examples of conspicuously faithful\r\n  conduct exhibited by many of the inhabitants of Rohilcund, under\r\n  circumstances of peculiar difficulty.—I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n                                                      ‘W. MUIR,\r\n                                              ‘_Sec. to Govt. NW. P._’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   G.\r\n\r\n  We now transfer attention to four of the documents written in\r\n  London. The first was nominally from the ‘Secret Committee,’ really\r\n  from the Earl of Ellenborough, and was suggested by the state of\r\n  affairs in India during the second half of the month of February:\r\n\r\n   ‘_The Secret Committee of the Court of Directors of the East India\r\n    Company, to the Governor-general of India in Council, March 24,\r\n                                 1858._\r\n\r\n  ‘The telegram from Calcutta, dated the 22d ult., which arrived this\r\n  morning, conveys intelligence of the concentration of the force\r\n  under the commander-in-chief, and of that under Jung Bahadoor, upon\r\n  Lucknow; and we trust we may indulge the expectation that, ere this,\r\n  that city has been evacuated by the rebels, and that no considerable\r\n  corps remains united against us in the field.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. If this happy result should have been attained, it will be very\r\n  satisfactory to us to learn that you have deemed yourselves\r\n  sufficiently strong to be enabled to act towards the people with the\r\n  generosity, as well as the justice, which are congenial to the\r\n  British character.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. Crimes have been committed against us which it would be a crime\r\n  to forgive; and some large exceptions there must be, of the persons\r\n  guilty of such crimes, from any act of amnesty which could be\r\n  granted; but it must be as impossible, as it would be abhorrent from\r\n  our feelings, to inflict the extreme penalty which the law might\r\n  strictly award upon all who have swerved from their allegiance.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. To us it appears that, whenever open resistance shall have\r\n  ceased, it would be prudent, in awarding punishment, rather to\r\n  follow the practice which prevails after the conquest of a country\r\n  which has defended itself to the last by desperate war, than that\r\n  which may perhaps be lawfully adopted after the suppression of\r\n  mutiny and rebellion, such acts always being excepted from\r\n  forgiveness or mitigation of punishment as have exceeded the licence\r\n  of legitimate hostilities.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. While we may be unable to forget the insanity which, during the\r\n  last ten months, has pervaded the army and a large portion of the\r\n  people, we should at the same time remember the previous fidelity of\r\n  a hundred years, and so conduct ourselves towards those who have\r\n  erred as to remove their delusions and their fears, and\r\n  re-establish, if we can, that confidence which was so long the\r\n  foundation of our power.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. It would be desirable that, in every case, the disarming of a\r\n  district, either by the seizure of arms or by their surrender,\r\n  should precede the application to it of any amnesty; but there may\r\n  be circumstances which would render expedient a different course of\r\n  proceeding. Upon these exceptional cases, you and the officers\r\n  acting under your orders must decide.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. The disarming of a district having been effected, with\r\n  exceptions, under your licence, in favour of native gentlemen, whose\r\n  feelings of honour would be affected by being deprived of the\r\n  privilege of wearing arms, and of any other persons in whom you may\r\n  confide, we think the possession of arms should be punished in every\r\n  case by a severe penalty; but unless the possession of arms should\r\n  be combined with other acts, leading to the conclusion that they\r\n  were retained for the perpetration of crimes, that penalty should\r\n  not be death. Of course the possession of arms by Englishmen must\r\n  always remain lawful.\r\n\r\n  ‘8. Death has of late been but too common a punishment. It loses\r\n  whatever terror it might otherwise have when so indiscriminately\r\n  applied; but, in fact, in India there is not commonly a fear of\r\n  death, although there ever must be a fear of pain.\r\n\r\n  ‘9. In every amnestied district, the ordinary administration of the\r\n  law should as soon as possible be restored.\r\n\r\n  ‘10. In carrying these views into execution, you may meet with\r\n  obstruction from those who, maddened by the scenes they have\r\n  witnessed, may desire to substitute their own policy for that of the\r\n  government; but persevere firmly in doing what you may think right;\r\n  make those who would counteract you feel that you are resolved to\r\n  rule, and that you will be served by none who will not obey.\r\n\r\n  ‘11. Acting in this spirit, you may rely upon our unqualified\r\n  support.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   H.\r\n\r\n  Three or four weeks afterwards, was written the ‘secret dispatch’\r\n  which gave rise to so vehement a debate in parliament:\r\n\r\n                                                    ‘_April 19, 1858._\r\n\r\n  ‘Our letter of the 24th of March 1858 will have put you in\r\n  possession of our general views with respect to the treatment of the\r\n  people in the event of the evacuation of Lucknow by the enemy.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. On the 12th inst., we received from you a copy of the letter,\r\n  dated the 3d of March, addressed by your secretary to the secretary\r\n  to the chief-commissioner in Oude, which letter enclosed a copy of\r\n  the proclamation to be issued by the chief-commissioner as soon as\r\n  the British troops should have command of the city of Lucknow, and\r\n  conveyed instructions as to the manner in which he was to act with\r\n  respect to different classes of persons, in execution of the views\r\n  of the governor-general.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. The people of Oude will see only the proclamation.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. That authoritative expression of the will of the government\r\n  informs the people that six persons, who are named as having been\r\n  steadfast in their allegiance, are henceforward the sole hereditary\r\n  proprietors of the lands they held when Oude came under British\r\n  rule, subject only to such moderate assessment as may be imposed\r\n  upon them; that others in whose favour like claims may be\r\n  established will have conferred upon them a proportionate measure of\r\n  reward and honour; and that, with these exceptions, the proprietary\r\n  right in the soil of the province is confiscated to the British\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. We cannot but express to you our apprehension that this decree,\r\n  pronouncing the disinherison of a people, will throw difficulties\r\n  almost insurmountable in the way of the re-establishment of peace.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. We are under the impression that the war in Oude has derived\r\n  much of its popular character from the rigorous manner in which,\r\n  without regard to what the chief landholders had become accustomed\r\n  to consider as their rights, the summary settlement had, in a large\r\n  portion of the province, been carried out by your officers.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. The landholders of India are as much attached to the soil\r\n  occupied by their ancestors, and are as sensitive with respect to\r\n  the rights in the soil they deem themselves to possess, as the\r\n  occupiers of land in any country of which we have a knowledge.\r\n\r\n  ‘8. Whatever may be your ultimate and undisclosed intentions, your\r\n  proclamation will appear to deprive the great body of the people of\r\n  all hope upon the subject most dear to them as individuals, while\r\n  the substitution of our rule for that of their native sovereign has\r\n  naturally excited against us whatever they may have of national\r\n  feeling.\r\n\r\n  ‘9. We cannot but in justice consider that those who resist our\r\n  authority in Oude are under very different circumstances from those\r\n  who have acted against us in provinces which have been long under\r\n  our government.\r\n\r\n  ‘10. We dethroned the King of Oude, and took possession of his\r\n  kingdom, by virtue of a treaty which had been subsequently modified\r\n  by another treaty, under which, had it been held to be in force, the\r\n  course we adopted could not have been lawfully pursued; but we held\r\n  that it was not in force, although the fact of its not having been\r\n  ratified in England, as regarded the provision on which we rely for\r\n  our justification, had not been previously made known to the King of\r\n  Oude.\r\n\r\n  ‘11. That sovereign and his ancestors had been uniformly faithful to\r\n  their treaty engagements with us, however ill they may have governed\r\n  their subjects.\r\n\r\n  ‘12. They had more than once assisted us in our difficulties, and\r\n  not a suspicion had ever been entertained of any hostile disposition\r\n  on their part towards our government.\r\n\r\n  ‘13. Suddenly the people saw their king taken from amongst them, and\r\n  our administration substituted for his, which, however bad, was at\r\n  least native; and this sudden change of government was immediately\r\n  followed by a summary settlement of the revenue, which, in a very\r\n  considerable portion of the province, deprived the most influential\r\n  landholders of what they deemed to be their property—of what\r\n  certainly had long given wealth, and distinction, and power to their\r\n  families.\r\n\r\n  ‘14. We must admit that, under these circumstances, the hostilities\r\n  which have been carried on in Oude have rather the character of\r\n  legitimate war than that of rebellion, and that the people of Oude\r\n  should rather be regarded with indulgent consideration, than made\r\n  the objects of a penalty exceeding in extent and in severity almost\r\n  any which has been recorded in history as inflicted upon a subdued\r\n  nation.\r\n\r\n  ‘15. Other conquerors, when they have succeeded in overcoming\r\n  resistance, have excepted a few persons as still deserving of\r\n  punishment, but have, with a generous policy, extended their\r\n  clemency to the great body of the people.\r\n\r\n  ‘16. You have acted upon a different principle. You have reserved a\r\n  few as deserving of special favour, and you have struck with what\r\n  they will feel as the severest of punishment the mass of the\r\n  inhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\n  ‘17. We cannot but think that the precedents from whom you have\r\n  departed will appear to have been conceived in a spirit of wisdom\r\n  superior to that which appears in the precedent you have made.\r\n\r\n  ‘18. We desire that you will mitigate in practice the stringent\r\n  severity of the decree of confiscation you have issued against the\r\n  landholders of Oude.\r\n\r\n  ‘19. We desire to see British authority in India rest upon the\r\n  willing obedience of a contented people; there cannot be contentment\r\n  where there is general confiscation.\r\n\r\n  ‘20. Government cannot long be maintained by any force in a country\r\n  where the whole people is rendered hostile by a sense of wrong; and\r\n  if it were possible so to maintain it, it would not be a\r\n  consummation to be desired.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\n  The Court of Directors, before the secret dispatch became known to\r\n  them, adopted courteous language in the following letter of\r\n  instructions sent to Viscount Canning, referring to an earlier\r\n  communication:\r\n\r\n                                                       ‘_May 5, 1858._\r\n\r\n  ‘1. You will have received, by the mail of the 25th of March, a\r\n  letter from the secret committee, which has since been laid before\r\n  us, respecting the policy which it becomes you to pursue towards\r\n  those natives of India who have recently been in arms against the\r\n  authority of the British government.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. That letter emphatically confirms the principles which you have\r\n  already adopted, as set forth in your circular of the 31st of July\r\n  1857, by impressing upon you the propriety of pursuing, after the\r\n  conquest of the revolted provinces, a course of policy distinguished\r\n  by a wise and discriminating generosity. You are exhorted to temper\r\n  justice with mercy, and, except in cases of extreme criminality, to\r\n  grant an amnesty to the vanquished. In the sentiments expressed by\r\n  the secret committee we entirely concur. While there are some crimes\r\n  which humanity calls upon you to punish with the utmost severity,\r\n  there are others of a less aggravated character, which it would be\r\n  equally unjust and impolitic not to pardon and to forget.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. The offences with which you will be called upon to deal are of\r\n  three different kinds. Firstly, high crimes, instigated by malice\r\n  prepense, and aggravated by treachery and cruelty. Secondly,\r\n  offences the results rather of weakness than of malice, into which\r\n  it is believed that many have been drawn by the contamination of\r\n  example, by the fear of opposing themselves to their more powerful\r\n  countrymen, or by the belief that they have been compromised by the\r\n  acts of their associates, rather than by any active desire to\r\n  embarrass the existing government. And, thirdly, offences of a less\r\n  positive character, amounting to little more than passive connivance\r\n  at evil, or at most to the act of giving such assistance to the\r\n  rebels as, if not given, would have been forcibly extorted, and\r\n  which in many cases it would have been death to refuse to bodies of\r\n  licentious and exasperated mutineers.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. It is the first only of these offences, the perpetrators of\r\n  which, and their accomplices, it will be your duty to visit with the\r\n  severest penalty which you can inflict; and it is, happily, in such\r\n  cases of exceptional atrocity, that you will have the least\r\n  difficulty in proving both the commission of the offence and the\r\n  identity of the offender. In the other cases you might often be left\r\n  in doubt, not only of the extent of the offence committed, but of\r\n  its actual commission by the accused persons; and although we are\r\n  aware that the retribution which might be righteously inflicted upon\r\n  the guilty may be in some measure restricted by too much nicety of\r\n  specification, and that, in dealing with so large a mass of crime,\r\n  it is difficult to avoid the commission of some acts of individual\r\n  injustice, we may still express our desire that the utmost exertion\r\n  may be made to confine, within the smallest possible compass, these\r\n  cases of uncertain proof and dubious identity, even though your\r\n  retributary measures should thus fall short of what in strict\r\n  justice might be inflicted.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. As soon as you have suppressed the active hostility of the\r\n  enemy, your first care will be the restoration of public confidence.\r\n  It will be your privilege when the disorganised provinces shall no\r\n  longer be convulsed by intestine disorder, to set an example of\r\n  toleration and forbearance towards the subject people, and to\r\n  endeavour by every means consistent with the security of the British\r\n  empire in the east, to allay the irritation and suspicion, which, if\r\n  suffered to retain possession of the minds of the native and\r\n  European inhabitants of the country, will eventually lead to nothing\r\n  less calamitous than a war of races.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. In dealing with the people of Oude, you will doubtless be moved\r\n  by special considerations of justice and of policy. Throughout the\r\n  recent contest, we have ever regarded such of the inhabitants of\r\n  that country as—not being sepoys or pensioners of our own army—have\r\n  been in arms against us as an exceptional class. They cannot be\r\n  considered as traitors or even rebels, for they had not pledged\r\n  their fidelity to us, and they had scarcely become our subjects.\r\n  Many, by the introduction of a new system of government, had\r\n  necessarily been deprived of the maintenance they had latterly\r\n  enjoyed; and others feared that the speedy loss of their means of\r\n  subsistence must follow from the same course. It was natural that\r\n  such persons should avail themselves of the opportunity presented by\r\n  the distracted state of the country, to strike a blow for the\r\n  restoration of the native rule, under which the permitted\r\n  disorganisation of the country had so long been to them a source of\r\n  unlawful profit. Neither the disbanded soldiers of the late native\r\n  government, nor the great thalookdars and their retainers, were\r\n  under any obligation of fidelity to our government for benefits\r\n  conferred upon them. You would be justified, therefore, in dealing\r\n  with them as you would with a foreign enemy, and in ceasing to\r\n  consider them objects of punishment after they have once laid down\r\n  their arms.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. Of these arms they must for ever be deprived. You will\r\n  doubtless, in prosecution of this object, address yourself in the\r\n  first instance to the case of the great thalookdars, who so\r\n  successfully defied the late government, and many of whom, with\r\n  large bodies of armed men, appear to have aided the efforts of the\r\n  mutinous soldiery of the Bengal army. The destruction of the\r\n  fortified strongholds of these powerful landholders, the forfeiture\r\n  of their remaining guns, the disarming and disbanding of their\r\n  followers, will be amongst your first works. But, whilst you are\r\n  depriving this influential and once dangerous class of people of\r\n  their power of openly resisting your authority, you will, we have no\r\n  doubt, exert yourself by every possible means to reconcile them to\r\n  British rule, and encourage them, by liberal arrangements made in\r\n  accordance with ancient usages, to become industrious\r\n  agriculturists, and to employ in the cultivation of the soil the men\r\n  who, as armed retainers, have so long wasted the substance of their\r\n  masters and desolated the land. We believe that these landholders\r\n  may be taught that their holdings will be more profitable to them\r\n  under a strong government, capable of maintaining the peace of the\r\n  country, and severely punishing agrarian outrages, than under one\r\n  which perpetually invites, by its weakness, the ruinous arbitration\r\n  of the sword.\r\n\r\n  ‘8. Having thus endeavoured, on the re-establishment of the\r\n  authority of the British government in Oude, to reassure the great\r\n  landholders, you will proceed to consider, in the same spirit of\r\n  toleration and forbearance, the condition of the great body of the\r\n  people. You will bear in mind that it is necessary, in a transition\r\n  state from one government to another, to deal tenderly with existing\r\n  usages, and sometimes even with existing abuses. All precipitate\r\n  reforms are dangerous. It is often wiser even to tolerate evil for a\r\n  time, than to alarm and to irritate the minds of the people by the\r\n  sudden introduction of changes which time can alone teach them to\r\n  appreciate, or even, perhaps, to understand. You will be especially\r\n  careful, in the readjustment of the fiscal system of the province,\r\n  to avoid the imposition of unaccustomed taxes, whether of a general\r\n  or of a local character, pressing heavily upon the industrial\r\n  resources and affecting the daily comforts of the people. We do not\r\n  estimate the successful administration of a newly acquired province\r\n  according to the financial results of the first few years. At such a\r\n  time we should endeavour to conciliate the people by wise\r\n  concessions, and to do nothing to encourage the belief that the\r\n  British government is more covetous of revenue than the native ruler\r\n  whom it has supplanted.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   K.\r\n\r\n  The last document here given is a letter of instructions from the\r\n  Court of Directors, kind and courteous towards the governor-general,\r\n  but evidently conveying an opinion that the proposed proclamation,\r\n  unless modified and acted on with caution, would be too severe for\r\n  the purpose in view:\r\n\r\n                   ‘_Political Department, 18th of May (No. 20) 1858._\r\n\r\n  ‘1. The secret committee has communicated to us the\r\n  governor-general’s secret letter, dated 5th March (No. 9) 1858, with\r\n  its enclosures, consisting of a letter addressed to the\r\n  chief-commissioner of Oude, dated 3d of March, and of the\r\n  proclamation referred to therein, which was to be issued by Sir\r\n  James Outram to the chiefs and inhabitants of Oude as soon as the\r\n  British troops should have possession or command of the city of\r\n  Lucknow.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. We have also received communication of the letter addressed to\r\n  your government by the secret committee, under date the 19th of\r\n  April last, on the subject of the draft of proclamation.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. Our political letter of the 5th of May has apprised you of our\r\n  strong sense of the distinction which ought to be maintained between\r\n  the revolted sepoys and the chiefs and people of Oude, and the\r\n  comparative indulgence with which, equally from justice and policy,\r\n  the insurgents of that country (other than sepoys) ought to be\r\n  regarded. In accordance with these views, we entirely approve the\r\n  guarantee of life and honour given by the proposed proclamation to\r\n  all thalookdars, chiefs, and landholders, with their followers, who\r\n  should make immediate submission, surrender their arms, and obey the\r\n  orders of the British government, provided they have not\r\n  participated in the murder “of Englishmen or Englishwomen.”\r\n\r\n  ‘4. We are prepared to learn that in publicly declaring that, with\r\n  the exception of the lands of six persons who had been steadfast in\r\n  their allegiance, the proprietary right in the soil of the province\r\n  was confiscated to the British government, the governor-general\r\n  intended no more than to reserve to himself entire liberty of\r\n  action, and to give the character of mercy to the confirmation of\r\n  all rights not prejudicial to the public welfare, the owners of\r\n  which might not, by their conduct, have excluded themselves from\r\n  indulgent consideration.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. His lordship must have been well aware that the words of the\r\n  proclamation, without the comment on it which we trust was speedily\r\n  afforded by your actions, must have produced the expectation of much\r\n  more general and indiscriminate dispossession than could have been\r\n  consistent with justice or with policy. We shall doubtless be\r\n  informed, in due course, of the reasons which induced the\r\n  governor-general to employ those terms, and of the means which, we\r\n  presume, have been taken of making known in Oude the merciful\r\n  character which we assume must still belong to your views. In the\r\n  meantime, it is due to the governor-general that we should express\r\n  our entire reliance that on this, as on former occasions, it has\r\n  been his firm resolution to shew to all whose crimes are not too\r\n  great for any indulgence, the utmost degree of leniency consistent\r\n  with the early restoration and firm maintenance of lawful authority.\r\n\r\n  ‘We accordingly have to inform you, that on receiving communication\r\n  of the papers now acknowledged, the Court of Directors passed the\r\n  following resolution:\r\n\r\n  ‘“Resolved—That in reference to the dispatch from the secret\r\n  committee to the governor-general of India, dated the 19th ult.,\r\n  with the documents therein alluded to, and this day laid before the\r\n  Court of Directors, this court desires to express its continued\r\n  confidence in the governor-general, Lord Canning, and its conviction\r\n  that his measure for the pacification of Oude, and the other\r\n  disturbed districts in India, will be characterised by a generous\r\n  policy, and by the utmost clemency that is found to be consistent\r\n  with the satisfactory accomplishment of that important object.”—We\r\n  are, &c.\r\n\r\n                                (Signed)\r\n\r\n                                                       ‘F.

Much\r\ndisappointment was felt, too, in England, when necessity for such a\r\ncampaign became manifest. Persons in all ranks had fondly hoped that,\r\nwhen Sir Colin Campbell had spent two or three months in preparing for\r\nthe siege of Lucknow, he would be enabled so to invest that city as to\r\nrender the escape of the mutineers impossible; and that in conquering\r\nit, the heart of the rebellion would be crushed out. The result did not\r\nanswer to this expectation. Lucknow was conquered; but the prisoners\r\ntaken could be reckoned simply by dozens; nearly all the rebels who were\r\nnot killed escaped into the provinces. It is true that they were now a\r\ndispersed body instead of a concentrated army; but it is also true that,\r\nin abandoning Lucknow, they would retire to many towns and forts where\r\nguns could be found, and where a formidable stand might be made against\r\nBritish troops. Let the summer approach, and the ratio of advantages on\r\nthe two sides would be changed in character. Hot weather may affect the\r\nsepoy, but it affects him relatively less than the Englishman. It is\r\nheart-breaking work to a gallant soldier to feel his bodily strength\r\nfailing through heat, at a time when his spirit is as heroic as ever.\r\nThe rebels were astute enough to know this. The lithe Hindoo, with\r\nsupple limbs and no superfluous flesh, can make great marches—especially\r\nwhen he retreats. His goods and chattels are few in number; his\r\nhousehold arrangements simple; and it costs him little time or thought\r\nto shift his quarters at a short notice, in a period of peace. During\r\nwar or rebellion, when he becomes a soldier, his worldly position is\r\neven more simple than before. A man who can live upon rice, parched\r\ncorn, and water, and to whom it is a matter of much indifference whether\r\nhe is clothed or not, has a remarkable freedom of movement, requiring\r\nlittle intricacy of commissariat arrangements. The English, during the\r\nwar of the mutiny, had ample means of observing this mobility of the\r\nnative rebel troops, and ample reasons for lamenting its consequences.\r\nIf this were so during the winter, it would be still more decidedly the\r\ncase during a hot-weather campaign, when exhaustion and _coups de\r\nsoleil_ work so terribly on the European constitution. It was this\r\nconsideration, as we have said, that gave rise to much disappointment,\r\nboth in India and in England, when the real sequel of the siege of\r\nLucknow became apparent. The disappointment resolved itself in some\r\nquarters into adverse criticism on Sir Colin Campbell’s tactics; but\r\neven those who deemed it wise and just to postpone such criticism, could\r\nnot postpone their anxiety when they found that the rebels, fleeing from\r\nLucknow, assumed such an attitude elsewhere as would render a summer\r\ncampaign necessary.\r\n\r\nThe long sojourn of the commander-in-chief in and near the Oudian\r\ncapital, and the frequent communications between him and the\r\ngovernor-general, told of serious and weighty discussions concerning the\r\npolicy to be pursued. Rumours circulated of an antagonism of plans; of\r\none project for leaving the rebels unmolested until after the hot season\r\nshould have passed, and of another for crushing them in detail before\r\nthey could succeed in recombining. But whatever might have been the\r\nrumours, the policy adopted followed the latter of these two courses.\r\nThe army of Lucknow, broken up into divisions or columns, was set again\r\nto work, to pursue and defeat those insurgents who kept the field with a\r\npertinacity little expected when the mutiny began. So much of those\r\noperations as took place during the month of April, it is the purpose of\r\nthis chapter to narrate; but a few words may previously be said\r\nconcerning the state of affairs in Bengal, more dependent on Calcutta\r\nthan on the army of Oude or the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThe fact has already been adverted to that the supreme government, amid\r\nall the anxiety of the rebellion in the northwest, began in the spring\r\nof the year to take measures for the better protection of Lower Bengal.\r\nThat province, the most important in the whole of India, had been very\r\nlittle affected by the mutiny, chiefly because there were few Mohammedan\r\nleaders inclined to become rebels; but the authorities could not close\r\ntheir eyes to the facts that the province was very insufficiently\r\ndefended, and that any successful revolt there would be more disastrous\r\nthan in other regions. So long as the delta of the Ganges remained in\r\nBritish hands, there would always be a base of operations for\r\nreconquering Upper India, if necessary; but that delta once lost, the\r\nservices of a Clive, backed by a large army from England, would be again\r\nneeded to recover it. A plan was therefore formed for locating five or\r\nsix thousand European troops in Bengal, quartered at Calcutta, Dumdum,\r\nChinsura, Barrackpore, Dinapoor, Benares, and one or two other places.\r\nIt became very seriously contested whether any native army whatever\r\nwould be needed in the province. The Bengalees are peaceful, and have\r\nfew ambitious chieftains among them; hence, it was argued, a few\r\nthousand British troops, and a few hundred seamen of the Naval Brigade,\r\nwould suffice to protect the province. There were ‘divisional\r\nbattalions’ of native troops still at certain stations, as a sort of\r\nmilitary police; but the regular Bengal native army had been\r\nextinguished, or had extinguished itself. So useful had a few hundred\r\nseamen become, that their employment led to many such suggestions as the\r\nfollowing—‘Wherever these seamen are, there is a feeling of absolute\r\nsecurity at once from external attack and internal treachery. Bengal has\r\nnow been nearly twelve months without a native army, and within that\r\ntwelve months they have never once been missed. Why not retain this\r\nsecurity? Why not strike off Bengal from the provinces to be occupied by\r\na native force, and render our improvised force a permanent institution?\r\nA company of European sailors would be a nucleus for the armed police in\r\neach division. Why not keep them up as such, give them permanent\r\nallowances, recruit them primarily from the same useful class? There can\r\nbe no want of men when once such a permanent opening is known. They\r\nwould not only protect the great cities, and double the physical force\r\non which all authority must ultimately rest, but act as a permanent\r\ncheck on the divisional battalions. We want such a check. These men may\r\nbe as faithful as the sepoys have been false, as attached to Europeans\r\nas the sepoys have proved themselves hostile; but there can never be any\r\nproof of the fact. Let us not again trust armed natives without the\r\nprecautions we take in our ships against our own sailors—a check by a\r\ndifferent body.’ All such considerations necessarily resolved themselves\r\ninto a much larger inquiry, to be conducted deliberately and\r\ncautiously—how ought the army of India to be re-constituted?\r\n\r\nSemi-barbarous tribes in many instances took advantage of the disturbed\r\nstate of British influence in India, to make inroads into districts not\r\nproperly belonging to them; and it sometimes happened that the\r\ncorrection of these evildoers was a very difficult matter. Such an\r\ninstance occurred in the month now under notice. On the borders of\r\nAssam, at the extreme northeast corner of India, were a wild mountain\r\ntribe called Abors, who had for some time been engaged in a system of\r\nmarauding on the Assam side of the frontier. Captain Bivar, at\r\nDebrooghur, set forth to punish them, taking with him a mixed force of\r\nsailors and Goorkhas. The Abors retreated to their fastnesses, and Bivar\r\nattempted to follow them; but this was an unsuccessful manœuvre. The\r\nAbors brought down many of his men by poisoned arrows, and maimed others\r\nby rolling down stones upon them from the rocks; a portion of their\r\nnumbers, meanwhile, making a circuit, fell upon the baggage-boats, and\r\ncaptured the whole of the baggage. Captain Bivar and his companions\r\nsuffered many privations before they safely got back to Debrooghur.\r\nThese, however, were minor difficulties, involving no very serious\r\nconsequences. Throughout the northeast region of India there were few\r\n‘Pandies,’ few sepoys of Hindustani race; and thus the materials for\r\nrebellion were deprived of one very mischievous ingredient.\r\n\r\nThe Calcutta authorities found it necessary to make stringent rules\r\nconcerning ladies and children; and hence some of the magistrates and\r\ncollectors, the representatives of the Company in a civil capacity in\r\nthe country districts, were occasionally placed in troublesome\r\ncircumstances by family considerations during times of tumult. From the\r\nfirst, the Calcutta government had endeavoured, by every available\r\nmeans, to prevent women and children from going to the scenes of danger:\r\nknowing how seriously the movements of the officers, military and civil,\r\nwould be interfered with by the presence of helpless relatives during\r\nscenes of fighting and tumult. One of the magistrates, in Western\r\nBengal, was brought into difficulty by disobedience to this order. His\r\nwife entreated that she might come to him at his station. She did so.\r\nShortly afterwards a rumour spread that a large force of the enemy was\r\napproaching. The lady grew frightened, and the husband anxious. He took\r\nher to another place, and was thereby absent from his post at a critical\r\ntime. The government suspended him from office for disobeying orders in\r\nhaving his wife at the station, and for quitting his district without\r\nleave at a time when his presence was imperatively needed.\r\n\r\nOne other matter may be mentioned here, in connection with the local\r\ngovernment, before proceeding to the affairs of Oude and the northwest.\r\nThe Calcutta authorities shared with the Court of Directors, the English\r\ngovernment, and the House of Commons, the power of rewarding or\r\nhonouring their troops for good services; the modes adopted were many;\r\nbut amid the controversies which occasionally arose concerning military\r\nhonours, medals, promotions, and encomiums, it was made very manifest\r\nduring the wars of the mutiny that the Victoria Cross, the recognition\r\nof individual valour, was one of the most highly valued by the soldiery,\r\nboth officers and privates. The paltriness of the bits of metal and\r\nribbon, or the tastelessness of the design, might be abundantly\r\ncriticised; but when it became publicly known that the Cross would be\r\ngiven _only_ to those who had shewn themselves to be brave among the\r\nbrave, the value of the symbol was great, such as a soldier or sailor\r\ncould alone appreciate. From time to time notices appeared in the\r\n_London Gazette_, emanating from the War-office, giving the utmost\r\npublicity to the instances in which the Victoria Cross was bestowed. The\r\nname of the officer or soldier, the regiment or corps to which he\r\nbelonged, the commanding officer who had made the recommendation, the\r\ndispatch in which the deed of bravery was recorded, the date and place\r\nof that deed, the nature of the deed itself—all were briefly set forth;\r\nand there can be little doubt that the recipients of the Cross would\r\ncherish that memorial, and the _Gazette_ notice, to the end of their\r\nlives. Incidental notices of this honorary testimonial have been\r\nfrequently made in former chapters; and it is mentioned again here\r\nbecause of its importance in including officers and privates in the same\r\ncategory. Thus, on the 27th of April, to give one instance, the _London\r\nGazette_ announced the bestowal of the Victoria Cross on\r\nLieutenant-colonel Henry Tombs, of the Bengal artillery; Lieutenant\r\nJames Hills, of the same corps; Lieutenant William Alexander Kerr, of\r\nthe 24th Bombay native infantry; Sergeant John Smith, of the Bengal\r\nSappers and Miners; Bugler Robert Hawthorne, of the 52d foot;\r\nLance-corporal Henry Smith, of the same regiment; Sergeant Bernard\r\nDiamond, of the Bengal horse-artillery; and Gunner Richard Fitzgerald,\r\nof the same corps. Sergeant Smith and Bugler Hawthorne, it will be\r\nremembered, assisted poor Home, Salkeld, and Burgess in blowing up the\r\nCashmere Gate at Delhi; unlike their heroic but less fortunate\r\ncompanions, they lived to receive the Victoria Cross.[165]\r\n\r\nLet us now pass to the stormy northwest regions. Beginning with Lucknow\r\nas a centre, it will be convenient to treat of Sir Colin’s arrangements\r\nat that place, and then to notice in succession the operations of his\r\nbrigadiers in their movements radially from that centre, so far as they\r\nwere connected with the month of April.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the army which remained in Lucknow found the month of\r\nApril to open with a degree of heat very distressing to bear. A\r\ntemperature of 100° F., under the shade of a tent, was not at all\r\nunusual. When the wind was calm, the pressure of temperature was not\r\nmuch felt; but the blowing of a hot wind was truly terrible—not only\r\nfrom the heat itself, but from the clouds of dust laden with particles\r\nof matter of the most offensive kind. Every organ of sense, every nerve,\r\nevery pore, was distressed. And it was at such a time that a commander\r\nwas called upon to plan, and officers and soldiers to execute, military\r\noperations with as much care and exactitude as if under a cool and\r\ntemperate sky. There were putrefying bodies yet unburied in the\r\nvicinity, pools of recently dried blood in the streets and gardens, and\r\nabominations of every kind in this city of palaces: how these affected\r\nthe air, in a temperature higher than is ever known in England, may be\r\nimperfectly, and only imperfectly, conceived.[166]\r\n\r\nThe last chapter told in what way the treatment of the Oude rebels\r\nengaged the attention of the imperial legislature, and what were the\r\nviolent discussions to which that subject gave rise. In this place it\r\nwill only be necessary to state that, long before Viscount Canning\r\ncame to hear the views of the two Houses of Parliament, he found it\r\nnecessary to determine, if not the policy itself, at least the names\r\nof those who would have the onerous task of re-establishing civil\r\ngovernment in the distracted province. Mr Montgomery, who, as judicial\r\ncommissioner of the Punjaub, had rendered admirable service to Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence, was selected by the governor-general to fill the office\r\nof chief-commissioner of Oude—aided by a staff of judicial and\r\nfinancial commissioners, civil and military secretaries,\r\ndeputy-commissioners, commissioners of divisions, deputy-commissioners\r\nof districts, and other officers. It was believed that he combined the\r\nvaluable qualities of sagacity, experience, firmness, and\r\nconciliation. Oude was to be parcelled out into four divisions, and\r\neach division into three districts. The intention was, that as soon as\r\nany part of the province was brought into some degree of order by Sir\r\nColin and his brigadiers, Montgomery should take it in hand, and bring\r\nit to order in relation to judicial and revenue affairs. Large powers\r\nwere given to him, in relation to ‘proclamations’ and everything else;\r\nand it remained for time to shew the result.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, it may be well to advert to the conduct and\r\nposition of one particular native of Oude. During many months the line\r\nof policy pursued by the influential Oudian landowner, Rajah Maun\r\nSingh, was a subject of much anxiety among the British authorities.\r\nHis power in Oude was very considerable, and it was fondly hoped or\r\nwished that he might prove faithful in mutinous times. This hope was\r\nfounded on two kinds of evidence, positive and negative—proofs that he\r\nhad often befriended the poor European fugitives in the hour of\r\ngreatest need, and that on many occasions he had _not_ injured the\r\nBritish when he might easily have done so. Nevertheless it was\r\nimpossible to get rid of the impression that he was ‘playing fast and\r\nloose;’ reserving himself for whichever party should gain the\r\nascendency in the Indian struggle. So much importance was attached in\r\nEngland to this rajah’s conduct, that the House of Commons ordered the\r\nproduction of any documents that might throw light upon it. The papers\r\nproduced ranged over a period of six months. So early as June 1857,\r\nwhen the mutiny was only six or seven weeks old, Mr Tucker,\r\ncommissioner of Benares, wrote to Maun Singh concerning the relations\r\nbetween him and the British government—acknowledging the steadiness of\r\nthe rajah in maintaining the district of Fyzabad in a peaceful\r\ncondition, so far as he could, and assuring him that it would be good\r\npolicy for him to continue in the same path. He told him that although\r\nEngland was engaged in a war with China, and had only just concluded\r\none with Persia, and that moreover her Hindustani troops had proved\r\nfaithless, she would undoubtedly triumph over all opposition from\r\nwithin and without, and would equally remember those who had been true\r\nand those who had been false to her—to reward the one and punish the\r\nother. It was a letter of thanks for the past, and of warning for the\r\nfuture. During the same month, Maun Singh was in correspondence with\r\nMr Paterson, magistrate of Goruckpore, giving and receiving friendly\r\nassurances, and impressing the magistrate with a belief in his sincere\r\ndesire to remain faithful to the British government during a time of\r\ntrouble. In the middle of July he was in correspondence with Mr\r\nWingfield, British political agent with the Goorkha force at that time\r\nin the Goruckpore district. Maun Singh, it may here be remarked, had\r\nsuffered severely in his estate, by the land-settlement made when the\r\nCompany took possession of Oude; he had suffered, whether rightly or\r\nwrongly; and the Calcutta authorities were naturally anxious to know\r\nwhether his losses had converted him into a rebel. He wrote to Mr\r\nWingfield, promising to adhere faithfully to a course of friendliness\r\ntowards the English. Mr Wingfield recommended the government to trust\r\nMaun Singh, to supply him with a certain amount of funds, and to\r\nbelieve that he was able and willing to keep the districts of Fyzabad\r\nand Sultanpore tolerably free from anarchy. He added: ‘All I see and\r\nhear of Maun Singh makes me think him stanch up to this moment. He has\r\nexerted himself in every way to protect the women and children that\r\nwere left at Fyzabad, and to place them in safety. He sent four\r\nsergeants’ wives and seven children to this place; but we cannot\r\nexpect him to sacrifice himself for us. He has doubtless already made\r\nhimself obnoxious to the rebels by his open adhesion to our cause; and\r\nif fortune goes against us at Lucknow, instead of being able to render\r\nus any assistance, he will himself have to take shelter here.’ The\r\nCalcutta government authorised Mr Wingfield to thank Maun Singh for\r\nhis actions and his promises, and to assist him with money to a\r\ncertain prescribed amount. In August a letter was sent to the rajah\r\nhimself by the government, thanking him for what he had done, and\r\nurging him to a continuance in the same course. Many months\r\nafterwards, the Calcutta authorities had again to discuss this\r\nsubject. During the autumn, Maun Singh’s former promises had been a\r\ngood deal belied. He had been in and near Lucknow during the period\r\nwhen Havelock, Outram, and Campbell were engaged in warfare at that\r\ncity; and it was more than suspected that he had aided the insurgents.\r\nTrue, he was a man who, having something of the feelings of a\r\ngentleman, rather succoured than persecuted hapless fugitives who were\r\npowerless for aught save suffering; but his proceedings in other ways\r\nwere not satisfactory. When Outram commanded in the Residency, shut up\r\nwith Havelock and Inglis, he exchanged many communications with the\r\nrajah, but to no satisfactory end. During the winter, rumours reached\r\nMaun Singh that the governor-general, regarding him as a traitor in\r\nspite of his many promises, intended to deprive him of his estates, as\r\na punishment. He wrote a reproachful letter to Mr Brereton, the\r\nmagistrate at Goruckpore—complaining that this was a poor reward for\r\nhis services; that he went with his family to Lucknow because he was\r\nthreatened by insurgents at Fyzabad; but that throughout the various\r\nsieges at Lucknow he never joined the rebels in attacking the British.\r\nAmong various letters from the officials, were two which shewed that\r\nMr Wingfield had greatly modified his former favourable opinion of the\r\nFyzabad rajah. On the 2d of February he wrote: ‘Maun Singh is not the\r\nman to be selected as an object of clemency. He has not the excuse of\r\nhaving been hurried into insurrection by the force of example, the\r\nimpetuosity of his feelings, or even regard for his personal safety.\r\nHe withstood all these trials; for it was on mature reflection, and\r\nafter weighing all the chances on either side, that he chose that of\r\nrebellion. As long as he thought the success of the insurrection was\r\nbut transient, and that our government would speedily recover its\r\nposition, he professed loyalty, and even supported us; but when he\r\nheard that the Goorkhas were not to march through Fyzabad, and that\r\nHavelock had been obliged to abandon his design of relieving the\r\nResidency and to retire on Cawnpore, he thought our case hopeless, and\r\njoined what appeared the triumphant side. He has now found out his\r\nmistake, and wishes to turn again.’ Again, on the 12th of February Mr\r\nWingfield wrote: ‘On Maun Singh’s conduct I look with some distrust,\r\nwhich his letter does not tend to remove. Our Fyzabad news-writer,\r\nwhose information has invariably proved correct, reports that the\r\nrajah has had an interview with some of the sepoy officers, and agreed\r\nto their proposal to invade this (Goruckpore) district, and moved\r\nthree of his guns down to the Ghat. It would be quite consistent with\r\nhis known character for duplicity to infer that, while aiding the\r\ninsurgents, he is trying to keep well with us.’ The double-dealer had,\r\nindeed, his hands full of employment; for he had been sounding Sir\r\nJames Outram at the Alum Bagh, before he applied to the Goruckpore\r\nauthorities, at the very time that he had on hand some sort of\r\nnegotiation with the rebels. He succeeded so far as this—that no party\r\nliked absolutely to throw him off. Mr Wingfield, in writing to the\r\ngovernment, candidly admitted that, inscrutable and unreliable as Maun\r\nSingh was, matters would have gone worse for the British in Oude if he\r\nhad not been there. ‘It must be admitted that his neutrality up to the\r\npresent time has paralysed the plans of the insurgents, and has made\r\nhim the object of their indignation. Had he declared himself openly\r\nagainst us, the district of Goruckpore would long ago have been\r\ninvaded.’ On the 16th of February the governor-general sent orders\r\nfrom Allahabad, as to the mode in which any overtures from Maun Singh\r\nshould be received. He directed that the rajah should be thanked for\r\nthe humanity he had shewn towards individuals; reminded that strong\r\nsuspicions were entertained of his complicity with the rebels;\r\nthreatened with a full and searching inquiry into his past conduct;\r\nand recommended to submit himself—without any other conditions than a\r\npromise of his life and honour—to the British authorities. But Maun\r\nSingh did not follow this advice—he remained throughout the spring\r\nmonths balancing and trimming between loyalty and disloyalty.\r\n\r\nReverting to the state of affairs at Lucknow, it may here be observed\r\nthat the commander-in-chief remained in that city until the middle of\r\nApril. There was nothing Napoleonic, nothing rapid, in his movements\r\nafter the conquest; but those who knew him best knew that he was\r\norganising plans of operation for all his brigadiers, and on all sides\r\nof the Oudian capital. So thoroughly was he master of his own secrets,\r\nand of his correspondence with the governor-general, that very little\r\nconcerning his plans were known until the very day of operation. Even\r\nthe higher officers had little but conjecture to rest upon; while the\r\nmere retailers of gossip were sorely puzzled for materials. It may be\r\nthat the excessive publicity of the details of the Crimean war had\r\nrendered military authorities uneasy, and tended to render them chary of\r\ngiving information of their plans in any subsequent wars. During the\r\nsecond week in the month, Sir Colin Campbell took a rapid gallop to\r\nAllahabad—a long distance and a somewhat perilous ride in such a\r\ndisturbed state of the country; but he was not a man to care for\r\ndistance or for danger, as personally affecting himself. He had many\r\nweighty questions to settle with Viscount Canning; and as the\r\ngovernor-general could not or would not go to the commander, the\r\ncommander went to the governor-general. The result of the interview was\r\nthe departure of Sir Colin Campbell himself, as well as his generals,\r\nfor active service in districts distant from Lucknow.\r\n\r\nIt will be desirable to trace the movements of the generals and\r\nbrigadiers singly before noticing those of the commander-in-chief and\r\nhis head-quarters.\r\n\r\nAnd first, for Sir James Outram. This eminent man, the second in\r\ninfluence among the military commanders in India, quitted Lucknow nearly\r\nat the same time as many other officers; but on a different mission.\r\nWhen that city was conquered, Outram at once became supreme authority\r\nthere, as chief-commissioner of Oude. He collected round him a civil\r\nstaff, and proceeded to enrol a police, establish police-stations, and\r\nrestore order in the city. From these duties, however, he was summoned\r\naway. His services were needed at Calcutta. The supreme council in that\r\ncity generally contained one military officer among its members, to\r\nadvise on matters pertaining to war. General Low, who had for some time\r\nfilled that position, retired to England; and Outram was chosen to\r\nsupply his place. Personally, it was well that Sir James should quit the\r\ncamp for a while, after half a year’s incessant military employment in\r\nOude; and professionally, it was desirable that the council at Calcutta\r\nshould have the benefit of his assistance, in any plans for the\r\nreorganisation of the Indian army—a most important matter, towards which\r\nthe attention of the authorities was necessarily much directed. Sir\r\nJames did not forget his old companions-in-arms. As soon as he reached\r\nCalcutta, he gave orders that copies of one of the newspapers should be\r\nregularly sent to the hospitals of six of the British regiments at\r\nCawnpore, Meerut, Lucknow, and Benares; he knew how irksome are the\r\nhours in a sick-room, and how joyfully a few books or journals are\r\nhailed in such a place.\r\n\r\nThe lines of operation marked out for the other generals naturally bore\r\nrelation to the real or supposed position of the insurgent forces. The\r\nrumours which reached head-quarters concerning the concentration of\r\nrebel leaders in Rohilcund, even making allowance for exaggerations,\r\ntold of a somewhat formidable organisation. Among the best-known names\r\nincluded in the list were Khan Bahadoor Khan, Nena Sahib, Fuzul Huq,\r\nWaladid Khan, and the Nawab of Furruckabad. Khan Bahadoor Khan was chief\r\nruler; and he appears to have organised something like a regular\r\ngovernment, with dewans, moonshees, naibs, darogahs, kotwals, nazims,\r\nand military commanders. Nena Sahib was there as a sort of distinguished\r\nrefugee; as were also two shahzadas or princes of the royal family of\r\nDelhi. Nena Sahib is supposed to have arrived at Bareilly in Rohilcund,\r\nafter Sir Colin’s great victory at Lucknow, with four hundred troopers,\r\nand to have taken up his abode in the fine large native school-room\r\nbuilt by the British in that city. One among many bazaar reports was,\r\nthat Khan Bahadoor Khan began to entertain misgivings concerning the\r\nultimate success of his rebel policy; but that Nena Sahib, acting on his\r\nfears, insisted that a drawing back would be ruinous. Another rumour,\r\nhaving much probability to recommend it, was to the effect that Nena\r\nSahib looked to Central India, the region of Gwalior, Kotah, and Indore,\r\nas the field in which his own personal success might ultimately be best\r\ninsured, on account of his great influence among the Mahrattas of that\r\nregion; and it was supposed that, failing of success in Oude and\r\nRohilcund, he would endeavour to cross the Ganges and the Jumna into\r\nBundelcund and Central India. Hence one of the points of policy on the\r\nside of the commander-in-chief, was to guard those great rivers at as\r\nmany ghats or passing-places as possible—in the hope that, confined to\r\nOude and Rohilcund, the rebels might be crushed; and in the fear that,\r\nscattered over Central India, they might again become powerful. Whether\r\nhis forces were sufficiently numerous for this duty, was one of the many\r\nquestions that pressed upon Sir Colin Campbell. The trite saying of an\r\nenemy ‘not knowing when they were beaten,’ was many times revived by the\r\nBritish officers in those days; the mutineers seldom gained a victory;\r\nbut on the other hand, they were not much disheartened by defeat; they\r\nretreated, only to collect and fight again; and thus the British troops\r\nseldom felt that a victory would give an unquestionably permanent\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nOf the leaders who had taken part in the conquest of Lucknow, Jung\r\nBahadoor, the Nepaulese chieftain—as has been shown in a former\r\nchapter—went to Allahabad with a body-guard, to hold an interview with\r\nthe governor-general. The rest of the Goorkha contingent retraced their\r\nsteps by slow degrees towards their Nepaulese home. So late as the 22d\r\nof April, the main body of Goorkhas were no further from Lucknow than\r\nNawabgunge, a town on the banks of the Gogra, northeast of the capital\r\nof Oude. On that day, they marched to Sutturgunje, and on the 23d to\r\nDurriabad. This town had a fort which might have made a stout\r\nresistance, but there were no rebel troops at hand to put the matter to\r\nproof. After remaining at Durriabad two days, the Goorkhas marched on\r\nthe 25th to Shugahgunje, on the 26th to Mobarrukgunje, and on the 27th\r\nto Durabgunje—all of them places on or near the banks of the Gogra, on\r\nthe route towards Fyzabad. Resting two days at Durabgunje, they marched\r\non the 29th to Ayodha or Oude, the ancient Hindoo capital, afterwards\r\nsupplanted by the Mohammedan Fyzabad, just at hand—which Fyzabad was in\r\nits turn supplanted by Lucknow. On the last day of the month, the\r\nGoorkhas were on one side of the river Gogra at Fyzabad, and a body of\r\nrebels on the other—each intently watching the other, but without\r\nfighting. Maun Singh was at that time at Fyzabad, friendly to the\r\nBritish. Little satisfaction appears to have been derived by any party\r\nfrom this co-operation of the Goorkhas with the British. In the\r\npreceding July and August, when Havelock was straining every nerve to\r\nbring a small force up to Lucknow, and when Inglis was contending\r\nagainst stupendous difficulties in that city—in those months, there was\r\nan army of three or four thousand Goorkhas near the eastern frontier of\r\nOude, badly commanded and insufficiently employed. Why they were not\r\npushed on to Lucknow, as an auxiliary force, was known only to the\r\nauthorities; but, in its effect, this inactivity of the Goorkhas called\r\nforth much adverse criticism. Again, during the six months from the\r\nbeginning of September to the beginning of March, the assistance from\r\nNepaul was not of such a character as had been hoped by those who knew\r\nthat the Goorkhas enlisted in the Sirmoor and Kumaon battalions were\r\nreally brave and efficient troops, and who expected that Jung Bahadoor’s\r\nGoorkhas would prove to be men of the same stamp. Why the aid rendered\r\nwas so small, was a politico-military question, on which very little\r\ninformation was afforded. When, at last, a really large Nepaulese army\r\nentered Oude, its movements were so slow that Sir Colin began the siege\r\nof Lucknow without its aid; and when the siege was over, the army began\r\nto march back again, without participating further in the war. This was\r\na very impotent result; and the Nepaulese episode was by no means a\r\nbrilliant one in the history of the wars of the mutiny. So far as\r\nconcerns the march during the month of April, from Lucknow towards the\r\nNepaul frontier, it may be remarked that the Goorkhas dreaded the\r\napproaching hot weather, that their number of sick was very large, and\r\nthat the carts for their baggage were so enormous in number as greatly\r\nto impede their movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Goorkha Havildar or Sergeant.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother of the generals concerned in the siege of Lucknow, Sir Edward\r\nLugard, was intrusted by the commander-in-chief with service in a region\r\ninfested by Koer Singh—the chieftain whose name had been so closely\r\nassociated with the Dinapoor mutiny and the ‘disaster at Arrah,’ in the\r\npreceding summer. This rebel had worked round nearly in a circle—not\r\nmetaphorically, but topographically. He had marched at the head of\r\ninsurgents south and southwest from Arrah, then west into Bundelcund,\r\nthen north into the Doab and Oude; and now it was his fortune to be\r\ndriven east and southeast back to his old quarters in the neighbourhood\r\nof Arrah.\r\n\r\nBefore Lugard could cross the frontier into the provinces eastward of\r\nOude, it was found necessary to bring smaller forces to bear upon bodies\r\nof rebels infesting those provinces, and threatening to command the\r\nregion between the rivers Goomtee and Gogra. The city of Azimghur was in\r\nthis way greatly indebted to the gallant exertions of Lord Mark Kerr.\r\nThis officer, immediately on the arrival of news that Azimghur was beset\r\nby the enemy, started off from Benares on the 2d of April, with 450 men\r\nof H.M. 13th regiment and Queen’s Bays, and two 6-pounder guns. Though\r\nimpeded by a train of three hundred bullock-carts laden with ammunition,\r\nKerr pushed forward with such rapidity that he arrived in the\r\nneighbourhood of Azimghur on the third day after quitting Benares. Here\r\nhe was opposed by three or four thousand rebels, comprising a large\r\nproportion of sepoys of the too celebrated Dinapoor brigade. The rebels\r\nwere commanded with some skill by a subadar of one of the mutinied\r\nregiments. They occupied a position of considerable strength, on the\r\nright and left sides of the main road; their right resting on a strong\r\nvillage, and their left protected by a ditch and embankment. Lord Mark\r\nsucceeded in dislodging those of the enemy who were immediately in his\r\nfront; but while thus engaged, his convoy in the rear was attacked by\r\neight hundred rebels, who were with great difficulty beaten off, at the\r\nexpense of the life of Captain Jones, who was guarding the convoy.\r\nOvercoming all resistance, Lord Mark succeeded in reaching a point near\r\nAzimghur, and remained there until the arrival of Lugard’s column from\r\nLucknow. This portion of the rebels did not return to the city after the\r\naction, but retired in good order, taking their guns and baggage with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAzimghur, however, needed the assistance of a larger force than Kerr\r\ncould bring against it; for Koer Singh, with a formidable band of\r\nrebels, had to be contended against, in a region containing many large\r\ntowns. Sir Edward Lugard, placed by Sir Colin Campbell in command of a\r\ncolumn destined for service in this region, started from Lucknow during\r\nthe last week in March; but the destruction of a bridge over the Goomtee\r\nat Sultanpore greatly delayed his progress, and compelled him to take a\r\ncircuitous route by Jounpoor, which city he did not reach till the 9th\r\nof April. His column was a strong one; comprising three regiments of\r\ninfantry, three of Sikh horse, a military train, three batteries of\r\nhorse-artillery, and seven hundred carts full of warlike stores. On the\r\nevening of the 10th, he marched out from Jounpoor, to encounter Gholab\r\nHossein, one of the rebel chuckladars or leaders. The enemy did not stay\r\nto fight, but retreated precipitately. They required close watching,\r\nhowever; for while Sir Edward was on the march from Jounpoor to\r\nAzimghur, a large rebel force got into his rear, and attempted to\r\nre-enter Jounpoor. This caused him to modify his plan, and to disperse\r\nthe rebels before proceeding to Azimghur. In this he succeeded, but lost\r\nthe services of Lieutenant Charles Havelock, nephew of the distinguished\r\ngeneral. The gallant young officer, at the commencement of the mutiny,\r\nhad been adjutant of the 12th Bengal native irregular cavalry, and was\r\nthrown out of employment by the revolt of that regiment. He then went as\r\na volunteer with his uncle, and was for nine months more or less engaged\r\nin the operations in and around Lucknow. When Lugard left the army of\r\nOude, and took command of the column whose operations are here being\r\nrecorded, young Havelock accompanied him, holding a command in a Goorkha\r\nbattalion. It was while Lugard was dispersing the rebels near Jounpoor,\r\nthat the lieutenant was killed by a shot from a hut in an obscure\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nSir Edward, resuming his march towards Azimghur, reached that city at\r\nlength on the 15th, somewhat vexed at the numerous delays that had\r\noccurred on his journey. On his arrival at the bridge of boats which\r\ncrossed the small river Tons at that city, he encountered a portion of\r\nKoer Singh’s main army. They fought well, and with some determination;\r\nand it was not without a struggle that he defeated and dispersed them.\r\nMr Venables, the civilian who had gained so high a reputation for\r\ncourage during the earlier mutinous proceedings in the district, was\r\nwounded on this occasion. The East India Company had reason to be proud\r\nof its civilians, for the most part, during the troubles; Mr Venables\r\nwas only one among many who nobly distinguished themselves. After this\r\nbattle at the bridge, it soon became evident, as in many other\r\ninstances, that the rebels had been too quick for their pursuers. Koer\r\nSingh and the main body of his force were quitting Azimghur on the one\r\nside just when Lugard entered it on the other; the fighting was merely\r\nwith the rear guard, and all the rest of the insurgents marched off\r\nsafely. As it was by no means desirable that they should escape to work\r\nmischief elsewhere, Sir Edward, on the 16th, sent off Brigadier Douglas\r\nin pursuit of them, with the 37th and 84th regiments, some cavalry and\r\nartillery. Lugard himself proposed to encamp for a while at Azimghur.\r\n\r\nWe have now for a time to leave Sir Edward Lugard, and to notice the\r\nunsatisfactory result of the operations which he initiated. The town of\r\nArrah was destined to be the scene of another discomfiture of British\r\ntroops, as mortifying if not as disastrous as that which occurred early\r\nin the mutiny, and inflicted by the same hand—Koer Singh. When this\r\nindefatigable rebel was driven out of Azimghur, he separated from some\r\nof the other chieftains, at a point which he believed would enable him\r\nto cross the Ganges into the district of Shahabad, where Arrah would be\r\nnear at hand. He marched with two thousand sepoys and a host of rabble.\r\nBrigadier Douglas pursued him with great rapidity, marching a hundred\r\nmiles in five days of great heat; he came up with the rebels at Bansdeh,\r\ndefeated them, and drove them to Beyriah, Koer Singh himself being\r\nwounded. On the 21st, a portion of Douglas’s force again came up with\r\nthe enemy while in the act of crossing the Ganges at Seoporeghat in the\r\nGhazeepore district. It appeared that Koer Singh had cleverly outwitted\r\nColonel Cumberlege, who, with two regiments of Madras cavalry, was\r\nendeavouring to aid Douglas in crushing him at a particular spot. Koer\r\nSingh did not wait to be crushed, but swiftly and silently marched to\r\nthe Ganges at a spot not guarded by Cumberlege. When Douglas’s troops\r\ncame up, they killed a few of the rebels, and captured two guns, six\r\nelephants, and much ammunition and treasure—but the interception had not\r\nbeen prompt enough; for Koer Singh and the greater part of his force had\r\nsafely crossed to the right bank of the river. The remainder of\r\nDouglas’s column came up on the evening of this day, quite worn out with\r\ntheir long march, and needing some days’ rest. Koer Singh, although\r\nbeaten first by Lugard and then by Douglas, had baffled them both in\r\nreference to a successful flight; and now it was his fortune (though\r\nwounded) to baffle a third British officer. The rebels reached Koer\r\nSingh’s hereditary domain of Jugdispore. The town of Arrah was at that\r\ntime occupied by 150 men of H.M. 35th foot, 150 of Rattray’s Sikhs, and\r\n50 seamen of the Naval Brigade—the whole under Captain Le Grand. This\r\nofficer, hearing of the approach of the rebels, and knowing that small\r\nbodies had often defeated large armies during the course of the war,\r\nsallied forth to prevent the march of Koer Singh to Jugdispore, or else\r\nto disturb him at that place. He found them posted in a jungle. They\r\nwere nearly two thousand in number, but dispirited, and without guns. Le\r\nGrand’s small force, with the two 12-pounder howitzers, encountered the\r\nenemy about two miles from Jugdispore, at daylight on the 23d. After an\r\nineffectual firing of the howitzers, a bugle-call threw everything into\r\nconfusion. Whether Le Grand, fearing to be surrounded, sounded a\r\nretreat, or whether some other signal was misinterpreted, it appears\r\ncertain that his force fell into inextricable confusion; they abandoned\r\nguns and elephants, and fled towards Arrah, followed by numbers of the\r\nenemy, who shot and cut down many of them. The 35th suffered terribly;\r\ntwo-thirds of their number were either killed or wounded, including\r\nCaptain Le Grand himself, Lieutenant Massey, and Dr Clarke. This\r\nmortifying calamity, in which the unfortunate Le Grand is said to have\r\ndisobeyed instructions given by the superior officer of the district,\r\ngave rise to much bitter controversy. The 35th was one of those\r\nregiments of which the colonel was an old man, shattered in health, and\r\nnot well fitted to head his troops in active service. It was also, in\r\nthe heat of controversy, brought as a charge against him that he was a\r\nmartinet in matters of discipline, and kept his soldiers in red cloth\r\nand pipe-clayed belts under the tremendous heat of an Indian sun. The\r\ncharges, in this as in many similar cases, may have been overwrought;\r\nbut all felt that the 35th had not behaved in such a way as English\r\ntroops are wont to behave when well commanded—and hence the inference\r\nthat they were _not_ well commanded.\r\n\r\nA new series of operations became necessary as a consequence of this\r\ndisaster near Jugdispore. The news hastened the movements of Brigadier\r\nDouglas, who on the 25th crossed the Ganges at Seenaghat, and pushed on\r\nthe 84th foot and two guns towards Jugdispore. It was, however, not till\r\nthe month of May that that jungle-haunt of rebels was effectually\r\ncleared out. Meanwhile a little had been doing at another spot in the\r\nsame region. When, after the action at the bridge of Azimghur, Koer\r\nSingh’s force divided into three, one of these divisions, with several\r\nhorse-artillery guns, marched towards Ghazeepore. Brigadier Gordon, at\r\nBenares, at once ordered two companies of H.M. 54th to proceed to\r\nGhazeepore by hasty marches, half the number being carried on elephants\r\nor in ekahs. It was hoped that these troops, coming in aid of small\r\nnumbers of royal troops, European cavalry, Madras cavalry, and two\r\n6-pounder guns, already at Ghazeepore, would suffice to protect that\r\nimportant city from the rebels; and this hope was realised. Considerably\r\nto the northwest, between Goruckpore and the Oude frontier, Colonel\r\nRowcroft maintained a small force, with which from time to time he\r\nrepelled attacks made by the enemy. On the 17th of April, when at\r\nAmorah, his camp was attacked by three thousand rebels; the attack was\r\nnot effectually resisted without eight hours’ hard fighting. The sepoys,\r\nalmost for the first time in the war, endeavoured to resist a cavalry\r\ncharge in British fashion, by kneeling in a line with upturned bayonets;\r\nbut a corps of Bengal yeomanry cavalry made the charge with such\r\nimpetuosity that the enemy were overthrown and a victory gained.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the general character of the operations eastward of\r\nOude. We have next to touch upon those of Sir Hope Grant, in Oude\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis gallant general, as colonel of a cavalry regiment, had commenced\r\nhis share in the war as a subordinate to one or more brigadiers; but he\r\nhad since proved himself well worthy of the command of a column under\r\nhis own responsibility. When Sir Colin Campbell parcelled out among his\r\nchief officers various duties consequent on the flight of the insurgents\r\nfrom Lucknow, a column or division was made up, to be commanded by Sir\r\nHope Grant, to look after such of the rebels as had taken a northerly\r\ndirection. His column consisted of H.M. 38th foot, one battalion of the\r\nRifle Brigade, a regiment of Sikhs, H.M. 9th Lancers (Hope Grant’s own\r\nregiment), a small body of reliable native cavalry, two troops of\r\nhorse-artillery, and a small siege and mortar train. It was known or\r\nbelieved that the Moulvie of Fyzabad had collected a force near Baree,\r\nabout thirty miles north of Lucknow; and that the Begum of Oude, with\r\nseveral cart-loads of treasure, had fled for concealment to Bitowlie,\r\nthe domain of a rebel named Gorhuccus Singh. To what extent Sir Hope\r\nGrant would be able to capture, intercept, or defeat the rebels in the\r\nservice of these leaders, was a problem yet to be solved. He set out\r\nfrom Lucknow on the 11th of April, with Brigadier Horsford as his second\r\nin command. In the first three days the troops marched to Baree, on the\r\nKhyrabad road; and then was experienced one of the perplexities of the\r\ncampaign. Every brigadier or divisional general was painfully impressed\r\nwith the danger of moving in a country where the mass of the population\r\nwas unfriendly. In many provinces the towns-people and villagers were\r\nfor the most part disposed, if not to aid the British, at least to hold\r\naloof; but the fact could not be concealed that the Oudians generally\r\nwere in a rebellious state of feeling, and would gladly have aided to\r\ncut off the resources of Sir Colin’s lieutenants. It was merely one\r\namong many examples, when Sir Hope Grant set out towards the Gogra, in\r\nhopes to overtake the Begum and her fleeing forces; his column or\r\nfield-force was accompanied by no less than 6000 hackeries or vehicles\r\nof various kinds, forming a line of nearly twenty miles; and it was\r\nessentially necessary, while assuming the offensive in front, that the\r\nflanks and rear of this immense train should be protected—a difficult\r\nduty in a hostile country. Scarcely had Grant approached near Baree,\r\nwhen the cavalry of the Moulvie’s rebel force got into his rear, and\r\nattempted to cut off the enormous baggage-train. Sir Hope was too good a\r\ngeneral to be taken by surprise; but his rear-guard found enough to do\r\nto repel the attack made upon them, and to protect the enormous\r\nbaggage-train. This done, and some horse-artillery guns captured, Sir\r\nHope Grant resumed his march. Turning eastward from Baree, he marched\r\ntowards the Gogra, in the hope of intercepting the flight of the Begum\r\nof Oude, her paramour Mummoo Khan, and a large force of rebels. On the\r\n15th he reached Mohamedabad, on this route; and on the 17th he halted at\r\nRamnuggur for a few days, while a strong reconnoitring party set forth\r\nto ascertain if possible the exact position and strength of the rebels.\r\nThe news obtained was very indefinite, and amounted to little more than\r\nthis—that the Begum and Mummoo Khan were retreating northward with one\r\nlarge force, and the Moulvie westward with another; but that it would\r\nnot be very easy to catch either, as the sepoys were celebrated for\r\ncelerity of movement during a retreat. Sir Hope Grant dispersed various\r\nbodies of rebels, and disturbed the plans of the Begum and the Moulvie;\r\nbut he returned to Lucknow towards the close of the month without having\r\ncaught either of those wily personages, and with many of his troops laid\r\nprostrate by the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GHAZEEPORE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe turn now towards the west or northwest, on the Rohilcund side of\r\nOude. It has already been mentioned, that after the fall of Lucknow,\r\nmany of the rebel leaders fled to Rohilcund, with the hope of making a\r\nbold stand at Bareilly, Shahjehanpoor, Moradabad, and other towns in\r\nthat province. Khan Bahadoor Khan, the self-appointed chief of Bareilly,\r\nwas nominally the head of the whole confederacy in this region; but it\r\ndepended on the chapter of accidents how long this leadership would\r\ncontinue. At any rate, Sir Colin Campbell saw that he could not allow\r\nthis nest of rebels to remain untouched; Bareilly must be conquered, as\r\nDelhi and Lucknow had been. The veteran commander probably mourned in\r\nsecret the necessity for sending his gallant troops on a long march,\r\ninto a new field of action, with a sun blazing on them like a ball of\r\nfire; but seeing the necessity, he commanded, and they obeyed. His plan\r\nof strategy comprised a twofold line of action—an advance of one column\r\nnorthwestward from Lucknow; and an advance of another southeastward from\r\nRoorkee; the two columns to assist in clearing the border districts of\r\nRohilcund, and then to meet at Bareilly, the chief city of the province.\r\nWe will notice first the operations of the force on the northeast\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Jones, with the Roorkee field-force, commenced operations in\r\nthe eastern part of Rohilcund, about the middle of April. His force\r\nconsisted of H.M. 60th Rifles, the 1st Sikh infantry, Coke’s Rifles, the\r\n17th Punjaub infantry, the Moultan Horse, with detachments of artillery\r\nand engineers. The force numbered three thousand good troops in all, and\r\nwas strengthened by eight heavy and six light guns. Major (now\r\nBrigadier) Coke, whose Punjaub riflemen had gained for themselves so\r\nhigh a reputation, commanded the infantry portion of Jones’s column. The\r\ncolumn marched from Roorkee on the 15th, and made arrangements for\r\ncrossing to the left bank of the Ganges as soon as possible. A large\r\nnumber of the enemy having intrenched themselves at Nagul, about sixteen\r\nmiles below Hurdwar on the left bank, Jones made his dispositions\r\naccordingly. He determined to send his heavy guns and baggage to the\r\nghat opposite Nagul; while his main body should cross at Hurdwar, march\r\ndown the river on the other side, and take the intrenchment in flank.\r\nThis plan was completely carried out by the evening of the 17th—Nagul\r\nbeing taken, the enemy driven away with great loss, and the whole column\r\nsafely encamped on that side of the Ganges which would afford easier\r\naccess to the hot-bed of the rebels at Bareilly. Four days afterwards,\r\nBrigadier Jones encountered the Daranuggur insurgent force near Nageena\r\nor Nuggeena, on the banks of a canal. The insurgents maintained a fire\r\nfor a time from nine guns; but Jones speedily attacked them with his\r\ncavalry, outflanked them, charged, captured the guns and six elephants,\r\nand put the enemy speedily to flight, after very considerable loss.\r\nJones’s killed and wounded were few in number; but he had to regret the\r\nloss of Lieutenant Gostling, who was shot through the heart while\r\nheading some of the troops. The brigadier resumed his march. Luckily for\r\nBritish interests, Mooradabad was not so deeply steeped in rebellion as\r\nBareilly; and the Rajah of Rampore, not far distant, was faithful so far\r\nas his small power would extend. The benefit of this state of affairs\r\nwas felt at the time now under notice. Feroze Shah, one of the Shahzadas\r\nor princes of Delhi in league with the Bareilly mutineers, marched on\r\nthe 21st of April towards Mooradabad, to demand money and supplies. He\r\nwas refused; and much fighting and pillage resulted as consequences.\r\nBrigadier Jones’s column came up opportunely; he entered Mooradabad on\r\nthe 26th, checked the plundering, drove out the rebels, captured many\r\ninsurgent chieftains, and re-established the confidence of the\r\ntowns-people. At the end of the month, Jones was still in Mooradabad or\r\nits neighbourhood, ready for co-operation in May with another column\r\nwhich we must now notice.\r\n\r\nWhile Jones had been thus occupied, Bareilly and the rebels were\r\nthreatened on the other side by the Rohilcund field-force. During the\r\nfirst two or three weeks after the conquest of Lucknow, Sir Colin\r\nCampbell was engaged in various plans which did not permit of the\r\nimmediate dispatch of troops to Rohilcund; but on the 7th of April\r\nseveral regiments began to assemble at the Moosa Bagh, to form a small\r\nspecial army for service in that province. Why they were not despatched\r\nearlier, was one of the many problems which the commander-in-chief kept\r\nto himself. On the 9th this minor army, the Rohilcund field-force, set\r\nout, with General Walpole as its commander, and Brigadier Adrian Hope at\r\nthe head of the infantry. The distance from Lucknow to Bareilly, about\r\nfifteen marches, was through a region so ill provided with roads that\r\nfew or no night-marches could be made; it was necessary to have the aid\r\nof daylight to avoid plunging into unforeseen difficulties and dangers.\r\nAs a consequence, the troops would be exposed to the heat of an Indian\r\nsun during their journey, and had to look forward to many trials on that\r\naccount. Not the least among the numerous perplexities that arose out of\r\nthe defective state of the roads, was the difficulty of dragging the\r\nguns which necessarily accompanied such a force; cavalry and infantry\r\nwere, in all such cases, inevitably delayed by the necessity of waiting\r\nuntil the ponderous pieces of ordnance could arrive.[167]\r\n\r\nWalpole’s field-force, resting at night under shady groves, it was hoped\r\nmight reach Bareilly about the 24th of the month; and this was the more\r\nto be desired, seeing that Rohilcund, from its position in relation to\r\nnumerous rivers, becomes almost impassable as soon as the rains set\r\nin—about the end of May or the beginning of June. Marching onward in\r\naccordance with the plan laid down, Walpole came on the 14th of April to\r\none of the many forts which have so often been mentioned in connection\r\nwith the affairs of Oude. The name of the place, situated about fifty\r\nmiles from Lucknow, and ten from the Ganges, was variously spelled\r\nRhodamow, Roodhamow, Roer, and Roowah; but whatever the spelling, the\r\nfort became associated in the minds of the British troops with more\r\nangry complainings than any other connected with the war; since it was\r\nthe scene of a mortifying repulse which better generalship might have\r\navoided, and which was accompanied by the death of a very favourite\r\nofficer. Rhodamow was a small fort or group of houses enclosed by a high\r\nmud-wall, loopholed for musketry, provided with irregular bastions at\r\nthe angles, and having two gates. It was a petty place, in relation to\r\nthe largeness of the force about to attack it—nearly six thousand men.\r\nWhile marching through the jungle towards Rohilcund, Walpole heard that\r\nfifteen hundred insurgents had thrown themselves into this fort of\r\nRhodamow; but the number proved to be much smaller. He attacked it with\r\ninfantry without previously using his artillery, and without (as it\r\nwould appear) a sufficient reconnaissance. He sent on the 42d\r\nHighlanders and the 4th Punjaub infantry to take the fort; but no sooner\r\ndid the troops approach it than they were received by so fierce and\r\nunexpected a fire of musketry, from a concealed enemy, that not only was\r\nthe advance checked, but the gallant Brigadier Adrian Hope was killed at\r\nthe head of his Highlanders. The troops could not immediately and\r\neffectually reply to this fire, for their opponents were hidden behind\r\nthe loopholed wall. Everything seems to have been thrown into confusion\r\nby this first fatal mistake; the supports were sent up too late, or to\r\nthe wrong place; and the exasperated troops were forced to retire, amid\r\nyells of triumph from the enemy. The heavy guns were then brought to do\r\nthat which they ought to have done at first; they began to breach the\r\nwall, but the enemy quietly evacuated the fort during the night, with\r\nscarcely any loss. Besides Adrian Hope, several other officers were\r\neither killed or wounded, and nearly a hundred rank and file. During\r\nthis mortifying disaster, in which the Highlanders were particularly\r\nunfortunate in the loss of officers, Quartermaster Sergeant Simpson, of\r\nthe 42d, displayed that daring spirit of gallantry which so endears a\r\nsoldier to his companions. When the infantry had been recalled from the\r\nattack, Simpson heard that two officers of his regiment had been left\r\nbehind, dead or wounded in the ditch outside the wall. He rushed out,\r\nseized the body of Captain Bromley, and brought it back amid a torrent\r\nof musketry; setting forth again, he brought in the body of Captain\r\nDouglas in a similar way, and he did not cease until seven had been thus\r\nbrought away—to be recovered if only wounded, to be decently interred if\r\ndead. It was a day, however, the memory of which could not be sweetened\r\nby any such displays of gallantry, or by many subsequent victories; the\r\nmen of the two Highland regiments felt as if a deep personal injury had\r\nbeen inflicted on them by the commander of the column. Sir Colin\r\nCampbell, when the news of this untoward event reached him, paid a\r\nmarked compliment to Adrian Hope in his dispatch. ‘The death of this\r\nmost distinguished and gallant officer causes the deepest grief to the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Still young in years, he had risen to high command;\r\nand by his undaunted courage, combined as it was with extreme kindness\r\nand charm of manner, had secured the confidence of his brigade in no\r\nordinary degree.’ Viscount Canning, in a like spirit, officially\r\nnotified that ‘no more mournful duty has fallen upon the\r\ngovernor-general in the course of the present contest than that of\r\nrecording the premature death of this distinguished young commander.’\r\n\r\nGeneral Walpole pursued his march, and had a successful encounter on the\r\n22d with a large body of the enemy at Sirsa. His cavalry and artillery\r\nattacked them so vigorously as to capture their guns and camp, and to\r\ndrive them over the Ramgunga in such haste as to leave them no time for\r\ndestroying the bridge of boats at that place. This achievement was\r\nfortunate, for it enabled Walpole on the 23d to transport his heavy guns\r\nquickly and safely over the Ramgunga at Allygunje. A few days after\r\nthis, he was joined by the commander-in-chief, whose movements we must\r\nnext notice.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately after Sir Colin Campbell’s return from his interview\r\nwith the governor-general at Allahabad, that he withdrew from Lucknow\r\nall the remaining troops, except those destined for the defence of that\r\nimportant city, and for the re-establishment of British influence in\r\nOude. He formed an expeditionary army, which he headed himself—or\r\nrather, the army set forth from Lucknow to Cawnpore, and the\r\ncommander-in-chief joined it at the last-named place on the 17th of\r\nApril. The result of the conference at Allahabad had been, a\r\ndetermination to march up the Doab to Furruckabad, and to attack the\r\nRohilcund rebels on a side where neither Jones nor Walpole could well\r\nreach them. The heat was great, the rivers were rising, and the rains\r\nwere coming in a few weeks; and it became now a question whether the\r\nmovements from Lucknow as a centre had or had not been too long delayed.\r\nSir Colin with his column—for, being a mere remnant, it was too small a\r\nforce to designate an army—took their departure from Cawnpore on the\r\n18th, leaving that city in the hands of a small but (at present)\r\nsufficient body of troops. On the 19th he advanced to Kilianpore, on the\r\n20th to Poorah, and on the 21st to Urrowl—marching during early morn,\r\nand encamping in the hotter hours of the day. The day’s work commenced,\r\nindeed, so early as one o’clock in the morning; when the elephants and\r\ncamels began to be loaded with their burdens, the equipage and tents\r\npacked up, and the marching arrangements completed. Between two or three\r\no’clock, all being in readiness, away went infantry, cavalry, artillery,\r\nengineers, commissariat, and a countless host of natives, horses,\r\ncamels, elephants, bullocks, and vehicles—covering an area of which the\r\nreal soldiers occupied but a very small part. They marched or rode till\r\nabout six o’clock; when all prepared for breakfast, and for a hot day\r\nduring which little active exertion was possible without imminent danger\r\nof _coup de soleil_. Sir Colin’s train of munition and supplies was\r\nenormous; for, in addition to the usual baggage of an army, he had to\r\ntake large commissariat supplies with him. The villagers held aloof in a\r\nmanner not usual in the earlier stages of the mutiny, and in other parts\r\nof India; they did not come forward to engage in a traffic which would\r\ncertainly have been profitable to them, in selling provisions to the\r\narmy. Whether this arose from inability or disinclination, was a matter\r\nfor controversy; but the fact itself occasioned embarrassment and\r\nuneasiness to a commander who had to drag with his army a huge train of\r\nanimals and vehicles filled with food. The enormous number of natives,\r\ntoo, that accompanied the force, with their wives and families, exerted\r\nits usual cumbrous effect on the movements of the troops; so that the\r\nfighting-men themselves bore but a minute fractional ratio to the living\r\nand dead accompaniments of the column. It is useless to complain of\r\nthis. An army of five thousand, or any other number, of British troops\r\n_must_ have a large train of native attendants, to contend against the\r\npeculiarities of Indian climate and Indian customs. Mr Russell, marching\r\nwith this portion of the late ‘Army of Oude,’ said: ‘If the people we\r\nsee around us, who are ten or twelve to one as compared with us in this\r\ncamp, were—not to arm and cut our throats, or poison us, or anything of\r\nthat kind—but simply bid us a silent good-bye this night, and leave us,\r\nIndia would be lost to us in a day. It requires only that, and all the\r\npower of England could not hold the eastern empire. We could not even\r\nstrike our tents without these men to-morrow. We are dependent on\r\nthem—even the common soldier is—for the water we drink and the meals we\r\neat, for our transport, for all but the air we breathe; and the latter,\r\nit must be admitted, is not improved by them sometimes. The moment that\r\nsuch a thing becomes possible as a popular desertion, through patriotic\r\nor any other motives, from the service of the state, it becomes\r\nimpossible to hold India except upon sufferance. It is the rupee,\r\nself-interest, and the necessities of a population trained to follow\r\ncamps, which afford guarantees against such a secession—unlikely enough\r\nindeed in any nation, and scarcely possible in any war.... We are, in\r\nfact, waging war against Hindoos and Mussulmans by the aid and with the\r\nconsent of other Hindoos and Mussulmans, just as Alexander was able to\r\nbeat Porus by the aid of his Indian allies; and no European or other\r\nstate can ever rule in India without the co-operation and assistance of\r\na large proportion of the races which inhabit the vast peninsula.’\r\n\r\nSir Colin marched on the 22d to Meerun-ke-serai, near the ruins of the\r\nancient city of Canouje; on the 23d to Gosaigunje; and on the 24th to\r\nKamalgunje—approaching each day nearer to Furruckabad. Every day’s\r\ncamping-ground was selected near the Ganges, both for the sake of\r\nsalubrity, and to check if possible the passage of rebel bands over the\r\nriver from Oude into the Doab. On the 25th the column reached\r\nFurruckabad, or rather the adjacent English station of Futteghur.\r\nGeneral Penny came from a neighbouring district to confer with the\r\ncommander-in-chief on matters connected with the Rohilcund campaign, and\r\nthen returned to the column or brigade which he commanded. Futteghur had\r\nregained a part of its former importance, as the place where most of the\r\nartillery-carriages and sepoy-clothing were made, and where vast\r\nquantities of timber and cloth had fallen as spoil to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe sojourn at Futteghur was very brief. The electric telegraph had been\r\nbusy transmitting information to and from Allahabad; and as Sir Colin’s\r\nplans were already made, he lost no time in putting them in execution.\r\nThe main plan comprised four movements—Campbell from Futteghur, Walpole\r\nfrom Lucknow, Jones from Roorkee, and Penny from Puttealee; all intended\r\nto hem the rebels into the middle of Rohilcund, and there crush them.\r\nThe marches of Walpole and Jones have already been noticed; Penny was to\r\nmarch his column towards Meerunpore Muttra, between Shahjehanpoor and\r\nBareilly, after crossing the Ganges near Nudowlee; while the\r\ncommander-in-chief was to enter Rohilcund directly from Futteghur. In\r\nthe middle of the night between the 26th and 27th his column, elephants\r\nand guns and all, crossed the Ganges by the bridge of boats, and entered\r\nthe province which was to be a scene of hostilities. After a few hours\r\nthe column reached the river Ramgunga, which it crossed by the bridge of\r\nboats fortunately secured by Walpole as the fruit of his victory at\r\nAllygunje; and soon afterwards the commander-in-chief effected a\r\njunction with Walpole, at Tingree near the Ramgunga. No very long time\r\nfor repose was allowed; stern work was to be done, and the sooner\r\ncommenced, the less would it be checked by heat and prohibited by rains.\r\nA march of a few hours brought the now united columns to Jelalabad—one\r\nof many places of that name in India. It was a fort which had lately\r\nbeen occupied by a small body of matchlockmen, who had precipitately\r\nabandoned it when news of Sir Colin’s approach reached them. A small\r\nvillage lay near, and was governed by the fort. The Moulvie of Fyzabad\r\nwas believed to have intended to make a stand at this place, but to have\r\nabandoned it for a larger stronghold at Shahjehanpoor. On the 29th, a\r\nfurther approach was made to Kanth. Each day was pretty well like that\r\nwhich preceded it—the same early marching, camping, and resting, and the\r\nsame struggle with the camp-followers, who, however closely watched,\r\npertinaciously plundered the villages through or near which they\r\npassed—thereby terrifying and exasperating all villagers alike, whether\r\nfriendly or unfriendly to the British. This system of plunder by the\r\ncamp-followers was one of the greatest troubles to which the generals of\r\nthe several columns were exposed; severe punishments were threatened,\r\nbut all in vain.\r\n\r\nIt was on the last day of the month that Sir Colin Campbell and General\r\nWalpole arrived at Shahjehanpoor; and then it was to learn that the wily\r\nand active Moulvie had again outmanœuvred them. The plan had been to\r\ndraw a cordon more and more closely round the rebels at Shahjehanpoor\r\nand Bareilly, and thus to catch them as in a trap. But the Moulvie would\r\nnot enter the trap. He held Shahjehanpoor, with a considerable force of\r\nmen and guns, as long as he deemed it safe, and then escaped just at the\r\nright moment. It was well to regain Shahjehanpoor, after that place had\r\nbeen eleven months in the hands of rebels; but it was vexing to learn\r\nthat the Moulvie had retreated towards Oude—the very province where his\r\npresence was least desired by the British. Nena Sahib, it was also\r\nascertained, had quitted Shahjehanpoor a few days earlier, and just\r\nbefore leaving, had ordered the government buildings to be destroyed, in\r\norder that the British troops might find no shelter when they arrived.\r\nThis cowardly, ruthless, but active and inventive chieftain succeeded in\r\nhis aim in this matter; there were few roofed buildings left, and the\r\nencampment had to be effected under a tope of trees, with earthen\r\nintrenchments thrown up around.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from this summary of Rohilcund affairs, that the\r\noperations against the rebels in that province did not advance far\r\nduring the month of April, as concerns any effective crushing of the\r\nrebellion. The insurgents were beaten wherever met with; but their\r\nubiquity and vitality greatly puzzled Sir Colin and his brigadier; and\r\nit remained to be seen how far the month of May would witness the\r\nre-establishment of British authority in Rohilcund and Oude. Some of the\r\ncolumns and field-forces had penetrated from the east and south as far\r\nas Shahjehanpoor, others from the west and northwest as far as\r\nMooradabad; but Bareilly, the chief city in Rohilcund, had not been\r\nreached by any of them at the end of April.\r\n\r\nFew events caused more regret in the army at this period than the death\r\nof Captain Sir William Peel, the gallant seaman who had earned so high a\r\nreputation as commander of the Naval Brigade. After his wound, received\r\nat Lucknow, he was carried in a doolie or litter to Cawnpore; and when\r\nat that station he gradually became able to walk about slowly by the aid\r\nof a stick. He soon, however, exhibited symptoms of small-pox, which,\r\nacting on a system at once ardent and debilitated, proved fatal. He died\r\nat Cawnpore after Sir Colin Campbell’s force had departed from that\r\nplace towards Futteghur; and thus the Queen and the country lost the\r\nservices of an eminent son of an eminent statesman. Every one felt the\r\njustice of the special compliment paid to this gallant naval officer by\r\nthe governor-general, in the official order issued immediately on the\r\nreceipt of the news of Peel’s death.[168] Throughout the Crimean,\r\nPersian, and Indian wars, the British navy had been engaged in less\r\nfighting than many of its ardent members wished; and it was therefore\r\nall the more incumbent on the authorities to notice the exertions of\r\nnaval brigades when on shore.\r\n\r\nThroughout the extent of the Upper Doab, the British officers found much\r\ndifficulty in maintaining a fair stand against the rebels. Not that\r\nthere were large bodies of trained sepoys in the field, as in the\r\nregions just described, and in Central India; but there were numerous\r\nchieftains, each at the head of a small band of followers, ready to\r\nharass any spot not protected by English troops. Brigadier Penny, in\r\ncommand of a field-force organised at Delhi, was watching the district\r\nbetween that city and the Ganges—ready to put down insurgents wherever\r\nhe could encounter them, and hoping to assist the commander-in-chief in\r\nRohilcund. Another column, under Brigadier Seaton, controlled the region\r\naround Futteghur before Sir Colin reached that place; and he, like\r\nPenny, Jones, Walpole, Hope Grant, Lugard, and all the other commanders\r\nof sections of the army, found an active watchfulness of the enemy\r\nnecessary. One among Seaton’s engagements in the month of April may be\r\nbriefly noticed. On the 6th, when evening had darkened into night, he\r\nmarched from Futteghur to attack a body of rebels concerning whom he had\r\nreceived information. He took with him about 1400 men—comprising 600 of\r\nH.M. 82d under Colonel Hall, 400 Sikhs under Captain Stafford, 150\r\ncavalry under Lieutenant St John, and 200 of the Futteghur\r\nmounted-police battalion under Lieutenant de Kantzow—together with five\r\nguns under Major Smith. After marching all night, Seaton came up with\r\nthe enemy at seven in the morning, at a place called Kankur. The enemy’s\r\nforce was very large, though not well organised, and included nearly a\r\nthousand troopers well mounted and armed. After an artillery-fire on\r\nboth sides, and a sharp fire from Enfield rifles, the 82d rushed\r\nforward, entered the village, and worked terrible execution. The rebels\r\nfled, abandoning their camp, ammunition, and stores; together with\r\npapers and correspondence which threw light on some of the hitherto\r\nobscure proceedings of the mutineers. The rebel Rajah of Minpooree was\r\nthe chief leader of the insurgents, and with him were Ismael Khan and\r\nMohson Ali Khan.\r\n\r\nThe Minpooree district was much troubled by this rebellious rajah; but\r\nas Futteghur on the one side, and Agra on the other, were now in English\r\nhands, the rebels were more readily kept in subjection. Agra itself was\r\nsafe, and so was the main line of road thence through Muttra to Delhi.\r\n\r\nOne of the few pleasant scenes of the month, at Delhi, was the awarding\r\nof honour and profit to a native who had befriended Europeans in the\r\nhour of greatest need. Ten months before, when mutiny was still new and\r\nterrible, the native troops at Bhurtpore rose in revolt, and compelled\r\nthe Europeans in the neighbourhood to flee for their lives. The poor\r\nfugitives, thirty-two in number—chiefly women and children—roamed from\r\nplace to place, uncertain where they might sleep in peace. On one day\r\nthey arrived at the village of Mahonah. Here they met with one Hidayut\r\nAli, a ressaldar (troop-captain), of a regiment of irregular cavalry\r\nwhich had mutinied at Mozuffernugger; he was on furlough or leave of\r\nabsence at his native village, and did not join his mutinous companions.\r\nHe received the fugitives with kindness and courtesy, fed them\r\nliberally, gave them a comfortable house, renewed their toil-worn\r\ngarments, posted village sentries to give notice of the approach of any\r\nmutineers, disregarded a rebuke sent to him by the insurgents at Delhi,\r\nformed the villagers into an escort, and finally placed the thirty-two\r\nfugitives in a position which enabled them safely to reach Agra. This\r\nnoble conduct was not forgotten. In April the commissioner held a grand\r\ndurbar at Delhi, made a complimentary speech to Hidayut Ali, presented\r\nhim with a sword valued at a thousand rupees, and announced that the\r\ngovernment intended to bestow upon him the jaghire or revenues of his\r\nnative village.\r\n\r\nGood-fortune continued to mark the wide and important region of the\r\nPunjaub, in the absence of any of those great assemblages of rebels\r\nwhich so distracted the provinces further to the southeast. Nevertheless\r\nSir John Lawrence found a demand on him for unceasing watchfulness. The\r\nlonger the struggle continued in Hindostan and Central India, the more\r\ndanger was there that the Punjaubees, imbibing an idea that the British\r\nwere weak, would encourage a hope of regaining national independence.\r\nThere was also a grave question involved in the constitution of the\r\nnative army. When the troubles began in the month of May, and when\r\nCanning was beset with so many difficulties in his attempt to send up\r\ntroops from Calcutta, John Lawrence came to the rescue in a manner\r\ndeserving the lasting gratitude of all concerned in the maintenance of\r\nBritish rule in India. He felt a trusty reliance that the inhabitants of\r\nthe Punjaub, governed as he (aided by Montgomery, Cotton, Edwardes, and\r\nother energetic men) had governed them, would remain faithful, and would\r\nbe willing to accept active service as soldiers in British pay. His\r\ntrust was well founded. He sent to Delhi those troops, without which the\r\nconquest of the city could not have been effected; and he continued to\r\nraise regiment after regiment of Sikhs and Punjaubees—equipping,\r\ndrilling, and paying a number so large as to constitute in itself a\r\npowerful army. But there would necessarily be a limit to this process.\r\nThe Sikhs were faithful so far; but what if they should begin to feel\r\ntheir power, and turn to a national object the arms which had been given\r\nto them to fight in the British cause? Not many years had elapsed since\r\nthey had fought fiercely at Moultan and Lahore, Sobraon and\r\nChillianwalla, Moodkee and Ferozshah, against those very English whom\r\nthey were now defending; and it was at least possible, if not probable,\r\nthat dreams of reconquest might occupy their thoughts. Sir John Lawrence\r\nbrought to an end his further raising of regiments; and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the governor-general and the commander-in-chief\r\nappreciated the motives by which he had been influenced. In political\r\naffairs the Punjaub was very active; for not only did Lawrence become\r\nchief authority over a larger region than before, but many of his\r\nassistants were taken away from him. When Sir James Outram went to\r\nCalcutta as a member of the supreme council, Mr Montgomery was appointed\r\nchief-commissioner of Oude, and took with him many of the most\r\nexperienced civilians from Lahore to Lucknow. This necessitated great\r\nchanges in the _personnel_ of the Punjaub civil service, the\r\ncommissionerships and sub-commissionerships of districts, &c.\r\n\r\nPeshawur, the most remote portion of Northwest India, was throughout the\r\nperiod of the Revolt more troubled by marauding mountaineers than by\r\nrevolted sepoys. Very few Hindoos inhabited that region; the population\r\nwas mostly Mussulman, especially among the hills; and these followers of\r\nIslam had but little sympathy with those in Hindostan Proper. The\r\ndisturbances, such as they were, were of local character. In April, it\r\nbecame necessary to visit with some severity certain tribes which\r\nthroughout the winter had been engaged in rebellion and rapine. General\r\nCotton and Colonel Edwardes, two of the most trusted officers in the\r\nIndian army, collected a column at Nowsherah for service against the\r\nhill-men; and at the close of the month there were nearly four thousand\r\nmen in rendezvous, ready for service. It comprised detachments of H.M.\r\n81st and 98th foot; of the 8th, 9th, and 18th Punjaub infantry; of other\r\nnative infantry; of the 7th and 18th irregular cavalry; of the Guide\r\ncavalry; and of various artillery and engineer corps. On the 28th of the\r\nmonth, Cotton was at a place among the hills called Mungultana, a\r\nstronghold of some of the frontier fanatics. The place was easily taken,\r\nand the insurgents dispersed; as they were at Jelemkhana, Sitana, and\r\nother places, soon afterwards; but it was hard work for the troops, over\r\nvery bad roadless tracks in hot weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fort of Peshawur.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was a strange but hopeful sign that, amid all the sanguinary\r\nproceedings in India—the ruthless barbarities of some among the sepoys\r\nand rebels, and the military retributions wrought by the British—amid\r\nall this, the peaceful, civilising agency of railways was steadily\r\nthough slowly advancing. A recent chapter shewed that the grand\r\ntrunk-railway was extended into the Doab, the very hot-bed of\r\ninsurrection, during the month of March: the engineers, mechanics, and\r\nlabourers having been accustomed to resume their operations as soon as\r\nthe insurgents were driven away from any spot where the works were in\r\nprogress. In the Madras and Bombay presidencies, little affected by\r\nrebellion, various railways were gradually advancing; and now, in the\r\nmonth of April, the province of Sinde was to have its heyday of railway\r\nrejoicing. In an earlier portion of the volume,[169] a brief account was\r\ngiven of the schemes, present and prospective, for supplying India with\r\nrailways. Among those was one for a line, 120 miles in length, from\r\nKurachee to Hydrabad in Sinde: expected, if no difficulties intervened,\r\nto be finished towards the close of 1859. This was to be one link in a\r\nvast and extensive chain, if the hopes of its projectors were ever\r\nrealised. Kurachee is not at the mouth of the Indus; but it has an\r\nexcellent harbour, in which large merchantmen can cast anchor; and\r\nengineers were enabled to shew that a little over one hundred miles of\r\nrailway would connect this port with the Indus at a point above the\r\ndelta of that river, and just where Hydrabad, the chief city of Sinde,\r\nis situated. Such a railway would, in fact, bear a remarkably close\r\nanalogy to that in Egypt, from Alexandria to Cairo—each connecting a\r\nseaport with a capital, and avoiding delta navigation much impeded by\r\nshallows and shifting sands. From Hydrabad there are 570 miles of Indus\r\navailable for river-steaming up to Moultan, in the Punjaub. From that\r\ncity a railway would be planned through Lahore to Umritsir, where a\r\njunction would be formed with the grand trunk-line, and thus Kurachee\r\nconnected with Calcutta by rapid means of travel—a great scheme, worthy\r\nof the age and the country. It could, however, only have small\r\nbeginnings. On the 29th of April, the first sod of the ‘Sinde Railway’\r\nwas turned at Kurachee. It would be well if all rejoicings were based on\r\nsuch rational grounds as those which marked that day in the young\r\nAlexandria of Western India. Mr Frere, commissioner of Sinde, presided\r\nover the ceremonies. All was gaiety. The 51st regiment lent its aid in\r\nmilitary pomp; and all the notabilities of the place—political,\r\nmilitary, naval, clerical, commercial, and engineering—were gathered\r\ntogether. And not only so; but the lookers-on comprised many of those\r\nwho well marvelled what a railway could be, and how a carriage could\r\nmove without visible means of draught or propulsion—Parsees, Hindoos,\r\nBeloochees, Sindians, Afghans, Punjaubees—all were there, with their\r\npicturesque garments, and their little less picturesque native vehicles.\r\nHow the officiating dignitary turned the sod and wheeled the barrow; how\r\nthe band played and the people cheered; how the chief personages\r\ncelebrated the event by a dinner; how, at that dinner, a triumphant\r\nspecimen of confectionary was displayed, comprising sweetmeat Kurachees,\r\nCalcuttas, rivers, mosques, ghats, temples, wheelbarrows, pick-axes,\r\nrails, locomotives, bridges, tunnels—need not be told: they belong to\r\none remarkable aspect of modern European and American society, which\r\nbecomes doubly interesting when exhibited among the less active, more\r\nsensuous orientals.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to that stormy, unsettled region southwest of the Jumna,\r\ncomprising Bundelcund, Central India, and Rajpootana.\r\n\r\nProbably no commander had a series of more uninterrupted successes\r\nduring the wars of the mutiny than Sir Hugh Rose. Looking neither to\r\nCalcutta nor to the Punjaub, for aid, but relying on the resources of\r\nthe Bombay presidency, he gradually accumulated a force for service in\r\nCentral India which defeated the rebels wherever they were met with. We\r\nhave seen that, in January, Sir Hugh was busily engaged in defeating and\r\ndispersing rebels at Ratgurh, and in various parts of the district\r\nbetween Bhopal and Saugor. We find him in February relieving the British\r\ngarrison which had for so many months been shut up within the fort of\r\nthe last-named city, and then clearing a vast range of country in the\r\ndirection of Jhansi. Lastly, we have seen how, after subduing a district\r\nin which rebellious Mahrattas were very numerous, he approached nearer\r\nand nearer to Jhansi during the early weeks of March; that he arrived\r\nwithin a short distance of that city on the 21st of that month, with the\r\nsecond brigade of the Central India field-force; that the rebels\r\nfortified the walls of the town, and shut themselves up within the town\r\nand fort; that the mutinied sepoys and rebel Bundelas in the place were\r\ncomputed at eleven or twelve thousand; that the Ranee of Jhansi had left\r\nher palace to seek greater safety in the fort; that Rose’s first brigade\r\njoined him on the 25th; and that he then commenced the siege in a\r\ndetermined manner. From this point, the narrative of Sir Hugh’s\r\noperations may be carried into the following month.\r\n\r\nBefore the first week in April had terminated, this distinguished\r\ngeneral had gained very considerable advantages over the enemy. At\r\ndaybreak on the first of the month, his force encountered an army of the\r\nenemy outside the walls of Jhansi, and completely defeated them. The\r\nrebels were commanded by a Mahratta chieftain, Tanteea Topee, a relative\r\nof Nena Sahib, who had marched thither in the hope of being able to\r\nrelieve his brother rebels shut up within the beleaguered city. Sir Hugh\r\ndivided his force into two parts—one to continue the siege, and the\r\nother to meet Tanteea Topee in the field. The rebels, including among\r\ntheir number two regiments of the traitorous Gwalior Contingent, fought\r\ndesperately; but Rose succeeded in turning their left flank with\r\nartillery and cavalry, breaking up their array, and putting them to\r\nflight. It was a severe contest, for the rebels defended themselves\r\nindividually to the last, even when their order of battle was broken.\r\nRose pursued them to the river Betwah, and captured all their guns and\r\nammunition. During the pursuit, they endeavoured to check him by setting\r\nthe jungle on fire; but his cavalry and horse-artillery, nothing\r\ndaunted, galloped through the flames, and kept close at the heels of the\r\nfugitives. The whole line of retreat became strewed with dead bodies;\r\nand it was estimated that the day’s sanguinary work had cost the enemy\r\nnot less than fifteen hundred men.\r\n\r\nThis battle was followed by a result more favourable than Sir Hugh had\r\nventured to hope. The ranee, shut up within Jhansi, well knew that\r\nTanteea Topee was hastening to her assistance; for there was everywhere\r\nan intercommunication between the insurgents too close for the British\r\nto baffle. She knew of his approach, and hoped that he would be able to\r\ndefeat and drive away the besiegers; but the battle of the Betwah\r\ndismayed her, and the result was very favourable to the British. In\r\narranging for the siege, Sir Hugh divided his infantry into four\r\ndetachments, two on the right and two on the left. H.M. 86th, and the\r\n25th Bombay infantry, soon gained the walls, some by breach and others\r\nby escalade. Lieutenant Dartnell of the 86th, who was foremost in the\r\nassault, narrowly escaped being cut to pieces directly he entered the\r\nplace. These two regiments were on the left attack. The attack on the\r\nright was less successful, owing to the use of defective ladders; the\r\ntroops were for some time exposed to a murderous fire; but at length\r\nthey entered the place, and joined their companions near the ranee’s\r\npalace. A discovery was now made. The ranee had evacuated the place\r\nduring the night, with such of her troops as could break through the\r\ncordon which Rose endeavoured to draw round Jhansi. In the endeavour of\r\nthe garrison to escape, the slaughter was terrible; insomuch that,\r\nduring the storming of the fort and the pursuit of the garrison, more\r\nthan three thousand of the rebels were laid low, besides the fifteen\r\nhundred during the battle. Much of this slaughter was within the city\r\nitself; for the towns-people were believed to have favoured the rebels,\r\nand the soldiers took severe vengeance before their officers could check\r\nthe bloodshed. All this stern fighting could not be carried on without\r\nloss on the part of the British. Sir Hugh had to lament the fall of\r\nLieutenant-colonel Turnbull, Captain Sinclair, Lieutenants Meicklejohn\r\nand Park, and Dr Stack, besides a number of non-commissioned officers\r\nand privates. The evacuation of the place in so sudden a way greatly\r\nlessened his chance of loss, for its defence might have been long\r\ncontinued. ‘Jhansi,’ he said in his telegraphic dispatch, ‘is not a\r\nfort, but its strength makes it a fortress; it could not have been\r\nbreached; it could only have been taken by mining and blowing up one\r\nbastion after another.’\r\n\r\nAfter this signal defeat of the rebels at Jhansi, the victorious army of\r\nSir Hugh gradually prepared to move towards Calpee, a town on the Jumna,\r\non the line of road from Jhansi to Cawnpore. Symptoms appeared to shew\r\nthat a struggle would take place at this spot. Two rebel leaders made\r\nrenewed exertions to regain lost ground in that region. The chief of\r\nthese was Tanteea Topee, lately defeated at Jhansi; he had with him two\r\nmutinied infantry regiments, seven hundred cavalry, a large following of\r\nGhazees or fanatics, and twelve guns. The other was Ram Rao Gobind, who\r\nhad the command of three thousand rabble and four guns. These two\r\nleaders resolved to act on some common plan; and Sir Hugh Rose equally\r\nresolved to defeat them. Nevertheless this gallant officer had much need\r\nfor careful planning long after he was master of Jhansi. He had a large\r\nnumber of sick and wounded, whose safety it would be necessary to\r\nprovide for; and the roads around that city were still infested with\r\nremnants of the Kotah rebels and the Chanderee garrison. He himself\r\nremained at Jhansi until such time as he could resume his march without\r\ndanger to those left behind; but he gave active employment to portions\r\nof his force. About the middle of the month he sent Major Orr with a\r\ncolumn from Jhansi across the Betwah to Mhow, to clear that part of the\r\ncountry of rebels, and afterwards to join Rose and the main body of the\r\nforce on the road to Calpee; the major had many small encounters with\r\nthe rajahs of Bampore and Shagurh, and with detached parties of rebels.\r\nSome days afterwards, on the 21st, Sir Hugh despatched Major Gall, with\r\ndetachments of cavalry and artillery, to a point on the Calpee road, to\r\nwatch the enemy and aid Major Orr if necessary. Gall, besides other\r\nminor engagements, captured a fort belonging to the Rajah of Sumpter;\r\nthe rebels in it proved to be disguised mutineers of the 12th Bengal\r\nnative infantry, who fought desperately until all were killed. Sir Hugh,\r\nwith his first brigade and head-quarters, did not take his departure\r\nfrom Jhansi until the 25th. He marched ten miles that day to Boregaum,\r\non the Calpee road, and resumed his progress on subsequent days. His\r\nsecond brigade was soon to follow him—with the exception of detachments\r\nof the 3d Bombay Europeans, the 24th Bombay native infantry, and\r\nartillery, left under the charge of Colonel Liddell to protect Jhansi\r\nand the sick and wounded. Rumours reached Sir Hugh that four of the\r\nrebel leaders—the Ranee of Jhansi, Tanteea Topee, the Rajah of Shagurh,\r\nand the Rajah of Bampore—with seven thousand men and four guns, intended\r\nif possible to intercept him, and prevent his march to Calpee. To what\r\nresult all these manœuvres on both sides led, was left to the month of\r\nMay to determine.\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were going on in and near the Jhansi district,\r\nGeneral Whitlock, with a column of Madras troops, was engaged a little\r\nfurther eastward, in a district of Bundelcund having Banda for its chief\r\ntown. He was frequently in contact with large or small bodies of rebels.\r\nOne of these struggles took place on the 19th of April, when he\r\nencountered a force of seven thousand insurgents headed by the Nawab of\r\nBanda. Whitlock defeated the Nawab, captured Banda, killed five hundred\r\nof the enemy, and took several guns. After this victory, he gradually\r\nworked his way towards Calpee, to aid in Rose’s operations.\r\n\r\nThe city of Saugor remained in a somewhat peculiar condition during the\r\nspring months—secure itself, but surrounded by a disturbed district. The\r\nEuropean residents were living in cantonments, sufficiently protected by\r\ntroops left there by General Whitlock after he relieved the place early\r\nin February. These troops were neither stationary nor idle; the vicinity\r\nwas swarming with rebels and malcontents, whom it was necessary to check\r\nby frequent pursuit and defeat. Those two exceptions to the generally\r\nmutinous condition of the Bengal native army, the 31st and 42d\r\nregiments, still remained in and near Saugor—or such portions of them as\r\nhad not become tainted by insubordination. Divided into small\r\ndetachments, they assisted the European and Madras troops in keeping\r\nopen the line of communication between Saugor and the district marked by\r\nthe victorious operations of Sir Hugh Rose.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Mahratta and Rajpootana states, we find that, on the 2d\r\nof April, a large body of rebels, many thousands in number, with ten\r\nguns, crossed the Parbuttee river at Copoind into Scindia’s Gwalior\r\nterritory. They were fleeing from Kotah, where a British force had\r\nseverely handled them. Scindia still remained true to his alliance. Many\r\nof his officers, each with a small force, opposed the rebels at\r\ndifferent points, drove them back across the river, and overturned many\r\nof their guns and wagons in the stream. The rebels, accompanied by large\r\nnumbers of women and children, made their way by other routes towards\r\nBundelcund.\r\n\r\nKotah, just mentioned, was closely connected with the insurgent and\r\nmilitary operations in Rajpootana. It will be remembered[170] that in\r\nthe month of March General Roberts, commanding the Rajpootana\r\nfield-force, marched from Nuseerabad towards Kotah, accompanied by\r\nRichard Lawrence as political representative; that many difficulties had\r\nto be surmounted on the march; that Kotah was reached on the 22d; and\r\nthat Roberts captured that place just before the end of the month,\r\ndefeating a large body of rebels, and obtaining possession of an\r\nextensive store of ordnance and ammunition. After this victory, Roberts\r\nremained a long time at Kotah. Many other places would have welcomed his\r\nappearance; but there were doubts how far Kotah could safely be left,\r\nseeing that the neighbourhood was in a very disaffected state. The Kotah\r\nrebels, on the other hand, were greatly disconcerted at the news of the\r\nfall of Jhansi, which interfered with their plans and hopes. They had\r\nbeen camping for a while at Kularus, on the road from Gwalior to Bombay,\r\nbut began now to move off towards the south. Captain Mayne, with some of\r\nScindia’s troops, was at that place on the 11th of April, and found that\r\nthe Kotah rebels, about four thousand strong, with six guns, had joined\r\nthe rebel Rajah of Nirwur, six miles distant. Captain Mayne was\r\npreparing to watch and follow them, but the troops at his command\r\nconsisted of only a few hundred men, and he could do little more than\r\nreconnoitre. Later in the month, General Roberts organised a column to\r\nlook after the rebels at Goonah, Chupra, and other places. The column\r\nconsisted of H.M. 95th foot, the 10th Bombay native infantry, a wing of\r\nthe 8th hussars, a wing of the 1st lancers, and a troop of\r\nhorse-artillery; and it started from Kotah for active service on the\r\n24th. Thus the month of April passed away; Roberts himself remaining at\r\nKotah; while some of his officers, each with a detachment of the\r\nRajpootana field-force, were engaged in chastising bodies of rebels in\r\nthe turbulent region on the border of the Rajpoot and Mahratta\r\nterritories. Like Sir Hugh Rose at Jhansi, he had to consider how his\r\nconquered city would fare if he quitted it.\r\n\r\nThe province of Gujerat, lying as it does between Rajpootana and Bombay,\r\nwas narrowly watched by the government of that presidency; and as one\r\nprecaution, all the inhabitants were disarmed. On the 8th of April, a\r\nfield-force, comprising about a thousand men of all arms, left Ahmedabad\r\nto conduct the disarming. Another column of about the same strength was\r\npreparing to march from the same station about a week later. It was\r\nexpected that the difficulties of the troops would arise, not so much\r\nfrom the opposition of the natives, as from the gradually increasing\r\nheat of the weather.\r\n\r\nSouthward of Bombay there was still, as in the earlier months of the\r\nyear, just so much of insubordination as to need careful watching on the\r\npart of the government, but without presenting any very alarming\r\nsymptoms. The small Mahratta state of Satara was a little troubled. Two\r\nofficers of the recently deposed rajah, his commander-in-chief and his\r\ncommandant of artillery, were detected in treasonable correspondence\r\nwith Nena Sahib. One of them, having been found guilty, was sentenced to\r\nbe hanged; the indignity struck with horror one imbued with high-caste\r\nnotions, and he asked to be blown away from a gun as a more noble death;\r\nthis was refused; and under the influence of dismay and grief, he made a\r\nconfession which afforded a clue to a further conspiracy. There was much\r\nin these southern Mahrattas which puzzled the authorities. To what\r\nextent the natives were bound into a brotherhood by secret compact, the\r\nEnglish never could and never did know. Much comment was excited by an\r\noccurrence at Kolapore, where two native officers were blown away from\r\nguns, on conviction of being concerned in the mutiny and rebellion. It\r\nwas remembered that those very men had sat on courts-martial which\r\ncondemned numbers of their fellow-mutineers to the same punishment which\r\nwas their own ultimate doom. One of the principal witnesses against them\r\nwas a colleague whom they had sentenced to death, but who escaped by\r\nmaking a confession which implicated them. Many others, however,\r\ncondemned by the court of which these two men were members, died without\r\nmaking a similar confession, although it was believed that they also\r\nmight have implicated their judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Native Police of India._—So peculiar was the position of the native\r\n  police of India—as a medium between the military and the civilians,\r\n  and between the government and the people—that it may be desirable\r\n  to say a few words on the organisation of that body. All parties\r\n  agreed that this organisation was defective in many points, and\r\n  numerous reforms were suggested; but the Revolt found the police\r\n  system still in force unreformed. The information here given is\r\n  obtained chiefly from a dispatch sent from the India House about six\r\n  months before the Revolt began, at a time when few or none saw the\r\n  dark shadow that was hovering over our eastern empire.\r\n\r\n  In Bengal, each district was subdivided into smaller jurisdictions,\r\n  each having its local police. The police were charged with duties\r\n  both preventive and detective. They were prohibited from inquiring\r\n  into cases of a petty nature; but complaints in cases of a more\r\n  serious character were usually laid before the police\r\n  _darogah_—whose duties were something more than those of an English\r\n  police superintendent, something less than those of an English\r\n  magistrate. The darogah was authorised to examine the complaints\r\n  brought before him, to issue process of arrest, to summon witnesses,\r\n  to examine the accused, and to forward the case to the magistrate or\r\n  collector-magistrate, or submit a report of his proceedings,\r\n  according as the evidence seemed to warrant the one or the other\r\n  course.\r\n\r\n  In the Northwest Provinces the native revenue-officers called\r\n  _tehsildars_ were, at the discretion of the government, invested\r\n  with the powers of police darogahs; whereas in Bengal the revenue\r\n  service was kept wholly distinct from the police or magisterial.\r\n\r\n  In the Madras presidency, the duties ordinarily performed in Bengal\r\n  by the police darogahs were, even more generally than in the\r\n  Northwest Provinces, performed by the tehsildar; indeed it was a\r\n  recognised part of the system that the tehsildar and the darogah\r\n  were the same person. This double function carried with it an\r\n  increase of power. The Madras tehsildar-darogah was authorised, not\r\n  only to inquire into petty cases (which the Bengal darogah was\r\n  prohibited from doing), but also to proceed in certain specified\r\n  instances to judgment, sentence, and the infliction of punishment.\r\n\r\n  In the Bombay presidency, the revenue and police functions were,\r\n  until a recent period, combined in the same way as in Madras. The\r\n  tehsildars, besides their revenue duties, were authorised in their\r\n  police capacity to investigate all complaints of a criminal nature,\r\n  and to exercise a penal jurisdiction in respect of certain petty\r\n  offences. Within a few months before the Revolt, however, a change\r\n  was made in the organisation. A new officer, a superintendent of\r\n  police, was placed under the magistrate. The magistrate, confining\r\n  himself for the most part to judicial and administrative matters,\r\n  left to his superintendent of police the control of the executive\r\n  police and the command of the entire stipendiary body, with the\r\n  initiative in the prevention and detection of crime. To aid this\r\n  superintendent in the supervision of the district police, there was\r\n  placed in each police division an officer called joint-police\r\n  _amildar_; whose duties, in regard to the preservation of the public\r\n  peace and the investigation of serious crimes, were nearly similar\r\n  to those of the Bengal darogah, but without including any power of\r\n  punishing even for the most trivial offences.\r\n\r\n  It thus appears that, apart from the penal powers exercised by the\r\n  Madras district police, the Bengal _darogah_, the Madras\r\n  _tehsildar_, and the Bombay _amildar_, all acted to a certain extent\r\n  judicially when engaged in investigating crimes of a serious nature.\r\n  They examined the parties and the evidence, and they formed a\r\n  judgment on the case to the extent of deciding whether it was one\r\n  for the immediate arrest of the accused and transmission to the\r\n  magistrate, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  No doubt the founders of this police system anticipated beneficial\r\n  results from it; but those results were not obtained. It was very\r\n  inefficient for the detection of crime, and almost useless for\r\n  prevention. There were defects both in organisation and in\r\n  procedure. The police force attached to each division was too much\r\n  localised and isolated; and the notion of combination between any\r\n  separate parts of it, with a view of accomplishing extensive police\r\n  objects, was seldom entertained. Although unable to check crime to\r\n  the extent intended and hoped for, the police were very unscrupulous\r\n  in their mode of wielding their authority, and bore a very general\r\n  character for oppression and corruption. The great source of\r\n  mischief was found to be, the want of efficient control and\r\n  overlooking. The native police had a proneness to oriental modes of\r\n  administering justice, in which bribery and barbarity perform a\r\n  great part: this tendency required to be constantly checked by\r\n  Europeans; and if the magistrate or collector-magistrate found his\r\n  time too fully occupied to exercise this supervision, the police\r\n  wrought much mischief, and brought the English ‘raj’ into disfavour.\r\n  Where the district was smaller than usual, or where the magistrate\r\n  was more than commonly zealous and active, the police were found to\r\n  be more efficient through more supervision. Whenever it was found\r\n  necessary to grapple effectually with any particular crimes, such as\r\n  _thuggee_ or _dacoitee_, the ordinary police proved to be wholly\r\n  useless; an entirely separate instrumentality was needed. Besides\r\n  the want of effective supervision, the native police were underpaid,\r\n  and had therefore an excuse for listening to the temptations of\r\n  bribery.\r\n\r\n  In the dispatch already adverted to, written by the Court of\r\n  Directors, a course of improvement was pointed out, without which\r\n  the native police, it was affirmed, could not rise to the proper\r\n  degree of efficiency. The suggestions were briefly as follows: To\r\n  separate the police from the administration of the land-revenue, in\r\n  those provinces where those duties had been customarily united; in\r\n  order that the native officer should not be intrusted with double\r\n  functions, each of which would interfere with the other. To subject\r\n  all the police to frequent visit and inspection, that they might\r\n  feel the influence of a vigilant eye over them. To relieve the\r\n  collector-magistrate from this addition to his many duties, by\r\n  appointing in each district a European officer with no other duty\r\n  than that of managing the police of the district, subject to a\r\n  general superintendent of police for each presidency. To increase\r\n  the salaries of the police, in order that the office might have a\r\n  higher dignity in the estimation of the natives, and in order that\r\n  the official might be less tempted to extortion or bribery. To\r\n  empower the authorities to punish and degrade, more readily than was\r\n  before possible, those police who oppressed the people or otherwise\r\n  displayed injustice; and to reward those who displayed more than\r\n  ordinary intelligence and honesty, a further suggestion was made,\r\n  arising out of the organisation of the Punjaub under the Lawrences\r\n  and their coadjutors; in which there was a preventive police with a\r\n  military organisation, and a wholly distinct detective police with a\r\n  civil organisation. This system was found to work so well, that the\r\n  Court of Directors submitted to the Calcutta government an inquiry\r\n  whether the police generally might not with advantage be thus\r\n  separated into two parts, preventive and detective, each exercised\r\n  by a different set of men.\r\n\r\n  The Revolt broke out before the reform of the police system could\r\n  commence; and then, like other reforms, it was left to be settled in\r\n  more peaceful days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  The following will give an idea of the mode in which the _Gazette_\r\n  announcements were made: ‘24th Bombay N. I.—Lieutenant William\r\n  Alexander Kerr; date of act of bravery, July 10, 1857.—On the breaking\r\n  out of a mutiny in the 27th Bombay N. I. in July 1857, a party of the\r\n  mutineers took up a position in the stronghold or _paga_ near the town\r\n  of Kolapore, and defended themselves to extremity. “Lieutenant Kerr,\r\n  of the Southern Mahratta Irregular Horse, took a prominent share in\r\n  the attack on the position; and at the moment when its capture was of\r\n  great public importance, he made a dash at one of the gateways, with\r\n  some dismounted horsemen, and forced an entrance by breaking down the\r\n  gate. The attack was completely successful, and the defenders were\r\n  either killed, wounded, or captured—a result that may with perfect\r\n  justice be attributed to Lieutenant Kerr’s dashing and devoted\r\n  bravery.” (Letter from the Political Superintendent at Kolapore to the\r\n  Adjutant-general of the Army, dated September 10, 1857.)’\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  ‘Of the dust it is quite beyond the powers of writing to give a\r\n  description. It is so fine and subtle, that long after the causes\r\n  which raised it have ceased to exert their influence, you may see it\r\n  like a veil of gauze between your eyes and every object. The sun,\r\n  while yet six or seven degrees above the horizon, is hid from sight by\r\n  it as though the luminary were enveloped in a thick fog; and at early\r\n  morning and evening, this vapour of dust suspended high in air seems\r\n  like a rain-cloud clinging to a hillside. When this dust is set\r\n  rapidly in motion by a hot wind, and when the grosser sand, composed\r\n  of minute fragments of talc, scales of mica, and earth, is impelled in\r\n  quick successive waves through the heated atmosphere, the effect is\r\n  quite sufficient to make one detest India for ever. Every article in\r\n  your tent, your hair, eyes, and nose, are filled and covered with this\r\n  dust, which deposits a coating half an inch thick all over the\r\n  tent.’—W. H. RUSSELL.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  It may here be remarked that the difficulty of moving heavy ordnance\r\n  over the bad roads and roadless tracts of India, painfully felt by the\r\n  artillery officers engaged in the war, suggested to the East India\r\n  Company an inquiry into the possibility of employing locomotives for\r\n  such a purpose. A machine, called ‘Boydell’s Traction Engine,’\r\n  patented some time before in England, was tested with a view to\r\n  ascertain the degree of its availability for this purpose. The\r\n  peculiarity of this engine was, that it was a locomotive _carrying its\r\n  own railway_. Six flat boards were ranged round each of the great\r\n  wheels in such a way that each board came in succession _under_ the\r\n  wheel, and formed, for a few feet, a flat plankroad or tramway for the\r\n  wheel to roll upon. It was supposed that the vehicle would move much\r\n  more easily by this contrivance, than if the narrow periphery of the\r\n  wheel ran upon soft mud or irregular pebbles and gravel. The motion of\r\n  the wheel placed each plank down at its proper time and place, and\r\n  lifted it up again, in such a way that there was always one of the\r\n  boards flat on the ground, beneath the wheel. Colonel Sir Frederick\r\n  Abbott and Colonel Sir Proby Cautley, on the part of the directors,\r\n  tested this machine at Woolwich—where it drew forty tons of ordnance\r\n  along a common road, uphill as well as upon the level. Another\r\n  road-locomotive, by Messrs Napier, was tested for a similar purpose.\r\n  The results were of good augury for the future; but the machines were\r\n  not perfected early enough to be made applicable for the wars of the\r\n  mutiny.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  ‘_Allahabad, April 30._—It is the melancholy duty of the Right\r\n  Honourable the Governor-general to announce the death of that most\r\n  distinguished officer, Captain Sir William Peel, K.C.B., late in\r\n  command of her Majesty’s ship _Shannon_, and of the Naval Brigade in\r\n  the Northwest Provinces.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir William Peel died at Cawnpore, on the 27th instant, of small-pox.\r\n  He had been wounded at the commencement of the last advance upon\r\n  Lucknow, but had nearly recovered from the wound, and was on his way\r\n  to Calcutta, when struck by the disease which has brought his\r\n  honourable career to an early close.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir William Peel’s services in the field during the last seven months\r\n  are well known in India and in England.

Into how many thousands of families mourning had been\r\nintroduced by it, no one correctly knew; the problem was a dismal one,\r\nwhich few had the heart to investigate. Those who, not affected by\r\nprivate grief, or hiding their grief in a sense of public duty, viewed\r\nthe twelvemonth’s conflict in a national sense, saw in it a mingled\r\ncause for humiliation and pride—humiliation that British rule should be\r\nso trampled on by those who had been long and peacefully under it; pride\r\nthat so many public servants, so many private persons, should have\r\nproved worthy of their country in a time of severe and bitter trial. In\r\nmilitary matters, the once great Bengal native army had almost ceased to\r\nexist. Twenty thousand disarmed sepoys were in and near the Punjaub,\r\ncarefully watched lest they should join the ranks of the insurgents;\r\ndisarmed regiments were similarly detained elsewhere; others had been\r\nalmost annihilated by twelve months of fierce warfare; others were still\r\nengaged as the nuclei of rebel armies; while the number of Bengal sepoys\r\nwas very small indeed, reckoned by hundreds rather than thousands, who\r\nstill fought faithfully on the side of the British. The Madras and\r\nBombay troops had, happily for India and England’s interest therein,\r\nremained almost wholly ‘true to their salt;’ enabling the governors of\r\nthose two presidencies to send gallant field-forces into the disturbed\r\nnorthern and central provinces. Sikhs, Punjaubees, Moultanese,\r\nScindians, Beloochees, and hill-men on the Afghan frontier, had rendered\r\nservices of such lasting importance in Hindostan, that they may almost\r\nbe regarded as the preservers of the English ‘raj;’ this they had been\r\nenabled to do from two causes—the want of sympathy between the mutineers\r\nand those northwestern tribes; and the admirable system of Punjaub\r\ngovernment organised by the Lawrences. In civil matters, India had\r\nwitnessed the almost total breaking up of the ordinary revenue and\r\nmagisterial arrangements, in provinces containing at least fifty\r\nmillions of souls; Europeans driven into hiding-places, even if not\r\nmurdered; and treasuries plundered by bands of ruffians, who gladly\r\nhailed the state of anarchy brought on by the mutiny of the sepoy\r\nregiments. Among the superior members of the government, Viscount\r\nCanning still maintained his position, battling against unnumbered\r\ndifficulties; Sir Colin Campbell still remained at the head of the army,\r\nwell aware that his utmost skill as a military commander would long be\r\nneeded; and Sir John Lawrence still held the Punjaub in his wonderful\r\ngrasp, displaying governing powers of the very highest order at an\r\neminently critical time. On the other hand, the Anglo-Indians had to\r\nmourn over a sad death-list. Henry Lawrence, Havelock, Colvin, Neill,\r\nVenables, Nicholson, William Peel, Adrian Hope, Wheeler, Barnard, Banks,\r\nBattye—all, and a vast many more gallant spirits, had sunk under the\r\nterrible pressure of the past twelve months.\r\n\r\nAppropriating the present chapter to a rapid glance at the progress of\r\nevents in the month of May, and beginning (as usual) with the Bengal\r\nregions, we may conveniently notice two or three arrangements made by\r\nthe Calcutta government, bearing relation either to the state of the\r\narmy, or to the condition of civilians affected by the mutiny.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest measures taken to reconstruct the Bengal army, so\r\nshattered by the mutiny, was one announced in a government notification\r\non the 7th of May. It was to the effect that four regiments of Bengal\r\n_European_ cavalry should be formed, in lieu of eight regiments of\r\nBengal _native_ cavalry, erased from the list of the establishment for\r\nmutinous conduct. Each regiment was to consist of 1 colonel, 2\r\nlieutenant-colonels, 2 majors, 14 captains, 18 lieutenants, 8 cornets, 1\r\nadjutant, 1 interpreter and quartermaster, 4 surgeons and assistants,\r\n119 non-commissioned and subordinate officers of various kinds, and 700\r\nprivates; making a total of 870—an unusually large number for a cavalry\r\nregiment. In addition to these, there were to be native syces,\r\ngrass-cutters, and quarter-masters, attached to each regiment; and\r\nvarious persons employed at the depôt. The pay was to be the same as in\r\nthe royal dragoon regiments. Each regiment was to be divided into ten\r\ntroops. As the officers were to be about doubly as numerous as the\r\nEnglish officers in the disbanded native regiments, it was calculated\r\nthat the four new would absorb the officers of eight old regiments. The\r\nregiments thus extinguished by this first process, were the 1st, 2d, 3d,\r\n4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th Bengal native cavalry; the 5th and the 8th\r\nwere left to be dealt with at some subsequent period. As for any larger\r\nmeasures connected with the reconstruction of a _native_ Bengal army,\r\nthese were left for determination at a later period, after collating the\r\nopinions of the most experienced authorities in India.\r\n\r\nThe distress experienced by the British troops from the intense heat of\r\nthe Indian sun, and the severe strictures passed by the press and by\r\nmembers of the legislature on those regimental officers who permitted or\r\ncompelled their soldiers to swelter in red cloth, led to the issuing of\r\norders concerning light summer clothing. It was found that a kind of\r\ngray or dust-coloured linen called _khakee_ or _carkey_ was better\r\nsuited than anything else—even white—as a material for clothing in the\r\nhot season; and hence the issuing of an order by the adjutant-general,\r\non the 21st of May, to the effect noted below.[171] This question\r\nconcerning appropriate clothing had long been discussed by military men\r\nin India: the officers of greatest experience being those who most\r\ndisapproved the wearing of closely fitting garments in such a climate.\r\nGeneral Jacob had resolutely contended against the adoption of English\r\nuniforms by the sepoys of the Company’s army. He said: ‘A sepoy of the\r\nline, dressed in a tight coat; trousers in which he can scarcely walk,\r\nand cannot stoop at all; bound to an immense and totally useless\r\nknapsack, so that he can scarcely breathe; strapped, belted, and\r\npipe-clayed within an inch of his life; with a rigid basket-shako on his\r\nhead, which requires the skill of a juggler to balance, and which cuts\r\ndeep into his brow if worn for an hour; and with a leather-stock round\r\nhis neck, to complete his absurd costume—when compared with the same\r\nsepoy, clothed, armed, and accoutred solely with regard to his comfort\r\nand efficiency—forms the most perfect example of what is madly called\r\nthe “regular” system with many European officers, contrasted with the\r\nsystem of common sense now recommended for adoption.’ The graphic\r\ndescription by Mr Russell, of the officers and men in Sir Colin\r\nCampbell’s army of Oude, shews how eager soldiers are to get rid of\r\ntheir irksome uniforms when permitted, under the influence of a heat\r\ndenoted by the cabalistic mark 100° F. or 110° F.: ‘Except the\r\nHighlanders—and when they left Lucknow they were panting for their\r\nsummer clothes, and had sent officers to Cawnpore to hurry them—not a\r\ncorps that I have seen sport a morsel of pink or shew a fragment of\r\nEnglish scarlet. The Highlanders wear eccentric shades of gray linen\r\nover their bonnets—the kilt is discarded, or worn out in some regiments;\r\nand flies, mosquitoes, and the sun are fast rendering it impossible in\r\nthe others. Already many officers who can get trews have discarded the\r\nponderous folds of woollen stuff tucked into massive wads over the hips,\r\nand have provided some defence against the baking of their calves by\r\nday, and have sought to protect their persons against the assaults of\r\ninnumerable entomological enemies by night. The artillery had been\r\nfurnished with excellent head-covers and good frocks of light stuff....\r\nThe 7th Hussars, the Military Train, have vestiary idiosyncrasies of\r\ntheir own; but there is some sort of uniformity among the men. Among the\r\nofficers, individual taste and fantasy have full play. The infantry\r\nregiments, for the most part, are dressed in linen frocks, dyed carkey\r\nor gray slate-colour—slate-blue trousers, and shakos protected by\r\npuggerees, or linen covers, from the sun. The peculiarity of carkey is\r\nthat the dyer seems to be unable to match it in any two pieces, and that\r\nit exhibits endless varieties of shade, varying with every washing, so\r\nthat the effect is rather various than pleasing on the march or on the\r\nparade-ground. But the officers, as I have said, do not confine\r\nthemselves to carkey or anything else. It is really wonderful what\r\nfecundity of invention in dress there is, after all, in the British mind\r\nwhen its talents can be properly developed. To begin with the\r\nhead-dress. The favourite wear is a helmet of varying shape, but of\r\nuniform ugliness.... Whatever it might be in polished steel or burnished\r\nmetal, the helmet is a decided failure in felt, or wicker-work, or pith,\r\nso far as external effect is concerned. It is variously fabricated, with\r\nmany varieties of interior ducts and passages leading to escape-holes\r\nfor imaginary hot air in the front or top, and around it are twisted\r\ninfinite colours and forms of turbans with fringed ends and laced\r\nfringes. When a peacock’s feather, with the iris end displayed, is\r\ninserted in the hole in the top of the helmet, or is stuck in the\r\npuggeree around it, the effect of the covering is much enhanced; and\r\nthis style is rather patronised by some of the staff. The coat may be of\r\nany cut or material, but shooting-jackets hold their own in the highest\r\nposts; and a carkey-coloured jerkin, with a few inches of iron\r\ncurb-chain sewed on the shoulders to resist sabre-cuts, is a general\r\nfavourite.... As to the clothing of the nether man, nothing but a series\r\nof photographs could give the least notion of the numerous combinations\r\nwhich can be made out of a leg, leather, pantaloons, and small-clothes.\r\nLong stage-boots of buff-coloured leather—for the manufacture of which\r\nCawnpore is famous—pulled up over knee-breeches of leather or regimental\r\ntrousers, are common. There are officers who prefer wearing their\r\nWellingtons outside their pantaloons, thus exhibiting tops of very\r\nbright colours; and the boot and baggy trousers of the Zouave officer\r\nare not unknown.’\r\n\r\nThe next point to be adverted to affected civilians and private traders\r\nmore extensively than the military. The compensation to sufferers by the\r\nmutiny, a much-disputed question for nearly twelve months, was put into\r\na train for settlement by a government order issued at Calcutta in May.\r\nThis order applied to Bengal only, as being a region quite large enough\r\nto be brought within one set of official rules. The compensation was to\r\nbe for loss of property and effects, leaving losses affecting life or\r\nhealth to be settled by a distinct machinery. A Mr E. Jackson was\r\nappointed at Calcutta as commissioner to inquire into claims for\r\ncompensation. A limit was named, the 26th of August, after which no\r\nclaims would be received from persons resident in India: an extension of\r\ntime being allowed for those who were not in that country. In cases\r\nwhere the amount claimed did not exceed fifty thousand rupees, the\r\napplication to the commissioner was to be accompanied by a detailed\r\nstatement of the particulars of the claim, and of the evidence adducible\r\nin support of it; but where the property was of higher amount, the\r\nregulation required only a general estimate to accompany the\r\napplication, a further period of three months being allowed for the\r\npreparation and submission of the detailed statement of losses. It was\r\nat the same time very pointedly mentioned that these preliminary\r\noperations did not constitute an actual _claim_ on the Company for any\r\ncompensation whatever. ‘It is to be understood that the registry of\r\napplications above provided for does not imply any recognition of claims\r\nto compensation; the Honourable Court of Directors having expressly\r\nreserved their final decision upon the question, whether or not\r\ncompensation for losses sustained by the mutiny shall be awarded.’ The\r\nCompany probably deemed it wise, in the uncertainty how large might be\r\nthe total aggregate sum claimed, to avoid any formal pledge that these\r\ncompensations could be rightfully demanded and would be really paid. The\r\nabove, we have said, applied to Bengal; but about the same time a\r\nsimilar notification appeared at Allahabad, applicable to the Northwest\r\nProvinces. Mr C. Grant and Mr E. H. Longden were named commissioners to\r\nrecord and register claims. The conditions were generally the same as\r\nthose in Bengal; and to them was added an announcement that\r\n‘Applications will be received, subject to the same rules, from natives\r\nof the country for compensation, on account of loss of property caused\r\nby their known loyalty and attachment to the British government.’ A\r\nsimilar announcement was afterwards made, extending the boon to the\r\nprovince of Oude.\r\n\r\nSuperadded to the arrangements made for the succour of those who had\r\nborne pecuniary loss by the mutiny, was one dated May 25th. This was to\r\nthe effect that some provision would be made for the relief of the\r\ndestitute families of persons who had died after the loss of their\r\nproperty, even though the death were not occasioned by the mutiny. It\r\nwas thereupon determined that grants of money should be given to\r\nfamilies rendered impoverished by this double calamity; the grants to be\r\nregulated on the same principle as those allowed to European and native\r\nofficers of the government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DACCA.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the resolutions arrived at by the authorities at Calcutta gave\r\nvery general satisfaction—except to a few officers jealous of any\r\nencroachments on the privileges of the army. Whether suggested at home,\r\nor in India, the movement was in the right direction. The regulation was\r\nto the effect that civilians who had distinguished themselves in the\r\nfield since the commencement of the mutiny, or who should so distinguish\r\nthemselves before the mutiny ended, should be allowed to participate in\r\nthe honours which had hitherto been considered peculiar to the military\r\nservice. The civil servants of the Company, as a body, greatly raised\r\nthemselves in the estimation of the nation by the gallantry which many\r\nof them displayed under circumstances of great peril—not only in\r\ndefending their posts against large bodies of insurgents, but in sharing\r\nthose field and siege operations which are more immediately sources of\r\nhonour to military men. What those honours were to be, depended partly\r\non the crown, partly on the Company; but the object of the order was to\r\nshew that the civil position of a gallant man should not necessarily be\r\na bar to his occupancy of an honoured place among military men.\r\n\r\nIn entering now upon the military operations of the month, it is\r\nsatisfactory to know that nothing important presents itself for record\r\nin connection with the eastern regions of Bengal. There were few or no\r\nactual mutinies, for reasons more than once assigned in former chapters.\r\nNotwithstanding this safety, however—partly through the superstitious\r\ncharacter of the natives of India, and partly through the uneasy feeling\r\nprevailing in the minds of Europeans during the mutiny—the newspapers\r\nwere frequently engaged in discussing mysteries, rumours, and prophecies\r\nof a strange character. One, connected more with Bengal than with the\r\nother provinces, related to ‘something white,’ which was to be ominous\r\nof British rule in India. Where it arose, or how, remained as\r\nundiscoverable as the chupatty mystery; but the rumour put on various\r\nforms at different times and places. At Tipperah, the native story told\r\nof a ‘white thing’ which would be unprocurable after some time. At\r\nChittagong, a particular day was named, when, ‘out of four things, three\r\nwould be given and one withheld;’ and at Jessore, the bazaar-people\r\nbecame so excited concerning a prophetic rumour of an equally\r\nenigmatical kind, that the magistrate endeavoured to elicit something\r\nfrom his police-darogah that might explain it; but the man either could\r\nnot or would not tell how the story arose. In Dacca and other places the\r\nprediction assumed this form—that after a certain period, a certain\r\n‘white thing’ would cease to exist in India; and in some instances the\r\nexact interval was named, ‘three months and thirteen days.’\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the authorities found it necessary to watch very closely\r\nthe proceedings of Mohammedan fanatics; who, at Burdwan, Jessore,\r\nRungpoor, and other places, were detected in attempts to rouse up the\r\npeople to a religious war. Fortunately, the townsmen and villagers did\r\nnot respond to these appeals. Southwest of Calcutta, the Sumbhulpore\r\ndistrict, disturbed occasionally by rebel bands intent on plunder, was\r\nkept for the most part tranquil by the firm management of Colonel\r\nForster. In the month of May he hit upon the plan of inviting the still\r\nfaithful chieftains of the districts to furnish each a certain number of\r\nsoldiers to defend British interests, on promise of a due recognition of\r\ntheir services afterwards. The chieftains raised two thousand\r\nmatchlockmen among them, and took up such positions as Colonel Forster\r\nindicated—a measure which completely frustrated and cowed the rebels.\r\n\r\nWe may pass at once to a consideration of the state of affairs in Behar\r\nor Western Bengal, comprising the districts around what may be called\r\nthe Middle Ganges. This region, as former chapters have sufficiently\r\ntold, and as a glance at a map will at once shew, contains many\r\nimportant cities and towns, which were thrown into great commotion by\r\nthe mutiny—such as Patna, Dinapoor, Arrah, Buxar, Azimghur, Goruckpore,\r\nGhazeepore, Jounpoor, Sasseram, Benares, Chunargur, and Mirzapore. It is\r\ntrue that many of these were formerly included within the government of\r\nthe ‘Northwest Provinces,’ and then in that of the ‘Central Provinces;’\r\nbut this is a matter of little consequence to our present purpose; if we\r\nconsider them all to belong to the Mid-Ganges region, it will suffice\r\nfor the present purpose.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the region just defined, during May, depended mainly on\r\nthe relation between Sir Edward Lugard on the one hand, and the\r\nJugdispore rebels on the other. How it fared with this active general\r\nand the troops under his command, when April closed, we have already\r\nseen. It will be remembered that about the middle of that month, Koer\r\nSingh took up a strong position at Azimutgurh, from which Lugard deemed\r\nit necessary to dislodge him; that Lugard himself remained encamped at\r\nAzimghur with the bulk of his Azimghur field-force, in order that he\r\nmight watch the proceedings of numerous bands of rebels under the Rajahs\r\nof Nuhurpoor and Naweejer and Gholam Hossein, hovering about the\r\ndistricts of Sandah, Mundoree, and Koelser; but that he made up a strong\r\ncolumn to pursue Koer Singh. This column, placed under the command of\r\nBrigadier Douglas, consisted of the following troops: H.M. 4th foot; a\r\nwing of the 37th foot; a detachment of Punjaub Sappers; two squadrons of\r\nSikh cavalry; a squadron of the Military Train; and nine guns and\r\nmortars. Then followed the series of cross-purposes, in which Koer Singh\r\nwas permitted or enabled to work much more mischief than Sir Edward had\r\nanticipated. The events may briefly be recapitulated thus: On the 17th\r\nand 18th, Douglas, after starting with his column from Azimghur, came up\r\nwith the rebels, defeated them at Azimutgurh, and chased them to Ghosee,\r\nNugra, and Secunderpore. On the 19th he found that they intended to\r\ncross the Gogra before he could come up to them in pursuit—an intention\r\nwhich he strove to render nugatory. On the 20th he encountered them\r\nagain, at Muneer Khas, defeated them with great slaughter, captured most\r\nof their munitions of war, and dispersed the rebels, the main body of\r\nwhom fled towards Bullah and Beyriah. On the 21st, Douglas had the\r\nmortification, on reaching Sheopore, of finding that Koer Singh had\r\noutwitted the officer who had been ordered to guard the passage of the\r\nGanges in the vicinity of Ghazeepore with about nine hundred men; the\r\nwily chief of Jugdispore had got in the rear of the detachment by a\r\nflank-movement, and had crossed the Ganges at an undefended spot. Then\r\nfollowed Captain Le Grand’s disastrous expedition to Jugdispore on the\r\n23d; the crossing of the Ganges on the 25th by Douglas, with his column;\r\nand the advance towards Arrah and Jugdispore to retrieve the disaster.\r\nTo what results these operations led in the month of May, we have now to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Douglas arrived at Arrah with a part of his force on the 1st\r\nof May, the rest having arrived two days earlier; but Douglas not being\r\nin sufficient force to effectually encompass the enemy, and the\r\nimportance of thoroughly routing Koer Singh being evident, Sir Edward\r\nLugard, leaving a few troops to guard Azimghur, set out for the Ganges\r\nwith his main column, crossed over into the Shahabad district on the 3d\r\nand following days, and prepared for operations in the direction of\r\nArrah and Jugdispore. The rebels, estimated at seven or eight thousand,\r\nwere supposed to be intrenching themselves, and getting in supplies. On\r\nthe 8th, Sir Edward arrived in the vicinity of Jugdispore, and came in\r\nsight of some of the rebels. Two companies of the 84th foot, with\r\ndetachments of Madras Rifles, and Sikh horse, aided by two\r\nhorse-artillery guns, were sent back to Arrah, to protect that place\r\nwhile operations were being directed against Jugdispore. The\r\ncommissioner of Patna at the same time sent the steamer _Patna_ up the\r\nGanges, to watch the ghâts or ferries. On the 9th, Sir Edward marched\r\nhis force from Beheea to an open plain a little to the west of\r\nJugdispore. Here he intended to encamp for a while, to allow Colonel\r\nCorfield to come up with some additional troops from Sasseram.\r\nCircumstances occurred, however, to change his plan. In the afternoon of\r\nthis day a large body of rebels formed outside the jungle, and moved in\r\nthe direction of Arrah; but these were quickly followed by cavalry and\r\nhorse-artillery, and driven back into the jungle. Another body, much\r\nmore numerous, began to fire into Sir Edward’s camp before he could get\r\nhis baggage well up and tents fixed. This determined him to attack them\r\nat once. Dividing his force into three columns, he planned an assault on\r\nJugdispore on three points at once. The place was carried after a little\r\nskirmishing, the rebels making only a slight resistance; they retired to\r\nLutwarpore, in the jungle district, taking with them two guns which they\r\nhad captured from the British in the preceding month. The loss on both\r\nsides was trifling. Leaving a strong party to retain Jugdispore, Lugard\r\nreturned to his camp in the evening. According to the rumours prevalent,\r\nKoer Singh, who had so long been a source of annoyance to the British,\r\nhad died of his wounds; and the rebels, under his brother Ummer Singh,\r\nwere ill supplied and in much confusion. A nephew of Koer Singh, named\r\nRitbhunghur Singh, gave himself up to the British a short time\r\nafterwards—hopeful of insuring forgiveness by being able to shew that,\r\nin earlier months, he had befriended certain Europeans in a time of\r\ngreat peril. On the 10th, after ordering all the fortifications at\r\nJugdispore, and all the buildings which had belonged to Koer Singh, to\r\nbe destroyed, Lugard prepared to follow the rebels into the jungle. He\r\narranged that Colonel Corfield, with the Sasseram force, should approach\r\nLutwarpore in one direction, while he himself intended to advance upon\r\nit from Jugdispore. On the 11th and 12th much fighting took place. Sir\r\nEdward took the rebels by surprise; they expected to be attacked from\r\nArrah or Beheea, but he marched westward through a belt of jungle to\r\nHettumpore, and attacked them on a side which they believed to be quite\r\nsafe. Lugard and Corfield were everywhere successful. It was, however, a\r\nharassing kind of warfare, bringing more fatigue than glory; the rebels,\r\nthough chastised everywhere, avoided a regular engagement, and retreated\r\ninto the jungle after every partial skirmish. At Arrah, Jugdispore,\r\nLutwarpore, Hettumpore, Beheea, Peroo, and Chitowra, Lugard defeated and\r\ncut them up at various times in the course of the month; yet he could\r\nnot prevent them from recombining, and collecting around them a rabble\r\nof budmashes and jail-felons. Sir Edward hoped, at any rate, to be able\r\nso to employ a strong detachment of cavalry as to prevent the rebels\r\nfrom crossing the river Sone, and carrying anarchy into other districts.\r\nThey nevertheless continued to harass the neighbourhood by freebooting\r\nexpeditions, if not by formidable military projects. After Lugard’s\r\ndefeat of the main force, some of the insurgents broke up into bands of\r\na few hundreds each, and were joined by budmashes from the towns and\r\nrevolted villages. One party attacked an indigo factory near Dumoran,\r\nand burned it to the ground; another effected a murderous outbreak at\r\nthe village of Rajpore, near Buxar; another threatened the\r\nrailway-bridge works at Karminassa. These mischievous proceedings\r\nnaturally threw the whole district into agitation. The threat against\r\nthe railway-works was fully carried out about the end of the month; for\r\nthe devastators destroyed the engineers’ bungalows and the workmen’s\r\nsheds, set fire to all the wood and coal collected for brick-burning,\r\ndestroyed everything they could easily lay their hands on, and\r\neffectually stopped the works for a time. Nothing could be done to quell\r\nthese disturbances, until a British force appeared.\r\n\r\nPractically, therefore, the ‘Azimghur field-force,’ under Sir Edward\r\nLugard, succeeded in breaking down the military organisation of the\r\nrebels in that part of India, without being able to prevent the\r\nformation of roaming bands bent on slaughter and devastation. And even\r\nthe limited amount of advantage gained was purchased at a high price;\r\nfor the tremendous heat of the sun struck down the poor soldiers with\r\nfatal certainty; numbers of them were carried from Jugdispore to Arrah,\r\ntowards the close of the month—prostrated by sickness, wounds, fatigue\r\nfrom jungle fighting, and sun-stroke.\r\n\r\nSomewhat further to the north, in the Goruckpore district, another group\r\nof rebels continued to harass the country, disturbing the operations of\r\npeaceful planters and traders. About the end of May, the rebel leader\r\nMahomed Hussein, with four thousand men, suddenly made an attack upon\r\nthe Rajah of Bansee, one of those who had remained faithful to the\r\nBritish government. The rajah was obliged to flee to a stronghold in a\r\nneighbouring jungle; and then his palace, with the town of Bansee, were\r\nplundered by the rebels. Mr Wingfield, the commissioner of Goruckpore,\r\nimmediately started forth with two hundred and fifty Europeans and some\r\nguns to the relief of the rajah, whom he found besieged in his\r\nstronghold. The enemy fled precipitately on hearing of Wingfield’s\r\napproach, notwithstanding the immense disparity of force. The energetic\r\ncommissioner then proceeded with the rajah to attack some rebel\r\nvillages; while a simultaneous advance was made on Amood by Colonel\r\nRowcroft. The object of these demonstrations was to keep the rebels in\r\ncheck until the rains set in, and the waters of the Gogra rose. Towards\r\nthe end of the month, four Europeans came into Goruckpore from a\r\nneighbouring station, where they had been suddenly attacked by a body of\r\nrabble under one Baboo Surdoun Singh, and other leaders. This was one\r\namong many evidences of a still disturbed condition of the Goruckpore\r\ndistrict. The district was in a slight degree protected by the passage\r\nof a body of troops who, though retiring rather than fighting, exerted\r\nsome kind of influence on the evildoer of the country. We speak of the\r\nGoorkhas of Jung Bahadoor’s Nepaulese contingent. These troops retreated\r\nslowly from Oude towards their own country, neither receiving nor giving\r\nsatisfaction from their late share in the warlike operations. After a\r\nsojourn of some time at Goruckpore, they resumed their march on the 17th\r\nof May, proceeding by brigades, and consuming much time in arranging and\r\ndragging their enormous supply of vehicles. They crossed the river\r\nGunduck at Bagaha, with much difficulty. A distance of about thirty\r\nmiles then brought them to Bettiah, and fourteen more to Segowlie—very\r\nnear the frontier of the British dominions. It was early in the\r\nfollowing month when the Goorkhas finally reached their native country,\r\nNepaul—their leader Jung Bahadoor being, though still faithful as an\r\nally, somewhat dissatisfied by his failure in obtaining notable\r\nadvantage from the governor-general in return for services rendered.\r\nViscount Canning had, many months earlier, received fierce newspaper\r\nabuse for not having availed himself more promptly of aid offered by\r\nJung Bahadoor; but there now appeared much probability that caution had\r\nbeen all along necessary in dealing with this ambitious chieftain.\r\n\r\nDirecting attention next to the region of the Jumna and the Upper\r\nGanges, we have to notice the continuance of insubordination around the\r\nAllahabad region, almost in the very presence of the governor-general\r\nhimself, who still remained, with his staff, in that station. One of the\r\nmost vexing symptoms of mischief at this place was the occurrence of\r\nincendiarism—the burning of buildings by miscreants who could not be\r\ndiscovered. On the 24th of May a new range of barracks was found to be\r\non fire, and six bungalows were completely destroyed. The prevalence of\r\na fierce wind, and the scarcity of water, frustrated for some time all\r\nattempts to extinguish the flames. One poor invalid soldier was burned\r\nto death, and many others injured. Beyond the limits of the city itself,\r\nit was a state of things very unexpected by the supreme authorities,\r\nthat the road from Allahabad through Futtehpoor to Cawnpore—a road more\r\ntraversed than any other by British troops throughout twelve months of\r\nanarchy—should in the middle of May be scarcely passable without a\r\nstrong escort. Yet such was the case. The opposition to the British raj,\r\nthough it had assumed a guerrilla character, was very harassing to deal\r\nwith. The British were strong in a few places; but the rebels were in\r\nnumerous small bodies, scattered all over the surrounding country; and\r\nthese bodies occasioned temporary panics at spots where there was no\r\nforce to meet them. The thorough knowledge of the country, possessed by\r\nsome of the leaders, enabled them to baffle the pursuers; and thus it\r\narose that these petty bands occasioned alarms disproportionate to the\r\nnumber of men comprising them. Sometimes they would occupy the great\r\ntrunk-road, between Allahabad and Cawnpore, and close up all means of\r\ntransit unless attacked and driven away by force. On the other hand,\r\nthis district exhibited a remarkable union of the new with the old, the\r\nEuropean with the oriental, the practical with the primitive—arising out\r\nof the opening of a railway through a part of the route. After reading,\r\nas we so often have in this volume, of toilsome marches by sunburnt and\r\nexhausted troops over rough roads and through jungle-thickets, it is\r\nwith a peculiar feeling of interest that we find an announcement to the\r\neffect, that ‘on the 26th of May a special train left Allahabad with a\r\nparty of Sikhs to reinforce Futtehpoor, which was said to be threatened\r\nby a large force of the enemy.’ Had this railway been opened when or\r\nsoon after the Revolt began, there is at least a fair probability that\r\nthe Cawnpore massacre might have been prevented—provided always that the\r\nrailway itself, with its locomotives and carriages, were _not in rebels’\r\nhands_.\r\n\r\nAllahabad, about the period now under notice, was made the subject of a\r\nvery important project, one of many arising out of the mutiny. The\r\nIndian government had long and fully considered the various advantages\r\nlikely to be derived from the founding of a great Anglo-Indian capital\r\nat some spot far removed from the three older presidential cities of\r\nCalcutta, Madras, and Bombay. The spot selected was Allahabad. The\r\npeculiarities of this very important station, before and during the\r\nmutiny, have been frequently noticed in past chapters. Occupying the\r\npoint of the peninsula formed by the junction of the two grand rivers\r\nGanges and Jumna, Allahabad is scarcely paralleled for situation by any\r\nother city in India. The one river brings down to it a stream of traffic\r\nfrom Kumaon, Rohilcund, Furruckabad, Cawnpore, Futtehpoor, and the\r\nsouthwestern districts of Oude; while the other brings down that from\r\nKurnaul, Roorkee, Meerut, Delhi, Muttra, Agra, Calpee, and a wide range\r\nof country in Rajpootana, Bundelcund, and the Doab. On the other sides,\r\ntoo, it has an extraordinary number of large military and commercial\r\ntowns within easy reach (in peaceful times), such as Lucknow, Fyzabad,\r\nSultanpore, Goruckpore, Azimghur, Jounpoor, Benares, Ghazeepore,\r\nMirzapore, Dinapoor, and Patna. Agra was at one time intended to have\r\nbeen converted into a presidential city, the capital of an Agra\r\npresidency; but the intention was not fully carried out; the Northwest\r\nProvinces were formed into a lieutenant-governorship, with Agra as the\r\nseat of government; but the events of the mutiny shewed the necessity of\r\nholding with a strong hand the position of Allahabad, as a centre of\r\ngreat influence; and Agra began to fall in relative importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FYZABAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that England has seldom built cities as a nation,\r\nas a government; cities have _grown_, like the constitution, without\r\nthose preconceived theories of centralised organisation which are so\r\nprevalent on the continent of Europe. It has been much the same in India\r\nas in England. The three presidential capitals—Calcutta, Madras, and\r\nBombay—became what they are, not from the development of a plan, but\r\nfrom a series of incidents having little relative connection. ‘Our three\r\ncapitals are congeries of houses, without order, or beauty, or\r\nhealthiness other than nature may have supplied. Our cantonments, which\r\nsometimes grow into cities, are generally stuck down in a plain as a\r\nkind of petrified encampment. Even when founding, as in Rangoon, it is\r\nwith the utmost difficulty we can compel successive governors to care\r\nwhether the original plan be not set aside.’ A problem arose whether\r\nAllahabad might not be an exception to this rule. Standing at the\r\nextreme end of the Doab, and bounded by two fine rivers on the north,\r\nsouth, and east, it is susceptible of any degree of enlargement by\r\nincluding additional ground on the west; it might be made one of the\r\nstrongest forts in India; and its rivers, aided by the railway when\r\nfinished, might make it a great centre of trade. Most of the conditions,\r\ntherefore, were favourable to the building of a fine Anglo-Indian city\r\non that spot. The river frontages, it is easily seen, might easily be\r\ndefended against any attacks which orientals could bring against them.\r\nOn the west or land side, it was proposed to construct a line of\r\nintrenchment, or a sort of intrenched camp, four miles in length, from\r\nriver to river. This fortification would consist mainly of two great\r\nredoubts on the river-banks, each capable of holding an entire regiment,\r\nbut each defensible by a small force if necessary. With these two\r\nredoubts, and one midway between them, and earthern embankments to\r\nconnect the three, it would be possible to render Allahabad impregnable\r\nto any hostile force likely to be brought against it. Within the space\r\nthus marked out by the embankment and the rivers would be included a\r\ncantonment, a European town, and a native town. The cantonment, a\r\ncomplete military establishment for four or five regiments, would be\r\nnear the western boundary, on the Jumna side. Eastward of this would be\r\nthe new English town, built in plots of ground let on lease to builders\r\n(native or European), who would be required, in building houses, shops,\r\nand hotels, to conform to some general plan, having reference to the\r\nrailway station as a centre of trade. Nearer the Ganges would be the\r\nnative town; while at the point of junction of the two rivers would be\r\nthe existing fort, extended and enlarged so as to form if needed a last\r\nstronghold for all the Europeans in Allahabad. Many of the details in\r\nthe plan were suggested during a period of panic fear, when the natives\r\nwere looked upon as if they were permanently bitter enemies; and, during\r\nthe long course of years necessary for working out the idea, great\r\nmodification in these details might be expected; but the general\r\ncharacter of the scheme, as developed about the period to which this\r\nchapter relates, may be understood from the above brief sketch.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 5th of May that a notification appeared at Allahabad,\r\nsigned by Mr Thornhill, officiating commissioner under the\r\ngovernor-general, concerning the leasing of land in that city for\r\nbuilding purposes. The terms were evidently framed with the intention of\r\nattracting the notice of commercial firms, at Calcutta and elsewhere, to\r\nAllahabad as a future emporium of commerce. The regulations may be\r\nsummarily noticed as follow: A new civil European town to be formed near\r\nthe railway station at Allahabad, distinct from the cantonment, the\r\nnative town, and the fort. Land, in plots of three acres each, to be let\r\non lease by the government, for the erection of shops, hotels,\r\nwarehouses, and other buildings requisite for a European population.\r\nEach plot to have a frontage of three hundred feet on a public road,\r\nwith a smaller road in the rear. Some of the plots to be let for\r\ndwelling-houses; and these, as well as the hotels and shops, to receive\r\na certain systematic arrangement, laid down by the authorities for the\r\ngeneral convenience of the whole community. Priority of choice to be\r\ngiven to those who intend to construct hotels, on account of the great\r\nnecessity for that species of accommodation in a newly collected\r\ncommunity. Plots, competed for by two or more persons, to be sold by\r\nauction to the highest bidder. The lease to be for fifty years, unless a\r\nshorter time be specified by agreement; and the lessee to have the\r\nprivilege of renewal, under approval as to conditions, but not with any\r\nrise of rental. The rent to be thirty rupees (about £3) per acre per\r\nannum. Leases to be transferable, and sub-letting to be permitted, on\r\npayment of a registration fee; provided the transferree or sublessee\r\nenter into an engagement to fulfil the necessary conditions to the\r\ngovernment. Every lessee to specify the kind of structures he intends to\r\nbuild on his plot; to commence building within one year after obtaining\r\nthe lease; and to finish in three years—on forfeiture both of the lease\r\nand of a money penalty, if the building fail in kind, value, or time.\r\nLessees to be subject to such rates and taxes as may be imposed for\r\nmunicipal purposes, and to all regulations of police and conservancy.\r\nLessees to be placed under stringent rules, concerning the employment of\r\nthatch or other inflammable materials for the roofs of buildings. As a\r\ngeneral rule, one plot to one lessee; but if a special application be\r\nmade, and supported on sufficient grounds, two or more plots to be\r\nleased together.—Such were the general regulations. At the time of\r\nissuing the order, there were about forty plots set out as a\r\ncommencement to the system.\r\n\r\nThe turbulent province of Oude next calls for attention; and as Sir\r\nColin Campbell’s operations bore almost equal reference to Oude and\r\nRohilcund, we will treat both provinces together.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, from the details given in the last chapter, that\r\nafter the great conquest of Lucknow in March, a considerable time\r\nelapsed before any effective attempts were made to overtake and defeat\r\nthe rebels who had escaped from that city. A few troopers and a few guns\r\nwere, it is true, sent in pursuit, but with no resources for a long\r\nseries of marchings and encampings. We have seen that Brigadier John\r\nJones, with the Roorkee field-force, about three thousand strong—H.M.\r\n60th Rifles, 1st Sikh infantry, Coke’s Rifles, 17th Punjaub infantry,\r\nthe Moultan Horse, and detachments of artillery and engineers—advanced\r\ninto the heart of Rohilcund from the northwest, while Sir Colin Campbell\r\nand General Walpole operated from the Oude or southeastern side: the\r\nobject being to hem in such of the rebels as had assembled in any force\r\nin Rohilcund. Recapitulating the narrative in a few words, we may remind\r\nthe reader that Jones started from Roorkee on the 15th of the month;\r\ncrossed the Ganges on the 17th; defeated a body of rebels at Nagul on\r\nthe same day; and advanced during the next four days steadily on the\r\nroad to Mooradabad. On the 22d, he fought and won the battle of Nageena;\r\non the 23d, at Noorpoor, he struck into the high road from\r\nMozuffernugger to Mooradabad, with a view of protecting one of the ghâts\r\nor ferries of the Ganges; on the 24th, he reached Chujlite, where he\r\nlearned that Feroze Shah, one of the numerous princes of the House of\r\nDelhi, had taken and entered Mooradabad two days before; and on the 25th\r\nhe reached that town, which had been hastily evacuated by Feroze Shah on\r\nthe news of Jones’s approach. Encamping outside the town, Jones ordered\r\nLieutenant-colonel (formerly Major) Coke, who commanded the infantry\r\nportion of his force, to march into Mooradabad, and make a diligent\r\nsearch for a number of rebel chieftains believed to be hidden there.\r\nThis search was attended with unexpected success. Coke placed parties of\r\nthe Moultan cavalry at all the outlets of the city, to prevent escapes,\r\nand then he attacked and searched all the houses in which rebel\r\nchieftains were believed to be concealed. The capture of one of them was\r\nmarked by a daring act of intrepidity on the part of an English officer.\r\nNawab Mujjoo Khan, the chief of the rebels hereabouts, had caused\r\nhimself to be proclaimed Nawab of Mooradabad, and had instigated the\r\npeople to murder and plunder the Europeans in the place, many months\r\nearlier. To capture this villain was a point of some importance. Coke\r\nproceeded to the Nawab’s house with two guns, a party of Sappers, and\r\nthe 1st Punjaub infantry. The soldiers of the Nawab’s guard making a\r\nstout resistance, many of them were shot down, including the son and\r\nnephew of the Nawab. Lieutenant Angelo then burst open the door of the\r\nroom in which the Nawab and another of his sons were concealed, and\r\ncaptured them. While so occupied, he was fired upon by some of the\r\nNawab’s guard, from an upper room; whereupon he rushed up stairs, burst\r\nopen the door, entered the room single-handed, and shot three men in\r\nsuccession with his revolver; some of his troops then coming up, he\r\ncaptured the rest of the guard. In short, the search was thoroughly\r\nsuccessful. The names and titles of twenty-one rebel chieftains\r\ncaptured, containing many repetitions of Khan, Sheik, Ali, Hossein, Beg,\r\nand Shah, shewed that these evildoers were mostly Mohammedans—the\r\nHindoos of Rohilcund having been much less extensively involved in\r\nrebellion. While Jones was thus operating in the northwest, Walpole was\r\nengaged, though less successfully, in the southeast. He started on the\r\n9th from Lucknow, with the ‘Rohilcund Field-force,’ five thousand\r\nstrong; received a mortifying discomfiture on the 14th at Fort Rhodamow,\r\nrendered more distressing by the death of Brigadier Adrian Hope;\r\ndefeated the rebels at Sirsa on the 22d; and crossed the Ramgunga at\r\nAllygunje on the 23d. The commander-in-chief himself left Lucknow about\r\nthe middle of the month; started from Cawnpore at the head of a small\r\ncolumn on the 18th; advanced to Kilianpore, Poorah, Urrowl,\r\nMeerun-ke-serai, Gosaigunje, and Kamalgunje between that date and the\r\n24th; entered Furruckabad and Futteghur on the 25th; crossed the Ganges\r\non the 26th and 27th; joined Walpole’s field-force on the banks of the\r\nRamgunga on the 28th; marched to Kanth on the 29th; and reached\r\nShahjehanpoor on the 30th, in force sufficient to retake that city, but\r\nnot in time to capture the rebel Moulvie of Fyzabad, who escaped to work\r\nmischief elsewhere.—We thus call to mind that, at the end of April,\r\nCampbell and Walpole had advanced from the southeast as far as\r\nShahjehanpoor; while Jones had advanced from the northwest to\r\nMooradabad—the two forces being separated by the city of Bareilly, and a\r\nwide expanse of intervening country. About the same time General Penny\r\nwas planning a march with a third column towards a point between\r\nBareilly and Shahjehanpoor, after crossing the Ganges at Nudowlee; he\r\nwas to march through the Budayoon district, and to unite his column with\r\nSir Colin’s main force at Meeranpore Kutra, six marches distant from\r\nFutteghur. Bareilly, the chief city of Rohilcund Proper, became the\r\npoint to which the attention of the commanders of all three forces were\r\ndirected. We have now to see to what result these combinations led in\r\nthe following month.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May the Rohilcund field-force, of which Sir Colin Campbell\r\nnow assumed the command in person, started from Shahjehanpoor, to\r\ncommence operations against Bareilly. A small force was left behind for\r\nthe defence of Shahjehanpoor, comprising one wing of the 82d foot, De\r\nKantzow’s Irregular Horse, four guns, and a few artillerymen and\r\nsappers, under Colonel Hall. What befel this small force will presently\r\nappear. Sir Colin marched on the 2d to Tilmul, over a fertile flat\r\ncountry, diversified with topes of trees, but nearly overwhelmed with\r\ndust, and inhabited by villagers who were thrown into great doubt by the\r\napproach of what they feared might be a hostile force. On the 3d he\r\nadvanced from Tilmul to Futtehgunje; where he was joined by the force\r\nwhich General Penny had undertaken to bring into Rohilcund from the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is desirable, before tracing the further operations of\r\nthe commander-in-chief, to notice the course of events which led to the\r\ndeath of General Penny. Being at Nerowlee, on the 29th of April, and\r\nbelieving that the rebels were in some force at the town of Oosait,\r\nPenny set out with a column for service in that direction. This column\r\nconsisted of something under 1500 men: namely, 200 Carabiniers, 350 H.M.\r\n64th, 250 Moultan Horse, 360 Belooch 1st battalion, 300 Punjaub 2d\r\ninfantry, a heavy field-battery, and a light field-battery with four\r\nguns. The column left Nerowlee about nine in the evening; but various\r\ndelays prevented Penny from reaching Oosait, seven miles distant, until\r\nmidnight. It then appeared that the enemy had retired from Oosait, and,\r\nas native rumour said, had retreated to Datagunje. The column advanced\r\ndeliberately, under the impression that no enemy was near; but when\r\narrived at Kukerowlee, it suddenly fell into an ambuscade. From the\r\nlanguage used by Colonel Jones of the Carabiniers, whose lot it was to\r\nwrite the official account of this affair, it is evident that General\r\nPenny had been remiss in precautionary measures; he shared the belief of\r\nMr Wilson, a political resident who accompanied him, that no enemy was\r\nnear, and under the influence of this belief he relaxed the systematic\r\norder of march which had been maintained until Oosait was reached. ‘From\r\nthis point,’ we are told, ‘military precautions were somewhat neglected,\r\nthe mounted portion of the column being allowed very considerably to\r\noutmarch the infantry; and eventually, though an advanced-guard was kept\r\nup, it was held back immediately in front of the artillery.’ Penny with\r\nhis staff, and Mr Wilson, were riding at the head of the advanced-guard;\r\nwhen at four o’clock, near Kukerowlee, they came into the midst of a\r\nwholly unexpected body of the enemy; who poured out grape and round shot\r\nat not more than forty yards’ distance, charged down from the left with\r\nhorsemen, and opened fire with musketry in front. One of the first who\r\nfell was General Penny, brought low by grape-shot. Colonel H. R. Jones,\r\nwho now took the command, made the best arrangements he could to meet\r\nthe emergency. The four guns of the light field-battery were quickly\r\nordered up to the front, and the cavalry were brought forward ready for\r\na charge. There were, however, many difficulties to contend against. The\r\nenemy’s right occupied a mass of sand-hills; their left was protected by\r\nthick groves of trees; the town of Kukerowlee was in their rear to fall\r\nback upon; and the dimness of the light rendered it impossible rightly\r\nto judge the number and position of the rebels. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Colonel Jones deemed it best merely to hold his ground\r\nuntil daylight should suggest the most fitting course of procedure, and\r\nuntil the infantry should have arrived. When the 64th came up with the\r\ncavalry and artillery which Penny had imprudently allowed to go so far\r\nahead, Colonel Bingham at once charged the enemy in front, and drove\r\nthem into the town. This done, Jones ordered the artillery to shell the\r\ntown; this completely paralysed the rebels, who soon began to escape\r\nfrom the opposite side. Hereupon Jones sent his cavalry in pursuit; many\r\nof the enemy were cut up, and one gun taken; but it was not deemed\r\nprudent to continue this pursuit to any great distance, in a district\r\nimperfectly known. This battle of Kukerowlee was thus, like nearly all\r\nthe battles, won by the British; and had it not been for the unfortunate\r\nwant of foresight on the part of General Penny, he might have been\r\nspared to write the dispatch which described it. He was the only officer\r\nkilled. Those wounded were Captains Forster and Betty, Lieutenants\r\nEckford, Davies, and Graham. Eckford’s escape from death was very\r\nextraordinary. The first fire opened by the rebels shot his horse from\r\nunder him; he then mounted an artillery-horse; a party of\r\nGhazees—fanatics who have sworn to die for their ‘deen’ or\r\nfaith—attacked him, wounded him, and stabbed his horse; Eckford fell\r\noff; and a Ghazee gave him a tremendous cut over the back of the right\r\nshoulder, and left him for dead; Surgeon Jones came up, and helped the\r\nwounded lieutenant along; but the enemy pursuing, Eckford was made to\r\nlie down flat on his face as if dead; the enemy passed on without\r\nnoticing him, and he was afterwards rescued by some of his companions.\r\nThree days after this encounter with the rebels, Colonel Jones succeeded\r\nin bringing poor Penny’s column into safe junction with Sir Colin’s\r\nforce at Futtehgunje—the mutineers and ruffians from the district of\r\nBudayoon retiring before him, and swelling the mass of insurgents at\r\nBareilly.\r\n\r\nWhile this was doing, another Jones was marching through Rohilcund in a\r\ndifferent direction. It is necessary to avoid confusion in this matter,\r\nby bearing in mind that Brigadier John Jones commanded the ‘Roorkee\r\nfield-force;’ while Colonel H. R. Jones held the temporary command of\r\nthe column lately headed by General Penny. The brigadier, in pursuance\r\nof a plan laid down by Sir Colin, directed his march so that both might\r\nreach Bareilly on the same day, the one from Mooradabad and the other\r\nfrom Shahjehanpoor. While on his march, Jones expected to come up with\r\nthe rebels at Meergunje, a place within a few miles of Bareilly. He\r\nfound, however, that after constructing two batteries at the first-named\r\nplace, they had apparently misdoubted their safety, and retreated to\r\nBareilly. Cavalry, sent on in pursuit, overtook the rear of the rebels,\r\ncut down great numbers of them, and captured two guns. At an early hour\r\non the 6th, the brigadier with his force arrived within a mile and a\r\nhalf of a bridge contiguous to Bareilly, known as Bahadoor Singh’s\r\nbridge. His reconnoitring party was fired upon. A skirmish at once\r\nensued, which lasted three hours, and ended in the capture of the\r\nbridge; the rebels were driven back with great slaughter into Bareilly.\r\nJust as Jones reached the margin of the city, he heard a cannonading\r\nwhich denoted the arrival of the commander-in-chief from the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHaving thus noticed the coalescence of the forces under the two Joneses,\r\nwe shall be prepared to trace the march of Sir Colin Campbell towards\r\nthe common centre to which the attention of all was now directed.\r\n\r\nAfter being reinforced at Futtehgunje by the column recently under the\r\ncommand of Penny, Sir Colin resumed his march on the 3d of May. As he\r\nadvanced, he received news that the rebels were in much disorder.\r\nSeveral of the chiefs had left them; and Nena Sahib, a coward\r\nthroughout, had sought safety by fleeing towards the border-region\r\nbetween Oude and Nepaul. The main body had been some time at Fureedpore;\r\nbut when they heard of Sir Colin being at Futtehgunje they retreated to\r\nBareilly—thereby running into the power of another column. The\r\nvillagers, mostly Hindoos, told distressing tales of the extortions and\r\nwrongs they had suffered at the hands of the Mohammedan chieftains,\r\nduring the twelve months that Rohilcund had been in the power of the\r\nrebels; they made great profession of their joy at seeing the arrival of\r\nan English army; but past experience had shewn that such profession\r\nshould be received with much qualification. Certain it was, that Sir\r\nColin Campbell, during his marches through Oude, the Doab, and\r\nRohilcund, received very little aid, and very little correct\r\ninformation, from the villagers of the districts through which he\r\npassed; they were either timid, or double-dealing, or both. In one of\r\nhis dispatches he said: ‘In spite of the assumed friendship of the\r\nHindoo portion of the population, I have not found it easier to obtain\r\ninformation in Rohilcund, on which trust could be put, than has been the\r\ncase in dealing with the insurrection in other parts of the empire.’ On\r\nthe 4th, the commander-in-chief advanced from Futtehgunje to Fureedpore,\r\nonly one march from Bareilly. Rumours now arrived that not only Nena\r\nSahib, but the Delhi prince Feroze Shah, had sought safety by flight\r\nfrom Bareilly; but that Khan Mahomed Khan still remained at the head of\r\nthe rebels. On this point, however, and on the number of the enemy’s\r\nforces, no information was obtained that could be relied upon. As for\r\nBareilly itself, supposing no fortifications to have been thrown up by\r\nthe rebels, it could not long maintain a siege; seeing that, with the\r\nexception of a stream with rather steep banks, there was no obstacle to\r\nthe entrance of a force from without. The city itself consisted mainly\r\nof a street two miles long, with numerous narrow streets and lanes\r\nbranching off to the right and left; outside these streets and lanes\r\nwere large suburbs of detached houses, walled gardens, plantations, and\r\nenclosures; and outside the suburbs were wide plains intersected by\r\nnullahs. It was at present uncertain whether the two forces, from\r\nShahjehanpoor and Mooradabad, could prevent the escape of the enemy over\r\nthese lateral suburbs and plains; but such was certainly the hope and\r\nwish of the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hindoo Fruit-girl.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 5th, Sir Colin left his camping-ground at\r\nFureedpore, and advanced towards Bareilly. After a brief halt, the\r\nvidettes detected a body of rebel cavalry in the distance; and Sir Colin\r\nat once marshalled his forces for an attack. The whole force was\r\nbrigaded into two brigades of cavalry, under Jones and Hagart; one of\r\nartillery, under Brind; and two of infantry, under Hay and Stisted.[172]\r\nWithout reference to the brigades, however, the order of advance was\r\nthus arranged: the 2d Punjaub cavalry formed a line of skirmishers on\r\nthe left of the main-road; the Lahore light horse formed a similar line\r\non the right; while across the road, and in support of these\r\nskirmishers, was a line formed by troops of the 9th Lancers and the 1st\r\nPunjaub cavalry, a troop of horse-artillery, and several field-guns.\r\nThen came the 78th Highlanders, and a body of Sappers and Engineers,\r\nalong the road; the 93d foot on the right of the road; and the 42d\r\nHighlanders on the left. Next, supporting and flanking these, were the\r\n79th foot, the Carabiniers, the Moultan Horse, the remainder of the 9th\r\nLancers and of the Punjaub cavalry, and a wing of the Belooch battalion.\r\nThen came the siege-train and the enormous array of baggage; flanked by\r\nthe 64th foot, a wing of the 82d, the 2d Punjaub infantry, and the 4th\r\nPunjaub rifles. Lastly came the rear-guard, comprising the 22d Punjaub\r\ninfantry, the 17th irregular cavalry, a squadron of the 5th Punjaub\r\ncavalry, and a troop of horse-artillery. As this strong force advanced,\r\nthe rebels fired a few shot from a battery set up at the entrance to\r\nBareilly; but they made scarcely any attempt to fortify or defend either\r\nthe stream that crossed the high road, or the bridge over the stream.\r\nThe enemy’s infantry appeared to be mostly congregated in the old\r\ncantonment or sepoy-lines, while the cavalry were hovering about in\r\ntopes of trees. The infantry scarcely shewed; but the cavalry, aided by\r\nhorse-artillery, made demonstrations as if about to attack, in numbers\r\nestimated at two or three thousand. This did not stay the progress of\r\nSir Colin, who was too strong to be affected by such an attempt.\r\nAdvancing through a suburb on one side of the city, he ordered the 42d,\r\nthe 79th, and a Sikh or Punjaub regiment, to explore a ruined mass of\r\none-storied houses. What followed may best be told in the language of Mr\r\nRussell, who was with the army at the time: ‘As soon as the Sikhs got\r\ninto the houses, they were exposed to a heavy fire from a large body of\r\nmatchlockmen concealed around them. They either retired of their own\r\naccord, or were ordered to do so; at all events, they fell back with\r\nrapidity and disorder upon the advancing Highlanders. And now occurred a\r\nmost extraordinary scene. Among the matchlockmen, who, to the number of\r\nseven or eight hundred, were lying behind the walls of the houses, was a\r\nbody of Ghazees or Mussulman fanatics, who, like the Roman Decii, devote\r\ntheir lives with solemn oaths to their country or their faith. Uttering\r\nloud cries, “Bismillah, Allah, deen, deen!” one hundred and thirty of\r\nthese fanatics, sword in hand, with small circular bucklers on the left\r\narm, and green cummerbungs, rushed out after the Sikhs, and dashed at\r\nthe left of the right wing of the Highlanders. With bodies bent and\r\nheads low, waving their tulwars with a circular motion in the air, they\r\ncame on with astonishing rapidity. At first they were mistaken for\r\nSikhs, whose passage had already somewhat disordered our ranks.\r\nFortunately, Sir Colin Campbell was close up with the 42d; his keen,\r\nquick eye detected the case at once. “Steady, men, steady; close up the\r\nranks. Bayonet them as they come on.” It was just in time; for these\r\nmadmen, furious with bang, were already among us, and a body of them\r\nsweeping around the left of the right wing got into the rear of the\r\nregiment. The struggle was sanguinary but short. Three of them dashed so\r\nsuddenly at Colonel Cameron that they pulled him off his horse ere he\r\ncould defend himself. His sword fell out of its sheath, and he would\r\nhave been hacked to pieces in another moment but for the gallant\r\npromptitude of Colour-sergeant Gardiner, who, stepping out of the ranks,\r\ndrove his bayonet through two of them in the twinkling of an eye. The\r\nthird was shot by one of the 42d. Brigadier Walpole had a similar\r\nescape; he was seized by two or three of the Ghazees, who sought to put\r\nhim off his horse, while others cut at him with their tulwars. He\r\nreceived two cuts on the hand, but he was delivered from the enemy by\r\nthe quick bayonets of the 42d. In a few minutes the dead bodies of one\r\nhundred and thirty-three of these Ghazees, and some eighteen or twenty\r\nwounded men of ours, were all the tokens left of the struggle.’\r\n\r\nSir Colin had not yet reached Bareilly. The little skirmishing that had\r\noccurred was in one of the suburbs. The enemy’s cavalry, though\r\npowerless for any serious attack, succeeded in creating, by a dash\r\nacross the plain towards the baggage, an indescribable amount of alarm\r\namong the camp-followers, bazaar-traders, horses, camels, bullocks, and\r\nelephants. There was not much real fighting throughout the day; but the\r\nheat was so intense, the poor soldiers suffered so much from thirst, so\r\nmany were brought low by sun-stroke, and all were so fatigued, that Sir\r\nColin resolved to bivouac on the plain for the night, postponing till\r\nthe next day an advance into, and the capture of, the city of Bareilly.\r\n\r\nWhether this delay on the road to victory was sound or not in a military\r\nsense, it afforded the enemy an opportunity to escape, which they did\r\nnot fail to take advantage of. On the morning of the 6th, it was\r\nascertained that many of the leaders, and a large body of rebel troops,\r\nhad quietly left the place. Guns were brought to bear upon certain\r\nbuildings in the city, known or suspected to be full of insurgents; and\r\nit was while this cannonade was in progress that Sir Colin became aware\r\nof the arrival of Brigadier Jones, already adverted to. On the 7th the\r\ntwo forces advanced into the city, and took complete possession of it,\r\nbut without capturing any of the leaders, or preventing the escape of\r\nthe main body of rebels. A large quantity of artillery, mostly of recent\r\nnative manufacture, fell into the hands of the victors, together with a\r\ngreat store of shell, shot, and powder, for the manufacture of which,\r\nmaterials and machinery had been provided by the rebels.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the narrative of Bareilly affairs, it will be\r\nnecessary to notice a very remarkable episode at Shahjehanpoor. It will\r\nbe remembered that when Sir Colin Campbell started from that place on\r\nthe 2d of May, to advance on Bareilly, he left behind him a small\r\ndefensive force. In his dispatch he said: ‘When I passed through\r\nShahjehanpoor, I was informed that the Fyzabad Moulvie, and the Nawab of\r\nthe former place, were at Mohumdee, with a considerable body of men who\r\nhad retired from Shahjehanpoor; and I thought it would be impolitic to\r\nleave the district without evidence of our presence.’ He therefore told\r\noff a small defensive force; comprising a wing of the 82d foot,\r\nLieutenant De Kantzow’s irregular horse, a few artillerymen, and four\r\nguns. In obedience to orders left by Sir Colin, Colonel Hall, of the\r\n82d, marched this small force from the camp at Azeezgunje, to occupy the\r\njail in the cantonment of Shahjehanpoor as a military post. There being\r\nno shade within the cantonment, he pitched his camp for a time in a tope\r\nof trees near the jail. He next formed the jail into a small intrenched\r\nposition, with four guns, and as large a supply of provisions as he\r\ncould procure. All this was done in one day, the 2d of May; and, indeed,\r\nnot an hour was to be lost; for a spy appeared on the following morning\r\nto announce that a large body of rebels had arrived within four miles of\r\nthe place. This announcement proved to be correct. A strong band of\r\ninsurgents from Mohumdee in Oude, taking advantage of Sir Colin’s\r\ndeparture from Shahjehanpoor, were advancing to regain possession of\r\nthat station. Colonel Hall immediately sent his baggage and provisions\r\ninto the jail, and ordered four companies of the 82d to guard the camp\r\nduring this transfer. Going out to reconnoitre, he saw the enemy’s\r\ncavalry approaching. Lieutenant De Kantzow would willingly have charged\r\nthe enemy with his small body of horse; but the colonel, knowing the\r\noverwhelming force of the rebels, and noting his instructions to act on\r\nthe defensive, forbade this charge. Both went into the jail, with their\r\nhandful of troops, and prepared for a resolute defence. The rebels\r\narrived, seized the old fort, plundered the town, put many of the\r\nprincipal inhabitants to death, and established patrols on the river’s\r\nbank. It was computed that they were little less than eight thousand\r\nstrong, with twelve guns. Against this strong force, Hall held his\r\nposition for eight days and nights, sustaining a continuous bombardment,\r\nwithout thinking for an instant of yielding. Not until the 7th of the\r\nmonth did the commander-in-chief hear of this disaster at Shahjehanpoor.\r\nHe at once made up a brigade; consisting of the 60th Rifles, the 79th\r\nHighlanders, a wing of the 82d foot, the 22d Punjaub infantry, two\r\nsquadrons of Carabiniers, Cureton’s Horse, with some artillery and guns.\r\nBrigadier Jones, who commanded this brigade, received at the same time\r\nfrom Sir Colin discretionary power to attack the enemy at Mohumdee after\r\nthe relief of Hall at Shahjehanpoor, if he should so deem it expedient.\r\nJones, at the head of his brigade, started from Bareilly on the 8th, and\r\nreached Shahjehanpoor on the 11th. At daybreak, a body of the enemy\r\nhaving been seen, Jones sent out the Mooltan Horse to pursue them; but a\r\nheavy mass of troops being now visible, it became necessary to draw up\r\nin order of battle. The enemy’s cavalry began the battle; these were\r\ndriven off by Jones’s howitzers. Then the Highlanders and Rifles were\r\npushed on as skirmishers, supported by horse-artillery; and in a short\r\ntime the rebels were put to flight—allowing the brigadier to select his\r\nown point of entrance into Shahjehanpoor. Fortunately he made himself\r\nacquainted with the fact that many buildings in the suburbs had been\r\nloopholed for musketry, and with the probability that many others in the\r\nheart of the town had been similarly treated; he thereupon avoided the\r\nmain street, and made a detour through the eastern suburbs. No enemy was\r\nvisible within the town, until a strong party of troopers were found\r\ndrawn up near the school-house; these were quickly dispersed by a few\r\nshrapnell shells, and a pursuit by the Carabiniers, leaving a gun and\r\nsome ammunition-wagons behind them. Jones continued his march by the\r\nchurch, and across the parade-ground to the jail, where the gallant\r\nlittle garrison under Colonel Hall had so long defended themselves\r\nagainst an overwhelming force. The bold stand made by this officer was\r\nan enterprise that excited little attention amid the various excitements\r\nof the period; but Sir Colin Campbell did not fail to see that the\r\ndefence had been prompt, energetic, and skilful. The adjutant-general,\r\nwriting to the governor-general, said: ‘I am directed by the\r\ncommander-in-chief to inform his lordship that the lieutenant-colonel\r\nhardly does justice to himself in his report of this defence, which was\r\nconducted by him with prudence and skill, and consequently with trifling\r\nloss. I am to add that Lieutenant-colonel Hall, although he makes no\r\nmention of the fact, was himself wounded by a musket-bullet in the leg,\r\nfrom the effect of which he has not yet (May 29th) recovered.’\r\n\r\nTo return to Bareilly. After the operations which have now been briefly\r\ndescribed, the insurgents were so completely driven out of Mooradabad,\r\nBareilly, and Shahjehanpoor, the principal towns in this province, that\r\nit was no longer deemed necessary to keep up the ‘Rohilcund field-force’\r\nin its collected form; the various brigades, cavalry and infantry, were\r\nbroken up, and Sir Colin gave separate duties to his various officers,\r\naccording to the tenor of the information received from various parts of\r\nthe country. Some corps and detachments remained at Bareilly; some went\r\nto Lucknow; one or two Punjaub regiments set off towards Meerut; and\r\nGeneral Walpole was placed in command in Kumaon and Rohilcund. It was\r\njust at this time, the 11th of May, that Sir Colin Campbell received an\r\nofficial notification from the Queen to thank his troops in her name for\r\ntheir gallant services in earlier months. The address was, of course,\r\nmerely of a customary kind under such circumstances; but it constituted\r\none among the list of honours to which soldiers look as some reward for\r\ntheir hard life.[173] The ‘last stronghold’ adverted to by him was\r\nBareilly; he could not then know that another stronghold, Gwalior, was\r\ndestined to be the scene of a much more sanguinary struggle.\r\n\r\nAmong the arrangements more immediately affecting Rohilcund, was the\r\nformation of a column for special service in the country districts. This\r\ncolumn, placed under the command of Lieutenant-colonel (now Brigadier)\r\nCoke, comprised a wing of the 42d Highlanders, the 1st Punjaub rifles,\r\nthe 1st Sikh infantry, a detachment of the 24th Punjaub infantry, a\r\nsquadron of Carabiniers, the Moultan Horse, a detachment of the 17th\r\nirregular cavalry, and a considerable force of artillery. With three\r\nweeks’ supplies for the European troops, and four weeks’ for the native,\r\nthis column set forth from Bareilly on the 12th of May.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief, leaving instructions for the formation of\r\nefficient defences at Bareilly, started off to some more central\r\nstation, where he could be in easy communication with the various\r\ncolumns engaged in different parts of Northern India. General Walpole\r\ntook command of the whole of the Rohilcund troops; having under him\r\nCoke’s brigade just adverted to, and Major Lennox to superintend the\r\nengineering works at Bareilly. Mr Alexander established himself as civil\r\ncommissioner, to reorganise a government for that long-distracted\r\nprovince. Being thus satisfied that affairs were in a good train, Sir\r\nColin started on the 15th, taking with him his head-quarters staff, the\r\n64th foot, a wing of the 9th Lancers, and detachments of other troops.\r\nThe veteran commander bore heat and fatigue in a manner that astonished\r\nhis subordinates; he got through an amount of work which knocked up his\r\naids-de-camp; and was always ready to advise or command, as if rest and\r\nfood were contingencies that he cared not about. The natives, when any\r\nof them sought for and obtained an interview with him, were often a good\r\ndeal surprised to see the commander of the mighty British army in\r\nshirt-sleeves and a pith-hat; but the keen eye and the cool manner of\r\nthe old soldier told that he had all his wits about him, and was none\r\nthe worse from the absence of glitter and personal adornment. His\r\nadvance in the first instance was to Fureedpore, as a first stage\r\ntowards Futteghur; his second to Futtehgunje; but here he heard news\r\nthat changed his plans. To understand what occurred, we must revert to\r\nthe affairs at Shahjehanpoor.\r\n\r\nWhen Brigadier Jones had relieved Colonel Hall from his difficulties on\r\nthe 11th, he found that he had been engaged with a fragment only of the\r\nenemy’s force; and he prepared for the contingency of a hostile\r\nencounter. On the 15th he was attacked with great fury and in great\r\nforce by the rebels, who were headed by the Moulvie of Fyzabad, the\r\nBegum of Oude, the Shahzada of Delhi, and (as some thought) by Nena\r\nSahib. The struggle continued throughout the day, and needed all the\r\nactivity and resources of the brigadier. So large was the body of\r\nrebels, indeed, that he could do nothing more than act on the defensive\r\nuntil reinforcements could reach him. This was the information received\r\nby Sir Colin when at Futtehgunje. He immediately re-arranged his forces.\r\nLeaving the 47th and 93d foot, the 17th Punjaub infantry, the 2d Sikh\r\ncavalry, and some horse and foot artillery, to guard Bareilly; he\r\nhastened towards Shahjehanpoor with the 64th foot, the Belooch\r\nbattalion, the 9th Lancers, and some horse and foot artillery. On the\r\n17th he marched to Tilhur; moving cautiously, for the rebels were known\r\nto be in great force not far distant. He rested during the mid-day heat,\r\nin a tope of mango-trees beyond the village of Tilhur. In the evening,\r\ninformation arrived that the Moulvie, with a large force, was strongly\r\nposted on the Mohumdee road, a few miles northeast of Shahjehanpoor.\r\nMohumdee, which had been made a stronghold by the rebels, comprised a\r\nbrick-fort, mounted with twelve or fifteen guns, strengthened in various\r\nways, and protected within and without by troops. The Moulvie, as the\r\nmost skilful of the insurgent leaders, held the chief command in these\r\nparts; but the Begum of Oude, and the Shahzada of Delhi, were believed\r\nto be near at hand. Mohumdee itself was about twenty miles from\r\nShahjehanpoor; but the whole road was more or less commanded by the\r\nrebels. In the early morn of the 18th Sir Colin started again. Arriving\r\nat Shahjehanpoor, he passed the old camping-ground, made a partial\r\ncircuit of the city to the bridge of boats, crossed the bridge, and\r\ntraversed the city to the other side. It was found that the city had\r\nsuffered considerably by the cannonading which Brigadier Jones had been\r\ncompelled to inflict upon it, in his operations for the relief of the\r\nlittle garrison under Colonel Hall; and that many of the respectable\r\ninhabitants had deserted the place until more peaceful times, more\r\nfacilities for quiet trade, should arrive.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Colin’s force joined that under Brigadier Jones, and the two\r\ncommanders compared notes, it was found that the brigadier’s troops had\r\nsuffered intensely from the heat. Mr Russell, who at that time—sick and\r\nhurt by a kick from a horse—was carried in a doolie or litter among the\r\n‘baggage’ of Sir Colin’s army, was not sufficiently in front to witness\r\nmuch of the fighting; but his diary is full of vivid pictures of\r\ncamp-life under a burning sun: ‘In Rose’s attack on the enemy at Koonch,\r\neight men fell dead in the ranks, and upwards of twenty officers and men\r\nhad to be carried from the field through the heat of the sun. Nineteen\r\nof our casualties at Bareilly, ten of which were fatal, were caused in\r\nthe same way. In fact, every march henceforth after ten o’clock in the\r\nmorning must be attended with loss of life.’—‘A peep into most of the\r\ntents would discover many of the head-quarters’ staff panting on their\r\ncharpoys, in the nearest possible approach to Adamite costume, and\r\ngasping for breath like carp on the banks of a moat. It may readily be\r\nimagined—if officers, each of whom has a tent to himself, with kuskus\r\ntatties, punkahs, and similar appliances to reduce the temperature,\r\nsuffer so much from heat—what the men endure, packed ten or twelve in a\r\ntent, and in some regiments eighteen or twenty, without such resources,\r\nand without change of light clothing; and how heavily picket-duty,\r\noutlying and inlying, presses upon them.’ In encamping after a twilight\r\nmorning march, ‘it may be easily imagined how anxiously each man surveys\r\nthe trees about his tent as the site is marked out, and calculates what\r\nshelter it will give him, and at what time the sun will find out his\r\nweak points during the day; for indeed the rays do strike through every\r\ninterstice like red-hot shot. There is no indecision of shadow, no\r\ninfirmity of outline; for wherever the sun falls on the side of a tent,\r\nit seems to punch out a fervid blazing pattern on the gray ground of the\r\ncanvas.’—‘The motion of a doolie is by no means unpleasant; but I\r\nconfess my experience of its comforts has now lasted quite long enough.\r\nIt is a long cot slung from a bamboo-pole, borne on the shoulders of\r\nfour men, two in front and two behind, who at a shuffling pace carry you\r\nalong the road at the rate of four miles an hour; and two spare men\r\nfollow as a relief. As the bottom of the litter hangs close to the\r\nground, the occupant has more than his share of all the dust that is\r\ngoing; but if the curtains or tilts are let down, the heat becomes\r\ninsupportable.’—‘The march of Jones’s column to the relief of\r\nShahjehanpoor had told heavily upon the men. Upwards of thirty rank and\r\nfile of the 79th fell out in marching to and through the city; and the\r\n60th Rifles, accustomed though they be to Indian warfare, were deprived\r\nof the services of upwards of forty men from sun-stroke. It was\r\npitiable, I was told, to see the poor fellows lying in their doolies,\r\ngasping their last. The veins of the arm were opened, and leeches\r\napplied to the temples; but notwithstanding every care, the greater\r\nnumber of the cases were fatal almost immediately; and even among the\r\ncases of those who recovered, there are few who are fit for active\r\nservice again, except after a long interval of rest.’—‘I own I am\r\ndistressed when I see the 60th Rifles dressed in dark-green tunics,\r\nwhich absorb the heat almost as much as if they were made of black\r\ncloth, and their cloth forage-caps poorly covered with a few folds of\r\ndark cotton. What shall we say of the 79th Highlanders, who still wear\r\nthat picturesque and extraordinary head-dress, with the addition of a\r\nflap of gray cloth over the ears? If it were white, perhaps it would\r\nafford some protection against the sun; but, as it is, this mass of\r\nblack feathers is surely not the head-dress that would be chosen by any\r\none, except a foolish fantastic savage, for the plains of India.’\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at Shahjehanpoor on the 18th, the commander-in-chief\r\nwished to give his troops a little needful rest during the heat of the\r\nday. A cavalry detachment, however, having gone out to reconnoitre, came\r\nin sight of a small mud-fort containing four guns; the guns fired upon\r\nthe cavalry; the report of this firing brought forward a body of the\r\nenemy’s troopers; and the appearance of these drew out Sir Colin and\r\nnearly the whole of his force. Thus a battle-array was very unexpectedly\r\nformed. Among the rebels was a large body of Rohilla troopers—active,\r\ndetermined, well mounted, and well armed; and as these men fought better\r\nthan was wont among the enemy, and were supported by many guns, there\r\nfollowed a good deal of cavalry and artillery skirmishing. During the\r\nfiring, a round-shot passed so close to Sir Colin Campbell and General\r\nMansfield as greatly to endanger both, and to increase the desire among\r\nthe soldiers generally that the commander-in-chief, who was very careful\r\nof his men’s lives, would attach a little more value to his own.\r\nAlthough the result of the encounter was to drive off the enemy to a\r\ngreater distance, it was not wholly satisfactory or decisive; Sir Colin\r\nhad not intended to resume active service until his troops had been\r\nrefreshed by a few hours’ rest; but the reconnaissance had been so\r\nmanaged as to precipitate an engagement with the enemy. It was only a\r\nsmall part of the rebel force that was thus encountered on the 18th; the\r\nmain body, eight or ten thousand strong, was at Mohumdee.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief, finding himself too weak in cavalry to pursue\r\nthe enemy with any effect, suspended operations for a few days;\r\nremaining at Shahjehanpoor until Brigadier Coke’s column could join him\r\nfrom the district of Pileebheet. Coke, in accordance with a plan already\r\nnoticed, was preparing to sweep round the country by way of Boodayoun to\r\nMooradabad; but he now joined Sir Colin, on the 22d; and preparations\r\nwere made for an immediate advance upon the rebel position at Mohumdee.\r\nAgain were the enemy beaten, and again did the Moulvie and the other\r\nleaders escape. When the British marched to that place on the 24th they\r\nfound that the rebels had evacuated their strong fort, after destroying\r\nthe defence-works. They had also destroyed Kujoorea, a very strong\r\ndoubly intrenched position, surrounded by thick bamboo-hedges, and\r\nhaving a citadel. Several guns were dug up at the last-named place; and\r\nmuch property was discovered which had once belonged to the unfortunate\r\nEuropeans murdered by the rebels nearly twelve months earlier.\r\n\r\nThroughout the operations in Oude and Rohilcund, from May 1857 till May\r\n1858, one of the master-spirits among the rebels was the Moulvie of\r\nFyzabad—a man whose name has been so often mentioned: ‘A tall, lean, and\r\nmuscular man, with lantern jaws, long thin lips, high aquiline nose,\r\ndeep-set large dark eyes, beetle brows, long beard, and coarse black\r\nhair falling in masses over his shoulders.’ During the investigations\r\nwhich were subsequently made into the plans and intrigues of the rebels\r\nin Oude, the fact was ascertained that this Moulvie had been known many\r\nyears before as Ahmed Shah, a sort of inspired fanatic or fakeer. He\r\ntravelled through the Northwest Provinces on some sort of miraculous\r\nmission which was a mystery to the Europeans; his stay at Agra was of\r\nconsiderable duration, and was marked by the exercise of much influence\r\nover the Mohammedan natives. Mr Drummond, magistrate of that city, kept\r\nan eye on him as a suspicious character; and it was afterwards regarded\r\nas a probability that the Moulvie had been engaged in some plotting\r\ninimical to the English ‘raj.’ The commencement of the mutiny in May\r\n1857 may have been determined by unforeseen circumstances; but abundant\r\nproofs were gradually obtained that some sort of conspiracy had been\r\nlong before formed, and hence a reasonable inference that the Moulvie\r\nmay have been one of the conspirators. When the troops mutinied at\r\nFyzabad in June, they placed the Moulvie at their head. He had been in\r\nthat city in April, attended by several fanatic followers; and here he\r\ncirculated seditious papers, openly proclaiming a religious war.\r\nAlthough the police on this occasion were ordered to arrest him, he and\r\nhis followers made an armed resistance which could not be suppressed\r\nwithout military aid. The Moulvie was captured, tried, and condemned for\r\nexecution; but the Revolt broke out before he could thus be got rid of,\r\nand then he suddenly changed character from a felon to a leader of a\r\nformidable body of armed men. Though sometimes eclipsed in power by\r\nother leaders, he maintained great influence over the rebels throughout\r\nthe turbulent proceedings of the period. There can be little doubt that\r\nhe had much of the sincerity of a true religious fanatic; and as he was\r\nan able man, and free from the dastardly cruelty that so stained the\r\nnames of Nena Sahib and other leaders of unenviable notoriety, a certain\r\nkind of respect was felt for him by the British whom he opposed.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of May ended, and Sir Colin Campbell had proceeded to\r\nFutteghur as a central station whence he could conveniently watch the\r\nprogress of events, the Rohilcund and Roorkee field-forces were broken\r\nup; and the regiments which had composed them were set apart for various\r\ndetached duties. Brigadier Seaton remained at Shahjehanpoor, with the\r\n60th Rifles, the 82d foot, the 22d Punjaub infantry, Cureton’s cavalry,\r\ntwo squadrons of the 6th Dragoon Guards, and some artillery. The 79th\r\nHighlanders, and various detachments of artillery, took their departure\r\nfor Futteghur. The 64th went to Meerut; the 9th Lancers to Umballa; and\r\nCoke’s Sikh brigade to Boodayoun or Pileebheet. At the end of the month\r\nall was quiet at and near Shahjehanpoor, and the peaceful portion of the\r\ninhabitants were returning; but it was doubtful how soon a new irruption\r\nof rebels from Oude would throw everything again into confusion. Indeed\r\nthere were at that time many rebel leaders at the head of small bodies\r\nof insurgents, ready for mischief; among whom were Baboo Ramnarain of\r\nIslamnuggur, and Nizam Ali of Shahee—but these men could safely be\r\nregarded rather as guerrilla chieftains than as military leaders.\r\n\r\nIt was on this fitting occasion, when there seemed to be a lull in the\r\ndin of war, that Sir Colin Campbell issued a congratulatory address to\r\nthe troops of the Anglo-Indian armies. Although the address was not made\r\npublicly known to the troops by the adjutant-general until the following\r\nmonth, it was dated the 28th of May, and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n‘In the month of October 1857 the garrison of Lucknow was still shut up,\r\nthe road from Calcutta to Cawnpore was unsafe, the communications with\r\nthe northwest were entirely closed, and the civil and military\r\nfunctionaries had disappeared altogether from wide and numerous\r\nprovinces. Under instructions from the Right Honourable the\r\nGovernor-general, a large plan was designed, by which the resources of\r\nthe three presidencies, after the arrival of reinforcements from\r\nEngland, should be made available for combined action. Thus, while the\r\narmy of Bengal, gathering strength from day to day, has recovered the\r\nGangetic Doab, restored the communications with the northwest of the\r\nempire, relieved the old garrison of Lucknow, afterwards taking that\r\ncity, reoccupying Rohilcund, and finally insuring in a great measure the\r\ntranquillity of the old provinces—the three columns put in movement from\r\nBombay and Madras have rendered like great and efficient services in\r\ntheir long and difficult marches on the Jumna, through Central India,\r\nand in Rajpootana. These columns, under Major-generals Sir Hugh Rose,\r\nK.C.B., Whitlock, and Roberts, have admirably performed their share in\r\nthe general combination arranged under the orders of his lordship the\r\ngovernor-general. This combination was spread over a surface ranging\r\nfrom the boundaries of Bombay and Madras to the extreme northwest of\r\nIndia. By their patient endurance of fatigue, their unfailing obedience,\r\nand their steadfast gallantry, the troops have enabled the generals to\r\nfulfil their instructions. In no war has it ever happened that troops\r\nhave been more often engaged than during the campaigns which have now\r\nterminated. In no war has it ever happened that troops should always\r\ncontend against immense numerical odds, as has been invariably the case\r\nin every encounter during the struggle of the last year; and in no war\r\nhas constant success without a check been more conspicuously achieved.\r\nIt has not occurred that one column here, another there, has won more\r\nhonour than the other portions of the army; the various corps have done\r\nlike hard work, have struggled through the difficulties of a hot-weather\r\ncampaign, and have compensated for paucity of numbers in the vast area\r\nof operations by continuous and unexampled marching, notwithstanding the\r\nseason. It is probable that much yet remains for the army to perform;\r\nbut now that the commander-in-chief is able to give the greater part of\r\nit rest for a time, he chooses this moment to congratulate the generals\r\nand troops on the great results which have attended their labours. He\r\ncan fairly say that they have accomplished in a few months what was\r\nbelieved by the ill-wishers of England to be either beyond her strength,\r\nor to be the work of many years.’\r\n\r\nThis address is not fully intelligible without taking into account\r\ncertain brilliant proceedings in Central India, hereafter to be noticed;\r\nbut it is transcribed here as a suitable termination to the Rohilcund\r\noperations in the month of May. The other important affairs bearing\r\nrelation to it will find their due place of record.\r\n\r\nOude itself has been very little mentioned in this chapter. The reason\r\nis, that the most important section of the rebels escaped from that\r\nprovince into Rohilcund, after the great siege of Lucknow, thereby\r\ndetermining the main scene of struggle during May. There was not,\r\nhowever, a total cessation of fighting in Oude. Sir Hope Grant, who had\r\nbeen left at Lucknow by Sir Colin Campbell, had more than one encounter\r\nwith the rebels in the course of the month. Some of these operations\r\nbrought him, on the 10th, to a place called Doundea Khera, a fort\r\nbelonging to the rebel Ram Buksh. This fort, though of mud, was of\r\nconsiderable strength; it was square, with earthen walls and bastions of\r\nconsiderable thickness; it had four guns, and was rendered difficult of\r\napproach by a ditch and belt of prickly jungle. The fort was, however,\r\nfound deserted when Sir Hope arrived. His work then consisted in\r\ndestroying the fort, and such of the buildings as could be shewn to have\r\nbelonged to Ram Buksh. This done, he advanced on the 12th to Nuggur.\r\nHearing that two thalookdars or chieftains, Beni Madhoo and Shewrutten\r\nSingh, had assembled an army of fifteen thousand infantry, sixteen\r\nhundred cavalry, and eleven guns, at Sirsee, a village and fort about\r\nfive miles off, Grant determined to attack them at once. He left all his\r\nbaggage, supplies, &c., with tents struck, in a safe position, with a\r\nforce of cavalry, infantry, and artillery for their protection. From the\r\nextreme difficulty of obtaining correct information in that country, Sir\r\nHope was in much doubt concerning the ground occupied by the enemy; and\r\neventually he found it stronger than he had expected. The rebels were\r\ndrawn up on the banks of a nullah, with an extensive thick jungle in\r\ntheir rear, rendered still stronger by the fortified village of Towrie.\r\nAt five in the afternoon the enemy’s first gun opened fire; but as soon\r\nas Grant had formed his column, with cavalry and horse-artillery\r\ncovering his right flank, the rebels were attacked with such boldness\r\nand vigour that they gave way, and were driven into the jungle, leaving\r\ntwo iron guns behind them. Grant’s column was at one time almost\r\nsurrounded by the rebels; but a prompt movement of some of the regiments\r\nspeedily removed this difficulty. The rebels suffered severe loss,\r\nincluding that of one of their leaders, Shewrutten. Sir Hope Grant,\r\ndeeming it imprudent to allow his troops to enter the jungle, bivouacked\r\nfor the night on the ground where the battle had been fought, and\r\nreturned on the morning of the 13th to his camp at Nuggur. During these\r\noperations, he found himself within a short distance of the small Hindoo\r\ntemple in which Lieutenants Delafosse and Thomson, and several other\r\nEuropeans, sought refuge after their escape from the boat-massacre at\r\nCawnpore, eleven months earlier.[174] Much blood having been spilled on\r\nthat occasion, one of the objects of the present expedition was to bring\r\ncertain of the native miscreants to justice. Mr Elliott,\r\nassistant-commissioner, who accompanied the column, went on to the\r\ntemple with a squadron of cavalry, took a few prisoners, and then\r\ndestroyed the temple—which still exhibited the shot-holes resulting from\r\nthe dastardly attack of a large body of natives on a few unarmed\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the month, Hope Grant found that a body of the\r\nenemy was threatening Bunnee, and endeavouring to obtain command of the\r\nhigh road between Lucknow and Cawnpore; this necessitated an expedition\r\non his part to frustrate the design. As a means of better controlling\r\napproach to the capital, he blew up the stone-bridge over the Goomtee,\r\nthus leaving the iron suspension-bridge as the only mode of crossing.\r\n\r\nOf Lucknow, little need be said in this chapter. The engineers were\r\nemployed in constructing such batteries and strongholds, and clearing\r\naway such native buildings, as might enable a small British force to\r\ndefend the place; while Mr Montgomery, the newly appointed\r\nchief-commissioner, was cautiously feeling his way towards a\r\nre-establishment of civil government. Viscount Canning had given him\r\nplenary powers, in reference to the issue of any proclamation to the\r\nnatives—powers which required much tact in their exercise; for there was\r\nstill a large amount of fierce opposition and vindictive feeling to\r\ncontend against.\r\n\r\nIn the Doab, and the district adjacent to it, several minor affairs took\r\nplace during the month, sufficient to indicate a very turbulent\r\ncondition of portions of the population, even if not of great military\r\nimportance. At one period of the month five thousand rebels, in two\r\nbodies, crossed the Kallee Nuddee, and marched along the western\r\nboundary of the Futteghur district, burning and destroying villages.\r\nThey then crossed the Ganges into Oude by the Shorapore Ghât, taking\r\nwith them several guns. Here, however, they were watched and checked by\r\na small force under Brigadier Carthew, and by Cureton’s Horse. About the\r\nsame time, a party of a thousand rebels, with four guns, marched from\r\nHumeerpore to Asung, on the great trunk-road between Lullutpore and\r\nCawnpore; they commanded that road for several days, until a force could\r\nbe sent out to dislodge them. Higher up the Doab, the fort and village\r\nof Ayana, in the Etawah district, were taken by a party of Alexander’s\r\nHorse, and a rebel chief, named Roop Singh, expelled. Colonel Riddell,\r\nwho commanded a column from Etawah, encountered and defeated small\r\nbodies of rebels near Ooriya and Sheregurh, and then descended the\r\nGanges in boats to Calpee, to take part in an important series of\r\noperations in which the Central India field-force was mainly concerned.\r\nBrigadier Showers, during the greater part of this month, was employed\r\nin various ways around Agra as a centre. Among other measures, he\r\norganised a corps of Jât cavalry, to defend the ghâts of the Ganges, and\r\nprevent rebels from crossing the river. Agra itself, with the brigadier\r\nat hand to check rising disturbances, remained free from serious\r\ntroubles; though from time to time rumours were circulated which threw\r\nthe Europeans into some uneasiness. As the native inhabitants still\r\npossessed a number of old firelocks, swords, and other weapons; it was\r\ndeemed prudent to issue an order for disarming. An immense collection of\r\nqueer native weapons was the result—not very formidable to English\r\ntroops, but mischievous as a possible element of strength to the\r\ndisaffected. Many of the guns in the fort were kept pointed towards the\r\ncity, as a menace to evildoers.\r\n\r\nIn reference to many parts of the Doab, there was ample reason for\r\nBritish officers feeling great uneasiness at the danger which still\r\nsurrounded them in the Northwest Provinces, wherever they were\r\nundefended by troops. The murder of Major Waterfield was a case in\r\npoint. About the middle of May the major and Captain Fanshawe were\r\ntravelling towards Allygurh _viâ_ Agra. In the middle of the night, near\r\nFerozabad, a band of a hundred and fifty rebels surrounded the vehicle,\r\nshot the driver, and attacked the travellers. The two officers used\r\ntheir revolvers as quickly as they could; but the unfortunate Waterfield\r\nreceived two shots, one in the head and one through the chest, besides a\r\nsword-cut across the body; he fell dead on the spot. Fanshawe’s escape\r\nwas most extraordinary. The rebels got him out of the carriage, and\r\nsurrounded him; but they pressed together so closely that each prevented\r\nhis neighbour from striking. Fanshawe quickly drew his sword, and swung\r\nit right and left so vigorously that he forced a passage for himself\r\nthrough the cowardly crew; some pursued him, but a severe sword-cut to\r\none of them deterred the rest. The captain ran on at great speed,\r\nclimbed up a tree, and there remained till the danger was over. His\r\ncourage and promptness saved him from any further injury than a slight\r\nwound in the hand. Poor Waterfield’s remains, when sought for some time\r\nafterwards, were found lying among the embers of the burned vehicle;\r\nthey were carried into Agra, and interred with military honours. The\r\nnative driver was found dead, with the head nearly severed from the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nNynee Tal, Mussouree, and the other hill-stations towards which the sick\r\nand the weak looked with so much yearning, were almost wholly free from\r\ndisturbance during May. One of the few events calling for notice was an\r\nexpedition from Huldwanee by Captain Crossman. Receiving news that two\r\nrebel leaders, Nizam Ali Khan and Kali Khan, were preparing for mischief\r\nat a place called Bahonee, he started off on the 8th of May, with two or\r\nthree companies of his own regiment, and a hundred Goorkhas mounted on\r\nelephants. He missed the two leaders, but captured many other rebels,\r\nincluded Kali Khan’s brother—all in the service of the notorious Khan\r\nBahadoor Khan, self-appointed chief of Bareilly. After burning five\r\nrebel villages, in which great atrocities had been perpetrated against\r\nChristians many months before, Crossman returned to Huldwanee—having\r\nbeen in incessant movement for twenty-six hours.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the other regions of India presented so few instances—with\r\na notable exception, presently to be mentioned—of rebellious\r\nproceedings, that a few paragraphs will suffice for their treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier half of the month of May, minor engagements took\r\nplace in the Nagpoor territory, for the dispersion of bands of marauders\r\nand insurgents. The rebels were so little influential, the troops sent\r\nagainst them so few in number, and the towns and villages so little\r\nknown, that it is unnecessary to trace these operations in detail. The\r\nlocalities concerned were Arpeillee, Ghote, Ashtee, Koonserra,\r\nChamoorshee, and others equally obscure. The insurgents were a\r\ncontemptible rabble, headed by refractory zemindars; but as their\r\ncountry was almost a complete jungle, it was very difficult work for\r\nLieutenant Nuttall and Captain Crichton to put them down. The first of\r\nthese two officers had under him five companies of the Nagpoor irregular\r\ninfantry, with one gun; the other was deputy-commissioner of the\r\ndistrict. A party of two thousand rebels, under the zemindar of\r\nArpeillee—about a hundred miles south of Nagpoor—ravaged many villages;\r\nand at one spot they brutally murdered Mr Gartlan and Mr Hall,\r\nelectric-telegraph inspectors, taking away all the public and private\r\nproperty from the station. The marauders and murderers were gradually\r\nput down; and this necessary work, though difficult from the cause above\r\nmentioned, was facilitated by the peaceful tendencies of the villagers\r\ngenerally, who rather dreaded than favoured Yenkut Rao, Bapoo Rao, and\r\nthe other rebel zemindars. It also tended to lessen the duration of the\r\ncontest, and insure its success, that Milloo Potail, and some other\r\nchieftains, sided with the British. Bapoo Rao, the head rebel of the\r\ndistrict, was believed to be bending his steps towards the Nizam’s\r\ncountry; but as he would there fall into the hands of an ally of the\r\nBritish, little doubt was entertained that his career would soon be cut\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nThe Nizam and his prime-minister kept the large territory of Hyderabad\r\nfree from any extensive military disturbances; but the country districts\r\nwere so harassed by bands of marauding Rohilla freebooters, that the\r\nNizam requested the Bombay government to furnish a small force for\r\nputting down this evil. Accordingly a corps of a few hundred men were\r\nsent to the region between Aurungabad and Jaulnah—with very evident and\r\nspeedy effect.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, in connection with the events of the month\r\nof April, the intended disarming of the province of Gujerat was adverted\r\nto. This critical and important operation was carried out during May.\r\nSir Richmond Shakespear, who held a military as well as a political\r\nposition in that province, managed the enterprise so firmly and\r\nskilfully that village after village was disarmed, and rendered so far\r\npowerless for mischief. Many unruly chieftains regarded this affair as\r\nvery unpalatable. It was a work of great peril, for the turbulent\r\nnatives were out of all proportion more numerous than any troops Sir\r\nRichmond could command; but he brought to bear that wonderful influence\r\nwhich many Englishmen possessed over the natives—influence shewing the\r\npredominance of moral over physical power. The native sovereign of\r\nGujerat, the Guicowar, had all along been faithful and friendly to the\r\nBritish; he trusted Sir Richmond Shakespear as fully as Scindia trusted\r\nSir Robert Hamilton, and gave an eager assent to the disarming of his\r\nsomewhat turbulent subjects. The Nizam, the Guicowar, Scindia, and\r\nHolkar—all remained true to the British alliance during the hour of\r\ntrouble; if they had failed us, the difficulties of reconquest would\r\nhave been immensely increased, if not insuperable.\r\n\r\nOf the Bombay presidency mention may be postponed to the chapter\r\nrelating to the month of June, so far as concerns the appearance and\r\nsuppression of slight rebellious symptoms. One of the minor events in\r\nBombay city at this period was the conferring of a baronetcy on a native\r\ngentleman, the high-minded liberal Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy. He had long\r\nbefore been knighted; but his continued and valuable assistance to the\r\ngovernment through all trials and difficulties now won for him further\r\nhonour. The Parsee merchant became Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy,\r\nBart.—perhaps the most remarkable among baronets, race and creed\r\nconsidered. Whatever he did, was done in princely style. In order that\r\nhis new hereditary dignity might not be shamed by any paucity of wealth\r\non the part of his descendants, he at once invested twenty-five lacs of\r\nrupees in the Bombay four per cents., to entail an income of ten\r\nthousand pounds a year on the holder of the baronetcy. A large mansion\r\nat Mazagon was for a like purpose entailed; and the old merchant-prince\r\nfelt a commendable pride in thinking that Bombay might possibly, for\r\ncenturies to come, count among its inhabitants a Sir Jamsetjee\r\nJejeebhoy.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have observed that this chapter is silent concerning the\r\nbrilliant campaign of Sir Hugh Rose in Central India, and of the\r\nsubsidiary operations under Generals Roberts and Whitlock. It has been\r\nconsidered advantageous, on account of the great importance of Sir\r\nHugh’s exploits, and of the intimate manner in which his proceedings in\r\nJune were determined by those of May, to treat those transactions in a\r\nseparate chapter, apart from those connected with the names of Campbell,\r\nLugard, Douglas, Grant, Walpole, Jones, and Penny. The narrative will\r\nnext, therefore, take up the affairs of Central India during the months\r\nof May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Transport of Troops to India._—Early in the session of 1858, many\r\n  members of the legislature, anxious to witness the adoption of the\r\n  speediest mode of transporting troops to India, insisted not only\r\n  that the overland route viâ Suez ought to have been adopted from\r\n  the first, but also that the government and the East India Company\r\n  ought to receive national censure for their real or supposed\r\n  remissness on this point. In former chapters the fact has been\r\n  rendered evident that, among the many important questions pressed\r\n  upon the attention of the government, none was more imminent than\r\n  that which related to the mode of strengthening the British army\r\n  in India. England, not a military country in the continental\r\n  estimate of that phrase, could ill spare troops to wage a great\r\n  war in her Eastern possessions; and yet such a course was\r\n  absolutely necessary. With ninety-nine regiments of line-infantry,\r\n  and a proportionate number of troops of other kinds, she had to\r\n  defend nearly thirty colonies besides the home country. Nay, at\r\n  the very time when the mutiny began, she had barely finished a war\r\n  with Persia, and had just commenced another with China—superadded\r\n  to the defensive requirements just adverted to. Had the Persian\r\n  expedition not been brought to a successful termination in the\r\n  spring of 1857, and had the regiments destined for China become\r\n  practically engaged in hostilities in that country at that time,\r\n  it is difficult to imagine how the governor-general could have\r\n  sent up any reinforcements from Calcutta, or Lord Elphinstone from\r\n  Bombay, until summer had far advanced. Under the particular\r\n  circumstances of time and place, however, Generals Outram and\r\n  Havelock were released from their duties in Persia time enough to\r\n  conduct the important operations at Lucknow and elsewhere—bringing\r\n  with them the Queen’s troops and Company’s troops which had been\r\n  engaged in the war in that country; while, on the other side,\r\n  troops intended for service in China were rendered available for\r\n  the needs of India. Still, this did not affect the strictures\r\n  passed in the home country. Members of the legislature inquired,\r\n  and journalists inquired: ‘Why was not the overland route adopted\r\n  for or by troops sent from England?’ Hence the appointment of a\r\n  committee of the House of Commons—‘To inquire concerning the\r\n  measures resorted to, or which were available, and as to the lines\r\n  of communication adopted for reinforcing our army during the\r\n  pending Revolt in India, and report thereon to the House: with a\r\n  view to ascertaining the arrangements which should be made towards\r\n  meeting any future important emergencies involving the security of\r\n  our Eastern dominions.’\r\n\r\n  As the report given in by the committee was comprised within a few\r\n  paragraphs, we will present it unaltered here, and then touch upon a\r\n  few matters of detail connected with the subject.\r\n\r\n  The committee agreed to report:\r\n\r\n  ‘1. That the inquiry which this committee has been appointed to\r\n  conduct may be divided into three branches: the first, relating to\r\n  the overland route to India; the second, to the employment of\r\n  steamers, as compared with sailing-vessels, for the transport of\r\n  troops round the Cape of Good Hope; and the third, to the use made\r\n  during the mutiny of the military resources of this country and of\r\n  the colonies.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. That the Court of Directors appear, from the first intelligence\r\n  of the mutiny at Meerut, to have been sensible of the advantages of\r\n  the overland route, and to have lost no time in recommending its\r\n  adoption; but that political and other considerations deterred her\r\n  Majesty’s ministers from at once assenting to that recommendation.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. That the committee cannot judge of the validity of those\r\n  political objections, as they felt themselves precluded from\r\n  inquiring into them; but that they ceased to prevail in the first\r\n  week of September, when the more serious character of the war and\r\n  the lateness of the season for ships departing for Calcutta, led to\r\n  a formal requisition from the Court of Directors, and to a\r\n  compliance with it on the part of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. That it would have been desirable, independently of political\r\n  considerations, to have taken advantage of the overland route at the\r\n  earliest possible period; and, apart from such considerations, it is\r\n  much to be regretted that the steps that were taken in September to\r\n  transmit small bodies of troops by this route were not resorted to\r\n  at an earlier date. That the transport, however, of any large body\r\n  of troops would have required previous arrangements, and that the\r\n  evidence laid before the committee leaves great room to doubt\r\n  whether any considerable reinforcements could have been sent in the\r\n  months of July and August, with a prospect of their arrival in India\r\n  so far in advance of those sent round the Cape as to give any great\r\n  advantage in favour of this route.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. That although the overland route may be advantageously employed\r\n  in times of emergency, it would not be advisable that it should be\r\n  relied upon as the ordinary route for the transmission of troops to\r\n  India.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. That if steamers had been used in greater numbers, the\r\n  reinforcements would have reached India more quickly than they did\r\n  by sailing-vessels; but that no evidence has been laid before the\r\n  committee to shew that, at the time the emergency arose, a greater\r\n  amount of steam-transport was attainable; whilst it has been shewn\r\n  that grave doubts existed whether the supply of coal on the route\r\n  would have been sufficient for a larger number of steam-vessels than\r\n  were actually employed.\r\n\r\n  ‘7. That steamers should for the future be always made use of, as\r\n  far as possible, in urgent cases; but that, for the transmission of\r\n  the ordinary reliefs, the committee would not recommend the adoption\r\n  of so costly a mode of transport.\r\n\r\n  ‘8. That the governors of Ceylon and the Mauritius gave early and\r\n  valuable assistance to the government of India, and deserve great\r\n  praise for the zeal and promptitude with which they acted; that the\r\n  governor of the Cape, without loss of time, forwarded treasure and\r\n  horses, together with a portion of the troops at his disposal, but\r\n  that he did not send the whole amount of the force which he was\r\n  instructed by the home government to transmit to India; that the\r\n  committee have not the means of judging whether the circumstances of\r\n  the colony did or did not justify Sir George Grey in taking this\r\n  course.\r\n\r\n  ‘9. That the committee observe with satisfaction that the people of\r\n  Canada displayed great readiness to afford assistance to the\r\n  mother-country, and that the committee are of opinion that it is\r\n  highly desirable to give every encouragement to such demonstrations\r\n  of loyalty on the part of the colonies.\r\n\r\n  ‘10. That on the whole, considering the suddenness of the danger,\r\n  and the distance to which the troops were to be sent, the committee\r\n  are of opinion that great credit is due to the Court of Directors of\r\n  the East India Company for the promptitude and efficiency with which\r\n  they discharged the difficult task of transmitting reinforcements to\r\n  the army in India during the past year.’\r\n\r\n  From the tenor of this report, it is evident that the East India\r\n  directors were ready to adopt the overland route before the\r\n  government gave in their adhesion. The ‘political reasons’ for\r\n  avoiding that route were connected with the relations between Egypt\r\n  and various European countries: relations often involving jealousy\r\n  and diplomatic intrigue, and likely to be thrown into some\r\n  perplexity by the passage of troops belonging to another nation. The\r\n  ministers were unwilling to speak out plainly on this point,\r\n  possibly for fear of giving offence to France; and the committee,\r\n  though sorely against the wish of some of its members, refrained\r\n  from pressing them on this point; hence the cautious phraseology of\r\n  the report, throwing a sort of shield over the government.\r\n\r\n  In reference to the proceedings connected with the transport of\r\n  troops to India, it may be well to advert to a few dates. The home\r\n  government received, on the 9th of April, the first intimation that\r\n  a disaffected spirit had made its appearance among the native troops\r\n  at Barrackpore. On the 19th of May, Lord Ellenborough inquired in\r\n  the House of Lords whether reinforcements were being sent to India;\r\n  a reply in the affirmative was given, accompanied by an expression\r\n  of opinion that the disaffection was of very minor character.\r\n  Shortly afterwards, in the House of Commons, a similar belief was\r\n  expressed by members of the government that the occurrences at\r\n  Barrackpore were trifling, not likely to lead to serious results. At\r\n  that period, as we have already seen,[175] the Bengal presidency,\r\n  including the vast range of territory from Pegu to Peshawur,\r\n  contained about 23,000 European troops and 119,000 native; the\r\n  Madras presidency, 10,000 European and 50,000 native; the Bombay\r\n  presidency, 5000 European and 31,000 native—making a total of about\r\n  38,000 Company’s and Queen’s European troops, and 200,000 native.\r\n  These, the actual numbers, were exclusive of the large brigades of\r\n  the Bombay army at that time engaged in, or not yet returned from,\r\n  the Persian expedition. During May, the government and the East\r\n  India directors decided that more European troops ought to be in\r\n  India, in consideration both of the condition of India itself, and\r\n  of the incidence of war in Persia and China; and the early dispatch\r\n  of four regiments was decided on. At length, on the 27th of June,\r\n  arrived a telegram announcing the revolt at Meerut and the seizure\r\n  of Delhi by the mutineers. While Lord Elgin on the way to China,\r\n  Lord Harris at Madras, Lord Elphinstone at Bombay, Sir Henry Ward at\r\n  Ceylon, Sir James Higginson at Mauritius, and Sir George Grey at the\r\n  Cape of Good Hope, were using their best exertions to send troops to\r\n  aid Viscount Canning, the home authorities considered what best\r\n  could be done in furnishing reinforcements from England. There were\r\n  no less than 13,000 troops at the Cape of Good Hope at that time,\r\n  including ten regiments of Queen’s infantry; it was fully believed\r\n  in England that the governor might well have spared the greater\r\n  portion of these troops; and the smallness of the number really\r\n  contributed by him led to much disappointment in India, and much\r\n  adverse criticism in England.\r\n\r\n  When the authorities at the War-office commenced their arrangements\r\n  for despatching troops to India, they had to provide for a\r\n  sea-voyage of about fourteen thousand miles. A question arose\r\n  whether, without changing the route or shortening the distance, the\r\n  duration of the voyage might not be lessened by the employment of\r\n  steam-vessels instead of sailing-ships. The Admiralty, and most\r\n  members of the government, opposed this change on various grounds,\r\n  principally in relation to difficulties in the supply of fuel, but\r\n  partly in relation to monsoons and other winds. By the 10th of July,\r\n  out of 31 vessels chartered by the government and the Company for\r\n  conveying troops to India, nearly all were sailing-ships. A change\r\n  of feeling took place about that date; the nation estimated time to\r\n  be so valuable, that the authorities were almost coerced into the\r\n  chartering of some of the noble merchant-steamers, the rapid voyages\r\n  of which were already known. Between the 10th of July and the 1st of\r\n  December, 59 ships were chartered, of which 29 were screw-steamers.\r\n  The autumnal averages of passages to India were greatly in favour of\r\n  steamers. Within a certain number of weeks there were 62 troop-laden\r\n  ships despatched from England to one or other of the ports,\r\n  Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Kurachee; the average duration of all the\r\n  voyages was 120 days by sailing-vessels, and only 83 days by\r\n  steamers—a diminution of nearly one-third. Extending the list of\r\n  ships to a later date, so as to include a greater number, it was\r\n  found that 82 ships carried 30,378 troops from the United Kingdom to\r\n  India—thus divided: 66 sailing-ships carried 16,234 men, averaging\r\n  299 each; 27 steamers carried 14,144, averaging 522 each. It was\r\n  calculated that 14,000 of these British soldiers arrived in India\r\n  _five weeks earlier_, by the adoption of steam instead of\r\n  sailing-vessels. It is impossible to estimate what amount of change\r\n  might have been produced in the aspect of Indian affairs, had these\r\n  steam-voyages been made in the summer rather than in the autumn; it\r\n  might not have been permitted to the mutineers to rule triumphant at\r\n  Lucknow till the spring of the following year, or the fidelity of\r\n  wavering chieftains to give way under the long continuance of the\r\n  struggle.\r\n\r\n  Besides the two inquiries concerning the promptness with which\r\n  troops were sent, and the kind of vessels employed to convey them,\r\n  there was a third relating to the route adopted. From the earliest\r\n  news of the revolt at Meerut, many persons in and out of parliament\r\n  strenuously recommended the use of the overland route, as being much\r\n  shorter than any possible ocean-route. The Court of Directors viewed\r\n  this proposal more favourably than the government. Until the month\r\n  of September, ‘political difficulties’ were dimly hinted at by\r\n  ministers, but without any candid explanations; and as the\r\n  objections gave way in the month just named, the nation arrived at a\r\n  pretty general conclusion that these difficulties had never been of\r\n  a very insurmountable character. It is only fair to state, however,\r\n  that many experienced men viewed the overland route with distrust,\r\n  independently of any political considerations. They adverted to the\r\n  incompleteness of the railway arrangements between Alexandria and\r\n  Cairo; to the difficulty of troops marching or riding over the sandy\r\n  desert from Cairo to Suez; to the wretchedness of Suez as a place of\r\n  re-embarkation; and to the unhealthiness of a voyage down the Red\r\n  Sea in hot summer weather. Nevertheless, it was an important fact\r\n  that the East India directors, most of whom possessed personal\r\n  knowledge concerning the routes to India, urged the government from\r\n  the first to send at least a portion of the troops by the Suez\r\n  route. It was not until the 19th of September that assent was given;\r\n  and the 13th of October witnessed the arrival of the first\r\n  detachment of English troops into the Indian Ocean _viâ_ Suez. These\r\n  started from Malta on the 1st of the month. On the 2d of October,\r\n  the first regiment started from England direct, to take the overland\r\n  route to India. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam-navigation\r\n  Company, having practically almost a monopoly of the Suez route,\r\n  conveyed the greater portion of the troops sent in this way; and it\r\n  may be useful to note the length of journey in the principal\r\n  instances. The following are tabulated examples giving certain\r\n  items—such as, the name of the steamer, the date of leaving England,\r\n  the number of troops conveyed, and the time of reaching Alexandria,\r\n  to commence the overland portion of the journey:\r\n\r\n              Steamer.   Left England. No. of    Days to\r\n                                       Troops. Alexandria.\r\n             _Sultan_,   1857. Oct.  2     248 13 days.\r\n             _Dutchman_,       Oct. 14     256 17 days.\r\n             _Sultan_,         Nov. 17     264 14 days.\r\n             _Euxine_,         Dec.  2     236 15 days.\r\n             _Indus_,          Dec.  4      83 14 days.\r\n             _Abeona_,         Dec.  8     861 15 days.\r\n             _Pera_,     1858. Feb.  4     231 15 days.\r\n             _Ripon_,          Feb. 11     242 15 days.\r\n             _Sultan_,         Feb. 24     244 13 days.\r\n             _Malabar_,        Mar. 11     264 14 days.\r\n             _Ripon_,          Mar. 27     420 14 days.\r\n             _Benares_,        Apr.  8     607 17 days.\r\n\r\n  Thus the voyage was made on an average in about 14½ days, from the\r\n  shores of England to those of Egypt. The landing at Alexandria, the\r\n  railway journey to Cairo, the journey by vans and donkeys across the\r\n  desert, the short detention at Suez, and the embarkation in another\r\n  steamer at that port, occupied a number of days varying from 2 to\r\n  17—depending chiefly on the circumstance whether or not a steamer\r\n  was ready at Suez to receive the troops when they arrived from\r\n  Alexandria; the average was about 5½ days. From Suez the voyages\r\n  were made to Kurachee, Bombay, Ceylon, Madras, or Calcutta. The\r\n  steamers took forward all the troops mentioned in the above list, as\r\n  well as others which reached Alexandria by other means. Most of\r\n  these troops were landed at Bombay or Kurachee, as being nearer than\r\n  Calcutta; and the average length of voyage was just 16 days. The\r\n  result, then, presented was this:\r\n\r\n               England to Alexandria, 14½ days’ average.\r\n               Alexandria to Suez,     5½ days’ average.\r\n               Suez to India,         16  days’ average.\r\n                                      ———\r\n                                      36  days’ average.\r\n\r\n  Those which went to Calcutta instead of Bombay or Kurachee, were\r\n  about 3 days longer. Comparing these figures with those before\r\n  given, we arrive at the following remarkable conclusion:\r\n\r\n              Sailing-ships round Cape, 120 days’ average.\r\n              Steamers round Cape,       83 days’ average.\r\n              Suez route,                36 days’ average.\r\n\r\n  This, as a question of time, triumphantly justified all that had\r\n  been said by the advocates of the shortest route; nor did it appear\r\n  that there were any counterbalancing disadvantages experienced.\r\n  Between the 6th of November 1857, and the 18th of May 1858, more\r\n  than 5000 officers and soldiers landed in India, who had travelled\r\n  by the Suez overland route from England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  ‘With the concurrence of the government, the commander-in-chief is\r\n  pleased to direct that white clothing shall be discontinued in the\r\n  European regiments of the Honourable Company’s army; and that for the\r\n  future the summer-clothing of the European soldiers shall consist of\r\n  two suits of “khakee,” corresponding in pattern and material with the\r\n  clothing recently sanctioned for the royal army of England.

Although well known to persons connected with India as a gallant\r\nofficer belonging to the Bombay army, Rose’s military services were not\r\n‘household words’ in the mother-country. Henry Havelock had made himself\r\nthe hero of the wars of the mutiny by victories won in a time when the\r\nprospects were stern and gloomy; and it was not easy for others to\r\nbecome heroes of like kind, when compared in the popular mind with such\r\na noble soldier. Hence it may possibly be that the relative merits of\r\nCampbell, Havelock, Neill, Wilson, Nicholson, Outram, Hope Grant,\r\nInglis, Rose, Roberts, Napier, Eyre, Greathed, Jones, Smith, Lugard, and\r\nother officers, as military leaders, will remain undecided for a long\r\nperiod—until dispatches, memoirs, and journals have thrown light on the\r\nminuter details of the operations. Be this as it may, Sir Hugh Rose won\r\nfor himself a high name by a series of military exploits skilfully\r\nconceived and brilliantly executed.\r\n\r\nTo understand the true scope of Rose’s proceedings in the months of May\r\nand June, it may be well to recapitulate briefly the state of matters at\r\nthe close of the preceding month.\r\n\r\nAfter Sir Hugh—with the 1st brigade of his Central India Field-force\r\nunder Brigadier Stuart, and the 2d brigade under Brigadier Steuart—had\r\ncaptured the important city of Jhansi, in the early part of April, his\r\nsubsequent proceedings were determined according to the manœuvres of the\r\nrebels elsewhere. Jhansi, as the strongest and most important place in\r\nBundelcund, was a valuable conquest; but as the Ranee and Tanteea\r\nTopee—the one chieftainess of Jhansi, and the other a representative of\r\nthe Mahratta influence of Nena Sahib in these parts—had escaped, with\r\nthe greater part of their rebel troops, it became necessary to continue\r\nthe attack against them wherever they might be. The safety of Jhansi,\r\nthe succour of the sick and wounded, and the reconstruction of his\r\nfield-force, detained Rose in that city until the 25th of the month; but\r\nMajors Orr and Gall were in the interim actively employed in chasing and\r\ndefeating various bodies of rebels in the surrounding country. Orr was\r\nsent from Jhansi across the river Betwah to Mhow, to clear that region\r\nfrom insurgents, and then to join Rose on the way to Calpee; he captured\r\na small fort at Goorwai, near the Betwah, and kept a sharp watch on the\r\nproceedings of the rebel Rajahs of Banpore and Shagurh. Gall, with two\r\nsquadrons of the 14th Dragoons and three 9-pounders, was commissioned to\r\nreconnoitre the position and proceedings of the rebels on the Calpee\r\nroad; he captured the fort of Lohare, belonging to the insurgent Rajah\r\nof Sumpter. Hearing that Tanteea Topee, Ram Rao Gobind, and other\r\nleaders, had made Calpee a stronghold, and intended to dispute the\r\npassage of the road from Jhansi to that place, Rose laid his plans\r\naccordingly. Calpee, though not a large place, was important as being on\r\nthe right bank of the Jumna, and on the main road from Jhansi to\r\nCawnpore. During the later days of April, Sir Hugh was on the road to\r\nCalpee with the greater part of his two brigades; the rest of his\r\ntroops, under Orr, Gall, and one or two other officers, being engaged in\r\ndetached services. At that same time, General Whitlock, after defeating\r\nmany bodies of rebels in and near the Banda district, was gradually\r\ntending towards a junction with Rose at Calpee; while General Roberts\r\nwas at Kotah, keeping a vigilant eye on numerous turbulent bands in\r\nRajpootana.\r\n\r\nWhen May arrived, Sir Hugh, needing the services of Majors Orr and Gall\r\nwith his main force, requested General Whitlock to watch the districts\r\nin which those two officers had been engaged. Being joined on the 8th by\r\nhis second brigade (except the regiments and detachments left to guard\r\nJhansi), he resumed his march on the 9th. News reached him that Tanteea\r\nTopee and the Ranee intended to dispute his passage towards Calpee at a\r\nplace called Koonch, with a considerable force of cavalry and infantry.\r\nAs soon as he arrived at Koonch, he engaged the enemy, drove them from\r\ntheir intrenchment, entered the town, cut them up severely, pursued them\r\nto a considerable distance, and captured several guns. The heat on this\r\noccasion was fearful. Rose himself was three times during the day\r\ndisabled by the sun, but on each occasion rallied, and was able to\r\nremount; he caused buckets of cold water to be dashed on him, and then\r\nresumed the saddle, all wet as he was. Thirteen of his gallant but\r\noverwrought soldiers were killed by sun-stroke. Nothing daunted by this\r\nsevere ordeal, he marched on to Hurdwee, Corai, Ottah, and other\r\nvillages obscure to English readers, capturing a few more guns as he\r\nwent. Guided by the information which reached him concerning the\r\nproceedings of the rebels, Sir Hugh, when about ten miles from Calpee,\r\nbent his line of march slightly to the west, in order to strike the\r\nJumna near Jaloun, a little to the northwest of Calpee. He had also\r\narranged that Colonel Riddell, with a column from Etawah, should move\r\ndown upon Calpee from the north; that Colonel Maxwell, with a column\r\nfrom Cawnpore, should advance from the east; and that General Whitlock\r\nshould watch the country at the south. The purpose of this combination\r\nevidently was, not only that Calpee should be taken, but that all\r\noutlets for the escape of the rebels should as far as possible be\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, the two brigades of Rose’s force joined at a point about\r\nsix miles from Calpee. A large mass of the enemy here made a dash at the\r\nbaggage and rear-guard, but were driven off without effecting much\r\nmischief. When he reached the Jumna, Rose determined to encamp for a\r\nwhile in a well-watered spot; and was enabled, by a personal visit from\r\nColonel Maxwell, to concert further plans with him, to be put in force\r\non the arrival of Maxwell’s column. On the 16th, a strong reconnoitring\r\ncolumn under Major Gall proceeded along the Calpee road; it consisted of\r\nvarious detachments of infantry, cavalry, and horse-artillery. On the\r\nsame day, the second brigade was attacked by the enemy in great force,\r\nand was not relieved without a sharp skirmish. On the 17th, the enemy\r\nmade another attack, which was, however, repulsed with less difficulty.\r\nNena Sahib’s nephew was believed to be the leader of the rebels on these\r\ntwo occasions. It was not until the 18th that Rose could begin shelling\r\nthe earthworks which they had thrown up in front of the town. Greatly to\r\ntheir astonishment, the enemy found that Maxwell arrived at the opposite\r\nbank of the Jumna on the 19th, to assist in bombarding the place; they\r\napparently had not expected this, and were not prepared with defences on\r\nthat side. On the 20th, they came out in great force on the hills and\r\nnullahs around the town, attempted to turn the flank of Sir Hugh’s\r\nposition, and displayed a determination and perseverance which they had\r\nnot hitherto exhibited; but they were, as usual, driven in again. On the\r\n21st, a portion of Maxwell’s column crossed the Jumna and joined Rose;\r\nwhile his heavy artillery and mortars were got into position. On the\r\n22d, Maxwell’s batteries opened fire across the river, and continued it\r\nthroughout the night, while Sir Hugh was making arrangements for the\r\nassault. The rebels, uneasy at the prospect before them, and needing\r\nnothing but artillery to reply to Maxwell’s fire, resolved to employ the\r\nrest of their force in a vigorous attack on Rose’s camp at Gulowlie.\r\nAccordingly, on that same day, the 22d, they issued forth from Calpee in\r\ngreat force, and attacked him with determination. Rose’s right being\r\nhard pressed by them, he brought up his reserve corps, charged with the\r\nbayonet, and repulsed the assailants at that point. Then moving his\r\nwhole line forward, he put the enemy completely to rout. In these\r\nassaults, the rebels had the advantage of position; the country all\r\nround Calpee was very rugged and uneven, with steep ravines and numerous\r\nnullahs; insomuch that Rose had much difficulty in bringing his\r\nartillery into position. The assaults were made by numbers estimated at\r\nnot far less than fifteen thousand men. The 71st and 86th foot wrought\r\nterrible destruction amongst the dense masses of the enemy. About noon\r\non the 23d, the victorious Sir Hugh marched on from Gulowlie to Calpee.\r\nThe enemy, who were reported to have chosen Calpee as a last\r\nstand-point, and to have sworn either to destroy Sir Hugh’s army or to\r\ndie in the attempt, now forgot their oath; they fled panic-stricken\r\nafter firing a few shot, and left him master of the town and fort of\r\nCalpee. This evacuation was hastened by the effect of Maxwell’s\r\nbombardment from the other side of the river.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the wars of the mutiny, the mutineers succeeded\r\nin escaping after defeat; they neither surrendered as prisoners of war,\r\nnor remained in the captured towns to be slaughtered. They were nimble\r\nand on the watch, knew the roads and jungles well, and had generally\r\ngood intelligence of what was going on; while the British were seldom or\r\nnever in such force as to be enabled completely to surround the places\r\nbesieged: as a consequence, each siege ended in a flight. Thus it had\r\nbeen in Behar, Oude, the Doab, and Rohilcund; and thus Rose and his\r\ncoadjutors found it in Bundelcund, Rajpootana, and Central India. Sir\r\nHugh had given his troops a few hours’ repose after the hot work of the\r\n22d; and this respite seems to have encouraged the rebels to flee from\r\nthe beleaguered town; but they would probably have succeeded in doing\r\nthe same thing, though with greater loss, if he had advanced at once.\r\nThe British had lost about forty commissariat carts, laden with tea,\r\nsugar, arrack, and medical comforts; but their loss in killed and\r\nwounded throughout these operations was very inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose inferred, from the evidences presented to his notice, that\r\nthe rebels had considered Calpee an arsenal and a point of great\r\nimportance. Fifteen guns were kept in the fort, of which one was an\r\n18-pounder of the Gwalior Contingent, and two others 9-pounder mortars\r\nmade by the rebels. Twenty-four standards were found, one of which had\r\nbelonged to the Kotah Contingent, while most of the rest were the\r\ncolours of the several regiments of the Gwalior Contingent. A\r\nsubterranean magazine was found to contain ten thousand pounds of\r\nEnglish powder in barrels, nine thousand pounds of shot and empty\r\nshells, a quantity of eight-inch filled shrapnell-shells, siege and ball\r\nammunition, intrenching tools of all kinds, tents new and old, boxes of\r\nnew flint and percussion muskets, and ordnance stores of all kinds—worth\r\nseveral lacs of rupees. There were also three or four cannon foundries\r\nin the town, with all the requisites for a wheel and gun-carriage\r\nmanufactory. In short, it was an arsenal, which the rebels hoped and\r\nintended to hold to the last; but Sir Hugh’s victory at Gulowlie, and\r\nhis appearance at Calpee, gave them a complete panic: they thought more\r\nof flight than of fighting.\r\n\r\nThe question speedily arose, however—Whither had the rebels gone? Their\r\nlosses were very large, but the bulk of the force had unquestionably\r\nescaped. Some, it was found, had crossed the Jumna into the Doab, by a\r\nbridge of boats which had eluded the search of the British; but the\r\nrest, enough to form an army of no mean strength, finding that Rose had\r\nnot fully guarded the side of Calpee leading to Gwalior, retreated by\r\nthat road with amazing celerity. Sir Hugh thereupon organised a flying\r\ncolumn to pursue them, under the command of Colonel Robertson. This\r\ncolumn did not effect much, owing in part to the proverbial celerity of\r\nthe rebels, and in part also to difficulties of other kinds. Heavy rains\r\non the first two days rendered the roads almost impassable, greatly\r\nretarding the progress of the column. The enemy attempted to make a\r\nstand at Mahona and Indoorkee, two places on the road; but when they\r\nheard of the approach of Robertson, they continued their retreat in the\r\ndirection of Gwalior. The column reached Irawan on the 29th; and there a\r\nbrief halt was made until commissariat supplies could be sent up from\r\nCalpee. An officer belonging to the column adverted, in a private\r\nletter, to certain symptoms that the villagers were becoming tired of\r\nthe anarchy into which their country had been thrown. ‘The feeling of\r\nthe country is strong against the rebels now, whatever it may have been;\r\nand the rural population has welcomed our advent in the most\r\nunmistakable manner. At the different villages as we go along, many of\r\nthem come out and meet us with earthen vessels full of water, knowing it\r\nto be our greatest want in such weather; and at our camping-ground they\r\nfurnish us voluntarily with supplies of grain, grass, &c., in the most\r\nliberal manner. They declare the rebels plundered them right and left,\r\nand that they are delighted to have the English raj once more. It is not\r\nonly the inhabitants of the towns and villages where we encamp who are\r\nso anxious to evince their good feeling; but the people, for miles\r\nround, have been coming to make their salaam, bringing forage for our\r\ncamp with them, and thanking us for having delivered them from their\r\noppressors. They say that for a year they have had no peace; but they\r\nhave now a hope that order will be once more restored.’ Concerning this\r\nstatement it may suffice to remark, that though the villagers were\r\nunquestionably in worse plight under the rebels than under the British,\r\ntheir obsequious protestations to that effect were not always to be\r\ndepended on; their fears gave them duplicity, inducing them to curry\r\nfavour with whichever side happened at the moment to be greatest in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nColonel Robertson, though he inflicted some loss on the fugitives, did\r\nnot materially check them. His column—comprising the 25th Bombay native\r\ninfantry, the 3d Bombay native cavalry, and 150 Hyderabad horse—pursued\r\nthe rebels on the Gwalior road, but did not come up with the main body.\r\nOn the 2d of June he was joined by two squadrons of the 14th dragoons, a\r\nwing of the 86th foot, and four 9-pounders. On the next day, when at\r\nMoharar, about midway between Calpee and Gwalior (fifty-five miles from\r\neach) he heard news of startling import from the last-named\r\ncity—presently to be noticed. About the same time Brigadier Steuart\r\nmarched to Attakona on the Gwalior road, with H.M. 71st, a wing of the\r\n86th, a squadron of the 14th Dragoons, and some guns, to aid in the\r\npursuit of the rebels.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were in progress on the south of the Jumna, Colonel\r\nRiddell was advancing from the northwest on the north side of the same\r\nriver. On the 16th of May, Riddell was at Graya, with the 3d Bengal\r\nEuropeans, Alexander’s Horse, and two guns; he had a smart skirmish with\r\na party of rebels, who received a very severe defeat. Some of the Etawah\r\ntroops floated down the Jumna in boats, under the charge of Mr Hume, a\r\nmagistrate, and safely joined Sir Hugh at Calpee. On their way they were\r\nattacked by a body of insurgents much more numerous than themselves;\r\nwhereupon Lieutenant Sheriff landed with a hundred and fifty men at\r\nBhijulpore, brought the rebels to an engagement, defeated them, drove\r\nthem off, and captured four guns with a large store of ammunition. On\r\nthe 25th, when on the banks of the Jumna some distance above Calpee,\r\nColonel Riddell saw a camp of rebels on the other side, evidently\r\nresting a while after their escape on the 23d; he sent the 2d Bengal\r\nEuropeans across, and captured much of the camp-equipage—the enemy not\r\nwaiting to contest the matter with him.\r\n\r\nWhen Calpee had been securely taken, and flying columns had gone off in\r\npursuit of the enemy, to disperse if not to capture, Sir Hugh Rose\r\nconceived that the arduous labours of his Central India Field-force were\r\nfor a time ended, and that his exhausted troops might take rest. He\r\nissued to them a glowing address, adverting with commendable pride to\r\nthe unswerving gallantry which they had so long exhibited: ‘Soldiers!\r\nyou have marched more than a thousand miles, and taken more than a\r\nhundred guns. You have forced your way through mountain-passes and\r\nintricate jungles, and over rivers. You have captured the strongest\r\nforts, and beaten the enemy, no matter what the odds, whenever you met\r\nhim. You have restored extensive districts to the government, and peace\r\nand order now where before for a twelvemonth were tyranny and rebellion.\r\nYou have done all this, and you never had a check. I thank you with all\r\nsincerity for your bravery, your devotion, and your discipline. When you\r\nfirst marched, I told you that you, as British soldiers, had more than\r\nenough of courage for the work which was before you, but that courage\r\nwithout discipline was of no avail; and I exhorted you to let discipline\r\nbe your watchword. You have attended to my orders. In hardships, in\r\ntemptations and danger, you have obeyed your general, and you have never\r\nleft your ranks; you have fought against the strong, and you have\r\nprotected the rights of the weak and defenceless, of foes as well as of\r\nfriends. I have seen you in the ardour of the combat preserve and place\r\nchildren out of harm’s way. This is the discipline of Christian\r\nsoldiers, and it is what has brought you triumphant from the shores of\r\nWestern India to the waters of the Jumna, and establishes without doubt\r\nthat you will find no place to equal the glory of your arms.’\r\n\r\nLittle did the gallant Sir Hugh suspect that the very day on which he\r\nissued this hearty and well-merited address (the 1st of June) would be\r\nmarked by the capture of Gwalior by the defeated Calpee rebels, the\r\nflight of Scindia to Agra, and the necessity for an immediate resumption\r\nof active operations by his unrested Central India Field-force.\r\n\r\nThe rebels, it afterwards appeared, having out-marched Colonel\r\nRobertson, arrived on the 30th of May at the Moorar cantonment, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Gwalior, the old quarters of the Gwalior Contingent.\r\nTanteea Topee, a leader whose activity was worthy of a better cause, had\r\npreceded them, to tamper with Scindia’s troops. The Maharajah, when he\r\nheard news of the rebels’ approach, sent an urgent message to Agra for\r\naid; but before aid could reach him, matters had arrived at a crisis.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Maharajah of Gwalior had all along been a remarkable\r\nand perilous one, calling for the exercise of an amount of sagacity and\r\nprudence rarely exhibited by so youthful a prince. Although only\r\ntwenty-three years of age, he had been for five years Maharajah in his\r\nown right, after shaking off a regency that had inflicted much misery on\r\nhis country; and during these five years his conduct had won the respect\r\nof the British authorities. The mutiny placed him in an embarrassing\r\nposition. The Gwalior Contingent, kept up by him in accordance with a\r\ntreaty with the Company, consisted mainly of Hindustanis and Oudians,\r\nstrongly in sympathy with their compatriots in the Jumna and Ganges\r\nregions. His own independent army, it is true, consisted chiefly of\r\nMahrattas, a Hindoo race having little in common with the Hindustanis;\r\nbut he could not feel certain how long either of the two armies would\r\nremain faithful. After many doubtful symptoms, in July 1857, as we have\r\nseen in former chapters, the Gwalior Contingent went over in a body to\r\nthe enemy—thus adding ten or twelve thousand disciplined and well-armed\r\ntroops to the rebel cause. Scindia contrived for two or three months to\r\nremain on neutral terms with the Contingent—on the one hand, not\r\nsanctioning their proceedings: on the other, not bringing down their\r\nenmity upon himself. During the winter they were engaged in encounters\r\nat various places, which have been duly noticed in the proper chapters.\r\nWhen Sir Hugh Rose’s name had become as much known and feared in Central\r\nIndia as Havelock’s had been in the Northwest Provinces many months\r\nbefore, the rebels began to look to Gwalior, the strongest city in that\r\npart of India, as a possible place of permanent refuge; and many of the\r\nMahratta and Rajpoot chieftains appear to have come to an agreement,\r\nthat if Scindia would not join them against the British, they would\r\nattack him, dethrone him, and set up another Maharajah in his stead.\r\nMeanwhile the Gwalior prince, a brave and shrewd man, as well as a\r\nfaithful ally, looked narrowly at the circumstances that surrounded him.\r\nHe had some cause to suspect his own national or regular army, but\r\ndeemed it best to conceal his suspicions. There was every cause for\r\napprehension, therefore, on his part, when he found a large body of\r\ninsurgent troops approaching his capital—especially as some of the\r\nregiments of the old Gwalior Contingent were among the number.\r\n\r\nAlthough aid from Agra or Calpee had not arrived, Scindia had courage\r\nand skill enough to make a bold stand against them, if his own troops\r\nhad proved faithful; but treachery effected that which fair fighting\r\nmight not easily have done. Scindia’s body-guard remained faithful. Such\r\nwas not, however, the case with the bulk of his infantry, who had been\r\ntampered with by Tanteea Topee, and had agreed to desert their sovereign\r\nin his hour of greatest need. This was doubtless the motive of the rebel\r\nleader in preceding the march of the Calpee fugitives. When the struggle\r\nbegan, Scindia’s force comprised two or three thousand cavalry, six\r\nthousand infantry, and eight guns; that of the enemy consisted of four\r\nthousand cavalry, seven thousand infantry, and twelve guns—no\r\noverwhelming disparity, if Scindia’s own troops had been true. The\r\nrebels did not want for leaders; seeing that they had the Ranee of\r\nJhansi, the Nawab of Banda, Tanteea Topee, Rao Sahib, Ram Rao Gobind,\r\nand Luchmun Nena. Rao Sahib, nephew of the Nena, was the nominal leader\r\nof the Mahrattas in this motley force; but Tanteea Topee was really the\r\nman of action and power. Certainly the most remarkable among the number\r\nwas the Ranee of Jhansi, a woman who—but for her cruelty to the English\r\nat that station—would command something like respect. Whether she had\r\nbeen unjustly treated by the Company, in relation to the ‘annexations’\r\nin former years, was one among many questions of a similar kind on which\r\nopinions were divided; but supposing her to be sincere in a belief that\r\nterritory had been wrongly taken from her, then did her conduct (barring\r\nher cruelty and her unbounded licentiousness) bear something like the\r\nstamp of heroism. At anyrate, she proved herself a very Amazon in these\r\nwarlike contests—riding like a man, bearing arms like a man, leading and\r\nfighting like a man, and exhorting her troops to contend to the last\r\nagainst the hated Feringhees.\r\n\r\nThe battle between the Maharajah and the insurgents was of brief\r\nduration. The enemy, at about seven o’clock on the morning of the 1st of\r\nJune, made their appearance in battle-array. Scindia took up a position\r\nabout two miles eastward of the Moorar cantonment; placing his troops in\r\nthree divisions, of which the centre was commanded by him in person. The\r\nrebels pushed on a cloud of mounted skirmishers, with zumborucks or\r\ncamel-guns; these were steadily confronted by Scindia’s centre division.\r\nBut now did the treachery appear. It is not quite clear whether the\r\nright and left divisions of his force remained idle during the fighting\r\nof the centre division, waited for the capture of guns as a signal for\r\nrevolt, marched over to the opposite side, and began to fire on such of\r\ntheir astonished companions as still remained true to Scindia; or\r\nwhether the left division went over at the commencement of the fighting,\r\nand was followed soon after by the right; but at anyrate the centre,\r\ncomprising the body-guard with some other troops, could not long contend\r\nagainst such immense odds. The body-guard fought manfully until half\r\ntheir number had fallen, and the rest fled. Scindia himself, too,\r\npowerless against such numerous opponents, sought safety in flight, and\r\nfortunately found it. Attended by a few faithful troops, the Maharajah\r\ngalloped off by way of the Saugor Tal, the Residency, and the Phool\r\nBagh, avoiding the Lashkar or permanent camp of his (late) army; he then\r\ntook to the open country, by the Dholpore road, and reached Agra two\r\ndays afterwards. The rebels sent a troop of cavalry sixteen or eighteen\r\nmiles in pursuit, but he happily kept ahead of them. Most of the members\r\nof his family fled to Seepree, while his courtiers were scattered in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nDirectly the Maharajah had thus been driven out of his capital, the\r\nrebels entered Gwalior, and endeavoured to form a regular government.\r\nThey chose Nena Sahib as ‘Peishwa,’ or head of all the Mahratta princes.\r\nThey next set up Rao Sahib, the Nena’s nephew, as chief of Gwalior.\r\nThese selections appear to have been assented to by Scindia’s traitorous\r\ntroops as well as by the other rebels. All the troops were to have a\r\ncertain number of months’ pay for their services in this achievement.\r\nThe army was nevertheless the great difficulty to be contended against\r\nby the rebel leaders. The insurgents from Calpee, and the newly revolted\r\ntroops of Scindia, had worked together for a common object in this\r\ninstance; but there was jealousy between them; and nothing could make\r\nthem continue together without the liberal distribution of money—partly\r\nas arrears of pay, partly as an advance. Ram Rao Gobind, who had long\r\nbefore been discharged from Scindia’s service for dishonesty, became\r\nprime-minister. The main bulk of the army, under the masculine Ranee of\r\nJhansi, remained encamped in a garden called the Phool Bagh, outside the\r\ncity; while pickets and guns were sent to guard all the roads of\r\napproach. The property of the principal inhabitants was sequestered, in\r\nreal or pretended punishment for friendliness towards the Maharajah and\r\nthe British. Scindia possessed an immense treasure in his palace, which\r\nhe could not take away in his flight; this the rebels seized, by the\r\nconnivance of the truculent treasurer, Ameerchand Batya; and it was out\r\nof this treasure they were enabled to reward the troops. They also\r\ndeclared a formal confiscation of all the royal property. Four petty\r\nMahratta chieftains in the district of Shakerwarree—named Kunughat,\r\nGholab Singh, Dooghur Shah, and Bukhtawar Singh—had some time previously\r\ndeclared themselves independent, and had been captured and imprisoned by\r\nScindia for so doing; these men were now set at liberty by the newly\r\nconstituted authorities, and received insignia and dresses of honour, on\r\ncondition of raising forces in their several localities to oppose any\r\nBritish troops who might attempt to cross the Chumbul and approach\r\nGwalior. The leaders mustered and reviewed their troops, plundered and\r\nburnt the civil station, and liberated such prisoners as they thought\r\nmight be useful to them. They also sent letters of invitation to the\r\nRajahs of Banpore, Shagurh, &c., to join them.\r\n\r\nThus did a body of rebels, collected from different quarters, and\r\nactuated by different motives, expel the Maharajah Scindia from the\r\nthrone of Gwalior, and install a government avowedly and bitterly\r\nhostile to him and to the British with whom he was in alliance.\r\nThroughout twelve months’ events at Gwalior, the more experienced of the\r\nCompany’s officers frequently directed their attention to a certain\r\nmember of Scindia’s family, in doubt whether treachery might have been\r\nexhibited in that quarter. This was a princess, advanced in life, whose\r\ninfluence at Gwalior was known to be considerable, and whose experience\r\nof the checkered politics of Indian princedoms had extended over a very\r\nlengthened period. She was known as the Baeza Baee of Gwalior. Sixty\r\nyears before the mutiny began, she was the beauty of the Deccan, the\r\nyoung bride of the victorious Dowlut Rao Scindia of 1797; and she lived\r\nthrough all the vicissitudes of those sixty years. During thirty years\r\nof married life she exercised great influence over her husband and the\r\ncourt of Gwalior, exhibiting more energy of purpose than is wont among\r\neastern women. In 1827 Scindia died without a legitimate son; and the\r\nwidow, in accordance with Indian custom, adopted a kinsman of the late\r\nMaharajah to be the new Scindia. The Baeza Baee as regent, and Moodkee\r\nRao as expectant rajah, had many quarrels during the next seven years:\r\nthese ended, in 1834, in the installation of the young man as rajah, and\r\nin the retirement of the widowed princess to Dholpore. Tumults\r\ncontinued; for the princess was considered the more skilful ruler of the\r\ntwo, and many of the Mahrattas of Gwalior wished her to continue as\r\nregent. Whether from justice, or from motives of cold policy, the\r\nBritish government sided with Scindia against the Baeza Baee; and she\r\nwas ordered to take up her abode in some district beyond the limits of\r\nthe Gwalior territory. In 1843, when Moodkee Rao Scindia died, this\r\nterritory came more closely than before under British influence; a new\r\nScindia was chosen, with the consent of the governor-general, from among\r\nthe relations of the deceased Maharajah; and with this new Scindia the\r\naged Baeza Baee appears to have resided until the time of the mutiny.\r\nNothing unfavourable was known against this venerable lady; but when it\r\nwas considered that she was a woman of great energy, and that many other\r\nnative princesses of great energy—such as the Ranee of Jhansi and the\r\nBegum of Oude—had thrown their influence in the scale against the\r\nEnglish, it was deemed proper to watch her movements. And this the more\r\nespecially, as she had some cause to complain of the English policy in\r\nthe Mahratta dominions in past years. Although watched, however, nothing\r\nappeared to justify suspicion of her complicity with the rebels.\r\n\r\nGreat was the anxiety at all the British stations when the news arrived\r\nthat Gwalior, the strongest and most important city in Central India,\r\nand the capital of a native sovereign uniformly true to the British\r\nalliance, had fallen into the hands of the rebels. In many minds a\r\ndesponding feeling was at once manifest; while those who did not despond\r\nfreely acknowledged that the situation was a critical one, calling for\r\nthe exercise of promptness, skill, and courage. All felt that the\r\nconqueror of Jhansi and Calpee was the fit man to undertake the\r\nreconquest of Gwalior, both from his military fame and from the\r\ncircumstances of his position—having around him many columns and corps\r\nwhich he could bring to one centre. It was in the true spirit of heroism\r\nthat Sir Hugh Rose laid aside all thoughts of self when the exigencies\r\nof the service called for his attention. He had won a complete victory\r\nat Calpee, and believed that in so doing he had crushed the rebels in\r\nBundelcund and Scindia’s territory. Then, and then only, did he think of\r\nhimself—of his exhausted frame, his mind worn by six months of\r\nunremitting duty, his brain fevered by repeated attacks of sun-stroke in\r\nthe fearful heat of that climate. He knew that he had honestly done his\r\npart, and that he might with the consent of every one claim an exemption\r\nfor a time from active service. He intended to go down to Bombay on\r\nsick-certificate—after having sent off a column in pursuit of the\r\nfleeing rebels, and made arrangements for his successor. Such were Sir\r\nHugh’s thoughts when June opened. The startling news from Gwalior,\r\nhowever, overturned all his plans. When he found that Scindia’s capital\r\nwas in the hands of the insurgents whom he had so recently beaten at\r\nCalpee, all thoughts concerning fatigue and heat, anxiety and sickness,\r\nwere promptly dismissed from his mind. He determined to finish the work\r\nhe had begun, by reconquering the great Mahratta city. No time was to be\r\nlost. Every day that Gwalior remained in the hands of the rebels would\r\nweaken the British prestige, and add strength to the audacity of the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh’s first measure was to request the presence of General Whitlock\r\nat Calpee, to hold that place safely during the operations further\r\nwestward. Whitlock was at Moudha, between Banda and Humeerpoor, when he\r\nheard the news; he at once advanced towards Calpee by the ford of the\r\nBetwah at Humeerpoor. Rose’s next step was to organise two brigades for\r\nrapid march to Gwalior. Of those brigades the infantry consisted of H.M.\r\n86th foot, a wing of the 71st Highlanders, a wing of the 3d Bombay\r\nEuropeans, the 24th and 25th Bombay native infantry, and the 5th\r\nHyderabad infantry; the cavalry comprised wings of the 4th and 14th\r\nDragoons, the 3d Hyderabad cavalry, and a portion of the 3d Bombay\r\nnative cavalry; the artillery and engineers consisted of a company of\r\nthe Royal Engineers, Bombay Sappers and Miners, Madras Sappers and\r\nMiners, two light field-batteries, Leslie’s troop of Bombay\r\nhorse-artillery, and a siege-train consisting of two 16-pounders, three\r\n18-pounders, eight 8-inch mortars, two 10-inch mortars, and one 8-inch\r\nhowitzer. The first of these two brigades was placed under the command\r\nof Brigadier C. S. Stuart, of the Bombay army; the second under\r\nBrigadier R. Napier, of the Bengal Engineers. Arrangements were made for\r\nthe co-operation of a third brigade from Seepree, under Brigadier Smith.\r\nOrders were at the same time given for bringing up Major Orr’s column\r\nfrom the south, and for joining it with Smith’s brigade somewhere on the\r\nroad to Gwalior; Colonel Maxwell, with the 5th Fusiliers and the 88th\r\nfoot, was invited to advance from Cawnpore to Calpee; while Colonel\r\nRiddell was instructed to cross the Chumbul with his Etawah column. Rose\r\ndid not know what might be the number of insurgents against whom he\r\nwould have to contend when he reached Gwalior, and on that account he\r\ncalled in reinforcements from various quarters.\r\n\r\nPushing on his two main brigades as rapidly as possible, Sir Hugh\r\nappeared in the vicinity of Gwalior on the ninth day after leaving\r\nCalpee—allowing his troops no more rest by the way than was absolutely\r\nneeded. On the evening of the 15th of June he was at Sepowlie, about ten\r\nmiles from the Moorar cantonment; and by six o’clock on the following\r\nmorning he reached the cantonment itself. Sir Hugh galloped forward with\r\nhis staff to a point about midway between the cantonment and the city;\r\nand there began to reconnoitre the position taken up by the enemy.\r\nGwalior is very remarkable as a military position, owing to the relation\r\nwhich the city bears to a strong and lofty hill-fort. ‘The rock on which\r\nthe hill-fort is situated,’ says Mr Thornton, ‘is completely isolated;\r\nthough seven hundred yards to the north is a conical hill surmounted by\r\na very remarkable building of stone; and on the southeast, south, and\r\nsouthwest, are similar hills, which form a sort of amphitheatre at the\r\ndistance of from one to four miles. The sandstone of the hill-fort is\r\narranged in horizontal strata, and its face presents so steep a fracture\r\nas to form a perpendicular precipice. Where the rock was naturally less\r\nprecipitous, it has been so scarped as to be rendered perpendicular; and\r\nin some places the upper part considerably overhangs the lower. The\r\ngreatest length of the rock, which is from northeast to southwest, is a\r\nmile and a half; the greatest breadth three hundred yards. The height at\r\nthe south end, where it is greatest, is 342 feet. On the eastern face of\r\nthe rock, several colossal figures are sculptured in bold relief. A\r\nrampart runs round the edge of the rock, conforming to the outline of\r\nits summit; and as its height is uniform above the verge, its top has an\r\nirregular appearance. The entrance within the enclosure of the rampart\r\nis towards the north end of the east side; first, by means of a steep\r\nroad, and higher up by steps cut in the face of the rock, of such a size\r\nand of so moderate a degree of acclivity that elephants easily make\r\ntheir way up. This huge staircase is protected on the outer side by a\r\nhigh and massive stone-wall, and is swept by several traversing guns\r\npointing down it: the passage up to the interior being through a\r\nsuccession of seven gates. The citadel is at the northeastern extremity\r\nof the enclosure, and has a very striking appearance. Adjoining is a\r\nseries of six lofty round towers or bastions, connected by curtains of\r\ngreat height and thickness. There are within the enclosure of the\r\nrampart several spacious tanks, capable of supplying an adequate\r\ngarrison; though fifteen thousand men would be required fully to man the\r\ndefences.’ The town of Gwalior, it may suffice to state, was situated\r\nalong the eastern base of the rock. The Lashkar, or permanent camp of\r\nthe Maharajah, stretch out from the southwest end of the rock; whereas\r\nthe Moorar, or cantonment of the old Gwalior Contingent, was on the\r\nopposite side of the town.\r\n\r\nSuch was the place which Sir Hugh Rose found it necessary to\r\nreconnoitre, preparatory to a siege. The hill-fort, the Lashkar, the\r\nMoorar, the city, and the semicircular belt of hills, all needed\r\nexamination, sufficient at least to determine at what points the rebel\r\narmy was distributed, and what defences had been thrown up. He found\r\nthat only a few troops were in the city itself, the main body being\r\nplaced in groups on and near the surrounding hills and cantonments.\r\nRumour assigned to the rebels a force of seventeen thousand men in arms;\r\nbut the means for testing the truth of this rumour were wanting.\r\n\r\nThe examination made by Rose led him to a determination to attack the\r\nMoorar cantonment suddenly, before the other portions of the rebels\r\ncould arrive from the more distant stations—to adopt, in fact, the\r\nNapoleon tactics, possible only when rapid movements are made. Brigadier\r\nSmith was operating on the hills south of the town, as we shall\r\npresently see; but Rose carried out his own portion of the attack\r\nindependently. Orders were at once given. The cavalry and guns were\r\nplaced on each flank; while the infantry, in two divisions, prepared to\r\nadvance. The 86th headed the attack, as part of the second brigade. No\r\nsooner did the enemy find themselves attacked, than they poured out a\r\nwell-directed fire of musketry and field-guns; but this was speedily\r\nsilenced, and the rebels forced to make a precipitate retreat. Many of\r\nthem escaped into the city over a stone-bridge, the existence of which\r\nwas not correctly known to Sir Hugh. Four pieces of ordnance were at the\r\nsame time dragged over the bridge to the Lashkar camp—somewhat to the\r\nvexation of the British, who wished to seize them: the capture, however,\r\nwas not long delayed. The main body of rebels, after being driven\r\nthrough the whole length of the cantonment, were chased over a wide\r\nexpanse of country. Some terrible fighting occurred during this chase.\r\nAt one spot a number of the enemy had been driven into a fortified\r\ntrench around a village, and here they maintained a desperate\r\nhand-to-hand struggle, until the trench was nearly choked with dead and\r\nwounded bodies. It was while rushing on at the head of a company of the\r\n71st Highlanders in this contest that Lieutenant Neave fell, mortally\r\nwounded. The rebels engaged in this struggle included several men of the\r\nMaharajah’s 1st regiment. A strong body of the enemy’s cavalry were\r\ndrawn up about half a mile from the bridge; but they did not venture\r\nforth; and Sir Hugh encamped for the night in the Moorar cantonment.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the first scene in the conquest. Sir Hugh had obtained\r\nsafe possession of the cantonment of Moorar, and had conquered and\r\nexpelled such of the insurgents as had taken up a position there.\r\nNevertheless this was only a preliminary measure; for the city and the\r\nrock-fort were still in the hands of the enemy. Either through want of\r\nmeans or want of foresight, the rebels had done little to strengthen\r\nthis fort; or, perchance, reposing on the Indian idea that that famous\r\nfortress was impregnable, they deemed such a precaution unnecessary.\r\nInstead of attending to that duty, they disposed their forces so as to\r\nguard the roads of approach from Indoorkee, Seepree, and other places;\r\nand it was in this field-service that the mail-clad Amazon, the Ranee of\r\nJhansi, engaged.\r\n\r\nWe must now trace the progress of Brigadier Smith, who had taken charge\r\nof the operations from the south, and who would need to obtain command\r\nof the hills southward of the city before he could reach Gwalior itself.\r\nThis active officer had to make a long march before he could reach the\r\nscene of conflict. His column—comprising a wing of the 8th Hussars, a\r\nwing of the Bombay Lancers, H.M. 95th foot, the 10th Native Bombay\r\ninfantry, and a troop of Bombay horse-artillery—started from Seepree,\r\nand was joined, on the 15th of June, at Antree, by Major Orr with his\r\nmen of the Hyderabad Contingent. Setting out from that place, the\r\nbrigadier, thus reinforced, arrived on the 17th at Kotah-ke-serai, a\r\nplace about eight miles from Gwalior, on the little river Oomrah. Here\r\nwas a small square fort, and also a native travellers’ bungalow (implied\r\nby the words _ke-serai_). As he approached this place, the brigadier\r\ncould see masses of the enemy’s cavalry and infantry in motion at the\r\nbase of some neighbouring hills—some of those already adverted to as\r\nforming a semicircular belt around the southern half of Gwalior. These\r\nhills it was necessary for him to cross to get to the Lashkar\r\ncamping-ground. Two companies of infantry, belonging to the 10th and\r\n95th regiments, were thrown across the river as skirmishers, with a\r\nsquadron of Hussars as videttes; while the rest of his column remained\r\nsouth of the river, to guard the ford and the fort. After a little\r\nskirmishing, some of his cavalry crossed the river, and came under the\r\nfire of a battery until then unperceived. Much sharp fighting ensued:\r\nthe enemy having been permitted to retain their hold of the hills on one\r\nside of the river, in consequence of a movement made by Smith under\r\nfalse information. The road from Jhansi to Gwalior crosses the hills\r\nthat lie southward of the Lashkar; and, before debouching from these\r\nhills, it runs for several hundred yards through a defile along which a\r\ncanal had been excavated; the eastern embankment of this canal, twenty\r\nor twenty-five feet in height, supplied an excellent cover for Smith’s\r\ntroops during their advance. It was while his column was thus marching\r\nthrough the defile, defended by three or four guns on a neighbouring\r\nhill, that the principal part of the day’s fighting took place. When\r\nnight came, Smith had secured the defile, the road, and the adjoining\r\nhills; while the enemy occupied the hills on the other side of the\r\ncanal. The most distinguished person who fell in this day’s fighting was\r\nthe Ranee of Jhansi—an Amazon to the last. The account given of her\r\ndeath is simply as follows: ‘The Ranee, in trying to escape over the\r\ncanal which separated the camp from the Phool Bagh parade, fell with her\r\nhorse, and was cut down by a Hussar; she still endeavoured to get over,\r\nwhen a bullet struck her in the breast, and she fell to rise no more.’\r\nThe natives are said to have hastily burned her dead body, to save it\r\nfrom apprehended desecration by the Feringhees. During the night between\r\nthe 17th and 18th, the enemy constructed a battery on one of their\r\nhills, from which they poured forth a well-directed fire, lessened in\r\nserious results by the greatness of the distance. It was not without\r\nmuch difficulty and constant firing that the brigadier, during the 18th,\r\nbecame master of the hills, and drove away the enemy, who were led with\r\nmuch energy by Tanteea Topee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GWALIOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile Brigadier Smith was thus closely engaged on the southern hills,\r\nSir Hugh Rose contented himself with maintaining his won position at the\r\nMoorar cantonment; he could not safely advance into the city until Smith\r\nhad achieved his portion of the work. On the 18th, when the brigadier\r\nhad surmounted some of the southern hills, Sir Hugh, seeing that the\r\nenemy’s strong positions were on that side of the city, joined him by a\r\nflank-movement of twelve miles—leaving only a sufficient number of\r\ntroops to guard his camp at the Moorar. Rose bivouacked for the night in\r\nrear of Smith’s position, thus enabling both to act together on the\r\nmorrow. The enemy still occupied some of the heights nearest to the\r\ncity; and from these heights, as well as from the rock-fort, on the\r\n19th, they poured out a fire of shot, shell, and shrapnell. Rose, after\r\nnarrowly examining the chief of the heights occupied by the enemy,\r\nresolve to capture it by storm. Two of the choice infantry regiments\r\nsent on in advance, ascended this height—the 71st on the right, the 86th\r\non the left; other regiments supported them; while the artillery was\r\nplied wherever the most effective result could be produced. The scheme\r\nrequired that some of the guns should be taken across the canal, in\r\norder to form a battery on one of the hills; and the sappers executed\r\nthis difficult work under a hot fire. The struggle was not a long one;\r\nthe infantry ran intrepidly up to the enemy’s guns, and captured them.\r\nThe height was now gained; and large masses of the enemy came full in\r\nview in the plain below. The rebels, losing heart at their failures,\r\nbecame panic-stricken when the height was taken; they began to flee in\r\nall directions. Then was the time for Rose’s cavalry to render useful\r\nservice; the troopers scoured the plain in all directions, cutting off\r\nthe wretched fugitives in large numbers. By four o’clock in the day,\r\nRose was master of Gwalior, to the inexpressible astonishment of the\r\nenemy. There was scarcely any fighting in the city itself, or in the\r\nLashkar camp; nor was there much firing from the rock-fort; when the\r\nheights were gained, the rebels gave way on all sides. While Brigadier\r\nSmith advanced with cavalry and artillery to occupy the plain of the\r\nPhool Bagh, Sir Hugh pushed on to the palace. Very little opposition was\r\nencountered; few of the enemy being met with either there or at the\r\nLashkar. After providing for the safety of the palace, by posting\r\nEuropeans and Bombay infantry at the entrances, Sir Hugh made\r\narrangements for the security of the city. This he found comparatively\r\neasy; for the regular inhabitants of the place had good reason to wish\r\nfor the suppression of the rebels, and gladly aided the conquerors in\r\nrestoring order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE RANEE OF JHANSI.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus, on the night of the 19th, Sir Hugh Rose was virtually conqueror,\r\nthough not thoroughly. The seizure of palace, city, and cantonments did\r\nnot necessarily imply the seizure of the rock-fort, the bold fortress\r\nwhich for ages has rendered Gwalior so famous in India. In point of\r\nfact, the conquest of this fort was deferred until the 20th; Sir Hugh\r\nlooked upon it as an easy achievement, because it became known that only\r\na few natives remained within the place. The conquest was not effected\r\nwithout causing the death of a gallant officer—Lieutenant Arthur Rose,\r\nof the 25th Bombay native infantry. As soon as the city had fallen into\r\nthe hands of the besiegers, the lieutenant was sent by the\r\ncommanding-officer of his regiment to guard the Kotwallee or\r\npolice-station. A shot or two being unexpectedly fired from the fort,\r\nRose proposed to a brother-officer, Lieutenant Waller, the daring\r\nproject of capturing it with the handful of men at their joint\r\ndisposal—urging that, though the risk would be great, the honour would\r\nbe proportionally great if the attempt succeeded. Off they started,\r\ntaking with them a blacksmith. This man, with his lusty arm and his\r\nheavy hammer, broke in the outermost or lowermost of the many gates that\r\nguarded the ascent of the rock on which the fort was situated; then\r\nanother, and another, until all the six gates were broken into, and\r\nentered by the little band of assailants. It is hardly to be expected,\r\nthat if the gates were really strong and securely fastened, they could\r\nhave been burst open in this way; but the confusion resulting from the\r\nfighting had probably caused some of the defensive arrangements to be\r\nneglected. At various points on the ascent the assailants were fired at\r\nby the few rebels in the place; and near the top a desperate\r\nhand-to-hand conflict took place, during which the numbers were thinned\r\non both sides. While Rose was encouraging his men in their hot work, a\r\nmusket was fired at him from behind a wall; and the bullet, striking him\r\non the right of the spine, passed through his body. The man who had\r\nfired the fatal shot, a Bareilly mutineer, then rushed out, and cut him\r\nacross the knee and the wrist with a sword. Waller came up, and\r\ndespatched this fellow, but too late to save the life of his poor friend\r\nRose.[176]\r\n\r\nSeveral days before the conquest of Gwalior was finally completed,\r\narrangements were made for reinstating Scindia upon the throne from\r\nwhich he had been so suddenly and unexpectedly hurled. Irrespective of\r\nthe justice of Scindia’s cause, Sir Robert Hamilton and Sir Hugh Rose\r\nwished him to return at once from Agra to Gwalior for another reason—to\r\nenable the British to judge who among the townsmen deserved punishment,\r\nand who were worthy of forgiveness. It was also very important to shew\r\nthat the government meant promptly and firmly to support so faithful a\r\nman, as an encouragement to other native princes to maintain faith with\r\nthe British. Even before Rose had reached Gwalior, and when the result\r\nof the approaching battle could not in any degree be foreseen, Hamilton,\r\nas political resident at the court of Gwalior, sent a dispatch to\r\nScindia at Agra, requesting him to move down at once to the Chumbul,\r\nthat he might be in readiness to present himself at Gwalior whenever the\r\nproper time should arrive. Accordingly the temporarily dethroned\r\nMaharajah set out from Agra on the 13th of June with all his retinue,\r\nescorted by a party of Meade’s Horse, and by some of his own troopers\r\nwho still remained faithful. He reached Dholpore on the 15th, where he\r\njoined Colonel Riddell’s column. On the next he faintly heard the roar\r\nof cannon at his capital, thirty-seven miles distant; and in the evening\r\nan express arrived from Sir Robert Hamilton, announcing the capture of\r\nthe cantonment—the first stage towards the capture of Gwalior itself.\r\nCrossing the Chumbul, and mounting his horse, Scindia galloped off, and\r\nrode all night, reaching Gwalior on the 17th. During the next three\r\ndays, the presence and advice of the Maharajah were very valuable to the\r\nBritish authorities, contributing much towards the final conquest. On\r\nthe 20th, when all the fighting was well-nigh over, Scindia was restored\r\nto his throne with as much oriental pomp as could be commanded in the\r\nlimited time: Rose, Hamilton, and all the chief military and civil\r\nofficers, accompanying him in procession from the camp to the palace. It\r\nwas a good augury that the townsmen, who lined all the streets, seemed\r\nright glad to have him back again amongst them.\r\n\r\nWhen Gwalior was fairly cleared of rebels, and Scindia reinstated as\r\nMaharajah, two official congratulatory documents were issued, one by Sir\r\nColin Campbell, and the other by Viscount Canning—somewhat differing in\r\ncharacter, but tending to the same end. Sir Colin congratulated Sir Hugh\r\nRose on the successful result of his rapid advance upon Gwalior, and the\r\nrestoration of Scindia. He adverted to these as a happy termination of\r\nRose’s brilliant campaign in Central India—a campaign illustrated by\r\nmany engagements in the open field; by the relief of Saugor; by the\r\ncapture of Ratgurh, Shagurh, and Chendaree; by the memorable siege of\r\nJhansi; by the fall of Calpee; and lastly, by the re-occupation of\r\nGwalior. While thanking Rose and his troops heartily for their glorious\r\ndeeds, Sir Colin did not fail to notice two other generals who had\r\nshared in the hot work of those regions. ‘It must not be forgotten that\r\nthe advance of the Central India Field-force formed part of a large\r\ncombination, and was rendered possible by the movement of Major-general\r\nRoberts, of the Bombay army, into Rajpootana, on the one side; and of\r\nMajor-general Whitlock, of the Madras army, on the other; and by the\r\nsupport they respectively gave to Major-general Sir Hugh Rose as he\r\nmoved onwards in obedience to his instructions.’ Viscount Canning’s\r\nproclamation was more formal, and was intended to meet the eye of\r\nScindia quite as much as those of the gallant troops who had just\r\nreinstated him; it had a political object, to encourage native princes\r\nin a course of fidelity, by shewing that the British government would\r\naid in maintaining them on their thrones, just in proportion to their\r\ngood faith.[177]\r\n\r\nThe British had reconquered every part of the city and neighbourhood of\r\nGwalior, reinstated Scindia on his throne, wrought terrible execution on\r\nthe insurgents, and compelled the main body to seek safety in flight.\r\nBut the questions then arose, in this as in all previous instances—to\r\nwhat quarter had the fugitives retreated, and what amount of mischief\r\nmight they produce during and in consequence of their retreat? It was\r\nsoon ascertained that, while others had chosen a different route, the\r\nmain body had taken the road to Kurowlee. Hence it became an object with\r\nSir Hugh to send off a force in pursuit, in the hope of so completely\r\ncutting up the fugitives as to prevent them from reassembling as an\r\norganised army at any other spot. He invited the co-operation of\r\nBrigadier Showers from another quarter, but depended chiefly on the\r\nexertions of a flying column hastily made up, and placed under the\r\ncommand of Brigadier Napier. On the 20th, within a few hours after the\r\ncapture of Gwalior, Napier set forth; and the next few days were marked\r\nby deeds of gallantry worthy of the name he bore. The column consisted\r\nof a troop of horse-artillery, a troop of the 14th Dragoons, a wing of\r\nthe Hyderabad Contingent cavalry, and three troops of Meade’s\r\nHorse—altogether about six hundred men, with six guns. Starting from the\r\nMoorar cantonment, and passing from the Residency into the open country,\r\nNapier reached Sunnowlie, twenty-four miles from Gwalior, by three\r\no’clock the next morning. On approaching Jowra Alipore, a few hours\r\nafterwards, he descried the enemy in great force, with nearly thirty\r\nguns. Not waiting to consider how small his numbers were compared with\r\nthose opposed to him, Napier resolved to grapple with the enemy. He\r\nmoved his column to the cover of a rising-ground which afforded partial\r\nconcealment; and finding the rebels disposed to move off, he at once\r\nattacked them, with a chivalrous daring worthy of all praise. The column\r\ngalloped off to the right, towards the enemy’s guns, of which nine were\r\ngrouped in and around a small tope of trees. Captain Lightfoot’s\r\nhorse-artillery galloped up to the front, poured in two rounds of shot\r\nat a distance of five hundred yards, limbered up, and dashed off to the\r\nenemy’s guns, even outstripping the supporting cavalry; these guns,\r\nbeing found deserted by the enemy, were at once captured. Of fighting,\r\nthere was really little in amount. The enemy, supposed to be at least\r\nten times as numerous as Napier’s troops, and supplied with formidable\r\nartillery, scarcely made a stand at any point; the necessity for flight\r\nfrom Gwalior had produced a sort of panic, and they made but little\r\nresistance to Napier. They ran off in various directions, but chiefly\r\ntowards the south. Their haste was too great, and the pursuit too\r\nprompt, to enable them to save any of their guns; Napier seized them\r\nall, twenty-five in number, together with numerous stands of arms. Great\r\nas was this achievement, however, considering the relative forces of the\r\nbelligerents, the result was hardly satisfactory in a political point of\r\nview. The hope was not merely to recover Gwalior, but to crush the rebel\r\nforces. Gwalior, it is true, was taken, and artillery in much strength\r\nwas captured; still the main body of the rebels escaped from Rose at\r\nGwalior on the 19th, and the same main body escaped from Napier at Jowra\r\nAlipore on the 21st. Although they had few or no guns, they fled as an\r\narmy and not as a rabble; they retained that sort of military\r\norganisation which might enable them to work mischief elsewhere. Napier,\r\nwishing to prevent this as far as possible, pursued them some distance;\r\nbut as the rebels were wonderfully quick in their movements, they\r\ngradually increased the distance between them and their pursuer, until\r\nat length Napier was thirty miles behind. He then gave up a pursuit\r\nwhich was likely to be fruitless, and returned to Gwalior with the guns\r\nhe had captured. It was afterwards made a subject for question whether\r\nRose should not have placed a greater force of light cavalry at Napier’s\r\ndisposal; but there appears much probability that, when once in flight,\r\nthe rebels would have succeeded in escaping, in this as in all similar\r\ninstances. They had attained great mastery in the art of fleeing.\r\n\r\nWho was the leader of the body of rebels adverted to in the preceding\r\nparagraph was not clearly known; perhaps there was no recognised leader\r\nin the hasty flight. Another body, however, estimated at five or six\r\nthousand in number, followed the orders of the indefatigable Tanteea\r\nTopee; he led them across the Chumbul, past Shree Muttra and Hindoun,\r\nand made towards Jeypoor—the chief city of the principal among the\r\nRajpoot states. So far as could be ascertained, he hoped to obtain the\r\nassistance of insurgent chieftains in that region. He carried with him\r\nthe crown-jewels, and an immense amount of treasure, that had belonged\r\nto Scindia. There was a possibility that Tanteea Topee, by bending a\r\nlittle to the north, would advance to Bhurtpore instead of Jeypoor. The\r\npopulation of Bhurtpore was warlike, and Tanteea Topee could not enter\r\nwithin the earthen walls if opposed; but it was impossible at that time\r\nto rely on any body of Rajpoot troops; and hence the British authorities\r\nwatched with some anxiety the progress of the rebel leader.\r\n\r\nWhen, a few weeks earlier, Sir Hugh Rose had thanked his gallant troops\r\nafter the capture of Calpee, he hoped to be able to retire to Bombay, to\r\nrecruit his shattered health after so much active service in hot\r\nweather. This hope was founded on what appeared to be rational grounds.\r\nThe last stronghold of the enemy had fallen into his hands, with its\r\nguns, ammunition, and stores. Detached posts, it is true, might require\r\nto be carefully guarded; isolated bodies of rebels might need pursuit\r\nand punishment; but there did not appear to be any enterprise of such\r\nmagnitude and importance as to demand the combined services of the\r\ndifferent regiments in the Central India Field-force. Therefore it was\r\nthat, almost immediately after the fall of Calpee, Sir Hugh issued the\r\nglowing address to his troops, already adverted to. His hope of\r\nretirement, however, was for a time frustrated by the defeat of Scindia\r\nby the rebels; but when he had retaken Gwalior, and reinstated the\r\nMaharajah upon the throne, Sir Hugh found himself enabled to fulfil his\r\nwish. Towards the close of June he issued another address to his troops,\r\nin which he said: ‘The major-general commanding being on the point of\r\nresigning the command of the Poonah division of the Bombay army,[178] on\r\naccount of ill health, bids farewell to the Central India Field-force;\r\nand at the same time expresses the pleasure he feels that he commanded\r\nthem when they gained one more laurel at Gwalior. The major-general\r\nwitnessed with satisfaction how the troops and their gallant comrades in\r\narms—the Rajpootana brigade, under General Smith—stormed height after\r\nheight, and gun after gun, under the fire of a numerous field and siege\r\nartillery, taking finally by assault two 18-pounders at Gwalior. Not a\r\nman in these forces enjoyed his natural strength or health; and an\r\nIndian sun, and months of marching and broken rest, had told on the\r\nstrongest; but the moment they were told to take Gwalior for their Queen\r\nand country, they thought of nothing but victory. They gained it,\r\nrestoring England’s true and brave ally to his throne; putting to\r\ncomplete rout the rebel army; killing numbers of them; and taking from\r\nthem in the field, exclusive of those in the fort, fifty-two pieces of\r\nartillery, all their stores and ammunition, and capturing the city and\r\nfort of Gwalior, reckoned the strongest in India. The major-general\r\nthanks sincerely Brigadier-general Napier, C.B., Brigadier Stuart,\r\nC.B.,[179] and Brigadier Smith, commanding brigades in the field, for\r\nthe very efficient and able assistance which they gave him, and to which\r\nhe attributes the success of the day. He bids them and their brave\r\nsoldiers once more a kind farewell. He cannot do so under better aspects\r\nthan those of the victory of Gwalior.’\r\n\r\nEvery one admitted that Sir Hugh Rose had well earned a season of\r\nrepose, after his five months of marching, fighting, besieging, and\r\nconquering. It was on the 12th of January 1858 that he took command of\r\nhis Central India Field-force at Sehore. On the 23d he captured the town\r\nof Ratgurh; on the 28th, defeated the enemy in the field; and on the\r\n30th, captured the fort of Ratgurh. February came, and with it, the\r\nrelief of Saugor and the capture of the fort of Garra Kotah. In March he\r\nforced the pass of Mudenpore; captured a series of strongholds which\r\ngave him command of Bundelcund; took and burned Churkaree; and occupied\r\nTal Behut. In April he defeated the rebel army of Tanteea Topee, near\r\nJhansi; captured that city; and afterwards stormed and captured the fort\r\nbelonging to it. In May he took the fort of Koonch; then fought a severe\r\nbattle near Calpee; and eventually captured the fort at that place.\r\nLastly, in June, as we have just seen, he thoroughly defeated the\r\nGwalior mutineers, captured that important Mahratta city and fort, and\r\nreplaced Scindia on the throne of his ancestors. Second to Havelock—and\r\nit may be doubted whether even this exception should be made—there was\r\nno general engaged in the wars arising out of the mutiny, whose\r\noperations were so numerous and so uniformly successful as those of Sir\r\nHugh Rose. It must at the same time be admitted that Havelock, from\r\nfirst to last, had far smaller forces at his command.\r\n\r\nThe Central India Field-force underwent a total break up after the\r\ncapture of Gwalior. The 95th regiment remained for a time within the\r\nrock-fort. Two of the Queen’s regiments of infantry, and one of the\r\nBombay regiments, with detachments of cavalry and artillery, occupied\r\nthe Moorar cantonment, until further directions could be received. At\r\nJhansi were stationed the 3d Bombay Europeans, the 24th Bombay native\r\ninfantry, with cavalry and artillery. Brigadier Smith’s Rajpootana\r\nbrigade, which had rendered such good service at the siege of Gwalior,\r\nwas distributed into three portions—one remaining at Gwalior, and the\r\nothers going to Seepree and Goonah. All these troops absolutely needed\r\nrest. Whatever exertions were necessary to check the career of the\r\nfugitive rebels, were intrusted to troops from other quarters,\r\nespecially to General Roberts, who held command of all the available\r\ntroops in Rajpootana. Nothing but dire necessity kept British soldiers\r\nin the field under a midsummer sun in the plains of India. As to Sir\r\nHugh Rose, a triumphant reception awaited him at Bombay; all ranks\r\nstrove to render him honour, as one who had brought great renown to the\r\nBombay army.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  Brigadier Stuart, when he heard of the fatal termination of this bold\r\n  and daring achievement, issued the following general order: ‘Brigadier\r\n  Stuart has received with the deepest regret a report of the death of\r\n  Lieutenant Rose, 25th Bombay N. I., who was mortally wounded\r\n  yesterday, on entering the fort of Gwalior, on duty with his men. The\r\n  brigadier feels assured that the whole brigade unite with him in\r\n  deploring the early death of this gallant officer, whose many sterling\r\n  qualities none who knew him could fail to appreciate.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  ‘_Allahabad, June 24, 1858._—The Right Honourable the Governor-general\r\n  has the highest gratification in announcing that the town and fort of\r\n  Gwalior were conquered by Major-general Sir Hugh Rose on the 19th\r\n  instant, after a general action in which the rebels, who had usurped\r\n  the authority of Maharajah Scindia, were totally defeated. On the 20th\r\n  of June, the Maharajah Scindia, attended by the governor-general’s\r\n  agent for Central India, and Sir Hugh Rose, and escorted by British\r\n  troops, was restored to the palace of his ancestors, and was welcomed\r\n  by his subjects with every mark of loyalty and attachment. It was on\r\n  the 1st of June that the rebels, aided by the treachery of some of\r\n  Maharajah Scindia’s troops, seized the capital of his highness’s\r\n  kingdom, and hoped to establish a new government under a pretender in\r\n  his highness’s territory. Eighteen days had not elapsed before they\r\n  were compelled to evacuate the town and fort of Gwalior, and to\r\n  relinquish the authority which they had endeavoured to usurp. The\r\n  promptitude and success with which the strength of the British\r\n  government has been put forth to the restoration of its faithful ally\r\n  to the capital of his territory, and the continued presence of British\r\n  troops at Gwalior to support his highness in the re-establishment of\r\n  his administration, offer to all a convincing proof that the British\r\n  government has the will and the power to befriend those who, like\r\n  Maharajah Scindia, do not shrink from their obligation or hesitate to\r\n  avow their loyalty. The Right Honourable the Governor-general, in\r\n  order to mark his appreciation of the Maharajah Scindia’s friendship,\r\n  and his gratification at the re-establishment of his highness’s\r\n  authority in his ancestral dominions, is pleased to direct that a\r\n  royal salute shall be fired at every principal station in India.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  The Central India Field-force was a kind of offshoot from the Poonah\r\n  division of the Bombay army.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  Brigadier Steuart, who had been with Sir Hugh Rose in the earlier\r\n  scenes of the campaign, retired through ill health before the\r\n  operations at Gwalior began. His brigade passed to the command of\r\n  Napier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DARJEELING—Hill Sanatorium in Sikkim.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n                  STATE OF AFFAIRS AT THE END OF JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the military operations conducted by Sir Hugh Rose and his\r\nheroic companions, bearing relation to the reconquest of Gwalior, and\r\nthe re-establishment of Scindia on his Mahratta throne, were the most\r\ninteresting events in India during the month of June, the other\r\nprovinces also witnessed struggles and contests which equally need to be\r\nchronicled; seeing that they all contributed towards the one great and\r\nearnestly desired result—the pacification of the Anglo-Indian empire.\r\nTerrible, it is true, were the labours of the gallant men who fought and\r\nmarched against the rebels under the scorching heat of an Indian\r\nsun—heat which was that year excessive, even for India itself; but such\r\nlabours were necessary, and were borne with a degree of cheerfulness\r\nwhich commands our admiration for the sterling qualities of British\r\ntroops. Sir Colin Campbell yearned to place his brave men under shade\r\nand at rest, until such time as the rains should have cooled down the\r\nsummer’s fiery temperature; he did so to such an extent as was\r\npracticable; but this extent was not great. June, as we shall see, was a\r\nmonth of much fighting in the regions adjacent to the Ganges, the Jumna,\r\nthe Chumbul, and the Sone.\r\n\r\nCalcutta saw nothing of the governor-general during many months. He took\r\nup his abode at Allahabad; filling the offices not only of\r\ngovernor-general of the whole of India, but special governor of some of\r\nthose disturbed regions which had at one time been called the Northwest\r\nProvinces, and at another the Central Provinces. This he had done in\r\norder that he might be in more easy communication with the\r\ncommander-in-chief, and in more prompt receipt of intelligence from the\r\nvarious stations and camps in Oude, Behar, Rohilcund, the Doab,\r\nBundelcund, Central India, and Rajpootana. How the weight of\r\nresponsibility pressed on one who had to govern at such a time and in\r\nsuch a climate, few were aware; he worked on, early and late, thinking\r\nonly how best he could act as the Queen’s viceroy for India. Calcutta\r\nhad not much more to do with Lord Canning’s proceedings at that period,\r\nthan the other presidential cities; for he had his staff of government\r\nemployés with him at Allahabad.\r\n\r\nBengal was nearly at peace in June; few troubles disturbed the equable\r\nflow of commerce and industry. One slight transaction of an opposite\r\nkind may, however, be briefly noticed. A body of sailors sent from\r\nCalcutta had an opportunity of bringing some rebels to an account, and\r\ndefeating them in the wonted style. A naval brigade, under Captain\r\nMoore, was stationed in the district of Singbhoom, southwest of\r\nCalcutta, near the frontier between the Bengal and Madras presidencies.\r\nThe district comprised the four petty states of Singbhoom, Colehan,\r\nSurakella, and Khursawa, each of which had its rajah or chieftain. The\r\nonly town of any note in the district was Chyebassa; and here was the\r\nCompany’s civil station. The Rajah of Singbhoom, at the period now under\r\nnotice, was endeavouring, like many other rajahs, to strengthen himself\r\nby throwing off British supremacy. It happened, on the 9th of the month,\r\nwhen the brigade was encamped at Chuckerderpore, but when some of the\r\nofficers had gone to Chyebassa, that the camp was suddenly attacked by\r\nthe rajah’s motley retinue of Koles, a half-savage tribe armed with\r\nbattle-axes, bows and arrows, spears, and matchlocks. They invested the\r\ncamp on all sides, and made a very fierce attack. The seamen poured in a\r\nfew shells among them, which threw them into much disorder. After this a\r\nparty of thirty went out, and committed much havoc among them in a\r\nhand-to-hand contest. Captain Moncrieff then rode in from Chyebassa,\r\nwith a cavalry escort, and at once engaged with the rebels. After five\r\nhours’ skirmishing, the mid-day sun exhausted alike Europeans and Koles;\r\nand nothing further occurred till the morning of the 10th. The rebels\r\nwere so numerous that the brigade could only attack them on one side at\r\nonce; and thus it was not until the arrival of a hundred Ramgurh troops\r\nand fifty Sikhs, at noon on the 11th, that the rajah and his Koles gave\r\nway—retreating to the jungles of Porahaut.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Bengal there were petty chieftains of like\r\ncharacter, who were quite willing to set up as kings on their own\r\naccount—regardless of treaties existing between them and the Company,\r\nand actuated solely by the temptations afforded during a period of\r\ndisorder. But the conditions were not favourable to them. The meek and\r\ncowardly Bengalees did not imitate the Hindustanis of the Doab and\r\nOude; the hill-tribes were too few in number to be formidable; and the\r\nsteady arrival of British troops at Calcutta strengthened the hands of\r\nthe authorities in all the surrounding regions. Arrangements were\r\ngradually made for increasing the number of European troops at\r\nCalcutta, Dacca, Barrackpore, Berhampore, Hazarebagh, Jessore, and one\r\nor two other stations—so as to place the whole of Bengal more\r\nimmediately under the eye of the military authorities.\r\n\r\nThese defensive measures extended as far north as Darjeeling—one of\r\nthose healthy and temperate Hill-stations which have so often been\r\nadverted to in former chapters as important _sanitaria_ for the English\r\nin India. Simla, Landour, Kussowlie, Subathoo, Mussouree, Dugshai,\r\nAlmora, and Nynee Tal, are all of this character; and to these may be\r\nadded Darjeeling. A patch of hill-country, containing about three\r\nhundred square miles, and formerly belonging to the Rajah of Sikim, was\r\nobtained by the Company a few years ago, and Darjeeling established near\r\nits centre. The Himalayas bound it on the north, Nepaul on the west,\r\nBhotan on the east, and two of the Bengal districts on the south. The\r\nhills and valleys are beautiful, and the climate healthy. Darjeeling is\r\nmore particularly mentioned in this place, because, about the date to\r\nwhich this chapter refers, public attention was called to a project for\r\nestablishing a settlement called Hope Town, on the slopes of a hill near\r\nDarjeeling. This settlement was to be for independent emigrants,\r\ncolonists, or settlers, from the plains, or even from Europe; who, it\r\nwas hoped, might be tempted to that region by a fertile soil and a\r\nmagnificent climate, and thus gradually introduce English farming at the\r\nbase of the Himalayas. A company or society purchased or leased about\r\nfourteen thousand acres of hill-land, in Darjeeling district, but not in\r\nimmediate contiguity to Darjeeling town. It was announced that the\r\nlocality contained clay for bricks, rubble for masonry, lime for mortar,\r\ntimber for carpentry and for fuel, and all the essential requisites for\r\nbuilding; water was abundant, from the mountain streams and springs;\r\nwhile peaceful natives in the neighbouring plains would be eager to\r\nobtain employment as artisans and labourers. The elevation of the land,\r\nvarying from three to six thousand feet, offered much facility of\r\nchoice. As the government had commenced a road from Darjeeling and Hope\r\nTown to Caragola Ghât on the Ganges, there would be good markets for\r\nhill produce in many parts of Bengal—perhaps in Calcutta itself. When\r\nthe project of this Hope Town settlement was first formed in 1856, it\r\nwas intended that the projectors should grant leases of small plots for\r\nfarms or dwellings, for a fixed number of years, and at a rental so\r\nsmall as to attract settlers; while at the same time this rental should\r\nso far exceed what the speculators paid to the government as to enable\r\nthem to construct a road, and build a school-room, church, library, and\r\nother component elements for a town. This, it may be observed, was only\r\none among several colonising projects brought before public notice in\r\nIndia. The land containing many magnificent tracts, and the climate\r\npresenting many varieties of temperature, it has often been urged that\r\nthat noble country presents advantages for settlement which ought no\r\nlonger to be overlooked. So long as the East India Company’s power\r\nexisted, any colonising schemes would necessarily prove almost abortive;\r\nbut now that British India owns no other ruler than the sovereign of\r\nEngland, there may in future years be an opening offered for the\r\nthorough examination and testing of this important question, that its\r\nmerits and demerits may be fairly compared. Some of the advocates of\r\ncolonisation have painted imaginary pictures so glowing as to represent\r\nIndia as the true Dorado or Golden Land of the widely spreading British\r\nempire; some of the opponents of colonisation, on the other hand, have\r\nasserted that British farmers could not live in India if they would, and\r\nwould not if they could:—the future will strike out a practicable mean\r\nbetween these two extremes.\r\n\r\nThe controversy concerning Indian heat, in reference to the wants and\r\nconstitutions of English settlers, bore very closely on the subject of\r\ncolonisation, and on the difference between the hilly districts and the\r\nplains. In military matters, however, and in reference to the struggle\r\nactually going on, all admitted that the summer of 1858 had been more\r\nthan usually fierce in its heat. A correspondent of one of the journals\r\nsaid: ‘As if to try the endurance of Englishmen to the utmost, the\r\nseason has been such as has not been known since 1833. Those who know\r\nBengal will understand it when I say that on the 15th inst. one\r\nclergyman in Calcutta buried forty-eight Englishmen, chiefly sailors. In\r\none ship the captain, chief-mate, and twenty-six men, had all apoplexy\r\nat once. Nine men from Fort-William were buried one morning from the\r\nsame cause. Her Majesty’s 19th, at Barrackpore, who are nearly all under\r\ncover, and who are most carefully looked after, have 200 men unfit for\r\nduty from immense boils. All over the country paragraph after paragraph\r\nannounces the deaths of so many men at such a place from apoplexy.’ The\r\nsame writer mentions the case of a colonel who, just arrived with his\r\nregiment at Calcutta, and, unfamiliar with an Indian climate, marched\r\noff his men _with their stocks on_: in an hour afterwards he and his\r\ninstructor in rifle-practice were both dead from apoplexy.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting Calcutta, it may be well to mention that the month of\r\nJune was marked by an honourable and energetic movement for recording\r\nthe services and cherishing the memory of Mr Venables, one of those\r\ncivil servants of the Company who displayed an undaunted spirit, and\r\nconsiderable military talent, in times of great trial. It will be\r\nremembered that, after many months of active service, both civil and\r\nmilitary, Mr Venables was wounded at Azimghur on the 15th of April;[180]\r\nfrom the effects of this wound he soon afterwards sank—dying as he had\r\nlived, a frank and gallant man. A committee was formed in Calcutta to\r\nfound, by individual subscriptions, some sort of memorial worthy of the\r\nman. Viscount Canning took an early opportunity of joining in this\r\nmanifestation; and in a letter to the committee he spoke of Mr Venables\r\nin the following terms: ‘It will be a satisfaction to me to join in this\r\ngood work, not only on account of the admiration which I feel for the\r\nhigh qualities which Mr Venables devoted to the public service, his\r\nintrepidity in the field, his energy and calm temper in upholding the\r\ncivil authority, and his thoroughly just appreciation of the people and\r\ncircumstances with which he had to deal; but also, and especially, on\r\naccount of circumstances attending the last service which Mr Venables\r\nrendered to his country. After the capture of Lucknow, where he was\r\nattached to Brigadier General Franks’ column, Mr Venables came to\r\nAllahabad. He was broken in health and spirits, anxious for rest, and\r\nlooking forward eagerly to his return to England, for which his\r\npreparations were made. At that time the appearance of affairs near\r\nAzimghur was threatening; and I asked Mr Venables to forego his\r\ndeparture from India, and return to that district, with which he was\r\nintimately acquainted—there to assist in preserving order until danger\r\nshould have passed away. He at once consented cheerfully; and that\r\nconsent cost him his life. I am certain that the Court of Directors, who\r\nare fully informed of all particulars of Mr Venables’s great services\r\nand untimely death, will be eager to mark, in such manner as shall seem\r\nbest to them, their appreciation of the character of this brave,\r\nself-denying English gentleman; and I am truly glad to have an\r\nopportunity of joining with his fellow-countrymen in India in testifying\r\nthe sincere respect which I feel for his memory.’\r\n\r\nBeyond the limits of Bengal, one of the many interesting questions that\r\npressed upon public attention bore relation to Nepaul and Jung Bahadoor.\r\nThat gay, gorgeous, shrewd, and unscrupulous chieftain had gone back to\r\nhis own country somewhat dissatisfied with his share in the Oude\r\ncampaign, or with the advantages accruing from it. Queen Victoria had\r\nmade him a Grand Cross of the Bath—a gentle knight ‘sans peur et sans\r\nreproche,’ according to the original meaning of that honourable\r\ndistinction; but there were those who believed he would have better\r\nwelcomed some more substantial recognition of his services, such as a\r\nfair slice out of the territory of Oude. Some doubted his fidelity to\r\nthe British cause, and among these were several of the leaders among the\r\nrebels. There came to light a most remarkable correspondence, shewing in\r\nwhat way Jung Bahadoor was tempted to swerve from his allegiance, and in\r\nwhat way he resisted the temptation. Several letters were made public—by\r\nwhat agency does not clearly appear—addressed by the Begum of Oude and\r\nher adherents to the Nepaulese chieftain. About the period to which this\r\nchapter relates, the rebel party at Lucknow disseminated rumours to the\r\neffect that Jung Bahadoor, after his return to Nepaul, had been written\r\nto by the Begum, and that he had undertaken to throw in his lot with the\r\n‘patriots’ of Oude. That the attempt was made is clear enough; but the\r\nnature of the response, so far as the published correspondence revealed\r\nit, certainly does not seem to implicate him. One letter, apparently\r\nwritten about the end of May, was signed by Mahomed Surfraz Ali, who\r\ndesignated himself ambassador of the King of Oude. It began by\r\nexpressing astonishment that Nepaul should have aided the infidel\r\nBritish, after having in former days been in friendly alliance with\r\nOude. ‘The chiefs of every tribe,’ it said, ‘should fight for their\r\nreligion as long as they live.’ Considering that the Oude royal family\r\nwere Mohammedans, and the Nepaulese Hindoos, the ambassador had some\r\ndifficulty in so framing his letter as to prove that Jung Bahadoor ought\r\nto aid them rather than the English; and indeed his logic was somewhat\r\nlame. The ambassador stated that he was then writing at Toolseepore,\r\nwhither he had been sent by the powerful Moulvie Ahmedoolah Shah, on the\r\npart of the King of Oude, to act as accredited agent or ambassador with\r\nthe Nepaul authorities. He proceeded to state that seven letters, in the\r\nPersian language, had been written by Mahomed Khan Bahadoor, viceroy of\r\nOude, to as many of the chief personages in Oude—among others, to Jung\r\nBahadoor himself; and that two letters, in the Hindee language, had been\r\nwritten under the seal of the King of Oude, one addressed to the King of\r\nNepaul, and one to Jung Bahadoor. Mahomed Surfraz Ali added: ‘Neither I\r\nnor the servants of our government are acquainted with your titles, or\r\nthose of your authorities, so we cannot address you properly. I am in\r\nhopes that you will send me word how we should address you; and pray\r\nforgive any mistakes or omissions in this letter.’ He begged the favour\r\nof a letter, with the chieftain’s seal attached, for presentation to the\r\ncourt of Oude. The letters purporting to be written by or for ‘Ramzan\r\nAli Khan Mirza Birjiz Kudr Bahadoor,’ King of Oude, assumed quite a\r\nregal style, and almost claimed the alliance of the Nepaul Maharajah as\r\na right. The royal letter-writer made short work of the causes of the\r\nmutiny: ‘The British some time ago attempted to interfere with the faith\r\nof both the Hindoos and the Mohammedans, by preparing cartridges with\r\ncows’ grease for the Hindoos, and that of pigs’ for the Mohammedans, and\r\nordering them to bite them with their teeth. The sepoys refused, and\r\nwere ordered by the British to be blown away from guns on the\r\nparade-ground. This is the cause of the war breaking out, and probably\r\nyou are acquainted with it. But I am ignorant as to how they managed to\r\nget your troops, which they brought down here, and began to commit every\r\nsort of violence, and to pull down temples, mosques, imaumbarahs, and\r\nsacred places. You are well aware of the treachery of the British; and\r\nit is proper you should preserve the standard of religion, and make the\r\ntree of friendship between you and me fresh.’ The real correspondents,\r\nin this exchange of letters, were the Begum of Oude and Jung Bahadoor.\r\nThe astute chieftain wrote a reply, couched in such terms as to suggest\r\na probability that the British resident at Khatmandoo was at his elbow.\r\nOne of his high-flown paragraphs ran thus: ‘Since the star of faith and\r\nintegrity, sincerity in words as well as in acts, and wisdom and\r\ncomprehension, of the British, are shining as bright as the sun in every\r\nquarter of the globe, be assured that my government will never disunite\r\nitself from the friendship of the exalted British government, or be\r\ninstigated to join with any monarch against it, be he as high as heaven.\r\nWhat grounds can we have for connecting ourselves with the Hindoos and\r\nMohammedans of Hindostan?’ And he ended with this bit of advice: ‘As you\r\nhave sent me a friendly letter, let me persuade you, that if any person,\r\nHindoo or Mohammedan, who has not murdered a British lady or child, goes\r\nimmediately to Mr Montgomery, the chief-commissioner of Lucknow, and\r\nsurrenders his arms, and makes submission, he will be permitted to\r\nretain his honour, and his crime will be pardoned. If you still be\r\ninclined to make war on the British, no rajah or king in the world will\r\ngive you an asylum; and death will be the end of it.’ This reply,\r\nsupposing it to be a spontaneous expression of the real sentiments of\r\nJung Bahadoor, would have possessed very high value; but a large\r\ndeduction must probably be made both from the spontaneity and the\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be well to notice that the royal house of Oude was at\r\ndiscord with itself in those days, and that the king’s name was used ‘as\r\na tower of strength’ by intriguers who cared little for rightful\r\nownership. The real king—that is, the ex-king—was at Calcutta, a\r\nprisoner and a half-idiot, with depravity enough to enjoy plots, but not\r\nbrains to execute them. The legitimate son and heir, so to speak, was in\r\nEurope, where he had lately buried his grandmother the dowager-queen of\r\nOude, and was spending his father’s money at a very rapid rate. The\r\nregal personages at Lucknow were the Begum and her son. The Begum was\r\none of the king’s many ladies; and her son was a weak-headed youth of\r\nthirteen years old—‘illegitimate,’ according to the assertions of the\r\n‘legitimate’ son at that time in Europe. The exiled king and his two\r\nsons were, in reference to these machinations at Lucknow, mere tools or\r\npretences; the real mover was the clever and ambitious Begum. In Nepaul,\r\nlikewise, the real power was possessed, not by the maharajah, or\r\nsovereign, but by his all-controlling, king-making subject, Jung\r\nBahadoor.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Oudian intriguers during the month of June will\r\npresently be noticed in other ways; but it will be convenient first to\r\nattend to the affairs of Behar.\r\n\r\nIn former chapters it has been narrated, in sufficient fulness for the\r\npurpose in view, how the western provinces of Behar were troubled by the\r\nJugdispore and Dinapoor rebels, and with how many difficulties Sir\r\nEdward Lugard had to contend in bringing his ‘Azimghur Field-force’ to\r\nbear against them. The month of June offered no exception to this state\r\nof things. Most harassing indeed were the labours which they brought\r\nupon him, testing his patience and perseverance more, perhaps, than his\r\nmilitary skill. Notwithstanding the numerous defeats which they had\r\nsuffered, these mutinied sepoys and armed budmashes were continually\r\nmoving from place to place—giving evidence of their presence by murder,\r\nplunder, and burning. The jungles around Jugdispore afforded many\r\nfacilities for hiding and secret flight. One of the many defeats\r\ninflicted by Sir Edward occurred on the 27th of May. Immediately\r\nafterwards a body of several hundreds of those insurgents issued from\r\nthe eastern portion of the jungle, and shewed themselves in their true\r\ncharacter as marauders bent on mischief, rather than as soldiers\r\nfighting for a definite cause. On the 30th they burned an indigo factory\r\nat Twining Gunge, a place near Dumoran; whilst on the same day another\r\nbody advanced to the village of Rajpore, within eight miles of Buxar,\r\nand murdered two natives in government service. From thence they\r\nwandered, during the next four or five days, among the neighbouring\r\nvillages, working mischief at every step. In anything like a military\r\nsense, these bands of marauders were contemptible; but so numerous were\r\nthe unemployed and half-fed ruffians in the disturbed districts, that\r\nthere were always materials at hand for swelling the numbers of these\r\nfreebooting insurgents. Lugard was compelled to keep his troops moving\r\nabout, between Arrah and Buxar; while the authorities at Ghazeepore and\r\nBenares were on the alert to check any advance of the rebels towards\r\nthose cities. On the 2d of June he divided his force into two wings, and\r\nestablished camps at Keshwa and Dulleepore, with a line of posts across\r\nthe jungle. On the next day he cut a broad road through the jungle to\r\nconnect the two camps. Having thus completely hemmed a considerable body\r\nof the rebels within the southern end of the jungle, he attacked them\r\nwith his whole force on the 4th, with a very successful result—so far as\r\nregarded the maintenance of military superiority. The rebels attempted\r\nfor a time to make a stand; but the 10th and 84th foot, charging with\r\nthe bayonet, defeated them with great slaughter. Here again, however,\r\nwas the old story repeated; his hope of capturing the main body of\r\nrebels was frustrated; they broke up into small bands, and fled in\r\nvarious directions.\r\n\r\nInstead of describing numerous petty contests that occurred during the\r\nmonth, it may be well to illustrate the peculiar characteristics of the\r\nstruggle by one particular instance, to shew that the British troops in\r\nBehar had more certainty of hard work than chance of glory. During the\r\nfirst week in June, Sir Edward intrusted to Brigadier Douglas the duty\r\nof intercepting a body of rebels from the Jugdispore district towards\r\nBuxar—a difficult duty, on account of the ingenuity of the rebels in\r\neluding pursuit. Douglas started on the 7th, taking with him H.M. 84th\r\nfoot, a troop of the 4th Madras cavalry, three troops of the military\r\ntrain, and three guns of the royal horse-artillery. On that and the two\r\nfollowing days he marched to Buxar, by way of Shahpoor and Saumgunje.\r\nBetween the 10th and the 13th he was busily engaged in the almost\r\nhopeless task of catching the rebels who were known to be marching and\r\nmarauding not far distant. Now he would descry a few hundred of them in\r\na tope of trees, and send his horse-artillery to disperse them with\r\ngrape-shot; now he would cross the little river Surronuddee, or the\r\nKurrumnassa, or hasten to the Sheapoor Ghât, in the hope of cutting off\r\nfugitives; now he would march through or near the villages of Ghamur,\r\nChawsa, or Barra, in search either of rebels or of intelligence. His\r\nsuccess by no means repaid him for his harassing exertions; he could\r\nseldom rely on information obtained concerning the movements of the\r\nrebels, and still more seldom could he catch the rebels themselves. In\r\nhis dispatch relating to these operations, the brigadier said: ‘Three\r\nmen of the royal horse-artillery died during the night from the effects\r\nof the sun, and one man of the 84th.... The heat during the operations\r\nwas intense, and the troops suffered much, particularly the 84th\r\nregiment, who have now been thirteen months in the field. I consider\r\nthis regiment at present to be quite unfit for active service; the men\r\nhave no positive disease, but they are so exhausted that they can\r\nneither eat nor sleep.’ If they could have encountered the enemy, and\r\nthoroughly vanquished them in a regular battle, the overworked and\r\nheat-worn soldiers would have borne this and more than this cheerfully;\r\nbut they had to deal with rebels who eluded their search in an\r\nextraordinary way. Sir Edward Lugard, in a dispatch written on the 14th,\r\ndated from his camp at Narainpoor, near Jugdispore, adverted to this\r\nsubject in the following terms: ‘To shew the rapidity and secrecy with\r\nwhich the rebels conduct their movements, I beg to state, that in order\r\nto guard against the return of any party from the west towards the\r\njungles, without my getting timely intelligence, so that I might\r\nintercept them, I posted at Roop-Saugor—a village thirteen miles to my\r\nsouthwest, on the track taken by the rebels in their flight—Captain\r\nRattray, with his Sikh battalion. He again threw forward scouts some\r\nmiles in the same direction, and constantly had parties patrolling in\r\nthe different villages. But in spite of every precaution, the rebel\r\nforce were at Medneepore, within four miles of him, before he could\r\ncommunicate with me, and passed on towards the jungle the same night.\r\nEvery endeavour to obtain information from the people of the district\r\nhas proved vain; scarcely ever has any intelligence been given to us,\r\nuntil the time has passed when advantage could be taken of it.’\r\n\r\nIn reference to these Jugdispore rebels, it has been remarked that they\r\nwere neither Sikhs from the west, nor Poorbeahs from the east; but\r\nchiefly Bhojpoories of the Shahabad district, most of them born on Koer\r\nSingh’s own estates. Moreover, causes have been assigned for thinking\r\nthat these, as well as other rebels, adhered most to those leaders who\r\ncould treat them best, whether in pay or plunder, without much reference\r\nto their military abilities. ‘The extraordinary variations in the\r\nnumbers of the insurgents may be partly accounted for by variations in\r\nthe readiness of pay. Koer Singh, when he left Oude, had barely five\r\nhundred men in his train. As he marched, every straggling sepoy, every\r\nembarrassed scoundrel with a sword, enlisted in his service. By the time\r\nhe reached Azimghur he had two thousand five hundred followers; most,\r\nbut not all, well armed. The flight across the river dispersed them once\r\nmore; and it was not till the check sustained by H.M. 35th that they\r\nthronged to him again. Apparently the leaders are well aware of the\r\nadvantage this peculiarity affords. Thus, after their defeat by Sir E.\r\nLugard, the great bulk of the Behar insurgents vanished; the work was\r\napparently complete, and the military ends of the campaign to all\r\nappearance accomplished. The leaders, however, remained in the jungle,\r\nand in five days their followers were round them again; they had glided\r\nback in twos and threes, by paths on which no European would be met.’\r\n\r\nAfter many weeks of fatiguing duty in this region, Sir Edward Lugard,\r\nworn with heat and sickness, resigned the command about the end of June;\r\nhanding over to Colonel Douglas the office of chasing the Jugdispore\r\nrebels from place to place. Nor was it in that particular locality alone\r\nthat this duty had to be fulfilled. Ummer Singh, equalling his deceased\r\nbrother in activity, was no sooner defeated in one place than he made\r\nhis appearance in another, carrying discord into villages where his\r\npresence was as little desired by natives as by Europeans. While Colonel\r\nDouglas was on his way towards the scene of his new command, news\r\nreached him that the English at Gayah had been driven into intrenchments\r\nby a party of a hundred and fifty rebel prisoners, who had been set at\r\nliberty by the native police employed to watch them, and were speedily\r\njoined by the jail convicts; all—prisoners, police, and convicts—became\r\nsuddenly ‘patriots,’ and shewed their patriotism by threatening all the\r\nofficials at the station. This is believed to have been done by some\r\nconnivance with Ummer Singh. The Europeans at Gayah were thrown into a\r\ngreat ferment by this visitation; the few troops present were withdrawn\r\ninto the intrenchment, as were likewise the civilians, ladies, and\r\nchildren. No immediate attack followed; but the incident furnished one\r\namong many proofs that the native police were, in most of the Bengal and\r\nHindostan provinces, a source of more danger than protection to the\r\nBritish—except the Sikh police, who almost uniformly behaved well.\r\n\r\nThe transactions in Oude, during the month of June, told of rebels\r\ndefeated but not disbanded, weakened but not captured. There were many\r\nleaders, and these required to be narrowly watched.\r\n\r\nOne of the first cares of the authorities was to place the important\r\ncity of Lucknow in such a state of defence as to render it safe from\r\nattacks within and without. Various military works were planned by\r\nColonel Napier, and were executed by Major Crommelin after Napier’s\r\ndeparture. From the vast extent of Lucknow, and the absence of any very\r\nprominent features of the ground, it was a difficult city to defend\r\nexcept by a large body of troops. The point which gave the nearest\r\napproach to a command over the city was the old fort or Muchee Bhowan,\r\nnear which was the great Emanbarra, capable of sheltering a large number\r\nof troops. It was decided to select several spots as military posts, to\r\nclear the ground round those spots, and to open streets or roads of\r\ncommunication from post to post. The Muchee Bhowan was selected as the\r\nchief of these posts; a second was near the iron bridge leading over the\r\nGoomtee to the Fyzabad road; a third was on the site of the Residency,\r\nnow a heap of ruins; a fourth was at the Moosa Bagh. All suburbs and\r\nbuildings lying on the banks of the river, likely to intercept the free\r\nmarch of troops from the Muchee Bhowan to the Moosa Bagh, were ordered\r\nto be swept away. Large masses of houses were also removed, to form good\r\nmilitary roads from the Muchee Bhowan to the Char Bagh, the Moosa Bagh,\r\nthe stone bridge, the iron bridge, and the old cantonment. The vast\r\nrange of palaces, such as the Fureed Buksh, the Chuttur Munzil, the\r\nKaiser Bagh, &c., were converted temporarily into barracks, and all the\r\nstreets and buildings near them either pulled down or thrown open. The\r\nMartinière, the Dil Koosha, and Banks’s house, were formed into military\r\nposts on the eastern side of the city. The two extremes of these posts,\r\nfrom northwest to southeast, were not far short of seven miles asunder;\r\nthey would require a considerable number of troops for their occupancy\r\nand defence; but under any circumstances such would be required in the\r\ngreat capital of Oude for a long period to come.\r\n\r\nThe Alum Bagh continued to be maintained, as an important and useful\r\nstation on the road from Lucknow to Cawnpore. It was destined to live in\r\nhistory as a place which Sir James Outram had defended for nearly four\r\nmonths against armed forces estimated at little short of a hundred\r\nthousand men. It was not originally a fort, only a palace in the midst\r\nof a walled garden; but it presented facilities for being made into\r\nuseful shelter for troops. Another place, the bridge of Bunnee, over the\r\nriver Sye, was also carefully maintained as an important military post\r\nbetween Lucknow and Cawnpore. During the latter part of May, the English\r\ntroops employed with Sir Hope Grant in various expeditions against the\r\nenemy suffered severely from the heat; and it was found necessary to\r\ngive the 38th regiment a temporary sojourn in the Emanbarra at Lucknow,\r\nsupplying their place by the 53d. On the 3d of June the Bunnee force\r\nmoved out, to disperse a body of rebels who had posted themselves near\r\nPooroa. There was another duty of a singular kind intrusted to these\r\ntroops. The Rajah of Kupoorthully, a Sikh chieftain, who had rendered\r\nvaluable services to the government in time of need, received as a\r\nreward an extensive jaghire or domain in Oude. In order that he might\r\ndefend both himself and British interests in that domain, he was\r\nassisted in intrenching himself, and was supplied with guns, mortars,\r\nand ammunition; this was irrespective of his own force of four thousand\r\nSikh troops.\r\n\r\nShortly after the opening of the month, rumours reached the authorities\r\nat Lucknow that a body of rebels, estimated at seventeen or eighteen\r\nthousand, had crossed the Gogra, and taken up a position at Ramnuggur\r\nDhumaree, under the orders of Gorhuccus Singh. The correctness of this\r\nreport was not certain—nor of others that Madhoo Singh was at the head\r\nof five thousand rebels at Goosaengunje, Benee Madhoo with a small\r\nnumber in the Poorwah district, and Dunkha Shah with a larger force near\r\nChinhut. Still, though these numbers were probably exaggerated by\r\nalarmists, it was not considered prudent to leave the northeast region\r\nof Oude unprotected. Accordingly, a movable column was organised, to\r\nproceed towards Fyzabad.\r\n\r\nSir Hope Grant, intrusted at that time with the conduct of military\r\naffairs in Oude, himself conducted an expedition towards the districts\r\njust adverted to. A little before midnight on the 12th of June, acting\r\non information which had reached him, he marched from Lucknow to\r\nChinhut, and thence towards Nawabgunge, on the Fyzabad road. His force\r\nconsisted of the 2d and 3d battalions of the Rifle Brigade, the 5th\r\nPunjaub Rifles, a detachment of Engineers and Sappers, the 7th Hussars,\r\ntwo squadrons of the 2d Dragoon Guards, Hodson’s Horse, a squadron of\r\nthe first Sikh cavalry, a troop of mounted police, a troop of\r\nhorse-artillery, and two light field-batteries. Leaving a garrison\r\ncolumn at Chinhut, under Colonel Purnell, and intrusting the same\r\nofficer with the temporary charge of the baggage and supplies belonging\r\nto the column, Sir Hope resumed his march during the night towards\r\nNawabgunge, where sixteen thousand rebels had assembled, with several\r\nguns. By daylight on the following morning he crossed the Beti Nuddee at\r\nQuadrigunje, by means of a ford. He had purposely adopted this route\r\ninstead of advancing to the bridge on the Fyzabad road; in order that,\r\nafter crossing the nullah, he might get between the enemy and a large\r\njungle. As a strong force of rebels defended the ford, a sharp\r\nartillery-fire, kept up by Mackinnon’s horse-artillery and Johnson’s\r\nbattery, was necessary to effect this passage. Having surmounted this\r\nobstacle, Sir Hope, approaching nearer to Nawabgunge, got into the\r\njungle district. Here the rebels made an attempt to surround him on all\r\nsides, and pick off his men by repeated volleys of musketry. The general\r\nspeedily changed the aspect of affairs. He sent a troop of\r\nhorse-artillery to the front; Johnson’s battery and two squadrons of\r\nhorse were sent to defend the left; while a larger body confronted the\r\nrebels on the right—where the enemy apparently expected to find and to\r\ncapture Sir Hope’s baggage. The struggle was very fierce, and the\r\nslaughter of the rebels considerable; the enemy, fanatical as well as\r\nnumerous, gave exercise for all Grant’s boldness and sagacity in\r\ncontending with them. The victory was complete—and yet it was\r\nindefinite; for the rebels, as usual, escaped, to renew their mischief\r\nat some other time and place. Nearly six hundred of their number were\r\nslain; the wounded were much more numerous. Hope Grant’s list of killed\r\nand wounded numbered about a hundred. Many of the rebels were Ghazees or\r\nMohammedan fanatics, far more difficult to deal with than the mutinied\r\nsepoys. Adverting to some of the operations on the right flank, Grant\r\nsaid in his dispatch: ‘On arriving at this point, I found that a large\r\nnumber of Ghazees, with two guns, had come out on the open plain, and\r\nattacked Hodson’s Horse. I immediately ordered up the other four guns\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant Percival, and two squadrons of the 7th\r\nHussars under Major Sir W. Russell, and opened grape upon them within\r\nthree or four hundred yards with terrible effect. But the fanatics made\r\nthe most determined resistance; and two men in the midst of a shower of\r\ngrape brought forward two green standards, which they planted in the\r\nground beside their guns, and rallied their men. Captain Atherley’s two\r\ncompanies of the 3d battalion Rifle Brigade at this moment advanced to\r\nthe attack, which obliged the rebels to move off. The cavalry then got\r\nbetween them and the guns; and the 7th Hussars, led gallantly by Sir W.\r\nRussell, supported by Hodson’s Horse under Major Daly, swept through\r\nthem—killing every man.’ Whatever may have been the causes, proximate or\r\nremote, of the mutiny, it is quite evident that such Mussulman fanatics\r\nas these, with their green flag of rebellion and their cries of ‘Deen!\r\ndeen!’ had been worked up, or had worked themselves up, to something\r\nlike a sincere belief that they were fighting for their religion.\r\n\r\nThe chief body of rebels, as has just been stated, succeeded in escaping\r\nfrom Nawabgunge after the battle. They fled chiefly to Ramnuggur and\r\nMahadeo on the banks of the Gogra, and to Bhitowlie at the junction of\r\nthat river with the Chowka—with the apparent and probable intention of\r\nthrowing up earthworks for the defence of those positions.\r\n\r\nJust about the time when Sir Hope Grant defeated these Nawabgunge\r\nrebels—supposed to have been headed by the Begum of Oude and her\r\nparamour Mummoo Khan—the career of the energetic Moulvie was suddenly\r\ncut short at another. This remarkable man, Moulvie Ahmedullah Shah, died\r\nas he had long lived, struggling against the Feringhees and all who\r\nsupported them. On the 15th of June, after having been driven from place\r\nto place by the various British columns and detachments, he arrived from\r\nMohumdee at Powayne, a town about sixteen miles northeast of\r\nShahjehanpoor. He had with him a considerable body of horse, and some\r\nguns. The Rajah of Powayne, named Juggernath Singh, having incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the Moulvie by sheltering two native servants of the\r\nCompany, was attacked by him. Juggernath Singh, and his two brothers\r\nBuldeo Singh and Komul Singh, went out to confront the Moulvie as best\r\nthey could. A skirmish ensued, which lasted three hours. The most\r\nnotable result was the death of the Moulvie; he received a shot, and\r\nfell; his head was at once severed; and the Rajah sent the head and\r\ntrunk to Shahjehanpoor, to be delivered to Mr Gilbert Money, the\r\ncommissioner. Glad as the British may have been to get rid of a\r\nformidable enemy, it is doubtful whether Mr Money received the bleeding\r\ngift with much gratification. The Rajah of Powayne, however, had long\r\nbeen an object of suspicion, on account of his unfeeling conduct towards\r\nsome of the poor fugitives in the early days of the Revolt; and as the\r\nBritish cause was now obviously the winning cause, he was anxious, by\r\nhis alacrity in dealing with the dead body of the Moulvie, to win favour\r\nwith the authorities. A very large reward had been offered by the\r\ngovernment to whoever could capture the Moulvie; and although some doubt\r\nwas expressed whether this was intended to apply as well to the bleeding\r\ncorpse as to the living man, the reward was paid to the Powayne\r\nchieftain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Principal Street in Lucknow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was unquestionably a great gain to the British to know that the\r\nMoulvie was really removed from the field of strife. As to the Begum,\r\nshe still remained unsubdued, moving from place to place according as\r\nshe could gather a large body of adherents around her. It was about the\r\nsecond week in June, so far as is rendered apparent by the\r\ncorrespondence, that she received Jung Bahadoor’s very decisive\r\nrejection of the appeal made by her for his alliance, lately adverted\r\nto; and as she lost nearly at the same time her able coadjutor the\r\nMoulvie, her prospects became more gloomy. Of Nena Sahib, little more\r\ncould be said than that he was true to his character—a coward in all\r\nthings. Where he was at any particular time, the British seldom\r\ncertainly knew: he had not the courage of the Moulvie, or the Begum, or\r\nthe Ranee.\r\n\r\nIn connection rather with the province of Goruckpore than with that of\r\nOude, though nearly on the boundary-line between the two, must be\r\nmentioned two encounters in which the naval brigade honourably\r\ndistinguished itself. The _Shannon’s_ seamen, it will be remembered,\r\nsupplied a naval brigade under the lamented Captain Sir William Peel,\r\nfor service in Oude; but there was also another brigade furnished by the\r\n_Pearl_, of which Captain Sotheby was commander. During May and June,\r\nthis brigade was associated with certain troops and marines in the\r\nmaintenance of order on the Goruckpore frontier of Oude. While on\r\ndetached service, Major Cox and Lieutenant Turnour came in contact with\r\nthe enemy on the 9th of June. The lieutenant had under him two\r\n12-pounder howitzers, a 24-pounder rocket-tube, and about fifty seamen\r\nof the _Pearl’s_ crew; Lieutenant Pym had the control of about twenty\r\nmarines from the same ship; while Major Cox, who commanded the whole\r\ndetachment, had under him a small military force comprising two hundred\r\nmen of the 13th light infantry, two troops of Madras cavalry, two troops\r\nof Bengal cavalry, and twenty Sikhs. It was altogether a singular medley\r\nof combatants. Having heard that Mahomed Hussein was occupying the\r\nneighbouring village of Amorha or Amorah in great force, Major Cox\r\nresolved to attack him. He divided his detachment into two parts, one\r\nheaded by himself, and the other by Major Richardson. The seamen and\r\nmarines were attached to Richardson’s party. Starting at two o’clock in\r\nthe morning, they marched along the road leading through the village.\r\nWhen within a mile of Amorah, they received a heavy fire from the rebel\r\nskirmishers; these were immediately attacked and driven in by Pym and\r\nthe marines; while the guns threw shot and shell on the main body.\r\nAttempting to retreat on the other flank, Cox met and frustrated them;\r\nand the result of the skirmish was a decisive abandonment of the village\r\nby the rebels. Nine days afterwards another force, similar in\r\nconstitution but larger in numbers, comprising in its naval element\r\nabout a hundred and ten seamen, set out from Captangunje to make another\r\nattack on Mahomed Hussein, who was posted with four thousand rebels at\r\nHurreah, about eight miles off. On approaching near Hurreah, the enemy’s\r\nskirmishers were descried thrown across the river Gogra, screened in\r\nthick bamboo jungles, villages, topes of trees, and a dry nullah.\r\nBritish skirmishers were quickly sent on ahead, drove in the enemy, and\r\nwaded the river after them up to their waists; the guns followed, and\r\nthe enemy were driven from tope to tope, and from every place of\r\nconcealment, and chased for four miles. The heat was tremendous;\r\ninsomuch that seven hours’ marching, fighting, and pursuing nearly\r\nknocked up officers and men. Mahomed Hussein, however, was severely\r\ndefeated, and this was deemed a sufficient reward for all the fatigues\r\nand privations. The _Pearl’s_ naval brigade counted this as the tenth\r\ntime in which it had been in action in nine months.\r\n\r\nIt may be here mentioned that an endeavour was made, towards the end of\r\nJune, to estimate the number of thalookdars and other petty chieftains\r\nwho were in arms against the British in the province of Oude; together\r\nwith the amount of force at their disposal. The estimate was not wholly\r\nreliable, for the means of obtaining correct information were very\r\ndeficient. The list published in some of the Bombay newspapers,\r\nprofessing to be the nearest attainable approach to the truth, included\r\nthe names of about thirty-five ‘thalookdars,’ ‘rajahs,’ and\r\n‘chuckladars,’ holding among them about twenty-five mud-forts, with\r\nnearly a hundred guns, and forty thousand armed retainers. The chief\r\nitems in this curious list were—‘The three chuckladars Mahomed Hussein,\r\nMehndee Hussein, and Shaik Padil Imam, have twenty-three guns and ten\r\nthousand men massed about Sultanpore; some occupying Saloun, ten kos\r\nfrom Roy Bareilly’—‘At Nain, within nine kos of Roy Bareilly, four\r\nthalookdars, named Juggernath Buksh, Bugwan Buksh, Bussunth Singh, and\r\nJuggernath (?), have collected eight guns and six thousand men’—‘Banie\r\nMadhao, thalookdar; at Sukerpore, a strong fort surrounded by jungle, a\r\nfew kos from Roy Bareilly; nineteen guns and eight thousand men’—‘Rajah\r\nAli Buksh Khan, at Moham, a small fort twenty-five kos east of Lucknow;\r\nfive guns and fifteen hundred men.’ Most of the rebel gatherings here\r\nadverted to were in the region around Roy Bareilly, southeast of\r\nLucknow.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these high-sounding names and formidable numbers,\r\nthe cause of regular government in Oude was gradually advancing. The\r\nrebels could no longer endanger; they could only annoy. Mr Montgomery,\r\nat Lucknow, intrusted with large powers by the governor-general, was\r\ngradually feeling his way. While Crommelin took charge of the immediate\r\ndefence of that city, and Hope Grant was grappling with the rebels in\r\nthe open field, Montgomery was employed in re-establishing the network\r\nof judicial and revenue organisation, as favourable opportunities arose.\r\nThe Rajah of Kapoorthully, lately adverted to, undertook the defence of\r\nthe region between the Bunnee and Cawnpore; while Hope Grant kept a\r\nvigilant eye on the centre of Oude. The astute and double-dealing Maun\r\nSingh was placed in a singular position. He was distrusted by both\r\nparties, because he would not openly side with one against the other. As\r\nthe chieftain of Shahgunje, on the river Gogra, very near the eastern\r\nfrontier of Oude, he would be formidable either as a friend or a foe. He\r\nhad a fort, guns, and men at his command. There could be no question\r\nthat for thirteen months he had been watching the progress of events, to\r\ndetermine in which balance to throw his sword; and it was equally\r\nevident that he was gradually recognising more and more the value of\r\nEnglish friendship—as a consequence, he was bitterly disliked by the\r\nrebel leaders. Taking a view of the state of Oude generally during June,\r\nit is necessary to make a distinction between the earlier and the later\r\ndays of the month. The former was much less favourable than the latter.\r\nIt could not truthfully be said that the pacification proceeded rapidly.\r\nInjury was wrought by the party-tactics concerning the famous\r\nproclamation penned by Viscount Canning and condemned by the Earl of\r\nEllenborough. The violent discussions arising out of that collision of\r\nopinion could not be wholly concealed from the natives of India. It\r\ncannot be doubted that many of the reckless and unscrupulous speeches\r\nmade in the British parliament became known to, and cherished by, the\r\ninsurgent chieftains. When a halo of suffering virtue was thrown around\r\nthe Oudian royal family, and when the Queen of England’s viceroy in\r\nIndia was spoken of almost as a murderer and robber, the power of the\r\ngovernment became necessarily shaken, and the difficulties of\r\npacification increased. The proclamation was modified; nay, Mr\r\nMontgomery received discretionary powers to determine whether, and when,\r\nand where there should be a proclamation at all—the governor-general\r\nwisely leaving it to his sagacity to be guided by the circumstance of\r\ntime and place. At the beginning of June little had been effected\r\ntowards winning the submission of the malcontent thalookdars and\r\nchuckladars; the hopes of successful rebellion had not been sufficiently\r\ndamped. Nevertheless, as the month advanced, and when the Moulvie was\r\ndead and the Gwalior rebels beaten, the Oudian landowners, by ones and\r\ntwos, began to look out for a compromise, which might enable them safely\r\nto abandon a losing cause. One of the most embarrassing difficulties\r\nperhaps was this—that the rebel leaders made instant war against any\r\nthalookdars or chuckladars who gave in their submission to the British\r\ngovernment under the modified proclamation—thereby deterring the more\r\ntimid landowners from the adoption of this course. Maun Singh himself\r\nwas besieged by an insurgent force; but his means of resistance were\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nOne of the evidences afforded that the pacification of Oude was\r\nconsidered to be gradually approaching, was the disbandment of the corps\r\nof Volunteer Cavalry, which was composed almost wholly of officers and\r\ngentlemen, and which had rendered such eminent services at a time when\r\nEuropean troops were doubly precious from their extreme rarity. In a\r\nnotification issued at Calcutta, Viscount Canning, after mentioning some\r\nof the arrangements connected with the disbanding, thus spoke of the\r\nservices of the corps: ‘The Volunteer Cavalry took a prominent part in\r\nall the successes which marked the advance of the late Major-general Sir\r\nHenry Havelock from Allahabad to Lucknow; and on every occasion of its\r\nemployment against the rebels—whether on the advance to Lucknow, or as\r\npart of the force with which Major-general Sir James Outram held Alum\r\nBagh—this corps has greatly distinguished itself by its gallantry in\r\naction, and by its fortitude and endurance under great exposure and\r\nfatigue. The governor-general offers to Major Barrow, who ably commanded\r\nthe Volunteer Cavalry, and boldly led them in all the operations in\r\nwhich they were engaged, his most cordial acknowledgments for his very\r\nvaluable services: and to Captain Lynch, and all the officers and men\r\nwho composed this corps, his lordship tenders his best thanks for the\r\neminent good conduct and exemplary courage which they displayed during\r\nthe whole time that the corps was embodied.’ The farewell of Sir James\r\nOutram was more hearty, because less official.[181]\r\n\r\nDirecting our attention next to the Doab and Rohilcund, it becomes at\r\nonce apparent that organisation and systematic government made great\r\nadvances during the month of June. The Doab no longer contained any\r\nlarge body of armed rebels. There were numerous smaller bands, but these\r\nbands chiefly made use of the Doab as a route of passage. The hopes of\r\nthe rebel leaders were directed mainly towards two regions—Oude, on the\r\nnorth of the Ganges; and Central India, on the south of the Jumna.\r\nAccording as the fortunes of war (or rather depredation) tended in the\r\none direction or the other, so did groups of armed insurgents cross, or\r\nattempt to cross, those rivers by means of the ghâts or ferries. If the\r\nchances for rebel success appeared stronger at Lucknow or Fyzabad,\r\nBareilly or Shahjehanpoor, this current tended northward, or rather\r\nnortheastward: if Calpee or Jhansi, Gwalior or Jeypoor, excited the\r\nhopes of the insurgents, the current took an opposite direction. The\r\nDoab, in either case, was regarded rather as a line of transit than as a\r\nfield of contest. Sir Colin Campbell, well acquainted with this fact,\r\ndevoted a portion of his attention to the ghâts on the two great rivers.\r\nIt became very important to check if possible the marching and\r\ncountermarching of the rebels across the Doab; and several columns and\r\ndetachments of troops were engaged in this duty during the month now\r\nunder notice. The success of the few actual encounters depended very\r\nmuch on the course of events in Scindia’s dominions, narrated in the\r\nlast chapter. When Gwalior fell into the hands of Tanteea Topee and his\r\nassociates, all the turbulent chieftains in the surrounding districts\r\ndisplayed an audacity and hopefulness which they had not exhibited\r\nduring the preceding month; but when Sir Hugh Rose reconquered that\r\ncity, and replaced Scindia on his throne, timidity succeeded to\r\naudacity, misgiving to hopefulness.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief, after his participation in the reconquest and\r\npacification of Rohilcund, returned to his former quarters at Futteghur,\r\nwhere he remained until the second week in June. Throughout the month he\r\nwas personally engaged in no hostilities; he was occupied either in\r\nstudying how to give his heat-worn soldiers repose, or how best to\r\nemploy those whose services in the field were still indispensable. The\r\ngovernor-general much desired his presence at Allahabad, to confer with\r\nhim personally on the military arrangements necessary during the summer\r\nand autumn. It afforded a significant proof of the scattered position of\r\nthe British forces, that during the first week in June there were no\r\nsoldiers that could be spared to escort Sir Colin from Futteghur to\r\nAllahabad. Quiet as the Doab was, compared with its condition earlier in\r\nthe year, there were still rebel bands occasionally crossing and\r\nrecrossing it, and these bands would have hazarded much to capture a\r\nprize so important as the commander-in-chief of the Anglo-Indian army.\r\nHe could not safely move without an escort, and he had to delay his\r\njourney until a few troops came in from Shahjehanpoor and other\r\nstations. While at Futteghur he caused a search to be made in the\r\nbazaars of that place and Furruckabad for sulphur, in order that any\r\nstores of that substance might be seized by and for the government. The\r\nrebels of the various provinces still possessed many guns; the\r\nchieftains and landowners still owned more weapons of various kinds than\r\nthey chose to acknowledge to the government; there was iron for the\r\nmaking of cannon-balls; there were charcoal and saltpetre towards the\r\nmaking of gunpowder; but there was one ingredient, sulphur, without\r\nwhich all the firearms of the insurgents would be useless; and as\r\nsulphur was an imported article in India, the government made attempts\r\nto obtain possession of any stores of that substance that might be in\r\ndoubtful hands. Percussion-caps, too, were becoming scarce among the\r\nrebels; and, the materials and machinery for making more being wanting,\r\nthey were perforce superseded by the less effective matchlock.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Doab at that time is well told in connection with a\r\njourney made by Mr Russell. After the Rohilcund campaign was over, this\r\nactive journalist looked about him to determine what was best worth\r\nseeing and describing, in reference to his special duties. If he went\r\nwith or after Sir Colin to Allahabad, he would get to the head-quarters\r\nof politics, where very few stirring military operations were to be\r\nwitnessed; if he went northeast into Oude, or southwest into Central\r\nIndia, he might, after much danger and difficulty, become involved in\r\nthe movements of some flying column, ill assorting with the necessities\r\nof a lame man—for he still suffered from an injury by a kick from a\r\nhorse. Mr Russell therefore resolved upon a journey through the Upper\r\nDoab from Futteghur to Delhi, and thence by Umballa to the healthy\r\nhill-station of Simla. He travelled by Bhowgong, Eytah, Gosaigunje, and\r\nAllygurh, meeting with ample evidence on the way of the ruin resulting\r\nfrom thirteen months of anarchy. Of the dâk bungalows or stations he\r\nsays: ‘Let no one understand by this a pleasant roadside hostelry with\r\nlarge out-offices, spacious court-yard, teams of horses, and hissing\r\nostlers; rather let him see a mud-hovel by the way, standing out, the\r\nonly elevation in the dead level of baked earth, a few trees under which\r\nare tethered some wretched horses, and a group of men’—whose dress\r\nconsisted of little beyond a turban. From Bhowgong to Eytah the country\r\nlooked like a desert; and by the roadside, at intervals of ten miles or\r\nless, were thannahs or police-stations—small one-storied houses, bearing\r\ntraces of the destructiveness of the rebel leader which had so often\r\nswept the district. He crossed the Kallee Nuddee at a point where the\r\nCompany had never yet introduced the civilised agency of a regular\r\nbridge. The gharry was pushed and dragged down a shelving bank of loose\r\nsand, and then over a rickety creaky bridge of boats—the native\r\nattendants making much use of the primitive distended bladders and\r\nearthen jars as floating supporters. Arrived at Eytah, he found the\r\nplace little other than a heap of blackened ruins, with enclosures\r\nbroken down and trees lopped off at the stem. Yet here were three\r\nEnglishmen, civil servants of the Company, engaged in re-establishing\r\nthe machinery of regular government. Mr Russell, like every one else,\r\ntried all the varieties of language to express adequately the tremendous\r\nheat of an Indian June. He left Eytah at two in the afternoon. ‘The\r\ngharry was like an oven; the metal-work burning so that it could not be\r\nborne in contact with the hand for an instant. The wind reminded me of\r\nthe deadly blast which swept over us on the march to Futteghur that\r\ndreadful morning when we left Rohilcund. Not a tree to shade the road;\r\non each side a parched, dull, dun-coloured plain, with the waving\r\nheat-lines dancing up and down over its blighted surface; and whirling\r\ndust-storms or “devils,” as they are called, careering to and fro as if\r\nin demoniac glee in their own infernal region. On such a day as this\r\nLake’s men (half a century earlier) fell file after file on their\r\ndreadful journey. Could I have found shelter, I would gladly have\r\nstopped, for even the natives suffered, and the horses were quite done\r\nup; but in India, in peace and war, one’s motto must be “No backward\r\nstep!”—so on we went.’ After passing through many small towns and poor\r\nvillages, in which half the houses were either ruined or shut up, he\r\nreached Allygurh, where, ‘being late, there was nothing ready at the\r\nbungalow but mosquitoes.’ Pursuing his journey, he at length reached\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nThe imperial city was now wholly and safely under British control.\r\nSentries guarded the bridge of boats over the Jumna, allowing no native\r\nto pass without scrutiny; the fort of the Selimgurh was garrisoned by a\r\nsmall but trusty detachment. The plan, once contemplated, of destroying\r\nthe defences, had not been adopted; the majestic wall, though shattered\r\nand ball-pierced in parts, remained in other respects entire. The\r\ndefences were, altogether, calculated to strike a stranger with\r\nsurprise, at the height and solidity of the wall, the formidable nature\r\nof the bastions, the depth and width of the dry ditch, the completeness\r\nof the glacis, and the security of such of the gates as had not been\r\nbattered down or blown in. Some of the streets of the city had escaped\r\nthe havoc of war; but others exhibited the effects of bombardment and\r\nassault in a terrible degree, although nine months of peaceful\r\noccupation had intervened; houses pitted with marks of shot and bullet,\r\npublic buildings shattered and half in ruins, trees by the wayside split\r\nand rent, doors and windows splintered, gables torn out of houses,\r\njagged holes completely through the walls. Half the houses in the city\r\nwere shut; and the other half had not yet regained their regular steady\r\ninhabitants. The mighty palace of the Moguls was nearly as grand as ever\r\non the outside; but all within displayed a wreck of oriental splendour.\r\nThe exquisite Dewani Khas, when Mr Russell was there, instead of being\r\nfilled with turbaned and bejewelled rajahs, Mogul guards, and oriental\r\nmagnificence, as in the olden days, was occupied by British\r\ninfantry—infantry, too, engaged in the humblest of barrack domestic\r\nduties. ‘From pillar to pillar and column to column extended the\r\ngraceful arches of the clothes-line, with shirts and socks and drawers\r\nflaunting in the air in lieu of silken banners. Long lines of charpoys\r\nor bedsteads stretched from one end of the hall to the other—arms were\r\npiled against the columns—pouches, belts, and bayonets depended from the\r\nwalls; and in the place where once blazed the fabulous glories of the\r\npeacock’s throne, reclined a private of her Majesty’s 61st, of a very\r\nMilesian type of countenance.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SURAT.—From a View in the Library of the East India Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe old king still remained a prisoner at Delhi. The drivelling, sensual\r\ndescendant of Tamerlane, shorn of everything that could impart dignity,\r\noccupied some of the smaller apartments of the palace, with a few of his\r\nwives, children, and grandchildren, near him. All were fretful and\r\ndiscontented, as they well might be: for they had nothing to see,\r\nnowhere to go, no honours to receive, no magnificence to luxuriate in.\r\nWhen interrogated by visitors concerning the early days of the Revolt,\r\nhe was peevish, and wished to change the subject; and when his youngest\r\nbegum, and his son Jumma Bukht, were induced to converse, the absence of\r\nfamily unity—if such a thing is possible in an oriental palace—was\r\napparent enough.\r\n\r\nConsidered politically, Delhi had the great advantage, during the spring\r\nmonths, of being placed under Sir John Lawrence. The province which\r\ncontained the once imperial city was detached from the ‘northwestern’\r\ngroup, and made—with Sirhind, the Punjaub, and the Peshawur Valley—one\r\ncompact and extensive government, under the control of one who, morally\r\nspeaking, was perhaps the greatest man in India. It was necessary to\r\nreconstruct a government; but much careful consideration was needed\r\nbefore the principle of construction could be settled. If the peaceful\r\nindustrious population would return to their homes and occupations,\r\ntheir presence would doubtless be welcome; but the neighbouring villages\r\nstill swarmed with desperate characters, whose residence in Delhi would\r\nbe productive of evil. Many of the better class of natives feared that\r\nthe imperial city would never recover; that the injury which its\r\nbuildings had received during the siege, the disturbance of trade by the\r\nhurried exit of the regular inhabitants, the enormous losses by plunder\r\nand forfeiture, and the break-up of the imperial establishment in the\r\npalace, had combined to inflict a blow which would be fatal to the once\r\ngreat Mogul capital. Delhi, nevertheless, had outlived many terrible\r\nstorms; and these prognostications might be destined to fail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LAHORE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the steady occupation of Delhi during the winter and\r\nspring was the gradual departure of troops to other districts where they\r\nwere more needed. Among these was one of the native regiments. The\r\n‘gallant little Goorkhas,’ as the British troops were accustomed to\r\ndesignate the soldiers of the Sirmoor and Kumaon battalions, held their\r\nhigh reputation to the very last. The Sirmoor battalion had marched down\r\nto Delhi at the very beginning of the disturbances, and during more than\r\ntwelve months had been on continuous duty in and near that region. The\r\ntime had now come when a respite could be given to their labours. They\r\ntook their departure to the healthy hill-station of Deyrah Dhoon. As\r\nthey marched out of Delhi, headed by their commandant, Colonel Reid,\r\nthey were escorted over the bridge by the 2d Bengal Europeans, who\r\ncheered them lustily, and inspirited them with a melody, the meaning of\r\nwhich they had perchance by this time learned—‘_Should auld acquaintance\r\nbe forgot_.’ An officer, well familiar with these ‘jolly little\r\nGoorkhas,’ remarked on this occasion: ‘There is not in military history\r\na brighter or purer page than the record of the services and faithful\r\nconduct of the Sirmoor Goorkha battalion during the past year. First in\r\nthe field, always in front, prominent, and incessantly fighting\r\nthroughout the entire campaign and siege-operations before Delhi, the\r\nregiment has covered itself with honour and glory. In our darkest days,\r\nthere was never a whisper, a suspicion, the shadow of a doubt of the\r\nhonest loyalty and fidelity of these brave, simple-minded, and devoted\r\nsoldiers. When others turned traitors, robbers, assassins, these rushed\r\nwithout a moment’s hesitation to our side, fought the good fight, bled,\r\nand died, faithful to their salt, honourable and true to the last.’\r\n\r\nThe Punjaub—at Lahore and all the other cities and stations—was so\r\nsteadily and watchfully governed, that no disturbances took place except\r\nof a very slight character—personally distressing, it is true, but not\r\nnationally or politically of any moment. One such was the following: On\r\na certain day a number of disbanded sepoys, who had long before taken\r\nrefuge in Cashmere, recrossed the frontiers, and attacked the Christians\r\nstationed at a place called Madhopore; they murdered a few, including\r\nchildren, under circumstances of great barbarity. No other reason could\r\nbe assigned for this brutality than a vengeful thirst for European\r\nblood. Hastily they crossed again into Cashmere, taking with them a\r\nquantity of plunder. A demand was at once made upon the chief of\r\nCashmere, Rumbeer Singh, to capture and give them up; which demand was\r\nshortly afterwards attended to, although he had exhibited a little\r\nremissness in this matter in one or two former instances. The Rajah of\r\nCashmere was not wholly unsuspected, indeed, of unfavourable views\r\ntowards the British; and, with a less firm man than John Lawrence at his\r\nelbow, he might possibly have made his mountain territory a retreat for\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nSinde, the land of the Indus, remained firmly in the hands of Mr Frere\r\nand General Jacob, the one as civil commissioner and the other as\r\nmilitary commandant. At one period during the month, however, Frere was\r\ncalled upon to settle a question of religious zealotry, which might have\r\nkindled into a flame if not promptly dealt with. A Mohammedan of\r\nrespectable character came to him, while at Hydrabad, and complained of\r\nan inscription on the inner wall of an open-fronted shop belonging to\r\nthe Christian Mission. The inscription comprised one or two quotations\r\nfrom the Koran, and an argument to disprove the divine authority of the\r\nProphet of Islam, from the evidence of the Koran itself. It was prepared\r\nand written, in the Sindhi and Arabic languages, by the Rev. Mr\r\nMatchett; and the Rev. Mr Gell caused it to be conspicuously exhibited\r\nin the open shop where Bibles were sold or distributed. The complainant\r\nwas one Gholam Ali, a Mohammedan lately returned from a pilgrimage to\r\nMecca. He stated to Mr Frere that the inscription, visible to all the\r\npassers-by in the main bazaar of the city, was irritating and offensive\r\nto the Mohammedans. Mr Frere read the inscription; and in afterwards\r\nexplaining to Lord Elphinstone the reasons which determined his decision\r\non the subject, he said: ‘I am willing to be judged by any one who has\r\nany acquaintance with the ordinary feelings of a bigoted Mohammedan\r\npopulation as to the probable effects of such a placard on them. I feel\r\nconfident that any such unprejudiced person would agree with me, that\r\nthere was much danger of its causing an outbreak of fanatical violence;\r\nand holding that opinion, I cannot think that I should have been\r\njustified in allowing it to remain. It is quite possible it might never\r\nhave caused any breach of the peace; but I did not think the present a\r\ntime to try unnecessary experiments as to how much a fanatical native\r\npopulation will or will not bear in the way of provocation.’ Mr Frere\r\nwrote to the Rev. Mr Gell, the mission-superintendent, requesting him to\r\nremove the inscription; on the ground that, however well meant, it might\r\nproduce more harm than good. This proceeding led to a violent outcry on\r\nthe part of the missionaries and their supporters, and to an erroneous\r\nnarrative forwarded to the government of Bombay—accusing Mr Frere of\r\nencouraging Mohammedanism and insulting Christianity. It was one of\r\nthose numerous occasions, presented during the course of the Revolt and\r\nits suppression, in which the governing authorities had much difficulty\r\nin steering clearly through the opposite dangers of two religious\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose’s operations in Central India during the month of June\r\nwere treated so fully in the last chapter, that little need be added\r\nhere on the subject. The recapture of Gwalior was the great event; all\r\nthe operations in Rajpootana, Bundelcund, Goojerat, and Holkar’s\r\nterritory, were subordinate to it. When the month closed, General\r\nRoberts, with the ‘Rajpootana Field-force,’ was on the march from\r\nNuseerabad to Jeypoor, to check the progress of the Gwalior fugitives in\r\nthat direction. Brigadier Showers was at or near Futtehpore Sikri,\r\nguarding the Agra route. Major Ramsey was advancing from Rohilcund with\r\nthe Kumaon battalion. The English residents at Jeypoor and Bhurtpore\r\nwere actively engaged in supporting, so far as was practicable, the\r\nloyal tendencies of the rajahs of those two states, so as to enable them\r\nto resist the rebels if the latter were to enter either of those cities.\r\nThe doubt was, not so much of the rajahs, as of the soldiery in their\r\npay, whose fidelity could not wholly be relied on. The main body of\r\nGwalior fugitives were at that time somewhere near Hindoun, a town about\r\nequidistant from Gwalior, Agra, and Jeypoor; whether they were about to\r\nadvance to Ummerpore on the Jeypoor road, to Mhow on the Ulwar road, or\r\nto any other point, was not well known. Indeed, the rebels themselves\r\nseemed to be divided in opinion as to their future movements; they were\r\nlooking around, to find some rajah, nawab, or nazim who would join them\r\nin rebellion; but those chieftains were becoming more and more cautious\r\nhow they committed themselves in this way. The spectacle of rajahs blown\r\naway from guns, and nawabs hung from gallows, was by no means\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nGeneral Whitlock’s field-force, at the end of June, was distributed in\r\nvarious parts of Bundelcund, keeping in subjection the petty chieftains\r\nhere and there in arms; for there was no longer anything like a\r\nformidable army of rebels opposed to him. Brigadier Carpenter, with\r\nthree or four hundred men, and two guns, was at Kirkee. Major Dallas,\r\nwith the 1st Madras N.I., was assisting the civil authorities in\r\nre-establishing the revenue and judicial departments. Colonel Reede,\r\nwith two hundred men and two guns, was sent to look after the safety of\r\nHumeerpoor and its neighbourhood. Brigadier Macduff, with a portion of\r\nH.M. 43d foot, went to Calpee. Brigadier Munsey, with a small column of\r\ninfantry, cavalry, and artillery, was sent to Nowgong, to protect a\r\nconvoy of stores on their way from Saugor. The remainder of the force\r\nencamped for a while at Banda as head-quarters, having with them Narain\r\nRao and Madhoo Rao as prisoners, a large number of guns, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of treasure and jewels captured from the rebels.\r\nWhitlock’s long-continued exertions, although not attended by any great\r\nbattles, had gradually restored something like tranquillity to this\r\ndistracted region. Bundelcund and the Saugor territory, from the Jumna\r\nto the Nerbudda, had for nearly twelve months been in a miserable\r\ncondition. The various bands of mutineers passing from Dinapoor and\r\nelsewhere wrought great mischief; powerful villages preyed upon their\r\nweaker neighbours; and the self-installed nawabs and rajahs extorted\r\nevery farthing they could get from the peasantry and towns-people. Many\r\nvillages were completely deserted; many more had been burned to the\r\nground, and the people plundered of all the grain and other property\r\nwhich they possessed. The lesson which the peaceful natives had received\r\nfrom the rebels was a severe one, calculated to teach them the\r\nadvantages of regular government under British influence.\r\n\r\nAmong the many ‘field-forces’ which about this time were broken up, to\r\nrelieve the troops from some of their exhausting labours in fiercely hot\r\nweather, was a small one called the ‘Satpoora Field-force.’ Satpoora is\r\na town in Holkar’s Mahratta dominions, about seventy-five miles\r\nsoutheast of Indore, and very near the boundary of the Nagpoor\r\nterritory. Satpoora also gives name to a range of mountains which,\r\nrunning east and west, separates the valley of the Taptee from that of\r\nthe Nerbudda; and it was in this sense that the designation ‘Satpoora\r\nField-force’ was given to a small body of troops collected for the\r\ndefence of the region in question. Major Evans, commanding this force,\r\ntook farewell of his men on the 22d of June. In an order or address,\r\ndated from his camp at Jalwana, he thanked Captain Sealey and the\r\nartillery, Captain Langston and the Rifles, Captain Baugh and the 9th\r\nBombay N.I., Captain Briggs and the 19th, Lieutenant Latouche and the\r\nPoonah horse—being the components of his force. He made special mention\r\nof a certain encounter on the 11th of April; ‘when the insurgents,\r\nposted in positions from which they supposed they could not be driven,\r\nwere at once attacked at three different points; and despite a most\r\nobstinate and deadly resistance, were signally defeated and dispersed.’\r\nHe proceeded in commendatory terms to state that ‘the effect on the\r\nenemy has been so dispiriting that they have never again dared to\r\ncollect in force; the disaffected chiefs themselves wandering about in\r\nconcealment. The force has therefore been disappointed in not being able\r\nagain to shew their prowess, which all were so eager to do, and would\r\nhave done so well, had opportunity offered.’\r\n\r\nGujerat, the Guicowar’s territory—situated south of Rajpootana, and west\r\nof Holkar’s territory—had, it will be remembered, been most happily and\r\neffectively disarmed by Sir Richmond Shakespear, political resident at\r\nthe court of the Guicowar; thereby lessening the probability of any\r\nhostile outbreak. Gujerat became subject, however, during this month, to\r\none of those strange mysteries in which orientals so much delight. The\r\nlotus, and the chupatties, and the ‘something white,’ had had their day;\r\nand now arose the mystery of _twigs_. It was ascertained that twigs or\r\nsmall branches had been circulated from village to village in the\r\nprovince of Gujerat, as signals or watchwords; but nothing could be\r\nlearned concerning their meaning. An ancient custom existed in many\r\nparts of India, of measuring the footprints with straws or twigs\r\nwhenever a robbery had been committed, then forwarding them from village\r\nto village, until the measurement was found to implicate some one\r\nvillager; after which the village was made responsible. This and many\r\nother ancient customs were referred to; but nothing appeared to throw\r\nlight on the meaning of the twigs thus transmitted through Gujerat.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the maintenance of tranquillity in the Deccan, a small\r\nfield-force, composed of troops selected from the Poonah division of the\r\nBombay army, was made up, and placed under the command of Colonel Gall.\r\nStarting from Poonah, the colonel arrived at Aurungabad on the 8th of\r\nJune, and resumed his march on the following day to Jaulnah, a military\r\nstation in the northwest corner of the Nizam’s dominions. Large bands of\r\nRohilla marauders, expelled from the city of Hyderabad by the Nizam’s\r\ntroops, were known to be in various villages in the Jaulnah district;\r\nand it was deemed expedient to hold Colonel Gall’s force in readiness to\r\nwatch and disperse these men, lest their machinations should assume a\r\nmilitary form. A new cavalry corps named Beatson’s Horse assisted in\r\nthis object. This corps, organised by and under the active officer of\r\nthat name, consisted of recruits from various parts of the Deccan, for\r\nactive service in any regions where their presence might be deemed most\r\nuseful. At present, their quarters were at Jaulnah, where they were\r\nregularly picketed around the encampment at night. Arrangements were\r\nalso made for strengthening the Jaulnah district with a wing of the 92d\r\nHighlanders, and with several guns.\r\n\r\nOf the presidency of Bombay it may happily be said that—partly owing to\r\nthe scarcity of the Poorbeah element in the native army, partly to the\r\nsagacious and energetic government of Lord Elphinstone—the curse of\r\nrebellion was rendered very little apparent. Sinde, placed temporarily\r\nunder that presidency, was well looked after by Mr Frere; Gujerat was\r\nsafe under Sir Richmond Shakespear; Rajpootana was watched by the\r\nvigilant eye of General Roberts; while the northern Mahratta states, so\r\nfar as they were subject to Bombay influence, were under the care of Sir\r\nRobert Hamilton.\r\n\r\nCertain occurrences in the South Mahratta country, however, deserve to\r\nbe noticed both in their political and their military phases.\r\n\r\nNothing is more certain than that many of the insurgent bodies in India\r\nrose in arms on account of personal or local matters, bearing little\r\nrelation to the great military revolt, or to the so-called national\r\nrebellion. The derangement of regular government furnished opportunity\r\nfor those who had real or assumed grievances. An example of this kind\r\nwas furnished in the South Mahratta country. The natives of one of the\r\nleast known districts south of Bombay had been in the habit of cutting\r\ndown trees wherever they pleased, for the purpose of planting the\r\ncleared ground with various kinds of grain. The Bombay government at\r\nlength put a stop to this wholesale destruction of timber. This stoppage\r\nwas looked upon by the natives as an infringement of their ‘vested\r\nrights.’ A mischief-maker—one of the many usually at hand when the\r\npopulace are excited—appeared in the person of the Rajah of Jumbote, a\r\nplace southwest of Belgaum. He believed, or persuaded the people to\r\nbelieve, that Nena Sahib held Poonah with a large force; that the\r\nBritish troops were kept in check almost everywhere; and that it was a\r\nfavourable time for a rise against the constituted authorities who held\r\nsway there. Another cause for disaffection arose out of the Hindoo\r\ncustom of adoption; and this was felt in the South Mahratta country as\r\nin other parts of India. Many circumstances arose during the Revolt,\r\nshewing that the natives are familiar with and attached to this custom.\r\nWhen a prince, a chief, or a landowner, had no legitimate heir, it was\r\ncustomary for him to name a successor or heir, generally from among his\r\nkinsmen. So long as the East India Company had no territorial rights in\r\na particular province or region, there was no motive for interfering\r\nwith this custom; but self-interest afterwards stepped in, in a way that\r\nmay be very easily explained. The Company, we will suppose, made a\r\ntreaty with a native prince, to the effect that a certain state or a\r\ncertain revenue should belong to him ‘and his heirs for ever.’ If he had\r\nno legitimate heir, the Company was tempted to seize the golden prize\r\nafter his death, under the plea that the _adopted_ son was not a true\r\nrepresentative. A Hindoo custom was interpreted in an English sense,\r\nand, being found wanting, was disallowed; thereby enriching the Company.\r\nEnglish lawyers found no difficulty in supporting this course of\r\nproceeding, because it was consistent with English law. It was not,\r\nhowever, until the governor-generalship of the Marquis of Dalhousie,\r\nthat this kind of confiscation was extensively acted on; and hence the\r\ninterval between 1848 and 1858 was marked by much more irritation among\r\nnative princely families, than had been before exhibited in connection\r\nwith this particular subject. Be it right or wrong, thus to interpret a\r\nHindoo usage by an English test, the history of the Revolt plainly\r\nshewed that many of the bitterest enemies of the government were persons\r\nwhose domains or revenues had been disturbed by a refusal of the Company\r\nto acknowledge the principle of adoption in heirship. The miscreant Nena\r\nSahib, the spirited but unscrupulous Ranee of Jhansi, many of the\r\nprinces of the house of Delhi, and others whose names and deeds have\r\noften been recorded in these pages, had—for some years preceding the\r\noutbreak—brooded over their real or fancied wrongs in some such matters\r\nas these. Is it matter for surprise that they welcomed a day of\r\nrevenge—a day that might possibly restore to them that of which they\r\ndeemed themselves unjustly deprived?\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Nargoond was one of those to whom, in a minor degree, this\r\nprinciple applied. He was a South Mahratta prince, holding a small\r\nterritory eastward of Dharwar—separated from Bombay by the once\r\ndisturbed Kolapore district. Being one of the tributaries to the Bombay\r\ngovernment, he petitioned for leave to adopt an heir to his raj or\r\nrajahship; and the result of this petition was such as to render him a\r\nbitter enemy. His enmity made itself apparent about the date to which\r\nthis chapter relates, in intrigues with the malcontents around him. A\r\nruthless murder brought matters to an issue. Mr Manson, political agent\r\nfor the South Mahratta country, having cause to suspect the rajah, set\r\nout from Belgaum to seek a personal interview with him, in the hope of\r\ndissuading him from rebel movements. They had been on terms of intimacy,\r\nwhich seemed to justify this hope. On the evening of the 29th of May, Mr\r\nManson reached Ramdroog—the chieftain of which advised him to be on his\r\nguard, as the Rajah of Nargoond could not be relied on. The unhappy\r\ngentleman, believing otherwise, pushed on towards Nargoond. That same\r\nnight his palanquin was surrounded by a body of the rajah’s troops at\r\nSoorbund, fifteen miles from Nargoond, and the political agent was\r\nfoully murdered, together with most of his escort.\r\n\r\nThe Bombay government at once issued orders to attack the insurgents,\r\nand deal severely with the disaffected chieftains. It had been already\r\nascertained that in the Dharwar collectorate, besides the Rajah of\r\nNargoond, there were Bheem Rao of Moondurg, and the Desaee of Hembegee,\r\nto be confronted. The South Mahratta country, being near the\r\nboundary-line between the Bombay and Madras presidencies, had facilities\r\nfor receiving small bodies of troops from two directions, to quell any\r\ndisturbances that might arise. A Madras column, setting out from Bellary\r\nunder Major Hughes, proceeded northward, and invested the stronghold of\r\nBheem Rao at Kopal or Copal. A message was sent to this chief, giving\r\nhim three hours to remove the women and children from the place. He\r\nreturned no answer; whereupon a cannonade was opened. A breach was made\r\npracticable; a storming-party entered; the rebels gave way at every\r\npoint; and very speedily the town and fort were in Major Hughes’s\r\npossession. Bheem Rao himself, as well as Kenchengowda, the Desaee of\r\nHembegee, were among the slain on this occasion. While Hughes was thus\r\noccupied at Kopal, a small column of Bombay troops was engaged in\r\nanother part of the South Mahratta country. Three or four hundred men,\r\nwith two guns, started from Belgaum under Captain Paget, and joined a\r\nparty of Mahratta horse under Colonel Malcolm at Noolgoond. They\r\nadvanced on the 1st of June to Nargoond, the stronghold of the rebel\r\nrajah. This stronghold consisted of a fortress on the summit of a rock\r\neight hundred feet high, with the town at its base. A reconnaissance\r\nbeing made, it was found that nearly two thousand rebels were encamped\r\nabout a mile out of the town; and the rajah could be seen, on an\r\nelephant, brandishing his sword. Malcolm sent on the Mahratta horse to\r\ncommence the attack; with the two guns, two companies of the 74th\r\nHighlanders, and one of the 28th Bombay infantry, to support. Of\r\nfighting there was scarcely any; the rebels very soon fled from the\r\nplain and the town, and left them in the hands of Malcolm. The\r\nrock-fortress, however, still remained unconquered. Early in the morning\r\nof the 2d, a storming-party was sent to ascend the steep and rugged\r\npathway which led up to the gate of the fortress, prepared to blow it\r\nopen with powder. Only one rebel was visible; and after a couple of\r\nrifles had been fired at him, the gate was forced open and an entrance\r\nobtained. Four men, the only occupants of the fortress, threw themselves\r\nover a precipitous wall in a panic terror, and were dashed to\r\npieces—either not understanding or not believing the promise of quarter\r\noffered to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KOLAPORE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus fell the fortress of Nargoond, which had been regarded as a\r\nformidable stronghold ever since the days of Tippoo Saib. The rajah fled\r\nearly in the fight, with seven of his principal followers. Mr Souter,\r\npolice-superintendent at Belgaum, knowing the rajah’s complicity in the\r\nmurder of Mr Manson,[182] set out in pursuit of him. At sunset on the\r\n2d, the rajah and his followers were discovered skulking in a belt of\r\njungle on the banks of the Malpurba, near Ramdroog; all but one were\r\ncaptured, just as they were about to start for Punderpore. They were\r\nsent to Belgaum, to be tried by a special commission. As to the rajah,\r\nthe last hour of this wretched man was marked by very unseemly\r\ncircumstances. On the 11th of June he was brought to trial, before\r\nCaptain Schneider, political agent at Belgaum. He was found guilty of\r\nthe crimes imputed to him, and was sentenced to be hanged on the next\r\nday. Early in the morning of the 12th, two companies of H.M. 56th, and\r\ntwo of the 20th Bombay native infantry, marched into Belgaum from\r\nDharwar to afford a guard during the execution. When the last hour was\r\napproaching, the rajah begged hard to be blown from a gun, as a less\r\ndegrading death than hanging; but the authorities on the spot were not\r\nempowered to accede to this application. The gallows was erected, and\r\nthe hanging effected; but the rope broke, and the wretched man fell to\r\nthe ground, where an undignified struggle took place between him and his\r\nexecutioners. The extreme sentence of the law was at length carried out,\r\nbut not without evidences of mismanagement that added to the painfulness\r\nof the whole scene.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the affairs of the Bombay presidency generally, a few\r\nobservations may be made on the state of the native army. One of the\r\nquestions that pressed upon the authorities during many months bore\r\nrelation to the treatment of the disarmed sepoy regiments—regiments\r\nwhich, though disarmed for suspicious conduct, had not so far committed\r\nthemselves as to receive any more severe punishment. In the Punjaub Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence was troubled with the safe keeping of many thousands of\r\nthese men; he dared not re-arm them, for their fidelity was more than\r\ndoubtful; and he would not disband and dismiss them, lest they should\r\nswell the ranks of the rebels. Lord Elphinstone, governor of Bombay, was\r\naffected by this difficulty only in a small degree, because the\r\nmutineers in the Bombay army were few in number. A proceeding took\r\nplace, however, in the month now under notice, which will illustrate one\r\nof the modes adopted of dealing with these dangerous incumbrances. It\r\nwill be remembered[183] that in the early part of August 1857 many parts\r\nof the South Mahratta country were thrown into agitation by the\r\nappearance of mutiny among certain of the Bombay native troops.\r\nKolapore, Poonah, Satara, Belgaum, Dharwar, Rutnagherry, and Sawunt\r\nWaree were the chief places affected; a plot was discovered, in which\r\nsome of the troops were leagued with certain Mohammedan\r\nfanatics—discovered in time to prevent the massacre of numerous\r\nEuropeans. The 21st and 27th regiments were two of those implicated; or\r\nrather some of the companies in those regiments; while other companies,\r\nnot actually detected in the conspiracy, were simply disarmed. In this\r\ndisarmed state the men remained more than ten months, watched, but not\r\ntreated otherwise as culprits. At length a settlement of their treatment\r\nwas effected. Lord Elphinstone and his council decided as follows: That\r\nthe native commissioned officers, present when the disarming took place,\r\nshould be dismissed from the army, unless they could bring forward\r\nspecial proofs of fidelity—that of the native non-commissioned officers,\r\nthe elder should be expelled, and the younger reduced to the ranks—that\r\nthe sepoys or privates should not be expelled unless special grounds\r\nwere assignable in their disfavor—that the 21st and 27th regiments\r\nshould be formally erased from the Bombay army list, to mark with some\r\nstigma the conduct of those regiments—that two new regiments, to be\r\ncalled the 30th and 31st infantry, should be formed, with a rank lower\r\nin dignity than that of the other native infantry regiments of the\r\nBombay army—that all the privates of the (late) 21st and 27th, with\r\nexcepted instances, and such native officers as could clear themselves\r\nfrom ill charges, should form the bulk of the two new regiments—finally,\r\nthat the vacancies in the list of officers (subadars, jemadars,\r\nhavildars, naiks) should be filled by chosen sepoys who had worthily\r\ndistinguished themselves in the campaigns of Rajpootana and Central\r\nIndia. Lord Elphinstone, in his order in council relating to this\r\nmatter, dwelt upon the disgrace which had been brought upon the Bombay\r\narmy by the misdeeds of some of the men of the late 21st and 27th\r\nregiments; adverted to the terrible deaths which most of them had met\r\nwith in the Kolapore region; exhorted the rest to beware how they\r\nlistened to the solicitations and machinations of traitors; and added:\r\n‘The Governor in Council trusts that the 30th and 31st regiments will,\r\nby their future conduct, shew their determination to render themselves\r\nworthy of the leniency with which they have been treated, and to wipe\r\nout the stain which the crimes of the 21st and 27th have left upon the\r\ncharacter of the Bombay army; so that the recollection of their past\r\nmisdeeds may be as effectually effaced from the minds of men, as their\r\nformer numbers will be erased from the roll of the army.’\r\n\r\nAnother instance, somewhat analogous to this, was presented in the\r\nPunjaub. During the early days of the Revolt, the 36th and 61st Bengal\r\nregiments at Jullundur, and the 3d at Phillour, were among those which\r\nmutinied. Some of the sepoys in each, however, remained free from the\r\ntaint; they stood faithful under great temptation. At a later date even\r\nthese men were disarmed, from motives of policy; and they had none but\r\nnominal duties intrusted to them. At length Sir John Lawrence, finding\r\nthat these men had passed through the ordeal honourably, proposed that\r\nthey should be re-armed, and noticed in a way consistent with their\r\nmerits. This was agreed to. About three hundred and fifty officers and\r\nmen, the faithful exceptions of three unfaithful regiments, were formed\r\ninto a special corps to be called the Wufadar Pultun or ‘faithful\r\nregiment.’ This new corps was to be in four companies, organised on the\r\nsame footing as the Punjaub irregular infantry; and was to be stationed\r\nat some place where the men would not have their feelings wounded and\r\nirritated by the taunts of the Punjaubee soldiery—between whom and the\r\nHindustani sepoys the relations were anything but amicable. Any of the\r\nselected number who preferred it, might receive an honourable discharge\r\nfrom the army instead of entering any new corps. The experiment was\r\nregarded as an important one; seeing that it might afford a clue to the\r\nbest mode of dealing with the numerous disarmed sepoys in the Punjaub.\r\n\r\nThe Bombay presidency was not so closely engaged in political and\r\nmilitary matters as to neglect the machinery of peaceful industry, the\r\nstay and support of a nation. Another of those paths to commerce and\r\ncivilisation, railways, was opened for traffic in India in June. It was\r\na portion of a great trunk-line which, when completed, would connect\r\nBombay with Madras. The length opened was from Khandalla to Poonah; and\r\nthis, with another portion opened in 1853, completed a route from Bombay\r\nto Poonah, excepting a long tunnel under the range of hills called the\r\nBhore Ghauts, which was not expected to be completed until 1860. On the\r\nday of ceremonial opening, a journey was made from Bombay to Poonah and\r\nback in eighteen hours, including four hours of portage or porterage at\r\nthe Bhore Ghauts. There were intermediate stations at Kirkee and\r\nTulligaum. The Company organised a scheme including conveyance across\r\nthe ghauts, by palkees and gharries, as part of their passenger\r\ncontract. An instructive index to the advancing state of society in\r\nIndia was afforded by the fact, that one of the great Parsee merchants\r\nof Bombay, Cursetjee Jamsetjee, was the leading personage in the\r\nhospitalities connected with this railway-opening ceremonial.\r\n\r\nA few remarks on the sister presidency, and this chapter may close.\r\n\r\nIf Madras, now as in former months, was wholly spared from fighting and\r\ntreason, it at least furnished an instance of the difficulty attending\r\nany collision on religious matters with the natives. The Wesleyan\r\nmissionaries had a chapel and school in the district of Madras city\r\ncalled Royapettah. Many native children attended the school, for the\r\nsake of the secular instruction there given, without becoming formal\r\nconverts. One of them, a youth of fifteen or sixteen, mentioned to the\r\nRev. Mr Jenkins, the Wesleyan minister, his wish to become a Christian;\r\nit was found on inquiry, however, that the parents were averse to this;\r\nand Mr Jenkins left it to the youth whether he would join the mission or\r\nreturn to his parents. He chose the former course. Hereupon a\r\ndisturbance commenced among the friends of the family; this was put down\r\nby the police; but as the youth remained at the mission-house, the\r\nreligious prejudices of the natives became excited, and the disturbance\r\nswelled into a riot. A mob collected in front of the mission-house,\r\nentered the compound, threw stones and bricks at the house, forced open\r\nthe door, and broke all the furniture. Mr Jenkins and another missionary\r\nnamed Stephenson, retreated from room to room, until they got into the\r\nbathroom, and then managed to climb over a wall into another compound,\r\nwhere they found protection. It was a mere local and temporary riot,\r\nfollowed by the capture of some of the offenders and the escape of\r\nothers; but it was just such a spark as, in other regions of India,\r\nmight have set a whole province into a flame. The missionaries,\r\nestimating the youth’s age at seventeen or eighteen years, claimed for\r\nhim a right of determining whether he would return to his parents (who\r\nbelonged to the Moodelly caste), or enter the mission; whereas some of\r\nthe zealots on the other side, declaring that his age was only twelve or\r\nthirteen, advocated the rightful exercise of parental authority. The\r\nmagistrates, without entering into this question of disputed figures,\r\nrecommended to the missionaries the exercise of great caution, in any\r\nmatters likely to arouse the religious animosity of the natives; and\r\nthere can be little doubt that, in the prevailing state of native\r\nfeeling, such caution was eminently necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Note.\r\n\r\n  _Queen’s Regiments in India in June_.—Sufficient has been said in\r\n  former chapters to convey some notion of the European element in the\r\n  Indian army in past years; the necessity for increasing the strength\r\n  of that element; the relation between the Queen’s troops and the\r\n  Company’s troops; the difficulty of sparing additional troops from\r\n  England; the mode in which that difficulty was overcome; and the\r\n  controversy concerning the best route for troop-ships. It seems\r\n  desirable to add here a few particulars concerning the actual number\r\n  of European troops in India at or about the time to which this\r\n  chapter relates, and the localities in which they were stationed.\r\n\r\n  The following list, correct as to the regiments, is liable to\r\n  modification in respect of localities. Many of the regiments were at\r\n  the time in detachments, serving in different places; in such cases,\r\n  the station of the main body only is named. Other regiments were at\r\n  the time on the march; these are referred to the station towards\r\n  which they were marching.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   QUEEN’S TROOPS IN THE BENGAL ARMY.\r\n\r\n  It may here be remarked, that the distinctions between ‘fusiliers,’\r\n  ‘foot,’ ‘light infantry,’ ‘Highlanders,’ and ‘rifles,’ are more\r\n  nominal than real; these are all infantry regiments of the line,\r\n  with a special number attached to each—except the particular corps\r\n  called the ‘Rifle Brigade.’\r\n\r\n                              _Cavalry._\r\n                            2d Dra.

Nothing can more strikingly\r\n  illustrate the importance attached to the state of our Indian\r\n  possessions.\r\n\r\n  On the 1st of January 1857, there were about 26,000 royal troops and\r\n  12,000 Company’s European troops in India. During the ensuing\r\n  fifteen months, to April 1858, there were sent over 42,000 royal\r\n  troops and 5000 Company’s Europeans. These would have given a total\r\n  of 85,000 British troops in India; but it was estimated that war,\r\n  sickness, and heat had lessened this number to 50,000 available\r\n  effective men. At that time the arrangements of the English\r\n  authorities were such as to insure the speedy increase of this\r\n  European element to not less than 70,000 men; and during the summer,\r\n  still further advances were made in the same direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Chapter xxviii., p. 469.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  ‘MY DEAR BARROW—We are about to separate, perhaps for ever; but,\r\n  believe me, I shall ever retain you in affectionate remembrance, and\r\n  ever speak with that intense admiration which I feel for the glorious\r\n  volunteers whom you have commanded with such distinction. It would\r\n  afford me much pleasure to shake every one of them by the hand, and\r\n  tell them how warmly I feel towards them. But this is impossible; my\r\n  pressing duties will not allow me even to write a few farewell lines\r\n  to each of your officers: but I trust to your communicating to them\r\n  individually my affectionate adieu and sincerest wishes for their\r\n  prosperity. May God bless you and them.’ From one like Sir James, who\r\n  had had such special means of observing and appreciating the exertions\r\n  of the volunteer cavalry, this warm and genial letter must have been\r\n  doubly gratifying.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  The governor of Bombay, in a public notification, used many\r\n  expressions of respect towards the memory of the political agent.\r\n  Adverting to the advice given to Mr Manson not to trust himself to the\r\n  mercies of the Rajah of Nargoond, Lord Elphinstone said: ‘But with\r\n  that noble devotion to duty, of which the recent history of India has\r\n  presented so many instances, Mr Manson determined to make a final\r\n  effort to save the chief, by his personal influence, from the ruin\r\n  impending over him.’ He added that the facts shewed ‘that a gallant\r\n  and accomplished gentleman, who had proved himself a most valuable\r\n  servant of the state, has been basely murdered.’ And he concluded by\r\n  announcing that ‘the body of Mr Manson has been recovered, and has\r\n  been buried at Kulladgee. The Right Hon. the Governor in Council will\r\n  regard it as a sacred duty to make a provision for the families of the\r\n  brave men who lost their lives in defending one whose untimely fate is\r\n  now so deeply deplored.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  See Chap. xvii., pp. 289, 290.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Almorah, Hill-station in Kumaon.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n                  GRADUAL PACIFICATION IN THE AUTUMN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the events of the three months—July, August, and September, 1858—be\r\nestimated without due consideration, it might appear that the progress\r\nmade in India was hardly such as could fairly be called ‘pacification.’\r\nWhen it is found how frequently the Jugdispore rebels are mentioned in\r\nconnection with the affairs of Behar; how numerous were the thalookdars\r\nof Oude still in arms; how large an insurgent force the Begum held under\r\nher command; how fruitless were all the attempts to capture the\r\nmiscreant Nena Sahib; how severely the friendly thalookdars and\r\nzemindars of Oude were treated by those in the rebel ranks, as a means\r\nof deterring others from joining the English; how active was Tanteea\r\nTopee in escaping from Roberts and Napier, Smith and Michel, with his\r\ntreasure plundered from the Maharajah Scindia; how many petty chieftains\r\nin the Bundelcund and Mahratta territories were endeavouring to raise\r\nthemselves in power, during a period of disorder, by violence and\r\nplunder—there may be some justification for regarding the state of India\r\nas far from peaceful during those three months. But notwithstanding\r\nthese appearances, the pacification of the empire was unquestionably in\r\nprogress. The Bengal sepoys, the real mutineers, were becoming lessened\r\nin number every week, by the sword, the bullet, the gallows, and\r\nprivation. The insurgent bands, though many and apparently strong,\r\nconsisted more and more exclusively of rabble ruffians, whose chief\r\nmotive for action was plunder, and who seldom ventured to stand a\r\ncontest even with one-twentieth part their number of English troops. The\r\nregiments and drafts sent out from England, both to the Queen’s and the\r\nCompany’s armies, were regularly continued, so as to render it possible\r\nto supply a few British troops to all the points attacked or troubled.\r\nThere was a steady increase in the number of Jâts, Goorkhas, Bheels,\r\nScindians, Beloochees, &c., enlisted in British service, having little\r\nor no sympathy with the high-caste Hindustani Oudians who had been the\r\nauthors of so much mischief. There was a re-establishment of civil\r\ngovernment in all the provinces, and (excepting Oude) in nearly all the\r\ndistricts of each province; attended by a renewal of the revenue\r\narrangements, and by the maintenance of police bodies who aided in\r\nputting down rebels and marauders. There was an almost total absence of\r\nanything like nationality in the motions of the insurgents, or unity of\r\npurpose in their proceedings; the decrepit Emperor of Delhi, and the\r\nhalf-witted King of Oude, both of them prisoners, had almost gone out of\r\nthe thoughts of the natives—who, so far as they rebelled at all, looked\r\nout for new leaders, new paymasters, new plunder. In short, the British\r\ngovernment had gained the upper hand in every province throughout India;\r\nand preparations were everywhere made to maintain this hold so firmly,\r\nthat the discomfiture of the rebels became a matter almost of moral\r\ncertainty. Much remained to be done, and much time would be needed for\r\ndoing it; but the ‘beginning of the end’ was come, and men could speak\r\nwithout impropriety of the gradual pacification of India.\r\n\r\nThe events of these three months will not require any lengthened\r\ntreatment; of new mutinies there was only one; and the military and\r\nother operations will admit of rapid recital.\r\n\r\nCalcutta saw nothing of Viscount Canning during the spring, summer, and\r\nautumn. His lordship, as governor-general, appreciated the importance of\r\nbeing near Sir Colin Campbell, to consult with him daily on various\r\nmatters affecting the military operations in the disturbed districts.\r\nBoth were at Allahabad throughout the period to which this chapter\r\nrelates. The supreme council, however, remained at the presidential\r\ncapital, giving effect to numerous legislative measures, and carrying on\r\nthe regular government of the presidency. Calcutta was now almost\r\nentirely free from those panics which so frequently disturbed it during\r\nthe early months of the mutiny; rapine and bloodshed did not approach\r\nthe city, and the English residents gradually sobered down. Although the\r\nviolent and often absurd opposition to the governor-general had not\r\nquite ceased, it had greatly lessened; the dignified firmness of Lord\r\nCanning made a gradual conquest. Some of the newspapers, here as at\r\nBombay, invented proclamations and narratives, crimes and accusations,\r\nwith a disregard of truth which would hardly have been shewn by any\r\njournals in the mother-country; and those effusions which were not\r\nactually invented, too often received a colour ill calculated to convey\r\na correct idea of their nature. Many of the journalists never forgot or\r\nforgave the restrictions which the governor-general deemed it prudent to\r\nplace on the press in the summer of 1857; the amount of anonymous\r\nslander heaped on him was immense. One circumstance which enabled his\r\nlordship to live down the calumnies, was the discovery, made by the\r\njournalists in the following summer, that Lord Derby’s government was\r\nnot more disposed than that of Lord Palmerston to expel Viscount Canning\r\nfrom office—a matter which will have to be noticed more fully in another\r\nchapter. The more moderate journalists of the Anglo-Indian press, it\r\nmust in fairness be stated, did their part towards bringing about a more\r\nhealthy state of feeling.\r\n\r\nThat the authorities at Calcutta were not insensible to the value of\r\nnewspapers and journals, in a region so far away from England, was shewn\r\nby an arrangement made in the month of August—which afforded at the same\r\ntime a quiet but significant proof of an improved attention towards the\r\nwell-being of soldiers. An order was issued that a supply of newspapers\r\nand periodicals should be forwarded to the different military hospitals\r\nin Calcutta at the public expense. Those for the officers’ hospital[184]\r\ncomprised some magazines of a higher class than were included in the\r\nlist for the men’s hospitals; but such were to be sent afterwards to the\r\nmen’s hospitals, when the officers had perused them.\r\n\r\nIn connection with military matters, in and near the presidential city,\r\nit may be mentioned that the neighbourhood of Calcutta was the scene of\r\na settlement or colonisation very novel, and as unsatisfactory as it was\r\nnovel. It has been the custom to send over a small number of soldiers’\r\nwives with every British regiment sent to our colonies or foreign\r\nterritories. During the course of twelve months so many regiments\r\narrived at Calcutta, that these soldiers’ wives accumulated to eighteen\r\nhundred in number. They were consigned to the station at Dumdum, a few\r\nmiles north of Calcutta; and were attended by three or four surgeons and\r\none Protestant chaplain. The accommodation provided for them was\r\nsufficient for the women themselves, but not for the children, who added\r\ngreatly to their number. Many of these women, being of that ignorant and\r\nill-regulated class from which soldiers too frequently choose their\r\nwives, brought with them dirty habits and drinking tendencies; and\r\nthese, when the fierce heat of an Indian summer came, engendered\r\ndysentery and diarrhœa, from which diseases a large number of women and\r\nchildren died. Other irregularities of conduct appeared, among a mass of\r\nwomen so strangely separated from all home-ties; and arrangements were\r\ngradually made for breaking up this singular colony.\r\n\r\nThe details given in former chapters, especially in the ‘notes,’ will\r\nhave shewn how large was the number of regiments conveyed from the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the colonies to India; and when it is remembered that\r\nfar more of these landed at Calcutta than at Madras, Bombay, or\r\nKurachee, it will easily be understood how military an aspect they gave\r\nto the first-named city. Still, numerous as they were, they were never\r\nequal to the demand. Without making any long stay at Calcutta, they\r\nmarched to the scenes of action in the northwest. In the scarcity of\r\nregular troops, the Bengal government derived much valuable services\r\nfrom naval and marine brigades—men occupying a middle position between\r\nsoldiers and sailors. Captain Sir William Peel’s naval brigade has been\r\noften mentioned, in connection with gallant achievements in Oude; and\r\nCaptain Sotheby’s naval brigade also won a good name, in the provinces\r\neastward of Oude. But besides these, there were about a dozen different\r\nbodies in Bengal, each consisting of a commandant, two under-officers, a\r\nhundred men, and two light field-guns. Being well drilled, and\r\naccustomed to active movements, these parties were held in readiness to\r\nmarch off at short notice to any districts where a few resolute\r\ndisciplined men could overawe turbulent towns-people; and thus they held\r\nthe eastern districts in quietness without drawing on the regular\r\nmilitary strength of the presidency. The _Shannon_ naval brigade\r\nacquired great fame; the heroic Peel had made himself a universal\r\nfavourite, and the brigade became a noted body, not only for their own\r\nservices, but for their connection with their late gallant commander.\r\nWhen the brigade returned down the Ganges, the residents of Calcutta\r\ngave them a public reception and a grand dinner. Sir James Outram was\r\npresent at the dinner, and, in a graceful and appropriate way, told of\r\nhis own experience of the services of the brigade at Lucknow in the\r\nmemorable days of the previous winter. ‘Almost the first white faces I\r\nsaw, when the lamented Havelock and I rushed out of our prison to greet\r\nSir Colin at the head of our deliverers, were the hearty, jolly, smiling\r\nfaces of some of you _Shannon_ men, who were pounding away with two big\r\nguns at the palace; and I then, for the first time in my life, had the\r\nopportunity of seeing and admiring the coolness of British sailors under\r\nfire. There you were, working in the open plains, without cover, or\r\nscreen, or rampart of any kind, your guns within musket-range of the\r\nenemy, as coolly as if you were practising at the Woolwich target. And\r\nthat it was a hot fire you were exposed to, was proved by three of the\r\nsmall staff that accompanied us (Napier, young Havelock, and Sitwell)\r\nbeing knocked over by musket-balls in passing to the rear of those guns,\r\nconsequently further from the enemy than yourselves.’ Such a speech from\r\nsuch a man was about the most acceptable compliment that the brigade\r\ncould receive, and was well calculated to produce a healthy emulation in\r\nother quarters.\r\n\r\nThe authorities at all the stations were on the watch for any symptoms\r\nwhich, though trivial in themselves, might indicate the state of feeling\r\namong the soldiery or the natives generally. Thus, on the 10th of July,\r\nat Barrackpore, a chuprassee happening to go down to a tank near the\r\nlines, saw a bayonet half in and half out of the water. A search was\r\nthereupon ordered; when about a hundred weapons—muskets, sabres, and\r\nbayonets—with balls and other ammunition—were discovered at the bottom\r\nof the tank. These warlike materials were rendered almost valueless by\r\nthe action of the water; but their presence in the tank was not the less\r\na mystery needing to be investigated. The authorities, in this as in\r\nmany similar cases, thought it prudent not to divulge the results of\r\ntheir investigation.\r\n\r\nThe great jails of India were a source of much trouble and anxiety\r\nduring the mutiny. All the large towns contained such places of\r\nincarceration, which were usually full of very desperate characters; and\r\nthese men were rejoiced at any opportunity of revenging themselves on\r\nthe authorities. Such opportunities were often afforded; for, as we have\r\nmany times had occasion to narrate, the mutineers frequently broke open\r\nthe jails as a means of strengthening their power by the aid of hundreds\r\nor thousands of budmashes ready for any atrocities. So late as the 31st\r\nof July, at Mymensing, in the eastern part of Bengal, the prisoners in\r\nthe jail, six hundred in number, having overpowered the guard, escaped,\r\nseized many tulwars and muskets, and marched off towards Jumalpore. The\r\nEuropeans at this place made hurried preparations for defence, and sent\r\nout such town-guards and police as they could muster, to attack the\r\nescaped prisoners outside the station. About half of the number were\r\nkilled or recaptured, and the rest escaped to work mischief elsewhere.\r\nIt is believed, however, that in this particular case, the prisoners had\r\nno immediate connection with rebels or mutinous sepoys; certain prison\r\narrangements concerning food excited their anger, and under the\r\ninfluence of this anger they broke forth.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns actual mutiny, the whole province of Bengal was\r\nnearly exempt from that infliction during the period now under\r\nconsideration; regular government was maintained, and very few rebels\r\ntroubled the course of peaceful industry.\r\n\r\nBehar, however, was not so fortunate. Situated between Bengal and Oude,\r\nit was nearer to the scenes of anarchy, and shared in them more fully.\r\nSir Edward Lugard, as we have seen, was employed there during the spring\r\nmonths; but having brought the Jugdispore rebels, as he believed, to the\r\ncondition of mere bandits and marauders, he did not think it well to\r\nkeep his force in active service during the rainy season, when they\r\nwould probably suffer more from inclement weather than from the enemy.\r\nHe resigned command, on account of his shattered health, and his\r\nAzimghur field-force was broken up. The 10th foot, and the Madras\r\nartillery, went to Dinapoor; the 84th foot and the military train, under\r\nBrigadier Douglas, departed for Benares; the royal artillery were\r\nsummoned to Allahabad; the Sikh cavalry and the Madras rifles went to\r\nSasseram; and the Madras cavalry to Ghazeepore. Captain Rattray, with\r\nhis Sikhs, was left at Jugdispore, whence he made frequent excursions to\r\ndislodge small parties of rebels.\r\n\r\nA series of minor occurrences took place in this part of Behar, during\r\nJuly, sufficient to require the notice of a few active officers at the\r\nhead of small bodies of reliable troops, but tending on the other hand\r\nto shew that the military power of the rebels was nearly broken down—to\r\nbe followed by the predatory excursions of ruffian bands whose chief or\r\nonly motive was plunder. On the 8th a body of rebels entered Arrah,\r\nfired some shot, and burnt Mr Victor’s bungalow; the troops at that\r\nstation being too few to effectually dislodge them, a reinforcement was\r\nsent from Patna, which drove them away. Brigadier Douglas was placed in\r\ncommand of the whole of this disturbed portion of Behar, from Dinapoor\r\nto Ghazeepore, including the Arrah and Jugdispore districts; and he so\r\nmarshalled and organised the troops placed at his disposal as to enable\r\nhim to bring small bodies to act promptly upon any disturbed spots. He\r\nestablished strong posts at moderate distances in all directions. The\r\nrebels in this quarter having few or no guns left, Douglas felt that\r\ntheir virtual extinction, though slow, would be certain. He was\r\nconstantly on the alert; insomuch that the miscreants could never remain\r\nlong to work mischief in one place. Meghur Singh, Joodhur Singh, and\r\nmany other ‘Singhs,’ headed small bands at this time. On the 17th,\r\nCaptain Rattray had a smart encounter with some of these people at\r\nDehree, or rather, it was a capture, with scarcely any encounter at all.\r\nHis telegram to Allahabad described it very pithily: ‘Sangram Singh\r\nhaving committed some murders in the neighbourhood of Rotas, and the\r\nroad being completely closed by him, I sent out a party of eight picked\r\nmen from my regiment, with orders to kill or bring in Sangram Singh.\r\nThis party succeeded most signally. They disguised themselves as\r\nmutinous sepoys, brought in Sangram Singh last night, and killed his\r\nbrother (the man who committed the late murders by Sangram Singh’s\r\norders), his sons, nephew, and grandsons, amounting in all to nine\r\npersons—bringing in their heads. At this capture, all the people of the\r\nsouth [of the district?] are much rejoiced. The hills for the present\r\nare clear from rebels. I shall try Sangram Singh to-morrow.’ The\r\ntrunk-road from Calcutta to the upper provinces, about Sasseram,\r\nJehanabad, Karumnassa, and other places, was frequently blocked by small\r\nparties of rebels or marauders; and then it became necessary to send out\r\ndetachments to disperse them. As it was of immense importance to\r\nmaintain this road open for traffic, military and commercial, the\r\nauthorities, at Patna, Benares, and elsewhere, were on the alert to hunt\r\ndown any predatory bands that might make their appearance.\r\n\r\nAlthough Douglas commanded the district in which Jugdispore is situated,\r\nhe did not hold Jugdispore itself. That place had changed hands more\r\nthan once, since the day when Koer Singh headed the Dinapoor mutineers;\r\nand it was at the beginning of August held by Ummer Singh, with the\r\nchief body of the Behar rebels. Brigadier Douglas gradually organised\r\narrangements for another attack on this place. His object was, if\r\npossible, so to surround Ummer Singh that he should only have one outlet\r\nof escape, towards Benares and Mirzapore, where there were sufficient\r\nEnglish troops to bring him to bay. The rebels, however, made so many\r\nseparate attacks at various places in the Shahabad district, and moved\r\nabout with such surprising celerity, that Douglas was forced to postpone\r\nhis main attack for a time, seeing that Jugdispore could not be invested\r\nunless he had most of his troops near that spot. All through the month\r\nof August we hear of partial engagements between small parties of rebels\r\nand much smaller parties of the English—ending, in almost every case, in\r\nthe flight of the former, but not the less harassing to the latter. At\r\none time we read of an appearance of these ubiquitous insurgents at\r\nRasserah; at another at Arrah; at others at Belowtee, Nowadda,\r\nJugragunje, Masseegunje, Roopsauguty, Doomraon, Burrarpore, Chowpore,\r\nPah, Nurreehurgunje, Kuseea, Nissreegunje, and other towns and\r\nvillages—mostly south of the Ganges and west of the Sone.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to trace the operations in this province during\r\nSeptember. There was no rebel army, properly so called; but there were\r\nsmall bands in various directions—plundering villages, burning\r\nindigo-works, molesting opium-grounds, murdering unprotected persons\r\nknown or supposed to be friendly to the British, and committing\r\natrocities from motives either of personal vengeance or of plunder. Of\r\npatriotism there was nothing; for the peaceful villages suffered as much\r\nfrom these ruffians as the servants of the state. The state of matters\r\nwas well described by an eye-witness, who said that Shahabad (the\r\ndistrict which contains Arrah and Jugdispore) ‘is one of the richest\r\ndistricts in Behar, and is pillaged from end to end; it is what an Irish\r\ncounty would be with the Rockites masters of the opportunity.’ It was a\r\nriot rather than a rebellion; a series of disorders produced by\r\nruffians, rather than a manifestation of patriotism or national\r\nindependence. To restore tranquillity, required more troops than\r\nBrigadier Douglas could command at that time; but everything foretold a\r\ngradual suppression of this state of disorder, when October brought him\r\nmore troops and cooler weather.\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to the turbulent province of Oude—that region which, from\r\nthe very beginning of the mutiny, was the most difficult to deal with.\r\nIt will be remembered, from the details given in the former chapters,\r\nthat Lucknow was entirely reconquered by the British; that the line of\r\ncommunication between that city and Cawnpore was safely in their hands;\r\nthat after Sir Colin Campbell, Sir James Outram, and other generals had\r\ntaken their departure to other provinces, Sir Hope Grant remained in\r\nmilitary command of Oude; and that Mr Montgomery, who had been\r\nLawrence’s coadjutor in the Punjaub, undertook, as chief-commissioner of\r\nOude, the difficult task of re-establishing civil government in that\r\ndistracted country.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to take some notice of an important state document\r\nrelating to Oude and its government, its thalookdars and its zemindars.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer,[185] the two Houses of Parliament were\r\nhotly engaged in a contest concerning Viscount Canning and the Earl of\r\nEllenborough, which branched off into a contest between Whigs and\r\nConservatives, marked by great bitterness on both sides. The immediate\r\ncause was a proclamation intended to have been issued (but never\r\nactually issued) by Viscount Canning in Oude, announcing the forfeiture\r\nof all estates belonging to thalookdars and zemindars who had been\r\nguilty of complicity with the rebels. The Earl of Ellenborough, during\r\nhis brief tenure of office as president of the Board of Control, wrote\r\nthe celebrated ‘secret dispatch’ (dated April 19th),[186] in which he\r\ncondemned the proposed proclamation, and haughtily reproved the\r\ngovernor-general himself. It was a dispatch, of which the following\r\nwords were disapproved even by the earl’s own party: ‘We must admit\r\nthat, under these circumstances, the hostilities which have been carried\r\non in Oude have rather the character of legitimate war than that of\r\nrebellion, and that the people of Oude should rather be regarded with\r\nindulgent consideration, than made the objects of a penalty exceeding in\r\nextent and in severity almost any which has been recorded in history as\r\ninflicted upon a subdued nation. Other conquerors, when they have\r\nsucceeded in overcoming resistance, have excepted a few persons as still\r\ndeserving of punishment, but have, with a generous policy, extended\r\ntheir clemency to the great body of the people. You have acted upon a\r\ndifferent principle. You have reserved a few as deserving of special\r\nfavour, and you have struck with what they will feel as the severest of\r\npunishment the mass of the inhabitants of the country. We cannot but\r\nthink that the precedents from which you have departed will appear to\r\nhave been conceived in a spirit of wisdom superior to that which appears\r\nin the precedent you have made.’\r\n\r\nIt was not until the month of October that the English public were made\r\nacquainted with Viscount Canning’s reply to this dispatch. During the\r\ninterval of five or six months, speculation was active as to the mode in\r\nwhich he would view it, and the course he would adopt in relation to it.\r\nHis reply was dated ‘Allahabad, June 17th,’ and, when at length publicly\r\nknown, attracted general attention for its dignified tone. Even those\r\nwho continued to believe that the much-canvassed proclamation would not\r\nhave been a just one to issue, admitted (in most instances) the cogency\r\nof the governor-general’s arguments against the Ellenborough\r\ndispatch—especially in relation to the unfairness of making public a\r\nprofessedly ‘secret’ dispatch. The reply was not addressed to the earl,\r\nwhose name was not mentioned in it throughout; its address was to ‘the\r\nSecret Committee of the Court of Directors,’ in accordance with official\r\nrule; but the earl was responsible, and alone responsible, for the\r\ndispatch and the severe language it contained. The personal part of\r\nViscount Canning’s reply, the calm but indignant allusion to the\r\nungenerous treatment he had received, was comprised in the first six\r\nclauses, which we give in a foot-note.[187] He proceeded to notice the\r\nstrange way in which the Ellenborough dispatch almost justified the\r\nOudians, as if they were fighting for a righteous cause—quite legitimate\r\nin a member of the legislature, proposing a reconsideration of the\r\nannexation of Oude; but quite unjustifiable in a minister serving Queen\r\nVictoria, who was at that moment, rightly or wrongly, the real Queen of\r\nOude. Viscount Canning declined to discuss the policy which, two years\r\nearlier, had dictated the annexation; it was not his performance, nor\r\nwas he empowered to undo it when once done. But he felt it incumbent on\r\nhim to point out the disastrous effects which might follow, if the\r\nOudians were encouraged by such reasonings as those contained in the\r\nEllenborough dispatch. Speaking of the Begum, the Moulvie, the Nazim,\r\nand other rebel leaders in Oude, he stated that there was scarcely any\r\nunity of plan or sympathy of purpose among them; ‘but,’ he added, ‘I\r\ncannot think this want of unity will long continue. If it shall once\r\nbecome manifest that the British government hesitates to declare its\r\nright to possess Oude, and that it regards itself as a wrongful intruder\r\ninto the place of the dynasty which the Begum claims to represent, I\r\nbelieve that this would draw to the side of the Begum many who have\r\nhitherto shewn no sympathy with the late ruling family, and that it is\r\njust what is wanting to give a national character to her cause. An\r\nuncompromising assertion of our authority in Oude is perfectly\r\ncompatible with a merciful exercise of it; and I respectfully submit\r\nthat if the government of India is not supported in making this\r\nassertion, and in declaring that the recent acts of the people of Oude\r\nare acts of rebellion, and that they may in strict right be treated as\r\nsuch, a powerful temptation will be offered to them to maintain their\r\npresent struggle or to renew it.’\r\n\r\nThe governor-general’s defence of the proclamation itself we need not\r\nnotice at any length; the proclamation was never issued in its original\r\nform—the subject being left generally to the discretion of Mr\r\nMontgomery. The tenor of his reply may be thus briefly indicated—That he\r\nwent to Allahabad to reside, chiefly that he might be able personally to\r\ninvestigate the state of Oude; that he soon decided to make a difference\r\nbetween mutinied sepoys and Oudian rebels; that the latter should not be\r\nput to death for appearing in arms against the authorities, unless they\r\nhad committed actual murder; that the general punishment for Oudian\r\nrebellion should be confiscation of estates, a punishment frequently\r\nenforced against rebels in past years, both by the British and by the\r\nnative governments; that it is a punishment which in no way affects the\r\nhonour of the most sensitive Rajpoot or Brahmin; that it admits of every\r\ngradation, according to the severity or lightness of the offence; that\r\nit would enable the government to reward friendly thalookdars and\r\nzemindars with estates taken from those who had rebelled; that most of\r\nthe thalookdars had acquired their estates by spoliation of the village\r\ncommunities, at a time when they (the thalookdars) were acting under the\r\nnative government as ‘nazims’ (governors) or ‘chuckladars’ (collectors\r\nof government rents); that, as a matter of abstract right, it would be\r\njust to give these estates back again to the village communities; but\r\nthat, as there would be insuperable difficulties to this course, it\r\nwould be better to take the forfeited estates of rebellious thalookdars\r\nas government property, out of which faithful villages and individuals\r\nmight be rewarded.\r\n\r\nAnother reply, written by Viscount Canning on the 7th of July, was to\r\nthe dispatch of the Court of Directors dated the 18th of May. In that\r\ndispatch the directors, while expressing full confidence in the\r\ngovernor-general, courteously requested him to furnish an explanation of\r\nthe circumstances and motives which led him to frame the proclamation.\r\nThis explanation he most readily gave, in terms equivalent to those\r\nabove indicated. He expressed, too, his thankfulness for the tone in\r\nwhich the directors had written to him. ‘Such an expression of the\r\nsentiments of your honourable court would be to me a source of\r\ngratification and just pride under any circumstances; but the generous\r\nand timely promptitude with which you have been pleased to issue it, and\r\nthe fact that it contains approval of the past, as well as trust for the\r\nfuture, has greatly enhanced its value. Your honourable court have\r\nrightly judged, that in the midst of difficulties no support is so\r\ncheering to a public servant, or so strengthening, as that which is\r\nderived from a declared approval of the spirit by which his past acts\r\nhave been guided.’\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked that some of the European inhabitants of\r\nCalcutta, who had from the first placed themselves in antagonism with\r\nViscount Canning, prepared an address to the Earl of Ellenborough,\r\nthanking him for the ‘secret’ dispatch, denouncing the principles and\r\nthe policy acted on by the governor-general, lamenting the earl’s\r\nretirement after so brief a tenure of office, denouncing the Whigs, and\r\nexpressing a hope that the earl, whether in or out of office, would long\r\nlive to ‘uphold the honour and interests of British India.’\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to a brief narrative of the course of events in Oude\r\nduring July, August, and September.\r\n\r\nThe province, in the first of these three months, was in a remarkable\r\ncondition. Mr Montgomery, as chief-commissioner, intrusted with large\r\npowers, gradually felt his way towards a re-establishment of British\r\ninfluence. Most of the dependants and adherents of the deposed royal\r\nfamily belonged to Lucknow; and it was hence in that city that they\r\nrequired most carefully to be watched. In the provinces, the late king’s\r\npower and the present British power were regarded with about equal\r\nindifference or dislike. A sort of feudalism prevailed, inimical to the\r\nrecognition of any central authority, except in merely nominal matters.\r\nThere were rebel forces under different leaders at different spots; but\r\nit is doubtful whether any of them were fighting for the deposed king;\r\neach leader had an eye to the assumption of power by or for himself.\r\nEven the Begum, one of the king’s wives, was influenced by motives very\r\nfar removed from affection to her lord. Great as Montgomery’s\r\ndifficulties were, therefore, they were less than would have been\r\noccasioned by a concentration of action, a unity of purpose, among the\r\nmalcontents. He reorganised civil tribunals and offices in such\r\ndistricts as were within his power, and waited for favourable\r\nopportunities to do the like in other districts.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Hope Grant was Mr Montgomery’s coadjutor in these labours,\r\nbringing military power to bear where civil power was insufficient. In\r\nthe early part of the month he remained at Lucknow, keeping together a\r\nsmall but efficient army, and watching the course of events around him.\r\nLater in the month, however, he deemed it necessary to take the field,\r\nand endeavour to chastise a large body of rebels who were setting up the\r\nBegum in authority at Fyzabad. On the 21st he started off in that\r\ndirection, taking with him a force comprising the 1st Madras Europeans,\r\nthe 2d battalion of the Rifle Brigade, the 1st Punjaub infantry, the 7th\r\nHussars, Hodson’s Horse, twelve light guns, and a heavy train. It was\r\nconsidered probable that, on his way, Grant would relieve Maun Singh,\r\nthe powerful thalookdar so often mentioned, who was besieged in his fort\r\nat Shahgunje by many thousand rebels. This cunning time-server had drawn\r\nsuspicion upon his acts and motives on many former occasions; but as it\r\nwas more desirable to have him as a friend than an enemy, and as he had\r\nunquestionably earned the enmity of the rebels by his refusal to act\r\nopenly against the British, it was considered prudent to pay some\r\nattention to his present applications for aid. Grant and Montgomery, the\r\none as general and the other as commissioner, held possession of the\r\nroad from Cawnpore to Lucknow, and the road from Lucknow to Nawabgunge;\r\nit was hoped that Grant’s expedition would obtain command likewise of\r\nthe road from Nawabgunge to Fyzabad. These are the three components of\r\none main road which nearly intersects Oude from west to east; the\r\npossession of it would render practicable the gradual crushing of the\r\nrebel bands in different forts north and south of the road. The rebel\r\nleaders, about the middle of the month, were believed to comprise the\r\nBegum of Oude, her paramour Mummoo Khan, Beni Madhoo, Baboo Rambuksh,\r\nBihonath Singh, Chandabuksh, Gholab Singh, Nurput Singh, the Shahzada\r\nFeroze Shah, Bhopal Singh, and others of less note; they had under their\r\ncommand sixty or seventy thousand armed men of various grades, and forty\r\nor fifty guns. More than half of the whole number were supposed to be\r\nwith the Begum and Mummoo Khan, at Chowka-Ghât, beyond the river Gogra;\r\nand to these Sir Hope Grant directed his chief attention. Where Nena\r\nSahib was hiding, the British authorities could never definitely learn;\r\nalthough it was known that he was near the northern or Nepaul frontier\r\nof Oude. It was believed that he, as well as the Begum, was becoming\r\nstraitened for want of funds—appliances without which they could never\r\nhope to keep their rebel forces together.\r\n\r\nThe general, with his force from Lucknow, experienced no obstruction in\r\nhis march towards Fyzabad. He arrived at a point within fourteen miles\r\nof that city by the 28th of July, having passed on his way through\r\nNawabgunge—leaving the Rajah of Kupoorthulla to keep open his\r\ncommunications. His advance alarmed the rebel army which was at that\r\ntime engaged in besieging Maun Singh in Shahgunje (twelve miles south of\r\nFyzabad); it broke up into three divisions—one of which fled towards\r\nGonda; a second marched for Sultanpore on the Goomtee; while a third\r\nmade for Tanda on the Gogra. This precipitate flight shewed in a\r\nstriking way the dread felt by the insurgents of an encounter with Sir\r\nHope Grant; for their numbers are supposed to have been at least ten\r\ntimes as great as his. On the 29th, Grant entered Fyzabad, and there\r\nheard that a large body of rebels were escaping across the Gogra a mile\r\nor two ahead; he pushed on with cavalry and horse-artillery, but was\r\nonly in time to send a few round-shot into their rear. On the following\r\nday, Maun Singh, now delivered from beleaguerment, had an interview with\r\nhim. On the 2d of August, two of the three divisions of the rebel army\r\ncontrived to join in the vicinity of Sultanpore, where they again formed\r\na compact army of eighteen thousand men, with eleven guns.\r\nNotwithstanding the escape of the rebels, Grant’s undisputed occupation\r\nof Fyzabad made a great impression in the whole province. This place was\r\na centre of Mohammedan influence; while near it was the very ancient\r\nthough decayed city of Ayodha or Oude, one of the most sacred of Hindoo\r\ncities. Religious quarrels had often broken out between the two\r\ncommunities; and now the British shewed themselves masters alike over\r\nthe Mohammedan and the Hindoo cities.\r\n\r\nIt was a great advantage at this time that Hurdeo Buksh, a powerful\r\nzemindar of Oude, was enabled to give practical efficiency to the\r\nfriendly feeling with which he had regarded the English throughout the\r\nmutiny. At his estate of Dhurrenpore, not far from Nawabgunge, he\r\norganised a small force of retainers, which, with two guns, he employed\r\nin fighting against some of the neighbouring thalookdars and zemindars\r\nwho were hostile to British interests. Such instances were few in\r\nnumber, but they were gradually increasing; and to such agency the\r\nultimate pacification of Oude would necessarily be in considerable part\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nWhile Grant was encamped at Fyzabad, he made arrangements for routing\r\nsome of the rebel bodies stationed in places to the east and southeast,\r\nwhither they had fled on his approach. He made up a column—comprising\r\nthe 1st Madras Europeans, the 5th Punjaub Rifles, a detachment of Madras\r\nSappers, a detachment of the 7th Hussars, 300 of Hodson’s Horse, and a\r\ntroop of horse-artillery. With this force, Brigadier Horsford was\r\ndirected to proceed to Sultanpore, whither an important section of the\r\nrebels had retreated. Heavy rains prevented the departure of the\r\nbrigadier so soon as had been intended; but he set forth on the 9th of\r\nAugust, and was joined on the way by a small force from Lucknow,\r\ncomprising Brasyer’s Sikhs and two horse-artillery guns. On the 13th,\r\nHorsford took possession of Sultanpore, after a tough opposition from\r\nsixteen or eighteen thousand rebels; he not only drove the enemy across\r\nthe river Goomtee, but shelled them out of the cantonments on the\r\nopposite banks. The most determined of the combatants among the rebels\r\nwere believed to be those regiments of mutinied sepoys which had been\r\nknown as the Nuseerabad brigade; they had established three posts to\r\nguard the ghâts or ferries across the river, and held these ghâts for a\r\ntime with such obstinacy as to occasion them a severe loss.\r\n\r\nSultanpore occupied an important position in relation to the rest of\r\nOude; being on the same river (the Goomtee) as Lucknow, and on the high\r\nroad from Allahabad to Fyzabad. It was evident that this place, from the\r\nrelative positions of the opposing forces, could not long remain at\r\npeace. The rebels endeavoured to regain possession of it after their\r\ndefeat; while Sir Hope Grant resolved to prevent them. They returned to\r\nthe Goomtee, and occupied many villages nearly opposite the city. On the\r\n24th of August, Grant made preparations for crossing the river and\r\nattacking them. This plan he put in execution on the following day; when\r\ntwelve hundred foot and two guns effected the passage, and seized three\r\nvillages immediately in front. The rebels, however, maintained a\r\nposition from which they could send over shot into the British camp;\r\nthis lasted until the 29th, when they were driven from their position,\r\nand compelled to retire towards Sassenpore, where they reassembled about\r\nseven thousand of their number, with eight guns.\r\n\r\nThe first days of September found this body of rebels separating and\r\nrecombining, lessening and augmenting, in a manner that renders it\r\ndifficult to trace the actual movements. The real mutinous sepoys, the\r\n‘Pandies’ of the once mighty Bengal army, were now few among them; and\r\nthe fluctuating numbers were made up chiefly of the adherents of the\r\nrebellious thalookdars and zemindars of Oude—the vassals of those feudal\r\nbarons—together with felons and scoundrels of various kinds. On one day\r\nthey appeared likely to retire to Amethee, the stronghold of a rebel\r\nnamed Lall Madhoo Singh; on another, they shewed symptoms of marching to\r\nMozuffernugger, a place about ten miles from Sultanpore; while on a\r\nthird, some of them made their appearance at a town about twenty miles\r\nfrom Sultanpore on the Lucknow road.\r\n\r\nAt this time (September) the position of the British in Oude, so far as\r\nconcerned the possession of actual governing power, was very singular.\r\nThey held a belt of country right across the centre of the province from\r\neast to west; while the districts north and south of that belt were\r\neither in the possession of rebels, or were greatly troubled by them.\r\nThe position was thus clearly described by the Lucknow correspondent of\r\nthe _Bombay Gazette_: ‘The districts in our possession lie in a large\r\nellipse, of which Lucknow and Durriabad are foci, the ends of one\r\ndiameter being Cawnpore and Fyzabad. These cities are situated almost\r\ndue east and west. Our civil jurisdiction extends, on the average,\r\ntwenty-five miles all round Lucknow, and not much less round Durriabad.\r\nOur line of communication is uninterrupted from Cawnpore to Fyzabad,\r\nwhich latter borders on the Goruckpore district.’ North of this belt or\r\nellipse were various bodies of rebels under the Begum, Mummoo Khan,\r\nFeroze Shah, Hurdut Singh, and other leaders; while south of the belt\r\nwere other bodies under Beni Madhoo, Hunmunt Singh, the Rajah of Gonda,\r\n&c. Irrespective of these, were Nena Sahib and some of his relations\r\nwho, though not to be encountered, were known to be still in the\r\nnortheast of Oude, near the Nepaul frontier. Sir Hope Grant had\r\nimmediate control over both banks of the Goomtee, near Sultanpore, and\r\nwas preparing for a decisive advance against the rebels as soon as he\r\nwas joined by Brigadier Berkeley, who was sent from Allahabad on an\r\nexpedition presently to be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe portion of Oude nearest to Rohilcund, where the energetic Moulvie\r\nhad lately lost his life, was kept for a long time in a state of anarchy\r\nby a combination of rebel chieftains, who declared hostility against the\r\nRajah of Powayne for having betrayed and killed the Moulvie. They at\r\nfirst quarrelled a good deal concerning the possession of the effects of\r\nthe deceased leader; but the Begum put in a claim, which seems to have\r\nbeen acceded to. Although the authorities at Lucknow could not at this\r\ntime spare a force to rout out the insurgents on this side of Oude, the\r\nservice was rendered from Rohilcund, as will be shewn shortly.\r\n\r\nIn a district of Oude between Lucknow and the Rohilcund frontier, a\r\ngallant affair was achieved by Mr Cavanagh, who had gained so much\r\nrenown by carrying the message from Sir James Outram at Lucknow to Sir\r\nColin Campbell’s camp. Being appointed chief civil officer of the\r\nMuhiabad district, he arranged with Captain Dawson and Lieutenant French\r\nto defend the district from rebels as well as they could, by the aid of\r\na few native police and sowars. On the 30th of July a body of 1500\r\ninsurgents, with one gun, made a sudden attack on a small out-station\r\ndefended only by about 70 men. The place was gallantly held until\r\nCavanagh and French reached it. One bold charge sent the rebels fleeing\r\nin all directions; and the district was soon pacified. Mr Cavanagh had\r\nthe tact to win over several small zemindars to the British cause, by\r\nthreatening to punish them if insubordinate, and by undertaking to aid\r\nthem if they were attacked by rebel bands; they combined to maintain\r\nfour hundred matchlockmen at their own expense in the British cause.\r\nMany of the petty rajahs and zemindars had themselves been more than\r\nsuspected; but the civil authorities were empowered to win them over, by\r\nan indulgent forgetfulness of their past conduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Interior of Hindoo Rajah’s House.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn another side of Oude, near Allahabad and the apex of the Doab, there\r\nwere many bold and reckless thalookdars, who held out threats to all of\r\ntheir class who dared to profess friendship to the English. A loyal\r\nthalookdar, Baboo Rampursand Singh, was attacked by a number of these\r\nconfederated chieftains with their retainers at Soraon; they took him\r\nand his family prisoners, destroyed his house, and sacked the village.\r\nAs this course of proceeding would have deterred friendly thalookdars\r\nfrom a persistence in their loyalty, and still more certainly deterred\r\nwaverers from making a choice adverse to the rebel cause, means were\r\ntaken to check it. Brigadier Berkeley was placed in command of a ‘Soraon\r\nField-force,’ hastily collected, comprising 200 of H.M. 32d foot, the\r\n7th Punjaub infantry, about 150 other infantry, two troops of Lahore\r\nlight horse, a detachment of Madras cavalry, detachments of horse and\r\nfoot artillery, and nine guns and mortars. The brigadier set out for\r\nAllahabad, where the force had been collected, crossed the Ganges,\r\nmarched to the Oude frontier, and came in sight of a body of rebels on\r\nthe 14th of July, at the fort and village of Dehaign—one of the small\r\nforts in which Oude abounded. The rebels retired into the fort on his\r\napproach, allowing his skirmishers to take easy possession of the\r\nvillage. He encircled the fort with cavalry, and placed horse-artillery\r\nto watch any outlets of escape. A firing by heavy guns was not\r\nsatisfactory to him, owing to the fort being completely hidden by trees\r\nand thick scrubby jungle; and he therefore resolved on storming the\r\nplace by his infantry. The assault was speedily and thoroughly\r\nsuccessful. About 250 of the rebels were killed in the fort and ditch;\r\nand about as many more were chased through the jungle and cut down by\r\nthe cavalry and horse-artillery. The place was not properly a fort; it\r\nwas a large area of jungle surrounded by a dilapidated earthen wall and\r\nditch, and fenced with a thorny abattis, having a brick house in the\r\ncentre. The rebels being driven out, Brigadier Berkeley caused the\r\njungle to be cut, the walls to be levelled, and the house destroyed.\r\nAfter resting on the 15th, Berkeley proceeded on the 16th to the fort of\r\nTiroul, seven miles north of Soraon. He found this fort in the middle of\r\nan impenetrable thorny jungle, through which a few paths were cut in\r\ndirections known only to the natives; it was surrounded by a very thick\r\nthorny abattis; and it had walls, bastions, ditches, escarps, like a\r\nminiature fortress, with a stronghold in the centre to which the\r\ngarrison could retire when closely pressed. There were only three guns\r\non the bastions, but the walls were loopholed for musketry. So thick was\r\nthe belt of trees and jungle around, that the brigadier could scarcely\r\nobtain a sight of the fort; he therefore deemed it prudent to employ his\r\nmortars and a 24-pounder howitzer before sending in his infantry to\r\nassault. This succeeded; the enemy evacuated the place during the night,\r\nleaving behind them their three guns and gun-ammunition. The infantry\r\nwere on the alert to assist, but the enemy left them nothing to do. Fort\r\nTiroul was then destroyed, as fort Soraon had been. The former was\r\nrather a superior example of an Oudian fort; although the walls and\r\nbastions were only of earth, they were of such considerable thickness,\r\nand were aided so greatly by loopholed parapets, ditches, breastworks,\r\nrifle-pits, thorny abattis, zigzag intrenchments, and thick jungle—that\r\nthe enemy might have made a tough resistance to an infantry attack, if\r\nthey had not been frightened out by shells and balls. By a somewhat\r\nsimilar train of operations, Brigadier Berkeley captured and destroyed a\r\nfort at Bhyspoor; and having thus finished the work intrusted to him, he\r\nreturned with his temporary ‘Soraon Field-force’ to Allahabad. After a\r\nbrief interval, he was again sent forth, to demolish other Oudian forts\r\nat places accessible from Allahabad, of which one was at Pertabghur; and\r\nthen to advance to Sultanpore, to aid Sir Hope Grant. The two generals\r\nwould then command a semicircle of country, within which most of the\r\nrebels in the eastern half of Oude would be enclosed; and an advance of\r\nother columns from Lucknow would completely hem them in. There were many\r\nsymptoms, at the end of the month, that numerous zemindars and\r\nthalookdars were only waiting for a decent pretext, a decisive success\r\nof the British, to give in their adhesion.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Ganges nearest to the province of Oude, even so low\r\ndown as Allahabad, where the governor-general and the commander-in-chief\r\nwere residing, required close watching; they were infested by bands of\r\nrebels, some of whom devastated the villages, while others sought to\r\ncross the Ganges into the Doab; and carry mischief into new districts.\r\nTowards the close of July—to cite one among many instances—it became\r\nknown that the rebels had collected many boats on the Oude side of the\r\nriver, ready to cross over into the Doab if the fortune of war should\r\nrender this desirable. The authorities at once sent up the _Jumna_\r\nsteamer, with a party of 130 Sikhs and two guns. At Manickpore and\r\nKunkur, some distance up the river, they found more than twenty boats,\r\nwhich they succeeded in destroying; but the two forts were well armed\r\nwith guns and rebels, and could not be safely attacked at that\r\ntime—another and stronger expeditionary force was required to effect\r\nthis. In August, and again in September, small forces were sent up from\r\nAllahabad by river, which had the desired effect of checking these\r\ninsurgents.\r\n\r\nViscount Canning and Sir Colin Campbell both remained at Allahabad\r\nthroughout the period to which this chapter relates—where, indeed, they\r\nhad long been located. It was convenient for each in his special\r\ncapacity, owing to its central situation. Sir Colin needed to be\r\ninformed daily of the proceedings of all the brigades, columns, forces,\r\nand detachments which were out on active service. Gladly would he have\r\nkept them all under cover until the rainy season had passed; but the\r\nexigencies of the service prevented this: some troops were necessarily\r\nin the field—in Behar, in Oude, in Rohilcund, in Bundelcund, in the\r\nMahratta states, in Rajpootana; and these, whether their number were few\r\nor many, were all working to one common end. At no other city could Sir\r\nColin receive news from all those regions more promptly than at\r\nAllahabad. Again, Viscount Canning found it necessary to be in intimate\r\ncommunication with the commander-in-chief, in relation to all projects\r\nand arrangements involving military operations, on which the ultimate\r\npacification of India so much depended. It was desirable, also, that he\r\nshould be near Oude, the affairs of which were far more delicate than\r\nthose of any other Indian province. Many events were likely to arise,\r\nconcerning which the electric telegraph, though instantaneous, might be\r\ntoo curt and enigmatical, and which would be much better settled by a\r\npersonal conference with the chief to whom the government of the\r\nAnglo-Indian empire was consigned.\r\n\r\nOrders and dispatches, military and political, were issued in great\r\nnumber from Allahabad, which was the substitute for Calcutta at that\r\ntime. Much progress had been made towards the construction of a new\r\nEnglish town, with houses, hotels, offices, and shops; and much also in\r\nthe building of new barracks, for the English troops which must\r\nnecessarily continue to be stationed at this important place. The\r\ngovernor-general and the commander-in-chief were each surrounded with\r\nhis staff of officials, for the transaction of business; and both worked\r\nuntiringly for the public benefit.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Viscount Canning gave effect to several\r\nrecommendations made by the generals and brigadiers for an\r\nacknowledgment of the fidelity and bravery of native soldiers. At a\r\nperiod when the treachery of the ‘Pandies’ of the Bengal army had been\r\nproductive of such bitter fruit, it was doubly desirable to praise and\r\nreward such native troops as bore up well against the temptations to\r\nwhich they were exposed. On one day he issued orders for the promotion\r\nof certain officers and men of the Hyderabad Contingent, for conspicuous\r\ngallantry in the action at Banda; and in orders of subsequent dates,\r\nother well-deserving native troops were singled out for reward.\r\nRessaldars were promoted to be ressaldar-majors, duffadars to be\r\nressaldars or jemadars, bargheers and silladars to be duffadars, naiks\r\nto be havildars, and so on—these being some of the many designations of\r\nnative military officers in India. One of the higher grade of native\r\nofficers in the Hyderabad Contingent, Ressaldar-major Meer Dilawar\r\nHossein, was made a member of the First Class of ‘the Order of British\r\nIndia,’ with the title of ‘Sirdar Bahadoor.’ Sometimes towns themselves\r\nwere complimented, as a mode of gratifying the inhabitants, when good\r\nservice had been rendered. Thus Sasseram became the subject of the\r\nfollowing order: ‘As a special mark of the consideration of government\r\nfor the loyal services rendered by Shah Koobeeroodeen Ahmed of Sasseram,\r\nand his fellow towns-people, in repelling the mutineers, the Right Hon.\r\nthe Governor-general is pleased to confer upon Sasseram the name of\r\nNasirool Hook-Kusbah, “Sasseram the aider or supporter of the rulers.”’\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell’s[188] daily duties of course bore relation chiefly\r\nto military matters. On one occasion, while at Allahabad, he reviewed\r\nthe camel-corps as one of the reinforcements which from time to time\r\narrived at that place. This was towards the close of July. It was a\r\ncurious sight to see four hundred camels going through their military\r\nevolutions on the _maîdan_ or plain outside the city. These ungainly\r\nbeasts performed almost all the usual cavalry movements. Besides an\r\narmed native driver, each camel carried an English soldier, who occupied\r\nthe back seat, and was in a position to use his rifle. The camels had\r\nbeen trained to the word of command. On a recognised touch of the\r\nguiding-string, they dropped on their knees, the riflemen descended\r\nquickly, went on for a distance in skirmishing order, remounted on the\r\nrecall being signalled, and the camels then rose in their wonted clumsy\r\nmanner. This corps was likely to render very valuable service, by\r\nrapidly conveying a few skilled riflemen to distances and over tracts\r\nwhich would be beyond the reach of infantry.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief, a man indefatigable in the performance of his\r\nduties, acquired for himself the reputation of being a general who\r\ninsisted on all the duties of regimental service being properly attended\r\nto by the officers; to the effect that all alike should _work_ for the\r\ncommon cause, in camps and barracks, as well as in the field. The\r\nfollowing order, issued about the close of August, will shew how\r\nnumerous were the duties thus marked out: ‘The commander-in-chief begs\r\nthat general officers commanding divisions and brigades will urge\r\ncommanding-officers of her Majesty’s regiments, troops, and batteries,\r\nto give their most particular attention to all points of interior\r\neconomy; to examine and correct regimental books; to re-enlist soldiers\r\nof limited service willing to renew their engagements; to complete\r\nsoldiers’ clothing and necessaries, examine soldiers’ accounts,\r\nsoldiers’ claims, and small account-books; to close, and render to the\r\nproper departments, the accounts of deceased officers and soldiers; to\r\nexamine arms, accoutrements, and ammunition, and repair deficiencies; to\r\ncontinue judging-distance drills and musketry-instruction, as far as the\r\nclimate will permit; to provide occupation for soldiers without\r\nharassing them by mere routine drills; to consider their comforts, diet,\r\nand amusements; to re-establish the regimental school, and encourage by\r\nevery means the study of the Hindustani language, both by officers and\r\nsoldiers disposed to study it; to ascertain by inquiry what means exist\r\nin the neighbourhood of their quarters, both in materials and workmen,\r\nto furnish their regiments with boots and clothing, in the event of\r\nfailure of the usual supply; finally, to maintain the most exact\r\ndiscipline, the strict performance of all duties, and proper marks of\r\nrespect to officers; which will be much assisted by a proper example on\r\nthe part of officers, in dress and deportment, regularity in their\r\nduties, and treatment of native servants and followers.’\r\n\r\nThis last clause, ‘treatment of native servants and followers,’ related\r\nto a serious matter. Many of the younger officers, chiefly those whose\r\nknowledge of India had extended only over a few months, had acquired the\r\nhabit of speaking and writing of the natives as if they were all fiends\r\nalike, to sabre and hang whom was a pleasurable duty. The atrocities of\r\nsome were visited on all. The ‘Pandies’ who had begun the mutiny were\r\nnow mixed up with others in the common designations of ‘niggers’ and\r\n‘devils;’ and the officers above alluded to were far too prone to use\r\nthe stick or the whip on the shoulders of natives, simply because they\r\nwere natives, even when inoffensively employed. The observant\r\ncorrespondents of some of the London journals were too much struck with\r\nthis dangerous tendency to allow it to pass unnoticed; they commented on\r\nit with severity. The letters from officers, made public in the journals\r\npublished in India, furnished abundant proof of the feelings and\r\nlanguage adverted to, conveyed in their own terms. Unless the mutiny\r\nwere to end with general enmity on both sides, it was essential that an\r\nimproved tone should prevail in this matter; and to this end, many hints\r\nwere given by the authorities, in England as well as in India.\r\n\r\nA few words will suffice to say all that need be said concerning the\r\nDoab and Rohilcund, the regions in which the mutiny really commenced.\r\n\r\nRohilcund was troubled with nothing beyond trifling disturbances during\r\nthe month of July; and these came chiefly from Oude. Rebel leaders, with\r\nsmall bands of depredators, crossed the frontier, and harried some of\r\nthe neighbouring villages. So little, however, was there of an organised\r\nrebel army in the province, that the predatory irruptions were easily\r\nquelled by means of small detachments of troops. At one period in the\r\nmonth a body of Oudians crossed into the northern part of Rohilcund, and\r\ncombined with a rabble under one Nizam Ali in the wild Roodurpore tract\r\nof country. As it was considered possible that an attack on Pileebheet\r\nmight be contemplated, the authorities at Bareilly sent a small\r\nforce—comprising the Rohilcund Horse, a troop or two of Punjaub cavalry,\r\nand three companies of the Kumaon levies—to Pileebheet; this movement\r\ncaused the insurgents to retire quickly. In the neighbourhood of\r\nMohumdee, where much fighting had taken place during Sir Colin\r\nCampbell’s campaign in the spring, bands of rebels still hovered about,\r\nlooking for any chances of success, and requiring to be carefully\r\nwatched. One, of about four thousand men, was under Khan Bahadoor Khan\r\nof Bareilly; a second, under Khan Ali Nazim of Oude, numbered five\r\nthousand; and a third, under Wilayut Shah, mustered three thousand.\r\nThese, with twenty or thirty guns, might have wrought much mischief if\r\ncombined with the Oude rebels; but they were so placed on the frontier\r\nof the two provinces as to be nearly isolated, and afraid of any bold\r\nmovements. The authorities, however, were on their guard. A force,\r\nincluding De Kantzow’s Horse, was sent for the protection of Powayne;\r\nand Rajah Juggernath Singh, of that place, had about two thousand men\r\nwho could be depended upon to oppose the rebels. In August, the town and\r\nstation of Pileebheet were frequently threatened by one Kala Khan, who\r\nhad three thousand budmashes at his beck, with four guns. As it was\r\ndeemed necessary to defend Noria, a station about ten miles distant, a\r\nsmall force was sent out from Pileebheet to effect this. Kala Khan\r\nattacked the force at Sersown, and brought on an engagement in which his\r\nthree thousand were opposed to about five hundred. He received a severe\r\ndefeat, and lost his guns, three elephants, and a number of bullocks.\r\nThis occurred during the last week in August. In September, matters\r\nremained nearly in the same state; the authorities in Rohilcund could\r\nnot at once spare troops in sufficient number to put down the insurgents\r\nthoroughly; but the successes of Sir Hope Grant, in the central parts of\r\nOude, would gradually but necessarily weaken the isolated bands of\r\nrebels on the frontier of the two provinces.\r\n\r\nMeerut and Delhi had long been at peace. No symptoms of rebel armies\r\nappeared near those cities. Sir John Lawrence, having had the province\r\nof Delhi attached to his government of the Punjaub, was ruling it with\r\nthe same vigour as his other provinces. All the natives, Hindoo and\r\nMohammedan, saw that he was a man not to be trifled with. Many of the\r\nantiquated usages of the East India Company, in force in other\r\nprovinces, he abrogated, and introduced a system more suitable to the\r\nactual condition of the country and its inhabitants. The ‘regulations,’\r\nas they are called, he abolished altogether; and established in their\r\nplace a system of government in which summary trial by _vivâ voce_\r\nexamination was adopted. A military police was organised; and every\r\nvillage compelled to pay compensation for any damage done within its\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nThe district around Etawah was occasionally disturbed by a dacoit leader\r\nnamed Roop Singh, who collected a band of adherents, comprising a few of\r\nthe Gwalior Contingent, a few of the mutinied troops from Scindia’s own\r\narmy, and numerous matchlockmen from the ravines of the Jumna. With this\r\nmotley force he levied contributions from such of the villages as were\r\nnot strong enough to resist him. He made his appearance at Ajeetmul and\r\nother places early in July; but was speedily routed out by a small\r\ndetachment sent in pursuit. During August, this part of India was\r\ninfested by men of the same class as those who troubled so many other\r\nprovinces—reckless adventurers and escaped felons, who took advantage of\r\nthe state of public affairs to plunder villages, and make exactions on\r\nevery side. Some of them were headed by chieftains who could boast of a\r\nfew hundred retainers, and who, with retainers and rabble together, gave\r\nmore organisation to the plunderers. The principal among them was Roop\r\nSingh, mentioned above, who kept armed possession of a fort at Burhee,\r\nBhurree, or Burhay, at the junction of the Chumbul with the Jumna, and\r\noccasioned great annoyance by attacking boats and levying toll as they\r\npassed. To keep these several mischief-makers in subjection required\r\nmuch activity on the part of the troops belonging to the district.\r\nTowards the close of the month, a force was sent out from Etawah\r\npurposely to take this fort and disperse the rebels. This was\r\neffectually accomplished on the 28th. Suspecting what was intended, the\r\nrebels attempted to check the progress of the boats carrying the\r\ndetachment, at a place called Gurha Koodor, a fortified village three\r\nmiles higher up. So long as the troops were in the boats, the rebels\r\nmade a show of determination on shore; but a landing soon scattered them\r\nin all directions. The troops then re-embarked, floated down to Burhee,\r\nlanded, took possession of the fort, and compelled Roop Singh to make a\r\nhasty retreat. This done, they collected and secured all the boats in\r\nthe neighbouring parts of the rivers Jumna, Chumbul, and Kooraree, as a\r\nmeasure of precaution, clearing all the rebels from the vicinity of\r\nDholpore. They then proceeded against the chief of Chuckernuggur,\r\nanother leader of rebel bands whom it was necessary to put down. In\r\nSeptember, Etawah, like the other districts around it, was very little\r\ntroubled by warlike or mutinous proceedings.\r\n\r\nAgra found no difficulty in maintaining order in and near the city.\r\nWhen, in June, the temporary success of Tanteea Topee and the Gwalior\r\nmutineers gave some cause for alarm, the authorities of Agra sent out\r\ntroops to escort Scindia back to the capital of his dominions; and when,\r\nat a later date, those mutineers were fleeing from Gwalior, and were\r\nbelieved to be on the way to Bhurtpore or Odeypore, a detachment was\r\nsent out to check their approach. This detachment consisted of the 3d\r\nBengal Europeans and a battery of guns, and was placed in aid of\r\nBrigadier Showers’s force. The demonstration took effect; for (as we\r\nshall see more in detail presently), Tanteea Topee bent his steps\r\nsouthward, away from the threatened assault; and Showers was enabled to\r\nsend back the detachment through Futtehpore Sikri to Agra. From that\r\ntime, during the summer and autumn months, Agra and its neighbourhood\r\nwere at peace.\r\n\r\nDirecting attention next to the Punjaub, we may remark that those who\r\nhad the keenest sense of the value of loyal integrity in times of\r\ntrouble, were anxious to see the day when some recognition should be\r\nshewn of the services of three native rajahs, without whose co-operation\r\nit would scarcely have been possible for Sir John Lawrence to have sent\r\nthose troops from the Punjaub which enabled Sir Archdale Wilson to\r\nrecapture Delhi. These were the Rajahs of Putialah, Jheend, and\r\nNabah—three small states which were at one time included within Sirhind,\r\nthen among the ‘Sikh protected states,’ and then among the ‘Cis-Sutlej\r\nstates.’ The rajahs were semi-independent, having most of the privileges\r\nof independent rulers, but being at the same time under certain\r\nengagements to the British government. If they had swelled the ranks of\r\nthe insurgents, it is difficult to see how Hindostan could have been\r\nrecovered; for these states intervene between Lahore and Umritsir on the\r\none side, and Delhi on the other. From first to last the rajahs not only\r\nfulfilled their engagements, but more; and the government had abundant\r\nreason to be glad that these three territories had not been ‘annexed;’\r\nfor annexation, if not the cause, was unquestionably one of the\r\naggravations to mutiny. Viscount Canning, in July, rewarded these three\r\nSikh chiefs (for they were Sikhs, though not exactly Punjaubees) with\r\nestates and honours. The Rajah—or rather Maharajah, for he was of higher\r\ngrade than the other two—of Putialah received certain territories in\r\nJhujjur and Bhudour, on a certain military tenure in return for the\r\nrevenues. He also received the gift of a house at Delhi which, once\r\nbelonging to one of the begums of the imperial family, had been\r\nconfiscated on account of her complicity in the mutiny. Lastly, his\r\nhonorary titles were increased by the following: ‘Furzund Khan, Munsoor\r\nZuman, Ameer-ool-Omrah, Maharajah Dhurraj Rajahshur Sree Maharajah\r\nRajgan, Nirundur Singh Mahundur Bahadoor’—an accumulation, the weight of\r\nwhich would be oppressive to any but an oriental prince. The translation\r\nis said to be: ‘Special Son, Conqueror of the World, Chief of the\r\nChiefs, Maharajah of Rajahs’—and so on. The Rajah of Jheend received the\r\nDadree territory, thirteen villages in the Koolran Pergunnah, and a\r\nconfiscated royal house at Delhi. The additions were: That he be allowed\r\na salute of eleven guns; that his presents be increased from eleven to\r\nfifteen trays; that his state visits to the governor-general be returned\r\nby the secretary; and that his honorary titles be thus increased: ‘Most\r\ncherished Son of true Faith, Rajah Surroop Singh Walee Jheend.’ The\r\nRajah of Nabah received similar presents, and the honorary appellations\r\nof—‘Noble Son of good Faith, Berar Bunsee Sirmoor Rajah Bhurpoor Singh\r\nMalindur Bahadoor.’ The revenues made over to these rajahs amounted—to\r\nthe first, about £20,000 per annum; to the second, £12,000; to the\r\nthird, £11,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UMRITSIR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe may smile at these extravagances of compliment, but the services\r\nrendered deserved a solid reward as well as an addition to honorary\r\ntitles. For, it must be remembered, the Rajah of Putialah maintained a\r\ncontingent of 5000 troops—protected the stations of Umballa and Kurnaul\r\nat the outbreak of the mutiny—guarded the grand trunk-road from Kurnaul\r\nto Phillour, keeping it open for the passage of British and Punjaub\r\ntroops—co-operated with General Van Cortlandt in Hissar—lent money when\r\nSir John Lawrence’s coffers were running low—and encouraged others by\r\nhis own unswerving loyalty. Again: the Rajah of Jheend, whose contingent\r\nwas very small, did not hesitate to leave his own territory undefended,\r\nand march towards Delhi—assisting to defend most of the stations between\r\nthat city and Kurnaul, and to keep open the communication across the\r\nJumna. Again: the Rajah of Nabah, at the very outset of the\r\ndisturbances, proceeded to aid Mr Commissioner Barnes in maintaining\r\nLoodianah—supplied an escort for the siege-train—gallantly opposed the\r\nJullundur mutineers—provided carriage for stores—and made loans to the\r\nPunjaub government in a time of monetary need. The districts given to\r\nthese rajahs, at the suggestion of Sir John Lawrence, were so chosen as\r\nto furnish a prudent barrier of Sikhs between turbulent Mohammedans on\r\nthe one side and equally turbulent Rajpoots on the other.\r\n\r\nNor did the authorities neglect to recognise the services of humbler\r\npersons, although, principally from the proverbial slowness of official\r\nmovements, the recognition was often delayed to an unreasonable extent.\r\nOccasion has more than once presented itself, in former chapters, for\r\nnoticing the bestowal of the much-prized Victoria Cross on officers and\r\nsoldiers who had distinguished themselves by acts of personal valour.\r\nOwing to the dilatory official routine just adverted to, it was not\r\nuntil the 27th of July that Sergeant Smith and Bugler Hawthorne received\r\nthe Victoria Cross for their intrepid services at the siege of Delhi ten\r\nmonths before. Their regiment, the 52d foot, was at Sealkote in the\r\nPunjaub on that date; and Brigadier Stisted had the pleasure of giving\r\nthe honouring insignia to them. He told them that the Victoria Cross is\r\nin reality more honourable than the Order of the Bath, seeing that no\r\none can obtain it except by virtue of well-authenticated acts of\r\nheroism. He gracefully admitted that his own Order of the Bath was due\r\nmore to the pluck and bravery of his men than to his own individual\r\nservices; and in reference to the Victoria Cross he added: ‘I only wish\r\nI had it myself.’ Another bestowal of this honour we will briefly\r\nmention, to shew what kind of spirit is to be found within the breasts\r\nof British troops. The award of the Cross, in this instance, was delayed\r\nno less than fourteen months after the achievement for which it was\r\ngiven; and the soldier may well have doubted whether he would ever\r\nreceive it. The instance was that of Gunner William Connolly, of the\r\nBengal horse-artillery; and the conduct for which his officer,\r\nLieutenant Cookes, recommended him for this distinction, was recorded in\r\na dispatch from which an extract is here given in a foot-note.[189]\r\n\r\nA very unexpected event, in July, was the revolt of a regiment, or a\r\nportion of a regiment, in that region of India which was believed to be\r\nmore vigorously governed and in better hands than any other—the Punjaub.\r\nThe facts, as they afterwards came out (mostly, however, on hearsay\r\nevidence), appear to have been nearly as follow: The 18th Punjaub\r\ninfantry, stationed at Dera Ismael Khan, on the western side of the\r\nIndus, contained among its numbers about a hundred Malwaie Sikhs, a\r\npeculiar tribe different from the other Sikhs of the Punjaub. These\r\nMalwaies planned a mutiny. On a particular night, some of them were to\r\nmurder the officers of the station; the fort was to be seized; and the\r\n39th Bengal native infantry, which had been disarmed some time\r\npreviously, was to be re-armed from the magazines and stores of the\r\nfort. The two regiments of mutineers, perhaps joined by the Sikhs of\r\nRenny’s regiment at Bunnoo, were then to embark in boats on the Indus,\r\ntaking with them the guns, ammunition, and treasure, and were to float\r\ndown to Dera Ghazee Khan; here they expected to be joined by the native\r\ngarrison, with whom they would cross the Indus to Moultan; and lastly,\r\nwith two regiments from the last-named place, they hoped to march upon\r\nLahore. Such was the account, probably magnified in some of its\r\nparticulars, obtained of the plans of the mutineers. So far as concerned\r\nthe actual facts, the plot was discovered in time to prevent its\r\nexecution. On the evening of the 20th, Major Gardiner of the 10th\r\nPunjaub infantry, and Captain Smith of the artillery, having received\r\nfrom some quarter a hint of what was intended, went down to the lines at\r\nten o’clock at night, and summoned two of the men to appear. One, a\r\nsepoy, came first; he was ordered at once to be confined; but no sooner\r\ndid he hear the order, than he ran off. Just as the guard were about\r\nre-capturing this man, a jemadar rushed out, cut down one of them, and\r\nwounded another. The sepoy and the jemadar, who were the ringleaders in\r\nthe plot, escaped for a time, but were captured a few days afterwards.\r\nAs soon as Sir John Lawrence heard of this occurrence, he ordered the\r\ndisarmed 39th to be sent to Sealkote, where their movements could be\r\nmore carefully watched.\r\n\r\nStill more serious, in its nature if not in its intention, was the\r\noutbreak of the 62d and 69th Bengal native infantry, with a native troop\r\nof horse-artillery, at Moultan. These disarmed regiments, like many\r\nothers in similar plight, were a source of embarrassment to the\r\nauthorities. They could not safely be re-armed, for their Hindustani\r\nsympathies caused them to be suspected; while it was a waste of power to\r\nemploy English soldiers to watch these unarmed men in their lines. At\r\nlength it was determined to disband the two regiments, and let the men\r\ndepart, a few at a time, and under necessary precautions, to their own\r\nhomes. When this order was read out to them, they appeared satisfied;\r\nbut a rumour or suspicion spread that there was an intention of\r\ndestroying them piecemeal on the way. Whether this or any other motive\r\nactuated them, is not fully known; but they broke out into rebellion on\r\nthe 31st of August. There were at Moultan at the time about 170 of the\r\nroyal artillery, a wing of the 1st Bengal Europeans, the 11th Punjaub\r\ninfantry, and the 1st Bengal irregular cavalry. Just as the mid-day gun\r\nfired, the two disarmed mutinous regiments rose in mutiny, seized\r\nanything they could find as weapons, and made a desperate assault on the\r\ntroops at the station not in their plot. The 62d made their attack on\r\nthe artillery stables and the European barracks; the 69th went at the\r\nguns and the artillery barracks. As these mutineers had few weapons but\r\nsticks, their attack appeared so strange, and was so wholly unexpected,\r\nthat the loyal troops at the station were at first hardly prepared to\r\nresist them, and a few Europeans lost their lives; but when once the\r\nreal nature of the mad attempt was clearly seen, the result was fearful.\r\nThe misguided men were shot or cut down by all parties and in all\r\nquarters. Of thirteen hundred mutineers, few lived to return to their\r\nown Hindostan; three or four hundred were laid low in and near Moultan,\r\nothers were shot by villagers, others were captured and brought in for\r\nmilitary execution. It was the nearest approach to the utter\r\nannihilation of two regiments, perhaps, that occurred throughout the\r\nwars of the mutiny. The sepoys sometimes behaved more like madmen, at\r\nothers more like children, than rational beings. In the present case\r\nthey had scarcely a chance of success; for the Sikhs and Punjaubees\r\naround them displayed no affection for Hindustanis; the soldiery shot\r\nand cut them down, while the peasantry captured them for the sake of the\r\nreward offered. They possibly reckoned on the support of the 1st Bengal\r\nirregular cavalry; but this regiment remained loyal, and assisted in\r\ncutting down the sepoys instead of befriending them.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence strongly attracted the attention of the government. The\r\ndisarmed sepoys, as has been more than once mentioned, were a source of\r\nmuch perplexity; it was not decided in what way best to set them free;\r\nand on the other hand, such an outbreak as this shewed that it would not\r\nbe safe to re-arm them. There was at the same time a necessity for\r\nwatching the Sikh and Punjaubee troops—now nearly 70,000 in number.\r\nHitherto they had behaved admirably, fighting manfully for the\r\ngovernment at times and places where the Hindustanis had been\r\ntreacherous. That they had done so, afforded a justification for the\r\nconfidence which Sir John Lawrence had placed in them; but that\r\nsagacious man saw that recruiting had gone quite far enough in this\r\ndirection. It was just possible that the Punjaub army might become too\r\nstrong, and rejoice in its strength by means of insubordination.\r\n\r\nOne of the incidents in the Punjaub during the month of August related\r\nto a physical rather than a moral outbreak—the overwhelming of a\r\nmilitary station by a river torrent. The Indus, when about to enter the\r\nPunjaub from the Himalaya, passes through a narrow ravine in the Irhagan\r\nHills. The rocks on either side here, undermined by the action of the\r\nwater through unknown centuries, broke away and fell into the river.\r\nHalf the water of the stream still continued to find its way onward; but\r\nthe other half became dammed up, and accumulated into a vast lake. When\r\nthe pressure of this body of water had augmented to an irresistible\r\ndegree (which it did in fifteen days), it burst its barrier and rushed\r\ndown with indescribable force, sweeping away villages on its banks. At\r\nAttock the level of the river rose fifty feet in one hour, carrying away\r\nthe bridge of boats which constituted the only roadway over the Indus,\r\nand destroying workshops and timber-stores on the banks. The Cabool\r\nriver, coming from Afghanistan, and joining the Indus at Attock, had its\r\nstream driven backwards or upwards with fearful rapidity; it speedily\r\noverflowed its banks, and destroyed nearly all the houses at the\r\nmilitary station of Nowsherah. ‘The officers,’ said an eye-witness, ‘not\r\nknowing when it would stop, but hoping the flood would soon subside, put\r\nall their things on the tops of their houses; but the water still\r\ncontinued rising, and house after house went down before it.... The\r\nbarracks were flooded and vacated by the troops; and all, gentle and\r\nsimple, had to pass the night on some sand-hills.’ The barracks, being\r\n‘pucka-built’ (burnt bricks and mortar), were not destroyed, although\r\nflooded; the other buildings, being ‘rutcha-built’ (unburnt bricks and\r\nmud), were destroyed. The troops were at once removed to Peshawur; but\r\nthe destruction of the boat-bridge at Attock threatened a serious\r\ninterruption to military movements.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred in the Punjaub during September to need record here;\r\nnor did Sinde depart from its usual peaceful condition. Both of these\r\nlarge provinces, filling up the western belt of India from the Himalaya\r\nto the ocean, were held well in hand by the civil and military\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nAttention must now be transferred to those regions which, during many\r\nmonths, had been disturbed by anarchy and rebellion—Bundelcund, the\r\nMahratta States, and Rajpootana. These large territories contained many\r\npetty chieftains, among whom a considerable number were prone to seize\r\nthis opportunity to strengthen themselves by plundering their\r\nneighbours. Of patriotism, there was little enough; men appeared in arms\r\nfor their own interests, or what they deemed their own interests, rather\r\nthan for any common cause involving nationality or affection to native\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nBundelcund and the Saugor provinces were chiefly under the military\r\ncontrol of General Whitlock, who had advanced from Madras with a force\r\nconsisting chiefly of Madras troops, and had gradually established\r\nregular government in districts long troubled by violence and confusion.\r\nAt the end of June, as the last chapter shewed, Whitlock’s force was\r\ndivided into a great many detachments, which overawed the turbulent at\r\nas many different stations; and the same state of matters continued,\r\nwith slight variations, during the next three months. It must, however,\r\nbe mentioned here, in relation to military commands, that—as one mode of\r\nfacilitating the thorough discomfiture of the rebels—Viscount Canning\r\nmade a new arrangement affecting the Saugor and Gwalior territories.\r\nThat portion of India having been much disturbed during a period of more\r\nthan twelve months, it was determined to establish there two military\r\ndivisions instead of one, and to place in command of those divisions two\r\nof the generals who by hard fighting had become accustomed to the\r\ndistrict and the class of inhabitants. General Whitlock was appointed to\r\nthe Saugor division, which was made to extend to the Jumna, and to\r\ninclude the districts of Saugor, Jubbulpoor, Banda, Humeerpoor, and\r\nCalpee, with Saugor as the military head-quarters. General Napier was\r\nappointed to the Gwalior division, which was made to include Gwalior,\r\nSepree, Goonah, and Jhansi. This arrangement, organised about the end of\r\nJuly, was to hold good whether any rebels should make a sudden outbreak,\r\nor whether the troops were fortunate enough to have a period of repose\r\nduring the rainy season. Whitlock’s force, consisting of H.M. 43d foot,\r\nthe 1st and 19th Madras native infantry, with a proportion of cavalry\r\nand artillery—was mainly in two brigades, under Brigadiers Macduff and\r\nRice.\r\n\r\nBrief mention was made in the last chapter of a large capture of\r\ntreasure by General Whitlock. This matter must here be noticed a little\r\nmore fully, on account of its connection with the intricacies of\r\nMahratta dynastic changes. During the general’s operations in\r\nBundelcund, he marched from Banda towards Kirwee in two brigades,\r\nintending to attack Narain Rao at the last-named place. This chieftain,\r\na descendant of the Peishwa of the Mahrattas, possessed a rabble army,\r\nwith which for a time he attempted to block up the roads of approach to\r\nKirwee. The resistance made, however, was very slight; and shortly\r\nbefore Whitlock entered the place, Radha Govind, an adherent of Narain\r\nRao, escaped from the town in the opposite direction, taking with him\r\nmost of the armed men, and a large quantity of money and jewels, but no\r\nguns. Narain Rao, and another Mahratta leader named Madhoo Rao, remained\r\nat Kirwee. Their fears having been roused, they now resolved to\r\nsurrender as a means of obtaining forgiveness for their rebellious\r\nproceedings. They came out to meet Whitlock, at a camping-ground a few\r\nmiles from Kirwee. Delivering up their swords, they were kept securely\r\nfor a time. Whitlock took possession of the town and palace, and found\r\nthat the rebels had been busily engaged in casting cannon, making\r\ngunpowder, and enlisting men. In the palace and its precincts were\r\ndiscovered forty pieces of cannon, an immense supply of shot and powder,\r\ntwo thousand stands of arms, numerous swords and matchlocks,\r\naccoutrements of many of the rebel sepoy regiments, elephants and\r\nhorses, and a vast store of wealth in cash and jewels. It was\r\nconjectured that the jewels might possibly be those which, half a\r\ncentury earlier, had mysteriously disappeared from Poonah, and were\r\nsupposed to be in possession either of Scindia or Holkar, the most\r\npowerful of the Mahratta chiefs in those days; but the discovery now led\r\nto an opinion that the jewels had been stolen or appropriated by Bajee\r\nRao, father of Narain Rao, and hidden by that family for half a century.\r\nAs to the quantity and value of cash and jewels captured, it will be\r\nprudent to venture on no estimate. Some of the Anglo-Indian journals\r\nspoke of ‘a hundred and forty cart-loads of gold ingots and nuggets, and\r\nforty lacs of rupees,’ besides the jewels; but to whatever degree this\r\nestimate may have been exaggerated, the largeness of the sum gave rise\r\nto many inquiries concerning the history of the family to which it had\r\nbelonged, and of which Nena Sahib was an ‘adopted’ member. It then\r\ntranspired, that the first Peishwa of the Mahrattas, who died in 1720,\r\nwas succeeded by Balajee Rao Sahib; one of Balajee’s sons, Ragoba Dada,\r\ndied in 1784; and from him were descended Narain Rao and Madhoo Rao, by\r\none branch, and Nena Sahib by another—or rather, all these three\r\nindividuals were adopted sons of Ragoba’s descendants. According to the\r\nloose principles of oriental heirship, therefore, it was not difficult\r\nfor any one among several Mahratta princes to set up a claim to the\r\nenormous wealth which, at a time of discord at the Peishwa’s court,\r\nsomehow disappeared from the treasury at Poonah.\r\n\r\nThroughout India, there was no province which more strikingly\r\nillustrated than Bundelcund the misery which some of the villages must\r\nhave suffered during many months of anarchy, when predatory bands were\r\npassing to and fro, and rebel leaders were forcing contributions from\r\nall who had anything to lose. Writing early in July concerning the Banda\r\ndistrict, a British officer said: ‘This district has suffered very\r\nextensively in the long interval of disorder to which it was abandoned;\r\nthe various bands of mutineers passing up from Dinapoor did great\r\nmischief; various powerful villages preyed considerably upon their\r\nweaker neighbours; and, lastly, the Nawab and Narain Rao’s officials\r\nextracted by torture every farthing they could get. Many villages are\r\ncompletely deserted, and many more have been burned to the ground, and\r\nthe people plundered of all the grain and cattle and other property\r\nwhich they possessed. They have gained a very fair idea of what they are\r\nto expect under a native government; and I firmly believe they generally\r\nhail our return with delight.’\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of supplying English troops, or reliable native troops,\r\nto the numerous points where insurgents were known to be lurking, led\r\noccasionally to rebel successes little looked for by the authorities.\r\nThus, on the first of August, a party of mutinous sepoys, headed by a\r\nsubadar, took possession of the town of Jaloun, near the frontier of\r\nScindia’s territory; this they were enabled to do by the connivance of\r\nsome of the inhabitants, who opened the gates for them. They were,\r\nhowever, speedily driven out by a small force from Calpee, under\r\nBrigadier Macduff. A slight but brilliant cavalry affair occurred about\r\nthe middle of August, in a district of the Saugor territory placed under\r\nGeneral Whitlock’s care. A body of a thousand rebels, under Indur Goshun\r\nand other chiefs, had for some time been committing great havoc in the\r\ndistrict, plundering the villages, and ill-using all the inhabitants who\r\nwould not yield to their demands. After having thus treated Shahpoor,\r\nthey advanced to Garrakotah with similar intent. To prevent this, a\r\nsmall force was sent from Saugor under Captain Finch. He made a forced\r\nmarch; and when within a few miles of them, seeing his infantry were\r\ntired out, he rushed forward with only sixty-seven troopers. So\r\nimpetuous was the charge made by these horsemen on the rebels, that they\r\nkilled a hundred and fifty, took many wounded prisoners, and brought\r\naway three hundred matchlocks and swords. The leader of the rebels,\r\nIndur Goshun, was among the slain. In another part of Bundelcund,\r\nbetween Banda and Rewah, about the middle of August, were three groups\r\nof rebels—one under Baboo Radha Govind and Gulabraee, a second under\r\nRunmunt Singh, and a third under Punjah Singh and Dere Singh. They were\r\nsupposed to amount, in all, to six thousand men; but only three hundred\r\nof these were regular sepoys, and two hundred horsemen, the rest being\r\nadventurers and rabble. After ravaging many villages, they approached\r\nthe station of Kirwee on the 13th. Brigadier Carpenter at once went out\r\nto meet them with a small force from Kirwee; he found Runmunt Singh’s\r\nband drawn up as if for battle, but a few shots sent them fleeing. About\r\nthe same time Punjab Singh and Dere Singh were defeated by a small force\r\nunder Captain Griffin. Early in August, Captain Ashburner set out from\r\nJhansi with five hundred men, on the duty of dispersing a few Bundela\r\nchiefs who had been engaged in rebellious machinations. The weather\r\nbeing very heavy, and the rebels swift of foot, a long period elapsed\r\nbefore anything decisive could be effected; but on the 1st of September,\r\nhe came up with a body of rebels, occupying Mahoni and Mow Mahoni, two\r\nvillages on the opposite banks of the small river Pooj, both surrounded\r\nby deep and difficult ravines, which rendered them strong places. After\r\na little skirmishing, the rebels were driven by shot and shell out of\r\nMahoni, and Ashburner crossed to attack a fort at Mow Mahoni. Symptoms\r\nsoon appeared that the rebels were making off. Ashburner despatched\r\nfifty cavalry, all he had to spare at the moment, under Lieutenant\r\nMoore, to gallop after and cut them up in retreat. Moore effected this\r\nin dashing style.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to a region further west, in which the operations were more\r\nimportant than those of Bundelcund.\r\n\r\nReferring to former chapters for the details of Sir Hugh Rose’s victory\r\nover the Gwalior mutineers, and of his retirement to Bombay after a long\r\nseason of incessant activity; we proceed to notice the operations of the\r\ntroops after he parted company from them. His small but famous army, the\r\n‘Central India Field-force,’ was broken up into detachments about the\r\nmiddle of July. The hope entertained was, that the fatigued soldiers\r\nmight be able to go into quarters during the rainy season, as a means of\r\nrecruiting their strength for any operations that might be necessary\r\nwhen the cooler and more tranquil weather of the autumn arrived. To\r\nunderstand this, it may be well to bear in mind that the rains of\r\nBritain furnish no adequate test of those of India, which fall in\r\nenormous abundance at certain seasons, rendering field-operations,\r\nwhether for industry or war, very difficult. The detachments above\r\nadverted to could only in part obtain cessation of duties during the\r\nrainy season of 1858. At Jhansi were General Napier and Colonel Liddell;\r\nwith a squadron of the 14th Light Dragoons, a wing of the 3d Bombay\r\ncavalry, the 3d Bombay Europeans, the 24th Bombay native infantry, a\r\ncompany of Bombay Sappers, and three guns of the late Bhopal Contingent.\r\nAt Gwalior, under Brigadier Stuart, were three squadrons of the 14th\r\nLight Dragoons, Meade’s Horse, a wing of the 71st Highlanders, the 86th\r\nfoot, the 95th foot, the 25th Bombay native infantry, a company of\r\nBombay artillery, a company of royal engineers, and a light\r\nfield-battery. At Seepree, under Brigadier Smith, were two squadrons of\r\nthe 8th Hussars, two of the 1st Bombay Lancers, the 10th Bombay native\r\ninfantry, and a troop of Bombay horse-artillery. Lastly, at Goonah, were\r\nMayne’s irregular horse. Sir Hugh Rose himself was at that time at\r\nBombay receiving the well-won congratulations of all classes, and\r\nresting for a while from his exhausting labours.\r\n\r\nAt Gwalior, where the rainy season soon began to shew symptoms, General\r\nNapier made preparations for the comfortable housing of his troops. The\r\nMaharajah, now more firmly knit than ever in bonds of amity with the\r\nBritish, lent his aid in this matter. Sir Robert Hamilton again took up\r\nhis permanent residence in the city, gradually re-establishing political\r\nrelations with the various petty states around. During July there was\r\nscarcely any fighting in Scindia’s territory; and the component elements\r\nof the now-dissolved Central India Field-force were allowed to remain\r\npretty well at peace.\r\n\r\nBefore tracing the Central India operations of August, it may be well to\r\nsee what was doing in Rajpootana during July.\r\n\r\nAfter the siege and capture of Gwalior by Sir Hugh Rose, as we have\r\nalready narrated, the rebels made a hasty flight northwestward, across\r\nthe river Chumbul, into Rajpootana; where a victory was gained over them\r\nby General Napier, who had been despatched after them for that purpose\r\nby Sir Hugh Rose. They appear to have separated, after that, into three\r\nbodies. The most important section, under Tanteea Topee and Rao Sahib,\r\nreceived the especial watchfulness of General Roberts, as comprising\r\nsome of the best of the mutinied troops, and possessing a large amount\r\nof Scindia’s property. Roberts took up the work which Rose had laid\r\ndown. His ‘Rajpootana Field-force,’ now that detachments had been\r\nseparated from it for service in various quarters, was by no means a\r\nlarge one. It comprised H.M. 83d foot, a wing of the 72d Highlanders,\r\nwings of the 12th and 13th Bombay native infantry, a few squadrons of\r\nthe 8th Hussars and 1st Bombay Lancers, 400 Belooch horse, a light\r\nfield-battery, and a siege-train of six pieces. The chief body of\r\nrebels, under Tanteea Topee and Rao Sahib, made their appearance, a few\r\ndays after their defeat at Gwalior, at a point more than a hundred miles\r\nto the northwest, threatening Jeypoor. Roberts at once marched from\r\nNuseerabad, to check these fugitives. He reached Jeypoor without\r\nopposition on the 2d of July; and there he learned news of Tanteea’s\r\nmiscellaneous force of about ten thousand men. The rebel leader was\r\nreported to have with him Scindia’s crown-jewels and treasure, the\r\nformer estimated at one million sterling value, and the latter at two\r\nmillions. The treasure, being mostly in silver, was of enormous weight;\r\nand Tanteea had been endeavouring to exchange it for gold, on terms that\r\nwould have tempted any money-changer in more peaceful times: seeing that\r\nfifty shillings’ worth of silver was offered for gold mohurs worth only\r\nthirty shillings each. On the 5th Tanteea and his troops were at\r\nDowlutpore, thirty-four miles south of Jeypoor; and it thereupon became\r\na problem whether Roberts could overtake them before they reached the\r\nmore southern states of Rajpootana; for he was on that day at Sanganeer,\r\nnear Jeypoor. During the next few days, large bodies of rebels were\r\nseen, or reported to have been seen, at places whose names are not\r\nfamiliar to English readers—such as Chatsoo, Lalsoont, Tongha, Gureasa,\r\nKarier, Madhopore, Jullanee, Tonk, Bursoonie, Bhoomgurh, &c.—all\r\nsituated in the northeast part of Rajpootana, and separated from the\r\nGwalior region by the river Chumbul. We also find that General Roberts\r\nmarched through or halted at many places whose names are equally\r\nunfamiliar—Sherdoss, Gurbroassa, Glooloussee, Donghur, Kukkor, Rumpore,\r\nand Bhugree. In fact, the rebels marched wherever they thought they\r\ncould capture a stronghold which might serve them as a citadel; while\r\nRoberts tried every means to intercept them in their progress. On the\r\n9th, the rebels took possession of the town of Tonk—situated on the\r\nriver Bunnas, nearly due east of Nuseerabad, and about one-third of the\r\ndistance from that station to Gwalior; they plundered it, captured three\r\nbrass guns and a little ammunition, and besieged the Nawab in the\r\nneighbouring fort of Bhoomgurh. Roberts immediately sent on a detachment\r\nunder Major Holmes, in advance of his main force; and the enemy hastily\r\ndeparted as soon as they heard of this. To enable him to keep up the\r\npursuit more effectually, the general sent to Seepree for Colonel\r\nSmith’s brigade. There was strong reason to suspect that the rebels\r\nwished to penetrate into Mewar and Malwah, provinces far to the south of\r\nGwalior and Jeypoor, and in which the Mahrattas and Rajpoots counted\r\nmany leaders who were ripe for mischief. To prevent this southward\r\nprogress was one of the objects which General Roberts held well in view;\r\nthis was the more necessary, because the country here indicated affords\r\nmany mountain fastnesses from which it would be difficult to expel\r\ninsurgent bands. Roberts was disappointed in not being able to come up\r\nwith the Gwalior rebels at Tonk; but a few days’ sojourn at that town\r\ngreatly relieved his troops, who had suffered severely during a\r\nfortnight’s marching in sultry weather, losing many of their number by\r\nsun-stroke.\r\n\r\nBy the 23d of the month, when Major Holmes was still in pursuit of the\r\nenemy, who were reported to be approaching the fortress of Mandulghur in\r\nMewar, Roberts broke up his temporary camp at Tonk, and recrossed the\r\nriver Bunnas—his movements being greatly retarded by the swollen state\r\nof the stream and the swampy condition of the fields and roads. After\r\nwading for a whole week through an almost continuous slimy swamp, he\r\ncame within twenty-four miles of Nuseerabad on the 1st of August.\r\nSending all his sick to that station, he prepared to continue a pursuit\r\nof Tanteea Topee towards the south, with as great a rapidity as the\r\nstate of the country would permit.\r\n\r\nWe now turn again to the Gwalior territory, to trace such operations as\r\ntook place in the month of August.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month, there were no fewer than five detachments\r\nof the late Central India Field-force marching about the country on and\r\nnear the confines of Scindia’s Gwalior territory. Sir Hugh Rose’s wish\r\nand expectation, that his exhausted troops would be able to remain\r\nquietly at quarters during the rainy season, were not realised; the\r\nstate of affairs rendered active service still necessary. One\r\ndetachment, under General Napier, had set out from Gwalior, and was on\r\nthe way to Paoree, on an expedition presently to be mentioned; a second\r\nwas at Burwa Saugor, on the river Betwah; a third at Nota, sixty miles\r\nfrom Jhansi, on the Calpee road; a fourth at Fyzabad (one of many places\r\nof that name), fifty miles from Jhansi on the Saugor road; and a fifth,\r\nconsisting of Sappers and Miners, were preparing a bridge over the\r\nBetwah, ten miles from Jhansi. Colonel Liddell, at that period\r\ncommandant of the Jhansi district, was on the alert to supply small\r\ndetachments of troops to such places in the vicinity as appeared to need\r\nprotection; and he himself started off to Burwa Saugor, near which place\r\na rebel chieftain was marching about with three thousand men and two or\r\nthree guns.\r\n\r\nA circumstance occurred, early in August, which led to an expedition in\r\na new direction, and to an eventual co-operation of General Napier with\r\nGeneral Roberts in a pursuit of the rebels. This occurrence was an\r\noutbreak which required immediate attention. A petty Mahratta chieftain,\r\nMan Singh (not Maun Singh of Oude), who had conceived himself aggrieved\r\nby Scindia, put himself at the head of 2000 men, and on the 3d of the\r\nmonth, attacked and captured the strong fort of Paoree, southwest of\r\nGwalior, and about eighteen miles from Seepree. Brigadier Smith, on\r\nhearing of this, started off on the 5th from the last-named station,\r\nwith a force consisting of four squadrons of the 8th Hussars, the 1st\r\nBombay Lancers, a wing of H.M. 95th foot, and three field-guns. On\r\nnearing Paoree, Man Singh sent a messenger to inquire what was the\r\npurpose of the brigadier, seeing that the quarrel was with Scindia and\r\nnot with the English; he obtained an interview, and stated that his\r\ngrievance arose from the refusal of Scindia to recognise his (Man\r\nSingh’s) right to succeed his father in the principality of Nerwar and\r\nthe country adjacent; and he further declared that he had no connection\r\nwith the mutineers and rebels who were fighting against the English.\r\nBrigadier Smith, responsible for a time for the peace of that district,\r\ncould not admit such a plea in justification of the maintenance of an\r\narmed force against the sovereign of the country; it would have been\r\ndangerous. Man Singh, thereupon, increasing the number of his retainers\r\nwithin the fort of Paoree to three or four thousand, prepared to defend\r\nhimself. Scindia had some time before stored the fort with six months’\r\nprovisions, in case he should deem it at any time necessary to defend\r\nthe place from the rebels; but this proved to be an unlucky precaution,\r\nfor Man Singh captured the place in a single night, and then had the six\r\nmonths’ supplies to count upon. Brigadier Smith, finding his eleven\r\nhundred men too few to capture the fort, sent to Gwalior for a\r\nreinforcement and for a few siege-guns. In accordance with this\r\nrequisition, a force of about 600 horse and foot, with five guns and\r\nfour mortars, set out from Gwalior on the 11th. General Napier, feeling\r\nthe importance of settling this matter quickly, resolved to attend to it\r\nin person; he started from Gwalior, reached Mahona on the 14th, and\r\nSeepree on the 17th, and joined Smith on the 19th. On the 23d, this\r\ndemonstration had its effect on Man Singh, who, with another chieftain,\r\nAjheet Singh, had been holding Paoree. Napier poured a vertical fire\r\ninto the fort for twenty-four hours, and then commenced using his\r\nbreaching-batteries. But the enemy did not await the result; they\r\nevacuated the place, and fled through a jungle country towards the\r\nsouth. Napier entered Paoree, garrisoned it, and hastily made up a\r\ncolumn, with which Colonel Robertson started off in pursuit of the\r\nrebels. Robertson, after many days’ rapid march, came up nearly to the\r\nrear of Man Singh’s fleeing force; but that active leader, scenting the\r\ndanger, made his rebels separate into three parties, with instructions\r\nto recombine at an appointed place; and for the present pursuit was\r\nunavailable. When August closed, Man Singh was at Sirsee, north of\r\nGoonah, with (it was supposed) about sixteen hundred men, but no guns.\r\nGeneral Napier, having destroyed the fortifications at Paoree, and burst\r\nthe guns, retired to Seepree, where he was encamped at the end of the\r\nmonth, making arrangements for a further pursuit of Man Singh in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nWhile the forces in the Gwalior territory were thus employed, General\r\nRoberts was engaged in a more important series of operations in\r\nRajpootana. On the 1st of August, as we have seen, Roberts was\r\nsufficiently near Nuseerabad to send his sick to that station, where\r\nthey could be better attended to than on the march; while he himself\r\nwould be more free to make a rapid advance southward. Major Holmes, many\r\ndays before, had been sent from Tonk by Roberts, with a force consisting\r\nof 120 Bombay Lancers, 220 of H.M. 72d foot, four companies of the 12th\r\nBombay N.I., and four guns—to pursue the retreating rebels in a certain\r\n(or rather an uncertain) direction. The duty was a most harassing one.\r\nIt was difficult to obtain reliable information of the route taken by\r\nthe rebels; and even when the route was known, they never once allowed\r\nhim to overtake them—so rapid were their movements. So important was it\r\nconsidered to catch these Gwalior mutineers, that the Bombay government\r\n(with whom the operations in Rajpootana rested) sent out small\r\nexpeditionary forces from various places, according as probabilities\r\noffered for intercepting the mutineers. Thus, on the 1st of August,\r\nMajor Taylor started from Neemuch with a force, consisting of 300 of\r\nH.M. 72d Highlanders, 400 of the 13th Bombay N.I., 180 of the 2d Light\r\nCavalry, a few engineers, four guns, and a military train. It was\r\nbelieved that, on that day, about seven thousand of the Gwalior\r\nmutineers were somewhere between Chittore and Rampoora, a few miles\r\ndistant from Neemuch; and Major Taylor entertained a hope that he might\r\nintercept and defeat them. We have already seen that General Roberts had\r\nhad a most harassing duty, attended with very little success, seeing\r\nthat he could seldom manage to reach a town or village in which the\r\nrebels had halted, until after they had taken their departure; and it\r\nwas now Major Taylor’s turn to share the same ill-luck. He returned to\r\nNeemuch on the 7th, disappointed. His advance-guard had seen the rebels\r\nnear Rampoora in great force; yet the latter, though many times stronger\r\nthan himself in troops, would not stand the chance of an engagement. The\r\nrebels escaped, and Taylor returned with his mission unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JEYPOOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne advantage, at any rate, the British could count upon at this\r\nperiod—the fidelity of many native rajahs, who would have terribly\r\ncomplicated the state of affairs if they had joined the rebels. Tanteea\r\nTopee sounded the Rajah of Jeypoor, then the Rajah of Kotah, next the\r\nRajah of Ulwar, all of them native princes of Rajpootana; and it was on\r\naccount of the refusal of those rajahs to receive or countenance him,\r\nthat the rebel made such strangely circuitous marches from one state to\r\nanother. Whither he went, however, thither did Roberts follow him. The\r\ngeneral, after sending his sick to Nuseerabad, marched to Champaneer on\r\nthe 4th, and to Deolia on the 5th. At that time, it was believed that\r\nthe rebels, checked in some of their plans by the floods, had turned\r\naside from Mandulghur to Deekodee, in the direction of Odeypore. On the\r\n8th—after a forced march with 500 of H.M. 83d, 200 Bombay infantry, 60\r\nGujerat horse, and three guns—General Roberts came up with a body of\r\nrebels near Sunganeer (not Sauganeer near Jeypoor), where they occupied\r\na line on the opposite side of the river Rotasery. He speedily routed\r\nthem; but as usual, they fled too rapidly for him to overtake them; they\r\nmade towards the Odeypore road. Roberts, again disappointed of his prey,\r\nwas forced to rest his exhausted troops for a while.\r\n\r\nThe general, when Major Holmes had rejoined him after a fruitless\r\npursuit of the mutineers, again considered anxiously the conditions and\r\npossibilities of this extraordinary chase. He had, each day, to\r\nendeavour to discover the locality of the rebels, then to guess at their\r\nprobable future movements, and, lastly, to lay plans for overtaking or\r\nintercepting them. On the 11th, they were supposed to be at Lawah; and\r\non the 12th, they marched to the crest of the Chutterbhoog Ghaut, with a\r\nview of passing from Mewar into Marwar. Captain Hall, commanding at\r\nErinpoora, held a post at the foot of this ghaut, with a small force\r\nsufficient to deter the rebels. They thereupon changed their plan,\r\nretraced their steps to some distance, and marched over a rocky country\r\nto Kattara or Katario, a village near the Nathdwara Hills; here they\r\nencamped on the 13th. Meanwhile General Roberts, with his force\r\nstrengthened by that of Major Holmes, started from the vicinity of\r\nSunganeer on the 11th, and by the evening of the 13th had marched\r\nsixty-seven miles. On that night he was at Kunkrowlee, within eight\r\nmiles of the rebels; but his troops were too much exhausted to proceed\r\nfurther without a little rest. On the forenoon of the 14th he descried\r\nthe enemy defiling through a very hilly country covered with rocks and\r\nloose stones; he had, in fact, reached Kattara, the village mentioned\r\nabove. They took up an excellent position on a line of rocky hills, on\r\nthe crest of which they planted four guns, which they began to work\r\nactively. Roberts thereupon sent Major Holmes by a detour into that\r\nregion; for, even if the rebels were not overtaken, it would be\r\ndesirable to give them no rest to consolidate their plans. At length the\r\ngeneral had the gratification of overtaking and defeating these\r\ninsurgents, in search of whom he had been so long engaged. He advanced\r\nhis troops through the defile, his horse-artillery beating off the enemy\r\nuntil the infantry could form into line. After a brief period, the\r\nrebels shewed symptoms of retiring. On mounting the crest, the infantry\r\nsaw them endeavouring to carry away two of their guns with a small\r\nescort; a volley soon set them to flight, and rendered the guns an easy\r\ncapture. The flight soon became a rout; the rebels escaped in various\r\ndirections, and the victors came upon a camp covered with arms and\r\naccoutrements. The cavalry and horse-artillery followed the fugitives\r\nfor ten miles, cutting down great numbers. Roberts captured all the guns\r\nwhich the enemy had brought from Tonk, four elephants, a number of\r\ncamels, and much ammunition—with surprisingly little loss to himself.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time regarded, by some of the authorities, as a hopeful\r\nsymptom that the rebels were now descending to a part of India inhabited\r\nby Bheels and other half-civilised tribes, who would think much more of\r\nthe wealth than of the so-called patriotism of the mutineers. Most of\r\nTanteea Topee’s men were laden with silver coin, their share of the\r\nbooty from Gwalior; this cash they carried with them, although in food\r\nand clothing they were ill provided; and there was a probability that,\r\nif once they ceased to be a compact army, they would individually be\r\nrobbed by the Bheel villagers. Nevertheless, whatever may have been the\r\nhope or expectation in this respect, Roberts and his officers could\r\nnever intercept the treasure which Tanteea Topee was known to have with\r\nhim. This treasure, consisting of jewels and money (except the share of\r\nplunder distributed among the men) was carried on elephants; and so well\r\nwere those elephants guarded, whether during fighting or fleeing, that\r\nthe British could never capture them.\r\n\r\nFew of the troops in British service had had harder work with little\r\nbrilliant result than those in General Roberts’s Rajpootana Field-force.\r\nThe country is wild and rugged, the weather was rainy and hot at the\r\nsame time, and the duty intrusted to the troops was to chase an enemy\r\nwho would not fight, and who were celebrated for their fleetness in\r\nescaping. Hence it was with more than usual pleasure that the\r\nhard-worked men regarded their victory at Kattara; they felt they had a\r\nfair claim to the compliment which their commander paid them, in a\r\ngeneral order issued the day after the battle.[190]\r\n\r\nAfter the victory at Kattara, Roberts left the further pursuit of the\r\nrebels for a time to Brigadier Parkes. This officer had started from\r\nNeemuch on the 11th with a miscellaneous force of about 1300 men,\r\ncomprising 72d Highlanders, native infantry, Bombay cavalry, royal\r\nengineers, royal artillery, Bheels, and Mewar troopers. By a series of\r\nforced marches, Parkes headed the rebels in such a way as greatly to aid\r\nGeneral Roberts at Kattara. A few days’ sojourn having refreshed them,\r\nthe troops were again brought into action. Tanteea Topee, by amazing\r\nquickness of movement, traversed a wide belt of country eastward to the\r\nriver Chumbul, which he crossed near Sagoodar on the 20th. Continuing\r\nhis route, he arrived at Julra Patteen, a town on the main road from\r\nAgra to Indore; it was on the confines of the Rajpoot and Mahratta\r\nterritories, and was held by a petty chieftainess or Rana. After a brief\r\nconflict, in which he was assisted by a few of the troops of the Rana,\r\nwho broke their allegiance, he captured the place, levied contributions\r\non the inhabitants, and took possession of all the guns, treasure, and\r\nammunition he could find. Here, then, this extraordinary conflict took a\r\nnew turn; a new region had to be attended to, although against the same\r\noffender as before; and new columns had to be despatched in pursuit. The\r\nflooding of the river Chumbul cut off Roberts and Parkes for a time from\r\na further pursuit of Tanteea Topee; and therefore two new columns were\r\nsent, one from Indore under Colonel Hope, and one from Mhow under\r\nColonel Lockhart. The great point now was to prevent Tanteea from\r\ngetting into Malwah, and thence crossing the Nerbudda into the Deccan.\r\n\r\nBefore treating of the operations against this leader in September, it\r\nmay be well to see what progress was made in checking the rebel leader\r\nwho had appeared in Scindia’s territory—Man Singh. General Napier made\r\nup a new force, comprising certain regiments from his own and Brigadier\r\nSmith’s brigades, and placed it under the command of Colonel Robertson,\r\nwith baggage and vehicles so arranged as to facilitate rapid movement.\r\nSetting out from Paoree on the 27th of August, the colonel marched\r\neighteen miles to Bhanore; on the 28th, nineteen miles to Gunneish; and\r\nso on for several days, until he reached Burrumpore, near the river\r\nParbuttee. Here, on the 2d of September, he learned that a body of\r\nrebels, under Man Singh, were a few miles ahead, endeavouring to reach a\r\nfort which they might seize as a stronghold. Pushing on rapidly,\r\nRobertson came up with them on the 5th, near the village of Bujeepore.\r\nThey had not kept a good look-out; they had no suspicion that an active\r\nBritish officer was at their heels; consequently, when Robertson came\r\nsuddenly upon them with horse and foot, while they were preparing their\r\nmorning meal, their panic was extreme. They fled through the village,\r\nover a hill, across a river, and into a jungle; but the pursuers were so\r\nclose behind them that the slaughter was very considerable. These rebels\r\nwere nearly all good troops, from Scindia’s body-guard and from the\r\nGwalior Contingent; they were supposed to have been among the fugitives\r\nfrom Gwalior with Tanteea Topee, but at what time or in what locality\r\nthey had separated from that leader, and joined Man Singh, was not\r\nclearly known. About the middle of the month, Colonel Robertson was at\r\nGoonah; Brigadier Smith was searching for Man Singh; while General\r\nNapier was watching for any symptoms of the approach of the last-named\r\nleader towards Gwalior or its vicinity.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs were thus progressing in the Mahratta country during\r\nSeptember, new efforts were made to meet the existing state of things a\r\nlittle further to the west. When Tanteea Topee crossed the Chumbul\r\ntowards Julra Patteen, and when that river began to swell, General\r\nRoberts’s Rajpootana Field-force was unable conveniently to continue the\r\npursuit of the rebel; and, therefore, arrangements were made from the\r\nsouth. As a means of hemming in the rebels as much as possible, and\r\npreventing them from carrying their mischief into other regions, a\r\n‘Malwah Field-force’ was sent up from Mhow, under General Michel.\r\nTanteea Topee does not appear to have regarded Julra Patteen as a\r\nstronghold in which it was worth his while to remain; he plundered the\r\nplace of some treasure and many guns, and then took his departure. He\r\nmust, however, have wavered considerably in his plans; for he took a\r\nfortnight in reaching Rajghurh—a place only sixty miles distant. He was\r\nprobably seeking for any rajah or chieftain who would join his standard.\r\nAt Rajghurh, Tanteea Topee was joined by some of the beaten followers of\r\nMan Singh, probably by Man Singh himself, and seemed to be meditating an\r\nattack upon Bhopal. Tanteea and Michel were now both contending which\r\nshould reach a particular station first, on the Bhopal and Seronj road,\r\nas the possession of that station (Beora) would give the holder a\r\npowerful command over the district—especially as it was one of the\r\ntelegraph stations, by which Calcutta and Bombay held communication with\r\neach other. Michel came up with Tanteea Topee on the 15th of September,\r\nbefore he reached Beora. The rebels would not meet him openly in the\r\nfield, but kept up a running-fight. When they saw defeat awaited them,\r\nthey thought more of their elephant-loads of treasure than of their\r\nguns; they escaped with the former, and abandoned the latter, which they\r\nhad brought from Julra Patteen. At the expense, of one killed and three\r\nwounded, General Michel gained a victory which cost the enemy three\r\nhundred men, twenty-seven guns, a train of draught bullocks, and much\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of September, Tanteea Topee was in this remarkable\r\nposition. He was near Seronj, on the high road from Gwalior to Bhopal,\r\nlooking for any outlet that might offer, or for any chieftain who would\r\njoin his standard. Roberts was on the west of him; Napier, Smith, and\r\nRobertson were on his north; Michel, Hope, and Lockhart, on the south;\r\nand Whitlock on the east. Active he assuredly had been; for since the\r\nfall of Gwalior he and his mutineers and budmashes had traversed a vast\r\narea of the Rajpoot and Mahratta territories; but he was now within the\r\nlimits of a cordon, from which there was little chance of his ultimate\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nOf the other parts of India, it is scarcely necessary here to say\r\nanything. The course of peaceful industry had been little disturbed, and\r\nthe civil government had been steadily in the ascendant. All round the\r\nwest and south of Rajpootana did this state of things continue, and so\r\ndownward into the long-established districts of Surat, Poonah, Bombay,\r\n&c. It is well to observe, however, that even in the Bombay presidency,\r\nslight occurrences shewed from time to time that the leaven of\r\nHindustani ‘pandyism’ was working mischief. The safety of that army\r\ndepended on an admixture of different creeds and castes in its ranks;\r\nthere were in it Rajpoots and Brahmins, as in the (late) Bengal native\r\narmy, and these elements were sometimes worked upon by fermenters of\r\nmischief. Generally speaking, however, these, as well as the other\r\ncomponents of the Bombay army, behaved well. Their faithfulness was\r\nshewn in the month of August, in connection with a circumstance which\r\nmight else have been productive of disaster. Among the troops quartered\r\nat Gwalior after its reconquest by Sir Hugh Rose was the 25th Bombay N.\r\nI., containing, like other regiments of the same army, a small\r\nproportion of Hindustani Oudians. A non-commissioned officer of this\r\nregiment, a havildar-major, went to the adjutant, and told him that a\r\nBrahmin pundit, one Wamun Bhut, was endeavouring to tamper with the\r\nHindustanis of the regiment, and, through them, with the regiment\r\ngenerally; he also expressed an opinion that there were persons in the\r\ncity of Gwalior concerned in this conspiracy. Captain Little, when\r\ninformed by the adjutant of this communication, laid a plan for\r\ndetecting the plotters. He found Havildar-major Koonjul Singh, Naik\r\nDoorga Tewarree, and private Sunnoo Ladh ready to aid him. These three\r\nnative soldiers, pretending to bend to the Brahmin’s solicitations,\r\ngradually learned many particulars of the conspiracy, which they\r\nfaithfully revealed to the captain. A purwannah or written order was\r\nproduced, from no less a personage than Nena Sahib, making magnificent\r\npromises if the regiment, or any portion of it, would join his standard;\r\nthey were to kill all their officers, and as many Europeans as possible,\r\nand then depart to a place appointed. At length, on the 29th, the naik\r\nmade an appointment to meet the two chief conspirators, a Brahmin and a\r\nMahratta chief, under a large tree near the camp; where the\r\nhavildar-major would expect to have an opportunity of reading the\r\npurwannah. Captain Little, with the adjutant and the quartermaster,\r\narranged to move suddenly to the spot at the appointed time: they did\r\nso; the conspirators were seized, and the document taken from them. Two\r\nother leaders in the plot were afterwards seized: all four were blown\r\nfrom guns on the 7th of September; and many others were placed in\r\nconfinement on evidence furnished by the purwannah itself. It became\r\nevident that Nena Sahib, a Mahratta, had many emissaries at work in this\r\nMahratta territory, although he himself was hiding in inglorious\r\nsecurity far away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POONAH.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLord Elphinstone, governor of Bombay, with his commander-in-chief, Sir\r\nHenry Somerset, established several new corps, as means of gradually\r\nincreasing the strength of the Bombay army. Two Belooch regiments, a 2d\r\nregiment of South Mahratta Horse, and a Bombay Naval Artillery Brigade,\r\nwere among the new components of the army.\r\n\r\nThe South Mahratta country, lower down the peninsula than Bombay, had\r\nquite recovered from the disturbances which marked it in earlier months.\r\nSatara, Kolapore, Sawuntwaree, Belgaum—all were peaceful. On the eastern\r\nor Madras side of the peninsula, too, troubles were few. It is true,\r\nthere was a repetition in September of a dispute which had occurred\r\nthree months before, between natives who wished to bring up their\r\nchildren in their own faith, and missionaries who wished to convert\r\nthose children to Christianity; but this was a source of discord which\r\nthe governor, if firm, could readily allay. Lord Harris had not an\r\nIndian reputation like that of Lawrence or Elphinstone; but he had tact\r\nand decision enough for the duties of his office—the maintenance of\r\npeace in a presidency where there were few or no Hindustani sepoys.\r\n\r\nOf the large country of the Deccan, Hyderabad, or the Nizam’s dominions,\r\nnothing disastrous has to be told. A pleasant proof was afforded of the\r\ncontinuance of friendly relations between the British and the Nizam, by\r\na grand banquet given at Hyderabad on the 2d of July by Salar Jung to\r\nColonel Davidson. These two officers—the one prime-minister to the\r\nNizam, the other British resident at the Nizam’s court—had throughout\r\nthe mutinies acted in perfect harmony and good faith. All the British\r\nofficers and their families at Secunderabad, the cantonment of the\r\nHyderabad Contingent, were invited. The guests came from Secunderabad to\r\nthe Residency at Hyderabad, and thence on elephants and in palanquins to\r\nthe minister’s palace. The entertainment was in celebration of the birth\r\nof the Nizam’s son, Meer Akbar Ally, heir to the throne of the Deccan;\r\nand everything was done, by an admixture of oriental magnificence with\r\nEuropean courtesies, to render it worthy of the occasion. It was,\r\nhowever, not so much the grandeur of the banquet, as the sentiment it\r\nconveyed towards the British at a critical time, that rendered this\r\nproceeding on the part of the Nizam’s prime-minister important. The\r\nNizam’s dominions were at that time the scene of party struggles between\r\ntwo sets of politicians—the adherents of Salar Jung, and those of\r\nShumsul Oomrah; but both of the leaders were fortunately advocates of an\r\nEnglish alliance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HYDERABAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe northwest portion of the Nizam’s dominions, around Aurungabad and\r\nJaulnah, in near neighbourhood to some of the Mahratta states, was\r\ntroubled occasionally by bands of marauders, who hoped to establish a\r\nlink of connection between the anarchists of Hindostan and those of the\r\nDeccan. They were, however, kept in check by Colonel Beatson, who\r\nbrought his corps of irregulars, ‘Beatson’s Horse,’ to Jaulnah, there to\r\nremain during the rainy season—maintaining order in the surrounding\r\ndistricts, and holding himself ready to march with his troopers to any\r\ndisturbed region where their services might be needed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  To the officers’ hospital—_Calcutta Englishman_, _Bengal Hurkaru_,\r\n  _Phœnix_, _Illustrated London News_, _Punch_, _Blackwood’s Magazine_,\r\n  _Fraser’s Magazine_, _New Monthly Magazine_, _Monthly Army List_, four\r\n  copies _Chambers’s Journal_, four copies _Family Herald_.

The dispatch condemns in the strongest terms the proclamation\r\n  which, on the 3d of March, I directed the chief-commissioner of Oude\r\n  to issue from Lucknow.\r\n\r\n  ‘2. Although written in the Secret Committee, the dispatch was made\r\n  public in England three weeks before it reached my hands. It will in a\r\n  few days be read in every station in Hindostan.\r\n\r\n  ‘3. Before the dispatch was published in England, it had been\r\n  announced to parliament by a minister of the Crown as conveying\r\n  disapproval in every sense of the policy indicated by the\r\n  governor-general’s proclamation. Whether this description was an\r\n  accurate one or not I do not inquire. The telegraph has already\r\n  carried it over the length and breadth of India.\r\n\r\n  ‘4. I need scarcely tell your honourable committee that the existence\r\n  of such a dispatch, even had it never passed out of the records of the\r\n  Secret Department, would be deeply mortifying to me, however confident\r\n  I might feel that your honourable committee would, upon\r\n  reconsideration, relieve me of the censure which it casts upon me.\r\n  Still less necessary is it for me to point out that the publication of\r\n  the document, preceded as it has been by an authoritative declaration\r\n  of its meaning and spirit, is calculated greatly to increase the\r\n  difficulties in which the government of India is placed, not only by\r\n  weakening the authority of the governor-general, but by encouraging\r\n  resistance and delusive hopes in many classes of the population of\r\n  Oude.\r\n\r\n  ‘5. So far as the dispatch and the mode in which it has been dealt\r\n  with affect myself personally, I will trouble your honourable\r\n  committee with very few words. No taunts or sarcasms, come from what\r\n  quarter they may, will turn me from the path which I believe to be\r\n  that of my public duty. I believe that a change in the head of the\r\n  government of India at this time, if it took place under the\r\n  circumstances which indicated a repudiation on the part of the\r\n  government in England of the policy which has hitherto been pursued\r\n  towards the rebels of Oude, would seriously retard the pacification of\r\n  the country. I believe that that policy has been from the beginning\r\n  merciful without weakness, and indulgent without compromise of the\r\n  dignity of the government. I believe that wherever the authority of\r\n  the government has been established, it has become manifest to the\r\n  people in Oude, as elsewhere, that the indulgence to those who make\r\n  submission, and who are free from atrocious crime, will be large. I\r\n  believe that the issue of the proclamation which has been so severely\r\n  condemned was thoroughly consistent with that policy, and that it is\r\n  so viewed by those to whom it is addressed. I believe that that\r\n  policy, if steadily pursued, offers the best and earliest prospect of\r\n  restoring peace to Oude upon a stable footing.\r\n\r\n  ‘6. Firm in these convictions, I will not, in a time of unexampled\r\n  difficulty, danger, and toil, lay down of my own act the high trust\r\n  which I have the honour to hold; but I will, with the permission of\r\n  your honourable committee, state the grounds upon which those\r\n  convictions rest, and describe the course of policy which I have\r\n  pursued in dealing with the rebellion in Oude. If, when I have done\r\n  so, it shall be deemed that that policy has been erroneous, or that,\r\n  not being erroneous, it has been feebly and ineffectually carried out,\r\n  or that for any reason the confidence of those who are responsible for\r\n  the administration of Indian affairs in England should be withheld\r\n  from me, I make it my respectful but urgent request, through your\r\n  honourable committee, that I may be relieved of the office of\r\n  governor-general of India with the least possible delay.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  It may here be mentioned that, about the date to which these events\r\n  refer, the commander-in-chief began to be frequently designated by his\r\n  peerage-title. He had been created Baron Clyde of Clydesdale, in\r\n  recognition of his valuable military services. To prevent confusion,\r\n  however, it may be well, in the remaining pages of this work, to\r\n  retain the more familiar appellation, Sir Colin Campbell.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  ‘I advanced my half-troop at a gallop, and engaged the enemy within\r\n  easy musket-range. The sponge-man of one of my guns having been shot\r\n  during the advance, Gunner Connolly assumed the duties of second\r\n  sponge-man; and he had barely assisted in two discharges of his gun,\r\n  when a musket-ball through the left thigh felled him to the ground.\r\n  Nothing daunted by pain and loss of blood, he was endeavouring to\r\n  resume his post, when I ordered a movement in retirement. Though\r\n  severely wounded, he was mounted on his horse in the gun-team, rode to\r\n  the next position which the guns took up, and manfully declined going\r\n  to the rear when the necessity of his so doing was represented to him.\r\n  About 11 o’clock A.M., when the guns were still in action, the same\r\n  gunner, while sponging, was again knocked down by a musket-ball\r\n  striking him on the hip, thereby causing great faintness and partial\r\n  unconsciousness; for the pain appeared excessive, and the blood flowed\r\n  fast. On seeing this, I gave directions for his removal out of action;\r\n  but this brave man, hearing me, staggered to his feet and said: “No,\r\n  sir; I’ll not go there while I can work here;” and shortly afterwards\r\n  he again resumed his post as sponge-man. Late in the afternoon of the\r\n  same day, my three guns were engaged at a hundred yards from the walls\r\n  of a village with the defenders—namely, the 14th native infantry,\r\n  mutineers—amid a storm of bullets, which did great execution. Gunner\r\n  Connolly, though suffering severely from his two previous wounds, was\r\n  wielding his sponge with an energy and courage which attracted the\r\n  admiration of his comrades; and while cheerfully encouraging a wounded\r\n  man to hasten in bringing up ammunition, a musket-ball tore through\r\n  the muscles of his right leg. With the most undaunted bravery, he\r\n  struggled on; and not till he had loaded six times, did this man give\r\n  way, when, through loss of blood, he fell into my arms; I placed him\r\n  upon a wagon, which shortly afterwards bore him in a state of\r\n  unconsciousness from the fight.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  The major-general commanding has sincere pleasure in congratulating\r\n  the troops under his command on the great success achieved by them\r\n  yesterday. All have shewn most conspicuous gallantry in action; and\r\n  the patient unmurmuring endurance of fatigue during the recent forced\r\n  marches has enabled them to close with an enemy proverbially active in\r\n  movements. The horse-artillery and cavalry (the latter nineteen hours\r\n  in the saddle) have by their spirit and alacrity completed the\r\n  success, and inflicted a most signal punishment on the rebels. The\r\n  major-general tenders his hearty thanks to all, and doubts not but\r\n  their brave and earnest devotion will meet with the approval of his\r\n  excellency the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Government Buildings, Madras.—From a Drawing by Thomas Daniell.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n              LAST DAYS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY’S RULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demise of the great East India Company has now to be recorded—the\r\ncessation of functions in the mightiest and most extraordinary\r\ncommercial body the world ever saw. The natives of India never did and\r\nnever could rightly understand the relations borne by the Company to the\r\ncrown and nation of England. They were familiar with some such name as\r\n‘Koompanee;’ but whether this Koompanee was a king, a queen, a viceroy,\r\na minister, a council, a parliament, was a question left in a state of\r\nludicrous doubt. And no wonder. It has at all times been difficult even\r\nfor Englishmen, accustomed to the daily perusal of newspapers, to\r\nunderstand the relations between the Crown and the Company. Men asked\r\nwhether the Punjaub was taken possession of by the Queen or by the\r\nCompany; and if by the Queen, why the Company was made to bear the\r\nexpense of the Punjaub war? So of the war in Persia, the annexation of\r\nOude, the disastrous campaign in Afghanistan, the Burmese war—were these\r\noperations conducted by and for the Queen, or by and for the\r\nCompany?—who was to blame if wrong?—who to bear the cost whether right\r\nor wrong?—who to reap the advantage? Even members of parliament gave\r\ncontradictory answers to these and similar questions; nay, the cabinet\r\nministers and the Court of Directors disputed on these very points. The\r\nCompany was gradually shorn of its trading privileges by statutes passed\r\nin the years 1813, 1833, and 1853; and as its governing privileges had,\r\nin great part, gone over to the Board of Control, it seemed by no means\r\nclear for what purpose the Company continued to exist. There was a\r\nguarantee of 10½ per cent. on £6,000,000 of India stock, secured out of\r\nthe revenues of India—the stock to be redeemable by parliament at cent.\r\nper cent. premium after the year 1874; and it appeared as if the whole\r\nmachinery of the Indian government was maintained merely to insure this\r\ndividend, and to obtain offices and emoluments for persons connected\r\nwith the Company. The directors always disowned this narrow view of the\r\nCompany’s position; and there can be no doubt that many of them and of\r\ntheir servants had the welfare of the magnificent Indian empire deeply\r\nat heart. Still, the anomaly remained, of a governing body whose\r\ngoverning powers no one rightly understood.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolt began in 1857, the nation’s cry was at once against the\r\nEast India Company. The Company must have governed wrongly, it was\r\nargued, or this calamity would never have occurred. Throughout a period\r\nof six months did a storm of indignation continue, in speeches,\r\naddresses, lectures, sermons, pamphlets, books, reviews, magazines, and\r\nleading articles in newspapers. By degrees the inquiry arose, whether\r\nthe directors were free agents in the mode of governing India; whether\r\nthe Board of Control did not overrule them; and whether the disasters\r\nwere not traceable fully as much to the Board as to the directors? Hence\r\narose another question, whether the double government—by a Court sitting\r\nin Leadenhall Street, and a Board sitting in Cannon Row—was not an evil\r\nthat ought to be abolished, even without reference to actual blame as\r\nconcerning the Revolt? The virulent abuse of the Company was gradually\r\nfelt to be unjust; but the unsatisfactory nature of the double\r\ngovernment became more and more evident as the year advanced.\r\n\r\nThere was a preliminary or short session of parliament held in that\r\nyear, during a few days before Christmas, for the consideration of\r\nspecial business arising out of the commercial disasters of the autumn;\r\nbut as every one knew that India and its affairs must necessarily\r\nreceive some notice, the speech from the throne was looked for with much\r\neagerness. On the 3d of December, when parliament met, the ministers put\r\ninto the Queen’s mouth only this very brief allusion to projected\r\nchanges in the Indian government: ‘The affairs of my East Indian\r\ndominions will require your serious consideration, and I recommend them\r\nto your earnest attention.’ These vague words were useless without a\r\nglossary; but the glossary was not forthcoming. Ministers, when\r\nquestioned and sounded as to their plans, postponed all explanations to\r\na later date.\r\n\r\nThe first public announcement of the intentions of the government was\r\nmade shortly before Christmas. A General Court of Proprietors of the\r\nEast India Company was held on the 23d of December, for the discussion\r\nof various matters relating to India; and, in the course of the\r\nproceedings, the chairman of the Company announced that, on the 19th, an\r\nofficial interview had been held, by appointment, with Lord Palmerston.\r\nOn this occasion, the prime minister informed the Court of Directors\r\nthat it was the intention of the ministry, early in the approaching\r\nyear, to bring a bill into parliament for the purpose of placing the\r\ngovernment of British India under the direct authority of the crown. In\r\nthis interview, as in the royal speech, no matters of detail were\r\nentered upon. The members of parliament in the one assembly, the\r\nproprietors of East India stock in the other, were equally unable to\r\nobtain information concerning the provisions of the intended measure.\r\nAll that could be elicited was, that the ‘double government’ of India\r\nwould cease; and a written notice or letter to this effect was\r\ntransmitted from the First Lord of the Treasury to the Court of\r\nDirectors on the 23d.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of six or seven weeks between the preliminary and the\r\nregular sessions, the journalists had full scope for their speculations.\r\nThose who, from the first, had attributed the Revolt in India to the\r\nCompany’s misgovernment, rejoiced in the hoped-for extinction of that\r\nbody, and sketched delightful pictures of happy India under imperial\r\nsway. Those who supported the Company and vested interests, predicted\r\nthe utter ruin of British influence in India if ‘parliamentary\r\ngovernment’ were introduced—a mode of government, as they alleged,\r\nneither cared for nor understood by the natives of that region, and\r\nutterly unsuited to oriental ideas. Those, the moderate thinkers, who\r\nbelieved that on this as on other subjects the truth lies between two\r\nextremes, looked forward hopefully to such a change as might throw new\r\nvigour, and more advanced ideas, into the somewhat antiquated policy of\r\nthe East India Company, without destroying those parts of the system\r\nwhich had been the useful growth of long experience. Many things had\r\ntranspired during the year, tending to shew that the Court of Directors\r\nhad been more prompt than the Board of Control, in matters requiring\r\nurgent attention; and that, therefore, whatever might be the evils of\r\nthe double government, it would not be just to throw all the onus on the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nEarly in January 1858, on a requisition to that effect, a special Court\r\nof Proprietors was summoned, to meet on the 15th, for considering ‘the\r\ncommunication addressed to the Court of Directors from the government\r\nrespecting the continuance of the powers of this Company.’ At this\r\nmeeting, it transpired that the directors had written to Lord\r\nPalmerston, just before the Christmas vacation; but as no cabinet\r\ncouncil had been held in the interim, and as no reply to that letter had\r\nbeen received, it had been deemed most courteous towards the government\r\nto withhold the publication of the letter for a time. A long debate\r\nensued. One of the proprietors brought forward a resolution to the\r\neffect, ‘That the proposed transfer of the governing power of the East\r\nIndia Company to the crown is opposed to the rights and privileges of\r\nthe East India Company, fraught with danger to the constitutional\r\ninterests of England, perilous to the safety of the Indian empire, and\r\ncalls for the resistance of this corporation by all constitutional\r\nmeans.’ Many of the supporters of this resolution carried their\r\narguments to the verge of extravagance—asserting that ‘our Indian\r\nempire, already tottering and shaking, will fall to the ground without\r\nhope of recovery, if the East India Company should be abolished’—and\r\nthat ‘by means of the enormous patronage that would be placed in the\r\nhands of the government, ministers would possess the power of corrupting\r\nthe people of this country beyond the hope of their ever recovering\r\ntheir virtue or their patriotism.’ Most of the defenders of the Company,\r\nhowever, adopted a more moderate tone. Colonel Sykes, speaking for\r\nhimself and some of his brother-directors, declared: ‘If we believed for\r\none moment that any change in the present administration of the\r\ngovernment of India would be advantageous to the people of India, would\r\nadvance their material interests, and promote their comforts, we should\r\ngladly submit to any personal suffering or loss contingent upon that\r\nchange.’ He added, however, ‘By the indefeasible principles of justice,\r\nand the ordinary usages of our courts of law, it is always necessary\r\nthat a bill of indictment with certain counts should be preferred before\r\na man is condemned; and I am curious to know what will be the counts of\r\nthe indictment in the case of this Company; for at present we have\r\nnothing but a vague outline before us.’ Finally it was agreed to adjourn\r\nthe discussion, on the ground that, until the views of the government\r\nhad been further explained, it would be impossible to know whether the\r\nwords of the resolution were true, that the proposed change would be\r\n‘fraught with danger to the constitutional interests of England, and\r\nperilous to the safety of the Indian empire.’\r\n\r\nOn the renewal of the debate at the India House, on January 20th, the\r\ndirectors presented a copy of a letter which they had addressed to the\r\ngovernment on the last day of the old year. In this letter they said:\r\n‘The court were prepared to expect that a searching inquiry would be\r\ninstituted into the causes, remote as well as immediate, of the mutiny\r\nin the Bengal native army. They have themselves issued instructions to\r\nthe government of India to appoint a commission in view to such an\r\ninquiry; and it would have been satisfactory to them, if it had been\r\nproposed to parliament, not only to do the same, but to extend the scope\r\nof the inquiry to the conduct of the home government, for the purpose of\r\nascertaining whether the mutiny could, wholly or partially, be ascribed\r\nto mismanagement on the part of the court acting under the control of\r\nthe Board of Commissioners. But it has surprised the court to hear that\r\nher Majesty’s government—not imputing, so far as the court are informed,\r\nany blame to the home authorities in connection with the mutiny, and\r\nwithout intending any inquiry by parliament, or awaiting the result of\r\ninquiry by the local government—should, even before the mutiny was\r\nquelled, and whilst considerable excitement prevailed throughout India,\r\ndetermine to propose the immediate supersession of the authority of the\r\nEast India Company; who are entitled, at least, to the credit of having\r\nso administered the government of India, that the heads of all the\r\nnative states, and the mass of the population, amid the excitements of a\r\nmutinous soldiery inflamed by unfounded apprehension of danger to their\r\nreligion, have remained true to the Company’s rule. The court would fail\r\nin their duty to your lordship and to the country if they did not\r\nexpress their serious apprehension that so important a change will be\r\nmisunderstood by the people of India.’ This letter failed to elicit any\r\nexplanatory response from the government. Lord Palmerston, in a reply\r\ndated January 18th, after assuring the directors that their observations\r\nwould be duly considered by the government, simply added: ‘I forbear\r\nfrom entering at present into any examination of those observations and\r\nopinions; first, because any correspondence with you on such matters\r\nwould be most conveniently carried on through the usual official channel\r\nof the president of the Board of Control; and, secondly, because the\r\ngrounds on which the intentions of her Majesty’s government have been\r\nformed, and the detailed arrangements of the measure which they mean to\r\npropose, will best be explained when that measure shall be submitted to\r\nthe consideration of parliament.’ The directors about the same time\r\nprepared a petition to both Houses of Parliament, explanatory of the\r\nreasons which induced them to deprecate any sudden transference of\r\ngoverning power from the Company to the Crown. As this petition was very\r\ncarefully prepared, by two of the most eminent men in the Company’s\r\nservice; as it contains a considerable amount of useful information; and\r\nas it presents in its best aspects all that could be said in favour of\r\nthe Company—it may fittingly be transcribed in the present work. To\r\nprevent interruption to the thread of the narrative, however, it will be\r\ngiven in the Appendix (A), as the first of a series of documents.[191]\r\n\r\nWhen these various letters and petitions came under the notice of the\r\nCourt of Proprietors, they gave rise to an animated discussion. Most of\r\nthe proprietors admired the petition, as a masterly document; and many\r\nof the speakers dwelt at great length on the benefits which the Company\r\nhad conferred upon India. One of the directors, Sir Lawrence Peel,\r\nfeeling the awkwardness of dealing with a government measure not yet\r\nbefore them, said: ‘I have not signed the petition which you have just\r\nheard read; and I will shortly state the reason why. I entirely concur\r\nin the praises which have been bestowed upon that document. It is a most\r\nably reasoned and worded production; it does infinite credit to those\r\nwhose work it is; and it is much to the honour of this establishment\r\nthat it has talent capable of producing such a document. But I have not\r\nsigned the petition, because I have not thought it a prudent course to\r\npetition against a measure, the particulars of which I am not acquainted\r\nwith.’ The debate was further adjourned from the 20th to the 27th, and\r\nthen to the 28th, when the speeches ran to great length. On one or other\r\nof the four days of meeting, most of the directors of the Company\r\nexpressed their opinions—on the 13th, Mr Ross D. Mangles (chairman), and\r\nColonel Sykes; on the 20th, Sir Lawrence Peel and Captain Eastwick; on\r\nthe 27th, Mr Charles Mills, Sir Henry Rawlinson, Captain Shepherd, Mr\r\nMacnaghten, and Sir F. Currie (deputy-chairman); on the 28th, Mr Prinsep\r\nand Mr Willoughby. As might have been expected, a general agreement\r\nmarked the directors’ speeches; they were the arguments of men who\r\ndefended rights which they believed to be rudely assailed. Some of the\r\ndirectors complained that the government notice was not explicit enough.\r\nSome thought that, at any rate, it clearly foreshadowed the destruction\r\nof the Company’s power. Some contended that, if the Company did not\r\nspeak out at once, it would in a few weeks be too late. Some insisted\r\nthat the government brought forward the proposed measure in order to\r\nshift the responsibility for the mutiny to other shoulders. Some accused\r\nthe ministers of being influenced by a grasping for patronage, a desire\r\nto appropriate the nominations to appointments. One of the few who\r\ndeparted from the general tone of argument was Sir Henry Rawlinson, who\r\nassented neither to the resolution nor to the petition. He dwelt at some\r\nlength on the two propositions mainly concerned—namely, ‘that the\r\ntransfer of the government of India to the Crown would be unjust to the\r\nEast India Company;’ and that such transfer ‘would be fatal to British\r\nrule in India.’ Most of the other speakers had contended or implied that\r\nthe first clause of this statement involved the second; that the\r\ntransfer would be equally unjust to the Company, and injurious to India.\r\nSir Henry combated this. He contended that the connection was not a\r\nnecessary one. After a very protracted debate, the original resolution\r\nwas passed almost unanimously; and then the petition to both Houses of\r\nParliament was sanctioned as that of the Company generally.\r\n\r\nJust at this period, the directors caused to be prepared, and published\r\nat a cheap price, an elaborate ‘_Memorandum of the Improvements in the\r\nAdministration of India during the last Thirty Years_.’ It was evidently\r\nintended to fall into the hands of such members of parliament as might\r\nbe disposed to take up the cause of the Company in the forthcoming\r\ndebates, and to supply them with arguments in favour of the Company,\r\nderived from a recital of the marked improvements introduced in Indian\r\ngovernment. To this extent, it was simply a brief placed in the hands of\r\ncounsel; but the _Memorandum_ deserves to be regarded also in a\r\nhistorical light; for nothing but a very narrow prejudice could blind an\r\nobserver to the fact that vast changes had been introduced into the\r\nlegislative and administrative rule of India, during the period\r\nindicated, and that these changes had for the most part been conceived\r\nin an enlightened spirit—corresponding in direction, if not in\r\nintensity, with the improved state of public opinion at home on\r\npolitical subjects.\r\n\r\nParliament reassembled for the regular session on the 4th of February,\r\nfully alive to the importance of attending to all matters bearing on the\r\nwelfare of India. Earl Grey, on the 11th, presented to the House of\r\nLords the elaborate petition from the East India Company, lately\r\nadverted to. Characterising this as a ‘state paper deserving the highest\r\ncommendation,’ the earl earnestly deprecated the abolition of the Court\r\nof Directors, and the transfer of their authority to the ministry of the\r\nday; grounding his argument on the assumption that the interposition of\r\nan independent body, well informed on Indian affairs, between the\r\ngovernment and the natives of that country, was essential to the general\r\nwelfare. He admitted the need for reform, but not abolition. The Duke of\r\nArgyll, on the part of the government, admitted that the Company’s\r\npetition was temperate and dignified, but denied that its reasoning was\r\nconclusive. The Earl of Ellenborough, agreeing that the Queen’s name\r\nwould be powerfully influential as the direct ruler of India, at the\r\nsame time doubted whether any grand or sweeping reform ought to be\r\nattempted while India was still in revolt. The Earl of Derby joined in\r\nthis opinion, and furthermore complained of discourtesy shewn by the\r\nministers toward the directors, in so long withholding from them a\r\ncandid exposition of the provisions of the intended measure.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 12th of the month, the long-expected bill was\r\nintroduced to the House of Commons by Lord Palmerston—or rather, leave\r\nto bring in the bill was moved. The first minister of the Crown, in his\r\nspeech on the occasion, disowned any hostility to the Company, in\r\nreference either to the Revolt or to matters of general government. He\r\nbased the necessity for the measure on the anomaly of the Company’s\r\nposition. When the commercial privileges were withdrawn, chiefly in\r\n1833, the Company (he urged) became a mere phantom of what it had been,\r\nand subsided into a sort of agency of the imperial government, without,\r\nhowever, responsibility to parliament. Admitting the advantages of\r\nchecks as securities for honesty and efficiency in administrative\r\naffairs, he contended that check and counter-check had been so\r\nmultiplied in the ‘double government’ of India, as to paralyse action.\r\nHe considered that complete authority should vest where complete\r\nresponsibility was expected, and not in an irresponsible body of\r\nmerchants. His lordship concluded by giving an outline of the bill by\r\nwhich the proposed changes were to be effected.\r\n\r\nAs the Palmerston Bill, or ‘India Bill, No. 1,’ as it was afterwards\r\ncalled, was not passed into a law, it will not be necessary to reprint\r\nit in this work; nevertheless, to illustrate its bearing on the\r\nsubsequent debates, the pith of its principal clauses may usefully be\r\ngiven here: The government of the territories under the control of the\r\nEast India Company, and all powers in relation to government vested in\r\nor exercised by the Company, to become vested in and exercised by the\r\nsovereign—India to be henceforth governed in the Queen’s name—The real\r\nand personal property of the Company to be vested in Her Majesty for the\r\npurposes of the government of India—The appointments of governor-general\r\nof India, with ordinary members of the Council of India, and governors\r\nof the three presidencies, now made by the directors of the Company with\r\nthe approbation of her Majesty, and other appointments, to be made by\r\nthe Queen under her royal sign-manual—A council to be established, under\r\nthe title of ‘The President and Council for the Affairs of India,’ to be\r\nappointed by her Majesty—This council to consist of eight persons,\r\nexclusive of its president—In the first nomination of this council, two\r\nmembers to be named for four years, two for six, two for eight, and two\r\nfor ten years—The members of council to be chosen from among persons who\r\nhad been directors of the East India Company, or ten years at least in\r\nthe service of the Crown or Company in India, or fifteen years simply\r\nresident in India—Members of council, like the judges, only to be\r\nremovable by the Queen, on an address from both Houses of Parliament—The\r\npresident of the council eligible to sit in the Commons House of\r\nParliament—Four members of council to form a quorum—Each ordinary member\r\nto receive a yearly salary of £1000; and the president to receive the\r\nsalary of a secretary of state—The council to exercise the power now\r\nvested in the Company and the Board of Control; but a specified number\r\nof cadetships to be given to sons of civil and military servants in\r\nIndia—Appointments hitherto made in India to continue to be made in that\r\ncountry—Military forces, paid out of the revenues of India, not to be\r\nemployed beyond the limits of Asia—Servants of the Company to become\r\nservants of the crown—The Board of Control to be abolished.\r\n\r\nSuch was the spirit of the bill which Lord Palmerston asked leave to\r\nintroduce. Mr T. Baring moved as an amendment, ‘That it is not at\r\npresent expedient to legislate for the government of India.’ Thereupon a\r\ndebate arose, which extended through three evenings. The government\r\nmeasure was supported by speeches from Lord Palmerston, Sir Erskine\r\nPerry, Mr Ayrton, Sir Cornwall Lewis, Mr Roebuck, Mr Lowe, Mr Slaney,\r\nSir W. Rawlinson, Mr A. Mills, Sir Charles Wood, and Lord John Russell;\r\nwhile it was opposed on various grounds by Mr T. Baring, Mr Monckton\r\nMilnes, Sir J. Elphinstone, Mr Ross D. Mangles, Mr Whiteside, Mr\r\nLiddell, Mr Crawford, Colonel Sykes, Mr Willoughby, Sir E. B. Lytton,\r\nand Mr Disraeli. The reasonings in favour of the government measure were\r\nsuch as the following: That the proper time for legislation had come,\r\nwhen the attention of the country was strongly directed to Indian\r\naffairs; that all accounts from India shewed that some great measure was\r\neagerly expected; that it was dangerous any longer to maintain an\r\neffete, useless, and cumbrous machine, which the Court of Directors had\r\nvirtually become; that the Company’s ‘traditionary policy’ unfitted it\r\nto march with the age in useful reforms; that as the Board of Control\r\nreally possessed the ruling power, the double government was a sham as\r\nwell as an obstruction; that the princes of India felt themselves\r\ndegraded in being the vassals and tributaries of a mere mercantile body;\r\nthat, such was the anomaly of the double government, it was possible\r\nthat the Company might be at war with a power with which her Majesty was\r\nat peace, thus involving the nation in inextricable embarrassment; that,\r\nwith the exception of a very small section of the covenanted civil\r\nservants, the European community and the officers of the Indian army\r\nwould prefer the government of the crown to that of the Company; that\r\nthe natives of India having been thrown into doubt concerning the\r\nintentions of the Company to interfere with their religion, some\r\nauthoritative announcement of the Queen’s respect for their views on\r\nthat subject would be very satisfactory; and that as the native Bengal\r\narmy had disappeared, as India must in future be garrisoned by a large\r\nforce of royal troops, and as the military power would then belong to\r\nthe crown, it was desirable that the political power should go with it.\r\nAmong the pleas urged on the opposite side were such as follow: That the\r\nnatives of India would anticipate an increased stringency of British\r\npower, under the proposed _régime_; that the ministerial influence and\r\npatronage, in Indian matters, would be dangerous to England herself;\r\nthat as the Whig and Conservative parties had both supported the system\r\nof double government in the India Bill of 1853, there was no reason for\r\nmaking this sudden change in 1858; that before any change of government\r\nwas effected, it was imperatively necessary that an inquiry should be\r\nmade into the causes and circumstances of the Revolt; that the direct\r\nexercise of governing power by a queen, formally designated ‘Defender of\r\nthe Faith,’ could not be agreeable either to the Hindoos or the\r\nMohammedans of India, whose ideas of ‘faith’ were so widely different\r\nfrom those of Christians; that, as all previous organic changes in the\r\nadministration of the government of India had been preceded by an\r\ninquiry into the character of that government, so ought it in fairness\r\nto be in the present case; that if the proposed change were effected,\r\nEuropean theories and novelties, owing to the pressure of public opinion\r\non the ministry, would be attempted to be grafted on Asiatic prejudices\r\nand immobility, without due regard to the inherent antagonism of the two\r\nsystems; and that the enormous extent, population, revenue, and commerce\r\nof India ought not to be imperiled by a measure, the consequences of\r\nwhich could not at present be foreseen.\r\n\r\nThis debate ended on the 18th; the House of Commons, by a majority of\r\n318 to 173, granting leave for the introduction of the bill—it being\r\nunderstood that a considerable time would elapse before the second\r\nreading, in order that the details of the measure might be duly\r\nconsidered by all who took an interest in the matter.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, any very great attention could be given to the subject,\r\neither in or out of parliament, a most unexpected change took place in\r\nthe political relations of the government. The same minister who, on the\r\n18th of February, obtained leave to bring in the India Bill, was placed\r\non the 19th in a minority which led to the resignation of himself and\r\nhis colleagues. Circumstances connected with an attempted assassination\r\nof the Emperor of the French induced the Palmerston government to bring\r\nin a measure which proved obnoxious to the House of Commons; the measure\r\nwas rejected by 234 against 219, and the government accordingly\r\nresigned. So far as concerned the immediate effect, the most important\r\nfact connected with India was the offer by the Earl of Derby, the new\r\npremier, of the presidency of the India Board to the Earl of\r\nEllenborough. This nobleman had long been in collision with the East\r\nIndia Company and its civil servants. Twice already had he been\r\npresident of the Board of Control, and in 1842-3-4 he had filled the\r\nresponsible office of governor-general of India. In both offices, and at\r\nall times, he had cherished as much as possible the royal influence in\r\nIndia against the Company’s, the military against the civil. As a\r\nconsequence, his enemies were bitter, his friends enthusiastic. The\r\nauthor of an anonymous ‘red pamphlet,’ which attracted much notice\r\nduring the Revolt, spoke of the Earl of Ellenborough as the one great\r\nman who could alone be the saviour of India—as the chivalrous knight who\r\nwould shiver to atoms the ‘vested rights’ and ‘traditionary policy’ of\r\nthe Court of Directors. It was natural, therefore, that the accession of\r\nthe earl to the new government should be regarded as an important\r\nmatter, either for good or evil.\r\n\r\nIt speedily became apparent that the new president of the Board of\r\nControl would find difficulty in framing a line of proceeding on Indian\r\naffairs. His own predilections were quite as much against the Company,\r\nas those of his predecessor; but many of his colleagues in the Derby\r\ngovernment had committed themselves, when out of office, to a defence of\r\nthe Company, and to a condemnation of any immediate alteration in the\r\nIndian government. Either he must change his opinions, or they belie\r\ntheir own words. The Court of Directors would fain have expected\r\nindulgent treatment from the Derby administration, judging from the\r\nspeeches of the two preceding months; but their past experience of the\r\nEarl of Ellenborough threw a damp over their hope.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after the vote which occasioned the change of government,\r\nLord Palmerston proposed the postponement of the second reading of his\r\nIndia Bill until the 22d of April—a further lapse of six weeks; and this\r\nwas agreed to. He would not withdraw the bill, because he still adhered\r\nto its provisions; he would not at once proceed with it, because his\r\nopponents were now in office, and he preferred to see what course they\r\nwould adopt. The fate of India was thus placed in suspense for several\r\nweeks, simply through a party struggle arising out of French affairs;\r\nthe great question—’Who shall govern India?’—was made subservient to\r\nparty politics.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lord Palmerston had named the 22d of April as the day for\r\nreconsidering his India Bill, this did not tie down the Derby ministry\r\nto the adoption of any particular line of policy. After many discussions\r\nin the cabinet, it was resolved that the ministers should ‘eat their\r\nwords’ by legislating for India, although it had before been declared a\r\nwrong time for so doing; and that, throwing Lord Palmerston’s bill\r\naside, a new India Bill should be introduced.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 26th of March, Mr Disraeli, the new Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, moved for leave to bring in that which was afterwards\r\ncalled the ‘India Bill No. 2.’ As in a former instance, this bill may be\r\nmost usefully rendered intelligible by a condensed summary: A secretary\r\nof state for India, to be appointed by the Queen—This secretary to be\r\npresident of a Council of India—The council to consist of eighteen\r\npersons, nine nominated and nine elected—The nominated councillors to be\r\nappointed under the royal sign-manual by the crown, and to represent\r\nnine distinct interests—Those nine interests to be represented as\r\nfollow: the first councillor to have belonged for at least ten years to\r\nthe Bengal civil service; the second to the Madras service; the third to\r\nthe Bombay service; and the fourth to the Upper or Punjaub provinces,\r\nunder similar conditions; the fifth to have been British resident at the\r\ncourt of some native prince; the sixth to have served at least five\r\nyears with the Queen’s troops in India; the seventh, to have served the\r\nCompany ten years in the Bengal army; and the eighth and ninth,\r\nsimilarly in the Madras and Bombay armies—The nine nominated members to\r\nbe named in the bill itself, so as to give them parliamentary as well as\r\nroyal sanction—The remaining eight members of the council to be chosen\r\nby popular election—Four of such elected members to be chosen from among\r\npersons who had served the Crown or the Company at least ten years in\r\nany branch of the Indian service, or had resided fifteen years in India;\r\nand to be chosen by persons who had been ten years in the service of the\r\nCrown or the Company, or possessed £1000 of India stock, or possessed\r\n£2000 of capital in any Indian railway or joint-stock public works—The\r\nother five of such elected members to be chosen from among persons who,\r\nfor at least ten years, had been engaged in the commerce of India, or in\r\nthe export of manufactured articles thither; and to be chosen by the\r\nparliamentary constituencies of five large centres of commerce and\r\nmanufactures in the United Kingdom, namely, London, Liverpool,\r\nManchester, Glasgow, and Belfast—the Secretary of State for India to\r\nhave the power of dividing the council, thus constituted, into\r\ncommittees, and to exercise a general supervision over these\r\ncommittees—The secretary alone, or six councillors in union, to have\r\npower to summon a meeting of the council—The councillors not to be\r\neligible to sit in parliament, but to have each £1000 per annum for\r\ntheir services—The patronage heretofore exercised by the East India\r\nCompany to be now exercised by the Council—The army of India not to be\r\ndirectly affected by the bill—The revenues of India to bear the expenses\r\nof the government of India—A royal commission to be sent to India, to\r\ninvestigate all the facts and conditions of Indian finance.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this remarkable scheme was based on the idea of\r\nconciliating as many different interests as possible, in England and in\r\nIndia. Mr Disraeli, in the course of his speech, mentioned the names of\r\nthe nine gentlemen whom it was proposed to nominate to the council on\r\nthe part of the crown; and in relation to the vast powers of the\r\nsecretary and council, he said: ‘To establish a British minister with\r\nunrestricted authority, subject to the moral control of a body of men\r\nwho by their special knowledge, their independence, their experience,\r\ntheir distinction, and their public merit, are, nevertheless, invested\r\nwith an authority which can control even a despotic minister, and which\r\nno mere act of parliament can confer upon them, is, I admit, no ordinary\r\ndifficulty to encounter; and to devise the means by which it may be\r\naccomplished is a task which only with the indulgence of this House and\r\nwith the assistance of parliament we can hope to perform.’\r\n\r\nCriticisms were much more numerous and contradictory on this than on\r\nLord Palmerston’s bill. It was no longer a contest of Conservatives\r\nagainst Whigs. The new bill was examined on its merits. The friends of\r\nthe East India Company, expecting something favourable from the change\r\nof government, were much disappointed; they analysed the clauses of the\r\nbill, but found not what they sought. True, the old Indian interests\r\nwere to be represented in the new council; but just one-half of the\r\nmembers were to be nominees of the crown, and five others were to be\r\nelected by popular constituencies over which the Company possessed no\r\ncontrol. Even those who cared little whether the Company lived or died,\r\nprovided India were well governed, differed among themselves in opinion\r\nwhether the popular element would be usefully introduced in the manner\r\nproposed. The objections were more extensively urged out of parliament\r\nthan within; for after the first reading of the bill, on the 26th of\r\nMarch, the further consideration of it was postponed to the 19th of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives had reproved the Whigs for discourtesy to the East\r\nIndia Company, in not giving due notice of the provisions of ‘Bill No.\r\n1;’ but now equal discourtesy (if discourtesy it were) was shewn by the\r\nfirst-named party in reference to ‘Bill No. 2.’ On the 24th of March, at\r\na quarterly meeting of the Company, and only two days before Mr Disraeli\r\nintroduced his measure—or rather the Ellenborough measure—into the House\r\nof Commons, the chairman of the Court of Directors was asked whether he\r\nknew aught concerning the provisions of a bill so nearly touching the\r\ninterests of the Company; to which he replied: ‘I know no more about the\r\nforthcoming bill than I knew of the last before its introduction into\r\nparliament.’ On the 7th of April, however, at a special Court of\r\nProprietors, the directors presented copies of the bills, ‘No. 1’ and\r\n‘No. 2;’ and at the same time presented a Report against both. In the\r\ndebate, on the 7th and 13th, arising out of the presentation of the\r\nReport, there was a pretty general opinion among the proprietors, that\r\nif Lord Palmerston’s India Bill was bad, Mr Disraeli’s was not one whit\r\nbetter, in reference to the interests of the Company; and there was a\r\nfinal vote for the following resolution: ‘That this court concur in the\r\nopinion of the Court of Directors, that neither of the bills now before\r\nparliament is calculated to secure good government to India; and they\r\naccordingly authorise and request the Court of Directors to take such\r\nmeasures as may appear to them desirable for resisting the passing of\r\neither bill through parliament, and for introducing into any bill for\r\naltering the constitution of the government of India such conditions as\r\nmay promise a system of administration calculated to promote the\r\ninterests of the people of India, and to prove conducive to the general\r\nwelfare.’ One of the proprietors having expressed an opinion that the\r\ndirectors ought to prepare a third bill, more just than either of the\r\nother two, the chairman very fairly pointed out that it was not the\r\nCompany’s duty so to do.\r\n\r\nUnder somewhat unfavourable circumstances did the Derby ministry renew\r\nthe consideration of Indian affairs after the Easter recess. Parliament,\r\nit is true, had not yet had time or opportunity to criticise ‘Bill No.\r\n2;’ but that measure had been very unfavourably received both by the\r\nEast India Company and by the newspaper press; and it became generally\r\nknown that the ministers would gladly accept any decent excuse for\r\nabandoning or at least modifying the bill. This excuse was furnished to\r\nthem by Lord John Russell. On the 12th of April, when the Commons\r\nresumed their sittings after the Easter vacation, his lordship expressed\r\nan opinion that the bill was ill calculated to insure the desired end;\r\nthat its discussion was likely to be disfigured by a party contest; and\r\nthat it would be better to agree to a set of resolutions in committee,\r\non which a new bill might be founded. Mr Disraeli accepted this\r\nsuggestion with an eagerness which led many members to surmise that a\r\nprivate compact had been made in the matter. He suggested that Lord John\r\nRussell should draw up the resolutions; but as his lordship declined\r\nthis task, Mr Disraeli undertook it on the part of the government.\r\nHereupon a new phase was presented by the debate. One member expressed\r\nhis astonishment that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be so ready\r\nto hand over the functions of government to the care of a private\r\nmember. Another declared he could not see what advantage was to be\r\ngained by a resolution in committee in lieu of a bill in the whole\r\nHouse. The members of the late Whig government all condemned the plan\r\nsuggested by Lord John and accepted by Mr Disraeli; but, pending the\r\nintroduction of the proposed resolutions, they would not frustrate the\r\nplan. Mr Mangles, on the part of the East India Company, expressed an\r\nearnest hope that all party feeling would be excluded from the debates\r\non India. The East India Company, he remarked, could hardly be expected\r\nto acquiesce in a measure for their own extinction; nevertheless, if\r\nsuch should be proved to be inevitable, the directors would give their\r\nbest assistance to the perfecting of any measure which the House might\r\nthink proper to adopt. Mr Disraeli finally promised to prepare a set of\r\nresolutions, and to bring them in for discussion on the 26th.\r\n\r\nThe state, then, to which this intricate discussion had been brought was\r\nthis—the ‘Bill No. 1,’ proposed by Lord Palmerston, stood over for a\r\nsecond reading on the 22d of April; the ‘Bill No. 2,’ proposed by Mr\r\nDisraeli, was placed in abeyance for a time; while the ‘resolutions,’ to\r\nbe prepared by Mr Disraeli on the suggestion of Lord John Russell, and\r\nintended as a means of improving ‘Bill No. 2,’ or perhaps of leading to\r\na ‘Bill No. 3,’ were to be introduced on the 26th of April. It was\r\npretty generally felt, both within and without the walls of parliament,\r\nthat the whole subject was in great confusion, and that the ministers\r\nthemselves had no definite notion of the best course to pursue. At the\r\nmeeting of the East India Company on the 13th, Mr Mangles, who was a\r\nmember of parliament as well as chairman of the Company, said: ‘After\r\nthe extraordinary occurrences we have witnessed within the last six\r\nweeks, in which we have seen a minister ousted who was supposed to have\r\nthe support of a most commanding majority, and another minister placed\r\nin power without having a majority, or even a considerable minority, he\r\nwould be a very bold man who would prophesy what the fate of any new\r\nmeasure in the House of Commons would be.’\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of April, Mr Disraeli announced his intention of abandoning\r\n‘Bill No. 2’ altogether, and of postponing the preparation of ‘Bill No.\r\n3’ until the House should have agreed to any ‘resolutions’ bearing on\r\nthe subject. Lord Palmerston would not withdraw his ‘Bill No. 1;’ he\r\nsimply held it in abeyance for a time, to watch the course of pending\r\nevents. On the 26th, Mr Disraeli craved four days more for the\r\npreparation of his resolutions. He made a speech, in which he praised\r\nhis own ‘Bill No. 2’ at the expense of his antagonist’s ‘Bill No. 1;’\r\nbut, as he had ‘voluntarily stifled his own baby’—to use the\r\nillustration of another speaker—his arguments fell with little force.\r\nThe illustration, in truth, was so tempting, that it was long made use\r\nof both in and out of parliament. Lord Palmerston said: ‘The measure,\r\nupon which the right honourable gentleman has pronounced so unbounded a\r\nfuneral panegyric, has been murdered by himself. If he thought so well\r\nof the merits of the bill, why did he kill it?’ Mr Gregory, wishing, by\r\ngetting rid of the proposed ‘resolutions,’ to postpone all legislation\r\non the subject until another year, moved as an amendment—‘That at this\r\nmoment it is not expedient to pass any resolutions for the future\r\ngovernment of India.’ A general desire prevailed in the House, however,\r\nthat some measure or other should be passed into a law, to strengthen\r\nand render more definite the governing authority in India; and the\r\namendment was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 30th of April, the resolutions were proposed. They\r\ndeparted very widely from ‘Bill No. 2.’ The members of the council,\r\ninstead of being definitely eighteen in number, were to be ‘not less\r\nthan twelve and not more than eighteen.’ The scheme for representing\r\nclasses, services, presidencies, and commercial communities in the\r\ncouncil was given up; as was likewise the election of a portion of the\r\nmembers by parliamentary constituencies. As the whole of the fourteen\r\nresolutions, if agreed to, would require a separate agreement for each,\r\nand as every member would be allowed to speak on every resolution if he\r\nso chose, there were the materials presented for a very lengthened\r\ndebate. There was a preliminary discussion, moreover, on a motion\r\nintended to extinguish the resolutions altogether. Lord Harry Vane\r\nmoved—‘That the change of circumstances since the first proposal by her\r\nMajesty’s late advisers, to transfer the government of India from the\r\nEast India Company to the Crown, renders it inexpedient to proceed\r\nfurther with legislation on the subject during the present session.’\r\nThis proposal, however, was negatived by 447 to 57.\r\n\r\nIt would scarcely be possible, and scarcely worth while if possible, to\r\nfollow all the intricacies of the debate on the ‘resolutions.’ Every\r\npart of the India question was opened again and again; every speaker\r\nconsidered himself at liberty to wander from principles to details, and\r\nback again; and hence the amount of speaking was enormous. Should there\r\nbe a secretary of state for India, or only a president of a council?\r\nShould there be a council at all, or only a secretary with his\r\nsubordinates, as in the home, foreign, colonial, and war departments? If\r\na council, should it be wholly nominated, wholly elective, or part of\r\neach? Who should nominate, and who elect, and under what conditions?\r\nShould the secretary or president possess any power without his council,\r\nand how much? Should the East India Company, or not, be represented in\r\nthe new council? By whom should the enormous patronage of the Court of\r\nDirectors be hereafter exercised? What would become of the ‘vested\r\nrights’ of the Company, such as the receipt of dividends on the East\r\nIndia stock? In what relation would the governor-general of India stand\r\nto the new council? Would the local governments of the three\r\npresidencies be interfered with? Who would organise and support the\r\nIndian army? What would be done in relation to missionaries, idolatrous\r\npractices, caste, education, public works, manufactures, commerce, &c.,\r\nin India?—These were some of the questions which were discussed, not\r\nonce merely, but over and over again. Owing to the strange ministerial\r\nchanges, the independent members in the House had had but few\r\nopportunities of fully expressing their sentiments; they did so now, at\r\nample length. Many long nights of debate were spent over the\r\nresolutions; many amendments proposed; many alterations assented to by\r\nthe ministers. It occupied three evenings—April 30, May 3, and May 7—to\r\nsettle the first three resolutions; or rather, to agree to the first, to\r\nmodify the second, and to withdraw the third. At this period occurred\r\nthe exciting episode concerning the Oude proclamation, the censure of\r\nViscount Canning, and the resignation of the Earl of Ellenborough.[192]\r\nAs there was now no president of the Board of Control, the India\r\nresolutions could not conveniently be proceeded with; and therefore\r\neverything remained for a time at a dead-lock. Soon afterwards Lord\r\nStanley, son of the Earl of Derby, accepted the seals of the office\r\nvacated by the Earl of Ellenborough. He had every claim to the\r\nindulgence of the House, in the difficulty of his new position; and this\r\nindulgence was willingly shewn to him; he was permitted to choose his\r\nown time, after the ceremony of his re-election, to bring the great\r\nquestion of India once again before the Commons House, in the hope of\r\narriving at some practicable solution. For a period of one full month\r\ndid the further consideration of the resolutions remain in abeyance,\r\nwhile these party tactics and ministerial changes were engaging public\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 7th of June, when the subject was resumed, and when\r\nLord Stanley took the lead on Indian affairs in the House of Commons, it\r\nbegan to be apparent that the resolutions were less valued by the\r\ngovernment than they had before been. The debate concerning them,\r\nhowever, continued. When the time came for deciding how many members\r\nshould compose the new Council of India, Mr Gladstone reopened the whole\r\nquestion by moving as an amendment, ‘That, regard being had to the\r\nposition of affairs in India, it is expedient to constitute the Court of\r\nDirectors of the East India Company, by an act of the present session,\r\nto be a council for administering the government of India in the name of\r\nher Majesty, under the superintendence of such responsible minister,\r\nuntil the end of the next session of parliament.’ Mr Gladstone proposed\r\nthis amendment under a belief that it was not practicable, during the\r\nexisting session of parliament, to perfect a scheme of government for\r\nIndia that would be worthy of the nation. The problem to be solved was\r\none of the most formidable ever presented to any nation or any\r\nlegislature in the history of the world, and the evils of delay would be\r\ninsignificant in comparison with those of crude and hasty legislation.\r\nHis suggestion, he contended, would not be inconsistent with the\r\nappointment of a new council in the following year, if it should be\r\ndeemed desirable to make such appointment. Lord Stanley opposed this\r\namendment—on the grounds that it had all the evils of a temporary and\r\nprovisional measure; that the directors, as a council merely for one\r\nyear, would be placed in an inconvenient position; that having been told\r\nthat they were doomed, and that nothing could save them as a permanent\r\nbody, they would slacken their zeal and energy, and impair the\r\nconfidence of the public; that the much-condemned delays would still\r\ncontinue; and that the public service would derive no advantage. The\r\nfriends of the East India Company supported this amendment; but it was\r\nrejected by 265 against 116. Mr Roebuck then made an attempt to\r\nextinguish the council both in theory and in fact. He contended that a\r\nSecretary of State, alone responsible for all his acts, relying upon his\r\nown mind for guidance and counsel, and having a more direct interest in\r\ndoing right, was morally and mentally the best governor for India; he\r\nfeared that a council would render the governing body practically\r\nirresponsible to the nation. Lord Stanley, on the other hand, insisted\r\nthat it was quite impossible for any minister to act efficiently in such\r\na difficult office without the aid of advisers possessing special\r\ninformation on Indian affairs; and as the House generally concurred in\r\nthis view, Mr Roebuck’s amendment was negatived without a division. Two\r\nevenings, June 7th and 11th, were spent in discussing two resolutions.\r\nOn the 14th the House was engaged many hours in considering whether the\r\ncouncil should be elective, or nominated, or both; great diversity of\r\nopinion prevailed; and the speakers, tempted by the peculiarity of the\r\nsubject, wandered very widely beyond the limits of the immediate\r\nquestion. Lord John Russell thought that the members of the council\r\nought to be wholly appointed by the Crown, on the responsibility of the\r\nminister; Sir James Graham thought that the Court of Directors ought to\r\nbe _ex officio_ members of the council, to insure practical knowledge on\r\nIndian affairs; but Lord Stanley contended that the advantages of two\r\nsystems would be combined if one half of the council were nominated by\r\nthe Crown, and the other half elected by a constituency of seven or\r\neight thousand persons interested in or connected with Indian affairs;\r\nand the House, agreeing with this view, voted a resolution accordingly.\r\n\r\nMidsummer was approaching. The House of Lords had not yet had an\r\nopportunity of discussing the Indian question either in principle or in\r\ndetail; and it began now to be strongly felt that, as the resolutions\r\nreally did not bind the Commons to any particular clauses in the\r\nforthcoming bill, their value was doubtful. Accordingly, on the 17th of\r\nJune, after a long discussion on desultory topics, Lord Stanley\r\nproposed, amid some laughter in the House, to withdraw all the remaining\r\nresolutions—a proposition that was assented to with great alacrity,\r\nshewing that the legislators were by no means satisfied with the wisdom\r\nof their past proceedings.\r\n\r\nThus was completed the third stage in this curious legislative\r\nachievement. Lord Palmerston’s ‘India Bill No. 1’ was laid aside,\r\nbecause he was expelled from office; Mr Disraeli’s ‘India Bill No. 2’\r\nwas abandoned, because it was ridiculed on all sides; and now the\r\n‘resolutions’ were given up when half-finished, because they were found\r\nto be inoperative and non-binding. Some of the supporters of the East\r\nIndia Company claimed, and not illogically, a little more respect for\r\nthe Company than had lately been given; the difficulty of framing a new\r\ngovernment for India shewed, by implication, that the old _régime_ was\r\nnot so bad as had been customarily asserted.\r\n\r\nThe ‘India Bill No. 3’ was brought in by Lord Stanley on the\r\nevening (June 17th) which witnessed the withdrawal of the\r\nresolutions. The bill comprised sixty-six clauses—of the more\r\nimportant of which a brief outline may be given here, to furnish\r\nmeans of comparison with bills ‘No. 1’ and ‘No. 2:’ The government\r\nof India to revert from the Company to the Crown—A Secretary of\r\nState to exercise all the powers over Indian affairs hitherto\r\nexercised by the Court of Directors, the Secret Committee, and the\r\nBoard of Control—The Crown to determine whether to give these\r\npowers to one of the four existing secretaries of state, or to\r\nappoint a fifth—The Secretary to be assisted by a ‘Council of\r\nIndia,’ to consist of fifteen persons—The Court of Directors to\r\nelect seven of those members from among its own body, or from\r\namong persons who had at any time been directors; the remaining\r\neight to be nominated by the Queen—Vacancies in the council to be\r\nfilled up alternately by the Crown and by the council assembled\r\nfor that purpose—A majority of all the members to be chosen from\r\namong persons who had served or resided at least ten years in\r\nIndia—Every councillor to be irremovable during good behaviour, to\r\nbe prohibited from sitting in the House of Commons, to receive\r\ntwelve hundred pounds a year as salary, to be allowed to resign\r\nwhen he pleases, and to be entitled to a retiring pension varying\r\nin amount according to the length of service—Compensation to be\r\ngiven to such secretaries or clerks of the Company as do not\r\nbecome officers of the new department—The Secretary of State to be\r\npresident of the ‘Council of India,’ to divide the council into\r\ncommittees for the dispatch of business, and to appoint any member\r\nas vice-president—Council meetings to be called by the Secretary,\r\nor by any five members; and five to be a quorum—Questions to be\r\ndecided in the council by a majority, but the Secretary to have a\r\n_veto_ even over the majority—The Secretary may send and receive\r\n‘secret’ dispatches, without consulting his council at all—Most of\r\nthe appointments in India to be made as heretofore—Patronage of\r\ncadetships to be exercised partly by the council, but principally\r\nby the Secretary of State, and to be given in a certain ratio to\r\nsons of persons who have filled military or civil offices in\r\nIndia—The property, credits, debits, and liabilities of the\r\nCompany, except India stock and its dividends, to be transferred\r\nfrom the Company to the Crown; and the council to act as trustees\r\nin these matters—The council to present annual accounts to\r\nparliament of Indian finance and all matters relating thereto—The\r\ncouncil to guarantee the legalised dividend on India stock, out of\r\nthe revenues of India.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Bill No. 3,’ of which the above is a slight programme, came on for\r\nsecond reading on the 24th of June. Lord Stanley—who, as admitted by\r\nopponents as well as supporters, entered with great earnestness upon the\r\nduties of his office—stated that he had endeavoured to avail himself of\r\nall the opinions expressed during the various debates, to prepare a\r\nmeasure that should meet the views of a majority of the House. In the\r\ndiscussion that ensued, Mr Bright wandered into subjects that could not\r\npossibly be treated in the bill; he reopened the whole topic of Indian\r\nmisgovernment—disapproved of governor-generals—condemned\r\nannexations—suggested new presidencies and new tribunals—and told the\r\nCommons how he would govern India if he were minister. The speech was\r\nvigorous, but inapplicable to the subject-matter in hand. The bill was\r\nread a second time without a division.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company were not silent at this critical period in their\r\nhistory. A meeting of proprietors on the 23d was made special for the\r\nconsideration of ‘Bill No. 3,’ which was to be read a second time in the\r\nCommons on the following day; and at this meeting there was a general\r\nexpression of disappointment that the Company had been treated as such a\r\nnullity. The only source of consolation was in the fact that seven\r\nmembers of the new council were to be chosen by the Court of Directors,\r\nfrom persons who then belonged or had formerly belonged to that court.\r\nThe opinions of the Company were embodied in a letter addressed to Lord\r\nStanley by the chairman and deputy-chairman, and presented to the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, the House went into committee on the bill. Lord Palmerston\r\nproposed two amendments—that the members should be twelve in number\r\ninstead of fifteen, and that all should be appointed by the Crown; but\r\nboth amendments were rejected by large majorities as being inconsistent\r\nwith the recent expression of opinion. At a further sitting on the 1st\r\nof July, the ministers shewed they had obtained a considerable hold on\r\nthe House; for they succeeded in obtaining the rejection of amendments\r\nproposed by Lord Palmerston, Mr Gladstone, Sir James Graham, and Mr\r\nVernon Smith. Lord Stanley, however, proposed many amendments himself on\r\nthe part of the government; and these amendments were accepted in so\r\nfriendly a spirit, that a large number of clauses were got through by\r\nthe end of a long sitting on the 2d of July. One of the most interesting\r\nof the questions discussed bore relation to the Secret Committee of the\r\npast, and the proposed exercise of similar powers by the Secretary of\r\nState. Lord John Russell and Mr Mangles advocated the abolition of those\r\npowers altogether; while Sir G. C. Lewis recommended great caution in\r\ntheir exercise, if used. Mr Mangles, the late chairman of the Court of\r\nDirectors, stated that the powers of the Secret Committee had been much\r\nmore extensive than was generally supposed. ‘During many years after the\r\nconquest of Sinde, the whole government of that province was conducted\r\nby the Secret Committee, and the Court of Directors knew nothing about\r\nit. He believed that much mischief had arisen from the Secret Committee\r\nundertaking to transact business with which it had no right to\r\ninterfere. The real fact was, that nine-tenths of that which came before\r\nthe Secret Committee might with safety be communicated to the whole\r\nworld. He wished, therefore, that there should be no Secret Committee in\r\nfuture. It was a mere delusion and snare. The Court of Directors had\r\nshewn themselves to be as competent to keep a secret, when there was\r\none, as the cabinet of her Majesty; and he had no reason to think\r\notherwise of the proposed Indian Council.’ The ministers, however,\r\nreceived the support of Lord Palmerston in this matter; and the\r\ncontinuance of the secret powers was sanctioned, although by a small\r\nmajority only. On the 5th and 6th, the remaining clauses and amendments\r\nwere gone through. Mr Gladstone proposed a clause enacting, ‘That,\r\nexcept for repelling actual invasion, or under sudden or urgent\r\nnecessity, her Majesty’s forces in India shall not be employed in any\r\nmilitary operation beyond the external frontier of her Indian\r\npossessions, without the consent of parliament.’ Lord Palmerston opposed\r\nthis clause; but Lord Stanley assented to it as a wholesome declaration\r\nof parliamentary power; and it was agreed to.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 8th of July—five months after ‘Bill No. 1’ had been\r\nintroduced by Lord Palmerston, and three or four months after the\r\nintroduction of ‘Bill No. 2’ by Mr Disraeli—‘Bill No. 3’ was passed by\r\nthe House of Commons, after a vehement denunciation by Mr Roebuck, who\r\npredicted great disaster from the organisation of the ‘Council of\r\nIndia.’ Lord Palmerston’s bill was withdrawn on the next day: it never\r\ncame on for a second reading.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords justly complained of the small amount of time left to\r\nthem for the discussion of the bill; but there was now no help for it,\r\nshort of abandoning the measure for the session; and therefore they\r\nentered at once on the discussion. On the 9th, the bill was brought in\r\nand read a first time. Between that time and the second reading, the\r\nEast India Company made one more attempt to oppose the measure. They\r\nagreed to a petition for presentation to the House of Lords. It was in\r\npart a petition, in part a protest. The propriety of adopting the\r\npetition was urged by such considerations as these: ‘If we do not\r\nprotest, every wrong that may be done for years to come will be laid at\r\nour doors; but with this protest upon record, history will do us the\r\njustice of stating that we have been deprived of our power without\r\ninquiry.’ The Court of Proprietors also discussed whether counsel should\r\nbe employed to represent the Company before the House of Lords. Many of\r\nthe directors assented to this—but only so far as concerned technical\r\nand legal points; for, they urged, it would be very undignified to\r\nemploy any hired counsel to argue the moral and political question, or\r\nto defend the conduct of the Company and the rights of India. It\r\nremained yet, however, an unsettled point whether counsel would be\r\npermitted to appear at all.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of July, after a feeble attempt to attach importance to the\r\nCompany’s petition and protest, the bill was read a second time in the\r\nLords. The most remarkable speech made on this occasion was that of the\r\nEarl of Ellenborough, Lord Stanley’s predecessor at the Board of\r\nControl. He declared that, whether in or out of office, he could not\r\napprove of the measure, the parentage of which he gave to the House of\r\nCommons rather than to the government. He disapproved of the abandonment\r\nof popular election in the proposed council; disapproved of the strong\r\nleaven of ‘Leadenhall Street’ in its composition; disapproved of\r\ncompetitive examinations for the Indian artillery and engineers; and\r\nexpressed a general belief that the scheme would not work well. When the\r\nbill went into committee on the 16th, the earl proposed that the members\r\nof the council should be appointed for five years only, instead of for\r\nlife; but this amendment was negatived without a division. Lord\r\nBroughton, who, as Sir John Cam Hobhouse, had once been president of the\r\nIndia Board, opposed the whole theory of a council in the strongest\r\nterms. He described in anticipation the inconveniences he believed would\r\nflow from it. ‘The council would only embarrass the minister with\r\nuseless suggestions and minutes on the most trifling questions; and, if\r\nthey were rejected, the minority would always be able to furnish weapons\r\nof attack against the Secretary in the House of Commons. The minister\r\nwould gain no advice or knowledge from the council he could not obtain\r\nfrom others without the embarrassment of having official councillors.’\r\nThe Earl of Derby contested these assertions simply by denying their\r\ntruth; and they had no effect on the decision of the House. All the\r\nclauses were examined during three sittings, on the 16th, 19th, and 20th\r\nof the month, and were adopted with a few amendments. During the\r\ndiscussions, the Earl of Derby appeared as the friend of the ‘middle\r\nclasses.’ The Earl of Ellenborough having repeated his objection to\r\ncompetitive examination for the engineers and artillery of the Indian\r\narmy, on the ground that it would lower the ‘gentlemanly’ standard of\r\nthose services, the premier replied that, ‘He was not insensible to the\r\nadvantages of birth and station: but he could not join with his noble\r\nfriend in saying that because a person happened to be the son of a\r\ntailor, a grocer, or a cheesemonger, provided his mental qualifications\r\nwere equal to those of his competitors, he was to be excluded from\r\nhonourable competition for an appointment in the public service.’\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of July the India Bill was read a third time and passed by\r\nthe House of Lords, with only a few observations bearing collaterally on\r\nIndian affairs. The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the bishops\r\nmade an appeal for the more direct encouragement of Christianity in\r\nIndia; but the Earl of Derby made a very cautious response. ‘Due\r\nprotection ought to be given to the professors of all religions in\r\nIndia, and nothing should be done to discourage the efforts of Christian\r\nmissionaries. On the other hand, he deemed it essential to the\r\ninterests, the peace, the well-being of England, if not also to the very\r\nexistence of her power in India, that the government should carefully\r\nabstain from doing anything except to give indiscriminate and impartial\r\nprotection to all sects and all creeds; and that nothing could be more\r\ninconvenient or more dangerous on the part of the state than any open or\r\nactive assistance to any attempt to convert the native population from\r\ntheir own religions, however false or superstitious.’ The Earls of\r\nShaftesbury and Ellenborough joined in deploring the vindictive feeling\r\nwhich had sprung up between the Europeans and natives in India, and\r\nwhich, if continued, would neutralise all attempts at improvement. The\r\nAnglo-Indian press was severely reproved for the share it had taken in\r\noriginating or fostering this feeling.\r\n\r\nThe Lords having introduced a few amendments in the India Bill, these\r\namendments required the sanction of the Commons before they could be\r\nadopted. One of these affected the secret service of the new council;\r\nanother, the mode of appointing the higher officials in India; a third,\r\nthe principle of competitive examinations; a fourth, the application of\r\nIndian revenues; and so on. The Commons rejected some of these\r\namendments, and accepted the rest, on the 27th. On the 29th the Lords\r\nmet to consider whether they would abandon the amendments objected to by\r\nthe Commons. This they agreed to do except in one instance—relating to\r\ncompetitive examinations for the Indian artillery and engineers; they\r\nstill thought that commissions in these two services should be given\r\nonly to ‘gentlemen,’ in the conventional sense of the term. The\r\ngovernment, rather than run into collision with the Lords, recommended\r\nthe Commons to assent to the slight amendment which had been made; and\r\nthis was agreed to—but not without many pungent remarks on the course\r\nwhich the Upper House had thought proper to pursue. Sir James Graham\r\nadverted to a supercilious allusion by the Earl of Ellenborough to the\r\n‘John Gilpin class,’ and added—‘Where is hereditary wisdom found? In\r\nwhat consists the justice of the tenet that India must henceforward be\r\ngoverned by gentlemen, to the exclusion of the middle classes—a\r\ngentleman being defined to be something between a peer and those who buy\r\nand sell. Is this, I would ask, the only argument that can be advanced\r\nagainst the system of competitive examinations? Who, let me ask,\r\nfounded, who won our Indian empire?—Those who bought and sold. Who\r\nextended it?—Those who bought and sold. Who now transfer that empire to\r\nthe Crown?—Those who bought and sold; a company of merchants—merchants,\r\nforsooth, whose sons are now not thought worthy to have even inferior\r\noffices in India committed to their hands. But are not the sons of those\r\nwho buy and sell entitled to the appellation of gentlemen? Definitions\r\nare dangerous; but I should, nevertheless, like to know what it is that\r\nconstitutes a gentleman. Why, sir, it appears to me that if a man be\r\nimbued with strong Christian principles, if he have received an\r\nenlightened and liberal education, if he be virtuous and honourable—it\r\nappears to me that such a man as that is entitled to the appellation.\r\nAnd who will tell me that among the sons of those who buy and sell may\r\nnot be found men possessing literary attainments and a refinement of\r\nmind which place them in a position to bear comparison with the highest\r\nborn gentlemen in India? Who, let me ask, were the conquerors of the\r\ncountry? From what class have they sprung? Who was Clive?—The son of a\r\nyeoman. Who was Munro?—The son of a Glasgow merchant. Who was\r\nMalcolm?—The son of a sheep-farmer upon the Scotch border. These, sir,\r\nare the men who have won for us our Indian empire; and I entertain no\r\nfear that the sons of those who buy and sell, and who enter the Indian\r\nservice by means of this principle of open competition, will fail to\r\nmaintain a high position in our army, or that they will do anything to\r\ndishonour the English name.’\r\n\r\nWhen the India Bill finally passed the Lords, the Earl of Albemarle\r\nrecorded a protest against it—on the grounds that the home government\r\nestablished by it would be inefficient and unconstitutional; that the\r\ncouncil would be too numerous; that it would be nearly half composed of\r\nthe very directors who were supposed to be under condemnation; that\r\nthose directors, by self-election to the council, would establish a\r\nvicious principle; that the members of the council would be\r\nirresponsible for the use of the great amount of patronage held by them;\r\nthat the change in the mode of government was too slight to insure those\r\nreforms which India so much needed; that it was pernicious, and contrary\r\nto parliamentary precedent, to allow the members of the council to hold\r\nother offices, or to engage in commercial pursuits; that the practical\r\neffect of the council would be merely to thwart the Secretary of State\r\nfor India, or else to screen him from censure; and that efficient and\r\nexperienced under-secretaries would be far better than any council.\r\n\r\nThe bill received the royal assent, and became an act of parliament, on\r\nthe 2d of August, under the title of ‘An Act for the Better Government\r\nof India;’ 21st and 22d of Victoria, cap. 106. A brief and intelligible\r\nabstract of all the provisions of this important statute will be found\r\nin the Appendix.\r\n\r\nOne clause in the new act provided that the Court of Directors should\r\nelect seven members to the new council of India, either out of the\r\nexisting court, or from persons who had formerly been directors of the\r\nCompany. On the 7th of August they met, and chose the following seven of\r\ntheir own number—Sir James Weir Hogg, Mr Charles Mills, Captain John\r\nShepherd, Mr Elliot Macnaghten, Mr Ross Donelly Mangles, Captain William\r\nJoseph Eastwick, and Mr Henry Thoby Prinsep. Many of the public journals\r\nseverely condemned this selection, as having been dictated by the merest\r\nselfish retention of power in the directors’ own hands; but on the other\r\nside, it was urged that these seven gentlemen possessed a large amount\r\nof practical knowledge on Indian affairs; and, moreover, that the\r\nCompany, owing the legislature no thanks for recent proceedings, were\r\nnot bound to be disinterested in the matter.\r\n\r\nA remarkable meeting was held by the East India Company on the 11th of\r\nAugust, to consider the state of affairs produced by the new act. The\r\ndirectors and proprietors met as if no one clearly knew what to think on\r\nthe matter. They asked—What _is_ the East India Company now? What does\r\nit possess? What can it do, or what has it got to do? Has it any further\r\ninterest in the affairs of India? Is there now any use in a Court of\r\nDirectors, or a Court of Proprietors, further than to distribute the\r\ndividends on India stock handed over by the new Council of India out of\r\nIndian revenues? Is the regular payment of that dividend well secured?\r\nAre the _trading_ powers of the Company abolished; and if not, is there\r\nany profitable trade that can be entered upon? Are they to lose their\r\nhouse in Leadenhall Street, their museum, their library, their archives;\r\nand if so, why? If the Company at any time become involved in\r\nlaw-proceedings, will the costs come out of the dividends, or out of\r\nwhat other fund? The answers to these various questions were so very\r\nconflicting, and the state of doubt among all the proprietors so\r\nevident, that it was agreed—‘That a committee of proprietors be\r\nappointed to act in concert with the chairman and deputy-chairman of the\r\nCourt of Directors, for the purpose of obtaining counsel’s opinion as to\r\nthe present legal position of the Company under previous acts of\r\nparliament, as well as the present act—more especially as to the\r\nparliamentary guarantee of the Company’s stock, and the position of the\r\nCompany’s creditors, Indian as well as European.’\r\n\r\nThe 1st of September 1858 was a day to be recorded in English annals—it\r\nwitnessed the death of the once mighty East India Company as a governing\r\nbody. ‘On this day,’ said one of the able London journals, ‘the Court of\r\nDirectors of the East India Company holds its last solemn assembly.\r\nTo-morrow, before the shops and the counting-houses of our great\r\nmetropolis shall have received their accustomed inmates, the greatest\r\ncorporate body the world has ever seen will have shrivelled into an\r\nassociation of receivers of dividends. The great house in Leadenhall\r\nStreet will stand as it has stood for long years, and well-nigh the same\r\nbusiness will be done by well-nigh the same persons; but the government\r\nof the East India Company will have passed into a tradition. Thousands\r\nand tens of thousands, including many of the greatest and wisest in the\r\nland, intent upon pleasure at this pleasure-seeking period of the year,\r\nwill, in all human probability, not give the great change a thought. But\r\nthe first and second days of September 1858, which witness the\r\nextinction of the old and the inauguration of the new systems of Indian\r\ngovernment, constitute an epoch in our national history—nay, in the\r\nworld’s history, second in importance to few in the universal annals of\r\nmankind. On this day the East India Company, which hitherto, through\r\nvaried changes and gradations, has directed the relations of Great\r\nBritain with the vast continent of India, issues its last instructions\r\nto its servants in the east. On this day the last dispatches written by\r\nthe authoritative “we” to our governor-general, or governors in council,\r\nwill be signed by their “affectionate friends.” To-morrow the _egomet_\r\nof her Majesty’s Secretary of State will be supreme in the official\r\ncorrespondence of the Indian bureau. It may or may not be for the good\r\nof India, it may or may not be for the good of England, that the\r\ngovernment of the East India Company should on this day cease to exist;\r\nbut we confess we do not envy the feelings of the man who can\r\ncontemplate without emotion this great and pregnant political change.’\r\nThere was a disposition, on this last day of the Company’s power, to\r\nlook at the bright rather than the dark side of its character. ‘It has\r\nthe great privilege of transferring to the service of her Majesty such a\r\nbody of civil and military officers as the world has never seen before.\r\nA government cannot be base, cannot be feeble, cannot be wanting in\r\nwisdom, that has reared two such services as the civil and military\r\nservices of the East India Company. To those services the Company has\r\nalways been just, has always been generous. In those services lowly\r\nmerit has never been neglected. The best men have risen to the highest\r\nplace. They may have come from obscure farmhouses or dingy places of\r\nbusiness; they may have been roughly nurtured and rudely schooled; they\r\nmay have landed in the country without sixpence or a single letter of\r\nrecommendation in their trunks; but if they have had the right stuff in\r\nthem, they have made their way to eminence, and have distanced men of\r\nthe highest connections and most flattering antecedents.... Let her\r\nMajesty appreciate the gift—let her take the vast country and the\r\nteeming millions of India under her direct control; but let her not\r\nforget the great corporation from which she has received them, nor the\r\nlessons to be learned from its success.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Old East India House, Leadenhall Street.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe last special General Court of the Company was held, as we have said,\r\non the 1st of September. The immediate purpose was a generous one: the\r\ngranting of a pension to the distinguished ruler of the Punjaub, Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence; and this was followed by an act at once dignified and\r\ngraceful. It was an earnest tender of thanks, on the part of the East\r\nIndia Company generally, to its servants of every rank and capacity, at\r\nhome and in India, for their zealous and faithful performance of duties;\r\nan assurance to the natives of India that they would find in Queen\r\nVictoria ‘a most gracious mistress;’ an expression of hearty belief that\r\nthe home-establishment, if employed by the Crown, would serve the Crown\r\nwell as it had served the Company; a declaration of just pride in the\r\nsterling civilians and noble soldiers at that moment serving unweariedly\r\nin India; and an earnest hope and prayer ‘That it may please Almighty\r\nGod to bless the Queen’s Indian reign by the speedy restoration of\r\npeace, security, and order; and so to prosper her Majesty’s efforts for\r\nthe welfare of her East Indian subjects that the millions who will\r\nhenceforth be placed under her Majesty’s direct as well as sovereign\r\ndominion, constantly advancing in all that makes men and nations great,\r\nflourishing, and happy, may reward her Majesty’s cares in their behalf\r\nby their faithful and firm attachment to her Majesty’s person and\r\ngovernment.’\r\n\r\nThe East India House in Leadenhall Street was chosen by Lord Stanley as\r\nthe office of the new Council for India, on account of its internal\r\nresources for the management of public business. During more than two\r\ncenturies and a half, the city of London had contained the head-quarters\r\nof those who managed Anglo-Indian affairs. The first meeting of London\r\nmerchants in 1599, on the subject of East India trade, was held at\r\nFounders’ Hall. The early business of the Company, when formed, was\r\ntransacted partly at the residences of the directors, partly in the\r\nhalls of various incorporated companies. In 1621 the Company occupied\r\nCrosby Hall for this purpose. In 1638 a removal was made to Leadenhall\r\nStreet, to the house of Sir Christopher Clitheroe, at that time governor\r\nof the Company. In 1648 the Company took the house of Lord Craven,\r\nadjoining Clitheroe’s, and on the site of the present India House. In\r\n1726 the picturesque old front of this mansion was taken down, and\r\nreplaced by the one represented in the above cut. Finally, in 1796, the\r\npresent India House was built,[193] and remained the head-quarters of\r\nthe Company. Acquiring skill by gradual experience, the Company had\r\nrendered this one of the most perfectly organised establishments that\r\never existed. Ranged in racks and shelves, in chambers, corridors, and\r\ncellars, were the records of the Company’s administration; prepared by\r\ngovernor-generals, judges, magistrates, collectors, paymasters,\r\ndirectors, secretaries, and other officials abroad and at home. These\r\ndocuments, tabulated and indexed with the greatest nicety, related to\r\nthe whole affairs of the Company, small as well as great, and extended\r\nback to the earliest period of the Company’s history. Declarations of\r\nwar, treaties of peace, depositions of native princes, dispatches of\r\ngovernor-generals, proceedings of trials, appeals of natives, revenue\r\nassessments, army disbursements—all were fully recorded in some mode or\r\nother. The written documents relating to a hundred and fifty-five years\r\nof the Company’s history, from 1704 to 1858, filled no less than a\r\nhundred and sixty thousand huge folio volumes. These documents were so\r\nthoroughly indexed and registered that any one could be found by a very\r\nbrief search. It was mentioned with pride by the staff of the India\r\nHouse, that when Lord Stanley, in his capacity as Secretary of State for\r\nIndia, made his first official visit to Leadenhall Street, he was\r\ninvited to test the efficiency of this registration department, by\r\ncalling for any particular dispatch, or for any document bearing upon\r\nany act or policy of the Court of Directors, throughout a period of a\r\ncentury and a half; a promise was given that any one of these documents\r\nshould be forthcoming in five minutes. His lordship thereupon asked for\r\na report on the subject of some occurrence which took place under his\r\nown observation while on a tour in India. The document was speedily\r\nproduced, and was found to contain all the details of the transaction\r\nminutely described.\r\n\r\nAfter the Court of Directors had elected seven members to the new\r\ncouncil, the government nominated the other eight. The greatest name on\r\nthe list was Sir John Laird Muir Lawrence, who was expected to return to\r\nEngland, and for whom a place at the council-board was kept vacant. The\r\nother seven nominated members were Sir Henry Conyngham Montgomery, Sir\r\nFrederick Currie, Major-general Sir Robert John Hussey Vivian, Colonel\r\nSir Proby Thomas Cautley, Lieutenant-colonel Sir Henry Creswicke\r\nRawlinson, Mr John Pollard Willoughby, and Mr William Arbuthnot. It was\r\nconsidered that the fifteen members, in reference to their past\r\nexperience of Indian affairs, might fairly represent the following\r\ninterests:\r\n\r\n                Bengal Civil Service, Prinsep, Mangles.\r\n                Madras Civil Service, Montgomery.\r\n                Bombay Civil Service, Willoughby.\r\n                Bengal Army,          Cautley.\r\n                Madras Army,          Vivian.\r\n                Bombay Army,          Eastwick.\r\n                The Punjaub,          Lawrence.\r\n                Afghan Frontier,      Rawlinson.\r\n                Native States,        Currie.\r\n                Indian Law,           Hogg, Macnaghten.\r\n                Shipping Interests,   Shepherd.\r\n                Finance,              Mills.\r\n                Indian Commerce,      Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nThis classification, however, was not official; it was only useful in\r\ndenoting the kind of knowledge likely to be brought to the council by\r\neach member. When, in the early days of September, Lord Stanley presided\r\nat the first meetings of the new council, he grouped the members into\r\ncertain committees, for the more convenient dispatch of business. This\r\ngrouping was based in part on the previous practice of the East India\r\nCompany, and in part on suggested improvements. The committees were\r\nthree in number, of five members each—partly nominated, and partly\r\nelected. The functions and composition of the committees were as follow:\r\n\r\n                    FINANCE, HOME, AND PUBLIC WORKS.\r\n                   Sir Proby Cautley,   }\r\n                   Mr Arbuthnot,        } Nominated.\r\n\r\n                   Mr Mills,            }\r\n                   Mr Macnaghten,       } Elected.\r\n                   Captain Shepherd,    }\r\n\r\n                        POLITICAL AND MILITARY.\r\n                   Sir John Lawrence,   }\r\n                   Sir R. Vivian,       }\r\n                   Sir H. Rawlinson,    } Nominated.\r\n                   Mr Willoughby,       }\r\n\r\n                   Captain Eastwick,      Elected.\r\n\r\n                   REVENUE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE.\r\n                   Sir H. Montgomery,   }\r\n                   Sir F. Currie,       } Nominated.\r\n\r\n                   Sir J. W. Hogg,      }\r\n                   Mr Mangles,          } Elected.\r\n                   Mr Prinsep,          }\r\n\r\nLord Stanley appointed Sir G. R. Clerk and Mr Henry Baillie to be\r\nunder-secretaries of state for India; and Mr James Cosmo Melvill, late\r\ndeputy-secretary to the East India Company, to be assistant\r\nunder-secretary. Mr John Stuart Mill, one of the most distinguished of\r\nthe Company’s servants in England, was earnestly solicited by Lord\r\nStanley to assist the new government with his services; but he declined\r\non account of impaired health. With a few exceptions, the valued and\r\nexperienced servants of the Company became servants of the new council,\r\nas secretaries, clerks, examiners, auditors, record-keepers, &c.; for\r\nthe rest, arrangements were to be gradually made in the form of\r\ncompensations, pensions, or retiring allowances.\r\n\r\nOne of the first proceedings under the new _régime_ was the appointment\r\nof a commission to investigate the complicated relations of the Indian\r\narmy. The heads of inquiry on which the commission was to enter included\r\nalmost everything that could bear upon the organisation and efficiency\r\nof the military force in the east, under a system where the anomalous\r\ndistinction between ‘Company’s’ troops and ‘Queen’s’ troops would no\r\nlonger be in force. Such an inquiry would necessarily extend over a\r\nperiod of many months, and would need to be conducted partly in India\r\nand partly in England.\r\n\r\nIn closing this narrative of the demise of the powerful East India\r\nCompany as a political or governing body, it may be remarked that all\r\nthe well-wishers of India felt the change to be a great and signal one,\r\nwhether for good or harm. There were not wanting prophets of disaster.\r\nThe influence of parliament being so much more readily brought to bear\r\nupon a government department than upon the East India Company, many\r\npersons entertained misgivings concerning the effect of the change upon\r\nthe well-being of India. Before any long period could elapse, submarine\r\ncables would probably have been sunk in so many seas, and land-cables\r\nstretched across so many countries, that a message would be flashed from\r\nLondon to Calcutta in a few hours. Lord Palmerston once jocularly made a\r\nprediction, ten years before the Indian mutiny broke out, to the effect\r\nthat the day would come when, if a minister were asked in parliament\r\nwhether war had broken out in India, he would reply: ‘Wait a minute;\r\nI’ll just telegraph to the governor-general, and let you know.’ A war in\r\nIndia did indeed come, before the period for the fulfilment of this\r\nprediction; but the time was assuredly approaching when the\r\n‘lightning-post,’ as the natives of India felicitously call it, would be\r\nin operation. What would be the results? Some of the foreboders of\r\ndisaster said: ‘In any great crisis, it is true, which demands prompt\r\naction on the part of the governing country, this rapid\r\nintercommunication will be a source of strength; the resources of\r\nEngland will be brought to bear upon any part of India four or five\r\nweeks sooner than under existing circumstances. But, on the other hand,\r\nthe ordinary work of government, at either end of the wire, will be\r\ngreatly complicated and embarrassed by this frequent intercommunication\r\nof ideas. The Council of India will probably not be overanxious to\r\nfetter the movements of the governor-general; nor will the Secretary of\r\nState for India be necessarily prone to send curt sentences of advice or\r\nremonstrance to the distant viceroy; but it is doubtful whether\r\nparliament would suffer the council or the Secretary to exercise this\r\nwise forbearance. There would be a tendency to govern India by the House\r\nof Commons through the medium of the electric telegraph. A sensitive\r\ngovernor-general would be worried to death in a few months by the\r\ninterference of the telegraph with his free action; and an irritable one\r\nmight be stung into indignant resignation in a much shorter time.’ All\r\nsuch fears are groundless. If a message from England were perilous in\r\nits tendency through its ease and quickness of transmission, a message\r\nfrom India pointing out this perilous tendency would be equally easy and\r\nquick. The electric messenger does its work as rapidly in one direction\r\nas the other. A governor-general, worthy of the name, would take care\r\nnot instantly to obey an order which he believed to be dangerous to the\r\nwelfare of the country under his charge; the wire would enable him to\r\nconverse with the authorities at home in a few hours, or, at any rate, a\r\nfew days, and to explain circumstances which would probably lead to a\r\nmodification of the order issued. The electric telegraph being one of\r\nthe greatest boons ever given by science to mankind, it will be strange\r\nindeed if England does not derive from it—in her government of India, as\r\nin other matters—an amount of benefit that will immeasurably outweigh\r\nany temporary inconveniences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Calcutta.—Company’s Troops early in the Nineteenth Century.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  Some of the documents here adverted to will be given _verbatim_;\r\n  others in a condensed form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  See Chap, xxvii., p. 451.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  See Engraving, p. 452.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  W. & R.

ENGLISH PROSPECTS IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the least among the many extraordinary circumstances connected with\r\nthe Revolt in India was this—that England, at the very time when the\r\nRevolt began, had two Asiatic wars on her hands, one eastward and the\r\nother westward of her Indian empire. True, the Shah of Persia had\r\nconsented to a treaty of peace before that date; true, the Emperor of\r\nChina had not yet actually received a declaration of war; but it is\r\nequally true that British generals and soldiers were still holding\r\nconquered positions in the one country, and that hostilities had\r\ncommenced in the other. We have seen in former chapters, and shall have\r\noccasion to refer to the fact again, that Viscount Canning was most\r\nearnestly desirous, when the troubles in India began, to obtain the aid\r\nof two bodies of British troops—those going to China, and those\r\nreturning from Persia. It must ever remain an insoluble problem how the\r\nRevolt would have fared if there had been no Persian and Chinese\r\nexpeditions. On the one hand, several additional regiments of the\r\nCompany’s army, native as well as European, would have been in India,\r\ninstead of in or near Persia. On the other hand, there would not have\r\nbeen so many disciplined British troops at that time on the way from\r\nEngland to the east. Whether these two opposing circumstances would have\r\nneutralised each other, can only be vaguely guessed at.\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations, however, than that which concerns the\r\npresence or absence of British troops, tending to give these two\r\nexpeditions a claim to some brief notice in the present work. The\r\nPersian war, if the short series of hostilities deserve that name,\r\narose, mainly and in the first instance, out of apprehensions for the\r\nfuture safety of British India on the northwest. The Chinese war arose,\r\nmainly and in the first instance, out of that opium-traffic which had\r\nput so many millions sterling into the coffers of the East India\r\nCompany. Other events, it is true, had tended to give a different colour\r\nand an intricate complication to the respective quarrels; but it can\r\nhardly be doubted that the India frontier-question in the one case, and\r\nthe India opium-question in the other, were the most powerful\r\npredisposing causes in bringing about the two wars. Two sections of the\r\npresent chapter are appropriated to such an outline of these two warlike\r\nexpeditions as will shew how far they were induced by India, and how far\r\nthey affected India, before and during the Revolt. Any detailed\r\ntreatment of the operations would be beyond the scope of the present\r\nvolume. The expedition to Japan will claim a little notice as a peaceful\r\nepisode in the Chinese narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  § 1. THE PERSIAN EXPEDITION, 1856-7.\r\n\r\nExamining a map of Asia, we shall see that the country, called in its\r\nwidest extent Afghanistan, is bounded on the east by India, on the west\r\nby Persia, and on the north by the territories of various Turcoman\r\ntribes. Whatever may be the fruitfulness or value of Afghanistan in\r\nother respects, it includes and possesses the only practicable route\r\nfrom Central Asia to the rich plains of India. So far as Persia,\r\nBokhara, and Khiva are concerned, England would never for a moment think\r\nof doubting the safety of India; but when, in bygone years, it was known\r\nthat Russia was increasing her power in Central Asia, acquiring a great\r\ninfluence over the Shah of Persia, and sending secret agents to\r\nAfghanistan, a suspicion arose that the eye of the Czar was directed\r\ntowards the Indus as well as towards the Bosphorus, to India as well as\r\nto Turkey. Alarmists may have coloured this probability too highly, but\r\nthe symptoms were not on that account to be wholly neglected. About\r\nmidway between the Punjaub and the Caspian Sea is the city of Herat,\r\nnear the meeting-point of Persia, Afghanistan, and Turkistan or\r\nIndependent Tatary. It was this city, rather than any other, which\r\ncaused the war with Persia. To what state does Herat belong, Persia or\r\nAfghanistan? The answer to this question is of great political\r\nimportance; for as Russia has more influence in the first-named state\r\nthan in the second, any aggressive schemes of the court of St Petersburg\r\nagainst India would be favoured by a declaration or admission that Herat\r\nbelonged to Persia. In the course of twenty centuries Afghanistan has\r\nbeen in succession under Persian, Bactrian, Scythian, Hindoo, Persian,\r\nSaracenic, Turcoman, Khorasan, Mongol, Mogul, Persian, and Afghan rule;\r\nuntil at length, in 1824, three Afghan princes divided the country\r\nbetween them—one taking the Cabool province, another that of Candahar,\r\nand another that of Herat. There are therefore abundant excuses for\r\nPersians and Turcomans, Afghans and Hindoos, laying claim to this\r\nregion, if they think themselves strong enough to enforce their claims.\r\nIt is just such a complication as Russia would like to encourage,\r\nsupposing her to have any designs against India—just such a\r\ncomplication, we must in justice add, as would lead England to seize\r\nAfghanistan, if she thought it necessary for the safety of her Indian\r\nempire. When Lord Auckland was governor-general of India, in 1837, he\r\ninterfered in Afghan politics, in order to insure the throne of Cabool\r\nto a prince friendly to England and hostile to Russia and Persia; this\r\ninterference led to the first Afghan war in 1838, the disastrous\r\ntermination of which brought on the second Afghan war of 1842. Since the\r\nyear last named, the Cabool and Candahar territories have remained in\r\nthe hands of princes who were bound, by treaties of alliance, to\r\nfriendly relations with England. Herat, however, further west and more\r\ninaccessible, became a prey to contentions which brought on the Persian\r\nwar in 1856.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1833, disputes arose between Herat and Persia which have\r\nnever since been wholly healed. The Shah claimed, if not the ownership\r\nof Herat, at least a tribute that would imply a sort of protective\r\nsuperiority. This tribute was suddenly withdrawn by Kamran Mirza, Khan\r\nof Herat, in or about the year just named; and certain clauses of a\r\ntreaty were at the same time disregarded by him. Thence arose a warlike\r\ntendency in the court of Teheran—encouraged by Count Simonich, Russian\r\nambassador; and discouraged by Mr Ellis, British ambassador.\r\nNegotiations failing, a Persian army began to march, and the Shah\r\nformally declared Herat to be a province of the Persian empire. The\r\nfortress of Ghorian fell, and after that the city of Herat was invested\r\nand besieged. Russia proposed a treaty in 1838, whereby Herat was to be\r\ngiven to the Khan of Candahar, on the condition that both of these\r\nAfghan states should acknowledge the suzerainty of Persia: the\r\nfulfilment of the conditions being guaranteed by Russia. This alarmed\r\nSir John M’Neill, at that time British representative at Teheran; he\r\nsuggested to Lord Palmerston that the British should send an army to\r\nsupport Herat, as a means of preventing the falling of the whole of\r\nAfghanistan into the clutches of Russia. Herat was defending itself\r\nbravely, and there might yet be time to save it. The Shah refusing to\r\nlisten to M’Neill’s representations, and various petty matters having\r\ngiven England an excuse to ‘demand satisfaction,’ an expedition was sent\r\nfrom India to the Persian Gulf in the summer of 1838. Nominally a\r\ndispute about Herat, it was really a struggle whether England or Russia\r\nshould acquire most ascendency over the Shah of Persia. Three years of\r\nnegotiation, on various minor grievances and differences, led to a\r\ntreaty between England and Persia in 1841. There then followed many\r\nyears of peace—not, however, unalloyed by troubles. Persia, urged on\r\nsecretly by Russia, continually endeavoured to obtain power in the Herat\r\nterritory; while the oriental vanity of the officials led them into many\r\nbreaches of courtesy towards English envoys, consuls, and merchants. In\r\n1851, it came to the knowledge of Colonel Sheil, at that time British\r\nminister at the court of Teheran, that Persia was quietly preparing for\r\nanother attack on Herat. In spite of Sheil’s remonstrances, the Shah\r\nsent an army against that city in 1852, captured the place, set up a\r\ndependent as subsidiary chief or khan, coined money with his own effigy,\r\nimprisoned and tortured many Afghan chiefs, and formally annexed the\r\nHerat territory as part of the great Persian empire. Colonel Sheil,\r\nfailing in all his endeavours to counteract the policy of the Persian\r\ncourt, sent home to recommend that the British should despatch an\r\nexpedition to the Persian Gulf. Under the influence of English pressure,\r\nthe Shah signed another treaty in 1853—engaging to give up Herat; not to\r\nattack it again unless an attack came previously from the side of Cabool\r\nor Candahar; and to be content with the merely nominal suzerainty which\r\nexisted in the time of the late Khan. The Persians, nevertheless, threw\r\nnumberless obstacles in the way of carrying out this treaty; insomuch\r\nthat Colonel Sheil was engaged in a perpetual angry correspondence with\r\nthem. Faith in treaties is very little understood in Asia; and the court\r\nof Persia is thoroughly Asiatic in this matter. While this wrangle was\r\ngoing on, another embarrassment arose, out of the employment by the Hon.\r\nA. C. Murray, British representative, of a Persian named Mirza Hashem\r\nKhan, against the Shah’s orders. A seizure of Hashem’s wife by the\r\nauthorities was converted by Mr Murray into a national insult, on the\r\nground that Hashem was now in the service, and under the protection, of\r\nthe British crown. Murray struck his flag from the embassy house, until\r\nthe matter should be settled. A most undignified quarrel took place\r\nduring the winter of 1855, and far into 1856—Mr Murray insisting on the\r\nsupreme rights of the British protectorate; and the Persian authorities\r\ndisseminating scandalous stories as to the motives which induced him to\r\nprotect the lady in question.\r\n\r\nThe scene was next transferred to Constantinople; where, early in 1856,\r\nthe Persian minister discussed the matter with Lord Stratford de\r\nRedcliffe, deploring the rupture, and laying all the blame on Mr Murray\r\nand the other British officials. In a memorandum drawn up at Teheran,\r\nfor circulation in the different European courts, M’Neill, Sheil,\r\nMurray—all were stigmatised as mischief-makers, bent on humiliating\r\nPersia, and on disturbing the friendly relations between the Shah and\r\nQueen Victoria. In an autograph document from the Shah himself, Mr\r\nMurray was designated ‘stupid, ignorant, and insane; one who has the\r\naudacity and impudence to insult even kings.’\r\n\r\nBefore this Murray quarrel was ended, hostilities broke out again at\r\nHerat. There were rival parties in that city; there was an attack\r\nthreatened by Dost Mohammed of Cabool; an appeal was made to Persia for\r\naid, by the Khan who at this time ruled Herat; and Persia marched an\r\narmy of 9000 men in that direction. The British government, regarding\r\nthis march as an infringement of the treaty of Herat, demanded the\r\nwithdrawal of the troops, and threatened warlike proceedings if the\r\ndemand were not attended to. The Persians, whether emboldened by secret\r\nencouragement from Russia, or actuated by any other motive, made a\r\npretence of negotiating, but nevertheless proceeded with their\r\nexpedition, captured Ghorian, and laid siege to Herat. Hereupon\r\ninstructions were sent out to the governor-general of India, to prepare\r\na warlike force for service in the Persian Gulf. Before those\r\ninstructions could reach Bombay, Ferukh Khan arrived at Constantinople\r\nwith full powers from the Shah to settle all points of difference\r\nbetween Persia and England. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was empowered to\r\ntreat with this plenipotentiary; they made great advances towards the\r\nsettlement of the terms of a treaty; but while they were discussing (in\r\nNovember), news arrived that the Persians had captured the city of Herat\r\nafter a long siege. This strange confusion between diplomacy at\r\nConstantinople and war at Herat, stringent orders from London and\r\nwarlike alacrity at Bombay, totally disarranged the negotiations of\r\nFerukh Khan and Lord Stratford de Redcliffe; those ministers could do\r\nnothing further. The governor-general declared war against Persia on the\r\n1st of November, and the Persian plenipotentiary left Constantinople for\r\nTeheran in December.\r\n\r\nThus arose the Persian expedition—out of circumstances so complicated,\r\nthat it is difficult to bear in mind the relations of one to another.\r\nThe existence of intrigues among contending parties in the state of\r\nHerat; the frequent strife between the Afghans of Cabool and Candahar\r\nand those of Herat; the well-remembered and never-abandoned claims of\r\nPersia upon the last-named state; the open desire of Russia to obtain a\r\nhold over the Persian court; the concealed desire of the same astute\r\npower to approach nearer and nearer to the gates of India; the anxiety\r\nof England to see Afghanistan remain as a barrier between India and the\r\ncentre of Asia; the tendency of Persia to disregard those courtesies to\r\nwestern nations which oriental potentates have never willingly\r\nconceded—all were concurrent causes in bringing about the British\r\nexpedition to the Persian Gulf in 1856. The most powerful incentive,\r\nprobably, although never acknowledged in diplomatic correspondence, was\r\nthe wish to keep Russia as far as possible away from India.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked, what had the East India Company to do with this\r\nwar? Why was India put to the expense of providing an armament for\r\ninvading Persia? This, in truth, was one of the anomalies connected with\r\nthe ‘double government’ of India. It was a war declared by Lord\r\nPalmerston’s cabinet; but as it was founded on considerations relating\r\nto the safety of India, it was treated as an India war, to be conducted\r\nby the authorities in British India.\r\n\r\nThe providing of the army for the Persian Gulf devolved chiefly upon\r\nLord Elphinstone, as governor of Bombay. The army was in two divisions,\r\none of which left Bombay several weeks before the other. Numerous\r\ntransport-vessels were chartered, besides many of the large\r\nmail-steamers, to carry troops, guns, and stores to the Persian Gulf.\r\nThe commissariat and quarter-masters’ departments had to make great\r\npreparations—a thousand baggage-cattle; fodder for these, for\r\ndraught-bullocks, and for cavalry and artillery horses; framework for\r\nfifteen hospitals; hutting for many thousand soldiers, &c. Means of\r\ntransport had to be provided for most of these, as it would not be safe\r\nto rely on supplies obtained in an enemy’s country.\r\n\r\nGradually, as the troops, guns, and stores reached the shores of Persia,\r\nthe organisation of the force proceeded. It was thus constituted:\r\n\r\n                            FIRST DIVISION.\r\n\r\n                                 { H.M. 64th foot.\r\n           1st Infantry Brigade, { 20th Bombay N.I.\r\n\r\n                                 { 2d Bombay Europeans.\r\n           2d Infantry Brigade,  { 4th Bombay Rifles.\r\n\r\n                                 { 3d Bombay native cavalry.\r\n           Cavalry Brigade,      { Poonah Horse.\r\n\r\n           Artillery Brigade,      Various detachments.\r\n\r\n                           SECOND DIVISION.\r\n\r\n                                 { H.M. 78th Highlanders.\r\n           1st Infantry Brigade, { 26th Bombay N.I.\r\n\r\n                                 { 23d Bombay N.I.\r\n           2d Infantry Brigade,  { Light Batt. B.N.I.\r\n\r\n                                 { H.M. 14th Dragoons.\r\n           Cavalry Brigade,      { Jacob’s Sinde Horse.\r\n\r\n                                 { Troop horse-artillery.\r\n           Artillery Brigade,    { Two field-batteries.\r\n\r\nThe several divisions and brigades were thus commanded: The first\r\ndivision was placed under Major-general Stalker; and the four brigades\r\nof which it consisted were commanded by Brigadiers Wilson, Honner, Tapp,\r\nand Trevelyan. The second division was under Brigadier-general\r\nHavelock—who lived to become so famous in connection with the wars of\r\nthe Indian mutiny; and the four brigades which it comprised were\r\ncommanded by Brigadiers Hamilton, Hale, Steuart, and Hutt.\r\nBrigadier-general Jacob commanded in chief the cavalry of both\r\ndivisions; while Major-general Sir James Outram held supreme command of\r\nthe whole force.\r\n\r\nThe first division, as we have said, preceded the second by several\r\nweeks. General Stalker took his departure from Bombay on the 26th of\r\nNovember, with a fleet of nearly forty vessels under Admiral Sir Henry\r\nLeeke—a few of them war-steamers, but chiefly steam and sailing\r\ntransports, carrying 10,000 soldiers, sailors, and men of all grades and\r\nemployments. Stalker and Leeke, having brought all the troops and stores\r\npast Ormuz and up the Persian Gulf, captured the island of Karrack as a\r\nmilitary depôt, and then effected a landing at Hallila Bay, about twelve\r\nmiles south of Bushire. Although the opposition, from a few hundred\r\nPersian troops, was very insignificant, the landing was nevertheless a\r\nslow process, occupying three days and two nights—owing chiefly to the\r\nabsence of any other boats than those belonging to the ships. There\r\nbeing no draught-cattle landed at that time, the troops were without\r\ntents or baggage of any kind; they therefore carried three days’ rations\r\nin their haversacks. After being thus engaged on the 7th of December and\r\ntwo following days, Stalker and Leeke advanced towards Bushire—the one\r\nwith the troops along the shore, the other with the fleet at easy\r\ndistance. Bushire is an important commercial town on the northeast side\r\nof the gulf; whoever commands it, commands much of the trade of Persia.\r\nStalker found the defences to be far stronger than he had anticipated.\r\nOn the 9th he dislodged a body of Persian troops from a strong position\r\nthey occupied in the old Dutch fort of Reshire. On the 10th, after a\r\nshort bombardment, Bushire itself surrendered—with a promptness which\r\nshewed how few soldierly qualities were possessed by the garrison; for\r\nthe place contained sixty-five guns, with a large store of warlike\r\nsupplies. The governor of the city, and the commander of the troops,\r\ncame out and delivered up their swords. The troops of the garrison,\r\nabout two thousand in number, having marched out and delivered up their\r\narms, were escorted by cavalry to a distance, and then set free. By the\r\nevening of the 11th the tents and cooking-utensils were landed; and an\r\nintrenched camp was formed outside Bushire as a temporary resting-place\r\nfor the force—sufficient detachments being told off to hold the city and\r\nfort safely. So entirely had the expedition been kept secret from the\r\nPersians, that when, on the 29th of November, the first vessels of the\r\nfleet hove in sight, the governor of Bushire sent to Mr Consul Jones to\r\nask what it meant; and he only then learned that our army and navy had\r\ncome to capture the city. This plan was adopted, to obtain a ‘material\r\nguarantee’ sufficiently serious to influence the double-dealing Persian\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHere the troops remained for several weeks. The second division, and the\r\nreal head of the force, had not arrived; and General Stalker was not\r\nexpected or authorised to undertake anything further at present. His\r\ncamp, about a mile from Bushire, assumed every day a more orderly\r\nappearance; and steady trading transactions were carried on with the\r\ntowns-people. The transport ships went to and fro between Bushire and\r\nBombay, bringing guns and supplies of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThe political relations between the two countries, meanwhile, remained\r\nas indefinite as before. Mr Murray came from Bagdad to Bushire, to\r\nconfer with the military and naval leaders on all necessary matters, and\r\nto negotiate with the Shah’s government if favourable opportunity for so\r\ndoing should offer. Herat remained in the hands of its conquerors, the\r\nPersians. Sir John Lawrence, in his capacity as chief authority in the\r\nPunjaub, held more than one interview with Dost Mohammed, Khan of\r\nCabool, in order to keep that wily leader true to his alliance with\r\nEngland; and it was considered a fair probability that if Persia did not\r\nyield to England’s demands, a second expedition would be sent from the\r\nPunjaub and Sinde through Afghanistan to Herat.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the last week in January, 1857, that Sir James Outram\r\nand his staff reached the Persian Gulf; nearly all the infantry had\r\npreceded him, but much of the artillery and cavalry had yet to come. Sir\r\nJames sighted Bushire on the 30th; and General Stalker, long encamped\r\noutside the town, made prompt preparations for his reception. Outram was\r\ndesirous of instant action. Stalker had been stationary, not because\r\nthere was nothing to do, but because his resources were inadequate to\r\nany extensive operations. Shiraz, the most important city in that part\r\nof Persia, lying nearly due east of Bushire, is connected with it by two\r\nroads, one through Ferozabad, and the other through Kisht and Kazeroon;\r\nthe Persians were rumoured to have 20,000 men guarding the first of\r\nthese two roads, and a smaller number guarding the second. These reports\r\nwere afterwards proved to be greatly exaggerated; but Sir James\r\ndetermined that, at any rate, there should be no longer sojourn at\r\nBushire than was absolutely needed.\r\n\r\nInformation having arrived that a large body of Persians was at the foot\r\nof the nearest hills, Outram resolved to dislodge them. The troops were\r\nunder Soojah-ool-Moolk, governor of Shiraz, and formed the nucleus of a\r\nlarger force intended for the recapture of Bushire. Leaving the town to\r\nbe guarded by seamen from the ships, and the camp by about 1500 soldiers\r\nunder Colonel Shephard, with the _Euphrates_ so moored that her guns\r\ncould command the approaches—Outram started on the 3d of February, with\r\nabout 4600 men and 18 guns. He took no tents or extra clothing; but gave\r\nto each soldier a greatcoat, a blanket, and two days’ rations; while the\r\ncommissariat provided three more days’ rations. He marched round the\r\nhead of Bushire creek to Char-kota, and on the 5th came suddenly upon\r\nthe enemy’s camp, which they had precipitately abandoned when they heard\r\nof his approach. This was near the town of Borasjoon, on the road to\r\nShiraz. On the next two days he secured large stores of ammunition,\r\ncarriages, camp-equipage, stores, grain, rice, horses, and\r\ncattle—everything but guns; these had been safely carried off by the\r\nenemy to the difficult pass of Mhak, in the mountains lying between\r\nBushire and Shiraz; and as Sir James had not made any extensive\r\ncommissariat arrangements, he did not deem it prudent to follow them at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 7th, Outram began his march back to Bushire—after\r\ndestroying nearly twenty tons of powder, and vast quantities of shot and\r\nshell; and after securing as booty such flour, grain, rice, and stores\r\nas belonged to the government rather than to the villagers. But now\r\noccurred a most unexpected event. The Persian cavalry, which retreated\r\nwhile Outram had been advancing, resolved to attack while he was\r\nretreating. They approached soon after midnight; and the British were\r\nsoon enveloped in a skirmishing fire with an enemy whom they could not\r\nsee. Outram fell from his horse, and Stalker had to take the command for\r\na time. The enemy having brought four guns within accurate range, the\r\nposition was for a time very serious. Stalker was enabled by degrees to\r\nget the regiments into array, so as to grapple with the enemy as soon as\r\ndaylight should point out their position. When at length, on the morning\r\nof the 8th, the British saw the Persians, seven or eight thousand\r\nstrong, drawn up in order near the walled village of Khoosh-aub, they\r\ndashed at them at once with cavalry and horse-artillery, so irresistibly\r\nthat the plain was soon strewed with dead bodies; the enemy fled\r\npanic-stricken in all directions; and if Outram’s cavalry had been more\r\nnumerous (he had barely 500 sabres), he could almost have annihilated\r\nthe Persian infantry. By ten o’clock all was over, the Persians leaving\r\ntwo guns and all their ammunition in the hands of the British. In the\r\nevening Outram resumed his march, and re-entered Bushire during the\r\nnight of the 9th. His troops had marched ninety miles over ground\r\nconverted into a swamp by heavy rains, and had seized a camp and won a\r\nbattle, in a little more than six days. In a ‘Field-force Order,’ issued\r\non February 10th, and signed by Colonel (afterwards Sir Edward) Lugard\r\nas chief of the staff, Outram warmly complimented his troops on this\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nAfter this dashing affair at Khoosh-aub, the patience of Sir James was\r\nsorely tried by a long period of comparative inactivity—occasioned in\r\npart by the rainy state of the weather, and in part by the non-arrival\r\nof some of the artillery and cavalry, without which his further\r\noperations would necessarily be much impeded. Brigadier-general Havelock\r\narrived about this time, and took command of the second division, which\r\nhad hitherto been under a substitute. The feeding of the army had become\r\na difficult matter; for the Persian traders came in less readily after\r\nthe battle of Khoosh-aub. Rumours gradually spread in the camp that an\r\nexpedition was shortly to be sent out to Mohamrah, a town near the\r\nconfluence of the Euphrates and the Karoon, about three days’ sail up\r\nfrom Bushire; these rumours gave pleasurable excitement to the troops,\r\nwho were becoming somewhat wearied of their Bushire encampment. Much had\r\nyet to be done, however, before the expedition could start; the\r\nnorthwest winds in the gulf delayed the arrival of the ships containing\r\nthe cavalry and artillery. On the 4th of March, Sir James made public\r\nhis plan. General Stalker was to remain at Bushire, with Brigadiers\r\nWilson, Honner, and Tapp, in command of about 3000 men of all arms;\r\nwhile Outram and Havelock, with several of the brigadiers, at the head\r\nof 4000 troops, were to make an expedition to Mohamrah, where many\r\nfortifications were reported to have been recently thrown up, and where\r\n10,000 or 12,000 Persian troops were assembled. During many days\r\ntroop-ships were going up the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates—some\r\nconveying the troops already at Bushire; and others conveying cavalry\r\nand artillery as fast as they arrived from Bombay. The enemy eagerly\r\nwatched these movements from the shore, but ventured on no molestation.\r\n\r\nDuring the three weeks occupied by these movements, events of an almost\r\nunprecedented character occurred at Bushire—the suicide of two British\r\nofficers who dreaded the responsibility of the duties devolving upon\r\nthem. These officers were—Major-general Stalker, commanding the first\r\ndivision of the army; and Commodore Ethersey, who had been placed in\r\ncommand of the Indian navy in the Persian Gulf when Sir Henry Leeke\r\nreturned to Bombay. Stalker shot himself on the 14th of March. On that\r\nmorning, Sir James Outram and Commander Jones had breakfasted with him\r\nin his tent. He displayed no especial despondency; but it had been\r\nbefore remarked how distressed he appeared on the subject of the want of\r\nbarrack-accommodation for his troops—fearing lest he should be held\r\nresponsible if the soldiers, during the heat of the approaching summer,\r\nsuffered through want of shelter. On one or two other subjects he\r\nappeared unable to bear the burden of command; he dreaded lest Outram,\r\nby exposing himself to danger in any approaching conflict, might lose\r\nhis life, and thereby leave the whole weight of the duty and\r\nresponsibility on him (Stalker). Shortly after breakfast, a shot was\r\nheard in the tent, and the unfortunate general was found weltering in\r\nhis blood. Commodore Ethersey followed this sad example three days\r\nafterwards. For three months he had been labouring under anxiety and\r\ndespondency, haunted by a perpetual apprehension that neither his mental\r\nnor physical powers would bear up under the weight of responsibility\r\nincurred by the charge of the Indian navy during the forthcoming\r\noperations. Memoranda in his diary afforded full proof of this. An entry\r\non the day after Stalker’s suicide ran thus: ‘Heard of poor Stalker’s\r\nmelancholy death. His case is similar to my own. He felt he was unequal\r\nto the responsibility imposed on him.... I have had a wretched night.’\r\nSo deep had been his despondency for some time, and so frequently\r\nexpressed to those around him, that the news of his suicide on the 17th\r\nexcited less surprise than pain.\r\n\r\nIt had been Outram’s intention to proceed against Mohamrah directly\r\nafter his return from Borasjoon and Khoosh-aub; but the unexpected and\r\nvexing delays above adverted to prevented him from setting forth until\r\nthe 18th of March. He was aware that the Persians had for three months\r\nbeen strengthening the fortifications of that place; he knew that the\r\nopposite bank of the river was on Turkish ground (Mesopotamia), on which\r\nhe would not be permitted to erect batteries; and he therefore\r\nanticipated a tough struggle before he could master Mohamrah. His plan\r\nwas, to attack the enemy’s batteries with armed steamers and\r\nsloops-of-war; and then, when the fire had slackened, to tow up the\r\ntroops in boats by small steamers, land them at a selected point, and at\r\nonce proceed to attack the enemy’s camp. The Persian army, 13,000\r\nstrong, was commanded by the Shahzada, Prince Mirza. Outram’s force was\r\nrather under 5000, including only 400 cavalry: the rest having been left\r\nto guard Bushire and the encampment. Outram and Havelock arrived near\r\nMohamrah on the 24th, and immediately began to place the war-ships in\r\narray, and to plant mortars on rafts in the river. On the 26th, the\r\nships and mortars opened a furious fire; under cover of which the troops\r\nwere towed up the river, and landed at a spot northward of the town and\r\nits batteries. The Persians, who had felt the utmost confidence that the\r\nlanding of a British force, in the face of thirteen thousand men and a\r\nformidable array of batteries, would be an impossibility, were\r\npanic-stricken at this audacity. When, at about two o’clock, Outram\r\nadvanced from the landing-place through date-groves and across a plain\r\nto the enemy’s camp, the Persians fled precipitately, after exploding\r\ntheir largest magazine—leaving behind them all their tents, several\r\nmagazines of ammunition, seventeen guns, baggage, and a vast amount of\r\npublic and private stores. As Outram had, at that hour, been able to\r\nland not even one hundred cavalry, he could effect little in the way of\r\npursuit; the Persians made off, strewing the ground with arms and\r\naccoutrements which they abandoned in their hurry. Commodore Young\r\ncommanded the naval portion of this expedition, having succeeded the\r\nunfortunate Ethersey.\r\n\r\nThis action of Mohamrah scarcely deserved the name of a battle; for as\r\nsoon as the ships and mortars had, by their firing, enabled the troops\r\nto land, the enemy ran away. Outram had scarcely any cavalry, and his\r\ninfantry had no fighting—rather to their disappointment. The Persians\r\nhaving retreated up the river Karoon towards Ahwaz, Outram resolved to\r\nsend three small armed steamers after them, each carrying a hundred\r\ninfantry. Captain Rennie started on the 29th, in command of this\r\nflotilla: his instructions being, ‘to steam up to Ahwaz, and act with\r\ndiscretion according to circumstances.’ He proceeded thirty miles that\r\nday, anchored at night, landed, and found the remains of a bivouac. On\r\nthe 30th he reached Ismailiyeh, and on the 31st Oomarra. Arriving near\r\nAhwaz on the 1st of April, Rennie came up with the Persian army which\r\nhad retreated from Mohamrah. Nothing daunted, he landed his little force\r\nof 300 men, advanced to the town, entered it, and allayed the fears of\r\nthe inhabitants; while the Persians, thirty or forty times his number,\r\nretreated further northward towards Shuster, with scarcely any attempt\r\nto disturb him—such was the panic into which the affair at Mohamrah had\r\nthrown them. Captain Rennie, having had the satisfaction of putting to\r\nflight a large Persian army with a handful of 300 British, and having\r\ngiven to the inhabitants of Ahwaz such stores of government grain and\r\nflour as he could seize, embarked a quantity of arms, sheep, and mules,\r\nwhich he had captured, and steamed back to Mohamrah—earning and\r\nreceiving the thanks of the general for his management of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nJust at this period a most sudden and unexpected event put an end to the\r\noperations. Captain Rennie’s expedition returned to Mohamrah on the 4th\r\nof April; and on the 5th arrived news that peace had been signed between\r\nEngland and Persia. Outram’s army, European and native, was rapidly\r\napproaching 14,000 men; such a force, under such a leader, might have\r\nmarched from one end of Persia to the other; and both officers and\r\nsoldiers had begun to have bright anticipations of honour, and perhaps\r\nof prize-money. It was with something like disappointment, therefore,\r\nthat the news of the treaty was listened to; there had not been fighting\r\nenough to whet the appetites of the heroic; while soldiers generally\r\nwould fain make a treaty at the sword’s point, rather than see it done\r\nin the bureaux of diplomatists. Captain Hunt of the 78th Highlanders,\r\nwho was concerned in the operations at Mohamrah and Ahwaz, and who wrote\r\na volume descriptive of the whole campaign, told very frankly of the\r\ndissatisfaction in the camp: ‘The news of peace with Persia having been\r\nsigned at Paris on the 4th of March damped the elation of all, and\r\nconsiderable disgust was felt at this abrupt termination to what had\r\npromised to prove a brilliant campaign.’\r\n\r\nHow and where the treaty of peace was concluded, we must now shew, in\r\nconnection with the proceedings of ministers, legislators, and\r\nambassadors.\r\n\r\nWhen the Persian expedition was determined on, parliament was not\r\nsitting, and no legislative sanction for the war could be obtained; but\r\nwhen the session opened in February 1857, the policy of the government\r\nwas severely canvassed. Ministers were charged with involving the\r\ncountry in a war, without the nation itself being acquainted with the\r\ncauses, or even consulted at all in the matter. The Earl of Clarendon\r\nexplained the course of events at considerable length. He went into the\r\ncase of Mr Murray, and the quarrel with the Persian government on\r\nmatters of diplomatic etiquette—justifying that envoy in all that he had\r\ndone. But the earl was particular in his assertions that the Murray\r\ndispute was not the cause of the war. The siege and capture of Herat\r\nfurnished the _casus belli_. He dwelt on the immense value of that city\r\nas a military station. ‘Herat is altogether a most important place for\r\nmilitary operations; and an enemy once in possession of it is completely\r\nmaster of the position. Every government of this country has desired\r\nthat Afghanistan should be protected; and it clearly cannot be protected\r\nif Herat remains in the power of Persia.’ He expressed a conviction that\r\n‘the Russian government and the whole of the Russian people are under a\r\nbelief that their destiny is to go forward, to conquer, and to hold new\r\nterritory;’ and that this disposition would be greatly tempted if\r\nPersia, backed up by Russia, were permitted to seize Herat. He stated\r\nfinally that the Persian ambassador at Paris had recently expressed a\r\nwish to renew negotiations for peace, and that the British government\r\nwould willingly listen to any overtures for that purpose. Lord\r\nPalmerston gave similar explanations in the House of Commons. The Earls\r\nof Derby and Malmesbury, Earl Grey, Lord John Russell, Mr Gladstone, and\r\nMr Disraeli, all spoke disparagingly of the Persian expedition—either\r\nbecause it was not necessary; or because, if necessary, parliamentary\r\npermission for it ought to have been obtained. The latter was the strong\r\npoint of opposition; many members asserted, not only that the nation was\r\ninvolved in a new war without its own consent, but that no one could\r\nunderstand whether war had been declared by the Crown or by the East\r\nIndia Company. Earl Grey moved an amendment condemnatory of the\r\nministerial policy; but this was negatived. The ministers declined to\r\nproduce the diplomatic correspondence at that time, because there was a\r\nhope of renewed negotiations with Furukh Khan at Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the close of February it became known to the public that the East\r\nIndia Company had, not unnaturally, demurred to the incidence of the\r\nexpenses of the Persian war on their revenues. It appeared that, so\r\nearly as the 22d of October the Court of Directors had written to the\r\npresident of the Board of Control—adverting to ‘the expedition for\r\nforeign service preparing at Bombay, under the orders (it is presumed)\r\nof her Majesty’s government, communicated through the Secret Committee;’\r\nand suggesting for his consideration ‘how far it may be just and proper\r\nto subject India to the whole of the charges consequent on those\r\norders.’ The directors, as a governing body, had no voice whatever in\r\ndetermining on the Persian war; and yet their soldiers and sailors were\r\nto take part in it, and the Indian revenues to bear all or part of the\r\nburden. It was ultimately decided that England should pay one-half of\r\nthe expenses, the other half being borne by the Company out of the\r\nrevenues of India.\r\n\r\nBefore the British public could learn one single fact connected with the\r\nlanding of Sir James Outram or of the second division in Persia, they\r\nwere surprised by the announcement that Lord Cowley and Furukh Khan had\r\nsucceeded in coming to terms of pacification at Paris—the Persian\r\nambassador having received from his sovereign large powers for this\r\npurpose. A provisional treaty was signed on the 4th of March, of which\r\nthe following is a condensed summary: Peace to be restored between\r\nEngland and Persia—British troops to evacuate Persia as soon as certain\r\nconditions should be complied with—All prisoners of war to be released\r\non both sides—The Shah to give an amnesty to any of his subjects who\r\nmight have been compromised by and during the war—The Shah to withdraw\r\nall his troops from Herat and Afghanistan within three months after the\r\nratification of the treaty—The Shah to renounce all claim upon Herat or\r\nany other Afghan state, whether for sovereignty or for tribute—In any\r\nfuture quarrel between Persia and the Afghan khans, England to be\r\nappealed to as a friendly mediator—England to display equal justice to\r\nPersia and Afghanistan, in the event of any such appeal—Persia to have\r\nthe power of declaring and maintaining war against any Afghan state in\r\nthe event of positive insult or injury; but not to make such war a\r\npretext for annexation or permanent occupation—Persia to liberate all\r\nAfghan prisoners, on condition of Persian prisoners being released by\r\nAfghans—All trading arrangements between England and Persia, in relation\r\nto consuls, ports, customs, &c., to be on an equal and friendly\r\nfooting—The British mission, on its return to Teheran, to be received\r\nwith due honours and ceremonials—Two commissioners to be named by the\r\ntwo courts, to adjudicate on British pecuniary claims against Persia—The\r\nBritish government to renounce all claim to any ‘protection’ over the\r\nShah’s subjects against the Shah’s consent, provided no such power be\r\ngiven to [Russia or] any other court—England and Persia to aid each\r\nother in suppressing the slave-trade in the Persian Gulf—A portion of\r\nthe English troops to remain on Persian soil until Herat should be\r\nevacuated by the Persians, but without any expense, and with as little\r\nannoyance as possible, to the Persian government—Ratifications to be\r\nexchanged at Bagdad within three months.\r\n\r\nThis treaty—which, if faithfully carried out, would certainly debar\r\nPersia from any undue interference with Afghan affairs—was signed at\r\nParis on the very day (March 4th) when Sir James Outram announced to his\r\ntroops at Bushire the intended attack on Mohamrah. Such was one of the\r\nanomalies springing from diplomacy at one place and war at another many\r\nthousand miles distant. Furukh Khan proceeded, on the 19th from Paris to\r\nLondon, where he was received by Queen Victoria as plenipotentiary\r\nextraordinary from the Shah of Persia, and where the arrangements for\r\nthe fulfilment of the treaty were further carried out. The treaty having\r\nbeen forwarded to Teheran, was ratified by the Shah of Persia on the\r\n14th of April, and the ratification arrived at Bagdad on the 17th. The\r\nEnglish nation was still, as it had been from the beginning, without the\r\nmeans of judging whether the Persian war had been necessary or not; the\r\ngovernment still withheld the state papers, on the ground that, as the\r\nratification of the treaty would speedily be effected, it would be\r\nbetter to wait until then. When, later in the year, the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer asked the House of Commons for a vote of half a million\r\nsterling, ‘on account of the expenses of the Persian war,’ many members\r\nprotested against the vote, on the ground that parliament had not been\r\nconsulted in any way concerning the war. On the 16th of July Mr Roebuck\r\nmoved a resolution—‘That the war with Persia was declared, prosecuted,\r\nand concluded without information of such transactions being\r\ncommunicated to parliament; while expensive armaments were equipped\r\nwithout the sanction of a vote of this House; and that such conduct\r\ntends to weaken its just authority, and to dispense with its\r\nconstitutional control over the finances of the country, and renders it\r\nrequisite for this House to express its strong reprobation of such a\r\ncourse of proceeding.’ The government policy was censured on many\r\ngrounds by Mr Roebuck, Lord John Russell, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Disraeli;\r\nthe first of these speakers even went so far as to attribute the mutiny\r\nin India to the withdrawal of troops for the Persian war. The House of\r\nCommons agreed, however, pretty generally in the opinion, that although\r\nthe ministers might reasonably have been more communicative before they\r\ncommenced hostilities with Persia, there was ground sufficient for the\r\nhostilities themselves; and the resolution was negatived by 352 to 38.\r\nThe question was reopened on the 17th, when the House granted the\r\nhalf-million asked by the Chancellor of the Exchequer towards defraying\r\nthe expenses of this war; renewed attacks were made on the Asiatic\r\npolicy of the Palmerston government, but the vote was agreed to; and\r\nnothing further occurred, during the remainder of the session, to\r\ndisturb the terms of the pacification.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to trace the course of events in Persia after the\r\nratification of the treaty. The British officers, and the troops under\r\ntheir charge, had no further glory or honour to acquire; they would be\r\ncalled upon simply, either to remain quietly in Persia until Herat was\r\nevacuated, or to go through the troublesome ordeal of re-shipment back\r\nto Bombay. The troops all assembled in and near Bushire, where they\r\nresumed their former camp-life. The officers, having little to do, took\r\noccasional trips to Bassorah, Bagdad, and other places on the banks of\r\nthe Euphrates and Tigris; while the soldiers were employed in destroying\r\nthe fortifications of the encampment, now no longer needed. On the 9th\r\nof May Sir James Outram issued a ‘Field-force Order’—thanking the troops\r\nfor their services during this brief and rather uneventful war, and\r\nannouncing the break-up of the force. Some of the regiments and corps\r\nwere to return to India, as rapidly as means of transport could be\r\nobtained for them; while the rest, under Brigadier-general Jacob, were\r\nto form a small compact army, to remain at Bushire until all the terms\r\nof the treaty were fulfilled. Outram, Havelock, and a large number of\r\nofficers, embarked within a few days for India; and by the time they\r\nreached Bombay and Madras, according to the place to which they were\r\nbound, the startling news reached their ears that a military mutiny had\r\nbroken out at Meerut and Delhi. What followed, the pages of this volume\r\nhave shewn. As to Persia, much delay occurred in carrying out the terms\r\nof the treaty, much travelling to and fro of envoys, and many months’\r\ndetention of British troops at Bushire; but at length the Persians\r\nevacuated Herat, the British quitted the Gulf, and the singular ‘Persian\r\nwar,’ marked by so few battles, came to an end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUSHIRE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n          § 2. THE CHINESE AND JAPANESE EXPEDITIONS, 1856-7-8.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences westward of India having thus been briefly narrated,\r\nattention may now be directed to those on the east.\r\n\r\nViewed in relation to the circumstances which immediately preceded\r\nhostilities, it might almost be said that England declared war against\r\nChina because a few persons went on board a small vessel to search for\r\ncertain offenders, and because a Chinese official would not civilly\r\nreceive visits from a British official. These trifling incidents,\r\nhowever, were regarded as symptoms of something greater: symptoms which\r\nrequired close diplomatic watching. To understand this matter, a brief\r\nsummary of earlier events is needed.\r\n\r\nDuring the first thirty years of the present century, in like manner as\r\nin earlier centuries, Europeans had no recognised right of residing in\r\nChina, or even of visiting its ports. Merchants were allowed to reside\r\nat Canton, by official connivance rather than sanction; and even this\r\nwas possible only at certain times of the year—they being required in\r\nother months to retire to Macao. They were liable to be expelled from\r\nCanton at any time, with or without assigned cause; their trade was\r\nliable to be stopped with equal suddenness; and, under the designation\r\nof ‘barbarians,’ all negotiation was denied to them except through the\r\nmedium of a mercantile community called the Hong merchants. During many\r\nyears, Indian opium was the chief commodity sold by the English to the\r\nChinese, in exchange for tea and other produce. This opium-trade was\r\nalways declared illegal by the Chinese government, though always\r\ncovertly favoured by the Chinese officials. Quarrels frequently arose\r\nconcerning this trade, and the quarrels sometimes ended in violence. The\r\nimport of opium became so large that the exports were insufficient to\r\npay for it; and when silver was thus found necessary to make up the\r\nbalance, the imperial anger waxed stronger and stronger. The\r\n‘barbarians’ were commanded not to bring any more opium; but, finding\r\nthe trade too profitable to be abandoned, they continued their dealings\r\nin spite of the mandates of the celestial potentate.\r\n\r\nThe year 1831 may be said to have commenced the political or\r\ninternational stage of this difficulty. The governor-general of India\r\nwrote a letter to the governor of Canton, complaining of the conduct of\r\nthe Chinese authorities, and demanding explanations, &c. Why his\r\nlordship, rather than any functionary in England, did this, was because\r\nthe East India Company in those days sold opium on its own account, and\r\nmade use of its political power to render that trade as profitable as\r\npossible—one of the pernicious anomalies arising out of the Company’s\r\ndouble functions. In 1832, the governor of Canton vouchsafed a partial\r\nexplanation, but only to the Hong merchants—refusing with superb scorn,\r\nto communicate either with the Company’s merchants, or with the\r\ngovernor-general. In 1833 an imperial edict forbade the introduction of\r\nopium; but this, like many that preceded it, remained inoperative. In\r\n1834 the Company’s trading monopoly ceasing, private merchants thereupon\r\nengaged in the tea-trade with China. The English government sent three\r\ncommissioners—Lord Napier, Mr (afterwards Sir) J. F. Davis, and Sir G.\r\nB. Robinson—as ‘superintendents of British commerce in China.’ The\r\nChinese authorities refused to acknowledge these commissioners in any\r\nway, in spite of numerous invitations; while on the other hand the\r\ncommissioners refused to retire from Canton to Macao. These disputes led\r\nto violence, and the violence brought a British ship-of-war up the\r\nCanton river. A compromise was the result—the commissioners retiring to\r\nMacao, and the Chinese authorities allowing the resumption of the\r\nopium-traffic. Lord Napier died towards the close of the year, and was\r\nsucceeded as chief-superintendent by Mr Davis—Captain Elliot being\r\nappointed secretary, and afterwards third superintendent. During the\r\nnext three years trade continued; but the Chinese officials were\r\nuniformly rude and insulting. The British government would not permit\r\nCaptain Elliot to submit to these indignities; missives and\r\ncounter-missives passed to and fro; and the year 1837 ended with\r\nthreatening symptoms. In 1838 Admiral Maitland arrived in Canton river\r\nwith a ship of war, to protect British interests—by cannon-balls, if not\r\nby friendly compact. The nearest approach to equality between the two\r\nnations was in an interview between Admiral Maitland and the Chinese\r\nAdmiral Kwan; in which Maitland assured his brother-admiral that he\r\nwould remain peaceful—until provoked. In 1839, as in previous years, the\r\nopium-trade was often violently interrupted by the Chinese authorities.\r\nThe officers of the English government, political and naval, were placed\r\nin an embarrassing position in this matter; their duty was to protect\r\nEnglishmen; but they could not compel the Chinese to trade in opium—for\r\nthe Chinese government held the same power as all other despotic\r\ngovernments, of prohibiting or encouraging trade with other countries.\r\nIn this year, when Maitland was absent, Elliot became powerless at\r\nCanton; he and all the English were made prisoners, and could not obtain\r\nrelease until they had destroyed all the opium in the English\r\nstores—more than twenty thousand chests. This was done: Elliot\r\nguaranteeing that the English government would repay the merchants.\r\nCommissioner Lin saw that the opium was wholly destroyed; and by the end\r\nof May almost every European had quitted Canton.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that commenced the first Chinese war—a war which had a bad\r\nmoral basis on the English side; since it arose more out of the forced\r\nsale of an intoxicating drug, than out of any other circumstance. The\r\nBritish government, finding themselves bound by Captain Elliot’s promise\r\nto pay an enormous sum for the opium destroyed, and feeling the\r\nimportance of maintaining British supremacy in the east, resolved to\r\nsettle the quarrel by warlike means. Fighting and negotiating alternated\r\nduring 1840 and the two following years. At one time, Sir Gordon Bremer,\r\nat another, Sir Hugh Gough, commanded troops on the Chinese coast,\r\nacting in conjunction with ships-of-war; and according to the amount of\r\nnaval or military success, so did the Chinese authorities manifest or\r\nnot a disposition to treat. Commissioner Lin, then Commissioner Keshen,\r\nand afterwards Commissioner Key-ing, conducted negotiations—a perilous\r\nduty; for their imperial master did not scruple to punish, or even to\r\nput to death, those diplomatists who made a treaty distasteful to him;\r\nand nothing but the noise of cannon induced him to respect treaties when\r\nmade. The chief military and naval events of the three years, in\r\nconnection with this struggle, were the following: The British ship\r\n_Hellas_ attacked by junks, and many of the crew killed; an attempt to\r\nburn the British fleet by fire-rafts; Chusan taken by the English; naval\r\naction near Macao; attack and capture of Chuen-pe and Tae-cok-tow;\r\nHong-kong taken by the English; the Bogue forts, with 460 guns, taken by\r\nSir Gordon Bremer; Canton attacked by the British, under Sir Hugh Gough,\r\nand only spared on the prompt payment of five million dollars; Amoy,\r\nwith 300 guns, taken by the British; the cities of Ting-hae, Ching-hae,\r\nNing-po, and several others on the coast, captured; several military\r\nengagements in the vicinity of the captured cities; an advance of a\r\npowerful squadron up the Yang-tsze-kiang; and a threatening of the great\r\ncity of Nankin, which brought the emperor effectually to terms—all the\r\nprevious offers of negotiation on the part of the Chinese having been\r\nmere expedients to save time.\r\n\r\nThe war ended thuswise. Sir Henry Pottinger arrived in the Chinese\r\nwaters in April 1842, with full power as representative of the British\r\nCrown; and it was he who procured the important ‘Treaty of Nankin,’\r\nsigned by the respective plenipotentiaries in 1842, and the\r\nratifications exchanged by the respective sovereigns in 1843. This\r\ntreaty having had an important bearing on the later or second war with\r\nChina, we will epitomise a few of its chief conditions: Lasting peace\r\nand friendship established between England and China—China to pay\r\n21,000,000 dollars for the opium destroyed, and for the expenses of the\r\nwar; the payments to be spread over four years—The ports of Canton,\r\nAmoy, Fuh-choo-foo, Ning-po, and Shang-hae, to be thrown open to British\r\nmerchants, with consular facilities, and just and regular tariffs—The\r\nisland of Hong-kong to become a permanent British possession—All British\r\nsubjects, at that time confined in China, to be at once and\r\nunconditionally released—The Chinese emperor to give an amnesty to all\r\nhis own subjects, in respect of any proceedings on their part friendly\r\nto the British—Correspondence in future to be conducted on terms of\r\nperfect equality between the officers of the two governments—The islands\r\nof Chusan and Kulangsoo to be held by the British until the fulfilment\r\nof all the conditions of the treaty, and then given up.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this Treaty of Nankin, trade rapidly extended\r\nbetween England and China. Instead of being confined to Canton, and\r\nconducted in a stealthy and undignified manner, it was openly carried on\r\nat five ports. The British government did not undertake to protect the\r\nopium-trade more than that in any other commodity; on the contrary, the\r\nrepresentatives of the English government would gladly have seen that\r\ntrade diminish; but in truth, the East India Company realised several\r\nmillions sterling a year profit by it, and English merchants reaped many\r\nadditional millions: insomuch that a very powerful influence was brought\r\nto back up this trade.\r\n\r\nA ‘Supplementary Treaty’ was signed in October 1843, for regulating the\r\nterms of commercial intercourse at the five ports, and providing for the\r\ncourteous reception of British representatives by the Chinese officials,\r\nin matters relating to mutual trade. During the thirteen years following\r\nthe signature of the Treaty of Nankin, the trade between England and\r\nChina gradually increased, though not at so rapid a rate as had been\r\nhoped by British manufacturers and merchants. The English had trading\r\nestablishments, with consuls and other officials, at the five ports, and\r\na colony or military settlement at Hong-kong; while there were always a\r\nfew ships-of-war in the Chinese waters. The relations, however, were not\r\nwholly peaceful. The inhabitants of Canton had a general ill-will\r\ntowards the English; so had the imperial viceroy; and violence arising\r\nout of this ill-will led to a brief period of hostilities. In April\r\n1847, the English seized the Bogue Forts, in the Canton river, in order\r\nto obtain redress for various insults; this seizure was followed by a\r\nnew convention.\r\n\r\nThus matters continued until October 1856. On the 8th of that month, an\r\nincident occurred, trivial in itself, which gave rise to the ‘Second War\r\nwith China.’ Sir John Bowring was at that time chief representative of\r\nBritish interests in China, with Hong-kong as his head-quarters; Admiral\r\nSir Michael Seymour commanded the royal ships in those seas; Commodore\r\nElliot was under Seymour in the Canton and Hong-kong district; and Mr\r\nParkes was consul at Canton. These were the English officials more\r\nimmediately concerned in the matter. On the day here named, a Chinese\r\nofficer and a party of soldiers boarded a _lorcha_ or small vessel\r\ncalled the _Arrow_, anchored off Canton; and then seized twelve out of\r\nfourteen of the crew, bound them, and carried them away. The _Arrow_ had\r\na colonial register from the governor of Hong-kong, which placed it\r\nunder British protection; the master, an Englishman, protested against\r\nthe seizure, but was not listened to. The British flag, too, was hauled\r\ndown from the lorcha. This was the statement on the part of the British.\r\nMost of the accusations, however, were stoutly denied by the officials\r\nof Canton, who asserted that the lorcha was Chinese, that the owner was\r\nChinese, that the crew were Chinese, and that the boarding was effected\r\nsimply to take into custody men who had committed some offence against\r\nChinese laws.\r\n\r\nWhen the seizure of the men from the _Arrow_ became known, Mr Parkes\r\nremonstrated with the Chinese officer, on the ground that the crew were\r\nunder British protection. No notice being taken of this remonstrance, Mr\r\nParkes communicated with the highest dignitary in that part of China,\r\nwhose name was Yeh Mingchin, and whose office was variously designated\r\nimperial commissioner, governor, and viceroy. The letter sent by Parkes\r\nto this functionary demanded that the twelve men should be brought back\r\nto the lorcha by the same officer who had taken them away, that an\r\napology should be made, and an assurance given that the British flag\r\nshould in future be respected. The men were sent back, after much\r\nnegotiation; but Mr Parkes complained that the return ‘was not made in\r\nthe public manner which had marked the seizure, and that all appearance\r\nof an apology was pointedly avoided.’ The facts were communicated to Sir\r\nJohn Bowring, and by him to Admiral Seymour. No real injury had been\r\ndone, for the men had been reinstated; but there was an insult, which\r\nthe English representatives conceived themselves bound to resent. They\r\nhad often been piqued at the absence of respect shewn by the officers of\r\nthe Celestial Empire, and were willing to avail themselves of any\r\nreasonable opportunity for bringing about a more diplomatic state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe first act of war occurred on the part of the British. Sir John\r\nBowring recommended to the admiral the seizure of a Chinese junk or\r\nwar-boat, as a probable mode of bringing an apology. Sir Michael\r\naccordingly directed Commodore Elliot, of the _Sybille_, to carry out\r\nBowring’s instructions; and placed at his disposal the _Burracouta_\r\nsteam-sloop and the _Coromandel_ tender. A junk was seized; but this was\r\na profitless adventure; for, being found to be private property, the\r\njunk was given up again. The admiral next sent the steam-frigates\r\n_Encounter_ and _Sampson_ up the Canton river; ‘in the hope that the\r\npresence of such an imposing force would shew the high-commissioner the\r\nprudence of complying with our demands.’ The Chinese viceroy remained,\r\nnevertheless, immovable; he made no apology. Mr Parkes thereupon went\r\nfrom Canton to Hong-kong, to consult with Bowring and Seymour as to the\r\nbest course to be adopted. They all agreed that the seizure of the\r\ndefences of the city of Canton would be the most judicious, both as a\r\ndisplay of power without the sacrifice of life, and of the determination\r\nof the English to enforce redress—‘experience of the Chinese character\r\nhaving proved that moderation is considered by the officials only as an\r\nevidence of weakness.’\r\n\r\nThen commenced the second stage in the proceedings. On the 23d of\r\nOctober, Sir Michael Seymour went in person up to Canton, with the\r\n_Coromandel_, _Sampson_, and _Barracouta_, and accompanied by the\r\nmarines and boat-crews of the _Calcutta_, _Winchester_, _Bittern_, and\r\n_Sybille_. He captured four forts a few miles below Canton, spiked the\r\nguns, destroyed the ammunition, and burned the buildings. Another, the\r\nMacao fort, in the middle of the river, mounting 86 guns, he retained\r\nand garrisoned for a time. Mr Parkes was then sent to announce to Yeh\r\nthat the British admiral had come to enforce redress for insults\r\nreceived, and would remain in the river until redress was obtained. The\r\nhigh-commissioner sent a reply which was not deemed satisfactory. On the\r\nmorning of the 24th, marines and sailors were sent to capture the\r\n‘Bird’s Nest Fort,’ the Shamin Fort, and others near Canton; this they\r\ndid, spiking the guns and destroying the ammunition. On the afternoon of\r\nthe same day, strong reinforcements were sent to the British factory, or\r\ntrading-station of the merchants, to protect it from any sudden attack,\r\nand to guard against the floating of fire-rafts by the Chinese on the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n‘Apology’ was the demand made by the British representatives; but no\r\napology came; and thereupon the siege of Canton was proceeded with. On\r\nthe 25th, a fort called the Dutch Folly, immediately opposite the city,\r\nwas captured. The 26th being Sunday, nothing was done on that day. On\r\nthe 27th, the admiral heightened his demands. He caused Consul Parkes to\r\nwrite to the Chinese commissioner, to the effect that as the required\r\napology and reparation had not been given, the terms should be made more\r\nstringent. Henceforward, the field of contest was widened; it was no\r\nlonger the lorcha and the flag alone that constituted the grievance. Sir\r\nJohn Bowring probably thought that the same amount of threat and of\r\nfighting, if fighting there must be, might be made to settle other\r\nannoyances, as well as those more immediately under notice. No reply\r\nbeing sent to Parkes’s letter, the guns of the _Encounter_ and\r\n_Barracouta_ were brought to bear upon the Chinese commissioner’s\r\nresidence, and upon some troops posted on the hills behind a fort named\r\nby the English Gough’s Fort. This enraged Yeh Mingchin, who issued a\r\nproclamation, offering a reward of thirty dollars for every Englishman’s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nSir Michael, resolved to punish this obstinate viceroy, made\r\npreparations for a much more serious attack. He sent Captain Hall on\r\nshore, to warn the inhabitants of Canton to remove their persons and\r\nproperty from the vicinity of a certain portion of the city; this they\r\ndid during the night of the 27th. On the 28th, a bombardment was kept up\r\nfrom the Dutch Folly, with a view of opening a clear passage to the wall\r\nof the city; and when this passage was opened by noon on the 29th, a\r\nstorming-party was sent in under Commodore Elliot. Marines and sailors,\r\nwith two field-pieces, advanced to the wall, and speedily obtained\r\npossession of the defences between two of the city-gates. One of the\r\ngates was then blown to pieces by gunpowder, and another body of seamen\r\nadvanced to that spot under Captain Hall. Soon afterwards, Seymour,\r\nParkes, and Elliot entered the city through this shattered gate, went to\r\nthe high-commissioner’s house, inspected it, remained there some time,\r\nand then returned to the ships. The motive for this visit was a singular\r\none, unusual in European warlike politics, but having a significance in\r\ndealing with so peculiar a people as the Chinese; it was simply (in the\r\nwords of the admiral’s dispatch) ‘to shew his excellency that I had the\r\npower to enter the city.’\r\n\r\nThe month of November opened ominously. The British were determined to\r\nhumble the pride of the Chinese officials; whereas, these officials\r\nshewed no signs of yielding. Admiral Seymour now addressed a letter in\r\nhis own name to the high-commissioner, adverting to the case of the\r\n_Arrow_; pointing threateningly to the fact that Canton was at the mercy\r\nof cannon-balls, and inviting him to terminate the unsatisfactory state\r\nof affairs by a personal interview. He claimed credit, rather than the\r\nreverse, for his conduct towards the city. ‘It has been wholly with a\r\nview to the preservation of life, that my operations have hitherto been\r\nso deliberately conducted. Even when entering the city, no blood was\r\nshed, save where my men were assailed; and the property of the people\r\nwas in every way respected.’ Commissioner Yeh’s reply to this letter was\r\nnot deficient in courtesy or dignity; whether or not he believed his own\r\nassertions, he at least put them forth in temperate language. He\r\nmaintained, as he had before asserted to Consul Parkes, that the seizure\r\nof the twelve men on board the _Arrow_ was perfectly legal; that some of\r\nthem had been released on their innocence of an imputed crime being\r\nproved; that the other three were given up when Parkes demanded them;\r\nthat the _Arrow_ was a Chinese vessel; that the authorities had no means\r\nof knowing that she had passed into the hands of an Englishman; that no\r\nflag was flying when the vessel was boarded, and, therefore, no flag\r\ncould have been insultingly hauled down. The non-admission of English\r\nrepresentatives into Canton was defended on the plea that, the less the\r\ntwo nations came in contact, the less were they likely to quarrel. Again\r\nwas a letter written, and in more threatening terms than before. Sir\r\nMichael refused to discuss in writing the case of the _Arrow_, and\r\ninsisted that nothing short of a personal interview between himself and\r\nYeh, either on shipboard, or in Canton city, could settle the quarrel.\r\nNothing daunted, Commissioner Yeh replied on the 3d, reiterating his\r\nassertions of the justice of his cause, and acceding to no propositions\r\nfor a personal interview.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th a naval engagement took place on the river. The Chinese\r\ncollected twenty-three war-junks in one spot, under the protection of\r\nthe French Folly fort, mounted with twenty-six heavy guns. This fort was\r\na little lower down the river than the Dutch Folly. Seymour resolved to\r\ndisperse this junk-fleet at once. Commodore Elliot headed an attack by\r\nthe guns, the crews, and the boats of the _Barracouta_ and _Coromandel_.\r\nA fierce exchange of firing took place: the Chinese having no less than\r\na hundred and fifty guns in the junks and the fort. The fort was taken,\r\nthe guns spiked, and the ammunition destroyed; the Chinese were driven\r\nout of the junks, and twenty-two of those vessels were burned. No\r\nfighting took place on the 7th. On the 8th the Chinese made a bold\r\nattempt to burn the British ships by fire-rafts; but the intended\r\nmischief was frustrated. The commissioner still being immovable, Bowring\r\nnow suggested to Seymour that the next step ought to be the capture and\r\ndestruction of the Bogue Forts—four powerfully armed defences on which\r\nthe Chinese much relied. This was done after more fruitless negotiation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chinese War-junks.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Seymour had thus, by the middle of November, obtained full\r\ncommand of the Canton river; and he then stayed his operations for a\r\nwhile. The original cause of dispute, comparatively trifling, had now\r\ngiven place to a very grave state of affairs; and it remained to be seen\r\nwhether the Palmerston ministry would lay all the blame on the obstinacy\r\nof Commissioner Yeh, or whether Bowring and Seymour would be considered\r\nto have exceeded their powers and their duties. So far as concerns the\r\nattitude of the Cantonese themselves, three deputations from the\r\nprincipal merchants and gentry waited on Mr Parkes between the 8th and\r\n12th of November, to express their wishes that an amicable termination\r\nof the quarrel could be brought about; but at the same time to assert\r\ntheir conviction that, such was the inflexibility of the\r\nhigh-commissioner’s character, he would never alter his expressed\r\ndetermination to refuse the English representatives admission into the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark in this place that the opium difficulty, which\r\nwas unquestionably paramount above all others in the first war with\r\nChina, had now lost much of its importance. The imperial government had\r\nin later years issued very few edicts against the traffic in this drug.\r\nPerhaps the quietness in this matter was mainly due to the fact that the\r\nexport of silver to pay for the Indian opium was no longer needed—the\r\nincreased sale of tea and silk being sufficient to make up an\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of the month, other armed forts in the Canton river were\r\ntaken by the English. The Chinese, in revenge for these proceedings,\r\nburned and destroyed almost all the European factories, mercantile\r\nbuildings, and banks at Canton—leaving so little but ruins that Admiral\r\nSeymour could hardly find a roof to cover the seamen and marines when\r\nthey afterwards landed. The commercial losses might be repaired; but an\r\nirreparable consequence of the incendiarism was the destruction of Dr\r\nWilliams’s printing establishment; including the large founts of Chinese\r\ntype with which Morrison’s Dictionary was printed; and comprising also\r\nmore than 10,000 unsold volumes of books.\r\n\r\nIn this sort of piecemeal war, each successive attack irritated in its\r\nturn the opposite party; but the burning of the factories determined\r\nBowring and Seymour to the adoption of a sterner policy than had\r\nhitherto been displayed. They resolved to bombard Canton itself, and to\r\nsend an application to the governor-general of India for military\r\naid—trusting that the home-government would hold them justified in\r\nadopting this course under difficulties and responsibilities of no light\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe year 1856 came to a close. The new year was ushered in with an\r\nattack by the Chinese on Dutch Folly on the 1st of January. Six guns\r\nmounted on the Canton shore, and four on the opposite shore, fired into\r\nthe Folly; but the small English force there stationed soon quelled this\r\nattack. On the 4th, a fleet of war-junks opened fire on the _Comus_ and\r\n_Hornet_ at the barrier in Macao Passage. No sooner did news of this\r\nattack reach Admiral Seymour, than he hastened forward in the\r\n_Coromandel_, towing all the available boats of the other ships. On\r\nnearing the junks, some of them undauntedly attacked the _Coromandel_,\r\nthe boats, and a fort called the Teetotum Fort, which the English had\r\nbefore captured. The junks were heavily armed, and some of them had long\r\nsnake-boats lashed to each side to row them along. A third fleet came\r\ndown Sulphur Creek, and attacked the _Niger_ and the _Encounter_. This\r\nwas altogether a new aspect of the quarrel; the Chinese, not in the\r\nleast humbled by the demands of Bowring and Seymour, became the\r\nassailants in the Canton river, and fought with a resolution hardly\r\nexpected by their opponents. The attacks were not attended with very\r\ndefinite results. Not one junk was taken; they retired and collected\r\ninto a somewhat formidable fleet of nearly four hundred.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs was in every sense unsatisfactory to the English\r\nauthorities. Commissioner Yeh was as firm as ever, and severely reproved\r\nthe Canton gentry and merchants who had sent deputations to Sir Michael.\r\nHe issued proclamations, denouncing the ‘barbarians’ in fiercer terms\r\nthan before. Cruel massacres took place, whenever an isolated Englishman\r\nchanced to fall into the hands of the Chinese. Proclamations in the\r\nnative language found their way to Hong-kong, inviting the seventy\r\nthousand Chinese residing in that island to rise against their English\r\nemployers. Some of these Chinese were detected in attempts to introduce\r\npoison into the bread made for and sold to the English residents by the\r\nChinese bakers. Against all this Bowring and Seymour could do little;\r\nand yet something, it was felt, must be attempted; for British trade at\r\nCanton was for a time ruined; and if matters were allowed to remain in\r\ntheir present state, the triumph of the Chinese would be most\r\nhumiliating and pernicious to the English.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of January (1857), while no progress was made in\r\nsettling the differences at Canton, the spirit of the Chinese at\r\nHong-kong became more and more hostile to the British; nor were those at\r\nSingapore unaffected by the taint. The warlike movements of the month—so\r\nfar as that can be called war where no war had yet been\r\ndeclared—exasperated the Chinese, without making any impression on the\r\nobstinacy of Yeh. They consisted in the destruction of a portion of the\r\ncity of Canton. Early on the morning of the 12th, bodies of marines and\r\nsailors set forth, armed with fireballs, torches, steeped oakum, &c.;\r\nthey were conveyed in ships’ boats, and landed on different parts of the\r\nsuburbs of the city. The boats then retired a little way from the shore,\r\nwhile the _Barracouta_, _Encounter_, and _Niger_, kept watch in the\r\nmiddle of the river. The men advanced into the outer streets of the\r\ncity, and commenced the work of destruction. The houses being mostly\r\nbuilt of wood, they were easily ignited, and the breeze within an hour\r\nunited all the fires into one vast sheet of flame. To increase the\r\ndestruction, shot and shell were poured into the city from the ships and\r\nthe fort. Throughout the whole of the day, did this miserable work\r\ncontinue—miserable in so far as it inflicted much suffering on the\r\ninhabitants, without hastening the capture of the city. On the 13th the\r\nattack ceased; Sir Michael Seymour made what arrangements he could to\r\nretain command of the passage of the Canton river; while the Cantonese\r\nprovided for their houseless towns-people in hastily built structures.\r\nThe British naval force under Sir Michael Seymour, comprising all the\r\nships in the India and China seas, was by this time very formidable. It\r\ncomprised the _Calcutta_ (84), _Raleigh_ (50), _Nanking_ (50), _Sybille_\r\n(40), _Pique_ (40), eight other sailing-vessels varying from 12 to 26\r\nguns, twelve war-steamers, and seven steam gun-boats. These could have\r\nwrought great achievements in action at sea, with their 5000 seamen and\r\nmarines; but there were scarcely any regular troops to conduct\r\noperations on land.\r\n\r\nDuring February, the English consuls and traders could not but observe\r\nthe increasing hostility of the Chinese. Dastardly assassinations\r\noccasionally took place; piracy was more rampant than ever; war-junks\r\nmade their appearance wherever an English boat appeared to be\r\ninsufficiently guarded; and proclamations were issued in the name of the\r\nemperor, applauding the firmness of Yeh. The merchants wished either\r\nthat the affair of the _Arrow_ had never been taken notice of by the\r\nBritish authorities, or else that the warlike operations had been\r\ncarried on with more resolute effect. All the commercial relations had\r\nbecome disturbed, without any perceptible prospect of a return to\r\npeaceful trade. One of the worst features in the state of affairs was\r\nthis—that as the English throughout the whole of the China seas were at\r\nall times few in number, they were obliged to employ Chinese servants\r\nand helpers; and these Chinamen were found now to be very little\r\ntrustworthy. On the 23d of the month, the passenger-steamer _Queen_ was\r\non its way from Hong-kong to Macao; when suddenly the Chinese passengers\r\njoined with the Chinese crew in a murderous attack on the English\r\npassengers and officers, by which several lives were lost.\r\n\r\nMarch arrived, but with it no solution of the Chinese difficulty. Even\r\nsupposing Sir John Bowring, by this time, to have received instructions\r\nfrom home, warlike or otherwise, there had been no time to send him\r\nreinforcements of troops; and until such arrived, any extensive\r\noperations on land would be impracticable. Sir John and his colleagues\r\nwaited until their hands were strengthened.\r\n\r\nIn April, Seymour as well as Bowring remained quietly at Hong-kong,\r\neffecting nothing except the destruction of some junks. On the 6th,\r\nCommodore Elliot, with a fleet of armed boats from the _Sampson_,\r\n_Hornet_, _Sybille_, and _Nanking_, captured and destroyed eleven\r\nwar-junks and two well-armed lorchas, after a chase and an engagement\r\nwhich lasted all day. Documents fell into the hands of the authorities\r\nat Hong-kong, tending to prove the complicity of the mandarins and many\r\ninhabitants of Canton in the various plots of incendiarism, kidnapping,\r\nand assassination, which had imperiled the persons and property of the\r\nEnglish at that island. There were no present means of punishing these\r\nconspirators; but the discovery led to increased watchfulness.\r\n\r\nThe month of May witnessed no advance towards a settlement of Chinese\r\ndifficulties. A great rebellion was distracting many inland provinces of\r\nthe gigantic empire; but it did not appear that this could in any way\r\nhelp the English. Commissioner Yeh remained in his official residence at\r\nCanton, promising nothing, yielding nothing, and endeavouring to\r\nstrengthen the city against the English. The Chinese, on the 3d, made an\r\nattempt to blow up the _Acorn_ sloop-of-war in the Canton River, by\r\nmeans of a large iron tank filled with gunpowder, which was exploded\r\nclose to the sloop; and a similar tank was afterwards found close to the\r\n_Hornet_—the first was exploded with little damage; the second was\r\ndiscovered before explosion.\r\n\r\nNow occurred the sudden and startling outbreak in India, which wrought a\r\nmost signal influence on the progress of affairs in China. Before this\r\ninfluence can usefully be traced, it will be necessary to glance briefly\r\nat the proceedings in England having reference to the Chinese quarrel.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Sir John Bowring had incurred the heavy\r\nresponsibility of commencing hostilities in October 1856, without\r\nspecial Foreign-office instructions; and that Sir Michael Seymour was\r\nequally without Admiralty instructions. These officers could not\r\npossibly receive an expression either of approval or condemnation, of\r\nadvice or command, from England, until four or five months after the\r\ncommencement of the troubles. It was near the close of the year when the\r\nBritish government received particulars of the first operations against\r\nCanton; and it was about the beginning of 1857 when the British\r\nnewspapers and the nation took up the subject in earnest.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the opening of the session of parliament in February\r\n1857, ministers were eagerly pressed for information concerning the\r\nhostilities in China; because there was a general impression that an\r\nunduly severe punishment had been inflicted by Bowring and Seymour on\r\nthe Chinese for a very small offence. On the 5th of February, the Earl\r\nof Ellenborough asked for the production of papers which might throw\r\nlight on the affair of the lorcha _Arrow_, and prove whether it was an\r\nEnglish or a Chinese vessel. The Earl of Clarendon, after promising the\r\nproduction of all the needful documents, stated that Sir John Bowring\r\nhad not received any special instructions to demand admission into\r\nChina; but that his general instructions authorised him ‘to bear in mind\r\nthe desirableness of obtaining that free access to Chinese ports which\r\nwas mentioned in the treaty, and more particularly as regarded Canton.’\r\nWhether the means adopted by Bowring to obtain this free access were\r\ncommendable, was a question on which the Houses of Parliament soon\r\nbecame fiercely engaged. Sir George Bonham, Bowring’s predecessor, had\r\nnot thought the admission into Canton a matter of great moment; and as\r\nBowring was appointed by the Whigs, the Conservatives soon contrived to\r\nmake a party question of it. Among the papers made public by the\r\ngovernment about this time, was a dispatch written by the Earl of\r\nClarendon to Sir John Bowring on the 10th of December 1856. The earl had\r\njust learned all that occurred at Canton between the 8th and the 15th of\r\nOctober; and he expressed an approval of the course pursued by Bowring\r\nand Parkes. Referring to voluminous documents which had been transmitted\r\nto him, he declared his opinions that the lorcha _Arrow_ had a British\r\nmaster, British flag, and British papers, and was therefore a British\r\nvessel under the terms of the existing treaty; that if the Chinese\r\nauthorities suspected there were pirates among the crew, they should\r\nhave applied to the English consul, and not have taken the law into\r\ntheir own hands by boarding and violence—in short, he approved of what\r\nthe British officials had done, so far as concerned the single week’s\r\nproceedings which had alone come to his knowledge. Another mail brought\r\nover news of the seizure of the junks, and of the forcible entry of Sir\r\nMichael Seymour into Commissioner Yeh’s house. This conduct met with the\r\nmarked and clearly expressed commendation of the Earl of Clarendon, who,\r\nin a dispatch written on the 10th of January, complimented Seymour,\r\nBowring, and Parkes on the moderation they had displayed under difficult\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, the Earl of Derby moved a series of resolutions\r\nin the House of Lords: ‘That this House has heard with deep regret of\r\nthe interruption of amicable relations between her Majesty’s subjects\r\nand the Chinese authorities at Canton; arising out of the measures\r\nadopted by her Majesty’s chief-superintendent of trade to obtain\r\nreparation for alleged infractions of the Supplementary Treaty of the\r\n8th of October 1843. That, in the opinion of this House, the occurrence\r\nof differences on this subject rendered the time peculiarly unfavourable\r\nfor pressing on the Chinese authorities a claim for the admittance of\r\nBritish subjects into Canton, which had been left in abeyance since\r\n1849; and for supporting the same by force of arms. That, in the opinion\r\nof this House, operations of actual hostilities ought not to have been\r\nundertaken without the express instructions, previously received, of her\r\nMajesty’s government; and that neither of the subjects adverted to in\r\nthe foregoing resolutions afforded sufficient justification for such\r\noperations.’ These resolutions at once threw the whole blame on Sir John\r\nBowring; his ‘measures adopted’ caused the ‘interruption of amicable\r\nrelations,’ and the House ‘heard with deep regret’ this news. Of course,\r\nthe ministers could not sanction the resolutions; they had already sent\r\nover approval of Bowring’s conduct, and now they must manfully defend\r\nhim. Hence arose a most exciting debate. The Treaty of 1842, the\r\nSupplementary Treaty of 1843, the Convention of 1847—all came into\r\ndiscussion, as well as the documents which had passed between the\r\nBritish and Chinese authorities. It became a party battle. All or nearly\r\nall the Whigs defended Sir John; all or nearly all the Conservatives\r\nattacked him. The judicial peers on the one side declared that the\r\npapers proved the _Arrow_ to be a British vessel; those on the other\r\nasserted that the registry of that vessel at Hong-kong had not been so\r\nconducted as to render this fact certain. The statesmen on the one side\r\nargued that Bowring was right to insist on being admitted into Canton by\r\nvirtue of the treaty; those on the other contended that the right was\r\nnot such as to justify him in bombarding the city. The general adherents\r\nof the one party believed the statement that the flag of the _Arrow_ had\r\nbeen insultingly hauled down by the Chinese; those of the other credited\r\nthe Chinese statement that the flag had not been hauled down. And so\r\nthroughout the debate. It was quite as much a contest of Conservative\r\nagainst Whig, as of Bowring against Yeh. The Earl of Derby made a\r\nvehement appeal to the peers, for their condemnation of Sir John’s\r\nconduct in going to war without express orders from home; and an earnest\r\nexhortation to the bishops ‘to come forward on this occasion and\r\nvindicate the cause of religion, humanity, and civilisation from the\r\noutrage which had been inflicted upon it by the British representatives\r\nin Canton.’ He declared that ‘he should be disappointed indeed if the\r\nright reverend bench did not respond to this appeal.’ The legal argument\r\nwas very strongly contested against the government; Lords Lyndhurst, St\r\nLeonards, and Wensleydale all contending that, owing to some\r\nirregularities in the registry, the _Arrow_ was virtually a Chinese\r\nvessel in October 1856, and that the Chinese authorities had a right to\r\nboard it in search of pirates. On a division, the resolutions were\r\nnegatived by 146 against 110—the bishops, notwithstanding the Earl of\r\nDerby’s appeal, being as much divided as the other peers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CANTON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th the Commons took up the subject, in connection with a\r\nresolution proposed by Mr Cobden—‘That this House has heard with concern\r\nof the conflicts which have occurred between the British and Chinese\r\nauthorities in the Canton river; and, without expressing an opinion as\r\nto the extent to which the government of China may have afforded this\r\ncountry cause of complaint respecting the non-fulfilment of the treaty\r\nof 1842, this House considers that the papers which have been laid upon\r\nthe table fail to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent\r\nmeasures resorted to at Canton in the late affair of the _Arrow_; and\r\nthat a select committee be appointed to inquire into the state of our\r\ncommercial relations with China.’ This motion was more important than\r\nthe one in the Lords, since it led to a dissolution of parliament. The\r\ndebates extended through four evenings. Sir John Bowring was attacked by\r\nMr Cobden, Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, Lord John Russell, Mr Warren, Mr\r\nWhiteside, Lord Goderich, Sir John Pakington, Sir F. Thesiger, Mr Sidney\r\nHerbert, Mr Roundell Palmer, Mr Milner Gibson, Mr Henley, Mr Roebuck, Mr\r\nGladstone, and Mr Disraeli; while he was defended by Mr Labouchere, Mr\r\nLowe, the Lord Advocate, Admiral Sir Charles Napier, Admiral Sir Maurice\r\nBerkeley, the Attorney-general, Sir George Grey, Sir Fenwick Williams\r\n‘of Kars,’ Mr Serjeant Shee, Mr Bernal Osborne, and Lord Palmerston. It\r\nwas not merely a contest between Liberals and Conservatives; for the\r\nDerby party were joined here by the small but influential Peel party;\r\nwhile the names of Russell, Cobden, Goderich, Milner Gibson, and Roebuck\r\nwill shew to how large an extent the Liberals were dissatisfied with the\r\nproceedings in China. The arguments employed were such as have been more\r\nthan once adverted to—that the _Arrow_ was rather a Chinese than an\r\nEnglish vessel; that the Chinese authorities had a right to board it, to\r\nsearch for pirates; that no British flag was hauled down, because none\r\nwas flying on the lorcha at the time; that the return of the crew by the\r\nauthorities ought to have satisfied Mr Parkes; that as Commissioner Yeh\r\ngave explanations, a demand ought not to have been made upon him for an\r\napology also; that Sir John Bowring ought not to have extended the\r\nquarrel so as to include the question of his admission into Canton; that\r\nthe seizure of the junks was illegal; and that the bombardment of Canton\r\nwas not only illegal, but ferocious and unbefitting Christian men. Every\r\none of these positions was disputed by the government; nevertheless the\r\nHouse of Commons sanctioned them, or the resolutions which implied them,\r\nby a majority of 263 over 247. This vote, arrived at on the 3d of March,\r\ndetermined Lord Palmerston to appeal to the country by dissolving the\r\nexisting parliament and assembling a new one.\r\n\r\nDuring the interregnum between the two parliaments, public opinion was\r\nmuch divided concerning Chinese affairs. Lord Palmerston was at that\r\ntime in much favour, and his courage was admired in defending an absent\r\nsubordinate when fiercely attacked; still it was not without a painful\r\nfeeling that the nation heard of a great city being bombarded for\r\ntrivial reasons. Those who most warmly defended Sir John Bowring were\r\nthose who best knew the faithlessness of the Chinese authorities. By a\r\ncombination of various causes, direct and indirect, a new House of\r\nCommons was elected more devoted to Lord Palmerston than the one which\r\npreceded it; and the Chinese war then became a settled question, so far\r\nas that branch of the legislature was concerned. During the interval of\r\nmore than two months, between the adverse vote on the 3d of March and\r\nthe assembling of the new parliament on the 7th of May, the government\r\nwere making arrangements for bringing the Chinese difficulty to a\r\nsatisfactory termination. They told off certain regiments to be sent to\r\nChina; they appointed General Ashburnham to command them; they sent over\r\nthe Earl of Elgin with large powers to control the whole of the\r\nproceedings; and they arranged with the French government a joint plan\r\nof action for obtaining, if possible, free commerce at all the Chinese\r\nports. This scheme of policy was formed and partially put in execution;\r\nbut the various portions of it were only by degrees made publicly known.\r\n\r\nWhen parliament reassembled in May, numerous questions were put to the\r\nministers in both Houses—concerning the appointment of General\r\nAshburnham; the poisonings at Hong-kong; the treatment of Chinese\r\nprisoners; the relations between the East India Company and China in\r\nreference to the opium trade; the condition of Hong-kong as a British\r\ncolony; the emigration of Chinese coolies—and other matters bearing upon\r\nthe state of affairs in the Chinese seas. It speedily transpired that\r\nthe French government had appointed Baron Gros, to act with the Earl of\r\nElgin in the political negotiations with the Chinese; that the United\r\nStates government would also send out a plenipotentiary; and that the\r\nRussian governor of the sterile provinces on the banks of the Amoor\r\nwould be intrusted with similar powers by the court of St Petersburg. If\r\npeaceful efforts should fail to bring the Chinese government to amicable\r\nrelations, war was to be carried on more energetically than before. In\r\naddition to the regiments of troops, the British government sent out the\r\n_Furious_ steam-frigate, the _Surprise_ and _Mohawk_ dispatch-boats,\r\nthirteen steam gun-boats, and a steam transport. The Earl of Elgin left\r\nEngland on the 21st of April; General Ashburnham had started two or\r\nthree weeks earlier; and the troops had gradually been shipped off as\r\ntransport for them could be obtained. Certain regiments had been\r\nassigned to India, to relieve other regiments which had been long\r\nstationed there; but it was now proposed to send them first to China,\r\nwhence, after settling the troubles, they might be transferred to India.\r\n\r\nLittle did the English government foresee how strangely their plans\r\nwould be overturned by the formidable Revolt in India. In the earlier\r\nhalf of the month of June, the English nation directed no particular\r\nattention to the affairs of the east. The Persian war had come to a\r\nclose; the Chinese difficulty was languidly waiting for a solution; and\r\nnews of the Indian Revolt had not yet arrived. But the close of the\r\nmonth witnessed a different state of things. The terrible tragedies at\r\nMeerut and Delhi were now known; and legislators and the press alike\r\ndemanded that the comparatively unimportant Chinese expedition should\r\nnot be allowed to absorb the services of Queen’s troops so much needed\r\nin India. On the 29th, in the House of Lords, the Earl of Ellenborough\r\nsaid: ‘We have sent to China that naval force which should, in my\r\nopinion, be left upon the shores of England, to give security to this\r\ncountry even under the auspices of the most profound peace. That naval\r\nforce has been despatched to the Chinese waters—for what?—to carry on a\r\ncontest between Sir John Bowring and Commissioner Yeh! Six battalions of\r\ntroops have been sent out there for the same purpose; but I cannot help\r\nthinking that those six battalions will be found insufficient to bring\r\nunder our control the numerous population of Canton. The consequence\r\nwill be, that we shall find ourselves under the necessity of sending out\r\nfurther reinforcements. But are we, with India in danger, to fight the\r\nbattle of the government? Are we, my lords, determined, happen what may,\r\nto persevere in that fatal policy which her Majesty’s ministers have\r\nadopted?’ Similar animadversions were made in the House of Commons by Mr\r\nDisraeli. The ministers, while announcing the immediate dispatch of more\r\ntroops to India, did not promise that the Chinese expedition should be\r\ndiverted from its purpose; for they underrated at that time the serious\r\nimport of the sepoy revolt. Soon afterwards, however, when the news from\r\nIndia became more and more gloomy, orders were issued that some of the\r\ntroops not yet embarked should be sent to India instead of China. As no\r\nsuch catastrophe as a mutiny in India could reasonably be anticipated\r\nwhen the Earl of Elgin was sent out, the ministers could not tell how\r\nfar that plenipotentiary might accede to any application made to him by\r\nthe governor-general of India for the use of the troops already\r\napproaching or in the Indian seas.\r\n\r\nSuch being the progress of opinion and of preparation in England in\r\nreference to the Chinese quarrel, we may resume the rapid sketch of\r\noperations in China itself.\r\n\r\nWhen, at about the middle of May 1857, Viscount Canning received news at\r\nCalcutta of the disasters at Meerut and Delhi, he instantly, as we have\r\nseen in a former chapter,[194] transmitted telegraphic messages to\r\nBombay, Ceylon, and Madras. He inquired whether the Earl of Elgin and\r\nGeneral Ashburnham had arrived at either of those stations, on their way\r\nto China; and made earnest applications that the troops sent from\r\nEngland to China might be diverted from that route, and despatched to\r\nCalcutta instead. Canning and Elgin had both been intrusted by their\r\nsovereign with extensive powers; both, when they came to communicate,\r\nsaw that the events in India were more critical than those in China; and\r\nboth were of opinion that the Queen’s troops were more wanted on the\r\nJumna and Ganges than on the Canton or Pekin rivers. Hence arose an\r\nalmost entire stoppage of the operations in the China seas till towards\r\nthe close of the year. The slight events that marked the summer and\r\nautumn may be noticed in a few brief paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of May, before any considerable reinforcements could\r\nreach China, an attack was made by the British on a fleet of Chinese\r\nwar-junks with very considerable effect. One of the many channels which\r\nthe Canton river presents, called by the English Escape Creek, being\r\nknown to contain a large fleet of junks, Commodore Elliot was ordered to\r\nmake a vigorous demonstration in that quarter. On the 25th he entered\r\nthe creek, with the _Hong-kong_, _Bustard_, _Staunch_, _Starling_, and\r\n_Forbes_, towing boats filled with men from the _Inflexible_, _Hornet_,\r\nand _Tribune_. He found forty-one mandarin junks, all heavily armed,\r\nmoored across the creek; a brisk engagement ensued; and it was not until\r\nafter the loss of many men, on the 25th and two following days, that the\r\njunks were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe month of June opened with an engagement of more importance—the\r\nbattle of Fatshan. This city is about seven miles distant in a straight\r\nline from Canton, but lying upon a different affluent of the Canton\r\nriver. The expedition was not so much against Fatshan itself, as against\r\na fleet of junks lying in the Fatshan branch or channel. Sir Michael\r\nSeymour himself accompanied this expedition. The channel was too narrow\r\nto admit any except small-craft; and therefore the work was to be done\r\nby gun-boats and row-boats. At three in the morning of the 1st of June\r\nthe expedition started forth, the _Coromandel_ towing three hundred\r\nmarines in open boats. Many heavily armed forts line the Fatshan creek\r\nnear the city, and these speedily opened fire as the boats advanced.\r\nWhen the _Coromandel_ had nearly reached the town, the _Hong-kong_,\r\n_Haughty_, _Bustard_, _Forester_, _Plover_, _Opossum_, and other\r\ngun-boats, steamed up, each having its few but formidable guns, and each\r\ntowing ships’ boats full of ‘blue-jackets.’ The men landed at the foot\r\nof a hill which was crowned with a fort mounting twenty large guns, and\r\nwhich from that day was called Fort Seymour. The rush up the hill was\r\nexciting; commodores, captains, lieutenants, seamen, marines, all ran\r\nup, equally regardless of danger; and after a few rounds from the fort’s\r\nguns, the Chinese, dismayed at the boldness of the English, took flight,\r\nand ran away from their guns. The assailants then hastened to attack the\r\njunks, which, mounting twelve guns each, were able to pour forth a\r\ntremendous fire of shot and shell. How the British escaped with so\r\nlittle loss in this encounter is a marvel. The seamen were in ecstasies\r\nat the boldness of the duty assigned to them. The boats’ crews baffled\r\nthe shots from so many hundred guns by rowing right up to the junks,\r\n_beneath_ the line of fire of the guns; and when there, they did not\r\ncease till they had set fire to the junks, from which the crews escaped\r\nprecipitately over the opposite sides. Out of the seventy-two junks,\r\nsixty-seven were destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnxious were the speculations whether these renewed successes would or\r\nwould not lead to any decisive termination of the struggle. Bowring and\r\nParkes among the civilians, Seymour and Elliot among the naval\r\ncommanders, knew well enough that without a military force this could\r\nnot be done. They knew, moreover, that until the Earl of Elgin should\r\narrive, they could not be placed fully in possession of the views of the\r\nhome-government. They anxiously counted the days before the new arrivals\r\nwould be announced. The Earl of Elgin and General Ashburnham were at\r\nBombay on the day when the disastrous news from Meerut and Delhi reached\r\nthat city. The general went on to Hong-kong, where he arrived on the\r\n10th of June; but the earl, after reaching Singapore, gave orders that\r\ntwo of the approaching regiments should be diverted from the Chinese\r\nexpedition to the service of Viscount Canning. This was ominous of the\r\ncessation of any effective operations on the China coast. Elgin,\r\nmoreover, issued orders that, if Canning should make pressing\r\napplication for more aid, other regiments should be similarly diverted\r\nto Calcutta. Meanwhile, at Canton, Yeh remained as impassable as ever;\r\nhe did not yield an inch. The rich were flying from the city, the poor\r\nwere half starved by the stoppage of all trade; nevertheless these\r\nmiseries, bad enough to the Chinese themselves, did not improve the\r\nposition of the English.\r\n\r\nEarly in July the Earl of Elgin arrived in the _Shannon_ war-steamer. A\r\nlarge staff of military officers had now assembled at Hong-kong; but\r\nthere was nothing for them to do, seeing that the regiments had not\r\narrived, nor did it appear probable how soon Canning could spare them. A\r\nfleet and a staff of military officers were now in the Canton river\r\nalmost in a state of idleness. The active correspondent of the _Times_,\r\nhaving no fighting to witness, made those rambling visits to Shang-hae\r\nand elsewhere which enabled him to give so graphic an account of the\r\nChinese in their homes and shops and places of amusement. On the 13th\r\nthe French admiral arrived at Hong-kong, to confer with Elgin on the\r\npolicy to be pursued. At first there was an intention of steaming up to\r\nthe Pei-ho river, on which the imperial city of Pekin stands, to bring\r\nthe emperor to a conference. Within a few days, however, an urgent\r\ndispatch arrived from Viscount Canning, announcing that the revolt was\r\nspreading widely in India, and asking for further aid. The Earl of Elgin\r\nat once changed his plan. He set off to Calcutta, taking with him a\r\nforce of fifteen hundred seamen and marines, mostly belonging to the\r\n_Shannon_ and _Pearl_ war-steamers. It was these hardy men who\r\nconstituted the ‘Naval Brigades’ so often mentioned in past chapters of\r\nthis work, and in service with which the gallant Captain Sir William\r\nPeel met his death. Elgin’s determination was arrived at in part from\r\nthis circumstance—that Baron Gros, the French high-commissioner or\r\nplenipotentiary, was not expected at Hong-kong until September; and that\r\nany negotiations at Pekin would be weakened in force unless the two\r\ncountries acted in conjunction through their respective representatives.\r\n\r\nAugust found the English officers and seamen very little satisfied with\r\ntheir position and duties in the Chinese waters. An occasional junk-hunt\r\nwas all that occurred to break the monotony. Of fighting, such as\r\nmen-of-war’s men would dignify by the name, there was little or none.\r\nYeh continued to govern Canton; the Cantonese continued to suffer by the\r\nsuspension of their trade with the British. The four northern ports\r\nmanaged to retain a trade which was very lucrative to them—selling tea\r\nand silk to the English, and buying opium, which the Chinese dealers\r\nsold again at an enormous profit in the upper or inner provinces. As for\r\nthe emperor at Pekin, the English authorities at Hong-kong had no means\r\nof determining to what extent he was cognizant of affairs in the south,\r\nnor how far he sanctioned the immovable line of policy followed by his\r\nviceroy at Canton.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of September, Yeh took advantage of the lull in\r\nwarlike operations; he built more junks, cast more cannon, raised up\r\nseveral guns which had been sunk by the English, and collected a fleet\r\nof two hundred war-junks in the Canton and Fatshan waters, ready to\r\nencounter the ‘barbarians’ again in time of need. As a means of\r\nascertaining what was in progress in this quarter, Commodore Elliot set\r\nforth from Hong-kong to make a reconnaissance. He started up the Canton\r\nriver on the 9th, taking with him the gun-boats _Starling_, _Haughty_,\r\nand _Forester_, and the heavy boats of the _Sybille_ and _Highflyer_. He\r\nsteamed through some of the channels, which are so numerous as to\r\nconvert the banks of the river into a veritable archipelago, difficult\r\nto explore on account of the shallowness of the water in the channels.\r\nHe met with a vast array of trading-junks, which he did not molest\r\nbecause they were engaged in peaceful commerce; and a few war-junks,\r\nwhich he destroyed; but he did not reach any spot where war-junks in\r\nlarge numbers were congregated. One event of this month was the\r\nappearance of Russia on the scene. Admiral Count Putiatine, who had been\r\nappointed governor of the Russian province of Amoor, and who had made a\r\nrapid overland journey from St Petersburg to the mouth of the Amoor in\r\nseventy days, steamed from that river to the Pei-ho on a diplomatic\r\nmission. The purport of this mission was not revealed to the English;\r\nbut there were many at Hong-kong who surmised that Russia, like the\r\nUnited States, was secretly planning that a goodly share of any\r\ncontingent advantages arising from the struggle should fall to\r\nher—leaving all the odium of hostilities on the shoulders of England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWhen October arrived, the stormy state of the China seas rendered it\r\ndoubtful how soon the Earl of Elgin’s diplomatic expedition to Pekin\r\nwould take place. The British community at Hong-kong rather rejoiced at\r\nthis; for they had all along advocated the simple formula—take Canton\r\nfirst, and negotiate with the emperor afterwards. The earl’s intention\r\nto postpone his visit becoming clearly known, many of the staff-officers\r\nwho had been in enforced idleness at Hong-kong took their departure—some\r\nto Calcutta, some to other places. When Baron Gros arrived in the\r\n_Audacieuse_, which was not until the middle of October, the talk of the\r\nfleet was that Canton would be really and effectually besieged, as a\r\npreliminary to any proceedings further north. The _Imperador_ arrived\r\ntowards the close of the month, bringing five hundred marines direct\r\nfrom England; and large accessions of warlike stores denoted a\r\nresolution on the part of the government to bring about some definite\r\ntermination of this Chinese quarrel.\r\n\r\nIn November, General Ashburnham, apparently tired of doing nothing in\r\nChina, gave up the military command and went to India, where a proffer\r\nof his services was courteously declined by Lord Canning and Sir Colin\r\nCampbell. His sudden return to England, without leave, gave rise to much\r\ncomment in and out of parliament. General Straubenzee now became\r\nmilitary commander in China, that is, commander of the British troops\r\nwhenever they should arrive. Captain Sherard Osborne was collecting\r\ngun-boats from various quarters. Baron Gros undertook that France would\r\noperate in the capture of Canton, with three frigates, two corvettes,\r\nand four gun-boats, containing altogether about a thousand men. Mr Reed\r\narrived in the _Minnesota_, as American commissioner to represent the\r\ninterests of his country, but without any intention of taking part in\r\nthe hostile demonstration. Throughout the whole affair, indeed, the\r\nUnited States ‘fraternised’ much more freely with Russia than with\r\nEngland and France.\r\n\r\nAt length the month arrived (December 1857) which was to witness the\r\nconquest of Canton. At the beginning of this month the European\r\nwar-vessels in Chinese waters were really formidable in number. Besides\r\nthe _Calcutta_ (80), there were, including everything from\r\nsteam-frigates down to gun-boats, a total of 70 European and American\r\nwar-vessels, of which no less than 49 were British. On the 12th of the\r\nmonth, the Earl of Elgin sent a formal letter to Commissioner\r\nYeh—announcing his arrival as ambassador extraordinary from Queen\r\nVictoria to the Emperor of China, and as plenipotentiary to settle all\r\nexisting differences; expressing the pleasure which England would feel\r\nin being on friendly terms with China; enumerating the causes of\r\ncomplaint against the Chinese authorities; demanding ‘the complete\r\nexecution at Canton of all treaty engagements, including the free\r\nadmission of British subjects into the city,’ and ‘compensation to\r\nBritish subjects and persons entitled to British protection for losses\r\nincurred in consequence of the late disturbances;’ threatening a seizure\r\nof Canton if these terms were not acceded to; and hinting that the terms\r\nwould in that case be rendered much more severe. On the 14th Yeh sent a\r\nreply, very tortuous and cunning, justifying the conduct of himself and\r\nhis countrymen, but evading any direct notice of Elgin’s demand and\r\nthreat. On the 24th the British plenipotentiary wrote to announce that,\r\nas his desire for a peaceful termination of the dispute had not been\r\nproperly met, he should at once prepare for war. The next day\r\n(Christmas-day) brought a second letter from Yeh, repeating his former\r\narguments in a very discursive fashion, but evading everything in the\r\nway of concession.\r\n\r\nWhen December had brought what few troops the home-government and Lord\r\nCanning thought they could spare for China, the available numbers\r\nappeared as follow—800 men of various services, principally of the 59th\r\nfoot, from the garrison of Hong-kong; 2500 marines belonging to the\r\nvarious ships; 1500 naval brigade formed from the ships’ crews for\r\nservice on shore; and 900 French troops and seamen—making a total of\r\n5700 men. These were aided by about 1000 Chinese and Malay coolies, as\r\ncarriers and labourers—men who readily sold their patriotism for silver\r\nand copper. On the 16th, while the attempt at negotiation with Yeh was\r\nstill going on, the English and French took possession of Honan, as a\r\nmeasure of precaution. This is an island just opposite Canton; its shore\r\nforms the Southwark of the great city. The merchants and traders were\r\nallowed all possible facilities for removing their families and goods\r\nfrom such buildings as the captors chose to appropriate—the wish being\r\nto inflict as small an amount of suffering as possible on the Chinese\r\npeople, whom the Earl of Elgin carefully distinguished from the Chinese\r\ngovernment. From the 16th to the 23d, steamers and gun-boats were daily\r\narriving, and taking up positions mostly between Canton and the island.\r\nOn the 22d a council was held, at which the Earl of Elgin and Baron\r\nGros, having virtually declared war against China, gave up the command\r\nof the operations to the general and the two admirals—namely, General\r\nStraubenzee, Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, and Admiral R. de Genouilly.\r\nOn the 23d, several military and naval officers steamed in gun-boats\r\npast the whole length of the city, landed at a point beyond its\r\nnorthwestern extremity, walked a mile and a half under the escort of a\r\nparty of marines and sailors, mounted a hill, made accurate observations\r\non a series of forts north of the city, and returned without the loss of\r\na man. On the 24th there was a similar reconnaissance east and northeast\r\nof the city. These examinations satisfied the officers that the capture\r\nof the northern forts must be made from the east rather than the west.\r\nChristmas-day and the two following days were spent in making\r\npreparations for the bombardment; and in distributing papers along the\r\nshore, announcing to the Cantonese what calamity was in store for their\r\ncity if Yeh did not yield before midnight on the 27th. The viceroy\r\nremained as immovable as ever, and so the terrible work began.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on the morning of the 28th of December the guns opened fire.\r\nTheir number was enormous—some in war-steamers, some in gun-boats, some\r\non Honan Island, some in the captured forts. The general orders were to\r\nfire at various parts of the city-wall, and over the city to the\r\nnorthern forts, but to work as little mischief as possible to the\r\ninhabited streets. Meanwhile the troops, marines, and naval brigade\r\ngradually effected a landing at about a mile from the eastern extremity\r\nof the city; they landed guns and vast quantities of stores and\r\nammunition, and then proceeded by regular siege-operations to capture\r\nall the forts on the northern side of the city—the bombardment of the\r\nsouthern and western wall still continuing. These fearful operations\r\ncontinued throughout the last four days of the year, during which an\r\nimmense number of fragile wooden buildings were burned—not purposely,\r\nbut of necessity. The Chinese soldiers did not shew in any vast numbers,\r\nnor did they display much heroism; the assailants conquered one fort\r\nafter another, until they held the whole of the eastern and northern\r\nmargin of the city—having free communication with their ships by a line\r\nof route to their unmolested landing-place. Great as was the amount of\r\nburning of wooden tenements, the loss of life was very small; the allied\r\nkilled and wounded were less than 150, and the Chinese loss was believed\r\nto be not more than double that number—so careful had the soldiers and\r\nsailors been to avoid bringing slaughter into a place containing a\r\nmillion of human beings.\r\n\r\nRarely has a city been held under a more singular tenure than Canton was\r\nheld by the English and French on New-year’s Day 1858. They were masters\r\nof all the defences, and naturally inferred that the city would formally\r\nyield. Nothing of the kind, however, took place. The Cantonese resumed\r\ntrade in their streets and shops, but Yeh and his officers kept wholly\r\nout of sight. The ordinary usages of war were ignored by this singular\r\npeople. Elgin, Gros, Straubenzee, Seymour, Genouilly—all came to the\r\ncaptured forts on the northern heights, and all were perplexed how to\r\ndeal with these impassible Cantonese. On the 2d of January and two\r\nfollowing days the captors lived in much discomfort on the heights; but\r\non the 5th a very decided advance was made. Mr Parkes, and a few other\r\nEnglishmen who were familiar with the Chinese language, had been busily\r\nengaged collecting information concerning the hiding-places of the\r\ndignitaries within the city; and, acting on the information thus\r\nobtained, Straubenzee sent several strongly armed parties into different\r\ndistricts of the city. The results were very important. The explorers\r\ncaptured Commissioner Yeh, the lieutenant-governor Peh-kwei, the Tatar\r\ngeneral of the Chinese forces in and near Canton, fifty-two boxes of\r\ndollars in the treasury, and sixty-eight packages of silver ingots.\r\n\r\nFrom the 5th of January to the 10th of February the city was placed\r\nunder very anomalous government. In the first place, Yeh was sent as a\r\nsort of prisoner to Calcutta. In the next place, Yeh’s palace became the\r\nhead-quarters of the allied authorities; while other large buildings\r\nwere appropriated as barracks. The Earl of Elgin decided that the Tatar\r\ngeneral and the lieutenant-governor of Canton should be liberated. The\r\ngeneral, Tseang-keun, was obliged to disarm and disband his troops, as a\r\ncondition of his liberation. Elgin thought it prudent that Peh-kwei\r\nshould be formally made governor of the city, to save it from pillage.\r\nOn the 9th the installation of this functionary took place, in the\r\npresence of Elgin, Gros, Bowring, Parkes, Straubenzee, Seymour,\r\nGenouilly, and other officials. Colonel Holloway, Captain Martineau, and\r\nMr Parkes were appointed commissioners, or a council of three, to assist\r\nPeh-kwei in his municipal duties. The city now became safely traversable\r\nby the English and French without much danger; the Chinese soldiers were\r\ndisbanded; and the citizens were willing enough to go on with such trade\r\nas was left to them. The council of three insisted on organising an\r\nefficient street-police; on expediting the administration of justice; on\r\nvisiting all the prisons; and on liberating such wretched captives as\r\nappeared to have been unjustly incarcerated. Although Peh-kwei protested\r\nloudly against this interference with his supreme authority, he was\r\nobliged to submit. This period was a saturnalia for pirates; the regular\r\ngovernment being subverted, thousands of lawless men on the river\r\ncarried on with impunity that system of piracy and plunder which the\r\nnumerous creeks around Canton rendered so practicable. When this became\r\nfully known to the authorities now in the ascendant, Sir Michael Seymour\r\nput in force a severe measure of attack and reprisal against them.\r\n\r\nHow far the objects of the war had been attained, remained still a\r\nproblem. Canton, it is true, was seized; but the imperial court at Pekin\r\nwas invisible and inaccessible, and much evidently remained yet to be\r\ndone. On the 10th of February the blockade was raised. The Canton river\r\nwas speedily swarming with trading junks; the Honan warehouses were\r\nreopened and refilled; British merchants resumed their dealings with\r\nChinese merchants; and within a few days many million pounds of tea were\r\non their way to England. Shortly after the removal of the blockade, the\r\nEarl of Elgin and Baron Gros opened communications with Count Putiatine\r\nand Mr Reed; they proposed, in the names of England and France, that\r\nRussia and the United States should take part in the demands still\r\nnecessary to be made upon the Emperor of China. These overtures were\r\npromptly met; but it must in justice be stated that, in the subsequent\r\noperations and negotiations for obtaining treaties, the Russian and\r\nAmerican plenipotentiaries adopted a more secret and selfish policy than\r\ncomported with the liberal offer made on the part of England and France.\r\nElgin and Gros determined that Canton should remain in their power until\r\nfull and satisfactory treaties had been obtained from the emperor. It\r\naffords a curious illustration of the indomitable perseverance of the\r\nEnglish newspaper press, that the _Times_ correspondent, Mr Wingrove\r\nCooke, after seeing all the fighting in the Canton waters, and incurring\r\nas much hazard as his colleague Mr Russell had incurred in similar\r\nduties in the Crimea, contrived to obtain a passage in the ship (the\r\n_Inflexible_) which conveyed Yeh to Calcutta, and to draw forth many\r\npeculiarities in the character of that redoubtable Chinaman—a personage\r\nwho, through the columns of that newspaper, soon became familiarly known\r\nin nearly every part of the globe; a man whose shipboard life was thus\r\nsummed up, ‘he eats a great deal, sleeps a great deal, and washes very\r\nlittle.’\r\n\r\nEarly in March, after the forwarding to Pekin of official dispatches\r\nunder such circumstances as to render probable their receipt by the\r\nemperor, Elgin and Gros moved towards the north. This conveyance of\r\nletters was, as is usual in the Celestial Empire, a most complicated\r\naffair. Mr Lawrence Oliphant, the Earl of Elgin’s private secretary, and\r\nViscount de Contades, secretary of legation to Baron Gros, went from\r\nCanton to Shang-hae, bearing letters from the English and French\r\nplenipotentiaries, and also from those of America and Russia. After\r\nreaching Shang-hae, and being joined by the British, French, and\r\nAmerican consuls, they pushed on in boats up the river, on whose banks\r\nstands the city of Soo-choo, the capital of that part of China. The\r\ngovernor endeavoured by every means to avoid an interview; but as the\r\nmessengers would not be refused, he received them with an unwilling\r\ncourtesy, and undertook to forward their letters to Pekin. The envoys\r\nthen returned to Shang-hae. Certain arrangements were now made for the\r\nsafety of Canton and Hong-kong, and vast stores were sent up to\r\nShang-hae, in preparation for any contingencies. The Earl of Elgin and\r\nhis suite, on their way to Shang-hae, sojourned for a while at\r\nFuh-choo-foo. All the plenipotentiaries arrived at Shang-hae during the\r\nlatter half of the month. They received answers from the court of Pekin\r\nto their several letters. The Chinese authorities endeavoured so to\r\ntreat the subject as to keep the plenipotentiaries as far away from\r\nPekin as possible. They alleged that, whether Yeh had or had not misused\r\nhis authority at Canton, he was now dismissed, and was replaced by a\r\nviceroy who would be ready to listen to any reasonable representations;\r\nthey recommended that the English and French plenipotentiaries had\r\nbetter return to the south, there to resume their superintendence of\r\npeaceful commerce; that the Russians should return to the north, and the\r\nAmericans remain quietly at the trading ports. These replies did not\r\npurport to come from the emperor, who was too lofty a personage to\r\nrecognise the plenipotentiaries; they came through the governor of the\r\nShang-hae province, and were worded in the customary style of Chinese\r\nmagniloquence.\r\n\r\nThe month of April found the Chinese quarrel apparently as far from\r\nsolution as ever. The advice of the imperial authorities, that they\r\nshould keep away from Pekin, and attend to their trading affairs, was\r\nnot likely to be followed by the plenipotentiaries—one of whom, at any\r\nrate, had come from Europe for a far different purpose. Affairs did not\r\nprogress very favourably at Canton. Pirates continued to infest the\r\nriver; while an army of rebels—equally hostile to the imperialists and\r\nto the ‘barbarians’—was marching towards the city from the interior.\r\nMany of the inhabitants, rendered uneasy by the strange confusion in the\r\ngovernment and ownership of their city, fled from Canton. The English\r\nmerchants found their trading arrangements sadly checked by these\r\nsources of disquietude; and they sighed for the return of those times\r\nwhen opium, and tea, and silk brought them large profits. Finding, as\r\nthey had all along surmised, that nothing effectual could be done except\r\nin the immediate vicinity of Pekin, the plenipotentiaries took their\r\ndeparture from Shang-hae, and steamed northward. Count Putiatine, in the\r\n_America_ steamer, anchored off the Pei-ho river on the 14th; a few\r\nhours afterwards arrived the _Furious_ and the _Leven_, in the former of\r\nwhich was the Earl of Elgin; Mr Reed, in the _Mississippi_, made his\r\nappearance on the 16th; Baron Gros, in the _Audaiceuse_, joined his\r\nbrother-plenipotentiaries on the 23d; and Admirals Seymour and Genouilly\r\narrived on the 24th. Letters were now sent off to Pekin, demanding the\r\nappointment of an official of high rank to meet the representatives of\r\nthe four courts, to confer on the matters in dispute; and allowing six\r\ndays for the return of an answer. This decisive step produced a more\r\nimmediate effect than any course yet adopted; the emperor, unless wholly\r\ndeceived by those around him, had now ample means of knowing that a\r\nformidable armament was at the mouth of the river on whose banks the\r\nimperial city is situated, and that Russia and America had joined\r\nEngland and France in this demonstration. Before the six days had\r\nexpired, a messenger arrived to announce that Tao, or Tān,\r\ngovernor-general of the province, had been appointed as envoy to meet\r\nthe plenipotentiaries. Meanwhile, the month of May was a troubled one in\r\nCanton. The new governor Hwang, and the lieutenant-governor Peh-kwei,\r\nwere frequently detected in manœuvres not quite satisfactory to the\r\nEnglish and French officers left in charge of the city. Many of the\r\nCantonese themselves believed that Hwang had received secret orders from\r\nPekin to retake Canton while the allies were engaged in the northern\r\nwaters. There were machinations at Pekin, rebel armies in the inner\r\nprovinces, restless Tatars in the Canton province, pirates in the river,\r\nand unreliable Chinese authorities everywhere; insomuch that the\r\ncontinuance of quietude in the city was very problematical. During the\r\nmonth, about 1200 sepoys arrived from Calcutta; they had belonged to the\r\n47th and 65th Bengal native infantry, disarmed in India as a matter of\r\nprecaution, but not implicated in actual mutiny; the 70th had preceded\r\nthem, and had behaved steadily in China.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Elgin and Baron Gros experienced the customary difficulty in\r\nbringing the Chinese to anything like a candid agreement or\r\nunderstanding. The new envoy, Tao, was long in making his appearance;\r\nand when he did appear, his powers of treating were found to be so\r\nlimited, and his attempts at evasion so many, that the aid of\r\ncannon-balls was again found to be necessary. Steamers were quickly sent\r\ndown to Shang-hae, Hong-kong, and Canton, for reinforcements; and on the\r\n20th of May hostile operations began. The banks of the Pei-ho being\r\ndefended by forts, these forts were attacked one by one, and captured.\r\nThe plenipotentiaries were by this means enabled to advance higher up\r\nthe river, increasing their chance of a direct communication with the\r\nauthorities at Pekin. The Chinese had not been idle; for throughout the\r\nmonth they had been seen drilling their troops in the forts, and sinking\r\njunks to bar the navigation of the river; but the gun-boats which the\r\nEnglish and French had now brought up, and the boats of the war-ships,\r\nmade light of these obstructions. The Russian and American ambassadors\r\nwere pretty well satisfied with the trading concessions offered to them\r\nby the Chinese authorities; but the English and French were determined\r\nto be satisfied with nothing less than a definite settlement of all the\r\npoints in dispute; and hence the attack on the forts, which evidently\r\nproduced an immense excitement higher up the river.\r\n\r\nJune began with a battle, or at least, a skirmish, outside\r\nCanton—shewing that a peaceful occupation of that city was not readily\r\nto be looked for. A military force of ‘braves’ or Chinese soldiers\r\nhaving gradually been approaching from the north, General Straubenzee\r\ndeemed it necessary to encounter and crush or disperse them at once. On\r\nthe 2d, accompanied by Mr Parkes, he started off to the hills on the\r\nnorth of the city, having with him about a thousand men supplied with\r\nthree days’ rations. The braves, who were soon met with, kept up a\r\nskirmishing fight all day on the 3d, and then retired without much loss.\r\nStraubenzee returned to Canton on the 4th, also without much loss in\r\nactual fighting; but his soldiers had been stricken down in considerable\r\nnumber by the terrible heat of the sun. The expedition was scarcely to\r\nbe considered satisfactory; for the braves were still hovering among the\r\nhills, very little disheartened by their defeat. As the month advanced,\r\nthe state of affairs at Canton became worse and worse. Rockets were\r\nfrequently fired at night into the posts held by the allies; the suburbs\r\nwere full of armed ruffians ready for any mischief; the streets became\r\nunsafe to Europeans unless armed or guarded; occasional attacks were\r\nmade on the police, and even on the sentries; headless bodies of\r\nEuropeans were sometimes found in the river; two or three sailors were\r\nwaylaid, cut down, and carried off; and placards were posted up about\r\nthe city, couched in the most ferocious language against the ‘foreign\r\ndevils.’ One of these placards designated the British consul as ‘the\r\nred-haired barbarian Parkes.’\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs further north, during this month of June, was more\r\nfavourable. The destruction of the forts on the banks of the Pei-ho had\r\nthe effect of bringing the Chinese authorities again into a disposition\r\nfor negotiation. The river was carefully examined from Ta-koo up to\r\nTien-sing—a city of 300,000 inhabitants, situated on the high road to\r\nPekin, at a point where the Great Canal of China enters the Pei-ho. The\r\nfour plenipotentiaries steamed up to Tien-sing, where they were allowed\r\nto remain: seeing that the Chinese government, paralysed by the capture\r\nof the forts, no longer made an attempt to obstruct them. Governor Tao\r\nwas dismissed, for having managed matters badly; and two mandarins of\r\nhigh rank, Kwei-liang and Hwa-sha-na, were appointed to negotiate with\r\nthe barbarians. The plenipotentiaries took up their abode on shore, in a\r\nhouse provided by the mandarins; and a renewed series of negotiations\r\ncommenced. Meanwhile, all hostilities were suspended; the war-junks and\r\nthe gun-boats remained peacefully at anchor, and the trading-junks were\r\nallowed to pass up and down the river. About the middle of the month,\r\nsome of the inhabitants of Tien-sing manifested a disposition to molest\r\nthe plenipotentiaries and their suites; whereupon Sir Michael Seymour\r\nordered up a few seamen and marines—who, perambulating the walls and\r\nstreets of the city for a few hours, gave such a check to the citizens\r\nas to induce a more peaceful demeanour. One of the first definite\r\nresults of the conferences which now ensued, was a treaty between China\r\nand the United States, signed on the 18th of June by Mr Reed and the two\r\nChinese mandarins. America had from the first sought to obtain the best\r\nterms for herself, without much consideration for the other powers; and\r\nas her demeanour was more courteous than threatening, more submissive\r\nthan dignified; as, moreover, her demands were not so extensive as those\r\nof England—she found less difficulty in settling the terms of a\r\ncommercial treaty, which would open up a door for increased American\r\ntrading with China; and with this Mr Reed was well satisfied. Count\r\nPutiatine about the same date signed a treaty as the representative of\r\nRussia. The policy of his court was to keep the other great powers as\r\nfar from Pekin as possible, in order that nothing might check the\r\ngradual growth of Russian influence on the northern frontier of the\r\nChinese empire. The terms of the Russian treaty were far more important\r\nthan those of the American; they included the cession to Russia of a\r\nlarge area of country near the mouth of the great river Amoor, and of an\r\namount of trading privileges such as had never before been conceded by\r\nChina to any other country whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONG-KONG.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe English and French treaties, especially the former, being more\r\ncomprehensive in their character, could not be settled so readily as the\r\nAmerican. Commissioner Key-ing, who had concluded the treaty of Nankin\r\nwith Sir Henry Pottinger in 1842, was sent from Pekin to Tien-sing to\r\nassist Kwei-hang and Hwa-sha-na in the present instance; but the Earl of\r\nElgin, seeing that Key-ing was disposed for a course of cunning and\r\ntrickery, refused to treat with him; and the negotiations were left to\r\nthe other two commissioners. All difficulties being gradually removed by\r\nthree weeks of negotiation, treaties were at length signed on the 26th\r\nand 27th of June respectively by the Earl of Elgin and Baron Gros, with\r\nthe two Chinese commissioners. The provisions were nearly the same for\r\nEngland and for France, except an indemnity to be given to the former\r\nnation for the expenses of the war and for certain losses incurred by\r\nthe merchants. The more important clauses of the English treaty may be\r\nthus thrown into a summary: Confirmation of the former Treaty of\r\nNankin—Agreement to appoint British ambassador at Pekin, and Chinese\r\nambassador at London—Family and suite of British ambassador to have\r\nresidence and security at Pekin, and facilities for travelling,\r\ntransaction of business, and transmission of letters—British ambassador\r\nto correspond on terms of equality with the Chinese minister for foreign\r\naffairs—Christianity, whether Protestant or Catholic, to be tolerated,\r\nand Christian missionaries protected throughout the Chinese\r\nEmpire—British subjects permitted to trade and to travel in the\r\ninterior—Chin-kiang, on the great river Yang-tsze-kiang; Niuchwang, in\r\nManchooria; Tang-choo, in the Gulf of Pe-che-lee; Tae-wan, in the island\r\nof Formosa; Swatow and Kiung-choo, in the island of Hainan, to be\r\ndeclared free ports; in addition to Canton, Amoy, Fuh-choo-foo, Ning-po,\r\nand Shang-hae, the five already opened; and in addition, also, to three\r\nother ports on the Yang-tsze-kiang, as soon as they should be freed from\r\nrebels—An Anglo-Chinese commission to prepare a commercial tariff, which\r\nis to be revised every ten years—Inland transit dues to be commuted for\r\nan _ad valorem_ rate—Official correspondence to be conducted in English\r\nas the text or original, with a Chinese translation as an\r\naccompaniment—The Chinese character or symbol denoting ‘barbarian’ to be\r\nin future omitted in Chinese official documents relating to\r\nforeigners—British ships-of-war permitted to visit any ports in the\r\nempire, and their commanders to be treated on terms of equality by the\r\nChinese officials—Both nations to assist in suppressing piracy in\r\nChinese waters—Amount of indemnity to be settled by a separate article.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Elgin would not quit Tien-sing until he had clearly\r\nascertained that the emperor understood and accepted the terms of the\r\ntreaty: this done, he returned on the 6th of July to Shang-hae.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid seeing that such a treaty, if faithfully\r\ncarried out, would greatly revolutionise the commercial and social\r\ninstitutions of China. If British ships-of-war be permitted to visit any\r\nof the ports, and trading-ships have free entry to nearly a dozen of the\r\nnumber; if the great Yang-tsze-kiang be made a channel up which British\r\nmanufactures may penetrate; if Christian missionaries may teach and\r\npreach, print and distribute, without opposition from the government; if\r\na British official may reside at the imperial city, and the Chinese\r\nemperor condescend to appoint an ambassador to London; finally, if the\r\nvain assumption of superiority be discontinued in Chinese official\r\ndocuments relating to the English—an immense advance will have been made\r\ntowards bringing China into the fraternity of nations. The great doubt\r\nwas, whether so vast a change would not be too extensive to be made at\r\nonce—too humiliating, in the Chinese view, for the imperial government\r\nto adopt in its integrity: especially as the British did not offer to\r\nassist the emperor against the rebels who ravaged his dominions. It was\r\nnot expected that the formalities of ratification could all be completed\r\nbefore the summer of 1859. The Hon. Mr Bruce, brother to the Earl of\r\nElgin, conveyed the treaty to England. No sooner was the tenor of the\r\ntreaty known, than English merchants began to make inquiries and\r\ncalculations concerning increased exports, of salt and other\r\ncommodities, to the China seas. The indemnity question was felt to be\r\none which could not be settled without long delay, in treating with so\r\npeculiar a people as the Chinese. Commissioners on both sides were to\r\ndecide how much should be paid by China, for injury inflicted on British\r\nproperty at Canton, and for the expenses of the British expedition; they\r\nwere also to decide on the revised tariff for imports and exports.\r\n\r\nWhile the terms of this treaty were being settled at Tien-sing, the\r\nstate of Canton became more and more disturbed. Street-murders were very\r\nfrequent; bags of gunpowder were exploded in the streets, at moments\r\nwhen patrols were expected to pass; and missiles were hurled, from\r\nunseen quarters, into all parts of the city where Europeans resided.\r\nMany of the more peaceful citizens left Canton, and their houses were at\r\nonce seized by ruffians, who posted up proclamations of most\r\nultra-Chinese character. One of these proclamations was to the effect\r\nthat, ‘We have ascertained that there are only two or three thousand\r\nEnglish and French dogs in the city; but our numbers are thousands on\r\nthousands; and if every one of us carry but a sword to kill every\r\nforeigner that we meet, we shall soon kill them all. If any one trade or\r\nsupply provisions to the foreign dogs, we shall arrest and punish him\r\naccording to the village regulations. All those who are in the employ of\r\nthe foreign dogs must leave their employment in one month’—and terrible\r\ndenunciations were hurled against all those who should disobey these\r\nbehests. General Straubenzee and the other officials were much perplexed\r\nhow to deal with this state of things; they began to fear that nothing\r\nless than a bombardment of the city would drive out the ‘braves,’ and\r\nrestore peaceful trade; and yet it would be an anomaly to use cannon and\r\nmuskets, beheading and imprisonment, against the subjects of an emperor\r\nwith whom we had just made a treaty of peace. In this exigency, Sir John\r\nBowring caused large posting-bills to be printed in Chinese—announcing\r\nthat a treaty of peace had been signed between the two countries; that\r\nall animosity ought now to cease; that many Chinese, hitherto residing\r\nat Hong-kong as servants and traders, had been frightened away by\r\nthreatening proclamations from some of the authorities on the mainland;\r\nthat surreptitious attempts had been made to check the supply of\r\nprovisions to Hong-kong; and that many inconveniences had thence arisen.\r\nThe placard proceeded to warn all persons and communities against any\r\ninterference with the peaceful resumption of commerce between the two\r\nnations. An attempt to distribute this placard or proclamation was\r\nclumsily made, and led to disaster. Two British officers, knowing the\r\nChinese language, went with a few seamen in the gun-boat _Starling_, to\r\nthe coast of the mainland nearly opposite the island of Hong-kong. Some\r\ndifficulty being experienced in obtaining an interview with the official\r\nauthorities, the sailors landed under a flag of truce, and attempted to\r\npost up the placards in the water-side suburbs of the town of Namtow;\r\nthey were, however, attacked by Chinese soldiery, and driven back to the\r\ngun-boat, with the loss of one of their number and the wounding of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThis untoward failure of course led to further fighting. As the attack\r\nmade by the Chinese on the sailors was in defiance of a flag of truce,\r\nSir John Bowring deemed himself justified in inflicting a punishment on\r\nthe town. He made a requisition to General Straubenzee, who thereupon\r\norganised a small expeditionary force. He selected 700 men—59th foot,\r\nartillery, engineers, marines, and naval brigade—who were commanded by\r\nhimself and Commodore Keith Stewart. They landed near Namtow on the 11th\r\nof August, and gave notice to the inhabitants that no injury would be\r\ndone to them if they remained neutral; the attack being intended against\r\nthe ‘braves’ or Chinese soldiers, who had originated the contest. Within\r\na few hours a fort was attacked, the Chinese troops driven out, the fort\r\ndestroyed, and two large brass guns brought away as trophies. The object\r\nin view was, not to injure the town or the inhabitants, but to prove to\r\nthe authorities that any disregard of a flag of truce would subject them\r\nto a hostile demonstration.\r\n\r\nThroughout these strange operations, in which war and peace were so\r\noddly mingled—the one prevailing at Namtow, the other at Tien-sing—the\r\ncity of Canton continued in a disturbed state. On the 21st of July, the\r\n‘braves’ outside the city went so far as to plan an attack for the\r\nexpulsion of the English and French altogether from the place. They were\r\nspeedily beaten off. As before, however, it was a discomfiture, not a\r\nsuppression; for the braves settled down in an encampment about four\r\nmiles from Canton, ready for any exigencies. During a considerable time\r\nafter the signing of the treaty at Tien-sing, Governor Whang either did\r\nnot know of it, or else disregarded it; but in the course of the month\r\nof August, evidence gradually appeared that he had been officially\r\ninformed of the treaty. He forbade the braves to make any further\r\nattacks. Many Chinese traders, who had been driven in disquietude from\r\nCanton, now returned; and Hong-kong began again to look out for Chinese\r\nservants and work-people. Governor Whang’s proclamation, dated August\r\n17th, contained a statement which bore an aspect of considerable\r\nprobability: ‘There are, both within and without the city, many villains\r\nand thieves who, pretending they are braves, take advantage of the state\r\nof affairs to create disturbances in order to plunder and rob, and from\r\nwhose hands the citizens have suffered much. If such rascality be not\r\nspeedily suppressed, how can the minds of the people be set at ease, or\r\ntranquillity restored? And unless the villains be apprehended, how can\r\nthe districts be purged?’ Wherefore he gave orders for the suppression\r\nof violence and hostile manifestations.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of September and October—with the exception of a\r\nstroke of diplomacy at Japan, presently to be adverted to—Lord Elgin\r\nremained in the China seas, chiefly at Shang-hae, waiting for the\r\nChinese commissioners who were to settle with him the minor details\r\nsupplementary to the treaty. Former experience having shewn that the\r\nChinese authorities viewed the obligations of a treaty somewhat lightly,\r\nit was not deemed prudent either to give up Canton, or to withdraw the\r\npowerful naval force from the China coast, until all the conditions of\r\nthe treaty had been put in a fair train for fulfilment. Canton gradually\r\nrecovered its trade and quietude; Hong-kong gradually got back its\r\nChinese servants and artisans; and the English fleet vigorously put in\r\noperation that clause of the treaty which related to the suppression of\r\npiracy. Expeditions were fitted out from Hong-kong, which captured and\r\ndestroyed hundreds of piratical junks.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable episodes in this remarkable Chinese war bore\r\nrelation to Japan—an empire consisting of many islands, lying\r\nnortheastward of China. Until a few years ago, the Japanese traded only\r\nwith the Chinese and the Dutch. The Dutch were allowed to establish a\r\ntrading station on the small island of Desima, which was connected with\r\nthe larger island of Kiusiu or Kioosioo by a bridge. At the Kiusiu end\r\nof the bridge was the city of Nagasaki or Nangasaki, with the\r\ninhabitants of which only the Dutch were allowed to trade. One ship\r\nannually, and one only, was permitted to come to Desima from Java,\r\nbringing sugar, ivory, tin, lead, bar-iron, fine chintzes, and a few\r\nother commodities, and conveying away in exchange copper, camphor,\r\nlackered-wood ware, porcelain, rice, soy, &c. The Chinese, like the\r\nDutch, were confined to the little island opposite Nagasaki, but their\r\ntrading privileges were greater; at three different periods of the year\r\nthey were wont to send laden junks from Amoy, Ning-po, and Shang-hae,\r\nand exchange Chinese commodities for Japanese. Such was the state of\r\nmatters until a short time previous to the Russo-Turkish war; when the\r\nUnited States, taking advantage of an insult offered to American ships,\r\ninduced or compelled the Japanese government to permit intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries, to be conducted at certain ports under\r\ncertain regulations. Some time afterwards, similar privileges were\r\naccorded to Russia and England. The convention with England, signed at\r\nNagasaki on the 9th of October 1855, provided for very little more than\r\nthis—that British ships might resort to the three ports of Nagasaki,\r\nSimoda, and Hakodadi, for the purpose of effecting repairs, and\r\nobtaining fresh water, provisions, and such supplies as they might\r\nabsolutely need. It was a denial of such aid to distressed ships that\r\nhad led the United States to threaten the Japanese. France, not to be\r\nleft behind by other nations, sent an expedition to obtain shipping\r\nprivileges similar to those conceded to America, England, and Russia. On\r\nthe 25th of May 1856, M. de Montravel presented himself before the\r\ngovernor of Nagasaki, accompanied by rather an imposing array of\r\nofficers; he had no difficulty in procuring the desired concession. On\r\nthe 11th of December in the same year, two British merchant-ships, about\r\nto enter the harbour at Nagasaki, to purchase certain supplies, were\r\nrefused admission; whereupon the two captains sailed up close to the\r\ntown, landed, and marched with a strong escort to the residence of the\r\ngovernor. He declined to receive them, but undertook that any letter\r\nfrom them should be conveyed to the emperor at Jedo or Yedo, the capital\r\nof Japan. This letter obtained the desired result; an imperial edict\r\nbeing issued on January 26, 1857, that ships from any of the four\r\nnations might enter Nagasaki as well as the other two ports—provided\r\nthat none of the crews attempted to penetrate into the interior. This\r\nletter was, in fact, nothing more than the carrying out of an agreement,\r\nwhich the governor of Nagasaki had on a former occasion evaded. On the\r\n17th of June 1857, Mr Townshend Harris, acting under the United States\r\nconsul at Hong-kong, signed a treaty at Simoda with two Japanese\r\ncommissioners. This treaty was a great advance, in commercial\r\nliberality, on anything previously known in that region.\r\n\r\nThus matters remained until the autumn of 1858; when, expeditions to\r\nChina having been sent from England, France, Russia, and America,\r\nadvantage was taken of the proximity of Japan to obtain by and for the\r\nfirst three countries the same trading privileges as had been granted to\r\nAmerica. It was, throughout, a very singular race between four great\r\nnations, in which America obtained the first start. The Japanese had,\r\nduring three or four years, seen much more of Europeans and Americans\r\nthan at any former period, and had begun to acquire enlarged notions of\r\ninternational commerce; moreover, they had lately heard of the powerful\r\narmaments on the Canton and Pei-ho rivers, and of the treaties which\r\nthose armaments had enforced; from whence the Earl of Elgin inferred\r\nthat he might probably meet with success in an attempt to obtain an\r\nimproved treaty of commerce. On the 3d of August he entered the port of\r\nNagasaki, with the _Furious_, _Retribution_, and _Lee_—taking with him a\r\nsteam-yacht as a present from Queen Victoria to the Emperor of Japan. On\r\nthe following day he was joined by Sir Michael Seymour, with the\r\n_Calcutta_ and _Inflexible_. It being deemed best that the yacht should\r\nbe presented at Jedo if possible, the expedition set forth again, and\r\nproceeded to Simoda. Here it was ascertained that Mr Townshend Harris,\r\nUnited States consul, had just returned from Jedo with a new and very\r\nadvantageous treaty of commerce between America and Japan; that Count\r\nPutiatine was at that very moment negotiating for a similar treaty\r\nbetween Russia and Japan; and that Mr Donker Curtius, Dutch consul, had\r\nbeen trying in a similar direction for Holland. The Earl at once saw\r\nthat no time was to be lost, or he would be distanced by the other\r\ndiplomatists. Procuring the aid of a Dutch interpreter, through the\r\ncourtesy of Mr Harris, his lordship proceeded from Simoda towards Jedo\r\non the 12th. Disregarding the rules laid down by the Japanese government\r\nconcerning the anchoring-places of ships, the squadron, led by Captain\r\nSherard Osborne, boldly pushed on to the vicinity of the city—to the\r\nutter astonishment of the natives, official and nonofficial. Boats\r\napproached, containing Japanese officers, who earnestly begged the\r\nBritish representative not to approach the great city, which had never\r\nyet been visited by a foreign ship; but as he was deaf to their\r\nentreaties, they prepared to give him a courteous reception on shore.\r\nAlthough the city was strongly protected by forts, there was no\r\nindication of a hostile repulsion of the strangers. During eight days\r\ndid Elgin reside within the great city of Jedo, treated with every\r\nattention—possibly because there were British ships-of-war and a\r\ngun-boat just at hand. All the naval officers had opportunity of\r\ntraversing the city during this interval, and met with signs of\r\ncivilisation such as induced them to write home very glowing\r\ndescriptions. The earl at first met with difficulties, arising from the\r\ncircumstance that a conservative had just supplanted a liberal ministry\r\n(to use English terms) at Jedo, strengthening the prejudice against\r\nforeigners. Indeed, this change of ministry had arisen two or three days\r\nbefore, in consequence of the signing of the liberal treaty with\r\nAmerica. Elgin, however, triumphed over this and all other difficulties;\r\nhe arrived at Shang-hae again on the 3d of September, bringing with him\r\na treaty of commerce between England and Japan, signed at Jedo on the\r\n26th of August.\r\n\r\nThe treaty thus obtained was written in Dutch as the original, with\r\nEnglish and Japanese translations. The chief clauses comprised the\r\nfollowing provisions: England may appoint an ambassador to Jedo, and\r\nJapan an ambassador to London—The ambassadors to be free to travel in\r\nthe respective empires—Each power may appoint consuls at the ports of\r\nthe other—The ports of Hakodadi, Nanagawa, Nagasaki, Nee-e-gata, Hiogo,\r\nJedo, and Osaca, to be opened to British traders at various times by the\r\nyear 1863—British traders may lease ground and build dwellings and\r\nwarehouses at those ports—The British may travel to distances within a\r\ncertain radius of each port—In any dispute between British and Japanese,\r\nthe British consuls to act as friendly arbitrators—If arbitration fail,\r\nBritish offenders to be tried by British laws, and Japanese by those of\r\nJapan—British residents may employ Japanese as servants or\r\nworkmen—British may freely exercise their religion—Foreign and Japanese\r\ncoin may be used indifferently for commercial purposes—Supplies for\r\nBritish vessels may be stored at certain ports free of duty—Japanese\r\nauthorities to render aid to stranded British vessels—British captains\r\nmay employ Japanese pilots—Goods may be imported at an _ad valorem_\r\nduty, without any transit or other dues, and may be re-exported duty\r\nfree—British and Japanese to aid each other in preventing\r\nsmuggling—Money, apparel, and household furniture of British subjects\r\nresiding in Japan to be imported duty free—Munitions of war to be\r\nprohibited—All other articles to pay an _ad valorem_ import-duty,\r\nvarying from 5 to 35 per cent., according to a tariff to be specially\r\nprepared—Any trading privileges, granted hereafter to any other nation,\r\nto be granted equally to England.\r\n\r\nThis very important treaty—even more liberal in its provisions than that\r\nconcluded with China—was to be ratified by the two courts, and the\r\nratifications exchanged, within one year from the signature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR EDWARD LUGARD.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  § 3. ENGLISH PROSPECTS IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\nWhen, by the month of October 1858, it was known that the object of the\r\nPersian expedition had been fulfilled by the complete withdrawal of the\r\nPersians from Herat; that the purpose of the Chinese expedition had been\r\neven more than fulfilled, supposing the advantageous treaty made by the\r\nEarl of Elgin to be faithfully observed; and that a remarkable\r\ncommercial treaty had been signed with Japan—the English nation felt,\r\nnot unjustly, that their prospects of advancement in the east were\r\ngreatly heightened. All depended, however, or would depend, on the\r\nresult of the struggle in India; if that ended satisfactorily, the power\r\nof England in Asia would be greater than ever. That the Indian struggle\r\n_would_ have a favourable termination, few doubted. There was much to be\r\ndone; but as the whole empire cheerfully supported the government in the\r\npreparations for doing it, and as those preparations had been widely\r\nspread and deeply considered, success was very confidently looked\r\nforward to.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the final discomfiture (if not extinction) of the\r\nmutineers, and for bringing back a misguided peasantry to habits of\r\norder and of industry, will be noticed presently; but it may be\r\ndesirable first to glance at two important subjects which much occupied\r\nthe attention of thoughtful men—namely, the probable causes of the\r\nRevolt; and, consequent on those causes, the general character of the\r\nreforms proper to be introduced into the government of India, as an\r\naccompaniment to the change from the Company’s _régime_ to that of the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of Indian affairs was very remarkable; and in no instance\r\nmore so than with reference to the first of the above two subjects of\r\nspeculation. Down to the closing scene, men could not agree in their\r\nanswers to the question—‘What was the cause of the mutiny?’ Military\r\nofficers, cabinet ministers, commissioners, magistrates, missionaries,\r\nmembers of parliament, pamphleteers, writers in newspapers, as they had\r\ndiffered at first, so did they differ to the end. This discrepancy\r\noffers strong proof that the causes were many in number and varied in\r\nkind—that the Revolt was a resultant of several independent forces, all\r\ntending towards a common end. It may not be without value to shew in\r\nwhat directions public men sought for these causes. The following\r\nsummaries present the views of a few among many who wrote on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\nMr Gubbins,[195] who was financial commissioner of Oude (or Oudh) when\r\nthe mutiny began, was requested by Mr Colvin, lieutenant-governor of the\r\nNorthwest Provinces, to express his opinions concerning the causes of\r\nthat catastrophe. He wrote out his opinions; and stated that Sir Henry\r\nLawrence, shortly before his death, concurred mainly with them. In the\r\nfirst place, he did not attribute the mutiny to Russian intrigue—an\r\nexplanation that had occurred to the minds of some persons. In the\r\nsecond place, he disbelieved that the mutiny was due to a Mohammedan\r\nconspiracy; the movement began among soldiers, of whom four-fifths or\r\nmore were Hindoos; and certain Mohammedan sovereigns and leaders only\r\njoined it when they saw a probable chance of recovering dominion for\r\ntheir race and their religion. In the third place, Mr Gubbins equally\r\ndenied that it was a national rebellion, a rising of a nation against\r\nits rulers; for, he urged, the villagers were throughout more disposed\r\nto remain neutral than to aid either side; we had no right to expect any\r\ngreat loyalty from them; and we received all that could fairly be looked\r\nfor—the sympathy of some, the hostility of others, but the neutrality of\r\nthe greater number. In the fourth place, he denied that the annexation\r\nof Oude caused the mutiny; there were certain persons—courtiers of the\r\ndeposed king, shopkeepers at Lucknow, soldiers of the late king’s army,\r\nand budmashes—who had suffered by the change; but the mass of the\r\npopulation, he contended, had been benefited by us, and had neither\r\nground nor wish for insurrection. Having thus expressed his dissent from\r\nmany modes of explanation, Mr Gubbins proceeded to give his own views,\r\nwhich traced the mutiny to three concurrent causes: ‘I conceive that the\r\nnative mind had been gradually alarmed on the vital subjects of caste\r\nand religion, when the spark was applied by the threatened introduction\r\nof the greased cartridge; that this spark fell upon a native army most\r\ndangerously organised, subject to no sufficient bonds of discipline, and\r\ndiscontented; and, above all, that this occurred at a time when Bengal\r\nand the Northwestern Provinces were so denuded of European troops as to\r\nleave the real power in the hands of the natives.’\r\n\r\nMr Rees,[196] confining his observations to the province with which he\r\nwas best acquainted, attributed the mutiny to the mode of governing Oude\r\nby the English, superadded to the fierce hostility of the Mussulmans to\r\nChristians in general. Thousands of natives had been thrown out of\r\nemploy by the change of government, and with them their retainers and\r\nservants; all alike were rendered impoverished and discontented. The\r\nshopkeepers of Lucknow, who had made large profits by supplying the\r\npalaces and harem of the king before his deposition, lost that advantage\r\nwhen an English commissioner took the king’s place. New taxes and duties\r\nwere imposed, as a means of substituting a regular for an irregular\r\nrevenue; and these taxes irritated the payers. The Mohammedan teachers\r\nand fanatics, he urged, enraged at the substitution of a Christian for a\r\nMoslem government, were ready for any reactionary measures. Lastly,\r\nthere were innumerable vagabonds, bravos, and beggars in the city, who\r\nhad found bread in it under native rule, but who nearly starved under\r\nthe more systematic English government. Hence, Mr Rees contended, the\r\ngreat city of Lucknow had for a year or more been ripe for rebellion,\r\ncome from what quarter and in what way it might.\r\n\r\nColonel Bourchier,[197] like many military officers, sought for no other\r\norigin of the mutiny than that which was due to the state of the native\r\narmy. The enormous increase in that army—by the contingents raised to\r\nguard the newly acquired territories in Central India, the Punjaub, and\r\nOude—with no corresponding increase in the European force, encouraged a\r\nbelief on the part of many of the natives that they had a fair chance of\r\nbeing able to drive the English altogether from the country. The colonel\r\nquoted an opinion expressed by the gallant and lamented Brigadier\r\nNicholson, who possessed an intimate knowledge of the native\r\ncharacter—‘Neither greased cartridges, the annexation of Oude, nor the\r\npaucity of European officers, was the cause of the mutiny. For years I\r\nhave watched the army, and felt sure they only wanted an opportunity to\r\ntry their strength with us.’\r\n\r\nMr Ludlow[198] ridiculed the idea of the mutiny being sudden and\r\nunexpected. He pointed to the fact that Munro, Metcalfe, Napier, and\r\nother experienced men, had long ago predicted an eventual outbreak,\r\narising mainly from the defective organisation of the military force. Mr\r\nLudlow himself attributed the mutiny to many concurrent causes. The\r\nBrahmins were against us, because we were gradually sapping the\r\nfoundations of their religion and power; the Mussulman leaders were\r\nagainst us, because we had reduced the Mogul rule to a shadow, and most\r\nof the nawabships likewise; the Mahrattas were against us, because we\r\nhad gradually lessened the power of Scindia, Holkar, the Guicowar, the\r\nPeishwa, the Nena, and other leading men of their nation; the Oudians\r\nwere against us, because, in addition to having deposed their king, we\r\nhad greatly lessened the privileges and emoluments of the soldiery who\r\nhad heretofore served him; and lastly, the Hindoo sepoys were turned\r\nagainst us, because they believed the rumour that the British government\r\nintended to degrade their caste and religion by the medium of greased\r\ncartridges. Mr Ludlow treated the cartridge grievance as the spark that\r\nhad directly kindled the flame; but he believed there were sufficient\r\ninflammable materials for the outbreak even if this particular panic had\r\nnot arisen.\r\n\r\nMr Mead,[199] who, in connection with the press of India, had been one\r\nof the fiercest assailants of the Company in general, and of Viscount\r\nCanning in particular, insisted that the mutiny was a natural result of\r\na system of government wrong in almost every particular—cruel to the\r\nnatives, insulting to Europeans not connected with the Company, and\r\nblind even in its selfishness. More especially, however, he referred it\r\nto ‘the want of discipline in the Bengal army; the general contempt\r\nentertained by the sepoys for authority; the absence of all power on the\r\npart of commanding officers to reward or punish; the greased cartridges;\r\nand the annexation of Oude.’ The ‘marvellous imbecility’ of the Calcutta\r\ngovernment—a sort of language very customary with this writer—he\r\nreferred to, not as a cause of the mutiny, but as a circumstance or\r\ncondition which permitted the easy spread of disaffection.\r\n\r\nMr Raikes,[200] who, as judge of the Sudder Court at Agra, had an\r\nintimate knowledge of the Northwest Provinces, contended that, so far as\r\nconcerned those provinces, there was one cause of the troubles, and one\r\nonly—the mutiny of the sepoys. It was a revolt growing out of a military\r\nmutiny, not a mutiny growing out of a national discontent. Ever since\r\nthe disasters at Cabool taught the natives that an English army _might_\r\nbe annihilated, Mr Raikes had noticed a change in the demeanour of the\r\nBengal sepoys. He believed that they indulged in dreams of ambition; and\r\nthat they made use of the cartridge grievance merely as a pretext, in\r\nthe beginning of 1857. The outbreak having once commenced, Mr Raikes\r\ntraced all the rest as consequences, not as causes.—The villagers in\r\nmany districts wavered, because they thought the power of England was\r\nreally declining; the Goojurs, Mewatties, and other predatory tribes\r\nrose into activity, because the bonds of regular government were\r\nloosened; the Mussulman fanatics rose, because they deemed a revival of\r\nMoslem power just possible; but Mr Raikes denied that there was anything\r\nlike general disaffection or national insurrection in the provinces with\r\nwhich he was best acquainted.\r\n\r\n‘Indophilus’[201]—the _nom de plume_ of a distinguished civilian, who\r\nhad first served the Company in India, and then the imperial government\r\nin England—discountenanced the idea of any general conspiracy. He\r\nbelieved that the immediate exciting cause of the mutiny was the greased\r\ncartridges; but that the predisposing causes were two—the dangerous\r\nconstitution of the Bengal sepoy army, and the Brahmin dread of reforms.\r\nOn the latter point he said: ‘In the progress of reform, we are all\r\naccomplices. From the abolition of suttee, to the exemption of native\r\nChristian converts from the forfeiture of their rights of inheritance;\r\nfrom the formation of the first metalled road, to covering India with a\r\nnetwork of railways and electric telegraphs—there is not a single good\r\nmeasure which has not contributed something to impress the military\r\npriests with the conviction that, if they were to make a stand, they\r\nmust do so soon, else the opportunity would pass away for ever.’\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr Duff,[202] director of the Free Church Scotch Missions in\r\nIndia, differed, on the one hand, from those who treated the outbreak\r\nmerely as a military revolt, and, on the other, from those who regarded\r\nit as a great national rebellion. It was, he thought, something between\r\nthe two—a political conspiracy. He traced it much more directly to the\r\nMohammedan leaders than to the Hindoos. He believed in a long-existing\r\nconspiracy among those leaders, to renew, if possible, the splendour of\r\nthe ancient Mogul times by the utter expulsion of the Christian English;\r\nthe Brahmins and Rajpoots of the Bengal army were gradually drawn into\r\nthe plot, by wily appeals to their discontent on various subjects\r\nconnected with caste and religion; while the cartridge grievance was\r\nused simply as a pretext when the conspiracy was nearly ripe. The\r\nmillions of India, he contended, had no strong bias one way or the\r\nother; there was no such nationality or patriotic feeling among them as\r\nto lead them to make common cause with the conspirators; but on the\r\nother hand they displayed very little general sympathy or loyalty\r\ntowards their English masters. Viewing the subject as a missionary, Dr\r\nDuff strongly expressed his belief that we neither did obtain, nor had a\r\nright to obtain, the aid of the natives, seeing that we had done so\r\nlittle as a nation to Christianise them.\r\n\r\nWithout extending the list of authorities referred to, it will be seen\r\nthat nearly all these writers regarded the ‘cartridge grievance’ as\r\nmerely the spark which kindled inflammable materials, and the state of\r\nthe Bengal army as one of the predisposing causes of the mutiny; but\r\nthey differed greatly on the questions whether the revolt was rather\r\nMohammedan or Hindoo, and whether it was a national rebellion or only a\r\nmilitary mutiny. It is probable that the affirmative opinions were\r\nsounder than the negative—in other words, that every one of the causes\r\nassigned had really something to do with this momentous outbreak.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the second of the two subjects indicated above—the views\r\nof distinguished men, founded in part on past calamities, on the reforms\r\nnecessary in Indian government. And here it will suffice to indicate the\r\nchief items of proposed reforms, leaving the reader to form his own\r\nopinions thereon. During the progress of the Revolt, and in reference to\r\nthe future of British India, a most valuable and interesting\r\ncorrespondence came to light—valuable on account of the eminence of the\r\npersons engaged in it. These persons were Sir John Lawrence and Colonel\r\nHerbert Edwardes—the one chief-commissioner of the Punjaub, the other\r\ncommissioner of the Peshawur division of that province. Both had the\r\nwelfare of India deeply at heart; and yet they differed widely in\r\nopinion concerning the means whereby that welfare could be best\r\nsecured—especially in relation to religious matters. Early in the year\r\n1858, Colonel Edwardes published a _Memorandum on the Elimination of all\r\nunchristian Principles from the Government of British India_. About the\r\nsame time Mr MacLeod, financial commissioner, published a letter on the\r\nsame subject; as did also, some time afterwards, Mr Arnold,\r\ndirector-general of public instruction in the Punjaub. Sir John\r\nLawrence, on the 21st of April, addressed a dispatch to Viscount\r\nCanning, explanatory of his views on the matters treated by these three\r\ngentlemen, especially by Colonel Edwardes. The colonel had placed under\r\nten distinct headings the ‘unchristian elements’ (as he termed them) in\r\nthe Indian government; and it will suffice for the present purpose to\r\ngive here brief abstracts of the statements and the rejoinders—by which,\r\nat any rate, the subject is rendered intelligible to those who choose to\r\nstudy it:\r\n\r\n1. _Exclusion of the Bible and of Christian Teaching from the Government\r\nSchools and Colleges._—Edwardes insisted that the Bible ought to be\r\nintroduced in all government schools, and its study made a part of the\r\nregular instruction. Lawrence was favourable to Bible diffusion, but\r\npointed out certain necessary limits. He would not teach native\r\nreligions in government schools; he would teach Christianity only (in\r\naddition to secular instruction), but would not make it compulsory on\r\nnative children to attend that portion of the daily routine. He would\r\nwish to see the Bible in every village-school throughout the empire—with\r\nthese two provisoes: that there were persons able to teach it, and\r\npupils willing to hear it. Who the teachers should be—whether clergymen,\r\nmissionaries, lay Bible-readers, or Christianised natives—is a problem\r\nthat can only very gradually receive its solution. Lawrence insisted\r\nthat there must be no compulsion in the matter of studying Christianity;\r\nit must be an invitation to the natives, not a command. The four\r\nauthorities named in the last paragraph all differed in opinion on this\r\nBible question. Colonel Edwardes advocated a determined and compulsory\r\nteaching of the Bible. Mr MacLeod joined him to a considerable extent,\r\nbut not wholly. Mr Arnold strongly resisted the project of teaching the\r\nBible at all—on the grounds that it would infringe the principle of\r\nreligious neutrality; that it would not be fair to the natives unless\r\nnative religions were taught also; that it would seem to them a\r\nproselyting and even a persecuting measure; that it might be politically\r\ndangerous; and that we should involve ourselves in the sea of\r\ntheological controversy, owing to the diversities of religious sects\r\namong Christians. Sir John Lawrence, as we have seen, adopted a medium\r\nbetween these extremes.\r\n\r\n2. _Endowment of Idolatry and Mohammedanism by the Government._—In\r\nBritish India, many small items of revenue are paid by the government\r\nfor the support of temples, priests, idols, and ceremonies pertaining to\r\nthe Hindoo and Mohammedan religions. Edwardes urged that these payments\r\nshould cease, as a disgrace to a Christian government. Lawrence pointed\r\nout that this withdrawal could not be effected without a gross breach of\r\nfaith. The revenues in question belonged to those religious bodies\r\nbefore England ‘annexed’ the states, and were recognised as such at the\r\ntime of the annexation. They are a property, a claim on the land, like\r\ntithes in England, or like conventual lands in Roman Catholic countries.\r\nThey are not, and never have been, regarded as religious offerings or\r\ngifts. We seized the lands; but if we were to withhold the revenues\r\nderived from those lands, on the ground that the religious services are\r\nheathen, it would be a virtual persecution of heathenism, and, as such,\r\nrepugnant to the mild principles of Christianity. Lawrence believed that\r\nthe payments might so be made as not to appear to encourage idolatry;\r\nbut he would not listen to any such breach of faith as withholding them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n3. _Recognition of Caste._—Colonel Edwardes, in common with many other\r\npersons, believed that the British government had pandered too much to\r\nthe prejudices of caste, and that this system ought to be changed.\r\nLawrence pointed out that it was mainly in the Bengal army that this\r\nprevailed, and that the custom arose out of very natural circumstances.\r\nBrahmins and Rajpoots were preferred for military service, because they\r\nwere generally finer men than those of lower castes, because they were\r\n(apparently) superior in moral qualifications, and because they were\r\ndescended from the old soldiers who had fought under Clive and our early\r\ngenerals. Our officers became so accustomed to them, that at length they\r\nwould enlist no others. Being more easily obtained from Oude than from\r\nany other province, it came to pass that the Bengal army gradually\r\nassumed the character of a vast aggregate of brotherhoods and\r\ncousinhoods—consisting chiefly of men belonging to the same castes,\r\nspeaking the same dialects, coming from the same districts, and\r\ninfluenced by the same associations. It was the gradual growth of a\r\ncustom, which the Revolt suddenly put an end to. Lawrence denied that\r\nthe government had shewn any great encouragement to caste prejudices,\r\nexcept in the Bengal army. He believed that an equal error would be\r\ncommitted by discouraging the higher and encouraging the lower castes.\r\nWhat is wanted is, a due admixture of all, from the haughty Brahmin and\r\nRajpoot castes, down to the humble Trading and Sweeper castes. Whether\r\nall should be combined in one regiment, or different regiments be formed\r\nof different castes, would depend much on the part of India under\r\nnotice. Christianised natives would probably constitute valuable\r\nregiments, as soon as their number becomes sufficiently great. On all\r\nthese questions of caste, the two authorities differed chiefly\r\nthus—Edwardes would beat down and humble the higher castes; Lawrence\r\nwould employ all, without especially encouraging any.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fort St George, Madras; in 1780.\r\n]\r\n\r\n4. _Observance of Native Holidays in State Departments._—Native servants\r\nof the government were usually allowed to absent themselves on days of\r\nfestival or religious ceremony. Edwardes proposed to reform this, as\r\nbeing a pandering to heathen customs, unworthy of a Christian\r\ngovernment. Lawrence contended that such a change would be a departure\r\nfrom the golden rule of ‘doing unto others that which we would they\r\nshould do unto us.’ A Christian in a Mohammedan country would think it\r\ncruel if compelled to work on Sunday, Good Friday, or Christmas-day; and\r\nso would the Hindoo and Mussulman of India, if compelled to work on\r\ntheir days of religious festival. Lawrence thought that the number might\r\nadvantageously be lessened, by restricting the list to such as were\r\nespecial religious days in the native faiths; but beyond this he would\r\nnot curtail the privilege of holiday (holy day). He adverted to the fact\r\nthat the Christian Sunday is made obvious to the natives by the\r\nsuspension of all public works.\r\n\r\n5. _Administration by the British of Hindoo and Mohammedan\r\nLaws._—Edwardes deemed it objectionable that England should to so great\r\nan extent suffer native laws to be administered in India. Lawrence\r\nreplied that it is the policy of conquerors to interfere as little as\r\npossible in those native laws which operate only between man and man,\r\nand do not affect imperial policy. He drew attention to the fact that\r\nIndian legislation had already made two important steps, by legalising\r\nthe re-marriage of Hindoo widows, and by removing all possible civil\r\ndisabilities or legal disadvantages from Christian converts; and he\r\nlooked forward to the time when it might perhaps be practicable to\r\nabolish polygamy, and the making of contracts of betrothal by parents on\r\nbehalf of infant children; but he strenuously insisted on the importance\r\nof not changing any such laws until the government can carry the\r\ngood-will of the natives with them.\r\n\r\n6. _Publicity of Hindoo and Mohammedan Processions._—It was urged by\r\nEdwardes that religious processions ought not to be allowed in the\r\npublic streets, under protection of the police. Lawrence joined in this\r\nopinion—not, however, on religious grounds, but because the processions\r\nled to quarrelling and fighting between rival communions, and because\r\nthe Hindoo idols and pictures are often of a character quite unfitted\r\nfor exhibition in public thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n7. _Display of Prostitution in the Streets._—This aspect of social\r\nimmorality is far more glaring in many parts of India than in European\r\ncities, bad as the latter may be. Edwardes recommended, and Lawrence\r\nconcurred in the recommendation, that the police arrangements should be\r\nrendered more stringent in this matter.\r\n\r\n8. _Restrictions on Marriage of European Soldiers._—Great restrictions\r\nwere, in bygone years, imposed by the Company on the marriage of\r\nEuropean soldiers; and a shameful disregard shewn for the homes of those\r\nwho were married. Edwardes condemned this state of things; and Lawrence\r\nshared his views to a great extent. He asserted that men are not better\r\nsoldiers for being unmarried—rather the reverse; and that women and\r\nchildren, in moderate numbers, need not be any obstruction to military\r\narrangements. Some change in this matter he recommended. He pointed out,\r\nhowever, that in reference to the comfort of married soldiers, great\r\nimprovements had been introduced into the Punjaub, and improvements to a\r\nsmaller extent in other parts of British India. He fully recognised the\r\nbounden duty of the government so to construct barracks as to provide\r\nfor the proper domestic privacy of married soldiers and their families.\r\n\r\n9. _Connection of the Government with the Opium-trade._—Edwardes dwelt\r\non the objectionable character of this connection. Lawrence replied that\r\nthe English were not called upon to decide for the Chinese how far the\r\nuse of opium is deleterious; and that, until we checked our own\r\nconsumption of intoxicating liquors, we were scarcely in a position to\r\ntake a high moral tone on this point. He nevertheless fully agreed that\r\nit was objectionable in any government to encourage the growth of this\r\ndrug, actively supervising the storing and selling, and advancing money\r\nfor this purpose to the cultivators. It was a revenue question,\r\ndefensive wholly on financial grounds. How to provide a substitute for\r\nthe £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 thus derived would be a difficult matter;\r\nbut he thought the best course would be to sever the connection between\r\nthe government and the opium-trade, and to lay a heavy customs duty on\r\nthe export of opium from India.\r\n\r\n10. _Indian Excise Laws._—It was contended by Edwardes that the\r\ngovernment encouraged intemperance by farming out to monopolists the\r\nright of manufacturing and selling intoxicating drugs and spirits.\r\nLawrence contested this point. He asserted that there is less\r\ndrunkenness in India, less spirit-drinking and drug-chewing, than under\r\nthe former native rule, when the trade was open to all. As a question of\r\nmorals, the Indian government does no more than that of the home\r\ncountry, in deriving a revenue from spirituous liquors; as a question of\r\nfact, the evils are lessened by the very monopoly complained of.\r\n\r\nSir John Lawrence, in a few concluding remarks, expressed a very strong\r\nbelief that Christian civilisation may be introduced gradually into\r\nIndia if a temperate policy be pursued; but that rash zeal would produce\r\ngreat disaster. ‘It is when unchristian things are done in the name of\r\nChristianity, or when Christian things are done in an unchristian way,\r\nthat mischief and danger are occasioned.’ He recommended that as soon as\r\nthe supreme government had organised the details of a just and\r\nwell-considered policy, ‘it should be openly avowed and universally\r\nacted on throughout British India; so that there may be no diversities\r\nof practice, no isolated or conflicting efforts, which would be the\r\nsurest means of exciting distrust; so that the people may see that we\r\nhave no sudden or sinister designs; and so that we may exhibit that\r\nharmony and uniformity of conduct which befits a Christian nation\r\nstriving to do its duty.’ Finally, he expressed a singularly firm\r\nconviction that, so far as concerns the Punjaub, he could himself carry\r\nout ‘all those measures which are really matters of Christian duty on\r\nthe part of the government:’ measures which ‘would arouse no danger,\r\nwould conciliate instead of provoking, and would subserve the ultimate\r\ndiffusion of the truth among the people.’\r\n\r\nIt wants no other evidence than is furnished by the above very\r\nremarkable correspondence, to shew that the future government of India\r\nmust, if it be effective, be based on some system which has been well\r\nweighed and scrutinised on all sides. The problem is nothing less than\r\nthat of governing a hundred and eighty millions of human beings, whose\r\ncharacteristics are very imperfectly known to us. It is a matter of no\r\ngreat difficulty to write out a scheme or plan of government,\r\nplentifully bestrewed with personalities and accusations; there have\r\nbeen many such; but the calm judgment of men filling different ranks in\r\nlife, and conversant with different aspects of Indian character, can\r\nalone insure the embodiment of a scheme calculated to benefit both India\r\nand England. Whether the abolition of the governing powers of the East\r\nIndia Company will facilitate the solution of this great problem, the\r\nfuture alone can shew; it will at any rate simplify the departmental\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s proclamation, announcing the great change in the mode of\r\ngovernment, and offering an amnesty to evildoers under certain easily\r\nunderstood conditions, adverted cautiously to the future and its\r\nprospects. Before, however, touching on this important document, it may\r\nbe well to say a few words concerning the military operations in the few\r\nweeks immediately preceding its issue.\r\n\r\nThese operations, large as they were, had resolved themselves into the\r\nhunting down of desperate bands, rather than the fighting of great\r\nbattles with a military opponent. Throughout the whole of India, in the\r\nmonths of October and November, disturbances had been nearly quelled\r\nexcept in two regions—Oude, with portions of the neighbouring provinces\r\nof Rohilcund and Behar; and Malwah, with portions of Bundelcund and the\r\nNerbudda provinces. Of the rest—Bengal, Assam and the Delta of the\r\nGanges, Aracan and Pegu, the greater portion of Behar and the Northwest\r\nProvinces, the Doab, Sirhind and the hill regions, the Punjaub, Sinde,\r\nCutch and Gujerat, Bombay and its vicinity, the Deccan under the Nizam,\r\nthe Nagpoor territory, the Madras region, Mysore, the South Mahratta\r\ncountry, the south of the Indian peninsula—all were so nearly at peace\r\nas to excite little attention. Of the two excepted regions, a few\r\ndetails will shew that they were gradually falling more and more under\r\nBritish power.\r\n\r\nIn the Oude region the guiding spirit was still the Begum, one of the\r\nwives of the deposed king. She had the same kind of energy and ability\r\nas the Ranee of Jhansi, with less of cruelty; and was hence deserving of\r\na meed of respect. Camp-gossip told that, under disappointment at the\r\nuniform defeat of the rebel troops whenever and wherever they\r\nencountered the English, she sent a pair of bangles (ankle-ornaments) to\r\neach of her generals or leaders—scoffingly telling him to wear those\r\ntrinkets, and become a woman, unless he could vanquish and drive out the\r\nFeringhees. This had the effect of impelling some of her officers to\r\nmake attacks on the British; but the attacks were utterly futile. There\r\nwere many leaders in Oude who fought on their own account; a greater\r\nnumber, however, acknowledged a kind of suzerainty in the Begum. If she\r\ndid not win battles, she at least headed armies, and carried on open\r\nwarfare; whereas the despicable Nena Sahib, true to his cowardice from\r\nfirst to last, was hiding in jungles, and endeavouring to keep his very\r\nexistence unknown to the English. The military operations in Oude during\r\nthe month of October were not extensive in character. Sir Colin Campbell\r\n(Lord Clyde), waiting for the cessation of the autumnal rains, was\r\ncollecting several columns, with a view of hemming in the rebels on all\r\nsides and crushing them. That they would ultimately be crushed,\r\neverything foretold; for in every encounter, large or small, they were\r\nso disgracefully beaten as to shew that the leaders commanded a mere\r\npredatory rabble rather than a brave disciplined soldiery. These\r\nencounters were mostly in Oude, but partly in Behar and Rohilcund. In\r\nthe greater number of instances, however, the rebels ran instead of\r\nfighting, even though their number was tenfold that of their opponents.\r\nThe skilled mutinied sepoys from the Bengal army were becoming daily\r\nfewer in number, so many having been struck down by war and by\r\nprivation; their places were now taken by undisciplined ruffians, who,\r\nhowever strong for rapine and anarchy, were nearly powerless on the\r\nfield of battle. Thousands of men in this part of India, who had become\r\nimpoverished, almost houseless, during a year and a half of anarchy, had\r\nstrong temptation to join the rebel leaders, from a hope of booty or\r\nplunder, irrespective of any national or patriotic motive. Sir Colin,\r\nwhen the month of November arrived, entered personally on his plan of\r\noperations; which was to bar the boundaries of Oude on three sides—the\r\nGanges, Rohilcund, and Behar—and compel the various bodies of rebels\r\neither to fight or to flee; if they fought, their virtual annihilation\r\nwould be almost certain; if they fled, it could only be to the jungle\r\nregion on the Nepaul frontier of Oude, where, though they might carry on\r\na hide-and-seek game for many months, their military importance as\r\nrebels would cease. In the dead of the night, between the 1st and 2d of\r\nNovember, the veteran commander-in-chief set forth from Allahabad with a\r\nwell-selected force, crossed the Ganges, and advanced into Oude. His\r\nfirst work was to issue a proclamation,[203] sternly threatening all\r\nevildoers. A few days earlier, at Lucknow, Mr Montgomery, as\r\nchief-commissioner, had issued a proclamation for the disarming of\r\nOude—requiring all thalookdars to surrender their guns, all persons\r\nwhatever to surrender their arms, all leaders to refrain from building\r\nand arming forts; and threatening with fine and imprisonment those who\r\nshould disobey. It was intended and believed that the three\r\nproclamations should all conduce towards a pacification—the Queen’s\r\n(presently to be noticed) offering pardon to mutineers who yielded; the\r\nCommander-in-chief’s, threatening destruction to all towns and villages\r\nwhich aided rebels; and the commissioners’, lessening the powers for\r\nmischief by depriving the inhabitants generally of arms. With Sir Colin\r\nadvancing towards the centre of Oude by Pertabghur, troops from\r\nSeetapoor, Hope Grant from Salone, and Rowcroft from the Gogra at\r\nFyzabad, the Begum and her supporters were gradually so hemmed in that\r\nthey began to avail themselves of the terms of the Queen’s proclamation\r\nby surrender. It was to such a result that the authorities had from the\r\nfirst looked; but never until now had all the conditions for it been\r\nfavourable. One of the first to surrender was Rajah Lall Madhoo Singh, a\r\nchieftain of great influence and energy, and one whose character had not\r\nbeen stained by deeds of cruelty.\r\n\r\nIn the Arrah or Jugdispore district, in like manner, the close of the\r\nscene was foreshadowed. Ummer Singh and his confederates had long\r\nbaffled Brigadier Douglas; but now that troops were converging from all\r\nquarters upon the jungle-haunt, the rebels became more and more isolated\r\nfrom bands in other districts, their position more and more critical,\r\nand their final discomfiture more certain. Sir H. Havelock, son of the\r\ndeceased general, and Colonel Turner, pressed them more and more with\r\nnew columns, until their hopes were desperate. One excellent expedient\r\nwas the cutting down of the Jugdispore jungle, 23 miles in length by 4\r\nin breadth; this useful work was begun in November by Messrs Burn,\r\nrailway contractors.\r\n\r\nIn the other region of India above adverted to—comprising those\r\ndistricts of Malwah, Bundelcund, &c., which are watered by the Betwah,\r\nthe Chumbul, the Nerbudda, and their tributaries—the leading rebel was\r\nTanteea Topee, one of the most remarkable men brought forward by the\r\nRevolt. He had most of the qualities for a good general—except courage.\r\nHe would not fight if he could help it; but in avoiding the British\r\ngenerals opposed to him, he displayed a cunning of plan, a fertility of\r\nresource, and a celerity of movement, quite note-worthy. The truth seems\r\nto have been, that he held power over an enormous treasure, in money and\r\njewels, which he had obtained by plundering Scindia’s palace at Gwalior;\r\nthis treasure he carried with him wherever he went; and he shunned any\r\nencounters which might endanger it. He looked out for a strong city or\r\nfort, where he might settle down as a Mahratta prince, with a large\r\nstore of available ready wealth at hand; but as the British did not\r\nchoose to leave him in quietude, he marched from place to place. Between\r\nthe beginning of June and the end of November he traversed with his army\r\nan enormous area of country, seizing guns from various towns and forts\r\non the way, but usually escaping before the English could catch him.\r\nFormer chapters have shewn by what strange circumvolutions he arrived at\r\nJulra Patteen; and a detail of operations would shew that his subsequent\r\nmovements were equally erratic. He went to Seronj, then to Esagurh, then\r\nto Chunderee, then to Peshore, then arrived at the river Betwah, and\r\nwavered whether he should go southward to the Deccan or northward\r\ntowards Jhansi. Everywhere he was either followed or headed, by columns\r\nand detachments under Michel, Mayne, Parkes, Smith, and other officers.\r\nWhenever they could bring him to an encounter, they invariably beat him\r\nmost signally; but when, as generally happened, he escaped by forced\r\nmarches, they tracked him. He picked up guns and men as he went; so that\r\nthe amount of his force was never correctly known; it varied from three\r\nto fifteen thousand. One of the most severe defeats he received was at\r\nSindwah, on the 19th of October, at the hands of General Michel;\r\nanother, on the 25th, near Multhone, from the same active general. It\r\nwas felt on all sides that this game could not be indefinitely\r\ncontinued. Tanteea Topee was like a hunted beast of prey, pursued by\r\nenemies who would not let him rest. When it had been clearly ascertained\r\nby General Roberts, in Rajpootana, that the fleet-footed and\r\nunencumbered rebel soldiery could escape faster than British troops\r\ncould follow them, a new mode of strategy was adopted; columns from four\r\ndifferent directions began to march towards a common centre, near which\r\ncentre were Tanteea and his rebels; if one column could not catch him,\r\nanother could head him and drive him back. Thus it was considered a\r\nmilitary certainty that he must be run down at last. And if he fell, the\r\ngreat work of pacification in that part of India would be pretty well\r\neffected; for there was no rebel force of any account except that\r\ncommanded by Tanteea Topee. After his defeat at Multhone, Tanteea was in\r\ngreat peril; Michel literally cut his army in two; and if he had pursued\r\nthe larger instead of the smaller of these two sections, he might\r\npossibly have captured Tanteea himself. On the last day in October, the\r\nrebel leader crossed the Nerbudda river, thereby turning his back on the\r\nregions occupied by the columns of Roberts, Napier, Michel, Smith, and\r\nWhitlock. During November, he made some extraordinary marches in the\r\ncountry immediately southward of the Nerbudda—being heard of\r\nsuccessively at Baitool, the Sindwara hills, and other little-known\r\nplaces in that region. He was no better off than before, however, for\r\nforces were immediately sent against him from Ahmednuggur, Kamptee, and\r\nother places; he had lost nearly all his guns and stores, his rebel\r\nfollowers, though laden with wealth, were footsore and desponding; and,\r\nfor the first time, his companions began to look out for favourable\r\nterms of surrender. The Queen’s proclamation was eminently calculated to\r\nwithdraw his misguided followers from him; and the Nawab of Banda, the\r\nmost influential among them, was the first to give himself up to General\r\nMichel.\r\n\r\nNot only was a large measure of forgiveness held out to those who would\r\nreturn to their allegiance; but the British troops in India were\r\nbecoming so formidably numerous as to render still more certain than\r\never the eventual triumph of order and good government. The Queen’s\r\ntroops in India at the beginning of November, those on the passage from\r\nEngland, and those told off for further shipment, amounted altogether to\r\nlittle short of one hundred thousand men. It affords a striking instance\r\nof triumph over difficulties, that between November 1857 and November\r\n1858 the Peninsular and Oriental Steam-navigation Company conveyed no\r\nless than 8190 officers and soldiers to India by the overland route—in\r\nspite of the forebodings that that route would be unsuitable for whole\r\nregiments of soldiers; the burning Egyptian desert and the reef-bound\r\nRed Sea were traversed almost without disaster, under the watchful care\r\nof this company.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of November 1858 was a great day in India. On this day the\r\ntransference of governing power from the East India Company to Queen\r\nVictoria was made known throughout the length and breadth of the empire.\r\nA royal proclamation[204] was issued, which many regarded as the Magna\r\nCharta of native liberty in India. At Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Lahore,\r\nKurachee, Delhi, Agra, Allahabad, Nagpoor, Mysore, Rangoon, and other\r\ngreat cities, this proclamation was read with every accompaniment of\r\nceremonial splendour that could give dignity to the occasion in the eyes\r\nof the natives; and at every British station, large or small, it was\r\nread amid such military honours as each place afforded. It was\r\ntranslated into most of the languages, and many of the dialects of\r\nIndia. It was printed in tens of thousands, and distributed wherever\r\nnatives were wont most to congregate—in order that all might know that\r\nQueen Victoria was now virtually Empress of India; that the\r\ngovernor-general was now her viceroy; that the native princes might rely\r\non the observance by her of all treaties made with them by the Company;\r\nthat she desired no encroachment on, or annexation of, the territories\r\nof those princes; that she would not interfere with the religion of the\r\nnatives, or countenance any favouritism in matters of faith; that creed\r\nor caste should not be a bar to employment in her service; that the\r\nancient legal tenures and forms of India should, as far as possible, be\r\nadhered to; and that all mutineers and rebels, except those whose hands\r\nwere blood-stained by actual murder, should receive a full and gracious\r\npardon on abandoning their acts of insurgency. When these words were\r\nuttered aloud at Bombay (and the ceremony was more or less similar at\r\nthe other cities named) the spectacle was such as the natives of India\r\nhad never before seen. The governor and all the chief civilians; the\r\nmilitary officers and the troops; the clergy of all the various\r\nChristian denominations; the merchants, shipowners, and traders; the\r\nMohammedans, Hindoos, Mahrattas, Parsees—all were represented among the\r\nthrong around the spot from whence the proclamation was read, first in\r\nEnglish, and then in Mahratta. And then the shouting, the music of\r\nmilitary bands, the firing of guns, the waving of flags, the\r\nilluminations at night, the fireworks in the public squares, the\r\nblue-lights and manning of the ships, the banquets in the chief\r\nmansions—all rendered this a day to be borne in remembrance. Sir\r\nJamsetjee Jejeebhoy, the Parsee baronet, vied with the Christians in the\r\nmunificence of rejoicing; and indeed, so little did religious\r\ndifferences mar the harmony of the scene, that Catholic chapels,\r\nMohammedan mosques, Hindoo pagodas, and Parsee temples were alike\r\nlighted up at night. It may not be that every one was enabled to assign\r\ngood reasons for his rejoicing; but there was certainly a pretty general\r\nconcurrence of opinion that the declared sovereignty of Queen Victoria,\r\nas a substitute for the ever-incomprehensible ‘raj’ of the East India\r\nCompany, was a presage of good for British India. At Calcutta, the\r\nproclamation had the singular good-fortune of winning the approval of a\r\ncommunity always very difficult to please. The Europeans consented to\r\nlay aside all minor considerations, in order to do honour to the great\r\nprinciples involved in the proclamation. The natives, too, took their\r\nshare in the rejoicing. A public meeting was held early in the month, at\r\nwhich an influential Hindoo, Baboo Ramgopal Ghose, made an animated\r\nspeech. He said, among other things: ‘If I had power and influence, I\r\nwould proclaim through the length and breadth of this land—from the\r\nHimalayas to Cape Comorin, from the Brahmaputra to the Bay of\r\nCambay—that never were the natives more grievously mistaken than they\r\nhave been in adopting the notion foisted on them by designing and\r\nambitious men—that their religion was at stake; for that notion I\r\nbelieve to have been at the root of the late rebellion.’ Some of the\r\nmore intelligent natives rightly understood the nature of the great\r\nchange made in the government of India; but among the ignorant, it\r\nremained a mystery—rendered, however, very palatable by the open avowal\r\nof a Queen regnant, and of a proclamation breathing sentiments of\r\njustice and kindness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  Chapter xiii., p. 211.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  _Account of the Mutinies in Oudh._\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  _Personal Narrative of the Siege of Lucknow._\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  _Eight Months’ Campaign against the Bengal Sepoy Army._\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  _British India; its Races and its History._\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  _The Sepoy Revolt; its Causes and its Consequences._\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  _Notes on the Revolt in the Northwest Provinces._\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  _Letters of Indophilus to the ‘Times.’_\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  _The Indian Rebellion: its Causes and Results._\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Commander-in-chief proclaims to the people of Oude that, under\r\n  the order of the Right Hon. the Governor-general, he comes to enforce\r\n  the law.\r\n\r\n  ‘In order to effect this without danger to life and property,\r\n  resistance must cease on the part of the people.\r\n\r\n  ‘The most exact discipline will be preserved in the camps and on the\r\n  march; and when there is no resistance, houses and crops will be\r\n  spared, and no plundering allowed in the towns and villages.

But the time at which the\r\nproposal is made, compels your petitioners to regard it as arising from\r\nthe calamitous events which have recently occurred in India.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners challenge the most searching investigation into\r\nthe mutiny of the Bengal army, and the causes, whether remote or\r\nimmediate, which produced that mutiny. They have instructed the\r\ngovernment of India to appoint a commission for conducting such an\r\ninquiry on the spot; and it is their most anxious wish that a similar\r\ninquiry may be instituted in this country by your [lordships’]\r\nhonourable House, in order that it may be ascertained whether anything,\r\neither in the constitution of the home government of India, or in the\r\nconduct of those by whom it has been administered, has had any share in\r\nproducing the mutiny, or has in any way impeded the measures for its\r\nsuppression; and whether the mutiny itself, or any circumstance\r\nconnected with it, affords any evidence of the failure of the\r\narrangements under which India is at present administered.\r\n\r\nThat were it even true that these arrangements had failed, the failure\r\ncould constitute no reason for divesting the East India Company of its\r\nfunctions, and transferring them to her Majesty’s government. For, under\r\nthe existing system, her Majesty’s government have the deciding voice.\r\nThe duty imposed upon the Court of Directors is, to originate measures\r\nand frame drafts of instructions. Even had they been remiss in this\r\nduty, their remissness, however discreditable to themselves, could in no\r\nway absolve the responsibility of her Majesty’s government; since the\r\nminister for India possesses, and has frequently exercised, the power of\r\nrequiring that the Court of Directors should take any subject into\r\nconsideration, and prepare a draft-dispatch for his approval. Her\r\nMajesty’s government are thus in the fullest sense accountable for all\r\nthat has been done, and for all that has been forborne or omitted to be\r\ndone. Your petitioners, on the other hand, are accountable only in so\r\nfar as the act or omission has been promoted by themselves.\r\n\r\nThat under these circumstances, if the administration of India had been\r\na failure, it would, your petitioners submit, have been somewhat\r\nunreasonable, to expect that a remedy would be found in annihilating the\r\nbranch of the ruling authority which could not be the one principally in\r\nfault, and might be altogether blameless, in order to concentrate all\r\npowers in the branch which had necessarily the decisive share in every\r\nerror, real or supposed. To believe that the administration of India\r\nwould have been more free from error, had it been conducted by a\r\nminister of the Crown without the aid of the Court of Directors, would\r\nbe to believe that the minister, with full power to govern India as he\r\npleased, has governed ill because he has had the assistance of\r\nexperienced and responsible advisers.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners, however, do not seek to vindicate themselves at\r\nthe expense of any other authority; they claim their full share of the\r\nresponsibility of the manner in which India has practically been\r\ngoverned. That responsibility is to them not a subject of humiliation,\r\nbut of pride. They are conscious that their advice and initiative have\r\nbeen, and have deserved to be, a great and potent element in the conduct\r\nof affairs in India. And they feel complete assurance, that the more\r\nattention is bestowed, and the more light thrown upon India and its\r\nadministration, the more evident it will become, that the government in\r\nwhich they have borne a part, has been not only one of the purest in\r\nintention, but one of the most beneficent in act, ever known among\r\nmankind; that during the last and present generations in particular, it\r\nhas been, in all departments, one of the most rapidly improving\r\ngovernments in the world; and that, at the time when this change is\r\nproposed, a greater number of important improvements are in a state of\r\nrapid progress than at any former period. And they are satisfied that\r\nwhatever further improvements may be hereafter effected in India, can\r\nonly consist in the development of germs already planted, and in\r\nbuilding on foundations already laid, under their authority, and in a\r\ngreat measure by their express instructions.\r\n\r\nThat such, however, is not the impression likely to be made on the\r\npublic mind, either in England or in India, by the ejection of your\r\npetitioners from the place they fill in the Indian administration. It is\r\nnot usual with statesmen to propose the complete abolition of a system\r\nof government of which the practical operation is not condemned. It\r\nmight therefore be generally inferred from the proposed measures, if\r\ncarried into effect at the present time, that the East India Company\r\nhaving been intrusted with an important portion of the administration of\r\nIndia, have so abused their trust, as to have produced a sanguinary\r\ninsurrection, and nearly lost India to the British empire; and that\r\nhaving thus crowned a long career of misgovernment, they have, in\r\ndeference to public indignation, been deservedly cashiered for their\r\nmisconduct.\r\n\r\nThat if the character of the East India Company were alone concerned,\r\nyour petitioners might be willing to await the verdict of history. They\r\nare satisfied that posterity will do them justice. And they are\r\nconfident that, even now, justice is done to them in the minds, not only\r\nof her Majesty’s ministers, but of all who have any claim to be\r\ncompetent judges of the subject. But though your petitioners could\r\nafford to wait for the reversal of the verdict of condemnation which\r\nwill be believed throughout the world to have been passed on them and\r\ntheir government by the British nation, your petitioners cannot look\r\nwithout the deepest uneasiness at the effect likely to be produced on\r\nthe minds of the people of India. To them—however incorrectly the name\r\nmay express the fact—the British government in India is the government\r\nof the East India Company. To their minds, the abolition of the Company\r\nwill, for some time to come, mean the abolition of the whole system of\r\nadministration with which the Company is identified. The measure,\r\nintroduced simultaneously with the influx of an overwhelming British\r\nforce, will be coincident with a general outcry, in itself most alarming\r\nto their fears, from most of the organs of opinion in this country, as\r\nwell as of English opinion in India, denouncing the past policy of the\r\ngovernment on the express ground that it has been too forbearing, and\r\ntoo considerate towards the natives. The people of India will at first\r\nfeel no certainty that the new government, or the government under a new\r\nname, which it is proposed to introduce, will hold itself bound by the\r\npledges of its predecessors. They will be slow to believe that a\r\ngovernment has been destroyed, only to be followed by another which will\r\nact on the same principles, and adhere to the same measures. They cannot\r\nsuppose that the existing organ of administration would be swept away\r\nwithout the intention of reversing any part of its policy. They will see\r\nthe authorities, both at home and in India, surrounded by persons\r\nvehemently urging radical changes in many parts of that policy.\r\nInterpreting, as they must do, the change in the instrument of\r\ngovernment as a concession to these opinions and feelings, they can\r\nhardly fail to believe that, whatever else may be intended, the\r\ngovernment will no longer be permitted to observe that strict\r\nimpartiality between those who profess its own creed and those who hold\r\nthe creeds of its native subjects, which hitherto characterised it; that\r\ntheir strongest and most deeply rooted feelings will henceforth be\r\ntreated with much less regard than heretofore; and that a directly\r\naggressive policy towards everything in their habits, or in their usages\r\nand customs, which Englishmen deem objectionable, will be no longer\r\nconfined to individuals and private associations, but will be backed by\r\nall the power of government.\r\n\r\nAnd here your petitioners think it important to observe, that in\r\nabstaining as they have done from all interference with any of the\r\nreligious practices of the people of India, except such as are abhorrent\r\nto humanity, they have acted not only from their own conviction of what\r\nis just and expedient, but in accordance with the avowed intentions and\r\nexpress enactments of the legislature, framed ‘in order that regard\r\nshould be had to the civil and religious usages of the natives,’ and\r\nalso ‘that suits, civil or criminal, against the natives,’ should be\r\nconducted according to such rules ‘as may accommodate the same to the\r\nreligion and manners of the natives.’ That their policy in this respect\r\nhas been successful, is evidenced by the fact that, during a military\r\nmutiny, said to have been caused by unfounded apprehensions of danger to\r\nreligion, the heads of the native states and the masses of the\r\npopulation have remained faithful to the British government. Your\r\npetitioners need hardly observe, how very different would probably have\r\nbeen the issue of the late events if the native princes, instead of\r\naiding in the suppression of the rebellion, had put themselves at its\r\nhead, or if the general population had joined in the revolt; and how\r\nprobable it is that both these contingencies would have occurred if any\r\nreal ground had been given for the persuasion that the British\r\ngovernment intended to identify itself with proselytism. It is the\r\nhonest conviction of your petitioners, that any serious apprehension of\r\na change of policy in this respect would be likely to be followed, at no\r\ndistant period, by a general rising throughout India.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners have seen with the greatest pain, the\r\ndemonstrations of indiscriminate animosity towards the natives of India\r\non the part of our countrymen in India and at home, which have grown up\r\nsince the late unhappy events. They believe these sentiments to be\r\nfundamentally unjust; they know them to be fatal to the possibility of\r\ngood government in India. They feel that if such demonstrations should\r\ncontinue, and especially if weight be added to them by legislating under\r\ntheir supposed influence, no amount of wisdom and forbearance on the\r\npart of the government will avail to restore that confidence of the\r\ngoverned in the intentions of their rulers, without which it is vain\r\neven to attempt the improvement of the people.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners cannot contemplate without dismay the doctrine now\r\nwidely promulgated, that India should be administered with an especial\r\nview to the benefit of the English who reside there—or that in its\r\nadministration any advantages should be sought for her Majesty’s\r\nsubjects of European birth, except that which they will necessarily\r\nderive from their superiority of intelligence, and from the increased\r\nprosperity of the people, the improvement of the productive resources of\r\nthe country, and the extension of commercial intercourse. Your\r\npetitioners regard it as the most honourable characteristic of the\r\ngovernment of India by England, that it has acknowledged no such\r\ndistinction as that of a dominant and a subject race; but has held that\r\nits first duty was to the people of India. Your petitioners feel that a\r\ngreat portion of the hostility with which they are assailed, is caused\r\nby the belief that they are peculiarly the guardians of this principle,\r\nand that, so long as they have any voice in the administration of India,\r\nit cannot easily be infringed; and your petitioners will not conceal\r\ntheir belief that their exclusion from any part in the government is\r\nlikely, at the present time, to be regarded in India as a first\r\nsuccessful attack on that principle.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners, therefore, most earnestly represent to your\r\n[lordships’] honourable House that even if the contemplated change could\r\nbe proved to be in itself advisable, the present is a most unsuitable\r\ntime for entertaining it; and they most strongly and respectfully urge\r\non your [lordships’] honourable House the expediency of at least\r\ndeferring any such change until it can be effected at a period when it\r\nwould not be, in the minds of the people of India, directly connected\r\nwith the recent calamitous events, and with the feelings to which those\r\nevents have either given rise, or have afforded an opportunity of\r\nmanifestation. Such postponement, your petitioners submit, would allow\r\ntime for a more mature consideration than has yet been given, or can be\r\ngiven in the present excited state of the public mind, to the various\r\nquestions connected with the organisation of a government for India; and\r\nwould enable the most competent minds in the nation calmly to examine\r\nwhether any new arrangement can be devised for the home government of\r\nIndia uniting a greater number of the conditions of good administration\r\nthan the present, and if so, which, among the numerous schemes which\r\nhave been or may be proposed, possesses those requisites in the greatest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners have always willingly acquiesced in any changes\r\nwhich, after discussion by parliament, were deemed conducive to the\r\ngeneral welfare, although such changes may have involved important\r\nsacrifices to themselves. They would refer to their partial\r\nrelinquishment of trade in 1813; to its total abandonment, and the\r\nplacing of their commercial charter in abeyance in 1833; to the transfer\r\nto India of their commercial assets, amounting to £15,858,000, a sum\r\ngreatly exceeding that ultimately repayable to them in respect of their\r\ncapital, independent of territorial rights and claims; and to their\r\nconcurrence, in 1853, in the measure by which the Court of Directors was\r\nreconstructed, and reduced to its present number. In the same spirit,\r\nyour petitioners would most gladly co-operate with her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment in correcting any defects which may be considered to exist in\r\nthe details of the present system; and they would be prepared, without a\r\nmurmur, to relinquish their trust altogether, if a better system for the\r\ncontrol of the government of India can be devised. But as they believe\r\nthat, in the construction of such a system, there are conditions which\r\ncannot, without the most dangerous consequences, be departed from, your\r\npetitioners respectfully and deferentially submit to the judgment of\r\nyour [lordships’] honourable House their view of those conditions, in\r\nthe hope that if your [lordships’] honourable House should see reason to\r\nagree in that view, you will withhold your legislative sanction from any\r\narrangement for the government of India which does not fulfil the\r\nconditions in question in at least an equal degree with the present.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners may venture to assume that it will not be proposed\r\nto vest the home portion of the administration of India in a minister of\r\nthe Crown, without the adjunct of a council composed of statesmen\r\nexperienced in Indian affairs. Her Majesty’s ministers cannot but be\r\naware that the knowledge necessary for governing a foreign country, and\r\nin particular a country like India, requires as much special study as\r\nany other profession, and cannot possibly be possessed by any one who\r\nhas not devoted a considerable portion of his life to the acquisition of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat in constituting a body of experienced advisers, to be associated\r\nwith the Indian minister, your petitioners consider it indispensable to\r\nbear in mind that this body should not only be qualified to advise the\r\nminister, but also, by its advice, to exercise, to a certain degree, a\r\nmoral check. It cannot be expected that the minister, as a general rule,\r\nshould himself know India; while he will be exposed to perpetual\r\nsolicitations from individuals and bodies, either entirely ignorant of\r\nthat country, or knowing only enough of it to impose on those who know\r\nstill less than themselves, and having very frequently objects in view\r\nother than the interests or good government of India. The influences\r\nlikely to be brought to bear on him through the organs of popular\r\nopinion will, in the majority of cases, be equally misleading. The\r\npublic opinion of England, itself necessarily unacquainted with Indian\r\naffairs, can only follow the promptings of those who take most pains to\r\ninfluence it; and these will generally be such as have some private\r\ninterest to serve. It is, therefore, your petitioners submit, of the\r\nutmost importance that any council which may form a part of the home\r\ngovernment of India should derive sufficient weight from its\r\nconstitution, and from the relation it occupies to the minister, to be a\r\nsubstantial barrier against those inroads of self-interest and ignorance\r\nin this country from which the government of India has hitherto been\r\ncomparatively free, but against which it would be too much to expect\r\nthat parliament should of itself afford a sufficient protection.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners cannot well conceive a worse form of government\r\nfor India, than a minister with a council whom he should be at liberty\r\nto consult or not at his pleasure, or whose advice he should be able to\r\ndisregard without giving his reasons in writing, and in a manner likely\r\nto carry conviction. Such an arrangement, your petitioners submit, would\r\nbe really liable to the objections in their opinion erroneously urged\r\nagainst the present system. Your petitioners respectfully represent that\r\nany body of persons associated with the minister, which is not a check,\r\nwill be a screen. Unless the council is so constituted as to be\r\npersonally independent of the minister; unless it feels itself\r\nresponsible for recording an opinion on every Indian subject, and\r\npressing that opinion on the minister, whether it is agreeable to him or\r\nnot; and unless the minister, when he overrules their opinion, is bound\r\nto record his reasons—its existence will only serve to weaken his\r\nresponsibility, and to give the colourable sanction of prudence and\r\nexperience to measures in the framing of which those qualities have had\r\nno share.\r\n\r\nThat it would be vain to expect that a new council could have as much\r\nmoral influence, and power of asserting its opinion with effect, as the\r\nCourt of Directors. A new body can no more succeed to the feelings and\r\nauthority which their antiquity and their historical antecedents give to\r\nthe East India Company, than a legislature, under a new name, sitting in\r\nWestminster, would have the moral ascendency of the Houses of Lords and\r\nCommons. One of the most important elements of usefulness will thus be\r\nnecessarily wanting in any newly constituted Indian Council, as compared\r\nwith the present.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners find it difficult to conceive that the same\r\nindependence, in judgment and act, which characterises the Court of\r\nDirectors will be found in any council all of whose members are\r\nnominated by the crown. Owing their nomination to the same authority,\r\nmany of them probably to the same individual minister whom they are\r\nappointed to check, and looking to him alone for their re-appointment,\r\ntheir desire of recommending themselves to him, and their unwillingness\r\nto risk his displeasure by any serious resistance to his wishes, will be\r\nmotives too strong not to be in danger of exercising a powerful and\r\ninjurious influence over their conduct. Nor are your petitioners aware\r\nof any mode in which that injurious influence could be guarded against,\r\nexcept by conferring the appointments, like those of the judges, during\r\ngood behaviour; which, by rendering it impossible to correct an error\r\nonce committed, would be seriously objectionable.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners are equally unable to perceive how, if the\r\ncontrolling body is entirely nominated by the minister, that happy\r\nindependence of parliamentary and party influence which has hitherto\r\ndistinguished the administration of India, and the appointment to\r\nsituations of trust and importance in that country, can be expected to\r\ncontinue. Your petitioners believe that in no government known to\r\nhistory have appointments to offices, and especially to high offices,\r\nbeen so rarely bestowed on any other considerations than those of\r\npersonal fitness. This characteristic, but for which, in all\r\nprobability, India would long since have been lost to this country, is,\r\nyour petitioners conceive, entirely owing to the circumstance that the\r\ndispensers of patronage have been persons unconnected with party, and\r\nunder no necessity of conciliating parliamentary support; that\r\nconsequently the appointments to offices in India have been, as a rule,\r\nleft to the unbiassed judgment of the local authorities; while the\r\nnominations to the civil and military services have been generally\r\nbestowed on the middle classes, irrespective of political\r\nconsiderations, and in a large proportion on the relatives of persons\r\nwho had distinguished themselves by their services in India.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners therefore think it essential that at least a\r\nmajority of the council which assists the minister for India with its\r\nadvice, should hold their seats independently of his appointment.\r\n\r\nThat it is, in the opinion of your petitioners, no less necessary that\r\nthe order of the transaction of business should be such as to make the\r\nparticipation of the council in the administration of India a\r\nsubstantial one. That to this end it is, in the opinion of your\r\npetitioners, indispensable that the dispatches to India should not be\r\nprepared by the minister, and laid before the council, but should be\r\nprepared by the council, and submitted to the minister. This would be in\r\naccordance with the natural and obvious principle, that persons, chosen\r\nfor their knowledge of a subject, should suggest the mode of dealing\r\nwith it, instead of merely giving their opinion on suggestions coming\r\nfrom elsewhere. This is also the only mode in which the members of the\r\ncouncil can feel themselves sufficiently important, or sufficiently\r\nresponsible, to secure their applying their minds to the subjects before\r\nthem. It is almost unnecessary for your petitioners to observe, that the\r\nmind is called into far more vigorous action, by being required to\r\npropose, than by merely being called on to assent. The minister has\r\nnecessarily the ultimate decision. If he has also the initiative, he has\r\nall the powers which are of any practical moment. A body whose only\r\nrecognised function is to find fault, would speedily let that function\r\nfall into desuetude. They would feel that their co-operation in\r\nconducting the government of India was not really desired; that they\r\nwere only felt as a clog on the wheels of business. Their criticism on\r\nwhat had been decided, without their being collectively consulted, would\r\nbe felt as importunate as a mere delay and impediment; and their office\r\nwould probably be seldom sought, but by those who were willing to allow\r\nits most important duties to become nominal.\r\n\r\nThat, with the duty of preparing the dispatches to India would naturally\r\nbe combined the nomination and control of the home establishments. This\r\nyour petitioners consider absolutely essential to the utility of the\r\ncouncil. If the officers through whom they work are in direct dependence\r\nupon an authority higher than theirs, all matters of importance will in\r\nreality be settled between the minister and the subordinates, passing\r\nover the council altogether.\r\n\r\nThat a third consideration to which your petitioners attach great\r\nimportance, is, that the number of the council should not be too\r\nrestricted. India is so wide a field, that a practical acquaintance with\r\nevery part of its affairs cannot be found combined in any small number\r\nof individuals. The council ought to contain men of general experience\r\nand knowledge of the world, also men specially qualified by financial\r\nand revenue experience, by judicial experience, diplomatic experience,\r\nmilitary experience; it ought to contain persons conversant with the\r\nvaried social relations, and varied institutions of Bengal, Madras,\r\nBombay, the Northwestern Provinces, the Punjaub, and the native states.\r\nEven the present Court of Directors, reduced as it is in numbers by the\r\nact of 1853, does not contain all the varieties of knowledge and\r\nexperience desirable in such a body; neither, your petitioners submit,\r\nwould it be safe to limit the number to that which would be strictly\r\nsufficient, supposing all the appointments to be the best possible. A\r\ncertain margin should be allowed for failures, which, even with the most\r\nconscientious selection, will sometimes occur. Your petitioners,\r\nmoreover, cannot overlook the possibility, that if the nomination takes\r\nplace by ministers at the head of a political party, it will not always\r\nbe made with exclusive reference to personal qualifications; and it is\r\nindispensable to provide that such errors or faults in the nominating\r\nauthority, so long as they are only occasional, shall not seriously\r\nimpair the efficiency of the body.\r\n\r\nThat while these considerations plead strongly for a body not less\r\nnumerous than the present, even if only regarded as advisers of the\r\nminister; their other office, as a check on the minister, forms, your\r\npetitioners submit, a no less forcible objection to any considerable\r\nreduction of the present number. A body of six or eight will not be\r\nequal to one of eighteen in that feeling of independent self-reliance\r\nwhich is necessary to induce a public body to press its opinion on a\r\nminister to whom that opinion is unacceptable. However unobjectionably\r\nin other respects so small a body may be constituted, reluctance to give\r\noffence will be likely, unless in extreme cases, to be a stronger\r\nhabitual inducement in their minds than the desire to stand up for their\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nThat if, in the opinion of your [lordships’] honourable House, a body\r\ncan be constituted which unites the above enumerated requisites of good\r\ngovernment, in a greater degree than the Court of Directors, your\r\npetitioners have only to express their humble hope that your endeavours\r\nfor that purpose may be successful. But if, in enumerating the\r\nconditions of a good system of home government for India, your\r\npetitioners have, in fact, enumerated the qualities possessed by the\r\npresent system, then your petitioners pray that your [lordships’]\r\nhonourable House will continue the existing powers of the Court of\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners are aware that the present home government of\r\nIndia is reproached with being a double government; and that any\r\narrangement by which an independent check is provided to the discretion\r\nof the minister, will be liable to a similar reproach. But they conceive\r\nthat this accusation originates in an entire misconception of the\r\nfunctions devolving on the home government of India, and in the\r\napplication to it of the principles applicable to purely executive\r\ndepartments. The executive government of India is, and must be, seated\r\nin India itself. The Court of Directors is not so much an executive as a\r\ndeliberative body. Its principal function, and that of the home\r\ngovernment generally, is not to direct the details of administration,\r\nbut to scrutinise and revise the past acts of the Indian government—to\r\nlay down principles and issue general instructions for their future\r\nguidance—and to give or refuse sanction to great political measures,\r\nwhich are referred home for approval. These duties are more analogous to\r\nthe functions of parliament than to those of an executive board; and it\r\nmight almost as well be said that parliament, as that the government of\r\nIndia, should be constituted on the principles applicable to executive\r\nboards. It is considered an excellence, not a defect in the constitution\r\nof parliament, to be not merely a double but a triple government. An\r\nexecutive authority, your petitioners submit, may often with advantage\r\nbe single, because promptitude is its first requisite. But the function\r\nof passing a deliberate opinion on past measures, and laying down\r\nprinciples of future policy, is a business which, in the estimation of\r\nyour petitioners, admits of and requires the concurrence of more\r\njudgments than one. It is no defect in such a body to be double, and no\r\nexcellence to be single, especially when it can only be made so by\r\ncutting off that branch of it which, by previous training, is always the\r\nbest prepared—and often the only one which is prepared at all—for its\r\npeculiar duty.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners have heard it asserted that, in consequence of\r\nwhat is called the double government, the Indian authorities are less\r\nresponsible to parliament and the nation than other departments of the\r\ngovernment of the empire, since it is impossible to know on which of the\r\ntwo branches of home government the responsibility ought to rest. Your\r\npetitioners fearlessly affirm that this impression is not only\r\ngroundless, but the very reverse of the truth. The home government of\r\nIndia is not less, but more responsible than any other branch of the\r\nadministration of the state; inasmuch as the president of the Board of\r\nCommissioners, who is the minister for India, is as completely\r\nresponsible as any other of her Majesty’s ministers; and, in addition,\r\nhis advisers also are responsible. It is always certain, in the case of\r\nIndia, that the president of the Board of Commissioners must have either\r\ncommanded or sanctioned all that has been done. No more than this, your\r\npetitioners would submit, can be known in the case of the head of any\r\ndepartment of her Majesty’s government. For it is not, nor can it\r\nrationally be supposed, that any minister of the Crown is without\r\ntrusted advisers; and the minister for India must, for obvious reasons,\r\nbe more dependent than any other of her Majesty’s ministers, upon the\r\nadvice of persons whose lives have been devoted to the subject on which\r\ntheir advice has been given. But in the case of India such advisers are\r\nassigned to him by the constitution of the government, and they are as\r\nmuch responsible for what they advise, as he for what he ordains; while,\r\nin other departments, the minister’s only official advisers are the\r\nsubordinates in his office, men often of great skill and experience, but\r\nnot in the public eye, often unknown to the public even by name;\r\nofficial reserve precludes the possibility of ascertaining what advice\r\nthey give, and they are responsible only to the minister himself. By\r\nwhat application of terms this can be called responsible government, and\r\nthe joint government of your petitioners and the India Board an\r\nirresponsible government, your petitioners think it unnecessary to ask.\r\n\r\nThat, without knowing the plan on which her Majesty’s ministers\r\ncontemplate the transfer to the Crown of the servants of the Company,\r\nyour petitioners find themselves unable to approach the delicate\r\nquestion of the Indian army, further than to point out that the high\r\nmilitary qualities of the officers of that army have unquestionably\r\nsprung, in a great degree, from its being a principal and substantive\r\narmy, holding her Majesty’s commissions, and enjoying equal rank with\r\nher Majesty’s officers; and your petitioners would earnestly deprecate\r\nany change in that position.\r\n\r\nThat your petitioners having regard to all these considerations, humbly\r\npray your [lordships’] honourable House that you will not give your\r\nsanction to any change in the constitution of the Indian government\r\nduring the continuance of the present unhappy disturbances, nor without\r\na full previous inquiry into the operation of the present system. And\r\nyour petitioners further pray, that this inquiry may extend to every\r\ndepartment of Indian administration. Such an inquiry your petitioners\r\nrespectfully claim, not only as a matter of justice to themselves, but\r\nbecause, when, for the first time in this century, the thoughts of every\r\npublic man in the country are fixed on India, an inquiry would be more\r\nthorough, and its results would carry much more instruction to the mind\r\nof parliament and of the country, than at any preceding period.\r\n\r\n\r\n _E. I. Company’s Objections to the First and Second India Bills: April\r\n                          1858._ (See p. 567.)\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of your Directors to lay before the Proprietors the two\r\nbills which have been introduced into parliament by the late and by the\r\npresent ministry, for divesting the East India Company of all\r\nparticipation in the government of India, and for framing a new scheme\r\nof administrative agency.\r\n\r\nOn former occasions, when the ministers of the Crown have submitted\r\nmeasures to parliament for altering, in any manner, the constitution of\r\nthe Indian government, the substance of the measures has been officially\r\ncommunicated to the Court of Directors, and an opportunity allowed to\r\nthem of offering such remarks as their knowledge and experience in\r\nIndian affairs might suggest. The correspondence being afterwards laid\r\nbefore the Court of Proprietors, formed the most appropriate report\r\nwhich the Directors could make to their constituents on the measures\r\nunder consideration by the legislature. In the present instance, this\r\nopportunity not having been afforded to them, it appears desirable that\r\nthey should adopt the present mode of laying before the proprietary body\r\nthe observations which it is entitled to expect from its executive\r\norgan, on the bills now before parliament, and on the present posture of\r\nthe Company’s affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Directors cannot but advert with feelings of satisfaction to the\r\naltered tone which public discussion has assumed in regard to the\r\ncharacter of the East India Company, and the merits of the\r\nadministration in which the Company has borne so important a part. The\r\nintention of proposing the abolition of the Company’s government was\r\nannounced in the midst of, and it may be surmised in deference to, a\r\nclamour, which represented the government of India by the Company as\r\ncharacterised by nearly every fault of which a civilised government can\r\nbe accused, and the Company as the main cause of the recent disasters.\r\nBut in the parliamentary discussions which have lately taken place,\r\nthere has been an almost universal acknowledgment that the rule of the\r\nCompany has been honourable to themselves and beneficial to India; while\r\nno political party, and few individuals of any consideration, have\r\nalleged anything seriously disparaging to the general character of the\r\nCompany’s administration. So far, therefore, the stand made by the\r\nCompany against the calumnies with which they have been assailed, may be\r\nconsidered to have been successful.\r\n\r\nBut the admission generally made, and made explicitly by the proposers\r\nof both the bills, that the existing system works well, has not had the\r\neffect of inducing doubt of the wisdom of hastily abolishing it. Neither\r\ndoes it seem to have been remembered, that if the system has worked\r\nwell, there must be some causes for its having done so, and that it\r\nwould be worth while to consider what these are, in order that they\r\nmight be retained in any new system. If the constitution which has made\r\nthe Indian government what it is, must be abolished, because it is\r\nthought defective in theory, what is substituted should at least be\r\ntheoretically unobjectionable. But the constitution of the East India\r\nCompany, however anomalous, is far more in accordance with the\r\nacknowledged principles of good government than either of the proposed\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the case is, indeed, itself so anomalous, that something\r\nanomalous was to be expected in the means by which it could be\r\nsuccessfully dealt with.\r\n\r\nAll English institutions and modes of political action are adapted to\r\nthe case of a nation governing itself. In India, the case to be provided\r\nfor is that of the government of one nation by another, separated from\r\nit by half the globe; unlike it in everything which characterises a\r\npeople; as a whole, totally unacquainted with it; and without time or\r\nmeans for acquiring knowledge of it or its affairs.\r\n\r\nHistory presents only two instances in which these or similar\r\ndifficulties have been in any considerable degree surmounted. One is the\r\nRoman Empire; the other is the government of India by the East India\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe means which the bills provide for overcoming these difficulties\r\nconsist of the unchecked power of a minister. There is no difference of\r\nmoment in this respect between the two bills. The minister, it is true,\r\nis to have a council. But the most despotic rulers have councils. The\r\ndifference between the council of a despot and a council which prevents\r\nthe ruler from being a despot is, that the one is dependent on him, the\r\nother independent; that the one has some power of its own, the other has\r\nnot. By the first bill, the whole council is nominated by the minister;\r\nby the second, one-half of it is nominated by him. The functions to be\r\nintrusted to it are left, in both, with some slight exceptions, to the\r\nminister’s own discretion.\r\n\r\nThe minister is indeed subject to the control of parliament and of the\r\nBritish nation. But though parliament and the nation exercise a salutary\r\ncontrol over their own affairs, it would be contrary to all experience\r\nto suppose that they will exercise it over the affairs of a hundred\r\nmillions of Hindoos and Mohammedans. Habitually, they will doubtless be\r\nhereafter, as they have been heretofore, indifferent and inattentive to\r\nIndian affairs, and will leave them entirely to the minister. The\r\nconsequence will be, that in the exceptional cases in which they do\r\ninterfere, the interference will not be grounded on knowledge of the\r\nsubject, and will probably be, for the most part, confined to cases\r\nwhere an Indian question is taken up from party motives, as the means of\r\ninjuring a minister; or when some Indian malcontent, generally with\r\nobjects opposed to good government, succeeds in interesting the\r\nsympathies of the public in his favour. For it is not the people of\r\nIndia, but rich individuals and societies representing class interests,\r\nwho have the means of engaging the ear of the public through the press,\r\nand through agents in parliament. And it is important to remark, that by\r\nthe provisions of either of the bills, the House of Commons will be\r\nrendered even less competent, in point of knowledge of Indian affairs,\r\nthan at present, since by both bills all the members of the Council of\r\nIndia will be excluded from it.\r\n\r\nThe government of dependencies by a minister and his subordinates, under\r\nthe sole control of parliament, is not a new experiment in England. That\r\nform of colonial government lost the United States, and had nearly lost\r\nall the colonies of any considerable population and importance. The\r\ncolonial administration of this country has only ceased to be a subject\r\nof general condemnation since the principle has been adopted of leaving\r\nall the important colonies to manage their own affairs—a course which\r\ncannot be followed with the people of India. If the control of\r\nparliament has not prevented the habitual mismanagement of countries\r\ninhabited by Englishmen like ourselves, who had every facility for\r\nrepresenting and urging their grievances, it is not likely to be any\r\neffectual protection to Mussulmans and Hindoos.\r\n\r\nAll governments require constitutional checks; but the constitutional\r\nchecks applicable to a case of this peculiar kind must be found within\r\nthe governing body itself.\r\n\r\nThough England, as a whole, while desiring nothing but to govern India\r\nwell, is necessarily ignorant of India, and feels, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, no particular interest in its concerns, there are in\r\nEngland a certain number of persons who possess knowledge of India, and\r\nfeel an interest in its affairs. It seems, therefore, very desirable,\r\nfor the sake of India, that England should govern it through, and by\r\nmeans of, these persons. This would be the case if the organ of\r\ngovernment principally consisted of persons who have passed a\r\nconsiderable portion of their lives in India, or who feel that habitual\r\ninterest in its affairs which is naturally acquired by having aided in\r\nadministering them; and if this body, or a majority of it, were\r\nperiodically elected by a constituency composed of persons in England\r\nwho have served the government for a certain length of time in India, or\r\nwhose interests are connected with that country by some permanent tie.\r\nIt would be an additional advantage if this constituency had the power\r\nof requiring information, and compelling a public discussion of Indian\r\nquestions. These are conditions which, to a considerable extent, the\r\nexisting constitution of the East India Company fulfils.\r\n\r\nThe other great constitutional security for the good government of India\r\nlies in the forms of business. This is a point to which sufficient\r\nimportance is not generally attached. The forms of business are the real\r\nconstitution of India.\r\n\r\nFrom the necessity of the case, recognised in both the proposed\r\nmeasures, the administration must be shared, in some proportion, between\r\na minister and a council. The council may consist of persons possessing\r\nknowledge of India. The minister, except in very rare cases, can possess\r\nlittle or none. He is placed in office by the action of political party,\r\nwhich is governed by considerations totally unconnected with India; and,\r\nin the common course of politics, he is removed from office by the time\r\nhe has been able to learn his duty. Even in the unusual case, of which\r\npresent circumstances are an example, when the minister has made himself\r\nacquainted with India through the discharge of high functions in India\r\nitself, his knowledge is but the knowledge of one man; and one man’s\r\nknowledge of a subject like India, until corrected and completed by that\r\nof other men, is, it may safely be affirmed, wholly insufficient, and if\r\nimplicitly trusted, even dangerous. The good government, therefore, of\r\nIndia, by a minister and a council, depends upon the amount of influence\r\npossessed by the council; and their influence depends upon the forms of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHowever experienced may be the council, and however inexperienced the\r\nminister, he will have the deciding voice. The power will rest with one\r\nwho may know less of the subject than any member of the council, and is\r\nsure to know less than the council collectively, if they are selected\r\nwith ordinary judgment. The council will have no substantive power, but\r\nonly moral influence. It is, therefore, all-important that this\r\ninfluence should be upheld. Unless the forms of business are such as to\r\ninsure that the council shall exercise its judgment on all questions;\r\nthat all matters requiring decision shall be considered by them, and\r\ntheir views recorded in the initiatory stage, before the minister has\r\ncommitted himself to an opinion—they will possess no more weight or\r\ninfluence than the same number of clerks in his office, whom also he can\r\nconsult if he pleases; and the power of the minister will be practically\r\nuncontrolled.\r\n\r\nIn both the bills these considerations are entirely disregarded. The\r\nfirst bill does not establish any forms of business, but leaves them to\r\nbe determined by the minister and his council; in other words, by the\r\nminister. Even, therefore, if the minister first appointed should be\r\nwilling to establish forms which would be any restraint upon himself, a\r\nsubsequent minister would have it in his power to alter the forms in any\r\nmanner he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe second bill, unlike the first, does establish forms of business; but\r\nsuch alone as would effectually prevent the council from being a\r\nreality, and would render it a useless pageant.\r\n\r\nTo make the council a merely consultative body, without initiative,\r\nbefore whom subjects are only brought after the minister has made up his\r\nmind, is already a fatal inroad upon its usefulness. But by the second\r\nbill the council are not even a consultative body. The minister is under\r\nno obligation to consult them. They are not empowered to hold any\r\nregular meetings. They are to meet only when the minister convenes them,\r\nor on a special requisition by six members. He may send orders to India\r\nwithout their knowledge when the case is urgent, of which urgency he is\r\nthe sole judge. When it is not urgent, his orders must be placed in the\r\ncouncil-room for the perusal of the members for seven days, during which\r\nthey are not required, but permitted, to give their opinion, not\r\ncollectively, but individually. Their only power, therefore, is that of\r\nrecording dissent from a resolution not only taken, but embodied in a\r\ndispatch. And as if this was not enough, provision is made that an\r\noffice, always invidious, shall be incapable of being fulfilled in any\r\nbut the most invidious manner. The members of council must come forward\r\nindividually in declared opposition to the minister, by volunteering a\r\nprotest against his announced intentions, or signing a requisition for a\r\nmeeting of council to oppose them. Such a council is fitted to serve as\r\na shield for the minister’s responsibility when it may suit him to seek,\r\nand them to accord, their adhesion; rather than as a restraint on his\r\npower to administer India according to his individual pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Directors are bound to admit, that the first of the bills contains\r\nseveral provisions indicative of a wish to assure to the council a\r\ncertain, though small, amount of influence. The administration is to be\r\ncarried on in the name of the president in council, and not, as by the\r\nsecond bill, in that of the Secretary of State alone. The council, as\r\nwell as the president, has a voice in the appointment of the home\r\nestablishment; while in the second bill all promotions and all\r\nappointments to the principal offices under the council, rest with the\r\nSecretary of State, exclusively; a provision which divests the council\r\nof all control or authority over their own establishment. Again, by\r\nSection XII. of the first bill, no grant involving increase of\r\nexpenditure, and no appointment to office or admission to service, can\r\nbe made without the concurrence of half the council. This, as far as it\r\ngoes, is a real power; but its value is much diminished by the\r\nconsideration that those by whom it is to be exercised are the nominees\r\nof the minister, dependent on him for their continuance in office after\r\na few years.\r\n\r\nIn some other points the provisions of the second bill seem to have the\r\nadvantage. Its council is more numerous; to which, however, little\r\nimportance can be attached, if the council has no substantial power. It\r\nalso recognises that the whole of the council ought not to be nominated\r\nby the minister, and that some part of it should be elected by a\r\nconstituency specially qualified by a knowledge of India. But even in\r\nthese, the best points of the bill, it is, in the opinion of the\r\nDirectors, very far from unexceptionable. The nomination of even half\r\nthe council by the minister, takes away all security for an independent\r\nmajority. It may, indeed, be doubted whether there is any sufficient\r\nreason for the minister’s nominating any portion, except the supposed\r\nreluctance of some eligible persons to encounter a canvass. The\r\nproportion of one-third, whom the minister now nominates to the Court of\r\nDirectors, seems the largest which, consistently with full security for\r\nindependence, can be so appointed.\r\n\r\nThe provision that each of the members nominated by the Crown shall be\r\nselected as the representative of some particular branch of the service\r\nin India, is still more objectionable. Not only would it preclude the\r\nnomination of the most distinguished man, if the seat in council\r\nappropriated to the department in which he had served were not at the\r\ntime vacant, but it would introduce a principle which cannot be too\r\nstrongly deprecated—that of class legislation. The council should\r\ncomprise the greatest attainable variety of knowledge and experience;\r\nbut its members should not consider themselves as severally the\r\nrepresentatives of a certain number of class interests.\r\n\r\nThe clause which continues to the Proprietors the power of electing some\r\nportion of the council is, so far, deserving of support; and the\r\nprinciple of enlarging the constituency by the addition of persons of a\r\ncertain length of Indian service and residence is, in itself,\r\nunexceptionable; but unless guarded by provisions, such as have never\r\nyet been introduced into any electoral system, so large and scattered a\r\nconstituency as that proposed would greatly add to the inconvenience of\r\ncanvass: especially as it is not certain that the new electoral body\r\nwould adopt, from the old, the salutary custom of re-electing, as the\r\ngeneral practice, whoever has been once chosen, and has not, by\r\nmisconduct or incapacity, deserved to forfeit their confidence. The\r\nduties of a member of council would be entirely incompatible with a\r\ncontinually-recurring canvass of the constituency.\r\n\r\nRespecting the proposition for giving the choice of five members of\r\ncouncil to the parliamentary constituencies of five great towns, the\r\nCourt of Directors can only express a feeling of amazement. It is not\r\nthe mere fact of election by a multitude that constitutes the benefits\r\nof the popular element in government. To produce those benefits, the\r\naffairs of which the people are enabled to control the management must\r\nbe their own affairs. Election by multitudinous bodies, the majority of\r\nthem of a very low average of education, is not an advantage of popular\r\ngovernment, but, on the contrary, one of its acknowledged drawbacks. To\r\nassign to such a constituency the control, not of their own affairs, but\r\nof the affairs of other people on the other side of the globe, is to\r\nincur the disadvantages of popular institutions without any of the\r\nbenefits. The Court of Directors willingly admit the desirableness, if\r\nnot necessity, of some provision for including an English element in the\r\nCouncil of India; but a more objectionable mode than the one proposed of\r\nattaining the object, could scarcely, in their opinion, be devised.\r\n\r\nBesides the provisions which relate to the organ of government in\r\nEngland, the bills contain provisions relating to India itself, which\r\nare open to the strongest objection.\r\n\r\nThe appointments to the councils at Calcutta and at the subordinate\r\npresidencies, which are now made by the Court of Directors, with the\r\napprobation of the Crown, are transferred by both bills to the\r\ngovernor-general, and to the governors of Madras and Bombay. The Court\r\nof Directors are convinced that this change would greatly impair the\r\nchances of good government in India. One of the causes which has most\r\ncontributed to the many excellences of Indian administration is, that\r\nthe governor-general and governors have always been associated with\r\ncouncillors selected by the authorities at home from among the most\r\nexperienced and able members of the Indian service, and who, not owing\r\ntheir appointments to the head of the government, have generally brought\r\nto the consideration of Indian affairs an independent judgment. In\r\nconsequence of this, the measures of a government, necessarily absolute,\r\nhave had the advantage, seldom possessed in absolute governments, of\r\nbeing always preceded by a free and conscientious discussion; while, as\r\nthe head of the government has the power, on recording his reasons, to\r\nact contrary to the advice of his council, no public inconvenience can\r\never arise from any conflict of opinion. These important officers, who,\r\nby their participation in the government, form so salutary a restraint\r\non the precipitancy of an inexperienced, or the wilfulness of a\r\ndespotically tempered, governor-general or governor, are henceforth to\r\nbe appointed by the great functionary whom they are intended to check.\r\nAnd this restraint is removed, when the necessity for an independent\r\ncouncil will be greater than ever; since the power of appointing the\r\ngovernor-general, and of recalling him, is taken away from the Company,\r\nand from the body which is to be their substitute. It may be added that\r\nthe authorities at home have had the opportunity of being acquainted\r\nwith the conduct and services of candidates for council from the\r\ncommencement of their career. The governor-general or governor would\r\noften have to nominate a councillor soon after their arrival in India,\r\nwhen necessarily ignorant of the character and merits of candidates, and\r\nwould be entirely dependent on the recommendation of irresponsible\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\nAnother most objectionable provision demands notice, which is to be\r\nfound only in the second bill. A commission, appointed in England, is to\r\nproceed to India, for the purpose of inquiring and reporting on the\r\nprinciples and details of Indian finance, including the whole revenue\r\nsystem, and, what is inseparably involved in it, the proprietary rights\r\nand social position of all the great classes of the community. The Court\r\nof Directors cannot believe that such a project will be persisted in. It\r\nwould be a step towards the disorganisation of the fabric of government\r\nin India. A commission from England, independent of the local government\r\nof the country, deriving its authority directly from the higher power to\r\nwhich the local government is subordinate, and instructed to carry back\r\nto the higher power information on Indian affairs which the local\r\ngovernment is not deemed sufficiently trustworthy to afford, would give\r\na most serious shock to the influence of the local authorities, and\r\nwould tend to impress all natives with the belief that the opinions and\r\ndecisions of the local government are of small moment, and that the\r\nthing of real importance is the success with which they can contrive\r\nthat their claims and objects shall be advocated in England. Up to the\r\npresent time, it has been the practice of the home government to uphold\r\nin every way the authority of the governments on the spot; even when\r\nreversing their acts, to do so through the governments themselves, and\r\nto employ no agency except in subordination to them.\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the chief provisions of the bills, which embody the\r\nattempts of two great divisions of English statesmen to frame an organ\r\nof government for India, it will probably appear to the proprietors,\r\nthat neither of them is grounded on any sufficient consideration of past\r\nexperience, or of the principles applicable to the subject; that the\r\npassing of either would be a calamity to India; and that the attempt to\r\nlegislate while the minds of leading men are in so unprepared a state,\r\nis altogether premature.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of your Directors is, that by all constitutional means the\r\npassing of either bill should be opposed; but that if one or the other\r\nshould be determined on for the purpose of transferring the\r\nadministration, in name, from the East India Company to the Crown, every\r\nexertion should be used in its passage through committee to divest it of\r\nthe mischievous features by which both bills are now deformed, and to\r\nmaintain, as at present, a really independent council, having the\r\ninitiative of all business, discharging all the duties, and possessing\r\nall the essential powers of the Court of Directors. And it is the\r\nCourt’s conviction, that measures might be so framed as to obviate\r\nwhatever may be well founded in the complaints made against the present\r\nsystem—retaining the initiative of the council, and that independence of\r\naction on their part which should be regarded as paramount and\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_E. I. Company’s Objections to the Third India Bill: June 1858._ (See p.\r\n                                 570.)\r\n\r\n1. Although the bill which has been newly brought in by her Majesty’s\r\nministers ‘for the better government of India,’ has not yet been\r\nformally communicated to the Court of Directors, the Court, influenced\r\nby the desire which they have already expressed to give all aid in their\r\npower towards rendering the scheme of government, which it is the\r\npleasure of parliament to substitute for the East India Company, as\r\nefficient for its purposes as possible, have requested us[205] to lay\r\nbefore your lordship,[206] and through you before her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment, a few observations on some portions of the bill.\r\n\r\n2. Having in documents which have been presented to parliament expressed\r\ntheir sentiments fully on all the general features of the subject, the\r\nCourt refrain from offering any further arguments on points upon which\r\nthe government and the House of Commons seem to have pronounced a\r\ndecided opinion. The joint government of a minister and a council,\r\ncomposed in majority of persons of Indian experience, deriving their\r\nappointments only partially from ministerial nomination, and all of them\r\nholding office on a tenure independent of the minister, is a combination\r\nwhich fulfils to a considerable extent the conditions of a good organ of\r\ngovernment for India. The Court would have much preferred that in the\r\nconstitution of the council more extensive recourse had been had to the\r\nelective principle. But if they cannot hope that this course will be\r\nadopted, they see many advantages in the provision by which one-half the\r\nnumber, instead of being named by the government, will be selected by a\r\nresponsible body, intimately connected with India, to whom the\r\nqualification of candidates will in general be accurately known, and who\r\nwill be under strong inducements to make such a choice as will tend to\r\nincrease the credit and consideration of the body.\r\n\r\n3. With regard to the qualifications prescribed for members of council,\r\nthe Court desire to offer a suggestion. Her Majesty’s present government\r\nhave, on many occasions, expressed a desire to secure the Crown\r\nappointments against the evils of abuse of patronage. The security\r\nagainst such abuse has hitherto consisted in the strict limitation of\r\nthe appointments to persons who have served a considerable number of\r\nyears in India. While the Court fully agree with her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment in recognising the desirableness of an English element, it\r\ndoes not seem to them advisable that this element should extend to\r\nnearly half the council, only a bare majority being reserved for persons\r\nof Indian experience. Knowledge of India is, after all, the most\r\nimportant requisite for a seat in the Indian Council; while it is\r\nchiefly in the English nominations that there is any present danger lest\r\nappointments should be obtained through political or parliamentary\r\ninfluence—from which influence, unless introduced through that channel,\r\nthe council, like the Court of Directors, may be expected to be\r\naltogether free. The Court, therefore, recommend that the qualification\r\nof ten years’ Indian service or residence be made imperative on at least\r\ntwo-thirds instead of a mere majority of the fifteen members of council.\r\nThey also think it questionable if the interests of India will be\r\npromoted by the exclusion of the whole of the members of the council\r\nfrom seats in parliament. These are the only modifications which we are\r\nrequested to suggest in the provisions respecting the composition of the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n[The remaining objections made by the Directors were little more than a\r\nrepetition of those made against the first and second bills (given _in\r\nextenso_ in a preceding page); and need not be reproduced here. The\r\nDirectors expressed a dislike or apprehension of the subordinate\r\nposition in which the Council would be placed; of the autocratic power\r\nto be possessed by the Secretary for India; of the transference of the\r\npowers of the Secret Committee wholly and solely to him; of the proposed\r\nmode of making appointments and exercising patronage; of any disturbance\r\nin the mode of auditing accounts; and of the appointment of any\r\nCommission of Inquiry in India which should appear derogatory to the\r\ndignity of the local governments. Many of these objections were listened\r\nto, and were productive of modifications during the discussion of the\r\nbill. The result will be seen in the next article of this Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abstract of Act for the Better Government of India—21 and 22 Vict. cap.\r\n       106.—Received Royal Assent August 2, 1858._ (See p. 573.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Transfer of Governing Powers._\r\n\r\nI.

In a report prepared by the\r\nCommittee, on the 1st of November 1858, it was announced that the sum\r\nplaced in their charge amounted, up to that time, to £434,729. They had\r\nremitted £127,287 to India, there to be distributed by auxiliary local\r\ncommittees; they had assisted sufferers after their return to, or during\r\ntheir residence in, the home country, to the extent of £35,757; and\r\ntheir management expenses had amounted to £6224. There remained,\r\ninvested at interest, the sum of £265,461, applicable to further cases\r\nof need.

We shall respect the rights, dignity, and honour of native\r\nprinces as our own; and we desire that they, as well as our own\r\nsubjects, should enjoy that prosperity and that social advancement which\r\ncan only be secured by internal peace and good government.\r\n\r\nWe hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the\r\nsame obligations of duty which bind us to all our other subjects; and\r\nthose obligations, by the blessing of Almighty God, we shall faithfully\r\nand conscientiously fulfil.\r\n\r\nFirmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging\r\nwith gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and\r\nthe desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare\r\nit to be our Royal will and pleasure that none be in anywise favoured,\r\nnone molested or disquieted, by reason of their religious faith or\r\nobservances, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial\r\nprotection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those\r\nwho may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference\r\nwith the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain of\r\nour highest displeasure.\r\n\r\nAnd it is our further will that, so far as may be, our subjects, of\r\nwhatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in\r\nour service, the duties of which they may be qualified, by their\r\neducation, ability, and integrity, duly to discharge.\r\n\r\nWe know and respect the feelings of attachment with which the natives of\r\nIndia regard the lands inherited by them from their ancestors, and we\r\ndesire to protect them in all rights connected therewith, subject to the\r\nequitable demands of the State; and we will that, generally, in framing\r\nand administering the law, due regard be paid to the ancient rights,\r\nusages, and customs of India.\r\n\r\nWe deeply lament the evils and misery which have been brought upon India\r\nby the acts of ambitious men, who have deceived their countrymen by\r\nfalse reports, and led them into open rebellion. Our power has been\r\nshewn by the suppression of that rebellion in the field; we desire to\r\nshew our mercy by pardoning the offences of those who have been thus\r\nmisled, but who desire to return to the path of duty.\r\n\r\nAlready in one province, with a view to stop the further effusion of\r\nblood, and to hasten the pacification of our Indian dominions, our\r\nViceroy and Governor-general has held out the expectation of pardon, on\r\ncertain terms, to the great majority of those who in the late unhappy\r\ndisturbances have been guilty of offences against our government; and\r\nhas declared the punishment which will be inflicted on those whose\r\ncrimes place them beyond the reach of forgiveness. We approve and\r\nconfirm the said act of our Viceroy and Governor-general, and do further\r\nannounce and proclaim as follows:\r\n\r\nOur clemency will be extended to all offenders, save and except those\r\nwho have been or shall be convicted of having directly taken part in the\r\nmurder of British subjects.\r\n\r\nWith regard to such, the demands of justice forbid the exercise of\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nTo those who have willingly given asylum to murderers, knowing them to\r\nbe such, or who may have acted as leaders or instigators in revolt,\r\ntheir lives alone can be guaranteed; but in appointing the penalty due\r\nto such persons, full consideration will be given to the circumstances\r\nunder which they have been induced to throw off their allegiance; and\r\nlarge indulgence will be shewn to those whose crimes may appear to have\r\noriginated in a too credulous acceptance of the false reports circulated\r\nby designing men.\r\n\r\nTo all others in arms against the government, we hereby promise\r\nunconditional pardon, amnesty, and oblivion of all offences against\r\nourselves, our crown and dignity, on their return to their homes and\r\npeaceful pursuits.\r\n\r\nIt is our Royal pleasure that these terms of grace and amnesty should be\r\nextended to all those who comply with their conditions before the first\r\nday of January next.\r\n\r\nWhen, by the blessing of Providence, internal tranquillity shall be\r\nrestored, it is our earnest desire to stimulate the peaceful industry of\r\nIndia, to promote works of public utility and improvement, and to\r\nadminister its government for the benefit of all our subjects resident\r\ntherein. In their prosperity will be our strength, in their contentment\r\nour security, and in their gratitude our best reward. And may the God of\r\nall power grant unto us, and to those in authority under us, strength to\r\ncarry out these our wishes for the good of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Viscount Canning’s Proclamation.—Issued at Allahabad, November 1,\r\n                          1858._ (See p. 612.)\r\n\r\nHer Majesty the Queen having declared that it is her gracious pleasure\r\nto take upon herself the government of the British territories in India,\r\nthe Viceroy and Governor-general hereby notifies that from this day all\r\nacts of the government of India will be done in the name of the Queen\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nFrom this day, all men of every race and class who, under the\r\nadministration of the Honourable East India Company, have joined to\r\nuphold the honour and power of England, will be the servants of the\r\nQueen alone.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-general summons them, one and all, each in his degree, and\r\naccording to his opportunity, and with his whole heart and strength, to\r\naid in fulfilling the gracious will and pleasure of the Queen, as set\r\nforth in her royal proclamation.\r\n\r\nFrom the many millions of her Majesty’s native subjects in India, the\r\nGovernor-general will now, and at all times, exact a loyal obedience to\r\nthe call which, in words full of benevolence and mercy, their Sovereign\r\nhas made upon their allegiance and faithfulness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  The chairman and deputy-chairman.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  Lord Stanley, president of the Board of Control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Events in India.\r\n\r\n                                  1857.\r\n\r\n Jan.      22.
