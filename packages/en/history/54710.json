It is a collection of articles reprinted from\r\n_McClure’s Magazine_. Done as journalism, they are journalism still, and\r\nno further pretensions are set up for them in their new dress. This\r\nclassification may seem pretentious enough; certainly it would if I\r\nshould confess what claims I make for my profession. But no matter about\r\nthat; I insist upon the journalism. And there is my justification for\r\nseparating from the bound volumes of the magazine and republishing,\r\npractically without re-editing, my accounts as a reporter of the shame\r\nof American cities. They were written with a purpose, they were\r\npublished serially with a purpose, and they are reprinted now together\r\nto further that same purpose, which was and is—to sound for the civic\r\npride of an apparently shameless citizenship.\r\n\r\nThere must be such a thing, we reasoned. All our big boasting could not\r\nbe empty vanity, nor our pious pretensions hollow sham. American\r\nachievements in science, art, and business mean sound abilities at\r\nbottom, and our hypocrisy a race sense of fundamental ethics. Even in\r\ngovernment we have given proofs of potential greatness, and our\r\npolitical failures are not complete; they are simply ridiculous. But\r\nthey are ours. Not alone the triumphs and the statesmen, the defeats and\r\nthe grafters also represent us, and just as truly. Why not see it so and\r\nsay it?\r\n\r\nBecause, I heard, the American people won’t “stand for” it. You may\r\nblame the politicians, or, indeed, any one class, but not all classes,\r\nnot the people. Or you may put it on the ignorant foreign immigrant, or\r\nany one nationality, but not on all nationalities, not on the American\r\npeople. But no one class is at fault, nor any one breed, nor any\r\nparticular interest or group of interests. The misgovernment of the\r\nAmerican people is misgovernment by the American people.\r\n\r\nWhen I set out on my travels, an honest New Yorker told me honestly that\r\nI would find that the Irish, the Catholic Irish, were at the bottom of\r\nit all everywhere. The first city I went to was St. Louis, a German\r\ncity. The next was Minneapolis, a Scandinavian city, with a leadership\r\nof New Englanders. Then came Pittsburg, Scotch Presbyterian, and that\r\nwas what my New York friend was. “Ah, but they are all foreign\r\npopulations,” I heard. The next city was Philadelphia, the purest\r\nAmerican community of all, and the most hopeless. And after that came\r\nChicago and New York, both mongrel-bred, but the one a triumph of\r\nreform, the other the best example of good government that I had seen.\r\nThe “foreign element” excuse is one of the hypocritical lies that save\r\nus from the clear sight of ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnother such conceit of our egotism is that which deplores our politics\r\nand lauds our business. This is the wail of the typical American\r\ncitizen. Now, the typical American citizen is the business man. The\r\ntypical business man is a bad citizen; he is busy. If he is a “big\r\nbusiness man” and very busy, he does not neglect, he is busy with\r\npolitics, oh, very busy and very businesslike. I found him buying\r\nboodlers in St. Louis, defending grafters in Minneapolis, originating\r\ncorruption in Pittsburg, sharing with bosses in Philadelphia, deploring\r\nreform in Chicago, and beating good government with corruption funds in\r\nNew York. He is a self-righteous fraud, this business man. He is the\r\nchief source of corruption, and it were a boon if he would neglect\r\npolitics. But he is not the business man that neglects politics; that\r\nworthy is the good citizen, the typical business man. He too is busy, he\r\nis the one that has no use and therefore no time for politics. When his\r\nneglect has permitted bad government to go so far that he can be stirred\r\nto action, he is unhappy, and he looks around for a cure that shall be\r\nquick, so that he may hurry back to the shop. Naturally, too, when he\r\ntalks politics, he talks shop. His patent remedy is quack; it is\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“Give us a business man,” he says (“like me,” he means). “Let him\r\nintroduce business methods into politics and government; then I shall be\r\nleft alone to attend to my business.”\r\n\r\nThere is hardly an office from United States Senator down to Alderman in\r\nany part of the country to which the business man has not been elected;\r\nyet politics remains corrupt, government pretty bad, and the selfish\r\ncitizen has to hold himself in readiness like the old volunteer firemen\r\nto rush forth at any hour, in any weather, to prevent the fire; and he\r\ngoes out sometimes and he puts out the fire (after the damage is done)\r\nand he goes back to the shop sighing for the business man in politics.\r\nThe business man has failed in politics as he has in citizenship. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause politics is business. That’s what’s the matter with it. That’s\r\nwhat’s the matter with everything,—art, literature, religion,\r\njournalism, law, medicine,—they’re all business, and all—as you see\r\nthem. Make politics a sport, as they do in England, or a profession, as\r\nthey do in Germany, and we’ll have—well, something else than we have\r\nnow,—if we want it, which is another question. But don’t try to reform\r\npolitics with the banker, the lawyer, and the dry-goods merchant, for\r\nthese are business men and there are two great hindrances to their\r\nachievement of reform: one is that they are different from, but no\r\nbetter than, the politicians; the other is that politics is not “their\r\nline.” There are exceptions both ways. Many politicians have gone out\r\ninto business and done well (Tammany ex-mayors, and nearly all the old\r\nbosses of Philadelphia are prominent financiers in their cities), and\r\nbusiness men have gone into politics and done well (Mark Hanna, for\r\nexample). They haven’t reformed their adopted trades, however, though\r\nthey have sometimes sharpened them most pointedly. The politician is a\r\nbusiness man with a specialty. When a business man of some other line\r\nlearns the business of politics, he is a politician, and there is not\r\nmuch reform left in him. Consider the United States Senate, and believe\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe commercial spirit is the spirit of profit, not patriotism; of\r\ncredit, not honor; of individual gain, not national prosperity; of trade\r\nand dickering, not principle. “My business is sacred,” says the business\r\nman in his heart. “Whatever prospers my business, is good; it must be.\r\nWhatever hinders it, is wrong; it must be. A bribe is bad, that is, it\r\nis a bad thing to take; but it is not so bad to give one, not if it is\r\nnecessary to my business.” “Business is business” is not a political\r\nsentiment, but our politician has caught it. He takes essentially the\r\nsame view of the bribe, only he saves his self-respect by piling all his\r\ncontempt upon the bribe-giver, and he has the great advantage of candor.\r\n“It is wrong, maybe,” he says, “but if a rich merchant can afford to do\r\nbusiness with me for the sake of a convenience or to increase his\r\nalready great wealth, I can afford, for the sake of a living, to meet\r\nhim half way. I make no pretensions to virtue, not even on Sunday.” And\r\nas for giving bad government or good, how about the merchant who gives\r\nbad goods or good goods, according to the demand?\r\n\r\nBut there is hope, not alone despair, in the commercialism of our\r\npolitics. If our political leaders are to be always a lot of political\r\nmerchants, they will supply any demand we may create. All we have to do\r\nis to establish a steady demand for good government. The boss has us\r\nsplit up into parties. To him parties are nothing but means to his\r\ncorrupt ends. He “bolts” his party, but we must not; the bribe-giver\r\nchanges his party, from one election to another, from one county to\r\nanother, from one city to another, but the honest voter must not. Why?\r\nBecause if the honest voter cared no more for his party than the\r\npolitician and the grafter, then the honest vote would govern, and that\r\nwould be bad—for graft. It is idiotic, this devotion to a machine that\r\nis used to take our sovereignty from us. If we would leave parties to\r\nthe politicians, and would vote not for the party, not even for men, but\r\nfor the city, and the State, and the nation, we should rule parties, and\r\ncities, and States, and nation. If we would vote in mass on the more\r\npromising ticket, or, if the two are equally bad, would throw out the\r\nparty that is in, and wait till the next election and then throw out the\r\nother party that is in—then, I say, the commercial politician would feel\r\na demand for good government and he would supply it. That process would\r\ntake a generation or more to complete, for the politicians now really do\r\nnot know what good government is. But it has taken as long to develop\r\nbad government, and the politicians know what that is. If it would not\r\n“go,” they would offer something else, and, if the demand were steady,\r\nthey, being so commercial, would “deliver the goods.”\r\n\r\nBut do the people want good government? Tammany says they don’t. Are the\r\npeople honest? Are the people better than Tammany? Are they better than\r\nthe merchant and the politician? Isn’t our corrupt government, after\r\nall, representative?\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt has been sneered at for going about the country\r\npreaching, as a cure for our American evils, good conduct in the\r\nindividual, simple honesty, courage, and efficiency. “Platitudes!” the\r\nsophisticated say. Platitudes? If my observations have been true, the\r\nliteral adoption of Mr. Roosevelt’s reform scheme would result in a\r\nrevolution, more radical and terrible to existing institutions, from the\r\nCongress to the Church, from the bank to the ward organization, than\r\nsocialism or even than anarchy. Why, that would change all of us—not\r\nalone our neighbors, not alone the grafters, but you and me.\r\n\r\nNo, the contemned methods of our despised politics are the master\r\nmethods of our braggart business, and the corruption that shocks us in\r\npublic affairs we practice ourselves in our private concerns. There is\r\nno essential difference between the pull that gets your wife into\r\nsociety or a favorable review for your book, and that which gets a\r\nheeler into office, a thief out of jail, and a rich man’s son on the\r\nboard of directors of a corporation; none between the corruption of a\r\nlabor union, a bank, and a political machine; none between a dummy\r\ndirector of a trust and the caucus-bound member of a legislature; none\r\nbetween a labor boss like Sam Parks, a boss of banks like John D.\r\nRockefeller, a boss of railroads like J. P. Morgan, and a political boss\r\nlike Matthew S. Quay. The boss is not a political, he is an American\r\ninstitution, product of a freed people that have not the spirit to be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s all a moral weakness; a weakness right where we think we are\r\nstrongest. Oh, we are good—on Sunday, and we are “fearfully patriotic”\r\non the Fourth of July. But the bribe we pay to the janitor to prefer our\r\ninterests to the landlord’s, is the little brother of the bribe passed\r\nto the alderman to sell a city street, and the father of the air-brake\r\nstock assigned to the president of a railroad to have this life-saving\r\ninvention adopted on his road. And as for graft, railroad passes, saloon\r\nand bawdy-house blackmail, and watered stock, all these belong to the\r\nsame family. We are pathetically proud of our democratic institutions\r\nand our republican form of government, of our grand Constitution and our\r\njust laws. We are a free and sovereign people, we govern ourselves and\r\nthe government is ours. But that is the point. We are responsible, not\r\nour leaders, since we follow them. We _let_ them divert our loyalty from\r\nthe United States to some “party”; we _let_ them boss the party and turn\r\nour municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation\r\ninto a plutocracy. We cheat our government and we let our leaders loot\r\nit, and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us. True,\r\nthey pass for us strict laws, but we are content to let them pass also\r\nbad laws, giving away public property in exchange; and our good, and\r\noften impossible, laws we allow to be used for oppression and blackmail.\r\nAnd what can we say? We break our own laws and rob our own government,\r\nthe lady at the custom-house, the lyncher with his rope, and the captain\r\nof industry with his bribe and his rebate. The spirit of graft and of\r\nlawlessness is the American spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd this shall not be said? Not plainly? William Travers Jerome, the\r\nfearless District Attorney of New York, says, “You can say anything you\r\nthink to the American people. If you are honest with yourself you may be\r\nhonest with them, and they will forgive not only your candor, but your\r\nmistakes.” This is the opinion, and the experience too, of an honest man\r\nand a hopeful democrat. Who says the other things? Who says “Hush,” and\r\n“What’s the use?” and “ALL’S well,” when all is rotten? It is the\r\ngrafter; the coward, too, but the grafter inspires the coward. The\r\ndoctrine of “addition, division, and silence” is the doctrine of graft.\r\n“Don’t hurt the party,” “Spare the fair fame of the city,” are boodle\r\nyells. The Fourth of July oration is the “front” of graft. There is no\r\npatriotism in it, but treason. It is part of the game. The grafters call\r\nfor cheers for the flag, “prosperity,” and “the party,” just as a\r\nhighwayman commands “hands up,” and while we are waving and shouting,\r\nthey float the flag from the nation to the party, turn both into graft\r\nfactories, and prosperity into a speculative boom to make “weak hands,”\r\nas the Wall Street phrase has it, hold the watered stock while the\r\nstrong hands keep the property. “Blame us, blame anybody, but praise the\r\npeople,” this, the politician’s advice, is not the counsel of respect\r\nfor the people, but of contempt. By just such palavering as courtiers\r\nplay upon the degenerate intellects of weak kings, the bosses,\r\npolitical, financial, and industrial, are befuddling and befooling our\r\nsovereign American citizenship; and—likewise—they are corrupting it.\r\n\r\nAnd it is corruptible, this citizenship. “I know what Parks is doing,”\r\nsaid a New York union workman, “but what do I care. He has raised my\r\nwages. Let him have his graft!” And the Philadelphia merchant says the\r\nsame thing: “The party leaders may be getting more than they should out\r\nof the city, but that doesn’t hurt me. It may raise taxes a little, but\r\nI can stand that. The party keeps up the protective tariff. If that were\r\ncut down, my business would be ruined. So long as the party stands pat\r\non that, I stand pat on the party.”\r\n\r\nThe people are not innocent. That is the only “news” in all the\r\njournalism of these articles, and no doubt that was not new to many\r\nobservers. It was to me. When I set out to describe the corrupt systems\r\nof certain typical cities, I meant to show simply how the people were\r\ndeceived and betrayed. But in the very first study—St. Louis—the\r\nstartling truth lay bare that corruption was not merely political; it\r\nwas financial, commercial, social; the ramifications of boodle were so\r\ncomplex, various, and far-reaching, that one mind could hardly grasp\r\nthem, and not even Joseph W. Folk, the tireless prosecutor, could follow\r\nthem all. This state of things was indicated in the first article which\r\nClaude H. Wetmore and I compiled together, but it was not shown plainly\r\nenough. Mr. Wetmore lived in St. Louis, and he had respect for names\r\nwhich meant little to me. But when I went next to Minneapolis alone, I\r\ncould see more independently, without respect for persons, and there\r\nwere traces of the same phenomenon. The first St. Louis article was\r\ncalled “Tweed Days in St. Louis,” and though the “better citizen”\r\nreceived attention the Tweeds were the center of interest. In “The Shame\r\nof Minneapolis,” the truth was put into the title; it was the Shame of\r\nMinneapolis; not of the Ames administration, not of the Tweeds, but of\r\nthe city and its citizens. And yet Minneapolis was not nearly so bad as\r\nSt. Louis; police graft is never so universal as boodle. It is more\r\nshocking, but it is so filthy that it cannot involve so large a part of\r\nsociety. So I returned to St. Louis, and I went over the whole ground\r\nagain, with the people in mind, not alone the caught and convicted\r\nboodlers. And this time the true meaning of “Tweed days in St. Louis”\r\nwas made plain. The article was called “The Shamelessness of St. Louis,”\r\nand that was the burden of the story. In Pittsburg also the people was\r\nthe subject, and though the civic spirit there was better, the extent of\r\nthe corruption throughout the social organization of the community was\r\nindicated. But it was not till I got to Philadelphia that the\r\npossibilities of popular corruption were worked out to the limit of\r\nhumiliating confession. That was the place for such a study. There is\r\nnothing like it in the country, except possibly, in Cincinnati.\r\nPhiladelphia certainly is not merely corrupt, but corrupted, and this\r\nwas made clear. Philadelphia was charged up to—the American citizen.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible in the space of a magazine article to cover in any one\r\ncity all the phases of municipal government, so I chose cities that\r\ntypified most strikingly some particular phase or phases. Thus as St.\r\nLouis exemplified boodle; Minneapolis, police graft; Pittsburg, a\r\npolitical and industrial machine; and Philadelphia, general civic\r\ncorruption; so Chicago was an illustration of reform, and New York of\r\ngood government. All these things occur in most of these places. There\r\nare, and long have been, reformers in St. Louis, and there is to-day\r\npolice graft there. Minneapolis has had boodling and council reform, and\r\nboodling is breaking out there again. Pittsburg has general corruption,\r\nand Philadelphia a very perfect political machine. Chicago has police\r\ngraft and a low order of administrative and general corruption which\r\npermeates business, labor, and society generally. As for New York, the\r\nmetropolis might exemplify almost anything that occurs anywhere in\r\nAmerican cities, but no city has had for many years such a good\r\nadministration as was that of Mayor Seth Low.\r\n\r\nThat which I have made each city stand for, is that which it had most\r\nhighly developed. It would be absurd to seek for organized reform in St.\r\nLouis, for example, with Chicago next door; or for graft in Chicago with\r\nMinneapolis so near. After Minneapolis, a description of administrative\r\ncorruption in Chicago would have seemed like a repetition. Perhaps it\r\nwas not just to treat only the conspicuous element in each situation.\r\nBut why should I be just? I was not judging; I arrogated to myself no\r\nsuch function. I was not writing about Chicago for Chicago, but for the\r\nother cities, so I picked out what light each had for the instruction of\r\nthe others. But, if I was never complete, I never exaggerated. Every one\r\nof those articles was an understatement, especially where the conditions\r\nwere bad, and the proof thereof is that while each article seemed to\r\nastonish other cities, it disappointed the city which was its subject.\r\nThus my friends in Philadelphia, who knew what there was to know, and\r\nthose especially who knew what I knew, expressed surprise that I\r\nreported so little. And one St. Louis newspaper said that “the facts\r\nwere thrown at me and I fell down over them.” There was truth in these\r\nflings. I cut twenty thousand words out of the Philadelphia article and\r\nyet I had not written half my facts. I know a man who is making a\r\nhistory of the corrupt construction of the Philadelphia City Hall, in\r\nthree volumes, and he grieves because he lacks space. You can’t put all\r\nthe known incidents of the corruption of an American city into a book.\r\n\r\nThis is all very unscientific, but then, I am not a scientist. I am a\r\njournalist. I did not gather with indifference all the facts and arrange\r\nthem patiently for permanent preservation and laboratory analysis. I did\r\nnot want to preserve, I wanted to destroy the facts. My purpose was no\r\nmore scientific than the spirit of my investigation and reports; it was,\r\nas I said above, to see if the shameful facts, spread out in all their\r\nshame, would not burn through our civic shamelessness and set fire to\r\nAmerican pride. That was the journalism of it. I wanted to move and to\r\nconvince. That is why I was not interested in all the facts, sought none\r\nthat was new, and rejected half those that were old. I often was asked\r\nto expose something suspected. I couldn’t; and why should I? Exposure of\r\nthe unknown was not my purpose. The people: what they will put up with,\r\nhow they are fooled, how cheaply they are bought, how dearly sold, how\r\neasily intimidated, and how led, for good or for evil—that was the\r\ninquiry, and so the significant facts were those only which everybody in\r\neach city knew, and of these, only those which everybody in every other\r\ntown would recognize, from their common knowledge of such things, to be\r\nprobable. But these, understated, were charged always to the guilty\r\npersons when individuals were to blame, and finally brought home to the\r\npeople themselves, who, having the power, have also the responsibility,\r\nthey and those they respect, and those that guide them.\r\n\r\nThis was against all the warnings and rules of demagogy. What was the\r\nresult?\r\n\r\nAfter Joseph W. Folk had explored and exposed, with convictions, the\r\nboodling of St. Louis, the rings carried an election. “Tweed Days in St.\r\nLouis” is said to have formed some public sentiment against the\r\nboodlers, but the local newspapers had more to do with that than\r\n_McClure’s Magazine_. After the Minneapolis grand jury had exposed and\r\nthe courts had tried and the common juries had convicted the grafters\r\nthere, an election showed that public opinion was formed. But that one\r\nelection was regarded as final. When I went there the men who had led\r\nthe reform movement were “all through.” After they had read the “Shame\r\nof Minneapolis,” however, they went back to work, and they have\r\nperfected a plan to keep the citizens informed and to continue the fight\r\nfor good government. They saw, these unambitious, busy citizens, that it\r\nwas “up to them,” and they resumed the unwelcome duties of their\r\ncitizenship. Of resentment there was very little. At a meeting of\r\nleading citizens there were honest speeches suggesting that something\r\nshould be said to “clear the name of Minneapolis,” but one man rose and\r\nsaid very pleasantly, but firmly, that the article was true; it was\r\npretty hard on them, but it was true and they all knew it. That ended\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to St. Louis and rewrote the facts, and, in rewriting,\r\nmade them just as insulting as the truth would permit, my friends there\r\nexpressed dismay over the manuscript. The article would hurt Mr. Folk;\r\nit would hurt the cause; it would arouse popular wrath.\r\n\r\n“That was what I hoped it would do,” I said.\r\n\r\n“But the indignation would break upon Folk and reform, not on the\r\nboodlers,” they said.\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t it obvious,” I asked, “that this very title, ‘Shamelessness,’\r\nwas aimed at pride; that it implied a faith that there was self-respect\r\nto be touched and shame to be moved?”\r\n\r\nThat was too subtle. So I answered that if they had no faith in the\r\ntown, I had, and anyway, if I was wrong and the people should resent,\r\nnot the crime, but the exposure of it, then they would punish, not Mr.\r\nFolk, who had nothing to do with the article, but the magazine and me.\r\nNewspaper men warned me that they would not “stand for” the article, but\r\nwould attack it. I answered that I would let the St. Louisans decide\r\nbetween us. It was true, it was just; the people of St. Louis had shown\r\nno shame. Here was a good chance to see whether they had any. I was a\r\nfool, they said. “All right,” I replied. “All kings had fools in the\r\nolden days, and the fools were allowed to tell them the truth. I would\r\nplay the fool to the American people.”\r\n\r\nThe article, published, was attacked by the newspapers; friends of Mr.\r\nFolk repudiated it; Mr. Folk himself spoke up for the people. Leading\r\ncitizens raised money for a mass meeting to “set the city right before\r\nthe world.” The mayor of the city, a most excellent man, who had helped\r\nme, denounced the article. The boodle party platform appealed for votes\r\non the strength of the attacks in “Eastern magazines.” The people\r\nthemselves contradicted me; after the publication, two hundred thousand\r\nbuttons for “Folk and Reform” were worn on the streets of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nBut those buttons were for “Folk and Reform.” They did go to prove that\r\nthe article was wrong, that there was pride in St. Louis, but they\r\nproved also that that pride had been touched. Up to that time nobody\r\nknew exactly how St. Louis felt about it all. There had been one\r\nelection, another was pending, and the boodlers, caught or to be caught,\r\nwere in control. The citizens had made no move to dislodge them. Mr.\r\nFolk’s splendid labors were a spectacle without a chorus, and, though I\r\nhad met men who told me the people were with Folk, I had met also the\r\ngrafters, who cursed only Folk and were building all their hopes on the\r\nassumption that “after Folk’s term” all would be well again. Between\r\nthese two local views no outsider could choose. How could I read a\r\nstrange people’s hearts? I took the outside view, stated the facts both\r\nways,—the right verdicts of the juries and the confident plans of the\r\nboodlers,—and the result was, indeed, a shameless state of affairs for\r\nwhich St. Louis, the people of St. Louis, were to blame.\r\n\r\nAnd they saw it so, both in the city and in the State, and they ceased\r\nto be spectators. That article simply got down to the self-respect of\r\nthis people. And who was hurt? Not St. Louis. From that moment the city\r\nhas been determined and active, and boodle seems to be doomed. Not Mr.\r\nFolk. After that, his nomination for Governor of the State was declared\r\nfor by the people, who formed Folk clubs all over the State to force him\r\nupon his party and theirs, and thus insure the pursuit of the boodlers\r\nin St. Louis and in Missouri too. Nor was the magazine hurt, or myself.\r\nThe next time I went to St. Louis, the very men who had raised money for\r\nthe mass meeting to denounce the article went out of their way to say to\r\nme that I had been right, the article was true, and they asked me to “do\r\nit again.” And there may be a chance to do it again. Mr. Folk lifted the\r\nlid off Missouri for a moment after that, and the State also appeared\r\nripe for the gathering. Moreover, the boodlers of State and city have\r\njoined to beat the people and keep them down. The decisive election is\r\nnot till the fall of 1904, and the boodlers count much on the fickleness\r\nof public opinion. But I believe that Missouri and St. Louis together\r\nwill prove then, once for all, that the people can rule—when they are\r\naroused.\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburg article had no effect in Pittsburg, nor had that on\r\nPhiladelphia any results in Philadelphia. Nor was any expected there.\r\nPittsburg, as I said in the article, knew itself, and may pull out of\r\nits disgrace, but Philadelphia is contented and seems hopeless. The\r\naccounts of them, however, and indeed, as I have said, all in the\r\nseries, were written, not for the cities described, but for all our\r\ncities; and the most immediate responses came not from places described,\r\nbut from others where similar evils existed or similar action was\r\nneeded. Thus Chicago, intent on its troubles; found useless to it the\r\nstudy of its reform, which seems to have been suggestive elsewhere, and\r\nPhiladelphia, “Corrupt and Contented,” was taken home in other cities\r\nand seems to have made the most lasting impression everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut of course the tangible results are few. The real triumph of the\r\nyear’s work was the complete demonstration it has given, in a thousand\r\nlittle ways, that our shamelessness is superficial, that beneath it lies\r\na pride which, being real, may save us yet. And it is real. The grafters\r\nwho said you may put the blame anywhere but on the people, where it\r\nbelongs, and that Americans can be moved only by flattery,—they lied.\r\nThey lied about themselves. They, too, are American citizens; they too,\r\nare of the people; and some of them also were reached by shame. The\r\ngreat truth I tried to make plain was that which Mr. Folk insists so\r\nconstantly upon: that bribery is no ordinary felony, but treason, that\r\nthe “corruption which breaks out here and there and now and then” is not\r\nan occasional offense, but a common practice, and that the effect of it\r\nis literally to change the form of our government from one that is\r\nrepresentative of the people to an oligarchy, representative of special\r\ninterests. Some politicians have seen that this is so, and it bothers\r\nthem. I think I prize more highly than any other of my experiences the\r\nhalf-dozen times when grafting politicians I had “roasted,” as they put\r\nit, called on me afterwards to say, in the words of one who spoke with a\r\nwonderful solemnity:\r\n\r\n“You are right. I never thought of it that way, but it’s right. I don’t\r\nknow whether you can do anything, but you’re right, dead right. And I’m\r\nall wrong. We’re all, all wrong. I don’t see how we can stop it now; I\r\ndon’t see how I can change. I can’t, I guess. No, I can’t, not now. But,\r\nsay, I may be able to help you, and I will if I can. You can have\r\nanything I’ve got.”\r\n\r\nSo you see, they are not such bad fellows, these practical politicians.\r\nI wish I could tell more about them: how they have helped me; how\r\ncandidly and unselfishly they have assisted me to facts and an\r\nunderstanding of the facts, which, as I warned them, as they knew well,\r\nwere to be used against them. If I could—and I will some day—I should\r\nshow that one of the surest hopes we have is the politician himself. Ask\r\nhim for good politics; punish him when he gives bad, and reward him when\r\nhe gives good; make politics pay. Now, he says, you don’t know and you\r\ndon’t care, and that you must be flattered and fooled—and there, I say,\r\nhe is wrong. I did not flatter anybody; I told the truth as near as I\r\ncould get it, and instead of resentment there was encouragement. After\r\n“The Shame of Minneapolis,” and “The Shamelessness of St. Louis,” not\r\nonly did citizens of these cities approve, but citizens of other cities,\r\nindividuals, groups, and organizations, sent in invitations, hundreds of\r\nthem, “to come and show us up; we’re worse than they are.”\r\n\r\nWe Americans may have failed. We may be mercenary and selfish. Democracy\r\nwith us may be impossible and corruption inevitable, but these articles,\r\nif they have proved nothing else, have demonstrated beyond doubt that we\r\ncan stand the truth; that there is pride in the character of American\r\ncitizenship; and that this pride may be a power in the land. So this\r\nlittle volume, a record of shame and yet of self-respect, a disgraceful\r\nconfession, yet a declaration of honor, is dedicated, in all good faith,\r\nto the accused—to all the citizens of all the cities in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, _December, 1903_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TWEED DAYS IN ST. LOUIS\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_October, 1902_)\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, the fourth city in size in the United States, is making two\r\nannouncements to the world: one that it is the worst-governed city in\r\nthe land; the other that it wishes all men to come there (for the\r\nWorld’s Fair) and see it. It isn’t our worst-governed city; Philadelphia\r\nis that. But St. Louis is worth examining while we have it inside out.\r\n\r\nThere is a man at work there, one man, working all alone, but he is the\r\nCircuit (district or State) Attorney, and he is “doing his duty.” That\r\nis what thousands of district attorneys and other public officials have\r\npromised to do and boasted of doing. This man has a literal sort of\r\nmind. He is a thin-lipped, firm-mouthed, dark little man, who never\r\nraises his voice, but goes ahead doing, with a smiling eye and a set\r\njaw, the simple thing he said he would do. The politicians and reputable\r\ncitizens who asked him to run urged him when he declined. When he said\r\nthat if elected he would have to do his duty, they said, “Of course.” So\r\nhe ran, they supported him, and he was elected. Now some of these\r\npoliticians are sentenced to the penitentiary, some are in Mexico. The\r\nCircuit Attorney, finding that his “duty” was to catch and convict\r\ncriminals, and that the biggest criminals were some of these same\r\npoliticians and leading citizens, went after them. It is magnificent,\r\nbut the politicians declare it isn’t politics.\r\n\r\nThe corruption of St. Louis came from the top. The best citizens—the\r\nmerchants and big financiers—used to rule the town, and they ruled it\r\nwell. They set out to outstrip Chicago. The commercial and industrial\r\nwar between these two cities was at one time a picturesque and dramatic\r\nspectacle such as is witnessed only in our country. Business men were\r\nnot mere merchants and the politicians were not mere grafters; the two\r\nkinds of citizens got together and wielded the power of banks,\r\nrailroads, factories, the prestige of the city, and the spirit of its\r\ncitizens to gain business and population. And it was a close race.\r\nChicago, having the start, always led, but St. Louis had pluck,\r\nintelligence, and tremendous energy. It pressed Chicago hard. It\r\nexcelled in a sense of civic beauty and good government; and there are\r\nthose who think yet it might have won. But a change occurred. Public\r\nspirit became private spirit, public enterprise became private greed.\r\n\r\nAlong about 1890, public franchises and privileges were sought, not only\r\nfor legitimate profit and common convenience, but for loot. Taking but\r\nslight and always selfish interest in the public councils, the big men\r\nmisused politics. The riffraff, catching the smell of corruption, rushed\r\ninto the Municipal Assembly, drove out the remaining respectable men,\r\nand sold the city—its streets, its wharves, its markets, and all that it\r\nhad—to the now greedy business men and bribers. In other words, when the\r\nleading men began to devour their own city, the herd rushed into the\r\ntrough and fed also.\r\n\r\nSo gradually has this occurred that these same citizens hardly realize\r\nit. Go to St. Louis and you will find the habit of civic pride in them;\r\nthey still boast. The visitor is told of the wealth of the residents, of\r\nthe financial strength of the banks, and of the growing importance of\r\nthe industries, yet he sees poorly paved, refuse-burdened streets, and\r\ndusty or mud-covered alleys; he passes a ramshackle fire-trap crowded\r\nwith the sick, and learns that it is the City Hospital; he enters the\r\n“Four Courts,” and his nostrils are greeted by the odor of formaldehyde\r\nused as a disinfectant, and insect powder spread to destroy vermin; he\r\ncalls at the new City Hall, and finds half the entrance boarded with\r\npine planks to cover up the unfinished interior. Finally, he turns a tap\r\nin the hotel, to see liquid mud flow into wash-basin or bath-tub.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis charter vests legislative power of great scope in a\r\nMunicipal Assembly, which is composed of a council and a House of\r\nDelegates. Here is a description of the latter by one of Mr. Folk’s\r\ngrand juries:\r\n\r\n“We have had before us many of those who have been, and most of those\r\nwho are now, members of the House of Delegates. We found a number of\r\nthese utterly illiterate and lacking in ordinary intelligence, unable to\r\ngive a better reason for favoring or opposing a measure than a desire to\r\nact with the majority. In some, no trace of mentality or morality could\r\nbe found; in others, a low order of training appeared, united with base\r\ncunning, groveling instincts, and sordid desires. Unqualified to respond\r\nto the ordinary requirements of life, they are utterly incapable of\r\ncomprehending the significance of an ordinance, and are incapacitated,\r\nboth by nature and training, to be the makers of laws. The choosing of\r\nsuch men to be legislators makes a travesty of justice, sets a premium\r\non incompetency, and deliberately poisons the very source of the law.”\r\n\r\nThese creatures were well organized. They had a “combine”—legislative\r\ninstitution—which the grand jury described as follows:\r\n\r\n“Our investigation, covering more or less fully a period of ten years,\r\nshows that, with few exceptions, no ordinance has been passed wherein\r\nvaluable privileges or franchises are granted until those interested\r\nhave paid the legislators the money demanded for action in the\r\nparticular case. Combines in both branches of the Municipal Assembly are\r\nformed by members sufficient in number to control legislation. To one\r\nmember of this combine is delegated the authority to act for the\r\ncombine, and to receive and to distribute to each member the money\r\nagreed upon as the price of his vote in support of, or opposition to, a\r\npending measure. So long has this practice existed that such members\r\nhave come to regard the receipt of money for action on pending measures\r\nas a legitimate perquisite of a legislator.”\r\n\r\nOne legislator consulted a lawyer with the intention of suing a firm to\r\nrecover an unpaid balance on a fee for the grant of a switch-way. Such\r\ndifficulties rarely occurred, however. In order to insure a regular and\r\nindisputable revenue, the combine of each house drew up a schedule of\r\nbribery prices for all possible sorts of grants, just such a list as a\r\ncommercial traveler takes out on the road with him. There was a price\r\nfor a grain elevator, a price for a short switch; side tracks were\r\ncharged for by the linear foot, but at rates which varied according to\r\nthe nature of the ground taken; a street improvement cost so much; wharf\r\nspace was classified and precisely rated. As there was a scale for\r\nfavorable legislation, so there was one for defeating bills. It made a\r\ndifference in the price if there was opposition, and it made a\r\ndifference whether the privilege asked was legitimate or not. But\r\nnothing was passed free of charge. Many of the legislators were\r\nsaloon-keepers—it was in St. Louis that a practical joker nearly emptied\r\nthe House of Delegates by tipping a boy to rush into a session and call\r\nout, “Mister, your saloon is on fire,”—but even the saloon-keepers of a\r\nneighborhood had to pay to keep in their inconvenient locality a market\r\nwhich public interest would have moved.\r\n\r\nFrom the Assembly, bribery spread into other departments. Men empowered\r\nto issue peddlers’ licenses and permits to citizens who wished to erect\r\nawnings or use a portion of the sidewalk for storage purposes charged an\r\namount in excess of the prices stipulated by law, and pocketed the\r\ndifference. The city’s money was loaned at interest, and the interest\r\nwas converted into private bank accounts. City carriages were used by\r\nthe wives and children of city officials. Supplies for public\r\ninstitutions found their way to private tables; one itemized account of\r\nfood furnished the poorhouse included California jellies, imported\r\ncheeses, and French wines! A member of the Assembly caused the\r\nincorporation of a grocery company, with his sons and daughters the\r\nostensible stockholders, and succeeded in having his bid for city\r\nsupplies accepted although the figures were in excess of his\r\ncompetitors’. In return for the favor thus shown, he indorsed a measure\r\nto award the contract for city printing to another member, and these two\r\nvoted aye on a bill granting to a third the exclusive right to furnish\r\ncity dispensaries with drugs.\r\n\r\nMen ran into debt to the extent of thousands of dollars for the sake of\r\nelection to either branch of the Assembly. One night, on a street car\r\ngoing to the City Hall, a new member remarked that the nickel he handed\r\nthe conductor was his last. The next day he deposited $5,000 in a\r\nsavings bank. A member of the House of Delegates admitted to the Grand\r\nJury that his dividends from the combine netted $25,000 in one year; a\r\nCouncilman stated that he was paid $50,000 for his vote on a single\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nBribery was a joke. A newspaper reporter overheard this conversation one\r\nevening in the corridor of the City Hall:\r\n\r\n“Ah there, my boodler!” said Mr. Delegate.\r\n\r\n“Stay there, my grafter!” replied Mr. Councilman. “Can you lend me a\r\nhundred for a day or two?”\r\n\r\n“Not at present. But I can spare it if the Z—— bill goes through\r\nto-night. Meet me at F——‘s later.”\r\n\r\n“All right, my jailbird; I’ll be there.”\r\n\r\nThe blackest years were 1898, 1899, and 1900. Foreign corporations came\r\ninto the city to share in its despoliation, and home industries were\r\ndriven out by blackmail. Franchises worth millions were granted without\r\none cent of cash to the city, and with provision for only the smallest\r\nfuture payment; several companies which refused to pay blackmail had to\r\nleave; citizens were robbed more and more boldly; pay-rolls were padded\r\nwith the names of non-existent persons; work on public improvements was\r\nneglected, while money for them went to the boodlers.\r\n\r\nSome of the newspapers protested, disinterested citizens were alarmed,\r\nand the shrewder men gave warnings, but none dared make an effective\r\nstand. Behind the corruptionists were men of wealth and social standing,\r\nwho, because of special privileges granted them, felt bound to support\r\nand defend the looters. Independent victims of the far-reaching\r\nconspiracy submitted in silence, through fear of injury to their\r\nbusiness. Men whose integrity was never questioned, who held high\r\npositions of trust, who were church members and teachers of Bible\r\nclasses, contributed to the support of the dynasty,—became blackmailers,\r\nin fact,—and their excuse was that others did the same, and that if they\r\nproved the exception it would work their ruin. The system became loose\r\nthrough license and plenty till it was as wild and weak as that of Tweed\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nThen the unexpected happened—an accident. There was no uprising of the\r\npeople, but they were restive; and the Democratic party leaders,\r\nthinking to gain some independent votes, decided to raise the cry\r\n“reform” and put up a ticket of candidates different enough from the\r\nusual offerings of political parties to give color to their platform.\r\nThese leaders were not in earnest. There was little difference between\r\nthe two parties in the city; but the rascals that were in had been\r\ngetting the greater share of the spoils, and the “outs” wanted more than\r\nwas given to them. “Boodle” was not the issue, no exposures were made or\r\nthreatened, and the bosses expected to control their men if elected.\r\nSimply as part of the game, the Democrats raised the slogan, “reform”\r\nand “no more Ziegenheinism.”\r\n\r\nMayor Ziegenhein, called “Uncle Henry,” was a “good fellow,” “one of the\r\nboys,” and though it was during his administration that the city grew\r\nripe and went to rot, his opponents talked only of incompetence and\r\nneglect, and repeated such stories as that of his famous reply to some\r\ncitizens who complained because certain street lights were put out: “You\r\nhave the moon yet—ain’t it?”\r\n\r\nWhen somebody mentioned Joseph W. Folk for Circuit Attorney the leaders\r\nwere ready to accept him. They didn’t know much about him. He was a\r\nyoung man from Tennessee; had been President of the Jefferson Club, and\r\narbitrated the railroad strike of 1898. But Folk did not want the place.\r\nHe was a civil lawyer, had had no practice at the criminal bar, cared\r\nlittle about it, and a lucrative business as counsel for corporations\r\nwas interesting him. He rejected the invitation. The committee called\r\nagain and again, urging his duty to his party, and the city, etc.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he said, at last, “I will accept the nomination, but if\r\nelected I will do my duty. There must be no attempt to influence my\r\nactions when I am called upon to punish lawbreakers.”\r\n\r\nThe committeemen took such statements as the conventional platitudes of\r\ncandidates. They nominated him, the Democratic ticket was elected, and\r\nFolk became Circuit Attorney for the Eighth Missouri District.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after taking the oath of office his campaign pledges were\r\nput to the test. A number of arrests had been made in connection with\r\nthe recent election, and charges of illegal registration were preferred\r\nagainst men of both parties. Mr. Folk took them up like routine cases of\r\nordinary crime. Political bosses rushed to the rescue. Mr. Folk was\r\nreminded of his duty to his party, and told that he was expected to\r\nconstrue the law in such a manner that repeaters and other election\r\ncriminals who had hoisted Democracy’s flag and helped elect him might be\r\neither discharged or receive the minimum punishment. The nature of the\r\nyoung lawyer’s reply can best be inferred from the words of that veteran\r\npolitical leader, Colonel Ed Butler, who, after a visit to Mr. Folk,\r\nwrathfully exclaimed, “D—n Joe! he thinks he’s the whole thing as\r\nCircuit Attorney.”\r\n\r\nThe election cases were passed through the courts with astonishing\r\nrapidity; no more mercy was shown Democrats than Republicans, and before\r\nwinter came a number of ward heelers and old-time party workers were\r\nbehind the bars in Jefferson City. He next turned his attention to\r\ngrafters and straw bondsmen with whom the courts were infested, and\r\nseveral of these leeches are in the penitentiary to-day. The business\r\nwas broken up because of his activity. But Mr. Folk had made little more\r\nthan the beginning.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, late in January, 1903, a newspaper reporter, known as\r\n“Red” Galvin, called Mr. Folk’s attention to a ten-line newspaper item\r\nto the effect that a large sum of money had been placed in a bank for\r\nthe purpose of bribing certain Assemblymen to secure the passage of a\r\nstreet railroad ordinance. No names were mentioned, but Mr. Galvin\r\nsurmised that the bill referred to was one introduced on behalf of the\r\nSuburban Railway Company. An hour later Mr. Folk sent the names of\r\nnearly one hundred persons to the sheriff, with instructions to subpœna\r\nthem before the grand jury at once. The list included Councilmen,\r\nmembers of the House of Delegates, officers and directors of the\r\nSuburban Railway, bank presidents and cashiers. In three days the\r\ninvestigation was being pushed with vigor, but St. Louis was laughing at\r\nthe “huge joke.” Such things had been attempted before. The men who had\r\nbeen ordered to appear before the grand jury jested as they chatted in\r\nthe anterooms, and newspaper accounts of these preliminary examinations\r\nwere written in the spirit of burlesque.\r\n\r\nIt has developed since that Circuit Attorney Folk knew nothing, and was\r\nnot able to learn much more during the first few days; but he says he\r\nsaw here and there puffs of smoke and he determined to find the fire. It\r\nwas not an easy job. The first break into such a system is always\r\ndifficult. Mr. Folk began with nothing but courage and a strong personal\r\nconviction. He caused peremptory summons to be issued, for the immediate\r\nattendance in the grand jury room of Charles H. Turner, president of the\r\nSuburban Railway, and Philip Stock, a representative of brewers’\r\ninterests, who, he had reason to believe, was the legislative agent in\r\nthis deal.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Folk, “I have secured sufficient evidence to\r\nwarrant the return of indictments against you for bribery, and I shall\r\nprosecute you to the full extent of the law and send you to the\r\npenitentiary unless you tell to this grand jury the complete history of\r\nthe corruptionist methods employed by you to secure the passage of\r\nOrdinance No. 44. I shall give you three days to consider the matter. At\r\nthe end of that time, if you have not returned here and given us the\r\ninformation demanded, warrants will be issued for your arrest.”\r\n\r\nThey looked at the audacious young prosecutor and left the Four Courts\r\nbuilding without uttering a word. He waited. Two days later,\r\nex-Lieutenant Governor Charles P. Johnson, the veteran criminal lawyer,\r\ncalled, and said that his client, Mr. Stock, was in such poor health\r\nthat he would be unable to appear before the grand jury.\r\n\r\n“I am truly sorry that Mr. Stock is ill,” replied Mr. Folk, “for his\r\npresence here is imperative, and if he fails to appear he will be\r\narrested before sundown.”\r\n\r\nThat evening a conference was held in Governor Johnson’s office, and the\r\nnext day this story was told in the grand jury room by Charles H.\r\nTurner, millionaire president of the Suburban Railway, and corroborated\r\nby Philip Stock, man-about-town and a good fellow: The Suburban, anxious\r\nto sell out at a large profit to its only competitor, the St. Louis\r\nTransit Co., caused to be drafted the measure known as House Bill No.\r\n44. So sweeping were its grants that Mr. Turner, who planned and\r\nexecuted the document, told the directors in his confidence that its\r\nenactment into law would enhance the value of the property from three to\r\nsix million dollars. The bill introduced, Mr. Turner visited Colonel\r\nButler, who had long been known as a legislative agent, and asked his\r\nprice for securing the passage of the measure. “One hundred and\r\nforty-five thousand dollars will be my fee,” was the reply. The railway\r\npresident demurred. He would think the matter over, he said, and he\r\nhired a cheaper man, Mr. Stock. Stock conferred with the representative\r\nof the combine in the House of Delegates and reported that $75,000 would\r\nbe necessary in this branch of the Assembly. Mr. Turner presented a note\r\nindorsed by two of the directors whom he could trust, and secured a loan\r\nfrom the German American Savings Bank.\r\n\r\nBribe funds in pocket, the legislative agent telephoned John Murrell, at\r\nthat time a representative of the House combine, to meet him in the\r\noffice of the Lincoln Trust Company. There the two rented a safe-deposit\r\nbox. Mr. Stock placed in the drawer the roll of $75,000, and each\r\nsubscribed to an agreement that the box should not be opened unless both\r\nwere present. Of course the conditions spread upon the bank’s daybook\r\nmade no reference to the purpose for which this fund had been deposited,\r\nbut an agreement entered into by Messrs. Stock and Murrell was to the\r\neffect that the $75,000 should be given Mr. Murrell as soon as the bill\r\nbecame an ordinance, and by him distributed to the members of the\r\ncombine. Stock turned to the Council, and upon his report a further sum\r\nof $60,000 was secured. These bills were placed in a safe-deposit box of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley Trust Co., and the man who held the key as\r\nrepresentative of the Council combine was Charles H. Kratz.\r\n\r\nAll seemed well, but a few weeks after placing these funds in escrow,\r\nMr. Stock reported to his employer that there was an unexpected hitch\r\ndue to the action of Emil Meysenburg, who, as a member of the Council\r\nCommittee on Railroads, was holding up the report on the bill. Mr. Stock\r\nsaid that Mr. Meysenburg held some worthless shares in a defunct\r\ncorporation and wanted Mr. Stock to purchase this paper at its par value\r\nof $9,000. Mr. Turner gave Mr. Stock the money with which to buy the\r\nshares.\r\n\r\nThus the passage of House Bill 44 promised to cost the Suburban Railway\r\nCo. $144,000, only one thousand dollars less than that originally named\r\nby the political boss to whom Mr. Turner had first applied. The bill,\r\nhowever, passed both houses of the Assembly. The sworn servants of the\r\ncity had done their work and held out their hands for the bribe money.\r\n\r\nThen came a court mandate which prevented the Suburban Railway Co. from\r\nreaping the benefit of the vote-buying, and Charles H. Turner, angered\r\nat the check, issued orders that the money in safe-deposit boxes should\r\nnot be touched. War was declared between bribe-givers and bribe-takers,\r\nand the latter resorted to tactics which they hoped would frighten the\r\nSuburban people into submission—such as making enough of the story\r\npublic to cause rumors of impending prosecution. It was that first item\r\nwhich Mr. Folk saw and acted upon.\r\n\r\nWhen Messrs. Turner and Stock unfolded in the grand jury room the\r\ndetails of their bribery plot, Circuit Attorney Folk found himself in\r\npossession of verbal evidence of a great crime; he needed as material\r\nexhibits the two large sums of money in safe-deposit vaults of two of\r\nthe largest banking institutions of the West. Had this money been\r\nwithdrawn? Could he get it if it was there? Lock-boxes had always been\r\nconsidered sacred and beyond the power of the law to open. “I’ve always\r\nheld,” said Mr. Folk, “that the fact that a thing never had been done\r\nwas no reason for thinking it couldn’t be done.” He decided in this case\r\nthat the magnitude of the interests involved warranted unusual action,\r\nso he selected a committee of grand jurors and visited one of the banks.\r\nHe told the president, a personal friend, the facts that had come into\r\nhis possession, and asked permission to search for the fund.\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” was the reply. “Our rules deny anyone the right.”\r\n\r\n“Mr.——,” said Mr. Folk, “a crime has been committed, and you hold\r\nconcealed the principal evidence thereto. In the name of the State of\r\nMissouri I demand that you cause the box to be opened. If you refuse, I\r\nshall cause a warrant to be issued, charging you as an accessory.”\r\n\r\nFor a minute not a word was spoken by anyone in the room; then the\r\nbanker said in almost inaudible tones:\r\n\r\n“Give me a little time, gentlemen. I must consult with our legal adviser\r\nbefore taking such a step.”\r\n\r\n“We will wait ten minutes,” said the Circuit Attorney. “By that time we\r\nmust have access to the vault or a warrant will be applied for.”\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of that time a solemn procession wended its way from\r\nthe president’s office to the vaults in the sub-cellar—the president,\r\nthe cashier, and the corporation’s lawyer, the grand jurors, and the\r\nCircuit Attorney. All bent eagerly forward as the key was inserted in\r\nthe lock. The iron drawer yielded, and a roll of something wrapped in\r\nbrown paper was brought to light. The Circuit Attorney removed the\r\nrubber bands, and national bank notes of large denomination spread out\r\nflat before them. The money was counted, and the sum was $75,000!\r\n\r\nThe boodle fund was returned to its repository, officers of the bank\r\nwere told they would be held responsible for it until the courts could\r\nact. The investigators visited the other financial institution. They met\r\nwith more resistance there. The threat to procure a warrant had no\r\neffect until Mr. Folk left the building and set off in the direction of\r\nthe Four Courts. Then a messenger called him back, and the second box\r\nwas opened. In this was found $60,000. The chain of evidence was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment events moved rapidly. Charles Kratz and John K.\r\nMurrell, alleged representatives of Council and House combines, were\r\narrested on bench warrants and placed under heavy bonds. Kratz was\r\nbrought into court from a meeting at which plans were being formed for\r\nhis election to the National Congress. Murrell was taken from his\r\nundertaking establishment. Emil Meysenburg, millionaire broker, was\r\nseated in his office when a sheriff’s deputy entered and read a document\r\nthat charged him with bribery. The summons reached Henry Nicolaus while\r\nhe was seated at his desk, and the wealthy brewer was compelled to send\r\nfor a bondsman to avoid passing a night in jail. The cable flashed the\r\nnews to Cairo, Egypt, that Ellis Wainwright, many times a millionaire,\r\nproprietor of the St. Louis brewery that bears this name, had been\r\nindicted. Julius Lehmann, one of the members of the House of Delegates,\r\nwho had joked while waiting in the grand jury’s anteroom, had his\r\nlaughter cut short by the hand of a deputy sheriff on his shoulder and\r\nthe words, “You are charged with perjury.” He was joined at the bar of\r\nthe criminal court by Harry Faulkner, another jolly good fellow.\r\n\r\nConsternation spread among the boodle gang. Some of the men took night\r\ntrains for other States and foreign countries; the majority remained and\r\ncounseled together. Within twenty-four hours after the first indictments\r\nwere returned, a meeting of bribe-givers and bribe-takers was held in\r\nSouth St. Louis. The total wealth of those in attendance was\r\n$30,000,000, and their combined political influence sufficient to carry\r\nany municipal election under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nThis great power was aligned in opposition to one man, who still was\r\nalone. It was not until many indictments had been returned that a\r\ncitizens’ committee was formed to furnish funds, and even then most of\r\nthe contributors concealed their identity. Mr. James L. Blair, the\r\ntreasurer, testified in court that they were afraid to be known lest “it\r\nruin their business.”\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of corruptionists three courses were decided upon.\r\nPolitical leaders were to work on the Circuit Attorney by promise of\r\nfuture reward, or by threats. Detectives were to ferret out of the young\r\nlawyer’s past anything that could be used against him. Witnesses would\r\nbe sent out of town and provided with money to remain away until the\r\nadjournment of the grand jury.\r\n\r\nMr. Folk at once felt the pressure, and it was of a character to startle\r\none. Statesmen, lawyers, merchants, clubmen, churchmen—in fact, men\r\nprominent in all walks of life—visited him at his office and at his\r\nhome, and urged that he cease such activity against his\r\nfellow-townspeople. Political preferment was promised if he would yield;\r\na political grave if he persisted. Threatening letters came, warning him\r\nof plots to murder, to disfigure, and to blackguard. Word came from\r\nTennessee that detectives were investigating every act of his life. Mr.\r\nFolk told the politicians that he was not seeking political favors, and\r\nnot looking forward to another office; the others he defied. Meantime he\r\nprobed the deeper into the municipal sore. With his first successes for\r\nprestige and aided by the panic among the boodlers, he soon had them\r\nsuspicious of one another, exchanging charges of betrayal, and ready to\r\n“squeal” or run at the slightest sign of danger. One member of the House\r\nof Delegates became so frightened while under the inquisitorial\r\ncross-fire that he was seized with a nervous chill; his false teeth fell\r\nto the floor, and the rattle so increased his alarm that he rushed from\r\nthe room without stopping to pick up his teeth, and boarded the next\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Mr. Folk had dug up the intimate history of ten\r\nyears of corruption, especially of the business of the North and South\r\nand the Central Traction franchise grants, the last-named being even\r\nmore iniquitous than the Suburban.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1898 a “promoter” rented a bridal suite at the Planters’ Hotel,\r\nand having stocked the rooms with wines, liquors, and cigars until they\r\nresembled a candidate’s headquarters during a convention, sought\r\nintroduction to members of the Assembly and to such political bosses as\r\nhad influence with the city fathers. Two weeks after his arrival the\r\nCentral Traction bill was introduced “by request” in the Council. The\r\nmeasure was a blanket franchise, granting rights of way which had not\r\nbeen given to old-established companies, and permitting the\r\nbeneficiaries to parallel any track in the city. It passed both Houses\r\ndespite the protests of every newspaper in the city, save one, and was\r\nvetoed by the mayor. The cost to the promoter was $145,000.\r\n\r\nPreparations were made to pass the bill over the executive’s veto. The\r\nbridal suite was restocked, larger sums of money were placed on deposit\r\nin the banks, and the services of three legislative agents were engaged.\r\nEvidence now in the possession of the St. Louis courts tells in detail\r\nthe disposition of $250,000 of bribe money. Sworn statements prove that\r\n$75,000 was spent in the House of Delegates. The remainder of the\r\n$250,000 was distributed in the Council, whose members, though few in\r\nnumber, appraised their honor at a higher figure on account of their\r\nhigher positions in the business and social world. Finally, but one vote\r\nwas needed to complete the necessary two-thirds in the upper Chamber. To\r\nsecure this a councilman of reputed integrity was paid $50,000 in\r\nconsideration that he vote aye when the ordinance should come up for\r\nfinal passage. But the promoter did not dare risk all upon the vote of\r\none man, and he made this novel proposition to another honored member,\r\nwho accepted it:\r\n\r\n“You will vote on roll call after Mr. ——. I will place $45,000 in the\r\nhands of your son, which amount will become yours, if you have to vote\r\nfor the measure because of Mr. ——‘s not keeping his promise. But if he\r\nstands out for it you can vote against it, and the money shall revert to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nOn the evening when the bill was read for final passage the City Hall\r\nwas crowded with ward heelers and lesser politicians. These men had been\r\nengaged by the promoter, at five and ten dollars a head, to cheer on the\r\nboodling Assemblymen. The bill passed the House with a rush, and all\r\ncrowded into the Council Chamber. While the roll was being called the\r\nsilence was profound, for all knew that some men in the Chamber whose\r\nreputations had been free from blemish, were under promise and pay to\r\npart with honor that night. When the clerk was two-thirds down the list\r\nthose who had kept count knew that but one vote was needed. One more\r\nname was called. The man addressed turned red, then white, and after a\r\nmoment’s hesitation he whispered “aye”! The silence was so death-like\r\nthat his vote was heard throughout the room, and those near enough heard\r\nalso the sigh of relief that escaped from the member who could now vote\r\n“no” and save his reputation.\r\n\r\nThe Central Franchise bill was a law, passed over the mayor’s veto. The\r\npromoter had expended nearly $300,000 in securing the legislation, but\r\nwithin a week he sold his rights of way to “Eastern capitalists” for\r\n$1,250,000. The United Railways Company was formed, and without owning\r\nan inch of steel rail, or a plank in a car, was able to compel every\r\nstreet railroad in St. Louis, with the exception of the Suburban, to\r\npart with stock and right of way and agree to a merger. Out of this grew\r\nthe St. Louis Transit Company of to-day.\r\n\r\nSeveral incidents followed this legislative session. After the Assembly\r\nhad adjourned, a promoter entertained the $50,000 councilman at a\r\ndowntown restaurant. During the supper the host remarked to his guest,\r\n“I wish you would lend me that $50,000 until to-morrow. There are some\r\nof the boys outside whom I haven’t paid.” The money changed hands. The\r\nnext day, having waited in vain for the promoter, Mr. Councilman armed\r\nhimself with a revolver and began a search of the hotels. The hunt in\r\nSt. Louis proved fruitless, but the irate legislator kept on the trail\r\nuntil he came face to face with the lobbyist in the corridor of the\r\nWaldorf-Astoria. The New Yorker, seeing the danger, seized the St.\r\nLouisan by the arm and said soothingly, “There, there; don’t take on so.\r\nI was called away suddenly. Come to supper with me; I will give you the\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted, and champagne soon was flowing. When the\r\nman from the West had become sufficiently maudlin the promoter passed\r\nover to him a letter, which he had dictated to a typewriter while away\r\nfrom the table for a few minutes. The statement denied all knowledge of\r\nbribery.\r\n\r\n“You sign that and I will pay you $5,000. Refuse, and you don’t get a\r\ncent,” said the promoter. The St. Louisan returned home carrying the\r\n$5,000, and that was all.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the promoter had not fared so well with other spoilsmen. By\r\nthe terms of the ante-legislation agreement referred to above, the son\r\nof one councilman was pledged to return $45,000 if his father was saved\r\nthe necessity of voting for the bill. The next day the New Yorker sought\r\nout this young man and asked for the money.\r\n\r\n“I am not going to give it to you,” was the cool rejoinder. “My mamma\r\nsays that it is bribe money and that it would be wrong to give it to\r\neither you or father, so I shall keep it myself.” And he did. When\r\nsummoned before the grand jury this young man asked to be relieved from\r\nanswering questions. “I am afraid I might commit perjury,” he said. He\r\nwas advised to “Tell the truth and there will be no risk.”\r\n\r\n“It would be all right,” said the son, “if Mr. Folk would tell me what\r\nthe other fellows have testified to. Please have him do that.”\r\n\r\nTwo indictments were found as the result of this Central Traction bill,\r\nand bench warrants were served on Robert M. Snyder and George J.\r\nKobusch. The State charged the former with being one of the promoters of\r\nthe bill, the definite allegation being bribery. Mr. Kobusch, who is\r\npresident of a street car manufacturing company, was charged with\r\nperjury.\r\n\r\nThe first case tried was that of Emil Meysenburg, the millionaire who\r\ncompelled the Suburban people to purchase his worthless stock. He was\r\ndefended by three attorneys of high repute in criminal jurisprudence,\r\nbut the young Circuit Attorney proved equal to the emergency, and a\r\nconviction was secured. Three years in the penitentiary was the\r\nsentence. Charles Kratz, the Congressional candidate, forfeited $40,000\r\nby flight, and John K. Murrell also disappeared. Mr. Folk traced Murrell\r\nto Mexico, caused his arrest in Guadalajara, negotiated with the\r\nauthorities for his surrender, and when this failed, arranged for his\r\nreturn home to confess, and his evidence brought about the indictment,\r\non September 8, of eighteen members of the municipal legislature. The\r\nsecond case was that of Julius Lehmann. Two years at hard labor was the\r\nsentence, and the man who had led the jokers in the grand jury anteroom\r\nwould have fallen when he heard it, had not a friend been standing near.\r\n\r\nBesides the convictions of these and other men of good standing in the\r\ncommunity, and the flight of many more, partnerships were dissolved,\r\ncompanies had to be reorganized, business houses were closed because\r\ntheir proprietors were absent, but Mr. Folk, deterred as little by\r\nsuccess as by failure, moved right on; he was not elated; he was not\r\nsorrowful. The man proceeded with his work quickly, surely, smilingly,\r\nwithout fear or pity. The terror spread, and the rout was complete.\r\n\r\nWhen another grand jury was sworn and proceeded to take testimony there\r\nwere scores of men who threw up their hands and crying “_Mea culpa!_”\r\nbegged to be permitted to tell all they knew and not be prosecuted. The\r\ninquiry broadened. The son of a former mayor was indicted for misconduct\r\nin office while serving as his father’s private secretary, and the grand\r\njury recommended that the ex-mayor be sued in the civil courts, to\r\nrecover interests on public money which he had placed in his own pocket.\r\nA true bill fell on a former City Register, and more Assemblymen were\r\narrested, charged with making illegal contracts with the city. At last\r\nthe ax struck upon the trunk of the greatest oak of the forest. Colonel\r\nButler, the boss who has controlled elections in St. Louis for many\r\nyears, the millionaire who had risen from bellows-boy in a blacksmith’s\r\nshop to be the maker and guide of the Governors of Missouri, one of the\r\nmen who helped nominate and elect Folk—he also was indicted on two\r\ncounts charging attempted bribery. That Butler has controlled\r\nlegislation in St. Louis had long been known. It was generally\r\nunderstood that he owned Assemblymen before they ever took the oath of\r\noffice, and that he did not have to pay for votes. And yet open bribery\r\nwas the allegation now. Two members of the Board of Health stood ready\r\nto swear that he offered them $2,500 for their approval of a garbage\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nPitiful? Yes, but typical. Other cities are to-day in the same condition\r\nas St. Louis before Mr. Folk was invited in to see its rottenness.\r\nChicago is cleaning itself up just now, so is Minneapolis, and Pittsburg\r\nrecently had a bribery scandal; Boston is at peace, Cincinnati and St.\r\nPaul are satisfied, while Philadelphia is happy with the worst\r\ngovernment in the world. As for the small towns and the villages, many\r\nof these are busy as bees at the loot.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, indeed, in its disgrace, has a great advantage. It was\r\nexposed late; it has not been reformed and caught again and again, until\r\nits citizens are reconciled to corruption. But, best of all, the man who\r\nhas turned St. Louis inside out, turned it, as it were, upside down,\r\ntoo. In all cities, the better classes—the business men—are the sources\r\nof corruption; but they are so rarely pursued and caught that we do not\r\nfully realize whence the trouble comes. Thus most cities blame the\r\npoliticians and the ignorant and vicious poor.\r\n\r\nMr. Folk has shown St. Louis that its bankers, brokers, corporation\r\nofficers,—its business men are the sources of evil, so that from the\r\nstart it will know the municipal problem in its true light. With a\r\ntradition for public spirit, it may drop Butler and its runaway bankers,\r\nbrokers, and brewers, and pushing aside the scruples of the hundreds of\r\nmen down in blue book, and red book, and church register, who are lying\r\nhidden behind the statutes of limitations, the city may restore good\r\ngovernment. Otherwise the exposures by Mr. Folk will result only in the\r\nperfection of the corrupt system. For the corrupt can learn a lesson\r\nwhen the good citizens cannot. The Tweed régime in New York taught\r\nTammany to organize its boodle business; the police exposure taught it\r\nto improve its method of collecting blackmail. And both now are almost\r\nperfect and safe. The rascals of St. Louis will learn in like manner;\r\nthey will concentrate the control of their bribery system, excluding\r\nfrom the profit-sharing the great mass of weak rascals, and carrying on\r\nthe business as a business in the interest of a trustworthy few.\r\nDistrict Attorney Jerome cannot catch the Tammany men, and Circuit\r\nAttorney Folk will not be able another time to break the St. Louis ring.\r\nThis is St. Louis’ one great chance.\r\n\r\nBut, for the rest of us, it does not matter about St. Louis any more\r\nthan it matters about Colonel Butler _et al._ The point is, that what\r\nwent on in St. Louis is going on in most of our cities, towns, and\r\nvillages. The problem of municipal government in America has not been\r\nsolved. The people may be tired of it, but they cannot give it up—not\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SHAME OF MINNEAPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_January, 1903_)\r\n\r\nWhenever anything extraordinary is done in American municipal politics,\r\nwhether for good or for evil, you can trace it almost invariably to one\r\nman. The people do not do it. Neither do the “gangs,” “combines,” or\r\npolitical parties. These are but instruments by which bosses (not\r\nleaders; we Americans are not led, but driven) rule the people, and\r\ncommonly sell them out. But there are at least two forms of the\r\nautocracy which has supplanted the democracy here as it has everywhere\r\ndemocracy has been tried. One is that of the organized majority by\r\nwhich, as with the Republican machine in Philadelphia, the boss has\r\nnormal control of more than half the voters. The other is that of the\r\nadroitly managed minority. The “good people” are herded into parties and\r\nstupefied with convictions and a name, Republican or Democrat; while the\r\n“bad people” are so organized or interested by the boss that he can\r\nwield their votes to enforce terms with party managers and decide\r\nelections. St. Louis is a conspicuous example of this form. Minneapolis\r\nis another. Colonel Ed Butler is the unscrupulous opportunist who\r\nhandled the non-partisan minority which turned St. Louis into a “boodle\r\ntown.” In Minneapolis “Doc” Ames was the man.\r\n\r\nMinneapolis is a New England town on the upper Mississippi. The\r\nmetropolis of the Northwest, it is the metropolis also of Norway and\r\nSweden in America. Indeed, it is the second largest Scandinavian city in\r\nthe world. But Yankees, straight from Down East, settled the town, and\r\ntheir New England spirit predominates. They had Bayard Taylor lecture\r\nthere in the early days of the settlement; they made it the seat of the\r\nUniversity of Minnesota. Yet even now, when the town has grown to a\r\npopulation of more than 200,000, you feel that there is something\r\nWestern about it too—a Yankee with a round Puritan head, an open prairie\r\nheart, and a great, big Scandinavian body. The “Roundhead” takes the\r\n“Squarehead” out into the woods, and they cut lumber by forests, or they\r\ngo out on the prairies and raise wheat and mill it into fleet-cargoes of\r\nflour. They work hard, they make money, they are sober, satisfied, busy\r\nwith their own affairs. There isn’t much time for public business. Taken\r\ntogether, Miles, Hans, and Ole are very American. Miles insists upon\r\nstrict laws, Ole and Hans want one or two Scandinavians on their ticket.\r\nThese things granted, they go off on raft or reaper, leaving whoso will\r\nto enforce the lawn and run the city.\r\n\r\nThe people who were left to govern the city hated above all things\r\nstrict laws. They were the loafers, saloon keepers, gamblers, criminals,\r\nand the thriftless poor of all nationalities. Resenting the sobriety of\r\na staid, industrious community, and having no Irish to boss them, they\r\ndelighted to follow the jovial pioneer doctor, Albert Alonzo Ames. He\r\nwas the “good fellow”—a genial, generous reprobate. Devery, Tweed, and\r\nmany more have exposed in vain this amiable type. “Doc” Ames, tall,\r\nstraight, and cheerful, attracted men, and they gave him votes for his\r\nsmiles. He stood for license. There was nothing of the Puritan about\r\nhim. His father, the sturdy old pioneer, Dr. Alfred Elisha Ames, had a\r\nstrong strain of it in him, but he moved on with his family of six sons\r\nfrom Garden Prairie, Ill., to Fort Snelling reservation, in 1851, before\r\nMinneapolis was founded, and young Albert Alonzo, who then was ten years\r\nold, grew up free, easy, and tolerant. He was sent to school, then to\r\ncollege in Chicago, and he returned home a doctor of medicine before he\r\nwas twenty-one. As the town waxed soberer and richer, “Doc” grew gayer\r\nand more and more generous. Skillful as a surgeon, devoted as a\r\nphysician, and as a man kindly, he increased his practice till he was\r\nthe best-loved man in the community. He was especially good to the poor.\r\nAnybody could summon “Doc” Ames at any hour to any distance. He went,\r\nand he gave not only his professional service, but sympathy, and often\r\ncharity. “Richer men than you will pay your bill,” he told the\r\ndestitute. So there was a basis for his “good-fellowship.” There always\r\nis; these good fellows are not frauds—not in the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side to them sometimes. Ames was sunshine not to\r\nthe sick and destitute only. To the vicious and the depraved also he was\r\na comfort. If a man was a hard drinker, the good Doctor cheered him with\r\nanother drink; if he had stolen something, the Doctor helped to get him\r\noff. He was naturally vain; popularity developed his love of\r\napprobation. His loose life brought disapproval only from the good\r\npeople, so gradually the Doctor came to enjoy best the society of the\r\nbarroom and the streets. This society, flattered in turn, worshiped the\r\ngood Doctor, and, active in politics always, put its physician into the\r\narena.\r\n\r\nHad he been wise or even shrewd, he might have made himself a real\r\npower. But he wasn’t calculating, only light and frivolous, so he did\r\nnot organize his forces and run men for office. He sought office himself\r\nfrom the start, and he got most of the small places he wanted by\r\nchanging his party to seize the opportunity. His floating minority,\r\nadded to the regular partisan vote, was sufficient ordinarily for his\r\nuseless victories. As time went on he rose from smaller offices to be a\r\nRepublican mayor, then twice at intervals to be a Democratic mayor. He\r\nwas a candidate once for Congress; he stood for governor once on a sort\r\nof Populist-Democrat ticket. Ames could not get anything outside of his\r\nown town, however, and after his third term as mayor it was thought he\r\nwas out of politics altogether. He was getting old, and he was getting\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nLike many a “good fellow” with hosts of miscellaneous friends downtown\r\nto whom he was devoted, the good Doctor neglected his own family. From\r\nneglect he went on openly to separation from his wife and a second\r\nestablishment. The climax came not long before the election of 1900. His\r\nwife died. The family would not have the father at the funeral, but he\r\nappeared,—not at the house, but in a carriage on the street. He sat\r\nacross the way, with his feet up and a cigar in his mouth, till the\r\nfuneral moved; then he circled around, crossing it and meeting it, and\r\nmaking altogether a scene which might well close any man’s career.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t end his. The people had just secured the passage of a new\r\nprimary law to establish direct popular government. There were to be no\r\nmore nominations by convention. The voters were to ballot for their\r\nparty candidates. By a slip of some sort, the laws did not specify that\r\nRepublicans only should vote for Republican candidates, and only\r\nDemocrats for Democratic candidates. Any voter could vote at either\r\nprimary. Ames, in disrepute with his own party, the Democratic, bade his\r\nfollowers vote for his nomination for mayor on the Republican ticket.\r\nThey all voted; not all the Republicans did. He was nominated.\r\nNomination is far from election, and you would say that the trick would\r\nnot help him. But that was a Presidential year, so the people of\r\nMinneapolis had to vote for Ames, the Republican candidate for mayor.\r\nBesides, Ames said he was going to reform; that he was getting old, and\r\nwanted to close his career with a good administration. The effective\r\nargument, however, was that, since McKinley had to be elected to save\r\nthe country, Ames must be supported for mayor of Minneapolis. Why? The\r\ngreat American people cannot be trusted to scratch a ticket.\r\n\r\nWell, Minneapolis got its old mayor back, and he was indeed “reformed.”\r\nUp to this time Ames had not been very venal personally. He was a\r\n“spender,” not a “grafter,” and he was guilty of corruption chiefly by\r\nproxy; he took the honors and left the spoils to his followers. His\r\nadministrations were no worse than the worst. Now, however, he set out\r\nupon a career of corruption which for deliberateness, invention, and\r\navarice has never been equaled. It was as if he had made up his mind\r\nthat he had been careless long enough, and meant to enrich his last\r\nyears. He began promptly.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon his election, before he took office (on January 7,\r\n1901), he organized a cabinet and laid plans to turn the city over to\r\noutlaws who were to work under police direction for the profit of his\r\nadministration. He chose for chief his brother, Colonel Fred W. Ames,\r\nwho had recently returned under a cloud from service in the Philippines.\r\nBut he was a weak vessel for chief of police, and the mayor picked for\r\nchief of detectives an abler man, who was to direct the more difficult\r\noperations. This was Norman W. King, a former gambler, who knew the\r\ncriminals needed in the business ahead. King was to invite to\r\nMinneapolis thieves, confidence men, pickpockets and gamblers, and\r\nrelease some that were in the local jail. They were to be organized into\r\ngroups, according to their profession, and detectives were assigned to\r\nassist and direct them. The head of the gambling syndicate was to have\r\ncharge of the gambling, making the terms and collecting the “graft,”\r\njust as King and a Captain Hill were to collect from the thieves. The\r\ncollector for women of the town was to be Irwin A. Gardner, a medical\r\nstudent in the Doctor’s office, who was made a special policeman for the\r\npurpose. These men looked over the force, selected those men who could\r\nbe trusted, charged them a price for their retention, and marked for\r\ndismissal 107 men out of 225, the 107 being the best policemen in the\r\ndepartment from the point of view of the citizens who afterward\r\nreorganized the force. John Fitchette, better known as “Coffee John,” a\r\nVirginian (who served on the Jefferson Davis jury), the keeper of a\r\nnotorious coffee-house, was to be a captain of police, with no duties\r\nexcept to sell places on the police force.\r\n\r\nAnd they did these things that they planned—all and more. The\r\nadministration opened with the revolution on the police force. The\r\nthieves in the local jail were liberated, and it was made known to the\r\nUnder World generally that “things were doing” in Minneapolis. The\r\nincoming swindlers reported to King or his staff for instructions, and\r\nwent to work, turning the “swag” over to the detectives in charge.\r\nGambling went on openly, and disorderly houses multiplied under the\r\nfostering care of Gardner, the medical student. But all this was not\r\nenough. Ames dared to break openly into the municipal system of vice\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThere was such a thing. Minneapolis, strict in its laws, forbade vices\r\nwhich are inevitable, then regularly permitted them under certain\r\nconditions. Legal limits, called “patrol lines,” were prescribed, within\r\nwhich saloons might be opened. These ran along the river front, out\r\nthrough part of the business section, with long arms reaching into the\r\nScandinavian quarters, north and south. Gambling also was confined, but\r\nmore narrowly. And there were limits, also arbitrary, but not always\r\nidentical with those for gambling, within which the social evil was\r\nallowed. But the novel feature of this scheme was that disorderly houses\r\nwere practically licensed by the city, the women appearing before the\r\nclerk of the Municipal Court each month to pay a “fine” of $100. Unable\r\nat first to get this “graft,” Ames’s man Gardner persuaded women to\r\nstart houses, apartments, and, of all things, candy stores, which sold\r\nsweets to children and tobacco to the “lumber Jacks” in front, while a\r\nnefarious traffic was carried on in the rear. But they paid Ames, not\r\nthe city, and that was all this “reform” administration cared about.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all these sources must have been large. It only whetted\r\nthe avarice of the mayor and his Cabinet. They let gambling privileges\r\nwithout restriction as to location or “squareness”; the syndicate could\r\ncheat and rob as it would. Peddlers and pawnbrokers, formerly licensed\r\nby the city, bought permits now instead from the mayor’s agent in this\r\nfield. Some two hundred slot machines were installed in various parts of\r\nthe town, with owner’s agent and mayor’s agent watching and collecting\r\nfrom them enough to pay the mayor $15,000 a year as his share. Auction\r\nfrauds were instituted. Opium joints and unlicensed saloons, called\r\n“blind pigs,” were protected. Gardner even had a police baseball team,\r\nfor whose games tickets were sold to people who had to buy them. But the\r\nwomen were the easiest “graft.” They were compelled to buy illustrated\r\nbiographies of the city officials; they had to give presents of money,\r\njewelry, and gold stars to police officers. But the money they still\r\npaid direct to the city in fines, some $35,000 a year, fretted the\r\nmayor, and at last he reached for it. He came out with a declaration, in\r\nhis old character as friend of the oppressed, that $100 a month was too\r\nmuch for these women to pay. They should be required to pay the city\r\nfine only once in two months. This puzzled the town till it became\r\ngenerally known that Gardner collected the other month for the mayor.\r\nThe final outrage in this department, however, was an order of the mayor\r\nfor the periodic visits to disorderly houses, by the city’s physicians,\r\nat from $5 to $20 per visit. The two physicians he appointed called when\r\nthey willed, and more and more frequently, till toward the end the calls\r\nbecame a pure formality, with the collections as the one and only\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FACSIMILE OF THE FIRST PAGE OF “THE BIG MITT LEDGER”\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn a general way all this business was known. It did not arouse the\r\ncitizens, but it did attract criminals, and more and more thieves and\r\nswindlers came hurrying to Minneapolis. Some of them saw the police, and\r\nmade terms. Some were seen by the police and invited to go to work.\r\nThere was room for all. This astonishing fact that the government of a\r\ncity asked criminals to rob the people is fully established. The police\r\nand the criminals confessed it separately. Their statements agree in\r\ndetail. Detective Norbeck made the arrangements, and introduced the\r\nswindlers to Gardner, who, over King’s head, took the money from them.\r\nHere is the story “Billy” Edwards, a “big mitt” man, told under oath of\r\nhis reception in Minneapolis:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PAGE FROM “THE BIG MITT LEDGER”\r\n\r\n  This shows an item concerning the check for $775, which\r\n  the “sucker” Meix (here spelled Mix) wished not to have\r\n  honored.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“I had been out to the Coast, and hadn’t seen Norbeck for some time.\r\nAfter I returned I boarded a Minneapolis car one evening to go down to\r\nSouth Minneapolis to visit a friend. Norbeck and Detective DeLaittre\r\nwere on the car. When Norbeck saw me he came up and shook hands, and\r\nsaid, ‘Hullo, Billy, how goes it?’ I said, ‘Not very well.’ Then he\r\nsays, ‘Things have changed since you went away. Me and Gardner are the\r\nwhole thing now. Before you left they thought I didn’t know anything,\r\nbut I turned a few tricks, and now I’m It.’ ‘I’m glad of that, Chris,’ I\r\nsaid. He says, ‘I’ve got great things for you. I’m going to fix up a\r\njoint for you.’ ‘That’s good,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe you can do\r\nit.’ ‘Oh, yes, I can,’ he replied. ‘I’m It now—Gardner and me.’ ‘Well,\r\nif you can do it,’ says I, ‘there’s money in it.’ ‘How much can you\r\npay?’ he asked. ‘Oh, $150 or $200 a week,’ says I. ‘That settles it,’ he\r\nsaid; ‘I’ll take you down to see Gardner, and we’ll fix it up.’ Then he\r\nmade an appointment to meet me the next night, and we went down to\r\nGardner’s house together.”\r\n\r\nThere Gardner talked business in general, showed his drawer full of\r\nbills, and jokingly asked how Edwards would like to have them. Edwards\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“I said, ‘That looks pretty good to me,’ and Gardner told us that he had\r\n‘collected’ the money from the women he had on his staff, and that he\r\nwas going to pay it over to the ‘old man’ when he got back from his\r\nhunting trip next morning. Afterward he told me that the mayor had been\r\nmuch pleased with our $500, and that he said everything was all right,\r\nand for us to go ahead.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PAGE FROM “THE BIG MITT LEDGER”\r\n\r\n  This shows the accounts for a week of small transactions.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Link” Crossman, another confidence man who was with Edwards, said that\r\nGardner demanded $1,000 at first, but compromised on $500 for the mayor,\r\n$50 for Gardner, and $50 for Norbeck. To the chief, Fred Ames, they gave\r\ntips now and then of $25 or $50. “The first week we ran,” said Crossman,\r\n“I gave Fred $15. Norbeck took me down there. We shook hands, and I\r\nhanded him an envelope with $15. He pulled out a list of steerers we had\r\nsent him, and said he wanted to go over them with me. He asked where the\r\njoint was located. At another time I slipped $25 into his hand as he was\r\nstanding in the hallway of City Hall.” But these smaller payments, after\r\nthe first “opening, $500,” are all down on the pages of the “big mitt”\r\nledger, photographs of which illuminate this article. This notorious\r\nbook, which was kept by Charlie Howard, one of the “big mitt” men, was\r\nmuch talked of at the subsequent trials, but was kept hidden to await\r\nthe trial of the mayor himself.\r\n\r\nThe “big mitt” game was swindling by means of a stacked hand at stud\r\npoker. “Steerers” and “boosters” met “suckers” on the street, at hotels,\r\nand railway stations, won their confidence, and led them to the “joint.”\r\nUsually the “sucker” was called, by the amount of his loss, “the\r\n$102-man” or “the $35-man.” Roman Meix alone had the distinction among\r\nall the Minneapolis victims of going by his own name. Having lost $775,\r\nhe became known for his persistent complainings. But they all “kicked”\r\nsome. To Detective Norbeck at the street door was assigned the duty of\r\nhearing their complaints, and “throwing a scare into them.” “Oh, so\r\nyou’ve been gambling,” he would say. “Have you got a license? Well,\r\nthen, you better get right out of this town.” Sometimes he accompanied\r\nthem to the station and saw them off. If they were not to be put off\r\nthus, he directed them to the chief of police. Fred Ames tried to wear\r\nthem out by keeping them waiting in the anteroom. If they outlasted him,\r\nhe saw them and frightened them with threats of all sorts of trouble for\r\ngambling without a license. Meix wanted to have payment on his check\r\nstopped. Ames, who had been a bank clerk, told him of his banking\r\nexperience, and then had the effrontery to say that payment on such a\r\ncheck could not be stopped.\r\n\r\nBurglaries were common. How many the police planned may never be known.\r\nCharles F. Brackett and Fred Malone, police captains and detectives,\r\nwere active, and one well-established crime of theirs is the robbery of\r\nthe Pabst Brewing Company office. They persuaded two men, one an\r\nemployee, to learn the combination of the safe, open and clean it out\r\none night, while the two officers stood guard outside.\r\n\r\nThe excesses of the municipal administration became so notorious that\r\nsome of the members of it remonstrated with the others, and certain\r\ncounty officers were genuinely alarmed. No restraint followed their\r\nwarnings. Sheriff Megaarden, no Puritan himself, felt constrained to\r\ninterfere, and he made some arrests of gamblers. The Ames people turned\r\nupon him in a fury; they accused him of making overcharges in his\r\naccounts with the county for fees, and, laying the evidence before\r\nGovernor Van Sant, they had Megaarden removed from office. Ames offered\r\nbribes to two county commissioners to appoint Gardner sheriff, so as to\r\nbe sure of no more trouble in that quarter. This move failed, but the\r\nlesson taught Megaarden served to clear the atmosphere, and the\r\nspoliation went on as recklessly as ever. It became impossible.\r\n\r\nEven lawlessness must be regulated. Dr. Ames, never an organizer,\r\nattempted no control, and his followers began to quarrel among\r\nthemselves. They deceived one another; they robbed the thieves; they\r\nrobbed Ames himself. His brother became dissatisfied with his share of\r\nthe spoils, and formed cabals with captains who plotted against the\r\nadministration and set up disorderly houses, “panel games,” and all\r\nsorts of “grafts” of their own.\r\n\r\nThe one man loyal to the mayor was Gardner; and Fred Ames, Captain King,\r\nand their pals plotted the fall of the favorite. Now anybody could get\r\nanything from the Doctor, if he could have him alone. The Fred Ames\r\nclique chose a time when the mayor was at West Baden; they filled him\r\nwith suspicion of Gardner and the fear of exposure, and induced him to\r\nlet a creature named “Reddy” Cohen, instead of Gardner, do the\r\ncollecting, and pay over all the moneys, not directly, but through Fred.\r\nGardner made a touching appeal. “I have been honest. I have paid you\r\nall,” he said to the mayor. “Fred and the rest will rob you.” This was\r\ntrue, but it was of no avail.\r\n\r\nFred Ames was in charge at last, and he himself went about giving notice\r\nof the change. Three detectives were with him when he visited the women,\r\nand here is the women’s story, in the words of one, as it was told again\r\nand again in court: “Colonel Ames came in with the detectives. He\r\nstepped into a side room and asked me if I had been paying Gardner. I\r\ntold him I had, and he told me not to pay no more, but to come to his\r\noffice later, and he would let me know what to do. I went to the City\r\nHall in about three weeks, after Cohen had called and said he was ‘the\r\nparty.’ I asked the chief if it was all right to pay Cohen, and he said\r\nit was.”\r\n\r\nThe new arrangement did not work so smoothly as the old. Cohen was an\r\noppressive collector, and Fred Ames, appealed to, was weak and lenient.\r\nHe had no sure hold on the force. His captains, free of Gardner, were\r\nundermining the chief. They increased their private operations. Some of\r\nthe detectives began to drink hard and neglect their work. Norbeck so\r\nworried the “big mitt” men by staying away from the joint, that they\r\ncomplained to Fred about him. The chief rebuked Norbeck, and he promised\r\nto “do better,” but thereafter he was paid, not by the week, but by\r\npiece work—so much for each “trimmed sucker” that he ran out of town.\r\nProtected swindlers were arrested for operating in the street by “Coffee\r\nJohn’s” new policemen, who took the places of the negligent detectives.\r\nFred let the indignant prisoners go when they were brought before him,\r\nbut the arrests were annoying, inconvenient, and disturbed business. The\r\nwhole system became so demoralized that every man was for himself. There\r\nwas not left even the traditional honor among thieves.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture, in April, 1902, that the grand jury for the\r\nsummer term was drawn. An ordinary body of unselected citizens, it\r\nreceived no special instructions from the bench; the county prosecutor\r\noffered it only routine work to do. But there was a man among them who\r\nwas a fighter—the foreman, Hovey C. Clarke. He was of an old New England\r\nfamily. Coming to Minneapolis when a young man, seventeen years before,\r\nhe had fought for employment, fought with his employers for position,\r\nfought with his employees, the lumber Jacks, for command, fought for his\r\ncompany against competitors; and he had won always, till now he had the\r\nhabit of command, the impatient, imperious manner of the master, and the\r\nassurance of success which begets it. He did not want to be a grand\r\njuryman, he did not want to be a foreman; but since he was both, he\r\nwanted to accomplish something.\r\n\r\nWhy not rip up the Ames gang? Heads shook, hands went up; it was useless\r\nto try. The discouragement fired Clarke. That was just what he would do,\r\nhe said, and he took stock of his jury. Two or three were men with\r\nbackbone; that he knew, and he quickly had them with him. The rest were\r\nall sorts of men. Mr. Clarke won over each man to himself, and\r\ninterested them all. Then he called for the county prosecutor. The\r\nprosecutor was a politician; he knew the Ames crowd; they were too\r\npowerful to attack.\r\n\r\n“You are excused,” said the foreman.\r\n\r\nThere was a scene; the prosecutor knew his rights.\r\n\r\n“Do you think, Mr. Clarke,” he cried, “that you can run the grand jury\r\nand my office, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Clarke, “I will run your office if I want to; and I want to.\r\nYou’re excused.”\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke does not talk much about his doings that summer; he isn’t the\r\ntalking sort. But he does say that all he did was to apply simple\r\nbusiness methods to his problem. In action, however, these turned out to\r\nbe the most approved police methods. He hired a lot of local detectives\r\nwho, he knew, would talk about what they were doing, and thus would be\r\nwatched by the police. Having thus thrown a false scent, he hired some\r\nother detectives whom nobody knew about. This was expensive; so were\r\nmany of the other things he did; but he was bound to win, so he paid the\r\nprice, drawing freely on his own and his colleagues’ pockets. (The total\r\ncost to the county for a long summer’s work by this grand jury was\r\n$259.) With his detectives out, he himself went to the jail to get tips\r\nfrom the inside, from criminals who, being there, must have grievances.\r\nHe made the acquaintance of the jailer, Captain Alexander, and Alexander\r\nwas a friend of Sheriff Megaarden. Yes, he had some men there who were\r\n“sore” and might want to get even.\r\n\r\nNow two of these were “big mitt” men who had worked for Gardner. One was\r\n“Billy” Edwards, the other “Cheerful Charlie” Howard. I heard too many\r\nexplanations of their plight to choose any one; this general account\r\nwill cover the ground: In the Ames mêlée, either by mistake, neglect, or\r\nfor spite growing out of the network of conflicting interests and gangs,\r\nthey were arrested and arraigned, not before Fred Ames, but before a\r\njudge, and held in bail too high for them to furnish. They had paid for\r\nan unexpired period of protection, yet could get neither protection nor\r\nbail. They were forgotten. “We got the double cross all right,” they\r\nsaid, and they bled with their grievance; but squeal, no, sir!—that was\r\n“another deal.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Clarke had their story, and he was bound to force them to tell\r\nit under oath on the stand. If they did, Gardner and Norbeck would be\r\nindicted, tried, and probably convicted. In themselves, these men were\r\nof no great importance; but they were the key to the situation, and a\r\nway up to the mayor. It was worth trying. Mr. Clarke went into the jail\r\nwith Messrs. Lester Elwood and Willard J. Hield, grand jurors on whom he\r\nrelied most for delicate work. They stood by while the foreman talked.\r\nAnd the foreman’s way of talking was to smile, swear, threaten, and\r\ncajole. “Billy” Edwards told me afterwards that he and Howard were\r\nfinally persuaded to turn State’s evidence, because they believed that\r\nMr. Clarke was the kind of a man to keep his promises and fulfill his\r\nthreats. “We,” he said, meaning criminals generally, “are always\r\nstacking up against juries and lawyers who want us to holler. We don’t,\r\nbecause we see they ain’t wise, and won’t get there. They’re quitters;\r\nthey can be pulled off. Clarke has a hard eye. I know men. It’s my\r\nbusiness to size ‘em up, and I took him for a winner, and I played in\r\nwith him against that whole big bunch of easy things that was running\r\nthings on the bum.” The grand jury was ready at the end of three weeks\r\nof hard work to find bills. A prosecutor was needed. The public\r\nprosecutor was being ignored, but his first assistant and friend, Al J.\r\nSmith, was taken in hand by Mr. Clarke. Smith hesitated; he knew better\r\neven than the foreman the power and resources of the Ames gang. But he\r\ncame to believe in Mr. Clarke, just as Edwards had; he was sure the\r\nforeman would win; so he went over to his side, and, having once\r\ndecided, he led the open fighting, and, alone in court, won cases\r\nagainst men who had the best lawyers in the State to defend them. His\r\ncourt record is extraordinary. Moreover, he took over the negotiations\r\nwith criminals for evidence, Messrs. Clarke, Hield, Elwood, and the\r\nother jurors providing means and moral support. These were needed.\r\nBribes were offered to Smith; he was threatened; he was called a fool.\r\nBut so was Clarke, to whom $28,000 was offered to quit, and for whose\r\nslaughter a slugger was hired to come from Chicago. What startled the\r\njury most, however, was the character of the citizens who were sent to\r\nthem to dissuade them from their course. No reform I ever studied has\r\nfailed to bring out this phenomenon of virtuous cowardice, the baseness\r\nof the decent citizen.\r\n\r\nNothing stopped this jury, however. They had courage. They indicted\r\nGardner, Norbeck, Fred Ames, and many lesser persons. But the gang had\r\ncourage, too, and raised a defense fund to fight Clarke. Mayor Ames was\r\ndefiant. Once, when Mr. Clarke called at the City Hall, the mayor met\r\nand challenged him. The mayor’s heelers were all about him, but Clarke\r\nfaced him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Doc Ames, I’m after you,” he said. “I’ve been in this town for\r\nseventeen years, and all that time you’ve been a moral leper. I hear you\r\nwere rotten during the ten years before that. Now I’m going to put you\r\nwhere all contagious things are put—where you cannot contaminate anybody\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\nThe trial of Gardner came on. Efforts had been made to persuade him to\r\nsurrender the mayor, but the young man was paid $15,000 “to stand pat,”\r\nand he went to trial and conviction silent. Other trials followed\r\nfast—Norbeck’s, Fred Ames’s, Chief of Detectives King’s. Witnesses who\r\nwere out of the State were needed, and true testimony from women. There\r\nwas no county money for extradition, so the grand jurors paid these\r\ncosts also. They had Meix followed from Michigan down to Mexico and back\r\nto Idaho, where they got him, and he was presented in court one day at\r\nthe trial of Norbeck, who had “steered” him out of town. Norbeck thought\r\nMeix was a thousand miles away, and had been bold before. At the sight\r\nof him in court he started to his feet, and that night ran away. The\r\njury spent more money in his pursuit, and they caught him. He confessed,\r\nbut his evidence was not accepted. He was sentenced to three years in\r\nState’s prison. Men caved all around, but the women were firm, and the\r\nfirst trial of Fred Ames failed. To break the women’s faith in the ring,\r\nMayor Ames was indicted for offering the bribe to have Gardner made\r\nsheriff—a genuine, but not the best case against him. It brought the\r\nwomen down to the truth, and Fred Ames, retried, was convicted and\r\nsentenced to six and a half years in State’s prison. King was tried for\r\naccessory to felony (helping in the theft of a diamond, which he\r\nafterward stole from the thieves), and sentenced to three and a half\r\nyears in prison. And still the indictments came, with trials following\r\nfast. Al Smith resigned with the consent and thanks of the grand jury;\r\nhis chief, who was to run for the same office again, wanted to try the\r\nrest of the cases, and he did very well.\r\n\r\nAll men were now on the side of law and order. The panic among the\r\n“grafters” was laughable, in spite of its hideous significance. Two\r\nheads of departments against whom nothing had been shown suddenly ran\r\naway, and thus suggested to the grand jury an inquiry which revealed\r\nanother source of “graft,” in the sale of supplies to public\r\ninstitutions and the diversion of great quantities of provisions to the\r\nprivate residences of the mayor and other officials. Mayor Ames, under\r\nindictment and heavy bonds for extortion, conspiracy, and\r\nbribe-offering, left the State on a night train; a gentleman who knew\r\nhim by sight saw him sitting up at eleven o’clock in the smoking-room of\r\nthe sleeping-car, an unlighted cigar in his mouth, his face ashen and\r\ndrawn, and at six o’clock the next morning he still was sitting there,\r\nhis cigar still unlighted. He went to West Baden, a health resort in\r\nIndiana, a sick and broken man, aging years in a month. The city was\r\nwithout a mayor, the ring was without a leader; cliques ruled, and they\r\npictured one another hanging about the grand-jury room begging leave to\r\nturn State’s evidence. Tom Brown, the mayor’s secretary, was in the\r\nmayor’s chair; across the hall sat Fred Ames, the chief of police,\r\nbalancing Brown’s light weight. Both were busy forming cliques within\r\nthe ring. Brown had on his side Coffee John and Police Captain Hill.\r\nAmes had Captain “Norm” King (though he had been convicted and had\r\nresigned), Captain Krumweide, and Ernest Wheelock, the chief’s\r\nsecretary. Alderman D. Percy Jones, the president of the council, an\r\nhonorable man, should have taken the chair, but he was in the East; so\r\nthis unstable equilibrium was all the city had by way of a government.\r\n\r\nThen Fred Ames disappeared. The Tom Brown clique had full sway, and took\r\nover the police department. This was a shock to everybody, to none more\r\nthan to the King clique, which joined in the search for Ames. An\r\nalderman, Fred M. Powers, who was to run for mayor on the Republican\r\nticket, took charge of the mayor’s office, but he was not sure of his\r\nauthority or clear as to his policy. The grand jury was the real power\r\nbehind him, and the foreman was telegraphing for Alderman Jones.\r\nMeanwhile the cliques were making appeals to Mayor Ames, in West Baden,\r\nand each side that saw him received authority to do its will. The Coffee\r\nJohn clique, denied admission to the grand-jury room, turned to Alderman\r\nPowers, and were beginning to feel secure, when they heard that Fred\r\nAmes was coming back. They rushed around, and obtained an assurance from\r\nthe exiled mayor that Fred was returning only to resign. Fred—now under\r\nconviction—returned, but he did not resign; supported by his friends, he\r\ntook charge again of the police force. Coffee John besought Alderman\r\nPowers to remove the chief, and when the acting mayor proved himself too\r\ntimid, Coffee John, Tom Brown, and Captain Hill laid a deep plot. They\r\nwould ask Mayor Ames to remove his brother. This they felt sure they\r\ncould persuade the “old man” to do. The difficulty was to keep him from\r\nchanging his mind when the other side should reach his ear. They hit\r\nupon a bold expedient. They would urge the “old man” to remove Fred, and\r\nthen resign himself, so that he could not undo the deed that they wanted\r\ndone. Coffee John and Captain Hill slipped out of town one night; they\r\nreached West Baden on one train and they left for home on the next, with\r\na demand for Fred’s resignation in one hand and the mayor’s own in the\r\nother. Fred Ames did resign, and though the mayor’s resignation was laid\r\naside for a while, to avoid the expense of a special election, all\r\nlooked well for Coffee John and his clique. They had Fred out, and\r\nAlderman Powers was to make them great. But Mr. Powers wabbled. No doubt\r\nthe grand jury spoke to him. At any rate he turned most unexpectedly on\r\nboth cliques together. He turned out Tom Brown, but he turned out also\r\nCoffee John, and he did not make their man chief of police, but another\r\nof someone else’s selection. A number of resignations was the result,\r\nand these the acting mayor accepted, making a clearing of astonished\r\nrascals which was very gratifying to the grand jury and to the nervous\r\ncitizens of Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nBut the town was not yet easy. The grand jury, which was the actual head\r\nof the government, was about to be discharged, and, besides, their work\r\nwas destructive. A constructive force was now needed, and Alderman Jones\r\nwas pelted with telegrams from home bidding him hurry back. He did\r\nhurry, and when he arrived, the situation was instantly in control. The\r\ngrand jury prepared to report, for the city had a mind and a will of its\r\nown once more. The criminals found it out last.\r\n\r\nPercy Jones, as his friends call him, is of the second generation of his\r\nfamily in Minneapolis. His father started him well-to-do, and he went on\r\nfrom where he was started. College graduate and business man, he has a\r\nconscience which, however, he has brains enough to question. He is not\r\nthe fighter, but the slow, sure executive. As an alderman he is the\r\nresult of a movement begun several years ago by some young men who were\r\nconvinced by an exposure of a corrupt municipal council that they should\r\ngo into politics. A few did go in; Jones was one of these few.\r\n\r\nThe acting mayor was confronted at once with all the hardest problems of\r\nmunicipal government. Vice rose right up to tempt or to fight him. He\r\nstudied the situation deliberately, and by and by began to settle it\r\npoint by point, slowly but finally, against all sorts of opposition. One\r\nof his first acts was to remove all the proved rascals on the force,\r\nputting in their places men who had been removed by Mayor Ames. Another\r\nimportant step was the appointment of a church deacon and personal\r\nfriend to be chief of police, this on the theory that he wanted at the\r\nhead of his police a man who could have no sympathy with crime, a man\r\nwhom he could implicitly trust. Disorderly houses, forbidden by law,\r\nwere permitted, but only within certain patrol lines, and they were to\r\npay nothing, in either blackmail or “fines.” The number and the standing\r\nand the point of view of the “good people” who opposed this order was a\r\nlesson to Mr. Jones in practical government. One very prominent citizen\r\nand church member threatened him for driving women out of two flats\r\nowned by him; the rent was the surest means of “support for his wife and\r\nchildren.” Mr. Jones enforced his order.\r\n\r\nOther interests—saloon-keepers, brewers, etc.—gave him trouble enough,\r\nbut all these were trifles in comparison with his experience with the\r\ngamblers. They represented organized crime, and they asked for a\r\nhearing. Mr. Jones gave them some six weeks for negotiations. They\r\nproposed a solution. They said that if he would let them (a syndicate)\r\nopen four gambling places downtown, they would see that no others ran in\r\nany part of the city. Mr. Jones pondered and shook his head, drawing\r\nthem on. They went away, and came back with a better promise. Though\r\nthey were not the associates of criminals, they knew that class and\r\ntheir plans. No honest police force, unaided, could deal with crime.\r\nThieves would soon be at work again, and what could Mr. Jones do against\r\nthem with a police force headed by a church deacon? The gamblers offered\r\nto control the criminals for the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones, deeply interested, declared he did not believe there was any\r\ndanger of fresh crimes. The gamblers smiled and went away. By an odd\r\ncoincidence there happened just after that what the papers called “an\r\nepidemic of crime.” They were petty thefts, but they occupied the mind\r\nof the acting mayor. He wondered at their opportuneness. He wondered how\r\nthe news of them got out.\r\n\r\nThe gamblers soon reappeared. Hadn’t they told Mr. Jones crime would\r\nsoon be prevalent in town again? They had, indeed, but the mayor was\r\nunmoved; “porch climbers” could not frighten him. But this was only the\r\nbeginning, the gamblers said: the larger crimes would come next. And\r\nthey went away again. Sure enough, the large crimes came. One, two,\r\nthree burglaries of jewelry in the houses of well-known people occurred;\r\nthen there was a fourth, and the fourth was in the house of a relative\r\nof the acting mayor. He was seriously amused. The papers had the news\r\npromptly, and not from the police.\r\n\r\nThe gamblers called again. If they could have the exclusive control of\r\ngambling in Minneapolis, they would do all that they had promised\r\nbefore, and, if any large burglaries occurred, they would undertake to\r\nrecover the “swag,” and sometimes catch the thief. Mr. Jones was\r\nskeptical of their ability to do all this. The gamblers offered to prove\r\nit. How? They would get back for Mr. Jones the jewelry recently reported\r\nstolen from four houses in town. Mr. Jones expressed a curiosity to see\r\nthis done, and the gamblers went away. After a few days the stolen\r\njewelry, parcel by parcel, began to return; with all due police-criminal\r\nmystery it was delivered to the chief of police.\r\n\r\nWhen the gamblers called again, they found the acting mayor ready to\r\ngive his decision on their propositions. It was this: There should be no\r\ngambling, with police connivance, in the city of Minneapolis during his\r\nterm of office.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones told me that if he had before him a long term, he certainly\r\nwould reconsider this answer. He believed he would decide again as he\r\nhad already, but he would at least give studious reflection to the\r\nquestion—Can a city be governed without any alliance with crime? It was\r\nan open question. He had closed it only for the four months of his\r\nemergency administration. Minneapolis should be clean and sweet for a\r\nlittle while at least, and the new administration should begin with a\r\nclear deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE SHAMELESSNESS OF ST. LOUIS\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_March, 1903_)\r\n\r\nTweed’s classic question, “What are you going to do about it?” is the\r\nmost humiliating challenge ever delivered by the One Man to the Many.\r\nBut it was pertinent. It was the question then; it is the question now.\r\nWill the people rule? That is what it means. Is democracy possible? The\r\naccounts of financial corruption in St. Louis and of police corruption\r\nin Minneapolis raised the same question. They were inquiries into\r\nAmerican municipal democracy, and, so far as they went, they were pretty\r\ncomplete answers. The people wouldn’t rule. They would have flown to\r\narms to resist a czar or a king, but they let a “mucker” oppress and\r\ndisgrace and sell them out. “Neglect,” so they describe their impotence.\r\nBut when their shame was laid bare, what did they do then? That is what\r\nTweed, the tyrant, wanted to know, and that is what the democracy of\r\nthis country needs to know.\r\n\r\nMinneapolis answered Tweed. With Mayor Ames a fugitive, the city was\r\nreformed, and when he was brought back he was tried and convicted. No\r\ncity ever profited so promptly by the lesson of its shame. The people\r\nhad nothing to do with the exposure—that was an accident—nor with the\r\nreconstruction. Hovey C. Clarke, who attacked the Ames ring, tore it all\r\nto pieces; and D. Percy Jones, who re-established the city government,\r\nbuilt a well-nigh perfect thing. There was little left for the people to\r\ndo but choose at the next regular election between two candidates for\r\nmayor, one obviously better than the other, but that they did do. They\r\nscratched some ten thousand ballots to do their small part decisively\r\nand well. So much by way of revolt. The future will bring Minneapolis up\r\nto the real test. The men who saved the city this time have organized to\r\nkeep it safe, and make the memory of “Doc” Ames a civic treasure, and\r\nMinneapolis a city without reproach.\r\n\r\nMinneapolis may fail, as New York has failed; but at least these two\r\ncities could be moved by shame. Not so St. Louis. Joseph W. Folk, the\r\nCircuit Attorney, who began alone, is going right on alone, indicting,\r\ntrying, convicting boodlers, high and low, following the workings of the\r\ncombine through all of its startling ramifications, and spreading before\r\nthe people, in the form of testimony given under oath, the confessions\r\nby the boodlers themselves of the whole wretched story. St. Louis is\r\nunmoved and unashamed. St. Louis seems to me to be something new in the\r\nhistory of the government of the people, by the rascals, for the rich.\r\n\r\n“Tweed Days in St. Louis” did not tell half that the St. Louisans know\r\nof the condition of the city. That article described how in 1898, 1899,\r\nand 1900, under the administration of Mayor Ziegenhein, boodling\r\ndeveloped into the only real business of the city government. Since that\r\narticle was written, fourteen men have been tried, and half a score have\r\nconfessed, so that some measure of the magnitude of the business and of\r\nthe importance of the interests concerned has been given. Then it was\r\nrelated that “combines” of municipal legislators sold rights,\r\nprivileges, and public franchises for their own individual profit, and\r\nat regular schedule rates. Now the free narratives of convicted boodlers\r\nhave developed the inside history of the combines, with their\r\nunfulfilled plans. Then we understood that these combines did the\r\nboodling. Now we know that they had a leader, a boss, who, a rich man\r\nhimself, represented the financial district and prompted the boodling\r\ntill the system burst. We knew then how Mr. Folk, a man little known,\r\nwas nominated against his will for Circuit Attorney; how he warned the\r\npoliticians who named him; how he proceeded against these same men as\r\nagainst ordinary criminals. Now we have these men convicted.\r\n\r\nWe saw Charles H. Turner, the president of the Suburban Railway Co., and\r\nPhilip H. Stock, the secretary of the St. Louis Brewing Co., the first\r\nto “peach,” telling to the grand jury the story of their bribe fund of\r\n$144,000, put into safe-deposit vaults, to be paid to the legislators\r\nwhen the Suburban franchise was granted. St. Louis has seen these two\r\nmen dashing forth “like fire horses,” the one (Mr. Turner) from the\r\npresidency of the Commonwealth Trust Company, the other from his brewing\r\ncompany secretaryship, to recite again and again in the criminal courts\r\ntheir miserable story, and count over and over for the jury the dirty\r\nbills of that bribe fund. And when they had given their testimony, and\r\nthe boodlers one after another were convicted, these witnesses have\r\nhurried back to their places of business and the convicts to their seats\r\nin the municipal assembly. This is literally true. In the House of\r\nDelegates sit, under sentence, as follows: Charles F. Kelly, two years;\r\nCharles J. Denny, three years and five years; Henry A. Faulkner, two\r\nyears; E. E. Murrell, State’s witness, but not tried.[1] Nay, this\r\nHouse, with such a membership, had the audacity last fall to refuse to\r\npass an appropriation to enable Mr. Folk to go on with his investigation\r\nand prosecution of boodling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  See _Post Scriptum_, end of chapter.\r\n\r\nRight here is the point. In other cities mere exposure has been\r\nsufficient to overthrow a corrupt régime. In St. Louis the conviction of\r\nthe boodlers leaves the felons in control, the system intact, and the\r\npeople—spectators. It is these people who are interesting—these people,\r\nand the system they have made possible.\r\n\r\nThe convicted boodlers have described the system to me. There was no\r\npolitics in it—only business. The city of St. Louis is normally\r\nRepublican. Founded on the home-rule principle, the corporation is a\r\ndistinct political entity, with no county to confuse it. The State of\r\nMissouri, however, is normally Democratic, and the legislature has taken\r\npolitical possession of the city by giving to the Governor the\r\nappointment of the Police and Election Boards. With a defective election\r\nlaw, the Democratic boss in the city became its absolute ruler.\r\n\r\nThis boss is Edward R. Butler, better known as “Colonel Ed,” or “Colonel\r\nButler,” or just “Boss.” He is an Irishman by birth, a master horseshoer\r\nby trade, a good fellow—by nature, at first, then by profession. Along\r\nin the seventies, when he still wore the apron of his trade, and bossed\r\nhis tough ward, he secured the agency for a certain patent horseshoe\r\nwhich the city railways liked and bought. Useful also as a politician,\r\nthey gave him a blanket contract to keep all their mules and horses\r\nshod. Butler’s farrieries glowed all about the town, and his political\r\ninfluence spread with his business; for everywhere big Ed Butler went\r\nthere went a smile also, and encouragement for your weakness, no matter\r\nwhat it was. Like “Doc” Ames, of Minneapolis—like the “good fellow”\r\neverywhere—Butler won men by helping them to wreck themselves. A priest,\r\nthe Rev. James Coffey, once denounced Butler from the pulpit as a\r\ncorrupter of youth; at another time a mother knelt in the aisle of a\r\nchurch, and during service audibly called upon Heaven for a visitation\r\nof affliction upon Butler for having ruined her son. These and similar\r\nincidents increased his power by advertising it. He grew bolder. He has\r\nbeen known to walk out of a voting-place and call across a cordon of\r\npolice to a group of men at the curb, “Are there any more repeaters out\r\nhere that want to vote again?”\r\n\r\nThey will tell you in St. Louis that Butler never did have much real\r\npower, that his boldness and the clamor against him made him seem great.\r\nPublic protest is part of the power of every boss. So far, however, as I\r\ncan gather, Butler was the leader of his organization, but only so long\r\nas he was a partisan politician; as he became a “boodler” pure and\r\nsimple, he grew careless about his machine, and did his boodle business\r\nwith the aid of the worst element of both parties. At any rate, the\r\nboodlers, and others as well, say that in later years he had about equal\r\npower with both parties, and he certainly was the ruler of St. Louis\r\nduring the Republican administration of Ziegenhein, which was the worst\r\nin the history of the city. His method was to dictate enough of the\r\ncandidates on both tickets to enable him, by selecting the worst from\r\neach, to elect the sort of men he required in his business. In other\r\nwords, while honest Democrats and Republicans were “loyal to party” (a\r\npoint of great pride with the idiots) and “voted straight,” the\r\nDemocratic boss and his Republican lieutenants decided what part of each\r\nticket should be elected; then they sent around Butler’s “Indians”\r\n(repeaters) by the vanload to scratch ballots and “repeat” their votes,\r\ntill the worst had made sure of the government by the worst, and Butler\r\nwas in a position to do business.\r\n\r\nHis business was boodling, which is a more refined and a more dangerous\r\nform of corruption than the police blackmail of Minneapolis. It\r\ninvolves, not thieves, gamblers, and common women, but influential\r\ncitizens, capitalists, and great corporations. For the stock-in-trade of\r\nthe boodler is the rights, privileges, franchises, and real property of\r\nthe city, and his source of corruption is the top, not the bottom, of\r\nsociety. Butler, thrown early in his career into contact with\r\ncorporation managers, proved so useful to them that they introduced him\r\nto other financiers, and the scandal of his services attracted to him in\r\ndue course all men who wanted things the city had to give. The boodlers\r\ntold me that, according to the tradition of their combine, there “always\r\nwas boodling in St. Louis.”\r\n\r\nButler organized and systematized and developed it into a regular\r\nfinancial institution, and made it an integral part of the business\r\ncommunity. He had for clients, regular or occasional, bankers and\r\npromoters; and the statements of boodlers, not yet on record, allege\r\nthat every transportation and public convenience company that touches\r\nSt. Louis had dealings with Butler’s combine. And my best information is\r\nthat these interests were not victims. Blackmail came in time, but in\r\nthe beginning they originated the schemes of loot and started Butler on\r\nhis career. Some interests paid him a regular salary, others a fee, and\r\nagain he was a partner in the enterprise, with a special “rake-off” for\r\nhis influence. “Fee” and “present” are his terms, and he has spoken\r\nopenly of taking and giving them. I verily believe he regarded his\r\ncharges as legitimate (he is the Croker type); but he knew that some\r\npeople thought his services wrong. He once said that, when he had\r\nreceived his fee for a piece of legislation, he “went home and prayed\r\nthat the measure might pass,” and, he added facetiously, that “usually\r\nhis prayers were answered.”\r\n\r\nHis prayers were “usually answered” by the Municipal Assembly. This\r\nlegislative body is divided into two houses—the upper, called the\r\nCouncil, consisting of thirteen members, elected at large; the lower,\r\ncalled the House of Delegates, with twenty-eight members, elected by\r\nwards; and each member of these bodies is paid twenty-five dollars a\r\nmonth salary by the city. With the mayor, this Assembly has practically\r\ncomplete control of all public property and valuable rights. Though\r\nButler sometimes could rent or own the mayor, he preferred to be\r\nindependent of him, so he formed in each part of the legislature a\r\ntwo-thirds majority—in the Council nine, in the House nineteen—which\r\ncould pass bills over a veto. These were the “combines.” They were\r\nregularly organized, and did their business under parliamentary rules.\r\nEach “combine” elected its chairman, who was elected chairman also of\r\nthe legal bodies where he appointed the committees, naming to each a\r\nmajority of combine members.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of the combines, Butler’s control was complete,\r\nbecause it was political. He picked the men who were to be legislators;\r\nthey did as he bade them do, and the boodling was noiseless, safe, and\r\nmoderate in price. Only wrongful acts were charged for, and a right once\r\nsold was good; for Butler kept his word. The definition of an honest man\r\nas one who will stay bought, fitted him. But it takes a very strong man\r\nto control himself and others when the money lust grows big, and it\r\ncertainly grew big in St. Louis. Butler used to watch the downtown\r\ndistricts. He knew everybody, and when a railroad wanted a switch, or a\r\nfinancial house a franchise, Butler learned of it early. Sometimes he\r\ndiscovered the need and suggested it. Naming the regular price, say\r\n$10,000, he would tell the “boys” what was coming, and that there would\r\nbe $1,000 to divide. He kept the rest, and the city got nothing. The\r\nbill was introduced and held up till Butler gave the word that the money\r\nwas in hand; then it passed. As the business grew, however, not only\r\nillegitimate, but legitimate permissions were charged for, and at\r\ngradually increasing rates. Citizens who asked leave to make excavations\r\nin streets for any purpose, neighborhoods that had to have street\r\nlamps—all had to pay, and they did pay. In later years there was no\r\nother way. Business men who complained felt a certain pressure brought\r\nto bear on them from most unexpected quarters downtown.\r\n\r\nA business man told me that a railroad which had a branch near his\r\nfactory suggested that he go to the Municipal Legislature and get\r\npermission to have a switch run into his yard. He liked the idea, but\r\nwhen he found it would cost him eight or ten thousand dollars, he gave\r\nit up. Then the railroad became slow about handling his freight. He\r\nunderstood, and, being a fighter, he ferried the goods across the river\r\nto another road. That brought him the switch; and when he asked about\r\nit, the railroad man said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, we got it done. You see, we pay a regular salary to some of those\r\nfellows, and they did it for us for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then why in the deuce did you send me to them?” asked the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” was the answer, “we like to keep in with them, and when\r\nwe can throw them a little outside business we do.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, a great railway corporation, not content with paying\r\nbribe salaries to these boodle aldermen, was ready, further to oblige\r\nthem, to help coerce a manufacturer and a customer to go also and be\r\nblackmailed by the boodlers. “How can you buck a game like that?” this\r\nman asked me.\r\n\r\nVery few tried to. Blackmail was all in the ordinary course of business,\r\nand the habit of submission became fixed—a habit of mind. The city\r\nitself was kept in darkness for weeks, pending the payment of $175,000\r\nin bribes on the lighting contract, and complaining citizens went for\r\nlight where Mayor Ziegenhein told them to go—to the moon.\r\n\r\nBoodling was safe, and boodling was fat. Butler became rich and greedy,\r\nand neglectful of politics. Outside capital came in, and finding Butler\r\nbought, went over his head to the boodle combines. These creatures\r\nlearned thus the value of franchises, and that Butler had been giving\r\nthem an unduly small share of the boodle.\r\n\r\nThen began a struggle, enormous in its vile melodrama, for control of\r\ncorruption—Butler to squeeze the municipal legislators and save his\r\nprofits, they to wring from him their “fair share.” Combines were formed\r\nwithin the old combines to make him pay more; and although he still was\r\nthe legislative agent of the inner ring, he had to keep in his secret\r\npay men who would argue for low rates, while the combine members,\r\nsuspicious of one another, appointed their own legislative agent to meet\r\nButler. Not sure even then, the cliques appointed “trailers” to follow\r\ntheir agent, watch him enter Butler’s house, and then follow him to the\r\nplace where the money was to be distributed. Charles A. Gutke and John\r\nK. Murrell represented Butler in the House of Delegates, Charles Kratz\r\nand Fred G. Uthoff in the Council. The other members suspected that\r\nthese men got “something big on the side,” so Butler had to hire a third\r\nto betray the combine to him. In the House, Robertson was the man. When\r\nGutke had notified the chairman that a deal was on, and a meeting was\r\ncalled, the chairman would say:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, the business before us to-night is [say] the Suburban\r\nRailway Bill. How much shall we ask for it?”\r\n\r\nGutke would move that “the price be $40,000.” Some member of the outer\r\nring would move $100,000 as fair boodle. The debate often waxed hot, and\r\nyou hear of the drawing of revolvers. In this case (of the Suburban\r\nRailway) Robertson rose and moved a compromise of $75,000, urging\r\nmoderation, lest they get nothing, and his price was carried. Then they\r\nwould lobby over the appointment of the agent. They did not want Gutke,\r\nor anyone Butler owned, so they chose some other; and having adjourned,\r\nthe outer ring would send a “trailer” to watch the agent, and sometimes\r\na second “trailer” to watch the first.\r\n\r\nThey began to work up business on their own account, and, all decency\r\ngone, they sold out sometimes to both sides of a fight. The Central\r\nTraction deal in 1898 was an instance of this. Robert M. Snyder, a\r\ncapitalist and promoter, of New York and Kansas City, came into St.\r\nLouis with a traction proposition inimical to the city railway\r\ninterests. These felt secure. Through Butler they were paying seven\r\nmembers of the Council $5,000 a year each, but as a precaution John\r\nScullin, Butler’s associate, and one of the ablest capitalists of St.\r\nLouis, paid Councilman Uthoff a special retainer of $25,000 to watch the\r\nsalaried boodlers. When Snyder found Butler and the combines against\r\nhim, he set about buying the members individually, and, opening wine at\r\nhis headquarters, began bidding for votes. This was the first break from\r\nButler in a big deal, and caused great agitation among the boodlers.\r\nThey did not go right over to Snyder; they saw Butler, and with Snyder’s\r\nvaluation of the franchise before them, made the boss go up to $175,000.\r\nThen the Council combine called a meeting in Gast’s Garden to see if\r\nthey could not agree on a price. Butler sent Uthoff there with\r\ninstructions to cause a disagreement, or fix a price so high that Snyder\r\nwould refuse to pay it. Uthoff obeyed, and, suggesting $250,000,\r\npersuaded some members to hold out for it, till the meeting broke up in\r\na row. Then it was each man for himself, and all hurried to see Butler,\r\nand to see Snyder too. In the scramble various prices were paid. Four\r\ncouncilmen got from Snyder $10,000 each, one got $15,000, another\r\n$17,500, and one $50,000; twenty-five members of the House of Delegates\r\ngot $3,000 each from him. In all, Snyder paid $250,000 for the\r\nfranchise, and since Butler and his backers paid only $175,000 to beat\r\nit, the franchise was passed. Snyder turned around and sold it to his\r\nold opponents for $1,250,000. It was worth twice as much.\r\n\r\nThe man who received $50,000 from Snyder was the same Uthoff who had\r\ntaken $25,000 from John Scullin, and his story as he has told it since\r\non the stand is the most comical incident of the exposure. He says\r\nSnyder, with his “overcoat full of money,” came out to his house to see\r\nhim. They sat together on a sofa, and when Snyder was gone Uthoff found\r\nbeside him a parcel containing $50,000. This he returned to the\r\npromoter, with the statement that he could not accept it, since he had\r\nalready taken $25,000 from the other side; but he intimated that he\r\ncould take $100,000. This Snyder promised, so Uthoff voted for the\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\nThe next day Butler called at Uthoff’s house. Uthoff spoke first.\r\n\r\n“I want to return this,” he said, handing Butler the package of $25,000.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I came after,” said Butler.\r\n\r\nWhen Uthoff told this in the trial of Snyder, Snyder’s counsel asked why\r\nhe returned this $25,000.\r\n\r\n“Because it wasn’t mine,” exclaimed Uthoff, flushing with anger. “I\r\nhadn’t earned it.”\r\n\r\nBut he believed he had earned the $100,000, and he besought Snyder for\r\nthat sum, or, anyway, the $50,000. Snyder made him drink, and gave him\r\njust $5,000, taking by way of receipt a signed statement that the\r\nreports of bribery in connection with the Central Traction deal were\r\nutterly false; that “I [Uthoff] know you [Snyder] to be as far above\r\noffering a bribe as I am of taking one.”\r\n\r\nIrregular as all this was, however, the legislators kept up a pretense\r\nof partisanship and decency. In the debates arranged for in the combine\r\ncaucus, a member or two were told off to make partisan speeches.\r\nSometimes they were instructed to attack the combine, and one or two of\r\nthe rascals used to take delight in arraigning their friends on the\r\nfloor of the House, charging them with the exact facts.\r\n\r\nBut for the serious work no one knew his party. Butler had with him\r\nRepublicans and Democrats, and there were Republicans and Democrats\r\namong those against him. He could trust none not in his special pay. He\r\nwas the chief boodle broker and the legislature’s best client; his\r\npolitical influence began to depend upon his boodling instead of the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nHe is a millionaire two or three times over now, but it is related that\r\nto someone who advised him to quit in time he replied that it wasn’t a\r\nmatter of money alone with him; he liked the business, and would rather\r\nmake fifty dollars out of a switch than $500 in stocks. He enjoyed\r\nbuying franchises cheap and selling them dear. In the lighting deal of\r\n1899 Butler received $150,000, and paid out only $85,000—$47,500 to the\r\nHouse, $37,500 to the Council—and the haggling with the House combine\r\ncaused those weeks of total darkness in the city. He had Gutke tell this\r\ncombine that he could divide only $20,000 among them. They voted the\r\nmeasure, but, suspecting Butler of “holding out on them,” moved to\r\nreconsider.\r\n\r\nThe citizens were furious, and a crowd went with ropes to the City Hall\r\nthe night the motion to reconsider came up; but the combine was\r\ndetermined. Butler was there in person. He was more frightened than the\r\ndelegates, and the sweat rolled down his face as he bargained with them.\r\nWith the whole crowd looking on, and reporters so near that a delegate\r\ntold me he expected to see the conversation in the papers the next\r\nmorning, Butler threatened and pleaded, but finally promised to divide\r\n$47,500. That was an occasion for a burst of eloquence. The orators,\r\nindicating the citizens with ropes, declared that since it was plain the\r\npeople wanted light, they would vote them light. And no doubt the people\r\nthought they had won, for it was not known till much later that the\r\nvotes were bought by Butler, and that the citizens only hastened a\r\ncorrupt bargain.\r\n\r\nThe next big boodle measure that Butler missed was the Suburban\r\nTraction, the same that led long after to disaster. This is the story\r\nTurner and Stock have been telling over and over in the boodle trials.\r\nTurner and his friends in the St. Louis Suburban Railway Company sought\r\na franchise, for which they were willing to pay large bribes. Turner\r\nspoke about it to Butler, who said it would cost $145,000. This seemed\r\ntoo much, and Turner asked Stock to lobby the measure through. Stock\r\nmanaged it, but it cost him $144,000—$135,000 for the combine, $9,000\r\nextra for Meysenburg—and then, before the money was paid over and the\r\ncompany in possession of its privilege, an injunction put a stop to all\r\nproceedings. The money was in safe-deposit vaults—$75,000 for the House\r\ncombine in one, $60,000 for the Council combine in the other—and when\r\nthe legislature adjourned, a long fight for the money ensued. Butler\r\nchuckled over the bungling. He is said to have drawn from it the lesson\r\nthat “when you want a franchise, don’t go to a novice for it; pay an\r\nexpert, and he’ll deliver the goods.”\r\n\r\nBut the combine drew their own conclusions from it, and their moral was,\r\nthat though boodling was a business by itself, it was a good business,\r\nand so easy that anybody could learn it by study. And study it they did.\r\nTwo of them told me repeatedly that they traveled about the country\r\nlooking up the business, and that a fellowship had grown up among\r\nboodling alderman of the leading cities in the United States. Committees\r\nfrom Chicago would come to St. Louis to find out what “new games” the\r\nSt. Louis boodlers had, and they gave the St. Louisans hints as to how\r\nthey “did the business” in Chicago. So the Chicago and St. Louis\r\nboodlers used to visit Cleveland and Pittsburg and all the other cities,\r\nor, if the distance was too great, they got their ideas by those\r\nmysterious channels which run all through the “World of Graft.” The\r\nmeeting place in St. Louis was Decker’s stable, and ideas unfolded there\r\nwere developed into plans which, the boodlers say to-day, are only in\r\nabeyance. In Decker’s stable the idea was born to sell the Union Market;\r\nand though the deal did not go through, the boodlers, when they saw it\r\nfailing, made the market men pay $10,000 for killing it. This scheme is\r\nlaid aside for the future. Another that failed was to sell the\r\ncourt-house, and this was well under way when it was discovered that the\r\nground on which this public building stands was given to the city on\r\ncondition that it was to be used for a court-house and nothing else.\r\n\r\nBut the grandest idea of all came from Philadelphia. In that city the\r\ngas-works were sold out to a private concern, and the water-works were\r\nto be sold next. The St. Louis fellows have been trying ever since to\r\nfind a purchaser for their water-works. The plant is worth at least\r\n$40,000,000. But the boodlers thought they could let it go at\r\n$15,000,000, and get $1,000,000 or so themselves for the bargain. “The\r\nscheme was to do it and skip,” said one of the boodlers who told me\r\nabout it, “and if you could mix it all up with some filtering scheme it\r\ncould be done; only some of us thought we could make more than\r\n$1,000,000 out of it—a fortune apiece. It will be done some day.”\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the boodling system as we see it in St. Louis. Everything\r\nthe city owned was for sale by the officers elected by the people. The\r\npurchasers might be willing or unwilling takers; they might be citizens\r\nor outsiders; it was all one to the city government. So long as the\r\nmembers of the combines got the proceeds they would sell out the town.\r\nWould? They did and they will. If a city treasurer runs away with\r\n$50,000 there is a great halloo about it. In St. Louis the regularly\r\norganized thieves who rule have sold $50,000,000 worth of franchises and\r\nother valuable municipal assets. This is the estimate made for me by a\r\nbanker, who said that the boodlers got not one-tenth of the value of the\r\nthings they sold, but were content because they got it all themselves.\r\nAnd as to the future, my boodling informants said that all the\r\npossessions of the city were listed for future sale, that the list was\r\nin existence, and that the sale of these properties was only postponed\r\non account of accident—the occurrence of Mr. Folk.\r\n\r\nPreposterous? It certainly would seem so; but watch the people of St.\r\nLouis as I have, and as the boodlers have—then judge.\r\n\r\nAnd remember, first, that Mr. Folk really was an accident. St. Louis\r\nknew in a general way, as other cities to-day know, what was going on,\r\nbut there was no popular movement. Politicians named and elected him,\r\nand they expected no trouble from him. The moment he took office, on\r\nJanuary 1, 1901, Butler called on him to appoint an organization man\r\nfirst assistant. When Folk refused, Butler could not understand it.\r\nGoing away angry, he was back in three days to have his man appointed\r\nsecond assistant. The refusal of this also had some effect. The boodlers\r\nsay Butler came out and bade them “look out; I can’t do anything with\r\nFolk, and I wouldn’t wonder if he got after you.” They took the warning;\r\nButler did not. It seems never to have occurred to him that Mr. Folk\r\nwould “get after” _him_.\r\n\r\nWhat Butler felt, the public felt. When Mr. Folk took up, as he did\r\nimmediately, election fraud cases, Butler called on him again, and told\r\nhim which men he might not prosecute in earnest. The town laughed. When\r\nButler was sent about his business, and Folk proceeded in earnest\r\nagainst the repeaters of both parties, even those who “had helped elect\r\nhim,” there was a sensation. But the stir was due to the novelty and the\r\nincomprehensibility of such non-partisan conduct in public office.\r\nIncredulous of honesty, St. Louis manifested the first signs of that\r\nfaith in evil which is so characteristic of it. “Why didn’t Mr. Folk\r\ntake up boodling?” was the cynical challenge. “What do a few miserable\r\nrepeaters amount to?”\r\n\r\nMr. Folk is a man of remarkable equanimity. When he has laid a course,\r\nhe steers by it truly, and nothing can excite or divert him. He had said\r\nhe would “do his duty,” not that he would expose corruption or reform\r\nSt. Louis; and beyond watching developments, he did nothing for a year\r\nto answer the public challenge. But he was making preparations. A civil\r\nlawyer, he was studying criminal law; and when, on January 23, 1902, he\r\nsaw in the St. Louis _Star_ a paragraph about the Suburban bribe fund in\r\nbank, he was ready. He sent out summonses by the wholesale for bankers,\r\nSuburban Railway officials and directors, legislators and politicians,\r\nand before the grand jury he examined them by the hour for days and\r\ndays. Nobody knew anything; and though Mr. Folk was known to be “after\r\nthe boodlers,” those fellows and their friends were not alarmed and the\r\npublic was not satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Get indictments,” was the challenge now. It was a “bluff”; but Mr. Folk\r\ntook it up, and by a “bluff” he “got an indictment.” And this is the way\r\nof it: the old row between the Suburban people and the boodle combine\r\nwas going on in secret, but in a very bitter spirit. The money, lying in\r\nthe safe-deposit vaults, in cash, was claimed by both parties. The\r\nboodlers said it was theirs because they had done their part by voting\r\nthe franchise; the Suburban people said it was theirs because they had\r\nnot obtained the franchise. The boodlers answered that the injunction\r\nagainst the franchise was not theirs, and they threatened to take the\r\ndispute before the grand jury. It was they who gave to a reporter a\r\nparagraph about the “boodle fund,” and they meant to have it scare\r\nTurner and Stock. Stock really was “scared.” When Mr. Folk’s summons was\r\nserved on him, he believed the boodlers had “squealed,” and he fainted.\r\nThe deputy who saw the effect of the summons told Mr. Folk, who, seeing\r\nin it only evidence of weakness and guilt, sent for the lawyer who\r\nrepresented Stock and Turner, and boldly gave him the choice for his\r\nclients of being witnesses or defendants. The lawyer was firm, but Folk\r\nadvised him to consult his clients, and their choice was to be\r\nwitnesses. Their confession and the seizure of the bribe fund in escrow\r\ngave Folk the whole inside story of the Suburban deal, and evidence in\r\nplenty for indictments. He took seven, and the reputation and standing\r\nof the first culprits showed right away not only the fearlessness of the\r\nprosecution, but the variety and power and wealth of the St. Louis\r\nspecies of boodler. There was Charles Kratz, agent of the Council\r\ncombine; John K. Murrell, agent of the House combine; Emil A.\r\nMeysenburg, councilman and “good citizen”—all for taking bribes; Ellis\r\nWainwright and Henry Nicolaus, millionaire brewers, and directors of the\r\nSuburban Railway Company for bribery; and Julius Lehmann and Henry A.\r\nFaulkner, of the House combine, for perjury. This news caused\r\nconsternation; but the ring rallied, held together, and the cynics said,\r\n“They never will be tried.”\r\n\r\nThe outlook was stormy. Mr. Folk felt now in full force the powerful\r\ninterests that opposed him. The standing of some of the prisoners was\r\none thing; another was the character of the men who went on their bail\r\nbond—Butler for the bribe takers, other millionaires for the bribers.\r\nBut most serious was the flow of persons who went to Mr. Folk privately\r\nand besought or bade him desist; they were not alone politicians, but\r\nsolid, innocent business men, eminent lawyers, and good friends. Hardly\r\na man he knew but came to him at one time or another, in one way or\r\nanother, to plead for some rascal or other. Threats of assassination and\r\npolitical ruin, offers of political promotion and of remunerative and\r\nlegitimate partnerships, veiled bribes—everything he might fear was held\r\nup on one side, everything he might want on the other. “When you are\r\ndoing a thing like this,” he says now, “you cannot listen to anybody;\r\nyou have to think for yourself and rely on yourself alone. I knew I\r\nsimply had to succeed; and, success or failure, I felt that a political\r\nfuture was not to be considered, so I shut out all idea of it.”\r\n\r\nSo he went on silently but surely; how surely may be inferred from the\r\nfact that in all his dealings with witnesses who turned State’s evidence\r\nhe has not made one misstep; there have been no misunderstandings, and\r\nno charges against him of foul play. While the pressure from behind\r\nnever ceased, and the defiance before him was bold, “Go higher up” was\r\nthe challenge. He was going higher up. With confessions of Turner and\r\nStock, and the indictments for perjury for examples, he re-examined\r\nwitnesses; and though the big men were furnishing the little boodlers\r\nwith legal advice and drilling them in their stories, there were breaks\r\nhere and there. The story of the Central Traction deal began to develop,\r\nand that went higher up, straight into the group of millionaires led by\r\nButler.\r\n\r\nBut there was an impassable barrier in the law on bribery. American\r\nlegislators do not legislate harshly against their chief vice. The State\r\nof Missouri limits the liability of a briber to three years, and the\r\nTraction deal was outlawed for most of the principals in it. But the law\r\nexcepted non-residents, and Mr. Folk found that in moments of vanity\r\nRobert M. Snyder had described himself as “of New York,” so he had\r\nSnyder indicted for bribery, and George J. Kobusch, president of the St.\r\nLouis Car Company, for perjury, Kobusch having sworn that he knew of no\r\nbribery for the Central Traction franchise, when he himself had paid out\r\nmoney. Kobusch turned State’s witness against Snyder.\r\n\r\nHigh as these indictments were, the cry for Butler persisted, and the\r\nskeptical tone of it made it plain that to break up the ring Mr. Folk\r\nhad to catch the boss. And he did catch him. Saved by missing the\r\nSuburban business, saved by the law in the Central Traction affair,\r\nButler lost by his temerity; he went on boodling after Mr. Folk was in\r\noffice. He offered “presents” of $2,500 each to the two medical members\r\nof the Health Board for their approval of a garbage contract which was\r\nto net him $232,500. So the “Old Man,” the head of the boodlers, and the\r\nlegislative agent of the financial district, was indicted.\r\n\r\nBut the ring did not part, and the public faith in evil remained\r\nsteadfast. No one had been tried. The trials were approaching, and the\r\nunderstanding was that the first of them was to be made a test. A defeat\r\nmight stop Mr. Folk, and he realized the moral effect such a result\r\nwould have. But he was sure of his cases against Murrell and Kratz, and\r\nif he convicted them the way was open to both combines and to the big\r\nmen behind them. To all appearances these men also were confident, and\r\nwith the lawyers engaged for them they might well have been. Suddenly it\r\nwas decided that Murrell was weak, and might “cave.” He ran away. The\r\nshock of this to the community is hard to realize now. It was the first\r\npublic proof of guilt, and the first break in the ring of little\r\nboodlers. To Mr. Folk it was the first serious check, for he could not\r\nnow indict the House combine. Then, too, Kratz was in Florida, and the\r\nCircuit Attorney saw himself going into court with the weakest of his\r\nearly cases, that of Meysenburg. In genuine alarm he moved heavy\r\nincreases in the bail bonds. All the lawyers in all the cases combined\r\nto defeat this move, and the fight lasted for days; but Mr. Folk won.\r\nKratz returned in a rage to find bail. With his connections and his\r\nproperty he could give any amount, he boasted, and he offered $100,000.\r\nIn spite of the protest of the counsel engaged for him, he insisted upon\r\nfurnishing $20,000, and he denounced the effort to discredit him with\r\nthe insinuation that such as he would avoid trial. He even asked to be\r\ntried first, but wiser heads on his side chose the Meysenburg case.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this case lay in the indirection of the bribe.\r\nMeysenburg, a business man of repute, took for his vote on the Suburban\r\nfranchise, not money; he sold for $9,000 some two hundred shares of\r\nworthless stock. This might be made to look like a regular business\r\ntransaction, and half a dozen of the best lawyers in the State appeared\r\nto press that view. Mr. Folk, however, met these lawyers point by point,\r\nand point by point he beat them all, displaying a knowledge of law which\r\nastounded them, and an attitude toward the prisoner which won the jury,\r\nand might well reform the methods of haranguing prosecutors all over\r\nthis country. Naturally without malice, he is impersonal; he did not\r\nattack the prisoner. He was not there for that purpose. He was defending\r\nthe State, not prosecuting the individual. “The defendant is a mere\r\natom,” he tells his juries; “if we could enforce the law without\r\npunishing individuals, we should not be here; but we cannot. Only by\r\nmaking an example of the criminal can we prevent crime. And as to the\r\nprisoner, he cannot complain, because his own deeds are his doomsmen.”\r\nAt one stage of the Faulkner trial, when ex-Governor Johnson was talking\r\nabout the rights of the prisoner, Mr. Folk remarked that the State had\r\nrights also. “Oh, d—— the rights of the State!” was the retort, and the\r\njury heard it. Many juries have heard this view. One of the permanent\r\nservices Mr. Folk has rendered is to impress upon the minds, not only of\r\njuries, but of the people generally, and in particular upon the Courts\r\nof Appeal (which often forget it), that while the criminal law has been\r\ndeveloped into a great machine to preserve the rights, and much more, of\r\nthe criminal, the rights of the State also should be guarded.\r\n\r\nMeysenburg was found guilty and sentenced to three years. The man was\r\nshocked limp, and the ring broke. Kratz ran away. He was advised to go,\r\nand, like Murrell, he had promises of plenty of money; unlike Murrell,\r\nhowever, Kratz stood on the order of his going. He made the big fellows\r\ngive him a large sum of cash, and for the fulfillment of their promise\r\nof more he waited menacingly in New Orleans. Supplied there with all he\r\ndemanded, this Council leader stepped across into Mexico, and has gone\r\ninto business there on a large scale. With Kratz safely away, the ring\r\nwas nerved up again, and Meysenburg appeared in court with five\r\nwell-known millionaires to give an appeal bond of $25,000. “I could have\r\ngot more,” he told the reporters, “but I guess that’s enough.”\r\n\r\nWith the way to both boodle combines closed thus by the flight of their\r\ngo-betweens, Mr. Folk might well have been stayed; but he wasn’t. He\r\nproceeded with his examination of witnesses, and to loosen their tongues\r\nhe brought on the trials of Lehmann and Faulkner for perjury. They were\r\nwell defended, but against them appeared, as against Meysenburg,\r\nPresident Turner, of the Suburban Railway, and Philip Stock, the brewery\r\nsecretary. The perjurers were found guilty. Meanwhile Mr. Folk was\r\ntrying through both Washington and Jefferson City to have Murrell and\r\nKratz brought back. These regular channels failing, he applied to his\r\nsources of information in Murrell’s (the House) combine, and he soon\r\nlearned that the fugitive was ill, without money, and unable to\r\ncommunicate with his wife or friends. Money that had been raised for him\r\nto flee with had been taken by others, and another fund sent to him by a\r\nfellow-boodler did not reach him. The fellow-boodler did, but he failed\r\nto deliver the money. Murrell wanted to come home, and Mr. Folk, glad to\r\nwelcome him, let him come as far as a small town just outside of St.\r\nLouis. There he was held till Mr. Folk could arrange a _coup_ and make\r\nsure of a witness to corroborate what Murrell should say; for, secure in\r\nthe absence of Murrell, the whole House combine was denying everything.\r\nOne day (in September, 1902) Mr. Folk called one of them, George F.\r\nRobertson, into his office.\r\n\r\nThey had a long talk together, and Mr. Folk asked him, as he had time\r\nand again, to tell what he knew about the Suburban deal.\r\n\r\n“I have told you many times, Mr. Folk,” said Robertson, “that I know\r\nnothing about that.”\r\n\r\n“What would you say if you should see Murrell here?” Mr. Folk asked.\r\n\r\n“Murrell!” exclaimed Robertson. “That’s good, that is. Why, yes, I’d\r\nlike to see Murrell.”\r\n\r\nHe was laughing as Mr. Folk went to the door and called, “Murrell.”\r\nMurrell walked in. Robertson’s smile passed. He gripped his seat, and\r\narose like a man lifted by an electric shock. Once on his feet, he stood\r\nthere staring as at a ghost.\r\n\r\n“Murrell,” said Mr. Folk quietly, “the jig is up, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Murrell, “it’s all up.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve told everything?”\r\n\r\n“Everything.”\r\n\r\nRobertson sank into his chair. When he had time to recover his\r\nself-control, Mr. Folk asked him if he was ready to talk about the\r\nSuburban deal.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t see what else I can do, Mr. Folk; you’ve got me.”\r\n\r\nRobertson told all, and, with Murrell and Turner and Stock and the rolls\r\nof money to support him, Mr. Folk indicted for bribery or perjury, or\r\nboth, the remaining members of the House combine, sixteen men at one\r\nswoop. Some escaped. One, Charles Kelly, a leading witness in another\r\ncase, fled to Europe with more money than anyone believed he owned, and\r\nhe returned after a high time with plenty left. A leading financier of\r\nMissouri went away at about the same time, and when he got back, at\r\nabout the same time with Kelly, the statute of limitation in the\r\nfinancier’s case covered them both.\r\n\r\nWith all his success these losses were made the most of; it was remarked\r\nthat Mr. Folk had not yet convicted a very rich man. The Snyder case was\r\ncoming up, and with it a chance to show that even the power of money was\r\nnot irresistible. Snyder, now a banker in Kansas City, did not deny or\r\nattempt to disprove the charges of bribery; he made his defense his\r\nclaim to continuous residence in the State. Mr. Folk was not taken\r\nunawares; he proved the bribery and he proved the non-residence too, and\r\nthe banker was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nOne other trial intervened, that of Edmund Bersch of the House combine,\r\nand he was convicted of bribery and perjury. But all interest centered\r\nnow in the trial of Edward Butler, the boss, who, the people said, would\r\nnot be indicted; who, indicted, they said, would never be tried. Now\r\nthey were saying he would never be convicted.\r\n\r\nWhen Boss Tweed was tried in New York, his power was broken, his machine\r\nsmashed, his money spent, and the people were worked up to a fury\r\nagainst him. The most eminent members of the New York bar prosecuted\r\nhim. The most eminent members of the St. Louis Bar were engaged to\r\ndefend Butler. He was still the boss, he had millions of his own, and\r\nback of him were the resources, financial and political, of the leading\r\nmen of St. Louis. That the people were against him appeared in only one\r\nsign, that of the special juries, carefully chosen to keep out men\r\nprivately known to be implicated. These juries had invariably convicted\r\nthe boodlers. Butler asked to be tried in some other town. Mr. Folk\r\nsuggested Columbia, the university town of the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\nColumbia was chosen, and Butler’s sons went up there with their heelers\r\nto “fix the town.” They spent money freely, and because the loafers\r\ndrank with them plentifully, the Butlerites thought they “had the town\r\nright.” But they did not know Columbia; neither did Butler. When he\r\nstepped off the train, he asked genially what the business of the town\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“Education,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Education!” he blurted. “That’s a h—l of a business!” And he conducted\r\nhimself as if he did not understand what it meant. His friends having\r\nprepared the way for a “good fellow,” Butler set about proving himself\r\nsuch, and his reception in the bar-rooms and streets was so flattering\r\nthat it was predicted in his crowd that Folk would never leave Columbia\r\nalive. But Mr. Folk understood the people better. Stanch as the leading\r\ninterests of St. Louis were against him, he always held that his\r\nunflinching juries meant that the silent people of St. Louis were\r\nagainst boodlers and out in the State he felt still surer of this. He\r\nwas right. There was no demonstration for him. He was welcomed, but in\r\ndecorous fashion; and all he saw by way of prejudice was the friendly\r\nlook out of kind eyes that went with the warm pressure of strange hands.\r\nWhen the jury was drawn, every man on it proved to be a Democrat, and\r\nthree were members of the Democratic County Committee. Mr. Folk was\r\nurged to challenge these, for, after all, Colonel Butler was at the head\r\nof their machine. He accepted them. He might as well have objected to\r\nthe judge, John A. Hockaday, who also was a Democrat. “No, sir,” said\r\nMr. Folk; “I am a Democrat, and I will try Butler before a Democratic\r\njudge and a Democratic jury.”\r\n\r\nThe trial was a scene to save out of all the hideousness before and\r\nafter it. The little old court-house headed one end of a short main\r\nstreet, the university the other; farmers’ mule teams were hitched all\r\nalong between. From far and near people came to see this trial, and,\r\nwith the significance of it in mind, men halted to read over the\r\nentrance to the court these words, chiseled long ago: “Oh, Justice, when\r\ndriven from other habitations, make this thy dwelling-place.” You could\r\nsee the appropriateness of that legend take hold of men, and in the\r\nspirit of it they passed into the dingy courtroom. There the rows of\r\nintent faces seemed to express that same sentiment. The jury looked, the\r\njudge personified it. He alone was cold, but he was attentive,\r\ndeliberate, and reasonable; you were sure of his common sense; you\r\nunderstood his rulings; and of his uprightness you were convinced by the\r\nway he seemed to lean, just a little, toward the prisoner. I don’t\r\nbelieve they will find any errors, however trivial, on which to reverse\r\nJohn A. Hockaday.[2] Even the prosecutor was fair. It was not Edward\r\nButler who was on trial, it was the State; and never before did Mr. Folk\r\nplead so earnestly for this conception of his work. Outside, in the\r\nchurches, prayer-meetings were held. These were private and\r\nundemonstrative; the praying citizens did not tell even Mr. Folk that\r\nthey were asking their God to give him strength. Indirectly it came to\r\nhim, and, first fine sign as it was of approval from his client, the\r\npeople, it moved him deeply. And when, the plain case plainly stated, he\r\nmade his final appeal to the jury, the address was a statement of the\r\nimpersonal significance of the evidence, and of the State’s need of\r\npatriotic service and defense. “Missouri, Missouri,” he said softly,\r\nwith simple, convincing sincerity, “I am pleading for thee, pleading for\r\nthee.” And the jury understood. The judge was only clear and fair, but\r\nthe twelve men took his instructions out with them, and when they came\r\nback their verdict was, “Guilty; three years.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  See _Post Scriptum_, end of chapter.\r\n\r\nThat was Missouri. What of St. Louis? Some years ago, when Butler was\r\nyoung in corruption, he was caught gambling, and with the charge pending\r\nagainst him St. Louis rose to challenge him. Meetings were held all over\r\nthe city—one in the Exchange downtown—to denounce the political leader,\r\nwho, an offense always, had dared commit the felony of gambling. Now,\r\nwhen he was caught and convicted and sentenced for bribery, what did St.\r\nLouis do? The first comment I heard in the streets when we all got back\r\nthat day was that “Butler would never wear the stripes.” I heard it time\r\nand again, and you can hear it from banker and barber there to-day.\r\nButler himself behaved decently. He stayed indoors for a few weeks—till\r\na committee of citizens from the best residence section called upon him\r\nto come forth and put through the House of Delegates a bill for the\r\nimprovement of a street in their neighborhood; and Butler had this done!\r\n\r\nOne of the first greetings to Mr. Folk was a warning from a high source\r\nthat now at length he had gone far enough, and on the heels of this came\r\nan order from the Police Department that hereafter all communications\r\nfrom him to the police should be made in writing. This meant slow\r\narrests; it meant that the fight was to go on. Well, Mr. Folk had meant\r\nto go on, anyway.\r\n\r\n“Officer,” he said to the man who brought the message, “go back to the\r\nman who sent you, and say to him that I understand him, and that\r\nhereafter all my communications with his department will be in the form\r\nof _indictments_.”\r\n\r\nThat department retreated in haste, explaining and apologizing, and\r\noffering all possible facilities. Mr. Folk went on with his business. He\r\nput on trial Henry Nicolaus, the brewer, accused of bribery. Mr.\r\nNicolaus pleaded that he did not know what was to be the use of a note\r\nfor $140,000 which he had endorsed. And on this the judge took the case\r\naway from the jury and directed a verdict of not guilty. It was the\r\nfirst case Mr. Folk had lost. He won the next eight, all boodle\r\nlegislators, making his record fourteen against one. But the Supreme\r\nCourt, technical and slow, is the last stand for such criminals, and\r\nthey won their first fight there.[3] The Meysenburg case was sent back\r\nfor retrial.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  See _Post Scriptum_, end of chapter.\r\n\r\nMr. Folk has work ahead of him for the two years remaining of his term,\r\nand he is the man to carry it all through. But where is it all to end?\r\nThere are more men to be indicted, many more to be tried, and there is\r\nmuch more corruption to be disclosed. But the people of St. Louis know\r\nenough. What are they going to do about it?\r\n\r\nThey have had one opportunity already to act. In November (1902), just\r\nbefore the Butler verdict, but after the trial was begun, there was an\r\nelection. Some of the offices to be filled might have to do with\r\nboodling cases. Mr. Folk and boodling were the natural issue, but the\r\npoliticians avoided it. Neither party “claimed” Mr. Folk. Both parties\r\ntook counsel of Butler in making up their tickets, and they satisfied\r\nhim. The Democrats did not mention Folk’s name in the platform, and they\r\nnominated Butler’s son for the seat in Congress from which he had\r\nrepeatedly been ousted for fraud at the polls.\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked a Democratic leader, who said he controlled all but four\r\ndistricts in his organization.\r\n\r\n“Because I needed those Butler districts,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“But isn’t there enough anti-boodling sentiment in this town to offset\r\nthose districts?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was right. And yet those juries and those prayers must mean\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nMr. Folk says, “Ninety-nine per cent. of the people are honest; only one\r\nper cent. is dishonest. But the one per cent. is perniciously active.”\r\nIn other words, the people are sound, but without leaders. Another\r\nofficial, of irreproachable character himself, said that the trouble was\r\nthere was “no one fit to throw the first stone.”\r\n\r\nHowever, this may be, here are the facts:\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these sensations, and this obvious, obstinate\r\npolitical rottenness, the innocent citizens, who must be at least a\r\ndecisive minority, did not register last fall. Butler, the papers said,\r\nhad great furniture vans going about with men who were said to be\r\nrepeaters, and yet the registration was the lowest in many years. When\r\nthe Butlerized tickets were announced, there was no audible protest. It\r\nwas the time for an independent movement. A third ticket might not have\r\nwon, but it would have shown the politicians (whether they counted them\r\nin or out) how many honest votes there were in the city, and what they\r\nwould have to reckon with in the force of public sentiment. Nothing of\r\nthe sort was done. St. Louis, rich, dirty, and despoiled, was busy with\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAnother opportunity is coming soon. In April the city votes for\r\nmunicipal legislators, and since the municipal assembly has been the\r\nscene of most of the corruption, you would think boodling would surely\r\nbe an issue then. I doubt it. When I was there in January (1903), the\r\npoliticians were planning to keep it out, and their ingenious scheme was\r\nto combine on one ticket; that is to say, each group of leaders would\r\nname half the nominees, who were to be put on identical tickets, making\r\nno contest at all. And to avoid suspicion, these nominations were to be\r\nexceptionally, yes, “remarkably good.”[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  See _Post Scriptum_, end of chapter.\r\n\r\nThat is the old Butler non-partisan or bi-partisan system. It emanates\r\nnow from the rich men back of the ring, but it means that the ring is\r\nintact, alert, and hopeful. They are “playing for time.” The convicts\r\nsitting in the municipal assembly, the convicts appealing to the higher\r\ncourts, the rich men abroad, the bankers down town—all are waiting for\r\nsomething. What are they waiting for?\r\n\r\nCharles Kratz, the ex-president of the Council, head and go-between of\r\nthe Council combine, the fugitive from justice, who, by his flight,\r\nblocks the way to the exposure and conviction of the rich and\r\ninfluential men who are holding the people of Missouri in check and\r\nkeeping boodling from going before the people as a political issue, this\r\ncriminal exile, thus backed, was asked this question in Mexico, and here\r\nis the answer he returned:\r\n\r\n“I am waiting for Joe Folk’s term to expire. Then I am going home to run\r\nfor Governor of Missouri and vindication.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Post Scriptum_, December, 1904.—The tickets were not “remarkably good.”\r\n“Boodle” was not in the platform, nor “reform.” The bi-partisan\r\nboodlers, with reformers and “respectable” business men for backers,\r\nfaced it out, and Boss Butler reorganized the new House of Delegates\r\nwith his man for Speaker and the superintendent of his garbage plant (in\r\nthe interest of which he offered the bribes for which he was convicted)\r\nfor chairman of the Sanitary Committee.\r\n\r\nAnd the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed his case and all the other\r\nboodle cases one by one, then by wholesale. The whole machinery of\r\njustice broke down under the strain of boodle pull.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Mr. Folk uncovered corruption in the State and,\r\nannouncing himself a candidate for Governor, has appealed from the Court\r\nto the People, from the City of St. Louis to the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PITTSBURG: A CITY ASHAMED\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (_May, 1903_)\r\n\r\nMinneapolis was an example of police corruption; St. Louis of financial\r\ncorruption. Pittsburg is an example of both police and financial\r\ncorruption. The two other cities have found each an official who has\r\nexposed them. Pittsburg has had no such man and no exposure. The city\r\nhas been described physically as “Hell with the lid off”; politically it\r\nis hell with the lid on. I am not going to lift the lid. The exposition\r\nof what the people know and stand is the purpose of these articles, not\r\nthe exposure of corruption, and the exposure of Pittsburg is not\r\nnecessary. There are earnest men in the town who declare it must blow up\r\nof itself soon. I doubt that; but even if it does burst, the people of\r\nPittsburg will learn little more than they know now. It is not ignorance\r\nthat keeps American citizens subservient; neither is it indifference.\r\nThe Pittsburgers know, and a strong minority of them care; they have\r\nrisen against their ring and beaten it, only to look about and find\r\nanother ring around them. Angry and ashamed, Pittsburg is a type of the\r\ncity that has tried to be free and failed.\r\n\r\nA sturdy city it is, too, the second in Pennsylvania. Two rivers flow\r\npast it to make a third, the Ohio, in front, and all around and beneath\r\nit are natural gas and coal which feed a thousand furnaces that smoke\r\nall day and flame all night to make Pittsburg the Birmingham of America.\r\nRich in natural resources, it is richest in the quality of its\r\npopulation. Six days and six nights these people labor, molding iron and\r\nforging steel, and they are not tired; on the seventh day they rest,\r\nbecause that is the Sabbath. They are Scotch Presbyterians and\r\nProtestant Irish. This stock had an actual majority not many years ago,\r\nand now, though the population has grown to 354,000 in Pittsburg proper\r\n(counting Allegheny across the river, 130,000, and other communities,\r\npolitically separate, but essentially integral parts of the proposed\r\nGreater Pittsburg, the total is 750,000), the Scotch and Scotch-Irish\r\nstill predominate, and their clean, strong faces characterize the crowds\r\nin the streets. Canny, busy, and brave, they built up their city almost\r\nin secret, making millions and hardly mentioning it. Not till outsiders\r\ncame in to buy some of them out did the world (and Pittsburg and some of\r\nthe millionaires in it) discover that the Iron City had been making not\r\nonly steel and glass, but multimillionaires. A banker told a business\r\nman as a secret one day about three years ago that within six months a\r\n“bunch of about a hundred new millionaires would be born in Pittsburg,”\r\nand the births happened on time. And more beside. But even the bloom of\r\nmillions did not hurt the city. Pittsburg is an unpretentious,\r\nprosperous city of tremendous industry and healthy, steady men.\r\n\r\nSuperior as it is in some other respects, however, Scotch-Irish\r\nPittsburg, politically, is no better than Irish New York or Scandinavian\r\nMinneapolis, and little better than German St. Louis. These people, like\r\nany other strain of the free American, have despoiled the\r\ngovernment—despoiled it, let it be despoiled, and bowed to the\r\ndespoiling boss. There is nothing in the un-American excuse that this or\r\nthat foreign nationality has prostituted “our great and glorious\r\ninstitutions.” We all do it, all breeds alike. And there is nothing in\r\nthe complaint that the lower elements of our city populations are the\r\nsource of our disgrace. In St. Louis corruption came from the top, in\r\nMinneapolis from the bottom. In Pittsburg it comes from both\r\nextremities, but it began above.\r\n\r\nThe railroads began the corruption of this city. There “always was some\r\ndishonesty,” as the oldest public men I talked with said, but it was\r\noccasional and criminal till the first great corporation made it\r\nbusinesslike and respectable. The municipality issued bonds to help the\r\ninfant railroads to develop the city, and, as in so many American\r\ncities, the roads repudiated the debt and interest, and went into\r\npolitics. The Pennsylvania Railroad was in the system from the start,\r\nand, as the other roads came in and found the city government bought up\r\nby those before them, they purchased their rights of way by outbribing\r\nthe older roads, then joined the ring to acquire more rights for\r\nthemselves and to keep belated rivals out. As corporations multiplied\r\nand capital branched out corruption increased naturally, but the notable\r\ncharacteristic of the “Pittsburg plan” of misgovernment was that it was\r\nnot a haphazard growth, but a deliberate, intelligent organization. It\r\nwas conceived in one mind, built up by one will, and this master spirit\r\nruled, not like Croker in New York, a solid majority; nor like Butler in\r\nSt. Louis, a bi-partisan minority; but the whole town—financial,\r\ncommercial, and political. The boss of Pittsburg was Christopher L.\r\nMagee, a great man, and when he died he was regarded by many of the\r\nstrongest men in Pittsburg as their leading citizen.\r\n\r\n“Chris,” as he was called, was a charming character. I have seen\r\nPittsburgers grow black in the face denouncing his ring, but when I\r\nasked, “What kind of a man was Magee?” they would cool and say, “Chris?\r\nChris was one of the best men God ever made.” If I smiled, they would\r\nsay, “That is all right. You smile, and you can go ahead and show up the\r\nring. You may describe this town as the worst in the country. But you\r\nget Magee wrong and you’ll have all Pittsburg up in arms.” Then they\r\nwould tell me that “Magee robbed the town,” or, perhaps, they would\r\nspeak of the fund raising to erect a monument to the dead boss.\r\n\r\nSo I must be careful. And, to begin with, Magee did not, technically\r\nspeaking, rob the town. That was not his way, and it would be a\r\ncarelessly unnecessary way in Pennsylvania. But surely he does not\r\ndeserve a monument.\r\n\r\nMagee was an American. His paternal great-grandfather served in the\r\nRevolution, and settled in Pittsburg at the close of the war.\r\nChristopher was born on Good Friday, April 14, 1848. He was sent to\r\nschool till he was fifteen years old. Then his father died, and “Squire”\r\nor “Tommy” Steele, his uncle, a boss of that day, gave him his start in\r\nlife with a place in the City Treasury. When just twenty-one, he made\r\nhim cashier, and two years later Chris had himself elected City\r\nTreasurer by a majority of 1100 on a ticket the head of which was beaten\r\nby 1500 votes.\r\n\r\nSuch was his popularity; and, though he systematized and capitalized it,\r\nit lasted to the end, for the foundation thereof was goodness of heart\r\nand personal charm. Magee was tall, strong, and gracefully built. His\r\nhair was dark till it turned gray, then his short mustache and his\r\neyebrows held black, and his face expressed easily sure power and\r\ngenial, hearty kindness. But he was ambitious for power, and all his\r\ngoodness of heart was directed by a shrewd mind.\r\n\r\nWhen Chris saw the natural following gathering about him he realized,\r\nyoung as he was, the use of it, and he retired from office (holding only\r\na fire commissionership) with the avowed purpose of becoming a boss.\r\nDetermined to make his ring perfect, he went to Philadelphia to study\r\nthe plan in operation there. Later, when the Tweed ring was broken, he\r\nspent months in New York looking into Tammany’s machine methods and the\r\nmistakes which had led to its exposure and disruption. With that\r\ncheerful candor which softens indignation he told a fellow-townsman (who\r\ntold me) what he was doing in New York; and when Magee returned he\r\nreported that a ring could be made as safe as a bank. He had, to start\r\nwith, a growing town too busy for self-government; two not very unequal\r\nparties, neither of them well organized; a clear field in his own, the\r\nmajority party in the city, county, and State. There was boodle, but it\r\nwas loosely shared by too many persons. The governing instrument was the\r\nold charter of 1816, which lodged all the powers—legislative,\r\nadministrative, and executive—in the councils, common and select. The\r\nmayor was a peace officer, with no responsible power. Indeed, there was\r\nno responsibility anywhere. There were no departments. Committees of\r\ncouncils did the work usually done by departments, and the councilmen,\r\nunsalaried and unanswerable individually, were organized into what might\r\nhave become a combine had not Magee set about establishing the one-man\r\npower there.\r\n\r\nTo control councils Magee had to organize the wards, and he was managing\r\nthis successfully at the primaries, when a new and an important figure\r\nappeared on the scene—William Flinn. Flinn was Irish, a Protestant of\r\nCatholic stock, a boss contractor, and a natural politician. He beat one\r\nof Magee’s brothers in his ward. Magee laughed, inquired, and, finding\r\nhim a man of opposite or complementary disposition and talents, took him\r\ninto a partnership. A happy, profitable combination, it lasted for life.\r\nMagee wanted power, Flinn wealth. Each got both these things; but Magee\r\nspent his wealth for more power, and Flinn spent his power for more\r\nwealth. Magee was the sower, Flinn the reaper. In dealing with men they\r\ncame to be necessary to each other, these two. Magee attracted\r\nfollowers, Flinn employed them. The men Magee won Flinn compelled to\r\nobey, and those he lost Magee won back. When the councils were first\r\nunder his control Magee stood in the lobby to direct them, always by\r\nsuggestions and requests, which sometimes a mean and ungrateful fellow\r\nwould say he could not heed. Magee told him it was all right, which\r\nsaved the man, but lost the vote. So Flinn took the lobby post, and he\r\nsaid: “Here, you go and vote aye.” If they disobeyed the plain order\r\nFlinn punished them, and so harshly that they would run to Magee to\r\ncomplain. He comforted them. “Never mind Flinn,” he would say\r\nsympathetically; “he gives me no end of trouble, too. But I’d like to\r\nhave you do what he asked. Go and do it for me, and let me attend to\r\nFlinn. I’ll fix him.”\r\n\r\nMagee could command, too, and fight and punish. If he had been alone he\r\nprobably would have hardened with years. And so Flinn, after Magee died,\r\nsoftened with time, but too late. He was useful to Magee, Magee was\r\nindispensable to him. Molasses and vinegar, diplomacy and force, mind\r\nand will, they were well mated. But Magee was the genius. It was Magee\r\nthat laid the plans they worked out together.\r\n\r\nBoss Magee’s idea was not to corrupt the city government, but to be it;\r\nnot to hire votes in councils, but to own councilmen; and so, having\r\nseized control of his organization, he nominated cheap or dependent men\r\nfor the select and common councils. Relatives and friends were his first\r\nrecourse, then came bartenders, saloon-keepers, liquor dealers, and\r\nothers allied to the vices, who were subject to police regulation and\r\ndependent in a business way upon the maladministration of law. For the\r\nrest he preferred men who had no visible means of support, and to\r\nmaintain them he used the usual means—patronage. And to make his\r\ndependents secure he took over the county government. Pittsburg is in\r\nAllegheny County, which has always been more strongly Republican than\r\nthe city. No matter what happened in the city, the county pay-roll was\r\nalways Magee’s, and he made the county part of the city government.\r\n\r\nWith all this city and county patronage at his command, Magee went\r\ndeliberately about undermining the Democratic party. The minority\r\norganization is useful to a majority leader; it saves him trouble and\r\nworry in ordinary times; in party crises he can use it to whip his own\r\nfollowers into line; and when the people of a city rise in revolt it is\r\nessential for absolute rule that you have the power not only to prevent\r\nthe minority leaders from combining with the good citizens, but to unite\r\nthe two organizations to whip the community into shape. Moreover, the\r\nexistence of a supposed opposition party splits the independent vote and\r\nhelps to keep alive that sentiment, “loyalty to party,” which is one of\r\nthe best holds the boss has on his unruly subjects. All bosses, as we\r\nhave seen in Minneapolis and St. Louis, rise above partisan bias. Magee,\r\nthe wisest of them, was also the most generous, and he liked to win over\r\nopponents who were useful to him. Whenever he heard of an able\r\nDemocratic worker in a ward, he sent for his own Republican leader.\r\n“So-and-so is a good man, isn’t he?” he would ask. “Going to give you a\r\nrun, isn’t he? Find out what he wants, and we’ll see what we can do. We\r\nmust have him.” Thus the able Democrat achieved office for himself or\r\nhis friend, and the city or the county paid. At one time, I was told,\r\nnearly one-quarter of the places on the pay-roll were held by Democrats,\r\nwho were, of course, grateful to Chris Magee, and enabled him in\r\nemergencies to wield their influence against revolting Republicans. Many\r\na time a subservient Democrat got Republican votes to beat a “dangerous”\r\nRepublican, and when Magee, toward the end of his career, wished to go\r\nto the State Senate, both parties united in his nomination and elected\r\nhim unanimously.\r\n\r\nBusiness men came almost as cheap as politicians, and they came also at\r\nthe city’s expense. Magee had control of public funds and the choice of\r\ndepositories. That is enough for the average banker—not only for him\r\nthat is chosen, but for him also that may some day hope to be chosen—and\r\nMagee dealt with the best of those in Pittsburg. This service, moreover,\r\nnot only kept them docile, but gave him and Flinn credit at their banks.\r\nThen, too, Flinn and Magee’s operations soon developed on a scale which\r\nmade their business attractive to the largest financial institutions for\r\nthe profits on their loans, and thus enabled them to distribute and\r\nshare in the golden opportunities of big deals. There are ring banks in\r\nPittsburg, ring trust companies, and ring brokers. The manufacturers and\r\nthe merchants were kept well in hand by many little municipal grants and\r\nprivileges, such as switches, wharf rights, and street and alley\r\nvacations. These street vacations are a tremendous power in most cities.\r\nA foundry occupies a block, spreads to the next block, and wants the\r\nstreet between. In St. Louis the business man boodled for his street. In\r\nPittsburg he went to Magee, and I have heard such a man praise Chris,\r\n“because when I called on him his outer office was filled with waiting\r\npoliticians, but he knew I was a business man and in a hurry; he called\r\nme in first, and he gave me the street without any fuss. I tell you it\r\nwas a sad day for Pittsburg when Chris Magee died.” This business man,\r\nthe typical American merchant everywhere, cares no more for his city’s\r\ninterest than the politician does, and there is more light on American\r\npolitical corruption in such a speech than in the most sensational\r\nexposure of details. The business men of Pittsburg paid for their little\r\nfavors in “contributions to the campaign fund,” plus the loss of their\r\nself-respect, the liberty of the citizens generally, and (this may\r\nappeal to their mean souls) in higher taxes.\r\n\r\nAs for the railroads, they did not have to be bought or driven in; they\r\ncame, and promptly, too. The Pennsylvania appeared early, just behind\r\nMagee, who handled their passes and looked out for their interest in\r\ncouncils and afterwards at the State Legislature. The Pennsylvania\r\npasses, especially those to Atlantic City and Harrisburg, have always\r\nbeen a “great graft” in Pittsburg. For the sort of men Magee had to\r\ncontrol a pass had a value above the price of a ticket; to “flash” one\r\nis to show a badge of power and relationship to the ring. The big\r\nringsters, of course, got from the railroads financial help when\r\ncornered in business deals—stock tips, shares in speculative and other\r\nfinancial turns, and political support. The Pennsylvania Railroad is a\r\npower in Pennsylvania politics, it is part of the State ring, and part\r\nalso of the Pittsburg ring. The city paid in all sorts of rights and\r\nprivileges, streets, bridges, etc., and in certain periods the business\r\ninterests of the city were sacrificed to leave the Pennsylvania Road in\r\nexclusive control of a freight traffic it could not handle alone.\r\n\r\nWith the city, the county, the Republican and Democratic organizations,\r\nthe railroads and other corporations, the financiers and the business\r\nmen, all well under control, Magee needed only the State to make his\r\nrule absolute. And he was entitled to it. In a State like New York,\r\nwhere one party controls the Legislature and another the city, the\r\npeople in the cities may expect some protection from party opposition.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, where the Republicans have an overwhelming majority,\r\nthe Legislature at Harrisburg is an essential part of the government of\r\nPennsylvania cities, and that is ruled by a State ring. Magee’s ring was\r\na link in the State ring, and it was no more than right that the State\r\nring should become a link in his ring. The arrangement was easily made.\r\nOne man, Matthew S. Quay, had received from the people all the power in\r\nthe State, and Magee saw Quay. They came to an understanding without the\r\nleast trouble. Flinn was to be in the Senate, Magee in the lobby, and\r\nthey were to give unto Quay political support for his business in the\r\nState in return for his surrender to them of the State’s functions of\r\nlegislation for the city of Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nNow such understandings are common in our politics, but they are verbal\r\nusually and pretty well kept, and this of Magee and Quay was also\r\nfounded in secret good faith. But Quay, in crises, has a way of\r\nstraining points to win, and there were no limits to Magee’s ambition\r\nfor power. Quay and Magee quarreled constantly over the division of\r\npowers and spoils, so after a few years of squabbling they reduced their\r\nagreement to writing. This precious instrument has never been published.\r\nBut the agreement was broken in a great row once, and when William Flinn\r\nand J. O. Brown undertook to settle the differences and renew the bond,\r\nFlinn wrote out in pencil in his own hand an amended duplicate which he\r\nsubmitted to Quay, whose son subsequently gave it out for publication. A\r\nfacsimile of one page is reproduced in this article. Here is the whole\r\ncontract, with all the unconscious humor of the “party of the first\r\npart” and “said party of the second part,” a political-legal-commercial\r\ninsult to a people boastful of self-government:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FACSIMILE OF THE FAMOUS QUAY-FLINN “MUTUAL POLITICAL AND BUSINESS\r\n    ADVANTAGE AGREEMENT.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n    “Memorandum and agreement between M. S. Quay of the first part and\r\n    J. O. Brown and William Flinn of the second part, the\r\n    consideration of this agreement being the mutual political and\r\n    business advantage which may result therefrom.\r\n\r\n    “First—The said M. S. Quay is to have the benefit of the influence\r\n    in all matters in state and national politics of the said parties\r\n    of the second part, the said parties agreeing that they will\r\n    secure the election of delegates to the state and national\r\n    convention, who will be guided in all matters by the wishes of the\r\n    said party of the first part, and who will also secure the\r\n    election of members of the state senate from the Forty-third,\r\n    Forty-fourth, and Forty-fifth senatorial districts, and also\r\n    secure the election of members of the house of representatives\r\n    south of the Monongahela and Ohio rivers in the county of\r\n    Allegheny, who will be guided by the wishes and request of the\r\n    said party of the first part during the continuance of this\r\n    agreement upon all political matters. The different candidates for\r\n    the various positions mentioned shall be selected by the parties\r\n    of the second part, and all the positions of state and national\r\n    appointments made in this territory mentioned shall be\r\n    satisfactory to and secure the indorsement of the party of the\r\n    second part, when the appointment is made either by or through the\r\n    party of the first part, or his friends or political associates.\r\n    All legislation affecting the parties of the second part,\r\n    affecting cities of the second class, shall receive the hearty\r\n    co-operation and assistance of the party of the first part, and\r\n    legislation which may affect their business shall likewise receive\r\n    the hearty co-operation and help of the party of the first part.\r\n    It bring distinctly understood that at the approaching national\r\n    convention, to be held at St. Louis, the delegates front the\r\n    Twenty-second congressional district shall neither by voice nor\r\n    vote do other than what is satisfactory to the party of the first\r\n    part. The party of the first part agrees to use his influence and\r\n    secure the support of his friends and political associates to\r\n    support the Republican county and city ticket, when nominated,\r\n    both in the city of Pittsburg and Allegheny, and the county of\r\n    Allegheny, and that he will discountenance the factional fighting\r\n    by his friends and associates for county offices during the\r\n    continuation of this agreement. This agreement is not to be\r\n    binding upon the parties of the second part when a candidate for\r\n    any office who [_sic_] shall reside in Allegheny county, and shall\r\n    only be binding if the party of the first part is a candidate for\r\n    United States senator to succeed himself so far as this office is\r\n    concerned. In the Forty-third senatorial district a new senator\r\n    shall be elected to succeed Senator Upperman. In the Forty-fifth\r\n    senatorial district the party of the first part shall secure the\r\n    withdrawal of Dr. A. J. Barchfeld, and the parties of the second\r\n    part shall withdraw as a candidate Senator Steel, and the parties\r\n    of the second part shall secure the election of some party\r\n    satisfactory to themselves. In the Twenty-second congressional\r\n    district the candidates for congress shall be selected by the\r\n    party of the second part. The term of this agreement to be for ——\r\n    years from the signing thereof, and shall be binding upon all\r\n    parties when signed by C. L. Magee.”\r\n\r\nThus was the city of Pittsburg turned over by the State to an individual\r\nto do with as he pleased. Magee’s ring was complete. He was the city,\r\nFlinn was the councils, the county was theirs, and now they had the\r\nState Legislature so far as Pittsburg was concerned. Magee and Flinn\r\nwere the government and the law. How could they commit a crime? If they\r\nwanted something from the city they passed an ordinance granting it, and\r\nif some other ordinance was in conflict it was repealed or amended. If\r\nthe laws in the State stood in the way, so much the worse for the laws\r\nof the State; they were amended. If the constitution of the State proved\r\na barrier, as it did to all special legislation, the Legislature enacted\r\na law for cities of the second class (which was Pittsburg alone) and the\r\ncourts upheld the Legislature. If there were opposition on the side of\r\npublic opinion, there was a use for that also.\r\n\r\nThe new charter which David D. Bruce fought through councils in 1886–87\r\nwas an example of the way Magee and, after him, Quay and other\r\nPennsylvania bosses employed popular movements. As his machine grew\r\nMagee found council committees unwieldy in some respects, and he wanted\r\na change. He took up Bruce’s charter, which centered all executive and\r\nadministrative power and responsibility in the mayor and heads of\r\ndepartments, passed it through the Legislature, but so amended that the\r\nheads of departments were not to be appointed by the mayor, but elected\r\nby councils. These elections were by expiring councils, so that the\r\ndepartment chiefs held over, and with their patronage insured the\r\nre-election of the councilmen who elected them. The Magee-Flinn machine,\r\nperfect before, was made self-perpetuating. I know of nothing like it in\r\nany other city. Tammany in comparison is a plaything, and in the\r\nmanagement of a city Croker was a child beside Chris Magee.\r\n\r\nThe graft of Pittsburg falls conveniently into four classes: franchises,\r\npublic contracts, vice, and public funds. There was, besides these, a\r\nlot of miscellaneous loot—public supplies, public lighting, and the\r\nwater supply. You hear of second-class fire-engines taken at first-class\r\nprices, water rents from the public works kept up because a private\r\nconcern that supplied the South Side could charge no more than the city,\r\na gas contract to supply the city lightly availed of. But I cannot go\r\ninto these. Neither can I stop for the details of the system by which\r\npublic funds were left at no interest with favored depositories from\r\nwhich the city borrowed at a high rate, or the removal of funds to a\r\nbank in which the ringsters were shareholders. All these things were\r\nmanaged well within the law, and that was the great principle underlying\r\nthe Pittsburg plan.\r\n\r\nThe vice graft, for example, was not blackmail as it is in New York and\r\nmost other cities. It is a legitimate business, conducted, not by the\r\npolice, but in an orderly fashion by syndicates, and the chairman of one\r\nof the parties at the last election said it was worth $250,000 a year. I\r\nsaw a man who was laughed at for offering $17,500 for the slot-machine\r\nconcession; he was told that it was let for much more. “Speak-easies”\r\n(unlicensed drinking places) pay so well that when they earn $500 or\r\nmore in twenty-four hours their proprietors often make a bare living.\r\nDisorderly houses are managed by ward syndicates. Permission is had from\r\nthe syndicate real estate agent, who alone can rent them. The syndicate\r\nhires a house from the owners at, say, $35 a month, and he lets it to a\r\nwoman at from $35 to $50 a week. For furniture the tenant must go to the\r\n“official furniture man,” who delivers $1000 worth of “fixings” for a\r\nnote for $3000, on which high interest must be paid. For beer the tenant\r\nmust go to the “official bottler,” and pay $2 for a one-dollar case of\r\nbeer; for wines and liquors to the “official liquor commissioner,” who\r\ncharges $10 for five dollars’ worth; for clothes to the “official\r\nwrapper maker.” These women may not buy shoes, hats, jewelry, or any\r\nother luxury or necessity except from the official concessionaries, and\r\nthen only at the official, monopoly prices. If the victims have anything\r\nleft, a police or some other city official is said to call and get it\r\n(there are rich ex-police officials in Pittsburg). But this is blackmail\r\nand outside the system, which is well understood in the community. Many\r\nmen, in various walks of life, told me separately the names of the\r\nofficial bottlers, jewelers, and furnishers; they are notorious, but\r\nthey are safe. They do nothing illegal. Oppressive, wretched, what you\r\nplease, the Pittsburg system is safe.\r\n\r\nThat was the keynote of the Flinn-Magee plan, but this vice graft was\r\nnot their business. They are credited with the suppression of disorder\r\nand decent superficial regulations of vice, which is a characteristic of\r\nPittsburg. I know it is said that under the Philadelphia and Pittsburg\r\nplans, which are much alike, “all graft and all patronage go across one\r\ntable,” but if any “dirty money” reached the Pittsburg bosses it was, so\r\nfar as I could prove, in the form of contributions to the party fund,\r\nand came from the vice dealers only as it did from other business men.\r\n\r\nMagee and Flinn, owners of Pittsburg, made Pittsburg their business,\r\nand, monopolists in the technical economic sense of the word, they\r\nprepared to exploit it as if it were their private property. For\r\nconvenience they divided it between them. Magee took the financial and\r\ncorporate branch, turning the streets to his uses, delivering to himself\r\nfranchises, and building and running railways. Flinn went in for public\r\ncontracts for his firm, Booth & Flinn, Limited, and his branch boomed.\r\nOld streets were repaved, new ones laid out; whole districts were\r\nimproved, parks made, and buildings erected. The improvement of their\r\ncity went on at a great rate for years, with only one period of\r\ncessation, and the period of economy was when Magee was building so many\r\ntraction lines that Booth & Flinn, Ltd., had all they could do with this\r\nwork. It was said that no other contractors had an adequate “plant” to\r\nsupplement properly the work of Booth & Flinn, Ltd. Perhaps that was why\r\nthis firm had to do such a large proportion of the public work always.\r\nFlinn’s Director of Public Works was E. M. Bigelow, a cousin of Chris\r\nMagee and another nephew of old Squire Steele. Bigelow, called the\r\nExtravagant, drew the specifications; he made the awards to the lowest\r\n_responsible_ bidders, and he inspected and approved the work while in\r\nprogress and when done.\r\n\r\nFlinn had a quarry, the stone of which was specified for public\r\nbuildings; he obtained the monopoly of a certain kind of asphalt, and\r\nthat kind was specified. Nor was this all. If the official contractor\r\nhad done his work well and at reasonable prices the city would not have\r\nsuffered directly; but his methods were so oppressive upon property\r\nholders that they caused a scandal. No action was taken, however, till\r\nOliver McClintock, a merchant, in rare civic wrath, contested the\r\ncontracts and fought them through the courts. This single citizen’s\r\nlong, brave fight is one of the finest stories in the history of\r\nmunicipal government. The frowns and warnings of cowardly\r\nfellow-citizens did not move him, nor the boycott of other business men,\r\nthe threats of the ring, and the ridicule of ring organs. George W.\r\nGuthrie joined him later, and though they fought on undaunted, they were\r\nbeaten again and again. The Director of Public Works controlled the\r\ninitiative in court proceedings; he chose the judge who appointed the\r\nViewers, with the result, Mr. McClintock reported, that the Department\r\nprepared the Viewers’ reports. Knowing no defeat, Mr. McClintock\r\nphotographed Flinn’s pavements at places where they were torn up to show\r\nthat “large stones, as they were excavated from sewer trenches, brick\r\nbats, and the débris of old coal-tar sidewalks were promiscuously dumped\r\nin to make foundations, with the result of an uneven settling of the\r\nfoundation, and the sunken and worn places so conspicuous everywhere in\r\nthe pavements of the East End.” One outside asphalt company tried to\r\nbreak the monopoly, but was easily beaten in 1889, withdrew, and after\r\nthat one of its officers said, “We all gave Pittsburg a wide berth,\r\nrecognizing the uselessness of offering competition so long as the door\r\nof the Department of Public Works is locked against us, and Booth &\r\nFlinn are permitted to carry the key.” The monopoly caused not only high\r\nprices on short guarantee, but carried with it all the contingent work.\r\nCurbing and grading might have been let separately, but they were not.\r\nIn one contract Mr. McClintock cites, Booth & Flinn bid 50 cents for\r\n44,000 yards of grading. E. H. Bochman offered a bid of 15 cents for the\r\ngrading as a separate contract, and his bid was rejected. A\r\nproperty-owner on Shady Lane, who was assessed for curbing at 80 cents a\r\nfoot, contracted privately at the same time for 800 feet of the same\r\nstandard curbing, from the same quarry, and set in place in the same\r\nmanner, at 40 cents a foot!\r\n\r\n“During the nine years succeeding the adoption of the charter of 1887,”\r\nsays Mr. Oliver McClintock in a report to the National Municipal League,\r\n“one firm [Flinn’s] received practically all the asphalt-paving\r\ncontracts at prices ranging from $1 to $1.80 per square yard higher than\r\nthe average price paid in neighboring cities. Out of the entire amount\r\nof asphalt pavements laid during these nine years, represented by 193\r\ncontracts, and costing $3,551,131, only nine street blocks paved in\r\n1896, and costing $33,400, were not laid by this firm.”\r\n\r\nThe building of bridges in this city of bridges, the repairing of\r\npavements, park-making, and real estate deals in anticipation of city\r\nimprovements were all causes of scandal to some citizens, sources of\r\nprofit to others who were “let in on the ground floor.” There is no\r\nspace for these here. Another exposure came in 1897 over the contracts\r\nfor a new Public Safety Building. J. O. Brown was Director of Public\r\nSafety. A newspaper, the _Leader_, called attention to a deal for this\r\nwork, and George W. Guthrie and William B. Rogers, leading members of\r\nthe Pittsburg bar, who followed up the subject, discovered as queer a\r\nset of specifications for the building itself as any city has on record.\r\nFavored contractors were named or their wares described all through, and\r\na letter to the architect from J. O. Brown contained specifications for\r\nsuch favoritism, as, for example: “Specify the Westinghouse\r\nelectric-light plant and engines straight.” “Describe the Van Horn Iron\r\nCo.’s cells as close as possible.” The stone clause was Flinn’s, and\r\nthat is the one that raised the rumpus. Flinn’s quarry produced Ligonier\r\nblock, and Ligonier block was specified. There was a letter from Booth &\r\nFlinn, Ltd., telling the architect that the price was to be specified at\r\n$31,500. A local contractor offered to provide Tennessee granite set up,\r\na more expensive material, on which the freight is higher, at $19,880;\r\nbut that did not matter. When another local contracting firm, however,\r\noffered to furnish Ligonier block set up at $18,000, a change was\r\nnecessary, and J. O. Brown directed the architect to “specify that the\r\nLigonier block shall be of a bluish tint rather than a gray variety.”\r\nFlinn’s quarry had the bluish tint, the other people’s “the gray\r\nvariety.” It was shown also that Flinn wrote to the architect on June\r\n24, 1895, saying: “I have seen Director Brown and Comptroller Gourley\r\nto-day, and they have agreed to let us start on the working plans and\r\nget some stone out for the new building. Please arrange that we may get\r\nthe tracings by Wednesday....” The tracings were furnished him, and thus\r\nbefore the advertisements for bids were out he began preparing the\r\nbluish tint stone. The charges were heard by a packed committee of\r\ncouncils, and nothing came of them; and, besides, they were directed\r\nagainst the Director of Public Works, not William Flinn.\r\n\r\nThe boss was not an official, and not responsible. The only time Flinn\r\nwas in danger was on a suit that grew out of the conviction of the City\r\nAttorney, W. C. Moreland, and L. H. House, his assistant, for the\r\nembezzlement of public funds. These officials were found to be short\r\nabout $300,000. One of them pleaded guilty, and both went to prison\r\nwithout telling where the money went, and that information did not\r\ndevelop till later. J. B. Connelly, of the _Leader_, discovered in the\r\nCity Attorney’s office stubs of checks indicating that some $118,000 of\r\nit had gone to Flinn or to Booth & Flinn, Ltd. When Flinn was first\r\nasked about it by a reporter he said that the items were correct, that\r\nhe got them, but that he had explained it all to the Comptroller and had\r\nsatisfied him. This answer indicated a belief that the money belonged to\r\nthe city. When he was sued by the city he said that he did not know it\r\nwas city money. He thought it was personal loans from House. Now House\r\nwas not a well-to-do man, and his city salary was but $2,500 a year.\r\nMoreover, the checks, two of which are reproduced here, are signed by\r\nthe City Attorney, W. C. Moreland, and are for amounts ranging from five\r\nto fifteen thousand dollars. But where was the money? Flinn testified\r\nthat he had paid it back to House. Then where were the receipts? Flinn\r\nsaid they had been burned in a fire that had occurred in Booth & Flinn’s\r\noffice. The judge found for Flinn, holding that it had not been proven\r\nthat Flinn knew the checks were for public money, nor that he had not\r\nrepaid the amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FACSIMILES OF CHECKS SHOWING THAT PUBLIC MONEY, EMBEZZLED BY PUBLIC\r\n    OFFICIALS, WENT TO BOSS FLINN, WHO EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW\r\n    THE CHECKS WERE FOR CITY MONEY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, however, unlawful acts were exceptional and\r\nunnecessary in Pittsburg. Magee did not steal franchises and sell them.\r\nHis councils gave them to him. He and the busy Flinn took them, built\r\nrailways, which Magee sold and bought and financed and conducted, like\r\nany other man whose successful career is held up as an example for young\r\nmen. His railways, combined into the Consolidated Traction Company, were\r\ncapitalized at $30,000,000. The public debt of Pittsburg is about\r\n$18,000,000, and the profit on the railway building of Chris Magee would\r\nhave wiped out the debt. “But you must remember,” they say in the\r\nPittsburg banks, “that Magee took risks, and his profits are the just\r\nreward of enterprise.” This is business. But politically speaking it was\r\nan abuse of the powers of a popular ruler for Boss Magee to give to\r\nPromoter Magee all the streets he wanted in Pittsburg at his own terms:\r\nforever, and nothing to pay. There was scandal in Chicago over the\r\ngranting of charters for twenty-eight and fifty years. Magee’s read:\r\n“for 950 years,” “for 999 years,” “said Charter is to exist a thousand\r\nyears,” “said Charter is to exist perpetually,” and the councils gave\r\nfranchises for the “life of the Charter.” There is a legend that Fred\r\nMagee, a waggish brother of Chris, put these phrases into these grants\r\nfor fun, and no doubt the genial Chris saw the fun of it. I asked if the\r\nsame joker put in the car tax, which is the only compensation the city\r\ngets for the use forever of its streets; but it was explained that that\r\nwas an oversight. The car tax was put upon the old horse-cars, and came\r\ndown upon the trolley because, having been left unpaid, it was\r\nforgotten. This car tax on $30,000,000 of property amounts to less than\r\n$15,000 a year, and the companies have until lately been slow about\r\npaying it. During the twelve years succeeding 1885 all the traction\r\ncompanies together paid the city $60,000. While the horse vehicles in\r\n1897 paid $47,000, and bicycles $7,000, the Consolidated Traction\r\nCompany[5] (C. L. Magee, President) paid $9,600. The speed of bicycles\r\nand horse vehicles is limited by law, that of the trolley is\r\nunregulated. The only requirement of the law upon them is that the\r\ntraction company shall keep in repair the pavement between and a foot\r\noutside of the tracks. This they don’t do, and they make the city\r\nfurnish twenty policemen as guards for crossings of their lines at a\r\ncost of $20,000 a year in wages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  All the street railways terminating in the city of Pittsburg were in\r\n  1901 consolidated into the Pittsburg Railways Company, operating 404\r\n  miles of track, under an approximate capitalization of $84,000,000. In\r\n  their statement, issued July 1, 1902, they report gross earnings for\r\n  1901 as $7,081,452.82. Out of this they paid a car tax for 1902 to the\r\n  city of Pittsburg of $20,099.94. At the ordinary rate of 5 per cent.\r\n  on gross earnings the tax would have been $354,072.60.\r\n\r\nNot content with the gift of the streets, the ring made the city work\r\nfor the railways. The building of bridges is one function of the\r\nmunicipality as a servant of the traction company. Pittsburg is a city\r\nof many bridges, and many of them were built for ordinary traffic. When\r\nthe Magee railways went over them some of them had to be rebuilt. The\r\ncompany asked the city to do it, and despite the protests of citizens\r\nand newspapers, the city rebuilt iron bridges in good condition and of\r\nrecent construction to accommodate the tracks. Once some citizens\r\napplied for a franchise to build a connecting line along what is now\r\npart of the Bloomfield route, and by way of compensation offered to\r\nbuild a bridge across the Pennsylvania tracks for free city use, they\r\nonly to have the right to run their cars on it. They did not get their\r\nfranchise. Not long after Chris Magee (and Flinn) got it, and they got\r\nit for nothing; and the city built this bridge, rebuilt three other\r\nbridges over the Pennsylvania tracks, and one over the Junction\r\nRailroad—five bridges in all, at a cost of $160,000!\r\n\r\nCanny Scots as they were, the Pittsburgers submitted to all this for a\r\nquarter of a century, and some $34,000 has been subscribed toward the\r\nmonument to Chris Magee. This sounds like any other well-broken American\r\ncity; but to the credit of Pittsburg be it said that there never was a\r\ntime when some few individuals were not fighting the ring. David D.\r\nBruce was standing for good government way back in the ‘fifties. Oliver\r\nMcClintock and George W. Guthrie we have had glimpses of, struggling,\r\nlike John Hampden, against their tyrants; but always for mere justice\r\nand in the courts, and all in vain, till in 1895 their exposures began\r\nto bring forth signs of public feeling, and they ventured to appeal to\r\nthe voters, the sources of the bosses’ power. They enlisted the\r\nvenerable Mr. Bruce and a few other brave men, and together called a\r\nmass-meeting. A crowd gathered. There were not many prominent men there,\r\nbut evidently the people were with them, and they then and there formed\r\nthe Municipal League, and launched it upon a campaign to beat the ring\r\nat the February election, 1896.\r\n\r\nA committee of five was put in charge—Bruce, McClintock, George K.\r\nStevenson, Dr. Pollock, and Otto Heeren—who combined with Mr. Guthrie’s\r\nsterling remnant of the Democratic party on an independent ticket, with\r\nMr. Guthrie at the head for mayor. It was a daring thing to do, and they\r\ndiscovered then what we have discovered in St. Louis and Minneapolis.\r\nMr. Bruce told me that, after their mass-meeting, men who should have\r\ncome out openly for the movement approached him by stealth and whispered\r\nthat he could count on them for money if he would keep secret their\r\nnames. “Outside of those at the meeting,” he said, “but one man of all\r\nthose that subscribed would let his name appear. And men who gave me\r\ninformation to use against the ring spoke themselves for the ring on the\r\nplatform.” Mr. McClintock in a paper read before a committee of the\r\nNational Municipal League says: “By far the most disheartening\r\ndiscovery, however, was that of the apathetic indifference of many\r\nrepresentative citizens—men who from every other point of view are\r\ndeservedly looked upon as model members of society. We found that\r\nprominent merchants and contractors who were ‘on the inside,’\r\nmanufacturers enjoying special municipal privileges, wealthy\r\ncapitalists, brokers, and others who were holders of the securities of\r\ntraction and other corporations, had their mouths stopped, their\r\nconvictions of duty strangled, and their influence before and votes on\r\nelection day preempted against us. In still another direction we found\r\nthat the financial and political support of the great steam railroads\r\nand largest manufacturing corporations, controlling as far as they were\r\nable the suffrages of their thousands of employees, were thrown against\r\nus, for the simple reason, as was frankly explained by one of them, that\r\nit was much easier to deal with a boss in promoting their corporate\r\ninterests than to deal directly with the people’s representatives in the\r\nmunicipal legislature. We even found the directors of many banks in an\r\nattitude of cold neutrality, if not of active hostility, toward any\r\nmovement for municipal reform. As one of them put it, ‘if you want to be\r\nanybody, or make money in Pittsburg, it is necessary to be in the\r\npolitical swim and on the side of the city ring.’”\r\n\r\nThis is corruption, but it is called “good business,” and it is worse\r\nthan politics.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarrel among the grafters of Minneapolis that gave the grand\r\njury a chance there. It was a low row among the grafters of St. Louis\r\nthat gave Joseph W. Folk his opening. And so in Pittsburg it was in a\r\nfight between Quay and Magee that the Municipal League saw its\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nTo Quay it was the other way around. The rising of the people of\r\nPittsburg was an opportunity for him. He and Magee had never got along\r\nwell together, and they were falling out and having their differences\r\nadjusted by Flinn and others every few years. The “mutual business\r\nadvantage” agreement was to have closed one of these rows. The fight of\r\n1895–96 was an especially bitter one, and it did not close with the\r\n“harmony” that was patched up. Magee and Flinn and Boss Martin of\r\nPhiladelphia set out to kill Quay politically, and he, driven thus into\r\none of those “fights for his life” which make his career so interesting,\r\nhearing the grumbling in Philadelphia and seeing the revolt of the\r\ncitizens of Pittsburg, stepped boldly forth upon a platform for reform,\r\nespecially to stop the “use of money for the corruption of our cities.”\r\nFrom Quay this was comical, but the Pittsburgers were too serious to\r\nlaugh. They were fighting for their life, too, so to speak, and the\r\nsight of a boss on their side must have encouraged those business men\r\nwho “found it easier to deal with a boss than with the people’s\r\nrepresentatives.” However that may be, a majority of the ballots cast in\r\nthe municipal election of Pittsburg in February, 1896, were against the\r\nring.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t history. According to the records the reform ticket was\r\ndefeated by about 1000 votes. The returns up to one o’clock on the\r\nmorning after election showed George W. Guthrie far ahead for mayor;\r\nthen all returns ceased suddenly, and when the count came in officially,\r\na few days later, the ring had won. But besides the _prima facie_\r\nevidence of fraud, the ringsters afterward told in confidence not only\r\nthat Mr. Guthrie was counted out, but how it was done. Mr. Guthrie’s\r\nappeal to the courts, however, for a recount was denied. The courts held\r\nthat the secret ballot law forbade the opening of the ballot boxes.\r\n\r\nThus the ring held Pittsburg—but not the Pittsburgers. They saw Quay in\r\ncontrol of the Legislature, Quay the reformer, who would help them. So\r\nthey drew a charter for Pittsburg which would restore the city to the\r\npeople. Quay saw the instrument, and he approved it; he promised to have\r\nit passed. The League, the Chamber of Commerce, and other representative\r\nbodies, all encouraged by the outlook for victory, sent to Harrisburg\r\ncommittees to urge their charter, and their orators poured forth upon\r\nthe Magee-Flinn ring a flood of, not invective, but facts,\r\nspecifications of outrage, and the abuse of absolute power. Their\r\ncharter went booming along through its first and second readings, Quay\r\nand the Magee-Flinn crowd fighting inch by inch. All looked well, when\r\nsuddenly there was silence. Quay was dealing with his enemies, and the\r\ncharter was his club. He wanted to go back to the Senate, and he went.\r\nThe Pittsburgers saw him elected, saw him go, but their charter they saw\r\nno more. And such is the State of Pennsylvania that this man who did\r\nthis thing to Pittsburg, and has done the like again and again to all\r\ncities and all interests—even politicians—he is the boss of Pennsylvania\r\nto-day!\r\n\r\nThe good men of Pittsburg gave up, and for four years the essential\r\nstory of the government of the city is a mere thread in the personal\r\nhistory of the quarrels of the bosses in State politics. Magee wanted to\r\ngo to the United States Senate, and he had with him Boss Martin and John\r\nWanamaker of Philadelphia, as well as his own Flinn. Quay turned on the\r\ncity bosses, and, undermining their power, soon had Martin beaten in\r\nPhiladelphia. To overthrow Magee was a harder task, and Quay might never\r\nhave accomplished it had not Magee’s health failed, causing him to be\r\nmuch away. Pittsburg was left to Flinn, and his masterfulness,\r\nunmitigated by Magee, made trouble. The crisis came out of a row Flinn\r\nhad with his Director of Public Works, E. M. Bigelow, a man as\r\ndictatorial as Flinn himself. Bigelow threw open to competition certain\r\ncontracts. Flinn, in exasperation, had the councils throw out the\r\ndirector and put in his place a man who restored the old specifications.\r\n\r\nThis enraged Thomas Steele Bigelow, E. M. Bigelow’s brother, and another\r\nnephew of old Squire Steele. Tom had an old grudge against Magee, dating\r\nfrom the early days of traction deals. He was rich, he knew something of\r\npolitics, and he believed in the power of money in the game. Going\r\nstraight to Harrisburg, he took charge of Quay’s fight for Senator,\r\nspent his own money and won; and he beat Magee, which was his first\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBut he was not satisfied yet. The Pittsburgers, aroused to fresh hope by\r\nthe new fight of the bosses, were encouraged also by the news that the\r\ncensus of 1900 put a second city, Scranton, into “cities of the second\r\nclass.” New laws had to be drawn for both. Pittsburg saw a chance for a\r\ngood charter. Tom Bigelow saw a chance to finish the Magee-Flinn ring,\r\nand he had William B. Rogers, a man whom the city trusted, draw the\r\nfamous “Ripper Bill”! This was originally a good charter, concentrating\r\npower in the mayor, but changes were introduced into it to enable the\r\nGovernor to remove and appoint mayors, or recorders, as they were to be\r\ncalled, at will until April, 1903, when the first elected recorder was\r\nto take office. This was Bigelow’s device to rid Pittsburg of the ring\r\noffice holders. But Magee was not dead yet. He and Flinn saw Governor\r\nStone, and when the Governor ripped out the ring mayor, he appointed as\r\nrecorder Major A. M. Brown, a lawyer well thought of in Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nMajor Brown, however, kept all but one of the ring heads of the\r\ndepartments. This disappointed the people; it was a defeat for Bigelow;\r\nfor the ring it was a triumph. Without Magee, however, Flinn could not\r\nhold his fellows in their joy, and they went to excesses which\r\nexasperated Major Brown and gave Bigelow an excuse for urging him to\r\naction. Major Brown suddenly removed the heads of the ring and began a\r\nthorough reorganization of the government. This reversed emotions, but\r\nnot for long. The ring leaders saw Governor Stone again, and he ripped\r\nout Bigelow’s Brown and appointed in his place a ring Brown. Thus the\r\nring was restored to full control under a charter which increased their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nBut the outrageous abuse of the Governor’s unusual power over the city\r\nincensed the people of Pittsburg. A postscript which Governor Stone\r\nadded to his announcement of the appointment of the new recorder did not\r\nhelp matters; it was a denial that he had been bribed. The Pittsburgers\r\nhad not heard of any bribery, but the postscript gave currency to a\r\ndefinite report that the ring—its banks, its corporations, and its\r\nbosses—had raised an enormous fund to pay the Governor for his\r\ninterference in the city, and this pointed the intense feelings of the\r\ncitizens. They prepared to beat the ring at an election to be held in\r\nFebruary, 1902, for Comptroller and half of the councils. A Citizens’\r\nparty was organized. The campaign was an excited one; both sides did\r\ntheir best, and the vote polled was the largest ever known in Pittsburg.\r\nEven the ring made a record. The citizens won, however, and by a\r\nmajority of 8,000.\r\n\r\nThis showed the people what they could do when they tried, and they were\r\nso elated that they went into the next election and carried the\r\ncounty—the stronghold of the ring. But they now had a party to look out\r\nfor, and they did not look out for it. They neglected it just as they\r\nhad the city. Tom Bigelow knew the value of a majority party; he had\r\nappreciated the Citizens’ from the start. Indeed he may have started it.\r\nAll the reformers know is that the committee which called the Citizens’\r\nParty into existence was made up of twenty-five men—five old Municipal\r\nLeaguers, the rest a “miscellaneous lot.” They did not bother then about\r\nthat. They knew Tom Bigelow, but he did not show himself, and the new\r\nparty went on confidently with its passionate work.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the great election, that for recorder this year\r\n(1903), the citizens woke up one day and found Tom Bigelow the boss of\r\ntheir party. How he came there they did not exactly know; but there he\r\nwas in full possession, and there with him was the “miscellaneous lot”\r\non the committee. Moreover, Bigelow was applying with vigor regular\r\nmachine methods. It was all very astonishing, but very significant.\r\nMagee was dead; Flinn’s end was in sight; but there was the Boss, the\r\neverlasting American Boss, as large as life. The good citizens were\r\nshocked; their dilemma was ridiculous, but it was serious too. Helpless,\r\nthey watched. Bigelow nominated for recorder a man they never would have\r\nchosen. Flinn put up a better man, hoping to catch the citizens, and\r\nwhen these said they could see Flinn behind his candidate, he said, “No;\r\nI am out of politics. When Magee died I died politically, too.” Nobody\r\nwould believe him. The decent Democrats hoped to retrieve their party\r\nand offer a way out, but Bigelow went into their convention with his\r\nmoney and the wretched old organization sold out. The smell of money on\r\nthe Citizens’ side attracted to it the grafters, the rats from Flinn’s\r\nsinking ship; many of the corporations went over, and pretty soon it was\r\nunderstood that the railroads had come to a settlement among themselves\r\nand with the new boss, on the basis of an agreement said to contain five\r\nspecifications of grants from the city. The temptation to vote for\r\nFlinn’s man was strong, but the old reformers seemed to feel that the\r\nonly thing to do was to finish Flinn now and take care of Tom Bigelow\r\nlater. This view prevailed and Tom Bigelow won. This is the way the best\r\nmen in Pittsburg put it: “We have smashed a ring and we have wound\r\nanother around us. Now we have got to smash that.”\r\n\r\nThere is the spirit of this city as I understand it. Craven as it was\r\nfor years, corrupted high and low, Pittsburg did rise; it shook off the\r\nsuperstition of partisanship in municipal politics; beaten, it rose\r\nagain; and now, when it might have boasted of a triumph, it saw\r\nstraight: a defeat. The old fighters, undeceived and undeceiving,\r\nhumiliated but undaunted, said simply: “All we have got to do is to\r\nbegin all over again.” Meanwhile, however, Pittsburg has developed some\r\nyoung men, and with an inheritance of this same spirit, they are going\r\nto try out in their own way. The older men undertook to save the city\r\nwith a majority party and they lost the party. The younger men have\r\nformed a Voters’ Civic League, which proposes to swing from one party to\r\nanother that minority of disinterested citizens which is always willing\r\nto be led, and thus raise the standard of candidates and improve the\r\ncharacter of regular party government. Tom Bigelow intended to capture\r\nthe old Flinn organization, combine it with his Citizens’ party, and\r\nrule as Magee did with one party, a union of all parties. If he should\r\ndo this, the young reformers would have no two parties to choose\r\nbetween; but there stand the old fighters ready to rebuild a Citizens’\r\nparty under that or any other name. Whatever course is taken, however,\r\nsomething will be done in Pittsburg, or tried, at least, for good\r\ngovernment, and after the cowardice and corruption shamelessly displayed\r\nin other cities, the effort of Pittsburg, pitiful as it is, is a\r\nspectacle good for American self-respect, and its sturdiness is a\r\npromise for poor old Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PHILADELPHIA: CORRUPT AND CONTENTED\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (_July, 1903_)\r\n\r\nOther American cities, no matter how bad their own condition may be, all\r\npoint with scorn to Philadelphia as worse—“the worst-governed city in\r\nthe country.” St. Louis, Minneapolis, Pittsburg submit with some\r\npatience to the jibes of any other community; the most friendly\r\nsuggestion from Philadelphia is rejected with contempt. The\r\nPhiladelphians are “supine,” “asleep”; hopelessly ring-ruled, they are\r\n“complacent.” “Politically benighted,” Philadelphia is supposed to have\r\nno light to throw upon a state of things that is almost universal.\r\n\r\nThis is not fair. Philadelphia is, indeed, corrupt; but it is not\r\nwithout significance. Every city and town in the country can learn\r\nsomething from the typical political experience of this great\r\nrepresentative city. New York is excused for many of its ills because it\r\nis the metropolis, Chicago because of its forced development;\r\nPhiladelphia is our “third largest” city and its growth has been gradual\r\nand natural. Immigration has been blamed for our municipal conditions;\r\nPhiladelphia, with 47 per cent. of its population native-born of\r\nnative-born parents, is the most American of our greater cities. It is\r\n“good,” too, and intelligent. I don’t know just how to measure the\r\nintelligence of a community, but a Pennsylvania college professor who\r\ndeclared to me his belief in education for the masses as a way out of\r\npolitical corruption, himself justified the “rake-off” of preferred\r\ncontractors on public works on the ground of a “fair business profit.”\r\nAnother plea we have made is that we are too busy to attend to public\r\nbusiness, and we have promised, when we come to wealth and leisure, to\r\ndo better. Philadelphia has long enjoyed great and widely distributed\r\nprosperity; it is the city of homes; there is a dwelling house for every\r\nfive persons,—men, women, and children,—of the population; and the\r\npeople give one a sense of more leisure and repose than any community I\r\never dwelt in. Some Philadelphians account for their political state on\r\nthe ground of their ease and comfort. There is another class of\r\noptimists whose hope is in an “aristocracy” that is to come by and by;\r\nPhiladelphia is surer that it has a “real aristocracy” than any other\r\nplace in the world, but its aristocrats, with few exceptions, are in the\r\nring, with it, or of no political use. Then we hear that we are a young\r\npeople and that when we are older and “have traditions,” like some of\r\nthe old countries, we also will be honest. Philadelphia is one of the\r\noldest of our cities and treasures for us scenes and relics of some of\r\nthe noblest traditions of “our fair land.” Yet I was told how once, “for\r\na joke,” a party of boodlers counted out the “divvy” of their graft in\r\nunison with the ancient chime of Independence Hall.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia is representative. This very “joke,” told, as it was, with\r\na laugh, is typical. All our municipal governments are more or less bad,\r\nand all our people are optimists. Philadelphia is simply the most\r\ncorrupt and the most contented. Minneapolis has cleaned up, Pittsburg\r\nhas tried to, New York fights every other election, Chicago fights all\r\nthe time. Even St. Louis has begun to stir (since the elections are\r\nover), and at the worst was only shameless. Philadelphia is proud; good\r\npeople there defend corruption and boast of their machine. My college\r\nprofessor, with his philosophic view of “rake-offs,” is one Philadelphia\r\ntype. Another is the man, who, driven to bay with his local pride, says:\r\n“At least you must admit that our machine is the best you have ever\r\nseen.”\r\n\r\nDisgraceful? Other cities say so. But I say that if Philadelphia is a\r\ndisgrace, it is a disgrace not to itself alone, nor to Pennsylvania, but\r\nto the United States and to American character. For this great city, so\r\nhighly representative in other respects, is not behind in political\r\nexperience, but ahead, with New York. Philadelphia is a city that has\r\nhad its reforms. Having passed through all the typical stages of\r\ncorruption, Philadelphia reached the period of miscellaneous loot with a\r\nboss for chief thief, under James McManes and the Gas Ring ‘way back in\r\nthe late sixties and seventies. This is the Tweed stage of corruption\r\nfrom which St. Louis, for example, is just emerging. Philadelphia, in\r\ntwo inspiring popular revolts, attacked the Gas Ring, broke it, and in\r\n1885 achieved that dream of American cities—a good charter. The present\r\ncondition of Philadelphia, therefore, is not that which precedes, but\r\nthat which follows reform, and in this distinction lies its startling\r\ngeneral significance. What has happened since the Bullitt Law or charter\r\nwent into effect in Philadelphia may happen in any American city “after\r\nreform is over.”\r\n\r\nFor reform with us is usually revolt, not government, and is soon over.\r\nOur people do not seek, they avoid self-rule, and “reforms” are\r\nspasmodic efforts to punish bad rulers and get somebody that will give\r\nus good government or something that will make it. A self-acting form of\r\ngovernment is an ancient superstition. We are an inventive people, and\r\nwe all think that we shall devise some day a legal machine that will\r\nturn out good government automatically. The Philadelphians have\r\ntreasured this belief longer than the rest of us and have tried it more\r\noften. Throughout their history they have sought this wonderful charter\r\nand they thought they had it when they got the Bullitt Law, which\r\nconcentrates in the mayor ample power, executive and political, and\r\ncomplete responsibility. Moreover, it calls for very little thought and\r\naction on the part of the people. All they expected to have to do when\r\nthe Bullitt Law went into effect was to elect as mayor a good business\r\nman, who, with his probity and common sense, would give them that good\r\nbusiness administration which is the ideal of many reformers.\r\n\r\nThe Bullitt Law went into effect in 1887. A committee of twelve—four men\r\nfrom the Union League, four from business organizations, and four from\r\nthe bosses—picked out the first man to run under it on the Republican\r\nticket, Edwin H. Fitler, an able, upright business man, and he was\r\nelected. Strange to say, his administration was satisfactory to the\r\ncitizens, who speak well of it to this day, and to the politicians also;\r\nBoss McManes (the ring was broken, not the boss) took to the next\r\nnational convention from Philadelphia a delegation solid for Fitler for\r\nPresident of the United States. It was a farce, but it pleased Mr.\r\nFitler, so Matthew S. Quay, the State boss, let him have a complimentary\r\nvote on the first ballot. The politicians “fooled” Mr. Fitler, and they\r\n“fooled” also the next business mayor, Edwin S. Stuart, likewise a most\r\nestimable gentleman. Under these two administrations the foundation was\r\nlaid for the present government of Philadelphia, the corruption to which\r\nPhiladelphians seem so reconciled, and the machine which is “at least\r\nthe best you have ever seen.”\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia machine isn’t the best. It isn’t sound, and I doubt if\r\nit would stand in New York or Chicago. The enduring strength of the\r\ntypical American political machine is that it is a natural growth—a\r\nsucker, but deep-rooted in the people. The New Yorkers vote for Tammany\r\nHall. The Philadelphians do not vote; they are disfranchised, and their\r\ndisfranchisement is one anchor of the foundation of the Philadelphia\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThis is no figure of speech. The honest citizens of Philadelphia have no\r\nmore rights at the polls than the negroes down South. Nor do they fight\r\nvery hard for this basic privilege. You can arouse their Republican ire\r\nby talking about the black Republican votes lost in the Southern States\r\nby white Democratic intimidation, but if you remind the average\r\nPhiladelphian that he is in the same position, he will look startled,\r\nthen say, “That’s so, that’s literally true, only I never thought of it\r\nin just that way.” And it is literally true.\r\n\r\nThe machine controls the whole process of voting, and practices fraud at\r\nevery stage. The assessor’s list is the voting list, and the assessor is\r\nthe machine’s man. “The assessor of a division kept a disorderly house;\r\nhe padded his lists with fraudulent names registered from his house; two\r\nof these names were used by election officers.... The constable of the\r\ndivision kept a disreputable house; a policeman was assessed as living\r\nthere.... The election was held in the disorderly house maintained by\r\nthe assessor.... The man named as judge had a criminal charge for a life\r\noffense pending against him.... Two hundred and fifty-two votes were\r\nreturned in a division that had less than one hundred legal votes within\r\nits boundaries.” These extracts from a report of the Municipal League\r\nsuggest the election methods. The assessor pads the list with the names\r\nof dead dogs, children, and non-existent persons. One newspaper printed\r\nthe picture of a dog, another that of a little four-year-old negro boy,\r\ndown on such a list. A ring orator in a speech resenting sneers at his\r\nward as “low down” reminded his hearers that that was the ward of\r\nIndependence Hall, and, naming over signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, he closed his highest flight of eloquence with the\r\nstatement that “these men, the fathers of American liberty, voted down\r\nhere once. And,” he added, with a catching grin, “they vote here yet.”\r\nRudolph Blankenburg, a persistent fighter for the right and the use of\r\nthe right to vote (and, by the way, an immigrant), sent out just before\r\none election a registered letter to each voter on the rolls of a certain\r\nselected division. Sixty-three per cent. were returned marked “not at,”\r\n“removed,” “deceased,” etc. From one four-story house where forty-four\r\nvoters were addressed, eighteen letters came back undelivered; from\r\nanother of forty-eight voters, came back forty-one letters; from another\r\nsixty-one out of sixty-two; from another, forty-four out of forty-seven.\r\nSix houses in one division were assessed at one hundred and seventy-two\r\nvoters, more than the votes cast in the previous election in any one of\r\ntwo hundred entire divisions.\r\n\r\nThe repeating is done boldly, for the machine controls the election\r\nofficers, often choosing them from among the fraudulent names; and when\r\nno one appears to serve, assigning the heeler ready for the expected\r\nvacancy. The police are forbidden by law to stand within thirty feet of\r\nthe polls, but they are at the box and they are there to see that the\r\nmachine’s orders are obeyed and that repeaters whom they help to furnish\r\nare permitted to vote without “intimidation” on the names they, the\r\npolice, have supplied. The editor of an anti-machine paper who was\r\nlooking about for himself once told me that a ward leader who knew him\r\nwell asked him into a polling place. “I’ll show you how it’s done,” he\r\nsaid, and he had the repeaters go round and round voting again and again\r\non the names handed them on slips. “But,” as the editor said, “that\r\nisn’t the way it’s done.” The repeaters go from one polling place to\r\nanother, voting on slips, and on their return rounds change coats, hats,\r\netc. The business proceeds with very few hitches; there is more jesting\r\nthan fighting. Violence in the past has had its effect; and is not often\r\nnecessary nowadays, but if it is needed the police are there to apply\r\nit. Several citizens told me that they had seen the police help to beat\r\ncitizens or election officers who were trying to do their duty, then\r\narrest the victim; and Mr. Clinton Rogers Woodruff, the executive\r\ncounsel of the Municipal League, has published a booklet of such cases.\r\nBut an official statement of the case is at hand in an announcement by\r\nJohn Weaver, the new machine mayor of Philadelphia, that he is going to\r\nkeep the police out of politics and away from the polls. “I shall see,”\r\nhe added, “that every voter enjoys the full right of suffrage and that\r\nballots may be placed in the ballot box without fear of intimidation.”\r\n\r\nBut many Philadelphians do not try to vote. They leave everything to the\r\nmachine, and the machine casts their ballots for them. It is estimated\r\nthat 150,000 voters did not go to the polls at the last election. Yet\r\nthe machine rolled up a majority of 130,000 for Weaver, with a\r\nfraudulent vote estimated all the way from forty to eighty thousand, and\r\nthis in a campaign so machine-made that it was called “no contest.”\r\nFrancis Fisher Kane, the Democrat, got 32,000 votes out of some 204,000.\r\n“What is the use of voting?” these stay-at-homes ask. A friend of mine\r\ntold me he was on the lists in the three wards in which he had\r\nsuccessively dwelt. He votes personally in none, but the leader of his\r\npresent ward tells him how he has been voted. Mr. J. C. Reynolds, the\r\nproprietor of the St. James Hotel, went to the polls at eleven o’clock\r\nlast election day, only to be told that he had been voted. He asked how\r\nmany others from his house had voted. An election officer took up a\r\nlist, checked off twelve names, two down twice, and handed it to him.\r\nWhen Mr. Reynolds got home he learned that one of these had voted, the\r\nothers had been voted. Another man said he rarely attempted to vote, but\r\nwhen he did, the officers let him, even though his name had already been\r\nvoted on; and then the negro repeaters would ask if his “brother was\r\ncoming ‘round to-day.” They were going to vote him, as they vote all\r\ngood-natured citizens who stay away. “When this kind of man turns out,”\r\nsaid a leader to me, “we simply have two repeaters extra—one to balance\r\nhim and one more to the good.” If necessary, after all this, the machine\r\ncounts the vote “right,” and there is little use appealing to the\r\ncourts, since they have held, except in one case, that the ballot box is\r\nsecret and cannot be opened. The only legal remedy lies in the purging\r\nof the assessor’s lists, and when the Municipal League had this done in\r\n1899, they reported that there was “wholesale voting on the very names\r\nstricken off.”\r\n\r\nDeprived of self-government, the Philadelphians haven’t even\r\nself-governing machine government. They have their own boss, but he and\r\nhis machine are subject to the State ring, and take their orders from\r\nthe State boss, Matthew S. Quay, who is the proprietor of Pennsylvania\r\nand the real ruler of Philadelphia, just as William Penn, the Great\r\nProprietor, was. Philadelphians, especially the local bosses, dislike\r\nthis description of their government, and they point for refutation to\r\ntheir charter. But this very Bullitt Law was passed by Quay, and he put\r\nit through the Legislature, not for reform reasons, but at the instance\r\nof David H. Lane, his Philadelphia lieutenant, as a check upon the power\r\nof Boss McManes. Later, when McManes proved hopelessly insubordinate,\r\nQuay decided to have done with him forever. He chose David Martin for\r\nboss, and from his seat in the United States Senate, Penn’s successor\r\nraised up his man and set him over the people. Croker, who rose by his\r\nown strength to the head of Tammany Hall, has tried twice to appoint a\r\nsuccessor; no one else could, and he failed. The boss of Tammany Hall is\r\na growth. So Croker has attempted to appoint district leaders and\r\nfailed; a Tammany district leader is a growth. Boss Martin, picked up\r\nand set down from above, was accepted by Philadelphia and the\r\nPhiladelphia machine, and he removed old ward leaders and appointed new\r\nones. Some leaders in Philadelphia own their wards, of course, but\r\nMartin and, after him, Durham have sent men into a ward to lead it, and\r\nthey have led it.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia organization is upside down. It has its root in the\r\nair, or, rather, like the banyan tree, it sends its roots from the\r\ncenter out both up and down and all around, and there lies its peculiar\r\nstrength. For when I said it was dependent and not sound, I did not mean\r\nthat it was weak. It is dependent as a municipal machine, but the\r\norganization that rules Philadelphia is, as we have seen, not a mere\r\nmunicipal machine, but a city, State, and national organization. The\r\npeople of Philadelphia are Republicans in a Republican city in a\r\nRepublican State in a Republican nation, and they are bound ring on ring\r\non ring. The President of the United States and his patronage; the\r\nNational Cabinet and their patronage; the Congress and the patronage of\r\nthe Senators and the Congressmen from Pennsylvania; the Governor of the\r\nState and the State legislature with their powers and patronage; and all\r\nthat the mayor and city councils have of power and patronage—all these\r\nbear down upon Philadelphia to keep it in the control of Quay’s boss and\r\nhis little ring. This is the ideal of party organization, and, possibly,\r\nis the end toward which our democratic republic is tending. If it is,\r\nthe end is absolutism. Nothing but a revolution could overthrow this\r\noligarchy, and there is its danger. With no outlet at the polls for\r\npublic feeling, the machine cannot be taught anything it does not know\r\nexcept at the cost of annihilation.\r\n\r\nBut the Philadelphia machine-leaders know their business. As I said in\r\n“Tweed Days in St. Louis,” the politicians will learn, if the people\r\nwon’t, from exposure and reform. The Pennsylvania bosses learned the\r\n“uses of reform”; we have seen Quay applying it to discipline McManes,\r\nand he since has turned reformer himself, to punish local bosses. The\r\nbosses have learned also the danger of combination between citizens and\r\nthe Democrats. To prevent this, Quay and his friends have spread\r\nsedulously the doctrine of “reform within the party,” and, from the\r\nCommittee of One Hundred on, the reformers have stuck pretty faithfully\r\nto this principle. But lest the citizens should commit such a sin\r\nagainst their party, Martin formed a permanent combination of the\r\nDemocratic with the Republican organization, using to that end a goodly\r\nshare of the Federal and county patronage. Thus the people of\r\nPhiladelphia were “fixed” so that they couldn’t vote if they wanted to,\r\nand if they should want to, they couldn’t vote for a Democrat, except of\r\nRepublican or independent choosing. In other words, having taken away\r\ntheir ballot, the bosses took away also the choice of parties.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest lesson learned and applied was that of conciliation and\r\n“good government.” The people must not want to vote or rebel against the\r\nring. This ring, like any other, was formed for the exploitation of the\r\ncity for private profit, and the cementing force is the “cohesive power\r\nof public plunder.” But McManes and Tweed had proved that miscellaneous\r\nlarceny was dangerous, and why should a lot of cheap politicians get so\r\nmuch and the people nothing at all? The people had been taught to expect\r\nbut little from their rulers: good water, good light, clean streets well\r\npaved, fair transportation, the decent repression of vice, public order\r\nand public safety, and no scandalous or open corruption, would more than\r\nsatisfy them. It would be good business and good politics to give them\r\nthese things. Like Chris Magee, who studied out the problem with him,\r\nMartin took away from the rank and file of the party and from the ward\r\nleaders and office holders the privilege of theft, and he formed\r\ncompanies and groups to handle the legitimate public business of the\r\ncity. It was all graft, but it was to be all lawful, and, in the main,\r\nit was. Public franchises, public works, and public contracts were the\r\nprincipal branches of the business, and Martin adopted the dual boss\r\nidea, which we have seen worked out by Magee and Flinn in Pittsburg. In\r\nPhiladelphia it was Martin and Porter, and just as Flinn had a firm,\r\nBooth & Flinn, Ltd., so Porter was Filbert and Porter.\r\n\r\nFilbert and Porter got all the public contracts they could handle, and\r\nthe rest went to other contractors friendly to them and to the ring.\r\nSometimes the preferred contractor was the lowest bidder, but he did not\r\nhave to be. The law allowed awards to be the “lowest and best,” and the\r\ncourts held that this gave the officials discretion. But since public\r\ncriticism was to be considered, the ring, to keep up appearances,\r\nresorted to many tricks. One was to have fake bids made above the\r\nfavorite. Another was to have the favorite bid high, but set an\r\nimpossible time limit; the department of the city councils could extend\r\nthe time afterwards. Still another was to arrange for specifications\r\nwhich would make outsiders bid high, then either openly alter the plans\r\nor let the ring firm perform work not up to requirements.\r\n\r\nMany of Martin’s deals and jobs were scandals, but they were safe; they\r\nwere in the direction of public service; and the great mass of the\r\nbusiness was done quietly. Moreover, the public was getting something\r\nfor its money,—not full value, but a good percentage. In other words,\r\nthere was a limit to the “rake-off,” and some insiders have told me that\r\nit had been laid down as a principle with the ring that the people\r\nshould have in value (that is, in work or benefit, including a fair\r\nprofit) ninety-five cents out of every dollar. In some of the deals I\r\nhave investigated, the “rake-off” over and above profit was as high as\r\ntwenty-five per cent. Still, even at this, there was “a limit,” and the\r\npublic was getting, as one of the leaders told me, “a run for its\r\nmoney.” Cynical as it all sounds, this view is taken by many\r\nPhiladelphians almost if not quite as intelligent as my college\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nBut there was another element in the policy of conciliation which is a\r\npotent factor in the contentment of Philadelphia, and I regard it as the\r\nkey to that “apathy” which has made the community notorious. We have\r\nseen how Quay had with him the Federal resources and those of the State,\r\nand the State ring, and we have seen how Martin, having the city, mayor,\r\nand councils, won over the Democratic city leaders. Here they had under\r\npay in office at least 15,000 men and women. But each of these 15,000\r\npersons was selected for office because he could deliver votes, either\r\nby organizations, by parties, or by families. These must represent\r\npretty near a majority of the city’s voters. But this is by no means the\r\nend of the ring’s reach. In the State ring are the great corporations,\r\nthe Standard Oil Company, Cramp’s Shipyard, and the steel companies,\r\nwith the Pennsylvania Railroad at their head, and all the local\r\ntransportation and other public utility companies following after. They\r\nget franchises, privileges, exemptions, etc.; they have helped finance\r\nQuay through deals: the Pennsylvania paid Martin, Quay said once, a\r\nlarge yearly salary; the Cramps get contracts to build United States\r\nships, and for years have been begging for a subsidy on home-made ships.\r\nThe officers, directors, and stockholders of these companies, with their\r\nfriends, their bankers, and their employees, are of the organization.\r\nBetter still, one of the local bosses of Philadelphia told me he could\r\nalways give a worker a job with these companies, just as he could in a\r\ncity department, or in the mint, or post-office. Then there are the\r\nbankers who enjoy, or may some day enjoy, public deposits; those that\r\nprofit on loans to finance political financial deals; the promoting\r\ncapitalists who share with the bosses on franchises; and the brokers who\r\ndeal in ring securities and speculate upon ring tips. Through the\r\nexchange the ring financiers reach the investing public, which is a\r\nlarge and influential body. The traction companies, which bought their\r\nway from beginning to end by corruption, which have always been in the\r\nring, and whose financiers have usually shared in other big ring deals,\r\nadopted early the policy of bribing the people with “small blocks of\r\nstock.” Dr. Frederick Speirs, in his “The Street Railway System of\r\nPhiladelphia,” came upon transactions which “indicate clearly that it is\r\nthe policy of the Union Company to get the securities into the hands of\r\na large number of small holders, the plain inference being that a wide\r\ndistribution of securities will fortify the company against possible\r\nattacks by the public.” In 1895 he found a director saying: “Our critics\r\nhave engaged the Academy of Music, and are to call an assemblage of\r\npeople opposed to the street railways as now managed. It would take\r\neight Academies of Music to hold the stockholders of the Union Traction\r\nCompany.”\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet through. Quay has made a specialty all his life of\r\nreformers, and he and his local bosses have won over so many that the\r\nlist of former reformers is very, very long. Martin drove down his roots\r\nthrough race and religion, too. Philadelphia was one of the hot-beds of\r\n“know-nothingism.” Martin recognized the Catholic, and the Irish-Irish,\r\nand so drew off into the Republican party the great natural supply of\r\nthe Democrats; and his successors have given high places to\r\nrepresentative Jews. “Surely this isn’t corruption!” No, and neither is\r\nthat corruption which makes the heads of great educational and charity\r\ninstitutions “go along,” as they say in Pennsylvania, in order to get\r\nappropriations for their institutions from the State and land from the\r\ncity. They know what is going on, but they do not join reform movements.\r\nThe provost of the University of Pennsylvania declined to join in a\r\nrevolt because, he said, it might impair his usefulness to the\r\nUniversity. And so it is with others, and with clergymen who have\r\nfavorite charities; with Sabbath associations and City Beautiful clubs;\r\nwith lawyers who want briefs; with real estate dealers who like to know\r\nin advance about public improvements, and real estate owners who\r\nappreciate light assessments; with shop-keepers who don’t want to be\r\nbothered with strict inspections.\r\n\r\nIf there is no other hold for the ring on a man there always is the\r\nprotective tariff. “I don’t care,” said a manufacturer. “What if they do\r\nplunder and rob us, it can’t hurt me unless they raise the tax rates,\r\nand even that won’t ruin me. Our party keeps up the tariff. If they\r\nshould reduce that, my business would be ruined.”\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the ramifications of this machine, such is its strength.\r\nNo wonder Martin could break his own rules, as he did, and commit\r\nexcesses. Philadelphia is not merely corrupt, it is corrupted. Martin’s\r\ndoom was proclaimed not in Philadelphia, but in the United States\r\nSenate, and his offense was none of this business of his, but his\r\nfailure to nominate as successor to Mayor Stuart the man, Boise Penrose,\r\nwhom Matt Quay chose for that place. Martin had consented, but at the\r\nlast moment he ordered the nomination of Charles F. Warwick instead. The\r\nday that happened Mr. Quay arose on the floor of the Senate and, in a\r\nspeech so irrelevant to the measure under consideration that nobody out\r\nof Pennsylvania understood it, said that there was in his town a man who\r\nhad given as his reason for not doing what he had promised to do, the\r\nexcuse that he was “under a heavy salary from a great corporation (the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad) and was compelled to do what the corporation\r\nwished him to do. And,” added Senator Quay, “men in such a position with\r\nhigh power for good or evil ought ... to go about ... with the dollar\r\nmark of the corporation on their foreheads.” Quay named an the new boss\r\nIsrael W. Durham, a ward leader under Martin.\r\n\r\nMartin having the city through Mayor Warwick fought Quay in the State,\r\nwith Chris Magee for an ally, but Quay beat them both there, and then\r\nprepared to beat them in their own cities. His cry was Reform, and he\r\nsoon had the people shouting for it.\r\n\r\nQuay responded with a Legislative committee to investigate abuses in the\r\ncities, but this so-called “Lexow” was called off before it amounted to\r\nmuch more than a momentary embarrassment to Martin. Martin’s friends, on\r\nthe other hand, caught Quay and nearly sent him to prison. The People’s\r\nBank, James McManes, president, failed. The cashier, John S. Hopkins,\r\nhad been speculating and letting Quay and other politicians have bank\r\nfunds without collateral for stock gambling. In return Quay and the\r\nState Treasurer left heavy State deposits with the bank. Hopkins lost\r\nhis nerve and shot himself. McManes happened to call in friends of\r\nMartin to advise him, and these suggested a Martin man for receiver.\r\nThey found among the items money lent to Quay without security, except\r\nthe State funds, and telegrams asking Hopkins to buy “1000 Met”\r\n(Metropolitan) and promising in return to “shake the plum tree.” Quay,\r\nhis son, Richard R., and Benjamin J. Haywood, the State Treasurer, were\r\nindicted for conspiracy, and every effort was made to have the trial\r\nprecede the next election for the Legislature which was to elect a\r\nsuccessor to Quay in the United States Senate; but Quay got stays and\r\npostponements in the hopes that a more friendly District Attorney could\r\nbe put in that office. Martin secured the election of Peter F.\r\nRothermel, who was eager to try the case, and Quay had to depend on\r\nother resources. The trial came in due course, and failed; Judge Biddle\r\nruled out the essential evidence on the ground that it was excluded by\r\nthe statute of limitation. Rothermel went on with the trial, but it was\r\nhopeless; Quay was acquitted and the other cases were abandoned.\r\n\r\nPopular feeling was excited by this exposure of Quay, but there was no\r\naction till the factional fighting suggested a use for it. Quay had\r\nrefused the second United States Senatorship to John Wanamaker, and\r\nWanamaker led through the State and in Philadelphia a fight against the\r\nboss, which has never ceased. It took the form of a reform campaign, and\r\nQuay’s methods were made plain, but the boss beat Wanamaker at every\r\npoint, had Penrose made Senator, and through Penrose and Durham was\r\ngradually getting possession of Philadelphia. The final triumph came\r\nwith the election of Samuel H. Ashbridge as mayor.\r\n\r\n“Stars-and-Stripes Sam,” as Ashbridge is sometimes called, was a\r\nspeech-maker and a “joiner.” That is to say, he made a practice of going\r\nto lodges, associations, brotherhoods, Sunday-schools, and all sorts of\r\npublic and private meetings, joining some, but making at all speeches\r\npatriotic and sentimental. He was very popular. Under the Bullitt Law,\r\nas I have said, all that is necessary to a good administration and\r\ncomplete, though temporary reform, is a good mayor. The politicians feel\r\nthat they must nominate a man in whom the people as well as themselves\r\nhave faith. They had had faith in Warwick, both the ring and the people,\r\nand Warwick had found it impossible to satisfy two such masters. Now\r\nthey put their faith in Ashbridge, and so did Durham, and so did Martin.\r\nAll interests accepted him, therefore, and all watched him with hope and\r\nmore or less assurance; none more than the good people. And, indeed, no\r\nman could have promised more or better public service than Ashbridge.\r\nThe result, however, was distracting.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashbridge “threw down” Martin, and he recognized Quay’s man, “Is”\r\nDurham, as the political boss. Durham is a high type of boss, candid,\r\nbut of few words; generous, but businesslike; complete master of\r\nhimself, and a genius at organization. For Pennsylvania politics he is a\r\nconservative leader, and there would have been no excesses under him, as\r\nthere have been few “rows.” But Mr. Durham has not been the master of\r\nthe Philadelphia situation. He bowed to Quay, and he could not hold\r\nAshbridge. Philadelphians say that if it should come to a fight, Durham\r\ncould beat Quay in Philadelphia, but it doesn’t come to a fight. Another\r\nthing Philadelphians say is that he “keeps his word,” yet he broke it\r\n(with notice) when Quay asked him to stand for Pennypacker for Governor.\r\nAs I said before, however, Philadelphia is so constituted that it\r\napparently cannot have self-government, not even its own boss, so that\r\nthe allegiance paid to Quay is comprehensible. But the submission of the\r\nboss to the mayor was extraordinary, and it seemed to some sagacious\r\npoliticians dangerous.\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Ashbridge broke through all the principles of moderate grafting\r\ndeveloped by Martin. Durham formed his ring—taking in James P. McNichol\r\nas co-ruler and preferred contractor; John M. Mack as promoter and\r\nfinancier; and he widened the inside circle to include more individuals.\r\nBut while he was more liberal toward his leaders, and not inclined “to\r\ngrab off everything for himself,” as one leader told me, he maintained\r\nthe principle of concentration and strict control as good politics and\r\ngood business. So, too, he adopted Martin’s programme of public\r\nimprovements, the filtration, boulevards, etc., and he added to it. When\r\nAshbridge was well settled in office, these schemes were all started,\r\nand the mayor pushed them with a will. According to the “Philadelphia\r\nPlan,” the mayor should not be in the ring. He should be an ambitious\r\nman, and his reward promotion, not riches. If he is “out for the stuff,”\r\nhe is likely to be hurried by the fretful thought that his term is\r\nlimited to four years, and since he cannot succeed himself as mayor, his\r\ninterest in the future of the machine is less than that of a boss, who\r\ngoes on forever.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nominated, Ashbridge had debts of record amounting to some\r\n$40,000. Before he was elected these were satisfied. Soon after he took\r\noffice he declared himself to former Postmaster Thomas L. Hicks. Here is\r\nMr. Hicks’s account of the incident:\r\n\r\n“At one of the early interviews I had with the mayor in his office, he\r\nsaid to me: ‘Tom, I have been elected mayor of Philadelphia. I have four\r\nyears to serve. I have no further ambitions. I want no other office when\r\nI am out of this one, and I shall get out of this office all there is in\r\nit for Samuel H. Ashbridge.’\r\n\r\n“I remarked that this was a very foolish thing to say. ‘Think how that\r\ncould be construed,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t care anything about that,’ he declared. ‘I mean to get out of\r\nthis office everything there is in it for Samuel H. Ashbridge.’”\r\n\r\nWhen he retired from office last April, he became the president of a\r\nbank, and was reputed to be rich. Here is the summary published by the\r\nMunicipal League at the close of his labors:\r\n\r\n“The four years of the Ashbridge administration have passed into\r\nhistory, leaving behind them a scar on the fame and reputation of our\r\ncity which will be a long time healing. Never before, and let us hope\r\nnever again, will there be such brazen defiance of public opinion, such\r\nflagrant disregard of public interest, such abuse of powers and\r\nresponsibilities for private ends. These are not generalizations, but\r\neach statement can be abundantly proved by numerous instances.”\r\n\r\nThese “numerous instances” are notorious in Philadelphia; some of them\r\nwere reported all over the country. One of them was the attempted\r\nintimidation of John Wanamaker. Thomas B. Wanamaker, John Wanamaker’s\r\nson, bought the _North American_, a newspaper which had been, and still\r\nis, exposing the abuses and corruption of the political ring. Abraham L.\r\nEnglish, Mr. Ashbridge’s Director of the Department of Public Safety,\r\ncalled on Mr. John Wanamaker, said he had been having him watched, and\r\nwas finally in a position to demand that the newspaper stop the attacks.\r\nThe merchant exposed the whole thing, and a committee appointed to\r\ninvestigate reported that: “Mr. English has practically admitted that he\r\nattempted to intimidate a reputable citizen and unlawfully threatened\r\nhim in an effort to silence criticism of a public newspaper; that from\r\nthe mayor’s refusal to order an investigation of the conduct of Mr.\r\nEnglish on the request of a town meeting of representative citizens, the\r\ncommunity is justified in regarding him as aiding and abetting Mr.\r\nEnglish in the corrupt act committed, and that the mayor is therefore to\r\nbe equally censured by the community.”\r\n\r\nThe other “instances of brazen abuse of power” were the increase of\r\nprotected vice—the importation from New York of the “white slavery\r\nsystem of prostitution,” the growth of “speak-easies,” and the spread of\r\ngambling and of policy-playing until it took in the school children.\r\nThis last the _North American_ exposed, but in vain till it named police\r\nofficers who had refused when asked to interfere. Then a judge summoned\r\nthe editors and reporters of the paper, the mayor, Director English,\r\nschool children, and police officers to appear before him. The mayor’s\r\npersonal attorney spoke for the police during the inquiry, and it looked\r\nblack for the newspaper till the children began to tell their stories.\r\nWhen the hearing was over the judge said:\r\n\r\n“The evidence shows conclusively that our public school system in this\r\ncity is in danger of being corrupted at its fountain; that in one of the\r\nschools over a hundred and fifty children were buyers of policy, as were\r\nalso a large number of scholars in other schools. It was first\r\ndiscovered about eighteen months ago, and for about one year has been in\r\nfull operation.” The police officers were not punished, however.\r\n\r\nThat corruption had reached the public schools and was spreading rapidly\r\nthrough the system, was discovered by the exposure and conviction of\r\nthree school directors of the twenty-eighth ward. It was known before\r\nthat teachers and principals, like any other office holders, had to have\r\na “pull” and pay assessments for election expenses. “Voluntary\r\ncontributions” was the term used, but over the notices in blue pencil\r\nwas written “2 per cent.,” and teachers who asked directors and ward\r\nbosses what to do, were advised that they would “better pay.” Those that\r\nsent less than the amount suggested, got receipts: “check received;\r\nshall we hold for balance or enter on account?” But the exposure in the\r\ntwenty-eighth ward brought it home to the parents of the children that\r\nthe teachers were not chosen for fitness, but for political reasons, and\r\nthat the political reasons had become cash.\r\n\r\nMiss Rena A. Haydock testified as follows: “I went to see Mr. Travis,\r\nwho was a friend of mine, in reference to getting a teacher’s\r\ncertificate. He advised me to see all of the directors, especially Mr.\r\nBrown. They told me that it would be necessary for me to pay $120 to get\r\nthe place. They told me of one girl who had offered $250, and her\r\napplication had been rejected. That was before they broached the subject\r\nof money to me. I said that I didn’t have $120 to pay, and they replied\r\nthat it was customary for teachers to pay $40 a month out of their first\r\nthree months’ salary. The salary was $47. They told me they didn’t want\r\nthe money for themselves, but that it was necessary to buy the other\r\nfaction. Finally I agreed to the proposition, and they told me that I\r\nmust be careful not to mention it to anybody or it would injure my\r\nreputation. I went with my brother to pay the money to Mr. Johnson. He\r\nheld out a hat, and when my brother handed the money to him he took it\r\nbehind the hat.”\r\n\r\nThe regular business of the ring was like that of Pittsburg, but more\r\nextensive. I have space only for one incident of one phase of it:\r\nWidener and Elkins, the national franchise buyers, are Philadelphians,\r\nand they were in the old Martin ring. They had combined all the street\r\nrailways of the city before 1900, and they were withdrawing from\r\npolitics, with their traction system. But the Pennsylvania rings will\r\nnot let corporations that have risen in corruption reform and retire,\r\nand, besides, it was charged that in the Martin-Quay fight, the street\r\nrailways had put up money to beat Quay for the United States Senate. At\r\nany rate, plans were laid to “mace” the street railways.\r\n\r\n“Macing” is a form of high blackmail. When they have sold out all they\r\nhave, the politicians form a competing company and compel the old\r\nconcern to buy out or sell out. While Widener and Elkins were at sea,\r\nbound for Europe, in 1901, the Philadelphia ring went to the Legislature\r\nand had introduced there two bills, granting a charter to practically\r\nall the streets and alleys not covered by tracks in Philadelphia, and to\r\nrun short stretches of the old companies’ tracks to make connections.\r\nClinton Rogers Woodruff, who was an Assemblyman, has told the story.\r\nWithout notice the bills were introduced at 3 P. M. on Monday, May 29;\r\nthey were reported from committee in five minutes; by 8.50 P. M. they\r\nwere printed and on the members’ desk, and by 9 P. M. were passed on\r\nfirst reading. The bills passed second reading the next day, Memorial\r\nDay, and on the third day were passed from the Senate to the House,\r\nwhere they were “jammed through” with similar haste and worse trickery.\r\nIn six legislative days the measures were before Governor Stone, who\r\nsigned them June 7, at midnight, in the presence of Quay, Penrose,\r\nCongressman Foerderer, Mayor Ashbridge’s banker, James P. McNichol, John\r\nM. Mack and other capitalists and politicians. Under the laws, one\r\nhundred charters were applied for the next morning—thirteen for\r\nPhiladelphia. The charters were granted on June 5, and that same day a\r\nspecial meeting of the Philadelphia Select Council was called for\r\nMonday. There the citizens of Philadelphia met the oncoming charters,\r\nbut their hearing was brief. The charters went through without a hitch,\r\nand were sent to Mayor Ashbridge on June 13.\r\n\r\nThe mayor’s secretary stated authoritatively in the morning that the\r\nmayor would not sign that day. But he did. An unexpected incident forced\r\nhis hand. John Wanamaker sent him an offer of $2,500,000 for the\r\nfranchises about to be given away. Ashbridge threw the letter into the\r\nstreet unread. Mr. Wanamaker had deposited $250,000 as a guarantee of\r\ngood faith and his action was becoming known. The ordinances were signed\r\nby midnight, and the city lost at least two and one-half millions of\r\ndollars; but the ring made it and much more. When Mr. Wanamaker’s letter\r\nwas published, Congressman Foerderer, an incorporator of the company,\r\nanswered for the machine. He said the offer was an advertisement; that\r\nit was late, and that they were sorry they hadn’t had a chance to “call\r\nthe bluff.” Mr. Wanamaker responded with a renewal of the offer of\r\n$2,500,000 to the city, and, he said, “I will add $500,000 as a bonus to\r\nyourself and your associates personally for the conveyance of the grants\r\nand corporate privileges you now possess.” That ended the controversy.\r\n\r\nBut the deal went on. Two more bills, called “Trolley Chasers,” were put\r\nthrough, to finish off the legislation, too hurriedly done to be\r\nperfect. One was to give the company the right to build either elevated\r\nor underground, or both; the second to forbid all further such grants\r\nwithout a hearing before a board consisting of the Governor, the\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth, and the Attorney-General. With all these\r\nfranchises and exclusive privileges, the new company made the old one\r\nlease their plant in operation to the company which had nothing but\r\n“rights,” or, in Pennsylvania slang, a “good, husky mace.”\r\n\r\nAshbridgeism put Philadelphia and the Philadelphia machine to a test\r\nwhich candid ring leaders did not think it would stand. What did the\r\nPhiladelphians do? Nothing. They have their reformers: they have men\r\nlike Francis B. Reeves, who fought with every straight reform movement\r\nfrom the days of the Committee of One Hundred; they have men like\r\nRudolph Blankenburg, who have fought with every reform that promised any\r\nkind of relief; there are the Municipal League, with an organization by\r\nwards, the Citizens’ Municipal League, the Allied Reform League, and the\r\nLaw and Order Society; there are young men and veterans; there are\r\ndisappointed politicians and ambitious men who are not advanced fast\r\nenough by the machine. There is discontent in a good many hearts, and\r\nsome men are ashamed. But “the people” won’t follow. One would think the\r\nPhiladelphians would follow any leader; what should they care whether he\r\nis pure white or only gray? But they do care. “The people” seem to\r\nprefer to be ruled by a known thief than an ambitious reformer. They\r\nwill make you convict their Tweeds, McManeses, Butlers, and Shepherds,\r\nand even then they may forgive them and talk of monuments to their\r\nprecious memory, but they take delight in the defeat of John Wanamaker\r\nbecause they suspect that he is a hypocrite and wants to go to the\r\nUnited States Senate.\r\n\r\nAll the stout-hearted reformers had made a campaign to re-elect\r\nRothermel, the District Attorney who had dared to try Quay. Surely there\r\nwas an official to support! But no, Quay was against him. The reformers\r\nused money, some $250,000, I believe,—fighting the devil with fire,—but\r\nthe machine used more money, $700,000, from the teachers,\r\n“speak-easies,” office holders, bankers, and corporations. The machine\r\nhandled the ballots. Rothermel was beaten by John Weaver. There have\r\nbeen other campaigns, before and since, led by the Municipal League,\r\nwhich is managed with political sense, but each successive defeat was by\r\na larger majority for the machine.\r\n\r\nThere is no check upon this machine excepting the chance of a mistake,\r\nthe imminent fear of treachery, and the remote danger of revolt. To meet\r\nthis last, the machine, as a State organization, has set about\r\nthrottling public criticism. Ashbridge found that blackmail was\r\nineffective. Durham, Quay, and Governor Pennypacker have passed a libel\r\nlaw which meant to muzzle the press. The Governor was actuated\r\napparently only by his sufferings from cartoons and comments during his\r\ncampaign; the Philadelphia ring has boodling plans ahead which exposure\r\nmight make exasperating to the people. The Philadelphia _Press_, the\r\nleading Republican organ in the State, puts it right: “The Governor\r\nwanted it [the law] in the hope of escaping from the unescapable\r\ncartoon. The gang wanted it in hope of muzzling the opposition to\r\njobs.... The act is distinctly designed to gag the press in the interest\r\nof the plunderers and against the interest of the people.”\r\n\r\nDisfranchised, without a choice of parties; denied, so the Municipal\r\nLeague declares, the ancient right of petition; and now to lose “free\r\nspeech,”—is there no hope for Philadelphia? Yes, the Philadelphians have\r\na very present hope. It is in their new mayor, John Weaver. There is\r\nnothing in his record to inspire faith in an outsider. He speaks himself\r\nof two notorious “miscarriages of justice” during his term as District\r\nAttorney; he was the nominee of the ring; and the ring men have\r\nconfidence in him. But so have the people, and Mr. Weaver makes fair\r\npromises. So did Ashbridge. There is this difference, however: Mr.\r\nWeaver has made a good start. He compromised with the machine on his\r\nappointments, but he declared against the protection of vice, for free\r\nvoting, and he stopped some “wholesale grabs” or “maces” that appeared\r\nin the Legislature, just before he took office.\r\n\r\nOne was a bill to enable (ring) companies to “appropriate, take, and use\r\nall water within this commonwealth and belonging either to public or to\r\nprivate persons as it may require for its private purposes.” This was a\r\nscheme to sell out the water works of Philadelphia, and all other such\r\nplants in the State. Another bill was to open the way to a seizure of\r\nthe light and power of the city and of the State. Martin and Warwick\r\n“leased” the city gas works. Durham and his crowd wanted a whack at it.\r\n“It shall be lawful,” the bill read, “for any city, town, or borough\r\nowning any gas works or electric light plant for supplying light, heat,\r\nand power, to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the same to\r\nindividuals or corporations, and in order to obtain the best possible\r\nreturns therefor, such municipal body may ... vest in the lessees or\r\npurchasers the exclusive right, both as against such municipal\r\ncorporations and against any and all other persons and corporations, to\r\nsupply gas or electricity....” As in St. Louis, the public property of\r\nthe city is to be sold off. These schemes are to go through later, I am\r\ntold, but on Mr. Weaver’s declarations that he would not “stand for\r\nthem,” they were laid over.\r\n\r\nIt looks as if the Philadelphians were right about Mr. Weaver, but what\r\nif they are? Think of a city putting its whole faith in one man, in the\r\n_hope_ that John Weaver, an Englishman by birth, will _give_ them good\r\ngovernment! And why should he do that? Why should he serve the people\r\nand not the ring? The ring can make or break him; the people of\r\nPhiladelphia can neither reward nor punish him. For even if he restores\r\nto them their ballots and proves himself a good mayor, he cannot succeed\r\nhimself; the good charter forbids more than one term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CHICAGO: HALF FREE AND FIGHTING ON\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_October, 1903_)\r\n\r\nWhile these articles on municipal corruption were appearing, readers of\r\nthem were writing to the magazine asking what they, as citizens, were to\r\ndo about it all. As if I knew; as if “we” knew; as if there were any one\r\nway to deal with this problem in all places under any circumstances.\r\nThere isn’t, and if I had gone around with a ready-made reform scheme in\r\nthe back of my head, it would have served only to keep me from seeing\r\nstraight the facts that would not support my theory. The only editorial\r\nscheme we had was to study a few choice examples of bad city government\r\nand tell how the bad was accomplished, then seek out, here and abroad,\r\nsome typical good governments and explain how the good was done;—not how\r\nto do it, mind you, but how it had been done. Though the bad government\r\nseries was not yet complete, since so many good men apparently want to\r\ngo to work right off, it was decided to pause for an instance on the\r\nreform side. I have chosen the best I have found. Political grafters\r\nhave been cheerful enough to tell me they have “got lots of pointers”\r\nfrom the corruption articles. I trust the reformers will pick up some\r\n“pointers” from—Chicago.\r\n\r\nYes, Chicago. First in violence, deepest in dirt; loud, lawless,\r\nunlovely, ill-smelling, irreverent, new; an overgrown gawk of a village,\r\nthe “tough” among cities, a spectacle for the nation;—I give Chicago no\r\nquarter and Chicago asks for none. “Good,” they cheer, when you find\r\nfault; “give us the gaff. We deserve it and it does us good.” They do\r\ndeserve it. Lying low beside a great lake of pure, cold water, the city\r\nhas neither enough nor good enough water. With the ingenuity and will to\r\nturn their sewer, the Chicago River, and make it run backwards and\r\nupwards out of the Lake, the city cannot solve the smoke nuisance. With\r\nresources for a magnificent system of public parking, it is too poor to\r\npave and clean the streets. They can balance high buildings on rafts\r\nfloating in mud, but they can’t quench the stench of the stockyards. The\r\nenterprise which carried through a World’s Fair to a world’s triumph is\r\nsatisfied with two thousand five hundred policemen for two million\r\ninhabitants and one hundred and ninety-six square miles of territory, a\r\nforce so insufficient (and inefficient) that it cannot protect itself,\r\nto say nothing of handling mobs, riotous strikers, and the rest of that\r\nlawlessness which disgraces Chicago. Though the city has an extra-legal\r\nsystem of controlling vice and crime, which is so effective that the\r\nmayor has been able to stop any practices against which he has turned\r\nhis face—the “panel game,” the “hat game,” “wine rooms,” “safe\r\nblowing”;—though gambling is limited, regulated, and fair, and\r\nprostitution orderly; though, in short, through the power of certain\r\npolitical and criminal leaders—the mayor has been able to make Chicago,\r\ncriminally speaking, “honest”—burglary and cruel hold-ups are tolerated.\r\nAs government, all this is preposterous.\r\n\r\nBut I do not cite Chicago as an example of good municipal government,\r\nnor yet of good American municipal government; New York has, for the\r\nmoment, a much better administration. But neither is Chicago a good\r\nexample of bad government. There is grafting there, but after St. Louis\r\nit seems petty and after Philadelphia most unprofessional. Chicago is\r\ninteresting for the things it has “fixed.” What is wrong there is\r\nridiculous. Politically and morally speaking, Chicago should be\r\ncelebrated among American cities for reform, real reform, not moral fits\r\nand political uprisings, not reform waves that wash the “best people”\r\ninto office to make fools of themselves and subside leaving the machine\r\nstronger than ever,—none of these aristocratic disappointments of\r\npopular government,—but reform that reforms, slow, sure, political,\r\ndemocratic reform, by the people, for the people. That is what Chicago\r\nhas. It has found a way. I don’t know that it is _the_ way. All that I\r\nam sure of is that Chicago has something to teach every city and town in\r\nthe country—including Chicago.\r\n\r\nFor Chicago is reformed only in spots. A political map of the city would\r\nshow a central circle of white with a few white dots and dashes on a\r\nbackground of black, gray, and yellow. But the city once was pretty\r\nsolid black. Criminally it was wide open; commercially it was brazen;\r\nsocially it was thoughtless and raw; it was a settlement of individuals\r\nand groups and interests with no common city sense and no political\r\nconscience. Everybody was for himself, none was for Chicago. There were\r\npolitical parties, but the organizations were controlled by rings, which\r\nin turn were parts of State rings, which in turn were backed and used by\r\nleading business interests through which this corrupt and corrupting\r\nsystem reached with its ramifications far and high and low into the\r\nsocial organization. The grafting was miscellaneous and very general;\r\nbut the most open corruption was that which centered in the City\r\nCouncil. It never was well organized and orderly. The aldermen had\r\n“combines,” leaders, and prices, but, a lot of good-natured honest\r\nthieves, they were independent of party bosses and “the organizations,”\r\nwhich were busy at their own graft. They were so unbusinesslike that\r\nbusiness men went into the City Council to reduce the festival of\r\nblackmail to decent and systematic bribery. These men helped matters\r\nsome, but the happy-go-lucky spirit persisted until the advent of\r\nCharles T. Yerkes from Philadelphia, who, with his large experience of\r\nPennsylvania methods, first made boodling a serious business. He had to\r\ngo right into politics himself to get anything done. But he did get\r\nthings done. The aldermanic combine was fast selling out the city to its\r\n“best citizens,” when some decent men spoke up and called upon the\r\npeople to stop it, the people who alone can stop such things.\r\n\r\nAnd the people of Chicago stopped it; they have beaten boodling. That is\r\nabout all they have done so far, but that is about all they have tried\r\ndeliberately and systematically to do, and the way they have done that\r\nproves that they can do anything they set out to do. They worry about\r\nthe rest; half free, they are not half satisfied and not half done. But\r\nboodling, with its backing of “big men” and “big interests,” is the\r\nhardest evil a democracy has to fight, and a people who can beat it can\r\nbeat anything.\r\n\r\nEvery community, city, town, village, State—the United States itself—has\r\na certain number of men who are willing, if it doesn’t cost anything, to\r\nvote right. They don’t want to “hurt their business”; they “can’t afford\r\nthe time to go to the primaries”; they don’t care to think much. But\r\nthey will vote. This may not be much, but it is enough. All that this\r\nindependent, non-partisan vote wants is leadership, and that is what the\r\nChicago reformers furnished.\r\n\r\nThey had no such definite idea when they began. They had no theory at\r\nall—nothing but wrath, experience, common Chicago sense, and newspapers\r\nready to back reform, not for the news, but for the common good.\r\nTheories they had tried; and exposures, celebrated trials, even some\r\nconvictions of boodlers. They had gone in for a civil-service reform\r\nlaw, and, by the way, they got a good one, probably the best in any city\r\nin the country. But exposés are good only for one election; court trials\r\nmay punish individuals, but even convictions do not break up a corrupt\r\nsystem; and a “reform law” without reform citizenship is like a ship\r\nwithout a crew. With all their “reforms,” bad government persisted.\r\nThere was that bear garden—the City Council; something ought to be done\r\nto that. Men like William Kent, John H. Hamline, W. R. Manierre, A. W.\r\nMaltby, and James R. Mann had gone in there from their “respectable”\r\nwards, and their presence proved that they could get there; their\r\nspeeches were public protests, and their votes, “no,” “no,” “no,” were\r\nplain indicators of wrong. But all this was not enough. The Civic\r\nFederation, a respectable but inefficient universal reforming\r\nassociation, met without plans in 1895. It called together two hundred\r\nrepresentative men, with Lyman J. Gage at their head, to “do something.”\r\nThe two hundred appointed a committee of fifteen to “find something to\r\ndo.” One of the fifteen drew forth a fully drawn plan for a new\r\nmunicipal party, the old, old scheme. “That won’t do,” said Edwin\r\nBurritt Smith to Mr. Gage, who sat beside him. “No, that won’t do,” said\r\nGage. But they didn’t know what to do. To gain time Mr. Smith moved a\r\nsub-committee. The sub-committee reported back to the fifteen, the\r\nfifteen to the two hundred. And so, as Mr. Smith said, they “fumbled.”\r\n\r\nBut notice what they didn’t do. Fumblers as they were, they didn’t talk\r\nof more exposures. “Heavens, we know enough,” said one. They didn’t go\r\nto the Legislature for a new charter. They needed one, they need one\r\nto-day, and badly, too, but the men who didn’t know what, but did know\r\nwhat not to do, wouldn’t let them commit the folly of asking one corrupt\r\nlegislature to legislate another corrupt legislature out of existence.\r\nAnd they didn’t wait till the next mayoralty election to elect a\r\n“business mayor” who should give them good government.\r\n\r\nThey were bound to accept the situation just as it was—the laws, the\r\nconditions, the political circumstances, all exactly as they were—and,\r\njust as a politician would, go into the next fight whatever it was and\r\nfight. All they needed was a fighter. So it was moved to find a man, one\r\nman, and let this man find eight other men, who should organize the\r\n“Municipal Voters’ League.” There were no instructions; the very name\r\nwas chosen because it meant nothing and might mean anything.\r\n\r\nBut the man! That was the problem. There were men, a few, but the one\r\nman is always hard to find. There was William Kent, rich, young, afraid\r\nof nothing and always ready, but he was an alderman, and the wise ones\r\ndeclared that the Nine must not only be disinterested, but must appear\r\nso. William Kent wouldn’t do. Others were suggested; none that would do.\r\n\r\n“How about George E. Cole?”\r\n\r\n“Just the man,” said Mr. Gage, and all knew the thought was an\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nGeorge E. Cole described himself to me as a “second-class business man.”\r\nStanding about five feet high, he knows he is no taller; but he knows\r\nthat that is tall enough. Cole is a fighter. Nobody discovered it,\r\nperhaps, till he was past his fiftieth year. Then one Martin B. Madden\r\nfound it out. Madden, a prominent citizen, president of the Western\r\nStone Company, and a man of tremendous political power, was one of the\r\nbusiness men who went into the Council to bring order out of the chaos\r\nof corruption. He was a Yerkes leader. Madden lived in Cole’s ward. His\r\nhouse was in sight of Cole’s house. “The sight of it made me hot,” said\r\nCole, “for I knew what it represented.” Cole had set out to defeat\r\nMadden, and he made a campaign which attracted the attention of the\r\nwhole town. Madden was re-elected, but Cole had proved himself, and that\r\nwas what made Lyman J. Gage say that Cole was “just the man.”\r\n\r\n“You come to me as a Hobson’s choice,” said Mr. Cole to the committee,\r\n“as a sort of forlorn hope. All right,” he added, “as a last chance,\r\nI’ll take it.”\r\n\r\nCole went out to make up the Nine. He chose William H. Colvin, a wealthy\r\nbusiness man, retired; Edwin Burritt Smith, publicist and lawyer; M. J.\r\nCarroll, ex-labor leader, ex-typesetter, an editorial writer on a trade\r\njournal; Frank Wells, a well-known real estate man; R. R. Donnelly, the\r\nhead of one of the greatest printing establishments in the city; and\r\nHoyt King, a young lawyer who turned out to be a natural investigator.\r\nThese made, with Cole himself, only seven, but he had the help and\r\ncounsel of Kent, Allen B. Pond, the architect, Judge Murray F. Tuley,\r\nFrancis Lackner, and Graham Taylor. “We were just a few commonplace,\r\nordinary men,” said one of them to me, “and there is your encouragement\r\nfor other commonplace, ordinary men.” These men were selected for what\r\nthey could do, however, not for what they “represented.” The One\r\nHundred, which the Nine were to complete, was to do the representing.\r\nBut the One Hundred never was completed, and the ward committee, a\r\nfeature of the first campaign, was abandoned later on. “The boss and the\r\nring” was the model of the Nine, only they did not know it. They were\r\nnot thinking of principles and methods. Work was their instinct and the\r\nfighting has always been thick. The next election was to be held in\r\nApril, and by the time they were ready February was half over. Since it\r\nwas to be an election of aldermen, they went right out after the\r\naldermen. There were sixty-eight in all—fifty-seven of them “thieves,”\r\nas the League reported promptly and plainly. Of the sixty-eight, the\r\nterms of thirty-four were expiring, and these all were likely to come up\r\nfor re-election.\r\n\r\nThe thing to do was to beat the rascals. But how? Mr. Cole and his\r\ncommittee were pioneers; they had to blaze the way, and, without plans,\r\nthey set about it directly. Seeking votes, and honest votes, with no\r\norganization to depend upon, they had to have publicity. “We had first\r\nto let people know we were there,” said Cole, so he stepped “out into\r\nthe lime-light” and, with his short legs apart, his weak eyes blinking,\r\nhe talked. The League was out to beat the boodlers up for re-election,\r\nhe said, with much picturesque English. Now Chicago is willing to have\r\nanybody try to do anything worth while in Chicago; no matter who you are\r\nor where you come from, Chicago will give you a cheer and a first boost.\r\nWhen, therefore, George E. Cole stood up and said he and a quiet little\r\ncommittee were going to beat some politicians at the game of politics,\r\nthe good-natured town said: “All right, go ahead and beat ‘em; but how?”\r\nCole was ready with his answer. “We’re going to publish the records of\r\nthe thieves who want to get back at the trough.” Alderman Kent and his\r\ndecent colleagues produced the records of their indecent colleagues, and\r\nthe League announced that of the thirty-four retiring aldermen,\r\ntwenty-six were rogues. Hoyt King and a staff of briefless young lawyers\r\nlooked up ward records, and “these also we will publish,” said Cole. And\r\nthey did; the Chicago newspapers, long on the right side and ever ready,\r\nprinted them, and they were “mighty interesting reading.” Edwin Burritt\r\nSmith stated the facts; Cole added “ginger,” and Kent “pepper and salt\r\nand vinegar.” They soon had publicity. Some of the committee shrank from\r\nthe worst of it, but Cole stood out and took it. He became a character\r\nin the town. He was photographed and caricatured; he was “Boss Cole” and\r\n“Old King Cole,” but all was grist to this reform mill. Some of the\r\nretiring aldermen retired at once. Others were retired. If information\r\nturned up by Hoyt King was too private for publication, the committee\r\nwas, and is to-day, capable of sending for the candidate and advising\r\nhim to get off the ticket. This was called “blackmail,” and I will call\r\nit that, if the word will help anybody to appreciate how hard these\r\nreform politicians played and play the game.\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking, however, they were working, and their work was\r\ndone in the wards. Each ward was separately studied, the politics of\r\neach was separately understood, and separately each ward was fought.\r\nDeclaring only for “aggressive honesty” at first, not competence, they\r\ndid not stick even to that. They wanted to beat the rascals that were\r\nin, and, if necessary, if they couldn’t hope to elect an honest man,\r\nthey helped a likely rascal to beat the rascal that was in and known.\r\nThey drew up a pledge of loyalty to public interest, but they didn’t\r\ninsist on it in some cases. Like the politicians, they were\r\nopportunists. Like the politicians, too, they were non-partisans. They\r\nplayed off one party against another, or, if the two organizations hung\r\ntogether, they put up an independent. They broke many a cherished reform\r\nprinciple, but few rules of practical politics. Thus, while they had\r\nsome of their own sort of men nominated, they did not attempt, they did\r\nnot think of running “respectable” or “business” candidates as such.\r\nNeither were they afraid to dicker with ward leaders and “corrupt\r\npoliticians.” They went down into the ward, urged the minority\r\norganization leader to name a “good man,” on promise of independent\r\nsupport, then campaigned against the majority nominee with circulars,\r\nhouse-to-house canvassers, mass-meetings, bands, speakers, and parades.\r\nI should say that the basic unstated principle of this reform movement,\r\nstruck out early in the practice of the Nine, was to let the politicians\r\nrule, but through better and better men whom the Nine forced upon them\r\nwith public opinion. But again I want to emphasize the fact that they\r\nhad no finespun theories and no definite principles beyond that of being\r\nalways for the best available man. They were with the Democrats in one\r\nward, with the Republicans in another, but in none were they respecters\r\nof persons.\r\n\r\nRight here appeared that insidious influence which we have seen\r\ndefeating or opposing reform in other cities—the interference of\r\nrespectable men to save their friends. In the Twenty-second Ward the\r\nDemocrats nominated a director (now deceased) of the First National Bank\r\nand a prominent man socially and financially. John Colvin, one of the\r\n“Big Four,” a politician who had gone away rich to Europe and was\r\nreturning to go back into politics, also was running. The League\r\npreferred John Maynard Harlan, a son of Justice Harlan, and they elected\r\nhim. The bank of which the respectable Democratic candidate was a\r\ndirector was the bank of which Lyman J. Gage, of the League, was\r\npresident. All that the League had against this man was that he was the\r\nproprietor of a house leased for questionable purposes, and his friends,\r\nincluding Mr. Gage, were highly indignant. Mr. Gage pleaded and\r\nprotested. The committee was “sick of pulls” and they made short work of\r\nthis most “respectable” pull. They had “turned down” politicians on no\r\nbetter excuse, and they declared they were not going to overlook in the\r\nfriend of their friends what they condemned in some poor devil who had\r\nno friends.\r\n\r\nThere were many such cases, then and later; this sort of thing has never\r\nceased and it never will cease; reform must always “go too far,” if it\r\nis to go at all, for it is up there in the “too far” that corruption has\r\nits source. The League, by meeting it early, and “spotting it,” as Mr.\r\nCole said, not only discouraged such interference, but fixed its own\r\ncharacter and won public confidence. For everything in those days was\r\nopen. The League works more quietly now, but then Cole was talking it\r\nall out, plain to the verge of brutality, forcible to the limit of\r\nlanguage, and honest to utter ruthlessness. He blundered and they all\r\nmade mistakes, but their blundering only helped them, for while the\r\nerrors were plain errors, the fairness of mind that rejected an Edward\r\nM. Stanwood, for example, was plain too. Stanwood, a respectable\r\nbusiness man, had served as alderman, but his re-election was advised\r\nagainst by the League because he had “voted with the gang.” A high\r\npublic official, three judges, and several other prominent men\r\ninterceded on the ground that “in every instance where he is charged\r\nwith having voted for a so-called boodle ordinance, it was not done\r\ncorruptly, but that he might secure votes for some meritorious measure.”\r\nThe League answered in this style: “We regard this defense, which is put\r\nforward with confidence by men of your standing, as painful evidence of\r\nthe low standard by which the public conduct of city officials has come\r\nto be measured by good citizens. Do you not know that this is one of the\r\nmost insidious and common forms of legislative corruption?” Mr. Stanwood\r\nwas defeated.\r\n\r\nThe League “made good.” Of the twenty-six outgoing aldermen with bad\r\nrecords, sixteen were not renominated. Of the ten who were, four were\r\nbeaten at the polls. The League’s recommendations were followed in\r\ntwenty-five wards; they were disregarded in five; in some wards no fight\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nA victory so extraordinary would have satisfied some reformers. Others\r\nwould have been inflated by it and ruined. These men became canny. They\r\nchose this propitious moment to get rid of the committee of One Hundred\r\nrespectables. Such a body is all very well to launch a reform, when no\r\none knows that it is going to do serious work; but, as the Cole\r\ncommittee had learned, representative men with many interests can be\r\nreached. The little committee incorporated the League, then called\r\ntogether the big committee, congratulated it, and proposed a\r\nconstitution and by-laws which would throw all the work—and all the\r\npower—to the little committee. The little committee was to call on the\r\nbig committee only as money or some “really important” help was needed.\r\nThe big committee approved, swelled up, adjourned, and that is the last\r\ntime it has ever met.\r\n\r\nThus free of “pulls,” gentlemanly pulls, but pulls just the same, the\r\n“nine” became nine by adding two—Allen B. Pond and Francis Lackner—and\r\nprepared for the next campaign. Their aldermen, the “reform crowd,” in\r\nthe City Council were too few to do anything alone, but they could\r\nprotest, and they did. They adopted the system of William Kent, which\r\nwas to find out what was going on and tell it in Council meetings.\r\n\r\n“If you go on giving away the people’s franchises like this,” Alderman\r\nHarlan would say, “you may wake up some morning to find street lamps are\r\nuseful for other purposes than lighting the streets.” Or, “Some night\r\nthe citizens, who are watching you, may come down here from the\r\ngalleries with pieces of hemp in their hands.” Then he would picture an\r\nimagined scene of the galleries rising and coming down upon the floor.\r\nHe made his descriptions so vivid and creepy that they made some\r\naldermen fidget. “I don’t like dis business all about street lamps and\r\nhemp—vot dot is?” said a German boodler one night. “We don’t come here\r\nfor no such a business.”\r\n\r\n“We meant only to make head-lines for the papers,” said one of the\r\nreform aldermen. “If we could keep the attention of the public upon the\r\nCouncil we could make clear what was going on there, and that would put\r\nmeaning into our next campaign. And we certainly did fill the galleries\r\nand the newspapers.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, they did much more. They developed in that\r\nyear the issue which has dominated Chicago local politics ever since—the\r\nproper compensation to the city for public franchises. These valuable\r\nrights should not be given away, they declared, and they repeated it for\r\ngood measures as well as bad. Not only must the city be paid, but public\r\nconvenience and interest must be safeguarded. The boodlers boodled and\r\nthe franchises went off; the protestation hurried the rotten business;\r\nbut even that haste helped the cause. For the sight, week after week, of\r\nthe boodle raids by rapacious capital fixed public opinion, and if the\r\ncry raised then for municipal ownership ever becomes a fact in Chicago,\r\ncapital can go back to those days and blame itself.\r\n\r\nMost of the early Chicago street railway franchises were limited,\r\ncarelessly, to twenty-five years—the first one in 1858. In 1883, when\r\nthe earliest franchises might have been terminated, the Council ventured\r\nto pass only a blanket extension for twenty years—till July 30, 1903.\r\nThis was well enough for Chicago financiers, but in 1886–87, when Yerkes\r\nappeared, with Widener and Elkins behind him, and bought up the West and\r\nNorth Side companies, he applied Pennsylvania methods. He pushed bills\r\nthrough the Legislature, saw them vetoed by Governor Altgeld, set about\r\nhaving his own Governor next time, and in 1897 got, not all that he\r\nwanted (for the people of Illinois are not like the people of\r\nPennsylvania), but the Allen bill, which would do—if the Chicago City\r\nCouncil of 1897 would give it force.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Voters’ League had begun its second campaign in December,\r\n1896, with the publication of the records of the retiring aldermen, the\r\nsecond half of the old body, and, though this was before the Allen bill\r\nwas passed, Yerkes was active, and his men were particularized. As the\r\ncampaign progressed the legislation at Springfield gave it point and\r\nlocal developments gave it breadth. It was a mayoralty year, and\r\nAlderman John Maynard Harlan had himself nominated on an independent,\r\nnon-partisan ticket. “Bobbie” Burke, the Democratic boss, brought\r\nforward Carter H. Harrison, and the Republicans nominated Judge\r\nNathaniel C. Sears. Harrison at that time was known only as the son of\r\nhis father. Sears was a fine man; but neither of these had seized the\r\nstreet railway issue. Mr. Harlan stood on that, and he made a campaign\r\nwhich is talked about to this day in Chicago. It was brilliant. He had\r\nhad the ear of the town through the newspaper reports of his tirades in\r\nthe Council, and the people went to hear him now as night after night he\r\narraigned, not the bribed legislators, but the rich bribers. Once he\r\ncalled the roll of street railway directors and asked each what he was\r\ndoing while his business was being boodled through the State\r\nLegislature. Earnest, eloquent, honest, he was witty too. Yerkes called\r\nhim an ass. “If Yerkes will consult his Bible,” said Harlan, “he will\r\nlearn that great things have been done with the jaw-bone of an ass.”\r\nThis young man had no organization (the League confined itself to the\r\naldermen); it was a speaking campaign; but he caught the spirit of\r\nChicago, and in the last week men say you could feel the drift of\r\nsentiment to him. Though he was defeated, he got 70,000 votes, 10,000\r\nmore than the regular Republican candidate, and elected Harrison. And\r\nhis campaign not only phrased the traction issue in men’s minds; it is\r\nsaid to have taught young Mayor Harrison the use of it. At any rate,\r\nHarrison and Chicago have been safe on the city’s side of it ever since.\r\n\r\nThe League also won on it. They gave bad records to twenty-seven of the\r\nthirty-four outgoing aldermen. Fifteen were not renominated. Of the\r\ntwelve who ran again, nine were beaten. This victory gave them a solid\r\nthird of the Council. The reform crowd combined with Mayor Harrison, the\r\nPresident of the Council, and his followers, and defeated ordinances\r\nintroduced to give effect to Yerkes’s odious Allen law.\r\n\r\nHere again the League might have retired in glory, but these\r\n“commonplace, ordinary men” proposed instead that they go ahead and get\r\na majority, organize the Council on a non-partisan basis, and pass from\r\na negative, anti-boodling policy to one of positive, constructive\r\nlegislation. This meant also to advance from “beating bad men” to the\r\n“election of good men,” and as for the good men, the standard was to be\r\nraised from mere honesty to honesty and efficiency too. With such high\r\npurposes in view, the Nine went into their third campaign. They had to\r\ncondemn men they had recommended in their first year, but “we are always\r\nready to eat dirt,” they say. They pointed to the franchise issue,\r\ncalled for men capable of coping with the railways, and with bands\r\nplaying, orators shouting, and Cole roaring like a sea-captain, they\r\nmade the campaign of 1898 the hottest in their history. It nearly killed\r\nsome of them, but they “won out”; the League had a nominal majority of\r\nthe City Council.\r\n\r\nThen came their first bitter disappointment. They failed to organize the\r\naldermen. They tried, and were on the verge of success, when defeat\r\ncame, a most significant defeat. The League had brought into political\r\nlife some new men, shop-keepers and small business men, all with perfect\r\nrecords, or none. They were men who meant well, but business is no\r\ntraining for politics; the shop-keepers who knew how to resist the\r\ntemptations of trade were untried in those of politics, and the boodle\r\ngang “bowled them over like little tin soldiers.” They were persuaded\r\nthat it was no more than right to “let the dominant party make up\r\ncommittees and run the Council”; that was “usage,” and, what with\r\nbribery, sophistry, and flattery, the League was beaten by its weak\r\nfriends. The real crisis in the League had come.\r\n\r\nMr. Cole resigned. He took the view that the League work was done; it\r\ncould do no more; his health was suffering and his business was going to\r\nthe dogs. The big corporations, the railroads, great business houses and\r\ntheir friends, had taken their business away from him. But this boycott\r\nhad begun in the first campaign and Cole had met it with the declaration\r\nthat he didn’t “care a d—n.” “I have a wife and a boy,” he said. “I want\r\ntheir respect. The rest can all go to h—l.” Cole has organized since a\r\nleague to reform the legislature, but after the 1898 campaign the Nine\r\nwere tired, disappointed, and Cole was temporarily used up.\r\n\r\nThe Nine had to let Cole and Hoyt King go. But they wouldn’t let the\r\nLeague go. They had no successor for Cole. None on the committee would\r\ntake his place; they all declined it in turn. They looked outside for a\r\nman, finding nobody. The prospect was dark. Then William Kent spoke up.\r\nKent had time and money, but he wouldn’t do anything anyone else could\r\nbe persuaded to do. He was not strong physically, and his physicians had\r\nwarned him that to live he must work little and play much. At that\r\nmoment he was under orders to go West and shoot. But when he saw what\r\nwas happening, he said:\r\n\r\n“I’m not the man for this job; I’m no organizer. I can smash more things\r\nin a minute than I can build up in a hundred years. But the League has\r\ngot to go on, so I’ll take Cole’s place if you’ll give me a\r\nhard-working, able man for secretary, an organizer and a master of\r\ndetail.”\r\n\r\nSuch a secretary was hard to find, but Allen B. Pond, the architect, a\r\nman made for fine work, took this rough-and-tumble task. And these two\r\nwith the committee strengthened and active, not only held their own,\r\nthey not only met the receding wave of reactionary sentiment against\r\nreform, but they made progress. In 1899 they won a clear majority of the\r\nCouncil, pledged their men before election to a non-partisan\r\norganization of the Council, and were in shape for constructive\r\nlegislation. In 1900 they increased their majority, but they did not\r\nthink it necessary to bind candidates before the election to the\r\nnon-partisan-committees plan, and the Republicans organized the house.\r\nThis party maintained the standard of the committees; there was no\r\nfalling off there, but that was not the point. Parties were recognized\r\nin the Council, and the League had hoped for only one line of\r\ndemarcation: special interests versus the interests of the city. During\r\nthe time of Kent and Pond, however, the power for good of the League was\r\nestablished, the question of its permanency settled, and the use of\r\nable, conscientious aldermen recognized. The public opinion it developed\r\nand pointed held the Council so steady that, with Mayor Harrison and his\r\npersonal following among the Democrats on that side, the aldermen\r\nrefused to do anything for the street railway companies until the Allen\r\nbill was repealed. And, all ready to pass anything at Springfield,\r\nYerkes had to permit the repeal, and he soon after closed up his\r\nbusiness in Chicago and went away to London, where he is said to be\r\nhappy and prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe first time I went to Chicago, to see what form of corruption they\r\nhad, I found there was something the matter with the political\r\nmachinery. There was the normal plan of government for a city, rings\r\nwith bosses, and grafting business interests behind. Philadelphia,\r\nPittsburg, St. Louis, are all governed on such a plan. But in Chicago it\r\ndidn’t work. “Business” was at a standstill and business was suffering.\r\nWhat was the matter? I beleaguered the political leaders with questions:\r\n“Why didn’t the politicians control? What was wrong with the machines?”\r\nThe “boss” defended the organizations, blaming the people. “But the\r\npeople could be fooled by any capable politician,” I demurred. The boss\r\nblamed the reformers. “Reformers!” I exclaimed. “I’ve seen some of your\r\nreformers. They aren’t different from reformers elsewhere, are they?”\r\n“No,” he said, well pleased. But when I concluded that it must then be\r\nthe weakness of the Chicago bosses, his pride cried out. “Say,” he said,\r\n“have you seen that blankety-blank Fisher?”\r\n\r\nI hadn’t, I said. “Well, you want to,” he said, and I went straightway\r\nand saw Fisher—Mr. Walter L. Fisher, secretary of the Municipal Voters’\r\nLeague. Then it was that I began to understand the Chicago political\r\nsituation. Fisher was a reformer: an able young lawyer of independent\r\nmeans, a mind ripe with high purposes and ideals, self-confident,\r\nhigh-minded, conclusive. He showed me an orderly bureau of indexed\r\ninformation, such as I had seen before. He outlined the scheme of the\r\nMunicipal Voters’ League, all in a bored, polite, familiar way. There\r\nwas no light in him nor anything new or vital in his reform as he\r\ndescribed it. It was all incomprehensible till I asked him how he\r\ncarried the Seventeenth Ward, a mixed and normally Democratic ward, in\r\none year for a Republican by some 1300 plurality, the next year for a\r\nDemocrat by some 1800, the third for a Republican again. His face\r\nlighted up, a keen, shrewd look came into his eyes, and he said: “I did\r\nnot carry that ward; its own people did it, but I’ll tell you how it was\r\nmanaged.” And he told me a story that was politics. I asked about\r\nanother ward, and he told me the story of that. It was entirely\r\ndifferent, but it, too, was politics. Fisher is a politician—with the\r\neducation, associations, and the idealism of the reformers who fail,\r\nthis man has cunning, courage, tact, and, rarer still, faith in the\r\npeople. In short, reform in Chicago has such a leader as corruption\r\nalone usually has; a first-class executive mind and a natural manager of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the aldermanic campaign of 1900, Messrs. Kent and Pond\r\nresigned as president and secretary of the League’s executive committee,\r\nCharles R. Crane and Mr. Fisher succeeded in their places. Mr. Crane is\r\na man with an international business, which takes him often to Russia,\r\nbut he comes back for the Chicago aldermanic campaigns. He leaves the\r\ngame to Mr. Fisher, and says Fisher is the man, but Crane is a backer of\r\ngreat force and of persistent though quiet activity. These two, with a\r\npicked committee of experienced and sensible men—Pond, Kent, Smith,\r\nFrank H. Scott, Graham Taylor, Sigmund Zeisler, and Lessing\r\nRosenthal—took the League as an established institution, perfected its\r\nsystem, opened a headquarters for work the year around; and this force,\r\nMr. Fisher, with his political genius, has made a factor of the first\r\nrank in practical politics. Fisher made fights in the “hopeless” wards,\r\nand won them. He has raised the reform majority in the City Council to\r\ntwo-thirds; he has lifted the standard of aldermen from honesty to a\r\ngradually rising scale of ability, and in his first year the Council was\r\norganized on a non-partisan basis. This feature of municipal reform is\r\nestablished now, by the satisfaction of the aldermen themselves with the\r\nway it works. And a most important feature it is, too. “We have four\r\nshots at every man headed for the Council,” said one of the League—“one\r\nwith his record when his term expires; another when he is up for the\r\nnomination; a third when he is running as a candidate; the fourth when\r\nthe committees are formed. If he is bad he is put on a minority in a\r\nstrong committee; if he is doubtful, with a weak or doubtful majority on\r\nan important committee with a strong minority—a minority so strong that\r\nthey can let him show his hand, then beat him with a minority report.”\r\nCareful not to interfere in legislation, the League keeps a watch on\r\nevery move in the Council. Cole started this. He used to sit in the\r\ngallery every meeting night, but under Crane and Fisher, an assistant\r\nsecretary—first Henry B. Chamberlain, now George C. Sikes—has followed\r\nthe daily routine of committee work as well as the final meetings.\r\n\r\nFisher has carried the early practice of meeting politicians on their\r\nown ground to a very practical extreme. When tact and good humor failed,\r\nhe applied force. Thus, when he set about preparing a year ahead for his\r\nfights in unpromising wards, he sent to the ward leaders on both sides\r\nfor their lists of captains, lieutenants, and heelers. They refused,\r\nwith expressions of astonishment at his “gall.” Mr. Chamberlain directed\r\na most searching investigation of the wards, precinct by precinct, block\r\nby block, and not only gathered a rich fund of information, but so\r\nfrightened the politicians who heard of the inquiries that many of them\r\ncame around and gave up their lists. Whether these helped or not,\r\nhowever, the wards were studied, and it was by such information and\r\nundermining political work, combined with skill and a fearless appeal to\r\nthe people of the ward, that Fisher beat out with Hubert W. Butler the\r\nnotorious Henry Wulff, an ex-State Treasurer, in the ward convention of\r\nWulff’s own party, and then defeated Wulff, who ran as an independent,\r\nat the polls.\r\n\r\nSuch experience won the respect of the politicians, as well as their\r\nfear, and in 1902 and 1903 the worst of them, or the best, came\r\npersonally to Fisher to see what they could do. He was their equal in\r\n“the game of talk,” they found, and their superior in tactics, for when\r\nhe could not persuade them to put up good men and “play fair,” he\r\nmeasured himself with them in strategy. Thus one day “Billy” Loeffler,\r\nthe Democratic leader in the Democratic Ninth Ward, asked Mr. Fisher if\r\nthe League did not want to name the Democratic candidate for alderman in\r\nhis ward. Loeffler’s business partner, “Hot Stove” Brenner, was running\r\non the Republican ticket and Fisher knew that the Democratic\r\norganization would pull for Brenner. But Fisher accepted what was a\r\nchallenge to political play and suggested Michael J. Preib. Loeffler was\r\ndazed at the name; it was new to him, but he accepted the man and\r\nnominated him. The Ninth is a strong Hebrew ward. To draw off the\r\nRepublican and Jewish vote from Brenner, Fisher procured the nomination\r\nas an independent of Jacob Diamond, a popular young Hebrew, and he\r\nbacked him too, intending, as he told both Preib and Diamond, to prefer\r\nin the end the one that should develop the greater strength. Meanwhile\r\nthe League watched Loeffler. He was quietly throwing his support from\r\nPreib to Brenner. Five days before election it was clear that, though\r\nDiamond had developed unexpected strength, Preib was stronger. Fisher\r\nwent to Loeffler and accused him of not doing all he could for Preib.\r\nLoeffler declared he was. Fisher proposed a letter from Loeffler to his\r\npersonal friends asking them to vote for Preib. Loeffler hesitated, but\r\nhe signed one that Fisher dictated. Loeffler advised the publication of\r\nthe statement in the Jewish papers, and, though he consented to have it\r\nmailed to voters, he thought it “an unnecessary expense.” When Fisher\r\ngot back to the League headquarters, he rushed off copies of the letter\r\nthrough the mails to all the voters in the ward. By the time Loeffler\r\nheard of this it was too late to do anything; he tried, but he never\r\ncaught up with those letters. His partner, Brenner, was defeated.\r\n\r\nA politician? A boss. Chicago has in Walter L. Fisher a reform boss, and\r\nin the Nine of the Municipal Voters’ League, with their associated\r\neditors and able finance and advisory committees, a reform ring. They\r\nhave no machine, no patronage, no power that they can abuse. They\r\nhaven’t even a list of their voters. All they have is the confidence of\r\nthe anonymous honest men of Chicago who care more for Chicago than for\r\nanything else. This they have won by a long record of good judgments,\r\nhonest, obvious devotion to the public good, and a disinterestedness\r\nwhich has avoided even individual credit; not a hundred men in the city\r\ncould name the Committee of Nine.\r\n\r\nWorking wide open at first, when it was necessary, they have withdrawn\r\nmore and more ever since, and their policy now is one of dignified\r\nsilence except when a plain statement of facts is required; then they\r\nspeak as the League, simply, directly, but with human feeling, and leave\r\ntheir following of voters to act with or against them as they please. I\r\nhave laid great stress on the technical, political skill of Fisher and\r\nthe Nine, not because that is their chief reliance; it isn’t: the study\r\nand the enlightenment of public opinion is their great function and\r\nforce. But other reform organizations have tried this way. These\r\nreformers have, with the newspapers and the aldermen, not only done it\r\nthoroughly and persistently; they have not only developed an educated\r\ncitizenship; they have made it an effective force, effective in\r\nlegislation and in practical politics. In short: political reform,\r\npolitically conducted, has produced reform politicians working for the\r\nreform of the city with the methods of politics. They do everything that\r\na politician does, except buy votes and sell them. They play politics in\r\nthe interest of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd what has the city got out of it? Many things, but at least one great\r\nspectacle to show the world, the political spectacle of the year, and it\r\nis still going on. The properly accredited representatives of two\r\nAmerican city railway companies are meeting in the open with a regular\r\ncommittee of an American board of aldermen, and they are negotiating for\r\nthe continuance of certain street railway franchises on terms fair both\r\nto the city and to the corporations, without a whisper of bribery, with\r\ncomposure, reasonableness, knowledge (on the aldermen’s part,\r\nlong-studied information and almost expert knowledge); with an eye to\r\nthe future, to the just profit of the railways, and the convenience of\r\nthe people of the city. This in an American city—in Chicago!\r\n\r\nThose franchises which Yerkes tried to “fix” expired on July 30. There\r\nwas a dispute about that, and the railways were prepared to fight. One\r\nis a Chicago corporation held by Chicago capital, and the men in it knew\r\nthe conditions. The other belongs to New York and Philadelphia\r\ncapitalists, whom Yerkes got to hold it when he gave up and went away;\r\nthey couldn’t understand. This “foreign” capital sent picked men out to\r\nChicago to “fight.” One of the items said to have been put in their bill\r\nof appropriation was “For use in Chicago—$1,000,000.” Their local\r\nofficers and directors and friends warned them to “go slow.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to tell us,” said the Easterners, “that we can’t do in\r\nChicago what we have done in Philadelphia, New York, and——”\r\n\r\n“That’s exactly what we mean,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nIncredulous, they did do some such “work.” They had the broken rings\r\nwith them, and the “busted bosses,” and they had the city on the hip in\r\none particular. Though the franchises expired, the city had no authority\r\nin law to take over the railways and had to get it from Springfield. The\r\nRepublican ring, with some Democratic following, had organized the\r\nLegislature on an explicit arrangement that “no traction legislation\r\nshould pass in 1903.” The railways knew they couldn’t get any; all they\r\nasked was that the city shouldn’t have any either. It was a political\r\ngame, but Chicago was sure that two could play at it. Harrison was up\r\nfor re-election; he was right on traction. The Republicans nominated a\r\nbusiness man, Graeme Stewart, who also pledged himself. Then they all\r\nwent to Springfield, and, with the whole city and State looking on, the\r\ncity’s reform politicians beat the regulars. The city’s bill was buried\r\nin committee, but to make a showing for Stewart the Republican ring had\r\nto pass some sort of a bill. They offered a poor substitute. With the\r\ncity against it, the Speaker “gaveled it through” amid a scene of the\r\nwildest excitement. He passed the bill, but he was driven from his\r\nchair, and the scandal compelled him and the ring to reconsider that\r\nbill and pass the city’s own enabling act.\r\n\r\nBoth the traction companies had been interested in this Springfield\r\nfiasco; they had been working together, but the local capitalists did\r\nnot like the business. They soon offered to settle separately, and went\r\ninto session with the city’s lawyers, Edwin Burritt Smith, of the\r\nLeague, and John C. Mathis. The Easterners’ representatives, headed by a\r\n“brilliant” New York lawyer, had to negotiate too. Their brilliant\r\nlawyer undertook to “talk sense” into the aldermanic committee. This\r\ncommittee had been out visiting all the large Eastern cities, studying\r\nthe traction situations everywhere; on their own account they had had\r\ndrawn for them one of the most complete reports ever made for a city by\r\nan expert. Moreover, they knew the law and the finances of the traction\r\ncompanies, better far than the New York lawyers. When, therefore, the\r\nbrilliant legal light had made one of his smooth, elaborate speeches,\r\nsome hard-headed alderman would get up and say that he “gathered and\r\ngleaned” thus and so from the last speaker; he wasn’t quite sure, but if\r\nthus and so was what the gentleman from New York had said, then it\r\nlooked to him like tommy rot. Then the lawyer would spin another web,\r\nonly to have some other commonplace-looking alderman tear it to pieces.\r\nThose lawyers were dumfounded. They were advised to see Fisher. They saw\r\nFisher.\r\n\r\n“You are welcome, if you wish,” he is said to have said, “to talk\r\nfoolishness, but I advise you to stop it. I do not speak for the\r\nCouncil, but I think I know what it will say when it speaks for itself.\r\nThose aldermen know their business. They know sense and they know\r\nnonsense. They can’t be fooled. If you go at them with reason they will\r\ngo a long way toward helping you. However, you shall do as you please\r\nabout this. But let me burn this one thing in upon your consciousness:\r\nDon’t try money on them or anybody else. They will listen to your\r\nnonsense with patience, but if we hear of you trying to bribe anybody—an\r\nalderman or a politician or a newspaper or a reporter—all negotiations\r\nwill cease instantly. And nobody will attempt to blackmail you, no one.”\r\n\r\nThis seems to me to be the highest peak of reform. Here is a gentleman,\r\nspeaking with the authority of absolute faith and knowledge, assuring\r\nthe representatives of a corporation that it can have all that is due it\r\nfrom a body of aldermen by the expenditure of nothing more than reason.\r\nI have heard many a business man say such a condition of things would be\r\nhailed by his kind with rejoicing. How do they like it in Chicago? They\r\ndon’t like it at all. I spent one whole forenoon calling on the\r\npresidents of banks, great business men, and financiers interested in\r\npublic utility companies. With all the evidence I had had in other\r\nplaces that these men are the chief sources of corruption, I was\r\nunprepared for the sensation of that day. Those financial leaders of\r\nChicago were “mad.” All but one of them became so enraged as they talked\r\nthat they could not behave decently. They rose up, purple in the face,\r\nand cursed reform. They said it had hurt business; it had hurt the town.\r\n“Anarchy,” they called it; “socialism.” They named corporations that had\r\nleft the city; they named others that had planned to come there and had\r\ngone elsewhere. They offered me facts and figures to prove that the city\r\nwas damaged.\r\n\r\n“But isn’t the reform council honest?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Honest! Yes, but—oh, h—l!”\r\n\r\n“And do you realize that all you say means that you regret the passing\r\nof boodle and would prefer to have back the old corrupt Council?”\r\n\r\nThat brought a curse, or a shrewd smile, or a cynical laugh, but that\r\nthey regretted the passing of the boodle régime is the fact, bitter,\r\nastonishing,—but natural enough. We have seen those interests at their\r\nbribery in Philadelphia and St. Louis; we have seen them opposing\r\nreforms in every city. Here in Chicago we have them cursing reform\r\ntriumphant, for, though reform may have been a benefit to the city as a\r\ncommunity of freemen, it is really bad; it has hurt their business!\r\n\r\nChicago has paid dearly for its reform, and reformers elsewhere might as\r\nwell realize that if they succeed, their city will pay, too, at first.\r\nCapital will boycott it and capital will give it a bad name. The bankers\r\nwho offered me proof of their losses were offering me material to write\r\ndown the city. And has Chicago had conspicuous credit for reform? No, it\r\nis in ill-repute, “anarchistic,” “socialistic” (a commercial term for\r\nmunicipal ownership); it is “unfriendly to capital.” But Chicago knows\r\nwhat it is after and it knows the cost. There are business men there who\r\nare willing to pay; they told me so. There are business men on the\r\nexecutive and finance committees of the League and others helping\r\noutside who are among the leaders of Chicago’s business and its bar.\r\nMoreover, there are promoters who expect to like an honest Council. One\r\nsuch told me that he meant to apply for franchises shortly, and he\r\nbelieved that, though it would take longer than bribery to negotiate\r\nfair terms with aldermen who were keen to safeguard the city’s\r\ninterests, yet business could be done on that basis. “Those reform\r\naldermen are slow, but they are fair,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe aldermen are fair. Exasperated as they have been by the trifling,\r\nthe trickery, and past boodling of the street railways, inconvenienced\r\nby bad service, beset by corporation temptations, they are fairer to-day\r\nthan the corporations. They have the street railways now in a corner.\r\nThe negotiations are on, and they could squeeze them with a vengeance.\r\nWhat is the spirit of those aldermen? “Well,” said one to me, “I’ll tell\r\nyou how we feel. We’ve got to get the city’s interests well protected.\r\nThat’s first. But we’ve got more to do than that. They’re shy of us;\r\nthese capitalists don’t know how to handle us. They are not up to the\r\nnew, reform, on-the-level way of doing business. We’ve got to show\r\ncapital that we will give them all that is coming to them, and just a\r\nlittle more—a little more, just to get them used to being honest.” This\r\nwas said without a bit of humor, with some anxiety but no bitterness,\r\nand not a word about socialism or “confiscating municipal ownership”;\r\nthat’s a “capitalistic” bugaboo. Again, one Saturday night a personal\r\nfriend of mine who had lost a half-holiday at a conference with some of\r\nthe leading aldermen, complained of their “preciseness.” “First,” he\r\nsaid, “they had to have every trivial interest of the city protected,\r\nthen, when we seemed to be done, they turned around and argued like\r\ncorporation lawyers for the protection of the corporation.”\r\n\r\nThose Chicago aldermen are an honor to the country! Men like Jackson and\r\nMavor, Herrmann and Werno, would be a credit to any legislative body in\r\nthe land, but there is no such body in the land where they could do more\r\ngood or win more honor. I believe capital will some day prefer to do\r\nbusiness with them than with blackmailers and boodlers anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen that day comes the aldermen will share the credit with the\r\nMunicipal Voters’ League, but all the character and all the ability of\r\nboth Council and League will not explain the reform of Chicago. The\r\ncitizens of that city will take most of the glory. They will have done\r\nit, as they have done it so far.\r\n\r\nSome of my critics have declared they could not believe there was so\r\nmuch difference in the character of communities as I have described. How\r\ncan they account, then, for Chicago? The people there have political\r\nparties, they are partisans. But they know how to vote. Before the\r\nLeague was started, the records show them shifting their vote to the\r\nconfusion of well-laid political plans. So they have always had bosses,\r\nand they have them now, but these bosses admit that they “can’t boss\r\nChicago.” I think this is partly their fault. William Lorimer, the\r\ndominant Republican boss, with whom I talked for an hour one day,\r\ncertainly does not make the impression, either as a man or as a\r\npolitician, that Croker makes, or Durham of Philadelphia. But an\r\noutsider may easily go wrong on a point like this, and we may leave the\r\ncredit where they lay it, with the people of Chicago. Fisher is a more\r\nforceful man than any of the regulars, and, as a politician, compares\r\nwith well-known leaders in any city; but Fisher’s power is the people’s.\r\nHis leadership may have done much, but there is something else deeper\r\nand bigger behind him. At the last aldermanic election, when he\r\ndiscovered on the Saturday before election that the League was\r\nrecommending, against a bad Democrat, a worse Republican, he advised the\r\npeople of that ward to vote for the Socialist; and the people did vote\r\nfor the Socialist, and they elected him. Again, there is the press, the\r\nbest in any of our large cities. There are several newspapers in Chicago\r\nwhich have served always the public interest, and their advice is taken\r\nby their readers. These editors wield, as they wielded before the League\r\ncame, that old-fashioned power of the press which is supposed to have\r\npassed away. Indeed, one of the finest exhibitions of disinterestedness\r\nin this whole reform story was that of these newspapers giving up the\r\nindividual power and credit which their influence on public opinion gave\r\nthem, to the League, behind which they stepped to get together and gain\r\nfor the city what they lost themselves. But this paid them. They did not\r\ndo it with that motive; they did it for the city, but the city has\r\nrecognized the service, as another fact shows: There are bad papers in\r\nChicago—papers that serve special interests—and these don’t pay.\r\n\r\nThe agents of reform have been many and efficient, but back of them all\r\nwas an intelligent, determined people, and they have decided. The city\r\nof Chicago is ruled by the citizens of Chicago. Then why are the\r\ncitizens of Chicago satisfied with half-reform? Why have they reformed\r\nthe Council and left the administrative side of government so far\r\nbehind? “One thing at a time,” they will tell you out there, and it is\r\nwonderful to see them patient after seven years of steadfast, fighting\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the reason. The administration has been improved. It is\r\nabsurdly backward and uneven; the fire department is excellent, the\r\npolice is a disgrace, the law department is expert, the health bureau is\r\ncorrupt, and the street cleaning is hardly worth mention. All this is\r\nCarter H. Harrison. He is an honest man personally, but indolent; a\r\nshrewd politician, and a character with reserve power, but he has no\r\ninitial energy. Without ideals, he does only what is demanded of him. He\r\ndoes not seem to know wrong is wrong, till he is taught; nor to care,\r\ntill criticism arouses his political sense of popular requirement. That\r\nsense is keen, but think of it: Every time Chicago wants to go ahead a\r\nfoot, it has first to push its mayor up inch by inch. In brief, Chicago\r\nis a city that wants to be led, and Carter Harrison, with all his\r\npolitical ambition, honest willingness, and obstinate independence,\r\nsimply follows it. The League leads, and its leaders understand their\r\npeople. Then why does the League submit to Harrison? Why doesn’t the\r\nLeague recommend mayors as well as aldermen? It may some day; but,\r\nsetting out by accident to clean the Council, stop the boodling, and\r\nsettle the city railway troubles, they have been content with Mayor\r\nHarrison because he had learned his lesson on that. And, I think, as\r\nthey say the mayor thinks, that when the people of Chicago get the city\r\nrailways running with enough cars and power; when they have put a stop\r\nto boodling forever; they will take up the administrative side of the\r\ngovernment. A people who can support for seven years one movement toward\r\nreform, should be able to go on forever. With the big boodle beaten,\r\npetty political grafting can easily be stopped. All that will be needed\r\nthen will be a mayor who understands and represents the city; he will be\r\nable to make Chicago as rare an example of good government as it is now\r\nof reform; which will be an advertisement; good business; it will _pay_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Post Scriptum_, December, 1903.—Chicago has taken up since\r\nadministrative graft. The Council is conducting an investigation which\r\nis showing the city government to have been a second Minneapolis. Mayor\r\nHarrison is helping, and the citizens are interested. There is little\r\ndoubt that Chicago will be cleaned up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 NEW YORK: GOOD GOVERNMENT TO THE TEST\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_November, 1903_)\r\n\r\nJust about the time this article will appear, Greater New York will be\r\nholding a local election on what has come to be a national question—good\r\ngovernment. No doubt there will be other “issues.” At this writing\r\n(September 15) the candidates were not named nor the platforms written,\r\nbut the regular politicians hate the main issue, and they have a pretty\r\ntrick of confusing the honest mind and splitting the honest vote by\r\nraising “local issues” which would settle themselves under prolonged\r\nhonest government. So, too, there will probably be some talk about the\r\neffect this election might have upon the next Presidential election;\r\nanother clever fraud which seldom fails to work to the advantage of\r\nrings and grafters, and to the humiliation and despair of good\r\ncitizenship. We have nothing to do with these deceptions. They may count\r\nin New York, they may determine the result, but let them. They are\r\ncommon moves in the corruptionist’s game, and, therefore, fair tests of\r\ncitizenship, for honesty is not the sole qualification for an honest\r\nvoter; intelligence has to play a part, too, and a little intelligence\r\nwould defeat all such tricks. Anyhow, they cannot disturb us. I am\r\nwriting too far ahead, and my readers, for the most part, will be\r\nreading too far away to know or care anything about them. We can grasp\r\nfirmly the essential issues involved and then watch with equanimity the\r\nreturns for the answer, plain yes or no, which New York will give to the\r\nonly questions that concern us all:[6]\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Tammany tried to introduce national issues, but failed, and “good\r\n  government” was practically the only question raised.\r\n\r\nDo we Americans really want good government? Do we know it when we see\r\nit? Are we capable of that sustained good citizenship which alone can\r\nmake democracy a success? Or, to save our pride, one other: Is the New\r\nYork way the right road to permanent reform?\r\n\r\nFor New York has good government, or, to be more precise, it has a good\r\nadministration. It is not a question there of turning the rascals out\r\nand putting the honest men into their places. The honest men are in, and\r\nthis election is to decide whether they are to be kept in, which is a\r\nvery different matter. Any people is capable of rising in wrath to\r\noverthrow bad rulers. Philadelphia has done that in its day. New York\r\nhas done it several times. With fresh and present outrages to avenge,\r\nparticular villains to punish, and the mob sense of common anger to\r\nexcite, it is an emotional gratification to go out with the crowd and\r\n“smash something.” This is nothing but revolt, and even monarchies have\r\nuprisings to the credit of their subjects. But revolt is not reform, and\r\none revolutionary administration is not good government. That we free\r\nAmericans are capable of such assertions of our sovereign power, we have\r\nproven; our lynchers are demonstrating it every day. That we can go\r\nforth singly also, and, without passion, with nothing but mild approval\r\nand dull duty to impel us, vote intelligently to sustain a fairly good\r\nmunicipal government, remains to be shown. And that is what New York has\r\nthe chance to show; New York, the leading exponent of the great American\r\nanti-bad government movement for good government.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, the standard course of municipal reform, the\r\npoliticians are permitted to organize a party on national lines, take\r\nover the government, corrupt and deceive the people, and run things for\r\nthe private profit of the boss and his ring, till the corruption becomes\r\nrampant and a scandal. Then the reformers combine the opposition: the\r\ncorrupt and unsatisfied minority, the disgruntled groups of the\r\nmajority, the reform organizations; they nominate a mixed ticket, headed\r\nby a “good business man” for mayor, make a “hot campaign” against the\r\ngovernment with “Stop, thief!” for the cry, and make a “clean sweep.”\r\nUsually, this effects only the disciplining of the reckless grafters and\r\nthe improvement of the graft system of corrupt government. The good\r\nmayor turns out to be weak or foolish or “not so good.” The politicians\r\n“come it over him,” as they did over the business mayors who followed\r\nthe “Gas Ring” revolt in Philadelphia, or the people become disgusted as\r\nthey did with Mayor Strong, who was carried into office by the\r\nanti-Tammany rebellion in New York after the Lexow exposures.\r\nPhiladelphia gave up after its disappointment, and that is what most\r\ncities do. The repeated failures of revolutionary reform to accomplish\r\nmore than the strengthening of the machine have so discredited this\r\nmethod that wide-awake reformers in several cities—Pittsburg,\r\nCincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis, and others—are following\r\nthe lead of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago plan does not depend for success upon any one man or any one\r\nyear’s work, nor upon excitement or any sort of bad government. The\r\nreformers there have no ward organizations, no machine at all; their\r\nappeal is solely to the intelligence of the voter and their power rests\r\nupon that. This is democratic and political, not bourgeois and business\r\nreform, and it is interesting to note that whereas reformers elsewhere\r\nare forever seeking to concentrate all the powers in the mayor, those of\r\nChicago talk of stripping the mayor to a figurehead and giving his\r\npowers to the aldermen who directly represent the people, and who change\r\nyear by year.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago way is but one way, however, and a new one, and it must be\r\nremembered that this plan has not yet produced a good administration.\r\nNew York has that. Chicago, after seven years’ steady work, has a body\r\nof aldermen honest enough and competent to defend the city’s interests\r\nagainst boodle capital, but that is about all; it has a wretched\r\nadministration. New York has stuck to the old way. Provincial and\r\nself-centered, it hardly knows there is any other. Chicago laughs and\r\nother cities wonder, but never mind, New York, by persistence, has at\r\nlast achieved a good administration. Will the New Yorkers continue it?\r\nThat is the question. What Chicago has, it has secure. Its independent\r\ncitizenship is trained to vote every time and to vote for uninteresting,\r\ngood aldermen. New York has an independent vote of 100,000, a decisive\r\nminority, but the voters have been taught to vote only once in a long\r\nwhile, only when excited by picturesque leadership and sensational\r\nexposures, only _against_. New York has been so far an anti-bad\r\ngovernment, anti-Tammany, not a good-government town. Can it vote,\r\nwithout Tammany in to incite it, for a good mayor? I think this\r\nelection, which will answer this question, should decide other cities\r\nhow to go about reform.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Mayor Seth Low may not have been perfect, not in\r\nthe best European sense: not expert, not co-ordinated, certainly not\r\nwise. Nevertheless, for an American city, it has been not only honest,\r\nbut able, undeniably one of the best in the whole country. Some of the\r\ndepartments have been dishonest; others have been so inefficient that\r\nthey made the whole administration ridiculous. But what of that?\r\nCorruption also is clumsy and makes absurd mistakes when it is new and\r\nuntrained. The “oaths” and ceremonies and much of the boodling of the\r\nSt. Louis ring seemed laughable to my corrupt friends in Philadelphia\r\nand Tammany Hall, and New York’s own Tweed régime was “no joke,” only\r\nbecause it was so general, and so expensive—to New York. It took time to\r\nperfect the “Philadelphia plan” of misgovernment, and it took time to\r\neducate Croker and develop his Tammany Hall. It will take time to evolve\r\nmasters of the (in America) unstudied art of municipal government—time\r\nand demand. So far there has been no market for municipal experts in\r\nthis country. All we are clamoring for to-day in our meek, weak-hearted\r\nway, is that mean, rudimentary virtue miscalled “common honesty.” Do we\r\nreally want it? Certainly Mayor Low is pecuniarily honest. He is more;\r\nhe is conscientious and experienced and personally efficient. Bred to\r\nbusiness, he rose above it, adding to the training he acquired in the\r\nconduct of an international commercial house, two terms as mayor of\r\nBrooklyn, and to that again a very effective administration, as\r\npresident, of the business of Columbia University. He began his\r\nmayoralty with a study of the affairs of New York; he has said himself\r\nthat he devoted eight months to its finances: and he mastered this\r\ndepartment and is admitted to be the master in detail of every\r\ndepartment which has engaged his attention. In other words, Mr. Low has\r\nlearned the business of New York; he is just about competent now to\r\nbecome the mayor of a great city. Is there a demand for Mr. Low?\r\n\r\nNo. When I made my inquiries—before the lying had begun—the Fusion\r\nleaders of the anti-Tammany forces, who nominated Mr. Low, said they\r\nmight renominate him. “Who else was there?” they asked. And they thought\r\nhe “might” be re-elected. The alternative was Richard Croker or Charles\r\nF. Murphy, his man, for no matter who Tammany’s candidate for mayor was,\r\nif Tammany won, Tammany’s boss would rule. The personal issue was plain\r\nenough. Yet was there no assurance for Mr. Low.\r\n\r\nWhy? There are many forms of the answer given, but they nearly all\r\nreduce themselves to one—the man’s personality. It is not very engaging.\r\nMr. Low has many respectable qualities, but these never are amiable.\r\n“Did you ever see his smile?” said a politician who was trying to\r\naccount for his instinctive dislike for the mayor. I had; there is no\r\nlaughter back of it, no humor, and no sense thereof. The appealing human\r\nelement is lacking all through. His good abilities are self-sufficient;\r\nhis dignity is smug; his courtesy seems not kind; his self-reliance is\r\ncalled obstinacy because, though he listens, he seems not to care;\r\nthough he understands, he shows no sympathy, and when he decides, his\r\nreasoning is private. His most useful virtues—probity, intelligence, and\r\nconscientiousness—in action are often an irritation; they are so\r\ncontented. Mr. Low is the bourgeois reformer type. Even where he\r\ncompromises he gets no credit, his concessions make the impression of\r\nsurrenders. A politician can say “no” and make a friend, where Mr. Low\r\nwill lose one by saying “yes.” Cold and impersonal, he cools even his\r\nheads of departments. Loyal public service they give, because his taste\r\nis for men who would do their duty for their own sake, not for his, and\r\nthat excellent service the city has had. But members of Mr. Low’s\r\nadministration helped me to characterize him; they could not help it.\r\nMr. Low’s is not a lovable character.\r\n\r\nBut what of that? Why should his colleagues love him? Why should anybody\r\nlike him? Why should he seek to charm, win affection, and make friends?\r\nHe was elected to attend to the business of his office and to appoint\r\nsubordinates who should attend to the business of their offices, not to\r\nmake “political strength” and win elections. William Travers Jerome, the\r\npicturesque District Attorney, whose sincerity and intellectual honesty\r\nmade sure the election of Mr. Low two years ago, detests him as a\r\nbourgeois, but the mayoralty is held in New York to be a bourgeois\r\noffice. Mr. Low is the ideal product of the New York theory that\r\nmunicipal government is business, not politics, and that a business man\r\nwho would manage the city as he would a business corporation, would\r\nsolve for us all our troubles. Chicago reformers think we have got to\r\nsolve our own problems; that government is political business; that men\r\nbrought up in politics and experienced in public office will make the\r\nbest administrators. They have refused to turn from their politician\r\nmayor, Carter H. Harrison, for the most ideal business candidate, and I\r\nhave heard them say that when Chicago was ripe for a better mayor they\r\nwould prefer a candidate chosen from among their well-tried aldermen.\r\nAgain, I say, however, that this is only one way, and New York has\r\nanother, and this other is the standard American way.\r\n\r\nBut again I say, also, that the New York way is on trial, for New York\r\nhas what the whole country has been looking for in all municipal\r\ncrises—the non-political ruler. Mr. Low’s very faults, which I have\r\nemphasized for the purpose, emphasize the point. They make it impossible\r\nfor him to be a politician even if he should wish to be. As for his\r\nselfishness, his lack of tact, his coldness—these are of no consequence.\r\nHe has done his duty all the better for them. Admit that he is\r\nuninteresting; what does that matter? He has served the city. Will the\r\ncity not vote for him because it does not like the way he smiles? Absurd\r\nas it sounds, that is what all I have heard against Low amounts to. But\r\nto reduce the situation to a further absurdity, let us eliminate\r\naltogether the personality of Mr. Low. Let us suppose he has no smile,\r\nno courtesy, no dignity, no efficiency, no personality at all; suppose\r\nhe were an It and had not given New York a good administration, but had\r\nonly honestly tried. What then?\r\n\r\nTammany Hall? That is the alternative. The Tammany politicians see it\r\njust as clear as that, and they are not in the habit of deceiving\r\nthemselves. They say “it is a Tammany year,” “Tammany’s turn.” They say\r\nit and they believe it. They study the people, and they know it is all a\r\nmatter of citizenship; they admit that they cannot win unless a goodly\r\npart of the independent vote goes to them; and still they say they can\r\nbeat Mr. Low or any other man the anti-Tammany forces may nominate. So\r\nwe are safe in eliminating Mr. Low and reducing the issue to plain\r\nTammany.\r\n\r\nTammany is bad government; not inefficient, but dishonest; not a party,\r\nnot a delusion and a snare, hardly known by its party name—Democracy;\r\nhaving little standing in the national councils of the party and caring\r\nlittle for influence outside of the city. Tammany is Tammany, the\r\nembodiment of corruption. All the world knows and all the world may know\r\nwhat it is and what it is after. For hypocrisy is not a Tammany vice.\r\nTammany is for Tammany, and the Tammany men say so. Other rings proclaim\r\nlies and make pretensions; other rogues talk about the tariff and\r\nimperialism. Tammany is honestly dishonest. Time and time again, in\r\nprivate and in public, the leaders, big and little, have said they are\r\nout for themselves and their own; not for the public, but for “me and my\r\nfriends”; not for New York, but for Tammany. Richard Croker said under\r\noath once that he worked for his own pockets all the time, and Tom\r\nGrady, the Tammany orator, has brought his crowds to their feet cheering\r\nsentiments as primitive, stated with candor as brutal.\r\n\r\nThe man from Mars would say that such an organization, so\r\nself-confessed, could not be very dangerous to an intelligent people.\r\nForeigners marvel at it and at us, and even Americans—Pennsylvanians,\r\nfor example—cannot understand why we New Yorkers regard Tammany as so\r\nformidable. I think I can explain it. Tammany is corruption with\r\nconsent; it is bad government founded on the suffrages of the people.\r\nThe Philadelphia machine is more powerful. It rules Philadelphia by\r\nfraud and force and does not require the votes of the people. The\r\nPhiladelphians do not vote for their machine; their machine votes for\r\nthem. Tammany used to stuff the ballot boxes and intimidate voters;\r\nto-day there is practically none of that. Tammany rules, when it rules,\r\nby right of the votes of the people of New York.\r\n\r\nTammany corruption is democratic corruption. That of the Philadelphia\r\nring is rooted in special interests. Tammany, too, is allied with\r\n“vested interests”—but Tammany labors under disadvantages not known in\r\nPhiladelphia. The Philadelphia ring is of the same party that rules the\r\nState and the nation, and the local ring forms a living chain with the\r\nState and national rings. Tammany is a purely local concern. With a\r\nmajority only in old New York, it has not only to buy what it wants from\r\nthe Republican majority in the State, but must trade to get the whole\r\ncity. Big business everywhere is the chief source of political\r\ncorruption, and it is one source in New York; but most of the big\r\nbusinesses represented in New York have no plants there. Offices there\r\nare, and head offices, of many trusts and railways, for example, but\r\nthat is all. There are but two railway terminals in the city, and but\r\nthree railways use them. These have to do more with Albany than New\r\nYork. So with Wall Street. Philadelphia’s stock exchange deals largely\r\nin Pennsylvania securities, New York’s in those of the whole United\r\nStates. There is a small Wall Street group that specializes in local\r\ncorporations, and they are active and give Tammany a Wall Street\r\nconnection, but the biggest and the majority of our financial leaders,\r\nbribers though they may be in other cities and even in New York State,\r\nare independent of Tammany Hall, and can be honest citizens at home.\r\nFrom this class, indeed, New York can, and often does, draw some of its\r\nreformers. Not so Philadelphia. That bourgeois opposition which has\r\npersisted for thirty years in the fight against Tammany corruption was\r\nsquelched in Philadelphia after its first great uprising. Matt Quay,\r\nthrough the banks, railways, and other business interests, was able to\r\nreach it. A large part of his power is negative; there is no opposition.\r\nTammany’s power is positive. Tammany cannot reach all the largest\r\ninterests and its hold is upon the people.\r\n\r\nTammany’s democratic corruption rests upon the corruption of the people,\r\nthe plain people, and there lies its great significance; its grafting\r\nsystem is one in which more individuals share than any I have studied.\r\nThe people themselves get very little; they come cheap, but they are\r\ninterested. Divided into districts, the organization subdivides them\r\ninto precincts or neighborhoods, and their sovereign power, in the form\r\nof votes, is bought up by kindness and petty privileges. They are forced\r\nto a surrender, when necessary, by intimidation, but the leader and his\r\ncaptains have their hold because they take care of their own. They speak\r\npleasant words, smile friendly smiles, notice the baby, give picnics up\r\nthe River or the Sound, or a slap on the back; find jobs, most of them\r\nat the city’s expense, but they have also news-stands, peddling\r\nprivileges, railroad and other business places to dispense; they permit\r\nviolations of the law, and, if a man has broken the law without\r\npermission, see him through the court. Though a blow in the face is as\r\nreadily given as a shake of the hand, Tammany kindness is real kindness,\r\nand will go far, remember long, and take infinite trouble for a friend.\r\n\r\nThe power that is gathered up thus cheaply, like garbage, in the\r\ndistricts is concentrated in the district leader, who in turn passes it\r\non through a general committee to the boss. This is a form of living\r\ngovernment, extra-legal, but very actual, and, though the beginnings of\r\nit are purely democratic, it develops at each stage into an autocracy.\r\nIn Philadelphia the boss appoints a district leader and gives him power.\r\nTammany has done that in two or three notable instances, but never\r\nwithout causing a bitter fight which lasts often for years. In\r\nPhiladelphia the State boss designates the city boss. In New York,\r\nCroker has failed signally to maintain vice-bosses whom he appointed.\r\nThe boss of Tammany Hall is a growth, and just as Croker grew, so has\r\nCharles F. Murphy grown up to Croker’s place. Again, whereas in\r\nPhiladelphia the boss and his ring handle and keep almost all of the\r\ngraft, leaving little to the district leaders, in New York the district\r\nleaders share handsomely in the spoils.\r\n\r\nThere is more to share in New York. It is impossible to estimate the\r\namount of it, not only for me, but for anybody. No Tammany man knows it\r\nall. Police friends of mine say that the Tammany leaders never knew how\r\nrich police corruption was till the Lexow committee exposed it, and that\r\nthe politicians who had been content with small presents, contributions,\r\nand influence, “did not butt in” for their share till they saw by the\r\ntestimony of frightened police grafters that the department was worth\r\nfrom four to five millions a year. The items are so incredible that I\r\nhesitate to print them. Devery told a friend once that in one year the\r\npolice graft was “something over $3,000,000.” Afterward the syndicate\r\nwhich divided the graft under Devery took in for thirty-six months\r\n$400,000 a month from gambling and poolrooms alone. Saloon bribers,\r\ndisorderly house blackmail, policy, etc., etc., bring this total up to\r\namazing proportions.\r\n\r\nYet this was but one department, and a department that was overlooked by\r\nTammany for years. The annual budget of the city is about $100,000,000,\r\nand though the power that comes of the expenditure of that amount is\r\nenormous and the opportunities for rake-offs infinite, this sum is not\r\none-half of the resources of Tammany when it is in power. Her resources\r\nare the resources of the city as a business, as a political, as a social\r\npower. If Tammany could be incorporated, and all its earnings, both\r\nlegitimate and illegitimate, gathered up and paid over in dividends, the\r\nstockholders would get more than the New York Central bond and stock\r\nholders, more than the Standard Oil stockholders, and the controlling\r\nclique would wield a power equal to that of the United States Steel\r\nCompany. Tammany, when in control of New York, takes out of the city\r\nunbelievable millions of dollars a year.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the leaders are all rich; no wonder so many more Tammany men\r\nare rich than are the leaders in any other town; no wonder Tammany is\r\nliberal in its division of the graft. Croker took the best and the\r\nsafest of it, and he accepted shares in others. He was “in on the Wall\r\nStreet end,” and the Tammany clique of financiers have knocked down and\r\nbought up at low prices Manhattan Railway stock by threats of the city’s\r\npower over the road; they have been let in on Metropolitan deals and on\r\nthe Third Avenue Railroad grab; the Ice trust is a Tammany trust; they\r\nhave banks and trust companies, and through the New York Realty Company\r\nare forcing alliances with such financial groups as that of the Standard\r\nOil Company. Croker shared in these deals and businesses. He sold\r\njudgeships, taking his pay in the form of contributions to the Tammany\r\ncampaign fund, of which he was treasurer, and he had the judges take\r\nfrom the regular real estate exchange all the enormous real estate\r\nbusiness that passed through the courts, and give it to an exchange\r\nconnected with the real estate business of his firm, Peter F. Meyer &\r\nCo. This alone would maintain a ducal estate in England. But his real\r\nestate business was greater than that. It had extraordinary legal\r\nfacilities, the free advertising of abuse, the prestige of political\r\nprivilege, all of which brought in trade; and it had advance information\r\nand followed, with profitable deals, great public improvements.\r\n\r\nThough Croker said he worked for his own pockets all the time, and did\r\ntake the best of the graft, he was not “hoggish.” Some of the richest\r\ngraft in the city is in the Department of Buildings: $100,000,000 a year\r\ngoes into building operations in New York. All of this, from out-houses\r\nto sky-scrapers, is subject to very precise laws and regulations, most\r\nof them wise, some impossible. The Building Department has the\r\nenforcement of these; it passes upon all construction, private and\r\npublic, at all stages, from plan-making to actual completion; and can\r\ncause not only “unavoidable delay,” but can wink at most profitable\r\nviolations. Architects and builders had to stand in with the department.\r\nThey called on the right man and they settled on a scale which was not\r\nfixed, but which generally was on the basis of the department’s estimate\r\nof a fair half of the value of the saving in time or bad material. This\r\nbrought in at least a banker’s percentage on one hundred millions a\r\nyear. Croker, so far as I can make out, took none of this! it was let\r\nout to other leaders and was their own graft.\r\n\r\nDistrict Attorney William Travers Jerome has looked into the Dock\r\nDepartment, and he knows things which he yet may prove. This is an\r\nimportant investigation for two reasons. It is very large graft, and the\r\nnew Tammany leader, Charlie Murphy, had it. New York wants to know more\r\nabout Murphy, and it should want to know about the management of its\r\ndocks, since, just as other cities have their corrupt dealings with\r\nrailways and their terminals, so New York’s great terminal business is\r\nwith steamships and docks. These docks should pay the city handsomely.\r\nMr. Murphy says they shouldn’t; he is wise, as Croker was before he\r\nbecame old and garrulous, and, as Tammany men put it, “keeps his mouth\r\nshut,” but he did say that the docks should not be run for revenue to\r\nthe city, but for their own improvement. The Dock Board has exclusive\r\nand private and secret control of the expenditure of $10,000,000 a year.\r\nNo wonder Murphy chose it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to follow all New York graft from its source to its\r\nfinal destination. It is impossible to follow here the course of that\r\nwhich is well known to New Yorkers. There are public works for Tammany\r\ncontractors. There are private works for Tammany contractors, and\r\ncorporations and individuals find it expedient to let it go to Tammany\r\ncontractors. Tammany has a very good system of grafting on public works;\r\nI mean that it is “good” from the criminal point of view—and so it has\r\nfor the furnishing of supplies. Low bids and short deliveries, generally\r\nspeaking (and that is the only way I can speak here), is the method. But\r\nthe Tammany system, as a whole, is weak.\r\n\r\nTammany men as grafters have a confidence in their methods and system,\r\nwhich, in the light of such perfection as that of Philadelphia, is\r\namusing, and the average New Yorker takes in “the organization” a queer\r\nsort of pride, which is ignorant and provincial. Tammany is ‘way behind\r\nthe times. It is growing; it has improved. In Tweed’s day the\r\npoliticians stole from the city treasury, divided the money on the steps\r\nof the City Hall, and, not only the leaders, big and little, but heelers\r\nand outsiders; not only Tweed, but ward carpenters robbed the city; not\r\nonly politicians, but newspapers and citizens were “in on the divvy.”\r\nNew York, not Tammany alone, was corrupt. When the exposure came, and\r\nTweed asked his famous question, “What are you going to do about it?”\r\nthe ring mayor, A. Oakey Hall, asked another as significant. It was\r\nreported that suit was to be brought against the ring to recover stolen\r\nfunds. “Who is going to sue?” said Mayor Hall, who could not think of\r\nanybody of importance sufficiently without sin to throw the first stone.\r\nStealing was stopped and grafting was made more businesslike, but still\r\nit was too general, and the boodling for the Broadway street railway\r\nfranchise prompted a still closer grip on the business. The organization\r\nsince then has been gradually concentrating the control of graft. Croker\r\ndid not proceed so far along the line as the Philadelphia ring has, as\r\nthe police scandals showed. After the Lexow exposures, Tammany took over\r\nthat graft, but still let it go practically by districts, and the police\r\ncaptains still got a third. After the Mazet exposures, Devery became\r\nChief, and the police graft was so concentrated that the division was\r\nreduced to fourteen parts. Again, later, it was reduced to a syndicate\r\nof four or five men, with a dribble of miscellaneous graft for the\r\npolice. In Philadelphia the police have nothing to do with the police\r\ngraft; a policeman may collect it, but he acts for a politician, who in\r\nturn passes it up to a small ring. That is the drift in New York. Under\r\nDevery the police officers got comparatively little, and the rank and\r\nfile themselves were blackmailed for transfers and promotions, for\r\nremittances of fines, and in a dozen other petty ways.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia is the end toward which New York under Tammany is driving\r\nas fast as the lower intelligence and higher conceit of its leaders will\r\nlet it. In Philadelphia one very small ring gets everything, dividing\r\nthe whole as it pleases, and not all those in the inner ring are\r\npoliticians. Trusting few individuals, they are safe from exposure, more\r\npowerful, more deliberate, and they are wise as politicians. When, as in\r\nNew York, the number of grafters is large, this delicate business is in\r\nsome hands that are rapacious. The police grafters, for example, in\r\nDevery’s day, were not content with the amounts collected from the big\r\nvices. They cultivated minor vices, like policy, to such an extent that\r\nthe Policy King was caught and sent to prison, and Devery’s ward-man,\r\nGlennon, was pushed into so tight a hole that there was danger that\r\nDistrict Attorney Jerome would get past Glennon to Devery and the\r\nsyndicate. The murder of a witness the night he was in the Tenderloin\r\npolice station served to save the day. But, worst of all, Tammany, the\r\n“friend of the people,” permitted the organization of a band of\r\nso-called Cadets, who made a business, under the protection of the\r\npolice, of ruining the daughters of the tenements and even of catching\r\nand imprisoning in disorderly houses the wives of poor men. This horrid\r\ntraffic never was exposed; it could not and cannot be. Vicious women\r\nwere “planted” in tenement houses and (I know this personally) the\r\nchildren of decent parents counted the customers, witnessed their\r\ntransactions with these creatures, and, as a father told with shame and\r\ntears, reported totals at the family table.\r\n\r\nTammany leaders are usually the natural leaders of the people in these\r\ndistricts, and they are originally good-natured, kindly men. No one has\r\na more sincere liking than I for some of those common but generous\r\nfellows; their charity is real, at first. But they sell out their own\r\npeople. They do give them coal and help them in their private troubles,\r\nbut, as they grow rich and powerful, the kindness goes out of the\r\ncharity and they not only collect at their saloons or in rents—cash for\r\ntheir “goodness”; they not only ruin fathers and sons and cause the\r\ntroubles they relieve; they sacrifice the children in the schools; let\r\nthe Health Department neglect the tenements, and, worst of all, plant\r\nvice in the neighborhood and in the homes of the poor.\r\n\r\nThis is not only bad; it is bad politics; it has defeated Tammany. Woe\r\nto New York when Tammany learns better. Honest fools talk of the reform\r\nof Tammany Hall. It is an old hope, this, and twice it has been\r\ndisappointed, but it is not vain. That is the real danger ahead. The\r\nreform of a corrupt ring means, as I have said before, the reform of its\r\nsystem of grafting and a wise consideration of certain features of good\r\ngovernment. Croker turned his “best chief of police,” William S. Devery,\r\nout of Tammany Hall, and, slow and old as he was, Croker learned what\r\nclean streets were from Colonel Waring, and gave them. Now there is a\r\nnew boss, a young man, Charles F. Murphy, and unknown to New Yorkers. He\r\nlooks dense, but he acts with force, decision, and skill. The new mayor\r\nwill be his man. He may divide with Croker and leave to the “old man”\r\nall his accustomed graft, but Charlie Murphy will rule Tammany and, if\r\nTammany is elected, New York also. Lewis Nixon is urging Murphy\r\npublicly, as I write, to declare against the police scandals and all the\r\nworst practices of Tammany. Lewis Nixon is an honest man, but he was one\r\nof the men Croker tried to appoint leader of Tammany Hall. And when he\r\nresigned Mr. Nixon said that he found that a man could not keep that\r\nleadership and his self-respect. Yet Mr. Nixon is a type of the man who\r\nthinks Tammany would be fit to rule New York if the organization would\r\n“reform.”\r\n\r\nAs a New Yorker, I fear Murphy will prove sagacious enough to do just\r\nthat: stop the scandal, put all the graft in the hands of a few tried\r\nand true men, and give the city what it would call good government.\r\nMurphy says he will nominate for mayor a man so “good” that his goodness\r\nwill astonish New York. I don’t fear a bad Tammany mayor; I dread the\r\nelection of a good one. For I have been to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia had a bad ring mayor, a man who promoted the graft and\r\ncaused scandal after scandal. The leaders there, the wisest political\r\ngrafters in this country, learned a great lesson from that. As one of\r\nthem said to me:\r\n\r\n“The American people don’t mind grafting, but they hate scandals. They\r\ndon’t kick so much on a jiggered public contract for a boulevard, but\r\nthey want the boulevard and no fuss and no dust. We want to give them\r\nthat. We want to give them what they really want, a quiet Sabbath, safe\r\nstreets, orderly nights, and homes secure. They let us have the police\r\ngraft. But this mayor was a hog. You see, he had but one term and he\r\ncould get his share only on what was made in his term. He not only took\r\na hog’s share off what was coming, but he wanted everything to come in\r\nhis term. So I’m down on grafting mayors and grafting office holders. I\r\ntell you it’s good politics to have honest men in office. I mean men\r\nthat are personally honest.”\r\n\r\nSo they got John Weaver for mayor, and honest John Weaver is checking\r\ncorruption, restoring order, and doing a great many good things, which\r\nit is “good politics” to do. For he is satisfying the people, soothing\r\ntheir ruffled pride, and reconciling them to machine rule. I have\r\nletters from friends of mine there, honest men, who wish me to bear\r\nwitness to the goodness of Mayor Weaver. I do. And I believe that if the\r\nPhiladelphia machine leaders are as careful with Mayor Weaver as they\r\nhave been and let him continue to give to the end as good government as\r\nhe has given so far, the “Philadelphia plan” of graft will last and\r\nPhiladelphia will never again be a free American city.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia and New York began about the same time, some thirty years\r\nago, to reform their city governments. Philadelphia got “good\r\ngovernment”—what the Philadelphians call good—from a corrupt ring and\r\nquit, satisfied to be a scandal to the nation and a disgrace to\r\ndemocracy. New York has gone on fighting, advancing and retreating, for\r\nthirty years, till now it has achieved the beginnings, under Mayor Low,\r\nof a government for the people. Do the New Yorkers know it? Do they\r\ncare? They are Americans, mixed and typical; do we Americans really want\r\ngood government? Or, as I said at starting, have they worked for thirty\r\nyears along the wrong road—crowded with unhappy American cities—the road\r\nto Philadelphia and despair?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Post Scriptum_: Mayor Low was nominated on the Fusion ticket. Tammany\r\nnominated George B. McClellan. The local corporations contributed\r\nheavily to the Tammany campaign fund and the people of New York elected\r\nthe Tammany ticket by a decisive majority of 62,696. The vote was:\r\nMcClellan, 314,782; Low, 252,086.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         By Edward W.

Mr. Townsend, gives us\r\nnot a picture, but the bustling, nerve-racking pageant itself. The titan\r\nstruggles in the world of finance, the huge hoaxes in sensational\r\nnewspaperdom, the gay life of the theatre, opera, and restaurant, and\r\nthen the calmer and comforting domestic scenes of wholesome living,\r\npass, as actualities, before our very eyes. In this turbulent maelstrom\r\nof ambition, he finds room for love and romance also.\r\n\r\nThere is a bountiful array of characters, admirably drawn, and\r\nespecially delightful are the two emotional and excitable lovers, young\r\nBannister and Gertrude Carr. The book is unlike Mr. Townsend’s “Chimmie\r\nFadden” in everything but its intimate knowledge of New York life.\r\n\r\n                         Cloth, 12mo      $1.50\r\n\r\n                        McClure, Phillips & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           By A.

In Venice he\r\nhas an interesting romantic escapade which causes him the loss of an\r\near. With the utmost bravery and cunning he captures the Spanish city of\r\nSaragossa; in Portugal he saves the army; in Russia he feeds the\r\nstarving soldiers by supplies obtained at Minsk, after a wonderful ride.\r\nEverywhere else he is just as marvelous, and at Waterloo he is the\r\ncenter of the whole battle.\r\n\r\nFor all his lumbering vanity he is a genial old soul and a remarkably\r\nvivid story-teller.\r\n\r\nIllustrated by W.

Claude Mercier, the student, seeing the plot in which\r\nthe girl he loves is involved, yet helpless to divulge it, finds at last\r\nhis opportunity when the treacherous men of Savoy are admitted within\r\nGeneva’s walls, and in a night of whirlwind fighting saves the city by\r\nhis courage and address. For fire and spirit there are few chapters in\r\nmodern literature such as those which picture the splendid defence of\r\nGeneva, by the staid, churchly, heroic burghers, fighting in their own\r\nblood under the divided leadership of the fat Syndic, Baudichon, and the\r\nbandy-legged sailor, Jehan Brosse, winning the battle against the armed\r\nand armored forces of the invaders.\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Solomon J.

Barlasch—“Papa\r\nBarlasch of the Guard, Italy, Egypt, the Danube”—a veteran in the Little\r\nCorporal’s service—is the dominant figure of the story. Quartered on a\r\ndistinguished family in the historic town of Dantzig, he gives his life\r\nto the romance of Desirée, the daughter of the family, and Louis d’\r\nArragon, whose cousin she has married and parted with at the church\r\ndoor. Louis’s search with Barlasch for the missing Charles gives an\r\nunforgettable picture of the terrible retreat from Russia; and as a\r\ncompanion picture there is the heroic defence of Dantzig by Rapp and his\r\nlittle army of sick and starving. At the last Barlasch, learning of the\r\ndeath of Charles, plans and executes the escape of Desirée from the\r\nbeleaguered town to join Louis.\r\n\r\nIllustrated by the Kinneys.\r\n\r\n                                 $1.50\r\n\r\n                        McClure, Phillips & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            By Henry Harland\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Author of “The Cardinal’s Snuff Box.”\r\n\r\n                           MY FRIEND PROSPERO\r\n\r\n                                   ❦\r\n\r\nEverything that has ever delighted you in Mr. Harland’s work is to be\r\nfound at its best in _My Friend Prospero_.

James Galloway founds his fortune on a\r\nfraud. He ruins the man who has befriended him and steals away his\r\nbusiness. Vast railroad operations next claim his attention. He becomes\r\na bird of prey in the financial world. One by one he forsakes his\r\nprinciples; he becomes a hypocrite, posing, even to himself. With the\r\ndegeneration of his moral character come domestic troubles. His wife\r\ngrows to despise him. One of his sons becomes a spendthrift; the other a\r\nforger. His daughter, Helen, alone retains any affection for him. His\r\nattempts to force his family into the most exclusive circles subject him\r\nand them to mortifying rebuffs, for all his millions cannot overcome the\r\nill-repute of his name. At last, with his hundred millions won, his\r\nhouse the finest in America, his name a name to conjure with in the\r\nfinancial world, he realizes that the goal he has reached was not worth\r\nthe race. Still he clings to his old ways, and dies in a fit of anger,\r\nhaggling over his daughter’s dowry.\r\n\r\n                                 $1.50.\r\n\r\n                        McClure, Phillips & Co.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
