In preparing\r\n     the learned and elaborate work, which will give the name of the\r\n     author an honourable place on the distinguished list of American\r\n     historians, Professor Baird has made a judicious use of the\r\n     researches and discoveries which, during the last thirty years,\r\n     have shed a fresh light on the history of France at the era of the\r\n     Reformation. Among the ample stores of knowledge which have been\r\n     laid open to his inquiries are the archives of the principal\r\n     capitals of Europe, which have been thoroughly explored for the\r\n     first time during that period. Numerous manuscripts of great value,\r\n     for the most part unknown to the learned world, have been rescued\r\n     from obscurity. At the side of the voluminous chronicles long since\r\n     printed, a rich abundance of contemporary correspondence and\r\n     hitherto inedited memoirs has accumulated, which afford a copious\r\n     collection of life-like and trustworthy views of the past. The\r\n     secrets of diplomacy have been revealed. The official statements\r\n     drawn up for the public may now be tested by the more truthful and\r\n     unguarded accounts conveyed in cipher to all the foreign courts of\r\n     Europe. Of not less importance, perhaps, than the official\r\n     publications are the fruits of private research, among which are\r\n     several valuable collections of original documents. While the\r\n     author has not failed to enrich his pages with the materials\r\n     derived from these and similar sources, he has made a careful and\r\n     patient study of the host of original chronicles, histories, and\r\n     kindred productions which have long been more or less familiar to\r\n     the world of letters. The fruits of his studious labours, as\r\n     presented in these volumes, attest his diligence, his fidelity, his\r\n     equipoise of judgment, his fairness of mind, his clearness of\r\n     perception, and his accuracy of statement.\r\n\r\n     \"While the research and well-digested erudition exhibited in this\r\n     work are eminently creditable to the learning and scholarship of\r\n     the author, its literary execution amply attests the excellence of\r\n     his taste, and his judgment and skill in the art of composition.\r\n     His work is one of the most important recent contributions to\r\n     American literature, and is entitled to a sincere greeting for its\r\n     manifold learning and scholarly spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE HUGUENOTS.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nHENRY M. BAIRD,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR IN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IN TWO VOLUMES._\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\n_FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FRENCH\r\nREFORMATION TO THE EDICT OF\r\nJANUARY (1562)._\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon:\r\nHODDER AND STOUGHTON,\r\n27, PATERNOSTER ROW.\r\nMDCCCLXXX.\r\n\r\nHazell, Watson, and Viney, Printers, London and Aylesbury\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of about half a century with which these volumes are\r\nconcerned may properly be regarded as the formative age of the Huguenots\r\nof France. It included the first planting of the reformed doctrines, and\r\nthe steady growth of the Reformation in spite of obloquy and\r\npersecution, whether exercised under the forms of law or vented in\r\nlawless violence. It saw the gathering and the regular organization of\r\nthe reformed communities, as well as their consolidation into one of the\r\nmost orderly and zealous churches of the Protestant family. It witnessed\r\nthe failure of the bloody legislation of three successive monarchs, and\r\nthe equally abortive efforts of a fourth monarch to destroy the\r\nHuguenots, first with the sword and afterward with the dagger. At the\r\nclose of this period the faith and resolution of the Huguenots had\r\nsurvived four sanguinary wars into which they had been driven by their\r\nimplacable enemies. They were just entering upon a fifth war, under\r\nfavorable auspices, for they had made it manifest to all men that their\r\nsuccess depended less upon the lives of leaders, of whom they might be\r\nrobbed by the hand of the assassin, than upon a conviction of the\r\nrighteousness of their cause, which no sophistry of their opponents\r\ncould dissipate. The Huguenots, at the death of Charles the Ninth,\r\nstood before the world a well-defined body, that had outgrown the\r\nfeebleness of infancy, and had proved itself entitled to consideration\r\nand respect. Thus much was certain.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent fortunes of the Huguenots of France--their wars until\r\nthey obtained recognition and some measure of justice in the Edict of\r\nNantes; the gradual infringement upon their guaranteed rights,\r\nculminating in the revocation of the edict, and the loss to the kingdom\r\nof the most industrious part of the population; their sufferings \"under\r\nthe cross\" until the publication of the Edict of Toleration--these offer\r\nan inviting field of investigation, upon which I may at some future time\r\nbe tempted to enter.[1]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Huguenots during a great part of the period covered\r\nby this work, is, in fact, the history of France as well. The outlines\r\nof the action and some of the characters that come upon the stage are,\r\nconsequently, familiar to the reader of general history. The period has\r\nbeen treated cursorily in writings extending over wider limits, while\r\nseveral of the most striking incidents, including, especially, the\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, have been made the subject of special\r\ndisquisitions. Yet, although much study and ingenuity have been expended\r\nin elucidating the more difficult and obscure points, there is,\r\nespecially in the English language, a lack of works upon the general\r\ntheme, combining painstaking investigation into the older (but not,\r\nnecessarily, better known) sources of information, and an acquaintance\r\nwith the results of modern research.\r\n\r\nThe last twenty-five or thirty years have been remarkably fruitful in\r\ndiscoveries and publications shedding light upon the history of France\r\nduring the age of the Reformation and the years immediately following.\r\nThe archives of all the principal, and many of the secondary, capitals\r\nof Europe have been explored. Valuable manuscripts previously known to\r\nfew scholars--if, indeed, known to any--have been rescued from obscurity\r\nand threatened destruction. By the side of the voluminous histories and\r\nchronicles long since printed, a rich store of contemporary\r\ncorrespondence and hitherto inedited memoirs has been accumulated,\r\nsupplying at once the most copious and the most trustworthy fund of\r\nlife-like views of the past. The magnificent \"Collection de Documents\r\nInédits sur l'Histoire de France,\" still in course of publication by the\r\nMinistry of Public Instruction, comprehends in its grand design not only\r\nextended memoirs, like those of Claude Haton of Provins, but the even\r\nmore important portfolios of leading statesmen, such as those of\r\nSecretary De l'Aubespine and Cardinal Granvelle (not less indispensable\r\nfor French than for Dutch affairs), and the correspondence of monarchs,\r\nas of Henry the Fourth. The secrets of diplomacy have been revealed.\r\nThose singularly accurate and sensible reports made to the Doge and\r\nSenate of Venice, by the ambassadors of the republic, upon their return\r\nfrom the French court, can be read in the collections of Venetian\r\nRelations of Tommaseo and Albèri, or as summarized by Ranke and Baschet.\r\nThe official statements drawn up for the eyes of the public may now be\r\nconfronted with and tested by the more truthful and unguarded accounts\r\nconveyed in cipher to all the foreign courts of Europe. Including the\r\npartial collections of despatches heretofore put in print, we possess,\r\nregarding many critical events, the narratives and opinions of such apt\r\nobservers as the envoys of Spain, of the German Empire, of Venice, and\r\nof the Pope, of Wurtemberg, Saxony, and the Palatinate. Above all, we\r\nhave access to the continuous series of letters of the English\r\nambassadors and minor agents, comprising Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Nicholas\r\nThrokmorton, Walsingham, Jones, Killigrew, and others, scarcely less\r\nskilful in the use of the pen than in the art of diplomacy. This English\r\ncorrespondence, parts of which were printed long ago by Digges, Dr.\r\nPatrick Forbes, and Haynes, and other portions by Hardwick, Wright,\r\nTytler-Fraser, etc., can now be read in London, chiefly in the Record\r\nOffice, and is admirably analyzed in the invaluable \"Calendars of State\r\nPapers (Foreign Series),\" published under the direction of the Master of\r\nthe Rolls. Too much weight can scarcely be given to this source of\r\ninformation and illustration. One of the learned editors\r\nenthusiastically remarks concerning a part of it (the letters of\r\nThrokmorton[2]): \"The historical literature of France, rich as it\r\nconfessedly is in memoirs and despatches of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, possesses (as far as I am aware) no series of\r\npapers which can compare either in continuity, fidelity, or minuteness,\r\nwith the correspondence of Throkmorton.... He had his agents and his\r\nspies everywhere throughout France.\"\r\n\r\nLittle, if at all, inferior in importance to governmental publications,\r\nare the fruits of private research. Several voluminous collections of\r\noriginal documents deserve special mention. Not to speak of the\r\npublications of the national French Historical Society, the \"Société de\r\nl'Histoire du Protestantisme Français\" has given to the world, in its\r\nmonthly Bulletin, so many hitherto inedited documents, besides a great\r\nnumber of excellent monographs, that the volumes of this periodical, now\r\nin its twenty-eighth year, constitute in themselves an indispensable\r\nlibrary of reference. That admirable biographical work, \"La France\r\nProtestante,\" by the brothers Haag (at present in course of revision and\r\nenlargement); the \"Correspondance des Réformateurs dans les Pays de\r\nLangue Française,\" by M. Herminjard (of which five volumes have come\r\nout), a signal instance of what a single indefatigable student can\r\naccomplish; the collections of Calvin's Letters, by M. Jules Bonnet; and\r\nthe magnificent edition of the same reformer's works, by Professors\r\nBaum, Cunitz, and Reuss, a treasury of learning, rich in surprises for\r\nthe historical student--all these merit more particular description than\r\ncan here be given. The biography of Beza, by Professor Baum, the history\r\nof the Princes of Condé, by the Due d'Aumale, the correspondence of\r\nFrederick the Pious, edited by Kluckholn, etc., contribute a great deal\r\nof previously unpublished material. The sumptuous work of M. Douen on\r\nClément Marot and the Huguenot Psalter sheds new light upon an\r\ninteresting, but until now obscure subject. The writings of Farel and\r\nhis associates have been rescued from the oblivion to which the extreme\r\nscarcity of the extant copies consigned them; and the \"Vray Usage de la\r\nCroix,\" the \"Sommaire,\" and the \"Manière et Fasson,\" can at last be read\r\nin elegant editions, faithful counterparts of the originals in every\r\npoint save typographical appearance. The same may be said of such\r\ncelebrated but hitherto unattainable rarities as the \"Tigre\" of 1560,\r\nscrupulously reproduced in fac-simile, by M. Charles Read, of Paris,\r\nfrom the copy belonging to the Hôtel-de-Ville, and the fugitive songs\r\nand hymns which M. Bordier has gathered in his \"Chansonnier Huguenot.\"\r\n\r\nNo little value belongs, also, to certain contemporary journals of\r\noccurrences given to the world under the titles of \"Journal d'un\r\nBourgeois de Paris sous le règne de François Ier,\" \"Cronique du Roy\r\nFrançoys, premier de ce nom,\" \"Journal d'un curé ligueur de Paris sous\r\nles trois derniers Valois (Jehan de la Fosse),\" \"Journal de Jean\r\nGlaumeau de Bourges,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe revival of interest in the fortunes of their ancestors has led a\r\nconsiderable number of French Protestants to prepare works bearing upon\r\nthe history of Protestantism in particular cities and provinces. Among\r\nthese may be noted the works of MM. Douen and Rossier, on Picardy;\r\nRecordon, on Champagne; Lièvre, on Poitou; Bujeaud, on Angoumois;\r\nVaurigaud, on Brittany; Arnaud, on Dauphiny; Coquerel, on Paris; Borrel,\r\non Nismes; Callot and Delmas, on La Rochelle; Crottet, on Pons, Gémozac,\r\nand Mortagne; Corbière, on Montpellier, etc. Although these books differ\r\ngreatly in intrinsic importance, and in regard to the exercise of\r\nhistorical criticism, they all have a valid claim to attention by reason\r\nof the evidence they afford of individual research.\r\n\r\nOf the new light thrown upon the rise of the Huguenots by these and\r\nsimilar works, it has been my aim to make full use. At the same time I\r\nhave been convinced that no adequate knowledge of the period can be\r\nobtained, save by mastering the great array of original chronicles,\r\nhistories, and kindred productions with which the literary world has\r\nlong been acquainted, at least by name. This result I have, accordingly,\r\nendeavored to reach by careful and patient reading. It is unnecessary to\r\nspecify in detail the numerous authors through whose writings it became\r\nmy laborious but by no means ungrateful task to make my way, for the\r\nmarginal notes will indicate the exact line of the study pursued. It may\r\nbe sufficient to say, omitting many other names scarcely less important,\r\nthat I have assiduously studied the works of De Thou, Agrippa d'Aubigné,\r\nLa Place, La Planche; the important \"Histoire Ecclésiastique,\" ascribed\r\nto Theodore de Bèze; the \"Actiones et Monimenta\" of Crespin; the memoirs\r\nof Castelnau, Vieilleville, Du Bellay, Tavannes, La Noue, Montluc,\r\nLestoile, and other authors of this period, included in the large\r\ncollections of memoirs of Petitot, Michaud and Poujoulat, etc.; the\r\nwritings of Brantôme; the Commentaries of Jean de Serres, in their\r\nvarious editions, as well as other writings attributed to the same\r\nauthor; the rich \"Mémoires de Condé,\" both in their original and their\r\nenlarged form; the series of important documents comprehended in the\r\n\"Archives curieuses\" of Cimber and Danjou; the disquisitions collected\r\nby M. Leber; the histories of Davila, Florimond de Ræmond, Maimbourg,\r\nVarillas, Soulier, Mézeray, Gaillard; the more recent historical works\r\nof Sismondi, Martin, Michelet, Floquet; the volumes of Browning,\r\nSmedley, and White, in English, of De Félice, Drion, and Puaux, in\r\nFrench, of Barthold, Von Raumer, Ranke, Polenz, Ebeling, and Soldan, in\r\nGerman. The principal work of Professor Soldan, in particular, bounded\r\nby the same limits of time with those of the present history, merits, in\r\nvirtue of accuracy and thoroughness, a wider recognition than it seems\r\nyet to have attained. My own independent investigations having conducted\r\nme over much of the ground traversed by Professor Soldan, I have enjoyed\r\nample opportunity for testing the completeness of his study and the\r\njudicial fairness of his conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe posthumous treatise of Professor H. Wuttke, \"Zur Vorgeschichte der\r\nBartholomäusnacht,\" published in Leipsic since the present work was\r\nplaced in the printer's hands, reached me too late to be noticed in\r\nconnection with the narrative of the events which it discusses.\r\nNotwithstanding Professor Wuttke's recognized ability and assiduity as a\r\nhistorical investigator, I am unable to adopt the position at which he\r\narrives.\r\n\r\nI desire here to acknowledge my obligation for valuable assistance in\r\nprosecuting my researches to my lamented friend and correspondent,\r\nProfessor Jean Guillaume Baum, long and honorably connected with the\r\nAcadémie de Strasbourg, than whom France could boast no more\r\nindefatigable or successful student of her annals, and who consecrated\r\nhis leisure hours during forty years to the enthusiastic study of the\r\nhistory of the French and Swiss Reformation. If that history is better\r\nunderstood now than when, in 1838, he submitted as a theological thesis\r\nhis astonishingly complete \"Origines Evangelii in Gallia restaurati,\"\r\nthe progress is due in great measure to his patient labors. To M. Jules\r\nBonnet, under whose skilful editorship the Bulletin of the French\r\nProtestant Historical Society has reached its present excellence, I am\r\nindebted for help afforded me in solving, by means of researches among\r\nthe MSS. of the Bibliothèque Rationale at Paris, and the Simler\r\nCollection at Zurich, several difficult problems. To these names I may\r\nadd those of M. Henri Bordier, Bibliothécaire Honoraire in the\r\nDepartment of MSS. (Bibliothèque Rationale), of M. Raoul de Cazenove, of\r\nLyons, author of many highly prized monographs on Huguenot topics, and\r\nof the Rev. John Forsyth, D.D., who have in various ways rendered me\r\nvaluable services.\r\n\r\nFinally, I deem it both a duty and a privilege to express my warm thanks\r\nto the librarians of the Princeton Theological Seminary and of the Union\r\nTheological Seminary in this city; and particularly to the successive\r\nsuperintendents and librarians of the Astor Library--both the living and\r\nthe dead--by the signal courtesy of whom, the whole of that admirable\r\ncollection of books has been for many years placed at my disposal for\r\npurposes of consultation so freely, that nothing has been wanting to\r\nmake the work of study in its alcoves as pleasant and effective as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK,\r\nSeptember 15, 1879.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Meantime I am glad that we may expect before very long,\r\nfrom the pen of my brother, Charles W.

CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of France at the accession of Francis the First.]\r\n\r\nWhen, on the first day of the year 1515, the young Count of Angoulême\r\nsucceeded to the throne left vacant by the death of his kinsman and\r\nfather-in-law, Louis the Twelfth, the country of which he became monarch\r\nwas already an extensive, flourishing, and well-consolidated kingdom.\r\nThe territorial development of France was, it is true, far from\r\ncomplete. On the north, the whole province of Hainault belonged to the\r\nSpanish Netherlands, whose boundary line was less than one hundred miles\r\ndistant from Paris. Alsace and Lorraine had not yet been wrested from\r\nthe German Empire. The \"Duchy\" of Burgundy, seized by Louis the Eleventh\r\nimmediately after the death of Charles the Bold, had, indeed, been\r\nincorporated into the French realm; but the \"Free County\" of\r\nBurgundy--_la Franche Comté_, as it was briefly designated--had been\r\nimprudently suffered to fall into other hands, and Besançon was the\r\nresidence of a governor appointed by princes of the House of Hapsburg.\r\nLyons was a frontier town; for the little districts of Bresse and Bugey,\r\nlying between the Saône and Rhône, belonged to the Dukes of Savoy.\r\nFurther to the south, two fragments of foreign territory were completely\r\nenveloped by the domain of the French king. The first was the sovereign\r\nprincipality of Orange, which, after having been for over a century in\r\nthe possession of the noble House of Châlons, was shortly to pass into\r\nthat of Nassau, and to furnish the title of William the Silent, the\r\nfuture deliverer of Holland. The other and larger one was the Comtât\r\nVenaissin, a fief directly dependent upon the Pope. Of irregular shape,\r\nand touching the Rhone both above and below Orange, the Comtât Venaissin\r\nnearly enclosed the diminutive principality in its folds. Its capital,\r\nAvignon, having forfeited the distinction enjoyed in the fourteenth\r\ncentury as the residence of the Roman Pontiffs, still boasted the\r\npresence of a Legate of the Papal See, a poor compensation for the loss\r\nof its past splendor. On the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the\r\nSpanish dominions still extended north of the principal chain of the\r\nPyrenees, and included the former County of Roussillon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Territorial development.]\r\n\r\nBut, although its area was somewhat smaller than that of the modern\r\nrepublic, France in the sixteenth century had nearly attained the\r\ngeneral dimensions marked out for it by great natural boundaries. Four\r\nhundred years had been engrossed in the pursuit of territorial\r\nenlargement. At the close of the tenth century the Carlovingian dynasty,\r\nessentially foreign in tastes and language, was supplanted by a dynasty\r\nof native character and capable of gathering to its support all those\r\nelements of strength which had been misunderstood or neglected by the\r\nfeeble descendants of Charlemagne. But it found the royal authority\r\nreduced to insignificance and treated with open contempt. By permitting\r\nthose dignities which had once been conferred as a reward for\r\npre-eminent personal merit to become hereditary in certain families, the\r\ncrown had laid the foundation of the feudal system; while, by neglecting\r\nto enforce its sovereign claims, it had enabled the great feudatories to\r\nmake themselves princes independent in reality, if not in name. So low\r\nhad the consideration of the throne fallen, that when Hugh Capet, Count\r\nof Paris, in 987 assumed the title of king of France, basing his act\r\npartly on an election by nobles, partly on force of arms, the\r\ntransaction elicited little opposition from the rival lords who might\r\nhave been expected to resent his usurpation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excessive subdivision in the tenth century.]\r\n\r\nFrance contained at this time six principal fiefs--four in the north and\r\ntwo in the south--each nearly or fully as powerful as the hereditary\r\ndominions of Hugh, while probably more than one excelled them in extent.\r\nThese limited dominions, on the resources of which the new dynasty was\r\nwholly dependent in the struggle for supremacy, embraced the important\r\ncities of Paris and Orleans, but barely stretched from the Somme to the\r\nLoire, and were excluded from the ocean by the broad possessions of the\r\ndukes of Normandy on both sides of the lower Seine. The great fiefs had\r\neach in turn yielded to the same irresistible tendency to subdivision.\r\nThe great feudatory was himself the superior of the tenants of several\r\nsubordinate, yet considerable, fiefs. The possessors of these again\r\nranked above the viscounts of cities and the provincial barons. A long\r\nseries of gradations in dignity ended at the simple owners of castles,\r\nwith their subject peasants or serfs. In no country of Europe had the\r\nfeudal system borne a more abundant harvest of disintegration and\r\nconsequent loss of power.[3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of the feudal system.]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the insubordinate nobles on the patrimonial estates of\r\nthe crown was the first problem engaging the attention of the early\r\nCapetian kings. When this had at length been solved, with the assistance\r\nof the scanty forces lent by the cities--never amounting, it is said, to\r\nmore than five hundred men-at-arms[4]--Louis the Fat, a prince of\r\nresplendent ability, early in the twelfth century addressed himself to\r\nthe task of making good the royal title to supremacy over the\r\nneighboring provinces. Before death compelled him to forego the\r\nprosecution of his ambitious designs, the influence of the monarchy had\r\nbeen extended over eastern and central France--from Flanders, on the\r\nnorth, to the volcanic mountains of Auvergne, on the south. Meanwhile\r\nthe oppressed subjects of the petty tyrants, whether within or around\r\nhis domains, had learned to look for redress to the sovereign lord who\r\nprided himself upon his ability and readiness to succor the defenceless.\r\nHis grandson, the more illustrious Philip Augustus (1180-1223), by\r\nmarriage, inheritance, and conquest added to previous acquisitions\r\nseveral extensive provinces, of which Normandy, Maine, and Poitou had\r\nbeen subject to English rule, while Vermandois and Yalois had enjoyed a\r\nform of approximate independence under collateral branches of the\r\nCapetian family.\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Louis the Fat and of Philip Augustus were consolidated\r\nby Louis the Ninth--Saint Louis, as succeeding generations were wont to\r\nstyle him--an upright monarch, who scrupled to accept new territory\r\nwithout remunerating the former owners, and even alienated the affection\r\nof provinces which he might with apparent justice have retained, by\r\nceding them to the English, in the vain hope of cementing a lasting\r\npeace between the rival states.[5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France the foremost kingdom of Christendom.]\r\n\r\nThe same pursuit of territorial aggrandizement under successive kings\r\nextended the domain of the crown, in spite of disaster and temporary\r\nlosses, until in the sixteenth century France was second to no other\r\ncountry in Europe for power and material resources. United under a\r\nsingle head, and no longer disturbed by the insubordination of the\r\nturbulent nobles, lately humbled by the craft of Louis the Eleventh,\r\nthis kingdom awakened the warm admiration of political judges so shrewd\r\nas the diplomatic envoys of the Venetian Republic. \"All these\r\nprovinces,\" exclaimed one of these agents, in a report made to the Doge\r\nand Senate soon after his return, \"are so well situated, so liberally\r\nprovided with river-courses, harbors, and mountain ranges, that it may\r\nwith safety be asserted that this realm is not only the most noble in\r\nChristendom, rivalling in antiquity our own most illustrious\r\ncommonwealth, but excels all other states in natural advantages and\r\nsecurity.\"[6] Another of the same distinguished school of statesmen,\r\ntaking a more deliberate survey of the country, gives utterance to the\r\nuniversal estimate of his age, when averring that France is to be\r\nregarded as the foremost kingdom of Christendom, whether viewed in\r\nrespect to its dignity and power, or the rank of the prince who governs\r\nit.[7] In proof of the first of these claims he alleges the fact that,\r\nwhereas England had once been, and Naples was at that moment dependent\r\nupon the Church, and Bohemia and Poland sustained similar relations to\r\nthe Empire, France had always been a sovereign state. \"It is also the\r\noldest of European kingdoms, and the first that was converted to\r\nChristianity,\" remarks the same writer; adding, with a touch of\r\npatriotic pride, the proviso, \"if we except the Pope, who is the\r\nuniversal head of religion, and the State of Venice, which, as it first\r\nsprang into existence a Christian commonwealth, has always continued\r\nsuch.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France contrasted with England.]\r\n\r\nOther diplomatists took the same view of the power and resources of this\r\nfavored country. \"The kingdom of France,\" said Chancellor Bacon, in a\r\nspeech against the policy of rendering open aid to Scotland, and thus\r\nbecoming involved in a war with the French, \"is four times as large as\r\nthe realm of England, the men four times as many, and the revenue four\r\ntimes as much, and it has better credit. France is full of expert\r\ncaptains and old soldiers, and besides its own troops it may entertain\r\nas many Almains as it is able to hire.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assimilation of language and manners.]\r\n\r\nMeantime France was fast becoming more homogeneous than it had ever been\r\nsince the fall of the Roman power. As often as the lines of the great\r\nfeudal families became extinct, or these families were induced or\r\ncompelled to renounce their pretensions, their fiefs were given in\r\nappanage to younger branches of the royal house, or were more closely\r\nunited to the domains of the crown, and entrusted to governors of the\r\nking's appointment.[10] In either case the actual control of affairs was\r\nplaced in the hands of officers whose highest ambition was to reproduce\r\nin the provincial capital the growing elegance of the great city on the\r\nSeine where the royal court had fixed its ordinary abode. The provinces,\r\nconsequently, began to assimilate more and more to Paris, and this not\r\nmerely in manners, but in forms of speech and even in pronunciation. The\r\nrude _patois_, since it grated upon the cultivated ear, was banished\r\nfrom polite society, and, if not consigned to oblivion, was relegated to\r\nthe more ignorant and remoter districts. Learning held its seat in\r\nParis, and the scholars who returned to their homes after a sojourn in\r\nits academic halls were careful to avoid creating doubts respecting the\r\nthoroughness of their training by the use of any dialect but that spoken\r\nin the neighborhood of the university. As the idiom of Paris asserted\r\nits supremacy over the rest of France, a new tie was constituted,\r\nbinding together provinces diverse in origin and history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nobles flock to Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of obedience pervading all classes of the population\r\ncontributed much to the national strength. The great nobles had lost\r\ntheir excessive privileges. They no longer attempted, in the seclusion\r\nof their ancestral estates, to rival the magnificence or defy the\r\nauthority of the king. They began to prefer the capital to the freer\r\nretreat of their castles. During the reign of Francis the First, and\r\nstill more during the reign of his immediate successors, costly palaces\r\nfor the accommodation of princely and ducal families were reared in the\r\nneighborhood of the Louvre.[11] It was currently reported that more than\r\none fortune had been squandered in the hazardous experiment of\r\nmaintaining a pomp befitting the courtier. Ultimately the poorer\r\ngrandees were driven to the adoption of the wise precaution of spending\r\nonly a quarter of the year in the enticing but dangerous vicinity of the\r\nthrone.[12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cities.]\r\n\r\nThe cities, also, whose extensive privileges had constituted one of the\r\nmost striking features of the political system of mediæval Europe, had\r\nbeen shorn of their exorbitant claims founded upon royal charters or\r\nprescriptive usage. The kings of France, in particular, had favored the\r\ngrowth of the municipalities, in order to secure their assistance in the\r\nreduction of refractory vassals. Flourishing trading communities had\r\nsprung up on the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and of the ocean, and\r\non the banks of the navigable rivers emptying into them. These\r\ncorporations had secured a degree of independence proportioned, for the\r\nmost part, to the weakness of their neighbors. The policy of the crown\r\nhad been, while generously conferring privileges of great importance\r\nupon the cities lying within the royal domain, to make still more lavish\r\nconcessions in favor of the municipalities upon or contiguous to the\r\nlands of the great feudatories.[13]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The capital.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner, however, did the humiliation of the landed nobility render it\r\nsuperfluous to conciliate the good-will of the proud and opulent\r\ncitizens, than the readiest means were sought for reducing them to the\r\nlevel of ordinary subjects. Paris especially, once almost a republic,\r\nhad of late learned submission and docility.[14] By the change, however,\r\nthe capital had lost neither wealth nor inhabitants, being described as\r\nvery rich and populous, covering a vast area, and wholly given up to\r\ntrade.[15] In the absence of an accurate census, the number of its\r\ninhabitants was variously stated at from 300,000 souls to nearly thrice\r\nas many; but all accounts agreed in placing Paris among the foremost\r\ncities of the civilized world.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military resources.]\r\n\r\nWith the military resources at his command, the king had the means of\r\nrendering himself formidable abroad and secure at home. The French\r\ncavalry, consisting of gentlemen whose duty and honorable distinction it\r\nwas to follow the monarch in every expedition, still sustained the\r\nreputation for the impetuous ardor and the irresistible weight of its\r\ncharges which it had won during the Middle Ages. If it had encountered\r\nunexpected rebuffs on the fields of Crécy, Poitiers and Agincourt, the\r\nchivalry of France had been too successful in other engagements to lose\r\ncourage and enthusiasm. The nobles, both old and young, were still ready\r\nat any time to flock to their prince's standard when unfurled for an\r\nincursion into Naples or the Milanese. Never had they displayed more\r\nalacrity or self-sacrificing devotion than when young Francis the First\r\nset out upon his campaigns in Italy.[17] The French infantry was less\r\ntrustworthy. The troops raised in Normandy, Brittany, and Languedoc were\r\nreported to be but poorly trained to military exercises; but the\r\nfoot-soldiers supplied by some of the frontier provinces were sturdy and\r\nefficient, and the gallant conduct of the Gascons at the disastrous\r\nbattle of St. Quentin was the subject of universal admiration.[18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign mercenary troops.]\r\n\r\nWhat France lacked in cavalry was customarily supplied by the Reiters,\r\nwhose services were easily purchased in Germany. The same country stood\r\nready to furnish an abundance of Lansquenets (Lanzknechten), or pikemen,\r\nwho, together with the Swiss, in a great measure replaced the native\r\ninfantry. A Venetian envoy reported, in 1535, that the French king\r\ncould, in six weeks at longest, set on foot a force of forty-eight\r\nthousand men, of whom twenty-one thousand, or nearly one-half, would be\r\nforeign mercenaries. His navy, besides his great ship of sixty guns\r\nlying in the harbor of Havre, numbered thirty galleys, and a few other\r\nvessels of no great importance.[19]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rights of the people overlooked.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The States General an object of suspicion.]\r\n\r\nThe power gained by the crown through the consolidation of the monarchy\r\nhad been acquired at the expense of the popular liberties. In the\r\nprolonged struggle between the king, as lord paramount, and his\r\ninsubordinate vassals, the rights of inferior subjects had received\r\nlittle consideration. From the strife the former issued triumphant, with\r\nan asserted claim to unlimited power. The voice of the masses was but\r\nfeebly heard in the States General--a convocation of all three orders\r\ncalled at irregular intervals. Upon the ordinary policy of government,\r\nthis, the only representative body, exercised no permanent control. If,\r\nin its occasional sessions, the deputies of the _Tiers État_ exhibited a\r\ndisposition to intermeddle in those political concerns which the crown\r\nclaimed as its exclusive prerogative, the king and his advisers found in\r\ntheir audacity an additional motive for postponing as long as possible a\r\nresort to an expedient so disagreeable as the assembling of the States\r\nGeneral. Already had monarchs begun to look with suspicion upon the\r\ngrowing intelligence of untitled subjects, who might sooner or later\r\ncome to demand a share in the public administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And rarely convoked.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A long break in the history of representative government.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compensating advantages.]\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, only when the succession to the throne was contested,\r\nor when the perils attending the minority of the prince demanded the\r\npopular sanction of the choice of a regent, or when the flames of civil\r\nwar seemed about to burst forth and involve the whole country in one\r\ngeneral conflagration, that the royal consent could be obtained for\r\nconvening the States General. During the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury the States General were not once summoned, unless the\r\ndesignation of States be accorded to one or two convocations partaking\r\nrather of the character of \"Assemblies of Notables,\" and intended merely\r\nto assist in extricating the monarch from temporary embarrassment.[20]\r\nThe repeated wars of Louis the Twelfth, of Francis the First, and of\r\nHenry the Second were waged without any reference of the questions of\r\ntheir expediency and of the mode of conducting them to the tribunal of\r\npopular opinion. Thousands of brave Frenchmen found bloody graves beyond\r\nthe Alps; Francis the First fell into the hands of his enemies, and\r\nafter a weary captivity with difficulty regained his freedom; a new\r\nfaith arose in France, threatening to subvert existing ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions; yet in the midst of all this bloodshed, confusion and\r\nperplexity the people were left unconsulted.[21] From the accession of\r\nCharles the Eighth, in 1483, to that of Charles the Ninth, in 1560, the\r\nhistory of representative government in France is almost a complete\r\nblank. So long was the period during which the States General were\r\nsuspended, that, when at length it was deemed advisable to convene them\r\nagain, the chancellor, in his opening address, felt compelled to enter\r\ninto explanations respecting the nature and functions of a body which\r\nperhaps not a man living remembered to have seen in session.[22] Yet,\r\nwhile the desuetude into which had fallen the laudable custom of holding\r\nthe States every year, or, at least, on occasion of any important matter\r\nfor deliberation, might properly be traced to the flood of ambition and\r\npride which had inundated the world, and to the inordinate covetousness\r\nof kings,[23] there were not wanting considerations to mitigate the\r\ndisappointment of the people. Chief among them, doubtless, in the view\r\nof shrewd observers, was the fact that the assembling of the States was\r\nthe invariable prelude to an increase of taxation, and that never had\r\nthey met without benefiting the king's exchequer at the expense of the\r\npurses of his subjects.[24]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The endurance of the Tiers État.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absolutism of the crown.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the nation bore with exemplary patience the accumulated\r\nburdens under which it staggered. Natives and foreigners alike were lost\r\nin admiration of its wonderful powers of endurance. No one suspected\r\nthat a terrible retribution for this same people's wrongs might one day\r\novertake the successor of a long line of kings, each of whom had added\r\nhis portion to the crushing load. The Emperor Maximilian was accustomed\r\nto divert himself at the expense of the French people. \"The king of\r\nFrance,\" said he, \"_is a king of asses_; there is no weight that can be\r\nlaid upon his subjects which they will not bear without a murmur.\"[25]\r\nThe warrior and historian Rabutin congratulated the monarchs of France\r\nupon God's having given them, in obedience, the best and most faithful\r\npeople in the whole world.[26] The Venetian, Matteo Dandolo, declared to\r\nthe Doge and Senate that the king might with propriety regard as his own\r\nall the money in France, for, such was _the incomparable kindness of the\r\npeople_, that whatever he might ask for in his need was very gladly\r\nbrought to him.[27] It was not strange, perhaps, that the ruler of\r\nsubjects so exemplary in their eagerness to replenish his treasury as\r\nsoon as it gave evidence of being exhausted, came to take about the same\r\nview of the matter. Accordingly, it is related of Francis the First\r\nthat, being asked by his guest, Charles the Fifth, when the latter was\r\ncrossing France on his way to suppress the insurrection of Ghent, what\r\nrevenue he derived from certain cities he had passed through, the king\r\npromptly, replied: \"_Ce que je veux_\"--\"_What I please._\"[28]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fruits of the abasement of the people.]\r\n\r\nYet it must be noted, in passing, that the studied abasement of the\r\n_Tiers État_ had already begun to bear some fruit that should have\r\nalarmed every patriotic heart. It was, as we have seen, impossible to\r\nobtain good French infantry except from Gascony and some other border\r\nprovinces. The place that should have been held by natives was filled by\r\nGermans and Swiss. What was the reason? Simply that the common people\r\nhad lost the consciousness of their manhood, in consequence of the\r\ndegraded position into which the king, and the privileged classes,\r\nimitating his example, had forced them. \"Because of their desire to rule\r\nthe people with a rod of iron,\" says Dandolo, \"the gentry of the kingdom\r\nhave deprived them of arms. They dare not even carry a stick, and _are\r\nmore submissive to their superiors than dogs_!\"[29] No wonder that all\r\nefforts of Francis to imitate the armies of free states, by instituting\r\nlegions of arquebusiers, proved fruitless.[30] Add to this that trade\r\nwas held in supreme contempt,[31] and the picture is certainly\r\nsufficiently dark.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Checks upon the king's authority.]\r\n\r\nYet, while, through the absence of any effectual barrier to the exercise\r\nof his good pleasure, the king's authority was ultimately unrestricted,\r\nit must be confessed that there existed, in point of fact, some powerful\r\nchecks, rendering the abuse of the royal prerogative, for the most part,\r\nneither easy nor expedient. Parliament, the municipal corporations, the\r\nuniversity, and the clergy, weak as they often proved in a direct\r\nstruggle with the crown, nevertheless exerted an influence that ought\r\nnot to be overlooked. The most headstrong prince hesitated to disregard\r\nthe remonstrances of any one of these bodies, and their united protest\r\nsometimes led to the abandonment of schemes of great promise for the\r\nroyal treasury. It is true that parliament, university, and chartered\r\nborough owed their existence and privileges to the royal will, and that\r\nthe power that created could also destroy. But time had invested with a\r\nspecies of sanctity the venerable institutions established by monarchs\r\nlong since dead, and the utmost stretch of royal displeasure went not in\r\nits manifestation further than the mere threat to strip parliament or\r\nuniversity of its privileges, or, at most, the arrest and temporary\r\nimprisonment of the more obnoxious judges or scholars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parliament of Paris]\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Paris was the legitimate successor of that assembly in\r\nwhich, in the earlier stage of the national existence, the great vassals\r\ncame together to render homage to the lord paramount and aid him by\r\ntheir deliberations. This _feudal_ parliament was transformed into a\r\n_judicial_ parliament toward the end of the thirteenth century. With the\r\nchange of functions, the chief crown officers were admitted to seats in\r\nthe court. Next, the introduction of a written procedure, and the\r\nestablishment of a more complicated legislation, compelled the\r\nilliterate barons and the prelates to call in the assistance of\r\ngraduates of the university, acquainted with the art of writing and\r\nskilled in law. These were appointed by the king to the office of\r\ncounsellors.[32] In 1302, parliament, hitherto migratory, following the\r\nking in his journeys, was made stationary at Paris. Its sessions were\r\nfixed at two in each year, held at Easter and All Saints respectively.\r\nThe judicial body was subdivided into several \"chambers,\" according to\r\nthe nature of the cases upon which it was called to act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Becomes the supreme court.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time the Parliament of Paris assumed appellate jurisdiction\r\nover all France, and became the supreme court of justice. But the burden\r\nof prolonged sessions, and the necessity now imposed upon the members of\r\nresiding at least four months out of every year in the capital, proved\r\nan irksome restraint both to prelates and to noblemen. Their attendance,\r\ntherefore, began now to be less constant. As early as in 1320 the\r\nbishops and other ecclesiastical officers were excused, on the ground\r\nthat their duty to their dioceses and sacred functions demanded their\r\npresence elsewhere. From the general exemption the Bishop of Paris and\r\nthe Abbot of St. Denis alone were excluded, on account of their\r\nproximity to the seat of the court. About the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the members, taking advantage of the weak reign of Charles the\r\nSixth, made good their claim to a life-tenure in their offices.[33]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provincial parliaments.]\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of cases claiming the attention of the Parliament of\r\nParis suggested the erection of similar tribunals in the chief cities of\r\nthe provinces added to the original estates of the crown. Before the\r\naccession of Francis the First a provincial parliament had been\r\ninstituted at Toulouse, with jurisdiction over the extensive domain once\r\nsubject to the illustrious counts of that city; a second, at Grenoble,\r\nfor Dauphiny; a third, at Bordeaux, for the province of Guyenne\r\nrecovered from the English; a fourth, at Dijon, for the newly acquired\r\nDuchy of Burgundy; a fifth, at Rouen, to take the place of the inferior\r\n\"exchequer\" which had long had its seat there; and a sixth, at\r\nAix-en-Provence, for the southeast of France.[34]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claim to the right of remonstrance.]\r\n\r\nTo their judicial functions, the Parliament of Paris, and to a minor\r\ndegree the provincial parliaments, had insensibly added other functions\r\npurely political. In order to secure publicity for their edicts, and\r\nequally with the view of establishing the authenticity of documents\r\npurporting to emanate from the crown, the kings of France had early\r\ndesired the insertion of all important decrees in the parliamentary\r\nrecords. The registry was made on each occasion by express order of the\r\njudges, but with no idea on their part that this form was essential to\r\nthe validity of a royal ordinance. Presently, however, the novel theory\r\nwas advanced that parliament had the right of refusing to record an\r\nobnoxious law, and that, without the formal recognition of parliament,\r\nno edict could be allowed to affect the decisions of the supreme or of\r\nany inferior tribunal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indulgence of the crown.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chancellor's oath.]\r\n\r\nIn the exercise or this assumed prerogative, the judges undertook to\r\nsend a remonstrance to the king, setting forth the pernicious\r\nconsequences that might be expected to flow from the proposed measure if\r\nput into execution. However unfounded in history, the claim of the\r\nParliament of Paris appears to have been viewed with indulgence by\r\nmonarchs most of whom were not indisposed to defer to the legal\r\nknowledge of the counsellors, nor unwilling to enhance the consideration\r\nof the venerable and ancient body to which the latter belonged. In all\r\ncases, however, the final responsibility devolved upon the sovereign.\r\nWhenever the arguments and advice of parliament failed to convince him,\r\nthe king proceeded in person to the audience-chamber of the refractory\r\ncourt, and there, holding a _lit-de-justice_, insisted upon the\r\nimmediate registration, or else sent his express command by one of his\r\nmost trusty servants. The judges, in either case, were forced to\r\nsuccumb--often, it must be admitted, with a very bad grace--and admit\r\nthe law to their records. We shall soon have occasion to note one of the\r\nmost striking instances of this unequal contest between king and\r\nparliament, in which power rather than right or learning won the day. In\r\nspite, however, of occasional checks, parliament manfully and\r\nsuccessfully maintained its right to throw obstacles in the way of hasty\r\nor inconsiderate legislation. In this it was often efficiently assisted\r\nby the Chancellor of France, the highest judicial officer of the crown,\r\nto whom, on his assuming office, an oath was administered containing a\r\nvery explicit promise to exercise the right of remonstrance with the\r\nking before affixing the great seal of state to any unjust or\r\nunreasonable royal ordinance.[35]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuses in the administration of justice.]\r\n\r\nNot that either the Parliament of Paris or the provincial parliaments\r\nwere free of grave defects deserving the severe animadversion of\r\nimpartial observers. It was probably no worse with the Parliament of\r\nBordeaux than with its sister courts;[36] yet, when Charles the Ninth\r\nvisited that city in 1564, honest Chancellor L'Hospital seized the\r\nopportunity to tell the judges some of their failings. The royal\r\nordinances were not observed. Parliamentary decisions ranked above\r\ncommands of the king. There were divisions and violence. In the civil\r\nwar some judges had made themselves captains. Many of them were\r\navaricious, timid, lazy and inattentive to their duties. Their behavior\r\nand their dress were \"dissolute.\" They had become negligent in judging,\r\nand had thrown the burden of prosecuting offences upon the shoulders of\r\nthe king's attorney, originally appointed merely to look after the royal\r\ndomain. They had become the servants of the nobility for hire. _There\r\nwas not a lord within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Bordeaux but\r\nhad his own chancellor in the court to look after his interests_.[37] It\r\nwas sufficiently characteristic that the same judicial body of which\r\nsuch things were said to its face (and which neither denied their truth\r\nnor grew indignant), should have been so solicitous for its dignity as\r\nto send the monarch, upon his approach to the city, an earnest petition\r\nthat its members _should not be constrained to kneel_ when his Majesty\r\nentered their court-room! To which the latter dryly responded, \"their\r\ngenuflexion would not make him any less a king than he already\r\nwas.\"[38]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The University of Paris.]\r\n\r\nAmong the forces that tended to limit the arbitrary exercise of the\r\nroyal authority, the influence of the University of Paris is entitled to\r\na prominent place. Nothing had added more lustre to the rising glory of\r\nthe capital than the possession of the magnificent institution of\r\nlearning, the foundation of which was lost in the mist of remote\r\nantiquity. Older than the race of kings who had for centuries held the\r\nFrench sceptre, the university owed its origin, if we are to believe the\r\ntestimony of its own annals, to the munificent hand of Charlemagne, in\r\nthe beginning of the ninth century. Careful historical criticism must\r\nhesitate to accept as conclusive the slender proof offered in support of\r\nthe story.[39] It is, perhaps, safer to regard one of the simple schools\r\ninstituted at an early period in connection with cathedrals and\r\nmonasteries as having contained the humble germ from which the proud\r\nuniversity was slowly developed. But, by the side of this original\r\nfoundation there had doubtless grown up the schools of private\r\ninstructors, and these had acquired a certain prominence before the\r\nconfluence of scholars to Paris from all quarters rendered necessary an\r\nattempt to introduce order into the complicated system, by the formation\r\nof that union of all the teachers and scholars to which the name of\r\n_universitas_ was ultimately given.\r\n\r\nIf the origin of the University of Paris, like that of the greater\r\nnumber of human institutions, was insignificant when viewed in the light\r\nof its subsequent growth, the meagreness of the early course of\r\ninstruction was almost incredible to those who, in an age of richer\r\nmental acquisitions, listened to the prelections of its numerous and\r\nlearned doctors. The _Trivium_ and the _Quadrivium_ constituted the\r\nwhole cycle of human knowledge. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were\r\nembraced in the one; music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy in the\r\nother. He was indeed a prodigy of erudition whose comprehensive\r\nintellect had mastered the details of these, the seven liberal arts, or,\r\nto use a familiar line of the period,\r\n\r\n     Qui tria, qui septem, qui omne scibile novit.\r\n\r\nBut the ignorant pedagogues of the eleventh century gave place, in the\r\nearly part of the twelfth, to instructors of real merit--to Peter\r\nAbelard, among others, and to his pupil Peter Lombard, the fame of whose\r\nlectures attracted to Paris great crowds of youth eager to become\r\nproficient in philosophy and\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The four nations.]\r\n\r\nHitherto there had been but one faculty--the Faculty of Arts; but among\r\nthe students a distribution into four \"nations\" had been effected. The\r\n_Nation of France_ embraced the students coming from the royal\r\ndominions, which then comprised a limited territory, with Paris as its\r\ncapital, together with the students of Italy, Spain, and the east. The\r\n_Nation of Picardy_ consisted of students from the province of that name\r\nand from the neighboring County of Flanders. The _Nation of Normandy_\r\nreceived youths belonging to the rich provinces of Normandy and\r\nBrittany, and to the west. The _Nation of England_ gathered those who\r\ncame from the British Isles, as well as from the extensive territories\r\nin southwestern France long held by the kings of England. After the\r\nreconquest of Guyenne, however, the German students became the\r\ncontrolling element in the fourth nation, and the designation was\r\nchanged to the _Nation of Germany_. The _Rector_ of the university and\r\nthe four _Procurators_ of the nations were entrusted with the\r\nadministration of the general interests of the vast scholastic\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The faculties.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chancellor and rector.]\r\n\r\nWith the rise of new branches of science to contest the supremacy of the\r\nold, the institution of other faculties was called for. The demand was\r\nnot conceded without a determined struggle of so serious a character as\r\nto require the intervention of two popes for its settlement.\r\nNevertheless, before the end of the thirteenth century, the three new\r\nfaculties of theology, medicine, and law had assumed their places by the\r\nside of the four original nations. The faculties were represented in the\r\nrector's council by three _Deans_, invested with power equal to that\r\nenjoyed by the procurators of the nations. While the rector, always\r\nchosen from the faculty of arts, was the real head of this republic of\r\nletters in all that concerned its inner life and management, the\r\nhonorable privilege of conferring the degrees that gave the right to\r\nteach belonged to the chancellor of the university.[40] The former,\r\nelected every three months, began and ended his office with solemn\r\nprocessions, the first to invoke the blessing of heaven upon his labors,\r\nthe second to render thanks for their successful termination. The\r\nchancellor, holding office for life, was an ecclesiastic of the church\r\nof Paris, originally the bishop or some one appointed by him, who, if he\r\nenjoyed less direct control over the scholars in their studies, was yet\r\nthe chief censor of their morals,[41] and the representative of the\r\nuniversity in its dealings with foreign bodies, and especially with the\r\nRoman See.[42]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sorbonne.]\r\n\r\nNo other mediæval seat of learning attained so enviable a reputation as\r\nParis for completeness of theological training. From all parts of\r\nChristendom students resorted to it as to the most abundant and the\r\npurest fountain of sound learning. In 1250, Robert de Sorbonne, the\r\nprivate confessor of Louis the Ninth, emulating the munificence of\r\nprevious patrons of letters, founded a college intended to facilitate\r\nthe education of secular students of theology. The college took the\r\nname of its author, and, becoming famous for the ability of its\r\ninstructors, the Sorbonne soon engrossed within its walls almost the\r\nentire course of theological teaching given in the University of Paris.\r\nAlthough the students in the colleges of Navarre and Plessis devoted\r\nthemselves to the acquisition of the same science, they had little\r\npublic instruction save that for which they resorted to the Sorbonne. By\r\nreason of the prominence thus gained as the seat of the principal\r\ninstruction in theology, the Sorbonne became synonymous with the\r\ntheological faculty itself.[43]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its great authority.]\r\n\r\nA body of theologians of admitted eminence necessarily spoke with\r\nauthority. In France the decisions of the Sorbonne were accepted as\r\nfinal upon almost all questions affecting the doctrine and practice of\r\nthe Church. Abroad its opinions were esteemed of little less weight than\r\nthe deliberate judgments of synods. Difficulties in church and state\r\nwere referred to it for solution. In the age of the reformation the\r\nSorbonne was invited to pronounce upon the truth or falsity of the\r\npropositions maintained by Martin Luther, and, a few years later, upon\r\nthe validity of the grounds of the divorce sought by Henry the Eighth of\r\nEngland. But, unhappily, the reputation of the faculty was tarnished by\r\nscholastic bigotry. Slavish attachment to the past had destroyed freedom\r\nof thought. With a species of inconsistency not altogether without a\r\nparallel in history, the very body which had been active in the\r\npromotion of science during the Middle Ages assumed the posture of\r\nresistance the moment that the advocates of substantial reform urged the\r\nnecessity of immediate action. Abuses which had provoked the indignation\r\nof Gerson, once Chancellor of the University of Paris, and employed the\r\nskilful pen of the bold Rector Nicholas de Clemangis, met with no word\r\nof condemnation from the new generation of theologians.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Sorbonne of the beginning of the sixteenth century, when\r\nintriguing doctors, such as Beda and Quercu, ruled in its deliberations.\r\nAn enemy of liberal studies as well as of the \"new doctrines,\" the\r\nfaculty of theology was as ready to attack Erasmus for his devotion to\r\nancient literature, or Jacques Lefèvre for establishing the existence of\r\nthe \"three Marys,\" as to denounce the Bishop of Meaux for favoring\r\n\"Lutheran\" preachers in his diocese. Against all innovators in church or\r\nstate, the sentiments of the Sorbonne, which it took no pains to\r\nconceal, were that \"their impious and shameless arrogance must be\r\nrestrained by chains, by censures--nay, by fire and flame--rather than\r\nvanquished by argument!\"[44]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Number of students.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the external marks of prosperity the University of Paris\r\nwas still in its prime at the period of which I speak. The colleges,\r\nclustered together in the southern quarter of the city--the present\r\n_Quartier Latin_--were so numerous and populous that this portion\r\ncontinued for many years after to be distinguished as _l'\r\nUniversité_.[45] The number of students, it is true, had visibly\r\ndiminished since one hundred years before. The crowd of youth in\r\nattendance was no longer so great as in 1409, when, according to a\r\ncontemporary, the head of a scholastic procession to the Church of Saint\r\nDenis had already reached the sacred shrine before the rector had left\r\nthe Church of the _Mathurins_ in the Rue Saint Jacques, a point full six\r\nmiles distant.[46] Yet the report of Giustiniano, in 1535, stated it as\r\nthe current belief that the university still had twenty-five thousand\r\nstudents in attendance, although this seemed to be an exaggerated\r\nestimate. \"For the most part,\" he added, \"they are young, for everybody,\r\nhowever poor he may be, learns to read and write.\"[47] Another\r\nambassador, writing eleven years later, represents the students, now\r\nnumbering sixteen or twenty thousand, as extremely poor. Their\r\ninstructors, he tells us, received very modest salaries; yet, so great\r\nwas the honor attaching to the post of teacher within the university\r\nwalls, that the competition for professorial chairs was marvellously\r\nactive.[48]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the clergy fell little short of that of the university\r\nin moderating the arbitrary impulses of the monarch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gallican liberties.]\r\n\r\nThe Gallican Church had for many centuries been distinguished for a\r\nmanly defence of its liberties against the encroachments of the Papal\r\ncourt. Tenacious of the maintenance of doctrinal unity with the See of\r\nRome, the French prelates early met the growing assumption of the Popes\r\nwith determined courage. At the suggestion of the clergy, and with their\r\nfull concurrence, more than one French king adopted stringent\r\nregulations intended to protect the kingdom from becoming the prey of\r\nforeigners. Church and State were equally interested in the successful\r\nprosecution of a warfare carried on, so far as the French were\r\nconcerned, in a strictly defensive manner. The Papal treasury, under\r\nguise of _annats_, laid claim to the entire income of the bishopric or\r\nother benefice for the first year after each new appointment. It seized\r\nupon the revenues of vacant ecclesiastical offices, which the king\r\nspecially affected. Every bull or brief needed to secure induction into\r\noffice--and the number of these articles was almost unlimited--was\r\nprocured at a heavy expense. Further sums were exacted for pronouncing a\r\ndispensation in favor of those appointees whom youth or some other\r\ncanonical impediment incapacitated for the acceptance and discharge of\r\nthe requisite functions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objects of the Gallican party.]\r\n\r\nThe main objects of both crown and clergy were, consequently, to secure\r\nthe kingdom from the disastrous results of the interference of Italians\r\nin the domestic affairs of France; to preserve the treasure of the realm\r\nfrom exhaustion resulting from the levy of arbitrary imposts fixed by\r\nirresponsible aliens, and exacted through the terrors of ecclesiastical\r\npenalties; to prevent the right of election to lucrative livings from\r\nfalling into the hands of those who would use the privilege only as a\r\nmeans of acquiring riches; and to rescue clergymen themselves from\r\nbeing hurried away for trial beyond the confines of their native land,\r\nand possibly from suffering hopeless confinement in Roman dungeons. In a\r\nword, it was the aim of the Gallican party to prove that \"the government\r\nof the church is not a despotism.\"[49]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pragmatic Sanction of St. Louis.]\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat anomalous circumstance that the first decided step in\r\nrepressing the arrogant claims of the Papal See was taken by a monarch\r\nwhose singular merits have been deemed worthy of canonization by the\r\nRoman Church. Louis the Ninth had witnessed with alarm the rapid strides\r\nof the Papacy toward universal dominion. His pride was offended by the\r\npretension of the Pontiff to absolute superiority; his sovereign rights\r\nwere assailed when taxes were levied in France at the pleasure of a\r\nforeign priest and prince. He foresaw that this abuse was likely to take\r\ndeep root unless promptly met by a formal declaration placing the rights\r\nof the French monarch and nation in their true light. For this reason he\r\nissued in 1268 a solemn edict, which, as emanating from the\r\nunconstrained will of the king, took the name of the \"_Pragmatic\r\nSanction_ of Saint Louis.\"\r\n\r\nThe preamble of this famous ordinance, upon the authenticity of which\r\ndoubts have been unnecessarily cast,[50] declares the object of the king\r\nto be to secure the safety and tranquillity of the church of his realm,\r\nthe advancement of divine worship, the salvation of the souls of\r\nChrist's faithful people, and the attainment of the favor and help of\r\nAlmighty God. To his sole jurisdiction and protection had France ever\r\nbeen subject, and so did Louis desire it to remain. The provisions of\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction were directed chiefly to guarding the freedom of\r\nelection and of collation to benefices, and to prohibiting the\r\nimposition of any form of taxes by the Pope upon ecclesiastical\r\nproperty in France, save by previous consent of the prince and\r\nclergy.[51]\r\n\r\nIn this brief document had been laid the foundation of the liberties of\r\nthe Gallican Church, not under the form of novel legislation, but of a\r\nsummary of previous usage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip the Fair and Boniface.]\r\n\r\nPolitical reasons, not long after the death of Louis, gave new vigor to\r\nthe policy of opposition to which this king had pledged France. His\r\ngrandson, the resolute Philip the Fair, found fresh incitement in the\r\nextravagant conduct of a contemporary Pope, Boniface the Eighth. The\r\nbold ideas advanced by Hildebrand in the eleventh, and carried into\r\nexecution by Innocent the Third in the thirteenth century, were wrought\r\ninto the very texture of the soul of Boniface, and could not be\r\nconcealed, in spite of the altered condition of mediæval society.\r\nIntolerant, headstrong, and despotic, he undertook to exercise a\r\ntheocratic rule, and commanded contending monarchs to lay down their\r\narms, and submit their disputes to his arbitrament. To such a summons\r\nPhilip was not inclined to submit. The crafty and unscrupulous prince,\r\nwhose contempt for divine law was evidenced by his shameless practice of\r\ninjustice, whose coffers were filled indifferently by the confiscation\r\nof the rich spoils of the commanderies of the Templars, and by\r\nrecklessly debasing the national currency, did not hesitate to engage in\r\na contest with the most presumptuous of Popes. He appealed to the States\r\nGeneral, and all three orders indignantly repudiated the suggestion that\r\ntheir country had ever stood to the Papacy in the relation of a fief.\r\nThe disastrous example of the English John Lackland had found no\r\nimitator on the southern side of the channel. The Pope was declared a\r\nheretic. Emissaries of Louis seized him in his native city of Anagni,\r\nwithin the very bounds of the \"Patrimony of St. Peter,\" and the rough\r\nusage to which he was then subjected hastened his death. His successors\r\non the pontifical throne proved somewhat more tractable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Popes at Avignon.]\r\n\r\nDuring his short and unimportant pontificate, Benedict the Eleventh\r\nrestored to the chapters of cathedrals the right of electing their own\r\nbishops. Upon his death, Philip secured the elevation to the pontifical\r\ndignity of an ecclesiastic wholly devoted to French interests, the\r\nfacile Clement the Fifth, who, in return for the honor conferred upon\r\nhim, removed the seat of the Papacy to Avignon. Here for the seventy\r\nyears of the so-called \"Babylonish Captivity,\" the Popes continued to\r\nreside, too completely subject to the influence of the French monarchs\r\nto dream of resuming their tone of defiance, but scarcely less exacting\r\nthan before of homage from other rulers. In fact, the burden of the\r\npecuniary exactions of the Popes rather grew than diminished with the\r\nchange from Rome to Avignon, and with the institution of rival claimants\r\nto the tiara, each requiring an equal sum to support the pomp of his\r\ncourt, but recognized as legitimate by only a portion of Christendom.\r\nThe devices for drawing tribute from all quarters were multiplied to an\r\nalmost insupportable extent. So effectual did they prove, that no\r\npontiff, perhaps, ever left at his death a more enormous accumulation of\r\ntreasure than one of the Popes of Avignon, John the Twenty-second. Much\r\nof this wealth was derived from the rich provinces of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Schism.]\r\n\r\nClose upon the \"Captivity\" followed the \"Schism,\" during which the\r\ngenerally acknowledged Popes, who had returned to Rome, were opposed by\r\npretenders at Avignon and elsewhere. A double incentive was now given to\r\nthe monarchs of Europe for setting bounds to the ambition of the Papacy.\r\nFor while the Popes, through the loss of a great part of their authority\r\nand prestige, had become less formidable antagonists, their financial\r\nextortions had waxed so intolerable as to suggest the strongest\r\narguments appealing to the self-interest of kings. Hence the frequency\r\nwith which the demand for \"a reformation in the head and the members\"\r\nresounded from all parts of the Western Church. And hence, too, those\r\nmemorable councils of Pisa, Constance, and Basle, which, coming in rapid\r\nsuccession at the commencement of the fifteenth century, bade fair to\r\nprove the forerunners of a radical reformation. It does not belong here\r\nto discuss the causes of their failure to answer this reasonable\r\nexpectation. Yet with one of these assemblages is closely connected a\r\nvery important incident in the history of the Gallican Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Council of Bourges.]\r\n\r\nThe Council of Basle had not yet concluded its protracted sessions when\r\nCharles the Seventh summoned the clergy of France to meet him in the\r\ncity of Bourges. The times were troublous. The kingdom was rent with\r\nintestine division. A war was still raging, during the progress of which\r\nthe victorious arms of the English had driven the king from his capital\r\nand deprived him of more than one-half of his dominions. The work of\r\nreinstating the royal authority, though well begun by the wonderful\r\ninterposition of the Maid of Orleans, was as yet by no means complete.\r\nUndaunted, however, by the unsettled aspect of his affairs, Charles--the\r\n\"King of Bourges,\" as he was contemptuously styled by his\r\nopponents--made his appearance in the national council convened in his\r\ntemporary capital. He was attended by the dauphin, the Dukes of Burgundy\r\nand Brittany, the Count of Maine, and many other noblemen, as well as by\r\na goodly train of doctors of civil and canon law. Awaiting his arrival\r\nwere five archbishops, twenty-five bishops, and a host of abbots and\r\ndeputies of universities and chapters of cathedrals. In the presence of\r\nthis august convocation, in which all that was most prominent in church\r\nand state was represented, Charles published, on the seventh of July,\r\n1438, an ordinance which has become celebrated under the name of the\r\n\"Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges\"--by far the more important of the two\r\ndocuments of similar nature emanating from the French throne.[52]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges.]\r\n\r\nThe Pragmatic Sanction, as it is often called by way of pre-eminence, is\r\nthe magna charta of the liberties of the Gallican Church. Founded upon\r\nthe results of the discussions of the Council of Basle, it probably\r\nembodies all the reformatory measures which the hierarchy of France was\r\ndesirous of effecting or willing to accept. How far these were from\r\nadministering the needed antidote to the poison which was at work and\r\nthreatened to destroy all true religious life--if, indeed, that life was\r\nnot already too near extinction--may readily be understood when it is\r\ndiscovered that, with the exception of a few paragraphs relating to\r\necclesiastical discipline and worship, the following comprise all the\r\nimportant provisions:\r\n\r\nThe Pragmatic Sanction establishes the obligation of the Pope to convene\r\na general council of the church at least every ten years. The decisions\r\nof the Council of Basle are declared to be of perpetual force. Far from\r\nderiving its authority from the Holy See, the Oecumenical Council, it\r\nis affirmed, depends immediately upon Christ, and the Pope is no less\r\nbound than all other Christians to render due obedience to its\r\ndecisions. The right of appeal from the Pope to the future council--a\r\nclaim obnoxious in the last degree to the advocates of papal\r\nsupremacy--is distinctly asserted. The Pope is declared incapable of\r\nappointing to any high ecclesiastical dignities, save in a few specified\r\ncases; in all others recourse is to be had to election. The pontiff's\r\npretensions to confer minor benefices are equally rejected. No abuse is\r\nmore sharply rebuked and forbidden than that of _expectatives_--a\r\nspecies of appointment in high favor with the papal chancery, whereby a\r\nsuccessor to ecclesiastical dignities was nominated during the lifetime\r\nof the incumbent, and in view of his decease.\r\n\r\nThe Pragmatic Sanction restricts the troublesome and costly appeals to\r\nRome to cases of great importance, when the parties in interest reside\r\nat a distance of more than four days' journey from that city. At the\r\nsame time it prescribes that no one shall be vexed by such appeals after\r\nhaving enjoyed actual possession of his rank for three years. Going\r\nbeyond the limits of the kingdom, it enters into the constitution of the\r\n\"Sacred College,\" and fixes the number of the cardinals at twenty-four,\r\nwhile placing the minimum age of candidates for the hat at thirty\r\nyears. The exaction of the _annats_ is stigmatized as simony. Priests\r\nliving in concubinage are to be punished by the forfeiture of one-fourth\r\nof their annual stipend. Finally the principle is sanctioned that no\r\ninterdict can be made to include in its operation the innocent with the\r\nguilty.[53]\r\n\r\nSo thorough a vindication of the rights of the Gallican Church had never\r\nbefore been undertaken. The axe was laid at the root of formidable\r\nabuses; freedom of election was restored; the kingdom was relieved of a\r\ncrushing burden of tribute; foreigners were precluded from interfering\r\nwith the systematic administration of the laws. The clergy, both regular\r\nand secular, received the greatest benefits, for, while they could no\r\nlonger be plundered of so large a part of their incomes, their persons\r\nwere protected from arbitrary arrest and hopeless exile beyond the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe council had not adjourned when the tidings of the transactions at\r\nBourges reached the city of Basle. The members were overjoyed, and\r\ntestified their approval in a grateful letter to the Archbishop of\r\nLyons. But their exultation was more than equalled by the disgust of\r\nPope Eugenius the Third. Indeed, the pontificates of this pope and his\r\nimmediate successors were filled with fruitless attempts to effect the\r\nrepeal of the Pragmatic Sanction. A threat was made to place France\r\nunder an interdict; but this was of no avail, being answered by the\r\ncounter-threat of the king's representative, who proposed to make a\r\npractical application of the instrument, by appealing from his Holiness\r\nto a future general council. So the Pope, having a vivid recollection of\r\nthe perils attending a contest with the French crown, wisely avoided the\r\nhazardous venture.[54]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis XI. consents to its abrogation.]\r\n\r\nIn Louis the Eleventh the papal court seemed to have found a more\r\npromising prince to deal with. Animated by hatred of his father, and\r\ndisposed to oppose whatever had met his father's approval, Louis had,\r\nwhile yet dauphin, given the Pope's agents flattering assurances of his\r\ngood intentions.[55] On ascending the throne, he permitted his father's\r\nmemory to be treated with disrespect, by suffering a nuncio to pronounce\r\nabsolution over the corpse for the heinous sin of originating the\r\nPragmatic Sanction. Later, on receiving the assurance of the Pope's\r\nsupport for the house of Anjou in Naples, he consented to repeal the\r\nhateful ordinance. A royal declaration for this purpose was published in\r\n1461, contrary to the advice of the king's council.[56] It met with\r\nuniversal reprobation. The Parliament of Toulouse would register the\r\ndocument only with an accompanying note stating that this had been done\r\n\"by the most express command of the king.\" The Parliament of Paris\r\nabsolutely declined to admit it in its records, and sent a deputation to\r\nLouis to set forth the pernicious results that were to be expected from\r\nthe overthrow of his father's wise regulations.[57] The University made\r\nbold to appeal to a general council of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But subsequently re-enacts it.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it happened that Louis made the unwelcome discovery that his\r\nItalian friends had deceived him, and that the prospect was very remote\r\nof obtaining the advantages by which he had been allured. It was not\r\nvery difficult, therefore, to persuade him to renounce his project. Not\r\ncontent with this, three years after his formal revocation of the entire\r\nPragmatic Sanction, he even re-enacted some of the clauses of the\r\ndocument respecting \"expectatives\" and \"provisions.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament protests against the repeal.]\r\n\r\nBut a few years later, in 1467, Louis again conceived it to be for his\r\ninterest to abrogate the Pragmatic Sanction. At the suggestion of\r\nCardinal Balue, the recent enactment against \"expectatives\" was\r\nrepealed. The Parliament of Paris, however, refused to record the\r\nletters patent. Among other powerful arguments adduced was the fact that\r\na recent investigation had proved that, in the three years of the\r\npontificate of Pius the Second during which the Pragmatic Sanction had\r\nbeen virtually set aside (1461-1464), Rome drew from the kingdom not\r\nless than 240,000 crowns in payment of bulls for archbishoprics,\r\nbishoprics, and abbeys falling vacant within this term; 100,000 for\r\npriories and deaneries; and the enormous sum of 2,500,000 crowns for\r\n\"expectatives\" and \"dispensations.\"[58] This startling financial exhibit\r\nwas accompanied by statements of the indirect injury received by the\r\ncommunity from the great number of candidates thrown on the tender\r\nmercies of relations and friends, whom they thus beggared while awaiting\r\na long deferred preferment.[59] Even when successful, \"they received\r\nonly lead for gold.\" Frequently, when they were about to clutch the\r\ncoveted prize, a rival stepped in armed with documents annulling those\r\npreviously given. Cases had, indeed, been known in which ten or twelve\r\ncontestants presented themselves, all basing their claims upon the\r\npontifical warrant.[60]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Cardinal Balue.]\r\n\r\nCardinal Balue was not slow in finding means to remove from office the\r\nintrepid _Procureur-général_, who had been prominent in urging\r\nparliament to resist the measure of repeal. But Saint-Romain's bold\r\nstand had confirmed both parliament and university, and neither body\r\nwould acquiesce in the papal demands. Louis, however, was reconciled to\r\na second abandonment of the scheme by the opportune discovery of the\r\ncardinal's treachery. The unhappy prelate met with deserved retribution,\r\nfor his purple did not save him from enduring his own favorite mode of\r\npunishment, and being shut up in a great iron cage. The new Perillus was\r\nthus enabled--to the intense satisfaction of many whom he had\r\nwronged--to test in his own person the merits of a contrivance which he\r\nwas reputed himself to have invented.[61]\r\n\r\nA concordat subsequently agreed upon by Louis and the Pope fared no\r\nbetter than the previous compacts. Parliament and university were\r\nresolute, and the king, having no further advantage to gain by keeping\r\nhis word, was as careless in its fulfilment as was his wont. The\r\nPragmatic Sanction was still observed as the law of the land. The\r\nhighest civil courts, ignoring the alleged repeal, conformed their\r\ndecisions to its letter and spirit, while the theologians of the\r\nSorbonne taught it as the foundation of the ecclesiastical constitution\r\nof France. Yet, public confidence in its validity having been shaken, it\r\nwas desirable to set all doubts at rest by a formal re-enactment. This\r\nwas proposed by the Dean of St. Martin of Tours, in the States General\r\nheld during the minority of Charles the Eighth; but, notwithstanding the\r\nwell-known opinion of all the orders, this reign passed without the\r\nadoption of any decided action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Action of Louis XII.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His motto.]\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Louis the Twelfth to take the desired step. In 1499\r\nhe published the Pragmatic Sanction anew, and ordered the exclusion from\r\noffice of all that had obtained benefices from Rome. In vain did the\r\nPope rave. In vain did he summon all upholders of the ordinance to\r\nappear before the Fifth Lateran Council. The sturdy prince--the \"Father\r\nof his people\"--who had chosen for his motto the device, \"_Perdam\r\nBabylonis nomen_,\" made little account of the menaces of Julius the\r\nSecond, whom death overtook, it is said, while about to fulminate a bull\r\ntransferring the title of \"Very Christian King\" from Louis the Twelfth\r\nof France to Henry the Eighth of England.[62]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concordat of Leo X. and Francis I.]\r\n\r\nThirsting for military distinction, Francis the First had no sooner\r\nobtained the throne than he entered upon the career of arms in northern\r\nItaly, and the signal victory of Marignano, won less than ten months\r\nafter his accession (September 13, 1515), closed his first campaign.\r\nThis success was productive of more lasting results than merely the\r\ntemporary possession of the Milanese. It led to a reconciliation with\r\nthe Pope, and to a stately interview in the city of Bologna. All that\r\nwas magnificent and captivating to the senses had been studied to dazzle\r\nthe eyes of a young and imaginative prince; for Leo the Tenth, patron of\r\nthe arts and of artists, was an adept in scenic effects. Certainly never\r\ndid pomp and ceremony more easily effect the object for which they were\r\nemployed. The interview of Bologna paved the way for a concordat, in\r\nwhich the rights of the Gallican Church were sacrificed, and the spoils\r\ndivided between king and pontiff.[63] Three cardinals took part in the\r\nelaboration of the details of the instrument--two on the pontifical, the\r\nthird on the royal side. The last was the notorious Cardinal Duprat,\r\nelevated by Francis to the office of chancellor--a minister of religion\r\nwho was soon to introduce venality into every department of government.\r\nThe source of the concordat determined tolerably well its character.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the strength of the opposition its pretensions had always\r\nencountered in France, the papal court had resolved to renounce a\r\nportion of its claims in favor of the king, in order to retain the rest\r\nmore securely. Under the pretext that the right of election vested in\r\nthe chapters had been abused, partly by the choice of illiterate and\r\nimproper men, partly through the practice of simony, the selection of\r\narchbishops and bishops was taken from them and confided to the king. He\r\nwas empowered to choose a doctor or licentiate of theology or law, not\r\nless than twenty-seven years of age, within six months after the see\r\nbecame vacant. The name of the candidate was to be submitted to the Pope\r\nfor approval, and, if this first nomination was rejected, a second was\r\nto be made by the king. Similar regulations were made respecting abbeys\r\nand monastic institutions in general, a few exceptions being allowed in\r\nfavor of those patrons and bodies to whom special privileges had been\r\naccorded. The issue of \"expectatives\" was prohibited; but, as no mention\r\nwas made of the \"annats,\" it followed, of course, that this rich source\r\nof gain to the papal treasury was to lie open, in spite of the\r\nprovisions of the Pragmatic Sanction to the contrary.[64]\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the leading features of the concordat between Leo the\r\nTenth and Francis the First--a document introducing changes so violent\r\nas to amount almost to a complete revolution in the ecclesiastical\r\nconstitution of the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissatisfaction of the French.]\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the unqualified approval of the Lateran Council, in a\r\nsession at which few prelates were present from outside of Italy, the\r\nconcordat, engrossed on white damask, and accompanied by a revocation of\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction on cloth of gold, was forwarded to Francis, who\r\nhad now returned to his kingdom. The latter, not ignorant of the\r\ndiscontent already engendered by the mere rumor of the transaction,\r\nfirst submitted the concordat alone to a mixed assembly composed of\r\nprelates and canons, of presidents and counsellors of parliament,\r\ndoctors of the university, and other prominent personages. But the\r\nking's caution failed of accomplishing what had been intended. The\r\ngeneral dissatisfaction found expression in the speech of Cardinal\r\nBoissy, demanding that the clergy be consulted by itself on a matter so\r\nvitally affecting its interests, and suggesting the necessity of a\r\nnational council for that purpose. Francis angrily retorted that the\r\nclergy _must obey_, or he would send its bishops to Rome to discuss with\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Struggle with the parliaments.]\r\n\r\nFailing in the attempt to forestall the expression of disapprobation of\r\nthe judiciary by securing the favorable verdict of a picked assembly of\r\ninfluential persons, the king, nevertheless, proceeded to carry into\r\nexecution that clause of the concordat which enjoined ratification by\r\nthe parliaments. Letters patent were first dispatched commanding all\r\njudges to conform to its provisions, and these were followed shortly by\r\ncopies of the instrument itself and of the revocation of the Pragmatic\r\nSanction, for registry. At this point properly began one of the most\r\nnotable contests between the crown and parliaments of France. The\r\nParliament of Paris, taking the ground that so fundamental a change in\r\nthe national customs demanded mature consideration, deferred action.\r\nWith the view of exercising a pressure on its deliberations, Francis now\r\ncommissioned his uncle, the Bastard of Savoy, to be present at the\r\nsessions. Against this unprecedented breach of privilege parliament sent\r\na deputation humbly to remonstrate; but all to no purpose. The irritated\r\nprince, who entertained the most extravagant views of the royal\r\nprerogative, declared his intention to satisfy himself concerning the\r\nreal disposition of his judges, and assured the deputies that he had\r\nfirmly resolved to despatch the disobedient to the inferior parliaments\r\nof Bordeaux and Toulouse, and fill their places with \"men of worth.\" \"I\r\nam your king,\" was his constant exclamation, and this passed with him\r\nfor an unanswerable argument in support of his views. But the members of\r\nparliament were not easily moved. Undoubtedly the success attending\r\ntheir previous resistance to the repeal of the Pragmatic Sanction, on\r\nat least three occasions in the reign of Louis the Eleventh, emboldened\r\nthem in the present instance. Unawed by the presence of the Bastard of\r\nSavoy, they refused to concede the registration of the concordat, and\r\ndeclared that they must continue to observe the Pragmatic Sanction,\r\nendorsed, as that ordinance had been, by the representatives of the\r\nentire nation. Not only did they protest against suffering the Sanction\r\nto be annulled, but they insisted upon the convocation of the clergy in\r\na body similar to that assembled by Charles the Seventh, as an\r\nindispensable preliminary to the investigation of the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Haughty demeanor of the king.]\r\n\r\nFrancis, who happened to be at his castle of Amboise, on the Loire, now\r\nsent word that parliament should appoint a deputation to convey to him\r\nthe reasons of its refusal. But when the delegates reached the\r\ncastle-gate, an entire month elapsed before Francis would condescend to\r\ngrant them audience. They were at length admitted, only to be treated\r\nwith studied contempt. \"There can be but one king in France,\" was the\r\narrogant language of the young prince to the judges who had grown gray\r\nin the service of Charles the Eighth and the good King Louis. \"You speak\r\nas if you were not my subjects, and as if I dared not try you and\r\nsentence you to lose your heads.\" And when the indignity of his words\r\nawakened the spirited remonstrance of the deputies, Francis rejoined: \"I\r\nam king: I can dispose of my parliament at my pleasure. Begone, and\r\nreturn to Paris at break of day.\"\r\n\r\nA formal command was now addressed to the Parliament of Paris, and the\r\nbearer, La Trémouille, informed that body, as it listened to the\r\nmessage, that Francis had repeated to him more than ten times within a\r\nquarter of an hour, \"that he would not for half his kingdom fail of his\r\nword to the Pope, and that if parliament rebelled, he would find means\r\nto make it repent of its obstinacy.\" Under these circumstances, further\r\nresistance from a body so completely dependent on the sovereign was not\r\nto be thought of. Yet, even when compelled to yield, parliament, at the\r\nsuggestion of the _gens du roi_, coupled the registry of the concordat\r\nwith a declaration that it was made at the express command of the king\r\nseveral times reiterated, that parliament disapproved of the revocation\r\nof the Pragmatic Sanction; and that, in the adjudication of causes, it\r\nwould continue to follow the ordinance of Charles the Seventh, while\r\nappealing to the Pope under better advisement, and to a future council\r\nof the church. Thus the concordat, projected at Bologna in 1515, and\r\nsigned at Rome on the sixteenth of August, 1516, was registered by the\r\nParliament of Paris _de expressissimo mandato regis_, on the\r\ntwenty-second of March, 1518.[65]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The university remonstrates.]\r\n\r\nEven now Francis had not quite silenced all opposition. The rector of\r\nthe University of Paris, not content with entering a formal\r\nremonstrance,[66] took a bolder step. Making use of a prerogative long\r\nsince conceded to the university, of exercising a censure over the\r\npress, he posted a notice to all printers and publishers forbidding the\r\nreproduction of the concordat on pain of loss of their privileges. The\r\ndean and canons of the cathedral church of Paris also handed in a\r\nprotest. The preachers of several churches rivalled the rector in\r\naudacity, by publicly inveighing against the dangers of the\r\necclesiastical innovations introduced by the king. It is not surprising\r\nthat a prince impatient even of wholesome rebuke was enraged at this\r\nmonkish tirade. Parliament was ordered to bring the culprits to justice;\r\nbut, strange to say, none could be discovered--a circumstance certainly\r\nattributable rather to the supineness of the judges than to any lack of\r\nwitnesses. To the university Francis wrote in a haughty vein,\r\nthreatening the severe punishment of any of its doctors that dared\r\npreach against the government; while, by an edict from Amboise, he\r\nforbade the rector and his associates from assembling for the discussion\r\nof political questions.\r\n\r\nThese were the closing scenes of the exciting drama. The king had\r\ntriumphed, but not without encountering a spirited opposition from\r\nparliament, university, and clergy. If these had succumbed, it had only\r\nbeen before superior strength, and each of the bodies reserved to itself\r\nthe right of treating the concordat as a nullity and the Pragmatic\r\nSanction as still the ecclesiastical constitution of the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The resistance not altogether fruitless.]\r\n\r\nNor was this altogether an empty claim. Some of the provisions of the\r\nconcordat were never enforced, and that was a solid advantage gained\r\nthrough the opposition. The parliaments persisted in rendering judgment,\r\nin such cases as came before them, in conformity with the Pragmatic\r\nSanction. The Bishop of Albi, chosen by the canons, was confirmed in his\r\nsee, notwithstanding the pretensions of a nominee of the crown. And yet\r\nthe concordat was not merely maintained by the Pope and the king, but, a\r\nfew years later, its provisions were extended to monastic foundations\r\npreviously possessed of an undisputed title to elect. This was done to\r\ngratify Francis on the marriage of his second son Henry to Catharine de'\r\nMedici, niece of Clement, the reigning pontiff. The somewhat suspicious\r\nstory is told, that, to aid in carrying out this new act of injustice,\r\nCardinal Duprat, having ordered all ecclesiastical bodies to send him\r\nthe original documents attesting their right of election, at once\r\nconsigned the parchments to the fire, in order to destroy all memory of\r\nthese troublesome claims. If the tale be apocryphal, it at least\r\nindicates sufficiently well the estimation in which the prelate's\r\ncharacter was held by his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages gained by the crown.]\r\n\r\nThe clergy reluctantly admitted the concordat into their books after the\r\nlapse of two centuries, but solely, as they declared, for convenience of\r\nreference. The restoration of the Pragmatic Sanction continued to be\r\ndemanded by one or all the orders of the States General, during the\r\nreigns of Francis the Second, Charles the Ninth, and their successors,\r\nnot least on the ground that the day that witnessed its repeal also\r\nbeheld the introduction of the \"heresy\" that had since attained such\r\nformidable proportions.[67] But, if opposed and denounced, the concordat\r\nwas carried into execution, so far as most of its provisions were\r\nconcerned, until the French revolution. The advantages gained by the\r\ncrown were too palpable to be voluntarily relinquished. Almost the\r\nentire patronage of the church was thrown into the hands of the king,\r\nwho, in the reign of Louis the Fifteenth, held at his disposal eighteen\r\narchbishoprics, 112 bishoprics, 1,666 abbeys for men, and 317 abbeys and\r\npriories for women.[68] It must not be forgotten that the _annats_, or\r\nfirst-fruits of benefices, now regularly falling into the pontifical\r\ntreasury, made the concordat scarcely less valuable to the Papal\r\nSee.[69]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Era of the Renaissance.]\r\n\r\nThe most enviable distinction of the reign of Francis the First\r\nconsisted in the fact that it was the era of that extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the fine arts and of literature known as the\r\n_Renaissance_. Illustrious during the Middle Ages, and foremost in the\r\npursuit of scholastic learning, France had unfortunately lost that proud\r\neminence when the revival of letters enkindled elsewhere a new passion\r\nfor discovery. Her adventurous sons had taken the lead in the crusades\r\nof the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but three hundred years later no\r\nexpeditions were fitted out in her ports to explore and appropriate the\r\nvirgin territories beyond the western sea. The art of printing and the\r\nimpulse given to astronomical research originated abroad. The famous\r\nmediæval seat of learning seemed to have been suddenly visited with a\r\npremature decay. Even the exiled scholars of the East, fleeing before\r\nTurkish barbarism, disdained to settle in a country where the treasures\r\nof ancient science which they had brought with them from Mount Athos and\r\nConstantinople were so inadequately appreciated.[70]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis's attainments overrated.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A munificent patron of art.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Francis the First, however, was destined to remove much of\r\nthe reproach which had been incurred by reason of this singular\r\ntardiness in entering the path of improvement. Born of parents possessed\r\nof unusual intelligence and yet rarer education, and stimulated by the\r\ncompanionship of an elder sister whose extensive acquirements furnished\r\nthe theme of countless panegyrics, Francis early conceived the design of\r\nmaking his court illustrious for the generous patronage extended to the\r\ndisciples of the liberal arts. His own attainments have been overrated,\r\nand posterity has too credulously believed all that admiring and\r\ninterested courtiers chose to invent in his praise. But, if he was\r\nhimself ignorant of anything beyond the mere rudiments even of Latin,\r\nthe universal language of science, he possessed at least one signal\r\nmerit: he was a munificent friend of those whom poverty would otherwise\r\nhave precluded from cultivating their resplendent abilities. I shall not\r\nrepeat the familiar names of the eminent painters and sculptors whom he\r\nencouraged and enriched, nor give a list of the skilful architects\r\nemployed in the construction of his magnificent palaces of St. Germain\r\nand Fontainebleau, of Chambord and Chenonceaux. Poetry, not less than\r\npainting and architecture, witnessed his liberality. Clément Marot,\r\nwhose name has been regarded as marking the first truly remarkable epoch\r\nin the history of this department of French art,[71] was a favorite at\r\nthe court of Francis and Margaret of Angoulême, and repaid their gifts\r\nwith unbounded eulogy. The more solid studies of the philosopher and the\r\nlinguist were fostered with equal care. Vatable, Melchior Wolmar, and\r\nother scholars of note were invited to France, to give instruction in\r\nGreek and Hebrew. Erasmus himself might have been induced to yield to\r\nthe king's importunate messages, could he have been able to divest\r\nhimself of the apprehension of annoyance from the bigoted \"Sorbonnists;\"\r\nwhile even Melanchthon was, at a later period, on the point of accepting\r\na pressing summons to visit the French court on a mission of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foundation of the Collége Royal.]\r\n\r\nAmong the most notable achievements of this prince was the foundation of\r\na school of learning intended to supply the deficiencies of the\r\ninstruction given by the university. In the \"Collége Royal\" Francis\r\ndesired to leave a lasting token of his devotion to letters. Here he\r\nfounded chairs of three languages--of Greek and Hebrew at first, and\r\nafterward of Latin--whence was derived the name of _Trilingue_, under\r\nwhich the college was celebrated in the writings of the day. The\r\nmonarch's plan encountered the obstacles which prejudice always knows\r\nhow to set in the way of improvement. The university doctors, fearing\r\nthat their own prelections would be forsaken for the more brilliant\r\nlectures of the salaried professors of the royal school, demanded that\r\nthe latter should submit to an examination before the more ancient body\r\nof instructors; but parliament wisely rejected their pretensions.\r\nLiberal men throughout the world rejoiced at the defeat of the Sorbonne\r\nand its representative, Beda,[72] while Marot, alluding to the quarrel\r\nin a poetical epistle to the king, poured out in verse his contempt for\r\nthe \"Theologasters\" of Paris:\r\n\r\n                    \"L'ignorante Sorbonne;\r\n    Bien ignorante elle est d'estre ennemie\r\n    De la _Trilingue_ et noble Academie\r\n    Qu'as érigée....\r\n    O povres gens de savoir tout éthiques!\r\n    Bien faites vray ce proverbe courant:\r\n    '_Science n'ha hayneux que l'ignorant!_'\"\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to French scholarship to omit all notice of the fact\r\nthat there were not wanting natives of France itself whose sound\r\nlearning entitled them to rank with the most conscientious of German\r\nhumanists; such men as Lefèvre d'Étaples, a prodigy of almost universal\r\nacquirements; or Louis de Berquin, who furnishes a signal instance of a\r\nnobleman of high position that did not shun the toil and danger of a\r\nmore than ordinarily profound investigation of theological truth. Both\r\nwill claim our attention again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An age of blood.]\r\n\r\nYet, by the side or these manifestations of a growing appreciation of\r\nart, science, and letters, it must be confessed that there were\r\nindications, no less distinct, of a lamentable neglect of moral\r\ntraining, and of a state of manners scarcely raised above that of\r\nuncivilized communities of men. It was still an age of blood. The pages\r\nof chronicles, both public and private, teem with proofs of the\r\ninsignificant value set upon human life and happiness. In many parts of\r\nFrance the peasant rarely enjoyed quiet for even a few consecutive\r\nmonths. Organized bands of robbers, familiarly known as \"Mauvais\r\nGarçons,\" infested whole provinces, and laid towns and villages under\r\ncontribution. Not unfrequently two or three hundred men were to be found\r\nin a single band, and the robberies, outrages, and murders they\r\ncommitted defy recital. Often the miscreants were _aventuriers_, or\r\nvolunteers whose employers had failed to furnish them their stipulated\r\npay, and who avenged their losses by exactions levied upon the\r\nunfortunate peasantry. Indeed, if we may believe the almost incredible\r\nstatements of one of the laws enacted for their suppression, they had\r\nbeen known to carry by assault even walled cities, and to exercise\r\nagainst the miserable inhabitants cruelty such as disgraces the very\r\nname of man.[73]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Barbarous punishments.]\r\n\r\nThe character or the punishments inflicted for the commission of crime\r\nfurnishes a convenient test of national civilization. If France in the\r\nsixteenth century be tried by this criterion, the conclusion is\r\ninevitable that for her the age of barbarism had not yet completely\r\npassed away. The catalogue of crimes to which death was affixed as the\r\npenalty is frightfully long; some of them were almost trivial offences.\r\nA boy less than sixteen years of age was hung for stealing jewelry from\r\nhis master.[74] On the other hand, with flagrant inconsistency, a\r\nnobleman, René de Bonneville, superintendent of the royal mint, for the\r\nmurder of his brother-in-law, was dragged to the place of execution on a\r\nhurdle, but suffered the less ignominious fate of decapitation. A part\r\nof his property was given to his sister, and the rest confiscated to the\r\ncrown, with the exception of four hundred livres, reserved for the\r\npurchase of masses to be said for the benefit of the soul of his\r\nmurdered victim.[75]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Especially for heresy.]\r\n\r\nFor other culprits extraordinary refinements of cruelty were reserved.\r\nThe _aventuriers_, when so ill-starred as to fall into the hands of\r\njustice, were customarily burned alive at the stake.[76] The same fate\r\novertook those who were detected in frauds against the public treasury.\r\nMore frightful than all the rest was the vengeance taken by the law upon\r\nthe counterfeiter of the king's coin. The legal penalty, which is said\r\nto have become a dead letter on the pages of the statute-book long\r\nbefore the French revolution, was in the sixteenth century rigidly\r\nenforced: on the 9th of November, 1527, a rich merchant of Paris, having\r\nbeen found guilty of the crime in question, was boiled alive before the\r\nassembled multitude in the _Marché-aux-pourceaux_.[77] Heresy and\r\nblasphemy were treated with no greater degree of leniency than the most\r\ninfamous of crimes. Even before the reformation a lingering death in the\r\nflames had been the doom pronounced upon the person who dared to accept\r\nor promulgate doctrines condemned by the church. But when the bitterness\r\nof strife had awakened the desire to enhance the punishment of dissent,\r\nnew or extraordinary tortures were resorted to, of the application of\r\nwhich this history will furnish only too many examples. The forehead was\r\nbranded, the tongue torn out, the hand cut off at the wrist, or the\r\nagonies of death prolonged by alternately dropping the wretched victim\r\ninto the fire and drawing him out again, until exhausted nature found\r\ntardy release in death.\r\n\r\nBut if we can to some extent account for the excess of cruelty which\r\nblind frenzy inflicted on the inflexible martyr to his faith, it is\r\ncertainly more difficult to explain the severity exercised upon the more\r\npliable, whom the arguments of ghostly advisers, or the terrors of the\r\n_Place de Grève_, had induced to recant. Generally the judge did nothing\r\nmore in their behalf than commute their punishment by ordering them to\r\nbe strangled before their bodies were consigned to the flames.[78] Yet\r\nin one exceptional case--that of a servant whose master, a gentleman and\r\none of the men-at-arms of the Regent of Scotland, was burned alive--the\r\ncourt went to such a length of leniency as to let the repentant heretic\r\noff with the sentence that he first be beaten with rods at the cart's\r\nend, and afterwards have his tongue cut out.[79] Even the clearest\r\nevidence of insanity did not suffice to remove or even mitigate the\r\npenalties of impiety. A poor, crazy woman, who had broken the\r\nconsecrated wafer when administered to her in her illness, and had\r\napplied to it some offensive but absurd epithet, was unhesitatingly\r\ncondemned to the stake. An appeal to a superior court procuring no\r\nreversal of her sentence, she was burned at Tours in the year 1533.[80]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belief in astrology.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Predictions of Nostradamus.]\r\n\r\nOther marks of a low stage of civilization were not wanting. The belief\r\nin judicial astrology was almost universal.[81] Pretenders like\r\nNostradamus obtained respect and wealth at the hands of their dupes. All\r\nFrance trembled with Catharine de' Medici, when the astrologer gave out\r\nthat the queen would see all her sons kings, and every one foreboded the\r\nspeedy extinction of the royal line. The \"prophecy,\" as it was gravely\r\nstyled, obtained public recognition, and was discussed in diplomatic\r\npapers. When two of the queen's sons had in fact become kings of France,\r\nand a third had been elected to the throne of Poland, while the marriage\r\nof the fourth with Queen Elizabeth was under consideration, Catharine's\r\nallies saw grounds to congratulate her that the prediction which had so\r\ndisquieted her was likely to obtain a more pleasing fulfilment than in\r\nthe successive deaths of her male descendants.[82]\r\n\r\nA still more pernicious form of superstition was noticeable in the\r\ncredit enjoyed by charms and incantations, not merely among illiterate\r\nrustics, but even with persons of high social station. No phase of the\r\nmagic art led to the commission of more terrible crimes or revealed a\r\nworse side of human character than that which pretended to secure the\r\nhappiness or accomplish the ruin, to prolong the life or hasten the\r\ndeath, of the objects of private love or hatred. While systematically\r\npractising upon the credulity of his dupes, the professed master of this\r\nill-omened art frequently resorted to assassination by poison or dagger\r\nin the accomplishment of his schemes. Sorcery by means of waxen images\r\nwas particularly in vogue. Thus, the Queen of Navarre, the sister of\r\nFrancis the First, in her singular collection of tales, the\r\n\"Heptameron,\" gives a circumstantial account of the mode in which her\r\nown life was sought by this species of witchcraft.[83] Five puppets had\r\nbeen provided: three, representing enemies (the queen being one of the\r\nnumber), had their arms hanging down; the other two, representing\r\npersons whose favor was desired, had them raised aloft. With certain\r\ncabalistic words and occult rites the puppets were next secretly hidden\r\nbeneath an altar whereon the mass was celebrated, and the mysterious\r\n\"sacrifice\" was believed to complete the efficacy of the charm. It was\r\nno new superstition imported from abroad, but one that had existed in\r\nFrance for centuries.[84]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reverence for relics.]\r\n\r\nThe French were behind no other nation in reverence for relics of saints\r\nand for pictures and images representing them. In the partial list,\r\ncompiled by a contemporary, of the curiosities of this nature scattered\r\nthrough Christendom,[85] the majority of the relics mentioned are\r\nselected from the immense treasures laid up in the thousands of\r\ncathedrals, parish churches, and abbeys within the domains of the \"Very\r\nChristian King.\" In one place the hair of the blessed Virgin was\r\ncarefully preserved; in another the sword of the archangel Michael, or\r\nthe entire body of St. Dionysius. It was true that the Pope had by\r\nsolemn bull, about a century before, declared, in the presence of the\r\nFrench ambassador, that the entire body of this last-named saint was in\r\nthe possession of the inhabitants of Ratisbon; but, had any one been so\r\nrash as to affirm at Saint Denis, near Paris, that the veritable remains\r\nwere not there, he would certainly have been stoned.[86] At Notre-Dame\r\nde l'Ile, above Lyons, no little account was made of the _twelve combs_\r\nof the apostles![87]\r\n\r\nThe reflecting man who found, by a comparison of the treasures of\r\ndifferent churches within his own personal observation, that some of the\r\npretended relics were frivolous or impossible, and that the same members\r\nof some favorite saint were reproduced at points widely distant, might\r\nwell speculate upon the probable benefits to Christendom from a complete\r\ninventory of the contents of the churches of two or three thousand\r\nbishoprics, of twenty or thirty thousand abbeys, and of more than forty\r\nthousand convents.[88] He might find difficulty in believing that our\r\nLord was crucified with fourteen nails; that \"an entire hedge\" should\r\nhave been requisite to plait the crown of thorns; that a single spear\r\nshould have begotten three others; or that from a solitary napkin there\r\nshould have issued a whole brood of the same kind.[89] He would be\r\nscandalized on learning that each apostle had more than four bodies, and\r\nthe saints at least two or three apiece.[90] And his faith in the\r\ngenuineness of the objects of popular adoration would be still further\r\nshaken, if, on subjecting them to a closer examination, he discovered\r\nthat, as was the case at Geneva, he had been worshipping a bone of a\r\ndeer as the arm of Saint Anthony, or a piece of pumice for the brain of\r\nthe apostle Peter.[91]\r\n\r\nBut, whatever sceptical conclusions might be reached by the learned and\r\ndiscerning, the devotion of the common people showed no signs of\r\nflagging. In the parish church of St. Stephen at Noyon, it was not the\r\nChristian proto-martyr alone that was decorated with a cap and other\r\ngewgaws, when his yearly festival came around, but likewise the\r\n\"tyrants,\" as they were styled by the people, who stoned him. And the\r\npoor women, seeing them thus adorned, took them to be companions of the\r\nsaint, and each one had his candle. The devil with whom St. Michael\r\ncontended fared equally well.[92] The very stones that were the\r\ninstruments of St. Stephen's death were adored at Arles and\r\nelsewhere.[93] It was, however, to the Parisians that the palm in this\r\nspecies of superstition rightfully belonged. The knife wherewith an\r\nimpious Jew had stabbed a consecrated wafer was held in higher esteem\r\nthan the wafer itself! And so marked was the preference that it aroused\r\nthe displeasure of one of the most bigoted doctors of the Sorbonne, De\r\nQuercu, who reproached the Parisians for being worse than the Jews\r\nthemselves, \"inasmuch as they adored the knife that had served to rend\r\nthe precious body of Jesus Christ.\"[94]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The consecrated wafer.]\r\n\r\nWhen such superstitious respect was paid to the relics of saints, it is\r\nnot surprising that the consecrated wafer or host received the most\r\nextravagant marks of adoration. The king himself was often foremost in\r\npublic demonstrations in its honor. Louise de Savoie, mother of Francis\r\nthe First, relates in her quaint diary the pompous ceremonial observed\r\nin restoring to its original position a pyx containing the host which\r\nhad been stolen from the chapel of the palace of St. Germain-en-Laye.\r\nThe culprit had suffered the customary penalty, having had his hand cut\r\noff and being afterward burned alive. In the expiatory procession which\r\ntook place a few days later, Francis himself walked with uncovered head\r\nand carrying a lighted taper in his hand, from Nanterre to St. Germain.\r\nIf we may credit his mother's somewhat partial account, the sight of the\r\nmonarch's signal piety was so touching as to bring tears to the eyes of\r\nadmiring spectators.[95]\r\n\r\nIn view of the general prevalence of debasing forms of superstition\r\namong the people, it is not inappropriate to consider the condition of\r\nthat class of the population which is wont to exert the most potent\r\ninfluence in forming the moral sentiments and moulding the character of\r\nthe unlettered masses. We have already touched upon the external\r\nrelations of the clergy to the king and to the Pope; let us now look\r\nmore narrowly into its internal state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wealth and power of the clergy.]\r\n\r\nAt the period of which I am now treating, the clergy, both regular and\r\nsecular, had attained unprecedented wealth and power. Never, perhaps,\r\nhad France been more fully represented in the \"Sacred College.\"\r\nAssuredly never since the residence of the Popes in Avignon had the\r\nFrench members possessed such immense riches. Thirteen French cardinals\r\nsat in the papal consistory at one time in the reign of Francis the\r\nFirst; twelve at the accession of his son to the throne.[96] Their\r\ninfluence in the kingdom was almost beyond conception, both on account\r\nof the multitude of benefices they held, and the distinction of the\r\nfamilies from whom they sprang and whose titles they retained. Some were\r\nthe incumbents of as many as _ten_ bishoprics and abbeys; while the\r\ncardinals of Bourbon, of Lorraine, of Châtillon, of Du Bellay, and of\r\nArmagnac were of the best blood in the realm, and enjoyed in their own\r\nright, or by reason of their office, very extensive jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-residence of the prelates.]\r\n\r\nA standing reproach against the prelates was their non-residence in the\r\ndioceses committed to their pastoral supervision. In fact, when the\r\nCouncil of Trent, by one of its first decrees, forbade a plurality of\r\nbenefices and enjoined residence, its action was regarded as an open\r\ndeclaration of war against the French episcopate.[97] But if this abuse\r\nis deplored by Roman Catholic historians as the fruitful cause of the\r\nintroduction and rapid progress of Protestantism,[98] the reformers,\r\nviewing their work as an instrument specially designed by heaven for the\r\npurification of a corrupt church, might well be justified in regarding\r\nthe negligence of the bishops as a wise providential arrangement. Many a\r\nfeeble germ of truth was spared the violence of persecution until the\r\nkindly sun and the plentiful showers had conferred greater powers of\r\nendurance. Happily for the reformers, the duty of watching for the first\r\nappearance of reputed heresy, which belonged properly to the bishops,\r\nwas but poorly discharged by many of the deputies to whom they entrusted\r\nit. Nor could a delegated authority always accomplish what might have\r\nbeen done by a principal.[99]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revenues of the clergy.]\r\n\r\nThe annual revenues of the clergy of France were estimated by a Venetian\r\nambassador, with unsurpassed facilities for obtaining accurate\r\ninformation, at six million crowns of gold, out of the fifteen millions\r\nthat constituted the total revenues of the kingdom. While the clergy\r\nthus absorbed _two-fifths_ of the whole income of France, the king was\r\nlimited to one million and a half crowns, or just one-tenth, derived\r\nfrom his particular estates.[100]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morals of the clergy.]\r\n\r\nWealth had engendered luxury and vice. Engrossed in the pursuit of\r\npleasure or personal aggrandizement, the vast majority of clergymen had\r\nlost all solicitude for the spiritual welfare of their flocks. About\r\nthe middle of the century Claude Haton, curate of Mériot--certainly no\r\nfriend of the reformatory movement--wrote in his Mémoires: \"The more\r\nrapidly the number of heretics in France increased, the more indifferent\r\nto the discharge of their duty in their charges were the prelates and\r\npastors of the church, from cardinals and archbishops down to the most\r\ninsignificant curate. They cared little or nothing how anything went, if\r\nthey could but draw the income of their benefices at whatever place of\r\nresidence they had selected with a view to the promotion of their\r\npleasure.[101] They let their benefices out at the highest rate they\r\ncould get, little solicitous as to the hands they might fall into,\r\nprovided only they were well paid according to the terms of the\r\nagreement. The archbishops, bishops, and cardinals of France were almost\r\nall at the court of the king and the princes. The abbots, priors and\r\ncurates resided in the large cities and in other places, wherein they\r\ntook more delight than within the limits of their charges and preaching\r\nthe true word of God to their subjects and parishioners. From their\r\nindifference the Lutheran heretics took occasion to slander the Church\r\nof Jesus Christ and to seduce Christians from it.\"[102]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No regard to the spiritual wants of the people.]\r\n\r\nSuch a condition of utter indifference on the part of the clergy to the\r\ninterests of the souls committed to their charge cannot surprise us when\r\nwe learn that benefices were conferred without regard to the wants of\r\nthe people. The Venetian Soranzo, in an address delivered after the\r\nfruits of the concordat had had full time to mature,[103] declared that\r\nin the majority of cases these ecclesiastical positions were dispensed\r\nwith little respect to things sacred, and through simple favor. They\r\nserved as a convenient method of rewarding good services. Little account\r\nwas made of the qualifications of the candidate, who might have earned\r\nhis reward in the army or in the civil service. And so it often happened\r\nthat he who to-day was a merchant or a soldier, to-morrow was made\r\nbishop or abbot. When, indeed, the fortunate man had a wife or was\r\nreluctant to assume the habit, he could readily get permission to place\r\nthe benefice in the name of another, himself retaining the income.[104]\r\n\"These new pastors,\" said Correro, \"placed in charge of the churches men\r\nwho had taken it into their heads to be clergymen only to avoid the\r\ntoils of some other occupation--men who, by their avarice and\r\ndissoluteness of life, confused the innocent people and removed their\r\nprevious great devotion. _This was the door, this was the spacious\r\ngateway, by which heresies entered France._ For the ministers sent from\r\nGeneva were easily able to create in the people a hatred of the priests\r\nand friars, _by simply weighing in the balance the life led by the\r\nlatter_.\"[105]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The clergy before the concordat.]\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion among those who passed for philosophers to ascribe\r\nthe universal dissolution of morals among French ecclesiastics to the\r\noperation of the concordat between Francis the First and Pope Leo the\r\nTenth, which, said they, by bringing so many bishops and other high\r\ndignitaries to the court in quest of preferment, had corrupted the\r\ncharacters of the prelates, while exposing their flocks to all the evils\r\nwhich neglect is wont to breed. Unfortunately, the portraits of the\r\nperiod preceding the revocation of the Pragmatic Sanction that have come\r\ndown to us dispel the Arcadian simplicity of manners which seems only to\r\nhave existed in the imagination of a few warm admirers of everything\r\nancient. If the prelates of France were dissolute after the introduction\r\nof the concordat, we are assured by a writer by no means partial to the\r\n\"new doctrines,\" that the state of affairs was no better at an earlier\r\nperiod. In their abbeys or bishoprics they were as debauched as those\r\nwho followed arms for their profession.[106] The bishops bought their\r\nplaces with money, or with promises which were to be fulfilled after\r\npreferment. \"And when they had attained these high dignities,\" he adds,\r\n\"God knows what lives they led. Assuredly they were far more devoted to\r\ntheir dioceses than they have since been; for they never left them. But\r\nit was to lead a most dissolute life with their dogs and birds, with\r\ntheir feasts, banquets, marriage entertainments and courtezans, of whom\r\nthey gathered seraglios.... All this was permitted, and none dared to\r\nremonstrate or utter censure. Even more could be related, which is\r\npassed over in silence through fear of creating scandal. Our present\r\nbishops, if not better men, are at least more discreet hypocrites, and\r\nmore skilfully conceal their black vices.\"[107] Nor were the morals of\r\nthe monastic orders depicted in brighter colors. \"Generally the monks\r\nelected the most jovial companion, him who was the most fond of women,\r\ndogs, and birds, the deepest drinker--in short, the most dissipated; and\r\nthis in order that, when they had made him abbot or prior, they might be\r\npermitted to indulge in similar debauch and pleasure. Indeed, they bound\r\nhim beforehand by strong oaths, to which he was forced to conform either\r\nvoluntarily or by constraint. The worst was that, when they failed to\r\nagree in their elections, they usually came to blows with fist and\r\nsword, and inflicted wounds and even death. In a word, there was more\r\ntumult, more faction and intrigue, than there is at the election of the\r\nRector of the University of Paris.\"[108] It was not strange, therefore,\r\nthat Francis, unable otherwise to recompense his deserving nobles,\r\nshould prefer to bestow upon them rich abbeys and priories, rather than\r\nleave these to the monks in their cloisters--monks who, as the monarch\r\nused to say, \"were good for nothing but to eat and drink, to frequent\r\ntaverns and gamble, to twist cords for the cross-bow, set traps for\r\nferrets and rabbits, and train linnets to whistle\"--men whose idleness\r\nand other vices were so notorious that the expressions, \"He is as idle\r\nas a priest or monk,\" and \"Avaricious and lewd as a priest or monk,\"\r\npassed into proverbs.[109]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aversion to the use of the French language.]\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical teachers themselves so ignorant and corrupt could not be\r\nexpected to do much for the elevation of the laity. Of _popularizing_\r\nknowledge, especially religious knowledge, the clergy and their\r\nadherents had little thought. Latin alone was deemed suitable for the\r\ndiscussion of matters of faith. It was enough to condemn the employment\r\nof French for this purpose, that it could be understood by the people.\r\nFor the reformers was reserved the honor of raising the dialect of the\r\nmasses to the dignity of a language fit for the highest literary uses,\r\nand of compelling even their antagonists to resort to it in\r\nself-defence, though, it must be confessed, with a very poor grace. So\r\nlate as in 1558 we find a leading theologian of the Sorbonne publicly\r\n_apologizing_ for the condescension. \"Very dear friend,\" he writes in\r\nthe address to the reader, \"I doubt not that, at first sight, you will\r\nregard it as strange and perhaps very wrong that this reply is couched\r\nin the vulgar tongue; _seeing that it would be much more suitable were\r\nit circulated in the Latin rather than the French tongue_, inasmuch as\r\nthe subject-matter consists of things greatly concerning Christian\r\nfaith, _which require rather to be put in Latin than in French_. Of this\r\nalso we have the example of the holy ancient doctors, who were always\r\naccustomed to write against heretics in Latin and not in French.\"[110]\r\nIf such was the avowed repugnance to the use of the language of the\r\npeople in the treatment of religious themes, so late as within a year of\r\nthe death of Henry the Second, it may readily be conceived how deep the\r\naversion was a generation earlier, at the first appearance of the\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ignorance of the Holy Scriptures.]\r\n\r\nAs to acquaintance with the contents of the Holy Scriptures, either in\r\nthe original or in translation, there was next to none among the\r\nprofessed teachers of science and religion. If the statements of the\r\ncelebrated scholar and printer, Robert Étienne, or Stephens, seem almost\r\nincredible, they nevertheless come from a witness of unimpeachable\r\nveracity. Referring to the period of his boyhood or early youth--he was\r\nborn in 1503--Étienne sketched the biblical attainments of the doctors\r\nof the Sorbonne after this fashion: \"In those times, as I can affirm\r\nwith truth, when I asked them in what part of the New Testament some\r\nmatter was written, they used to answer that they had read it in Saint\r\nJerome or in the Decretals, but that they did not know what the New\r\nTestament was, not being aware that it was customary to print it after\r\nthe Old. What I am going to state will appear almost a prodigy, and yet\r\nthere is nothing more true nor better proven: Not long since, a member\r\nof their college used daily to say, 'I am amazed that these young people\r\nkeep bringing up the New Testament to us. _I was more than fifty years\r\nold before I knew anything about the New Testament!_'\"[111]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miracles to stimulate the popular faith.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"ghost of Orleans.\"]\r\n\r\nThe absence of teaching founded upon a rational exposition of the Holy\r\nScriptures was not less marked than was the abundance of reported\r\nmiracles, by means of which the popular faith was stimulated and\r\nsustained. Above all, the doctrine of transubstantiation was fortified\r\nby the circulation of stories of wonders such as that which took place\r\nat Poitiers, in 1516, when the consecrated wine, spilled by a crazy man,\r\nfrom white instantly became red.[112] At other times imposture was\r\nresorted to in support of such profitable beliefs as the existence of\r\npurgatorial fires, or to inculcate the advantage accruing from masses\r\nfor the souls of the dead. The \"ghost of Orleans\" has become historic.\r\nThe wife of the provost of the city having died, was buried, as she had\r\nrequested, without any pomp and without the customary gifts to the\r\nchurch. Thereupon the Franciscans conceived the scheme of making use of\r\nher example to warn others against following a course so detrimental to\r\nmonastic and priestly interests. The mysterious knockings by means of\r\nwhich the deceased was supposed to give intimation of her miserable doom\r\nand of her desire that her body, as of one that had been tainted with\r\nheresy, should be removed from the holy ground wherein it had been\r\ninterred, were listened to with amazement by the awe-stricken people.\r\nBut the opportune discovery of a novice, conveniently posted above the\r\nceiling of the convent chapel, sadly interfered with the success of the\r\nwell contrived plot, and eleven monks convicted of complicity in the\r\nfraud were banished the kingdom. They would have been even more severely\r\npunished had not fear been entertained lest the reformers might find too\r\nmuch occasion for triumph.[113]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theatrical effects.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A strange coin.]\r\n\r\nMore excusable were the theatrical effects which were intended, without\r\nactually deceiving, to heighten the religious devotion of worshippers.\r\nThus, every Pentecost or Whit-Sunday, in the midst of the service an\r\nangel was seen to descend from the lofty ceiling of the Sainte Chapelle\r\nin Paris, attended by two smaller angels, and bearing a silver vase\r\ncontaining water for the use of the celebrant of the high mass.[114] For\r\nthis somewhat harmless piece of spectacular display a justification\r\nmight be sought in the religious impressions which the people were\r\nsupposed to derive most easily through the senses; but nothing could be\r\nurged in defence of much that the clergy tolerated or encouraged.\r\nSuperstitions of heathen origin were suffered to reign undisturbed.\r\nPagan statues were openly worshipped. An Isis received homage and was\r\nhonored with burning candles. An Apollo at Polignac was a centre of\r\nreligious veneration, and even the unsavory surroundings, when the spot\r\nwhere it stood was transformed into a stable, could not deter an anxious\r\ncrowd of devotees from prostrating themselves before it.[115] What\r\nbetter could be expected in an age and country in which the people were\r\nimposed upon by reports that prehistoric coins had been discovered\r\nbearing the strange legend: \"I believe in Jesus _to be born_ among\r\nanimals and of a Virgin\"?[116]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indecent processions.]\r\n\r\nIt was not astonishing that the church itself did little to remove the\r\nbarbarism prevailing among the common people, for, in point of fact,\r\nbuffoonery, immodesty, and cruelty had intruded into the very ceremonial\r\nof religion. Never were there more disgusting exhibitions of the low\r\nstate of the public morals than when the occurrence of pestilence,\r\ndrought, or some other signal visitation of the displeasure of heaven\r\ninduced a clergy scarcely less rude than the laity to institute\r\npropitiatory processions. On such occasions children of both sexes, or\r\nperhaps grown men and women, with bare feet, and wearing for their only\r\nclothing a sheet that scarcely concealed their forms, passed through the\r\nstreets of the towns, or wearily trudged from village to village,\r\nresponsively singing the litanies of the Virgin or the saints, and\r\nloudly repeating the refrain, _Ora pro nobis_.[117] Often shameful\r\nindecency and a reckless disregard of human life were displayed. In one\r\nof the villages of Champagne, during the protracted drought of 1556, the\r\nsacred scenes of the Passion were publicly enacted in the streets. The\r\nperson of our Lord was represented by a young man in a state of entire\r\nnudity and bound with cords, who at every step was scourged by his\r\ncompanions, personating the Roman soldiers. The picture was true to\r\nlife, and the blows so far from unreal that the prime actor in the\r\nscandalous performance fell a victim to the inhuman treatment and died\r\nwithin a few days. The fruits of practices so coarse and debasing were\r\nsuch as may easily be conceived.[118]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The monastic orders incur contempt.]\r\n\r\nIt was a lamentable but notorious fact that, as a consequence of the\r\nunnatural divorce of religion and morality, the clergy, both secular and\r\nregular, by their excesses had incurred the contempt of the laity. If\r\nthe Franciscan monks enjoyed an unenviable pre-eminence in this respect,\r\nso as to have come to constitute one of the stock characters in the\r\n\"Heptameron\" and similar works, scarcely less constant than the\r\nprodigals or parasites of the New Comedy, the other orders were but\r\nlittle behind them. And so Louise de Savoie made this significant entry\r\nin her diary: \"In the year 1522, in December, my son and I, by the grace\r\nof the Holy Ghost, began to understand the hypocrites, white, black,\r\ngray, smoky, and of all colors; from whom may God, by his clemency and\r\ninfinite goodness, be pleased to preserve and defend us. For, if Jesus\r\nChrist be not a liar, there is no more dangerous generation in all human\r\nkind.\"[119] Bishops and cardinals won little more respect than the\r\nmonks; for was it not the most prominent of the wearers of the purple\r\nwho, as Chancellor of France, introduced venality into the most sacred\r\noffices of state,[120] while by his quarrelsome and unscrupulous\r\ndiplomacy he richly merited the _bon mot_ of the Emperor Charles the\r\nFifth, that he was more inclined to make _four wars than, one\r\npeace_?[121]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abortive efforts at reform.]\r\n\r\nIt does not enter into the province of this history to discuss in detail\r\nthe causes of the deplorable vices that characterized the priesthood on\r\nthe eve of the great religious movement of the sixteenth century; nor\r\ncan we pause to make that analysis of the doctrinal errors then\r\nprevalent, which belongs rather to the office of the historian of the\r\nReformation. It will be sufficient, therefore, if we glance hastily at\r\nsome of the partial and abortive efforts directed toward the reform of\r\ndoctrine and manners of which mediæval France was the theatre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cathari and Albigenses.]\r\n\r\nForemost among the popular opponents of the papacy were the Cathari and\r\nAlbigenses. The accounts of the origin of the sect or sects bearing\r\nthese names are vague and unsatisfactory, and the reports of their creed\r\nand worship are inconsistent or incredible. The ruin that overwhelmed\r\nthem spared no friendly narrative of their history, and scarcely one\r\nauthoritative exposition of the belief for the profession of which their\r\nadherents encountered death with heroic fortitude. Defeat not only\r\ncompelled the remnants of the Albigenses to succumb to Simon de Montfort\r\nand his fellow crusaders, but reduced them to the indignity of having\r\nthe record of their faith and self-devotion transmitted to posterity\r\nonly in the hostile chronicles of Roman ecclesiastics. But even partisan\r\nanimosity has not robbed the world of the edifying spectacle of a large\r\nnumber of men and women, of a quiet and peaceable disposition,\r\npersistently and fearlessly protesting, through a long series of years,\r\nagainst the worship of saints and images, resisting the innovations of\r\na corrupt church, and adhering with constancy to a simple ritual\r\nunencumbered with superstitious observances. Careful investigation\r\nestablishes the fact that the Holy Scriptures were read and accepted as\r\nthe supreme authority as well in doctrine as in practice, and that the\r\nprecepts there inculcated were adorned by lives so pure and exemplary as\r\nto evoke an involuntary expression of admiration from bitter opponents.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that strange doctrinal errors found a foothold in\r\nparts, at least, of the extensive territory in southern France occupied\r\nby the Albigenses. Oriental Dualism or Manichæism not improbably\r\ndisfigured the creed of portions of the sect; while the belief of others\r\nscarcely differed from that of the less numerous Waldenses of Provence\r\nor their brethren in the valleys of Piedmont. But, whatever may be the\r\ntruth on this much contested point,[122] the remarkable spread of the\r\nAlbigenses during the latter part of the twelfth century must be\r\nregarded as strongly marking the revolt of the French mind, especially\r\nin the more impetuous south, against the priestly absolutism that\r\ncrushed all freedom of religious thought, and equally against a church\r\ntolerating the most flagrant abuses. Nor can the historian who desires\r\nto trace the more remote consequences of important moral movements fail\r\nto notice the singular fact that the soil watered by Albigensian blood\r\nat the beginning of the thirteenth century was precisely that in which\r\nthe seed sown by the reformers, three hundred years later, sprang up\r\nmost rapidly and bore the most abundant harvest. After so long a period\r\nof suspended activity, the spirit of opposition once more asserted its\r\nvital energy--soon, it is true, to meet fresh difficulties, but only\r\nsuch difficulties as would tend to develop and strengthen it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The crime of vauderie.]\r\n\r\nWith the suppression of the Albigenses all open popular protest against\r\nthe errors of the church ceases until the advent of the Reformation. The\r\nlatent tendency did, indeed, manifest its continued existence in those\r\nobscure practices known as _vauderie_, which, distorted by the\r\nimagination of reckless informers and interested judges, and converted\r\ninto the most monstrous crimes against religion and morality, occasioned\r\nthe death of countless innocent victims.[123] But it was chiefly among\r\nthe learned, and particularly in the bosom of the University of Paris,\r\nthat the pressing need of a thorough purification of the church found\r\nexpression. Not that the remedies advocated were so definite and\r\nradical, or based upon so full a recognition of the distinctive\r\ncharacter of Christianity, as to merit the name of reformatory projects.\r\nYet, standing somewhat in advance of their contemporaries, a few\r\ntheologians raised their voices in decided condemnation of those evils\r\nwhich needed only to be held up to public notice to incur the universal\r\nreprobation of mankind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nicholas de Clemangis.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Gerson.]\r\n\r\nNicholas de Clemangis, Rector of the University of Paris, subsequently\r\nprivate secretary of Benedict the Thirteenth at Avignon, and perhaps the\r\nmost elegant writer of his age, drew a startling picture of the wretched\r\nstate of the church at the beginning of the fifteenth century. No writer\r\nhad ever described more vividly the corruption of the convents and\r\nmonasteries, or denounced more unsparingly the unfaithfulness and\r\nimpurity of the parish clergy, and the simony pervading alike all grades\r\nof the hierarchy. His censure was the more effective because he spoke\r\nin sorrow rather than in anger.[124] John Gerson, his contemporary and\r\nfriend, who reached the eminent position of chancellor of the\r\nuniversity, was not less bold in stigmatizing the same evils, while the\r\nweight of his authority was even greater. So far, however, was he from\r\ngrasping the nature and need of a substantial renovation of the existing\r\nreligious belief, that to his influence in no inconsiderable measure was\r\ndue the perfidious condemnation and execution of the great Bohemian\r\nforerunner of the Reformation, John Huss. The student of mediæval\r\nhistory may be inclined to smile at the subtilties of scholastic\r\ndistinctions, but he is also compelled to lament the fact that the death\r\nof a _Realist_ was greeted with demonstrations of evident satisfaction\r\nby a philosopher belonging to the opposite school of the\r\n_Nominalists_.[125]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jean Bouchet's \"Deploration.\"]\r\n\r\nA century elapsed between the time of Nicholas de Clemangis and Gerson\r\nand the almost simultaneous appearance of Ulrich Zwingle in Switzerland\r\nand Martin Luther in Germany. During this long interval of expectation\r\nthe voice of remonstrance was not altogether silent. A few earnest men\r\nrefused to suppress the indignation they felt at the sight of the\r\nimpiety that had invaded the sacred precincts of the church. Among the\r\nlast of those whose words have come down to us was Jean Bouchet, a\r\nnative of Poitiers. In 1512, only five years before the publication of\r\nthe theses of the reformer of Wittemberg, he gave to the world a poem\r\nnot devoid of historical interest, though possessed of little poetic\r\nmerit, entitled \"_La Déploration de l'Église militante_.\"[126] In this\r\nspirited lament it is the church herself that addresses the\r\nhierarchy--pontiff, cardinals, patriarchs, bishops, and others--as well\r\nas kings and secular dignitaries. She complains of the great injuries\r\nand molestations she endures. The practice of simony has converted a\r\ntemple into a loathsome stable. Science and learning are no longer\r\nnecessary for the candidate for ecclesiastical preferment; a hundred\r\ncrowns in hand will serve his purpose much better, no matter how bad his\r\nmoral character may be. As for his qualifications, he is full well\r\nprovided if he can manage the hounds aright and knows how to hunt with\r\nthe falcon. \"Cease,\" cries the church through the poet to the French\r\nprinces, \"cease to load me down with gewgaws, with chalices, crosses,\r\nand sumptuous ornaments. Furnish me instead with virtuous ministers. The\r\nexquisite beauty of abbeys or of silver images is less pleasing in God's\r\nsight than the holy life of good prelates.\"[127] As it is, the dissolute\r\nministers of religion are engrossed in forbidden games, in banquets, and\r\nthe chase. Decked out with flowers, rings, and trinkets, the bishop in\r\nhis dress is more like a soldier or a juggler, than a servant of the\r\nchurch. He recites his prayers reluctantly, while words of profane\r\nswearing flow freely from his lips. From such disorders as these the\r\nchurch invokes her worldly protectors to deliver her.\r\n\r\nThe abuses which Jean Bouchet described, and other abuses of a similar\r\nkind, were so notorious that no intelligent man could close his eyes to\r\nthe evidence of their existence. They had been recited again and again\r\nby more eloquent tongues than that of the poet of Poitiers. Dante and\r\nPetrarch had held them up to immortal contempt. Boccaccio had made them\r\nthe subject of ridicule in his popular stories. But neither remonstrance\r\nnor taunt had effectually abated the prevailing corruption. It remained\r\nthat a new remedy should be tried, and the time for its application was\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: Changes in the boundaries of France during the sixteenth\r\n     century.]\r\n\r\n     It must not be forgotten that the boundaries of France varied\r\n     considerably during the sixteenth century. Thus Artois and\r\n     Flanders, at the accession of Francis the First, were nominally\r\n     fiefs of the French crown, for which Charles of Austria sent to\r\n     France a very honorable embassy, with Henry, Count of Nassau, at\r\n     its head, to do homage to the young prince. It was on this occasion\r\n     that Francis, desirous of gratifying Charles, proposed or consented\r\n     to the marriage of his favorite with Claude de Châlons, daughter of\r\n     the Prince of Orange (Jean de Serres, Inventaire Général de\r\n     l'Histoire de France, 1619, ii. 4, Motley, Dutch Republic, i. 234).\r\n     Eleven years later, January, 1526, by the Treaty of Madrid, Francis\r\n     renounced his suzerainty over the counties of Artois and Flanders,\r\n     as a condition of his release from captivity (Inventaire Général,\r\n     ii. 96). On the other hand, not to speak of the \"Three\r\n     Bishoprics\"--Metz, Toul, and Verdun--definitely incorporated with\r\n     the French dominions in 1552, France had for a longer or shorter\r\n     time possession of the Duchy of Milan, of the island of Corsica,\r\n     and of Piedmont. Not only Bresse, but the very Duchy of Savoy, were\r\n     for years merged in the realm of France, until restored to\r\n     Philibert Emmanuel by the disgraceful Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mignet, Essai sur la formation territoriale et politique de\r\nla France depuis la fin du onzième siècle jusqu'à la fin du quiinzième.\r\nNotices et Mémoires Historiques, ii. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mignet, 157, 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A manuscript chronicle of the time of Charles the Sixth,\r\nquoted by Guizot, Histoire de la Civilisation en France, iv. 144, states\r\nthe interesting fact that the inhabitants of Périgord and the adjoining\r\ndistricts, thus surrendered to Henry the Third of England, for centuries\r\nbore so hearty a grudge against the French king, of whom the rest of\r\nFrance was justly proud, and whose name the church had enrolled in the\r\ncalendar, that they never would consent to regard him as a saint or to\r\ncelebrate his feast day!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"Le quali tutte provincie sono così bene poste,\" etc.\r\nRelazione di Francia dell' Amb.

Among the teachers who, during the\r\nlater years of the reign of Louis the Twelfth, attracted the studious\r\nfrom the most distant parts of Christendom, Jacques Lefèvre, a native of\r\nÉtaples in Picardy, held a high rank for natural ability and extensive\r\nacquirements. It is true that neither his personal appearance nor his\r\nextraction commanded respect: he was diminutive in stature, and he could\r\nboast of no noble blood running in his veins.[128] A more formidable\r\nhinderance in the path to distinction had been the barbarous instruction\r\nhe had received from incompetent masters, both in the inferior schools\r\nand in the university itself. But all obstacles, physical, social, and\r\nintellectual, melted away before the ardor of an extraordinarily active\r\nmind. Rising steadily above the contracted views, the blind respect for\r\nauthority, and the self-satisfied ignorance of the instructors of his\r\nyouth and the colleagues of his manhood and old age, he greeted with\r\ndelight the advent of those liberal ideas which had wrought so wonderful\r\na change in Germany and Italy. A thirst for knowledge even led him, in\r\nimitation of the sages of the early world, to travel to distant parts of\r\nEurope, and, if we may credit the statements of his admiring disciples,\r\nto pursue his investigations into portions of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restores letters to France.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His wide range of study.]\r\n\r\nTo Jacques Lefèvre, of Étaples--better known to foreigners under the\r\nLatin designation of Faber Stapulensis--belongs the honor of restoring\r\nletters to France. His eulogist, Scævola de Sainte-Marthe, has not\r\nexaggerated his merit, when, placing him in the front rank of the\r\nlearned men whom he celebrates, he likens the Picard doctor to a new sun\r\nrising from the Belgian coast to dissipate the fogs and darkness\r\ninvesting his native land and pour upon its youth the full beams of a\r\npurer teaching.[129] Lefèvre confined his attention to no single branch\r\nof learning. He was equally proficient in mathematics, in astronomy, and\r\nin Biblical literature and criticism.[130] Brilliant attainments in so\r\nmany departments were commended yet more to the admiration of beholders\r\nby a modest and unassuming deportment, by morals above reproach, and by\r\na disinterested nature in which there was no taint of avarice. The\r\nsincerity of his unselfish love of knowledge was said to be attested by\r\nthe liberality with which he renounced the entire income of his small\r\npatrimony in favor of his needy relations.[131]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His pupil, Guillaume Farel.]\r\n\r\nEnjoying a reputation for profound and exact learning which had spread\r\nto foreign countries, and admired even by the great humanist Erasmus,\r\nLefèvre had drawn to him a small band of the most promising of the\r\nscholars in attendance upon the university. Prominent among these for\r\nbrilliancy and fiery zeal was a student more than thirty years younger\r\nthan his teacher, Guillaume Farel, destined to fill an important place\r\nin the annals of the French reformation, and to play a leading role in\r\nthe history of Geneva and Neufchâtel. Farel was born in 1489, near Gap,\r\nin Dauphiny, and his childhood was spent at the foot of the Alps.\r\nUnlike Lefèvre, he belonged to a family of considerable importance in\r\nthe provincial nobility. The contrast was still more marked between the\r\nmild and timid professor and the pupil in whose nature courage was so\r\nprominent an element that it often assumed the appearance of imprudent\r\ncontempt of danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devotion of scholar and pupil.]\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of dissimilarity of character, Lefèvre and Farel lived\r\ntogether in close friendship. Together they frequented the churches, and\r\nunited in the pious work, as they regarded it, of decking out with\r\nflowers the pictures of the saints, to whose shrines they made frequent\r\npilgrimages. Lefèvre was scrupulously exact in the performance of his\r\nreligious duties, and was especially punctual in attendance on the mass.\r\nIn his zeal for the church, he had even undertaken as a meritorious task\r\nto compile the lives of the saints whose names appear on the Roman\r\ncalendar, and had actually committed to the press an account of those\r\nwhose feast-days fell within the months of January and February.[132] On\r\nthe other hand, Farel was so sincere an adherent of the current faith,\r\nthat, to employ his own forcible description, he had become \"a very\r\nPantheon, full of intercessors, saviors and gods, of whom his heart\r\nmight have passed for a complete register.\" The papacy had so entrenched\r\nitself in his heart, that even the Pope and papal church _were not so\r\npapal as he_. The man who came to him with the Pope's endorsement\r\nappeared to him like a god, while he would gladly have overwhelmed in\r\nruin the sacrilegious wretch that dared to say a word against the Roman\r\npontiff and his authority.[133]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre's commentary on the Pauline Epistles.]\r\n\r\nBut the enthusiastic devotion of Lefèvre and his more impetuous disciple\r\nto the tenets of the Roman church was to be shaken by a closer study of\r\nthe Scriptures. In 1508 Lefèvre completed a Latin commentary upon the\r\nPsalms.[134] In 1512 he published a commentary in the same language on\r\nthe Pauline Epistles--a work which may indeed fall short of the standard\r\nof criticism established by a subsequent age, but yet contains a clear\r\nenunciation of the doctrine of justification by faith, the cardinal\r\ndoctrine of the Reformation.[135]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foresees the coming reformation.]\r\n\r\nThus, five years before Luther posted his theses on the doors of the\r\nchurch at Wittemberg, Jacques Lefèvre had proclaimed, in no equivocal\r\nterms, his belief in the same great principles. But Lefèvre's lectures\r\nin the college and his written commentary were addressed to the learned.\r\nConsequently they produced no such immediate and startling effect as the\r\nninety-five propositions of the Saxon monk. Lefèvre was not himself to\r\nbe an active instrument in the French reformation. His office was rather\r\nto prepare the way for others--not, perhaps, more sincere, but certainly\r\nmore courageous--to enter upon the hazardous undertaking of attempting\r\nto renovate the church. His faithful disciple, indeed, has preserved for\r\nus a remarkable prophecy, uttered by Lefèvre at the very time when he\r\nwas still assiduous in his devotion to the Virgin Mary and the saints.\r\nGrasping Farel by the hand, the venerable doctor more than once\r\naddressed to him the significant words, which made a deep impression on\r\nthe hearer's mind: \"Guillaume, the world is going to be renewed, and you\r\nwill behold it!\"[136]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Controversy with Beda.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sorbonne's declaration.]\r\n\r\nLefèvre did not intermit his biblical studies. In 1518 he published a\r\nshort treatise on \"the three Marys,\" to prove that Mary the sister of\r\nLazarus, Mary Magdalene, and \"the woman which was a sinner,\" were not\r\none and the same person, according to the common belief of the time.\r\nUnfortunately, the Roman church, by the lessons set down for the\r\nfeast-days, had given its sanction to the prevalent error. Now, the\r\nfears and suspicions of the theologians of the Sorbonne had, during the\r\npast year, been aroused by the fame of Martin Luther's \"heresy,\" and\r\nthey were ready to resent any attempt at innovation, however slight,\r\neither in doctrine or in practice, as evidence of heretical\r\nproclivities. Natalis Beda, the ignorant but pedantic syndic of the\r\ntheological faculty, entered the lists as Lefèvre's opponent, and an\r\nanimated dispute was waged between the friends of the two combatants. Of\r\nso great moment was the decision regarded by Poncher, Bishop of Paris,\r\nthat he induced Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, to write an essay in\r\nrefutation of the views of Lefèvre.[137] But the Sorbonne, not content\r\nwith this, on the ninth of November, 1521, declared that he was a\r\nheretic who should presume to maintain the truth of Lefèvre's\r\nproposition. Lefèvre himself would probably have experienced even\r\ngreater indignities at the hands of parliament--whose members were\r\naccustomed to show excessive respect to the fanatical demands of the\r\nfaculty--had not Guillaume Petit, the king's confessor, induced Francis\r\nto interfere in behalf of the Picard professor.[138]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Briçonnet, Bishop of Meauz.]\r\n\r\nTo these two actors in the drama of the French reformation a third must\r\nnow be added. Guillanme Briçonnet, Bishop of Meaux, stood in the front\r\nrank of aspiring and fortunate churchmen. His father, commonly known as\r\nthe Cardinal of St. Malo, had passed from the civil administration into\r\nthe hierarchy of the Gallican Church. Rewarded for services rendered to\r\nLouis the Eleventh and Charles the Eighth by the gift of the rich abbey\r\nof St. Germain-des-Prés and the archbishopric of Rheims, he had, in\r\nvirtue of his possession of the latter dignity, anointed Louis the\r\nTwelfth at his coronation. As cardinal, he had headed the French party\r\nin the papal consistory, and, more obedient to his sovereign than to the\r\npontiff, when Louis demanded the convocation of a council at Pisa to\r\nresist the encroachments of Julius the Second, the elder Briçonnet left\r\nRome to join in its deliberations, and to face the dangers attending an\r\nopen rupture with the Pope. The cardinal was now dead, having left to\r\nGuillaume, born previously to his father's entrance into orders, a good\r\nmeasure of the royal favor he had himself enjoyed. The younger Briçonnet\r\nhad been successively created Archdeacon of Rheims and Avignon, Abbot of\r\nSt. Germain-des-Prés, and Bishop of Lodève and Meaux. His title of Count\r\nof Montbrun gave him, moreover, a place in the nobility.[139] Meantime a\r\nreformatory tendency had early revealed itself in the efforts made by\r\nthe young ecclesiastic to enforce the observance of canonical discipline\r\nby the luxurious friars of the monastery of St. Germain. Here, too, he\r\nhad tasted the first fruits of the opposition which was before long to\r\ntest his firmness and constancy.\r\n\r\nBriçonnet had been appointed Bishop of Meaux (March 19, 1516) about the\r\nsame time that Francis the First despatched him as special envoy to\r\ntreat with the Pope. It would seem that the intimate acquaintance with\r\nthe papal court gained on this occasion, confirming the impressions made\r\nby a previous diplomatic mission in the time of Louis the Twelfth,\r\nconvinced Briçonnet that the church stood in urgent need of reform; and\r\nhe resolved to begin the work in his own diocese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre and Farel invited to Meaux.]\r\n\r\nWeary of the annoyance and peril arising from the ignorance and malice\r\nof his enemies, the theologians of the Sorbonne, Lefèvre d'Étaples\r\nlonged for a more quiet home, where he might reasonably hope to\r\ncontribute his share to the great renovation descried long since by his\r\nprophetic glance. He was now invited by Briçonnet, to whom his learning\r\nand zeal were well known, to accompany him to Meaux, where, at the\r\ndistance of a little more than a score of miles from the capital, he\r\nwould at least be rid of the perpetual clamor against Luther and his\r\ndoctrines that assailed his ears in Paris.[140] He was accompanied, or\r\nfollowed, to Meaux by his pupil, Farel. Over the views of the latter a\r\nsignal change had come since he entered the university, full of\r\nveneration for the saints, and an enthusiastic supporter of the mass, of\r\nthe papal hierarchy, and of every institution authorized by\r\necclesiastical tradition. After a painful mental struggle, of which he\r\nhas himself given us a graphic account,[141] Farel had been reluctantly\r\nbrought to the startling conviction that the system of which he had been\r\nan enthusiastic advocate was a tissue of falsehoods and an abomination\r\nin God's sight. It required no more than this to bring a man of so\r\nresolute a character to a decision. Partly by his own assiduous\r\napplication to study, especially of the Greek and Hebrew languages and\r\nof the Church Fathers, partly through the influence of Lefèvre, he had\r\nbecome professor of philosophy in the college of the Cardinal Le Moine.\r\nThis advantageous position he resigned, in order that he might be able\r\nto second the labors of Lefèvre in the new field which Bishop Briçonnet\r\nhad thrown open to him. Other pupils or friends of the Picard doctor\r\nfollowed--Michel d'Arande, Gérard Roussel, and others, all more or less\r\nthoroughly imbued with the same sentiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king's mother and sister encourage the preaching of the\r\nreformers.]\r\n\r\nA new era had now dawned upon the neglected diocese of Meaux. Bishop\r\nBriçonnet was fully possessed by his new-born zeal. The king's mother\r\nand his only sister had honored him with a visit not long after\r\nLefèvre's arrival,[142] and had left him confident that in his projected\r\nreforms, and especially in the introduction of the preaching of the Word\r\nof God, he might count upon their powerful support. \"I assure you,\"\r\nMargaret of Angoulême wrote him a month later, \"that the king and madame\r\nare entirely decided to let it be understood that the truth of God is\r\nnot heresy.\"[143] And a few weeks later the same princely correspondent\r\ndeclared that her mother and brother were \"more intent than ever upon\r\nthe reformation of the church.\"[144] With such flattering prospects the\r\nreformation opened at Meaux.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immediate results.]\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1521, when the ardent friends of religious progress made\r\ntheir appearance in the city, the pulpits, rarely entered by the curates\r\nor by the mendicant monks unless to demand a fresh contribution of\r\nmoney, were filled with zealous preachers. The latter expounded the\r\nGospel, in place of rehearsing the stories of the \"Golden Legend;\" and\r\nthe people, at first attracted by the novelty of the sound, were soon\r\nenamored of the doctrines proclaimed. These doctrines stood, indeed, in\r\nsignal opposition to those of the Roman church. By slow but sure steps\r\nthe advocates of the Reformation had come to assume a position scarcely\r\nless unequivocal than that of Luther in Germany. In 1514, two years\r\nafter the publication of the commentary in which he had clearly\r\nenunciated the Protestant doctrine on one cardinal point, Lefèvre would\r\nseem still to have been unsurpassed in his devotion to pictures and\r\nimages.[145] Two years later he was regarded by Luther as strangely\r\ndeficient in a clear apprehension of spiritual truths which,\r\nnevertheless, he fully exemplified in a life of singular spirituality\r\nand sincerity.[146] And it was not until 1519 that, by the arguments of\r\nhis own pupil, Farel, he was convinced of the impropriety of\r\nsaint-worship and of prayers for the dead.[147] But now there could be\r\nno doubt respecting Lefèvre's attitude. Placed by Bishop Briçonnet in\r\ncharge of the \"Léproserie,\" and subsequently entrusted with the powers\r\nof vicar-general over the entire diocese,[148] he exerted an influence\r\nnot hard to trace. A contemporary, when chronicling, a few years later,\r\nthat \"the greater part of Meaux was infected with the false doctrines of\r\nLuther,\" made the cause of all the trouble to be one Fabry (Lefèvre), a\r\npriest and scholar, who rejected pictures from the churches, forbade the\r\nuse of holy water for the dead, and denied the existence of\r\npurgatory.[149]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gérard Roussel and Mazurier.]\r\n\r\nThe mystic Gérard Roussel, an eloquent speaker, whom the bishop\r\nappointed curate of St. Saintin, and subsequently treasurer and canon of\r\nthe cathedral, was prominent among the new preachers, but was surpassed\r\nin exuberant display of zeal by Martial Mazurier, Principal of the\r\nCollége de St. Michel in Paris, who now fulfilled the functions of\r\ncurate of the church of St. Martin at Meaux.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apprehension of the monks aroused.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De Roma's threat.]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the apprehension of the monastic orders was\r\naroused by the great popularity of the new teachers. The wool-carders,\r\nweavers, and fullers accepted the novel doctrine with delight as meeting\r\na want which they had discovered in spite of poverty and ignorance. The\r\nday-laborers frequenting the neighborhood of Meaux, to aid the farmers\r\nin harvest-time, carried back to their more secluded districts the\r\nconvictions they had obtained, and themselves became efficient agents in\r\nthe promulgation of the faith elsewhere. If the anticipations of a\r\nspeedy spread of the reformation throughout France were brilliant in the\r\nminds of its early apostles, the determination of its opponents was\r\nequally fixed. An incident occurred about this time which might almost\r\nbe regarded as of prophetic import. Farel, who was present, is our sole\r\ninformant. On one occasion Lefèvre and a few friends were engaged in\r\nconversation with some warm partisans of the old abuses, when the old\r\ndoctor, warming at the prospect he seemed to behold, exclaimed, \"Already\r\nthe Gospel is winning the hearts of the nobles and of the common people\r\nalike! Soon it will spread over all France, and cast down the inventions\r\nwhich the hand of man has set up.\" \"Then,\" angrily retorted one De Roma,\r\na Dominican monk, \"Then I, and others like me, will join in preaching a\r\ncrusade; and should the king tolerate the proclamation of the Gospel, we\r\nshall drive him from his kingdom by means of his own subjects!\"[150]\r\n\r\nThe Dominican friar stood forth at that moment the embodiment of the\r\nmonastic spirit speaking defiance to the nascent reform. The church of\r\nthe state, with its rich abbeys and priories, its glorious old\r\ncathedrals, and boundless possessions of lands and houses, was not to be\r\nresigned without a struggle so terrific as to shake the foundations of\r\nthe throne itself. The germ of the Guises and the League, with Jacques\r\nClément and Ravaillac, was already formed, and possessed a prodigious\r\nlatent vitality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Briçonnet's activity.]\r\n\r\nBishop Briçonnet was himself active in promoting the evangelical work,\r\npreaching against the most flagrant abuses, and commending to the\r\nconfidence of his flock the more eloquent preachers whom he had\r\nintroduced. The incredible rumor even gained currency that the\r\nhot-headed prelate went through his diocese casting down the images and\r\nsparing no object of idolatrous worship in the churches.[151] But,\r\nhowever improbable it may be that Briçonnet ever engaged in any such\r\niconoclastic demonstrations, it is a strong Roman Catholic partisan who\r\nhas preserved the record of this significant warning given by the\r\nprelate to his flock, and elicited either by the consciousness of his\r\nown moral feebleness, or by a certain vague premonition of danger: \"Even\r\nshould I, your bishop, change my speech and teaching, beware that you\r\nchange not with me!\"[152]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre translates the New Testament.]\r\n\r\nUnder Briçonnet's protection Jacques Lefèvre assumed a task less\r\nrestricted in its influence than preaching, in which he probably took a\r\nless active part than his coadjutors. The Bible was a closed book to the\r\ncommon people in France. The learned might familiarize themselves with\r\nits contents by a perusal of the Latin Vulgate; but readers acquainted\r\nwith their mother tongue alone were reduced to the necessity of using a\r\nrude version wherein text and gloss were mingled in inextricable\r\nconfusion, and the Scriptures were made to countenance the most absurd\r\nabuses.[153] The best furnished libraries rarely contained more than a\r\nfew detached books of the Bible, and these intended for ornament rather\r\nthan use.[154] Lefèvre resolved, therefore, to apply himself to the\r\ntranslation of the Sacred Scriptures from the Latin Vulgate into the\r\nFrench language. In June, 1523, he published a version of the four\r\ngospels, and in the autumn of the same year he gave to the world the\r\nrest of the New Testament. Five years later he added a translation of\r\nthe Old Testament. It was a magnificent undertaking, prompted by a\r\nfervent desire to promote the spiritual interests of his countrymen. In\r\nits execution, the inaccuracies incident to so novel an enterprise, and\r\nthe comparative harshness of the style, can readily be forgiven. For,\r\naside from its own merits, the version of Lefèvre d'Étaples formed the\r\nbasis for the subsequent version of Robert Olivetanus, itself the\r\ngroundwork of many later translations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The translation eagerly bought.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delight of Lefèvre.]\r\n\r\nLefèvre and his associates had not erred in anticipating remarkable\r\nresults from the publication of the Scriptures in the language of the\r\npeople. The copies of the New Testament no sooner left the press than\r\nthey were eagerly bought. They penetrated into obscure hamlets to which\r\nno missionary of the \"new doctrines\" could find access. By the\r\nwool-carders of Meaux the prize thus unexpectedly placed within reach\r\nwas particularly valued. The liberality of Bishop Briçonnet is said to\r\nhave freely supplied copies to those who were too poor to afford the\r\npurchase-money. The prelate introduced the French Scriptures into the\r\nchurches of Meaux, where the unparalleled innovation of reading the\r\nlessons in an intelligible tongue struck the people with amazement. \"You\r\ncan scarcely imagine,\" wrote the delighted Lefèvre to a distant\r\nfriend,[155] \"with what ardor God is moving the minds of the simple, in\r\nsome places, to embrace His word since the books of the New Testament\r\nhave been published in French, though you will justly lament that they\r\nhave not been scattered more widely among the people. The attempt has\r\nbeen made to hinder the work, under cover of the authority of\r\nparliament; but our most generous king has become in this matter the\r\ndefender of Christ's cause, declaring it to be his pleasure that his\r\nkingdom shall hear the word of God freely and without hinderance in the\r\nlanguage which it understands. At present, throughout our entire\r\ndiocese, on feast-days, and especially on Sunday, both the epistle and\r\ngospel are read to the people in the vernacular tongue, and the parish\r\npriest adds a word of exhortation to the epistle or gospel, or both, at\r\nhis discretion.\"\r\n\r\nThere did, indeed, seem to be amply sufficient ground for the\r\n\"exultation\" expressed by the worthy Picard at the rapid progress of the\r\nReformation throughout Europe and the flattering prospects offered in\r\nFrance itself.[156] Everything seemed for a time to promise success at\r\nMeaux. Bishop Briçonnet received with delight the advice of the Swiss\r\nand German reformers. The letters of Oecolampadius, from Basle, in\r\nparticular so deeply impressed him, that he commissioned Gérard Roussel\r\nto read in the French language and explain the meaning of the Pauline\r\nEpistles every morning to a promiscuous gathering of persons of both\r\nsexes, and chose out the most evangelical preachers to perform similar\r\nduty in all the more important places in his diocese.[157]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enmity of the Franciscans.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of Bishop Briçonnet.]\r\n\r\nBut the bishop had excited the active enmity of a resolute and\r\nsuspicious foe. In forbidding the Franciscan monks entrance to any\r\npulpit within his jurisdiction, he had, even before the advent of\r\nLefèvre and the reformed teachers, incurred their violent\r\nanimosity.[158] The new movement, while arousing their indignation, gave\r\nthem the opportunity they coveted for invoking the power of the\r\nuniversity and of parliament. At first the bishop was bold enough to\r\ndenounce the doctors of the Sorbonne as Pharisees and false\r\nprophets,[159] while in his private correspondence he stigmatized the\r\nclergy as \"the estate _by the coldness of which all the others are\r\nfrozen_,\"[160] or even as \"_that which is the ruin of all the\r\nrest_.\"[161] But, frightened by the incessant clamor and attacks of his\r\nenemies, he began gradually to waver, and presently lost all courage. In\r\nthe end he yielded so far as to suffer to be published in his name\r\nofficial documents which were intended to overturn from the foundation\r\nthe very fabric he had been striving to rear. In one of these, a\r\n\"Synodal Decree\" addressed to the faithful of his diocese, the bishop\r\nwas made to condemn the books of Martin Luther, and to denounce Luther\r\nhimself as one who was plotting the overthrow of \"the estate which\r\n_keeps all the rest in the path of duty_.\"[162] Quite another\r\ndescription of the clergy this from either of the descriptions which he\r\ngave to Margaret of Angoulême! The other document was a letter to the\r\nclergy of his diocese, warning them against certain preachers \"brought\r\nin by himself to share his pastoral cares,\" who, under cover of\r\nproclaiming the Gospel, had \"dared, in defiance of the evangelical\r\ntruth, to preach that purgatory does not exist, and that, consequently,\r\nwe must not pray for the dead, nor invoke the very holy Virgin Mary and\r\nthe saints.\"[163]\r\n\r\nThe precise time of Briçonnet's pusillanimous defection, as marked by\r\nthe publication of these pastoral letters, is involved in some\r\nobscurity; for assuredly the date affixed to the transcripts that have\r\ncome down to us conflicts too seriously with the well-known facts of\r\nhistory to be accepted as correct.[164]\r\n\r\nLater Roman Catholic historians have asserted that the act was a\r\nvoluntary one; that Briçonnet had never in reality sympathized with the\r\nreligious views of reformers whom he had invited to Meaux simply because\r\nof his admiration for learning; that no sooner did he discover the\r\nheretical nature of their teachings than he removed them from the posts\r\nto which they had been assigned; and that he spent the residue of his\r\nlife in the vain endeavor to retrieve the fatal consequences of his\r\nmistake.[165] But this view is confirmed by nothing in the prelate's\r\nextant correspondence. Everywhere there is evidence that until his\r\ncourage broke down, Briçonnet was in full accord with the reformers.\r\nHis first step may possibly have been justified at the bar of conscience\r\nby the plausible suggestion that, since the anger of the Sorbonne had\r\nbeen directed specially against Meaux, the evangelical preachers could\r\nbe more serviceable elsewhere. But, from the mere withdrawal of support\r\nto positive measures of repression, the transition was both natural and\r\nspeedy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is cited to appear before the Parliament.]\r\n\r\nUnsatisfied by Bishop Briçonnet's merely negative course, the Parliament\r\nof Paris at length cited him to appear and answer before a commission\r\nconsisting of two of its own counsellors. The information thus obtained\r\nwas next to be submitted to the judges delegated by the Pope, a tribunal\r\nof the institution of which an account will be given in another\r\nchapter.[166] To this secret investigation Briçonnet objected, and\r\nbegged to be tried in open court by the entire body of parliament;[167]\r\nbut his petition was rejected, and his examination proceeded before the\r\ninquisitorial commission. What measures were there taken to influence\r\nhim is not known. To Martial Mazurier, lately an enthusiastic preacher\r\nof the \"Lutheran\" doctrines, who had himself, through fear, receded from\r\nhis advanced position, the doubtful honor is ascribed of having been\r\nprominent in exertions to overcome the prelate's lingering scruples.\r\nHowever this may be, when Briçonnet had given sufficient guarantees to\r\nsatisfy the Sorbonne that no apprehension need be entertained of a\r\nrepetition in Meaux of the dangerous experiment of the public\r\ninstruction of the people in the Holy Scriptures, there was nothing to\r\nbe gained by his condemnation. He was accordingly acquitted of all\r\ncharge of heresy, although condemned to pay the sum of two hundred\r\nlivres as the expense of bringing to trial the \"heretics\" whom he had\r\nhimself helped to make such.[168] Hereupon he is said to have returned\r\nto his diocese, and, having convened a synod, to have prohibited, as we\r\nhave seen, the circulation of Luther's writings, reintroduced the\r\necclesiastical practices that had been condemned or discarded, and given\r\nto the persecution now set on foot his unequivocal sanction.[169]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispersion of the reformed teachers.]\r\n\r\nThe teachers whom Briçonnet had so cordially invited to assist him were\r\ncompelled one by one to abandon Meaux. Among the earliest to leave was\r\nFarel.[170] His was no faint heart. If he gave up his activity in Brie,\r\nit was only to return to his native Dauphiny, where a young nobleman,\r\nAnemond de Coct, and a preacher, Pierre de Sebeville, were among the\r\nleading men whose conversion was the fruit of his indefatigable\r\nexertions. After a visit to Guyenne, of which little is known, he passed\r\ninto German Switzerland, and labored successively in Basle, Strasbourg,\r\nand Montbéliard.[171]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Annoyances of those who remain.]\r\n\r\nLefèvre and Roussel were among the last to withdraw; but, beset with\r\nwatchful enemies, they found their position neither safe nor\r\ncomfortable. It was as difficult to maintain a semblance of friendship\r\nwith an ecclesiastical system which they detested in their hearts, as to\r\nrefuse their sympathy and support to the persecuted whose opinions they\r\nshared without possessing the courage necessary to suffer in attestation\r\nof the common faith. Busy informers at one time found evidence, more\r\nthan warranting the suspicion that Roussel's manuscripts had furnished\r\nthe material of which scandalous placards defamatory of the Pope were\r\nframed.[172] A little later the proctor of the cathedral drew attention\r\nto the irregular conventicles held in the church itself, every Sunday\r\nand feast-day, after Roussel had preached. These \"combers, carders, and\r\nother persons of the same stamp, unlettered folk,\"[173] brought with\r\nthem books containing the Epistles of St. Paul, the Gospels, and the\r\nPsalms, in flagrant disregard of the prohibitions they had heard\r\nrespecting the discussion of such topics as faith, the sacraments, the\r\nprivileges of Rome, and the use of pictures in the churches. It was made\r\nthe occasion of \"charitable rebuke\" and then of formal complaint against\r\nRoussel by his fellow canons, that he failed to repeat the angelic\r\nsalutation, according to the orthodox practice, after the exordium of\r\nhis sermon. To the combined exhortations and threats of his accusers\r\nRoussel replied in the chapter that, if he had done wrong, it belonged\r\nto the bishop to reprove him, but that as to himself he esteemed the\r\nrepetition of the Lord's Prayer quite as efficacious as the recital of\r\nthe Ave Maria.[174]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre and Roussel take refuge in Strasbourg.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excessive caution of Roussel.]\r\n\r\nAt last danger thickened, and Lefèvre and Roussel found themselves\r\nforced to leave Meaux (October, 1525), and sought refuge within the\r\nhospitable walls of Strasbourg; for the persecuting measures adopted by\r\nthe regent, Louise de Savoie, and the Parliament of Paris, during the\r\nking's captivity, as we shall shortly see, had placed the lives of even\r\nsuch prudent reformers in peril.[175] In the free city on the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, Lefèvre met his pupil Farel, and in the midst of cordial\r\ngreetings was reminded by him that the day of \"renovation\" which he had\r\nlong since predicted and desired had really come.[176] But the contrast\r\nbetween the two men had become sharply drawn. The fearless athlete, soon\r\nto measure his strength with no puny antagonists at Neufchâtel,\r\nLausanne, Geneva, and so many other places in French Switzerland, whose\r\ncourse was to be a succession of rough encounters, discovered that the\r\nmaster from whom he had received the impulse that shaped his entire\r\nlife, shrank from sundering the last link binding him to the Roman\r\nchurch. And Gérard Roussel was even more timid. The elegant preacher,\r\nwith fair prospects of preferment, could not bring himself openly to\r\nespouse the quarrel of oppressed truth. A mysticism investing his entire\r\nbelief, and perverting his moral perceptions, led him to imagine that\r\nthe heart might be kept pure in the midst of many external corruptions,\r\nand that the enlightened could worship the Almighty acceptably in spite\r\nof superstitious observances, which, while countenancing by apparent\r\nacquiescence, they rejected in their hearts. The excellence of the\r\nreformation already inaugurated at Strasbourg made a deep and very\r\nfavorable impression upon Roussel. He wrote to Bishop Briçonnet that the\r\ndaily preaching of a pure doctrine, \"without dross or leaven of the\r\nPharisees,\"[177] the crowds of attentive hearers, the schools presided\r\nover by men as illustrious for piety as for letters, and the careful\r\nprovision for the poor, would delight his correspondent were he to see\r\nthem. He did not dissemble his own great satisfaction that the\r\nmonasteries had been changed into educational establishments, the\r\npictures taken away from the churches, and every altar removed except\r\none, on which the communion was celebrated, as nearly as possible,\r\naccording to the plan of its institution.[178] At the same time he\r\nrenounced none of his excessive caution. His words were still those he\r\nhad uttered when urged, a twelvemonth earlier, by Farel,\r\nOecolampadius, and Zwingle, to strike out boldly and by an open\r\ndispute on religion compel the attention of the thoughtless world. \"The\r\nflesh is weak! As my friends, Lefèvre and others, urge, the convenient\r\nseason has not yet come, the Gospel has not yet been scattered\r\nsufficiently far and wide. We must not assume the Lord's prerogative for\r\nsending laborers into the harvest, but leave the work to Him whose it\r\nis, and who can easily raise up a far richer harvest than that for whose\r\nsafety we are solicitous!\"[179]\r\n\r\nSuch were the paltry evasions of cowardly souls, to excuse themselves\r\nfor the neglect of admitted duty. We cannot wonder at the burning words\r\nof condemnation which this pusillanimity called forth from the pen of\r\nbrave Pierre Toussain. \"I have spoken to Lefèvre and Roussel,\" he wrote\r\nsome months later, \"but certainly Lefèvre has not a particle of courage.\r\nMay God confirm and strengthen him! Let them be as wise as they please,\r\nlet them wait, procrastinate, and dissemble; the Gospel will never be\r\npreached without the _cross_! When I see these things, when I see the\r\nmind of the king, the mind of the duchess [Margaret of Angoulême] as\r\nfavorable as possible to the advancement of the Gospel of Christ, and\r\nthose who ought to forward this matter, according to the grace given\r\nthem, obstructing their design, I cannot refrain from tears. They say,\r\nindeed: 'It is not yet time, the hour has not come!' And yet we have\r\nhere no day or hour. _What would not you do had you the Emperor and\r\nFerdinand favoring your attempts?_ Entreat God, therefore, in behalf of\r\nFrance, that she may at length be worthy of His word.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the task imposed on the weak Bishop of Meaux and his\r\nnew allies, the monks of St. Francis, proved a more difficult\r\nundertaking. The shepherds had been dispersed, but the flock refused to\r\nforsake the fold. From the nourishing food they had discovered in the\r\nWord of God, they could not be induced to return to the husks offered to\r\nthem in meaningless ceremonies, celebrated in an unknown tongue by men\r\nof impure lives. The Gospels in French remained more attractive than\r\nthe legendary, even after the bishop had abandoned the championship of\r\nthe incipient reformation. Briçonnet's own expressed wish was granted:\r\nif he had \"changed his speech and teaching,\" the common people, at\r\nleast, had not changed with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The wool-carder, Jean Leclerc, tears down a papal bull.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His barbarous sentence.]\r\n\r\nAmong the first fruits of the Reformation in Meaux was a wool-carder,\r\nJean Leclerc, into whose hands had fallen one of Lefèvre's French\r\nTestaments. He was a man of strong convictions and invincible\r\nresolution. A bull, issued by Clement the Seventh in connection with the\r\napproaching jubilee, had been posted on the doors of the cathedral\r\n(December, 1524). It offered indulgence, and enjoined prayers, fasting,\r\nand partaking of the Communion, in order to obtain from heaven the\r\nrestoration of peace between princes of Christendom. Leclerc secretly\r\ntore the bull down, substituting for it a placard in which the Roman\r\npontiff figured as veritable Antichrist. Diligent search was at once\r\ninstituted for the perpetrator of this offence, and for the author of\r\nthe subsequent mutilation of the prayers to the Virgin hung up in\r\nvarious parts of the same edifice. A truculent order was also issued in\r\nthe bishop's name, threatening all persons that might conceal their\r\nknowledge of the culprits with public excommunication, every Sunday and\r\nfeast-day, \"with ringing of bells and with candles lighted and then\r\nextinguished and thrown upon the earth, _in token of eternal\r\nmalediction_.\"[181] Leclerc was discovered, and taken to Paris for\r\ntrial. The barbarous sentence of parliament was, that he be whipped in\r\nParis by the common executioner on three successive days, then\r\ntransferred to Meaux to receive the like punishment, and finally branded\r\non the forehead with a red-hot iron, before being banished forever from\r\nthe kingdom.[182]\r\n\r\nThe cruel prescription was followed out to the letter (March, 1525). A\r\nsuperstitious multitude flocked together to see and gloat over the\r\ncondign punishment of a heretic, and gave no word of encouragement and\r\nsupport. But, as the iron was leaving on Leclerc's brow the ignominious\r\nimprint of the _fleur-de-lis_,[183] a single voice suddenly broke in\r\nupon the silence. It was that of his aged mother, who, after an\r\ninvoluntary cry of anguish, quickly recovered herself and shouted, \"Hail\r\nJesus Christ and his standard-bearers!\"[184] Although many heard her\r\nwords, so deep was the impression, that no attempt was made to lay hands\r\nupon her.[185]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is burned alive at Metz.]\r\n\r\nFrom Meaux, Leclerc, forced to leave his home, retired first to Rosoy,\r\nand thence to Metz.[186] Here, while supporting himself by working at\r\nhis humble trade, he lost none of his missionary spirit. Not content\r\nwith communicating a knowledge of the doctrines of the Reformation to\r\nall with whom he conversed, his impatient zeal led him to a new and\r\nstartling protest against the prevalent, and, in his view, idolatrous\r\nworship of images. Learning that on a certain day a solemn procession\r\nwas to be made to a shrine situated a few miles out of the city gates,\r\nhe went to the spot under cover of night, and hurled the sacred images\r\nfrom their places. On the morrow the horrified worshippers found the\r\nobjects of their devotion prostrated and mutilated, and their rage knew\r\nno bounds. It was not long before the wool-carder was apprehended. His\r\nreligious sentiments were no secret, and he had been seen returning from\r\nthe scene of his nocturnal exploit. He promptly acknowledged his guilt,\r\nand was rescued from the infuriated populace only to undergo a more\r\nterrible doom at the hands of the public executioner (July 22, 1525).\r\nHis right hand was cut off at the wrist, his arms, his nose, his breast\r\nwere cruelly torn with pincers; but no cry of anguish escaped the lips\r\nof Leclerc. The sentence provided still further that, before his body\r\nshould be consigned to the flames, his head be encircled with a red-hot\r\nband of iron. As the fervent metal slowly ate its way toward his very\r\nbrain, the bystanders with amazement heard the dying man calmly repeat\r\nthe words of Holy Writ: \"Their idols are silver and gold, the work of\r\nmen's hands.\" He had not completed the Psalmist's terrific denunciation\r\nof the crime and folly of image-worship when his voice was stifled by\r\nthe fire and smoke of the pyre into which his impatient tormentors had\r\nhastily thrown him. If not actually the first martyr of the French\r\nReformation, as has commonly been supposed, Jean Leclerc deserves, at\r\nleast, to rank among the most constant and unswerving of its early\r\napostles.[187]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jacques Pauvan.]\r\n\r\nThe poor wool-carder of Meaux was succeeded by more illustrious victims.\r\nOne was of the number of the teachers who had been attracted to Bishop\r\nBriçonnet's diocese by the prospect of contributing to the progress of a\r\npurer doctrine. Jacques Pauvan[188] was a studious youth who had come\r\nfrom Boulogne, in Picardy, to perfect his education in the university,\r\nand had subsequently abandoned a career in which he bade fair to obtain\r\ndistinction, in order to assist his admired teacher, Lefèvre, at Meaux.\r\nHe was an outspoken man, and disguised his opinions on no point of the\r\nprevailing controversy. He asserted that purgatory had no existence, and\r\nthat God had no vicar. He repudiated excessive reliance on the doctors\r\nof the church. He indignantly rejected the customary salutation to the\r\nVirgin Mary, \"Hail Queen, Mother of mercy!\" He denied the propriety of\r\noffering candles to the saints. He maintained that baptism was only a\r\nsign, that holy water was _nothing_, that papal bulls and indulgences\r\nwere an imposture of the devil, and that the mass was not only of no\r\navail for the remission of sins, but utterly unprofitable to the hearer,\r\nwhile the Word of God was all-sufficient.[189]\r\n\r\nPauvan was put under arrest, and his theses, together with the defence\r\nof their contents which one Matthieu Saunier was so bold as to write,\r\nwere submitted to the Sorbonne. Its condemnation was not long withheld.\r\n\"A work,\" said the Paris theologians, \"containing propositions extracted\r\nand compiled from the pernicious errors of the Waldenses, Wickliffites,\r\nBohemians, and Lutherans, being impious, scandalous, schismatic, and\r\nwholly alien from the Christian doctrine, ought publicly to be consigned\r\nto the flames in the diocese of Meaux, whence it emanated. And Jacques\r\nPauvan and Matthieu Saunier should, by all judicial means, be compelled\r\nto make a public recantation.\"[190]\r\n\r\nEven strong men have their moments of weakness. Pauvan was no exception\r\nto the rule. Besides the terrors of the stake, the persuasions of\r\nMartial Mazurier came in to shake his constancy. This latter, a doctor\r\nof theology, had at one time been so carried away with the desire of\r\ninnovation as to hurl down a statue of their patron saint standing at\r\nthe door of the monastery of the Franciscans. He had now, as we have\r\nalready seen, become the favorite instrument in effecting abjurations\r\nsimilar to his own. His suggestions prevailed over Pauvan's\r\nconvictions.[191] The young scholar consented to obey the Sorbonne's\r\ndemand. The faculty's judgment had been pronounced on the ninth of\r\nDecember, 1525; a fortnight later, on the morrow of Christmas day--a\r\nfavorite time for striking displays of this kind--Pauvan publicly\r\nretracted his \"errors,\" and made the usual \"amende honorable,\" clad only\r\nin a shirt, and holding a lighted taper in his hand.[192]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is burned on the Place de Grève.]\r\n\r\nIf Pauvan's submission secured him any peace, it was a short-lived\r\npeace. Tortured by conscience, he soon betrayed his mental anguish by\r\nsighs and groans. Again he was drawn from the prison, where he had been\r\nconfined since his abjuration,[193] and subjected to new\r\ninterrogatories. With the opportunity to vindicate his convictions, his\r\ncourage and cheerfulness returned. As a relapsed heretic, no fate could\r\nbe in store for him but death at the stake, and this he courageously met\r\non the _Place de Grève_.[194] But the holocaust was inauspicious for\r\nthose who with this victim hoped to annihilate the \"new doctrines.\"\r\nBefore mounting the huge pyre heaped up to receive him, Pauvan was\r\nthoughtlessly permitted to speak; and so persuasive were his words that\r\nit was an enemy's exclamation that \"it had been better to have cost the\r\nchurch a million of gold, than that Pauvan had been suffered to speak to\r\nthe people.\"[195]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hermit of Livry.]\r\n\r\nScarcely more encouraging to the advocates of persecution was the scene\r\nin the area in front of Notre-Dame de Paris, when, at the sound of the\r\ngreat cathedral bell, an immense crowd was gathered to witness the\r\nexecution of an obscure person, known to us only as \"the hermit of\r\nLivry\"--a hamlet on the road to Meaux. With such unshaken fortitude did\r\nhe encounter the flames, that the astonished spectators were confidently\r\nassured by their spiritual advisers that he was one of the damned who\r\nwas being led to the fires of hell.[196]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bishop Briçonnet becomes the jailer of the \"Lutherans.\"]\r\n\r\nWhere less rigor was deemed necessary, the penalty for having embraced\r\nthe reformed tenets was reduced to imprisonment for a term of years,\r\noften with bread and water for the only food and drink. The place of\r\nconfinement was sometimes a monastery, at other times the \"_prisons of\r\nMonseigneur the Bishop of Meaux_.\"[197] Thus Briçonnet enjoyed the rare\r\nand exquisite privilege of acting as jailer of unfortunates instructed\r\nby himself in the doctrines for the profession of which they now\r\nsuffered! Meantime their companions having escaped detection, although\r\ndeprived of the advantage of public worship, continued for years to\r\nassemble for mutual encouragement and edification, as they had\r\nopportunity, in private houses, in retired valleys or caverns, or in\r\nthickets and woods. Their minister was that person of their own number\r\nwho was seen to be the best versed in the Holy Scriptures. After he had\r\ndischarged his functions in the humble service, by a simple address of\r\ninstruction or exhortation, the entire company with one voice\r\nsupplicated the Almighty for His blessing, and returned to their homes\r\nwith fervent hopes for the speedy conversion of France to the\r\nGospel.[198] Thus matters stood for about a score of years, until a\r\nfresh attempt was made to constitute a reformed church at Meaux, the\r\nsignal, as will appear in the sequel, for a fresh storm of persecution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre's subsequent history.]\r\n\r\nA few words here seem necessary respecting the subsequent fortunes of\r\nthe venerable teacher whose name at this point fades from the history of\r\nthe French Reformation. The action of parliament (August 28, 1525), in\r\ncondemning, at the instigation of the syndic of the theological faculty,\r\nnine propositions extracted from his commentary on the Gospels, and in\r\nforbidding the circulation of his translation of the Holy Scriptures,\r\nhad given Lefèvre d'Étaples due warning of danger. We have already seen\r\nthat a few weeks later (October, 1525) he had taken refuge in Strasbourg\r\nunder the pseudonym of Antonius Peregrinus. But the _incognito_ of so\r\ndistinguished a stranger could not be long maintained, and before many\r\ndays the very boys in the streets knew him by his true name.[199]\r\nMeantime the Sorbonne, in his absence, proceeded to censure a large\r\nnumber of propositions drawn from another of Lefèvre's works. Shortly\r\nafter a letter was received from Francis the First, written in his\r\ncaptivity at Madrid, and enjoining the court to suspend its vexatious\r\npersecution of a man \"of such great and good renown, and of so holy a\r\nlife,\" until the king's return. The refractory judges, however,\r\nneglected to obey the order, and continued the proceedings instituted\r\nagainst Lefèvre.[200]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre and the Nuncio Aleander.]\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Francis succeeded in regaining his liberty, a year later,\r\nhe not only recalled Lefèvre and his companion, Roussel, from exile, but\r\nconferred upon the former the honorable appointment of tutor to his two\r\ndaughters and his third and favorite son, subsequently known as Charles,\r\nDuke of Orleans.[201] This post, while it enabled him to continue the\r\nprosecution of his biblical studies, also gave him the opportunity of\r\ninstilling into the minds of his pupils some views favorable to the\r\nReformation.[202] A little later Margaret of Angoulême secured for\r\nLefèvre the position of librarian of the royal collection of books at\r\nBlois; but, as even here he was subjected to much annoyance from his\r\nenemies, Margaret, now Queen of Navarre, sought and obtained from her\r\nbrother permission to take the old scholar with her to Nérac, in\r\nGascony.[203] Here, in the ordinary residence of his patron, and treated\r\nby the King of Navarre with marked consideration, Lefèvre d'Étaples was\r\nat last safe from molestation. The papal party did not, indeed, despair\r\nof gaining him over. The Nuncio Aleander, in a singular letter exhumed\r\nnot long since from the Vatican records, expressed himself strongly in\r\nfavor of putting forth the effort. Lefèvre's \"few errors\" had at first\r\nappeared to be of great moment, because published at a time when to\r\ncorrect or change the most insignificant syllable, or a faulty\r\nrendering, in the ancient translations of the Holy Scriptures approved\r\nby the church, was an unheard-of innovation. But, now that more\r\nimportant questions had come up to arrest attention, the mere matter of\r\nretranslation, without introducing unsound doctrine, seemed to be a\r\nthing of little or no consequence.[204] Let Lefèvre but leave the\r\nheretical company which he kept, and let him make _the least bit of a\r\nretraction_ respecting some few passages in his works, and the whole\r\naffair would at once be arranged.[205]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lefèvre's mental suffering.]\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation of Lefèvre with the church did not take place. The\r\n\"bit of a retraction\" was never written. But none the less are Lefèvre's\r\nlast days reported to have been disturbed by harassing thoughts. The\r\nnoble old man, who had consecrated to the translation of the Bible and\r\nto exegetical comment upon its books the energy of many years, and who\r\nhad suffered no little obloquy in consequence, could not forgive himself\r\nthat he had not come forward more manfully in defence of the truth. One\r\nday, not long before his death, it is said, while seated at the table of\r\nthe King and Queen of Navarre, he was observed to be overcome with\r\nemotion. When Margaret expressed her surprise at the gloomy deportment\r\nof one whose society she had sought for her own diversion, Lefèvre\r\nmournfully exclaimed, \"How can I contribute to the pleasure of others,\r\nwho am myself the greatest sinner upon earth?\" In reply to the questions\r\ncalled forth by so unexpected a confession, Lefèvre, while admitting\r\nthat throughout his long life his morals had been exemplary, and that he\r\nwas conscious of no flagrant crime against society, proceeded, in words\r\nfrequently interrupted by sobs, to explain his deep penitence: \"How\r\nshall I, who have taught others the purity of the Gospel, be able to\r\nstand at God's tribunal? Thousands have suffered and died for the\r\ndefence of the truth in which I instructed them; and I, unfaithful\r\nshepherd that I am, after attaining so advanced an age, when I ought to\r\nlove nothing less than I do life--nay, rather, when I ought to desire\r\ndeath--I have basely avoided the martyr's crown, and have betrayed the\r\ncause of my God!\" It was with difficulty that the queen and others who\r\nwere present succeeded in allaying the aged scholar's grief.[206]\r\n\r\nThe \"anguish of spirit and terror of God's judgment experienced by so\r\npious an old man as Lefèvre,\" because he had concealed the truth which\r\nhe ought openly to have espoused, supplied an instructive warning for\r\nhis even more timid disciples. Farel, who never lacked courage, was not\r\nslow to avail himself of it. Taking advantage of the freedom of an old\r\nassociate, he addressed a letter containing an account of Lefèvre's\r\ndeath, with some serious admonitions, to Michel d'Arande, who never\r\nventuring to separate from a church whose corruptions he acknowledged,\r\nhad reached the position of Bishop of Saint Paul-Trois-Châteaux, in\r\nDauphiny. The letter has perished, but the reply in which the prelate's\r\ndejection and internal conflicts but too plainly appear, has seen the\r\nlight after a burial of three centuries. Admitting the guilt of his\r\ncourse, the bishop begs the intrepid reformer to pray for him\r\ncontinually, and meanwhile not to withhold his friendly exhortations,\r\nthat at length the writer may be able to extricate himself from the deep\r\nmire in which he finds no firm foundation to stand upon.[207]\r\n\r\nSuch was the unhappy state of mind to which many good, but irresolute\r\nmen were reduced, who, in view of the persecution certain to follow an\r\nopen avowal of their reformatory sentiments, endeavored to persuade\r\nthemselves that it was permissible to conceal them under a thin veil of\r\nexternal conformity to the rites of the Roman church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fortunes of Gérard Roussel.]\r\n\r\nGérard Roussel, the most distinguished representative of this class of\r\nmystics, was appointed by the Queen of Navarre to be her preacher and\r\nconfessor, and promoted successively to be Abbot of Clairac and Bishop\r\nof Oléron. Yet he remained, to his death, a sincere friend of the\r\nReformation. Occasionally, at least, he preached its doctrines with\r\ntolerable distinctness; as, for instance, in the Lenten discourses\r\ndelivered by him, in conjunction with Courault and Bertault, before the\r\nFrench court in the Louvre (1532). In his writings he was still more\r\noutspoken. Some of them might have been written not only by a reformer,\r\nbut by a disciple of Calvin, so sharply drawn were the doctrinal\r\nexpositions.[208] Meanwhile, in his own diocese he set forth the example\r\nof a faithful pastor. Even so bitter an enemy of Protestantism as\r\nFlorimond de Ræmond, contrasting Roussel's piety with the worldliness\r\nof the sporting French bishops of the period, is forced to admit that\r\nhis pack of hounds was the crowd of poor men and women whom he daily\r\nfed, his horses and attendants a host of children whom he caused to be\r\ninstructed in letters.[209]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Gérard Roussel's half measures, while failing to conciliate the\r\nadherents of the Roman church, alienated from him the sympathies of the\r\nreformers; for they saw in his conduct a weakness little short of entire\r\napostasy. More modern Roman Catholic writers, for similar reasons, deny\r\nthat Roussel was ever at heart a friend of the Reformation.[210] Not so,\r\nhowever, thought the fanatics of his own time. While the Bishop of\r\nOléron was one day declaiming, in a church of his diocese, against the\r\nexcessive multiplication of feasts, the pulpit in which he stood was\r\nsuddenly overturned, and the preacher hurled with violence to the\r\nground. The catastrophe was the premeditated act of a religious zealot,\r\nwho had brought with him into the sacred place an axe concealed under\r\nhis cloak. The fall proved fatal to Gérard Roussel, who is said to have\r\nexpressed on his death-bed similar regrets to those which had disturbed\r\nthe last hours of Lefèvre d'Étaples. As for the murderer, although\r\narrested and tried by the Parliament of Bordeaux, he was in the end\r\nacquitted, on the ground that he had performed a meritorious act, or, at\r\nmost, committed a venial offence, in ridding the world of so dangerous a\r\nheretic as the Bishop of Oléron.[211]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Scævolæ Sammarthani Elog. lib. i., i. 3. \"Statura fuit\r\nsupra modum humili,\" etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Sc.

These statements are\r\nconfirmed by a passage in the Commentary on St. Paul's Epistles, in\r\nwhich, after deploring the corruption of the church, Lefèvre observes:\r\n\"Yet the signs of the times announce that a renewal is near, and while\r\nGod is opening new ways for the preaching of the Gospel, by the\r\ndiscoveries and conquests of the Portuguese and Spaniards in all parts\r\nof the world, we must hope that He will visit His church and raise it\r\nfrom the degradation into which it is fallen.\" Herminjard, i. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Scævolæ Sammarthani, Elogia doctorum in Gallia virorum,\r\nlib. i.

On his return the Elector fell sick at Paris, where he received\r\nfrequent visits from the King and Queen of Navarre. It was on one of\r\nthese occasions that Margaret related to him this story, in the hearing\r\nof the secretary.

AND MARGARET OF ANGOULEME--EARLY REFORMATORY MOVEMENTS AND\r\nSTRUGGLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis I. and his sister.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The portrait of the king.]\r\n\r\nFrancis the First and his sister, Margaret of Angoulême, were destined\r\nto exercise so important an influence in shaping the history of the\r\nFrench Reformation during the first half of the sixteenth century, that\r\na glance at their personal history and character seems indispensable.\r\nFrancis Was in his twenty-first year when, by the extinction of the\r\nelder line of the house of Orleans, the crown came to him as the nearest\r\nheir of Louis the Twelfth.[212] He was tall, but well proportioned, of a\r\nfair complexion, with a body capable of enduring without difficulty\r\ngreat exposure and fatigue. In an extant portrait, taken five years\r\nlater, he is delineated with long hair and scanty beard. The drooping\r\nlids give to his eyes a languid expression, while the length of his\r\nnose, which earned him the sobriquet of \"le roi au long nez,\" redeems\r\nhis physiognomy from any approach to heaviness.[213] On the other hand,\r\nthe Venetian Marino Cavalli, writing shortly before the close of his\r\nreign, eulogizes the personal appearance of Francis, at that time more\r\nthan fifty years old. His mien was so right royal, we are assured, that\r\neven a foreigner, never having seen him before, would single him out\r\nfrom any company and instinctively exclaim, \"This is the king!\" No ruler\r\nof the day surpassed him in gravity and nobility of bearing. Well did he\r\ndeserve to succeed that long line of monarchs upon each of whom the\r\nsacred oil, applied at his coronation in the cathedral of Rheims, had\r\nconferred the marvellous property of healing the king's-evil by a simple\r\ntouch.[214]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His character and tastes.]\r\n\r\nAt his accession, the lively imagination of Francis, fed upon the\r\nromances of chivalry that constituted his favorite reading, called up\r\nthe picture of a brilliant future, wherein gallant deeds in arms should\r\nplace him among the most renowned knights of Christendom. The ideal\r\ncharacter he proposed for himself involving a certain regard for his\r\nword, Francis's mind revolted from imitating the plebeian duplicity of\r\nhis wily predecessor, Louis the Eleventh--a king who enjoyed the\r\nundesirable reputation of never having made a promise which he intended\r\nin good faith to keep. The memory of the disingenuous manner in which\r\nLouis, by winking at the opposition of the Parliament of Paris, had\r\nsuffered the revocation of the Pragmatic Sanction to fail, in spite of\r\nhis own solemn engagements to carry it into execution, was, undoubtedly,\r\none of the leading motives inducing the young prince, at the very\r\nbeginning of his reign, to adopt the arbitrary measures already spoken\r\nof in a preceding chapter, respecting the papal concordat. Not for half\r\nhis kingdom, he repeatedly declared, would he break the pledge he had\r\ngiven his Holiness. It is not difficult, however, to reconcile the\r\npertinacity of Francis, on this occasion, with the frequent and well\r\nauthenticated instances of bad faith in his dealings with other\r\nmonarchs.\r\n\r\nIf his literary abilities were slender and his acquirements meagre, this\r\nking had at least the faculty of appreciating excellence in others. The\r\nscholars and wits whom, as we have seen, he succeeded in gathering about\r\nhim, repaid his munificence with lavish praise, couched in all manner of\r\nverse, and in every language employed in the civilized world. Even later\r\nhistorians have not hesitated to rate him much higher than his very\r\nmoderate abilities would seem to warrant.[215] The portrait drawn by the\r\nbiographer of his imperial rival is, perhaps, full as advantageous as a\r\nregard for truth will permit us to accept. \"Francis,\" says Robertson,\r\n\"notwithstanding the many errors conspicuous in his foreign policy and\r\ndomestic administration, was nevertheless humane, beneficent, generous.\r\nHe possessed dignity without pride, affability free from meanness, and\r\ncourtesy exempt from deceit. All who had access to him, and no man of\r\nmerit was ever denied that privilege, respected and loved him.\r\nCaptivated with his personal qualities, his subjects forgot his defects\r\nas a monarch, and, admiring him as the most accomplished and amiable\r\ngentleman in his dominions, they hardly murmured at acts of\r\nmaladministration, which, in a prince of less engaging dispositions,\r\nwould have seemed unpardonable.\"[216]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrast between Francis I. and Charles V.]\r\n\r\nTwo monarchs could scarcely be more dissimilar than were Francis and the\r\nEmperor Charles. \"So great is the difference between these two princes,\"\r\nsays the Venetian Giustiniano, \"that, as her most serene majesty the\r\nQueen of Navarre, the king's sister, remarked to me when talking on the\r\nsubject, one of the two must needs be created anew by God after the\r\npattern of the other, before they could agree. For, whilst the most\r\nChristian king is reluctant to assume the burden of great thoughts or\r\nundertakings, and devotes himself much to the chase or to his own\r\npleasures, the emperor never thinks of anything but business and\r\naggrandizement; and, whereas the most Christian king is simple, open,\r\nand very liberal, and quite sufficiently inclined to defer to the\r\njudgment and counsel of others, the emperor is reserved, parsimonious,\r\nand obstinate in his opinions, governing by himself, rather than through\r\nany one else.\"[217]\r\n\r\nThis diversity of temperament and disposition had ample scope for\r\nmanifestation during the protracted wars waged by the two monarchs with\r\neach other. Fit representative of the race to which he belonged, Francis\r\nwas bold, adventurous, and almost resistless in the impetuosity of a\r\nfirst assault. But he soon tired of his undertakings, and relinquished\r\nto the cooler and more calculating Charles the solid fruits of\r\nvictory.[218]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis's religious convictions.]\r\n\r\nOf the possession of deep religious convictions I do not know that\r\nFrancis has left any satisfactory evidence. That he was not strongly\r\nattached to the Roman church, that he thoroughly despised the ignorant\r\nmonks, whose dissolute lives he well knew, that he had no extraordinary\r\nesteem for the Pope, all this is clear enough from many incidents of his\r\nlife. It would even appear that, at one or two points, he might have\r\nbeen pleased to witness such a reformation of the church as could be\r\neffected without disturbing the existing order. To this he was the more\r\ninclined, that he found almost all the men distinguished for their\r\nlearning arrayed on the side of the \"new doctrines,\" as they were\r\nstyled, while the pretorian legion of the papacy was headed by the\r\nopponents of letters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His fear of innovation.]\r\n\r\nIt will be found, however, that several circumstances tended to\r\ncounteract or reverse the king's favorable prepossessions. Not least\r\ninfluential was a pernicious sentiment studiously instilled in his mind\r\nby those whose material interests were all on the side of the\r\nmaintenance of the existing system--_that a change of religion\r\nnecessarily involves a change of government_. We shall hear much during\r\nthe century of this lying political axiom. When Francis, in his\r\nirritation at the Pope, suggested, on one occasion, to the Nuncio, that\r\nhe might be compelled to follow the example Henry the Eighth, of\r\nEngland, had set him, and permit the spread of the \"Lutheran\" religion\r\nin France, the astute prelate replied: \"Sire, to speak with all\r\nfrankness, you would be the first to repent your rash step. Your loss\r\nwould be greater than the Pope's; for _a new religion established in the\r\nmidst of a people involves nothing short of a change of prince_.\"[219]\r\nAnd the same author that records this incident tells us that Francis\r\nhated the Lutheran \"heresy,\" and used to say that this, like every other\r\nnew sect, tended more to the destruction of kingdoms than to the\r\nedification of souls.[220] Nor must it be overlooked that Francis\r\ndoubtless felt strongly confirmed in his persuasion, by the rash and\r\ndisorderly acts of some restless and inconsiderate spirits such as are\r\nwont eagerly to embrace any new belief. Not the peasants' insurrections\r\nin Germany alone, but as well the excesses of the iconoclasts, and the\r\nimprudence of the authors of the famous placards of 1534, although their\r\nacts were distinctly repudiated by the vast majority of the French\r\nreformers, inflicted irretrievable damage, by furnishing plausible\r\narguments to those who accused the Protestants of being authors or\r\nabettors of riot and confusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His loose morals.]\r\n\r\nA second reason of the early estrangement of Francis from the \"new\r\ndoctrines\" has more frequently been overlooked. The rigid code of morals\r\nwhich the reformers established, and which John Calvin attempted to make\r\nin Geneva the law of the state, repelled a prince who, though twice\r\nmarried and both times to women devoted to his interests and faithful to\r\ntheir vows, treated his lawful wives with open neglect, and preferred to\r\nconsort with perfidious mistresses, who sold to the enemy for money his\r\nconfidential disclosures--a prince who, not satisfied with introducing\r\nexcesses until then unheard of among his nobles, was not ashamed to\r\nbestow the royal bounty upon the professed head of the degraded women\r\nwhom he allowed to accompany the court from place to place.[221]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His anxiety to obtain the support of the Pope.]\r\n\r\nIf to these two motives we add a third--the desire of the king to avail\r\nhimself of the important influence of the Roman pontiff upon the\r\npolitics of Europe--we shall be at no loss to account for the singular\r\nfact that the brother of Margaret of Angoulême, in spite of his sister's\r\nentreaties and the promptings of his own better feeling--at times in\r\ndefiance of his own manifest advantage--became during the later part of\r\nhis reign the first of that long line of persecutors of whom the\r\nHuguenots were the unhappy victims.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Studious disposition of Margaret.]\r\n\r\nMargaret was two years older than her brother. Born April 11, 1492, in\r\nthe city of Angoulême, she enjoyed, in common with Francis, all the\r\nopportunities of liberal culture afforded by her exalted station. These\r\nopportunities her keener intellect enabled her to improve far better\r\nthan the future king. While Francis was indulging his passion for the\r\nchase, in company with Robert de la Marck, \"the Boar of the Ardennes,\"\r\nMargaret was patiently applying herself to study. It is not always easy\r\nto determine how much is to be set down as truth, and how much belongs\r\nto the category of fiction, in the current stories of the scholarly\r\nattainments of princely personages. But there is good reason in the\r\npresent case to believe that, unlike most of the ladies of her age that\r\nwere reputed prodigies of learning, Margaret of Angoulême did not\r\nconfine herself to the modern languages, but became proficient in\r\nLatin, besides acquiring some notion of Greek and Hebrew. By extensive\r\nreading, and through intercourse with the best living masters of the\r\nFrench language, she made herself a graceful writer. She was, moreover,\r\na poet of no mean pretensions, as her verses, often comparing favorably\r\nwith those of Clément Marot, abundantly testify. It was, however, to the\r\nhigher walks of philosophical and religious thought that Margaret felt\r\nmost strongly drawn. Could implicit credit be given to the partial\r\npraises of her professed eulogist, Charles de Sainte-Marthe, who owed\r\nhis escape from the stake to her powerful intercession, we might affirm\r\nthat the contemplation of the sublime truths of Revelation early\r\ninfluenced her entire character, and that \"the Spirit of God began then\r\nto manifest His presence in her eyes, her expression, her walk, her\r\nconversation--in a word, in all her actions.\"[222]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her personal appearance.]\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may have been the precocious virtues of Margaret at the\r\nage of fifteen, it is certain that when, by her brother's elevation to\r\nthe throne, she was introduced to the foremost place at court, it was\r\nher remarkable qualities of heart, quite as much as her recognized\r\nmental abilities, that called forth universal admiration. Her personal\r\nappearance, it is true, was a favorite subject for the encomium of\r\npoets; but her portraits fail to justify their panegyrics, and convey no\r\nimpression of beauty. The features are large, the nose as conspicuously\r\nlong as her brother's; yet the sweetness of expression, upon which Marot\r\nis careful chiefly to dwell in one of his elegant poetical epistles, is\r\nnot less noticeable.[223]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her political Influence.]\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of public affairs Margaret took no insignificant part.\r\nFrancis was accustomed so uniformly to entrust his mother and sister\r\nwith important state secrets, that to the powerful council thus firmly\r\nunited by filial and fraternal ties the term \"Trinity\" was applied, not\r\nonly by the courtiers, but by the royal family itself.[224] Foreign\r\ndiplomatists extolled Margaret's intelligent statesmanship, and asserted\r\nthat she was consulted on every occasion.[225] It is a substantial claim\r\nof Margaret to the respect of posterity, that the influence thus enjoyed\r\nwas, apparently, never prostituted to the advancement of selfish ends,\r\nbut constantly exerted in the interest of learning, humanity, and\r\nreligious liberty.\r\n\r\nMargaret was first married, in 1509, to the Duke of Alençon, a prince\r\nwhose cowardice on the battle-field of Pavia (1525), where he commanded\r\nthe French left wing, is said to have been the principal cause of the\r\ndefeat and capture of his royal brother-in-law. He made good his own\r\nescape, only to die, at Lyons, of disease induced by exposure and\r\naggravated by bitter mortification. The next two years were spent by\r\nMargaret in unremitting efforts to secure her brother's release. With\r\nthis object in view she obtained from the emperor a safe-conduct\r\nenabling her to visit and console Francis in his imprisonment at Madrid,\r\nand endeavor to settle with his captor the terms of his ransom. But,\r\nwhile admiring her sisterly devotion, Charles showed little disposition\r\nto yield to her solicitations. In fact, he even issued an order to seize\r\nher person the moment the term of her safe-conduct should expire--a\r\nperil avoided by the duchess only by forced marches. As it was, she\r\ncrossed the frontier, it is said, a single hour before the critical\r\ntime. The motive of this signal breach of imperial courtesy was,\r\ndoubtless, the well-founded belief that Margaret was bearing home to\r\nFrance a royal abdication in favor of the Dauphin.[226]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret marries Henry of Navarre.]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1527, Margaret was married with great pomp to Henri d'Albret,\r\nKing of Navarre.[227] The match would seem to have been prompted by love\r\nand admiration on her side; for the groom had performed a romantic\r\nexploit in effecting his escape from prison after his capture at\r\nPavia.[228] In spite of the great disparity between the ages of Margaret\r\nand her husband,[229] the union was congenial, and added greatly to the\r\npower and resources of the latter. The duchies of Alençon and Berry more\r\nthan equalled in extent the actual domain of the King of Navarre; for,\r\nfrom the time when Ferdinand the Catholic (in July, 1512) wrested from\r\nbrave Catharine of Foix and her inefficient husband John[230] all their\r\npossessions on the southern slope of the Pyrenees,[231] the authority\r\nof the titular monarch was respected only in the mountainous district of\r\nwhich Pau was the capital, and to which the names of Béarn or French\r\nNavarre are indifferently applied. The union thus auspiciously begun\r\nlasted, unbroken by domestic contention, until the death of Margaret, in\r\n1549;[232] and the pompous ceremonial attending the queen's obsequies is\r\nsaid to have been a sincere attestation of the universal sorrow\r\naffecting the King of Navarre and his subjects alike.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: She corresponds with Bishop Briçonnet.]\r\n\r\nIt was through the instrumentality of the Bishop of Meaux that Margaret\r\nof Angoulême was first drawn into sympathy with the reformatory\r\nmovement. Unsatisfied with herself and with the influences surrounding\r\nher, she sought in Briçonnet a spiritual adviser and guide. The prelate,\r\nin the abstruse and almost unintelligible language of exaggerated\r\nmysticism, endeavored to fulfil the trust. His prolix correspondence\r\nstill exists in manuscript in the National Library of Paris, together\r\nwith the replies of his royal penitent. Its incomprehensibility may\r\nperhaps forever preclude the publication of the greater part;[233] but\r\nwe can readily forgive the bishop's absurdities and far-fetched\r\nconceits, when we find him in his letters leading Margaret to the Holy\r\nScriptures as the only source of spiritual strength, and enjoining a\r\nhumble and docile reception of its teachings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Luther's teachings condemned by the Sorbonne.]\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of April, 1521, the University of Paris, whose opinion\r\nrespecting Luther's tenets the entire Christian world had for two years\r\nbeen anxiously expecting, pronounced its solemn decision. It condemned\r\nthe writings of the German monk to the flames, on the ground that they\r\nwere seductive, insulting to the hierarchy, contrary to Scripture, and\r\nschismatic. It likened his latest production, _De Captivitate\r\nBabylonica_, to Alcoran. It branded as preposterous the notion that God\r\nhad reserved the discovery of what is needful to the salvation of the\r\nfaithful for Martin Luther to make; as though Christ had left his\r\nspouse, the Church, so many centuries, and until now, in the darkness\r\nand blindness of error. Such sentiments as he uttered were a denial of\r\nthe first principles of the faith, an unblushing profession of impiety,\r\nan arrogance so impious that it must be repressed by chains and\r\ncensures--nay, by fire and by flame, rather than refuted by\r\nargument.[234] A long list of heretical propositions selected from\r\nLuther's works was appended.[235]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanchthon's defence.]\r\n\r\nIn the month of June following, Melanchthon replied to the Sorbonne's\r\ncondemnation. He declared that, could the great Gerson and his\r\nillustrious associates and predecessors rise from the dead, they would\r\nfail to recognize in the present race of theologians their legitimate\r\noffspring, and that they would deplore the misfortune of the university\r\nas well as of the whole of Christendom, in that sophists had usurped the\r\nplace of theologians, and slanderers the seat of Christian doctors. As\r\nfor the silly letter prefixed to the decree, the reformer wrote, it is a\r\nfeeble production full of womanish fury: \"He pretends to the sole\r\npossession of wisdom. He contemns us. He is a Manichæan, a Montanist; he\r\nis mad. Let him be compelled by fire and flame.\" Who could refrain from\r\nderisive laughter at the unmanly and truly monkish weakness of such\r\nthreats?[236]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regency of Louise de Savoie.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1523 the king, in order to provide for the government\r\nof France during his expected absence from the capital, appointed his\r\nmother temporary regent--a dignity which Louise de Savoie enjoyed more\r\nthan once during Francis's reign. The chancellor, Antoine Duprat,\r\nembraced the opportunity to persuade the queen mother that she could\r\nnot better atone for the irregularities of her own life than by\r\nenforcing submission to the authority of the papal church. What causes\r\nhad contributed to the very radical change apparently effected in her\r\nmental attitude to the established ecclesiastical system, since she had\r\nin the preceding December discovered the monks, of whatever color their\r\ncowl might be, to be arrant \"hypocrites\" and the most \"dangerous\r\ngeneration of human kind\"--if, indeed, any such change in her mental\r\nattitude had really taken place at all, and her present zeal was not\r\naltogether assumed from political motives--we have not the means of\r\ndetermining with certainty. However this may be, she was now induced to\r\ntake a much more decided stand than Francis had ever taken in opposition\r\nto the reformed doctrines, of whose spread, not only in Meaux and other\r\ncities in the provinces, but even in Paris, both in the schools of\r\nlearning and without, there began to be symptoms alarming to the\r\nhierarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sorbonne's recommendations for the extirpation of\r\nheresy.]\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary step, the regent sent her confessor, Friar Gilbert\r\nNicolai, to the Sorbonne, with instructions to consult it respecting\r\n\"the means to be employed for purging this very Christian realm of the\r\ndamnable doctrine of Luther.\" It need scarcely be said that the message\r\nwas received with great delight. The theological doctors soon replied,\r\nrendering thanks to Almighty God for having inspired Louise with the\r\nholy purpose of executing whatever might be found most likely to promote\r\nGod's honor and the prosperity of France.[237] What measures did they\r\npropose to her as best calculated to accomplish this laudable end?\r\nSermons, disputations, books, and other scholastic means, they write,\r\nmay be employed in the refutation of the errors of Luther, as indeed\r\nthey are every day employed, at the Sorbonne's instigation, and from\r\nthis instrumentality some good effects may be expected; but since, after\r\nall, neither sermons nor books, however learned and conclusive, _compel_\r\nany person to renounce his heretical views, more practical and coercive\r\nmeasures must be adopted if the object is to be attained. All royal\r\nofficers must be enjoined strictly to enforce every order promulgated\r\nagainst heretics. The prelates must be urged to demand, on pain of\r\nexcommunication, the surrender of all books of Luther or his supporters\r\nfound in their dioceses. Meanwhile, the highest ecclesiastical censures\r\nare to be directed against those who in any way uphold the heterodox\r\nbelief. It is only in this way that hope can reasonably be entertained\r\nof suppressing this pernicious innovation, which may yet inflict still\r\ngreater evils upon unfortunate France; since the Scriptures tell us that\r\npestilence, famine, and war served as a rod for the punishment of God's\r\nchosen nation of old, whenever it forsook the pure precepts of the law\r\ngiven by the Almighty.\r\n\r\nIn reply to another inquiry made by the regent at the same time, the\r\nSorbonne enters into greater detail. If any one complains that he is\r\nunjustly accused of favoring the heresy that has recently appeared, let\r\nhim clear himself by following St. Paul's example, who, when brought to\r\nthe knowledge of the truth, instantly undertook the defence of what he\r\nhad ignorantly persecuted. Rumors that some persons in high places are\r\nfriendly to the spread of the new errors have gained lamentable\r\ncurrency, both at home and abroad. They have obtained confirmation from\r\nthe praise lately lavished by \"some great personages\" upon the doctrine\r\nof Luther, and the blame poured upon its opponents. The execution of the\r\nking's order for the burning of Luther's books has been singularly\r\ndelayed. Worst of all have been the obstacles placed in the way of the\r\npious efforts of the prelates, either without the consent of the king,\r\nor by him ill-advised--for example, in the proceedings of the Bishop of\r\nParis against Louis de Berquin. Similar impediments have been interposed\r\nto prevent the condemnation by parliament and university of the printed\r\nworks of this same Berquin and of Lefèvre d'Étaples; while, as if to\r\nmake the affair still more scandalous, two treatises lately written in\r\nrefutation of Luther's doctrines have been seized in the name of the\r\nking and by his authority.[238]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wide circulation of Luther's works.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the complaints of the theological faculty, such the means\r\nsuggested for the destruction of the new leaven that was already\r\nbeginning to assert its mission to permeate society. There were\r\ncertainly sufficient grounds for apprehension. The works of Luther, as\r\nwe have before seen, had early been translated into French, and a\r\ncontemporary writer confirms the statement that they had already been\r\nwidely disseminated.[239] An order of parliament, referred to in its\r\ncommunication to the regent, had indeed been published, to the sound of\r\nthe trumpet, throughout the city of Paris (August 3, 1521), strictly\r\ncommanding all booksellers, printers, and others that might have copies\r\nin their possession, to give them up within the space of eight days, on\r\npain of imprisonment and fine.[240] But even this measure failed to\r\naccomplish the desired result. The Reformation was silently extending\r\nits influence, as some significant events sufficiently proved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lambert, the first French monk to embrace the Reformation.]\r\n\r\nAt Avignon, copies of several of the writings of Martin Luther fell into\r\nthe hands of François Lambert, son of a former private secretary of the\r\npapal legate entrusted with the government of the Comtât Venaissin. He\r\nwas a man of vivid imagination, keen religious sensibilities, and marked\r\noratorical powers. He had at the age of fifteen been so deeply impressed\r\nby the saintly appearance of the Franciscans as to seek admission to\r\ntheir monastery as a novice. No sooner did he assume, a year later\r\n(1503), the irrevocable vows that constituted him a monk, than his\r\ndisenchantment began. According to his own account, the quarrelsome and\r\ndebauched friars no longer felt any of the solicitude they had\r\npreviously entertained lest the knowledge of their excesses should deter\r\nhim from embracing a \"religious\" life. A few years later Lambert became\r\na preacher, and having, through a somewhat careful study of the Holy\r\nScriptures, embraced more evangelical views than were held by most of\r\nhis order, began to deliver discourses as well received by the people as\r\nthey were hated by his fellow-monks. Great was the outcry against him\r\nwhen he openly denounced the misdeeds of a worthless vender of papal\r\nindulgences; still greater when copies of Luther's treatises were found\r\nin his possession. The books were seized, sealed, condemned, and burned,\r\nalthough scarcely a glance had been vouchsafed at their contents. It was\r\nenough for the monkish judges to cry: \"They are heretical! They are\r\nheretical!\" \"Nevertheless,\" exclaims honest Lambert, kindling with\r\nindignation at the remembrance of the scene, \"I confidently assert that\r\nthose same books of Luther contain more of pure theology than all the\r\nwritings of all the monks that have lived since the creation of the\r\nworld.\"[241]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is also the first to renounce celibacy.]\r\n\r\nLambert had made full trial of the monastic life. He had even immured\r\nhimself for some time in a Carthusian retreat, but found its inmates in\r\nno respect superior to the Franciscans. At last an opportunity for\r\nescape offered. In 1522, when a score of years had passed since he\r\nentered upon his novitiate, he was despatched with letters to the\r\ngeneral of his order. Instead of fulfilling his commission, he traversed\r\nSwitzerland, and made his way to Wittemberg, where he satisfied the\r\ndesire he had long entertained, of meeting the great reformer to whose\r\nworks he owed his own spiritual enlightenment. Full of zeal for the\r\npropagation of the doctrines he had embraced, Lambert, not long after\r\n(1524), established himself at Metz as a favorable point from which\r\nFrance might be influenced. But the commotion excited by his\r\nopponents--perhaps, also, his own lack of prudence--compelled him within\r\na fortnight to flee to Strasbourg.[242] Here, more secure, but scarcely\r\nmore judicious, he busied himself with sending over the French borders\r\nnumbers of tracts composed or translated by himself, and addressing to\r\nFrancis and the chief persons of his court appeals which, doubtless,\r\nrarely if ever reached their eyes.[243] In another field of labor, to\r\nwhich the Landgrave of Hesse called him, François Lambert performed\r\nservices far more important than any he was permitted to render his\r\nnative land. As the first French monk to throw aside his habit--above\r\nall, as the first to renounce celibacy and defend in a published\r\ntreatise the step he had taken (1523), no French reformer, even among\r\nthose of far greater abilities and wider influence, was regarded by the\r\nadherents of the Roman Catholic Church with so intense a dislike.[244]\r\n\r\nThe firm hold which the Reformation was gaining on the population of\r\nseveral places of great importance, close upon the eastern frontiers of\r\nthe kingdom, was a portent of evil in the eyes of the Sorbonne; for\r\nMetz, St. Hippolyte, and Montbéliard, all destined to be absorbed in the\r\ngrowing territories of France, were already bound to it by close ties of\r\ncommercial intercourse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jean Châtellain, of Metz.]\r\n\r\nIn Metz the powerful appeals of an Augustinian monk, Jean Châtellain,\r\nhad powerfully moved the masses. He was as eloquent as he was learned,\r\nas commanding in appearance as fearless in the expression of his\r\nbelief.[245] The attempt to molest him would have proved a very\r\ndangerous one for the clergy of Metz to make; for the enthusiasm of the\r\nlaity in his support knew no bounds, and the churchmen prudently avoided\r\ngiving it an occasion for manifestation. But, no sooner had Châtellain\r\nbeen induced on some pretext to leave the safe protection of the walls,\r\nthan a friar of his own order and monastery betrayed him to the\r\nbishop.[246] He was hurriedly taken to Nommeny, and thence to Vic for\r\ntrial and execution. In vain did the Inquisitor of the Faith strive to\r\nshake his constancy. His judges were forced to liken their incorrigible\r\nprisoner to the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear. As \"a preacher of\r\nfalse doctrines,\" an \"apostate\" and a \"liar toward God Almighty,\" they\r\ndeclared him excommunicated and deprived of whatever ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices he might hold. The faithful compiler of the French martyrology\r\ngives in accurate, but painful, detail the successive steps by which\r\nChâtellain was stripped of the various prerogatives conferred upon him\r\nin ordination. I shall not repeat the story of sacred vessels placed in\r\nhis hands only to be hastily snatched from them, of the scraping of his\r\nfingers supposed to remove the grace of consecration, of chasuble and\r\nstole indignantly taken away--in short, of all the petty devices of a\r\nmalice at which the mind wearies and the heart sickens. It was perhaps a\r\nfitting sequel to the ceremony that the degrading bishop should hand his\r\nvictim over to the representative of the secular arm to be put to death,\r\nwith a hypocritical recommendation to mercy: \"Lord Judge, we entreat you\r\nas affectionately as we can, as well by the love of God, as from pity\r\nand compassion, and out of respect for our prayers, that you do this\r\nwretched man no injury tending to death or the mutilation of his\r\nbody.\"[247] The prayer was granted--according to the intent of the\r\npetitioner. On the twelfth of January, 1525, Châtellain was led to the\r\nplace of execution, as cheerful in demeanor, the witnesses said, as if\r\nwalking to a feast. At the stake he knelt and offered a short prayer,\r\nthen met his horrible sentence with a constancy that won many converts\r\nto the faith for which he had suffered. At the news of the fate of their\r\nadmired teacher, the citizens of Metz could not contain their rage. A\r\ntumultuous scene ensued, in which it was well that the\r\necclesiastics--there were more than nine hundred within the\r\nwalls[248]--escaped with no greater injury at the hands of the angry\r\npopulace than some passing insults. John Vedast, an evangelical teacher,\r\nwas at that time in confinement, reserved for a similar doom to that of\r\nChâtellain. He was liberated by the people, who, in a body membering\r\nseveral thousand men, visited his prison and enabled him to escape to a\r\nsafe refuge. It was not until a strong detachment of troops had been\r\nthrown into the city that the burgesses were reduced to submission.[249]\r\n\"None the less,\" admits a Roman Catholic historian, \"did Lutheranism\r\nspread over the entire district of Metz.\"[250]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tragic end of Wolfgang Schuch.]\r\n\r\nAt St. Hippolyte, a town near the Swiss frontier, dependent upon the\r\nDuke of Lorraine, similar success and a similarly tragic end were the\r\nresults of the zealous labors of Wolfgang Schuch, a priest of German\r\nextraction. The \"good duke\" Antoine, having been led to confound the\r\npeaceable disciples of Schuch with the revolted peasants, whose ravages\r\nhad excited widespread alarm throughout Germany, publicly proclaimed his\r\nintention of visiting the town that harbored them with fire and sword.\r\nTo propitiate him by removing his misapprehension, Schuch wrote to the\r\nduke a singularly touching letter containing a candid exposition of the\r\nreligion he professed;[251] but finding that his missive had been of no\r\navail, he resolved to immolate himself in behalf of his flock. At\r\nNancy, the capital of the duchy, whither he had gone to dissuade Antoine\r\nfrom executing his savage threats, he was thrown into a loathsome\r\ndungeon, while the University of Paris was consulted respecting the\r\nsoundness of thirty-one propositions extracted from his writings by the\r\nInquisitor of Lorraine. On the nineteenth of August, 1525--the\r\ntheologians of the Sorbonne having some months before reported\r\nunfavorably upon the theses submitted to them--Wolfgang Schuch was\r\nconsigned to the flames.[252]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farel at Montbéliard.]\r\n\r\nLess sanguinary results attended the Reformation at Montbéliard, where\r\nthe indefatigable Farel was the chief actor. One of those highly\r\ndramatic incidents, in which the checkered life of this remarkable man\r\nabounds, is said to have preceded his withdrawal from the city.\r\nHappening, on St. Anthony's day, to meet, upon a bridge spanning a\r\nnarrow stream in the neighborhood, a solemn procession headed by priests\r\nchanting the praises of the saint whose effigy they bore aloft, Farel\r\nwas seized with an uncontrollable desire to arrest the impious service.\r\nSnatching the image from the hands of ecclesiastics who were little\r\nprepared for so sudden an onslaught, he indignantly cried, \"Wretched\r\nidolaters, will you never forsake your idolatry?\" At the same instant he\r\nthrew the saint into the water, before the astonished devotees had time\r\nto interfere. Had not some one just then opportunely raised the shout,\r\n\"The saint is drowning,\" it might have gone hard with the fearless\r\niconoclast.[253]\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was thus gaining a foothold in the bishopric of Metz, in\r\nthe duchy of Lorraine, and the county of Montbéliard--districts as yet\r\nindependent of France, in which country they were subsequently merged.\r\nBut, if suffered to be victorious at these important points, it might\r\nreadily cross the borders and spread with irresistible force to the\r\ncontiguous parts of Francis's dominions. Nearer home, the reformatory\r\nmovement at Meaux, though abandoned by the bishop who had fostered its\r\nfirst development, was not wholly suppressed. In Lyons and Grenoble,\r\nFriar Aimé Maigret had preached such evangelical sermons--in French to\r\nthe people and in Latin to the Parliament of Dauphiny--that he had been\r\nsent to Paris to be examined by the Sorbonne. The primate and his\r\ncouncil had seen with solicitude that from the ashes of Waldo and the\r\nPoor Men of Lyons \"very many new shoots were springing up,\"[254] and\r\ncalled for some signal act of severity to repress the growing evil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pierre Caroli lectures on the Psalms.]\r\n\r\nIn Paris itself the Sorbonne found reason for alarm. The sympathy of\r\nMargaret of Angoulême with the friends of progress was recognized. It\r\nhad already availed for the deliverance of Louis de Berquin, whose\r\nremarkable history will find a place in the next chapter. Nor did the\r\nredoubted syndic of the theological faculty, Beda, or Bédier, reign\r\nwithout a rival in the academic halls. Pierre Caroli, one of the doctors\r\ninvited by Briçonnet to Meaux, a clever wrangler, and never better\r\npleased than when involved in controversy, albeit a man of shallow\r\nreligious convictions and signal instability, wearied out by his\r\ncounter-plots the illustrious heresy-hunter. When forbidden to preach,\r\nCaroli opened a course of lectures upon the Psalms in the Collége de\r\nCambray. Having then been interdicted from continuing his prelections,\r\nhe made the modest request to be permitted to finish the exposition of\r\nthe 22d Psalm, which he had begun. This being refused, the disputatious\r\ndoctor posted the following notice on the doors of the college: \"Pierre\r\nCaroli, wishing to conform to the orders of the sacred faculty, ceases\r\nto teach. He will resume his lectures (when it shall please God) where\r\nhe left off, at the verse, 'They pierced my hands and my feet.'\"[255]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: The Heptameron of the Queen of Navarre.]\r\n\r\n     I have reserved for this place a few remarks respecting the\r\n     _Heptameron_ of Margaret of Angoulême, which seem required by the\r\n     disputed character or this singular work. I have spoken at length\r\n     of the virtues of the Queen of Navarre, and I may here add a\r\n     statement of my strong conviction that the accusation is altogether\r\n     groundless which ascribes a sinister meaning to the strong\r\n     expressions of sisterly affection so frequent in her correspondence\r\n     with Francis the First (see M. Génin, Supplément a la notice sur\r\n     Marg. d'Angoulême, prefixed to the second volume of the Letters).\r\n     Nor do I make any account of the vague statement of that mendacious\r\n     libertine, Brantôme, who doubtless imagined himself to be paying\r\n     the Queen of Navarre the most delicate compliment, when he said,\r\n     that \"of gallantry she knew more than her daily bread.\"\r\n\r\n     But, whatever the purity of Margaret's own private life, the fact\r\n     which cannot be overlooked is that a book of a decidedly immoral\r\n     tendency was composed and published under her name. Her most\r\n     sincere admirers would hail with gratification any satisfactory\r\n     evidence that the Heptameron was written by another hand.\r\n     Unfortunately, there seems to be none. On the contrary, we have\r\n     Brantôme's direct testimony to the effect that the composition of\r\n     the book was the employment of the queen's idle hours when\r\n     travelling about in her litter, and that his grandmother, being one\r\n     of Margaret's ladies of honor, was accustomed to take charge of her\r\n     writing-case (Ed. Lalanne, viii. 126). Equally untenable is the\r\n     view taken by the historian De Thou (liv. vi., vol. x. 508), who\r\n     makes the fault more venial by representing the Heptameron to have\r\n     been composed by the fair author in her youth. (So, too, Soldan, i.\r\n     89.) I am sorry to have to say that the events referred to in the\r\n     stories themselves belong to a period reaching within a year or two\r\n     of Margaret's death.\r\n\r\n     The facts, then, are simply these: The tales of Boccaccio's\r\n     Decameron were read with great delight by Margaret, by Francis the\r\n     First, and by his children. They resolved, therefore, to imitate\r\n     the great Italian novelist by committing to writing the most\r\n     remarkable incidents supplied by the gossip of the court (see the\r\n     Prologue to the Heptameron). Francis and his children, finding that\r\n     Margaret greatly excelled in this species of composition, soon\r\n     renounced the unequal strife, but encouraged her to pursue an\r\n     undertaking promising to afford them much amusement. Apportioning,\r\n     after the example of Boccaccio, a decade of stories, illustrative\r\n     of some single topic, to each day's entertainment, the Queen of\r\n     Navarre had reached the seventh day, when the death of her\r\n     brother, the near approach of her own end, and disgust with so\r\n     frivolous an occupation, induced her to suspend her labors. The\r\n     Heptameron, as the interrupted work was now called, was not\r\n     apparently intended for publication, but was, after Margaret's\r\n     death, printed under the auspices of her daughter, the celebrated\r\n     Jeanne d'Albret.\r\n\r\n     As to the stories themselves, they treat of adventures, in great\r\n     part amorous and often immodest. In this particular they are\r\n     scarcely less objectionable than those of Boccaccio. They differ\r\n     from the latter in the circumstance that the author's avowed\r\n     purpose is to insert none but actual occurrences. They are\r\n     distinguished from them more especially by the attempt uniformly\r\n     made to extract a wholesome lesson from every incident. The\r\n     prevalent vices of the day are portrayed--with too much minuteness\r\n     of detail, indeed, but only that they may be held up to the greater\r\n     condemnation. It is particularly the monks of various orders who,\r\n     for their flagrant crimes against morality, are made the object of\r\n     biting sarcasm. The abominable teachings of these professed\r\n     instructors of religion are justly reprobated. For example, in the\r\n     Forty-fourth Nouvelle, Parlamente, while admitting that some\r\n     Franciscans preach a pure doctrine, affirms that \"_the streets are\r\n     not paved with such, so much as marked by their opposites_;\" and\r\n     she relates the attempt of one of their prominent men, a doctor of\r\n     theology, to convince some members of his own fraternity that the\r\n     Gospel is entitled to no more credit than Cæsar's Commentaries.\r\n     \"From the hour I heard him,\" she adds, \"I have refused to believe\r\n     the words of any preacher unless I find them in agreement with\r\n     God's Word, _which is the true touchstone_ to ascertain what words\r\n     are true and what false\" (Ed. Soc. des bibliophiles, ii. 382-384).\r\n\r\n     Modern French _littérateurs_ have not failed to eulogize the author\r\n     as frequently rivalling her model in dramatic vividness of\r\n     narration. At the same time they take exception to the numerous\r\n     passages wherein she \"preaches,\" as detracting from the artistic\r\n     merit of her work. It is, however, precisely the feature here\r\n     referred to that constitutes, in the eyes of reflecting readers,\r\n     the chief, if not the sole, redeeming trait of the Heptameron. As a\r\n     favorable example, illustrating the nature of the pious words and\r\n     exhortations thrown in so incongruously with stories of the most\r\n     objectionable kind, I translate a few sentences from the Prologue,\r\n     in which Oisile (the pseudonym for Margaret herself) speaks: \"If\r\n     you ask me what receipt I have that keeps me so joyful and in such\r\n     good health in my old age, it is this--that as soon as I rise I\r\n     take and read the Holy Scriptures. Contemplating there the goodness\r\n     of God, who sent His Son to earth to announce the glad tidings of\r\n     the remission of all sins by the gift of His love, passion, and\r\n     merits, the consideration causes me such joy that I take my psalter\r\n     and sing in my heart as humbly as I can, while repeating with my\r\n     lips those beautiful psalms and hymns which the Holy Ghost composed\r\n     in the heart of David and other authors; and the satisfaction I\r\n     derive from this does me so much good that all the ills that may\r\n     befall me through the day appear to me to be blessings, seeing that\r\n     I bear in my heart Him who bore them for me. In like manner, before\r\n     I sup, I withdraw to give sustenance to my soul in reading, and\r\n     then at night I recall all I have done during the past day, in\r\n     order to ask for the pardon of my faults and thank God for His\r\n     gifts. Then in His love, fear and peace I take my rest, assured\r\n     from every ill. Wherefore, my children, here is the pastime upon\r\n     which I settled long since, after having in vain sought contentment\r\n     of spirit in all the rest.... For he that knows God sees everything\r\n     beautiful in Him, and without Him everything unattractive.\"\r\n     Prologue, 13-15.\r\n\r\n     If any one object that no quantity of pious reflections can\r\n     compensate for the positive evil in the Heptameron, I can but\r\n     acquiesce in his view, and concede that M. Génin has been much too\r\n     lenient in his estimate of Margaret's fault. It is a riddle which I\r\n     leave to the reader to solve, that a princess of unblemished\r\n     private life, of studious habits, and of not only a serious, but\r\n     even a positively religious turn of mind--in short, in every way a\r\n     noble pattern for one of the most corrupt courts Europe has ever\r\n     seen--should, in a work aiming to inculcate morality, and\r\n     abundantly furnished with direct religious exhortation, have\r\n     inserted, not _one_, but a _score_ of the most repulsive pictures\r\n     of vice, drawn from the impure scandal of that court.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: He was born at Cognac, Sept. 12, 1494.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: See the fac-simile in the magnificent work of M.

On the twenty-fourth of February, in consequence of\r\nthe disaster at Pavia, Francis fell into the hands of his\r\nrival--Charles, by hereditary descent King of Spain, Naples, and\r\nJerusalem, sovereign, under various titles, of the Netherlands, and by\r\nelection Emperor of Germany--a prince whose vast possessions in both\r\nhemispheres made him at once the wealthiest and most powerful of living\r\nmonarchs. With his unfortunate captivity, all the fanciful schemes of\r\nconquest entertained by the French king fell to the ground. But France\r\nfelt the blow not less keenly than the monarch. One of the most gallant\r\narmies that ever crossed the Alps had been lost. The kingdom was by no\r\nmeans invulnerable, for the capital itself might easily reward a\r\nwell-executed invasion from the side of Flanders. The recuperative\r\nenergies of the country could be put forth to little advantage, so long\r\nas the place of the king--_fons omnis jurisdictionis_, as the French\r\nlegists styled him--was filled by a woman in the capacity of regent.\r\nFrance bade fair to exhibit to the world the inherent weakness of a\r\ndespotism wherein all power, in fact as well as in theory, centres\r\nultimately in the single person of the supreme ruler as autocrat. For it\r\nwas his standing boast that he was \"emperor\" in his own realm, holding\r\nit of none other than God, and responsible to God alone, and that as\r\nking and emperor he had the exclusive right to make ordinances from\r\nwhich no subject could appeal without rendering himself liable to the\r\npenalties pronounced upon traitors.[256] Now that the head was taken\r\naway, who could answer for the harmonious action of the body which had\r\nbeen wont to depend upon him alone for direction?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change in the religious policy of Louise de Savoie.]\r\n\r\nLouise de Savoie, to whom the direction of affairs had been confided\r\nduring her son's absence in Italy, had, for greater convenience,\r\ntransferred the court temporarily to the city of Lyons, where, under the\r\nprotection of Margaret of Angoulême, the most evangelical preachers of\r\nFrance had been allowed to proclaim the tenets of the reformers within\r\nthe churches and in the hearing of thousands of eager listeners. The\r\nqueen mother had not yet ventured decidedly to depart from the tolerant\r\nsystem hitherto pursued by the crown.[257] But the announcement of the\r\ncapture of Francis effected a complete revolution in her policy. There\r\nis no inherent improbability in the story that Chancellor Duprat--the\r\nstatesman and ecclesiastic who had gained so strong an ascendancy over\r\nthe mind of Louise that he was shortly promoted to the Archbishopric of\r\nSens and rewarded with the rich abbey of Saint\r\nBénoit-sur-Loire--insinuated to the queen mother that the misfortunes\r\nbefalling France were tokens of the Divine displeasure. Had Francis\r\nspared no exertions to destroy the first germs of the heresy so\r\ninsidiously introduced into his kingdom, he would not now, said the\r\nchurchman, be languishing in the dungeons of Milan or Madrid. Nor could\r\nhopes be entertained of his deliverance, and of a return of Heaven's\r\nfavor, unless the queen mother bestirred herself to retrieve his mistake\r\nby the introduction of new measures to crush heresy. Thus is the\r\nchancellor said to have argued, and to have earned the cardinal's hat at\r\nthe Pope's hands. However this may be, it is certain that motives of\r\npolicy were no less influential than the pious considerations which,\r\nperhaps, might have carried full as much conviction had they come from\r\nthe lips of a more exemplary prelate.[258] The regent was certainly not\r\nignorant of the fact that the support of Clement the Seventh, now\r\nspecially needed in the delicate diplomacy lying immediately before her,\r\ncould best be secured by proving to the pontiff's satisfaction that the\r\nhouse of Valois was clear of all suspicion of harboring or fostering the\r\n\"Lutheran\" doctrines and their adherents.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary appliances for the suppression of heresy--a duty entrusted\r\nby canon law, so far as the preliminary search and the trial of the\r\nsuspected was concerned, to the bishops and their courts--had\r\nconfessedly proved inadequate. The prelates were in great part\r\nnon-residents, and could not from a distance narrowly watch the progress\r\nof the objectionable tenets in their dioceses. One or two of their\r\nnumber were accused of culpable sluggishness, if not of indifference or\r\nsomething worse. The question naturally arose, What new and more\r\neffective procedure could be devised?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A commission appointed to try \"Lutherans.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter mature deliberation, the privy council resolved upon a plan which\r\nwas virtually to remove the cognizance of crimes against religion from\r\nthe clergy, and commit it to a mixed commission. The Parliament of Paris\r\nwas accordingly notified that the bishop of that city stood ready to\r\ndelegate his authority to conduct the trial of all heretics found within\r\nhis jurisdiction to such persons as parliament might select for the\r\ndischarge of this important function; and the latter body proceeded at\r\nonce to designate two of its own members to act in conjunction with two\r\ndoctors of the Sorbonne, and receive the faculties promised by the\r\nBishop of Paris.[259] A few days later (March 29, 1525), in making a\r\nnecessary substitution for one of the members who was unable to serve,\r\nparliament not only empowered the commission thus constituted to try the\r\n\"Lutheran\" prisoners, Pauvan and Saulnier, but directed the Archbishops\r\nof Lyons and Rheims, and the bishops or chapters of eight of the\r\nremaining most important dioceses, to confer upon it similar authority\r\nto that already received at the hands of the bishop of the\r\nmetropolis.[260]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The commission a new form of inquisition.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inquisition hitherto jealously watched.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no ordinary tribunal which the highest civil court of\r\nthe kingdom was erecting. The commission was in effect nothing less than\r\na new phase of the Inquisition, embodying many of the most obnoxious\r\nfeatures of that detested tribunal. It is true that the \"Holy Office,\"\r\nin a modified form, had existed in France ever since the persecutions\r\ndirected against the Albigenses and the bloody campaigns of Simon de\r\nMontfort. But the seat of the solitary Inquisitor of the Faith was\r\nToulouse, not Paris, and his powers had been jealously circumscribed by\r\nthe courts of justice and the diocesan prelates, both equally interested\r\nin rearing barriers to prevent his incursions into their respective\r\njurisdictions. The Inquisitor of Toulouse was now only a spy and\r\ninformer.[261] Parliament, in particular, had clearly enunciated the\r\nprinciple that neither inquisitor nor bishop had the right to arrest a\r\nsuspected heretic, inasmuch as bodily seizure was the exclusive\r\nprerogative of the officers of the crown. The judges of this supreme\r\ncourt had summoned to their bar a bishop, and his \"official,\" or vicar,\r\nand had exacted from them an explicit disavowal of any intention to\r\narrest, in the case of a person whom they had merely detained, as they\r\nasserted, until such time as they could deliver him into the hands of a\r\ncompetent civil officer.[262] And it had become a maxim of French\r\njurisprudence, that \"an inquisitor of the faith has no power of capture\r\nor arrest, save with the assistance, and by authority, of the secular\r\narm.\"[263]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament breaks down the safeguards of personal liberty.]\r\n\r\nBut the Parliament of Paris, at the instigation of the regent's\r\nadvisers, and with the consent of the bishops, was breaking down these\r\nimportant safeguards of personal liberty. It not only accorded to the\r\nmixed inquisitorial commission, consisting of two lay and two clerical\r\nmembers, the authority to apprehend persons suspected of heresy, but\r\nremoved the proceedings of the commission almost entirely from review\r\nand correction. A pretext for this extraordinary course was found in the\r\ndelays heretofore experienced from the interposition of technical\r\ndifficulties. \"The commissioners,\" said parliament, \"by virtue of the\r\nauthority delegated to them, shall secretly institute inquiries against\r\nthe Lutherans, and shall proceed against them by personal summons, by\r\nbodily arrest, by seizure of goods, and by other penalties. Their\r\ndecisions shall be executed in spite of any and every opposition and\r\nappeal, save in case of the final sentence.\"[264] While conferring such\r\nextravagant privileges, parliament took pains to prescribe that the\r\ndecisions of the commission should be executed precisely as if they had\r\nemanated from the supreme court itself. Such were the lengths to which\r\nthe most conservative judges were willing to go, in the hope of speedily\r\neradicating the reformed doctrines from French soil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The commission endorsed by Clement VII.]\r\n\r\nThe regent and her master-spirit, the chancellor, did not rest here. The\r\ncommission was not irrevocable; and its authority might be disputed. The\r\nwork of parliament must receive the papal sanction. For this Clement the\r\nSeventh did not keep them long waiting. He addressed to parliament (May\r\n20, 1525) a brief conceived in a vein of fulsome eulogy, expressing his\r\nmarvellous commendation of their acts--acts which he declared to be\r\nworthy of the reputation for wisdom in which the French tribunal was\r\njustly held. And he incited the judges to fresh zeal by the\r\nconsideration that the new madness that had fallen upon the world was\r\nprepared to confound and overturn, not religion alone, but all rule,\r\nnobility, pre-eminence and superiority--nay, all law and order. The\r\nreader, it may be feared, will tire of the frequency with which the\r\nsame trite suggestions recur. It is, however, not a little important to\r\nemphasize the argument which the Roman Curia, and its emissaries at the\r\ncourts of kings, were never weary of reiterating in the ears of the rich\r\nand powerful. And as they seized with avidity every slight incident of\r\ndisorder that could by any means be associated with the great religious\r\nmovement now in progress, and presented it as corroboratory proof of the\r\ncharge preferred against the \"Lutherans,\" it is not surprising that they\r\nwere generally successful in their appeal to the fears of a class which\r\nhad so much at stake.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his endorsement of their pious zeal, Clement's brief\r\ninformed the judges of parliament that they would find in the\r\naccompanying bull his formal confirmation of the inquisitorial\r\ncommission.[265]\r\n\r\nThis \"letter with the leaden seal,\" dated the seventeenth of May, might\r\nwell have opened the eyes of less devoted subjects of the Roman See to\r\nthe injury they were inflicting upon the French liberties, heretofore so\r\ncherished an object of judicial solicitude. Addressing itself to the\r\nfour commissioners named by parliament, the bull recited the lamentable\r\nprogress of the doctrines of that \"son of iniquity and heresiarch,\r\nMartin Luther,\" and praised the ardor displayed to stay their\r\ndissemination in France. It next declared that the Pope, by the advice\r\nand with the unanimous consent of the cardinals, instructed the\r\ncommissioners to proceed either singly or collectively against those\r\npersons who had embraced heretical views, \"simply and quietly, without\r\nnoise or form of judgment.\" He empowered them to act independently of\r\nthe prelates of the kingdom and the Inquisitor of the Faith, or to call\r\nin their assistance, as they should see fit. They might summon\r\nwitnesses, under pain of ecclesiastical censures. They might make\r\ninvestigations against and put on trial all those infected with heresy,\r\neven should the guilty be bishops or archbishops in the church, or be\r\nclothed with the ducal authority in the state. When convicted, such\r\npersons were to be punished by arrest and imprisonment, or cut off,\r\n\"like rotten members, from the communion of the church, and consigned\r\nto eternal damnation with Satan and his angels.\" The commissioners were\r\nfurther authorized _to grant permission to any one of the faithful who\r\nchose so to do to invade, occupy, and acquire for himself the lands,\r\ncastles, and goods of the heretics, seizing their persons and leading\r\nthem away into life-long slavery_. From the sentence of the\r\ncommissioners all appeal, even to the \"Apostolic See\" itself, was\r\nexpressly cut off.[266]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its powers enlarged by the papal bull.]\r\n\r\nRome had made one of its most brilliant strokes. While adopting as his\r\nown the commissioners appointed by parliament, Clement had enlarged\r\ntheir already exorbitant prerogatives, and consummated their\r\nindependence of secular interference. A new and more efficient\r\ninquisition was thus introduced into France, with its secret\r\ninvestigation and unlimited power of inflicting punishment. The\r\nParliament of Paris had, however, committed itself too fully to think of\r\ndemurring. Accordingly, it proceeded (June 10th) to enter on its records\r\nboth the regent's letter and the bull of the Pope, to which the letter\r\nenjoined obedience.[267]\r\n\r\nWe have in a previous chapter seen some of the first fruits of the\r\nestablishment of the inquisitorial commission, in the proceedings\r\ninstituted against Lefèvre d'Étaples, Gérard Roussel, and others who\r\ntook part in the attempted reformation of the diocese of Meaux. But,\r\nchief among those whom it was sought to destroy, through the agency of\r\nthe new and well-furbished weapon against heretics, was a nobleman of\r\nArtois, whose repeated and remarkable escapes from the hand of the\r\nexecutioner, viewed in connection with the tragic fate that at last\r\novertook him, invest his story with a romantic interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Louis de Berquin.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He becomes a warm partisan of the Reformation.]\r\n\r\nLouis de Berquin was a man of high rank, whom friends and enemies alike\r\nadmired for his uncommon acuteness of mind and his great attainments in\r\nletters and science. A contemporary Parisian, whose diary has supplied\r\nus more than one of those graphic traits that assist much in bringing\r\nbefore our eyes the living forms of the great actors in the world's past\r\nhistory, seems to have been strongly impressed by the commanding\r\nappearance and elegance of dress of De Berquin, at this time in the very\r\nprime of life.[268] But the great Erasmus, his correspondent, stood in\r\nfar greater admiration of his extraordinary learning, his purity of\r\nlife--a rare excellence in a nobleman of the court of Francis the\r\nFirst--his kindness and freedom from all ostentation, his uncompromising\r\nhatred of every form of meanness and injustice,[269] and a fearless\r\ncourage which, in the eyes of the timid sage of Rotterdam, appeared to\r\nfall little short of foolhardiness. Like most of the really earnest\r\nreformers, De Berquin was originally a very strict observer of the\r\nordinances of the church, and was unsurpassed in attention to fasts,\r\nfeast-days, and the mass. It was indignation and contempt for the petty\r\npersecution inaugurated by Beda and his associates of the Sorbonne that\r\nfirst led him to examine the tenets of Lefèvre. From Lefèvre's works he\r\nnaturally passed to those of the German reformers. His curiosity turning\r\nto admiration, he began to translate and annotate the most striking\r\ntreatises that fell into his hands. Not content with this, he set\r\nhimself to writing books on the same topics, and incidentally depicted\r\nin no flattering colors the intolerance and ignorance of the Paris\r\ntheologians. As he made no attempt at concealment, his activity was soon\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His first imprisonment.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1523, De Berquin's house was visited, his books and\r\npapers were seized, and an inventory was made. Beda was the leader of\r\nthe authorities in the whole affair. Parliament ordered the books and\r\nmanuscripts to be examined and reported upon by the theological faculty.\r\nWhat the report would be, it was not hard to surmise. When such works\r\nwere found in De Berquin's possession as that entitled \"Speculum\r\nTheologastrorum,\" and another giving Luther's reasons for maintaining\r\nthe universal priesthood of Christian believers; when the notes in De\r\nBerquin's own handwriting condemned as blasphemous, and as derogatory to\r\nthe power of the Holy Ghost, the ascription of praise to the Virgin Mary\r\nas the \"fountain of all grace\"--but one answer could be expected to the\r\nrequisition of parliament. The books and manuscripts were pronounced\r\nheretical; their author was commanded to retract. This De Berquin\r\nrefused to do, and he was, consequently, shut up in the\r\n_conciergerie_--the civil prison within the walls of the ancient palace\r\nin which parliament sat. Four days later he was transferred to the\r\ndungeons of the Bishop of Paris, to be judged by him with the aid of two\r\ncounsellors of parliament and of such theologians as he should see fit\r\nto call in.[270]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is released by order of the king.]\r\n\r\nThe case was fast becoming serious. De Berquin was made of sterner stuff\r\nthan the weaklings who recant through fear of the stake; and the syndic\r\nof Sorbonne was fully resolved to have him burned if he remained\r\nconstant. Happily, just at this critical moment the king interfered.\r\nFrom Melun, which he had reached on his way toward the south of France,\r\nhe despatched an officer--one \"Captain Frederick,\" as his name appears\r\nin the records--to demand the release of De Berquin, whose trial he had\r\nevoked for the consideration of his own royal council. Parliament\r\nattempted to interpose technical difficulties, and responded that the\r\nprisoner was no longer in its keeping. But \"Captain Frederick\" was\r\nprovided against any quibbling. As his instructions were to break open\r\nwhatever prison-doors might be barred against him, it was not long\r\nbefore the expected prey of the theologians was given into his custody.\r\nIn the end De Berquin was set at liberty, such an examination of his\r\ncase having been made by the king's council as courtiers are wont to\r\ninstitute when the accused is the favorite of the monarch.[271]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advice of Erasmus.]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Erasmus first made the acquaintance of\r\nLouis de Berquin. The Artesian nobleman took occasion to write to the\r\ngreat Dutch humanist, of whom he stood in great admiration, to inform\r\nhim of the position assumed in reference to the writings of the latter\r\nby Beda and Du Chesne. Erasmus tells us that he was delighted with his\r\nnew correspondent. But the constitutional timidity of the scholar\r\ncompelled him to answer De Berquin by words of caution rather than of\r\nencouragement: \"If you are wise, repress your encomiums; do not disturb\r\nthe _hornets_, and spend your time in your favorite studies. At all\r\nevents, do not involve me; for the consequences might be inconvenient\r\nfor us both.\" But the dictates of worldly wisdom had no influence over\r\nDe Berquin. Presently Erasmus was vexed to find that De Berquin in his\r\nwritings was appealing to his friend's authority, and quoting the\r\nsentiments of the latter in defence of his own opinions. Now thoroughly\r\nalarmed at De Berquin's imprudence, Erasmus remonstrated, plainly\r\nintimating that whatever delight others might derive from conflicts such\r\nas he saw approaching, nothing was less grateful to himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Berquin's second imprisonment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis again orders his release.]\r\n\r\nMeantime Louis de Berquin had retired to his own estates, in the\r\nexpectation of pursuing his plans with less danger of interference than\r\nin the capital. Even there, however, he was not safe. The propitious\r\nmoment for striking a decisive blow seemed to his enemies to have come\r\nwhen, the king being a captive, his mother, the regent, had permitted\r\nPope and parliament to erect a tribunal for the summary trial and\r\nexecution of heretics. The Bishop of Amiens, in whose diocese De\r\nBerquin's lands were situated, having applied to parliament, easily\r\nobtained the authority to seize him, disregarding even the ordinary\r\nrights of asylum.[272] After his arrest he was again transferred from\r\nthe episcopal palace to the _conciergerie_ at Paris, and his trial\r\nentrusted to the new inquisitorial commission. A series of propositions\r\nextracted from his writings, and censured by the Sorbonne, insured his\r\ncondemnation as a relapsed heretic, and De Berquin was handed over to\r\nthe secular arm for condign punishment. But again, at the very instant\r\nwhen his ruin was imminent, he met with unexpected deliverance. The\r\nsympathy of the king's sister was enlisted, and she used her influence\r\nwith her mother to obtain an order adjourning all proceedings against De\r\nBerquin until the monarch should be released. Meanwhile she wrote urgent\r\nletters in his behalf to Francis and to his favorite, the grand master\r\nof the palace and future constable of France, Anne de Montmorency. The\r\nreply came in an order from the king, at Madrid, directing his\r\nparliament to cease from giving disturbance to Berquin and such men of\r\nlearning.[273]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dilatory measures of parliament.]\r\n\r\nIt is suggestive of the delays attending even the execution of the will\r\nof so arbitrary a prince as Francis, that, although De Berquin was thus\r\ndelivered from the immediate prospect of death, months passed before he\r\nregained his liberty. Successive royal orders were required to secure\r\nany alleviation of his hard confinement. Thus, when his health suffered\r\nfrom want of exercise and pure air, parliament grudgingly permitted him\r\nto leave his solitary cell for an hour morning and evening, at such time\r\nas the court might be clear of other prisoners whom he could\r\ncontaminate. And when De Berquin complained that his books and writing\r\nmaterials had been denied him, the extent of the parliament's generosity\r\nwas to grant him \"the epistles of St. Jerome and some other Catholic\r\nbooks.\" At length, the king's patience becoming exhausted by the court's\r\nprocrastination and technical objections, he sent (November 21, 1526)\r\nthe Provost of Paris forcibly to remove De Berquin from the\r\n_conciergerie_ to the Louvre, where he was soon restored his\r\nfreedom.[274]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hopes of Margaret of Angoulême.]\r\n\r\nThe return of Francis from Madrid, and the rescue of Berquin, Lefèvre,\r\nRoussel, and others, from the dangers to which they had been exposed,\r\nencouraged the more sanguine reformers to hope that now at length the\r\nking would declare himself openly in favor, if not of the evangelical\r\ndoctrines, at least of some form of religions toleration. Margaret of\r\nAngoulême had certainly labored piously and assiduously to open her\r\nbrother's eyes to the true character of his fanatical advisers. In a\r\nletter still preserved and apparently written even before Francis had\r\nbeen removed from Italy to Spain, she begged him to regard his\r\nmisfortune as only a mark of the Divine love, and intended to give him\r\ntime for reflection and consecration. This end being accomplished,\r\nHeaven would gloriously deliver him and make him a blessing to all\r\nChristendom--nay, even to infidel nations to be converted by his\r\nmeans.[275]\r\n\r\nHowever fanciful these brilliant anticipations may now appear, they did\r\nnot seem unreasonable at the time. It was not improbable that the\r\nexample of the illustrious German princes, his allies, who had embraced\r\nthe Reformation, might incline Francis decidedly to the same side.\r\nMargaret had conceived great expectations, based upon a projected visit\r\nto the French court by Count Von Hohenlohe, Dean of the Cathedral of\r\nStrasbourg--a nobleman, who, having become a Protestant, was anxious to\r\nturn to the advantage of his new convictions the influence secured to\r\nhim by high social rank. The correspondence of Francis's sister with the\r\nzealous German noble opens a suggestive page of history. At first,\r\nMargaret, while applauding the count's design and building great hopes\r\nupon it, advises him to defer his visit until the king's return from\r\nSpain. Two months later, she is even more anxious to see Hohenlohe in\r\nParis, but feels constrained to tell him that his friends have, for a\r\ncertain reason, concluded that the proper time has not yet arrived. A\r\nthird letter, dated after the restoration of Francis to his throne,\r\ninforms us what that certain reason was. \"I cannot tell you all the\r\ngrief I feel,\" Margaret writes, \"for I clearly see that the state of\r\nthings is such that your coming cannot be productive of the comfort you\r\nwould desire. The king would not be glad to see you. The reason that\r\nyour visit is deemed inadvisable is _the deliverance of the king's\r\nchildren, which the king esteems as important as the deliverance of his\r\nown person_.\"[276]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis I. violates his pledges to Charles V.]\r\n\r\nHere was the secret! Unfortunately for the Reformation, policy was\r\nsupposed to make it an imperative duty to conciliate the favor of the\r\nPope, no less after the release of Francis than while he was yet a\r\nprisoner. There were the young princes sent by the regent as hostages\r\nfor the fulfilment of the treaty with Charles of Spain, for whose\r\nliberation measures were to be devised. And there was the oath--to the\r\nshame of Francis, it must be added--from the binding force of which the\r\nking hoped to be relieved by authority of the Roman bishop; for scarcely\r\nhad Francis set foot on his own dominions, when he unblushingly\r\nretracted all his treaty stipulations. He announced to the emperor that\r\nthe cession of Burgundy, the Viscounty of Auxonne, and other\r\nterritories, which had been made by his imperial captor the\r\nindispensable condition of his release, was entirely out of the\r\nquestion; and that his promises, extorted while he was in duress, were\r\nof no validity! Nevertheless, he offered, in lieu thereof, the payment\r\nof a larger ransom than had ever been proffered by a king of France.\r\nIndignant at a perfidy somewhat flagrant, even for an age tolerably well\r\naccustomed to breaches of faith, the emperor refused the substitute. The\r\narms recently laid aside were resumed. Clement the Seventh and Venice\r\nbecame the allies of Francis, who for the present figured as the\r\nchampion of the papacy; while his rival, by suffering the traitor\r\nConstable de Bourbon with an army of German soldiers to besiege the\r\npontiff in his capital, became responsible in the eyes of the world for\r\nall the atrocities of the famous sack of the city of Rome. When, at\r\nlength, after three years of hard fighting, peace was concluded by the\r\ntreaty of Cambray (July, 1529), the terms agreed upon at Madrid were\r\nvirtually carried into effect; but the emperor consented to receive the\r\nsum of two millions of Crowns--_êcus-au-soleil_--in place of Burgundy,\r\nand on payment to restore to the French the dauphin and the Duke of\r\nOrleans, the future Henry the Second, so long detained as hostages in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king's necessities.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A despotic course suggested.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the revenues of the royal domain, having during the late wars\r\nbeen subjected to a long and unremitting drain, had proved utterly\r\ninadequate to meet the extraordinary demand of treasure for the\r\nresumption of the hostilities following close upon Francis's release.\r\nRecourse must be had to the purses of the king's subjects. The right to\r\nlevy taxes resided in the States General alone, and Francis was\r\nreluctant, at so critical a juncture, to trample on a time-hallowed\r\nprinciple. He did not, indeed, hesitate to admit that he had been\r\ngravely counselled by some of his advisers to resort to a more despotic\r\ncourse; for they maintained that, in so praiseworthy an undertaking as\r\nthe effort to recover the young princes, the king was warranted by all\r\nlaws, divine and human, in laying under contribution every one of his\r\nsubjects, of whatever rank or condition.[277] But, as the same ends\r\nmight be attained by methods more agreeable to law and precedent,\r\nFrancis preferred to have recourse to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An assembly of notables.]\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of December, 1527, one of those anomalous political\r\nbodies was convened in the palace of the Parisian parliament to which\r\nthe name of an assembly of notables is given. All the orders of the\r\nstate were represented; but the form of a meeting of the States General\r\n(as we have seen, most distasteful to the despotic monarch) was\r\nstudiously avoided.[278] In reply to a very full exposition of the\r\npresent condition of the kingdom and of the incidents of his capture,\r\nmade by Francis in person to the assembled clergymen, nobles, jurists,\r\nand burgesses of Paris, each order in turn gave its opinion. All united\r\nin approving the refusal of the king to surrender Burgundy to the\r\nemperor, and in expressing their unwillingness to allow his Majesty to\r\nreturn to Spain and thus redeem the promise he had given in case the\r\ntreaty failed to be carried into effect. All likewise professed their\r\nreadiness to contribute, according to their ability, to the necessities\r\nof the crown.\r\n\r\nThe first president, M. de Selve, in the name of parliament, delivered a\r\ndiscourse which the clerk of the assembly, no doubt aptly, describes as\r\n\"_crammed_ with Latin and with quotations from Scripture, to prove that\r\nthe treaty of Madrid was null and void.\"[279] His grounds were that the\r\nking could neither dispose of his own person, which belonged to the\r\nstate, nor alienate Burgundy, which, being a fief of the first rank and\r\na bulwark of the kingdom, was inseparable from France. But probably the\r\nwhole prodigious mass of classic lore, and of scriptural quotation, even\r\nmore unfamiliar to most of his hearers, which the pedantic president\r\nforced upon the digestion of the unfortunate notables, was required to\r\nprove to their satisfaction that Francis had in this affair played the\r\npart of the \"gentilhomme\" he boasted of being.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of the Cardinal of Bourbon.]\r\n\r\nThe speech of the Cardinal of Bourbon was especially important. He\r\nannounced the willingness of the representatives of the French clergy\r\ncheerfully to supply the 1,300,000 livres asked of their order, although\r\nat the same time he suggested the propriety of first convoking\r\nprovincial councils, in which the church might be more fully consulted.\r\nWith this gracious concession, however, the cardinal coupled three\r\nrequests, of which the first and third concerned the liberation of the\r\nPope from his imprisonment and the conservation of the liberties of the\r\nGallican church; but the second had a pointed reference to the\r\nReformation: he prayed \"that the king might be pleased to uproot and\r\nextirpate the damnable and insufferable Lutheran sect which had, not\r\nlong since, secretly entered the realm, with all the other heresies that\r\nwere multiplying therein.\" By thus acting, he assured him, Francis\r\n\"would perform the duty of a good prince bearing the name of _Very\r\nChristian King_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis promises to prove himself \"Very Christian.\"]\r\n\r\nThe gratified monarch, delighted with the complaisance of his clerical\r\nsubjects, did not hesitate to accede to all the petitions the Cardinal\r\noffered, and declared that, \"so far as concerned heresies, he was\r\ndetermined not to endure them, but would cause them to be wholly\r\nextirpated and driven from his kingdom,\" inflicting on any found tainted\r\ntherewith such exemplary punishment as to demonstrate his right to the\r\nhonorable title he bore.[280]\r\n\r\nIt was a rash promise that Francis had made. Like many other absolute\r\nmonarchs, he expected without trouble to bring the religious convictions\r\nof his subjects into conformity with the standard he was pleased to set\r\nup.[281] He had yet to learn that there are beliefs which, when they\r\ntake root in the hearts of humble and illiterate peasants or artisans,\r\nare too firmly fixed to be eradicated by the most excruciating tortures\r\nman's ingenuity has been able to contrive. Through fire and sword, the\r\nvictim now of persecution, again of open war, the faith denominated\r\nheresy was yet to survive, not only the last lineal descendant of the\r\nking then sitting on the throne of France, but the rule of the dynasty\r\nwhich was destined to succeed to the power, and reproduce not a few of\r\nthe mistakes, of the Valois race.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The provincial council of Sens.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the suggestion of the Cardinal of Bourbon, three\r\nprovincial councils were held early in the ensuing year (1528). The most\r\nimportant was the council of the ecclesiastical province of _Sens_,\r\nwhich met, however, in the Augustinian monastery at Paris. It was\r\nscarcely to be expected that a synod presided over by Antoine Duprat,\r\nwho, to the dignity of cardinal and the office of Chancellor of France,\r\nadded the Bishopric of Albi and the Archbishopric of Sens, with the\r\nclaim to be Primate of the Gauls and of Germany, should discuss with\r\nseverity the morals of the clergy, or issue stringent canons against the\r\nabuse of the plurality of benefices. As an offset, however, the Council\r\nof Sens had much to say respecting the new reformation. The good fathers\r\nsaw in the discordant views of Luther and Carlstadt, of Melanchthon and\r\nZwingle, proof positive that the new doctrines the reformers advanced\r\nwere devoid of any basis of truth. They ridiculed the claim of the\r\nProtestants to the presence of the Spirit of God. But they reserved\r\ntheir severest censures for the practice of holding secret conventicles,\r\nand, with an irony best appreciated by those who understand the\r\npenalties inflicted by the law on the discovered heretics, they gently\r\nreminded the men and women to whom the celebration of a single religious\r\nservice according to the dictates of their conscience would have insured\r\ninstantaneous condemnation and a death at the stake, that God hates the\r\ndeeds of darkness, and that Christ himself said, \"What I tell you in\r\ndarkness, that speak ye in light.\"[282]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The punishment of heretics.]\r\n\r\nMore practical were the prescriptions of the council's decrees\r\nrespecting the punishment of offenders against the unity of the faith.\r\nHeretics who, after conviction, refused to be \"united to the church,\"\r\nwere to be consigned to prison for life, priests to be degraded, the\r\nrelapsed to be given over to the secular arm without a hearing.\r\nHeretical books, including translations of the Bible, were to be\r\nsurrendered to the bishop. Indeed, it was stipulated that every book\r\ntreating of the faith, and printed within the past twenty years, should\r\nbe submitted to him for examination. Nor was the council satisfied to\r\nleave the discovery of heresy to accident. It was particularly enjoined\r\nupon every bishop that he, or some competent person appointed by him,\r\nshould visit any portion of his diocese in which the taint of unsound\r\ndoctrine was reported to exist, and compel three or more persons of good\r\nstanding, or even the entire body of the inhabitants of a neighborhood,\r\nto denounce under oath those who entertained heretical views, the\r\nfrequenters of secret conventicles, and even those who merely held aloof\r\nfrom the conversation of the faithful. Lest this stimulus to informers\r\nshould prove insufficient to extract the desired knowledge, the threat\r\nwas added that persons refusing to testify would be treated as\r\nsuspected, and themselves proceeded against.[283]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The councils of Bourges and Lyons.]\r\n\r\nNot less severe toward the \"Lutheran\" doctrines did the other two\r\nprovincial councils show themselves. At the Council of Bourges, the\r\nCardinal of Tournon presided as archbishop--a prelate who was to attain\r\nunenviable notoriety as the prime instigator of the massacre of Mérindol\r\nand Cabrières, of which an account will be given in a subsequent\r\nchapter. Besides the usual regulations for the censure of heretical\r\nbooks and the denunciation of \"Lutherans,\" the decrees contain the\r\nsignificant direction that the professors in the University of Bourges\r\nshall employ in their instructions no authors calculated to divert the\r\nstudents from the ceremonies of the church--a caution deriving its\r\nimportance from the circumstance that the university, under the\r\npatronage of Margaret of Angoulême, now Duchess of Berry as well as\r\nQueen of Navarre, had become a centre of reformatory activity.\r\n\r\nThe letter in which the king had called upon the Archbishop of Lyons to\r\nconvene the clergy of his province, declared that Francis had ever held\r\nthe accursed sect of the \"Lutherans\" in hatred, horror, and abomination,\r\nand that its extirpation was an object very near his heart, for the\r\naccomplishment of which he would employ all possible means;[284] and the\r\nCouncil of Lyons responded by cordial approval and by the enactment of\r\nfresh regulations to suppress conventicles, to prevent the farther\r\ndissemination of Luther's writings, and, indeed, to forbid all\r\ndiscussion of matters of faith by the laity. At the same time the\r\ncouncil unconsciously revealed the necessity imposed on the private\r\nChristian to investigate for himself the nature and grounds of his\r\nbelief, by strongly reprobating the disastrous custom of admitting into\r\nsacred orders a host of illiterate, uncultivated persons of low\r\nantecedents--beardless youths--and by confessing that this wretched\r\npractice had justly excited the contempt of the world.[285]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial help bought by persecution.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere the clergy conceded the subsidy required by the exigencies of\r\nthe kingdom. But they left Francis in no doubt respecting the price of\r\ntheir complaisance. This was nothing less than the extermination of the\r\nnew sect that had made its appearance in France. And the king\r\ncomprehended and fell in with the terms upon which the church agreed to\r\nloosen its purse-strings. No doubtful policy must now prevail! No more\r\nBerquins can be permitted to make their boast that they have been able,\r\nprotected by the king's panoply, to beard the lion in his den!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insult to an image.]\r\n\r\nAn incident occurring in Paris, before the adjournment of the Council of\r\nSens, gave Francis a specious excuse for inaugurating the more cruel\r\nsystem of persecution now demanded of him, and tended somewhat to\r\nconceal from the king himself, as well as from others, the mercenary\r\nmotive of the change. Just after the solemnities of Whitsunday, an\r\nunheard of act of impiety startled the inhabitants of the capital, and\r\nfully persuaded them that no object of their devotions was safe from\r\niconoclastic violence. One of those numerous statues of the Virgin Mary,\r\nwith the infant Jesus in her arms, that graced the streets of Paris, was\r\nfound to have been shockingly mutilated. The body had been pierced, and\r\nthe head-dress trampled under foot. The heads of the mother and child\r\nhad been broken off and ignominiously thrown in the rubbish.[286] A more\r\nflagrant act of contempt for the religious sentiment of the country had\r\nperhaps never been committed. The indignation it awakened must not be\r\njudged by the standard of a calmer age.[287] In the desire to ascertain\r\nthe perpetrators of the outrage, the king offered a reward of a thousand\r\ncrowns. But no ingenuity could ferret them out. A vague rumor, indeed,\r\nprevailed, that a similar excess had been witnessed in a village four or\r\nfive leagues distant, and that the culprits when detected had confessed\r\nthat they had been prompted to its commission by the promise of a paltry\r\nrecompense of one hundred _sous_ for every image destroyed. But, since\r\nno one seems ever to have been punished, it is probable that this report\r\nwas a fabrication; and the question whether the mutilation of the Virgin\r\nof the _Rue des Rosiers_ was the deliberate act of a religious\r\nenthusiast, or a freak of drunken revellers, or, as some imagined, a\r\ncunning device of good Catholics to inflame the popular passions\r\nagainst the \"Lutherans,\" must, for the present, at least, remain a\r\nsubject of profound doubt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expiatory processions.]\r\n\r\nBut, whoever may have been the author, pains were taken to expiate the\r\nsacrilege. Successive processions visited the spot. In one of these,\r\nfive hundred students of the university, chosen from different colleges\r\nand belonging to the first families, bore lighted tapers, which they\r\nplaced on the temporary altar erected in front of the image. The clergy,\r\nboth secular and regular, came repeatedly with all that was most\r\nprecious in attire and relics. To add still more to the pomp of the\r\npropitiatory pilgrimages, Francis himself took part in a magnificent\r\ndisplay, made on the _Fête-Dieu_, or Corpus Christi (the eleventh of\r\nJune). He was preceded by heralds and by the Dukes of Cleves and Ferrara\r\nand other noblemen of high rank, while behind him walked the King of\r\nNavarre, the Cardinal of Lorraine, the Ambassadors of England, Venice,\r\nFlorence, and other foreign states, the officers of parliament, and a\r\ncrowd of gentlemen of the king's house, archers and persons of all\r\nconditions bringing up the rear. On reaching the spot where the\r\nmutilated statue still occupied its niche, Francis, after appropriate\r\nreligious exercises, ascended the richly carpeted steps, and reverently\r\nsubstituted an effigy in solid silver, of similar size, in place of the\r\nimage which had been the object of insult.[288]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other icoconoclastic excesses.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, iconoclastic demonstrations became more common.\r\nPaintings, also, when exposed to the public view, shared the perils to\r\nwhich unprotected statues were subjected. The Virgin, and such reputable\r\nsaints as St. Roch and St. Fiacre, depicted on the walls of the Rue St.\r\nMartin, were wantonly disfigured, some two years later; so that at last,\r\nthe Parliament of Paris, in despair of preventing the repetition of the\r\nact, or of discovering its authors, adopted the prudent course of\r\nforbidding that any sacred representation should be placed on the\r\nexterior walls of a house _within ten feet of the ground_![289]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Berquin's third arrest.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He disregards the cautions of Erasmus.]\r\n\r\nThe repeated assurances whereby Francis had conciliated the clergy, and\r\nsecured their contributions to the exchequer, embarrassed him in the\r\nexercise of leniency toward Louis de Berquin, now for the third time\r\narraigned for heresy. Moreover, the audacity and violence of the\r\niconoclasts, characteristics assumed by him to be indicative of a\r\ndisposition to overturn all government, probably took away any\r\ninclination he would otherwise have had to interfere in the intrepid\r\nnobleman's behalf. De Berquin had no sooner been released from his\r\nformer imprisonment than he set himself to prepare for new conflicts\r\nwith his bigoted antagonists. He even resolved to assume the offensive.\r\nIn vain did Erasmus entreat him to be prudent, suggest the propriety of\r\nhis temporarily going abroad, and propose that he should apply for some\r\ndiplomatic commission as a plausible excuse for absenting himself. Beda,\r\nhe told him, was a monster with many heads, each breathing out poison,\r\nwhile in the \"Faculty\" he had to do with an _immortal_ antagonist. The\r\nmonks would secure his ruin were his cause more righteous than that of\r\nJesus Christ. Finally, the tremulous scholar begged him, if no\r\nconsideration of personal safety moved him, at least not to involve so\r\nardent a lover of peace as Erasmus in a conflict for which he had no\r\ntaste. But his reasoning had no weight with a man of high resolve and\r\ninflexible principle, who could see no honorable course but openly\r\nmeeting and overthrowing error. \"Do you ask,\" wrote Erasmus to a\r\ncorrespondent interested in learning De Berquin's fate, \"what I\r\naccomplished? By every means I employed to deter him I only added to his\r\ncourage.\"[290] If we may believe Erasmus's strong expressions--for his\r\nown writings have very nearly disappeared--De Berquin assailed the monks\r\nwith a freedom almost equal to that employed by the Old Comedy in\r\nholding up to merited derision the foibles of Athenian generals and\r\nstatesmen. He even extracted twelve blasphemous propositions from Beda's\r\nutterances, and obtained a letter from the king enjoining the Sorbonne\r\neither to pass sentence of condemnation on their syndic's assertions, or\r\nto prove their truth from the Holy Scriptures.[291] The Dutch\r\nphilosopher, aghast at his friend's incredible temerity, besought him\r\ninstantly to seek safety in flight; and, when this last appeal proved as\r\nineffectual as all his frequent efforts in the past, he confessed that\r\nhe almost regretted that a friendship had ever arisen which had\r\noccasioned him so much trouble and disquiet.[292]\r\n\r\nA third time Louis de Berquin was arrested, on application of the\r\nofficer known as the _Promoteur de la foi_. His trial was committed to\r\ntwelve judges selected by parliament, among whom figured not only the\r\nfirst president and the vicar-general of the Bishop of Paris, but,\r\nstrange to say, even so well-disposed and liberal a jurist as Guillaume\r\nBudé, the foremost French scholar of the age for broad and accurate\r\nlearning.[293] The case advanced too slowly to meet De Berquin's\r\nimpatience. In the assurance of ultimate success, he is even accused by\r\na contemporary chronicler of having offered the court two hundred crowns\r\nto expedite the trial.[294] It soon became evident, however, from, the\r\nwithdrawal of the liberties at first accorded, that Be Berquin would\r\nscarcely escape unless the king again interposed--a contingency less\r\nlikely to occur in view of the incessant appeals with which Francis was\r\nplied, addressed at once to his interest, his conscience, and his pride.\r\nBut the more desperate the cause of Berquin, and the more uncertain the\r\nking's disposition, the more urgent the intercessions of Margaret of\r\nAngoulême, whose character is nowhere seen to better advantage than in\r\nher repeated letters to her brother about this time.[295]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Berquin sentenced to public penance, branding, and\r\nimprisonment.]\r\n\r\nThe sentence was rendered on the sixteenth of April, 1529. De Berquin,\r\nbeing found guilty of heresy, was condemned to do public penance in\r\nfront of Notre Dame, with lighted taper in hand, and crying for mercy to\r\nGod and the blessed Virgin. Next, on the Place de Grève, he was to be\r\nignominiously exhibited upon a scaffold, while his books were burned\r\nbefore his eyes. Taken thence in a cart to the pillory, and again\r\nexposed to popular derision on a revolving stage, he was to have his\r\ntongue pierced and his forehead branded with the ineffaceable\r\n_fleur-de-lis_. His public disgrace over, De Berquin was to be\r\nimprisoned for life in the episcopal jail.[296]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He appeals, is sentenced to death, and is executed.]\r\n\r\nMore than twenty thousand persons--so intense a hatred had been stirred\r\nup against the reformers--assembled to witness the execution of a\r\nsentence malignantly cruel.[297] But, for that day, their expectation\r\nwas disappointed. Louis de Berquin gave notice that he appealed to the\r\nabsent king and to the Pope himself. It was no part of the programme,\r\nhowever, that the thrice-convicted heresiarch should gain a fresh\r\nrespite and enlist powerful friends in effecting his release. No sooner\r\nwere the judges satisfied that he persisted in his appeal, in spite of\r\nthe secret and urgent advice of Budé and others, than they rendered a\r\nnew and more severe sentence (on the seventeenth of April): he must pay\r\nthe forfeit of his obstinacy with his life, and that, too, within a few\r\nhours.[298]\r\n\r\nThe cause of this intemperate haste is clearly set forth by a\r\ncontemporary--doubtless an eye-witness of the execution--all whose\r\nsympathies were on the side of the prosecution. It was \"lest recourse be\r\nhad to the king, or to the regent then at Blois;\"[299] for the delay of\r\neven a few days might have brought from the banks of the Loire another\r\norder removing De Berquin's case from the commission to the royal\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe historian must leave to the professed martyrologist the details of\r\nthe constant death of Louis de Berquin, as of the deaths of many other\r\nless distinguished victims of the intolerant zeal of the Sorbonne.\r\nSuffice it to say that although, when he undertook to address the\r\npeople, his voice was purposely drowned by the din of the attendants,\r\nthough the very children filled the air with shouts that De Berquin was\r\na heretic, though not a person was found in the vast concourse to\r\nencourage him by the name of \"Jesus\"--an accustomed cry even at the\r\nexecution of parricides--the brave nobleman of Artois met his fate with\r\nsuch composure as to be likened by a by-stander to a student immersed in\r\nhis favorite occupations, or a worshipper whose devout mind was\r\nengrossed by the contemplation of heavenly things.[300] There were\r\nindeed blind rumors, as usual in such cases; to the effect that De\r\nBerquin recanted at the last moment; and Merlin, the Penitentiary of\r\nNotre Dame, who attended him, is reported to have exclaimed that\r\n\"perhaps no one for a hundred years had died a better Christian.\"[301]\r\nBut the \"Lutherans\" of Paris had good reason to deny the truth of the\r\nformer statement, and to interpret the latter to the advantage of De\r\nBerquin's consistent faith--so great was the rejoicing over the final\r\nsuccess attained in crushing the most distinguished, in silencing the\r\nboldest and most outspoken advocate of the reformation of the church.\r\nFor, in the eyes of the theological faculty and of the clergy of France,\r\nLouis de Berquin merited to be styled, by way of pre-eminence, a\r\n_heresiarch_.[302]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis treats with the Germans.]\r\n\r\nThree years had not elapsed since the blow struck at the \"Lutheran\"\r\ndoctrines in France, in the execution of their most promising and\r\nintrepid representative, before the hopes of the friends of the\r\nReformation again revived from a consideration of the king's political\r\nrelations. Disappointed at the contemptuous reception of their\r\nconfession of faith by the Emperor at Augsburg, the Protestant princes\r\nof Germany had formed a defensive league. Francis, having basely\r\nabandoned his former allies, was left alone to combat the gigantic power\r\nof a rival between two portions of whose dominions his own kingdom lay\r\nexposed. Every consideration of prudence dictated the policy of lending\r\nto the German Protestants, in their endeavor to humble the pride of\r\ntheir common antagonist, the most efficient support of his arms. Under\r\nthese circumstances religious differences were impotent to prevent the\r\nunion. Accordingly, in May, 1532, through his ambassador, the sagacious\r\nDu Bellay, Francis promised the discontented Elector of Saxony and his\r\nassociates the contribution of a large sum to enable them to make a\r\nsturdy resistance. But the peace shortly concluded with Charles rendered\r\nthe proffered aid for a time unnecessary.[303]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and with Henry VIII. of England.]\r\n\r\nEqually unproductive of advantage to the professors of the reformed\r\nfaith was the alliance for mutual defence between Francis and Henry the\r\nEighth of England. Both monarchs were inspired with the same hatred of\r\nthe emperor, and each had equal reason to complain of the insatiable\r\nrapacity of the Roman court. But neither at the pompous interview of the\r\ntwo kings at Boulogne, nor afterward, could Henry prevail upon Francis\r\nto take any decided measures against the Pope such as the former, weary\r\nof the obstacles thrown in the way of his divorce from Catharine of\r\nAragon, was ready to venture. In his intercourse with the English king,\r\nFrancis is said to have adopted for his guiding principle the motto,\r\n\"_Ami jusqu'à l'autel_,\"[304] and declined to sacrifice his orthodoxy to\r\nhis interests. But the truth was that, in the view of Francis, his\r\ninterests and his orthodoxy were coincident; and the difficulty\r\nexperienced by the two kings in coming to a common understanding lay in\r\nthe fact that, as has been well remarked, while in the enmity of Francis\r\nit was not the Pope but the emperor that occupied the foremost place, it\r\nwas just the reverse with Henry.[305]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meeting of Francis I. and Clement, at Marseilles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage of Henry of Orleans to Catharine de' Medici.]\r\n\r\nFrancis had no thought of throwing away so valuable an auxiliary in his\r\nItalian projects, or of permanently attaching to Charles so dangerous an\r\nopponent as the papal power. And thus it happened that, a year from the\r\ntime of his consultation with Henry, Francis proceeded to Marseilles to\r\nextend a still more cordial welcome to Clement himself. The wily pontiff\r\nhad so dazzled the eyes of the king, that the latter had consented to,\r\nif he had not actually proposed, a marriage between Henry, Duke of\r\nOrleans, his second son, and Catharine de' Medici, the Pope's\r\nniece.[306] The match was not flattering to Francis's pride; but there\r\nwere great prospective advantages, and the bride was less objectionable\r\nbecause the bridegroom, as a younger son, was not likely to ascend the\r\nthrone. But here again the king was destined to be disappointed.\r\nClement's death, soon after, destroyed all hope of Medicean support in\r\nItaly; and the death of Francis, the dauphin, made Henry of Orleans\r\nheir apparent to the throne. It was not long before the French people,\r\nwith the soundness of judgment generally characterizing the deliberate\r\nconclusions reached by the masses, came to the opinion, expressed by one\r\nof the Venetian ambassadors two years after the wedding: \"Monseigneur of\r\nOrleans is married to Madam Catharine de' Medici, to the dissatisfaction\r\nof all France; for it seems to everybody that the most Christian king\r\nwas cheated by Pope Clement.\"[307] Such were the evil auspices under\r\nwhich the Italian girl, only fourteen years of age,[308] entered a\r\ncountry over whose destinies she was to exert a pernicious influence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis refuses to join in a crusade against heresy.]\r\n\r\nThere was another part of the Pope's designs in the execution of which\r\nhe was less successful. He could not persuade Francis to join in a\r\ngeneral scheme for the extermination of heresy. In the very first\r\ninterview, Clement had sounded his host's disposition respecting the\r\npropriety of a new crusade. He had bluntly submitted for consideration\r\nthe question, \"Ought not Francis and the pious princes of Germany, with\r\nthe emperor at their head, to gather up their forces, enlist troops, and\r\nmake all needful preparations, to overwhelm the followers of Zwingle and\r\nLuther; in order that, affrighted by the terrible retribution visited\r\nupon their fellows, the remaining heretics should hasten to make their\r\nsubmission to the Roman Church?\" At the same time he threw out hints of\r\nhis ability to assist in the good work if only the French monarch would\r\nnot refuse his co-operation. But Francis was not ready for so sanguinary\r\nan undertaking. Unmoved by the Pope's repeated solicitations, he replied\r\nthat it seemed to him that \"neither piety nor concord would be promoted\r\nby substituting an appeal to arms for the appeal to the Holy Scriptures,\r\nto whose ultimate decision both Zwinglians and Lutherans professed\r\nthemselves at all times anxious to submit their doctrines and practice.\"\r\nHe added the unpalatable advice that the matters in dispute be\r\nconsidered by a free and impartial council, and declared that, when the\r\ncouncil had rendered its verdict, he would spare no pains to sustain it.\r\nAll the usual pontifical artifices proved abortive. Francis, while\r\nvaluing highly the friendship of Rome, was not willing to forego the\r\nadvantages of alliance with the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of\r\nHesse.[309]\r\n\r\nWhile the fickle monarch was thus drawn in opposite directions by\r\nconflicting political considerations--at one time strengthening the\r\nhands of the Protestant princes of Germany, at another, making common\r\ncause with the Pope--the same diversity characterized the internal\r\ncondition of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Jean de Caturce at Toulouse.]\r\n\r\nAt Toulouse, the seat of one of most noted parliaments, Jean de Caturce,\r\na lawyer of ability, was put to death by slow fire in the summer of\r\n1532. His unpardonable offence was that he had once made a \"Lutheran\"\r\nexhortation, and that, in the merry-making on the _Fête des\r\nRois_--Epiphany--he had recommended that the prayer, \"May Christ reign\r\nin our hearts!\" be substituted for the senseless cry, \"The king drinks!\"\r\nNo more ample ground of accusation was needed in a city where the\r\nluckless wight who failed to take off his cap before an image, or fall\r\non his knees when the bell rang out at \"Ave Maria,\" was sure to be set\r\nupon as a heretic.[310]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Le Coq's evangelical sermon.]\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast with the tragedy enacted in the chief city of the\r\nsouth was the favor openly showed to the reformers by the Queen of\r\nNavarre, not only in her own city of Bourges, but in Paris itself. The\r\nintercessions she had addressed to her brother for the victims of\r\npriestly persecution had long since betrayed her secret leaning; and the\r\ntranslation of her \"Hours\" into French by the Bishop of Senlis, who, by\r\nher direction, suppressed all that most directly countenanced\r\nsuperstitious beliefs, was naturally taken as strong confirmation of the\r\nprevalent suspicion. But, when she introduced Berthault, Courault, and\r\nher own almoner, Roussel, to the pulpits of the capital, and protected\r\nthem in their evangelical labors, the case ceased to admit of\r\ndoubt.[311] She even persuaded the king to listen to a sermon in which\r\nLe Coq, curate of St. Eustache, argued with force against the bodily\r\npresence of Christ in the eucharist, and maintained that the very words,\r\n\"_Sursum corda_\" in the church service, pointed Him out as to be found\r\nat the right hand of God in heaven. Indeed, the eloquent preacher had\r\nnearly convinced his royal listener, when the Cardinals of Tournon and\r\nLorraine, by a skilful stratagem, succeeded in destroying the impression\r\nhe had received, and, it is said, in inducing Le Coq to make a\r\nretraction.[312] But the opposition to the public proclamation of the\r\nreformed doctrines was too formidable for their advocates to stem. Beda\r\nand his colleagues in the Sorbonne left no device untried to silence the\r\npreachers; and, although the restless syndic was in the end forced to\r\nexpiate his seditious words and writings by an _amende honorable_ in\r\nfront of the church of Notre Dame, and died in prison,[313] Roussel and\r\nhis fellow-preachers had long before been compelled to exchange their\r\npublic discourses for private exhortations, and finally to discontinue\r\neven these and retreat from Paris.[314]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret attacked in the College of Navarre.]\r\n\r\nEven so, however, the theologians could not contain their indignation at\r\nthe insult they had received. In the excess of their zeal they went so\r\nfar as to hold up the king's sister to condemnation and derision, in one\r\nof those plays which the students of the Collége de Navarre were\r\naccustomed annually to perform, as a scholastic exercise in public\r\noratory (on the first of October, 1533). A gentle queen was here\r\nrepresented as throwing aside needle and distaff, at the crafty\r\nsuggestion of a tempting fury, and as receiving in lieu of those\r\nfeminine implements a copy of the Gospels--when, lo! she was suddenly\r\ntransformed into a cruel tyrant. It was perhaps hard to detect the exact\r\nconnection between the acceptance of the holy book and so disastrous a\r\nchange of character--neither the students of the Collége de Navarre nor\r\ntheir teachers thought it worth while to trouble themselves about such\r\ntrifles--but there was no difficulty in recognizing Margaret in the\r\nprincipal actor of the play, or in deciphering the name of Master Gérard\r\nRoussel--Magister Gerardus--in _Megæra_, the fury with the flaming\r\ntorch, that seduced her. On complaint of his sister, Francis, in some\r\nindignation, ordered the arrest of the author of the insipid drama, as\r\nwell as of the youthful performers. The former could not be found, and\r\nthe latter, thanks to the queen's clemency, escaped with a less rigorous\r\npunishment than the insult deserved.[315]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Miroir de l'âme pécheresse.]\r\n\r\nAn equally audacious act was the insertion of a work published by\r\nMargaret, under the title of _Le miroir de l'âme pécheresse_, in a list\r\nof prohibited books. When the university, to whom the censorship of the\r\npress was entrusted, was called to account by the king, all the\r\nfaculties promptly repudiated any intention to cast doubt upon the\r\northodoxy of his sister, and even the originator of the offensive\r\nprohibition was forced to plead ignorance of the authorship of the\r\nvolume in question. The rector of the university terminated the long\r\nseries of disclaimers by rendering thanks to Francis for his fatherly\r\npatience.[316]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rector Cop's address to the university.]\r\n\r\nJust a month after the unlucky dramatic representation of the Collége de\r\nNavarre, the city was furnished with fresh food for scandal. On All\r\nSaints' day (the first of November, 1533), the university assembled\r\naccording to custom in the church of the Mathurins, to listen to an\r\naddress delivered by the rector. But Nicholas Cop's discourse was not of\r\nthe usual type. Under guise of a disquisition on \"Christian Philosophy,\"\r\nthe orator preached an evangelical sermon, with the First Beatitude for\r\nhis text, and propounded the view that the forgiveness of sin and\r\neternal life are simple gifts of God's grace that cannot be earned by\r\nman's good works.[317]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its extraordinary character.]\r\n\r\nNever had academic harangue contained sentiments savoring so strongly of\r\nthe tenets of the persecuted reformers. True, the rector had not omitted\r\nthe ordinary invitation to his hearers to join him in the salutation of\r\nthe Virgin.[318] But even this mark of orthodox Catholicity could not\r\nremove the taint of heresy from an address the whole drift of which was\r\nto establish the cardinal doctrine of the theology of Luther and\r\nZwingle. It was a bold step. The doctors of the Sorbonne could not\r\nsuppress their indignation, and Franciscan monks denounced the rector to\r\nthe Parliament of Paris. When summoned to appear before the court to\r\nanswer the charges brought against him, Cop at first endeavored to\r\narouse in the university the traditional jealousy of this invasion of\r\nscholastic privileges, claiming that these were violated by his being\r\ncited to parliament before he had been in the first instance tried by\r\nhis peers. And, indeed, after a tumultuous meeting of the university,\r\ncalled at the Mathurins a fortnight after the delivery of Cop's address\r\n(the nineteenth of November), the Faculty of Arts came to the same\r\nconclusion.[319] But, although the \"Four Nations,\" and apparently the\r\nFaculty of Medicine also, promised their support, the Faculties of\r\nTheology and Law refused, and Cop did not venture to press his point.\r\nWarned of his danger by a friendly tongue, when already on his way to\r\nthe _Palais de Justice_, in full official costume and accompanied by his\r\nbeadles, he consulted his safety by a precipitate flight from the city\r\nand from the kingdom.[320]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin the real author.]\r\n\r\nThe incidents just narrated derive their chief interest from the\r\ncircumstance that they bring to our notice for the first time a young\r\nman, Jean Cauvin, or Calvin, of Noyon, soon to figure among the most\r\nimportant actors in the intellectual and religious history of the modern\r\nworld; for it was not many days before the authorship of the startling\r\ntheological doctrines enunciated by the rector was directly traced to\r\nhis friend and bosom companion, the future reformer of Geneva. In fact,\r\nCalvin seems to have supplied Cop with the entire address--a production\r\nnot altogether unworthy of that clear and vigorous intellect which,\r\nwithin less than two years, conceived the plan of and matured the most\r\norderly and perfect theological treatise of the Reformation--the\r\n\"Institution Chrétienne.\" Between the sketch of Christian Philosophy in\r\nthe discourse written for the rector, and the Christian Institutes,\r\nthere is, nevertheless, a contrast too striking to be overlooked. And if\r\nthe salutation to the Virgin, in the exordium, was actually penned by\r\nCalvin, as is not improbable, the change in his religious convictions\r\nwould appear to have been as marked and rapid as the development of his\r\nintellectual faculties. At any rate, the recent discovery of the\r\ncomplete manuscript of Nicholas Cop's oration ranks among the most\r\nopportune and welcome of antiquarian successes in our times.[321]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He seeks safety in flight.]\r\n\r\nCalvin was soon reduced to the necessity of following the rector's\r\nexample in fleeing from Paris; for the part he had had in preparing the\r\naddress had become the public talk. The young scholar--he was only in\r\nhis twenty-fifth year--sought for by the sanguinary\r\n_lieutenant-criminel_, Jean Morin, barely made good his escape.\r\nProceeding to Angoulême, he enjoyed, under the friendly roof of Louis de\r\nTillet, a short period of quiet and an opportunity to pursue his\r\nfavorite studies.[322]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis rejects roughly the intercession of the Bernese.]\r\n\r\nThe incessant representations made to the king respecting the rapid\r\nprogress of \"Lutheran\" doctrines in France, and perhaps also the\r\noccurrence of such incidents as that just mentioned, seem to have been\r\nthe cause of the adoption of new measures against the Reformation and\r\nits professors. Already, in October, Francis had written a rough answer\r\nto the Council of the Canton of Berne, expressing extreme surprise that\r\nthey had ventured to intercede for the relatives of Guillaume Farel,\r\naccused of heresy, and to beg him to give no credit in this matter\r\neither to the royal officers or to the inquisitors of the faith.[323]\r\nAnd he had used these significant words: \"Desiring the preservation of\r\nthe name of _very Christian king_, acquired for us by our predecessors,\r\n_we have nothing in the world more at heart than the entire extirpation\r\nof heresies, and nothing could induce us to suffer them to take root in\r\nour kingdom_. Of this you may rest well assured, and leave us to proceed\r\nagainst them, without your giving yourselves any solicitude. _For\r\nneither your prayers, nor those of any one else whomsoever, could be of\r\nany avail in this matter with us._\"[324]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal letter to the Bishop of Paris.]\r\n\r\nOn his return from the marriage of his son Henry to Catharine de'\r\nMedici, celebrated only four days before Cop's university harangue,\r\nFrancis was induced to make new provisions for the detection and\r\npunishment of dissent. Alarmed by the progress of \"Lutheran\" sentiments\r\nin his very capital, as reported to him by parliament, he not only urged\r\nthat body to renewed diligence, but directed the Bishop of Paris, the\r\ntolerant Jean du Bellay, who may have been suspected of too much\r\nsupineness in the matter,[325] to confer upon two counsellors of\r\nparliament all the authority necessary to act for him, without prejudice\r\nto his jurisdiction in other cases.[326] Both parliament and bishop\r\nwere at the same time notified of the receipt of two fresh bulls, kindly\r\nfurnished by Pope Clement, at Francis's request, to help in the good\r\nwork of extirpating \"that accursed Lutheran sect.\"[327]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: Elegies on Louis de Berquin.]\r\n\r\n     The number of extant poems on the death of Louis de Berquin attests\r\n     very clearly the estimate placed upon him by the Roman Catholics as\r\n     the most dangerous heretic--in fact, the _heresiarch_ of the day. A\r\n     stanza of eight lines, which seems to have been popular (for it has\r\n     been discovered in MS. both in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Génin,\r\n     i. 219, and in the library of Soissons, Bulletin de la Soc. de\r\n     l'hist. du prot. franç., xi. 131), represents the four elements as\r\n     conspiring, at God's bidding, to take vengeance upon him:\r\n\r\n        \"Du faux Berquin et de ses documens\r\n        Dieu s'est vengé par les quatre élémens:\r\n        _Terre_ luy a désnie sépulture;\r\n        _Feu_ l'a destruit et sa fausse escripture;\r\n        Tisons par _eau_ pluviale arrosez\r\n        Se sont plus fort esmeus et embrasez.\r\n        Dont (pour la fin du malheureux comprendre)\r\n        L'_air_ par les vents en a receu la cendre.\"\r\n\r\n     I have been so fortunate as to discover two other poems on the same\r\n     subject, in a little collection in my possession entitled _Martini\r\n     Theodorici Bellovaci Epigrammata_ (Parisiis, 1539), which seems to\r\n     be of such rarity that these pieces may almost be viewed in the\r\n     light of inedited documents. They are of special interest because\r\n     of the singular circumstance that this collection of extremely\r\n     \"Catholic\" effusions is dedicated to _Odet de Coligny_, Cardinal of\r\n     Châtillon, Archbishop of Toulouse, Bishop and Count of Beauvais,\r\n     elder brother of the more famous _Admiral_ massacred on St.\r\n     Bartholomew's day. Cardinal Châtillon, created such when only\r\n     thirteen years old, was, at the time of the publication of this\r\n     book, a youth of scarcely more than twenty-two, and a devout Roman\r\n     Catholic, but subsequently, as elsewhere stated, became an avowed\r\n     Protestant and a prominent Huguenot leader.\r\n\r\n     In the first of these poems, under the heading of _Elegia Ludovici\r\n     Berquuyni_, the writer would almost seem to have had in mind the\r\n     description by the ancient dramatists of the impious warfare of\r\n     Capaneus breathing out boastful threats against Jove himself\r\n     (Septem con. Theb., 416, etc.), or the Titans in conflict with the\r\n     Gods.\r\n\r\n        \"Occultum patuit quod non celarier ultra\r\n          Debuit. Excellens Jupiter egit opus.\r\n        Sublimi elatum dejecit sede potentem,\r\n          Qui modo regnabat, qui modo jura dabat,\r\n        Quique superbifico regalia limina gressu\r\n          Tantum incedebat, pastus honore levi,\r\n        Et cedrina petens famæ monimenta perennis.\r\n          Insigni optabat sanctior esse Numa.\r\n        Lector, Ave, et causam properes dignoscere: casus\r\n          Hæreseos foeda labe volutus erat.\r\n        Hoc impune nefas solida an ratione stetisset,\r\n          Et Petri hausissent æquora vasta ratim,\r\n        Inviolata fides æterno permanet ævo.\r\n          Percutit injustos ira molesta Dei;\r\n        Quem neque præmeditans latuit Nero, funera cujus\r\n          Distulit adversa in tempora longa vice.\r\n        Occidit ergo miser, Divumque hominumque favore,\r\n          Traduxitque illuc sors malesuada virum.\r\n        Nil gravius pugnare Deo, pugnare feroci\r\n          Fortunæ. Vinci magnus uterque nequit.\"\r\n\r\n     The other elegy is shorter and less striking in conception, but\r\n     gives a similar impression of the importance assigned to Louis de\r\n     Berquin's activity and influence:\r\n\r\n        \"Francia dum hymnidico resonet pæane juventus,\r\n          Parisia extincto gaudeat hoste phalanx.\r\n        Hic dudum, et nuper morbo scabiosus edaci,\r\n          Francorum reliquas inficiebat oves.\r\n        Cognitus haud potuit mundari errore nefando,\r\n          Quin purgaretur lucidiore foco.\r\n        Nam quamvis concessa esset clementia, durus\r\n          Obstitit, et rapido malluit igne mori.\"\r\n\r\n     The library of Soissons contains a MS. lament from a Protestant\r\n     source over the death of De Berquin, which is at once simple and\r\n     touching.

True, the claims of the papacy were insupportable, and the most\r\nflagrant abuses prevailed; but many of the reformers believed it quite\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that the great body of the supporters\r\nof the church might be brought to recognize and renounce these abuses,\r\nand break the tyrannical yoke that had, for so many centuries, rested\r\nupon the neck of the faithful. The ancient fabric of religion, they\r\nsaid, is indeed disfigured by modern additions, and has been brought, by\r\nlong neglect, to the very verge of ruin. But these tasteless\r\nexcrescences can easily be removed, the ravages of time reverently\r\nrepaired, and the grand old edifice restored to its pristine symmetry\r\nand magnificence. In a word, it was a general _reformation_ that was\r\ncontemplated--no radical reconstruction after a novel plan. And the\r\nfuture _council_, in which all phases of opinion would be freely\r\nrepresented, was to provide the adequate and sufficient cure for all the\r\nills afflicting the body politic and ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\nBy some of the more sanguine adherents of both parties these flattering\r\nexpectations were long entertained. With others the attempt to effect a\r\nreligious reconciliation seems to have served merely as a mask to hide\r\npolitical designs; and at this distance of time it is among the most\r\ndifficult problems of history to determine the proportion in which\r\nearnest zeal and rank insincerity entered as factors into the measures\r\nundertaken for the purpose of reconciling theological differences.\r\nEspecially is this true respecting the overtures made by the French\r\nmonarch to Philip Melanchthon, which now claim our attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanchthon and Du Bellay.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A plan of reconciliation.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of the year 1534 Melanchthon received a courteous\r\nvisit at Wittemberg from an agent of the distinguished French\r\ndiplomatist, Guillaume du Bellay-Langey, envoy to the Protestant princes\r\nof Germany. The interview paved the way for a long correspondence\r\nbetween Melanchthon and Du Bellay himself, in which the latter threw out\r\nsuggestions of the practicability of some plan for bringing the\r\nintelligent and candid men in both countries to adopt a common ground in\r\nrespect to religion. Finally, in response to Du Bellay's earnest\r\nrequest, his correspondent consented to draw up such a scheme as\r\nappeared to himself proper to serve for the basis of union. The result\r\nwas a paper of a truly wonderful character, in which the reader scarcely\r\nknows whether to admire the evident charity dictating every line, or to\r\nsmile at the simplicity betrayed in the extravagant concessions. In a\r\nletter accompanying his proposal Melanchthon set forth at some length\r\nboth his motives and his hopes. In touching upon controverted points, he\r\nclaimed to have exhibited a moderation that would prove to be not\r\nwithout utility to the church. He professed his own belief that an\r\naccommodation might be effected on every doctrinal point, if only a free\r\nand amicable conference were to be held, under royal auspices, between a\r\nfew good and learned men. The subjects of dispute were less numerous\r\nthan was generally supposed, and the edge of many a sharply drawn\r\ntheological distinction had been insensibly worn away by the softening\r\nhand of time. By such a conference as he proposed the perils of a public\r\ndiscussion could be avoided--a form of controversy fatal, for the most\r\npart, to the peace of the unlearned. In fact, no radical change was\r\nabsolutely required in the ancient order or in ecclesiastical polity.\r\nNot even the pontifical authority itself need necessarily be abolished;\r\nfor it was the desire of the Lutheran party, so far as possible, to\r\nretain all the accustomed forms. In fine, he begged Du Bellay to exhort\r\nthe monarchs of Europe to concord while yet there was room left for the\r\ncounsels of moderation. What calamities might otherwise be in store!\r\nWhat a ruin both of church and state, should a collision of arms be\r\nprecipitated![328]\r\n\r\nBut Melanchthon's ardor had carried him far beyond his true reckoning.\r\nNo other reformer could have brought himself to approve the articles now\r\nsubmitted for the king's perusal; while it was certain that not even\r\nthis unbounded liberality would satisfy the exorbitant demands of the\r\nRoman party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanchthon's concessions.]\r\n\r\nMelanchthon not only admitted that an ecclesiastical system with bishops\r\nin many cities was lawful, but that the Roman pontiff might preside over\r\nthe entire episcopate. He countenanced, to a certain extent, the current\r\ndoctrine respecting human tradition and the retention of auricular\r\nconfession. He discerned a gradual approach to concord in respect to\r\njustification, and found no difficulty in the divergent views of free\r\nwill and original sin. He did, indeed, insist upon the rejection of the\r\nworship of saints, and advocate expunging from the ritual all appeals\r\nfor their assistance. So, too, monks ought to be allowed to forsake the\r\ncloister, and monastic establishments could then be advantageously\r\nturned into schools of learning. The celibacy of the clergy should, in\r\nlike manner, be forthwith granted. There was, however, in his view, one\r\npoint that bristled with difficulties. How to remove them Melanchthon\r\nconfessed himself unable to suggest. The question of the popish mass was\r\nthe Gordian knot which must be reserved for the future council of the\r\nchurch to untie or cut.[329]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His own misgivings.]\r\n\r\nA faint suspicion seems, however, to have flitted through the Wittemberg\r\nreformer's mind, that possibly, after all his large admissions, his\r\nattempt was but labor lost! For, in a letter to Martin Bucer, written on\r\nthe very day he despatched his communication to Du Bellay, he more than\r\nhinted his own despair of effecting an agreement with the Pope of Rome,\r\nand excused himself for his apparently lavish proffers, on the plea that\r\nhe was desirous of making his good French friends comprehend the chief\r\npoints of controversy![330]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A favorable impression made on Francis.]\r\n\r\nMelanchthon's articles, faithfully transmitted by Du Bellay, produced on\r\nthe mind of Francis a favorable impression. The ambitious monarch\r\nwelcomed the prospect of a speedy removal of the doctrinal differences\r\nthat had previously marred the perfect understanding he wished to\r\nmaintain with the Protestant princes of Germany. Whether, however, any\r\nhigher motives than considerations of a political character weighed with\r\nhim, may well be doubted.\r\n\r\nMeantime, an unexpected occurrence for the time dispelled all thought of\r\nthat harvest of conciliation and harmony which the more moderate\r\nreformers looked for as likely to spring up from the seed so liberally\r\nsown by Melanchthon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indiscreet partisans of reform.]\r\n\r\nIf, among the advocates of the purification of the church, there was a\r\nparty which, with Melanchthon, seemed ready to jeopard some of the most\r\nvital principles of the great moral and religious movement, in the vain\r\nhope of again cementing an unnatural union with the Roman system, there\r\nwas another faction, to which moderation and half-way measures were\r\nutterly repulsive. Its partisans believed themselves warranted in\r\nresorting to open acts expressive of detestation of the gilded idolatry\r\nof the popular religion. For their views they alleged the Old Testament\r\nhistory as sufficient authority. Had not the servants of Jehovah braved\r\nthe resentment of the priests of Baal, and disregarded the threats of\r\nkings and queens? Why treat the saints' images, the crucifixes, the\r\ngorgeous robes and manufactured relics, with more consideration than was\r\ndisplayed by Hebrew prophets in dealing with heathen abominations? So\r\ninveterate an evil as the corruption of all that is most sacred in\r\nChristianity could only be successfully combated by vigor and decision.\r\nOnly under heavy and repeated blows does the monarch of the forest yield\r\nto the axe of the woodman.\r\n\r\nBetween the extremes of ill-judged concession and untimely rashness, the\r\ngreat body of those who had embraced the Reformation endeavored to hold\r\na middle course, but found themselves exposed to many perils, not the\r\nresult of their own actions, but brought upon them by the timidity or\r\nfoolhardiness of their associates. A lamentable instance of the kind\r\nmust now be noticed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Placards and pasquinades.]\r\n\r\nFor many months the street-walls of Paris had been employed by both\r\nsides in the great controversies of the day, for the purpose of giving\r\npublicity to their views. Under cover of night, placards, often in the\r\nform of pasquinades, were posted where they would be likely to meet the\r\neyes of a large number of curious readers. So, in the excitement\r\nfollowing the arrest and exile of Beda and other impertinent and\r\nseditious preachers, placards succeeded each other nightly. In one the\r\ntheologians of the Sorbonne were portrayed to the life, and each in all\r\nhis proper colors, by an unfriendly pencil. In another, \"Paris, flower\r\nof nobility\" was passionately entreated to sustain the wounded faith of\r\nGod, and the King of Glory was supplicated to confound \"the accursed\r\ndogs,\" the Lutherans.[331] Under the circumstances, it was not strange\r\nthat the \"Lutheran\" placard was hastily torn down by some zealot, with\r\nthe exclamation that the author was a heretic, while a crowd stood all\r\nday about the other transcribing its unpoetic but pious exhortations to\r\nburn the offenders against Divine justice, and no one attempted to\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mission of Féret to Switzerland.]\r\n\r\nThe success of this method of reaching the masses, who could never be\r\ninduced to read a formal treatise or book, suggested to some of the more\r\nardent \"Lutherans\" of Paris the idea of preparing a longer placard,\r\nwhich should boldly attack the cardinal errors of the papal system of\r\nreligion. But, the press being closely watched in the French capital, it\r\nwas thought best to have the placard printed in Switzerland, where,\r\nindeed, the most competent and experienced hands might be found for\r\ncomposing such a paper. The messenger employed was a young man named\r\nFéret, an apprentice of the king's apothecary;[332] and the printing\r\nseems to have been done in the humble but famous establishment of Pierre\r\nVan Wingle, in the retired Vale of Serrières, just out of Neufchâtel,\r\nand on the same presses which, in 1533, gave to the world the first\r\nFrench reformed liturgy, and, two years later, the Protestant\r\ntranslation of the Bible into the French language by Olivetanus.[333]\r\nThere is less certainty respecting the authorship, but it seems highly\r\nprobable that not Farel, but an enthusiastic and somewhat hot-headed\r\nwriter, Antoine de Marcourt, must be held responsible for this imprudent\r\nproduction.[334]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The placard against the mass.]\r\n\r\nFéret, having on his return eluded detection at the frontiers, reached\r\nParis in safety. He brought with him a large number of copies of a\r\nbroadside headed, \"_True Articles respecting the horrible, great and\r\ninsupportable Abuses of the Papal Mass_.\" Among those to whom the paper\r\nwas secretly submitted, there were some who, more prudent than the rest,\r\ndecidedly opposed its publication. It was too violent, they said. The\r\nwriter's ill-advised severity would answer no good purpose. The tract\r\nwould alienate the sympathy of many, and thus retard, instead of\r\nadvancing, the cause it advocated.[335] Remonstrance, however, proved\r\nfutile.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the eighteenth of October, 1534, a placard was\r\nfound posted upon the walls in all the principal thoroughfares of the\r\nmetropolis. Everywhere it was read with horror and indignation, mingled\r\nwith rage; and loud threats and curses were uttered against its unknown\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThe document that called forth these expressions and was the occasion of\r\nmore important commotions in the sequel, had so direct and potent an\r\ninfluence upon the fortunes of the Reformation in France that it cannot\r\nbe passed over without a brief reference to the general character of its\r\ncontents. It began with a solemn address: \"I invoke heaven and earth in\r\ntestimony of the truth, against that proud and pompous papal mass,\r\nthrough which (if God remedy not speedily the evil) the world will be\r\nwholly desolated, destroyed, and ruined. For therein is our Lord so\r\noutrageously blasphemed and the people so blinded and seduced, that it\r\nought no longer to be suffered or endured.\" Every Christian must needs\r\nbe assured that the one sacrifice of Christ, being perfect, demands no\r\nrepetition. Still the world has long been, and now is, flooded with\r\nwretched sacrificing priests, who yet proclaim themselves liars,\r\ninasmuch as they chant every Sunday in their vespers, that Christ is a\r\npriest forever after the order of Melchisedec. Wherefore not only every\r\nman of sound understanding, but \"they themselves, in spite of\r\nthemselves, must admit that the Pope and all his brood of cardinals,\r\nbishops, monks, and canting mass-priests, with all who consent\r\nthereunto, are false prophets, damnable deceivers, apostates, wolves,\r\nfalse shepherds, idolaters, seducers, liars and execrable blasphemers,\r\nmurderers of souls, renouncers of Jesus Christ, of his death and\r\npassion, false witnesses, traitors, thieves, and robbers of the honor\r\nof God, and more detestable than devils.\" After citing from the book of\r\nHebrews some passages to establish the sufficiency of Christ, the writer\r\naddresses his opponents: \"I demand then of all sacrificing priests,\r\nwhether their sacrifice be perfect or imperfect? If imperfect, why do\r\nthey deceive the poor people? If perfect, why need it be repeated? Come\r\nforward, priests, and reply if you can!\"\r\n\r\nThe body of Christ cannot, it is argued, be contained in the host. It is\r\n_above_, whither also we are bidden raise our hearts and look for the\r\nLord. To breathe or mutter over the bread and wine, and then adore them,\r\nis idolatry. To enjoin this adoration on others is a doctrine of devils.\r\nBut these impudent heretics, not ashamed of attempting to imprison the\r\nbody of Jesus in their wafer, have even dared to place this caution in\r\nthe rubric of their missals, \"If the body of our Lord, being devoured of\r\nmice or spiders, has been destroyed or much gnawed, or if the worm be\r\nfound altogether within, let it be burned and placed in the reliquary.\"\r\n\"O Earth! How dost thou not open and swallow up these horrible\r\nblasphemers! Wretched men, is this the body of the Lord Jesus, the true\r\nSon of God? Doth he suffer himself to be eaten of mice and spiders? He\r\nwho is the bread of angels and of all the children of God, is he given\r\nto us to become the food of animals? Will ye make him who is\r\nincorruptible at the right hand of God to be the prey of worms and\r\ncorruption? Were there no other error than this in your infernal\r\ntheology, well would ye deserve the fagot! Light then your fires to burn\r\n_yourselves_, not us who refuse to believe in your idols, your new gods,\r\nand new Christs that suffer themselves to be eaten indifferently by\r\nanimals and by you who are no better than animals!\"[336] Closing with a\r\nvivid contrast between the fruits of the mass and those of the true\r\nSupper of our Lord, the writer finally exclaims of his opponents, \"Truth\r\nfails them, Truth threatens and pursues them, Truth terrifies them; by\r\nwhich their reign shall shortly be destroyed forever.\"[337]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The popular excitement in Paris.]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the effect produced upon the\r\npopulace of Paris by this intemperate handbill. If any part of the\r\nceremonial of the church was deeply rooted in the devotion of the common\r\npeople, it was the service of the mass. And in attacking the doctrine of\r\nthe Real Presence, the authors of this libel, distributed under cover of\r\nthe darkness, had, in the estimation of the rabble, proved themselves\r\nmore impious and deserving a more signal punishment than that\r\nsacrilegious Jew whose knife had drawn drops of miraculous blood from\r\nthe transubstantiated wafer. Not the parish priests, nor the doctors of\r\nthe Sorbonne, could surpass the infuriated populace in loud execrations\r\nof the wretch for whom burning alive seemed too mild a punishment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anger of the king.]\r\n\r\nBut a second act of ill-timed rashness accomplished a result even more\r\ndisastrous for Protestantism than the kindling of the fanatical zeal of\r\nthe people; for it inflamed the anger of the king, and made him, what\r\nall the persuasions of the Roman court had hitherto failed to make him,\r\na determined enemy and persecutor of the \"new doctrines.\" A copy of the\r\nplacard was secretly affixed by night to the very door of the royal\r\nbedchamber in the castle of Amboise,[338] where Francis and his court\r\nwere at the time sojourning. If the contents of the tract offended the\r\nreligious principles carefully inculcated upon the king by his spiritual\r\ninstructors, the audacity of the person who, disregarding bars, bolts\r\nand guards, had presumed to invade the privacy of the royal abode and\r\nobtrude his unwelcome message, could not but be regarded in the light of\r\na direct personal insult. Francis had not been in the habit of troubling\r\nhimself about the private opinions of the learned on vexed points of\r\ntheology; nor had he been inclined to permit his more fanatical\r\nsubjects to harass any of those eminent scholars whose literary\r\nattainments added lustre to his brilliant court. Yet his claim to the\r\nright of enforcing uniformity of belief--and that uniformity a complete\r\n_conformity_ to his own creed--had rather been held in abeyance than\r\nrelinquished. Louis de Berquin had, at his cost, discovered that the\r\nroyal protection could not be expected even by a personal favorite and a\r\nscholar of large acquisitions, when, not content with holding doctrines\r\ndeemed heretical, he strove to promulgate them. The interposition of\r\nMargaret of Angoulême had proved unavailing in his behalf. The heretics\r\nwho had now ventured to nail an exposé of their dogmas on his bedchamber\r\ndoor could scarcely anticipate greater clemency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political considerations.]\r\n\r\nTo personal motives were added political considerations. Indulgence to\r\nthe perpetrators of an act so insulting to the Roman Catholic religion\r\nmight drive the pontiff, whose friendship was an essential requisite of\r\nsuccess in Francis's ambitious projects, to become the fast friend of\r\nthe emperor, his rival. Pope Clement the Seventh had been succeeded by\r\nPaul the Third. The alliance cemented by the marriage of the Duke of\r\nOrleans to Catharine de' Medici had been dissolved by the death of the\r\nbride's uncle. The favor of the new Pope must be conciliated. Under such\r\ncircumstances, what were the sufferings of a few poor reformers, when\r\nweighed in the balance against the triple crown of his Holiness?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fruitless intercession of Margaret.]\r\n\r\nFrancis determined to return to Paris for the purpose of superintending\r\nin person a search for the culprits. It is true that the Queen of\r\nNavarre attempted to moderate his anger by suggesting that it was not\r\nunlikely that the placard, far from being composed by the \"Lutherans,\"\r\nwas the cunning device of their enemies, who thus sought to insure the\r\nruin of the innocent. But the king appears not unreasonably to have\r\nrejected the suggestion as improbable; although, seven years later,\r\nMargaret reminded him of her surmise, and maintained that the sequel had\r\nstrongly confirmed its accuracy.[339]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis abolishes the art of printing.]\r\n\r\nFar, indeed, from yielding to his sister's persuasions, Francis in his\r\nanger took a step which he would certainly have been glad himself, a few\r\nmonths later, to be able to forget, and of which his panegyrists have\r\nfruitlessly striven to obliterate the memory. On the thirteenth of\r\nJanuary, 1535, after the lapse of nearly three months from the date of\r\nthe publication of the placards--an interval that might surely be\r\nregarded as sufficiently long to permit his overheated passions to cool\r\ndown--the king sent to the Parliament of Paris _an Edict absolutely\r\nprohibiting any exercise of the Art of Printing in France, on pain of\r\nthe halter_! It was no secret from whom the ignoble suggestion had come.\r\nA year and a half earlier (on the seventh of June, 1533), the\r\ntheologians of the Sorbonne had presented Francis an urgent petition, in\r\nview of the multiplication of heretical books, wherein they set forth\r\nthe absolute necessity of suppressing forever by a severe law the\r\npestilent art which had been the parent of so dangerous a progeny.[340]\r\nThe king was now acting upon the advice of his ghostly counsellors!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He suspends the disgraceful edict.]\r\n\r\nHappily for Francis, however, whose ambition it had hitherto been to\r\nfigure as a modern Mæcenas, even a subservient parliament declined the\r\ncustomary registration. The king, too, coming to his senses after the\r\nlapse of six weeks, so far yielded to the remonstrances of his more\r\nsensible courtiers as to recall his rash edict, or, rather, suspend its\r\noperation until he could give the matter more careful consideration.\r\nMeanwhile he undertook to institute a censorship. The king was to select\r\ntwelve persons of quality and pecuniary responsibility, from a list of\r\ntwice that number of names submitted by parliament; and this commission\r\nwas to receive the exclusive right to print--and that, in the city of\r\nParis alone--such books as might be approved by the proper authorities\r\nand be found necessary to the public weal. Until the appointment of the\r\ntwelve censors the press was to remain idle! Nor was the suspension of\r\nthe prohibitory ordinance to continue a day longer than the term\r\nrequired by the monarch to decide whether he preferred to modify its\r\nprovisions or leave them unchanged. \"Albeit on the thirteenth day of\r\nJanuary, 1534,\"[341] wrote this much lauded patron of letters, \"by other\r\nletters-patent of ours, and for the causes and reasons therein\r\ncontained, _we prohibited and forbade any one from thenceforth printing,\r\nor causing to be printed, any books in our kingdom, on pain of the\r\nhalter_: nevertheless, we have willed and ordained that the execution\r\nand accomplishment of our said letters, prohibitions and injunctions, be\r\nand continue suspended and surcease until we shall otherwise\r\nprovide.\"[342]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vigorous proceedings of parliament.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, parliament had not been slack in obeying the command to search\r\ndiligently for the authors and publishers of the placards. Many reputed\r\n\"Lutherans\" had been arrested, some of whom, it was given out, pretended\r\nto reveal the existence of a plot of the reformers to fall upon the good\r\nChristians of the metropolis while assembled in their churches for\r\ndivine worship, and assassinate them in the midst of their devotions!\r\nThe credulous populace made no difficulty in accepting the tale. Paris\r\nshuddered at the thought of its narrow escape, and some hundreds of\r\nthousands of men and women reverently crossed themselves and thanked\r\nheaven they had not fallen a prey to the blood-thirsty designs of a\r\nhandful of peaceable and unarmed adherents of the \"new doctrines!\" As\r\nfor Francis himself, a grave historian tells us that his apprehensions\r\nwere inflamed by the very mention of the word \"conspiracy.\"[343]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abundance of victims.]\r\n\r\nThe investigation had been committed to practised hands. The prosecuting\r\nofficer, or _lieutenant-criminel_, Morin, was as famous for his cunning\r\nas he was notorious for his profligacy. Moreover, the judicious addition\r\nof six hundred _livres parisis_ to his salary afforded him a fresh\r\nstimulus and prevented his zeal from flagging.[344] The timidity or\r\ntreachery of one of the prisoners facilitated the inquest. Terrified by\r\nthe prospect of torture and death, or induced by hope of reward, a\r\nperson, obscurely designated as _le Guainier_, or _Gueynier_,[345] made\r\nan ample disclosure of the names and residences of his former\r\nfellow-believers. The pursuit was no longer confined to those who had\r\nbeen concerned in the distribution of the placards. All reputed heretics\r\nwere apprehended, and, as rapidly as their trials could be prosecuted,\r\ncondemned to death. There was a rare harvest of falsehood and\r\nmisrepresentation. No wonder that innocent and guilty were involved in\r\none common fate.[346]\r\n\r\nIt does not come within the scope of this history to give an edifying\r\naccount of the courage displayed by the victims of the frenzy consequent\r\nupon the placards. The very names of many are unknown. Among the first\r\nto be committed to the flames was a young man, Barthélemi Milon, whom\r\nparalysis had deprived of the use of the lower half of his body.[347]\r\nHis unpardonable offence was that copies of the placard against the mass\r\nhad been found in his possession. A wealthy draper, Jean du Bourg, had\r\nbeen guilty of the still more heinous crime of having posted some of the\r\nbills on the walls. For this he was compelled before execution to go\r\nthrough that solemn mockery of penitence, the _amende honorable_, in\r\nfront of the church of Notre Dame, with but a shirt to conceal his\r\nnakedness, and holding a lighted taper in his hand; afterward to be\r\nconducted to the _Fontaine des Innocents_, and there have the hand that\r\nhad done the impious deed cut off at the wrist, in token of the public\r\ndetestation of his \"high treason against God and the king.\" A printer, a\r\nbookseller, a mason, a young man in orders, were subjected to the same\r\ncruel death. But these were only the first fruits of the\r\nprosecution.[348] However opinions may differ respecting the merits of\r\nthe cause for which they suffered, there can be but one view taken of\r\ntheir deportment in the trying hour of execution. In the presence of the\r\nhorrible preparatives for torture, the most clownish displayed a\r\nfortitude and a noble consciousness of honest purpose, contrasted with\r\nwhich the pusillanimous dejection, the unworthy concessions, and the\r\npremeditated perjury of Francis, during his captivity at Madrid not ten\r\nyears before, appear in no enviable light. The monarch who bartered away\r\nhis honor to regain his liberty[349] might have sat at the feet of\r\nthese, his obscure subjects, to learn the true secret of greatness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great expiatory procession.]\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the persons who had taken part in the preparation and\r\ndissemination of the placards was deemed an insufficient atonement for a\r\ncrime in the guilt of which they had involved the city, and, indeed, the\r\nwhole kingdom. As the offence excelled in enormity any other within the\r\nmemory of man, so it was determined to expiate it by a solemn procession\r\nunparalleled for magnificence. Thursday, the twenty-first of January,\r\n1535, was chosen for the pageant. Along the line of march the streets\r\nhad been carefully cleaned. A public proclamation had bidden every\r\nhouseholder display from his windows the most beautiful and costly\r\ntapestries he possessed. At the doors of all private mansions large\r\nwaxen tapers burned, and, at the intersection of all side streets,\r\nwooden barriers, guarded by soldiers, precluded the possibility of\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nEarly on the appointed morning, the entire body of the clergy of Paris,\r\ndecked out in their most splendid robes and bearing the insignia of\r\ntheir respective ranks, assembled in Notre Dame, and thence in solemn\r\nstate marched to the church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, to meet the\r\nking. Sixteen dignitaries bore aloft the precious reliquary of Sainte\r\nGeneviève; others in similar honor supported the no less venerated\r\nreliquary of Saint Marcel. Those skilled in local antiquities averred\r\nthat never before had the sacred remains of either saint been known to\r\nbe brought across the Seine to grace any similar display.\r\n\r\nAt Saint Germain l'Auxerrois--that notable church under the very shadow\r\nof the Louvre, whose bell, a generation later, gave the first signal for\r\nthe massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day--the royal court and the civil and\r\nmunicipal bodies that had been permitted to appear on so august an\r\noccasion, were in waiting. At length the magnificent column began its\r\nprogress, and threading the crowded streets of St. Honoré and St. Denis,\r\nmade its way, over the bridge of Notre Dame, to the island upon which\r\nstood and still stands the stately cathedral dedicated to Our Lady. Far\r\non in the van rode Éléonore, Francis's second queen, sister to the\r\nemperor, conspicuous for her dignified bearing, dressed in black velvet\r\nand mounted on a palfrey with housings of cloth of gold. In her company\r\nwere the king's daughters by his former wife, the \"good Queen Claude,\"\r\nall in dresses of crimson satin embroidered with gold; while a large\r\nnumber of princesses and noble ladies, with attendant gentlemen and\r\nguards, constituted their escort.\r\n\r\nThe monastic orders came next. Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians,\r\nCarmelites, all were there, with burning tapers and highly prized\r\nrelics. The parish churches were represented in like manner by their\r\nclergy; and these were followed by the chapter of the cathedral and by\r\nthe multitudinous professors and scholars of the university. Between\r\nthis part of the procession and the next, came a detachment of the Swiss\r\nguards of the king, armed with halberds, and a band of skilled musicians\r\nperforming, on trumpets, hautboys, and other instruments, the airs of\r\nthe solemn hymns of the church.\r\n\r\nAn honorable place was held by the ecclesiastics of the \"Sainte\r\nChapelle,\" originally built by Louis the Ninth, in the precincts of his\r\nown palace, for the reception of the marvellous relics he brought home\r\nfrom Holy Land. Those relics were all here, together with the other\r\ncostly possessions of the chapel--the crown of thorns, the true cross,\r\nAaron's rod that budded, the great crown of St. Louis, the head of the\r\nholy lance, one of the nails used in our Lord's crucifixion, the tables\r\nof stone, some of the blood of Christ, the purple robe, and the milk of\r\nthe Virgin Mary--all borne in jewelled reliquaries by bishops.\r\n\r\nFour cardinals in scarlet robes followed--Givri, Tournon, Le Veneur, and\r\nChâtillon--an uncongenial group, in which the violent persecutor and the\r\nfuture partisan of the Reformation walked side by side. But the central\r\npoint in the entire procession was occupied not by these, but by Jean du\r\nBellay, Bishop of Paris, bearing aloft a silver cross in which was\r\nenclosed the consecrated wafer of the eucharist, whose title to\r\nadoration it was the grand object of the celebration to vindicate. The\r\nking's three sons--the dauphin, and the Dukes of Orleans and\r\nAngoulême--with a fourth prince of the blood--the Duke of Bourbon\r\nVendôme--held the supports of a magnificent canopy of velvet, sprinkled\r\nwith golden fleurs-de-lis, above the bishop and his sacred charge.\r\nFrancis himself walked behind him, with a retinue of nobles, officers of\r\ngovernment, judges of parliament, and other civilians closing the line.\r\nThe king was naturally the object of universal observation.\r\n\r\nDressed in robes of black velvet lined with costly furs, he devoutly\r\nfollowed the elevated host, with uncovered head, and with a large waxen\r\ntaper in his hands. Several stations had, at great expense, been erected\r\nalong the designated route. At each of these the procession halted, and\r\nthe Bishop of Paris placed the silver cross with its precious contents\r\nin a niche made to receive it. Then the king, having handed his taper to\r\nthe Cardinal of Lorraine at his side, knelt down and reverently\r\nworshipped with joined hands, until a grand anthem in honor of the\r\nsacrament had been intoned. The scene had been well studied, and it made\r\nthe desired impression upon the by-standers. \"There was no one among the\r\npeople,\" say the registers of the Hôtel de Ville in unctuous phrase, \"be\r\nhe small or great, that did not shed warm tears and pray God in behalf\r\nof the king, whom he beheld performing so devout an act and worthy of\r\nlong remembrance. And it is to be believed that there lives not a Jew\r\nnor an infidel who, had he witnessed the example of the prince and his\r\npeople, would not have been converted to the faith.\"[350]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memorable speech of the king.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the mass--the most brilliant that had ever been\r\ncelebrated within the walls of the cathedral, Francis proceeded to the\r\nepiscopal palace, to dine in public, with the princes his children, the\r\nhigh nobility, cardinals, ambassadors, privy counsellors, and some of\r\nthe judges of the Parliament of Paris. Here it was that he delivered a\r\nspeech memorable in the history of the great religious movement of the\r\ntime. Addressing parliament and representatives of the lower judiciary,\r\nFrancis plainly disclaimed all sympathy with the Reformation. \"The\r\nerrors,\" he said, \"which have multiplied, and are even now multiplying,\r\nare but of our own days. Our fathers have shown us how to live in\r\naccordance with the word of God and of our mother Holy Church. In that\r\nchurch I am resolved to live and die, and I am determined to prove that\r\nI am entitled to be called Very Christian. I notify you that it is my\r\nwill that these errors be driven from my kingdom. Nor shall I excuse any\r\nfrom the task. _Were one of my arms infected with this poison, I should\r\ncut it off! Were my own children contaminated, I should immolate\r\nthem!_[351] I therefore now impose this duty upon you, and relieve\r\nmyself of responsibility.\" Turning to the doctors of the university,\r\nthe king reminded them that the care of the faith was entrusted to them,\r\nand he therefore appealed to them to watch over the orthodoxy of all\r\nteachers and report all defections to the secular courts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constancy of the sufferers.]\r\n\r\nFrancis had spoken in the heat of passion, but, in the words of a\r\ncontemporary, \"if his fury was great, still greater was the constancy of\r\nthe martyrs.\"[352] Of this, indeed, the king did not have to wait long\r\nfor a proof. For, after having witnessed, in company with the queen, the\r\n_amende honorable_ of six condemned \"Lutherans\" or \"Christaudins,\" which\r\ntook place on the square in front of the cathedral, Francis, as he\r\nreturned to the Louvre, passed the places where these unfortunates were\r\nundergoing their supreme torments--three near the _Croix du Tiroir_, in\r\nthe Rue St. Honoré, and three at the Halles. The first were men of some\r\nnote--Simon Fouhet, of Auvergne, one of the royal choristers, supposed\r\nto have been the person who posted the placard in the castle of Amboise,\r\nAudebert Valleton, of Nantes, and Nicholas L'Huillier, from the Châtelet\r\nof Paris. The others were of an inferior station in life--a fruitster, a\r\nmaker of wire-baskets, and a joiner. All, however, with almost equal\r\ncomposure, submitted to their fate as to the will of Heaven, rather than\r\nthe sentence of human judges; scarcely seeming, in their firm\r\nanticipation of an immortal crown, to notice the tumultuous outcries of\r\nan infuriated mob which nearly succeeded in snatching them from the\r\nofficers of the law, in order to have the satisfaction of tearing their\r\nbodies to pieces.[353]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ingenious contrivance for protracting torture.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, that the most relentless enemy could scarcely\r\nhave complained that any womanish indulgence had been shown to the\r\npersons singled out to expiate the crime of posting the placard against\r\nthe mass. To delay the advent of death, the sole term of their\r\nexcruciating sufferings, an ingeniously contrived instrument of torture\r\nwas put in play, which if not altogether novel, had at least been but\r\nseldom employed up to this time. Instead of being bound to the stake\r\nand simply roasted to death by means of the fagots heaped up around him,\r\nthe victim was now suspended by chains over a blazing fire, and was\r\nalternately lowered into it and drawn out--a refinement of cruelty whose\r\nprincipal recommendation to favor lay in the fact that the diversion it\r\nafforded the spectators could be made to last until they were fully\r\nsatisfied, and the executioner chose to allow the writhing sufferer to\r\nbe suffocated in the flames.[354] So satisfactory were the results of\r\nthe _Estrapade_, that it came to be universally employed as the\r\ninstrument for executing \"Lutherans,\" with the exception of a favored\r\nfew, to whom the privilege was accorded of being hung or strangled\r\nbefore their bodies were thrown into the fire. Such was, soon after this\r\ntime, the fate of a woman, a school-teacher by profession, found guilty\r\nof heresy. In any case, the judges took effectual measures to forestall\r\nthe deplorable consequences that might ensue from permitting the\r\n\"Lutherans\" to address the by-standers, and so pervert them from the\r\northodox faith. The hangman was instructed to pierce their tongue with a\r\nhot iron, or to cut it out altogether; just as, at a later date, the\r\nsound of the drum was employed to drown the last utterances of the\r\nvictims of despotism.[355]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Marot.]\r\n\r\nThe flames of persecution were not extinguished with the conclusion of\r\nthe solemn expiatory pageant. For months strangers sojourning in Paris\r\nshuddered at the horrible sights almost daily meeting their eyes.[356]\r\nThe lingering hope that a prince naturally clement and averse to\r\nneedless bloodshed, would at length tire of countenancing these\r\ncontinuous scenes of atrocity, seemed gradually to fade away. Great\r\nnumbers of the most intelligent and scholarly consulted their safety in\r\nflight; the friendly court of Renée of France, Duchess of Ferrara,\r\naffording, for a time, asylum to Clément Marot, the poet, and to many\r\nothers. Meantime the suspected \"Lutherans\" that could not be found were\r\nsummoned by the town-crier to appear before the proper courts for trial.\r\nA list of many such has escaped destruction of time.[357] Fortunately,\r\nmost of them had gotten beyond the reach of the officers of the law, and\r\nthe sentence could, at most, effect only the confiscation of their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal declaration of Coucy, July 16, 1535.]\r\n\r\nAs summer advanced, however, the rigor of the persecution was perceived\r\nto be somewhat abating. Finally, on the sixteenth of July, the king so\r\nfar yielded to the urgency of open or secret friends of progress among\r\nthe courtiers, as to issue a \"Declaration\" to facilitate the return of\r\nthe fugitives. \"Forasmuch,\" said Francis, \"as the heresies, which, to\r\nour great displeasure, had greatly multiplied in our kingdom, have\r\nceased, as well by the Divine clemency and goodness, as by the diligence\r\nwe have used in the exemplary punishment of many of their\r\nadherents--who, nevertheless, were not in their last hours abandoned by\r\nthe hand of our Lord, but, turning to Him, have repented, and made\r\npublic confession of their errors, and died like good Christians and\r\nCatholics--no further prosecution of persons suspected of heresy shall\r\nbe made, but they will be discharged from imprisonment, and their goods\r\nrestored. For the same reason, all fugitives who return and _abjure\r\ntheir errors_ within six months will receive pardon. But\r\n_Sacramentarians_[358] and the relapsed are excluded from this offer.\r\nFurthermore, all men are forbidden, under pain of the gallows, and of\r\nbeing held rebels and disturbers of the public peace, to read, teach,\r\ntranslate or print, whether publicly or in private, any doctrine\r\ncontrary to the Christian faith.\"[359] The concession, it must be\r\nconfessed, was not a very liberal one; for the exiles could return only\r\non condition of recanting. Yet the new regulations were mild in\r\ncomparison with the previous practice, which consigned all the guilty\r\nalike to death, and left no room for repentance. Consequently, there\r\nwere not a few, especially of the learned who had been suspected of\r\nheresy, that were found ready to avail themselves of the permission,\r\neven on the prescribed terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alleged intercession of Pope Paul III.]\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this change in the policy of Francis, the most\r\nremarkable rumors circulated among the people. Not the least strange was\r\none that has been preserved for us by a contemporary.[360] It was\r\nreported in the month of June, 1535, that Pope Paul the Third, having\r\nbeen informed of \"the horrible and execrable\" punishments inflicted by\r\nthe king upon the \"Lutherans,\" wrote to Francis and begged him to\r\nmoderate his severity. The pontiff did, indeed, express his conviction\r\nthat the French monarch had acted with the best intentions, and in\r\naccordance with his claim to be called the Very Christian King. But he\r\nadded, that when God, our Creator, was on earth, He employed mercy\r\nrather than strict justice. Rigor ought not always to be resorted to;\r\nand this burning of men alive was a cruel death, and better calculated\r\nto lead to rejection of the faith than to conversion.[361] He therefore\r\nprayed the king to appease his anger, to abate the severity of justice,\r\nand grant pardon to the guilty. Francis, consequently, because of his\r\ndesire to please his Holiness, became more moderate, and enjoined upon\r\nparliament to practise less harshness. For this reason the judges\r\nceased from criminal proceedings against the \"Lutherans,\" and many\r\nprisoners were discharged both from the Conciergerie and from the\r\nChâtelet.\r\n\r\nThat this extraordinary rumor was in general circulation appears from\r\nthe circumstance that it is alluded to by a Paris correspondent of\r\nMelanchthon; while another account that has recently come to light\r\nstates it not as a flying report, but as a well-ascertained fact.[362]\r\nIts _singularity_ is shown from its apparent inconsistency with the\r\nwell-known history and sentiments of the Farnese Paul. It is difficult\r\nto conceive how the pontiff who approved of the Society of Jesus and\r\ninstituted the Inquisition in the kingdom of Naples, could have been\r\ntouched with compassion at the recital of the suffering of French\r\nheretics. Yet the paradoxes of history are too numerous to permit us to\r\nreject as apocryphal a story so widely current, or to explain it away by\r\nmaking it only a popular echo of the convictions of the more enlightened\r\nas to the views that were most befitting the claimant to a universal\r\nepiscopate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clemency again dictated by policy.]\r\n\r\nFrancis himself, however, made no such statement to the Venetian\r\nambassador at his court. Marino Giustiniano, who gave in his report to\r\nthe doge and senate this very year, was informed by the French king\r\nthat, on hearing of the suspension by the Emperor Charles the Fifth of\r\nall sentences of death against the Flemish heretics, he had also himself\r\nordered that against every species of heretics, except the\r\nSacramentarians, proceedings should indeed be held as before, but _not\r\nto the extremity of death_.[363] It is evident, therefore, that the\r\nsuppression of the most cruel features of the persecution had no higher\r\nmotive than political considerations. Francis had worked himself into a\r\nfrenzy, and counterfeited the sincerity of a bigot, when it was\r\nnecessary to make the Pope a friend, and a show of sanguinary ardor\r\nseemed most adapted to accomplish his object. He now became tolerant, on\r\ndiscovering that the course he had entered upon was alienating the\r\nProtestant princes of Germany, upon whose support he relied in his\r\ncontest with Charles the Fifth. The turning-point appears to have been\r\ncoincident with the time when he found that the emperor was endeavoring\r\nto outbid him by offering a short-lived toleration to the Netherlanders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis writes to the German princes.]\r\n\r\nOnly eleven days after the solemn propitiatory procession, and while the\r\ntrial and execution of the French reformers were still in progress,\r\nFrancis had written to his allies beyond the Rhine, in explanation of\r\nthe severe punishment of which such shocking accounts had been\r\ncirculated in their dominions. He justified his course by alleging the\r\ndisorderly and rebellious character of the culprits, and laid great\r\nstress upon the care he had taken to secure German Protestants from\r\ndanger and annoyance.[364]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanchthon entreated to come to France.]\r\n\r\nA month later, Voré de la Fosse was on his way to Wittemberg, on a\r\nprivate mission to Melanchthon. He was bearer of a long and important\r\nletter from John Sturm. The learned writer, a German scholar of eminence\r\nand a friend of the reformed doctrines, was at this time lecturing in\r\nParis, and after his departure from Francis's dominions, became rector\r\nof the infant university of Strasbourg. He contrasted the hopeful strain\r\nin which he had described to his correspondent the prospects of\r\nreligion, a year since, with the terrors of the present situation.\r\nCrediting the king with the best intentions, he cast the blame of so\r\ndisastrous a change upon the insane authors of the placards, who had\r\ndrawn on themselves a punishment that would have been well deserved, had\r\nit been moderate in degree. But, unhappily, the innocent had been\r\ninvolved with the guilty, and informers had gratified private malice by\r\nmagnifying the offence. Francis had, it was true, been led, at the\r\nintercession of Guillaume du Bellay and his brother, the Bishop of\r\nParis, to interpose his authority and protect the Germans residing in\r\nhis realm. But, none the less, he begged Melanchthon to fly to his\r\nsuccor, and to exert an influence over the king which was the result of\r\nVoré's continual praise, in putting an end to this unfortunate state of\r\nthings. Francis, he added, was willing to give pledges for the\r\nreformer's safety, and would send him back in great honor to his native\r\nland, after the conclusion of the proposed conference. \"Lay aside,\r\ntherefore,\" wrote Sturm, \"the consideration of kings and emperors, and\r\nbelieve that the voice that calls you is the voice of God and of\r\nChrist.\"[365] Voré followed up this invitation with great earnestness\r\nboth in personal interviews and by letter.[366]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His perplexity.]\r\n\r\nWhat answer should the reformer give to so pressing an invitation? In\r\nhis acknowledgment of Sturm's letter, Melanchthon confessed that no\r\ndeliberation had ever occasioned him so much perplexity. It was not that\r\ndomestic ties retained him or dangers deterred him. But he was harassed\r\nby the fear that he would be unable to accomplish any good. If only this\r\ndoubt--amounting almost to _despair_--could be removed, he would fly to\r\nFrance without delay. He approved--so he assured his correspondent--of\r\nchecking those fanatics who were engaged in sowing absurd and vile\r\ndoctrines, or created unnecessary tumults. But there were others against\r\nwhom no such charge could be brought, but who modestly professed the\r\nGospel. If through his exertions some slight concessions were obtained,\r\nwhile points of greater importance were sacrificed, he would benefit\r\nneither church nor state. What if he secured immunity from punishment\r\nfor such as had laid aside the monk's cowl? Must he then consent to the\r\nexecution of those conscientious men who disapproved of the evident\r\nabuses of the mass and of the worship of the saints? Now, as it was\r\nprecisely the expression of this disapprobation that had caused the\r\npresent massacres, he trembled with fear lest he should be put in the\r\nposition of one that justified these atrocious severities. In short, it\r\nwas his advice, he said, in view of the cunning devices by which the\r\n\"phalanxes\" of monks were wont to play upon the hopes and fears of the\r\nhigh-born, that Francis, if honestly desirous of consulting the glory of\r\nChrist, and the tranquillity of the church, be rather exhorted to\r\nassemble a general council. Other measures appeared to him, not only\r\nuseless, but fraught with peril.[367]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formal invitation from the king.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the king himself took a direct part in the correspondence.\r\nOn the twenty-third of June, 1535, he sent Melanchthon a formal request\r\nto visit his court, and there dispute, in his presence, with a select\r\ncompany of doctors, concerning the restoration of doctrinal unity and\r\necclesiastical harmony. He assured the reformer that he had been\r\nprompted by his own great zeal to despatch Voré with this letter--itself\r\na pledge of the public faith--and besought him to suffer no one to\r\npersuade him to turn a deaf ear to the summons.[368] Sturm, Cardinal du\r\nBellay, and his brother, all wrote successively, and urged Melanchthon\r\nto come to a conference from which they hoped for every advantage.[369]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanchthon consents.]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that, after receiving so complimentary an invitation,\r\nMelanchthon concluded to go to France, and applied (on the eighteenth of\r\nAugust) to the Elector John Frederick for the necessary leave of\r\nabsence. He briefly sketched the history of the affair, and set forth\r\nhis own reluctance to enter upon his delicate mission, until provided\r\nwith the elector's permission and a safe conduct from the French\r\nmonarch. Two or three months only would be consumed, and he had made\r\narrangements for supplying his chair at Jena during this short\r\nabsence.[370] It appears, however, that Melanchthon felt less confident\r\nof obtaining a gracious reply to his request than his words would seem\r\nto indicate. Consequently, he deemed it prudent to ask Luther to write\r\nfirst and urge his suit. The latter did not refuse his aid. \"I am moved\r\nto make this prayer,\" said Luther in his letter to the elector, \"by the\r\npiteous entreaty of worthy and pious persons who, having themselves\r\nscarcely escaped the flames, have by great efforts prevailed upon the\r\nking to suspend the carnage and extinguish the fires until Melanchthon's\r\narrival. Should the hopes of these good people be disappointed, the\r\nbloodhounds may succeed in creating even greater bitterness, and proceed\r\nwith burning and strangling. So that I think that Master Philip cannot\r\nwith a clear conscience abandon them in such straits, and defraud them\r\nof their hearty encouragement.\"[371]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The elector refuses to let him go.]\r\n\r\nBut even the great theological doctor's intercession was unavailing. The\r\nvery day the elector received \"Master Philip's\" application, he wrote to\r\nFrancis explaining his reasons for refusing to let Melanchthon go to\r\nParis. It is true that the letter was not actually sent until some ten\r\ndays later;[372] but no entreaties could move the elector to reconsider\r\nhis decision. Melanchthon indignantly left the court and returned to\r\nJena.[373] Here he subsequently received a written refusal from John\r\nFrederick, couched in language far from agreeable. The elector expressed\r\nastonishment that he should have permitted matters to go so far, and\r\nthat he continued to apply for permission even after his prince's desire\r\nhad been intimated. The danger to be apprehended for the peace of\r\nGermany was far greater than any possible advantage that could be\r\nexpected from his mission. And the writer hinted very distinctly that\r\nlittle confidence could be reposed in Francis's professions, where the\r\nGospel was concerned, as public history sufficiently demonstrated.[374]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melanchthon's chagrin.]\r\n\r\nThe most ungrateful of tasks was reserved for Melanchthon himself--the\r\ntask of explaining his inability to fulfil his engagement. In a letter\r\nto Francis, he expressed the hope that the delay might be only\r\ntemporary, and he exhorted the king to resist violent counsels, while\r\nseeking to promote religious harmony and public tranquillity by\r\npeaceable means. To Du Bellay and Sturm he complained not a little of\r\nthe \"roughness\" of his prince, whom he had never found more \"harsh.\" He\r\nthought that the true motive of the elector's refusal was to be found in\r\nthe exaggerated report that he had given up everything, merely because\r\nhe had spoken too respectfully of the ecclesiastical power. \"I am called\r\na deserter,\" he writes. \"I am in great peril among our own friends on\r\naccount of this moderation; as moderate citizens are wont in civil\r\ndiscords to be badly received by both sides. Evidently the fate of\r\nTheramenes impends over me; for I believe Xenophon, who affirms that he\r\nwas a good man, not Lysias, who reviles him.\"[375]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The proposed conference reprobated by the Sorbonne.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the proposed conference encountered no less decided\r\nreprobation from the Sorbonne, to which Francis had submitted his\r\nproject. For the \"articles\" drawn up by Melanchthon, a year before, in a\r\nspirit of conciliation much too broad to please the Protestants, when\r\nplaced in the hands of the same theological body, in a modified form,\r\nand without the name of the author, were returned with a very\r\nunfavorable report. The Parisian doctors suggested that, as an\r\nappropriate method of satisfying himself whether there was any hope of\r\naccommodation, Francis might propound such interrogatories as these to\r\nthe German theologians from whom the articles emanated: \"Whether they\r\nconfessed the church militant, founded by divine right, to be incapable\r\nof erring in faith and good morals, of which church, under our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, St. Peter and his successors have been the head. Whether\r\nthey will obey the church, receive the books of the Bible[376] as holy\r\nand canonical, accept the decrees of the general councils and of the\r\nPopes, admit the Fathers to be the interpreters of the Scriptures, and\r\nconform to the customs of the church?\" As an insufferable grievance they\r\ncomplained that the \"articles\" were not a request for _pardon_, but\r\nactually a demand for _concessions_.[377]\r\n\r\nThe plan to entrap Melanchthon and some considerable portion of the\r\nGerman Protestants into conciliatory proposals which Luther and the more\r\ndecided reformers could not admit, having failed through the abrupt and\r\ntolerably rude refusal of the Elector of Saxony to permit his\r\ntheological professor to comply with the invitation of Francis, the\r\nlatter appears to have determined to put the best appearance upon the\r\naffair. Accordingly, he promptly signified to the Sorbonne his approval\r\nof its action, and he seems even to have suffered the rumor to gain\r\ncurrency that he was himself dissuaded from bringing Melanchthon to\r\nFrance, by the skilful arguments of the Cardinal of Tournon.[378]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the rebuff he had received, however, Francis made an attempt\r\nto effect such an arrangement with the Protestant princes of Germany as\r\nwould secure their co-operation in his ambitious projects against\r\nCharles the Fifth. To compass this end he was quite willing to make\r\nconcessions to the Lutherans as extensive as those which Melanchthon had\r\noffered the Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Bellay's representations at Smalcald.]\r\n\r\nFour months had not elapsed since the unsuccessful issue of his first\r\nmission, before Du Bellay was again in Germany. On the nineteenth of\r\nDecember, he presented himself to the congress of Protestant princes at\r\nSmalcald. Much of his address was devoted to a vindication of his master\r\nfrom the charge of cruelty to persons of the same religious faith as\r\nthat of the hearers. The envoy insisted that the Germans had been\r\nmisinformed: If Francis had executed some of his subjects, he had not\r\nthereby injured the Protestants. The culprits professed very different\r\ndoctrines. The creed of the Germans had been adopted by common consent.\r\nFrancis admitted, indeed, that there were some useless and superfluous\r\nceremonies in the church, but could not assent to their indiscriminate\r\nabrogation unless by public decree. Ought not the Protestant princes to\r\nascribe to their friend, the French king, motives as pure and\r\nsatisfactory as those that impelled them to crush the sedition of the\r\npeasants and repress the Anabaptists? As for himself, Francis, although\r\nmild and humane, both from native temperament and by education, had seen\r\nhimself compelled, by stern necessity and the dictates of prudence, to\r\ncheck the promptings of his own heart, and assume for a time attributes\r\nforeign to his proper disposition. For gladly as he listened to the\r\ntemperate discussion of any subject, he was justly offended at the\r\npresumption of rash innovators, men that refused to submit to the\r\njudgment of those whose prerogative it was to decide in such matters as\r\nwere now under consideration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He makes, in the name of Francis, a Protestant confession.]\r\n\r\nNot content with general assurances, Du Bellay, in a private interview\r\nwith Brück, Melanchthon, and other German theologians, ventured upon an\r\nexposition of Francis's creed which we fear would have horrified beyond\r\nmeasure the orthodox doctors of the Sorbonne.[379] He informed them,\r\nwith a very sober face, that the king's religious belief differed little\r\nfrom that expressed in Melanchthon's \"Common Places.\" His theologians\r\nhad never been able to convince him that the Pope's primacy was of\r\n_divine_ right. Nor had they proved to his satisfaction the existence of\r\n_purgatory_, which, being the source of their lucrative masses and\r\nlegacies, they prized as their very life and blood. He was inclined to\r\nlimit the assumption of monastic vows to persons of mature age, and to\r\ngive monks and nuns the right of renouncing their profession and\r\nmarrying. He favored the conversion of monasteries into seminaries of\r\nlearning. While the French theologians insisted upon the celibacy of the\r\npriesthood, for himself he would suggest the middle ground of permitting\r\nsuch priests as had already married to retain their wives, while\r\nprohibiting others from following their example, unless they resigned\r\nthe sacerdotal office. He would have the sacramental cup administered\r\nto the laity when desired, and hoped to obtain the Pope's consent. He\r\neven admitted the necessity of reform in some of the daily prayers, and\r\nreprehended the want of moderation exhibited by the Sorbonne, which not\r\nonly condemned the Germans, but would not hesitate on occasion to\r\ncensure the cardinals or the Holy Pontiff himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Germans are not deceived.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot find that Du Bellay's honeyed words produced any very deep\r\nimpression. Princes and theologians knew tolerably well both how sincere\r\nwas the king's profession of friendliness to the \"Lutheran\" tenets, and\r\nwhat was the truth respecting the persecution that had raged for months\r\nwithin his dominions. The western breezes came freighted with the fetid\r\nsmoke of human holocausts, and not even the perfume of Francis's\r\ndelicately scented speeches could banish the disgust caused by the\r\nnauseating sacrifice. The princes might listen with studied politeness\r\nto the king's apologetic words, and assent to the general truth that\r\nsedition should be punished by severity; but they took the liberty, at\r\nthe same time, to express a fervent prayer that the advocates of a\r\nreformed religion and a pure gospel might not be involved in the fate of\r\nthe unruly. And they disappointed the monarch by absolutely declining to\r\nenter into any alliance against the Emperor Charles the Fifth. The\r\nFrench ambassador returned home, and Francis so dexterously threw aside\r\nthe mask of pretended favor to a moderate reformation in the church,\r\nthat it soon became a disputed question whether he had ever assumed it\r\nat all.[380]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Efforts of the French Protestants in Switzerland and\r\nGermany.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the French Protestants were unremitting in their efforts to\r\nobtain a more satisfactory solution of the religious question than was\r\ncontained in the Declaration of Coucy. They wrote to Strasbourg, to\r\nBerne, to Zurich, to Basle, imploring the intercession of these states.\r\nParticular attention was drawn to the severe treatment endured by their\r\nbrethren in Provence and Dauphiny. The writers declared themselves to be\r\nnot rebels, but the most loyal of subjects, recognizing one God, one\r\nfaith, one law, and one king. They were not \"Lutherans,\" nor\r\n\"Waldenses,\" nor \"heretics;\" but simply _Christians_, accepting the\r\nDecalogue, the Apostles' Creed, and every doctrine taught in either\r\nTestament. It was unreasonable that they should be compelled by fines,\r\nimprisonment, or bodily pains, to abjure their faith, unless their\r\nerrors were first proved from the Bible, or before the convocation of a\r\nGeneral Council.[381]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An appeal from Strasbourg and Zurich.]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss and Germans made a prompt response. The Senate of Strasbourg\r\naddressed Francis, praising his clemency, but calling his attention to\r\nthe danger all good men were exposed to. \"If but a single little word\r\nescape the mouth of good Christian men, directed against the most\r\nmanifest abuses, nay, against the flagitious crimes of those who are\r\nregarded as _ecclesiastics_, how easy will it be, inasmuch as these very\r\necclesiastics are their judges, to cry out that words have been spoken\r\nto the injury of the true faith, the Church of God, and its\r\ntraditions?\"[382]\r\n\r\nZurich, going even further, made the direct request of its royal ally,\r\nthat hereafter all persons accused of holding heretical views should be\r\npermitted by his Majesty to clear themselves by an appeal to the pure\r\nWord of God, and no longer be subjected without a hearing to torture\r\nand manifold punishments.[383] Berne and Basle remonstrated with similar\r\nurgency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An embassy receives an unsatisfactory reply.]\r\n\r\nReceiving no reply to their appeal, in consequence of the king's\r\nattention being engrossed by the war then in progress with the emperor,\r\nand by reason of the dauphin's unexpected death, the same cantons and\r\nStrasbourg, a few months later, were induced to send a formal embassy.\r\nBut, if the envoys were fed with gracious words, they obtained no real\r\nconcession. Francis assured the Bernese and their confederates that \"it\r\nwas, as they well knew, only for love of them that he had enlarged the\r\nprovisions of his gracious Edict of Coucy, by lately[384] extending\r\npardon to all exiles and fugitives\"--that is, \"Sacramentarians\" and\r\n\"relapsed\" persons included. This, it seemed to him, \"ought to satisfy\r\nthem entirely.\"[385] It was a polite, but none the less a very positive\r\nrefusal to entertain the suggestion that the abjuration of their\r\nprevious \"errors\" should no longer be required of all who wished to\r\navail themselves of the amnesty. Nor did it escape notice as a\r\nsignificant circumstance, that Francis selected for his mouth-piece, not\r\nthe friendly Queen of Navarre, but the rough and bigoted\r\n_Grand-Maître_--Anne de Montmorency, the future Constable of\r\nFrance.[386]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: Melanchthon to Du Bellay, Aug. 1, 1534, Opera\r\n(Bretschneider, Corpus Reformatorum), ii. 740.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: This is only a brief summary of the most essential points\r\nin these strange articles, which may be read entire in Melanch.

The elector expressed himself at\r\ngreater length to his chancellor, Dr. Brück (Pontanus).

Melanchthon might make\r\nconcessions that Dr. Martin (Luther) and others could not agree to, and\r\nthe scandal of division might arise. Besides, he could not believe the\r\nFrench in earnest; they doubtless only intended to take advantage of\r\nMelanchthon's indecision.

It receives additional confirmation from a\r\nletter of the Nuncio Morone to Pope Paul III., Vienna, Dec. 26, 1536\r\n(Vatican MSS., Laemmer, 178). Morone received from Doctor Matthias,\r\nVice-Chancellor of the Empire, an account of Francis's recent offer to\r\nthe German Protestants \"_di condescendere nelle loro opinioni,_\" on\r\ncondition of their renouncing obedience to the emperor.

Such a point in the history of the Huguenots is\r\nmarked by the appearance of the \"Placards\" of 1534. The pusillanimous\r\nretreat of Bishop Briçonnet from the advanced post he had at first\r\nassumed, robbed Protestantism of an important advantage which might have\r\nbeen retained had the prelate proved true to his convictions. But the\r\n\"Placards,\" with their stern and uncompromising logic, their biting\r\nsarcasm, their unbridled invective, directed equally against the\r\nabsurdities of the mass and the inconsistencies of its advocates,\r\nexerted a far more lasting and powerful influence than even the\r\nlamentable defection of the Bishop of Meaux. Until now the attitude of\r\nFrancis with respect to the \"new doctrines\" had been uncertain and\r\nwavering. It was by no means impossible that, imitating the example of\r\nthe Elector of Saxony, the French monarch should even yet put himself at\r\nthe head of the movement. Severe persecution had, indeed, dogged the\r\nsteps of the Reformation. Fire and gibbet had been mercilessly employed\r\nto destroy it. The squares of Paris had already had the baptism of\r\nblood. But the cruelties complained of by the \"Lutherans,\" if tolerated\r\nby Francis, had their origin in the bigotry of others. The Sorbonne and\r\nthe Parisian Parliament, Chancellor Duprat and the queen mother, Louise\r\nof Savoie, are entitled to the unenviable distinction of having\r\ninstigated the sanguinary measures of repression directed against the\r\nprofessors of the Protestant faith, of which we have already met with\r\nmany fruits. The monarch, greedy of glory, ambitious of association with\r\ncultivated minds, and aspiring to the honor of ushering in the new\r\nAugustan age, more than once seemed half-inclined to embrace those\r\nreligious views which commended themselves to his taste by association\r\nwith the fresh and glowing ideas of the great masters in science and\r\nart. More than once had the champions of the Church trembled for their\r\nhold upon the sceptre-bearing arm; while as often their opponents, with\r\nFrancis's own sister, had cherished illusory hopes that the eloquent\r\naddresses of Roussel and other court-preachers had left a deep impress\r\non the king's heart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The orthodoxy of Francis no longer questioned.]\r\n\r\nBut the \"Placards\" effectually dissipated alike these hopes and these\r\nfears. There was no longer any question as to the orthodoxy of Francis.\r\nApologists for the Reformation might seek to undeceive his mind and\r\nremove his prejudices. His own emissaries might endeavor to persuade the\r\nGermans, of whose alliance he stood in need, that his views differed\r\nlittle from theirs. But there can be no doubt that, whatever his\r\nprevious intentions had been, from this time forth his resolution was\r\ntaken, to use his own expression already brought to the reader's notice,\r\nto live and die in Mother Holy Church, and demonstrate the justice of\r\nhis claim to the title of \"very Christian.\" The audacity of the\r\nProtestant enthusiast who penetrated even into the innermost recesses of\r\nthe royal castle, and affixed the placards to the very chamber door of\r\nthe king, was turned to good account by Cardinal Tournon and other\r\ncourtiers of like sentiments, and was adduced as a proof of the\r\nassertion so often reiterated, that a change of religion necessarily\r\ninvolved also a revolution in the State. The free tone of the placards\r\nseemed to reveal a contemptuous disregard of dignities. The ridicule\r\ncast upon the doctrine of transubstantiation was an assault on one of\r\nthe few dogmas respecting which Francis had implicit confidence in the\r\nteachings of the Church. Henceforth the king figures on the page of\r\nhistory as a determined opponent and persecutor of the Reformation, less\r\nhostile, indeed, to the \"Lutherans,\" than to the \"Sacramentarians,\" or\r\n\"Zwinglians,\" but nevertheless an avowed enemy of innovation. The\r\nchange was recognized and deplored by the Reformers themselves; who,\r\nseeing Francis in the last years of his reign give the rein to shameful\r\ndebauchery, and meantime suffer the public prisons to overflow with\r\nhundreds of innocent men and women, awaiting punishment for no other\r\noffence than their religious faith, pointedly compared him to the\r\neffeminate Sardanapalus surrounded by his courtezans.[387]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change in the courtiers.]\r\n\r\nWhile so marked a change came over the disposition of the king, it is\r\nnot strange that a similar revolution was noticed in the sentiments of\r\nthe courtiers--a class ever on the alert to detect the slightest\r\nvariation in the breeze to which they trim their sails. The greater part\r\nof the high dignitaries, the early historian of the reformed churches\r\ninforms us, adapting themselves to the king's humor, abandoned the study\r\nof the Bible, and in time became violent opponents of practices which\r\nthey had sanctioned by their own example. Even Margaret of Navarre is\r\naccused by the same authority--and he honestly represents the belief of\r\nthe contemporary reformers--of having yielded to these seductive\r\ninfluences. She plunged, like the rest, he tells us, into conformity\r\nwith the most reprehensible superstitions; not that she approved them,\r\nbut because Gérard Roussel and similar teachers persuaded her that they\r\nwere things indifferent. Thus, allowing herself to trifle with truth,\r\nshe was so blinded by the spirit of error as to offer an asylum in her\r\ncourt of Nérac to Quintin and Pocques, blasphemous \"Libertines\" whose\r\ndoctrines called forth a refutation from the pen of Calvin.[388]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Reformation becomes a popular movement.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geneva the centre of activity.]\r\n\r\nThe French Reformation was thus constrained to become a _popular_\r\nmovement. The king had refused to lead it. The nobles turned their backs\r\nupon it. Its adherents, threatened with the gallows and stake, or driven\r\ninto banishment, could no longer look for encouragement or direction\r\ntoward Paris and the vicinage of the court. The timid counsels of the\r\nhigh-born were to be exchanged for the bold and fiery words of reformers\r\nsprung from the _people_. Excluded from the luxurious capital, the\r\nHuguenots were, during a long series of years, to draw their inspiration\r\nfrom a city at the foot of the Alps--a city whose invigorating climate\r\nwas no less adapted to harden the intellectual and moral constitution\r\nthan the bodily frame, and where rugged Nature, if she bestowed wealth\r\nwith no lavish hand, manifested her impartiality by more liberal\r\nendowments conferred upon man himself. Geneva henceforth becomes the\r\ncentre of reformatory activity, of which fact we need no stronger\r\nevidence than the severe legislation of France to destroy its influence;\r\nand the same causes that gave the direction of the movement to the\r\npeople shaped its theological tendencies. Under the guidance of Francis\r\nand Margaret, it must have assumed much of the German or Lutheran type;\r\nor, to speak more correctly, the direct influence of Germany upon\r\nFrance, attested by the name of \"Lutherans,\" up to this time the\r\nordinary appellation of the French Protestants, would have been rendered\r\npermanent. But now the persecution they had experienced, in consequence\r\nof their opposition to the papal mass, confirmed the French reformers in\r\ntheir previous views, and disinclined them to admit even such a\r\n\"consubstantiation\" as Luther's followers insisted upon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geneva secures its independence.]\r\n\r\nThe same complicated political motives that led Francis to relax his\r\nexcessive rigor against the Protestants of his realm, in order to avoid\r\nprovoking the anger of the German princes, prompted him to assist in\r\nsecuring the independence of Geneva, which, at the time, he little\r\ndreamed would so soon become the citadel of French Protestantism. After\r\na prolonged contest, the city on the banks of the Rhône had shaken off\r\nthe yoke of its bishop, and had bravely repelled successive assaults\r\nmade by the Duke of Savoy. The first preachers of the Reformation, Farel\r\nand Froment, after a series of attempts and rebuffs for romantic\r\ninterest inferior to no other episode in an age of stirring adventure,\r\nhad seen the new worship accepted by the majority of the people, and by\r\nthe very advocates of the old system, Caroli and Chapuis. If the grand\r\ncouncil had thus far hesitated to give a formal sanction to the\r\nreligious change, it was only through fear that the taking of so decided\r\na step might provoke more powerful enemies than the neighboring duke.\r\nThe latter, being fully resolved to humble the insubordinate burgesses,\r\nhad for two years been striving to cut off their supplies by garrisons\r\nmaintained in adjoining castles and strongholds; nor would his plans,\r\nperhaps, have failed, but for the intervention of two powerful\r\nopponents--Francis and the Swiss Canton of Berne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: with the assistance of Francis I.]\r\n\r\nLouise de Savoie was the sister of Duke Charles. Her son had a double\r\ncause of resentment against his uncle: Charles had refused him free\r\npassage through his dominions, when marching against the Milanese; and,\r\ncontrary to all justice, he persistently refused to give up the marriage\r\nportion of his sister, the king's mother. Francis avenged himself, both\r\nfor the insult and for the robbery, by permitting a gentleman of his\r\nbedchamber, by the name of De Verez, a native of Savoy, to throw himself\r\ninto the beleaguered city with a body of French soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and the Bernese.]\r\n\r\nWhile Geneva was thus strengthened from within, the Bernese, on receipt\r\nof an unsatisfactory reply to an appeal in behalf of their allies, came\r\nto their assistance with an army of ten or twelve thousand men.\r\nDiscouraged by the threatening aspect his affairs had assumed, Charles\r\nrelaxed his grasp on the throat of his revolted subjects, and withdrew\r\nto a safe distance. His obstinacy, however, cost him the permanent loss\r\nnot only of Geneva, but of a considerable part of his most valuable\r\nterritories, including the Pays de Vaud--a district which, after\r\nremaining for more than two hundred and fifty years a dependency of\r\nBerne, has within the present century (in 1803), become an independent\r\ncanton of the Swiss confederacy.[389]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin the apologist of the Protestants.]\r\n\r\nThe horrible slanders put in circulation abroad, in justification of the\r\natrocities with which the unoffending Protestants of France were\r\nvisited, furnished the motive for the composition and publication of an\r\napology that instantly achieved unprecedented celebrity, and has long\r\noutlived the occasion that gave it birth. The apology was the\r\n\"Institutes;\" the author, John Calvin. With the appearance of his\r\nmasterpiece, a great writer and theologian, destined to exercise a wide\r\nand lasting influence not only upon France, but over the entire\r\nintellectual world, enters upon the stage of French history to take a\r\nleading part in the unfolding religious and political drama.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His birth and training.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Studies at Paris;]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: also at Orleans and Bourges.]\r\n\r\nJohn Calvin was born on the tenth of July, 1509, at Noyon, a small but\r\nancient city of Picardy. His family was of limited means, but of\r\nhonorable extraction. Gérard Cauvin, his father, had successively held\r\nimportant offices in connection with the episcopal see. As a man of\r\nclear and sound judgment, he was sought for his counsel by the gentry\r\nand nobility of the province--a circumstance that rendered it easy for\r\nhim to give to his son a more liberal course of instruction than\r\ngenerally fell to the lot of commoners. It is not denied by Calvin's\r\nmost bitter enemies that he early manifested striking ability. In\r\nselecting for him one of the learned professions, his father naturally\r\npreferred the church, as that in which he could most readily secure for\r\nhis son speedy promotion. It may serve to illustrate the degree of\r\nrespect at this time paid to the prescriptions of canon law, to note\r\nthat Charles de Hangest, Bishop of Noyon, conferred on John Calvin the\r\n_Chapelle de la Gésine_, with revenues sufficient for his maintenance,\r\nwhen the boy was but just twelve years of age! Such abuses as the gift\r\nof ecclesiastical benefices to beardless youths, however, were of too\r\nfrequent occurrence to attract special notice or call forth unfriendly\r\ncriticism. With the same easy disregard of churchly order the chapter of\r\nthe cathedral of Noyon permitted Calvin, two years later, to go to\r\nParis, for the purpose of continuing his studies, without loss of\r\nincome; although, to save appearances, a pretext was found in the\r\nprevalence of some contagious disease in Picardy. Not long after, his\r\nfather perceiving the singular proficiency he manifested, determined to\r\nalter his plans, and devoted his son to the more promising department of\r\nthe law, a decision in which Calvin himself, already conscious of secret\r\naversion for the superstitions of the papal system, seems dutifully to\r\nhave acquiesced. To a friend and near relation, Pierre Robert\r\nOlivetanus, the future translator of the Bible, he probably owed both\r\nthe first impulse toward legal studies and the enkindling of his\r\ninterest in the Sacred Scriptures. Proceeding next to Orleans, in the\r\nuniversity of which the celebrated Pierre de l'Étoile, afterward\r\nPresident of the Parliament of Paris, was lecturing on law with great\r\napplause, Calvin in a short time achieved distinction. Marvellous\r\nstories were told of his rapid mastery of his subject. Not only did he\r\noccasionally fill the chair of an absent professor, and himself lecture,\r\nto the great admiration of the classes, but he was offered the formal\r\nrank of the doctorate without payment of the customary fees. Declining\r\nan honorable distinction which would have interfered with his plan of\r\nperfecting himself elsewhere, he subsequently visited the University of\r\nBourges, in order to enjoy the rare advantage of listening to Andrea\r\nAlciati, of Milan, reputed the most learned and eloquent legal\r\ninstructor of the age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His studies under Wolmar.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Calvin's interest in biblical study had been\r\nsteadily growing, and at Bourges that great intellectual and religious\r\nchange appears to have been effected which was essential to his future\r\nsuccess as a reformer. He attached himself to Melchior Wolmar, a\r\ndistinguished professor of Greek, who had brought with him from Germany\r\na fervent zeal for the Protestant doctrines. Wolmar, reading in the\r\nyoung law student the brilliant abilities that were one day to make his\r\nname illustrious, prevailed upon him to devote himself to the study of\r\nthe New Testament in the original. Day and night were spent in the\r\nengrossing pursuit, and here were laid the foundations of that profound\r\nbiblical erudition which, at a later date, amazed the world, as well,\r\nunfortunately, as of that feeble bodily health that embittered all\r\nCalvin's subsequent life with the most severe and painful maladies, and\r\nabridged in years an existence crowded with great deeds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Translates Seneca \"De Clementia.\"]\r\n\r\nThe illness and death of his father called Calvin back to Noyon,[390]\r\nbut in 1529 we find him again in Paris, where three years later he\r\npublished his first literary effort. This was a commentary on the two\r\nbooks of Seneca, \"De Clementia,\" originally addressed to the Emperor\r\nNero. The opinion has long prevailed that it was no casual selection of\r\na theme, but that Calvin had conceived the hope of mitigating hereby the\r\nseverity of the persecution then raging. The author's own\r\ncorrespondence, however, betrays less anxiety for the attainment of that\r\nlofty aim, than nervous uneasiness respecting the literary success of\r\nhis first venture. Indeed, this is not the only indication that, while\r\nCalvin was already, in 1532, an accomplished scholar, he was scarcely as\r\nyet a _reformer_, and that the stories of his activity before this time\r\nas a leader and religious teacher, at Paris and even at Bourges, deserve\r\nonly to be classed with the questionable myths obscuring much of his\r\nhistory up to the time of his appearance at Geneva.[391]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin's escape from Paris to Angoulême.]\r\n\r\nThe incident that occasioned Calvin's flight from Paris was narrated in\r\na previous chapter. Escaping from the officers sent to apprehend him as\r\nthe real author of the inaugural address of the rector, Nicholas Cop,\r\nCalvin found safety and scholastic leisure in the house of his friend\r\nLouis du Tillet, at Angoulême. If we could believe the accounts of later\r\nwriters, we should imagine the young scholar dividing his time in this\r\nretreat between the preparation of his \"Institutes\" and systematic\r\nlabors for the conversion of the inhabitants of the south-west of\r\nFrance. Tradition still points out the grottos in the vicinity of\r\nPoitiers, where, during a residence in that city, Calvin is said to have\r\nexclaimed, pointing to the Bible lying open before him: \"Here is my\r\nmass;\" and then, with uncovered head and eyes turned toward heaven,\r\n\"Lord, if at the judgment-day thou shalt reprove me because I have\r\nabandoned the mass, I shall reply with justice, 'Lord, thou hast not\r\ncommanded it. Here is thy law. Here are the Scriptures, the rule thou\r\nhast given me, wherein I have been unable to find any other sacrifice\r\nthan that which was offered upon the altar of the cross!'\"[392]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He resigns his benefices.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He reaches Basle.]\r\n\r\nThe caverns bearing Calvin's name may never have witnessed his\r\npreaching, and the address ascribed to him rests on insufficient\r\nauthority;[393] but it is certain that the future reformer about this\r\ntime took his first decided step in renouncing connection with the Roman\r\nChurch, by resigning his benefices, the revenues of which he had\r\nenjoyed, although precluded by his youth from receiving ordination.[394]\r\nNot many months later, finding himself solicited on all sides to take an\r\nactive part as a teacher of the little companies of Protestants arising\r\nin different cities of France, he resolved to leave France and court\r\nelsewhere obscurity and leisure to prosecute undisturbed his favorite\r\nstudies.[395] Accordingly, we find him, after a brief visit to Paris and\r\nOrleans, reaching the city of Basle, apparently toward the close of the\r\nyear 1534.[396]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apologetic character given to his great work.]\r\n\r\nIt was here that Calvin appears to have conceived for the first time the\r\npurpose of giving a practical aim to the great work upon the composition\r\nof which he had been some time busy. In spite of his professions of\r\nunsullied honor, Francis the First had not hesitated to disseminate, by\r\nmeans of his agents beyond the Rhine, the most unfounded and injurious\r\nreports respecting his Protestant subjects. It was time that these\r\naspersions should be cleared away, and an attempt be made to touch the\r\nheart of the persecuting monarch with compassion for the unoffending\r\nobjects of his blind fury. Such was the object Calvin set before himself\r\nin a preface to the first edition of the \"Institutes,\" addressed \"To the\r\nVery Christian King of France.\"[397] It was a document of rare\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The preface to the \"Christian Institutes.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eloquent peroration.]\r\n\r\nHe briefly explained the original design of his work to be the\r\ninstruction of his countrymen, whom he knew to be hungering and\r\nthirsting for the truth. But the persecutions that had arisen and that\r\nleft no place for sound doctrine in France induced him to make the\r\nattempt at the same time to acquaint the king with the real character of\r\nthe Protestants and their belief. He assured Francis that the book\r\ncontained nothing more nor less than the creed for the profession of\r\nwhich so many Frenchmen were being visited with imprisonment,\r\nbanishment, outlawry, and even fire, and which it was sought to\r\nexterminate from the earth. He drew a fearful picture of the calumnies\r\nlaid to the charge of this devoted people, and of the wretched church of\r\nFrance, already half destroyed, yet still a butt for the rage of its\r\nenemies. It was the part of a true king, as the vicegerent of God, to\r\nadminister justice in a cause so worthy of his consideration. Nor ought\r\nthe humble condition of the oppressed to indispose him to grant them a\r\nhearing; for the doctrine they professed was not their own, but that of\r\nthe Almighty himself. He boldly contrasted the evangelical with the\r\npapal church, and refuted the objections urged against the former. He\r\ndefended its doctrine from the charge of novelty, denied that\r\nmiracles--especially such lying wonders as those of Rome--were necessary\r\nin confirmation of its truth, and showed that the ancient Fathers, far\r\nfrom countenancing, on the contrary, condemned the superstitions of the\r\nday. He refuted the charge that Protestants forsook old customs when\r\ngood, or abandoned the only visible church; and in a masterly manner\r\nvindicated the Reformation from the oft-repeated charge of being the\r\ncause of sedition, conflict, and confusion. He begged for a fair and\r\nimpartial hearing. \"But,\" he exclaimed in concluding, \"if the\r\nsuggestions of the malevolent so fill your ears as to leave no room for\r\nthe reply of the accused, and those importunate furies continue, with\r\nyour consent, to rage with bonds and stripes, with torture,\r\nconfiscation, and fire, then shall we yield ourselves up as sheep\r\nappointed for slaughter, yet so as to possess our souls in patience, and\r\nawait the mighty hand of God, which will assuredly be revealed in good\r\ntime, and be stretched forth armed for the deliverance of the poor from\r\ntheir affliction, and for the punishment of the blasphemers now exulting\r\nin confidence of safety. May the Lord of Hosts, illustrious king,\r\nestablish your seat in righteousness and your throne with equity.\"[398]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Has no effect in allaying persecution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin achieves distinction.]\r\n\r\nThe learned theologian's eloquent appeal failed to accomplish its end.\r\nIf Francis ever received, he probably disdained to read even the\r\ndedication, classed by competent critics among the best specimens of\r\nwriting in the French language,[399] and must have regarded the volume\r\nto which it was prefixed as a bold vindication of heresy, and scarcely\r\nless insulting to his majesty than the placards themselves. Others,\r\nbetter capable of forming a competent judgment, or more willing to give\r\nit a dispassionate examination, applauded the success of a hazardous\r\nundertaking that might have appalled even a more experienced writer than\r\nthe French exile of Noyon. The Institutes gave to a young man, who had\r\nscarcely attained the age at which men of mark usually begin to occupy\r\nthemselves with important enterprises, the reputation of being the\r\nforemost theologian of the age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He revises the Bible of Olivetanus.]\r\n\r\nOther studies invited Calvin's attention. Not content with perfecting\r\nhimself in the original languages of the Holy Scriptures, he revised\r\nwith care the French Protestant Bible, translated by his relation\r\nOlivetanus, of which we shall have occasion to speak in another chapter.\r\nMeanwhile, in an age of intense mental and moral awakening, no\r\nscholastic repose, such as he had pictured to himself, awaited one who\r\nhad made good his right to a foremost rank among the athletes in the\r\nintellectual arena.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Visits Italy.]\r\n\r\nBefore his unexpected call to a life of unremitting conflict, Calvin\r\nvisited Italy. In the entire absence of any trustworthy statement of the\r\noccasion of this journey, it is almost idle to speculate on the objects\r\nhe had in view.[400] Certain, however, it is that the court of the\r\nDuchess Renée, at Ferrara, offered to a patriotic Frenchman attractions\r\nhard to be resisted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The court of Renée de France.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brantôme's eulogy of Renée.]\r\n\r\nThe younger daughter of Louis the Twelfth resembled her father not less\r\nin character than in appearance and speech.[401] Cut off by the\r\npretended Salic law from the prospect of ascending the throne, she had\r\nin her childhood been thrown as a straw upon the variable tide of\r\nfortune. After having been promised in marriage to Charles of Spain,\r\nheir to the most extensive and opulent dominions the sun shone upon, and\r\nfuture Emperor of Germany, she had (1528) been given in marriage to the\r\nruler of a petty Italian duchy, himself as inferior to her in mind as in\r\nmoral character.[402] As for Renée, if her face was homely and\r\nunprepossessing, her intellect was vigorous. She had turned to good\r\naccount the opportunities for self-improvement afforded by her high\r\nrank. Admiring courtiers made her classical and philosophical\r\nattainments the subject of lavish panegyric, perhaps with a better basis\r\nof fact than in the case of many other princes of the time; while with\r\nthe French, her countrymen, the generous hospitality she dispensed won\r\nfor her unfading laurels. \"Never was there a Frenchman,\" writes the Abbé\r\nde Brantôme, \"who passing through Ferrara applied to her in his distress\r\nand was suffered to depart without receiving ample assistance to reach\r\nhis native land and home. If he were unable to travel through illness,\r\nshe had him cared for and treated with the utmost solicitude, and then\r\ngave him money to continue his journey.\"[403] Ten thousand poor\r\nFrenchmen are said to have been saved by her munificent charity, on the\r\noccasion of the recall of the Duke of Guise, after Constable\r\nMontmorency's disastrous defeat at St. Quentin. Her answer to the\r\nremonstrance of her servants against this excessive drain upon her\r\nslender resources bore witness at once to the sincerity of her\r\npatriotism and to a virile spirit which no Salic law could\r\nextinguish.[404]\r\n\r\nThe brief stay of Calvin at Ferrara is involved in the same obscurity\r\nthat attends his motives in visiting Italy. But it is known that he\r\nexerted at this time a marked influence not only on others,[405] but on\r\nRenée de France herself, who, from this period forward, appears in the\r\ncharacter of an avowed friend of the reformatory movement. Calvin had\r\nfrom prudence assumed the title of _Charles d'Espeville_, and this name\r\nwas retained as a signature in his subsequent correspondence with the\r\nduchess.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin leaves Ferrara.]\r\n\r\nA point so close to the centre of the Roman Catholic world as Ferrara\r\ncould scarcely afford safety to an ardent reformer, even if the fame of\r\nhis \"Institutes\" had not yet reached Rome; and Ercole the Second was too\r\ndependent upon the Holy See to shrink from sacrificing the guest his\r\nwife had invited to the palace. Returning, therefore, from Ferrara,\r\nwithout apparently pursuing his journey to Rome or even to Florence,\r\nCalvin retraced his steps and took refuge beyond the Alps. Possibly he\r\nmay have stopped on the way in the valley of Aosta, and displayed a\r\nmissionary activity, which has been denied by several modern critics,\r\nbut is attested by local monuments and tradition, and has some support\r\nin contemporary documents.[406]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revisits France.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is recognized while passing through Geneva.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farel compels him to remain.]\r\n\r\nOnce more in Basle, Calvin resolved, after a final visit to the home of\r\nhis childhood, to seek out some quiet spot in Germany, there to give\r\nhimself up to those scholarly labors which he fancied would be more\r\nprofitable to France than the most active enterprises he might engage in\r\nas a preacher of the Gospel. He had accomplished the first part of his\r\ndesign, had disposed of his property in Noyon, and was returning with\r\nhis brother and sister, when the prevalence of war in the Duchy of\r\nLorraine led him to diverge from his most direct route, so as to\r\ntraverse the dominions of the Duke of Savoy and the territories of the\r\nconfederate cantons of Switzerland. Under these circumstances, for the\r\nfirst time, he entered the city of Geneva, then but recently delivered\r\nfrom the yoke of its bishop and of the Roman Church. He had intended to\r\nspend there only a single night.[407] He was accidentally recognized by\r\nan old friend, a Frenchman, who at the time professed the reformed\r\nfaith, but subsequently returned to the communion of the Church of\r\nRome.[408] Du Tillet was the only person in Geneva that detected in the\r\ntraveller, Charles d'Espeville, the John Calvin who had written the\r\n\"Institutes.\" He confided the secret to Farel, and the intrepid reformer\r\nwhose office it had hitherto been to demolish, by unsparing and\r\npersistent blows, the popular structure of superstition, at once\r\nconcluded that, in answer to his prayers, a man had been sent him by God\r\ncapable of laying, amid the ruins, the foundations of a new and more\r\nperfect fabric. Farel sought Calvin out, and laid before him the urgent\r\nnecessities of a church founded in a city where, under priestly rule,\r\ndisorder and corruption had long been rampant. At first his words made\r\nno impression. Calvin had traced out for himself a very different\r\ncourse, and was little inclined to exchange a life of study for the\r\nperpetual struggles to which he was so unexpectedly summoned. But when\r\nhe met Farel's request with a positive refusal, pleading inexperience,\r\nfondness for literary pursuits, and aversion to scenes of tumult and\r\nconfusion, the Genevese reformer assumed a more decided tone. Acting\r\nunder an impulse for which he could scarcely account himself, Farel\r\nsolemnly prayed that the curse of God might descend on Calvin's leisure\r\nand studies, if purchased at the price of neglecting the duty to which\r\nthe voice of the Almighty Himself, by His providence, distinctly called\r\nhim.[409]\r\n\r\nThe amazed and terrified student felt--to use his own expression--that\r\nGod had stretched forth His arm from heaven and laid violent hold upon\r\nhim, rendering all further resistance impossible. He yielded to the\r\nunwelcome call, and became the first theological professor of Geneva.\r\nSomewhat later he was prevailed upon to add to his functions the duties\r\nof one of the pastors of the city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farel's own recollections.]\r\n\r\nIf the scene impressed itself ineffaceably on the memory or one of the\r\nprincipal actors, its effect, we may be sure, was no less lasting in the\r\ncase of the other. More than a quarter of a century after, Farel, on\r\nreceiving the announcement that his worst apprehensions had been\r\nrealized, in the death of his \"so dear and necessary brother Calvin,\"\r\nwrote to a friend a touching letter, in which he referred in a few\r\nsentences to the same striking interview. \"Oh, why am not I taken away\r\nin his stead, and why is not he, so useful, so serviceable, here in\r\nhealth, to minister long to the churches of our Lord! To Whom be\r\nblessing and praise, that, of His grace, He made me fall in with him\r\nwhere I had never expected to meet him, and, contrary to his own plans,\r\ncompelled him to stop at Geneva, and made use of him there and\r\nelsewhere! For he was urged on one side and another more than could be\r\ntold, and _specially by me_, who, in God's name, urged him to undertake\r\nmatters that were harder than death. And albeit _he begged me several\r\ntimes, in the name of God, to have mercy on him and suffer him to serve\r\nGod in other ways_, as he has always thus occupied himself,\r\nnevertheless, seeing that what I asked was in accordance with God's\r\nwill, in doing himself violence he has done more and more promptly than\r\nany one else has done, surpassing not only others, but himself. Oh, how\r\nhappily has he run an excellent race!\"[410]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin becomes the head of the commonwealth.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His view respecting church and state,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and the punishment of heresy.]\r\n\r\nFor twenty-eight years the name of Calvin was inseparably associated\r\nwith that of the city which owes its chief renown to his connection with\r\nit. Excepting the three years of exile, from 1538 to 1541, occasioned by\r\na powerful reaction against his rigid system of public morality, he was,\r\nduring the whole of this period, the recognized head of the Genevese\r\ncommonwealth. A complete mastery of the principles of law, acquired by\r\nindefatigable study at Orleans and Bourges, before the loftier teachings\r\nof theology engrossed his time and faculties, qualified him to draw up a\r\ncode to regulate the affairs of his adopted country. If its detailed\r\nprohibitions and almost Draconian severity are repugnant to the spirit\r\nof the present age, the general wisdom of the legislator is vindicated\r\nby the circumstance that he transformed a city noted for the prevalence\r\nof every form of turbulence and immorality into the most orderly\r\nrepublic of Christendom. Few, it is true, will be found to defend the\r\ntheory respecting the duty of the state toward the church in which\r\nCalvin acquiesced. But the cruel deaths of Gruet and Servetus were only\r\nthe legitimate fruits of the doctrine that the civil authority is both\r\nempowered and bound to exercise vigilant supervision over the purity of\r\nthe church. In this doctrine the reformers of the sixteenth century were\r\nfirm believers. They held, as John Huss had held a hundred years\r\nbefore, that _Truth_ could appropriately appeal for support to physical\r\nforce, under circumstances that would by no means have justified a\r\nsimilar resort on the part of _Error_. The consistent language of their\r\nlives was, \"If we speak not the truth, we refuse not to die.\" \"If the\r\nPope condemns the pious for heresy, and furious judges unjustly execute\r\non the innocent the penalty due to heretics, what madness is it thence\r\nto infer that heretics ought not to be destroyed for the purpose of\r\naiding the pious! As for myself, since I read that Paul said that he did\r\nnot refuse death if he had done anything to deserve it, I openly offered\r\nmyself frequently prepared to undergo sentence of death, if I had taught\r\nanything contrary to the doctrine of piety. And I added, that I was most\r\nworthy of any punishment imaginable, if I seduced any one from the faith\r\nand doctrine of Christ. _Assuredly I cannot have a different view with\r\nregard to others from that which I entertain respecting myself._\"[411]\r\nSo wrote Farel, and almost all his contemporaries agreed with him. And\r\nthus it happened that the conscientious Calvin and the polished Beza\r\nwere at the pains of writing long treatises, to prove that \"heretics are\r\njustly to be constrained by the sword,\"[412] almost at the very moment\r\nwhen they were begging the Bernese to intercede with their ally, King\r\nHenry the Second, of France, in behalf of the poor Protestants\r\nlanguishing in the dungeons of Lyons, or writing consolatory letters to\r\nPeloquin and De Marsac, destined to suffer death in the flames not many\r\ndays before the execution of the Spanish physician at Geneva.[413]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His fault the fault of the age.]\r\n\r\nIn truth, however, it was less Calvin than the age in which he lived\r\nthat must be held responsible for the crime against humanity with which\r\nhis name has come to be popularly associated. He did, indeed, desire and\r\nurge that Servetus should be punished capitally, although he made an\r\nearnest but unsuccessful effort to induce the magistrates to mitigate\r\nthe severity of the sentence, by the substitution of some more merciful\r\nmode of execution.[414] But the other principal reformers of Germany and\r\nSwitzerland--Melanchthon, Haller, Peter Martyr, and Bullinger gave their\r\nhearty endorsement to the cruel act;[415] while if any further proof\r\nwere needed to attest the sincerity and universality of approval\r\naccorded to it, it is afforded by the last letters of the brave men who\r\nwere themselves awaiting at Chambéry, a few mouths later, death by the\r\nsame excruciating fate as that which befell Servetus at Geneva.[416]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin shuns notoriety.]\r\n\r\nThe prominence obtained by Calvin as chief theologian and pastor of the\r\nchurch of Geneva, however, was foreign to his tastes. He was by\r\npreference a scholar, averse to notoriety, fond of retirement, and, if\r\nwe are to believe his own judgment, timid and even pusillanimous by\r\nnature.[417] He had in vain sought seclusion in France. From Basle and\r\nStrasbourg he made a hasty retreat in order to preserve his incognito,\r\nand avoid the fame the Institutes were likely to earn for him.[418] Only\r\nFarel's adjuration detained him in Geneva, and he subsequently confessed\r\nthat his fortitude was not so great but that he rejoiced even more than\r\nwas meet when the turbulent Genevese expelled him from their city.[419]\r\nBut not even then was he able to secure the coveted quiet, for Martin\r\nBucer was not slow in imitating the urgency of Farel, and employed the\r\nwarning example of the prophet Jonah seeking to flee from the will of\r\nthe Almighty, to induce him to employ himself in the organization and\r\nadministration of the French church at Strasbourg.[420] Not less decided\r\nwas Calvin's reluctance to accede to the repeated invitations of the\r\ncouncil and people of Geneva, that he should return and resume his\r\nformer position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His character and natural endowments.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is consulted by Protestants in every quarter of Europe.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who was called to take the reins of the spiritual\r\ndirection, not only of a single small city, but of a large body of\r\nearnest thinkers throughout France, and even to distant parts of\r\nChristendom--a man of stern and uncompromising devotion to that system\r\nwhich he believed to be truth; of slender imagination, but of a memory\r\nprodigious in its grasp, of an understanding wonderfully acute, and of\r\na power of exposition and expression unsurpassed by that possessed by\r\nany writer among his contemporaries. His constitution, naturally weak,\r\nhad been still further enfeebled by excessive application to study. In\r\nhis letters there are frequent references to the interruptions\r\noccasioned by violent pains in his head, often compelling him to stop\r\nmany times in the writing of a single letter.[421] His strength was\r\ntaxed to the utmost by the unremitting toil incident to his multifarious\r\noccupations. The very recital of his labors fills us with amazement. He\r\npreached twice every Sunday, besides frequent sermons on other days. He\r\nlectured three times a week on theology. He made addresses in the\r\nconsistory, and delivered a lecture every Friday in the conference on\r\nthe Scriptures known as the \"Congrégation.\" To these public burdens must\r\nbe added others imposed upon him by his wide reputation. From all parts\r\nof the Protestant world, but especially from every spot in France where\r\nthe Reformation had gained a foothold, the opinion of Calvin was eagerly\r\nsought on various points of doctrine and ecclesiastical practice. To\r\nGeneva, and especially to Calvin, the obscure and persecuted adherents\r\nof the same faith, not less than the most illustrious of the Protestant\r\nnobility, looked for counsel and direction. Under his guidance that\r\nsystem was adopted for supplying France with ministers of the Gospel\r\nwhich led the Venetian ambassador, near the end of the great reformer's\r\nlife, to describe Geneva as the mine from which the ore of heresy was\r\nextracted.[422] How faithfully he discharged the trust committed to him\r\nis sufficiently attested by a voluminous correspondence, some portions\r\nof which have escaped the wreck of time; while the steady advance of the\r\ndoctrines he advocated is an enduring monument to the zeal and sagacity\r\nof his exertions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meets with bitter opposition,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: but obtains the support of the people.]\r\n\r\nIn his arduous undertaking, however, Calvin had to encounter no little\r\nopposition in the very city of Geneva. It was this, even more than\r\nbodily infirmity, that bore severely upon his spirits, and robbed him of\r\nthe rest demanded alike by his overtaxed body and mind. His advocacy of\r\nstrenuous discipline procured him relentless enemies among the Genevese\r\nof the \"Libertine\" party. Those were stormy times for Calvin, when, in\r\nderision of the student, legislator, and theologian, deafening salutes\r\nwere fired by night before his doors, and when the dogs were set upon\r\nhim in the streets.[423] But, when we read of the violent antagonism\r\nelicited by the publication of the severe provisions of the\r\n\"Ordinances,\" regulating even the minor details of the life of a\r\nGenevese citizen, it must not be forgotten that the unpopular system,\r\nalthough devised by Calvin, was not imposed by him upon unwilling\r\nsubjects, but established by a free and decisive vote of the people, in\r\nthe exercise of its sovereignty, and influenced to its adoption by the\r\nsame considerations that had determined Calvin himself in devising\r\nit.[424]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An estimate of Calvin by Étienne Pasquier.]\r\n\r\nSuch a man could not fail to secure the respect of his opponents, and\r\nthe undisguised admiration of all who could regard his character and\r\nwork with some degree of impartiality. Among the most virtuous of his\r\ncontemporaries was the excellent Étienne Pasquier, who described him as\r\nhe appeared in the eyes of men of culture--men who, without forsaking\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church, were stanch friends of reform and of\r\nprogress. \"He was a man,\" says Pasquier, \"that wrote equally well in\r\nLatin and in French, and to whom our French tongue is greatly indebted\r\nfor having enriched it with an infinite number of fine touches. It were\r\nmy wish that it had been for a better subject. He was a man, moreover,\r\nmarvellously versed and nurtured in the books of the Holy Scriptures,\r\nand such that, had he directed his mind in the right way, he might have\r\nranked with the most illustrious doctors of the church. And, in the\r\nmidst of his books and his studies, he was possessed of the most active\r\nzeal for the progress of his sect. We sometimes saw our prisons\r\noverflowing with poor, misled people, whom he unceasingly exhorted,\r\nconsoled, and comforted by his letters; and there were never lacking\r\nmessengers to whom the doors were open, in spite of any exertions of the\r\njailers to the contrary. Such were the methods by which he gained over\r\nstep by step a part of our France.\"[425]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued persecution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tongues of the victims cut out, and records burned.]\r\n\r\nThe flames of the persecution kindled by the publication of the placards\r\ncontinued to burn. From Paris, where Laurent de la Croix fell a victim\r\nto the rage of the priests, the conflagration spread to Essarts, in\r\nPoitou, where a simple girl was consigned to the fire for reproving a\r\nFranciscan monk; and to Macon, where an unlearned peasant underwent a\r\nlike punishment, amazing his judges by the familiarity he displayed with\r\nthe Bible. Agen, in Guyenne, and Beaune, in Burgundy, witnessed similar\r\nscenes of atrocious cruelty; while at Nonnay, André Berthelin was burned\r\nalive, because, when wending his way to the great fair of Lyons, he\r\nrefused to kneel down before one of the many pictures or images set up\r\nby the roadside for popular adoration. At Rouen, four brave reformers\r\nwere thrown into a tumbril, reeking with filth, to be drawn to the place\r\nof execution, one of them exclaiming with radiant countenance: \"Truly,\r\nas says the apostle, we are the offscouring of the earth, and we now\r\nstink in the nostrils of the men of the world. But let us rejoice, for\r\nthe savor of our death will be a sweet savor unto God, and will profit\r\nour brethren.\"[426] But the details of these executions are too horrible\r\nand too similar to find a place here. Nor, indeed, would it be possible\r\nto frame a complete statement of the case of each of the constant\r\nsufferers; for, from this time forward, it became a favorite practice\r\nwith those who presided over these bloody assizes to cut out the tongues\r\nof their victims, lest their eloquent appeals should shake the\r\nconfidence of the spectators in the established faith, and afterward to\r\nthrow the official record of the trial of Protestants into the fire that\r\nconsumed their bodies, in order to prevent its furnishing edifying\r\nmaterial for the martyrology.[427]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of persecution.]\r\n\r\nBut, as usual, persecution failed utterly of accomplishing what had been\r\nexpected of it. For a brief moment, indeed, Francis flattered himself\r\nthat exemplary punishments had purged his kingdom of the professors of\r\nthe hated doctrines.[428] But, in the course of a few years, he\r\ndiscovered that, in spite of continued severities, the \"new faith\" had\r\nso spread--partly by means of persons suffered to return, in virtue of\r\nthe royal declaration of Coucy (on the sixteenth of July, 1535), and\r\npartly through the teachings of others who lay concealed during the\r\nfirst violence of the storm--that he had good reason to fear that the\r\nlast errors were worse than the first.[429] What rendered the matter\r\nstill more serious was the favor shown to the heretics by persons of\r\nhigh rank and influence.[430]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Fontainebleau cuts off appeal, June 1, 1540.]\r\n\r\nWith the view of employing still more rigid means for the detection and\r\npunishment of the offenders, a fresh edict was published from\r\nFontainebleau, on the first of June, 1540. In this long and sanguinary\r\ndocument the monarch--or the Cardinal of Tournon, who enjoyed the credit\r\nof a principal part in its preparation--enjoined upon the officers of\r\nall the royal courts, whether judges of parliament, seneschals, or\r\nbailiffs, to institute proceedings concurrently against all persons\r\ntainted with heresy. No appeal was to be permitted to delay their\r\naction. The examination of the suspected took precedence of all other\r\ncases. Tribunals of inferior jurisdiction were instructed to send\r\nprisoners for heresy, together with the record of their examination, to\r\nthe sovereign courts of parliament, there to be tried in the \"Chambre\r\ncriminelle.\" The appeal to the \"Grand' chambre,\" customarily allowed to\r\npersons claiming immunity on account of order or station, was expressly\r\ncut off, so as to render the course of justice more expeditious.\r\nNegligent judges were threatened with suspension and removal from\r\noffice. The high vassals of the crown were ordered to lend to the royal\r\ncourts their counsel and assistance, and to surrender to them all\r\noffenders as guilty of sedition and disturbance of the public\r\npeace--crimes of which the king claimed exclusive cognizance.\r\nEcclesiastics were exhorted to show equal diligence in the prosecution\r\nof culprits that were in orders. In short, every servant of the king was\r\nbidden to abstain from harboring or favoring the \"Lutherans,\" since the\r\nerrors and false doctrines the latter disseminated, it was said,\r\ncontained within them the crime of treason against God and the king, as\r\nwell as of sedition and riot.[431] Every loyal subject must, therefore,\r\ndenounce the heretics and employ all means to extirpate them, just as\r\nall men are bound to run to help in extinguishing a public\r\nconflagration.[432]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exceptional fairness of President Caillaud.]\r\n\r\nThe last injunction was not altogether unnecessary. Even among the\r\njudges of parliament there were fair-minded persons not inclined to\r\ncondemn accused men or books on mere report. The ambassador of Henry the\r\nEighth having, in 1538, denounced an English translation of the Holy\r\nScriptures that was in press at Paris, the chancellor commissioned\r\nPresident Caillaud to investigate the case. The latter, finding that the\r\nprinter's excuse was the scarcity of paper in England, quietly set about\r\na comparison of the suspected version with accessible French\r\ntranslations. He said nothing to doctors of theology or royal\r\nprosecuting officers. \"It seemed to me,\" he reported, \"quite unnecessary\r\nto give the matter such notoriety. Moreover, I mistrusted that, without\r\nfurther investigation, without even looking into it, they would have\r\ncondemned the English translation for the sole reason that it is in that\r\ntongue. For I have seen them sustain that the Holy Scriptures ought not\r\nto be translated into the French language or any other vernacular\r\ntongue. Nevertheless, the Bible in French was printed in this city so\r\nlong ago as in 1529, and again this present year, and is for sale by the\r\nmost wealthy printers. For my part I have seen no prohibition either by\r\nthe church or by the secular authority, although I once heard some\r\ndecretal alleged in condemnation.\" Unfortunately such judges as Louis\r\nCaillaud were rare--men that would take the pains to obtain the services\r\nof a person acquainted with the English language to translate aloud a\r\nBible suspected of heretical teachings, while themselves testing its\r\naccuracy by scanning versions made from the Vulgate and the Hebrew\r\noriginal![433]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal letters from Lyons, Aug. 30, 1542.]\r\n\r\nTwo years more had scarcely passed before fresh legislation against the\r\nProtestants demonstrated the impotence of all measures thus far resorted\r\nto. The interval had certainly been improved by their enemies, for the\r\nstake had its victims to boast of.[434] And yet the new religious body\r\nhad its ministers and its secret conventicles, with an ever increasing\r\nnumber of adherents. Accordingly, on the thirtieth of August, 1542,\r\nFrancis, then at Lyons, addressed new letters patent to the various\r\nparliaments, enjoining new vigilance and activity. Previous edicts had\r\nnot borne all the fruit expected from them; for there was still a bad\r\nseed of error and damnable doctrines--so wrote the king--growing and\r\nmultiplying from day to day. So exemplary a punishment must, therefore,\r\nbe inflicted, as might forever terrify offenders.[435] The king even\r\nthreatened delinquent prelates with seizure of their temporalities, in\r\ncase they failed to exercise due diligence in so important a\r\nmatter.[436]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Audacity of the \"Lutherans\" of Bordeaux.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis I. and the Sacramentarians.]\r\n\r\nKing, bishops and parliaments were terribly in earnest. All were agreed\r\nthat Protestantism must and should be crushed, however little they\r\nharmonized as to the reasons of its increase or the method of\r\nsuppressing it. The Archbishop of Bordeaux denounced to the parliament\r\nof that city the growing audacity of the \"Lutherans\" of his diocese, who\r\nhad even dared to preach their doctrines publicly. He accounted for this\r\ndisorder by the fact that the prosecution and exemplary punishment of\r\nheretics had ceased to be the uniform rule; as if the experience of the\r\npast score of years had not demonstrated the futility of attempting to\r\ncompel religious uniformity by the fear of human tribunals and\r\nignominious death. He therefore begged the parliament to spare neither\r\nhim nor his brother prelates in the matter of defraying the expense of\r\nbringing \"Lutherans\" to trial and death. The secular judges were of the\r\nsame mind with the prelates, and both took new courage from a\r\ndeclaration of Francis himself, which the archbishop had recently heard\r\nwith his own ears at Angoulême. In the presence of Cardinal Tournon and\r\nothers, the king had assured him that \"_he desired that no\r\nsacramentarian should be permitted to abjure, but that all such heretics\r\nshould be remorselessly put to death_!\"[437] By such pitiless measures\r\ndid Francis still think to establish his unimpeachable loyalty to the\r\ndoctrine of transubstantiation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal ordinance of Paris, July 23, 1543.]\r\n\r\nBut, as ill success continued to attend every attempt to crush the\r\nReformation in France, it was necessary to find some plausible\r\nexplanation of the failure. The ecclesiastical counsellors of the king\r\nalleged that they discovered it in the recent edicts themselves, which\r\nthey represented as derogating from the efficiency of both prelates and\r\ninquisitors of the faith. To meet this new objection, Francis\r\ncomplaisantly published another ordinance (on the twenty-third of July,\r\n1543), carefully defining the respective provinces of the lay and\r\nclerical judges. Prelates and inquisitors were authorized to proceed, in\r\naccordance with canon law, to obtain information alike against clergymen\r\nand laymen, in case of suspected heresy, and the secular judges were\r\nstrictly enjoined to afford them all needed assistance in execution of\r\ntheir writs of summons and arrest. But all persons guilty of open\r\nheresy, and not actually in holy orders, must be given over, together\r\nwith the documents relating to their offences, to the royal judges and\r\nto the courts of parliament, and by them tried as seditious disturbers\r\nof the peace and tranquillity of the commonwealth and of the king's\r\nsubjects, secret conspirators against the prosperity of his estate, and\r\nrebels against his authority and laws.[438] In order, however, to secure\r\nto the ecclesiastical tribunals their full control over clergymen, it\r\nwas provided that any churchman condemned to banishment, or any other\r\npunishment short of death, should immediately after the \"amende\r\nhonorable,\" and before execution of sentence, be remitted to his\r\nspiritual superiors to undergo deprivation of office, and such other\r\npenalties as canon law might prescribe.[439]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heresy to be punished as sedition.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repression proves a failure.]\r\n\r\nBut the succession of edicts, each surpassing the last in severity, had\r\nnot rendered the path of the judges, whether lay or ghostly, altogether\r\neasy. There were found prisoners, accused of holding and teaching\r\nheretical doctrines, well skilled in holy lore, however ignorant of the\r\ncasuistry of the schools, who made good their assertion that they could\r\ngive a warrant for all their distinctive tenets from the Sacred\r\nScriptures. Their arguments were so cogent, their citations were so\r\napposite, that the auditors who had come with the expectation of\r\nwitnessing the confusion of a heretic, often departed absorbed in\r\nserious consideration of a system that had so much the appearance of\r\ntruth when defended by a simple man in jeopardy of his life, and when\r\nfortified by the authority of the Bible. More learned reformers had\r\nappealed successfully to the Fathers to whose teachings the church\r\navowed its implicit obedience. It was clear that some standard of\r\northodoxy must be established. For, if St. Augustine or St. Cyprian\r\nmight be brought up to prove the errors of the priests, what was it but\r\nallowing the reformers to place the Roman Church at the bar, even in the\r\nvery courts of justice? Might not the most damaging losses be expected\r\nto flow from such trials?\r\n\r\nThe public courts, indeed, were not the only places where the\r\ninconsistencies of the established church with its own ancient standards\r\nand representative theologians were brought out into bold relief. The\r\npulpits of the very capital resounded, it was alleged, with\r\ncontradictory teachings, scandalizing the faithful not a little at the\r\nholy season of Advent.[440]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sorbonne's Twenty-five Articles.]\r\n\r\nTo put an end to so anomalous a state of affairs, the Parisian\r\ntheologians, with the consent of the king, resolved to enunciate the\r\ntrue Catholic faith, in the form of twenty-five articles meeting all\r\nquestions now in dispute (on the tenth of March, 1543). Of the general\r\ncontents of this new formulary, it is sufficient to observe that it more\r\nconcisely expressed the doctrines developed in the decisions of the\r\nCouncil of Trent; that it insisted upon baptism as essential to the\r\nsalvation even of infants; that it magnified the freedom of the human\r\nwill, and maintained the justification of the sinner by works as well as\r\nby faith; and that, dwelling upon the bodily presence of Christ in the\r\nconsecrated wafer, it affirmed the propriety of denying the cup to the\r\nlaity, the utility of masses for the dead, the lawfulness of the\r\ninvocation of the blessed Virgin and the saints, the existence of\r\npurgatory, the infallibility of the church, the authority of tradition,\r\nand the divine right of the Pope.[441]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis gives them the force of law.]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of July, 1543, the very day of the publication of\r\nthe edict of persecution previously mentioned, Francis by letters-patent\r\ngave the force of law to the exposition of the faith drawn up by the\r\ntheological faculty of \"his blessed and eldest daughter, the University\r\nof Paris.\" Henceforth no other doctrines could be professed in France.\r\nDissent was to be treated as \"rebellion\" against the royal\r\nauthority.[442]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution more systematic.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inquisitor Matthieu Ory.]\r\n\r\nThe sanguinary legislation at which we have glanced bore its most\r\natrocious fruits in the last years of Francis, and in the reign of his\r\nimmediate successor. The consideration of this topic must, however, be\r\nreserved for succeeding chapters. Until now the persecution had been\r\ncarried on with little system, and its intensity had varied according to\r\nthe natural temperament and disposition of the Roman Catholic prelates,\r\nnot less than the zeal of the civil judges. Many clergymen, as well as\r\nlay magistrates, had exhibited a singular supineness in the detection\r\nand punishment of the reformed. Some bishops, supposed to be at heart\r\nfriendly to the restoration of the church to its pristine purity of\r\ndoctrine and practice, had scarcely instituted a serious search. The\r\nroyal edicts themselves bear witness to their reluctance, in spite of\r\nthreatened suspension and deprivation. It is true that an attempt had\r\nbeen made to secure greater thoroughness and uniformity, by augmenting\r\nthe number of inquisitors of the faith, and this, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that their authority infringed upon that of the bishops, whose\r\nright was scarcely questioned to exclusive cognizance of heresy within\r\ntheir respective dioceses. Not only had Matthieu Ory[443] and others\r\nbeen appointed with jurisdiction over the entire kingdom, but a special\r\ninquisitor was created for the province of Normandy. Even these persons,\r\nhowever, were not always equally zealous in the performance of their\r\nallotted task. It was notorious that the good cheer with which Ory was\r\nregaled by the astute Protestants of Sancerre led him to report them to\r\nbe excellent people. A deputy, who next visited the reputed heretics,\r\nbrought back an equally flattering statement. And so the persecuting\r\n\"lieutenant particulier\" of Bourges seems to have had some ground for\r\nhis complaint, \"that good wine and a right new coat caused all these\r\ninquisitors to return well satisfied, without bringing him any\r\nprey.\"[444]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nicodemites and Libertins.]\r\n\r\nIt could not be otherwise, however, than that these severe measures and\r\nthe employment of new agents in the pitiless work of persecution should\r\ninduce many feeble souls to suppress their true sentiments, and to make\r\nthe attempt, under an external conformity with the Roman Church, to\r\nmaintain opinions and a private devotion quite inconsistent with their\r\nprofessions. And, while the progress of the Reformation was seriously\r\nimpeded by the timidity of this class of irresolute\r\npersons--appropriately styled by their contemporaries \"the\r\n_Nicodemites_\"--scarcely less danger threatened the same doctrines from\r\nthe insidious assaults of the _Libertines_, a party which, ostensibly\r\naiming at reform and religious liberty, really asked only for freedom in\r\nthe indulgence of vicious propensities. Against both of these pernicious\r\ntendencies the eloquent reformer of Geneva employed his pen in forcible\r\ntreatises, which were not without effect in checking their\r\ninroads.[445]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret of Navarre at Bordeaux.]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the Queen of Navarre herself gave no little\r\naid and comfort to the advocates of timid and irresolute counsels, by a\r\ncourse singularly wanting in ingenuousness. This amiable princess knew\r\nhow to express herself with such ambiguity as to perplex both religious\r\nparties and heartily satisfy neither the one side nor the other. She was\r\nthe avowed friend and correspondent of Melanchthon and Calvin. She was\r\nbelieved to be in substantial agreement with the Protestants. Her views\r\nof the fundamental doctrine of justification by faith and the paramount\r\nauthority of the Holy Scriptures were those for which many a Protestant\r\nmartyr had laid down his life. Even on the question of the Lord's\r\nSupper, her opinions, if mystical and somewhat vague, were certainly far\r\nremoved from the dogmas of the Roman Church. She condemned, it is true,\r\nthe extreme to which the \"Sacramentarians\" went, but it was difficult to\r\nsee precisely wherein the modified mass she countenanced differed from\r\nthe reformed service. Certainly not a line in her correspondence with\r\nCalvin points to any important difference of sentiment known by either\r\nparty to exist between them. What shall we say, then, on reading of such\r\nlanguage as she used in 1543, when addressing the Parliament of\r\nBordeaux? She had been deputed by her brother to represent him, and was,\r\nconsequently, received by the court, (on the twenty-fourth of May) with\r\nhonors scarcely, if at all, inferior to those that would have been\r\naccorded to Francis had he presented himself in person. Her special\r\ncommission was to notify parliament of an expected attack by the\r\nEnglish, and to request that due preparation should be made to ward it\r\noff. From this topic she passed to that of heresy, in respect to which\r\nshe expressed herself to this effect: \"She exhorted and prayed the court\r\n_to punish and burn the true heretics_, but to spare the innocent, and\r\nhave compassion upon the prisoners and captives.\"[446] If, as the\r\ninteresting minute of the queen's visit informs us, she next proceeded\r\nto claim the immemorial right, as a daughter of France, to open the\r\nprisons and liberate the inmates according to her good pleasure,[447] it\r\ncan scarcely be imagined that the assertion of the right at this time\r\nhad any other object in view than the release of those imprisoned for\r\nconscience' sake. It is true that she took pains to protest that she\r\nwould avoid meddling with prisoners incarcerated for other crimes than\r\nsuch as her brother was accustomed to pardon; but as the interference of\r\nFrancis in behalf of Berquin, Marot, and others accused of heresy, was\r\nsufficiently notorious, her guarantee could scarcely be considered very\r\nbroad. Certainly she was not likely to find a \"true heretic\" worthy of\r\nthe stake among all those imprisoned as \"Lutherans\" in the city of\r\nBordeaux.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negotiations in Germany.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hypocritical representations made by Charles of Orleans.]\r\n\r\nWhile Francis, as we have seen, was from year to year aggravating the\r\nseverity of his enactments against the adherents of the Reformation in\r\nhis own kingdom, he did not forget his old rôle of ally of the\r\nProtestant princes of the empire. It would be too wide a digression from\r\nthe true scope of this work, should we turn aside to chronicle the\r\nsuccessive attempts of the French monarch to secure these powerful\r\nauxiliaries in his struggle with his great rival of the house of\r\nHapsburg. One incident must suffice. The hypocrisy of Francis could,\r\nperhaps, go no farther than it carried him when, in 1543, his son\r\nCharles, Duke of Orleans, at the head of a royal army took possession of\r\nthe Duchy of Luxemburg. The duke, who can hardly be imagined to have\r\nallowed himself to take any important step, certainly no step fraught\r\nwith such momentous consequences as might be expected to follow this,\r\nwithout explicit instructions from his father, at once despatched an\r\nenvoy to the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse. The\r\nsubordinate agent in this game of duplicity was instructed to assure the\r\ngreat Protestant leaders that it was the earnest desire of the Duke of\r\nOrleans to see the Gospel preached throughout the whole of France. It\r\nwas true that filial reverence had hitherto restrained him from\r\ngratifying his desires in this direction in his Duchy of Orleans; but in\r\nthe government of Luxemburg and of all other territories acquired by\r\nright of arms, he hoped to be permitted by his royal father to follow\r\nhis own preferences, and there he solemnly promised to introduce the\r\nproclamation of God's holy word. In return for these liberal\r\nengagements, the duke desired the German princes, then on the point of\r\nmeeting for conference at Frankfort, to admit him to an alliance\r\noffensive and defensive, especially in matters concerning religion. He\r\nassured them of the support not only of his own forces, but of his\r\nfather's troops, committed to him to use at his discretion, adding, as a\r\nfurther motive, the prospect that the Gospel would find more ready\r\nwelcome in the rest of France, when the king saw its German advocates\r\nclose allies of his youngest son.[448]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commendable scepticism of the Germans.]\r\n\r\nBut the princes were much too familiar with the wiles of Francis to\r\nrepose any confidence in the lavish professions of his son. And the\r\nhistorian who discovers that the more intimately the king strove to\r\nassociate himself with the German Protestants, the more fiercely did he\r\ncommit the Protestants of France to the flames, in order to demonstrate\r\nto the Pope the immaculate orthodoxy of his religious belief, will not\r\nfail to applaud their discernment. Not until toward the very close of\r\nFrancis's reign, when the Lutherans descried portents of a storm that\r\nthreatened them with utter extermination, raised by the bigotry or craft\r\nof Charles the Fifth, did they manifest any anxiety to enter into near\r\nconnection with the French monarch.\r\n\r\nFrancis was reaping the natural rewards of a crooked policy, dictated by\r\nno strong convictions of truth or duty, but shaped according to the\r\nnarrow suggestions of an unworthy ambition. If he punished heretics at\r\nhome, it was partly to secure on his side the common sentiment of the\r\nRoman Catholic world, partly because the enemies of the Reformation had\r\npersuaded him that the change of religion necessarily involved the\r\nsubversion of established order and of royal authority. If he made\r\novertures to the Protestant princes of Germany, the flimsy veil of\r\ndevotion to their interests was too transparent to conceal the total\r\nwant of concern for anything beyond his own personal aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nTwo mournful exemplifications of the fruits of his persecuting measures\r\nmust, however, be presented to the reader's notice, before the curtain\r\ncan be permitted to fall over the scene on which this monarch played his\r\npart. The massacre of Mérindol and Cabrières and the execution of the\r\n\"Fourteen of Meaux\" are the melancholy events that mark the close of a\r\nreign opening, a generation earlier, so auspiciously.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: The Protestants might be pardoned, under the\r\ncircumstances, if their language was somewhat bitter respecting both\r\nemperor and king. \"Combien que j'espère que nostre _Antioche_ (Charles\r\nV.), qui nous presse maintenant, sera serré de si près, _qu'il ne luy\r\nsouviendra des gouttes_ de ses mains, ne de ses pieds; _car il en aura\r\npar tout le corps_.

The entire district had been\r\ndesolated by war about a couple of centuries before the time of which we\r\nare now treating. Extensive tracts of land were nearly depopulated, and\r\nthe few remaining tillers of the soil obtained a precarious subsistence,\r\nat the mercy of banditti that infested the mountains and forests, and\r\nplundered unfortunate travellers. Under these circumstances, the landed\r\ngentry, impoverished through the loss of the greater part of their\r\nrevenues, gladly welcomed the advent of new-comers, who were induced to\r\ncross the Alps from the valleys of Piedmont and occupy the abandoned\r\nfarms.[449] By the industrious culture of the Vaudois, or Waldenses, the\r\nface of the country was soon transformed. Villages sprang up where there\r\nhad scarcely been a single house. Brigandage disappeared. Grain, wine,\r\nolives, and almonds were obtained in abundance from what had been a\r\nbarren waste. On lands less favorable for cultivation numerous flocks\r\nand herds pastured.[450] A tract formerly returning the scanty income of\r\nfour crowns a year now contained a thriving village of eighty\r\nsubstantial houses, and brought its owners nearly a hundredfold the\r\nformer rental.[451] On one occasion at least, discouraged by the\r\nannoyance to which their religious opinions subjected them, a part of\r\nthe Vaudois sought refuge in their ancient homes, on the Italian side of\r\nthe mountains. But their services were too valuable to be dispensed\r\nwith, and they soon returned to Provence, in answer to the urgent\r\nsummons of their Roman Catholic landlords.[452] In fact, a very striking\r\nproof both of their industry and of their success is furnished by the\r\ncircumstance that Cabrières, one of the largest Vaudois villages, was\r\nsituated within the bounds of the _Comtât Venaissin_, governed, about\r\nthe time of their arrival, by the Pope in person, and subsequently, as\r\nwe have seen, by a papal legate residing in Avignon.[453]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They send delegates to the Swiss and German reformers.]\r\n\r\nThe news of an attempted reformation of the church in Switzerland and\r\nGermany awakened a lively interest in this community of simple-minded\r\nChristians. At length a convocation of their ministers[454] at Mérindol,\r\nin 1530, determined to send two of their number to compare the tenets\r\nthey had long held with those of the reformers, and to obtain, if\r\npossible, additional light upon some points of doctrine and of practice\r\nrespecting which they entertained doubt. The delegates were George\r\nMorel, of Freissinières, and Pierre Masson, of Burgundy. They visited\r\nOecolampadius at Basle, Bucer and Capito at Strasbourg, Farel at\r\nNeufchâtel, and Haller at Berne. From the first-named they received the\r\nmost important aid, in the way of suggestions respecting the errors[455]\r\ninto which the isolated position they had long occupied had insensibly\r\nled them. Grateful for the kindness manifested to them, and delighted\r\nwith what they had witnessed of the progress of the faith they had\r\nreceived from their fathers, the two envoys started on their return. But\r\nMorel alone succeeded in reaching Provence; his companion was arrested\r\nat Dijon and condemned to death. Upon the report of Morel, however, the\r\nWaldenses at once began to investigate the new questions that had been\r\nraised, and, in their eagerness to purify their church, sent word to\r\ntheir brethren in Apulia and Calabria, inviting them to a conference\r\nrespecting the interests of religion.[456]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They furnish means for publishing the Scriptures.]\r\n\r\nA few years later (1535) the Waldenses by their liberal contributions\r\nfurnished the means necessary for publishing the translation of the Holy\r\nScriptures made by Pierre Robert Olivetanus, and corrected by Calvin,\r\nwhich, unless exception be made in favor of the translation by Lefèvre\r\nd'Étaples, is entitled to rank as the earliest French Protestant\r\nBible.[457] It was a noble undertaking, by which the poor and humble\r\ninhabitants of Provence, Piedmont, and Calabria conferred on France a\r\nsignal benefit, scarcely appreciated in its full extent even by those\r\nwho pride themselves upon their acquaintance with the rich literature of\r\nthat country. For, while Olivetanus in his admirable version laid the\r\nfoundation upon which all the later and more accurate translations have\r\nbeen reared, by the excellence of his modes of expression he exerted an\r\ninfluence upon the French language perhaps not inferior to that of\r\nCalvin or Montaigne.[458]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preliminary persecutions.]\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the new activity manifested by the Waldenses reaching\r\nthe ears of their enemies, among whom the Archbishop of Aix was\r\nprominent, stirred them up to more virulent hostility. The accusation\r\nwas subsequently made by unfriendly writers, in order to furnish some\r\nslight justification for the atrocities of the massacre, that the\r\nWaldenses, emboldened by the encouragement of the reformers, began to\r\nshow a disposition to offer forcible resistance to the arbitrary arrests\r\nordered by the civil and religious authorities of Aix. But the\r\nassertion, which is unsupported by evidence, contradicts the well-known\r\ndisposition and practice of a patient people, more prone to submit to\r\noppression than to take up arms even in defence of a righteous\r\ncause.[459]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dominican De Roma foremost in the work.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iniquitous order of the Parliament of Aix.]\r\n\r\nFor a time the persecution was individual, and therefore limited. But in\r\nthe aggregate the number of victims was by no means inconsiderable, and\r\nthe flames burned many a steadfast Waldensee.[460] The Dominican De Roma\r\nenjoyed an unenviable notoriety for his ferocity in dealing with the\r\n\"heretics,\" whose feet he was in the habit of plunging in boots full of\r\nmelted fat and boiling over a slow fire. The device did, indeed, seem to\r\nthe king, when he heard of it, less ingenious than cruel, and De Roma\r\nfound it necessary to avoid arrest by a hasty flight to Avignon, where,\r\nupon papal soil, as foul a sink of iniquity existed as anywhere within\r\nthe bounds of Christendom.[461] But other agents, scarcely more merciful\r\nthan De Roma, prosecuted the work. Some of the Waldenses were put to\r\ndeath, others were branded upon the forehead. Even the ordinary rights\r\nof the accused were denied them; for, in order to leave no room for\r\njustice, the Parliament of Aix had framed an iniquitous order,\r\nprohibiting all clerks and notaries from either furnishing the accused\r\ncopies of legal instruments, or receiving at their hands any petition or\r\npaper whatsoever.[462] Such were the measures by which the newly-created\r\nParliament of Provence signalized its zeal for the faith, and attested\r\nits worthiness to be a sovereign court of the kingdom.[463] From its\r\nsevere sentences, however, appeals had once and again been taken by the\r\nWaldenses to Francis, who had granted them his royal pardon on condition\r\nof their abjuration of their errors within six months.[464]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inhabitants of Mérindol cited.]\r\n\r\nThe slow methods heretofore pursued having proved abortive, in 1540 the\r\nparliament summoned to its bar, as suspected of heresy, fifteen or\r\ntwenty[465] of the inhabitants of the village of Mérindol. On the\r\nappointed day the accused made their way to Aix, but, on stopping to\r\nobtain legal advice of a lawyer more candid than others to whom they had\r\nfirst applied, and who had declined to give counsel to reputed\r\nLutherans, they were warned by no means to appear, as their death was\r\nalready resolved upon. They acted on the friendly injunction, and fled\r\nwhile it was still time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The atrocious Arrêt de Mérindol, Nov. 18, 1540.]\r\n\r\nFinding itself balked for the time of its expected prey, the parliament\r\nresolved to avenge the slight put upon its authority, by compassing the\r\nruin of a larger number of victims. On the eighteenth of November, 1540,\r\nthe order was given which has since become infamous under the\r\ndesignation of the \"_Arrêt de Mérindol_.\" The persons who had failed to\r\nobey the summons were sentenced to be burned alive, as heretics and\r\nguilty of treason against God and the King. If not apprehended in\r\nperson, they were to be burned in effigy, their wives and children\r\nproscribed, and their possessions confiscated. As if this were not\r\nenough to satisfy the most inordinate greed of vengeance, parliament\r\nordered _that all the houses of Mérindol be burned and razed to the\r\nground, and the trees cut down for a distance of two hundred paces on\r\nevery side, in order that the spot which had been the receptacle of\r\nheresy might be forever uninhabited_! Finally, with an affectation which\r\nwould seem puerile were it not the conclusion of so sanguinary a\r\ndocument, the owners of lands were forbidden to lease any part of\r\nMérindol to a tenant bearing the same name, or belonging to the same\r\nfamily, as the miscreants against whom the decree was fulminated.[466]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is condemned by public opinion.]\r\n\r\nA more atrocious sentence was, perhaps, never rendered by a court of\r\njustice than the _Arrêt de Mérindol_, which condemned the accused\r\nwithout a hearing, confounded the innocent with the guilty, and\r\nconsigned the entire population of a peaceful village, by a single\r\nstroke of the pen, to a cruel death, or a scarcely less terrible exile.\r\nFor ten righteous persons God would have spared guilty Sodom; but\r\nneither the virtues of the inoffensive inhabitants, nor the presence of\r\nmany Roman Catholics among them, could insure the safety of the\r\nill-fated Mérindol at the hands of merciless judges.[467] The\r\npublication of the _Arrêt_ occasioned, even within the bounds of the\r\nprovince, the most severe animadversion; nor were there wanting men of\r\nlearning and high social position, who, while commenting freely upon the\r\nscandalous morals of the clergy, expressed their conviction that the\r\npublic welfare would be promoted rather by restraining and reforming the\r\nprofligacy of the ecclesiastics, than by issuing bloody edicts against\r\nthe most exemplary part of the community.[468]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparations to carry it into effect.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, the archbishops of Arles and of Aix urged the prompt\r\nexecution of the sentence, and the convocations of clergy offered to\r\ndefray the expense of the levy of troops needed to carry it into effect.\r\nThe Archbishop of Aix used his personal influence with Chassanée, the\r\nFirst President of the Parliament, who, with the more moderate judges,\r\nhad only consented to the enactment as a threat which he never intended\r\nto execute.[469] And the wily prelate so far succeeded by his\r\narguments, and by the assurance he gave of the protection of the\r\nCardinal of Tournon, in case the matter should reach the king's ears,\r\nthat the definite order was actually promulgated for the destruction of\r\nMérindol. Troops were accordingly raised, and, in fact, the vanguard of\r\na formidable army had reached a spot within three miles of the devoted\r\nvillage, when the command was suddenly received to retreat, the soldiers\r\nwere disbanded, and the astonished Waldenses beheld the dreaded outburst\r\nof the storm strangely delayed.[470]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is delayed by friendly interposition.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"mice of Autun.\"]\r\n\r\nThe unexpected deliverance is said to have been due to the remonstrance\r\nof a friend, M. d'Allens. D'Allens had adroitly reminded the president\r\nof an amusing incident by means of which Chassanée had himself\r\nillustrated the ample protection against oppression afforded by the law,\r\nin the hands of a sagacious advocate and a righteous judge; and he had\r\nearnestly entreated his friend not to show himself less equitable in the\r\nmatter of the defenceless inhabitants of Mérindol than he had been in\r\nthat of the \"mice of Autun.\"[471]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis I. instructs Du Bellay to investigate.]\r\n\r\nThe delay thus gained permitted a reference of the affair to the king.\r\nIt is said that Guillaume du Bellay is entitled to the honor of having\r\ninformed Francis of the oppression of his poor subjects of Provence, and\r\ninvoked the royal interposition.[472] However this may be, it is certain\r\nthat Francis instructed Du Bellay to set on foot a thorough\r\ninvestigation into the history and character of the inhabitants of\r\nMérindol, and report the results to himself. The selection could not\r\nhave been more felicitous. Du Bellay was Viceroy of Piedmont, a province\r\nthrown into the hands of Francis by the fortunes of war. A man of calm\r\nand impartial spirit, his liberal principles had been fostered by\r\nintimate association with the Protestants of Germany. Only a few months\r\nearlier, in 1539, he had, in his capacity of governor, made energetic\r\nremonstrances to the Constable de Montmorency touching the wrongs\r\nsustained by the Waldenses of the valleys of Piedmont at the hands of a\r\nCount de Montmian, the constable's kinsman. He had even resorted to\r\nthreats, and declared \"that it appeared to him wicked and villanous, if,\r\nas was reported, the count had invaded these valleys and plundered a\r\npeaceful and unoffending race of men.\" Montmian had retorted by accusing\r\nDu Bellay of falsehood, and maintaining that the Waldenses had suffered\r\nno more than they deserved, on account of their rebellion against God\r\nand the king. The unexpected death of Montmian prevented the two\r\nnoblemen from meeting in single combat, but a bitter enmity between the\r\nconstable and Du Bellay had been the result.[473]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Bellay's favorable report.]\r\n\r\nThe viceroy, in obedience to his instructions, despatched two agents\r\nfrom Turin to inquire upon the ground into the character and antecedents\r\nof the people of Mérindol. Their report, which has fortunately come down\r\nto us, constitutes a brilliant testimonial from unbiassed witnesses to\r\nthe virtues of this simple peasantry. They set forth in simple terms the\r\naffecting story of the cruelty and merciless exactions to which the\r\nvillagers had for long years been subjected. They collected the\r\nconcurrent opinions of all the Roman Catholics of the vicinity\r\nrespecting their industry. In two hundred years they had transformed an\r\nuncultivated and barren waste into a fertile and productive tract, to\r\nthe no small profit of the noblemen whose tenants they were. They were a\r\npeople distinguished for their love of peace and quiet, with firmly\r\nestablished customs and principles, and warmly commended for their\r\nstrict adherence to truth in their words and engagements. Averse alike\r\nto debt and to litigation, they were bound to their neighbors by a tie\r\nof singular good-will and respect. Their kindness to the unfortunate and\r\ntheir humanity to travellers knew no bounds. One could readily\r\ndistinguish them from others by their abstinence from unnecessary oaths,\r\nand their avoidance even of the very name of the devil. They never\r\nindulged in lascivious discourse themselves, and if others introduced it\r\nin their presence, they instantly withdrew from the company. It was true\r\nthat they rarely entered the churches, when pleasure or business took\r\nthem to the city or the fair; and, if found within the sacred enclosure,\r\nthey were seen praying with faces averted from the paintings of the\r\nsaints. They offered no candles, avoided the sacred relics, and paid no\r\nreverence to the crosses on the roadside. The priests testified that\r\nthey were never known to purchase masses either for the living or for\r\nthe dead, nor to sprinkle themselves with holy water. They neither went\r\non pilgrimages, nor invoked the intercession of the host of heaven, nor\r\nexpended the smallest sum in securing indulgences. In a thunderstorm\r\nthey knelt down and prayed, instead of crossing themselves. Finally,\r\nthey contributed nothing to the support of religious fraternities or to\r\nthe rebuilding of churches, reserving their means for the relief of tho\r\npoor and afflicted.[474]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE VAUDOIS VILLAGES IN PROVENCE.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 240._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis signs a letter of pardon.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the enemies of the Waldenses were not silenced, and wild\r\nstories of their rebellious acts still found willing listeners at\r\ncourt,[475] it was impossible to resist the favorable impression made by\r\nthe viceroy's letter. Consequently, on the eighth of February, 1541,\r\nFrancis signed a letter granting pardon not only to the persons who by\r\ntheir failure to appear before the Parliament of Aix had furnished the\r\npretext for the proscriptive decree, but to all others, meantime\r\ncommanding them to abjure their errors within the space of three months.\r\nAt the same time the over-zealous judges were directed henceforth to use\r\nless severity against these subjects of his Majesty.[476]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament issues a new summons.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Vaudois publish a confession.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bishop Sadolet's kindness.]\r\n\r\nLittle inclined to relinquish the pursuit, however, parliament seized\r\nupon the king's command to abjure within three months, as an excuse for\r\nissuing a new summons to the Waldenses. Two deputies from Mérindol\r\naccordingly presented themselves, and offered, on the part of the\r\ninhabitants, to abandon their peculiar tenets, so soon as these should\r\nbe refuted from the Holy Scriptures--the course which, as they believed,\r\nthe king himself had intended that they should take. As it was no part\r\nof the plan to grant so reasonable a request, the sole reply vouchsafed\r\nwas a declaration that all who recanted would receive the benefit of\r\nthe king's pardon, but all others would be reputed guilty of heresy\r\nwithout further inquiry. Whereupon the Waldenses of Mérindol, in 1542,\r\ndrew up a full confession of their faith, in order that the excellence\r\nof the doctrines they held might be known to all men.[477] The important\r\ndocument was submitted not merely to parliament, but to Cardinal\r\nSadolet, Bishop of Carpentras. The prelate was a man of a kindly\r\ndisposition, and did not hesitate, in reply to a petition of the\r\nWaldenses of Cabrières, to acknowledge the falsity of the accusations\r\nlaid to their charge.[478] Not long after, he successfully exerted his\r\ninfluence with the vice-legate to induce him to abandon an expedition he\r\nhad organized against the last-mentioned village; while, in an interview\r\nwhich he purposely sought with the inhabitants, he assured them that he\r\nfirmly intended, in a coming visit to Rome, to secure the reformation of\r\nsome incontestable abuses.[479]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intercession of the Germans.]\r\n\r\nThe Mérindol confession is said to have found its way even to Paris, and\r\nto have been read to the king by Châtellain, Bishop of Maçon, and a\r\nfavorite of the monarch. And it is added that, astonished at the purity\r\nof its doctrine, Francis asked, but in vain, that any erroneous teaching\r\nin it should be pointed out to him.[480] It is not, indeed, impossible\r\nthat the king's interest in his Waldensian subjects may have been\r\ndeepened by the receipt of a respectful remonstrance against the\r\npersecutions now raging in France, drawn up by Melanchthon in the name\r\nof the Protestant princes and states of Germany.[481]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of President Chassanée, who is succeeded by Baron\r\nd'Oppède.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military preparations stopped by a second royal order.]\r\n\r\nThe _Arrêt de Mérindol_ yet remained unexecuted when, Chassanée having\r\ndied, he was succeeded, in the office of First President of the\r\nParliament of Provence, by Jean Meynier, Baron d'Oppède. The latter was\r\nan impetuous and unscrupulous man. Even before his elevation to his new\r\njudicial position, Meynier had looked with envious eye upon the\r\nprosperity of Cabrières, situated but a few miles from his barony; and\r\nscarcely had he taken his place on the bench, before, at his bidding,\r\nthe first notes of preparation for a great military assault upon the\r\nvillages of the Durance were heard. The affrighted peasants again had\r\nrecourse to the mercy of their distant sovereign. A second time Francis\r\n(on the twenty-fifth of October, 1544) interfered, evoking the case from\r\nparliament, and assuming cognizance of it until such time as he might\r\nhave instituted an examination upon the spot by a \"Maître de requêtes\"\r\nand a theologian sent by him.[482]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calumnious accusations.]\r\n\r\nThe interruption was little relished. A fresh investigation was likely\r\nto disclose nothing more unfavorable to the Waldenses than had been\r\nelicited by the inquiries of Du Bellay, or than the report which had led\r\nLouis the Twelfth, on an earlier occasion (1501), to exclaim with an\r\noath: \"They are better Christians than we are!\"[483] and, what was\r\nworse, the poor relations, both of the prelates and of the judges, had\r\nonly a sorry prospect of enriching themselves through the confiscation\r\nof the property of the lawful owners.[484] It was time to venture\r\nsomething for the purpose of obtaining the coveted prize. Accordingly,\r\nthe Parliament of Aix, at this juncture, despatched to Paris one of its\r\nofficial servants, with a special message to the king. He was to beg\r\nFrancis to recall his previous order. He was to tell him that Mérindol\r\nand the neighboring villages had broken out into open rebellion; that\r\nfifteen thousand armed insurgents had met in a single body. They had\r\ncaptured towns and castles, liberated prisoners, and hindered the course\r\nof justice. They were intending to march against Marseilles, and when\r\nsuccessful would establish a republic fashioned on the model of the\r\nSwiss cantons.[485]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis, misinformed, revokes his last orders.]\r\n\r\nThus reinforced, Cardinal Tournon found no great difficulty in exciting\r\nthe animosity of a king both jealous of any infringement upon his\r\nprerogative, and credulous respecting movements tending to the\r\nencouragement of rebellion. On the first of January, 1545, Francis sent\r\na new letter to the Parliament of Aix. He revoked his last order,\r\nenjoined the execution of the former decrees of parliament, so far as\r\nthey concerned those who had failed to abjure, and commanded the\r\ngovernor of Provence, or his lieutenant, to employ all his forces to\r\nexterminate any found guilty of the Waldensian heresy.[486]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His letter construed as authorizing a new crusade.]\r\n\r\nThe new order had been skilfully drawn. The \"Arrêt de Mérindol,\"\r\nalthough not alluded to by name, might naturally be understood as\r\nincluded under the general designation of the parliament's decrees\r\nagainst heretics; while the direction to employ the governor's troops\r\nagainst those who had not abjured could be construed as authorizing a\r\nlocal crusade, in which innocent and guilty were equally likely to\r\nsuffer. Such were the pretexts behind which the first president and his\r\nfriends prepared for a carnage which, for causelessness and atrocity,\r\nfinds few parallels on the page of history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An expedition stealthily organized.]\r\n\r\nThree months passed, and yet no attempt was made to disturb the peaceful\r\nvillages on the Durance. Then the looked-for opportunity came. Count De\r\nGrignan, Governor of Provence, was summoned by the king and sent on a\r\ndiplomatic mission to Germany. The civil and military administration\r\nfell into the Baron d'Oppède's hands as lieutenant. The favorable\r\nconjuncture was instantly improved. On a single day--the twelfth of\r\nApril--the royal letter, hitherto kept secret, that the intended victims\r\nmight receive no intimations of the impending blow, was read and\r\njudicially confirmed, and four commissioners were appointed to\r\nsuperintend the execution.[487] Troops were hastily levied. All men\r\ncapable of bearing arms in the cities of Aix, Arles, and Marseilles were\r\ncommanded, under severe penalties, to join the expedition;[488] and some\r\ncompanies of veteran troops, which happened to be on their way from\r\nPiedmont to the scene of the English war, were impressed into the\r\nservice by D'Oppède, in the king's name.[489]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villages burned and their inhabitants butchered.]\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of April, the commissioners, leaving Aix, proceeded to\r\nPertuis, on the northern bank of the Durance. Thence, following the\r\ncourse of the river, they reached Cadenet. Here they were joined by the\r\nBaron d'Oppède, his sons-in-law, De Pouriez and De Lauris, and a\r\nconsiderable force of men. A deliberation having been held, on the\r\nsixteenth, Poulain, to whom the chief command had been assigned by\r\nD'Oppède, directed his course northward, and burned Cabrièrette, Peypin,\r\nLa Motte and Saint-Martin, villages built on the lands of De Cental, a\r\nRoman Catholic nobleman, at this time a minor. The wretched inhabitants,\r\nwho had not until the very last moment credited the strange story of the\r\ndisaster in reserve for them, hurriedly fled on the approach of the\r\nsoldiery, some to the woods, others to Mérindol. Unable to defend them\r\nagainst a force so greatly superior in number and equipment, a part of\r\nthe men are said to have left their wives, old men, and children in\r\ntheir forest retreat, confident that if discovered, feminine weakness\r\nand the helplessness of infancy or of extreme old age would secure\r\nbetter terms for them than could be hoped for in case of a brave, but\r\nineffectual defence by unarmed men.[490] It was a confidence misplaced.\r\nUnresisting, gray-headed men were despatched with the sword, while the\r\nwomen were reserved for the grossest outrage, or suffered the mutilation\r\nof their breasts, or, if with child, were butchered with their unborn\r\noffspring. Of all the property spared them by previous oppressors,\r\nnothing was left to sustain the miserable survivors. For weeks they\r\nwandered homeless and penniless in the vicinity of their once\r\nflourishing settlements; and there one might not unfrequently see the\r\ninfant lying on the road-side, by the corpse of the mother dead of\r\nhunger and exposure. For even the ordinary charity of the humane had\r\nbeen checked by an order of D'Oppède, savagely forbidding that shelter\r\nor food be afforded to heretics, on pain of the halter.[491]\r\n\r\nLourmarin, Villelaure, and Treizemines were next burned on the way to\r\nMérindol. On the opposite side of the Durance, La Rocque and St. Étienne\r\nde Janson suffered the same fate, at the hands of volunteers coming from\r\nArles. Happily they were found deserted, the villagers having had timely\r\nnotice of the approaching storm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The destruction of Mérindol.]\r\n\r\nEarly on the eighteenth of April, D'Oppède reached Mérindol, the\r\nostensible object of the expedition. But a single person was found\r\nwithin its circuit, and he a young man reputed possessed of less than\r\nordinary intellect. His captor had promised him freedom, on his pledging\r\nhimself to pay two crowns for his ransom. But D'Oppède, finding no other\r\nhuman being upon whom to vent his rage, paid the soldier the two crowns\r\nfrom his own pocket, and ordered the youth to be tied to an olive-tree\r\nand shot. The touching words uttered by the simple victim, as he turned\r\nhis eyes heavenward and breathed out his life, have been preserved:\r\n\"Lord God, these men are snatching from me a life full of wretchedness\r\nand misery, but Thou wilt give me eternal life through Jesus Thy\r\nSon.\"[492]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The village razed.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the work of persecution was thoroughly done. The houses were\r\nplundered and burned; the trees, whether intended for shade or for\r\nfruit, were cut down to the distance of two hundred paces from the\r\nplace. The very site of Mérindol was levelled, and crowds of laborers\r\nindustriously strove to destroy every trace of human habitation. Two\r\nhundred dwellings, the former abode of thrift and contentment, had\r\ndisappeared from the earth, and their occupants wandered,\r\npoverty-stricken, to other regions.[493]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treacherous capture of Cabrières.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the desolate spot, D'Oppède next presented himself, on the\r\nnineteenth of April, before the town of Cabrières. Behind some weak\r\nentrenchments a small body of brave men had posted themselves,\r\ndetermined to defend the lives and honor of their wives and children to\r\ntheir last drop of blood. D'Oppède hesitated to order an assault until a\r\nbreach had first been made by cannon. Then the Waldenses were plied with\r\nsolicitations to spare needless effusion of blood by voluntary\r\nsurrender. They were offered immunity of life and property, and a\r\njudicial trial. When by these promises the assailants had, on the\r\nmorrow, gained the interior of the works, they found them guarded by\r\nÉtienne de Marroul and an insignificant force of sixty men, supported by\r\na courageous band of about forty women. The remainder of the population,\r\novercome by natural terror at the strange sight of war, had taken\r\nrefuge--the men in the cellars of the castle, the women and children in\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Men butchered and women burned.]\r\n\r\nThe slender garrison left their entrenchments without arms, trusting in\r\nthe good faith of their enemies. It was a vain and delusive reliance.\r\nThey had to do with men who held, and carried into practice, the\r\ndoctrine that no faith is to be observed with heretics. Scarcely had the\r\nWaldenses placed themselves in their power, when twenty-five or more of\r\ntheir number were seized, and, being dragged to a meadow near by, were\r\nbutchered in cold blood, in the presence of the Baron d'Oppède. The rest\r\nwere taken to Aix and Marseilles. The women were treated with even\r\ngreater cruelty. Having been thrust into a barn, they were there burned\r\nalive. When a soldier, more compassionate than his comrades, opened to\r\nthem a way of escape, D'Oppède ordered them to be driven back at the\r\npoint of the pike. Nor were those taken within the town more fortunate.\r\nThe men, drawn from their subterranean retreats, were either killed on\r\nthe spot, or bound in couples and hurried to the castle hall, where two\r\ncaptains stood ready to kill them as they successively arrived. It was,\r\nhowever, for the sacred precincts of the church that the crowning orgies\r\nof these bloody revels were reserved. The fitting actors were a motley\r\nrabble from the neighboring city of Avignon, who converted the place\r\nconsecrated to the worship of the Almighty into a charnel-house, in\r\nwhich eight hundred bodies lay slain, without respect of age or\r\nsex.[494]\r\n\r\nIn the blood of a thousand human beings D'Oppède had washed out a\r\nfancied affront received at the hands of the inhabitants of Cabrières.\r\nThe private rancor of a relative induced him to visit a similar revenge\r\non La Coste, where a fresh field was opened for the perfidy, lust, and\r\ngreed of the soldiery. The peasants were promised by their feudal lord\r\nperfect security, on condition that they brought their arms into the\r\ncastle and broke down four portions of their wall. Too implicit reliance\r\nwas placed in a nobleman's word, and the terms were accepted. But when\r\nD'Oppède arrived, a murderous work began. The suburbs were burned, the\r\ntown was taken, the citizens for the most part were butchered, the\r\nmarried women and girls were alike surrendered to the brutality of the\r\nsoldiers.[495]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The results.]\r\n\r\nFor more than seven weeks the pillage continued.[496] Twenty-two towns\r\nand villages were utterly destroyed. The soldiers, glutted with blood\r\nand rapine, were withdrawn from the scene of their infamous excesses.\r\nMost of the Waldenses who had escaped sword, famine, and exposure,\r\ngradually returned to the familiar sites, and established themselves\r\nanew, maintaining their ancient faith.[497] But multitudes had perished\r\nof hunger,[498] while others, rejoicing that they had found abroad a\r\ntoleration denied them at home, renounced their native land, and settled\r\nupon the territory generously conceded to them in Switzerland.[499] In\r\none way or another, France had become poorer by the loss of several\r\nthousands persons of its most industrious class.[500]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king led to give his approval.]\r\n\r\nThe very agents in the massacre were appalled at the havoc they had\r\nmade. Fearing, with reason, the punishment of their crime, if viewed in\r\nits proper light,[501] they endeavored to veil it with the forms of a\r\njudicial proceeding. A commission was appointed to try the heretics whom\r\nthe sword had spared. A part were sentenced to the galleys, others to\r\nheavy fines. A few of the tenants of M. de Cental are said to have\r\npurchased reconciliation by abjuring their faith.[502] But, to conceal\r\nthe truth still more effectually, President De la Fond was sent to\r\nParis. He assured Francis that the sufferers had been guilty of the\r\nbasest crimes, that they had been judicially tried and found guilty, and\r\nthat their punishment was really below the desert of their\r\noffences.[503] Upon these representations, the king was induced--it was\r\nsupposed by the solicitation of Cardinal Tournon--to grant letters (at\r\nArques, on the eighteenth of August, 1545) approving the execution of\r\nthe Waldenses, but recommending to mercy all that repented and\r\nabjured.[504]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An investigation subsequently ordered.]\r\n\r\nThus did the authors of so much human suffering escape merited\r\nretribution at the hands of earthly justice during the brief remainder\r\nof the reign of Francis the First. If, as some historians have asserted,\r\nthat monarch's eyes were at last opened to the enormities committed in\r\nProvence, it was too late for him to do more than enjoin on his son and\r\nsuccessor a careful review of the entire proceedings.[505] After the\r\ndeath of Francis an opportunity for obtaining redress seemed to offer.\r\nCardinal Tournon and Count De Grignan were in disgrace, and their places\r\nin the royal favor were held by men who hated them heartily. The new\r\nfavorites used their influence to secure the Waldenses a hearing.\r\nD'Oppède and the four commissioners were summoned to Paris. Count De\r\nGrignan himself barely escaped being put on trial--as responsible for\r\nthe misdeeds of his lieutenant--by securing the advocacy of the Duke of\r\nGuise, which he purchased with the sacrifice of his domains at Grignan.\r\nFor fifty days the trial of the other criminals was warmly prosecuted\r\nbefore the Parliament of Paris; and so ably and lucidly did Auberi\r\npresent the claims of the oppressed before the crowded assembly, that a\r\nsevere verdict was confidently awaited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meagre effect.]\r\n\r\nThe public expectation, however, was doomed to disappointment. Only one\r\nof the accused, the advocate Guérin, being so unfortunate as to possess\r\nno great influence at court, was condemned to the gallows. D'Oppède\r\nescaped with De Grignan, through the protection of the Duke of Guise,\r\nand, like his fellow-defendants, was reinstated in office.[506] For the\r\nrendering of a decision so flagrantly unjust the true cause must be\r\nsought in the sanguinary character of the Parisian judges themselves,\r\nwho, while they were reluctant, on the one hand, to derogate from the\r\ncredit of another parliament of France, on the other, feared lest, in\r\ncondemning the persecuting rage of others, they might seem to be passing\r\nsentence upon themselves for the uniform course of cruelty they had\r\npursued in the trial of the reformers.[507]\r\n\r\nThe oppressed and persecuted of all ages have been ready, not without\r\nreason, to recognize in signal disasters befalling their enemies the\r\nretributive hand of the Almighty himself lifting for a moment the veil\r\nof futurity, to disclose a little of the misery that awaits the\r\nevil-doer in another world. But, in the present instance, it is a candid\r\nhistorian of different faith who does not hesitate to ascribe to a\r\nspecial interposition of the Deity the excruciating sufferings and death\r\nwhich, not long after his acquittal, overtook Baron d'Oppède, the chief\r\nactor in the mournful tragedy we have been recounting.[508]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New persecution at Meaux.]\r\n\r\nThe ashes of Mérindol and Cabrières were scarcely cold, before in a\r\ndistant part of France the flame of persecution broke out with fresh\r\nenergy.[509] The city of Meaux, where, under the evangelical preachers\r\nintroduced by Bishop Briçonnet, the Reformation had made such auspicious\r\nprogress, had never been thoroughly reduced to submission to papal\r\nauthority. \"The Lutherans of Meaux\" had passed into a proverb.\r\nPersecuted, they retained their devotion to their new faith; compelled\r\nto observe strict secrecy, they multiplied to such a degree that their\r\nnumbers could no longer be concealed. Twenty years after their\r\ndestruction had been resolved upon, the necessity of a regular church\r\norganization made itself felt by the growing congregations. Some of the\r\nmembers had visited the church of Strasbourg, to which John Calvin had,\r\na few years before, given an orderly system of government and\r\nworship--the model followed by many Protestant churches of subsequent\r\nformation. On their return a similar polity was established in Meaux. A\r\nsimple wool-carder, Pierre Leclerc, brother of one of the first martyrs\r\nof Protestant France, was called from the humble pursuits of the artisan\r\nto the responsible post of pastor. He was no scholar in the usual\r\nacceptation of the term; he knew only his mother-tongue. But his\r\njudgment was sound, his piety fervent, his familiarity with the Holy\r\nScriptures singularly great. So fruitful were his labors, that the\r\nhandful of hearers grew into assemblies often of several hundreds, drawn\r\nto Meaux from villages five or six leagues distant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A woman's pointed remark.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A favorite psalm.]\r\n\r\nBetrayed by their size, the conventicles came to the knowledge of the\r\nmagistrates, and on the eighth of September, 1546, a descent was made\r\nupon the worshipping Christians. Sixty-two persons composed the\r\ngathering. The lieutenant and provost of the city, with their meagre\r\nsuite, could easily have been set at defiance. But the announcement of\r\narrest in the king's name prevented any attempt either at resistance on\r\ntheir part, or at rescue on that of their friends. Respecting the\r\nauthority of law, the Protestants allowed themselves to be bound and led\r\naway by an insignificant detachment of officers. Only the pointed remark\r\nof one young woman to the lieutenant, as she was bound, has come down to\r\nus: \"Sir, had you found me in a brothel, as you now find me in so holy\r\nand honorable a company, you would not have used me thus.\" As the\r\nprisoners passed through the streets of Meaux, their friends neither\r\ninterfered with the ministers of justice, nor exhibited solicitude for\r\ntheir own safety; but accompanying them, as in a triumphal procession,\r\nloudly gave expression to their trust in God, by raising one of their\r\nfavorite psalms, in Clement Marot's translation:[510]\r\n\r\n    Les gens entrez sont en ton heritage:\r\n    Ils ont pollu, Seigneur, par leur outrage,\r\n    Ton temple sainct, Jerusalem destruite,\r\n    Si qu'en monceaux de pierres, l'on reduite.\r\n\r\nIt was neither the first time, nor was it destined to be by any means\r\nthe last, that those rugged, but nervous lines thrilled the souls of the\r\npersecuted Huguenots of France as with the sound of a trumpet, and\r\nbraced them to the patient endurance of suffering or to the performance\r\nof deeds of valor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Fourteen of Meaux.\"]\r\n\r\nDragged with excessive and unnecessary violence to Paris, the prisoners\r\nwere put on trial, and, within a single month, sentence was passed on\r\nthem. The crime of having celebrated the Lord's Supper was almost\r\ninexpiable. Fourteen men, with Leclerc their minister, and Étienne\r\nMangin, in whose house their worship had been held, were condemned to\r\ntorture and the stake; others to whipping and banishment; the remainder,\r\nboth men and women, to public penance and attendance upon the execution\r\nof their more prominent brethren. Upon one young man, whose tender years\r\nalone saved him from the flames, a sentence of a somewhat whimsical\r\ncharacter was pronounced. He was to be suspended under the arms during\r\nthe auto-da-fé of his brethren, and, with a halter around his neck, was\r\nfrom his elevated position to witness their agony, as an instructive\r\nwarning of the dangerous consequence of persistence in heretical errors.\r\nMangin's house was to be razed, and on the site a chapel of the Virgin\r\nerected, wherein a solemn weekly mass was to be celebrated in honor of\r\nthe sacramental wafer, the expense being defrayed by the confiscated\r\nproperty of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nNeither in the monasteries to which they were temporarily allotted, nor\r\non their way back to Meaux, did the courage of the \"Fourteen\" desert\r\nthem. It was even enhanced by the boldness of a weaver, who, meeting\r\nthem in the forest of Livry, cried out: \"My brethren, be of good cheer,\r\nand fail not through weariness to give with constancy the testimony you\r\nowe the Gospel. Remember Him who is on high in heaven!\"[511]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their execution.]\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of October, Mangin and Leclerc on hurdles, the others on\r\ncarts, were taken to the market-square, where fourteen stakes had been\r\nset up in a circle. Here, facing one another, amid the agonies of death,\r\nand in spite of the din made by priests and populace frantically\r\nintoning the hymns \"_O salutaris hostia_\" and \"_Salve Regina_\" they\r\ncontinued till their last breath to animate each other and to praise the\r\nAlmighty Giver of every blessing. But if the humane heart recoils with\r\nhorror from the very thought of the bloody holocaust, the scene of the\r\nmorrow inspires even greater disgust; when Picard, a doctor of the\r\nSorbonne, standing beneath a canopy glittering with gold, near the yet\r\nsmoking embers, assured the people that it was essential to salvation to\r\nbelieve that the \"Fourteen\" were condemned to the lowest abyss of hell,\r\nand that even the word of an angel from heaven ought not to be credited,\r\nif he maintained the contrary. \"For,\" said he, \"God would not be God did\r\nHe not consign them to everlasting damnation.\" Upon which charitable and\r\npious assertions of the learned theologian the Protestant chronicler had\r\nbut a simple observation to make: \"However, he could not persuade those\r\nwho knew them to be excellent men, and upright in their lives, that this\r\nwas so. Consequently the seed of the truth was not destroyed in the city\r\nof Meaux.\"[512]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wider diffusion of the reformed doctrines.]\r\n\r\nFar from witnessing the extinction of the Reformation in his dominions,\r\nthe last year of the life of Francis the First was signalized by its\r\nwider diffusion. At Senlis, at Orleans, and at Fère, near Soissons,\r\nfugitives from Meaux planted the germs of new religious communities.\r\nFresh fires were kindled to destroy them; and in one place a preacher\r\nwas burned in a novel fashion, with a pack of books upon his back.[513]\r\nLyons and Langres, in the east, received reformed teachers about the\r\nsame time; although from the latter place the pastor and four members of\r\nhis flock were carried to the capital and perished at the stake. Even\r\nSens, see of the primate, contributed its portion of witnesses for the\r\nGospel, who sealed their testimony in their blood.[514]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The printer, Jean Chapot, before parliament.]\r\n\r\nIn Paris itself parliament tried a native of Dauphiny, Jean Chapot, who,\r\nhaving brought several packages of books from Geneva, had been denounced\r\nby a brother printer. His defence was so apt and learned that the judges\r\nwere nearly shaken by his animated appeals. It fared ill with three\r\ndoctors of the Sorbonne, Dean Nicholas Clerici, and his assistants,\r\nPicard and Maillard, who were called in to refute him; for they could\r\nnot stand their ground, and were forced, avoiding proofs from the Holy\r\nScriptures, to have recourse to the authority of the church. In the end\r\nthe theologians covered their retreat with indignant remonstrances\r\naddressed to parliament for listening to such seductive speakers; and\r\nthe majority of the judges, mastering their first inclination to acquit\r\nChapot, condemned him to the stake, reserving for him the easier death\r\nby strangling, in case he recanted. An unusual favor was allowed him. He\r\nwas permitted to make a short speech previously to his execution. Faint\r\nand utterly unable to stand, in consequence of the tortures by which his\r\nbody had been racked, he was supported on either side by an attendant,\r\nand thus from the funeral cart explained his belief to the by-standers.\r\nBut when he reached the topic of the Lord's Supper, he was interrupted\r\nby one of the priests. The milder sentence of the halter was inflicted,\r\nin order to create the impression that he had been so weak as to repeat\r\nthe \"_Ave Maria_.\" But the practice henceforth uniformly followed by the\r\n\"_Chambre ardente_\" of parliament, of cutting out the tongues of the\r\ncondemned before sending them to public execution, confirmed the report\r\nthat Maillard had exclaimed that \"all would be lost, if such men were\r\nsuffered to speak to the people.\"[515]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: This was true particularly of the wealthy noble family to\r\nwhom belonged the fief of Cental, perhaps at a somewhat later date.\r\nAmong the Waldensian villages owned by it were those of La Motte\r\nd'Aigues, St. Martin, Lourmarin, Peypin, and others in the same\r\nvicinity.

The parliament\r\ncited the pontiff, and, when he failed to appear, loyally declared his\r\ntitle unsound, and, under the lead of their first president (another\r\nMeynier, Baron d'Oppède), proceeded at once to execute sentence by force\r\nof arms, and oust the surprised vice-legate. No resistance was\r\nattempted. Meynier was the first to render homage to the king for his\r\nbarony; and the people of Avignon, according to the admission of the\r\ndevout historian of Provence, celebrated their independence of the Pope\r\nand reunion to France by Te Deums and a thousand cries of joy and\r\nthanksgiving to Almighty God.

Their _Barbes_, who were carefully selected and\r\nordained only after long probation, could not marry. They were sent out\r\ntwo by two, the younger owing implicit obedience to the elder. Every\r\npart of the extensive territory over which their communities were\r\nscattered was visited at least once a year. Pastors, unless aged,\r\nremained no longer than three years in one place. While supported in\r\npart by the laity, they were compelled to engage in manual labor to such\r\nan extent as to interfere much with their spiritual office and preclude\r\nthe study that was desirable. The most objectionable feature in their\r\npractice was that they did not themselves administer the Lord's Supper,\r\nbut, while recommending to their flock to discard the superstitions\r\nenvironing the mass, enjoined upon them the reception of the eucharist\r\nat the hands of those whom they themselves regarded as the \"members of\r\nAntichrist.\" Oecolampadius, while approving their confession of faith\r\nand the chief points of their polity, strenuously exhorted them to\r\nrenounce all hypocritical conformity with the Roman Church, induced by\r\nfear of persecution, and strongly urged them to put an end to the\r\ncelibacy and itinerancy of their clergy, and to discontinue the\r\n\"sisterhoods\" that had arisen among them.

It\r\nappears that on a certain occasion the diocese of Autun was visited with\r\nthe plague of an excessive multiplication of mice. Ordinary means of\r\nstopping their ravages having failed, the vicar of the bishop was\r\nrequested to excommunicate them. But the ecclesiastical decree was\r\nsupposed to be most effective when the regular forms of a judicial trial\r\nwere duly observed. An advocate for the marauders was therefore\r\nappointed--no other than Chassanée himself; who, espousing with\r\nprofessional ardor the interests of his quadrupedal clients, began by\r\ninsisting that a summons should be served in each parish; next, excused\r\nthe non-appearance of the defendants by alleging the dangers of the\r\njourney by reason of the lying-in-wait of their enemies, the cats; and\r\nfinally, appealing to the compassion of the court in behalf of a race\r\ndoomed to wholesale destruction, acquitted himself so successfully of\r\nhis fantastic commission, that the mice escaped the censures of the\r\nchurch, and their advocate gained universal applause! See Crespin, fol.\r\n99; De Thou, i. 536, Gamier, xxvi. 29, etc. Crespin, writing at least as\r\nearly as 1560, speaks of the incident as being related in Chassanée's\r\n_Catalogus Gloriæ Mundi_; but I have been unable to find any reference\r\nto it in that singular medley.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: De Thou, i. 539.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: This striking incident is not noticed in the well-known\r\nMemoirs of Du Bellay, written by his brother.

Calvin relates it in two letters to Farel, published by Bonnet\r\n(Calvin's Letters, i. 162, 163-165).

While the inhabitants of Mérindol\r\nentered into negotiations, it is stated that those of Cabrières,\r\nsubjects of the Pope, took up arms. Twice they repulsed the\r\nvice-legate's forces, driving them back to the walls of Avignon and\r\nCavaillon. Flushed with success, they began to preach openly, to\r\noverturn altars, and to plunder churches. The Pope, therefore, Dec.,\r\n1543, called on Count De Grignan for assistance in exterminating the\r\nrebels. But the incidents here told conflict with the undeniable facts\r\nof Cardinal Sadolet's intercession for, and peaceable relations with the\r\ninhabitants of Cabrières in 1541 and 1542; as well as with the royal\r\nletters of March 17, 1549 (1550 New Style), and the report of Du Bellay.\r\nBouche, on the weak authority of _Meynier_, De la guerre civile, gives\r\nsimilar statements of excesses, ii. 611, 612.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: Hist. ecclés., i. 24; Crespin, fol. 101; De Thou, i. 539;\r\nBouche, ii. 612.

With whatever assiduity the poets and\r\nscholars of whom the late king had been a munificent patron, and the\r\ncourtiers who had basked in the sunshine of his favor, might apply\r\nthemselves to the celebration of his resplendent merits, posterity, less\r\nblind to his faults, has declined to confirm the title of \"great\"\r\naffixed to his name by contemporaries. The candid historian, undazzled\r\nby the glitter of his chivalric enterprises, may condemn the animus, but\r\ncan scarcely deny the substantial truth of the bitter reproaches in\r\nwhich the Emperor Charles the Fifth indulged, respecting the uniform\r\nfaithlessness of his ancient rival.[516] Much less can he pardon the\r\ncruel persecution which Francis allowed to be exercised against an\r\nunoffending part of his subjects, less from zeal for the tenets of the\r\nchurch whose cause he espoused than from a selfish fear lest his\r\nprerogative might be impaired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His three sons.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry, Duke of Orleans.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the new king.]\r\n\r\nOf the three sons of Francis, the dauphin and his youngest brother, the\r\nDuke of Angoulême, had been snatched away by death during the lifetime\r\nof their father.[517] The Duke of Orleans, who now ascended the throne\r\nas Henry the Second, was not a favorite son.[518] More than once he had\r\nincurred his father's grave displeasure by insubordination. A mad\r\nfrolic, in which the young prince undertook in sport to distribute the\r\nhigh offices of state, as if his father were already dead, and disclosed\r\nhis intention to recall to power the monarch's disgraced courtiers,\r\noccasioned a serious breach. More important consequences might have\r\nflowed from the unfortunate incident, had not the youth and the giddy\r\ncompanions of his revel sought safety in temporary exile from\r\ncourt.[519] From his father Henry inherited great bodily vigor, and\r\nremarkable skill in all games of strength and agility. His frame,\r\nnaturally well proportioned, was finely developed by exercise.[520] He\r\nwas accounted the fleetest runner, and the most graceful rider in\r\nFrance. He rarely suffered a day to pass without playing ball, not\r\nunfrequently after having hunted down a stag or two. In the more\r\ndangerous pastimes of mock combat and jousting he delighted to engage,\r\nto the no small alarm of all spectators.[521] Unfortunately, however,\r\nthe intellectual and moral development of the young prince had by no\r\nmeans kept pace with the growth of his physical powers. The sluggishness\r\nof his dull and unready comprehension had, at an earlier date, been\r\nnoticed by the Venetian Marino Cavalli, while, with a courtier's\r\nflattery, he likened him to those autumnal fruits that are more tardy in\r\nripening, but are of better quality and last longer than the fruits of\r\nsummer.[522] Although he had reached the age of twenty-eight years on\r\nthe very day of his accession, he was still a child in all that\r\nrespected the serious concerns of life and the duties of his elevated\r\nposition. Averse to that careful deliberation which the public affairs\r\ndemanded, and willing to be led by those who would _think_ for him, it\r\nimmediately became evident that he was destined to be the mere image of\r\na king, while the powers of royalty were to be enjoyed by his trusted\r\nadvisers and by those who could minister to his immoderate love of\r\npleasure. The issue abundantly proved the truth of the assertion that\r\nhis reign ought rather to be called the reign of Diana of Poitiers, of\r\nMontmorency, and of the Cardinal of Lorraine; of whom the last, it was\r\nsaid, had the king's conscience in his sleeve, and the first his body,\r\nas by some species of sorcery.[523]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wotton's view of the French court.]\r\n\r\nScarcely had Francis breathed his last when shrewd observers of the\r\ncurrent of political influence were able to make up their minds pretty\r\nfully upon the favorites that were to rule under Henry's name. \"The\r\nFrench king, straight after his father's death,\" wrote Dr. Wotton, \"hath\r\nrevoked the _Constable_ to the court again; who is now in as great\r\ntriumph (as men say) as ever he was, if it be not more.... Of the\r\nyounger sort of those that are at the court already, these seem to be\r\nthe chief favorites: _Andelot_, younger brother to Châtillon, and his\r\nbrother, the _Cardinal of Châtillon_; the Duke of Guise's sons, in a\r\nmanner all, but especially these: _Monsieur d'Aumale_ [Francis, later\r\nDuke of Guise], the _Bishop of Rheims_ [Cardinal Charles of Lorraine],\r\nand the _Bishop of Troyes_, who, as I hear say, are all three of the\r\ncouncil. Monsieur d'Aumale is in very great favour ... but in greatest\r\nestimation and favour of all, as it appeareth hitherto, either of them\r\nof the older sort or of the younger sort, seemeth to be the said Bishop\r\nof Rheims, who had the chief ordering of the king's house, he being\r\nDolphin; whom I could wish to be of as good judgment in matters of\r\nreligion as I take the Cardinal du Bellay to be, but I hear he is not\r\nso, but _very earnest in upholding the Romish blindness_.... Of the\r\ndames, Madame la Grande Senechale seemeth to be highly esteemed.\"[524]\r\n\r\nTo gain a clear view of the various influences--at one time neutralizing\r\neach other, and thus tending to the protection of the reformed\r\ndoctrines and their professors, but much more frequently acting in\r\nconcert, and tending to the suppression of those doctrines--it is\r\nnecessary that we examine in some detail the position of Diana, of the\r\nConstable, and of the Guises.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diana of Poitiers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king's infatuation.]\r\n\r\nDiana of Poitiers, daughter of Monsieur de St. Vallier, and widow of De\r\nBrezé, Grand Seneschal of Normandy, had in her youth been celebrated for\r\nher beauty, by which she had first captivated Francis the First, and\r\nafterward made Henry forget the claims of his Florentine bride upon his\r\naffections. But she was now a matron of forty-seven years of age, and\r\nthe public wondered as they saw the undiminished devotion of the new\r\nmonarch to a woman nearly a score of years older than himself. It is\r\ntrue that the courtier's pen of Brantôme ascribes to her all the\r\nfreshness of youth even at the close of the reign of Henry the Second.\r\nHis eulogium, however, is scarcely more worthy of credit than Homer's\r\npraise of the undiminished personal beauty of Helen, when, twenty years\r\nsubsequently to the departure of the expedition to Troy, the Ithacan\r\nprince found her reigning again at Sparta. But of the influence which\r\nDiana possessed over Henry there could be no doubt. By the vulgar it was\r\nattributed to the use of charms and love-potions. The infatuation of the\r\nmonarch knew no bounds. He loaded her with gifts; he entrusted her with\r\nthe crown jewels;[525] he conferred upon her the dignity of a duchess of\r\nValentinois. In her apartments he spent hours daily, in company with his\r\nmost intimate courtiers. Through love for her he adopted her favorite\r\ncolors, and took for his device the crescent, with the words, \"Totum\r\ndonec compleat orbem.\" The public edifices of his time, it is said,\r\nstill bear testimony to this dishonorable attachment, in the initials or\r\nemblems of Henry and Diana sculptured together upon their façades; and\r\nthe Venetian Soranzo, at a later period in Henry's reign, magnifying her\r\ninfluence upon every department of the administration, affirms, in\r\nparticular, that the dispensation of ecclesiastical offices was in her\r\nhands.[526] It is not surprising that, being of an avaricious\r\ncharacter, she soon accumulated great wealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constable Anne de Montmorency.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His cruelty.]\r\n\r\nAnne de Montmorency, one of the four marshals of France, grand-master of\r\nthe palace, and constable, was among the most notable personages of the\r\nsixteenth century. Sprung from a family claiming descent from the first\r\nFrank that followed the example of Clovis in renouncing paganism, and\r\nbearing on its escutcheon the motto, \"God defend the first Christian,\"\r\nhe likewise arrogated the foremost rank in the nobility as the first\r\nbaron of the kingdom. From his youth he was accustomed to association\r\nwith royalty. Margaret of Navarre was his early friend, and at a later\r\nperiod had occasion to complain of his ingratitude. He was at this time\r\nfifty-five years of age, severe, stern, fond of arms, complaisant to\r\nroyalty, but harsh and overbearing in his relations with inferiors. Of\r\nhis personal valor there can be no doubt, and he was generally regarded\r\nas the ablest general in France--an opinion, it is true, which his\r\nsubsequent ill-success contributed much to shake.[527] But his martial\r\nglory was dimmed by his well-known avarice, his ignorance,[528] and a\r\ncruelty that often approached ferocity. Of this last trait a signal\r\ninstance was afforded when Montmorency was sent, in the year after\r\nHenry's accession, to suppress a formidable revolt which had broken out\r\nin Guyenne, in consequence of a considerable increase of the already\r\nburdensome impost upon salt. He haughtily refused to accept the keys of\r\nthe city of Bordeaux tendered to him by the citizens on his approach.\r\nHis artillery, he said, would serve him as well in gaining admission.\r\nThe severity of the retribution meted out under his superintendence to\r\nthose who had ventured to resist the royal authority was unparalleled in\r\nFrench history.[529] If the constable's ferocity did not diminish with\r\nage, it acquired a tinge of the ludicrous from his growing superstition.\r\nNever would he omit his devotions at the appointed hour, whether at home\r\nor in the field--\"so conscientious was he.\" But he would interrupt the\r\nrecital of his _pater-nosters_ with such orders as the emergency might\r\ndemand, or his inclination prompt: \"Seize such a man! Hang that one to a\r\ntree! Run that fellow through at once with your pikes, or shoot him down\r\nbefore my eyes! Cut the knaves to pieces that have undertaken to hold\r\nthat belfry against the king! Burn that village! Fire everything to the\r\ndistance of a quarter of a league!\" So terrible a reputation did his\r\ndevotions consequently acquire, that it was a current saying: \"Beware of\r\nthe constable's pater-nosters!\"[530]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His unpopularity.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, Anne de Montmorency was ill-fitted to win popularity. A\r\ndespatch of Sir John Mason, three years later, gives a glimpse of his\r\nrelations with his fellow-courtiers. \"There is a little _square_,\" he\r\nwrites, \"between the Duchess of Valentinois, who ruleth the roast, and\r\nthe constable. A great many of the court _wisheth the increase thereof.\r\nHe is very ill-beloved_, for that he is a hinderer of all men saving his\r\nown kinsfolks, whom he doth so advance as no man may have anything by\r\nhis will but they, and for that also he feedeth every man with fair\r\nwords, and performeth nothing.\"[531]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recalled from disgrace by Henry II.]\r\n\r\nFor six years before the death of Francis the First the constable had\r\nbeen living in retirement upon his estates. The occasion of his\r\nbanishment from court is stated, by one who enjoyed the best\r\nopportunities for learning the truth, to have been the advice which he\r\nhad given the monarch to permit the Emperor Charles the Fifth to pass\r\nthrough his dominions when going to Netherlands to suppress the revolt\r\nof the burghers of Ghent.[532] Francis, indeed, is said on his deathbed\r\nto have warned his son against the dangers with which the ambition of\r\nthe constable and of the family of Guise threatened his kingdom. But, as\r\nwe have seen, Henry had no sooner received tidings of his father's\r\ndeath, than he at once summoned Montmorency to court, and resigned to\r\nhim undisputed control of the affairs of state. The Venetian Dandolo,\r\nsent to congratulate the monarch upon his advent to the throne,\r\nfelicitated the favorite on his merited resumption of his former rank\r\nand the honor of the \"_universal charge_\" which he held.[533] He was now\r\nall-powerful. The Duchess d'Étampes, mistress of the late king, to whose\r\ninfluence his disgrace was in part owing, for this and other offences\r\nwas exiled from court and sent to the castle of her husband.[534]\r\nAdmiral Annebaut and the Cardinal of Tournon were removed from the head\r\nof the administration. The former, of whose sterling worth Francis\r\nentertained so high an appreciation that he had bequeathed to him the\r\nsum of 100,000 livres, was compelled to resign his place as Marshal of\r\nFrance in favor of a new favorite--Jacques d'Albon de St. André, of whom\r\nmore particular mention must be made presently.[535]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The family of Guise.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke Claude.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Cardinal of Lorraine.]\r\n\r\nFrancis is reported to have included the family of Guise with Constable\r\nMontmorency in the warning addressed to his son, and the story, received\r\nby the people as an undoubted truth, circulated in a poetical form for\r\nmany years.[536] The Guises were of foreign extraction, and had but\r\nrecently become residents of France. Claude, the fifth son of the Duke\r\nof Lorraine, at that time an independent state, came to the French\r\ncourt, in the early part of the sixteenth century, in quest of\r\nopportunities to advance his fortunes greater than were open to a\r\nyounger member of the reigning family in his father's contracted\r\ndominions. Partly through the influence of Montmorency, partly in\r\nconsequence of his marriage with Antoinette of Bourbon, a princess of\r\nroyal blood, in some degree also by his own abilities, the young\r\nforeigner was rapidly advanced, from the comparatively insignificant\r\nposition at first assigned him, to more important trusts. At length he\r\nbecame royal lieutenant of the provinces of Champagne and Burgundy, and\r\nhis small domain of Guise was erected into a duchy.[537] His younger\r\nbrother John, who had entered the church as offering the most promising\r\nroad to the attainment of his ambitious designs, had also come westward;\r\nand, proving to be a jovial companion whose presence imposed no\r\nrestraint upon the license of a profligate court, he fared even better\r\nin securing ecclesiastical preferment than his brother in obtaining\r\nsecular advantages.[538] In his favor Francis made use, in a manner\r\nlavish beyond precedent, of the right of nomination to benefices secured\r\nto the crown by the concordat. Even an age well accustomed to the abuse\r\nof the plurality of offices was amazed to see John of Lorraine at one\r\nand the same time Archbishop of Lyons, Rheims, and Narbonne, Bishop of\r\nMetz, Toul, Verdun, Therouenne, Luçon, Alby, and Valence, and Abbot of\r\nGorze, Fécamp, Clugny, and Marmoutier.[539] To gratify the French\r\nmonarch, Pope Leo the Tenth added to the dignity of the young\r\necclesiastic, by conferring upon him the Cardinal's hat a year or two\r\nbefore he had attained his majority.[540] Shrewd and plausible, the\r\nCardinal of Lorraine, as he was henceforth called, contributed not a\r\nlittle to his brother's rapid advancement; and, as it was well\r\nunderstood that the rich benefices he held and the accumulation of his\r\nwealth would go, at his death, to enrich his nephews, he was treated\r\nwith great deference by all the members of his brother's family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage of James V. of Scotland to Mary of Lorraine.]\r\n\r\nAn important era in the history of the Guises is marked by the marriage\r\neffected, in 1538, between James the Fifth of Scotland and Mary of\r\nLorraine, the eldest daughter of Claude. This royal alliance secured for\r\nthe Guises a predominant influence in North British affairs after the\r\ndeath of James. It brought them into close connection with the crown of\r\nFrance, when Mary, Queen of Scots, the fruit of this union, was\r\naffianced to the son of Henry the Second, the dauphin, afterward Francis\r\nthe Second. It encouraged the adherents of this house to attribute to it\r\nan almost regal dignity, and to intimate more and more plainly its claim\r\nupon the throne of France, as descended through the Dukes of Lorraine\r\nfrom Charlemagne--a title superior to that of the Valois, who could\r\ntrace their origin to no higher source than the usurper Hugh Capet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The duke's sons.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis of Guise.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles, Cardinal of Guise, and afterward of Lorraine.]\r\n\r\nBut the second generation of the Guises was destined to exert, during\r\nthe reign of Henry the Second, an influence more controlling than the\r\nbrothers Claude and John had exerted during his father's reign. The six\r\nsons of Claude--all displaying the grasping disposition of the house\r\nfrom which they sprang, all aiming at the acquisition of position and\r\nwealth, each of them insatiable, yet never exhibiting a rivalry that\r\nmight prove detrimental to their common expectations--throw into\r\nobscurity the surprising success of their father and uncle, by their own\r\nmarvellous prosperity. Scarcely had a third part of Henry's reign gone\r\nby, before foreign ambassadors wrote home glowing accounts of the\r\ninfluence of the younger favorites. \"The credit of the house of Guise in\r\nthis court,\" said one, \"passeth all others. For albeit the constable\r\nhath the outward administration of all things, being for that service\r\nsuch a man as hard it were to find the like, yet have they so much\r\ncredit _as he with whom he is constrained to sail_, and many times to\r\ntake that course that he liketh never a whit.\"[541] Francis, the eldest\r\nson, known until his father's death as the Count of Aumale, and\r\nafterward succeeding him as Duke of Guise, entered the inviting\r\nprofession of arms. The second son, Charles, chose the life of an\r\necclesiastic, and soon assumed with respect to his brothers a commanding\r\nposition similar to that which John had occupied. At an early age he had\r\nbeen elevated to the Archbishopric of Rheims, voluntarily ceded to him\r\nby his uncle. Henry, soon after his accession, obtained from the pontiff\r\na place in the consistory for the young ecclesiastic, who then became\r\nknown as the Cardinal of Guise, and, after his uncle's death, in 1550,\r\nas Cardinal of Lorraine. The four younger brothers respectively figured\r\nin subsequent years as the Duke of Aumale, the Cardinal of Guise, the\r\nMarquis of Elbeuf, and the Grand Prior of France.[542]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Francis.]\r\n\r\nFrancis of Guise, although but twenty-eight years of age, was already\r\nregarded as a brilliant general and an accomplished courtier. Vain and\r\nostentatious, yet possessed of more real military ability than his\r\nunfortunate Italian campaign of 1556 would seem to indicate, he won\r\nlaurels at Metz, at Calais, and at Thionville.[543] Outside of the\r\npursuits of war he was grossly ignorant, and in all civil and religious\r\nmatters he allowed himself to be governed by the advice of his brother\r\nCharles. Even the Protestants, whom he so deeply injured, would for the\r\nmost part have acquiesced in the opinion of the cabinet minister, De\r\nl'Aubespine, that the Duke of Guise was a captain capable of rendering\r\ngood service to his native land, had he not been hindered and infected\r\nby his brother's ambition. It is the same trustworthy authority who\r\nstates that the duke was more than once induced to exclaim of his\r\nbrother Charles: \"That man in the end will ruin us.\"[544]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Various estimates of the second Cardinal of Lorraine.]\r\n\r\nThe portraits of men who, for weal or woe, have exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence upon their times, are frequently painted so differently by\r\ntheir advocates and by their opponents, that for him who would obtain an\r\nimpartial view of their merits or defects it will prove a difficult task\r\nto discover any means of removing the discrepancies in the\r\nrepresentations and attaining the truth. Fortunate must he esteem\r\nhimself if he chance to find some contemporary, less directly interested\r\nin the events and persons described, to furnish him with the results of\r\nunbiassed observation. In the conflict of the Protestant and Roman\r\nCatholic writers of France respecting Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, the\r\n\"relations\" of the Venetian ambassadors, devoted adherents of the Holy\r\nSee, made to the doge and senate of their native state, and given under\r\nthe seal of secrecy, must be esteemed a rich historical legacy. The\r\ncardinal's intellect, these envoys tell us, was wonderfully acute. He\r\nunderstood the point at which those who conversed with him were aiming\r\nwhen they had scarcely opened their mouth. His memory was more than\r\nusually retentive. He was well educated, and learned not only in Greek,\r\nLatin, and Italian, but in the sciences, and especially in theology. He\r\nhad a rare gift of talking. In the fulfilment of his promises he was\r\nless famous. According to one ambassador, he had the reputation of\r\nrarely speaking the truth. Another styles him little truthful, and of a\r\ndeceitful and avaricious disposition.[545] Both agree in representing\r\nhim as covetous \"beyond the avarice natural to the French, even\r\nemploying dishonorable means to increase his wealth.\"[546] Both unite in\r\nextolling his administrative abilities. In observance of the precepts\r\nof the church he was exemplary. Yearly did he retire from court to spend\r\nthe season of Lent on some one of his numerous possessions. In life, \"so\r\nfar as the outside is concerned,\" he observed the decorum appropriate to\r\nhis rank, thus presenting a striking contrast to the other cardinals and\r\nprelates of the kingdom, who were \"of a most licentious character.\" But\r\nhe was vindictive, slow in rewarding services, and so violent that it\r\nwas probable that no other event was so much desired in France as his\r\ndeath.[547] The scandalous stories related by Brantôme, which have\r\ngenerally been understood to apply to Cardinal _Charles_ of Lorraine,\r\nreally refer, as Ranke has observed,[548] to his uncle, the Cardinal\r\n_John_; but the abbé, who was certainly not unfriendly to the Guises,\r\nmingles praise and censure as equal ingredients in sketching the\r\ncharacter of the former. If he was \"very religious,\" after Brantôme's\r\nidea of religion, he was also esteemed a \"great hypocrite,\" with whom\r\nreligion served as a stepping-stone to greatness. If he was a \"holy\"\r\nman, he was \"not too conscientious.\" If gracious and affable at times,\r\nit was only when something had gone wrong with him; for in prosperity no\r\none was more overbearing.[549]\r\n\r\nSuch, according to writers of his own religion, was the churchman of\r\nwhom, with Diana of Poitiers, the cabinet minister who knew both well\r\nwrote: \"It were to be desired that this woman and the cardinal had\r\nnever been born; for they two alone have been the spark that kindled our\r\nmisfortunes.\"[550] Pasquin well reflected the sentiments of the people\r\nwhen he altered the motto that accompanied the device of the\r\ncardinal--an ivy-clad pyramid--from \"Te stante, virebo\" to \"Te virente,\r\nperibo.\"[551]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rapacity of the new favorites.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marshal Saint-André.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Servility toward Diana of Poitiers.]\r\n\r\nWith a weak-minded prince, averse to anything except the gratification\r\nof his passions, and under the influence of such counsellors, France\r\nbecame almost of necessity a scene of rapacity beyond all precedent. The\r\nprinces of the blood continued in their exclusion from official\r\npositions. Each of the new favorites was not only eager to obtain wealth\r\nfor himself, but had a number of relations for whom provision must also\r\nbe made. To the more prominent courtiers above enumerated was added\r\nJacques d'Albon de Saint-André, son of Henry's tutor, who, from\r\naccidental intimacy with the king in childhood, was led to aspire to\r\nhigh dignities in the state, and was not long in obtaining a marshal's\r\nbaton.[552] Herself securing not only the rank of Duchess of\r\nValentinois, with the authority of a queen,[553] but the enormous\r\nrevenues derived from the customary confirmation of offices at the\r\nbeginning of a new reign, Diana permitted the constable, the Guises, and\r\nSaint-André to partake to a less degree in the spoils of the kingdom. A\r\ncontemporary writer likens the brood of courtiers she gathered about her\r\nto swallows in pursuit of flies on a summer's evening. Nothing escaped\r\nthem--rank, dignity, bishopric, abbey, office, or other dainty\r\nmorsel--all alike were eagerly devoured. Spies and salaried agents were\r\nposted in all parts of the kingdom to convey the earliest intelligence\r\nof the death of those who possessed any valuable benefices. Physicians\r\nin their employ at Paris sent in frequent bulletins of the health of\r\nsick men who enjoyed offices in church or state; nor were instances\r\nwanting in which, for the present of a thousand crowns, they were said\r\nto have hastened a wealthy patient's death. Even the king was unable to\r\ngive as he wished, and sought to escape the importunity of his favorites\r\nby falsely assuring them that he had already made promises to others.\r\nThus only could they be kept at bay.[554] The Guises and Montmorency, to\r\nrender their power more secure, courted the favor of the king's\r\nmistress. The Cardinal of Lorraine, in particular, distinguished himself\r\nby the servility which he displayed. For two years he put himself to\r\ninfinite trouble to be at the table of Diana.[555] After her elevation\r\nto the peerage, he addressed to her a letter, still extant, in which he\r\nassured her that henceforth his interest and hers were inseparable.[556]\r\nTo give yet greater firmness to the bond uniting them, the Guises\r\nbrought about a marriage between their third brother, the Duke of\r\nAumale, and one of the daughters of the Duchess of Valentinois; while\r\nthe Constable of Montmorency, at a later time, undertook to gain a\r\nsimilar advantage for his own family by causing his son to wed Diana, a\r\nnatural daughter of the king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution to atone for moral blemishes.]\r\n\r\nIt may at first sight appear somewhat incongruous that a king and court\r\nthus given up, the former to flagrant immorality, the latter to the\r\nunbridled pursuit of riches and honors, should early have exhibited a\r\ndisposition to carry forward in an aggravated form the system of\r\npersecution initiated in the previous reign. The secret of the apparent\r\ninconsistency may be found in the fact that the courtiers were not slow\r\nin perceiving, on the one hand, the almost incalculable gains which the\r\nconfiscation of the goods of condemned heretics might be made to yield,\r\nand, on the other, the facility with which a monarch of a disposition\r\nnaturally gentle and humane[557] could be persuaded to countenance the\r\nmost barbarous cruelties, as the supposed means of atoning for the\r\ndissoluteness of his own life. The observance of the strict precepts of\r\nthe moral law, they argued, was of less importance than the purity of\r\nthe faith. The title of \"Very Christian\" had been borne by some of his\r\npredecessors whose private lives had been full of gallantries. His claim\r\nto it would be forfeited by the adoption of the stern principles of the\r\nreformers; while the Pontiff who conferred it would never venture to\r\nremove the honorable distinction, or refuse to unlock the gates of\r\nparadise to him who should prove himself an obedient son of the church\r\nand a persecutor of its enemies. To fulfil these conditions was the\r\neasier, as the persons upon whom were to be exercised the severities\r\ndictated by heaven, plotted revolutions and aspired to convert France\r\ninto a republic, on the pattern of the cantons of Switzerland. Lending a\r\nwilling ear to these suggestions, Henry the Second no sooner began to\r\nreign than he began to persecute.[558]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Chambre ardente.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Fontainebleau against books from Geneva.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deceptive title-pages.]\r\n\r\nToward the close of the reign of Francis, the prisons of Normandy had\r\nbecome so full of persons incarcerated for religion's sake, that a\r\nseparate and special chamber had been instituted in the Parliament of\r\nRouen, to give exclusive attention to the trial of such cases.[559] One\r\nof Henry's first acts was to establish a similar chamber in the\r\nParliament of Paris.[560] Judges selected with such a commission were\r\nnot likely to incline to the side of mercy; and the chamber speedily\r\nearned for itself, by the numbers of victims it sent to the flames, the\r\nsignificant popular name of \"_la Chambre ardente_.\"[561] The rapid\r\npropagation of the reformed doctrines by the press gave occasion to the\r\npublication of a new edict. The printing of any book containing matters\r\npertaining to the Holy Scriptures was strictly forbidden. Equally\r\nprohibited was the sale of books brought from Geneva, Germany, or other\r\nforeign parts, without the approval of the Theological Faculty of Paris.\r\nAll annotated copies of the Bible must contain the name of the author,\r\nand the publisher's name and address. Persons of all ranks were warned\r\nagainst retaining in their possession any condemned work.[562] But these\r\nrestrictions had little effect in repressing the spread of the\r\nReformation. If a severe blow was struck at the publishing trade in\r\nFrance, the dissemination of books printed abroad, and, frequently, with\r\nspurious title-pages,[563] was largely increased. It now assumed,\r\nhowever, a more stealthy and cautious character.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Brugière.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tailor of the Rue St. Antoine.]\r\n\r\nBlood flowed in every part of the kingdom. Not only the capital, but\r\nalso the provinces furnished their constant witnesses to the truth of\r\nthe \"Lutheran\" doctrines. The noted trial and execution of John Brugière\r\nrevealed to the First President of Parliament the humiliating fact that\r\nthe Reformation had gained a strong foothold in his native\r\nAuvergne.[564] At Paris, one Florence Venot was confined seven weeks in\r\na cell upon the construction of which so much perverted ingenuity had\r\nbeen expended that the prisoner could neither lie down nor stand erect,\r\nand the hour of release from weary torture was waited for with ardent\r\nlonging, even if it led to the stake.[565] But the death of a nameless\r\ntailor has, by the singularity of its incidents, acquired a celebrity\r\nsurpassing that of any other martyrdom in the early part of this reign.\r\nIn the midst of the tourneys and other festivities provided to signalize\r\nthe occasion of the queen's coronation and his own solemn entry into\r\nParis, the desire seized Henry to see with his own eyes and to\r\ninterrogate one of the members of the sect to whose account such serious\r\ncharges were laid. A poor tailor, arrested in his shop in the Rue St.\r\nAntoine, a few paces from the royal palace, for the crime of working on\r\na day which the church had declared holy, was brought before him. So\r\ncontemptible a dialectician could do little, it was presumed, to shake\r\nthe faith of the Very Christian King. But the result disappointed the\r\nexpectations of the courtiers and ecclesiastics that were present. The\r\ntailor answered with respectful boldness to the questions propounded by\r\nChâtellain, Bishop of Macon, a prelate once favorable to the\r\nReformation. Hereupon Diana of Poitiers, an interested opponent, whose\r\ncoffers were being filled with the goods of condemned heretics,\r\nundertook to silence him with the tongue of a witty woman. The tailor,\r\nwho had patiently borne the ridicule and scorn with which he had\r\nhitherto been treated, turned upon the mistress of the king a look of\r\nsolemn warning as he said: \"Madam, let it suffice you to have infected\r\nFrance, without desiring to mingle your poison and filth with so holy\r\nand sacred a thing as the true religion of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" The\r\ncourtiers were thunderstruck at the turn taken by a discussion to which\r\nthey had flocked as to a scene of diversion, and the enraged king\r\nordered the tailor's instant trial and punishment. He even desired with\r\nhis own eyes to see him undergo the extreme penalty of the law. A solemn\r\nprocession had been ordered to proceed from St. Paul's to Notre Dame.\r\nThe prayers there offered for the destruction of heresy were followed by\r\nan \"exemplary demonstration\" of the king's pious disposition, in the\r\nexecution of four \"Lutherans\" in as many different squares of the\r\ncity.[566] In order the better to see the punishment inflicted upon the\r\ntailor of the Rue St. Antoine, Henry posted himself at a window that\r\ncommanded the entire spectacle. But it was no coward's death that he\r\nbeheld. Soon perceiving and recognizing the monarch before whom he had\r\nwitnessed so good a profession, the tailor fixed his gaze upon him, nor\r\nwould he avert his face, however much the king ordered that his position\r\nshould be changed. Even in the midst of the flames he still continued to\r\ndirect his dying glance toward the king, until the latter, abashed, was\r\ncompelled to withdraw from the window. For days Henry declared that the\r\nspectre haunted his waking hours and drove sleep from his eyes at night;\r\nand he affirmed with an oath that never again would he witness so\r\nhorrible a scene.[567] Happy would it have been for his memory had he\r\nadhered, in the case of Anne du Bourg, to so wise a resolution!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other victims of intolerance.]\r\n\r\nThe ashes of one martyr were scarcely cold before new fires were\r\nkindled--now before the cathedral, now before some parish church, again\r\nin the crowded market or in the distant provincial town. At one time it\r\nwas a widow that welcomed the rope that bound her, as the zone given her\r\nby a heavenly bridegroom in token of her approaching nuptials. A few\r\nyears later, it was a nobleman who, when in view of his rank the\r\nsentence of the judges would have spared him the indignity of the halter\r\nwhich was placed around the neck of his companions, begged the\r\nexecutioner to make no exception in his case, saying: \"Deny me not the\r\ncollar of so excellent an order.\"[568]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Severe edicts and quarrels with Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Châteaubriand, June 27, 1551.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War upon the books from Geneva.]\r\n\r\nThe failure, however, of these fearful exhibitions to strike terror into\r\nthe minds of the persecuted, or accomplish the end for which they were\r\nundertaken, is proved by their frequent recurrence, and not less by the\r\nnew series of sanguinary laws running through the reign of Henry. An\r\nedict from Paris, on the nineteenth of November, 1549, endeavored to\r\nremove all excuse for remissness on the part of the prelates, by\r\nconferring on the ecclesiastical judges the unheard-of privilege of\r\narresting for the crime of heresy, the exclusive right of passing\r\njudgment upon simple heresy, and conjoint jurisdiction with the civil\r\ncourts in cases in which public scandal, riot, or sedition might be\r\ninvolved.[569] Less than two years later, when Henry, uniting with\r\nMaurice of Saxony and Albert of Brandenburg, received the title of\r\nDefender of the Empire against Charles the Fifth, and was on the point\r\nof making war on Pope Julius the Third, he issued an edict forbidding\r\nhis subjects, under severe penalties, from carrying gold or silver to\r\nRome.[570] But, to convince the world of his orthodoxy, he chose the\r\nsame time for the publication of a new and more truculent measure, known\r\nas the _Edict of Châteaubriand_ (on the twenty-seventh of June, 1551),\r\ndirected against the reformed.[571] This notable law reiterated the old\r\ncomplaint of the ill-success of previous efforts, and the statement of\r\nthe impossibility of attaining the desired end save by diligent care and\r\nrigorous procedure. Its most striking peculiarity was that it committed\r\nthe trial of heretics to the newly appointed \"presidial\" judges, whose\r\nsentence, when ten counsellors had been associated with them, was to be\r\nfinal.[572] Thus was it contemplated to put an end to the vexatious\r\ndelays by means of which the trial of many a reputed \"Lutheran\" had been\r\nprotracted and not a few of the hated sect had in the end escaped. But\r\nthe large number of additional articles exhibit in a singular manner the\r\nextent to which the doctrines of the Reformation had spread, the means\r\nof their diffusion, and the method by which it was hoped that they might\r\nbe eradicated. Prominent among the provisions appear those that relate\r\nto the products of the press. Evidently the Cardinal of Lorraine and the\r\nother advisers of the king were of the same mind with the great advocate\r\nof unlicensed printing, when he said: \"Books are not absolutely dead\r\nthings, but do contain a progeny of life in them to be as active as that\r\nsoul was whose progeny they are.... I know they are as lively and as\r\nvigorously productive as those fabulous dragon's teeth; and being sown\r\nup and down, may chance to spring up armed men.\"[573] The edict utterly\r\nprohibited the introduction of any books from Geneva and other places\r\nnotoriously rebellious to the Holy See, the retention of condemned books\r\nby booksellers, and all clandestine printing. It instituted a\r\nsemi-annual visitation of every typographical establishment, a clerical\r\nexamination of all packages from abroad, a special inspection thrice a\r\nyear at the great fairs of Lyons, through which many suspected books\r\nfound their way into the kingdom. The \"porte-panier,\" or pedler, was\r\nforbidden to sell books at all, because many pedlers brought in books\r\nfrom Geneva under pretext of selling other merchandise. The bearers of\r\nletters from Geneva were to be arrested and punished. The goods and\r\nchattels of those who had fled to Geneva were to be confiscated.\r\nInformers were promised one-third of the property of the condemned. And\r\nlest the tongue should contaminate those whom the printed volume might\r\nnot reach, all unlettered persons were warned not even to _discuss_\r\nmatters of faith, the sacraments, and the polity of the church, whether\r\nat the table, in the field, or in secret conventicle.[574]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The book-pedlers of Switzerland, etc.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the \"dragon's teeth\" were beginning to spring up\r\nwarriors full armed; but the sowing still went on. From Geneva, from\r\nNeufchâtel, from Strasbourg, and from other points, devoted men of\r\nardent piety, and often of no little cultivation, entered France and\r\ncautiously sold or distributed the contents of the packs they carried.\r\nOften they penetrated far into the country. To such as were detected the\r\npenalty of the law was inexorably meted out. A pedler, after every bone\r\nof his body had been dislocated in the vain attempt to compel him to\r\nbetray the names of those to whom he had sold his books, was burned at\r\nParis in the midst of the applauding shouts of a great crowd of persons,\r\nwho would have torn him to pieces had they been allowed.[575] The\r\nprinters of French Switzerland willingly entrusted their publications to\r\nthese faithful men, not without danger of the loss of their goods; and\r\nit was almost incredible how many men offered themselves to the extreme\r\nperils which threatened them.[576] The Edict of Châteaubriand, intended\r\nto destroy the rising intellectual and moral influence of Geneva, it\r\nmust be noticed, had the opposite effect; for nothing had up to this\r\ntime so tended to collect the scattered Protestants of France in a city\r\nwhere, free from the temptation to conformity with the dominant\r\nreligion, they received a training adapted to qualify them for\r\nusefulness in their native land.[577]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marshal Vieilleville refuses to profit by confiscation.]\r\n\r\nYet the publication of the Edict of Châteaubriand was the signal for the\r\nrenewal of the severity of the persecution. Every day, says the\r\nhistorian De Thou, persons were burned at Paris on account of religion.\r\nCardinal Tournon and Diana of Poitiers, he tells us, shared in the\r\nopprobrium of being the instigators of these atrocities. With the latter\r\nit was less fanaticism than a desire to augment the proceeds of the\r\nconfiscation of the property of condemned heretics which she had lately\r\nsecured for herself, and was employing to make up the ransom of her two\r\nsons-in-law, now prisoners of war.[578] Very few of the courtiers of\r\nHenry's court had a spark of the magnanimity that fired the breast of\r\nthe Marshal de Vieilleville. The name of this nobleman had, unknown to\r\nhim, been inserted in a royal patent giving to him and others, who\r\ndesired to shield themselves behind his honorable name, the confiscated\r\ngoods of all condemned usurers and Lutherans in Guyenne and five other\r\nprovinces of Southern France. When the document was placed in his hands,\r\nand he was assured that it would yield to each of the six patentees\r\ntwenty thousand crowns within four months, the marshal exclaimed: \"And\r\nhere we stand registered in the courts of parliament as devourers of the\r\npeople!... Besides that, for twenty thousand crowns to incur\r\nindividually the curses of a countless number of women and children that\r\nwill die in the poor-house in consequence of the forfeiture of the lives\r\nand property of their husbands and fathers, by fair means or foul--this\r\nwould be to plunge ourselves into perdition at too cheap a rate!\" So\r\nsaying, Vieilleville drove his dagger through his own name in the\r\npatent, and others, through shame, following his example, the document\r\nwas torn to pieces.[579]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Five Scholars of Lausanne.\"]\r\n\r\nOf the considerable number of those upon whom the \"very rigorous\r\nprocedures\" laid down by the Edict of Châteaubriand were executed in\r\nalmost all parts of France, according to the historian of the reformed\r\nchurches,[580] the \"_Five Scholars of Lausanne_\" deserve particular\r\nmention. Natives of different points in France, these young men, with\r\nothers, had enjoyed in the distinguished school instituted in the chief\r\ncity of the Pays de Vaud, under the protection of the Bernese, the\r\ninstructions of Theodore Beza and other prominent reformed theologians.\r\nTheir names were: Martial Alba, a native of Montauban; Pierre Écrivain,\r\nof Boulogne, in Gascony; Bernard Seguin, of La Réolle, in Bazadois;\r\nCharles Favre, of Blanzac; and Pierre Navihères, of Limoges. A short\r\ntime before Easter, 1552, these young men, who had reached different\r\nstages in their course of study,[581] conceived it to be their duty to\r\nreturn to their native land, whence the most pressing calls for\r\nadditional laborers qualified to instruct others were daily coming to\r\nSwitzerland. Their plan was cordially endorsed by Beza, before whom it\r\nwas first laid by one of their number who had been an inmate of his\r\nhome, and then by the Church of Lausanne; for it evidenced the purity\r\nand sincerity of their zeal. Provided with cordial letters from\r\nLausanne, as well as from Geneva, through which they passed, they\r\nstarted each for his native city, intending to labor first of all for\r\nthe conversion of their own kindred and neighbors. But a different\r\nfield, and a shorter term of service than they had anticipated, were in\r\nstore for them. At Lyons, having accepted the invitation of a\r\nfellow-traveller to visit him at his country-seat, they were surprised\r\non the first of May, 1552, by the provost and his guards, and, although\r\nthey had committed no violation of the king's edicts by proclaiming the\r\ndoctrines they believed, were hurried to the archiepiscopal prison, and\r\nconfined in separate dungeons. From their prayers for divine assistance\r\nthey were soon summoned to appear singly before the \"official\"--the\r\necclesiastical judge to whom the archbishop deputed his judicial\r\nfunctions.[582] The answers to the interrogatories, of which they\r\ntransmitted to their friends a record, it has been truly said, put to\r\nshame the lukewarmness of our days by their courage, and amaze us by the\r\npresence of mind and the wonderful acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures\r\nthey display.[583] He who will peruse them in the worm-eaten pages of\r\nthe \"Actiones Martyrum,\" in which their letters were collected by the\r\npious zeal of a contemporary, cannot doubt the proficiency these\r\nyouthful prisoners had attained, both in sacred and in human letters, at\r\nthe feet of the renowned Beza. Their unanswerable defence, however, only\r\nsecured their more speedy condemnation as heretics. On the thirteenth of\r\nMay they were sentenced to the flames; but an appeal which they made\r\nfrom the sentence of the ecclesiastical judge, on the plea that it\r\ncontravened the laws of France, secured delay until their case could be\r\nlaid before parliament. Months elapsed. Tidings of the danger that\r\noverhung the young students of Lausanne reached Beza and Calvin, and\r\ncalled forth their warm sympathy.[584]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unavailing intercessions.]\r\n\r\nThe best efforts of Beza and Viret were put forth in their behalf. A\r\nlong succession of attempts to secure their release on the part of the\r\ncanton of Berne individually, and of the four Protestant cantons of\r\nSwitzerland collectively, was the result. One letter to Henry received a\r\nhighly encouraging reply. An embassy from Zurich, sent when the king's\r\nword had not been kept, was haughtily informed that Henry expected the\r\ncantons to trouble him no further with the matter, and to avoid\r\ninterfering with the domestic affairs of his country, as he himself\r\nabstained from intermeddling with theirs.[585] Subsequent letters and\r\nembassies to the monarch, intercessions with Cardinal de Tournon,\r\nArchbishop of Lyons, who would appear to have given assurances which he\r\nnever intended to fulfil, and all the other steps dictated by Christian\r\naffection, were similarly fruitless. In fact, nothing protracted the\r\nterm of the imprisonment of the \"Five Scholars\" but the need in which\r\nHenry felt himself to be of retaining the alliance and support of Berne.\r\nYet when, as a final appeal, that powerful canton begged the life of its\r\n\"stipendiaries\" as a \"purely royal and liberal gift, which it would\r\nesteem as great and precious as if his Majesty had presented it an\r\ninestimable sum of silver or gold,\" other political motives prevented\r\nhim from yielding to its entreaties. The fear lest his compliance might\r\nfurnish the emperor and Pope, against whom he was contending, with a\r\nhandle for impugning his devotion to the church, was more powerful than\r\nhis desire to conciliate the Bernese. The Parliament of Paris decreed\r\nthat the death of the \"Five\" by fire should take place on the sixteenth\r\nof May, 1553, and the king refused to interpose his pardon.[586]\r\n\r\nTheir mission to France had not, however, been in vain. It is no\r\nhyperbole of the historian of the reformed churches, when he likens\r\ntheir cells to five _pulpits_, from which the Word of God resounded\r\nthrough the entire city and much farther.[587] The results of their\r\nheroic fortitude, and of the wide dissemination of copies of the\r\nconfession of their Christian faith, were easily traced in the\r\nconversion of many within and without the prison; while the memory of\r\ntheir joyful constancy on their way to the place of execution--which\r\nrather resembled a triumphal than an ignominious procession--and in the\r\nflames, was embalmed in the heart of many a spectator.[588]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Activity of the canton of Berne.]\r\n\r\nThe Bernese were not discouraged by the ill-success of their\r\nintercessions. Three times in the early part of the succeeding year\r\n(1554) they begged, but with no better results, for the release of Paris\r\nPanier, a man learned in the civil law.[589] With equal earnestness they\r\ntook the part of the persecuted reformers against the violence of their\r\nenemies on many successive occasions. It was all in vain. The libertine\r\nking, who saw no merit in the purity of life of the professors of the\r\n\"new doctrines,\" and no mark of Antichrist in the profligacy of Paul the\r\nThird or of Julius the Third, but viewed with horror the permission\r\ngranted by the latter to the faithful of Paris to eat eggs, butter and\r\ncheese during Lent,[590] maintained his more than papal orthodoxy, and\r\nstifled the promptings of a heart by nature not averse to pity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress in Normandy.]\r\n\r\nMore than three years had passed away since the publication of the\r\nEdict of Châteaubriand, but none of the fruits which its authors had\r\npredicted were visible. The number of the reformed brought to trial, and\r\nespecially of those condemned to the flames, gradually diminished,\r\nwhilst it was notorious that the opponents of the dominant church were\r\nrapidly multiplying. In some provinces--in Normandy, for example--their\r\nplacards were mysteriously posted on the walls, and their songs deriding\r\nthe Franciscan monks were sung in the dark lanes of the cities. Once\r\nthey had ventured to interrupt the discourse of a preacher on the topic\r\nof purgatory, by loud expressions of dissent; but when on the next day\r\nthe subject was resumed, numbers of hearers left the church with cries\r\nof \"_au fol, au fol_,\" and forced those who would have arrested them in\r\nthe name of the Cardinal Archbishop of Rouen, to seek refuge from a\r\nshower of stones in an adjoining monastery.[591]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proposal to establish the Spanish Inquisition.]\r\n\r\nThe zealous friends of the church, as well as those who were enriched by\r\nconfiscations, represented to the king that this state of things arose\r\nfrom the fact that the higher magistrates, themselves tainted with\r\nheresy, connived at its spread, and that the \"presidial\" judges\r\nabstained from employing the powers conferred by the edict, through fear\r\nof compromising themselves with the sovereign courts. Nor could\r\necclesiastical courts accomplish much, since the secular judges, to whom\r\nan appeal was open, found means to clear the guilty. They insisted that\r\nthe only remedy was the introduction of the _Inquisition_ in the form in\r\nwhich it had proved so efficacious in Spain and Italy. This, it was\r\nsaid, could be attained by taking away the appeal that had hitherto been\r\nallowed from the decisions of the church courts, and compelling the\r\nnearest secular court to enforce their sentences. It was, furthermore,\r\nproposed to confiscate, for the king's benefit, all the property of\r\nfugitives, disregarding the claims even of those who had purchased from\r\nthem without collusion.[592]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition of parliament.]\r\n\r\nIn secret sessions held at the house of Bertrand, keeper of the seals,\r\nat which were present several of the presidents of parliament known to\r\nbe least friendly to the Reformation, the necessary legislation was\r\nmatured at the instance of the Cardinal of Lorraine.[593] But, when the\r\nedicts establishing the Spanish inquisition were submitted, by order of\r\nthe king, to the Parliament of Paris, it soon became evident that not\r\neven the intrigues of the presidents who were favorable to them could\r\nsecure their registration. In the hope of better success, the edicts\r\nwere for the time withdrawn, and submitted, a few months later, to the\r\npart of parliament that held its sessions in summer,[594] accompanied by\r\nroyal letters strictly enjoining their reception (lettres de jussion).\r\nTwice the _gens du roi_ were heard in favor of the new system, pleading\r\nits necessity, the utility of enlarging the jurisdiction of the church\r\ncourts, especially in the case of apostatizing monks and fanatical\r\npreachers, and the fact that parliament itself had testified that it was\r\nnot averse to an inquisition--not only by recording the edicts of St.\r\nLouis and Philip the Fair, but also by two recent registrations of the\r\npowers of the Inquisitor of the Faith, Matthieu Ory.[595] After many\r\ndelays and a prolonged discussion, parliament decided by a large\r\nmajority that it could not comply with the king's commands, and would\r\nindicate to his Majesty other means of eradicating heresy more\r\nconsistent with the spirit of Christianity.[596]\r\n\r\nThe president, Séguier, and a counsellor (Adrien du Drac) were deputed\r\nto justify before the monarch the course taken by parliament. The royal\r\ncourt was at this time at Villers-Cotterets, not far from Soissons, and\r\nthe commissioners were informed on their arrival that Henry, displeased\r\nand scandalized at the delays of parliament, had begun to suspect it of\r\nbeing badly advised respecting religion and the obedience due to the\r\nchurch. He had said \"that, if twelve judges were necessary to try\r\nLutherans, they could not be found among the members of that body.\" The\r\ndeputies were warned that they must expect to hear harsh words from the\r\nking's lips. Admitted, on the twenty-second of October, into Henry's\r\npresence, President Séguier delivered before the Duke of Guise,\r\nConstable Montmorency, Marshal St. André, and other dignitaries civil\r\nand ecclesiastical, an address full of noble sentiments.[597]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of President Séguier in opposition.]\r\n\r\n\"Parliament,\" said Séguier, \"consists of one hundred and sixty members,\r\nwho, for ability and conscientious discharge of duty, cannot be matched.\r\nI know not any of the number to be alienated from the true faith.\r\nIndeed, no greater misfortune could befall the judicature, than that\r\nthe supreme court should forfeit the confidence of the monarch by whom\r\nits members were appointed. It is not from personal fear that we oppose\r\nthe introduction of the Inquisition. An inquisition, when well\r\nadministered, may not, perhaps, always be injurious. Yet Trajan, an\r\nexcellent emperor, abolished it as against the early Christians,\r\npersecuted as the 'Lutherans' now are; and he preferred to depend upon\r\nthe declarations of those who revealed themselves, rather than to foster\r\nthe spread of the curse of informers and sow fear and distrust in\r\nfamilies. But it is as _magistrates_ that we dread, or rather abhor, the\r\nestablishment of a bloody tribunal, before which denunciation takes the\r\nplace of proof, where the accused is deprived of the natural means of\r\ndefence, and where no judicial forms are observed. We allege nothing of\r\nwhich we cannot furnish recent examples. Many of those whom the agents\r\nof the Inquisition had condemned have appealed to parliament. In\r\nrevising these procedures, we found them so full of absurdities and\r\nfollies, that, if charity forbids our suspecting those who already\r\ndischarge this function among us of dishonesty and malice, it permits\r\nand even bids us deplore their ignorance and presumption. Yet it is to\r\nsuch judges that you are asked, Sire, to deliver over your faithful\r\nsubjects, bound hand and foot, by removing the resource of appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIs it politic, the orator proceeded to ask, for the king to introduce an\r\nedict standing in direct contradiction to that by which he has given to\r\nhis own courts exclusive jurisdiction in the trial of the laity and\r\nsimple clerks, and thus initiate a conflict of laws? Or has the\r\nmonarch--by whose authority, as supreme head of justice, the decisions\r\nof parliament are rendered, whose name stands at the beginning, and\r\nwhose seal is affixed to the termination of every writ--the right to cut\r\noff an appeal to himself, which his subjects, by reason of their paying\r\ntribute, can justly claim in return? Rather let the sovereign remedy be\r\napplied. In order to put an end to heresy, let the pattern of the\r\nprimitive church be observed, which was established not by sword or by\r\nfire, but which, on the contrary, resisted both sword and fire through\r\nlong years of persecution. Yet it endured, and even grew, by the\r\ndoctrine and exemplary life of good prelates and pastors, residing in\r\ntheir charges. At present the prelates are non-residents, and the people\r\nhunger for the Word of God. Now, it is every man's duty to believe the\r\nHoly Scriptures, and to bear testimony to his belief by good works.\r\nWhoever refuses to believe them, and accuses others of being\r\n\"Lutherans,\" is more of a heretic than the \"Lutherans\" themselves.[598]\r\nThe remonstrance of parliament, said Séguier, in fine, is in the\r\ninterest of the poor people and of the courtiers themselves, whom others\r\nmore needy will seek to strip of their possessions by means of the\r\nInquisition and a brace of false witnesses.[599]\r\n\r\nThe speech was listened to with attention by Henry, and its close was\r\napplauded by his courtiers, who appreciated the truth of the warning\r\nconveyed. Two days later the king informed the deputies that he had\r\ndetermined to take the matter into further consideration; and, after\r\ntheir return, not only Henry, but also Guise and Montmorency, sent\r\nletters to parliament in which the mission of Séguier and Du Drac was\r\nreferred to in complimentary terms.[600]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villegagnon sent with Protestant emigrants to Brazil.]\r\n\r\nWhile the influence of the royal court was exerted, in the manner just\r\nindicated, to obtain entrance for the Spanish Inquisition, two events\r\noccurred equally deserving our attention--an attempt at the colonization\r\nof the New World with emigrants of the reformed faith, and the\r\norganization of the first Protestant church in France. Through the\r\ncountenance and under the patronage of an illustrious personage whose\r\nname will, from this time forward, frequently figure on these\r\npages--Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France--a knight of Malta named\r\nVillegagnon, Vice-admiral of Brittany, obtained from Henry \"two large\r\nships of two hundred tons burthen,\" fully equipped and provided with the\r\nrequisite armament, as well as a third vessel carrying provisions.[601]\r\nHaving embarked with a large number of gentlemen, artisans, and sailors,\r\nand having lost some time by being driven back into port to refit after\r\na storm, he at length set sail for America, and anchored in the bay of\r\nRio de Janeiro on the thirteenth of November, 1555. Most of the\r\ncolonists were adherents of the religion at this time violently\r\npersecuted in France; and it is said that Coligny's support had been\r\ngained for the enterprise by the promise, on the part of Villegagnon,\r\nthat in America the reformed should find a safe asylum.[602]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fort Coligny founded.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner, therefore, had the small company effected a lodgment on a\r\nsmall and rocky islet, opposite the present city of Rio de Janeiro, than\r\nVillegagnon conferred on the fort he had erected the name of Coligny,\r\nand wrote to the admiral, as he did subsequently to Calvin, requesting\r\nthat pastors should be sent from Geneva.[603] The petition being\r\ngranted, Pierre Richier and Guillaume Chartier were despatched--the\r\nfirst Protestant ministers to cross the Atlantic. They were received by\r\nthe vice-admiral with extravagant demonstrations of joy. A church was\r\ninstituted on the model of that of Geneva; and Villegagnon recognized\r\nthe validity of its rites by partaking of the holy communion when for\r\nthe first time administered, on the shores of the Western Continent,\r\naccording to the reformed practice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villegagnon becomes an enemy to the Protestants,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and brings ruin to the expedition.]\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, a complete revolution of sentiment and plan was\r\ndisclosed. The pretext was an animated discussion touching the\r\neucharist, between the Protestant pastors, on the one hand, and\r\nVillegagnon, supported by Jean Cointas, a former doctor of the Sorbonne,\r\non the other.[604] The solicitations of the Cardinal of Lorraine,\r\ntogether with a keener appreciation of the danger of harboring the \"new\r\ndoctrines,\" may have been the cause.[605] Chartier was put out of the\r\nway by being sent back to Europe, ostensibly to consult Calvin. Richier\r\nand others were so roughly handled that they were glad to leave the\r\nisland for the continent, and subsequently to return in a leaky vessel\r\nto their native land.[606] But the infant enterprise had received a\r\nfatal blow. Nearly all the deceived Protestants carried home the tidings\r\nof their misfortunes, and deterred others from following their\r\ndisastrous example. Three, remaining in Brazil, were thrown into the sea\r\nby Villegagnon's command. A few suffered martyrdom after the fall of the\r\nintended capital of \"Antarctic France\" into the hands of the Portuguese.\r\nAs to Villegagnon himself, he returned to Europe the virulent enemy of\r\nColigny, and turned his feeble pen to the refutation of\r\nProtestantism.[607]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Protestant church organized in Paris.]\r\n\r\nBut if ruin overtook an enterprise from which French statesmen had\r\nlooked for new power and wealth for their country, and the reformers had\r\nanticipated the rapid advance of their religion in the New World, the\r\nfounding of the first Protestant church in Paris proved a more\r\nauspicious event. More than thirty years had Protestantism been\r\ngradually gaining ground; but, up to the year 1555, it had been wanting\r\nin organization. The tide of persecution had surged too violently over\r\nthe evangelical Christians of the capital to permit them to think of\r\ninstituting a church, with pastors and consistory, after the model\r\nfurnished by the free city of Geneva, or of holding public worship at\r\nstated times and places, or of regularly administering the sacraments.\r\n\"The martyrs,\" says a contemporary writer, \"were, properly speaking, the\r\nonly preachers.\"[608] But now, the courage of the Parisian Protestants\r\nrising with the increased severity of the cruel measures devised\r\nagainst them, they were prepared to accept the idea of organizing\r\nthemselves as an ecclesiastical community. To this a simple incident led\r\nthe way. In the house of a nobleman named La Ferrière, a small body of\r\nProtestants met secretly for the reading of the Scriptures and for\r\nprayer. Their host had left his home in the province of Maine to enjoy,\r\nin the crowded capital, greater immunity from observation than he could\r\nenjoy in his native city, and to avoid the necessity of submitting his\r\nexpected offspring to the rite of baptism as superstitiously observed in\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church. On the birth of his child, he set before the\r\nlittle band of his fellow-believers his reluctance to countenance the\r\ncorruptions of that church, and his inability to go elsewhere in search\r\nof a purer sacrament. He adjured them to meet his exigency and that of\r\nother parents, by the consecration of one of their own number as a\r\nminister. He denounced the anger of the Almighty if they suffered his\r\nchild to die without a participation in the ordinance instituted by the\r\nMaster whom they professed to serve. So earnest an appeal could not be\r\nresisted. After fasting and earnest prayer the choice was made\r\n(September, 1555). John le Maçon, surnamed La Rivière, was a youth of\r\nAngers, twenty-two years of age, who for religion's sake had forsaken\r\nhome, wealth, and brilliant prospects of advancement. He had narrowly\r\nescaped the clutches of the magistrates, to whom his own father, in his\r\nanger, would have given him up. This person was now set apart as the\r\nfirst reformed minister of Paris. A brief constitution for the nascent\r\nchurch was adopted. A consistory of elders and deacons was established.\r\nIn this simple manner were laid the foundations of a church destined to\r\nserve as the prototype of a multitude of others soon to arise in all\r\nparts of France.[609] It was not the least remarkable circumstance\r\nattending its origin, that it arose in the midst of the most hostile\r\npopulace in France, and at a time when the introduction of a new and\r\nmore odious form of inquisition was under serious consideration. Nor can\r\nthe thoughtful student of history regard it in any other light than that\r\nof a Providential interposition in its behalf, that for two years the\r\ninfant church was protected from the fate of extermination that\r\nthreatened it, by the rise of a fresh war between France and Spain--a\r\nwar originating in the perfidy of the Pope and of Henry the Second, the\r\ntwo great enemies of the reformed doctrines in France--and terminating\r\nin a peace ignominious to the royal persecutor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The example followed in the provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fagot still reigns.]\r\n\r\nThe signal given by Paris was welcomed in the provinces. In rapid\r\nsuccession organized churches arose in Meaux, Angers, Poitiers, Bourges,\r\nIssoudun, Aubigny, Blois, Tours, Pau, and Troyes--all within the compass\r\nof two years.[610] The Protestants, thirsting for the preaching of the\r\nWord of God, turned their eyes toward Geneva, Neufchâtel, and Lausanne,\r\nand implored the gift of ministers qualified for the office of\r\ninstruction. Hitherto the awakening of the intellect and heart long\r\nstupefied by superstition had been partial. Now it seemed to be general.\r\nThree months had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the church at\r\nParis, before it was asking of the Swiss reformers a second\r\nminister.[611] A month later, Angers already had a corps of three\r\npastors. \"Entreat the Lord,\" writes the eminent theologian who has left\r\nus these details, \"to advance His kingdom, and to confirm with the\r\nspirit of faith and patience our brethren that are in the very jaws of\r\nthe lion. _Assuredly the tyrant will at length be compelled either to\r\nannihilate entire cities, or to concede someplace for the truth._[612]\"\r\nMeanwhile the fires of persecution blazed high in various parts of\r\nFrance, but produced no sensible impression on the growth of the\r\nReformation.[613]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry II. breaks the truce of Vaucelles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Caraffa.]\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of February, 1556, Henry concluded with Charles the Fifth,\r\nwho had lately abdicated the imperial crown, and with Philip the Second,\r\nhis son, the truce of Vaucelles, which either side swore to observe for\r\nthe space of five years.[614] In the month of July of the same year\r\nHenry broke the truce and openly renewed hostilities. Paul the Fourth,\r\nthe reigning pontiff, was the agent in bringing about this sudden\r\nchange. The inducement held out to Henry was the prospect of the\r\ninvestiture of the duchy of Milan and the kingdom of Naples; and Paul\r\nreadily agreed to absolve the French monarch from the oath which he had\r\nso solemnly taken only five months before. Constable Montmorency and his\r\nnephew, Admiral Coligny, opposed the act of perfidy; but it was\r\nadvocated by the Duke of Guise, by the Cardinal of Lorraine, and by one\r\nwhose seductive entreaties were more implicitly obeyed than those of all\r\nothers--the dissolute Diana of Poitiers.[615] And the negotiation had\r\nbeen intrusted to skilful hands.[616] Cardinal Caraffa, the pontiff's\r\nnephew, was surpassed in intrigue by no other member of the Sacred\r\nCollege. No conscientious scruples interfered with the discharge of his\r\ncommission. For Caraffa was at heart an unbeliever. As his hand was\r\nreverently raised to pronounce upon the crowds gathered to witness his\r\nentry into Paris the customary benediction in the name of the triune\r\nGod, and his lips were seen to move, there were those near his person,\r\nit is said, that caught the ribald words which were really uttered\r\ninstead: \"Let us deceive this people, since it wishes to be\r\ndeceived.\"[617]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fresh projects to introduce the Spanish Inquisition.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry's letter to the Pope.]\r\n\r\nIt was fitting that to such a legate should be committed the task of\r\nmaking a fresh effort to introduce the Spanish Inquisition into France.\r\nThe Cardinal of Lorraine had been absent in Italy the year before, when\r\nthe first attempt failed through the resolute resistance of parliament.\r\nHe was now present to lend his active co-operation. Yet with all his\r\nexertions the king could not silence the opposition of the judges,[618]\r\nand was finally induced to defer a third attempt until the year 1557,\r\nand to give a different form to the undertaking. In the month of\r\nFebruary of this year, Henry applied to the Pontiff, begging him to\r\nappoint, by Apostolic brief, a commission of cardinals or other\r\nprelates, who \"_might proceed to the introduction of the said\r\ninquisition_ in the lawful and accustomed form and manner, under the\r\nauthority of the Apostolic See, and with the invocation of the secular\r\narm and temporal jurisdiction.\" He promised, on his part, to give the\r\nmatter his most lively attention, \"_since he desired nothing in this\r\nworld so much as to see his people delivered from so dangerous a\r\npestilence as this accursed heresy_.\"[619] And he solicited the greatest\r\nexpedition on the part of the Pope, for it was an affair that demanded\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The papal bull.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The three inquisitors-general.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Odet, Cardinal of Châtillon.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Protestant proclivities.]\r\n\r\nPaul, who was in the constant habit of saying that the inquisition was\r\nthe sole weapon suited to the Holy See, the only battering-ram by means\r\nof which heresy could be demolished,[620] did not decline the royal\r\ninvitation. On the twenty-sixth of April he published a bull appointing\r\na commission consisting of the Cardinals of Lorraine, Bourbon, and\r\nChâtillon, with power to delegate their authority to others. Of the\r\nthree prelates, the first was the real instigator of the cruelties\r\npractised during this and the subsequent reigns. The Cardinal of Bourbon\r\nwas known to be as ignorant as he was inimical to the Reformation, and\r\ncould be depended upon to support his colleague. The Cardinal of\r\nChâtillon, brother of Admiral Coligny and of D'Andelot, was added, it is\r\nnot improbable, from motives of policy. He was already suspected of\r\nfavoring the reformed doctrines, which subsequently he openly espoused.\r\nIndeed, nearly six years before, the English ambassador, Pickering,\r\nafter alluding to new measures of persecution devised against the\r\nProtestants, wrote: \"Cardinal Châtillon, as I hear, is a great aider of\r\nLutherans, and hath been a great stay in this matter, which otherwise\r\nhad been before now concluded, to the destruction of any man that had\r\nalmost spoken of God's Word. Nevertheless, the Protestants here fear\r\nthat it cannot come to a much better end, where such a number of bishops\r\nand cardinals bear the swing.\"[621] Châtillon's enemies hoped, by\r\nplacing him on this inquisitorial commission, where his vote would be\r\npowerless in opposition to that of the other two cardinals, to compel\r\nhim either to enter the rank of persecutors, or declare himself openly\r\nfor the Reformation, and thus destroy his own credit and that of his\r\npowerful family.[622]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bull confirmed by Henry II.]\r\n\r\nThe papal bull was promptly confirmed by the king, who, in a declaration\r\ngiven at Compiègne, on the twenty-fourth of July, 1557, permitted \"his\r\nvery dear cousins,\" the three cardinals, to exercise the office of\r\ninquisitors-general throughout the monarchy. From sentences given by\r\ntheir subalterns, this document permitted an appeal to be taken, but it\r\nwas to a body appointed for the purpose by the inquisitors\r\nthemselves.[623] Parliament, however, again interposed the prerogative\r\nit had assumed, of remonstrance and delay, and the king's declaration,\r\nas well as the papal bull, remained inoperative.[624]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judicial sympathy with the victims.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Compiègne, July 24, 1557.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, perhaps, that the institution of the sacred\r\noffice, with its bloody code and relentless tribunal, was pressed so\r\nrepeatedly upon the French monarch and parliament for their acceptance.\r\nThe number of the Protestants was not only increasing in a most alarming\r\nmanner,[625] but the very judges before whom, when discovered, the\r\nProtestants were brought, began to show signs of compassion, if not of\r\nsympathy. So it happened that, in one provincial town, two persons\r\ncaught with the packages of \"Lutheran\" books they had brought into\r\nFrance, after they had made an explicit confession of their faith, were\r\ncondemned, not to the flames, but to the trifling punishment of public\r\nwhipping; and scarcely had the blows begun to fall upon the backs of the\r\npedlers, when some of the magistrates themselves threw their cloaks\r\naround the culprits, whose confiscated books were afterward secretly\r\nreturned to them, or bought and paid for.[626] To such a formidable\r\nheight had this irregularity grown, that, on the very day upon which the\r\nconfirmation of the three proposed inquisitors-general was made, Henry\r\npublished a new edict (at Compiègne, on the twenty-fourth of July, 1557)\r\nintended to secure an adherence to the penalties prescribed by previous\r\nlaws. The reader of this edict, remembering the frequency with which the\r\n_estrapade_ had done its bloody work for the last quarter of a century,\r\nwill not be astonished to read that the punishment of death is affixed\r\nto the secret or public profession of any other religion than the Roman\r\nCatholic. But he will rejoice, for the sake of our common humanity, to\r\nlearn that \"it very frequently happens that our said judges are moved\r\nwith pity by _the holy and malicious words_ of those found guilty of the\r\nsaid crimes;\" and that, to secure the uniform infliction of the extreme\r\npenalty upon the professors of the reformed faith, it was now necessary\r\nfor the king to remove from the judges the slightest pretext or\r\nauthority for mitigating the sentence that condemned a Protestant to the\r\nflames or gallows.[627]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of St. Quentin, Aug. 10, 1557.]\r\n\r\nUnder cover of the war during three years, Protestantism made rapid\r\nstrides in France. But the contest itself was disastrous to its\r\noriginators. The constable, having, when hostilities had once been\r\nundertaken contrary to his advice, been unwilling to resign the chief\r\ncommand to which his office entitled him, assumed the defence of Paris\r\nfrom the north, while to his younger rival in arms, the Duke of Guise,\r\nwas assigned the more brilliant part in the enterprise--the conquest of\r\nthe kingdom of Naples. Montmorency's success, however, fell far short of\r\nthe reputation he enjoyed for consummate generalship. Not only did he\r\nfail to relieve his nephews Coligny and D'Andelot, who had shut\r\nthemselves up with a handful of men in the fortress of St. Quentin; but\r\nhe himself (on the tenth of August, 1557) met with a signal defeat in\r\nwhich the flower of the French army was routed, and many of its leaders,\r\nincluding the constable himself, were taken prisoners.[628]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rage against the \"Lutherans.\"]\r\n\r\nThe French capital was thrown into a paroxysm of fear on receipt of the\r\nintelligence. The road to Paris lay open to the victorious army. The\r\nking, not less than the people, expected to hear the Spaniards within a\r\nfew brief days thundering at the very gates of the city. Charles the\r\nFifth, from his retirement at Yuste, is said to have asked the courier\r\nwith impatience, whether his son was already in Paris.[629] In the minds\r\nof the populace, disappointment and fear were mingled with rage against\r\n\"the accursed sect of the Lutherans\"--the reputed authors of all the\r\npublic calamities. Every prediction which the priests had for a\r\ngeneration been ringing in the ears of the people seemed now to be in\r\ncourse of fulfilment. In the startling defeat of a large and\r\nwell-appointed army of France, led by an experienced general, all eyes\r\nread tokens of the evident displeasure of the Almighty, not because of\r\nthe ignorance and immorality of the people, or the bad doctrine and\r\nworse lives of its spiritual leaders, or the barbarous cruelty, the\r\nshameless impurity, and unexampled bad faith of the court; but because\r\nof the existence of heretics who denied the authority of the Pope, and\r\nrefused to bow down and worship the transubstantiated wafer. The popular\r\nanger was the more ready to kindle because the harsh measures of the\r\ngovernment had confessedly failed of accomplishing their object, and\r\nbecause--to use the expressive language of the royal edict--the fire\r\nstill burned beneath the ashes.[630] An incident which happened little\r\nmore than a fortnight after the battle of St. Quentin disclosed the\r\nbitter fruits of the slanderous reports and violent teachings\r\ndisseminated among the excitable inhabitants of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The affair of the Rue St. Jacques, Sept. 4, 1557.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault upon the worshippers.]\r\n\r\nThe Protestants of the capital, far from rejoicing over the misfortunes\r\nof the kingdom, as their adversaries falsely asserted, met even more\r\nfrequently than before to offer their united prayers in its behalf. On\r\nthe evening of the fourth of September, 1557,[631] three or four hundred\r\npersons, of every rank of society, quietly repaired to a house in the\r\nRue St. Jacques, almost under the very shadow of the Sorbonne, where the\r\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper was to be administered according to\r\nprevious appointment. Their coming together had not been so noiseless,\r\nhowever, as to escape the attention of some priests, residing in the\r\nCollége du Plessis, on the other side of the way, whose suspicions had\r\nfor some time been fixed upon the spot.[632] The reformed were not\r\ndisturbed during the exercise of their worship. But when, toward\r\nmidnight, they prepared to return to their homes, the fury of their\r\nenemies discharged upon them the full force of its pent-up energies. A\r\nfanatical crowd blocked the street or filled the opposite windows, ready\r\nto overwhelm with a shower of stones and missiles of all descriptions\r\nany that might leave the protection of the house. Continual accessions\r\nwere made of those whom the cries of \"Thieves!\" \"Robbers!\" \"Conspirators\r\nagainst the realm!\" attracted to the place. The discovery of the fact\r\nthat it was a company not of robbers, but of \"Lutherans,\" only inflamed\r\nthe rage of the new-comers. The cry was now for blood. Every avenue of\r\nescape was guarded, and bonfires lighted here and there dispelled the\r\nfriendly darkness. Carts and wagons were drawn across the streets, and\r\narmed men occupied the street-corners, or, if too cowardly to expose\r\nthemselves to any danger, stood ready at doors and windows to thrust the\r\nfugitives through with their pikes.\r\n\r\nThe assembled Protestants, awakened to their danger, at first expected a\r\ngeneral massacre. But the exhortations of their pastors and elders gave\r\nthem new courage. In the midst of the storm raging without, they betook\r\nthemselves to prayer. At length the necessity was recognized of coming\r\nto a prompt decision. To await the coming of the civil authorities, for\r\nwhom their enemies had sent, was to give themselves up to certain death.\r\nNothing remained but to force their way out--a course recommended, we\r\nare told, by those who knew the cowardice of a Parisian mob. The men who\r\nwere provided with swords were placed in the front rank, the unarmed\r\nfollowed in their wake. Again and again small companies issued into the\r\nstreet and faced the angry storm. Each successive company reached a safe\r\nrefuge. In fact, of all that adopted the bolder course of action, only\r\none person was knocked down and left upon the ground to be brutally\r\nmurdered and suffer the most shameful indignities. There were, however,\r\nmany--one hundred and twenty or more women and children, with a few\r\nmen--whom fear prevented from following the example of their companions.\r\nAround them the rabble, balked of the greater part of its expected\r\nvictims, raged with increased fury. At one moment they presented\r\nthemselves at the windows to the view of their enemies, in the vain hope\r\nthat the sight of so much innocence and helplessness would secure\r\ncompassion. When only blind hatred and malice were exhibited in return,\r\nthey withdrew and quietly awaited the fate which they believed to be in\r\nstore for them at the hands of the mob. From this they were delivered by\r\nthe sudden arrival of Martine, the king's \"procureur\" belonging to the\r\nChâtelet, with a strong detachment of commissaries and sergeants.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty restraining the impetuosity of the mob, the\r\nmagistrate made on the very spot an examination into the services that\r\nhad been held. The whole story was told him in simple terms. He found\r\nthat, while the Protestants had been assembling, the Scriptures had for\r\na long time been read in the French language. The minister had next\r\noffered prayer, the whole company kneeling upon the floor. He had\r\nafterward set forth the institution of the holy supper as given by St.\r\nPaul, had exhibited its true utility and how it ought to be approached,\r\nand had debarred from the communion all seditious, disobedient, impure,\r\nand other unworthy participants, forbidding them to come near to the\r\nsacred table. Then those who had been deemed to be in a fit frame to\r\nreceive the sacrament had presented themselves, and received the bread\r\nand the wine from the hands of the ministers, with the words: \"This is\r\nthe communion of the body and blood of the Lord.\" Prayers had followed\r\nfor the king and the prosperity of his kingdom, for all the poor in\r\ntheir affliction, and for the church in general. The services had closed\r\nwith the singing of several psalms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of the prisoners.]\r\n\r\nSo clear a confession was amply sufficient to justify the arrest of the\r\nentire company. Men, women, and children were dragged at early dawn to\r\nthe prison. But their escort was too small, or too indifferent, to\r\nafford protection from the insults and violence of the immense throng\r\nthrough the midst of which they passed.[633] Not content with applying\r\nalike to men and to women the most opprobrious epithets, the rabble tore\r\ntheir clothing, covered them with mud and filth, and dealt many a\r\nblow--especially to those who from their long robes or age were\r\nsuspected of being preachers.[634] Into these outrages no judicial\r\ninvestigation was ever instituted, so prevalent was the persuasion that\r\nthe zeal of the people in defence of the established faith must not be\r\ntoo narrowly watched.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Malicious rumors.]\r\n\r\nThe blame for these excesses must not, however, be laid exclusively to\r\nthe account of the populace. There were rumors afloat that owed their\r\norigin to the deliberate and malicious invention of the better\r\ninstructed, and that were firmly believed by the ignorant masses. The\r\nnocturnal meetings, to which the Protestants were driven by persecution,\r\nwere represented as devoted to the most abominable orgies. The\r\nProtestants were accused of eating little children. It was boldly stated\r\nthat a luxurious banquet was spread, and that at its conclusion the\r\ncandles were extinguished, and a scene of the most indiscriminate\r\nlewdness ensued.[635] One of the judges of the tribunal of the Châtelet\r\nwas found sufficiently pliant to declare, in contradiction to the\r\nunanimous testimony of the accused, that preparations for the repetition\r\nof similar crimes had been discovered in the rooms of the house in the\r\nrue St. Jacques, where the Protestants had been surprised. These\r\ninfamous accusations even found their way into print, and were\r\ndisseminated far and wide by the priestly party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trials and executions.]\r\n\r\nWhile the poor prisoners were confined in the most loathsome\r\ncells--highwaymen and murderers being removed to better quarters to make\r\nroom for Christians[636]--a judicial investigation was set on foot. The\r\nking himself expedited the trials.[637] Within little more than three\r\nweeks from the time of their apprehension, three Protestants were put to\r\ndeath (on the twenty-seventh of September). Both sexes and the extremes\r\nof youth and old age were represented in these victims. To one, a\r\nbeautiful young lady of wealth and rank, barely twenty-three years old,\r\nthe favor was granted of being strangled before her body was consigned\r\nto the flames. Yet even in her case the cruel executioner had not\r\nabstained from first applying a firebrand wantonly and indecently to\r\ndifferent parts of her person.[638] Her companions were burned alive.\r\nOne of them was an advocate in parliament; both were elders of the\r\nreformed church. Five days later a physician and a solicitor met the\r\nsame fate, but endured greater sufferings, as the wind blew the flames\r\nfrom beneath them, prolonging their torture; and these were quickly\r\nfollowed by two students at Paris, both of them from the southern part\r\nof the realm (on the twenty-third of October).[639]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intercession of the Swiss cantons and others.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin's interest.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wretched prisoners were not deserted by their brethren.\r\nTheir innocence of the dreadful crimes laid to their charge was\r\nmaintained in pamphlets, which showed that these accusations were but\r\nrepetitions of slanders invented by the heathen to overwhelm the early\r\nChristians. Their doctrinal orthodoxy was proved by citations from the\r\nearly church fathers.[640] The Protestants of Paris found means to\r\nintroduce a long remonstrance into the very chamber of the king.\r\nUnfortunately, it had as little influence upon him as similar\r\nproductions had had with his predecessor. In Switzerland and in a\r\nportion of Germany the tidings made a deep impression. Less than two\r\nweeks after the blow had been struck at the small community of Parisian\r\nProtestants, Calvin wrote the first of a series of letters calculated to\r\nsustain their drooping courage, and suggested some of the wise ends\r\nProvidence might have in view in permitting so severe a discipline.[641]\r\nMeantime he applied himself vigorously to arouse in their behalf an\r\neffective intervention. \"My good brethren,\" he wrote to the people of\r\nLausanne, \"though all the rest should not suffice to move the hearts of\r\nthose brethren to whom an appeal is made, yet this emergency admits of\r\nno delay. It can scarcely be but that, amid so many tortures, first one\r\nand then another be involved in them, until the number of sufferers\r\nbecome an infinite one. In short, the whole kingdom will be in flames.\r\nThe question no longer is how to satisfy the desire of the poor\r\nbrethren, but, if we have a single spark of humanity within us, to\r\nsuccor them in such extremity.... Though money be not promptly obtained\r\nelsewhere, yet shall I make such efforts, should I be obliged to pledge\r\nmy head and my feet, that it be forthcoming here.\"[642]\r\n\r\nBeza, with his associates, Carmel, Farel, and Budé, at the same time, by\r\nCalvin's request, took active steps to induce the Protestant cantons and\r\nprinces to intercede with Henry, and their exertions were not in\r\nvain.[643] It was the object of the reformers to enlist the intervention\r\nof those Protestant powers, in particular, whose alliance and assistance\r\nmight be deemed indispensable by the French king in his present\r\nstraits.[644] The four \"evangelical\" Swiss cantons, encouraged by the\r\nsuccess of a recent mission in behalf of the Waldenses of Piedmont, sent\r\nto Paris a deputation, whose appearance was greeted by the Protestants\r\nwith the utmost joy. The ambassadors, however, allowed themselves to be\r\ncajoled and deceived by the Cardinal of Lorraine, to whom they had the\r\nimprudence to intrust their petition. In reply to their address to the\r\nking, they were told (on the fifth of November), in the name of his\r\nMajesty, that he invited the confederates in future to trouble\r\nthemselves no further with the internal affairs of his kingdom,\r\nespecially in matters of religion, since he was resolved to follow in\r\nthe steps of his predecessors.[645] Discouraged by this rebuff, they\r\ndid not even attempt to press the matter upon the king's notice, or by a\r\npersonal interview endeavor to mitigate his anger against their\r\nbrethren. It had been better never to have engaged in the intercession\r\nthan support it so weakly.[646] The German princes could not be induced\r\nto give to the affair the consideration it merited; but a letter of the\r\nCount Palatine seems to have somewhat diminished the violence of the\r\npersecution.[647]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constancy of most of the prisoners.]\r\n\r\nThe constancy of the victims, by disconcerting the plans of their\r\nenemies, doubtless contributed much to the temporary lull. No one\r\nattracted in this respect greater attention than the most illustrious\r\nperson among the prisoners--the daughter of the Seigneur de Rambouillet\r\nand wife of De Rentigny, standard-bearer of the Duke of Guise--who\r\nresolutely rejected the pardon, based on a renunciation of her faith,\r\nwhich her father and husband brought her from the king, and urged her\r\nwith tears to accept.[648] Others, who, on account of their youth, were\r\nexpected to be but poor advocates of their doctrinal views, proved more\r\nthan a match for their examiners. The course was finally adopted of\r\ndistributing the prisoners, about one hundred in number, in various\r\nmonastic establishments, whose inmates might win them back to the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, whether by argument or by harsher means. The judges\r\ncould thus rid themselves of the irksome task of lighting new fires, and\r\nthe energies of the religious orders were put to some account. But the\r\nresult hardly met the expectations formed. If a few Protestants obtained\r\ntheir liberty, and incurred the censures of their brethren, by unworthy\r\nconfessions of principle,[649] many more were allowed to escape by the\r\nmonks, who soon had reason to desire \"that their cloisters might be\r\npurged of such pests, through fear lest the contagion should spread\r\nfarther,\" and found it \"burdensome to support without compensation so\r\nlarge a number of needy persons.\"[650]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Controversial pamphlets.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Protestants were thus demonstrating, by the fortitude with\r\nwhich they encountered severe suffering and even death, the sincerity of\r\ntheir convictions and the purity of their lives, their enemies were\r\nunremitting in exertions to aggravate the odium in which they were held\r\nby the people. An inquisitor and doctor of the Sorbonne, the notorious\r\nDe Mouchy, or Demochares, as he called himself, wrote a pamphlet to\r\nprove them heretics by the decisions of the doctors. A bishop found the\r\nsigns of the true church in the _bells_ at the sound of which the\r\nCatholics assembled, and marks of Antichrist in the _pistols_ and\r\n_arquebuses_ whose discharge was said to be the signal for the gathering\r\nof the heretics. A third controversialist went so far as to accuse the\r\nProtestants not only of impurity, but of denying the divinity of Christ,\r\nthe immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body, and even the\r\nexistence of God.[651]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Calais, January, 1558.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, public affairs assumed a more encouraging aspect. Francis of\r\nGuise, recalled from Italy, where his ill-success had been the salvation\r\nof the poor Waldenses in their Alpine valleys,[652] had assumed command\r\nof a large force, consisting partly of the troops he had taken to Italy,\r\npartly of noblemen and gentlemen that flocked to his standard in answer\r\nto the king's summons for the defence of the French capital. With this\r\narmy he succeeded in capturing, in the beginning of January, 1558, the\r\ncity of Calais, for two hundred years an English possession.[653] The\r\nachievement was not a difficult one. The fortifications had been\r\nsuffered to go to ruin, and the small garrison was utterly insufficient\r\nto resist the force unexpectedly sent against it.[654] But the success\r\nraised still higher the pride of the Guises.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Registry of the inquisition edict.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine of Navarre, Condé, and other princes favor the\r\nReformation.]\r\n\r\nThe auspicious moment was seized by the Cardinal of Lorraine to induce\r\nHenry, on the ninth of January, to hold in parliament a _lit de\r\njustice_, and compel the court to register in his presence the obnoxious\r\nedict of the previous year, establishing the _inquisition_.[655] But the\r\nengine which had been esteemed both by Pope and king the only sure\r\nmeans of repressing heresy, failed of its end. New churches arose; those\r\nthat previously existed rapidly grew.[656] The Reformation, also, now,\r\nfor the first time, was openly avowed by men of the first rank in the\r\nkingdom. Its opponents were filled with dismay upon beholding Antoine de\r\nBourbon, King of Navarre, his brother Louis, Prince of Condé, and\r\nFrançois d'Andelot, brother of Admiral Coligny, at the head of the\r\nhitherto despised \"Lutherans.\" Antoine de Bourbon-Vendôme was, next to\r\nthe reigning monarch and his children, the first prince of the blood.\r\nSince his marriage with Jeanne d'Albret--in consequence of which he\r\nbecame titular King of Navarre--he had resided for much of the time in\r\nthe city of Pan, where his more illustrious son, Henry the Fourth, was\r\nborn. Here he had attended the preaching of Protestant ministers. On his\r\nreturn to court, not long after the capture of Calais, he took the\r\ndecided step of frequenting the gatherings of the Parisian Protestants.\r\nSubsequently he rescued a prominent minister--Antoine de Chandieu--from\r\nthe Châtelet, in which he was imprisoned, by going in person and\r\nclaiming him as a member of his household.[657] Well would it have been\r\nfor France had the Navarrese king always displayed the same courage.\r\nCondé and D'Andelot were scarcely less valuable accessions to the ranks\r\nof the Protestants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embassy from the Protestant Electors of Germany.]\r\n\r\nOther causes contributed to delay the full execution of the plan of the\r\nInquisition. A united embassy from the three Protestant Electors of\r\nGermany--the Count Palatine, the Duke of Saxony, and the Marquis of\r\nBrandenburg--and from the Dukes of Deux Ponts and Wurtemberg, bearing a\r\npowerful appeal to Henry in behalf of his persecuted subjects, arrived\r\nin Paris.[658] Such noble and influential petitioners could not be\r\ndismissed--especially at a time when their assistance was\r\nindispensable--without a gracious reply;[659] and, in order that the\r\nGerman princes might not have occasion to accuse Henry of too flagrant\r\nbad faith, the persecution was allowed for a short time to abate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Psalm-singing on the Pré aux Clercs.]\r\n\r\nAn incident of an apparently trivial character, which happened at Paris\r\nnot long after, proved very clearly that the severities inflicted on\r\nsome of those connected with the meeting in the Rue St. Jacques had\r\nutterly failed of accomplishing their object. On the southern side of\r\nthe Seine, opposite the Louvre, there stretched, just outside of the\r\ncity walls, a large open space--the public grounds of the university,\r\nknown as the _Pré aux Clercs_.[660] This spot was the favorite promenade\r\nof the higher classes of the Parisians. It happened that, on a certain\r\nafternoon in May,[661] a few voices in the crowd began to sing one of\r\nthe psalms which Clément Marot and Théodore de Bèze had translated into\r\nFrench. At the sound the walks and games were forsaken. The tune was\r\nquickly caught up, and soon the vast concourse joining in the words,\r\neither through sympathy or through love of novelty, the curious were\r\nattracted from all quarters to listen to so strange an entertainment.\r\nFor many successive evenings the same performance was repeated. The\r\nnumbers increased, it was said, to five or six thousand. Many of the\r\nchief personages of the kingdom were to be seen among those who took\r\npart. The King and Queen of Navarre were particularly noticed because\r\nof the pleasure they manifested. By the inmates of the neighboring\r\nCollege of the Sorbonne the demonstration was interpreted as an open\r\navowal of heresy. The use of the French language in devotional singing\r\nwas calculated to throw contempt upon the time-honored usage of\r\nperforming divine service in the Latin tongue.[662] To the king, at this\r\ntime absent from the city, the psalm-singing was represented as a\r\nbeginning of sedition, which must be suppressed lest it should lead to\r\nthe destruction at once of his faith and of his authority. Henry, too\r\nready a listener to such suggestions, ordered the irregularity to cease;\r\nand the Protestant ministers and elders of Paris, desirous of giving an\r\nexample of obedience to the civil power in things indifferent, enjoined\r\non their members to desist from singing the psalms elsewhere than in\r\ntheir own homes.[663]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conference of Cardinals Lorraine and Granvelle.]\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Dowager Duchess of Lorraine, who was permitted to meet\r\nher son upon the borders of France, afforded a good opportunity for an\r\ninformal discussion of the terms of the peace that was to put an end to\r\na war of which both parties were equally tired. There, in the fortress\r\nof Peronne, the Cardinal of Lorraine held a conference with Antoine\r\nPerrenot, Cardinal of Granvelle; and a friendship was cemented between\r\nthe former and the Spanish court boding no good for the quiet of France\r\nor the stability of the throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Andelot, Coligny's younger brother, denounced.]\r\n\r\nLittle was effected in the direction of peace. But Cardinal Lorraine\r\nreceived valuable hints touching the best method for humbling the\r\nenemies of his house. Of these no one was more formidable than\r\nD'Andelot, who had distinguished himself greatly in the war on the\r\nFlemish borders. This young nobleman, the Bishop of Arras affirmed, had\r\nbeen found, during the captivity from which he had recently escaped, to\r\nbe infected with the contagion of the \"new doctrines.\" Since his return\r\nto France, he had even ventured to send a heretical volume to console\r\nhis brother, the admiral, in prison. The cardinal, jealous of the houses\r\nof Châtillon and Montmorency, promptly reported to the king the story of\r\nD'Andelot's defection from the faith. His brother, the Duke of Guise,\r\nloudly declared that, although he was ready to march to the siege of\r\nThionville, he could entertain no hope of success if D'Andelot were\r\nsuffered to accompany him, in command of the French infantry.[664]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Andelot in Brittany.]\r\n\r\nThe sympathy of the younger Châtillon was daily becoming more openly\r\navowed. On a recent visit to Brittany (April, 1558), he had taken with\r\nhim Fleury and Loiseleur, Protestant ministers. For the first time, the\r\nwesternmost province of France heard the doctrines preached a generation\r\nbefore in Meaux. The crowd of provincial nobles, flocking to pay their\r\nrespects to D'Andelot and his wife, Claude de Rieux, heiress of vast\r\nestates in this region, were both surprised and gratified at enjoying\r\nthe opportunity of listening to preachers whose voice had penetrated to\r\nalmost every nook of France save this. So palpable were the effects,\r\nthat D'Andelot's brief tour in Brittany furnished additional grounds for\r\nHenry's suspicions respecting the young nobleman's soundness in the\r\nfaith.[665]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Andelot summoned to appear before the king.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His manly defence.]\r\n\r\nD'Andelot was summoned to appear before the king and clear himself of\r\nthe charges preferred against him. Henry is said, indeed, to have sent\r\npreviously D'Andelot's brother, the Cardinal of Châtillon, and his\r\ncousin, Marshal Montmorency, the constable's eldest son, to urge him to\r\nmake a submissive and satisfactory explanation. But their exertions were\r\nfutile. Henry began the conversation by reminding D'Andelot of the great\r\nintimacy he had always allowed him and the love he bore him. He told him\r\nthat he had expected of him anything rather than a revolt from the\r\nreligion of his prince and an adherence to new doctrines. And he\r\nannounced as the principal points in his conduct which he condemned,\r\nthat he had allowed the \"Lutheran\" views to be preached on his estates,\r\nthat he had frequented the _Pré aux Clercs_, that he absented himself\r\nfrom the mass, and that he had sent \"books from Geneva\" to his brother,\r\nthe admiral, in his captivity. D'Andelot replied with frankness and\r\nintrepidity. He professed gratitude for the many favors he had received\r\nfrom the monarch, a gratitude he had never tired of making known by\r\nperilling life and property in that prince's cause. But the doctrine he\r\nhad caused to be preached was good and holy, and such as his forefathers\r\nhad held. He denied having been at the _Pré aux Clercs_, but avowed his\r\nentire approval of the service of praise in which the multitude had\r\nthere engaged. As for his absence from the mass, he thanked God for\r\nremoving the veil of ignorance that once covered his eyes, and declared\r\nthat, with the Almighty's favor, he would never again be present at its\r\ncelebration. In fine, he begged Henry to regard his life and property as\r\nbeing entirely at the royal disposition, but to leave him a free\r\nconscience. The Cardinal of Lorraine, who alone of the courtiers was\r\npresent, here interposed to warn the speaker of the bad way into which\r\nhe had entered; but D'Andelot replied by appealing to the prelate's own\r\nconscience in testimony of the truth of the doctrines he had once\r\nfavored, but now, from ambitious motives, persecuted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry orders him to be imprisoned.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embarrassment of the court.]\r\n\r\nGreatly displeased with so frank an avowal of sentiments that would have\r\ncost one less nobly connected his life, Henry now pointed to the collar\r\nof the \"Order of St. Michael\" around D'Andelot's neck, and exclaimed: \"I\r\ndid not give you this order to be so employed; for you swore to attend\r\nmass and to follow my religion.\" \"I knew not what it is to be a\r\nChristian,\" responded D'Andelot; \"nor, had God then touched my heart as\r\nHe now has, should I have accepted it on such a condition.\"[666] Unable\r\nany longer to endure the boldness of D'Andelot--who richly deserved the\r\ntitle he popularly bore, _the fearless knight_[667]--Henry angrily\r\ncommanded him to leave his presence. The young man was arrested and\r\ntaken by the archers of the guard to Meaux, whence he was subsequently\r\nremoved to Melun.[668] The position of the court was, however, an\r\nembarrassing one. Henry manifested no desire to retain long as a\r\nprisoner, much less to bring to the _estrapade_, the nephew of the\r\nconstable, and a warrior who had himself held the honorable post of\r\nColonel-General of the French infantry, and was second to none in\r\nreputation for valor and skill. The most trifling concession would be\r\nsufficient to secure the scion of the powerful families of Châtillon and\r\nMontmorency. Even this concession, however, could not for a considerable\r\ntime be gained. D'Andelot resisted every temptation, and his\r\ncorrespondence breathed the most uncompromising determination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Andelot's constancy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His temporary weakness.]\r\n\r\nIn a long and admirable letter to Henry, it is true, he humbly asked\r\npardon for the offence his words had given. And he begged the king to\r\nbelieve that, \"save in the matter of obedience to God and of\r\nconscience,\" he would ever faithfully expose life and means to fulfil\r\nthe royal commands. But he also reiterated his inability to attend the\r\nmass, and plainly denounced as blasphemy the approval of any other\r\nsacrifice than that made upon the Cross.[669] To the ministers of Paris\r\nhe wrote, expressing a resolution equally strong; and the letters of the\r\nlatter, as well as of the great Genevese reformer, were well calculated\r\nto sustain his courage. But D'Andelot was not proof against the\r\nsophistries of Ruzé, a doctor of the Sorbonne and confessor of the king.\r\nMoved by the entreaties of his wife,[670] of his uncle the constable,\r\nand of his brother the Cardinal of Châtillon, he was induced, after two\r\nmonths of imprisonment, to consent to be present, but without taking any\r\npart, at a celebration of the mass. By the same priest D'Andelot sent a\r\nsubmissive message to the king, to which the bearer, we have reason to\r\nbelieve, attributed a meaning quite different from that which D'Andelot\r\nhad intended to convey. The noble prisoner was at once released; but the\r\nvoice of conscience, uniting with that of his faithful friends, soon led\r\nhim to repent bitterly of his temporary, but scandalous weakness. From\r\nthis time forward he resumes the character of the intrepid defender of\r\nthe Protestant doctrines--a character of which he never again divests\r\nhimself.[671]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bloody decemvirate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anxiety for peace.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Henry and his adviser, the Cardinal of Lorraine, who really\r\nlittle deserved the reproaches showered on them by the Pope, took steps\r\nto encounter the new assaults which the reformed doctrines were making\r\non the established church in every quarter of the kingdom. If the\r\nParliament of Paris began to exhibit reluctance to shed more innocent\r\nblood, it was far otherwise with the decemvirate to whom the three\r\ncardinals had delegated their inquisitorial functions, and whose power\r\nwas supreme.[672] But, to the prosecution of the work of exterminating\r\nheresy in France, the continuance of the war with Spain offered\r\ninsurmountable obstacles. It diverted the attention of the government\r\nfrom the multiplication of \"Lutheran\" churches and communities. It\r\nhampered the court, by compelling it to mitigate its severities, in\r\nconsequence of the importunate intercessions of its indispensable\r\nallies, the Protestant princes across the Rhine and the confederated\r\ncantons of Switzerland. Besides, the war had borne no fruit but\r\ndisappointment. If Calais had been recovered, St. Quentin and other\r\nstrongholds, which were the key to Paris, had been lost. The brilliant\r\ncapture of Thionville (on the twenty-second of June, 1558) had been more\r\nthan balanced by the disastrous rout of Marshal de Thermes at Gravelines\r\n(on the thirteenth of July).[673]\r\n\r\nThe almost uninterrupted hostilities of the last twelve years had not\r\nonly exhausted the few thousand crowns which Henry had found in the\r\ntreasury at his accession to the throne, but had reduced the French\r\nexchequer to as low an ebb as that of the Spanish king.[674] His\r\nantagonist was as anxious as Henry to reduce his expenditures, and\r\nobtain leisure for crushing heresy in the Low Countries and wherever\r\nelse it had shown itself in his vast dominions. Constable Montmorency,\r\ntoo, employed his powerful influence to secure a peace which would\r\nrestore him liberty, and the place in the royal favor likely to be\r\nusurped by the Guises, if his absence from court were to last much\r\nlonger. And Paul the Fourth was now as earnestly desirous of effecting a\r\nreconciliation between the contending monarchs--that they might unitedly\r\nengage in the holy work of persecution--as he had been a few years\r\nbefore to embroil them in war.[675]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, April 3, 1559.]\r\n\r\nThe common desire for peace found expression in the appointment of\r\nplenipotentiaries, who met, about the middle of October, in the\r\nmonastery of Cercamps, near Cambray. France was represented by\r\nMontmorency, the Cardinal of Lorraine, Marshal St. André, Morvilliers,\r\nBishop of Orleans, and Claude de l'Aubespine, Secretary of State. The\r\nDuke of Alva, William of Orange, Ruy-Gomez de Silva, the Bishop of\r\nArras, and Viglius appeared on the part of Philip. England and Savoy\r\nwere also represented by their envoys. After preliminary discussions,\r\nthe conference adjourned, to meet in February of the succeeding year at\r\nCateau-Cambrésis.[676] Here, on the third of April, 1559, was concluded\r\na treaty of peace that terminated the struggle for ascendancy in which\r\nFrance and Spain had been engaged, with brief intermissions, ever since\r\nthe accession of Francis the First and Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\nSo far as France was concerned, it was an inglorious close. By a single\r\nstroke of the pen Henry gave up nearly two hundred places that had been\r\ncaptured by the French from their enemies during the last thirty years.\r\nIn return he received Ham, St. Quentin, and three other strongholds held\r\nby Philip on his northern frontier. All the fruits of many years of war\r\nand an infinite loss of life and treasure[677] were surrendered in an\r\ninstant for a paltry price. The Duke of Savoy recovered states which had\r\nlong been incorporated in the French dominions. The jurisdictions of two\r\nparliaments of France became foreign territory. The inhabitants of Turin\r\nwere left to forget the language they had begun to speak well. The King\r\nof Spain could now come to the very gates of Lyons, which before the\r\npeace had stood, as it were, in the middle of the kingdom, but was now\r\nturned into a border city.[678]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sacrifice of French interests.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the concessions Henry was willing to make for the purpose of\r\nobtaining peace abroad, that he might turn his arms against his own\r\nsubjects. Philip, if equally zealous, was certainly too prudent to\r\nexhibit his eagerness so clearly to his opponent. The interests of\r\nFrance had been sacrificed to the bigotry of her monarch and the\r\nselfishness of his advisers. When the terms of the agreement were made\r\nknown, they awakened in every true Frenchman's breast a feeling of shame\r\nand disgust.[679] Henry himself manifested embarrassment when\r\nattempting to justify his course.[680] Abroad the improbable tidings\r\nwere received with incredulity.[681]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was there a secret treaty for the extermination of the\r\nProtestants?]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis contained but one article on the subject\r\nof religion--that which bound the monarchs of Spain and France to put\r\nforth their united exertions for securing a \"holy universal council.\"\r\nBut common report had it that the omission of more detailed reference to\r\nthe subject lying so near to the heart of both kings was fully\r\ncompensated by a secret treaty taken up exclusively with this\r\nsubject.[682] That treaty was represented as developing a plan which\r\ncontemplated nothing less than the entire and violent destruction of\r\nheresy by the united efforts of their Catholic and Very Christian\r\nMajesties. By a single concerted massacre of all dissidents, the whole\r\nof Europe was to be brought back to its allegiance to the see of St.\r\nPeter.[683] Unfortunately, the secret treaty, if it ever existed, has\r\nnever come to light; nor have we the testimony of a single person who\r\npretends to have seen it, or to be acquainted with its contents. Indeed,\r\nthe circumstances of the case seem to render such a united effort as\r\nthe conjectural treaty supposes either Quixotic or\r\nsuperfluous--Quixotic, if the two monarchs, without the concurrence of\r\nthe empire, whose crown had passed from Charles, not to his son Philip,\r\nbut to his brother Ferdinand, should institute a scheme for a general\r\ncrusade against the professors of the doctrines that had already gained\r\na firm foothold in one-half of Germany, in Great Britain, and the\r\nScandinavian lands of Northern Europe; superfluous, if it respected only\r\nthe dominions of the high contracting powers. For the purpose of Henry\r\nwas no less clearly and repeatedly proclaimed than that of Philip. No\r\nsubject of either crown could ignore at whom the first blow would be\r\nstruck, after the pressure of the foreign war had been removed.[684]\r\nNor, in the execution of their plans, could either monarch imagine\r\nhimself to stand in need of the assistance of his royal brother; for it\r\nwas not an open war to be carried on, but as yet a struggle with\r\n_persons_, numerous without doubt, but, nevertheless, _suspected_ rather\r\nthan _convicted_ of heresy, and discovered, for the most part, only by\r\ndiligent search.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Prince of Orange learns Henry's and Philip's designs.]\r\n\r\nBut, if we have reason to think that the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis was\r\naccompanied by no secret and formal stipulations having reference to a\r\ncombined assault upon Protestantism, we at least know that the\r\nnegotiations it occasioned gave rise to a singular disclosure of the\r\npolicy of Philip the Second in the Netherlands--a policy which he deemed\r\napplicable to Christendom entire. Among the ambassadors of Philip and\r\nthe hostages for the execution of the treaty was William of Orange, the\r\nfuture deliverer of the United Provinces. Henry, supposing that the\r\nnobleman to whom so honorable a trust had been committed enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of his master to an equal extent with the Duke of Alva, his\r\ncolleague, imprudently broached the subject of the suppression of\r\nheresy. The prince wisely encouraged the misapprehension, in order to\r\navoid incurring the contempt in which he would have been held had the\r\ndiscovery been made that Philip had not taken him into his confidence.\r\nHenry, waxing earnest on the theme, revealed the intention of Philip and\r\nAlva to establish in the Netherlands \"a worse than Spanish Inquisition.\"\r\nThus much the prince himself published to the world.[685] The learned\r\nPresident De Thou adds that Philip's subsequent design was to join his\r\narms to those of France, to make a joint attack upon the \"new\r\nsectaries.\"[686] This is not altogether impossible. But the plan was\r\ngeneral and vague. Its execution was still in the distant future. Its\r\ndetails were probably but little elaborated. If, outside of the\r\ndominions of the two monarchs, any points of attack were proposed with\r\ndistinctness, they were the free city of Strasbourg, the Canton of Berne\r\nwith its dependency, the _Pays de Vaud_--but, above all, _Geneva_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger menacing the city of Geneva.]\r\n\r\nThat small republic, insignificant in size, but powerful through the\r\ninfluence of its teachers and the books with which its presses teemed,\r\nwas the eyesore of Roman Catholic France. It was the home of French\r\nrefugees for religion's sake; and the strictest laws could not check the\r\nstream of money that flowed thither for their support. It was the\r\nnursery of the reformed doctrines; and the death penalty was ineffectual\r\nto cut off intercourse, or to dam up the flood of Calvinistic books\r\nwhich it poured over the kingdom.\r\n\r\nCalvin himself and his friends momentarily expected the blow to fall\r\nupon their devoted heads.[687] But the same hand that so often in the\r\neventful history of Geneva interposed in its behalf, by a signal\r\noccurrence warded off the stroke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A joint expedition against Geneva proposed by Henry,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: but declined by the Duke of Alva.]\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of the Genevese were well founded. In June, 1559, and\r\nbut a few days before the date of Calvin's letter, Philip the Second\r\nmade the offer to the French king, through the Duke of Alva, then in\r\nParis, to aid him in exterminating the Protestants of France. Henry\r\ndeclined for the moment to avail himself of the assistance, which he\r\nregarded as unnecessary; but he sent the Constable Montmorency to\r\npropose that both monarchs should make a joint expedition against\r\nGeneva, and declared himself ready to employ all his forces in the pious\r\nundertaking. It may surprise us to learn that the prudent duke in turn\r\nrejected the crusade against the Protestant citadel. Even Philip and his\r\nequally bigoted agents could close their ears to the call to become the\r\ninstruments in the extirpation of heresy. While they could see neither\r\nreason nor religion in the temporizing policy occasionally manifested by\r\nother Roman Catholic sovereigns in their dealings with Protestant\r\nsubjects, Philip and Alva never suffered their hatred of schism to be so\r\nuncompromising as to interfere with what they considered a material\r\ninterest of the state. Unfortunately for Philip, the quarrel of Geneva\r\nwould inevitably be espoused by the Bernese and the inhabitants of the\r\nother Protestant cantons of Switzerland; and it was certainly\r\nundesirable to provoke the enmity of a powerful body of freemen,\r\nsituated in dangerous proximity to the \"Franche Comté\"--the remnant of\r\nBurgundy still in Spanish hands. It was no less imprudent, in view of\r\nfuture contingencies, to render still more difficult the passage from\r\nhis Catholic Majesty's dominions in Northern Italy to the Netherlands.\r\nSo Alva, as he himself reports to his master, rejected the constable's\r\nproposition, contenting himself with a few empty phrases respecting the\r\ngreat profit that would flow to the cause of God and of royalty from an\r\nexclusion of Roman Catholic subjects from that pestilent city on the\r\nshores of Lake Leman.[688]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament suspected of heretical leanings.]\r\n\r\nHenry had deemed the progress of the reformed doctrines in France so\r\nformidable[689] as to dictate the necessity of making peace with Philip,\r\neven upon humiliating terms. But where should he begin the savage work\r\nfor which he had made such sacrifices? His spiritual advisers pointed to\r\nthe courts of justice, which they accused of being lukewarm, and even\r\ninfected with heresy. For years they had been dwelling upon the same\r\ntheme. In 1556 the Sorbonne had denounced the parliament itself as\r\naltogether heretical;[690] and, although Henry showed some indignation\r\nat the suggestion, and sarcastically asked whether the theologians\r\naspired to become the supreme judges of the kingdom, it was notorious,\r\ntwo years later, that they had succeeded in sowing in his breast a\r\ngeneral distrust respecting the orthodoxy of the entire body.[691] Nor\r\nwas the suspicion groundless. Chosen from among the most highly educated\r\nof French jurisconsults, belonging to a court upon which high\r\nprerogatives had been conferred, holding for life a post of enviable\r\ndistinction, and regarded as the supreme guardians of law and equity, it\r\nwas in accordance with the very nature of things that the counsellors of\r\nthe Parisian parliament should so far participate in the progress of\r\nideas in the sixteenth century as to begin to look with abhorrence upon\r\nthe bloody task imposed on them by the royal edicts. Into what\r\nprofession would liberal views gain an earlier admission than that of\r\nthe appointed expositors of the rules of right?\r\n\r\nSome recent occurrences not only seemed to demonstrate the fact that the\r\nprinciples of clemency had penetrated into the halls of parliament, but\r\npointed out the very chamber which was most influenced by them. In the\r\n_Tournelle_, or criminal chamber of parliament--before which those\r\naccused of Protestantism most naturally came--under the presidency of\r\nSéguier,[692] the majority of the counsellors had recently conducted a\r\ntrial of four youths, on a charge of \"Lutheranism,\" in so skilful a\r\nmanner as to avoid asking any question the answer to which might\r\ncompromise the prisoners. And when the bigots insisted on propounding a\r\ncrucial inquiry, and elicited a decided expression of Protestant\r\nsentiments, some of the judges showed unmistakable sympathy, and the\r\nchamber, to save appearances in some slight degree, condemned them to\r\nleave the country within a fortnight, instead of instantly confirming\r\nthe sentence of death which had been pronounced against three of their\r\nnumber by the inferior courts.[693] Other \"Christaudins\" had been sent\r\nto their bishops for trial, although their guilt was patent to all.[694]\r\nIn fine, the Cardinal of Lorraine laid to the account of parliament the\r\nspread of the new doctrines throughout France.[695]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mercuriale.]\r\n\r\nIn order to discover the truth of the charges, a convocation of the\r\nmembers of all the chambers was ordered for the last Wednesday of April,\r\nSuch a gathering for inquiry into the sentiments and morals of the\r\njudges was called, from the day of the week on which it was held, a\r\n_Mercuriale_.[696] The object of the convocation was announced by the\r\nroyal procureur-general, Bourdin, to be the establishment of an\r\nunderstanding between the \"Grand' chambre\" and the \"Tournelle\"--the\r\nformer of which relentlessly condemned the \"Lutherans\" to the flames,\r\nwhile the latter, to the great scandal of justice, had let off several\r\nwith simple banishment. The wily adversary of the \"new doctrines,\"\r\ntherefore, called upon the judges to express their opinions respecting\r\nthe best method of effecting a return to uniformity. The snare was not\r\nlaid in vain. For in the free declaration of sentiment, in which the\r\nmembers according to custom indulged, several judges were bold enough to\r\ncall for the assembling of the Oecumenical Council promised by the\r\nlately ratified treaty of peace, as the sole method of extirpating\r\nerror, and to propose meanwhile the suspension of the capital penalties\r\nordained by the royal edicts.[697]\r\n\r\nAt his admission into parliament each judge had taken an oath to\r\nmaintain inviolable secrecy in reference to the deliberations of the\r\ncourt. This was rightly supposed to relate in particular to the\r\nexpressions of opinion before any formal decision. Nevertheless, the\r\nking was at once acquainted by the First President, Le Maistre, and by\r\nMinard, one of the presidents _à mortier_, with the entire proceedings\r\nof the _Mercuriale_. He was told that the \"Lutheranism\" of certain\r\njudges was now manifest. They had spoken in abominable terms of the\r\nmass, of the ecclesiastical ordinances, and of prevailing abuses. It\r\nwould be the ruin of the church if such daring were suffered to pass by\r\nunrebuked.[698]\r\n\r\nThe representation of these enormities inflamed Henry's anger. His\r\ncourtiers took good care not to suffer it to cool. What if, emboldened\r\nby impunity, the Protestants, of whose rapid growth in all parts of\r\nFrance such startling reports were brought to him, should attempt to\r\ncarry out the plan that was talked of among them, and seize the\r\nopportunity of the wedding festivities solemnly to present to his\r\nMajesty, by the hands of one of the nobles, the confession of faith of\r\ntheir churches? What punishment of the audacious agent employed would\r\nremove from the minds of the orthodox foreign princes present at court\r\nthe sinister impression that heresy had struck deep root in the realm of\r\nthe Very Christian King?[699]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry goes in person to listen to the deliberations, June 10,\r\n1559.]\r\n\r\nIf a candid gentleman of the bed-chamber, like Vieilleville, privately\r\nurged Henry to reject the advice of prelates in secular matters, and\r\nrespectfully decline the assumption of the post of theologian or\r\ninquisitor-general of the faith, his remonstrances were overborne by the\r\nsuggestions of Diana and the Guises, who hoped to reap a rich harvest\r\nfrom new confiscations.[700] The king was entreated to go in person to\r\nlisten to the discussions in parliament. Early on the morning of the\r\ntenth of June, his chamber was visited by a host of ecclesiastics--among\r\nthem four cardinals, two archbishops, two bishops, and several doctors\r\nof the Sorbonne, with De Mouchy, the inquisitor, at their head. They\r\nurged him to follow out their suggestion, and were so successful in\r\novercoming his reluctance that, as a contemporary wrote, he thought\r\nhimself consigned to perdition if he failed to go.[701]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament meets in the Augustinian monastery.]\r\n\r\nThe magnificent hall of the royal palace on the island of the \"Cité,\" in\r\nwhich parliament was accustomed to meet, was in course of preparation\r\nfor the festivities that were to accompany the marriages of Elizabeth,\r\nHenry's daughter, with Philip the Second of Spain, and of his only\r\nsister, Margaret, with the Duke of Savoy. Parliament was consequently\r\nsitting in the monastery of the Augustinian friars on the southern bank\r\nof the Seine.[702] Thither Henry proceeded in state with a retinue of\r\nnoblemen, and accompanied by the archers of his body-guard. Taking his\r\nseat upon the elevated throne prepared for him, with the constable, the\r\nGuises, and the princes that had attended him, on his right and left,\r\nHenry made to the judges a short address indicative of his purpose to\r\ntake advantage of the peace in order to labor for the re-establishment\r\nof the faith, and of his desire to obtain the advice of his supreme\r\ncourt.[703] When the king had concluded, Bertrand, Cardinal Archbishop\r\nof Sens and Keeper of the Seals, announced the command of his Majesty\r\nthat the consideration of the religious questions undertaken in the\r\n_Mercuriale_ should be resumed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fearlessness of the counsellors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne du Bourg.]\r\n\r\nThe counsellors could be in no doubt respecting the motives of this\r\nsolemn and unusual audience; yet they entered upon the discussion with\r\nthe utmost fearlessness.[704] Claude Viole boldly recommended the\r\nconvocation of an oecumenical council. Du Faur declaimed against the\r\nflagrant abuses of the church. While admitting that the trouble of the\r\nkingdom arose from diversity in religion, he pointed out the necessity\r\nof a careful scrutiny into the true authors of those troubles, lest the\r\naccuser of others should himself be met with a retort similar to that of\r\nthe ancient prophet to King Ahab--\"It is thou that troublest\r\nIsrael.\"[705] But Anne du Bourg, a nephew of a late Chancellor of\r\nFrance, and a learned and eloquent speaker, committed himself still\r\nfurther to the cause of liberty and truth. He gave thanks to Almighty\r\nGod for having brought Henry to listen to the decision of so worthy a\r\nmatter, and entreated the monarch to give it his attention, as the cause\r\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, which ought to be upheld by kings. He\r\nadvocated a suspension of all persecution against those who were\r\nstigmatized as heretics, until the assembling of a council; and warned\r\nhis hearers that it was a thing of no slight importance to condemn to\r\ndeath those who, in the midst of the flames, called on the name of the\r\nSaviour of men.[706] Another counsellor advocated the granting to all\r\nthe \"Lutherans\" of the kingdom a term of six months, within which they\r\nmight recant their errors, and at its close might withdraw from France.\r\nBut there were others who recommended the employment of severe measures;\r\nand the first president recalled with approval the example of Philip\r\nAugustus, who, in one day, had burned six hundred heretics, and the fate\r\nof the Waldenses, suffocated in the houses and caves in which they had\r\ntaken refuge.[707]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry is displeased, and orders the arrest of two of the\r\ncounsellors.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the deliberation, Henry summoned to him the\r\nnoblemen who had accompanied him, and, after having consulted them,\r\nangrily declared his great displeasure at the discovery that many of his\r\njudges had departed from the faith, and his determination to inflict\r\nupon them an exemplary punishment. Then turning to Montmorency, he\r\nordered him to arrest two of the counsellors that had spoken in his\r\npresence--Louis du Faur and Anne du Bourg. The constable at once obeyed,\r\nand gave them over into the custody of Gabriel, Count Montgomery,\r\ncaptain of the Scottish body-guard. Three other judges soon shared their\r\nrigorous imprisonment in the Bastile,[708] and as many more escaped only\r\nby flight. It was, however, with the boldness of Du Bourg that Henry was\r\nchiefly enraged. He swore that he would see him burned with his own\r\neyes.[709]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first National Synod, May, 1559.]\r\n\r\nBut, whilst the enemies of the Reformation were devising new schemes of\r\npersecution, and were preparing to strike a blow at the more tolerant\r\nsentiments which had stolen into the breasts of the very judges of\r\nparliament, its friends took a step that was at once indicative of its\r\nprogress and dictated by its necessities. A few days before Henry was\r\npersuaded to call for a continuation of the discussion commenced at the\r\n\"Mercuriale\"--on the twenty-sixth of May[710]--the first National Synod\r\nof the French Protestants convened in the city of Paris. It was a small\r\nassemblage in comparison with some others on the list of these national\r\ncouncils extending down for about a century, and its sessions were held\r\nwith the utmost secrecy in a house in the Faubourg St. Germain. But it\r\nperformed for French Protestantism the two important services of giving\r\nan authoritative statement of its system of doctrine, and of\r\nestablishing the principles of its form of government. The confession of\r\nfaith was full and explicit, as well on the points in which the\r\nProtestant and the Roman churches agreed, as respecting the distinctive\r\ntenets of the reformed. The \"diabolical imaginations\" of Servetus were\r\nequally condemned with the gross abuses of monastic vows, pilgrimages,\r\ncelibacy, auricular confession, and indulgences. The pure observance of\r\nthe sacraments was established, as well against their corrupt and\r\nsuperstitious use in the papal church, as against the \"fantastic\r\nsacramentarians\" who rejected them entirely. Nor need we be surprised to\r\nfind the warrant of magistrates to interfere _in behalf_ of the truth\r\nformally recognized. The right of the individual conscience was a right\r\nfor the most part ignored by thinking men on both sides during the\r\nsixteenth century--covered and hidden by the fallacious application of\r\nthe principle of universal obligation to the inflexible law of right and\r\nof God. The lesson of liberty based upon order was learned only in the\r\nschool of long and severe persecution. Even after thirty-seven or eight\r\nyears of violent suffering, the Protestant church of France admitted as\r\nan article in her creed, that \"God has placed the sword in the hand of\r\nmagistrates to repress the sins committed not only against the _second_\r\ntable of God's commandments, but also against the _first_!\"[711]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ecclesiastical discipline adopted.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Ecclesiastical Discipline\" laid the foundation of the organization\r\nof the Protestants in France. Thoroughly democratic and representative\r\nin its character, it instituted, or rather recognized, a court--the\r\nconsistory--in each particular congregation, with its popular element in\r\nthe _superintendents_ (surveillants) or _elders_, who sat with the\r\npastors to adjudicate upon the inferior and local concerns of the\r\nmembers. It provided for the more direct participation of the people in\r\nthe control of affairs by making the offices of elder and deacon\r\nelective, and not perpetual. It provided a court of appeal in the\r\nprovincial _colloques_ or _synods_, to be held at least twice a year, in\r\nwhich each church was to be represented by its pastor and elder. Above\r\nall stood the _National Synod_, the ultimate ecclesiastical authority.\r\nThe constitution strove to preclude the establishment of a hierarchy, by\r\ndeclaring all churches and ministers equal, and to secure correctness of\r\nteaching, not only by requiring the ministers to sign the confession,\r\nbut by providing for the deposition of those who had lapsed from the\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, in the midst of a monarchy surpassed by none for its\r\narbitrary and tyrannical administration, and not many hundred paces from\r\nthe squares where for a generation the eyes of the public had been\r\nperiodically feasted with the sight of human sacrifices offered up in\r\nthe name of religion, the founders of the Huguenot church framed the\r\nplan of an ecclesiastical republic, in which the elements of popular\r\nrepresentation and decisive authority in an ultimate tribunal, the\r\nembodiment of the judgment of the entire church, were perhaps more\r\ncompletely realized than they had ever before been since the times of\r\nthe early Christians.[712] The few ministers that had met in an upper\r\nroom, at the hazard of their lives, to vindicate the profession of faith\r\nof their persecuted co-religionists, and to sketch the plan of their\r\nchurchly edifice, as noiselessly retraced their steps to the\r\ncongregations committed to their charge. But they had planted the seed\r\nof a mighty tree which would stand the blasts of many a tempest--always\r\nbuffeted by the winds, and bearing the scars of many a conflict with the\r\nelements--but proudly pre-eminent, and firm as the rock around which its\r\nsturdy roots were wound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriages and festivities of the court.]\r\n\r\nHenry had sworn to behold with his own eyes the punishment of Anne du\r\nBourg. But the grateful sight was not in store for him. From the\r\nMercuriale and the persecution of heretics he turned his attention to\r\nthe celebration of the marriages which were to cement the indissoluble\r\npeace that had at length been concluded between the kingdoms of France\r\nand Spain. The most splendid preparations were made for the\r\nentertainment of the brilliant train of noblemen who came to represent\r\nthe dignity of the crown of Spain, and to claim the destined bride of\r\nPhilip. The \"Hôtel des Tournelles\"--a favorite palace of more than one\r\nking of France--was magnificently decorated; for in its great hall the\r\nnuptials were appointed to be celebrated. In the broad street of Saint\r\nAntoine, in front of this palace, the lists were erected, and the beauty\r\nand nobility of France viewed, from the windows on either side, the\r\ncontest of the most distinguished knights, and applauded their feats of\r\ndaring and skill. A few paces farther, and just inside the moat, stood a\r\nfrowning pile, whose sombre and repulsive front might have struck a\r\nbeholder as being as much out of place as the skeleton at the feast--the\r\nill-omened Bastile.[713] Five prisoners, immured for their conscientious\r\nboldness in its gloomy dungeons, and awaiting a terrible fate,\r\ndistinctly heard, day after day, as the tourney continued, the\r\ninspiriting notes of the clarion and hautboy, deepening by contrast the\r\nhorrors of their situation.[714] There was the same incongruity between\r\nthe king's pursuit of pleasure and his ferocity. From the festivities,\r\nit is said, he turned aside to order Montgomery to proceed, the very\r\nmoment the tourney was over, to the _Pays de Caux_--a hot-bed of the\r\n\"Lutheran\" heresy--to destroy with the sword the resisting, to put out\r\nthe eyes of the suspected, and to torture and burn the guilty.[715] It\r\nwas believed, moreover, that he himself would then proceed to the\r\nsouthern parts of France, and set on foot a rigorous persecution of the\r\nProtestants, with whom those regions swarmed.[716]\r\n\r\nThe nuptial torches burned not less bright for the gloom overhanging the\r\ndespised and abominated Lutherans. But in an instant, as by the touch of\r\na magician's wand, they were turned into the funereal tapers of Henry\r\nthe Second.[717]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tournament, June 30, 1559.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry mortally wounded by Montgomery's lance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His death.]\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of June,[718] when the sports of the day were about\r\nending, the gay monarch must needs re-enter the lists in person, and\r\nbreak another lance in honor of Diana of Poitiers, whose colors he wore.\r\nThe queen had indeed begged him to avoid, for that day at least, the\r\ndangerous pastime; she had been terrified, so she said, by one of those\r\nstrangely vivid dreams that wear, after the event, so much of the guise\r\nof prophetic sight.[719] But Henry made light of her fears, and closed\r\nhis ears to her warning. His choice of an antagonist fell upon\r\nMontgomery, captain of his Scottish archers; and although the latter\r\nbegged leave to decline the perilous honor, the king refused to excuse\r\nhim.[720] At the appointed signal, the knights rode rapidly to the rude\r\nencounter. But Henry's visor was not proof against the lance of\r\nMontgomery, and either broke or was unclasped in the shock. The lance\r\nitself was splintered by the blow, and the piece which Montgomery, in\r\nhis surprise and fright, had neglected instantly to lower, entering\r\nabove the monarch's eye, penetrated far toward the brain.[721] Rescued\r\nfrom falling, but covered with blood, the wounded prince was hastily\r\nstripped of his armor, amid the loud lamentations of the horror-stricken\r\nspectators, and borne into the magnificent saloon of the _Palais des\r\nTournelles_. Here, after lingering a few days, he died on the tenth of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nIt was a month, to the hour, since Henry's visit to parliament.[722]\r\n\r\nThe body was laid out in state in the very room appointed for the\r\nnuptial balls. A splendidly wrought tapestry representing the conversion\r\nof St. Paul hung near the remains, but the words, \"Saul, Saul, why\r\npersecutest thou me?\" embroidered upon it, admitted too pointed an\r\napplication, and the cloth was soon put out of sight.[723] The public,\r\nhowever, needed no such pictorial reminder. The persecutor had been\r\nstopped as suddenly in his career of blood as the young Pharisee near\r\nDamascus. But it may be doubted whether the eyes with which he had sworn\r\nto see Anne du Bourg burned beheld such a vision of glory as blinded the\r\nfuture apostle's vision. It is more than probable, indeed, that Henry\r\nnever spoke after receiving the fatal wound;[724] although the report\r\nobtained that, as he was carried from the unfortunate tilting-ground, he\r\nturned his bleeding face toward the prison in which the parliament\r\ncounsellors were languishing, and expressed fear lest he had wronged\r\nthem--a suggestion which the Cardinal of Lorraine hastened to answer by\r\nrepresenting it as a temptation of the Prince of Evil.[725]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: \"La Façon de Genève\"--the Huguenot service.]\r\n\r\n     The charge of having prayed, or administered the sacrament of\r\n     Baptism or of the Lord's Supper, or taken part in the celebration\r\n     of Marriage, \"according to the fashion of Geneva,\" so frequently\r\n     appears in the documents of the first century after the\r\n     establishment of the Reformation in France as the chief offence of\r\n     its early adherents and martyrs, that it is worth while to examine\r\n     in some detail the model of worship that has exerted so important\r\n     an influence upon the practice of the Huguenots and their\r\n     descendants down to the present time.\r\n\r\n     While discarding the cumbrous ceremonial of the Roman Church, on\r\n     the ground that it was not only overloaded with superfluous\r\n     ornament, but too fatally disfigured by irrational, superstitious,\r\n     or impious observances to be susceptible of correction or\r\n     adaptation to the wants of their infant congregations, the founders\r\n     of the reformed churches of the continent did not leave the\r\n     inexperienced ministers to whose care these congregations were\r\n     confided altogether without a guide in the conduct of divine\r\n     worship. Esteeming a written account of the manner in which the\r\n     public services were customarily performed to be the safest\r\n     directory for the use of the young or ill-equipped, as well as the\r\n     surest means of silencing the shameless calumnies of their\r\n     malignant opponents, they early framed liturgies, not to be imposed\r\n     as obligatory forms, but rather to serve an important end in\r\n     securing an orderly conformity in the general arrangement followed\r\n     in their churches.\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: Farel's \"Manière et fasson,\" 1533.]\r\n\r\n     The earliest of these liturgical compositions appears to have been\r\n     a small and thin volume of eighty-seven pages, which, as we learn\r\n     from the colophon, was \"printed by Pierre de Wingle at Neufchâtel,\r\n     on the twenty-ninth day of August in the year 1533;\" that is to\r\n     say, on the same press which, about a twelvemonth later, sent forth\r\n     the famous \"Placards\" against the mass, and a year afterward the\r\n     Protestant version of the Bible, translated into French by\r\n     Olivetanus. It is entitled \"_La Manière et fasson qu'on tient ès\r\n     lieux que Dieu de sa grace a visités_.\" It was undoubtedly composed\r\n     by Guillaume Farel, and, like all the other tracts of that vigorous\r\n     and popular reformer, it has become extremely rare. Indeed, the\r\n     work was altogether unknown until a single copy, the only one thus\r\n     far discovered, was found by Professor Baum, of Strasbourg, in the\r\n     Library of Zurich.[726]\r\n\r\n     What lends additional interest to the liturgy of Farel, is the\r\n     circumstance that it is at the same time, as the modern editor\r\n     remarks, \"_the earliest Confession of Faith_ of the Reformed\r\n     Churches, _their first apology_ in answer to the atrocious, absurd\r\n     and lying accusations which the hatred of their enemies, especially\r\n     among the clergy, had invented at will, or had borrowed from pagan\r\n     calumnies against the Christians of the first centuries.\" \"Do they\r\n     not exclaim,\" writes Farel in his preface, \"that those accursed\r\n     dogs of heretics who would uphold this new law live like beasts,\r\n     renouncing everything, maintaining neither law nor faith, abjuring\r\n     all the sacraments; that they reject Baptism, and make light of\r\n     the Holy Table of our Lord; that they despise the Virgin Mary and\r\n     the saints, and observe no marriage.\" To remove the prejudice thus\r\n     engendered from the minds of the ignorant, is the chief design of\r\n     the writer, who accordingly appeals at each step for his warrant to\r\n     the Holy Scriptures, and entreats the reader to have no regard for\r\n     the antiquity of the abuses he combats, or for the reputation of\r\n     their advocates, but simply to examine for himself what \"our good\r\n     Saviour Jesus has instituted and commanded.\" The offices are five\r\n     in number; for Baptism, Marriage, the Lord's Supper, Preaching, and\r\n     the Visitation of the Sick; but to a certain extent, and\r\n     particularly in the last-mentioned office, they are little more\r\n     than a series of directions for the orderly conduct of worship. In\r\n     other cases the service is very fully written out.\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: Calvin's liturgy, 1542.]\r\n\r\n     Nine years after the publication of this very simple liturgy of\r\n     Farel, appeared the first edition of the liturgy of Geneva,\r\n     composed by Calvin, or the \"Prayers after the fashion of Geneva,\"\r\n     as they were usually designated by contemporary Roman Catholic\r\n     writers. Until recently the first edition was supposed to have been\r\n     published in 1543, but Professor Felix Bovet, of Neufchâtel, has\r\n     been so fortunate as to find a copy in the Royal Library of\r\n     Stuttgart, bearing the date of 1542. This is probably the solitary\r\n     remaining specimen of the original impression.[727] Although\r\n     without name of place, it was doubtless printed in Geneva. The\r\n     title is: \"_La Forme des Prières et Chantz Ecclésiastiques, avec la\r\n     Manière d'administrer les Sacremens et consacrer le Marriage, selon\r\n     la coustume de l'Eglise Ancienne. M.DXLII._\"\r\n\r\n     The following brief sketch will perhaps convey a sufficient idea of\r\n     the form \"which is ordinarily used\" for the public worship of the\r\n     morning of the Lord's day.\r\n\r\n     A brief _invocation_ (\"Our help be in the name of the Lord who made\r\n     heaven and earth\") is followed by an _exhortation_ addressed to the\r\n     congregation (\"My brethren, let each one of you present himself\r\n     before the face of the Lord with confession of his faults and sins,\r\n     following in his heart my words\"). The _Confession_, which is the\r\n     most beautiful and characteristic part of the liturgy, comes next.\r\n     Used by Théodore de Bèze and his companions at the Colloquy of\r\n     Poissy, with wonderful impressiveness, as preparatory to that\r\n     reformer's grand vindication of the creed of the Protestants of\r\n     France, it has been imagined by many that it was composed by him\r\n     for this occasion. But it had already constituted a part of the\r\n     public devotions of the French and Swiss Protestants for eighteen\r\n     or twenty years. A _Psalm_ was then sung, and a prayer offered \"to\r\n     implore God for the grace of His Holy Spirit, to the end that His\r\n     Word may be faithfully expounded to the honor of His Name and the\r\n     edification of the church, and may be received with such humility\r\n     and obedience as are becoming.\" The form is \"at the discretion of\r\n     the minister.\" After the sermon comes a longer prayer for all\r\n     persons in authority; for Christian pastors; for the enlightenment\r\n     of the ignorant and the edification of those who have been brought\r\n     to the truth; for the comfort of the afflicted and distressed;[728]\r\n     closing with supplications for temporal and spiritual blessings in\r\n     behalf of those present. The service was concluded by the form of\r\n     benediction, Numbers, vi. 24-26.\r\n\r\n     Colladon, in his life of the reformer, tells us that Calvin\r\n     \"collected (recueillit), for the use of the church of Geneva, the\r\n     form of ecclesiastical prayers, with the manner of administering\r\n     the sacraments and celebrating marriage, and a notice for the\r\n     visitation of the sick, as they are now placed with the Psalms.\"\r\n     (Baum, Cunitz, and Reuss, vi., pp. xvii., xviii.) And Calvin\r\n     himself, in his farewell address to his fellow-ministers (April 28,\r\n     1564), as taken down from memory by Pinaut, observed: \"As to the\r\n     prayers for Sunday, I took the form of Strasbourg, and borrowed the\r\n     greater part of it.\" (Adieux de Calvin, Bonnet, Lettres françaises,\r\n     ii. 578.) The Strasbourg liturgy to which Calvin here refers was\r\n     one which he had himself composed for the use of the French refugee\r\n     church of Strasbourg, when acting as its pastor, during his exile\r\n     from Geneva (1538-1541). The earliest edition known to be extant is\r\n     that of which a single copy exists in the collection of M. Gaiffe,\r\n     and of which M. O. Douen has for the first time given an account in\r\n     his \"Clément Marot et le Psautier huguenot,\" Paris, 1878, i.\r\n     334-339. This Strasbourg liturgy of 1542 (the pseudo-_Roman_\r\n     edition already referred to, p. 275), like that of 1545 (which\r\n     Professors Baum, Cunitz, and Reuss described in their edition of\r\n     Calvin's works, vi. 174, 175), contains some striking variations\r\n     from the Geneva forms. In particular, immediately after the\r\n     \"Confession of Sins,\" it inserts these words: \"Here the Minister\r\n     recites some word of Scripture to comfort consciences, and then\r\n     pronounces the absolution as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Let each one of you recognize himself to be truly a sinner,\r\n     humbling himself before God, and believe that our Heavenly Father\r\n     will be gracious unto him in Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n     \"To all those who thus repent and seek Jesus Christ for their\r\n     salvation, I declare the absolution of their sins, in the name of\r\n     the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n     It was this Strasbourg liturgy of Calvin that was in the hands of\r\n     the framers of the English \"Book of Common Prayer,\" and from this\r\n     they derived the introductory portion of the daily service.\r\n     \"According to the first book of Edward VI., that service began with\r\n     the Lord's Prayer. The foreign reformers consulted recommended the\r\n     insertion of some preliminary forms; and hence the origin of the\r\n     Sentences, the Exhortation, the Confession, and the Absolution.\r\n     These elements were borrowed, not from any ancient formulary, but\r\n     from a ritual drawn up by Calvin for the church at Strasbourg.\" (C.\r\n     W. Baird, Eutaxia, or the Presbyterian Liturgies: Historical\r\n     Sketches, New York, 1855, p. 190.)\r\n\r\n     The origin of only one of the minor offices of the Geneva liturgy\r\n     can be distinctly traced to another and older source. The form for\r\n     the celebration of marriage is taken bodily from the \"Manière et\r\n     Fasson\" of Farel, with the omission of two or three unimportant\r\n     sentences, and the alteration of a very few words--a trifling\r\n     change, dictated in each case by Calvin's keener literary taste.\r\n     The form for baptism, Calvin tells us expressly, was somewhat\r\n     roughly drafted by himself at Strasbourg, when the children of\r\n     Anabaptists were brought to him for baptism from distances of five\r\n     or ten leagues around. (Adieux de Calvin, Bonnet, ii. 578.)\r\n\r\n     The liturgy of Geneva, composed with rapidity under the pressure of\r\n     the times, but with the skill and fine literary finish that are\r\n     wont to characterize even the most hurried of Calvin's productions,\r\n     has maintained its position undisputed to the present time, being\r\n     the oldest of existing forms of worship in the reformed churches.\r\n     The gradual change in the French language since the date of its\r\n     composition has rendered necessary some modernizing of the style\r\n     both of the prayers and of the accompanying psalms. These\r\n     modifications, much more radical in the case of the metrical\r\n     psalms, took place in the eighteenth century, and commended\r\n     themselves so fully to the good sense of all French-speaking\r\n     Protestants as soon to be everywhere adopted. The MS. records of\r\n     the French church in New York (folio 45) contain, under date of\r\n     March 6, 1763, a resolution unanimously adopted in a meeting of the\r\n     heads of families and communicants, to change \"la vielle version\r\n     des Pseaumes de David qui est en uzage parmy nous, et de prandre et\r\n     introduire dans notre Eglize les Pseaumes de la plus nouvelle\r\n     version qui est en uzage dans les Eglises de Genève, Suisse et\r\n     Hollande.\" The liturgy has always been printed at the end of the\r\n     psalter, and the change of the one involved that of the other. It\r\n     has been noted above that the \"Confession of Sins\" was the most\r\n     characteristic part of Calvin's liturgy. In fact, the initial words\r\n     of this confession, \"Seigneur Dieu, _Père Éternel_ et\r\n     Toutpuissant,\" came to stand in the minds of the Roman Catholics\r\n     who heard them for the entire Protestant service. Bernard Palissy\r\n     accordingly tells us (Recepte Véritable, 1563, Bulletin, i. 93)\r\n     that a favorite expression of the Roman Catholics from Taillebourg,\r\n     when committing all sorts of excesses against the Protestants of\r\n     Saintes, was: \"_Agimus_ a gagné _Père Éternel_!\" As _Agimus_ was\r\n     the first word of the customary grace said at meals by devout Roman\r\n     Catholics--\"Agimus tibi gratias, omnipotens Deus,\" etc.--this\r\n     apparently enigmatical expression was only a profane formula to\r\n     celebrate the triumph of the Roman over the reformed church. See\r\n     Bulletin, xii. 247 and 469.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: Alluding to the compacts into which Francis had entered,\r\nthe emperor accuses him of having purposely violated them all: \"los\r\nquales nunca a guardado, como es notorio, sino por el tiempo que no a\r\npodido renobar guerra, ó a querido esperar de hallar oportunidad de\r\ndañarme con disimulacion.\" From Henry he anticipates little better\r\ntreatment.

None the less was one of his dependants--the Count of\r\nMontecuccoli--compelled by torture to avow, or invent the story, that he\r\nhad poisoned him at the instigation of Charles the Fifth. He paid the\r\npenalty of his weakness by being drawn asunder by four horses! How\r\nlittle Francis I. believed the story is seen from the magnificence and\r\ncordiality with which, three years later, he entertained the supposed\r\nauthor and abettor of the crime. See an interesting note of M. Guiffrey,\r\nCronique du Roy Françoys I^er, 184-186. The imperialists replied by\r\nattributing the supposed crime, with equal improbability, to Catharine\r\nde' Medici, the youthful bride of Henry, who succeeded to his brother's\r\ntitle and expectations. Charles of Angoulême, a prince whose inordinate\r\nambition, if we may believe the memoirs of Vieilleville, led him to\r\nexhibit unmistakable tokens of joy at a false report of the drowning of\r\nhis two elder brothers, died on the 8th of September, 1545, of\r\ninfection, to which he wantonly exposed himself by entering a house and\r\nhandling the clothes of the dead, with the presumptuous boast \"that\r\nnever had a son of France been known to die of the plague.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: See Brantôme, Hommes illustres (Oeuvres, vii. 369,\r\n370).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: This was as early as 1538.

The most striking\r\nfeatures of the character of Henry are well delineated by the Venetian\r\nambassadors who visited the court of France during the preceding and the\r\npresent reigns. Even the Protestants who had experienced his severity\r\nspeak well of his natural gentleness, and deplore the evils into which\r\nhe fell through want of self-reliance. The discriminating Regnier de la\r\nPlanche styles him \"prince de doux esprit, mais de fort petit sens, et\r\ndu tout propre à se laisser mener en lesse\" (Histoire de l'estat de\r\nFrance, éd.

Claude de l'Aubespine draws a more\r\nflattering portrait, as might be expected from one who served as\r\nminister of state in the councils of Francis I. and the three succeeding\r\nmonarchs: \"Ce prince estoit, à la vérité, très-bien nay, tant de corps\r\n_que de l'esprit_....

For the edict does not, as he asserts,\r\npermit \"the civil judges--presidial judges as well as\r\nparliaments--equally with the spiritual, to commence every process.\" It\r\ndeprives the ecclesiastical judge, 1st, of the right which the ordinance\r\nof 1549 had conferred, of _initiating_ any process where scandal,\r\nsedition, etc., were joined to simple heresy, and these cases--under the\r\ninterpretation of the law--constituted a large proportion of cases; 2d,\r\nof the right of deciding with the secular judges in these last-named\r\ncases; and 3d, of the power of arrest.

D. Scott, p. 70). that Coligny's \"love for true religion and vital\r\ngodliness, and his desire to worship God aright,\" dated from the time of\r\nhis captivity after the fall of St. Quentin (1557), and the opportunity\r\nhe then enjoyed for reading the Holy Scriptures, is to be found probably\r\nin the view that, having previously been convinced of the truth of the\r\nreformed doctrines, he was not brought until then to their bold\r\nconfession and courageous espousal--acts so perilous in themselves and\r\nso fatal to his ambition and to his love of ease.

The dates of these letters, in connection with a\r\nstatement in the Hist. ecclés., fix the imprisonment of D'Andelot as\r\nlasting from May to July, 1558. A month later Calvin wrote to Garnier:\r\n\"D'Andelot, the nephew of the constable, has basely deceived our\r\nexpectations. After having given proofs of invincible constancy, in a\r\nmoment of weakness he consented to go to mass, if the king absolutely\r\ninsisted on his doing so. He declared publicly, indeed, that he thus\r\nacted against his inclinations; he has nevertheless exposed the gospel\r\nto great disgrace. He now implores our forgiveness for this offence....\r\nThis, at least, is praiseworthy in him, that he avoids the court, and\r\nopenly declares that he had never abandoned his principles.\" Letter of\r\nAug. 29th, Bonnet, Eng. tr., iii. 460; see also Ath. Coquerel, Précis de\r\nl'histoire de l'égl. réf. de Paris, Pièces historiques, pp.\r\nxxii.-lxxvi.; twenty-one letters of Macar belonging to 1558. If the\r\nreformers condemned D'Andelot's concession, Paul the Fourth, on the\r\nother hand, regarded his escape from the _estrapade_ as proof positive\r\nthat not only Henry, but even the Cardinal of Lorraine, was lukewarm in\r\nthe defence of the faith! Read the following misspelt sentences from a\r\nletter of Card. La Bourdaisière, the French envoy to Rome, to the\r\nconstable (Feb. 25, 1559), now among the MSS. of the National Library of\r\nParis. The Pope had sent expressly for the ambassador: \"Il me declara\r\nque cestoit pour me dire quil sebayssoit grandement comme _sa magesté ne\r\nfaysoit autre compte de punyr les hereticques de son Royaume et que\r\nlimpunite de monsieur dandelot donnoit une tres mauvayse reputation a\r\nsadicte mageste_ devant laquelle ledict Sr. dandelot avoit confessé\r\ndestre sacramentayre et _qui leust_ (qu 'il l'eût) _mené tout droit au\r\nfeu comme il meritoit_ ... que _monsieur le cardinal de Lorrayne_,\r\nlequel sa Saincteté a fait son Inquisiteur, ne se sauroit excuser quil\r\nnayt _grandement failly_ ayant layssé perdre une si belle occasion dun\r\n_exemple si salutayre_ et qui luy pouvoit porter tant dhonneur et de\r\nreputation, mais _quil monstre bien que luy mesme favorise les\r\nhereticques_, dautant que lors que ce scandale advynt, il estoit seul\r\npres du roy, sans que personne luy peust resister ne l'empescher duser\r\nde la puyssance que sadicte Saincteté luy a donnée.\" Of course, Paul\r\ncould not let pass unimproved so fair an opportunity for repeating the\r\ntrite warning that subversion of kingdoms and other dire calamities\r\nfollow in the train of \"mutation of religion.\" The punishment of\r\nD'Andelot, however, to which he often returned in his conversation, the\r\nPontiff evidently regarded as a thing to be _executed_ rather than\r\n_spoken about_, and he therefore begged the French ambassador to write\r\nthe letter to the king in his own cipher, and advise him \"to let no one\r\nin the world see his letter.\" Whereupon Card. La Bourdaisière rather\r\nirreverently observes: \"Je croy que le bonhomme pense que le roy\r\ndechiffre luy mesme ses lettres!\" a supposition singularly absurd in the\r\ncase of Henry, who hated _business_ of every kind. La Bourdaisière\r\nconceived it, on the other hand, to be for his own interest to take the\r\nfirst opportunity to give private information of the entire conversation\r\nto the constable, D'Andelot's uncle, and to advise him that it would go\r\nhard with his nephew, should he fall into Paul's hands (\"quil feroit un\r\nmauvais parti sil le tenoit\").

The expected victims of\r\nthe Spanish Inquisition, which he was to have established in France,\r\nbreathed more freely. It was not wonderful that the \"Calvinists,\"\r\naccording to an unfriendly historian, preached of the late monarch's\r\nfate as miraculous, and magnified it to their advantage;[729] for they\r\nsaw in it an interposition of the Almighty in their behalf, as signal as\r\nany illustrating the Jewish annals. Epigrams of no little merit were\r\ncomposed on the event, and were widely circulated. One likened the lance\r\nof Montgomery to the stone from David's sling, which became \"the\r\nunexpected salvation of the saints.\"[730] In another, Henry is the\r\nsoldier who pierces the Crucified through the side of those whom He\r\nstyles His members; but the impious weapon--such is Heaven's avenging\r\ndecree--shall be stained with the murderer's own blood.[731] These\r\nverses, and others like them, obtaining great currency, offended the\r\nears of the late king's favorites and of the devoted adherents of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church, who ceased not for years to pour forth\r\nlamentations over the untimely death of Henry the Second, and the\r\nill-starred peace with which it was so closely connected.[732]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The young king.]\r\n\r\nFrom the hands of a monarch in the prime of life, the sceptre had passed\r\ninto those of a stripling of sixteen, who was unfortunately endowed\r\nneither with his grandfather's intellect nor with his father's vigor of\r\nbody; but who inherited the enfeebled mental and physical constitution\r\nwhich was, perhaps, the result of the excesses of both. Although married\r\nto the beautiful Queen of Scots, some time before his father's reign\r\ncame to its tragic conclusion, Francis the Second exhibited few of the\r\ninstincts of a man and of a king, and showed himself to be even more of\r\na minor in intelligence than in years. Content to leave the cares of\r\ngovernment to his favorites, he sought only for repose and pleasure. Yet\r\nin this, as has been the case in more than one other instance, the most\r\nturbulent lot fell to him who would gladly have chosen quiet and sloth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of the constable's power.]\r\n\r\nWith Henry's last breath, the supremacy of Constable Montmorency in the\r\ncouncils of state came to an end. In view of the minority of the\r\nsuccessor to the throne, two measures were dictated by the customs of\r\nthe realm--the appointment of the nearest prince of royal blood as\r\nregent, and the immediate convocation of the States General to confirm\r\nthe selection, and to assign to the regent a competent council of\r\nstate.[733] Unfortunately for the interests of France during the\r\nsucceeding half-century, there were powerful personages interested in\r\nopposing this most natural and just arrangement, and there were specious\r\nexcuses behind which their ambitious designs might shelter themselves.\r\nThe Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise, with the queen mother,\r\nmaintained that Francis was in all respects competent to rule; that he\r\nhad already passed the age at which previous kings had assumed the reins\r\nof government; that the laws had prescribed the time from which the\r\nmajority of subjects, not of the monarch, should be reckoned;[734]\r\nthat, if too young himself to bear the entire burden of the\r\nadministration, he could delegate his authority to those of his own kin\r\nin whom he reposed implicit confidence. There was, therefore, no\r\nnecessity for establishing a regency, still less for assembling the\r\nStates General--an impolitic step even in the most quiet times, but\r\nfraught with special peril when grave dissensions threaten the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catharine de' Medici assumes an important part.]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of her eldest son to the throne, Catharine de' Medici\r\nfirst assumed a prominent position, although not an all-controlling\r\ninfluence at court. During the reign of Francis the First she had\r\nenjoyed little consideration. Her marriage with Henry, in 1533, had\r\ngiven, as we have seen, little satisfaction to the people, who believed\r\nthat her kinsman, Pope Clement the Seventh, had deceived the king; and\r\nFrancis himself, disappointed in his ambitious designs by the pontiff's\r\nspeedy death, looked upon her with little favor. For several years she\r\nhad borne no children, and Henry was urged to put her away on the ground\r\nof barrenness. Nor was she more happy when her prayers had been\r\nanswered, and a family of four sons and three daughters blessed her\r\nmarriage. Her husband's infatuation respecting Diana of Poitiers\r\nembittered her life when dauphiness, and compelled her as queen to\r\ntolerate the presence of the king's mistress, and pay her an insincere\r\nrespect. Excluded from all participation in the control of affairs, she\r\nfawned upon power where her ambitious nature would have sought to rule.\r\nConcealing her chagrin beneath an exterior of contentment, she\r\nexhibited, if we may believe the Venetian Soranzo, such benignity of\r\ndisposition, especially to her own countrymen, that it would be\r\nimpossible to convey an idea of the love entertained for her both by the\r\ncourt and by the entire kingdom.[735]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her timidity and dissimulation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: She dismisses Diana of Poitiers.]\r\n\r\nHypocrisy is the vice of timid natures. Such, we have the authority of a\r\ncontemporary, and one who knew her well, for stating the nature of\r\nCatharine was.[736] In her, however, dissimulation was a well-known\r\nfamily trait, which she possessed in common with her kinsman, Pope Leo\r\nthe Tenth, and all her house.[737] And it must be admitted that the\r\nidiosyncrasy had had a fair chance to develop during the five-and-twenty\r\nyears she had spent in France, threatened with repudiation, contemned as\r\nan Italian upstart, suffering the gravest insult at the hands of her\r\nhusband, but forced to dissemble, and to hide the pain his neglect gave\r\nher from the eyes of the curious world. Nor was her position altogether\r\nan easy one even now. It is true that her womanly revenge was gratified\r\nby the instant dismissal of the Duchess of Valentinois, who, if she\r\nretained the greater part of her ill-gotten wealth, owed it to the joint\r\ninfluence of Lorraine and Guise, whose younger brother, the Duke of\r\nAumale, had married Diana's daughter.[738] But her ambitious plan, while\r\nsecuring the authority of her children, to rule herself, was likely to\r\nbe frustrated by the pretensions of the two families of Montmoreney and\r\nGuise, raised by the late monarch to inordinate power in the state, and\r\nby the claim to the regency which Antoine of Bourbon-Vendôme, King of\r\nNavarre, might justly assert. To establish herself in opposition to all\r\nthese, her sagacity taught her was impossible. To prevail by allying\r\nherself to the most powerful and those from whom she could extort the\r\nbest terms seemed to be the most politic course. Her choice was quickly\r\nmade. It was unfortunate for France that her prudence partook more of\r\nthe character of low cunning than of true wisdom, and that, in seeking\r\na temporary ascendancy, she neglected the true interests of her own\r\nchildren and of the kingdom they inherited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her alliance with the Guises.]\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the convocation of the States and the appointment of\r\nthe King of Navarre as regent, but one course appeared to be open to\r\nCatharine: she must throw herself into the arms of the Guises. Only thus\r\ncould she become free from the odious dictation of the constable, under\r\nwhich she had groaned during her husband's reign. The Guises had had a\r\nnarrow escape, it was said; for Henry the Second, having tardily\r\ndiscovered the insatiable ambition of the Lorraine family, had\r\ndefinitely made up his mind to banish them from court.[739] Now availing\r\nthemselves of the great influence of their niece, Mary Stuart, over her\r\nroyal husband, the duke and the cardinal prepared, by a bold stroke, to\r\nbecome masters of the administration, and made to Catharine such liberal\r\noffers of power that she readily acquiesced in their plans.\r\n\r\nOf their formidable rivals, the King of Navarre was at a distance, in\r\nthe south. The constable alone was dangerously near. But an immemorial\r\ncustom furnished a convenient excuse for setting him aside. The body of\r\nthe deceased monarch must lie in state for the forty days previous to\r\nits interment, under protection of a guard of honor selected from among\r\nhis most trusty servants. Upon Montmorency, as grand master of the\r\npalace, devolved the chief care of his late Majesty's remains.[740]\r\nDelighted to have their principal rival so well occupied, the cardinal\r\nand the duke hastened from the Tournelles to secure the person of the\r\nliving monarch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Guises make themselves masters of the king.]\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates of the parliaments of France came, a few days later,\r\nto congratulate Francis on his accession, and inquired to whom they\r\nshould henceforth address themselves, the programme was already fully\r\narranged. The king had been well drilled in his little speech. He had,\r\nhe said, committed the direction of the state to the hands of his two\r\nuncles, and desired the same obedience to be shown to them as to\r\nhimself.[741]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The court fool's sensible remark.]\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal of Lorraine was intrusted with the civil administration and\r\nthe finances. His brother became head of the department of war, without\r\nthe title, but with the full powers, of constable.[742] Of royalty\r\nlittle was left Francis but the empty name.[743] There was sober truth\r\nlurking beneath the saucy remark of Brisquet, the court fool, who told\r\nFrancis that in the time of his Majesty's father he used to put up at\r\nthe \"_Crescent_,\" but at present he lodged at the \"_Three Kings_!\"[744]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montmorency retires to his own estates,]\r\n\r\nMontmorency did, indeed, attempt resistance to the assumption of\r\nabsolute authority which the Guises thus appropriated rather than\r\nreceived from the young monarch. But he was equally unsuccessful in\r\ninfluencing Francis and the queen mother. The former, when the constable\r\nwaited upon him in the Louvre, according to one story, scarcely deigned\r\nto look at him;[745] but, according to a more trustworthy account,\r\nreceived him with a show of cordiality, and assured him that he would\r\nmaintain his sons and his nephews, the Châtillons, in the dignities they\r\nhad attained under previous kings; at the same time, however, adding\r\nthat, in compassion for the constable's age and long services, he had\r\ndetermined to relieve him of his onerous charges, and to give him full\r\nliberty to retire to his estates and obtain needful rest and diversion!\r\nMontmorency was too much of a courtier to be taken unawares, and\r\npromptly replied that he had come expressly to beg as a favor what the\r\nking so graciously offered him.[746] Catharine, to whom he next paid his\r\nrespects, was less friendly, and, indeed, told him bluntly that, if she\r\nwere to do her duty, he would lose his head for his insolence to her and\r\nher children.[747] Meantime Montmorency had fared no better in his\r\nnegotiations with Antoine of Bourbon-Vendôme. The latter had not\r\nforgotten the little account made in the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis of\r\nhis wife's claim upon Spanish Navarre, and was indisposed to form a\r\nclose alliance with the chief negotiator. He preferred, he said, to\r\nstand aloof from a movement intended only to ruin \"his cousins of\r\nGuise.\"[748]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: where he maintains almost regal magnificence.]\r\n\r\nThe prudent old warrior, long since accustomed to the most startling\r\nvicissitudes, determined to bid adieu for a time to the royal court, and\r\nto retire to Chantilly, one of his paternal estates, where, in close\r\nproximity to the capital, he was accustomed to maintain an almost regal\r\nmagnificence.[749] So powerful a nobleman, the representative of a\r\nfamily which, from its antiquity and neighboring greatness, was held in\r\nspecial esteem by the Parisians, among the wealthiest of whom it boasted\r\nof having two thousand persons its tenants,[750] could not safely be\r\nattacked. Accordingly, Montmorency, after having faithfully performed\r\nhis duty as grand master, and deposited the remains of Henry in the\r\nabbey church of St. Denis, returned home with so numerous and powerful a\r\nretinue, that the king's appeared but small in comparison.[751]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decided measures of the new favorites.]\r\n\r\nThe power thus boldly seized by the cardinal and duke was energetically\r\nwielded. The partisans of the constable were at once removed from all\r\noffices of trust, and devoted adherents of the house of Lorraine were\r\nsubstituted. It was not difficult, if we may believe the historian of\r\nthis reign, to bring the parliaments into similar subjection. The system\r\nof venality introduced by Cardinal Duprat had so corrupted the highest\r\ncourts of justice that they had lost all traces of their former noble\r\nindependence. The sons of usurers sat in places which had been occupied\r\nby the most distinguished jurisconsults of the kingdom, and so debased\r\nthe administration of law that, in the eye of a contemporary,\r\nparliament had become a den of robbers.[752] Marshal de St. André made\r\nproposals, which were accepted, to form an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance with the Guises, promising to give his only daughter in\r\nmarriage to a member of that family, and to settle upon her the immense\r\nproperty which he had accumulated during the last reign by extortion and\r\nconfiscations, retaining for himself only the life interest.[753] In\r\norder to rid the court of the princes of the blood, Condé was sent on a\r\nmission to Flanders, to confirm the peace, and the Prince of\r\nLa-Roche-sur-Yon and the Cardinal of Bourbon were deputed to accompany\r\nPrincess Elizabeth, Philip's bride, to the Spanish frontier.[754]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine of Bourbon, King of Navarre.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His remissness and pusillanimity.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His desire to be indemnified for Navarre.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the eyes not only of the reformers, who had no more inveterate\r\nenemies than the Guises, but also of the friends of order, whatever\r\ntheir creed might be, were anxiously directed to Antoine, King of\r\nNavarre. His younger brother, Condé, his cousin, La Roche-sur-Yon, and\r\nother great nobles came to meet him at Vendôme, and set forth the\r\ndisastrous consequences not only to them, but to their children and to\r\nthe entire kingdom, that would certainly follow the base surrender of\r\nthe government into the hands of foreigners.[755] Earnestly was he\r\nreminded of his undeniable claim to the regency, and entreated to\r\ndispossess the usurpers. Nor did the weak prince openly disregard the\r\nprayers of the ministers and people, who begged him to view his\r\ndeliverance from so many perils as intended not merely to advance his\r\nown personal interests, but to secure the welfare of those whose tenets\r\nhe had at heart espoused. But, where vigorous and instantaneous action\r\nwas requisite, he exhibited only supineness and delay. His manly body\r\ncontained a womanish soul.[756] His intimate counsellors were already\r\nin the secret pay of the Guises, and, in return for the large rewards\r\npromised,[757] disclosed every movement and plan of their master, while\r\nthey gave him such advice as was calculated to render all his\r\nundertakings abortive.[758] When, after long hesitation, he at length\r\nleft for St. Germain, he advanced slowly and by short stages,\r\nintimidated by the example of the treason of the Constable of Bourbon,\r\nin the reign of Francis the First, of the consequences of which the\r\nagents of his enemies did not fail frequently to remind him, and\r\napprehensive of the intentions of Philip upon his small principality of\r\nBéarn.[759] It is true that at Poitiers, where he was waited upon by a\r\nlarge deputation of ministers from Paris, Orleans, Tours, and other\r\nprincipal cities, and urged, by renouncing the mass and openly espousing\r\nthe cause of God, to fulfil the expectations of the persecuted faithful,\r\nhe returned a favorable reply, and declared that, if he still conformed\r\nto an idolatry which he abhorred, it was in order not to lose the only\r\nmeans of being serviceable to them. The sturdy men, who admitted no\r\ncompromises in matters of conscience, and had for years been exposing\r\ntheir bodies to the peril of the flames or gibbet, manfully replied\r\nthat, if he would find God propitious, he must not endeavor to make his\r\nown terms with Him; and that his own experience of divine protection\r\nought to prevent him from temporizing.[760] To Henry Killigrew, who came\r\nto meet him at Vendôme with a friendly message from Queen Elizabeth, he\r\nspoke with more definiteness and volunteered the expression of the most\r\npious intentions. He declared \"that he thought that God had hitherto\r\npreserved her Majesty from so many dangers for the setting forth of His\r\nword; and, he trusted, had done the like by him, in having preserved\r\nhim from many perils; and how desirous he was to set forth religion as\r\nmuch as was in him; which he wished might be for the quiet, and setting\r\nforth of God's glory through Christendom (which he minded for his part)\r\nand to the discouragement of such as should stand in contrary.\"[761] But\r\nthe hopes which Antoine thus held forth were delusive. The trusty agent\r\nof the Guises had already notified them that, so far as he could learn,\r\nNavarre's principal desire was to be cordially received by the king and\r\nhis council, in order that the Spanish visitors at Paris might carry\r\nhome to their master so favorable a report that Philip, convinced that\r\nAntoine was no insignificant personage in France,[762] _might condescend\r\nto indemnify him for the wrong he had done him_![763]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is received at court with studied discourtesy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine is deaf to remonstrance.]\r\n\r\nBut if the King of Navarre expected to make any deep impression upon the\r\nsubjects of Philip through the friendly reception which he thus\r\nsolicited by the most craven abasement, his arrival at St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye speedily undeceived him. Francis, instead of meeting him\r\non his approach, in accordance with the customary rules of royal\r\ncourtesy, and entertaining him graciously as they rode side by side to\r\nthe palace, was purposely taken in an opposite direction on a hunting\r\nexcursion. Humiliated by this neglect, the adherents of Navarre were\r\nstill more annoyed when they found that no chamber had been set apart in\r\nthe castle for the first prince of the blood, to whom immemorial usage\r\nconceded the apartments next to those of the reigning monarch. But\r\nneither these insults, nor the contemptuous treatment he received at the\r\nhands of the courtiers, by whom he was compelled to make every advance,\r\nwere sufficient to arouse the prince to any noble resolution.[764] To\r\nregain the kingdom of which, by his marriage with Jeanne d'Albret, he\r\nhad become the titular sovereign, was the great ambition of his life.\r\nThis was impracticable without the support of the French court. He could\r\nnot, therefore, afford to break with the all-powerful Guises. What were\r\nthe prerogatives of the first prince of the blood in the administration\r\nof the French government, in comparison with the absolute sovereignty of\r\nthe little kingdom on either slope of the Pyrenees? In vain did his\r\nfaithful attendants remonstrate with him, and portray the path of honor\r\nas that of ultimate success and safety. Disgusted at his unmanly\r\nweakness, they returned crestfallen to their homes, or threw up his\r\nservice for that of noblemen who, if ancient enemies, could at least\r\nprove themselves valuable and trustworthy patrons. The partisans of the\r\nReformation, after waiting fruitlessly to hear a single word uttered in\r\nbehalf of the churches, now everywhere rapidly multiplying, but still\r\nsubjected to bitter persecution, disappointed, but full of faith in God,\r\nrenounced their trust in princes, and awaited a deliverance, in Heaven's\r\nown time, from a higher source. Theodore Beza cited Navarre's shameful\r\nfall as a new and signal illustration of our Lord's own words: \"A rich\r\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven!\"[765]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meets fresh indignities.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip offers Catharine assistance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine's appeals to Philip II.]\r\n\r\nBut the abasement of this irresolute prince was not yet complete.\r\nSubmitting to the open contempt in which he was held, he not only took\r\npart in the solemn ceremony of the new king's anointing at Rheims,[766]\r\nwhere his inferiors were preferred to him, but attended the meetings of\r\nthe royal council, where he was little wanted. At one of these sessions\r\na fresh indignity was put upon him. Alarmed by the rising murmurs\r\nagainst the illegal rule of the Guises, Catharine had taken the first of\r\na series of disgraceful steps, by invoking the intervention of a foreign\r\nprince in the affairs of France. She implored her royal son-in-law of\r\nSpain to lend her his support against the King of Navarre and other\r\nprinces, who were desirous of \"reducing her to the condition of a\r\nchambermaid,\" and of disturbing an otherwise peaceful country. Philip\r\nreplied by an offer of his own assistance and of forty thousand men whom\r\nhe professed to hold in readiness for a campaign against the rebels that\r\nmeditated the overthrow of the French monarchy. The letter of his\r\nCatholic Majesty was purposely read in full council, in the hearing of\r\nNavarre. But, instead of arousing his indignation, it only excited new\r\nfears for the safety of his wife's dominions, and made him more\r\nsubmissively kiss the rod of iron with which the Guises ruled him.[767]\r\nSoon afterward he returned to Béarn, whence he made, before the close of\r\nthe year, two ineffectual attempts to move the inflexible determination\r\nof Philip. In October he sent to the court of Spain Pierre, the Bastard\r\nof Navarre, who obtained the promise of an equivalent for Navarre, but\r\nwas unable to secure any decided answer to his request for the island of\r\nSardinia. But when, in December, Antoine despatched a second messenger,\r\nat the suggestion of the Duke of Albuquerque, to solicit permission for\r\nhimself and Queen Jeanne to visit the King of Spain and \"kiss his\r\n[Philip's] hand,\" with the view of obtaining such \"an indemnity for his\r\nkingdom as some secret injunction of the emperor [Charles the Fifth],\r\ntoward the end of his days, or his own conscience\" might have suggested,\r\nthe unfortunate prince discovered in how base and humiliating a manner\r\nhe had been duped. It was not worth his while--such was the rude\r\nreply--for Antoine to expose his wife and himself to the fatigue of so\r\nlong a journey, since no other answer could be given him than that which\r\nhad been given to his predecessors, and to himself on the occasion of\r\nthe late treaty of peace.[768] Was it with the expectation of such\r\nrewards that the first prince of the blood had pusillanimously declined\r\nto assert the rights of his rank and family, and to espouse the cause of\r\nthe persecuted?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The persecution continues.]\r\n\r\nFor persecuted the Protestants continued to be. The death of Henry did\r\nnot for an instant interrupt the work of searching for and punishing\r\nreputed heretics. The brief term must be improved, during which the\r\nSpaniards and other strangers who had come to witness the marriage\r\nfestivities were still present, to fulfil the promises given to the\r\nDukes of Alva and Savoy, and demonstrate the catholicity of the Very\r\nChristian King.[769] Three days after the fatal termination of Henry's\r\nwound in the tournament, the English ambassador wrote to his government:\r\n\"In the midst of all these great matters and business, they here do not\r\nstay to make persecution and sacrifice of poor souls: for the twelfth of\r\nthis present, two men and one woman were executed for religion; and the\r\nthirteenth of the same there was proclamation made by the sound of\r\ntrumpet, that all such as should speak either against the church or the\r\nreligion now used in France should be brought before the bishops of the\r\ndioceses, and they to do execution upon them.\"[770] On the fourteenth of\r\nJuly, only four days after Henry's death, new steps were taken to bring\r\nto trial the five counsellors of parliament arrested on the day of the\r\nfamous \"Mercuriale.\" An account of these proceedings, and in particular\r\nof those instituted against Anne du Bourg, will presently be given.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Denunciation and treachery at Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe increase of the Protestants in France during the past few months had\r\nbeen great. Even in the capital the progress of the new doctrines could\r\nnot be hidden; but so carefully had the veil of secrecy been drawn over\r\nthe conventicles, that, until a short time before Henry's death, the\r\nnames and residences of the Parisian reformers had been almost entirely\r\nunknown to the argus-eyed clergy. But the treachery of one De\r\nRussanges--a goldsmith, who, for appropriating the charitable\r\ncontributions of the church, had been deposed from the\r\neldership--furnished to the enemy a complete list of the ministers,\r\nelders, and other principal men among the Protestants.[771] The\r\ninformation thus obtained was for a time left unimproved, in consequence\r\nof the sudden removal of the king; but the zeal of the chief persecutors\r\nhad not cooled down. New and more stringent edicts were published,\r\nconsigning to the flames, without form of process, all that made or\r\nattended conventicles. Liberal rewards were offered to stimulate\r\ndenunciation. Domiciliary visits were enjoined upon the proper officers.\r\nExtraordinary powers were given to the \"lieutenant-criminel\" and a few\r\nof the counsellors of the Châtelet, known to be inimical to the \"new\r\ndoctrines,\" to act during the recess of parliament. It was even ordained\r\nby letters-patent of the king, that the very houses in which unlawful\r\nassemblages had taken place by night and the Lord's Supper had been\r\nprofanely administered contrary to the rites of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, should be razed to the ground, and never rebuilt, as a memorial\r\nfor all time.[772] The church followed the example of the civil power.\r\nThe parishes resounded with excommunications of all that failed to\r\nreveal the heretical sentiments of their acquaintance, and with\r\nexhortations to watchfulness.[773] Parliament itself had lent its\r\nauthority to the inquisitorial work, by enjoining upon owners or\r\noccupants of houses in the city or suburbs \"to make diligent inquiry as\r\nto the good and Christian life\" of such as lodged with them. In\r\nparticular they were to inform against such as did not attend upon\r\ndivine worship in the churches, especially upon feast-days.[774]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other informers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"La petite Genève\" a scene of pillage.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to De Russanges other informers were added. One was a weak\r\nand unstable man whom persecution had once before--in the famous year of\r\nthe Placards--driven to the basest of offices. Among others two\r\napprentices, brought forward to testify against the Protestant employers\r\nwho had dismissed them, were pliant instruments in the hands of the\r\nheretic-hunters. By a well-concerted movement a simultaneous descent was\r\nmade, and entire families were put under arrest.[775] In some places,\r\nhowever, an unexpected resistance was encountered. The guests of one\r\nVisconte, with whom travellers from Switzerland and Germany frequently\r\nlodged, supposed the house to be attacked by robbers, and defended\r\nthemselves with such bravery against their assailants, that they\r\neffected their retreat in safety. Their host's wife and his aged father\r\nalone were taken into custody. A dressed capon and some uncooked meat\r\nfound in the larder--it was on a Friday that the incursion was\r\nmade--graced the triumph of the captors. \"Little Geneva,\" as that\r\nportion of the Faubourg St. Germain-des-Prés most frequented by\r\nProtestants was familiarly called, became a scene of indiscriminate\r\npillage. The valuables of those who, through fear, had absented\r\nthemselves, were greedily appropriated by the officials of the Châtelet\r\nand other courts, or fell into the hands of an unorganized force of\r\nrobbers who gleaned what the others had left behind. In a day the rich\r\nbecame poor and the poor became rich. The depredations extended to other\r\nparts of the city where the existence of heresy or wealth was suspected.\r\nParis, we are told, resembled a city taken by assault. Everywhere armed\r\nmen on foot or on horseback were leading to prison men, women, and\r\nchildren of all ranks. The thoroughfares were clogged by wagons laden\r\nwith furniture and other spoils. The street-corners were filled with\r\nplunder offered for sale. Never before, even when the inhabitants had\r\nfled panic-stricken from Paris in time of war, had the price of such\r\ncommodities been so low. Numbers of little children, roaming the streets\r\nand ready to die of hunger, formed a pitiful accompaniment to the scene.\r\nBut the tender mercies of the populace were cruel, and few dared to give\r\na \"Lutheran\" shelter through fear of incurring extreme danger. The most\r\nincredible tales of midnight orgies were studiously circulated among the\r\nsimple-minded people, and served to inflame yet more the lust of cruelty\r\nand gain.[776]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Protestants appeal to the queen mother.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: She gives them encouragement.]\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the Protestants had recourse to the queen mother.\r\nAfraid to trust herself entirely to the Guises, the crafty Italian had,\r\nfrom the very commencement of the reign, sought to leave open a retreat\r\nin case a change should become necessary. And, in truth, jealousy of the\r\ncardinal and his brother, who seemed disposed to keep all the power in\r\ntheir own hands, while giving Catharine only a semblance of authority,\r\nwas combined in her mind with hatred of Mary of Scots, their niece,[777]\r\nwhose influence was as powerful with her son and as adverse to herself\r\nas that of Diana of Poitiers had been with her husband. Scarcely had the\r\nreformers perceived, by the zeal with which Du Bourg's trial was\r\npressed, that the death of Henry had not bettered their condition, when\r\nthey implored the Prince of Condé, his mother-in-law, Madame de Roye,\r\nand Admiral Coligny, to intercede in their behalf with Catharine. At the\r\nsuggestion of the latter, they even addressed her a letter, in which\r\nthey informed her of the great hopes they had in the preceding reign\r\nfounded upon her kind and gentle disposition, and the prayers they had\r\noffered to God that she might prove a second Esther. They entreated her\r\nto prevent the new reign from being defiled with innocent blood, and to\r\navert the anger of Heaven, which could only be appeased by putting an\r\nend to persecution. The crafty queen, desirous of retaining an influence\r\nthat might one day be of great service, and solicitous, at any rate, of\r\nobtaining their confidence, at first assumed an offended tone. \"With\r\nwhat am I menaced?\" she said. \"For what greater evil could God do me\r\nthan He has done, removing him whom I loved and prized the most?\" But\r\npresently becoming more gracious, she promised the noble suppliants to\r\ncause the persecution to cease, if the Protestants would intermit their\r\nconventicles and live quietly and without scandal.[778] A private letter\r\nof remonstrance, written by a gentleman formerly in the service of Queen\r\nMargaret of Navarre, is said to have had some weight in extorting this\r\npledge. He reminded her that her present evil advisers were the same\r\npersons who had, in the first years of her married life, been advocates\r\nof her repudiation; that then in her affliction she had recourse to God,\r\nwhose word she had read, choosing as her favorite psalm the 141st,\r\nalbeit not of Marot's translating.[779] Her prayers had been answered in\r\nthe birth of her children. But the cardinal had banished the psalm-book\r\nfrom the palace, and introduced the immodest songs of Horace and other\r\nlewd poets; and from that time there had come upon her a succession of\r\nmisfortunes. Finally, he begged her to drive away the usurpers of the\r\nplace that rightfully belonged to the princes of royal blood, and to\r\nbring up her children after the example of good king Josiah.[780]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A second and more urgent address.]\r\n\r\nBut the promises of Catharine were given only to be broken. Finding the\r\natrocious persecution still in operation, and seeing themselves hunted\r\nin their houses, the Protestants again approached her. They denounced\r\nthe anger of God who would not leave Du Bourg unavenged. They warned her\r\nof the danger that over-much oppression would breed revolt--not on the\r\npart of those who had embraced the reformed doctrines as taught in the\r\nGospel, from whom she might expect all obedience--but from others, a\r\nhundred-fold more numerous, whose eyes were open to the abuses of the\r\npapacy, but who, not having submitted themselves to the discipline of\r\nthe church, would not brook persecution. The embankment, it was to be\r\nfeared, might give way to the violence of the pressure, and the pent-up\r\nwaters pour themselves abroad, carrying devastation and ruin to all the\r\nneighboring lands.[781] The implied menace aroused the affected\r\nindignation of Catharine; but, loth to lose her hold upon the\r\nProtestants, she again professed her pity for a sect whose adherents\r\nwent to the most cruel torments as cheerfully as to a wedding feast, and\r\nshe expressed a desire to have an interview with one of their ministers.\r\nThe Protestants did their part, but Catharine failed to keep the\r\nappointment; and all that the minister could effect was to convey to her\r\na copy of the yet unpublished Confession of Faith of the French\r\nChurches, which, it is more than likely, she never read.[782]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pretended orgies in \"la petite Genève.\"]\r\n\r\nThe insincerity of the queen mother's professions was by this time\r\nsufficiently apparent; yet the Protestants may be excused for applying,\r\nin their distress, to any one in power who made even a _show_ of\r\ncompassionate feelings. The outrages visited upon the inhabitants of \"la\r\npetite Genève\" were brought to her notice, and she deigned to inquire\r\ninto their occasion. But Charles of Lorraine had a ready mode of\r\nquieting her curiosity. Some verses found among the effects of the\r\nProtestants made mention of the death of Henry as an instance of the\r\ndivine retribution. Other lines condemned Catharine for her excessive\r\ncomplaisance to the cardinal. These were first placed in her hands. Then\r\nthe two apprentices, after having been well drilled in their lesson,\r\nwere brought into her presence. It was a fearful tale they told, and\r\nmuch did it shock the ears of the virtuous Catharine. They pretended to\r\ndescribe orgies at which they had been present. In particular they\r\nremembered a conventicle of Protestants in the house of one\r\nTrouillas,[783] an advocate, held on Thursday of Holy Week. A great\r\nnumber of men and women, married and unmarried, had been present. The\r\nhour was about midnight. The sectaries had first listened to their\r\npreaching. Then a pig had been eaten in lieu of the paschal lamb.\r\nFinally the lamp had been extinguished, and indiscriminate lewdness\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The device succeeds.]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the boys--for such they were in years, if not in\r\nproficiency in vice--was enforced and embellished in the queen mother's\r\nhearing by the Cardinal of Lorraine. The trick had the desired effect.\r\nBelieving, or feigning to believe, the improbable story, Catharine\r\nconsented that the persecution of the \"Christaudins\" should proceed;\r\nwhile to some of her maids of honor, strongly suspected of leaning to\r\nthe doctrines of the Reformation, she declared that she gave such full\r\ncredit to this information, that, were she certain that they were\r\nProtestants, she would not hesitate, whatever favor or friendship she\r\nhad hitherto borne them, to have them put to death. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, for the calumniated sect, there were among its adherents those\r\nwho prized honor above life. Trouillas and his family, although among\r\nthe number of those who had made good their escape, voluntarily returned\r\nand gave themselves into the hands of the civil authorities. When the\r\nlatter would have put them on trial for their alleged heresy, they\r\ndeclined to answer to the charges on this point until the slanderous\r\naccusations affecting their personal morals had been investigated. The\r\nexamination not only completely vindicated their character and revealed\r\nthe grossness of the imposture of which they were the innocent victims,\r\nbut exhibited the unpleasant fact that an attempt had been made to\r\ncorrupt witnesses by representing to them that, against such execrable\r\nwretches as the accursed \"Lutherans,\" it was a meritorious act to allege\r\neven what was false.[784] It is perhaps superfluous to add that\r\nTrouillas, in spite of his manly and successful defence, was unable to\r\nsecure the punishment of his accusers. In fact, while the latter\r\nremained at large, both he and his family were kept in prison, until\r\nliberated, without satisfaction for the insult received, upon the\r\npublication of the edict of amnesty of March, 1560.[785]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cruelty of the populace.]\r\n\r\nIt would be a task neither easy nor altogether agreeable to chronicle\r\nthe executions of Protestants in various cities of the realm. \"Never,\"\r\nwrote Hubert Languet, \"have the papists raged so; never before was there\r\na more cruel persecution. The prisons are full of wretched men. The\r\nwoods and solitary places can scarce contain the fugitives.\"[786] The\r\nParliaments of Toulouse and Aix, as usual, vied in ferocity with that of\r\nParis, where the Guises had not long since restored the \"chambre\r\nardente.\"[787] But the populace of Paris surpassed the judges in\r\nenvenomed hatred. Not content with applauding the slow roasting of those\r\nwhom the courts had condemned to this torture, they sought to aggravate\r\nthe barbarity of other sentences. In August, 1559, a young carpenter was\r\ntaken from prison to suffer death for his heretical views. He was to\r\nhave been strangled and then burned. The mob, however, resented the\r\nleniency, or were indignant that a pleasant show should lose one-half\r\nof its attraction. They therefore resolved to defraud the hangman of his\r\nshare in the work, and suspended the youth, yet living, above the\r\nroaring flames.[788]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Traps for heretics.]\r\n\r\nAn ingenious method was devised for the detection of the reformers. At\r\nalmost every street-corner a picture or image of the Virgin Mary, or of\r\nsome one of the saints, was set up, crowned with chaplets of flowers,\r\nand with waxen tapers burning in its honor. Around this object of\r\ndevotion were collected at all hours a crowd of porters, water-carriers,\r\nand the very dregs of the populace, boisterously singing the praises of\r\nthe saint. Woe to the unlucky wight who, purposely or through\r\nnegligence, failed to doff his hat or drop a coin into the box placed in\r\nconvenient proximity! He was an impious man, a heretic, and fortunate\r\nwas it for him if he escaped with his life. To refuse to swell the\r\ncollection of the monk or nun that came to a man's own door to solicit\r\nfunds for the trial of the Protestants, was equally perilous. In short,\r\nit was no unfrequent device for a debtor to get rid of the importunity\r\nof his creditor by raising the cry, \"Au Christaudin, an Luthérien!\" It\r\nwent hard with the former if he did not both free himself from debt and\r\nspoil his creditor.[789]\r\n\r\nIt is time, however, that we should turn to chronicle the fortunes of a\r\nmore illustrious victim--the most illustrious victim, in fact, of the\r\nfirst period of French Protestantism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trial of President Anne du Bourg.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His successive appeals.]\r\n\r\nAmong the five counsellors of parliament arrested by Henry's orders at\r\nthe \"Mercuriale,\" as related in a previous chapter, Anne du Bourg had\r\nincurred his special displeasure by his fearless harangue, and with Du\r\nBourg the trials began. A special commission was appointed for the\r\npurpose, consisting of President St. André, a _maître de requêtes_ and\r\ntwo counsellors of parliament, Du Bellay, Bishop of Paris, and\r\nDemochares, Inquisitor of the Faith. Brought before it, Du Bourg refused\r\nto plead, asserting his prerogative to be judged only by the united\r\nchambers of parliament. Letters-patent were therefore obtained from\r\nHenry, ordering the prisoner to acknowledge the authority of the\r\ncommission, under pain of being declared guilty of heresy and of\r\ntreason. Upon the results of the interrogatories, the Bishop of Paris\r\ndeclared Du Bourg a heretic, ordering him to be degraded from those holy\r\norders which he had assumed, and then delivered over to the secular arm.\r\nFrom this sentence Du Bourg appealed to parliament, on the ground that\r\nit was an abuse of ecclesiastical power.[790] The judges--among whom his\r\nmost determined enemies, the Cardinal of Lorraine and Cardinal Bertrand\r\n(the latter as Keeper of the Seals) were not ashamed to take their\r\nseats--rejected his appeal, and declared that there had been no abuse.\r\n\r\nFrom the sentence given by the Bishop of Paris, Du Bourg next appealed\r\nto the Archbishop of Sens, his superior; and when the latter had\r\nconfirmed his suffragan's decision, Du Bourg again had recourse to\r\nparliament. He pleaded that it was a violation of the very spirit of the\r\nlaw that the same person, acting (as did Bertrand) as Archbishop of\r\nSens, should adjudicate upon a case which he had already acted upon in\r\nthe capacity of Keeper of the Seals and Chief Justice of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His officious advocate.]\r\n\r\nThe counsel whom Chancellor Olivier, newly reinstated in his office by\r\nFrancis the Second, assigned to Du Bourg, at his earnest request, put\r\nforth strenuous exertions to induce his client to recant. Failing in\r\nthis, he extorted a promise not to interrupt him in the defence he was\r\nabout to make. Thereupon the officious advocate, after pleading, it is\r\ntrue, the injustice of the preceding trial, confessed his client's\r\ngrievous spiritual errors, and desired, in his name, reconciliation with\r\nthe church. The judges, glad to seize the opportunity of ridding\r\nthemselves of a disagreeable case, promptly remanded the prisoner, and\r\nwere about to depute two of their number to solicit the king's pardon in\r\nhis behalf. At this moment a communication arrived, signed by Du Bourg,\r\ndisavowing his counsel's admissions, persisting in his appeal and in the\r\nconfession of his faith, which he was now ready to seal with his blood,\r\nand humbly begging the forgiveness of God for the cowardice of which he\r\naccused himself. It is needless to say that his appeal was rejected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Bourg's message to the Protestants of Paris.]\r\n\r\nAgain Du Bourg appealed from the Archbishop of Sens to the Archbishop of\r\nLyons, \"Primate of _all_ the Gauls,\" and from his unfavorable decision\r\nto the parliament. Meanwhile he wrote to the Protestants of Paris, who\r\nwatched his course with the deepest interest, recognizing the important\r\ninfluence which his firmness or his apostasy must exert on the interests\r\nof truth, and begged them not to be scandalized by a course that might\r\nappear to proceed from craven fear of death. If he thus had recourse to\r\nthe judgments of the Pope's tools, he said, it was not through undue\r\nsolicitude for life, nor because he in any wise approved their doctrine;\r\nbut that he might have the better opportunity to make known his faith in\r\nas many places as possible, and prove that he had not precipitated his\r\nown destruction, by failing to make use of all legitimate means of\r\nacquittal. As for himself, he felt that he had been so strengthened by\r\nGod's grace, that the day of his death was an object of desire, which he\r\nvery joyfully awaited.[791]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Du Bourg in the Bastile.]\r\n\r\nAt length the last appeal was rejected, and Du Bourg, under sentence of\r\ndeath, was remanded to the Bastile, to await the pleasure of the king.\r\nMany months had elapsed since his arrest, but his courage had risen with\r\nthe trials he was called to face. To prevent any attempt to rescue him\r\nhe had at one time been shut up in an iron cage, and the very passers-by\r\nhad been forbidden to tarry and look up at the grim walls of the prison.\r\nBut the captive was less solicitous to escape than his captors were to\r\ndetain him. He resolutely declined to avail himself of a bull obtained\r\nfor him from Rome by friends, through liberal payment of money, and\r\nopening the way for an appeal from the Primate of France to the Pope\r\nhimself. The prison walls, it is said, resounded with the joyful psalms\r\nand hymns which he sang, to the accompaniment of the lute.[792]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intercession of the Elector Palatine.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His pathetic speech.]\r\n\r\nA few days before Christmas the order was given for his execution. Two\r\nevents determined the Cardinal of Lorraine: the assassination of\r\nPresident Minard, one of Du Bourg's judges, whose death was caused,\r\ndoubtless, by the hand of one of the many whom he had wronged, although\r\nby some ascribed to the Protestants;[793] and the intercession of the\r\nElector Palatine,[794] who by a special embassy had expressed the\r\ndesire to make Du Bourg a professor of law in his university at\r\nHeidelberg. Unwilling to expose himself to further importunities from\r\nabroad which he was resolved to discourage, the prelate gave the signal\r\nfor the closing of the tragic scene. The sentence was announced to Du\r\nBourg in his cell by the deputed judges. It was that he should forthwith\r\nbe taken to the place of execution and suspended above the flames until\r\nlife should be extinct. But the courage of Du Bourg did not fail him.\r\nWhen the counsellors had fulfilled their commission and were about to\r\nretire, the fettered prisoner detained them, and uttered a speech of\r\nexquisite pathos. It was the bewitching spirit of delusion, he said, the\r\nmessenger of hell, the capital enemy of truth, that had accused him\r\nbefore them, because he had abandoned her. To that evil spirit had they\r\ntoo readily listened and condemned him and others like him, the children\r\nof the God of infinite mercy. It was in no sense disobedience to their\r\nprince that they refused to offer sacrifice to Baal. Was it disloyalty\r\nto be willing to give up to their sovereign everything, even to the last\r\ngarment they possessed; to pray for the prosperity and peace of his\r\nrealm, and that all superstition and idolatry might be banished from its\r\nborders; to entreat the Almighty to fill him and those under him in\r\nauthority with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual\r\nunderstanding, that they might walk worthy of the Lord unto all\r\npleasing? Was it not rather disobedience to dishonor and anger God by\r\nimpiety and blasphemy, and by transferring His glory to another?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He depicts the constancy of the victims.]\r\n\r\nThe judges themselves were moved to tears as the prisoner pictured the\r\nfearful tortures which were daily inflicted upon the innocent\r\nProtestants at the bidding of that \"red Phalaris,\" the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine.[795] \"Sufferings do not intimidate them,\" he said, \"insults do\r\nnot weaken them, satisfying their honor by death. So that the proverb\r\nsuits you well, gentlemen: the conqueror dies, and the vanquished\r\nlaments.... No, no, none shall be able to separate us from Christ,\r\nwhatever snares are laid for us, whatever ills our bodies may endure. We\r\nknow that we have long been like lambs led to the slaughter. Let them,\r\ntherefore, slay us, let them break us in pieces; for all that, the\r\nLord's dead will not cease to live, and we shall rise in a common\r\nresurrection. I am a Christian, yes, I am a Christian. I will cry yet\r\nlouder, when I die, for the glory of my Lord Jesus Christ! And since it\r\nis so, why do I tarry? Lay hands upon me, executioner, and lead me to\r\nthe gallows.\" Then resuming his address to his judges, he protested at\r\ngreat length that he died at their hands only for his unwillingness to\r\nrecognize other justification, grace, merit, intercession, satisfaction,\r\nor salvation than in Jesus Christ. \"Put an end, put an end,\" he cried,\r\n\"to your burnings, and return to the Lord with amendment of life, that\r\nyour sins may be wiped away. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the\r\nunrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he\r\nwill have mercy upon him. Live, then, and meditate upon this, O\r\nsenators; and I go to die!\"[796]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His death.]\r\n\r\nHe was led under a strong guard to the Place de Grève. A vast concourse\r\nof people had assembled to witness the death of the illustrious victim.\r\n\"My friends,\" he cried, as with assured countenance he prepared for the\r\nexecution, \"I am here not as a thief or a robber, but for the Gospel.\"\r\nThe people listened with breathless interest to the harangue he made\r\nthem from the scaffold. Then, before he died, he exclaimed again and\r\nagain: \"My God, forsake me not, that I may not forsake Thee!\" The judges\r\ndid him the favor of permitting him to be strangled before he was\r\nburned. Perhaps this was done that the story might be circulated that he\r\nhad at the last moment recanted; but his refusal to kiss the crucifix\r\nwhich was offered him was a visible proof to the contrary.[797] Thus he\r\ndied, displaying, according to a friendly historian,[798] \"the most\r\nadmirable constancy shown by any that have suffered for this cause.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His death a disastrous blow to the established church.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Account of an eye-witness.]\r\n\r\nDu Bourg's martyrdom was the most terrible blow the established church\r\nhad ever received in France. Never had a more disastrous blunder been\r\ncommitted by the Guises, than when they stirred Henry to imprison and\r\ntry, and Francis to execute, the most virtuous member of the Parisian\r\nsenate. Such strength of principle in the midst of affliction, such\r\nfortitude upon the brink of death, had never been seen before. The\r\nwitnesses of the execution never forgot the scene. Thousands who had\r\nnever before wavered in their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church,\r\nresolved that day to investigate the truth of the faith which had given\r\nhim so signal a victory over death. \"I remember,\" writes the most\r\nenvenomed enemy of the Protestants that ever undertook to write their\r\nhistory, \"when Anne Du Bourg, counsellor in the Parliament of Paris, was\r\nburned, that all Paris was astonished at the constancy of the man. As we\r\nreturned to our colleges from the execution, we were melted in tears;\r\nand we pleaded his cause, after his death, anathematizing those unjust\r\njudges who had justly condemned him. His sermon at the gallows and upon\r\nthe funeral pile did more harm than a hundred ministers could have\r\ndone.\"[799]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He deplores the result.]\r\n\r\nBut the martyrdom of Du Bourg was not a solitary case. The same\r\nconsequences flowed from the public execution of others, whose dying\r\nwords and actions shook to its very foundations the fabric of\r\nsuperstition reared in many a spectator's heart. Florimond de Ræmond,\r\nhimself an advocate of persecution in the abstract, noticed and deplored\r\nthe inevitable result. \"Meanwhile funeral piles were kindled in all\r\ndirections. But as, on the one hand, the severity of justice and of the\r\nlaws restrained the people in their duty, so the incredible obstinacy of\r\nthose who were led to execution, and who suffered their lives to be\r\ntaken from them rather than their opinions, amazed many. For who can\r\nabstain from wonder when simple women willingly undergo tortures in\r\norder to give a proof of their faith, and, while led to death, call upon\r\nJesus Christ their Saviour, and sing psalms; when maidens hasten to the\r\nmost excruciating torments with greater alacrity than to their nuptials;\r\nwhen men leap for joy at the terrible sight of the preparations for\r\nexecution, and, half-burned, from the funeral pile mock the authors of\r\ntheir sufferings; when, with indomitable strength of courage and joyful\r\ncountenance, they endure the lacerating of their bodies by means of\r\nheated pincers; when, in short, like an immovable rock, they receive and\r\nbreak all the billows of the most bitter sufferings at the hands of the\r\nexecutioner, and, like those who have eaten the Sardinian herb, die\r\nlaughing? The lamentable sight of such incredible constancy as this\r\ncreated no little doubt in the minds not only of the simple, but of men\r\nof authority. For they could not believe that cause to be bad for which\r\ndeath was so willingly undergone. Others pitied the miserable, and\r\nburned with indignation against their persecutors. Whenever they beheld\r\nthe blackened stakes with the chains attached--memorials of\r\nexecutions--they could not restrain their tears. The desire consequently\r\nseized many to read their books, and to become acquainted with the\r\nfoundations of the faith from which it seemed impossible to tear them by\r\nthe most refined tortures.... Why need I say more? The greater the\r\nnumber of those who were consigned to the flames, the greater the number\r\nof those who seemed to spring from their ashes.\"[800]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fate of the remaining judges.]\r\n\r\nOf the five counsellors of parliament arrested by the late king's\r\norders, Du Bourg was the only martyr. By the others greater weakness was\r\nshown, or the judges were less willing to fulfil the cardinal's bloody\r\ninjunctions.[801] La Porte was reprimanded for finding fault with the\r\nrigorous sentences of the \"grand' chambre,\" and liberated on declaring\r\nthose sentences good and praiseworthy. De Foix was condemned to make a\r\npublic declaration of his belief in the sole validity of the sacrament\r\nas administered in the Romish Church, and to be suspended from his\r\noffice for a year; Du Faur to beg pardon of God, the king, and his\r\nfellow-judges, for having maintained the propriety of holding a holy and\r\nfree universal council before extirpating the heretics, to pay a\r\nconsiderable fine, and to suffer a five years' suspension. Fumée, more\r\nfortunate than his associates, was acquitted in spite of the most\r\nstrenuous exertions of the Cardinal of Lorraine.[802]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public indignation against the Guises.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Must the faithful submit passively to usurpation?]\r\n\r\nThe savage persecution of the Protestants tended powerfully to\r\nstrengthen the current of popular sentiment that was setting in against\r\nthe government of the Guises. The sight of so many cruel executions for\r\nmore than thirty years had not accustomed either the dissidents or the\r\nmore reflecting among those of the opposite creed to the barbarous work.\r\n\"Is it not time,\" they asked, \"to put a stop to the ravages of the\r\nflames and of the sword of the executioner, when such signal failure has\r\nattended their application? Will the terror of the _estrapade_ quench\r\nthe burning courage of a sect which has spread over the whole of France,\r\nif it could not stifle the fire when first kindled at Meaux and at\r\nParis? Has not the policy of extermination thus far persisted in only\r\naccelerating the growth of the new doctrines? Shall the sword rage\r\nforever, and must princes of the blood and the noblest and purest in\r\nlower ranks of society incur a common fate? Must the persecuted submit\r\nwith as good grace to the arbitrary decrees of the usurpers who, through\r\ntheir connection with a minor king, have made themselves supreme, as to\r\nthe legitimate authority of the monarch, advised by his council of\r\nstate? The Gospel, doubtless, enjoins upon all Christians the most\r\npatient submission to legally constituted authority. Its success is to\r\nbe won by the display of faith and obedience. But concession may\r\ndegenerate into cowardice, and submission into craven subserviency.\r\nObedience to a tyrant is rebellion against the king whom he defrauds of\r\nhis authority, his revenues, and his reputation; and treason against\r\nGod, whose name is suffered to be blasphemed, and whose children are\r\nunjustly distressed.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppression becomes intolerable.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The convocation of the States General.]\r\n\r\nThe religious grievances thus ran parallel with the political, and could\r\nscarcely be distinguished in the great aggregate of the intolerable\r\noppression to which France was subjected. The legislation of which such\r\ngrave complaint was made, it must be admitted, was sometimes\r\nsufficiently whimsical. The resources of the royal treasury, for\r\ninstance, being inadequate to meet the demands of creditors, it was\r\nnecessary to silence their importunity. An inhuman decree was\r\naccordingly published, enjoining upon all petitioners who had come to\r\nFontainebleau, where the king was sojourning, to solicit the payment of\r\ndebts or pensions, to leave the court within twenty-four hours, on pain\r\nof the halter! A gallows newly erected in front of the castle was a\r\nsignificant warning as to the serious character of the threat.[803] In\r\norder to provide against uprisings such as the violent course taken was\r\nwell calculated to occasion, the people must be disarmed. Accordingly,\r\nan edict was published, within a fortnight after the accession of\r\nFrancis, strictly forbidding all persons from carrying pistols and other\r\nfirearms, and the prohibition was more than once repeated during this\r\nbrief reign.[804] While thus seeking to repress the display of the\r\npopular displeasure in acts of violence and sedition, the Guises\r\nresolved to prevent the overthrow of their usurped authority by\r\nlegitimate means. The convocation of the States General was the\r\nsafety-valve through which, in accordance with a wise provision, the\r\noverheated passions of the people were wont to find vent. But the\r\nassembling of the representatives of the three orders would be\r\nequivalent to signing the death-warrant of the Guises; while to\r\nCatharine, the queen mother, it would betoken an equally dreaded\r\ntermination of long-cherished hopes. Both Catharine and the Guises,\r\ntherefore, gave out that whoever talked of convening the States was a\r\nmortal enemy of the king, and made himself liable to the pains of\r\ntreason.[805] Every precaution had been taken to make the boiler tight,\r\nand to render impossible the escape of the scalding waters and the\r\nsteam; it only remained to be seen whether the structure was proof\r\nagainst an explosion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin and Beza consulted.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They dissuade armed resistance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin foresees civil war.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More favorable replies.]\r\n\r\nSuch a catastrophe, indeed, seemed now to be imminent.[806] Among the\r\nmore restless, especially, there was a manifest preparation for some new\r\nenterprise. The correspondence of the reformers reveals the fact that,\r\nas early as in the commencement of September, a knotty question had\r\nbeen propounded to the Genevese theologians:[807] \"Is it lawful to make\r\nan insurrection against those enemies not only of religion, but of the\r\nvery state, particularly when, according to law, the king himself\r\npossesses no authority on which they can rest their usurpation?\" This\r\nwas an interrogatory often put by those who would gladly have followed\r\nthe example of a Scævola, and sacrificed their own lives to purchase\r\nfreedom for France. \"Hitherto,\" notes Beza, \"we have answered that the\r\nstorm must be overcome by prayer and by patience, and that He will not\r\ndesert us who lately showed by so wonderful an example (the death of\r\nHenry) not only what He can, but what He will do for His church. Until\r\nnow this advice has been followed.\"[808] As the plan for a forcible\r\noverthrow of the Guises began to develop under the increasing\r\noppression, and as malcontents from France came to the free city on Lake\r\nLeman in greater numbers, Calvin expressed his convictions with more and\r\nmore distinctness, and endeavored to dissuade the refugees from\r\nembarking in so hazardous an undertaking. Its advocates in vain urged\r\nthat they had received from a prince of the blood (entitled, by the\r\nimmemorial custom of the realm, to the first place in the council, in\r\nthe absence of his brother, the King of Navarre) the promise to present\r\ntheir confession of faith to the young monarch of France, and that\r\nthousands would espouse his defence if he were assailed. The reformer\r\nsaw more clearly than they the rising of the clouds of civil war\r\nportending ruin to his native land. \"Let but a single drop of blood be\r\nshed,\" said Calvin, \"and streams will flow that must inundate\r\nFrance.\"[809] But his prudent advice was unheeded. Other theologians\r\nand jurists of France and Germany had been questioned. They replied more\r\nfavorably, \"It is lawful,\" they said, \"to take up arms to repel the\r\nviolence of the Guises, under the authority of a prince of the blood,\r\nand at the solicitation of the estates of France, or the soundest part\r\nof them. Having seized the persons of the obnoxious ministers, it will\r\nnext be proper to assemble the States General, and put them on trial for\r\ntheir flagrant offences.\"[810]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Godefroy de la Renaudie.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His grounds for revenge.]\r\n\r\nAn active and energetic man was needed to organize the movement and\r\ncontrol it until the proper moment should come for Condé--the \"mute\"\r\nhead, whose name was for the time to be kept secret--to declare himself.\r\nSuch a leader was found in Godefroy de Barry, Seigneur de la Renaudie, a\r\ngentleman of ancient family in Périgord. The result justified the wisdom\r\nof the choice. Besides the discontent animating him in common with the\r\nbetter part of the kingdom, La Renaudie had private wrongs of his own to\r\navenge. Less than a year before the accession of Francis, his\r\nbrother-in-law, Gaspard de Heu, had been arrested as a pretended agent\r\nfor bringing about an alliance between the King of Navarre and the\r\nProtestant princes of Germany.[811] In the gloomy castle of the Bois de\r\nVincennes a private trial had been held, in which none of the accustomed\r\nforms of law were observed. De Heu had been barbarously tortured and\r\nsecretly despatched.[812] That it was a judicial murder was proved by\r\nthe extraordinary precautions taken to conceal the procedure from the\r\nknowledge of the public, and by the selection of the most lonely place\r\nabout the castle for the grave into which his official assassins hastily\r\nthrust the body.[813] La Renaudie held the Cardinal of Lorraine to be\r\nthe author of the cowardly deed.[814]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He assembles the malcontents at Nantes, Feb. 1, 1560.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Well-devised plans.]\r\n\r\nLa Renaudie displayed incredible diligence.[815] In a few days he had\r\ntravelled over a great part of France, visiting all the most prominent\r\nopponents of the Guises, urging the reluctant, assuring the timid,\r\ninciting all to a determined effort. On the first of February he\r\nassembled in the city of Nantes a large number of noblemen and of\r\npersons belonging to the \"tiers état,\" who claimed to be as complete a\r\nrepresentation of the estates of France as the circumstances of the\r\ncountry would admit. It was a hazardous undertaking; but so prudently\r\ndid the deputies deport themselves, that, although the Parliament of\r\nBrittany was then sitting at Nantes, they were not detected in the crowd\r\nof pleaders before the court. After solemnly protesting that the\r\nenterprise was directed neither against the majesty of the king and of\r\nthe princes of the blood, nor against the legitimate estate of the\r\nkingdom, the assembly was intrusted with the secret of the name of the\r\nprince by whose authority the arrest of the Guises was to be attempted.\r\nThe tenth of March[816] was fixed upon for the execution of the design.\r\nAt that date, it was supposed, Francis and his court would be sojourning\r\non the banks of the Loire.[817] Five hundred gentlemen were selected,\r\nand placed under the command of ten captains. All were to obey the\r\ndirections of the \"mute\" chief, and his delegate, La Renaudie. Others of\r\nthe confederates were pledged to prevent the provincial towns from\r\nsending assistance to the Guises. The force thus raised was to be\r\ndisbanded only when a legitimate government had been re-established, and\r\nthe usurpers brought to punishment.[818]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confidence of the Guises.]\r\n\r\nThe plan was well devised, and its execution was entrusted to capable\r\nhands. The omens, indeed, were favorable. The Cardinal of Lorraine and\r\nhis brother, intoxicated by the uniform success hitherto attending their\r\nambitious projects, despised such vague rumors of opposition as reached\r\ntheir ears. The party adverse to their tyranny, composed not only of\r\nProtestants and others who sought the best interests of their country,\r\nbut recruited from the ranks of the restless and of those who had\r\nprivate wrongs to redress, was sure, on the first tidings of its\r\nuprising, to secure the active co-operation of many of the most powerful\r\nnobles, and possibly might enlist the majority of the population. Rarely\r\nhas an important secret been so long and so successfully kept. It was\r\ndeemed little short of a miracle that, in a time of peace, and in a\r\ncountry where the regal authority was so implicitly obeyed, a\r\ndeliberative assembly of no mean size had been convened from all the\r\nprovinces of France, and the Guises had obtained intimations of the\r\nconspiracy of their enemies by letters from Germany, Spain, and Italy,\r\nbefore any tidings of it reached the ears of their spies carefully\r\nposted in every part of the kingdom. So close a reticence augured ill\r\nfor the permanence of the present usurpation.[819]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plot betrayed.]\r\n\r\nBut the timidity or treachery of a single person disconcerted all the\r\nsteps so cautiously taken. The curiosity of Des Avenelles, a lawyer at\r\nParis, in whose house La Renaudie lodged, was excited by the number of\r\nthe visitors whom his guest attracted. As his host was a Protestant, La\r\nRenaudie believed that he risked nothing in making of him a confidant.\r\nBut the secret was too valuable, or too dangerous, to be kept, and Des\r\nAvenelles secured his safety, as well as a liberal reward, by disclosing\r\nit to two dependants of the Guises, by whom it was faithfully reported\r\nto their masters.[820] The astounding information was at first received\r\nwith incredulity, but soon a second witness was obtained. It could no\r\nlonger be doubted that the blow of the approach of which letters from\r\nabroad, and especially from Cardinal Granvelle, in Flanders,[821] had\r\nwarned them, was about to descend upon their heads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Tumult of Amboise.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen fuller revelations of the extent of the plot were made, the court\r\nin consternation shut itself up in the defences of Amboise. Catharine\r\nde' Medici, recalling the warning of the Church of Paris, declared that\r\nnow she saw that the Protestants were men of their word.[822]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Châtillons consulted.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coligny gives Catharine good advice.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, not only were vigorous measures adopted to guard against\r\nattack, but the most powerful nobles, who might be suspected of\r\ncomplicity, were sounded respecting their intentions. Coligny and his\r\nbrother, D'Andelot, who, in virtue of their offices as Admiral and\r\nColonel-General of the infantry, stood at the head of the army, received\r\naffectionate invitations from Catharine to visit the court. Upon their\r\narrival they were taken apart, and were earnestly entreated by the queen\r\nmother and Chancellor Olivier to assist them by their counsel, and not\r\nto abandon the young king. To so urgent a request Coligny made a frank\r\nreply. He explained the existing discontent and its causes, both\r\nreligious and political. Persecution, and the usurpation of those who\r\nwere esteemed foreigners by the French, lay at the root of the troubles.\r\nHe advised the relaxation of the rigorous treatment of the adherents of\r\nthe Reformation. _Extermination_ was out of the question. The numbers of\r\nthe Protestants had become too great to permit the entertaining of such\r\na thought. Moreover, the court might be assured that there were\r\nthose--and they were not few--who would no longer consent to endure the\r\ncruelty to which, for forty years, they had been subjected, especially\r\nnow that it was exercised under the authority of a young king governed\r\nby persons \"more hated than the plague,\" and known to be inspired less\r\nby religious zeal than by excessive ambition, and by an avarice that\r\ncould be satisfied only by obtaining the property of the richest houses\r\nin France. An edict of toleration, couched in explicit terms and\r\nhonestly executed, was the only remedy to restore peace and quiet until\r\nthe convocation of a free and holy council.[823]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The edict of amnesty March, 1560.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is promptly registered.]\r\n\r\nThe privy council, if not persuaded of the propriety of initiating a\r\npolicy of toleration, were at least convinced of the necessity of\r\nyielding temporarily to the storm; and even the Guises deemed it\r\nadvisable to make concessions, which could easily be revoked on the\r\nadvent of more peaceful times. Accordingly, an edict of pretended\r\namnesty was hastily drawn up, and as expeditiously published. The king\r\nwas moved to take this step--so the edict made him say--by compassion\r\nfor the number of persons who, from motives of curiosity or simplicity,\r\nhad attended the conventicles of the preachers from Geneva--for the most\r\npart mechanical folk and of no literary attainments--as well as by\r\nreluctance to render the first year of his reign notable in after times\r\nfor the effusion of the blood of his poor subjects. By the provisions of\r\nthis important instrument the royal judges were forbidden to make\r\ninquisition into, or inflict punishment for any _past_ crime concerning\r\nthe faith: and all delinquents were pardoned _on condition that they\r\nshould hereafter live as good Catholics and obedient sons of Mother Holy\r\nChurch_. But from the benefits of the amnesty were expressly excluded\r\nall preachers and those who had conspired against the person of the king\r\nor his ministers.[824] The edict--much to the surprise of those who knew\r\nthe sanguinary disposition of the judges--was promptly registered by\r\nparliament; whether it was that the judges were reconciled to the step\r\nby a secret article with which, it was said, they accompanied it, to\r\nguide in the future interpretation of the law, or that the majority\r\nregarded it as a piece of deceit.[825]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A year's progress.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's comment.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of its insincerity, however, the edict, wrung from the\r\nunwilling hands of the cardinal and the privy council, marks an\r\nimportant epoch in the history of the Reformed Church in France. Barely\r\nnine months had elapsed since five members of the Parisian Parliament\r\nhad been thrown into the Bastile for daring to advocate a mitigation of\r\nthe penalties pronounced against the Protestants, until the assembling\r\nof the long-promised Oecumenical Council. Little more than two months\r\nhad passed since one of their number, and the most virtuous judge on the\r\nbench, had been ignominiously executed. And now the King of France, with\r\nthe approval and almost at the instigation of the chief persecutor,\r\nproclaimed an oblivion of all offences against religion, and the\r\nliberation of all persons imprisoned for heresy. The reformers, who had\r\nrarely succeeded by their most strenuous exertions in obtaining the\r\nrelease of a few of their co-religionists, could scarcely restrain a\r\nsmile when they discovered what a potent auxiliary they had obtained\r\nunawares--in the _fears_ of their antagonists. \"Would that you could\r\nread and understand the number of contradictory edicts they have written\r\nin a single month!\" wrote one who took a deep interest in French\r\naffairs. \"You would assuredly be amazed at their incredible fright, when\r\nno one is pursuing them, except Him whom they least fear! What you could\r\nnot succeed in obtaining by any of your embassies in former years, they\r\nhave given of their own accord to those who sought it not--the\r\nliberation of the entire number of prisoners on all sides. Most have\r\nbeen released in spite of their open profession of their faith. The\r\ninjustice of the judges has, however, led to the retention of a few in\r\nchains up to this moment.\"[826]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A powerful party had arisen.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its incompleteness and insincerity, however, \"the Edict\r\nof Forgiveness,\" as it was termed, is a significant landmark in the\r\nhistory of French Protestantism. It is the point where begins the\r\ntransition from the period of persecution to the period of civil war. By\r\nthis concession, reluctantly granted and faithlessly executed, the first\r\nrecognition was made of the existence of a large and powerful body of\r\ndissidents from the Roman Catholic Church. No longer were there a few\r\nscattered sectaries whose heretical views might be suppressed by their\r\nindividual extermination. But a compact and wide-spread and rapidly\r\ngrowing party had assumed dimensions that defied any such paltry\r\nmeasures. It had outgrown persecution. The time for its eradication by\r\nopen war or by secret massacre might yet come. Meanwhile, it was\r\nimportant to avert present disaster by partial concessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dismay of the court.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New alarms.]\r\n\r\nThe treachery of Des Avenelles had warned the Guises of their danger,\r\nbut had left them in dismay and doubt. They knew not whom to trust, nor\r\nwhence to expect the impending blow. Sir Nicholas Throkmorton's\r\ncorrespondence is full of interesting details throwing light upon the\r\nconfusion and embarrassment of the Guises. \"You shall understand,\" he\r\nwrites on the seventh of March, \"that the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal\r\nof Lorraine have discovered a conspiracy wrought against themselves and\r\ntheir authority, which they have bruited (to make the matter more\r\nodious) to be meant only against the king: whereupon they are in such\r\nfear as themselves do wear privy coats, and are in the night guarded\r\nwith pistoliers and men in arms. They have apprehended eight or nine,\r\nand have put some to the torture.\" \"Being ready to seal up this letter,\"\r\nhe adds in a postscript, \"I do understand that the fear of this\r\ncommotion is so great, as the sixth of this present, the Duke of Guise,\r\nthe Cardinal of Lorraine, the Grand Prior, and all the knights of the\r\nOrder which were here, watched all night long in the court, and the\r\ngates of this town were all shut and kept.\" On the fifteenth of March he\r\nwrites: \"These men here have their hands full, and are so busied to\r\nprovide for surety at home, that they cannot intend to answer\r\nforeigners. This night a new hot alarm is offered, and our town doth\r\nbegin again to be guarded. It is a marvel to see how they be daunted,\r\nthat have not at other times been afraid of great armies of horsemen,\r\nfootmen, and the fury of shot of artillery: I never saw state more\r\namazed than this at some time, and by and by more reckless; they know\r\nnot whom to mistrust, nor to trust.... He hath all the trust this daye,\r\nthat to-morrow is least trusted. You can imagine your advantage.\" A few\r\ndays later he writes again: \"And now it was thought that this was but a\r\npopular commotion, without order, and not to be feared; when, unlooked\r\nfor, the 17th, in the morning, about four of the clock, there arrived a\r\ncompany of 150 horsemen well appointed, who approached the court gates,\r\nand shot off their pistolets at the church of the Bonhommes, whereupon\r\nthere was such an alarm and running up and down in the court, as if the\r\nenemies being encamped about them had sought to make an entry into the\r\ncastle: and there was crying, _To horse, to horse_.... This continued an\r\nhour and a half,\"[827] etc.\r\n\r\nLa Renaudie had actually established himself within six leagues of\r\nAmboise on the second of March, and had made his arrangements for the\r\nvigorous execution of his plans a fortnight later. The Guises were to be\r\nseized by a party that counted upon gaining secret admission to the\r\ncastle, and opening the gates to comrades concealed in the neighborhood.\r\nBut another act of treachery on the part of a confederate enabled the\r\ncardinal and his brother to frustrate a project so sagaciously laid and\r\noffering fair promise of success. The parties of cavaliers, who had\r\nsucceeded, as by a miracle, in eluding the spies and agents of their\r\nenemies, posted in every important city of France, and had reached the\r\nvery vicinity of the court without discovery, were caught in detail at\r\ntheir rendezvous. Companies of fifteen or twenty men thus fell into the\r\nhands of the troops hastily assembled by the urgent commands of the\r\nking's ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treacherous capture of Castelnau.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of La Renaudie.]\r\n\r\nA more powerful detachment of malcontents could not be so easily\r\nstopped, and threw itself into the castle of Noizay. It seemed more\r\nfeasible to overcome them by stratagem than by open assault. The Duke of\r\nNemours, having been sent to reduce the place, allowed Baron de\r\nCastelnau, commander of the insurgents, a personal interview. Here the\r\nHuguenot defended his adherents against the imputation of having\r\nrevolted against their lawful monarch, and maintained that, on the\r\ncontrary, they had come to uphold his honor and free him from the\r\nintrigues of the Guises. Seeing, however, the hopelessness of resisting\r\nthe superior force of his enemy, Castelnau consented to capitulate,\r\nafter exacting from the Duke of Nemours his princely word that he and\r\nhis followers should receive no injury, and be permitted to have free\r\naccess to the king, in order to lay before him their grievances. The\r\npledge thus given was redeemed in no chivalrous manner. No account was\r\nmade of the terms accepted. Castelnau and his companions-in-arms were at\r\nonce thrown into the dungeons of Amboise, and steps were taken for their\r\ntrial on a charge of treason.[828] Much larger numbers, arriving in the\r\nvicinity of Amboise ignorant of what had happened, were surrounded by\r\ncavalry and brought in tied to the horses' tails. Many a knight, better\r\naccoutred than his fellows, was despatched in a more summary manner and\r\nstripped of his armor, after which his body was carelessly thrown into a\r\nditch by the roadside.[829] La Renaudie was so fortunate as to escape\r\nthis fate and the yet more cruel doom that awaited him at Amboise, by\r\nmeeting a soldier's death, while courageously fighting against a party\r\nof Guisards who fell in with him. He had just slain his antagonist--one\r\nPardaillan, his own relative--when (on the nineteenth of March) he was\r\nhimself instantly killed by the ball from an arquebuse fired by his\r\nopponent's servant.[830]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plenary powers given to the Duke of Guise.]\r\n\r\nWhile the alarm arising from the \"tumult\" was yet at its height, the\r\nGuises took advantage of it to obtain yet larger powers, at the same\r\ntime securing their position against future assaults. The king, in his\r\nterror, was readily induced to accept the warlike uncle of his wife as\r\nthe only person on whose military prowess and faithfulness he could\r\nrely. He regarded the interest of the Guises and his own as identical;\r\nfor he had been told, and he firmly believed it, that the enmity of the\r\ninsurgents was directed no less against the crown than against its\r\nunpopular ministers.[831] On the seventeenth of March he therefore gave\r\na commission to \"Francis of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, peer, grand master,\r\nand grand chamberlain,\" to be his lieutenant-general with absolute\r\npowers, promising to approve of all his acts, and authorizing him to\r\nimpose the customary punishment upon the seditious, without form or\r\nfigure of process.[832]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chancellor Olivier opposes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forgiveness to the submissive.]\r\n\r\nThere were those about the monarch who could not but look with concern\r\nupon the unlimited authority thus accorded to an ambitious prince.\r\nChancellor Olivier was of this number. He at first refused to affix the\r\nseal of state to a paper which falsely purported to have been made by\r\nadvice of the council. It was, however, at length decided that another\r\nedict should be published contemporaneously, extending forgiveness to\r\nall that had assembled in arms in the neighborhood of the city of\r\nAmboise, under color of desiring to present to the king a confession of\r\ntheir faith. To avail themselves of the benefits of this pardon, they\r\nmust, within \"twice twenty-four hours,\" return to their homes, in\r\ncompanies of two, or, at the most, three together. The disobedient were\r\nto be hung without process of law, and the tocsin might be rung to\r\ngather a force for the purpose of capturing them. The king, however,\r\ninvited all that desired to present him their requests to depute one of\r\ntheir number to lay them before his council, promising, on the pledge of\r\nhis royal word, redress and security.[833]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Explained away by a new edict.]\r\n\r\nThe acts of the court little agreed with these words of clemency. Many\r\nof those who, in obedience to the edict, turned their steps homeward,\r\nfound that edict to be only a snare for their simplicity. Indeed, five\r\ndays only had elapsed when, on the twenty-second of March, a fresh\r\nedict, explanatory of the former, excluded from the amnesty all that had\r\ntaken part in the conspiracy![834]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carnival of blood.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The young king visibly affected.]\r\n\r\nBut it was at Amboise that the vengeance of the Guises found its widest\r\nscope. Day and night the execution of the prisoners stayed not. Their\r\npunishment was ingeniously diversified. Some were decapitated, others\r\nhung; still others were drowned in the waters of the Loire.[835] The\r\nstreets of Amboise ran with blood, and the stench of the unburied\r\ncorpses threatened a pestilence. Ten or twelve dead bodies, in full\r\nclothing and tied to a single pole, floated down from time to time\r\ntoward the sea, and carried tidings of the wholesale massacre to the\r\ncities on the lower Loire. Neither trial nor publication of the charge\r\npreceded the summary execution. Most frequently the victims were placed\r\nin the hangman's hand immediately after the hour for dinner, that their\r\ndying agonies might furnish an agreeable diversion to the ladies of the\r\ncourt, who watched the gibbet from the royal drawing-rooms. Few, besides\r\nthe Duchess of Guise, daughter of Renée of Ferrara, manifested any\r\ndisgust at the repulsive spectacle. Some of the prisoners who\r\nimportunately insisted on seeing the king, and making before him a\r\nprofession of their faith, were summarily hanged from the castle\r\nwindows. One intrepid reformer had been so fortunate as to be admitted\r\nto the queen mother's presence, and there, by his ready and cogent\r\nreasoning, had well-nigh brought the Cardinal of Lorraine to admit that\r\nhis view of the Lord's Supper was correct. Catharine's attention having\r\nbeen for a moment withdrawn, when she returned to the discussion the man\r\nhad disappeared. Actuated by curiosity or by a desire to spare his life,\r\nshe requested him to be sent for. It was too late; he had already been\r\ndespatched.[836] For the most part, the victims displayed great\r\nconstancy and courage. Many died with the words of the psalms of Marot\r\nand Beza on their lips.[837] Castelnau, after having in his\r\ninterrogatory made patent to all the hypocrisy of the cardinal and the\r\ncowardice of the chancellor, died maintaining that, before he was\r\npronounced guilty of treason, the Guises ought to be declared kings of\r\nFrance. Villemongys, upon the scaffold, dipped his hands in the blood of\r\nhis companions, and, raising them toward heaven, exclaimed in a loud\r\nvoice: \"Lord, this is the blood of Thy children, unjustly shed. Thou\r\nwilt avenge it!\"[838] The body of La Renaudie was first hung upon one of\r\nthe bridges of Amboise, with the superscription: \"_La Renaudie, styling\r\nhimself Laforest, author of the conspiracy, chief and leader of the\r\nrebels_.\" Afterward it was quartered, and his head, in company with the\r\nheads of others, was exposed upon a pole on a public square.[839] The\r\nsight of these continually recurring executions, succeeding a fearful\r\nstruggle in which so many of his subjects had taken part, is said to\r\nhave affected even the young king, who asked, with tears, what he had\r\ndone to his people to animate them thus against him. It is even reported\r\nthat, catching for an instant, through the mist with which his advisers\r\nsought to keep his mind enshrouded, a glimpse of the true cause of the\r\ndiscontent, he made a feeble suggestion, which was easily parried, that\r\nthe Guises should for a time retire from the court, in order that he\r\nmight find out whether the popular enmity was in reality directed\r\nagainst him, or against his uncles.[840] Their fertile invention,\r\nhowever, was not slow in concocting a story that turned his short-lived\r\npity into settled hatred of the \"Huguenot heretics.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The elder D'Aubigné and his son.]\r\n\r\nOn others, and especially upon those whose hearts throbbed with\r\npatriotic devotion, a less transient impression was made. Some months\r\nafter, the young Agrippa d'Aubigné, then a mere child of ten years, was\r\ntraversing the city of Amboise with his father. The impaled heads of\r\nthe victims were still to be recognized. The barbarous sight moved the\r\nelder D'Aubigné's soul to its very depths. \"They have beheaded France,\r\nhangmen that they are!\" he cried out in the hearing of the hundreds that\r\nwere present at the fair. Then, spurring his horse, he scarcely escaped\r\nthe hands of the rabble who had caught his words. Afterward, when his\r\nyoung son had rejoined him, he placed his hand on Agrippa's head, and\r\nexclaimed, full of emotion: \"My child, you must not spare your head\r\nafter mine, to avenge these chieftains full of honor, whose heads you\r\nhave just seen! If you spare yourself in this matter, you will have my\r\ncurse.\"[841]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peril of the Prince of Condé.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is summoned by the king.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condé's defiance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guise's offer.]\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Condé had set out for the court about the time of the\r\ndiscovery of the conspiracy. If the coldness of the courtiers whom he\r\nmet on the way did not convince him that he was suspected, the position\r\nin which he soon found himself at Amboise left him no doubts. Surrounded\r\nby spies, he was viewed more as a prisoner than as a guest. The Guises\r\neven counselled Francis to stab him with his dagger while pretending to\r\nsport with him. The crime was averted both by the caution of the prince\r\nand by a reluctance on the part of the young king to imbrue his hands in\r\nthe blood of his kinsman--a sentiment which the Guises interpreted as\r\ncowardice.[842] But, unable to resist the urgency of those who accused\r\nCondé of being the true head of the conspiracy, and maintained that the\r\ntestimony of many of the prisoners rendered the fact indubitable,\r\nFrancis at length summoned the young Bourbon to his presence. He\r\ninformed him of the accusations, and assured him that, should they prove\r\ntrue, he would make him feel the difficulty and the danger of attacking\r\na king of France. At Condé's request an assembly of all the princes, and\r\nof the members of the Privy Council and of the Order of St. Michael, was\r\nsummoned, that he might return his answer to the charges laid against\r\nhim.[843] In the midst of the august gathering, Louis of Bourbon arose\r\nand recited the conversation which he had had with the king. He knew, he\r\nsaid, that he had enemies about him who sought his entire ruin and that\r\nof his house. He had, therefore, solicited to be heard in this company,\r\nand his answer was: that, excepting the person of the king, his\r\nbrothers, and the queens, his mother and wife--and he said it with all\r\nrespect to their presence--whoever had asserted to the king that Condé\r\nwas the chief of certain seditious individuals who were said to have\r\nconspired against his person and estate, had \"falsely and miserably\r\nlied.\" To prove his innocence he offered to waive for the time the\r\nprivileges of his rank as prince of the blood, and in single combat\r\nforce his accuser at the point of the sword to confess himself a\r\npoltroon and a calumniator. As Condé looked proudly around, no one\r\nventured to accept the gauntlet he had thrown down. On the contrary, the\r\nDuke of Guise, his most bitter enemy, promptly stepped forward to offer\r\nhim his services as second in the single combat proposed! Hereupon Condé\r\nbegged the king to esteem him hereafter a faithful and honorable man,\r\nand entreated his Majesty to lend no ear to the authors of such\r\ncalumnies, but to regard them as common enemies of the crown and of the\r\npublic peace.[844]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: An alleged admission of disloyal intentions by La\r\n     Renaudie.]\r\n\r\n     It is well known that the Huguenots were accused by their enemies\r\n     of intending to remodel the government of France. According to\r\n     some, the king was to be retained, but shorn of his authority;\r\n     according to others, he was to be dispensed with altogether. Under\r\n     any circumstances, the Swiss confederation was to be imitated or\r\n     reproduced in France. That which gave the pretended scheme most of\r\n     its air of probability, in the eyes of the unreflecting, and\r\n     compensated for the entire absence of proof of its substantial\r\n     reality, was the familiarity of many of the Huguenots--both\r\n     religious and political--with Geneva, Basle, Berne, and other small\r\n     republican states. These were fountains of Protestant doctrine;\r\n     these had afforded many a refugee shelter from persecution in\r\n     France. It was notorious that the free institutions of these cities\r\n     were the object of admiration on the part of the Calvinists.[845]\r\n\r\n     I believe that no contemporary writer has brought forward a\r\n     particle of evidence in support of this view, and impartial men\r\n     have rejected it as incredible. But a history of the Parliament of\r\n     Bordeaux, lately published,[846] contains an extract from the\r\n     records of that court, which, if trustworthy, would go far to\r\n     establish the reality of treasonable designs entertained by the\r\n     Huguenots. Under date of Sept. 4, 1561, the following entry\r\n     appears:\r\n\r\n     \"Ledit jour, M. Géraut Faure, official de Périgueux, a dit: qu'il y\r\n     a deux ans que le feu _Sieur de La Renaudie_ fust à la maison dudit\r\n     official, à Nontron, lui dire _que c'estoit grande folie qu'un tel\r\n     royaume fust gouverné par un roi seul_, et que si l'official\r\n     vouloit l'entendre, qu'il lui feroit un grand avantage; car _on\r\n     délibéroit de faire un canton à Périgueux, et un autre a Bordeaux_\r\n     dont il espéroit avoir la superintendance. Et lors luy tenant de\r\n     tels propos, retira à part ledit official sans qu'autre\r\n     l'entendist. Ainsi signé: Faure.\"\r\n\r\n     The late M. Boscheron des Portes, giving full credit to the\r\n     assertion of the \"official\" of Périgueux, believed that the party\r\n     of which La Renaudie was a prominent leader contemplated, in\r\n     1559-1560, the formation of \"a federative republic broken up into\r\n     cantons, the number and situation of which were already, it would\r\n     appear, determined upon by the authors of the project.\" And he\r\n     deplores the blind sectarian spirit which could induce Frenchmen to\r\n     acquiesce in a plan designed to destroy the unity and consequent\r\n     power of a realm whose consolidation every successive king since\r\n     the origin of the monarchy had unceasingly pursued.\r\n\r\n     I imagine that few unbiassed minds will follow this usually\r\n     judicious historian in his singularly precipitate acceptance of the\r\n     \"official's\" statement. It is in patent contradiction with\r\n     well-known facts respecting the constitution of the Huguenot party.\r\n     The noblemen who gave this party their support had everything to\r\n     lose, and nothing to gain, by the change from a monarchical to a\r\n     republican form of government. Condé, the \"chef muet,\" was a prince\r\n     of the blood, not so far removed from the throne as to regard it\r\n     altogether impossible that he or his children might yet succeed to\r\n     the crown. The main body of the party had had no reason to\r\n     entertain hostility to regal authority. The prevailing discontent\r\n     was not directed against the young king, but against the persons\r\n     surrounding him who had illegally usurped his name and the real\r\n     functions of royalty. If persecution for religion's sake had long\r\n     raged, the victims had never uttered a syllable smacking of\r\n     disloyalty, and continued to hope, not without some apparent\r\n     reason, that the truth might yet reach the heart of kings.\r\n\r\n     But, independently of the gross inconsistency between the design\r\n     ascribed to La Renaudie and the known sentiments of the Huguenots\r\n     at this time, there are other marks of improbability connected with\r\n     the statement of Géraut Faure. It was not made at the time of the\r\n     pretended disclosure, or shortly after, when, if genuine, it would\r\n     have insured the informer favor and reward; but, after the lapse of\r\n     \"two years,\" when Francis the Second had been dead nine months, and\r\n     when under a new king fresh political issues had arisen. In fact,\r\n     if the term of two years be construed strictly, it carries us back\r\n     to September, 1559, when Francis the Second had been barely three\r\n     months on the throne, and the plans of the Huguenots had, to all\r\n     appearance, by no means had time to assume the completeness implied\r\n     in Faure's statement. Not to speak of the great vagueness and the\r\n     utter absence of circumstantial details in the announcement of the\r\n     conspiracy and in the promised advantages, it should be remarked\r\n     that the confidant selected by La Renaudie was a very unlikely\r\n     person to be chosen. The \"official,\" an ecclesiastical judge\r\n     deputed by the Bishop of Périgueux to take charge of spiritual\r\n     jurisdiction in his diocese, could scarcely be regarded by La\r\n     Renaudie as the safest depositary of so valuable a trust.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 729: Davila, p. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 730: \"Lancea sanctorum tunc inopina salus.\" Epigram _apud_ Le\r\nLaboureur, Additions aux mém. de Castelnau, i. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 731:\r\n\r\n    Sic cruce detractum fixit tua lancea Christum,\r\n      Per latus illorum quos sua membra vocat.\r\n    At Deus omnipotens, Christi justissimus ultor,\r\n      Sanguine, dixit, erit lancea tincta tuo. _Ib._, _ubi supra_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 732: \"O que si ce bon roy eusse vescu,\" says Montluc, \"ou si\r\nceste paix ne se fust faite, qu'il eust bien rembarré les Luthériens en\r\nAllemagne.\" Mémoires, Petitot ed., ii. 483.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 733: Davila, Civil Wars of France, p. 6.

In fact, the general\r\noutline of the royal progress was indicated by the Spanish ambassador,\r\nPerrenot Chantonnay, to Philip II., so far back as December 2, 1559: \"La\r\ncour, lui avait-il écrit, a le projet _de passer le curéme_ à Amboise,\r\nde se rendre en Guyenne au printemps, en passant par Poitiers, Bordeaux,\r\nBayonne, d'aller ensuite à Toulouse, de demeurer l'hiver suivant en\r\nProvence et en Languedoc, et _d'agir vigoureusement contre les\r\nhérétiques_.\" Mignet, Journal des Savants, 1857, 419, from Simancas MSS.\r\nThe Spanish ambassador saw so much that appalled him in the rapid\r\nprogress of the Reformation in every part of France, that he feared\r\nalike for the North and the South, when the king was not present to\r\ncheck its growth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 818: La Planche, 238, 239; Hist. ecclés., i. 158, 159; De\r\nThou, ii. 754-762 (where La Renaudie's harangue is given at length);\r\nCastelnau, liv. i., c. 8; Davila, 22; La Place, 33.

The king,\r\nwho had started on his hunting tour from Blois on the 5th of February,\r\nwas, when the news came, between Marchenoir and Montoire (places north\r\nand northwest of Blois). The first intimations must, however, have been\r\nvery vague and general, since, on the 19th of February, the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine wrote to Coignet, French ambassador in Switzerland, directing\r\nhim to set one or two persons to watch La Renaudie (\"à la queue de la\r\nRegnaudie pour l'observer de loin, n'en perdre connaissance ni jour, ni\r\nnuit\"), and seize him the moment he entered the French\r\nterritories--evidently supposing him to be still in Switzerland and far\r\nfrom Amboise.

The air was still thick with\r\nnoxious vapors, and none could tell how soon or in what quarter the\r\nelements of a new and more terrible convulsion would gather.[847] The\r\nrecent commotion had disclosed the existence of a body of malcontents,\r\nin part religious, in part also political, scattered over the whole\r\nkingdom and of unascertained numbers. To its adherents the name of\r\n_Huguenots_ was now for the first time given.[848] What the origin of\r\nthis celebrated appellation was, it is now perhaps impossible to\r\ndiscover. Although a number of plausible derivations have been given, it\r\nis not unlikely that all are equally far removed from the truth, and\r\nthat the word arose from some trivial circumstance that has completely\r\npassed into oblivion. It has been traced back to the name of the\r\n_Eidgenossen_ or _confederates_, under which the party of freedom\r\nfigured in Geneva when the authority of the bishop and duke was\r\noverthrown;[849] or to the _Roy Huguet_, or _Huguon_, a hobgoblin\r\nsupposed to haunt the vicinity of Tours, to whom the superstitious\r\nattributed the nocturnal assemblies of the Protestants;[850] or to the\r\ngate _du roy Huguon_ of the same city, near which those gatherings were\r\nwont to be made.[851] Some of their enemies maintained the former\r\nexistence of a diminutive coin known as a _huguenot_, and asserted that\r\nthe appellation, as applied to the reformed, arose from their \"not being\r\nworth a _huguenot_\" or farthing.[852] And some of their friends, with\r\nequal confidence and no less improbability, declared that it was\r\ninvented because the adherents of the house of Guise secretly put\r\nforward claims upon the crown of France in behalf of that house as\r\ndescended from _Charlemagne_, whereas the Protestants loyally upheld the\r\nrights of the Valois sprung from _Hugh_ Capet.[853] In the diversity of\r\ncontradictory statements, we may perhaps be excused if we suspend our\r\njudgment of their respective merits, and prefer to look upon this\r\npartisan name as one with whose original import not a score of persons\r\nin France besides its fortuitous inventor may have been acquainted, and\r\nwhich may have had nothing to recommend it to those who so readily\r\nadopted it, save novelty and the recognized need of some more convenient\r\nname than \"Lutherans,\" \"Christaudins,\" or the awkward circumlocution,\r\n\"those of the religion.\" Be this as it may, not a week had passed after\r\nthe conspiracy of Amboise before the word was in everybody's mouth. Few\r\nknew or cared whence it arose.[854]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its sudden rise.]\r\n\r\nA powerful party, whatever name it might bear, had sprung up, as it\r\nwere, in a night. There was sober truth conveyed in the jesting letter\r\nof some fugitives to the Cardinal of Lorraine. Twenty or thirty\r\nHuguenots succeeded in breaking the bars of their prison at Blois, and,\r\nletting themselves down by cords, escaped. Some others at Tours, a few\r\ndays later, were equally fortunate. Scarcely had the latter regained\r\ntheir liberty when they wrote a letter to the prelate who was supposed\r\nto take so deep an interest in their concerns, informing him that,\r\nhaving heard of the escape of his prisoners at Blois, they had been so\r\ngrieved, that, for the love they bore him, they had immediately started\r\nout in search. And they begged him not to distress himself on account of\r\ntheir absence; for they assured him that _they would all soon return to\r\nsee him, and would bring with them not only these, but all the rest of\r\nthose that had conspired to take his life_.[855]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to be accounted for.]\r\n\r\nNo feature of the rise of the Reformation in France is more remarkable\r\nthan the sudden impulse which it received during the last year or two of\r\nHenry the Second's life, and especially within the brief limits of the\r\nreign of his eldest son. The seed had been sown assiduously for nearly\r\nforty years; but the fruit of so much labor had been comparatively\r\nslight and unsatisfactory. Much of the return proved to be of a literary\r\nand philosophical, rather than of a religious character, and tended to\r\nintellectual development instead of the purification of religions belief\r\nand practice. Much of the seed was choked by relentless persecution.\r\nBishops and preachers, the gay poet, and the time-serving courtier, fell\r\naway with alarming facility, when the blight of the royal displeasure\r\nfell upon those who professed a desire to abolish the superstitious\r\nobservances of the established church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A sudden harvest.]\r\n\r\nBut now, within a few brief months, the harvest seemed, as by a miracle,\r\nto be approaching simultaneously over the whole surface of the extended\r\nfield. The grains of truth long since lodged in an arid soil, and\r\napparently destitute of all vitality, had suddenly developed all the\r\nenergy of life. France to the reformers, whose longing eyes were at\r\nlength permitted to see this day, was \"white unto the harvest,\" and only\r\nthe reapers were needed to put forth the sickle and gather the wheat\r\ninto the garner. There was not a corner of the kingdom where the number\r\nof incipient Protestant churches was not considerable. Provence alone\r\ncontained sixty, whose delegates this year met in a synod at the\r\nblood-stained village of Mérindol. In large tracts of country the\r\nHuguenots had become so numerous that they were no longer able or\r\ndisposed to conceal their religious sentiments, nor content to celebrate\r\ntheir rites in private or nocturnal assemblies. This was particularly\r\nthe case in Normandy, in Languedoc, and on the banks of the Rhône.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The progress of letters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and of intelligence.]\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to pause here, and inquire into some of the causes\r\nof this rapid spread of the doctrines of the Reformation after the long\r\nperiod of comparative stagnation preceding. One of these was undoubtedly\r\nthe astonishing progress of letters in France during the last forty\r\nyears. From being neglected and rough, the French language, during the\r\nfirst half of the sixteenth century, became the most polite of the\r\ntongues spoken in Western Europe--thanks to a series of eminent prose\r\nwriters and poets who graced the royal court. The generation reaching\r\nmanhood in the latter years of the reign of Henry the Second were far\r\nbetter educated than the contemporaries of Francis the First. The public\r\nmind, through the elevating tendencies of schools fostered by royal\r\nbounty, was to a considerable degree emancipated from the thraldom of\r\nsuperstition. It repudiated the silly romanese, passing for the lives of\r\nthe saints, with which the public had formerly been satisfied. It\r\nscrutinized minutely every pretended miracle of the papal churches and\r\nconvents, and exposed the trickery by which a corrupt clergy sought to\r\nmaintain itself in popular esteem. Thus the growing intelligence and\r\nwidening information of the people prepared them to appreciate the\r\nmerits of the great doctrinal controversy now occupying the attention of\r\nenlightened minds. Interest in the discussion of the most important\r\nthemes that can occupy the human contemplation was both stimulated and\r\ngratified by a constant influx of religious works from the teeming\r\npresses of Strasbourg, Basle, Lausanne, Neufchâtel, and especially\r\nGeneva. And the verdict of the great majority of readers and thinkers\r\nwas favorable to the Swiss and German controversialists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin's Institutes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marot and Beza's Psalms.]\r\n\r\nNext to the Bible, translated originally by Olivetanus, and in its\r\nsuccessive editions rendered more conformable to the Hebrew and Greek\r\ntexts, the \"Christian Institutes\" exerted the most powerful influence.\r\nThe close logic of Calvin's treatises, speaking in a style clear,\r\nconcise and nervous, and touching a chord of sympathy in each French\r\nreader, made its deep impress upon the intellect and heart, while\r\ncaptivating the ear. Calvin's commentaries on the sacred volume rendered\r\nits pages luminous and familiar. Other works exerted an influence\r\nscarcely inferior. The \"Actions and Monuments\" of the martyrs, by Jean\r\nCrespin, printer and scholar, not only perpetuated the memory of the\r\nwitnesses for the truth, but stimulated others to copy their fidelity.\r\nMarot and Beza's metrical versions of the Psalms, wafted into\r\npopularity, even among those who at first little sympathized with the\r\npiety of the words, by the novelty and beauty of the music to which they\r\nwere sung, were powerful auxiliaries to the arguments of the theologian.\r\nThey entered the house of the peasant and invested its homely scenes\r\nwith a calm derived from the contemplation of the bliss of a heaven\r\nwhere the fleeting distinctions of the present shall melt away. They\r\nnerved the humble artisan to patience and to the cheerful endurance of\r\nobloquy and reproach. They attracted to the gathering of persecuted\r\nreformers in the by-street, in the retired barn, or on the open heath or\r\nmountain side, the youth who preferred their melody and intelligible\r\nwords to the jargon of a service conducted in a tongue understood only\r\nby the learned. In the royal court, or rising in loud chorus from a\r\nthousand voices on the crowded _Pré-aux-Clercs_, they were winged\r\nmessengers of the truth, where no other messengers could have found\r\nutterance with impunity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morals and martyrdom.]\r\n\r\nThe blameless purity of life of the men and women whom, for religion's\r\nsake, the officers of the law put to death with every species of\r\nindignity and with inhuman cruelty, when contrasted with the flagrant\r\ncorruption of the clergy and the shameless dissoluteness of the court,\r\nopenly fostered for their own base ends by cardinals themselves accused\r\nof every species of immorality and suspected of atheism, deeply affected\r\nthe minds of the reflecting. One Anne Du Bourg put to death by a Charles\r\nof Lorraine made more converts in a day than all the executioners could\r\nburn in a year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the ministers from Geneva.]\r\n\r\nBut, if the rapid spread of Protestant doctrines at this precise date is\r\ndue to any one cause more than to another, that cause may probably be\r\nfound in the character and numbers of the religious teachers. Converts\r\nfrom the Papal Church, principally priests and monks, were the first\r\napostles of the Reformation. Few of them had received systematic\r\ntraining of any kind, none had a thorough acquaintance with biblical\r\nlearning. Many embraced the truth only in part; some professed it from\r\nimproper motives. The Lenten preachers whose leaning towards\r\n\"Lutheranism\" was sufficiently marked to attract the hatred of the\r\nSorbonne, were generally orators, more solicitous of popularity than\r\njealous for the truth--fickle and inconstant men whose apostasy\r\ninflicted deep wounds upon the cause with which they had been\r\nidentified, and more than neutralized all the good done by their\r\nprevious exertions. But now a brotherhood of theologians took their\r\nplace, not less zealous for the faith than disciplined in intellect.\r\nGeneva[856] was the nursery from which a vigorous stock was transplanted\r\nto French soil. The theological school in which Calvin and Beza taught,\r\nmoulded the destinies of France. The youths who came from the shores of\r\nLake Leman were no neophytes, nor had they to unlearn the casuistry of\r\nthe schools or to throw off a monastic indolence which habit had made a\r\nsecond nature. They embraced a vocation to which nothing but a stern\r\nsense of duty, or the more powerful attraction of Divine love, could\r\nprompt. They entered an arena where poverty, fatigue, and almost\r\ninevitable death stared them in the face. But they entered it\r\nintelligently and resolutely, with the training of mind and of soul\r\nwhich an athlete might receive from such instructors, and their\r\nprayerful, trustful and unselfish endeavor met an ample\r\nrecompense.[857]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenots of Valence]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: seize the church of the Franciscans.]\r\n\r\nThe course of events in many cities of Southern France is illustrated by\r\nthe occurrences at Valence, which the most authentic and trustworthy\r\nhistorian of this reign has described at length. This episcopal city,\r\nsituated on the Rhône, about midway between Lyons and Avignon, had for\r\nsome time contained a small community of Huguenots. When, in order to\r\navoid persecution, their minister, who had become known to their\r\nenemies, was replaced by another, a period of unexampled growth began.\r\nThe private houses in which the Protestants met were too small to\r\ncontain the worshippers. They now adjourned to the large schools, but at\r\nfirst held their services by night. Soon their courage grew with the\r\nadvent of a second minister and with large accessions to their ranks.\r\nThe younger and more impetuous part of the Protestants, disregarding the\r\nprudent counsels of their pastors and elders, ventured upon the bold\r\nstep of seizing upon the Church of the Franciscans, and caused the\r\nGospel to be openly preached from its pulpit. The people assembled,\r\nsummoned by the ringing of the bell; and it was not long before the\r\nreformed doctrines were relished and embraced by great crowds. A goodly\r\nnumber of armed gentlemen simultaneously took possession of the\r\nadjoining cloisters, and protected the Protestant rites. The\r\nco-religionists of Montélimart and Romans, considerable towns not far\r\ndistant, emboldened by the example of Valence, resorted to public\r\npreaching in the churches or within their precincts.[858]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A public assembly of citizens.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An impressive scene.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The public morals.]\r\n\r\nOn receiving the intelligence of the sudden outbreak of Protestant zeal\r\nin his diocese, the Bishop of Valence--himself at one time possibly\r\nhalf-inclined to become a convert--despatched thither the Seneschal of\r\nValentinois with the royal Edict of Forgiveness published at Amboise for\r\nall who had taken arms and conspired against the king. The citizens were\r\nsummoned to a public assembly, in which the magistrates, the consuls,\r\nthe clergy, and the chief Huguenots were conspicuous. After reading and\r\nexplaining the terms of the royal clemency, the seneschal turned to the\r\nProtestants, who stood by themselves, and demanded whether they intended\r\nto avail themselves of its protection. Mirabel, their chief spokesman,\r\nreplied that it was the custom of the reformed churches to offer prayer\r\nto God before treating of so important affairs as this, and proffered a\r\nrequest that they be allowed to invoke His presence and blessing.\r\nPermission was granted. A citizen of Valence, who was also a deacon of\r\nthe Reformed Church, thereupon came forward, and uttered a fervent\r\nprayer for the prosperity of the king and his realm, and for the\r\nprogress of the Gospel. The Protestant gentlemen reverently uncovered\r\ntheir heads and knelt upon the ground, and their Roman Catholic\r\nneighbors imitated their example. But it was noticed that the clergy\r\nstood unmoved and refused to join in the act of worship. The prayer\r\nbeing ended, a Huguenot orator delivered the answer of his brethren. It\r\nwas, that they rejoiced and rendered thanks for the benignity of their\r\nyoung prince; but that they could not avail themselves of the pardon\r\noffered. They had never conspired against their king. On the contrary,\r\nthey professed a religion that enjoined the most dutiful obedience. As\r\nfor bearing arms, it had only been resorted to by the Huguenots in order\r\nthat they might protect themselves against the unauthorized insults and\r\nviolence of private persons. The citizen was followed by a _procureur_,\r\nwho, for eight years, had kept the criminal records of Valence. He bore\r\npublic testimony to a wonderful change that had come over the city\r\nsince the introduction of the preaching of the Gospel. The acts of\r\nviolence which formerly rendered the streets so dangerous by night that\r\nfew dared to venture out of their houses, even to visit their neighbors,\r\nhad almost disappeared. The fearful story of crime which used to\r\nconfront him every morning had been succeeded by a chronicle of quiet\r\nand peace. It would seem that with a change of doctrine had also come a\r\ntransformation of life. The speaker challenged the other side to gainsay\r\nhis statements; and when not a voice was heard in contradiction, he\r\nadministered to the Papists a scathing rebuke for the calumnies which\r\nsome of them had forged against the Protestants behind their backs. With\r\nthis triumphant refutation of the charges of disorder, the assembly\r\nbroke up.[859]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenots of Dauphiny to be exterminated.]\r\n\r\nThe province of Dauphiny, within whose limits Valence, Romans and\r\nMontélimart were comprehended, was a government entrusted to the Duke of\r\nGuise. Moved with indignation at finding it become the hotbed of\r\nProtestantism, he determined to crush the Huguenots before impunity had\r\ngiven them still greater boldness. The governors of adjacent provinces\r\nwere ordered to assist in the pious undertaking. King Francis, in a\r\nparoxysm of rage, wrote to Tavannes, acting governor of Burgundy, to\r\ntake all the men-at-arms under his command and march to the assistance\r\nof Clermart, Lieutenant-Governor of Dauphiny, in cutting to pieces those\r\nwho had taken up arms under color of religion. They were, he heard,\r\nthree or four thousand men, and had instituted public preaching \"after\r\nthe Geneva fashion,\" with all other insolent acts conceivable. He begged\r\nhim to punish them as they deserved, showing no pity or compassion,\r\nsince they had refused to take advantage of the forgiveness of past\r\noffences which had been sent them. He was to _extirpate_ the evil.[860]\r\n\r\nThese and other equally brutal instructions were obeyed with alacrity;\r\nbut their execution was effected rather by treachery than by open\r\nforce. The Huguenots of Valence were first induced by promises of\r\nsecurity to lay aside their arms, then imprisoned and despoiled by a\r\nparty consisting of the very dregs of the population of Lyons and\r\nVienne. Two of the ministers were put to death[861] in company with\r\nthree of the principal men, one being the _procureur_ who had given such\r\nnoble testimony to the morals of the Protestants. More would have been\r\nexecuted had not the Bishop of Valence been induced to intercede for his\r\nepiscopal city, and obtain amnesty for its citizens. Romans and\r\nMontélimart fared little better than Valence.[862]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concourse at Nismes.]\r\n\r\nAt Nismes, in Languedoc--destined periodically, for the next three\r\ncenturies, to be the scene of civil dissension arising from religious\r\nintolerance--as early as in Holy Week, three Protestant ministers had\r\nbeen preaching in private houses and administering baptism. On Easter\r\nMonday a large concourse from the city and the surrounding villages\r\npublicly passed out into the suburbs--armed, if we may believe the\r\ncowardly Vicomte de Joyeuse, with corselets, arquebuses, and pikes--and\r\ncelebrated the Lord's Supper \"after the manner of Geneva.\" Neither the\r\npresidial judges nor the consuls exhibited much disposition to second\r\nthe efforts of the provincial government in suppressing these\r\nmanifestations.[863]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mouvans in arms in Provence.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His message to Guise.]\r\n\r\nIn Provence the commotion assumed a more military aspect, in immediate\r\nconnection with the conspiracy of Amboise. Mouvans, an able leader,\r\nafter failing in an attempt to gain admission to Aix, long maintained\r\nhimself in the open country. Keeping up a wonderful degree of discipline\r\nin his army, he allowed his soldiers, indeed, to destroy the images in\r\nthe churches and to melt down the rich reliquaries of gold and silver,\r\nbut scrupulously required them to place the precious metal in the hands\r\nof the local authorities. At length, forced to capitulate to the Comte\r\nde Tende, the royal governor, he obtained the promise of security of\r\nperson and liberty of worship. New acts of treachery rendered his\r\nposition unsafe, and he retired to Geneva. It was thence that he\r\nreturned to the Duke of Guise, who professed to be eager to secure for\r\nhimself the services of so able a commander, a noble answer: \"So long as\r\nI know you to be an enemy of my religion and of the public peace, and to\r\nbe occupying the place of right belonging to the princes of the blood,\r\nyou may be assured you have an enemy in Mouvans, a poor gentleman, but\r\nable to bring against you fifty thousand good servants of the King of\r\nFrance, who are ready to endanger life and property in redressing the\r\nwrongs you have inflicted on the faithful subjects of his Majesty.\"[864]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A popular awakening.]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to ignore the fact: France had awakened from the sleep\r\nof ages. The doctrines of the Reformation were being embraced by the\r\nmasses. It was impossible to repress the impulse to confess with the\r\nmouth[865] what was believed in the heart. At Rouen, the earnest request\r\nof the authorities, seconded by the prudent advice of the ministers,\r\nmight prevail upon the Protestant community still to be content with an\r\nunostentatious and almost private worship, upon promise of connivance on\r\nthe part of the Parliament of Normandy. But Caen, St. Lô, and Dieppe\r\nwitnessed great public assemblies,[866] and Central and Southern France\r\ncopied the example of Normandy. The time for secret gatherings and a\r\ntimid worship had gone by. They were no longer in question. \"When cities\r\nand almost entire provinces had embraced the faith of the reformers,\" a\r\nrecent historian has well remarked,[867] \"secret assemblies became an\r\nimpossibility. A whole people cannot shut themselves up in forests and\r\nin caverns to invoke their God. From whom would they hide? From\r\nthemselves? The very idea is absurd.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pamphlets against the usurpers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The queen mother consults La Planche.]\r\n\r\nThe political ferment was not less active than the religious. The\r\npamphlets and the representations made by the emissaries of the Guises\r\nto foreign powers, in which the movement at Amboise was branded as a\r\nconspiracy directed against the king and the royal authority, called\r\nforth a host of replies vindicating the _political_ Huguenots, and\r\nsetting their project in its true light, as an effort to overthrow the\r\nintolerable usurpation of the Guises. The tyrants were no match for the\r\npatriots in the use of the pen; but it fared ill with the author or\r\nprinter of these libels, when the strenuous efforts made to discover\r\nthem proved successful.[868] The politic Catharine de' Medici, fearing a\r\nnew and more dreadful outburst of the popular discontent, renewed her\r\nhollow advances to the Protestant churches,[869] held a long\r\nconsultation with Louis Regnier de la Planche (the eminent historian,\r\nwhose profoundly philosophical and exact chronicle of this short reign\r\nleaves us only disappointed that he confined his masterly investigations\r\nto so limited a field) respecting the grounds of the existing\r\ndissatisfaction,[870] and despatched Coligny to Normandy for the purpose\r\nof finding a cure for the evil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Romorantin, May, 1560.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No abatement of rigor.]\r\n\r\nThe Guises, on the other hand, resolved to meet the difficulties of\r\ntheir situation with boldness. The opposition, so far as it was\r\nreligious, must be repressed by legislation strictly enforced.\r\nAccordingly, in the month of May, 1560, an edict was published known as\r\nthe _Edict of Romorantin_, from the place where the court was\r\nsojourning, but remarkable for nothing save the misapprehensions that\r\nhave been entertained respecting its origin and object.[871] It\r\nrestored exclusive jurisdiction in matters of simple heresy to the\r\nclergy, excluding the civil courts from all participation, save to\r\nexecute the sentence of the ecclesiastical judge. But it neither\r\nlightened nor aggravated the penalties affixed by previous laws. _Death_\r\nwas still to be the fate of the convicted heretic, to whom it mattered\r\nlittle whether he were tried by a secular or by a spiritual tribunal,\r\nexcept that the forms of law were more likely to be observed by the\r\nformer than by the latter. A section directed against the \"assemblies\"\r\nin which, under color of religion, arms were carried and the public\r\npeace threatened, declared those who took part in them to be rebels\r\nliable to the penalties of treason.[872]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Chancellor Olivier.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable figure now comes upon the stage of French affairs in the\r\nperson of Chancellor Michel de l'Hospital. Chancellor Olivier, who had\r\nmerited universal respect while losing office in consequence of his\r\nsteadfast resistance to injustice under the previous reign, had\r\nforfeited the esteem of the good by his complaisance when restored to\r\noffice by the Guises at the beginning of the present reign. Overcome\r\nwith remorse for the cruelties in which he had acquiesced since his\r\nreinstatement, he fell sick shortly after the tumult of Amboise. When\r\nvisited during his last illness by the Cardinal of Lorraine, he coldly\r\nturned his back upon him and muttered, \"Ah! Cardinal, you have caused us\r\nall to be damned.\"[873] He died not long afterward, and was buried\r\nwithout regret, despised by the patriotic party on account of his\r\nunfaithfulness to early convictions, and hated by the Guises for his\r\ntardy condemnation of their measures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chancellor Michel de l'Hospital.]\r\n\r\nOf L'Hospital, because raised to the vacant charge by the Lorraine\r\ninfluence, little good was originally expected.[874] But the lapse of a\r\nfew years revealed the incorruptible integrity of his character and the\r\nsagacity of his plans.[875] Elevated to the highest judicial post at a\r\ncritical juncture, he accepted a dignity for which he had little\r\nambition, only that he might the better serve his country. What he could\r\nnot remedy he resolved to make as endurable as possible. It was not\r\nwithin the power of a single virtuous statesman to allay the storm and\r\nquiet the surging waters; but by good-will, perseverance, and nerve, he\r\nmight steer the ship of state through many a narrow channel and by many\r\na hidden rock. An ardent lover and earnest advocate of toleration, he\r\nyet considered it politic to consent to urge the Parliament of Paris, in\r\nthe king's name, to register the Edict of Romorantin, in accordance with\r\nwhich the system of persecution was for a while to be continued. One of\r\nthe original conspirators of Amboise, according to the explicit\r\nstatement of a writer who saw his signature affixed to the secret papers\r\nof the confederates,[876] he made no opposition to the article that\r\npronounced the penalties of treason upon those who assembled in arms to\r\ncelebrate the rites of religious worship. Yet he dissembled not from\r\ntimidity, treachery, or ambition, but solely that by unremitting labor\r\nhe might heal the unhappy dissensions of his country. \"_Patience,\r\npatience, tout ira bien_,\" were the words he always had in his mouth for\r\nencouragement and consolation.[877]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perplexity of the ruling family.]\r\n\r\nAs the summer advanced the perplexities of the Guises increased. Every\r\nday there were new alarms. The English ambassador, not able to conceal\r\nhis satisfaction at the perplexity of his queen's covert enemies, wrote\r\nto Cecil: \"If I should discourse particularly unto you what these men\r\nhave done since my last letters ... you would think me as fond in\r\nobserving their doings as they mad in variable executing. But you may\r\nsee what force _fear_ hath that occasioned such variety.... They be in\r\nsuch security, as no man knoweth overnight where the king will lodge.\r\nTomorrow from all parts they have such news as doth greatly perplex\r\nthem. Every day new advertisements of new stirs, as of late again in\r\nDauphiny, in Anjou, in Provence; and to make up their mouths, the king\r\nbeing in the skirts of Normandy, at Rouen, upon Corpus Christi Day,\r\nthere was somewhat to do about the solemn procession, so as there was\r\nmany slain in both parts. But at length the churchmen had the worse, and\r\nfor an advantage, the order is by the king commanded, that the priests\r\nfor their outrage shall be grievously punished. What judge you when the\r\nCardinal of Lorraine is constrained to command to punish the clergy, and\r\nsuch as do find fault with others' insolence, contemning the reverent\r\nusage to the holy procession!\"[878]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montbrun in the Comtât Venaissin.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Universal commotion.]\r\n\r\nNew commotions had indeed arisen in the south-east, where Montbrun, a\r\nnephew of Cardinal Tournon, the inquisitor-general, had entered the\r\nsmall domain of the Pope, the Comtât Venaissin, as a Huguenot\r\nleader.[879] Condé had dexterously escaped the snares laid for him, and\r\nhad taken refuge with his brother, Navarre.[880] Their spies reported to\r\nthe Guises a state of universal commotion; and deputies from all parts\r\nof France rehearsed in the ears of the Bourbon princes the story of the\r\nusurpations of the Guises and the Protestant grievances, and urged them,\r\nby every consideration of honor and safety, to undertake to redress\r\nthem.[881] The Guises had for some time been pressing the King of Spain\r\nand the Pope to forward the convening of a universal council, without\r\nwhich all would go to ruin.[882] In view of the great apathy displayed\r\nboth by Philip and by Pius--perhaps, also, with the secret hope of\r\nenticing Navarre and Condé to come within their reach[883]--they\r\nconsented to the plan which Catharine de' Medici, at the suggestion of\r\nL'Hospital and Coligny, now advocated, of summoning a council of\r\nnotables to devise measures for allaying the existing excitement.[884]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assembly of notables at Fontainebleau, August 21, 1560.]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of August this celebrated assembly was convened by\r\nroyal letters in the stately palace at Fontainebleau.[885] Antoine of\r\nNavarre and the Prince of Condé declined, on specious pretexts, the\r\nking's invitation. Constable Montmorency accepted it, but came with a\r\nformidable escort of eight hundred attendants. His three nephews, the\r\nChâtillons, followed his example, and shared his protection. At the\r\nappointed hour a brilliant company was gathered in the spacious\r\napartments of the queen mother. On either side of the king's throne sat\r\nMary of Scots, and Catharine de' Medici, and the young princes--Charles\r\nMaximilian, Duke of Orleans, Edward Alexander, and Hercules.[886] Four\r\ncardinals, in their purple--Bourbon, Lorraine, Guise, and Châtillon--sat\r\nbelow. Next to these were placed the Duke of Guise, as\r\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom; the Duke of Montmorency, as\r\nconstable; L'Hospital, as chancellor; Marshals St. André and Brissac;\r\nAdmiral Coligny; Marillac, Archbishop of Vienne; Morvilliers, Bishop of\r\nOrleans; Montluc, Bishop of Valence; and the other members of the privy\r\ncouncil. In front of these, the members of the Order of St. Michael, and\r\nthe rest of the notables, occupied lower benches.[887]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chancellor L'Hospital's speech.]\r\n\r\nThe session opened with brief speeches delivered by Francis and his\r\nmother, setting forth the object of this extraordinary convocation, but\r\nreferring their auditors to the chancellor and to the king's uncles for\r\nfurther explanations. Chancellor L'Hospital was less concise. He\r\nentertained the assembly with a lengthy comparison of the political\r\nmalady to a bodily disease,[888] pronouncing the cure to be easy, if\r\nonly the cause could be detected. He closed by assigning a somewhat\r\nsingular reason for summoning but two of the three orders of the state.\r\nThe presence of the _people_, he said, was in no wise necessary,\r\n_inasmuch as the king's sole object was to relieve the third estate_.\r\nBecause, forsooth, the poor people--bowed down to the earth with taxes\r\nand burdens, which the _noblesse_ would not touch with one of their\r\nfingers--was the party chiefly interested in the results of the present\r\ndeliberations, it was quite unessential that its complaints or requests\r\nshould be heard! The Duke of Guise and his brother, the cardinal, next\r\nlaid before the assembly an account of their administration of the army\r\nand finances; and the first day's session ended with the pleasant\r\nannouncement that the royal revenues annually fell short of the regular\r\nexpenses by the sum--very considerable for those days--of two and\r\none-half millions of livres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coligny speaks and presents two petitions.]\r\n\r\nWhen next the notables met, two days later, the king formally proposed a\r\nfree discussion of the subject in hand. The youngest member of the privy\r\ncouncil was about to speak, when Gaspard de Coligny arose, and,\r\nadvancing to the throne, twice bowed humbly to the king. By the royal\r\norders, he said, he had lately visited Normandy and investigated the\r\norigin of the recent commotions. He had satisfied himself that they were\r\nowing to no ill-will felt toward the crown; but only to the extreme and\r\nillegal violence with which the inhabitants had been treated for\r\nreligion's sake. He had, therefore, believed it to be his duty to listen\r\nto the requests of the persecuted, who offered to prove that their\r\ndoctrines were conformable to the Holy Scriptures and to the traditions\r\nof the primitive church, and to take charge of the two petitions which\r\nthey had drawn up and addressed to his Majesty and the queen mother.\r\nThey were without signatures; for these could not be affixed without the\r\nroyal permission previously granted the reformed to assemble together.\r\nBut, with that permission, he could obtain the names of fifty thousand\r\npersons in Normandy alone. In answer to Coligny's prayer that the king\r\nwould take his action in good part, Francis assured him that his past\r\nfidelity was a sufficient pledge of his present zeal; and commanded\r\nL'Aubespine, secretary of state, to read the papers which the admiral\r\nhad just placed in his hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The petitions are read.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They ask for liberty of worship.]\r\n\r\nThe petitions,[889] addressed, one to the king, the other to the queen\r\nmother, purported to come from \"the faithful Christians scattered in\r\nvarious parts of the kingdom.\" They set forth the severity of the\r\npersecutions the Huguenots had undergone, and were yet undergoing, for\r\nattempting to live according to the purity of God's word, and their\r\nsupreme desire to have their doctrine subjected to examination, that it\r\nmight be seen to be neither seditious nor heretical. The suppliants\r\nbegged for an intermission of the cruel measures which had stained all\r\nFrance with blood. They professed an unswerving allegiance, as in duty\r\nbound, to the king whom God had called to the throne. And of that king\r\nthey prayed that the occasion of so many calumnies, invented against\r\nthem by reason of the secret and nocturnal meetings to which they had\r\nbeen driven by the prohibition of open assemblies, might be removed; and\r\nthat, with the permission to meet publicly for the celebration of divine\r\nrites, houses for worship might also be granted to them.[890]\r\n\r\nIt was a perilous step for the admiral to take. By his advocacy of\r\ntoleration he incurred liability to the extreme penalties that had been\r\ninflicted upon others for utterances much less courageous. But the very\r\nboldness of the movement secured his safety where more timid counsels\r\nmight have brought him ruin. Besides, it was not safe to attack so\r\ngallant a warrior, and the nephew of the powerful constable. Yet the\r\naudible murmurs of the opposite party announced their ill-will.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of Montluc, Bishop of Valence.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The remedy prescribed.]\r\n\r\nThe fearlessness of the admiral, however, kindled to a brighter flame\r\nthe courage of others. Strange as it may appear, toleration and reform\r\nfound their warmest and most uncompromising advocates on the episcopal\r\nbench.[891] Montluc, Bishop of Valence, drew a startling contrast\r\nbetween the means that had been taken to propagate the new doctrines,\r\nand those by which the attempt had been made to eradicate them. For\r\nthirty years, three or four hundred ministers of irreproachable morals,\r\nindomitable courage, and notable diligence in the study of the Holy\r\nScriptures, had been attracting disciples by the sweet name of Jesus\r\ncontinually upon their lips, and had easily gained over a people that\r\nwere as sheep without a shepherd. Meanwhile, popes had been engrossed in\r\nwar and in sowing discord between princes; the ministers of justice had\r\nmade use of the severe enactments of the kings against heresy to enrich\r\nthemselves and their friends; and bishops, instead of showing solicitude\r\nfor their flocks, had sought only to preserve their revenues. Forty\r\nbishops might have been seen at one time congregated at Paris and\r\nindulging in scandalous excesses, while the fire was kindling in their\r\ndioceses.[892] The inferior clergy, who bought their curacies at Rome,\r\nadded ignorance to avarice.[893] The ecclesiastical office became odious\r\nand contemptible when prelates conferred benefices on their barbers,\r\ncooks, and footmen. What must be done to avert the just anger of God?\r\nLet the king, in the first place, see that God's name be no longer\r\nblasphemed as heretofore. Let God's Word be published and expounded. Let\r\nthere be daily sermons in the palace, to stop the mouths of those who\r\nassert that, near the king, God is never spoken of. Let the singing of\r\npsalms take the place of the foolish songs sung by the maids of the\r\nqueens; for to prohibit the singing of psalms, which the Fathers extol,\r\nwould be to give the seditious a good pretext for saying that the war\r\nwas waged not against men, but against God, inasmuch as the publication\r\nand the hearing of His praises were not tolerated. A second remedy was\r\nto be found in a universal council, or, if the sovereign pontiff\r\ncontinued to refuse so just a demand, in a national council, to which\r\nthe most learned of the new sect should be offered safe access. As to\r\npunishments, while the seditious, who took up arms under color of\r\nreligion, ought to be repressed, experience had taught how unavailing\r\nwas the persecution of those who embraced their views from conscientious\r\nmotives, and history showed that three hundred and eighteen bishops at\r\nthe Council of Nice, one hundred and fifty at Constantinople, and six\r\nhundred and thirty at Chalcedon, refused to employ other weapons,\r\nagainst the worst of convicted heretics, than the word of God. Montluc\r\nclosed his eloquent discourse by opposing the proposition to grant the\r\nright of public assembly, because of the dangers to which it might lead;\r\nbut advocated a wise discrimination in the punishment of offenders,\r\naccording to their respective numbers and apparent motives.[894]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Address of Archbishop Marillac.]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Vienne, the virtuous Marillac, an elegant and\r\neffective orator, made a still more cogent speech. He regarded the\r\nGeneral Council as the best remedy for present dissensions; but it was\r\nin vain to expect one, since, between the Pope, the emperor, the kings,\r\nand the Lutherans, the right time, place, and method of holding it could\r\nnever be agreed upon by all; and France was like a man desperately ill,\r\nwhose fever admitted of no delay that a physician might be called in\r\nfrom a distance. Hence, the usual resort to a national council, in spite\r\nof the Pope's discontent, was imperative. _France could not afford to\r\ndie in order to please his Holiness._[895] Meanwhile, the prelates must\r\nbe obliged to reside in their dioceses; nor must the Italians, those\r\nleeches that absorbed one-third of all the benefices and an infinite\r\nnumber of pensions, be exempted from the operation of the general\r\nrule.[896] Would paid troops be permitted thus to absent themselves from\r\ntheir posts in the hour of danger? Simony must be abolished at once, as\r\na token of sincerity in the desire to reform the church. Otherwise\r\nChrist would come down and drive his unworthy servants from His church,\r\nas He once drove the money-changers from the temple. Especially must\r\nchurchmen repent with fasting, and take up the word of God, which is a\r\n_sword_, \"whereas, at present,\" said the speaker, \"_we have only the\r\nscabbard--in mitres and croziers, in rochets and tiaras_.\" Everything\r\nthat tended to disturb the public tranquillity, whether from seditious\r\nleaders, or from equally seditious zealots, must be repressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The States General must be called.]\r\n\r\nNor was the advice given by Marillac for securing the continued\r\nobedience of the people less sound. He regarded the assembling of the\r\nStates General as indispensable, in view of the great debts and burdens\r\nof the people. He warned the king's counsellors lest the people,\r\naccustomed to have its complaints of grievances unattended to, should\r\nbegin to lose the hope of relief, and lest the proverbial promptness and\r\ngentleness which the French nation had always shown in meeting the\r\nking's necessities should be so badly met and so frequently offended as\r\nat last to turn into rage and despair.[897]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of Admiral Coligny.]\r\n\r\nSuch was \"the learned, wise, and Christian harangue,\" as the chronicler\r\nwell styles it, of \"an old man eloquent,\" whom, like another Isocrates,\r\n\"the dishonest victory\" of his country's real enemies was destined to\r\n\"kill with report.\" The profound impression it made was deepened by the\r\nspeech of Admiral Coligny, whose turn it was, on the next day (the\r\ntwenty-fourth of August), to announce his sentiments, he declared\r\nhimself ready to pledge life and all he held most dear, that the hatred\r\nof the people was in no wise directed against the king, but against his\r\nministers, whom he loudly blamed for surrounding their master with a\r\nguard, as though he needed this protection against his loyal subjects.\r\nSupporting the proposition of the Archbishop of Vienne for assembling\r\nthe States General, the admiral advocated, in addition, the immediate\r\ndismissal of the guard, in order to remove all jealousy between king and\r\npeople, and the discontinuance of persecution, until such time as a\r\ncouncil--general or national--might be assembled. Meanwhile, he advised\r\nthat the requests of the reformed, whose petitions he had presented, be\r\ngranted; that the Protestants be allowed to assemble for the purpose of\r\npraying to God, hearing the preaching of His word, and celebrating the\r\nholy sacraments. If houses of worship were given them in every place,\r\nand the judges were instructed to see to the maintenance of the peace,\r\nhe felt confident that the kingdom would at once become quiet and the\r\nsubjects be satisfied.[898]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejoinder of the Duke of Guise.]\r\n\r\nThe Guises spoke on the same day. The duke made a short, but passionate\r\nrejoinder to Coligny, and gave little or no attention to the question\r\nproposed for deliberation. He bitterly retorted to the proposal for the\r\ndismissal of the body-guard, by saying that it had been placed around\r\nthe king only since the discovery of the treasonable plot of Amboise,\r\nand he indignantly maintained that a conspiracy against ministers was\r\nonly a cover for designs against their master. As for the announcement\r\nof the admiral that he could bring fifty thousand names to his\r\npetitions, which he construed as a personal threat, he angrily replied\r\nthat if that or a greater number of the Huguenot sect should present\r\nthemselves, the king would oppose them with a million men of his\r\nown.[899] The question of religion he left to be discussed by others of\r\nmore learning; but well was he assured that not all the councils of the\r\nworld would detach him from the ancient faith. The assembling of the\r\nStates he referred to the king's discretion.[900]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cardinal of Lorraine is more politic.]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was more politic, and suppressed the manifestation of that\r\ndeadly hatred which, from this time forward, the brothers cherished\r\nagainst Coligny. He declared, however, that, although the petitioners\r\nlaid claim to such loyalty, their true character was apparent from the\r\naffair at Amboise, as well as from the daily issue of libellous\r\npamphlets and placards, of which he had not less than twenty-two on his\r\ntable directed against himself, which he carefully preserved as his best\r\neulogium and claim to immortality. He advocated the severe repression of\r\nthe seditious; yet, with a stretch of hypocrisy and mendacity uncommon\r\neven with a Guise, he expressed himself as for his own part very sorry\r\nthat such \"grievous executions\" had been inflicted upon those who went\r\n\"without arms and from fear of being damned to hear preaching, or who\r\nsang psalms, neglected the mass, or engaged in other observances of\r\ntheirs,\" and as being in favor of no longer inflicting such useless\r\npunishments! Nay, he would that his life or death might be of some\r\nservice in bringing back the wanderers to the path of truth. He opposed\r\na council as unnecessary--it could not do otherwise than decide as its\r\npredecessors--but consented to a convocation of the clergy for the\r\nreformation of manners. The States General he thought might well be\r\ngathered to see with what prudence the administration of public affairs\r\nhad been carried on.[901]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of the Assembly of Fontainebleau.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The States General to be convened.]\r\n\r\nWith the Cardinal of Lorraine the discussion ended. All the knights of\r\nthe order of St. Michael acquiesced in his opinions, but indulged in no\r\nfarther remarks. On the twenty-sixth of August the decision was\r\nannounced. The States General were to convene on the tenth of December,\r\nat Meaux, or such other city as the king might hereafter prefer. A month\r\nlater (on the twentieth of January) the prelates were to come together\r\nwherever the king might be, thence to proceed to the national, or to the\r\ngeneral council, if such should be held. Meanwhile, in each bailiwick\r\nand \"sénéchaussée,\" the three orders were to be separately assembled, in\r\norder to prepare minutes of their grievances, and elect delegates to the\r\nStates General; and all legal proceedings and all punishment for the\r\nmatter of religion were to be suspended save in the case of those who\r\nassembled in arms and were seditious.[902]\r\n\r\nSuch was the history of this famous assembly, in which, for the first\r\ntime, the Huguenots found a voice; where views were calmly expressed\r\nrespecting toleration and the necessity of a council, which a year\r\nbefore had been punished with death; where the chief persecutor of the\r\nreformed doctrines, carried away by the current, was induced to avow\r\nliberal principles.[903] This was progress enough for a single year. The\r\nenterprise of Amboise was not all in vain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New alarms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine and Condé summoned to court.]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Fontainebleau had not dispersed when the court was\r\nthrown into fresh alarm. An agent of the King of Navarre, named La\r\nSague, was discovered almost by accident, who, after delivering letters\r\nfrom his master to various friends in the neighborhood of Paris, was\r\nabout to return southward with their friendly responses. He had\r\nimprudently given a treacherous acquaintance to understand that a\r\nformidable uprising was contemplated; and letters found upon his person\r\nseemed to bear out the assertion. The most cruel tortures were resorted\r\nto in order to elicit accusations against the Bourbons from suspected\r\npersons.[904] Among others, François de Vendôme, Vidame of Chartres, one\r\nof the correspondents, was (on the twenty-seventh of August) thrown into\r\nthe Bastile.[905] Three days later a messenger was despatched by the\r\nking to Antoine of Navarre, requesting him at once to repair to the\r\ncapital, and to bring with him his brother Condé, against whom the\r\ncharge had for six months been rife, that he was the head of secret\r\nenterprises, set on foot to disturb the peace of the realm.[906] At the\r\nsame time an urgent request was sent to Philip the Second for\r\nassistance.[907]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip adverse to a national council.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Projects to crush all heresy and its abettors.]\r\n\r\nNor was his Catholic Majesty reluctant to grant help--at least on paper.\r\nBut he accompanied his promises with advice. In particular, he sent Don\r\nAntonio de Toledo to dissuade the French government from holding a\r\nnational council in Paris for the reformation of religion, as he\r\nunderstood it was proposed to do during the coming winter. This, he\r\nrepresented, would be prejudicial to their joint interests; \"for, should\r\nthe French alter anything, the King of Spain would be constrained to\r\nadmit the like in all his countries.\" To which it was replied in\r\nFrancis's name, that \"he would first assemble his three estates, and\r\nthere propone the matter to see what would be advised for the manner of\r\na calling a general council, not minding _without urgent necessity_ to\r\nassemble a council national.\" As to the Spanish help, conditioned on the\r\nprudence of the French government, the Argus-eyed Throkmorton, who by\r\nhis paid agents could penetrate into the boudoirs of his\r\nfellow-diplomatists and read their most cherished secrets,[908] wrote to\r\nQueen Elizabeth that a gentleman had reported to him that he had seen\r\n\"at the Pope's nuncio's hands a letter from the nuncio in Spain, wherein\r\nthe aids were promised, and that the King of Spain had written to the\r\nFrench king that he would not only help him to suppress all heresy,\r\ntrouble, and rebellion in France, but also join him to cause all such\r\nothers as will not submit to the See Apostolic to come to order.\" In\r\nfact, Throkmorton was enabled to say just how many men were to come from\r\nFlanders, and how many from Spain, and how many were to enter by way of\r\nNarbonne, and how many by way of Navarre. Quick work was to be made of\r\nschism, heresy, and rebellion in France. \"This done, and the parties for\r\nreligion clean overthrown,\" added the ambassador, \"these princes have\r\nalready accorded to convert their power towards England and Geneva,\r\nwhich they take to be the occasioners and causers of all their\r\ntroubles.\"[909]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navarre's irresolution embarrasses Montbrun.]\r\n\r\nThe King of Navarre had, even before the receipt of the royal summons,\r\ndiscovered the mistake he had committed in not listening to the counsel,\r\nand copying the example of the constable, who had come to Fontainebleau\r\nwell attended by retainers. Unhappily, the irresolution into which he\r\nnow fell led to the loss of a capital opportunity. The levies ordered by\r\nFrancis in Dauphiny, for the purpose of assisting the papal legate in\r\nexpelling Montbrun from the \"Comtât,\" enabled the Sieur de Maligny to\r\ncollect a large Huguenot force without attracting notice. It had been\r\narranged that these troops should be first employed in seizing the\r\nimportant city of Lyons for the King of Navarre. A part of the Huguenot\r\nsoldiers had, indeed, already been secretly introduced into the\r\ncity,[910] when letters were received from the irresolute Antoine\r\nindefinitely postponing the undertaking. After having for several days\r\ndeliberated respecting his best course of conduct in these unforeseen\r\ncircumstances, Maligny decided to withdraw as quietly as he had come;\r\nbut a porter, who had caught a glimpse of the arms collected in one of\r\nthe places of rendezvous, informed the commandant of the city. In the\r\nstreet engagement which ensued the Huguenots were successful, and for\r\nseveral hours held possession of the city from the Rhône to the Saône.\r\nFinding it impossible, however, to collect the whole force to carry out\r\nhis original design, Maligny retired under cover of the night, and was\r\nso fortunate as to suffer little loss.[911]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _people_ not discouraged.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The fashion of Geneva.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books from Geneva destroyed.]\r\n\r\nMaligny's failure disconcerted Montbrun and Mouvans, with whom he had\r\nintended to co-operate, but had little effect in repressing the courage\r\nof the Huguenot _people_. Of this the royal despatches are the best\r\nevidence. Francis wrote to Marshal de Termes that since the Assembly of\r\nFontainebleau there had been public and armed gatherings _in an infinite\r\nnumber of places_, where previously there had been only secret meetings.\r\nIn Périgord, Agenois, and Limousin, _an infinite number_ of scandalous\r\nacts were daily committed by the seditious, who in most places _lived\r\nafter the fashion of Geneva_. Such _canaille_ must be \"wiped out.\"[912]\r\nA month later those pestilent \"books from Geneva\" turn up again. Count\r\nde Villars, acting for Constable Montmorency in his province of\r\nLanguedoc, had burned two mule-loads of very handsomely bound volumes,\r\nmuch to the regret of many of the Catholic troopers, who grudged the\r\ndevouring flames a sacrifice worth more than a thousand crowns.[913] But\r\nhe quickly followed up the chronicle of this valiant action with a\r\ncomplaint of his impotence to reduce the sectaries to submission. The\r\nHuguenots of Nismes had taken courage, and guarded their gates. So, or\r\neven worse, was it of Montpellier[914] and Pézénas. Other cities were\r\nabout to follow their example.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fifteen cities in one province receive ministers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The children learn religion in the Geneva catechism.]\r\n\r\nThese were but the beginnings of evil. Three days passed, and the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Languedoc sent a special messenger to the king,\r\nto inform him of the rapid progress of the contagion. Fifteen of the\r\nmost considerable cities of the province had openly received\r\nministers.[915] Ten thousand foot and five hundred horse would be needed\r\nto reduce them, and, when taken, they must be held by garrisons, and\r\npunished by loss of their municipal privileges.[916] A fortnight more\r\nelapsed. Three or four thousand inhabitants of Nismes had retired in\r\narms to the neighboring Cevennes.[917] When they descended into the\r\nplain, a larger number, who had submitted on the approach of the\r\nsoldiery, would unite with them and form a considerable army. \"Heresy,\r\nalas, gains ground daily,\" despondingly writes Villars; \"_the children\r\nlearn religion only in the catechism brought from Geneva; all know it by\r\nheart_.\" The cause of the evil he seemed to find in the\r\ncircumstance--undoubtedly favorable to the Huguenots--that, of\r\ntwenty-two bishops whose dioceses lay in Languedoc, all but five or six\r\nwere non-residents.[918]\r\n\r\nTo all which lamentations the answer came back after the accustomed\r\nfashion: \"Slay, hang without respect to the forms of law; send lesser\r\nculprits, if preferable, to the galleys.\"[919]\r\n\r\nIn Normandy, too, it began to be impossible for the Huguenots to conceal\r\nthemselves. At Rouen, in spite of the severe penalties threatened, seven\r\nthousand persons gathered in the new market-place, on the twenty-sixth\r\nof August, \"singing psalms, and with their preacher in the midst on a\r\nchair preaching to them,\" while five hundred men with arquebuses stood\r\naround the crowd \"to guard them from the Papists.\" A few days before, at\r\nthe opening of the great fair of Jumièges, a friar, according to custom,\r\nundertook to deliver a sermon; but the people, not liking his doctrine,\r\n\"pulled him out of the pulpit and placed another in his place.\"[920]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elections for the States General.]\r\n\r\nNor was the courage of the Huguenots less clearly manifested a little\r\nlater in the elections preparatory to the holding of the States General.\r\nIn spite of strict injunctions issued by the Cardinal of Lorraine to the\r\nofficers in each bailiwick and sénéchaussée, to prevent the debate of\r\ngrievances from touching upon the authority of the Guises or that of the\r\nChurch, and especially to defeat the election of any but undoubted\r\nfriends of the Roman Church, his friends were successful in neither\r\nattempt. The voice of the oppressed people made itself heard in\r\nthunder-tones at Blois, at Angers,[921] and elsewhere. Even in\r\nParis--the stronghold of the Roman faith--the reformed ventured, in face\r\nof a vast numerical majority against them, to urge in the Hôtel-de-Ville\r\nthe insertion of their remonstrances in the \"cahiers\" of the city. Of\r\nthirteen provinces, ten addressed such complaints to the States\r\nGeneral.[922]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clerical demands at Poitiers.]\r\n\r\nBut the clerical order did not forget its old demands, even where the\r\nTiers État leaned to toleration. The provincial estates of Poitou,\r\nmeeting in the Dominican convent of Poitiers, presented a contrast of\r\nthis kind. The delegates of the people, after listening to the eloquent\r\nappeal of an intrepid Huguenot pastor, determined to petition the States\r\nGeneral for the free exercise of the reformed religion. The\r\nrepresentatives of the church made its complaints regarding the\r\n\"ravishing wolves, false preachers, and their adherents, who are to-day\r\nin so great numbers that there are not so many true sheep knowing the\r\nvoice of their shepherds.\" The \"mild and holy admonitions\" of the church\r\nhaving been thrown away upon these reprobates, the clergy proposed to\r\nopen a register of all that should neglect to receive the sacrament at\r\nEaster, and to attend the church services with regularity. And it made\r\nthe modest demand that all persons honored with an entry in this book\r\nshould, as heretics, be deprived of all right to make contracts, that\r\ntheir wills be declared hull and void, and that all their property--in\r\nparticular all houses in which preaching had been held--be confiscated.\r\nOf course, the aid of the secular arm was invoked, in view of \"the great\r\nnumber and power of the said heretics.\"[923]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theodore Beza invited to Nérac.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jeanne d'Albret.]\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of July, at the urgent request of the King and Queen of\r\nNavarre, the \"Venerable Company of the Pastors of Geneva\" had sent the\r\neloquent Theodore Beza to Gascony \"to instruct\" the royal family in the\r\nword of God.[924] In the dress of a nobleman he had traversed France and\r\nreached Nérac in safety. Here he at once exercised a powerful influence\r\nupon the king. The fickle mind of Antoine was susceptible of no deep\r\nimpressions; but it was very easily affected for the time. His queen,\r\nJeanne d'Albret, was his very opposite in mental and moral constitution.\r\nWhereas the very first blast threw him into a fervor of enthusiastic\r\ndevotion to the purer faith, the heart of the queen--a woman not made to\r\nbe led, but to lead--yielded slowly to the melting influences of the\r\nGospel. But it never lost its glow. Jeanne came very reluctantly to the\r\ndetermination to cast in her lot with the Reformation. She hesitated to\r\nrisk the loss of her possessions, and regretted to abandon the\r\nattractions of the world. When, however, the decision was once made, the\r\nquestion was never reopened for fresh deliberation.[925]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine's short-lived zeal.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New pressure upon Navarre and Condé.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navarre's concessions.]\r\n\r\nAt this time, Antoine, we are told, renounced the mass, and was supposed\r\nto think, as he certainly spoke, of nothing but the means of advancing\r\nthe cause in which he had embarked. Beza preached before him in one of\r\nthe churches, and all signs pointed to the rapid establishment of the\r\nReformation on a firm basis. The eloquent orator added his persuasion to\r\nthe entreaties of the representatives of the Protestant churches of\r\nFrance and the exhortations of Constable Montmorency. All had urged\r\nAntoine to make his appearance at Fontainebleau with a powerful escort.\r\nWe have seen the ill-success with which the joint effort was attended.\r\nThe spies whom the Guises kept in pay around the King of Navarre, in the\r\npersons of his most intimate advisers, deterred him from a movement\r\nwhich they portrayed as fraught with peril. A few days after the\r\nconclusion of the assembly came the king's summons. To this Antoine at\r\nfirst replied that, if the accusers of his brother, of whose innocence\r\nhe was fully persuaded, would declare themselves, and if he were assured\r\nthat impartial justice would be shown, he would come to the court in\r\ncompany with few attendants. Condé wrote, at the same time, and\r\nexpressed perfect confidence in his ability to disprove all the\r\nallegations against him, provided a safe access to the court was\r\nafforded him. On this point the suspicions of the Bourbon princes were\r\nsoon set at rest by new letters from the king and his mother, assuring\r\nthem that they would find not only security, but an opportunity to\r\nrefute charges which Francis and Catharine professed themselves\r\nunwilling to credit.[926] To these reassuring words were joined the\r\nsolicitations of their own brother, the shallow Cardinal of\r\nBourbon,[927] and of the Cardinal of Armagnac. The princes, already\r\ndiscouraged by tidings of the failure of the projects of Montbrun,\r\nMouvans and Maligny in the east, lent too ready an ear to these\r\nsuggestions. The first open manifestation of weakness was when the King\r\nand Queen of Navarre, with their son, young Prince Henry of Béarn,\r\nconsented to hear mass in the presence of many of their courtiers. But\r\nthe extent of Antoine's concessions was, for a time, kept concealed from\r\nhis followers. At the very moment when Beza was diligently visiting the\r\nwell affected nobles, and urging them to lend prompt assistance, the\r\nGuises were exulting, with joy mingled with fear, over the promise given\r\nby Antoine to the Count of Crussol, that he would come, with an\r\ninsignificant escort to Orleans, whither Francis had advanced. The\r\ntidings appeared too good to be true.[928] For, although the French king\r\nhad received assurances of assistance from Philip--who was reported by\r\nthe French envoy at Toledo to be favorable to the exercise of any\r\nseverity against the Bourbon princes,[929] so great was his personal\r\nenmity toward them--yet the same ambassador had not failed to inform\r\nCharles that the troops ostensibly prepared for a French campaign were\r\nreally intended for Italy and to make good the Spanish monarch's losses\r\nin Africa. On the other hand, unless Philip could send six hundred\r\nthousand or seven hundred thousand crowns to Flanders to pay arrearages\r\nand debts, he could not move a soldier across the lines from that\r\nquarter.[930]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenot gentry offer him aid.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He dismisses his escort.]\r\n\r\nThe strictest orders had been given to the commandants of important\r\npoints, such as Bordeaux and Poitiers, through which Antoine might\r\nintend passing, to guard them against him, in case of his showing any\r\ninclination to come otherwise than peaceably.[931] These precautions,\r\nhowever, proved unnecessary. Antoine intended to abide by his\r\nengagement. When by slow stages he had at length reached Limoges, he\r\nfound a number of friendly noblemen awaiting him. In a few days more\r\nseven or eight hundred gentlemen had come in, well equipped and armed.\r\nThey begged him at once to declare for the liberation of France,\r\naccording to his previous promises. The nobility, they said, were only\r\nwaiting for the word of command. Meanwhile Gascony, Poitou, and the\r\ncoasts offered six or seven thousand foot soldiers, already enrolled\r\nunder captains, and prepared to defend him against present attack.\r\nProvence and Languedoc would march to his assistance with three or four\r\nthousand horse and foot. Normandy would raise as many more. He would at\r\nonce become so formidable that, without a blow, he could assume the\r\nguardianship of the king. Bourges and Orleans would fall into his hands,\r\nand the States General be held free of constraint. The very forces of\r\nthe enemy would desert the sinking cause of the hated Guises. As for the\r\nnecessary funds, with the best filled purses in France at his command,\r\nhe could scarcely feel any lack. The suggestions of the Huguenot lords,\r\nbacked by the entreaties of Beza, were, however, overborne by the\r\nsecret insinuations of his treacherous counsellors. At Verteuil--a few\r\nleagues beyond--Navarre clearly announced his intentions, and dismissed\r\nhis numerous friends with hearty thanks for their kind attentions. He\r\nwould ask the king's pardon for those who had accompanied him thus far\r\nin arms. \"Pardon!\" replied one of the gentlemen, \"think only of very\r\nhumbly asking it for yourself, who are going to give yourself up as a\r\nprisoner with the halter around your neck. So far as I can see, you have\r\nmore need of it than we have, who have determined not to sell our lives\r\nat so cheap a rate, but to die fighting rather than submit to the mercy\r\nof those detested enemies of the king. And since we are miserably\r\nforsaken by our leaders, we hope that God will raise up others to free\r\nus from the oppression of these tyrants.\"[932] This retort proving\r\nfutile, as did also the warning of the Princess of Condé, who wrote and\r\nsent a messenger to her husband to escape from the toils of his enemies\r\nwhile it was still possible, the Huguenot gentry retired in disgust; and\r\nBeza seized the first opportunity (on the seventeenth of October) to\r\nsteal away from the King of Navarre, and undertake his perilous return\r\nto Geneva, which he succeeded in reaching after a series of hair-breadth\r\nescapes.[933]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Infatuation of the Bourbons.]\r\n\r\nThe King of Navarre had disregarded the counsels of Calvin and other\r\nprudent advisers, who believed that, if he presented himself with a\r\npowerful escort at the gates of Orleans, the Guises would yield without\r\na blow.[934] Antoine felt confident that his enemies would never venture\r\nto lay hands on a prince of the royal blood. His blind infatuation\r\nseemed to infect Condé also. Their presumption was somewhat shaken when\r\nthe royal governor of Poitiers forbade their entrance into that city.\r\nBut the depth of the ruin into which they had plunged was more clearly\r\nrevealed to their eyes as they began to approach Orleans. Friendly\r\nvoices whispered the existence of a plan for their destruction; friendly\r\nhands offered to effect their escape to Angers, and thence into\r\nNormandy.[935] But the die was cast. Hostile troops enveloped them, and\r\nthey resolved to continue their journey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They reach Orleans.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condé arrested.]\r\n\r\nNavarre had figured upon the journey much as a provost-marshal leading\r\nhis brother to prison.[936] Now the imaginary resemblance was turned\r\ninto a sad reality. On Thursday, the thirty-first of October, the\r\nBourbons reached Orleans.[937] Their reception soon convinced them that\r\nthey had placed their heads in the jaws of the lion. None of the\r\ncourtiers save the cardinal, their brother, and La Roche-sur-Yon, their\r\ncousin, deigned to do them honor. That very day, after a few angry\r\naccusations from Francis, and a courageous vindication of his conduct by\r\nthe chivalrous prince, Condé was arrested in the king's presence and by\r\nhis order.[938] The King of Navarre also was, indeed, little better than\r\na prisoner, so closely did he find himself watched.[939] In vain did\r\nNavarre remonstrate and plead the royal promise of security, offering\r\nhimself to become a surety for his brother; the king denied redress.\r\nThen it was that Condé turned to the Cardinal of Bourbon, one of the few\r\nthat had come to do him honor and said: \"Sir, by your assurances you\r\nhave delivered up your own brother to death.\"[940] Others shared in\r\nCondé's misfortune. Madame de Roye, his mother-in-law and a sister of\r\nAdmiral Coligny, was brought a prisoner to St. Germain, and a careful\r\nsearch was made among her papers and elsewhere for the purpose of\r\nobtaining proofs of Condé's guilt.[941]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of Renée of Ferrara.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this inauspicious moment that a distinguished princess reached\r\nOrleans, after an absence of thirty-two years from her native land, and\r\nwas received with marked honors by the king and all the court, who went\r\nout to meet her and escort her to the city.[942] This was the celebrated\r\nRenée, younger daughter of Louis the Twelfth, and widow of Ercole, Duke\r\nof Ferrara, now returning, after the death of her husband, to spend her\r\ndeclining years at her retreat of Montargis on the Loing. The scene\r\nwhich she beheld awakened in her breast regret and indignation which she\r\nwas not slow in expressing. To the Duke of Guise, who had married her\r\ndaughter, Anne d'Este, she administered a severe rebuke. \"Had I been\r\npresent,\" she said, \"I would have prevented this ill-advised step. It is\r\nno trifling matter to treat a prince of the blood in such a manner. The\r\nwound is one that will long bleed; for no man has ever yet attacked the\r\nblood of France but he has had reason to regret it.\"[943]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condé's courage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His wife repulsed.]\r\n\r\nThe courage of the imprisoned prince rose with his misfortunes. The\r\nhouse in which he was incarcerated was flanked by a tower whose\r\nembrasures commanded the approach, the windows were newly barred, and\r\nthe door was half-walled up to preclude the possibility of escape.[944]\r\nBut Prince Louis stoutly maintained that it was not _he_ that was a\r\ncaptive, since, though his body was confined, his spirit was free and\r\nhis conscience clean and guiltless; but rather _they_ were prisoners,\r\nwho, with the freedom of their body, felt their conscience to be\r\nenslaved and harassed by a ceaseless recollection of their crimes.[945]\r\nHis wife, the virtuous Éléonore de Roye, fruitlessly applied for\r\nadmission in order to minister to his wants. She was rudely repulsed by\r\nthe king, at whose feet she had thrown herself in a flood of tears, with\r\nthe bitter remark that her husband was his mortal enemy, who had\r\nconspired not only to obtain his crown, but his life also, and that he\r\ncould do no less than avenge himself upon him.[946] It was only by\r\nspecial effort that the few who dared avow themselves friends of the\r\ndisgraced Bourbons, succeeded in obtaining for Condé legal counsel, and\r\nthat these were allowed to hold brief interviews with the prince in the\r\npresence of two officers of the crown.[947] No others were admitted,\r\nsave a pretended friend, to sound his disposition toward the Guises.\r\nComprehending the motive of his visit, Condé begged him to inform those\r\nwho had sent him, \"that he had received so many outrages at their hands\r\nthat there remained no path of reconciliation, save at the point of the\r\nsword; and that, although he seemed to be at their mercy, he still had\r\nconfidence that God would avenge the injury done by them to a prince who\r\nhad come at the command and relying on the word of his king, but had\r\nbeen shamefully imprisoned at their suggestion, in order to make in him\r\na beginning of the destruction of the royal blood.\"[948]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condé tried by a commission.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is found guilty and sentenced to be beheaded.]\r\n\r\nA commission, consisting of Chancellor L'Hospital, President De Thou,\r\nCounsellors Faye and Viole, and a few others, was appointed, on the\r\nthirteenth of November, to conduct the trial. Condé refused to plead\r\nbefore them, taking refuge in his privilege, as a prince, to be tried\r\nonly before the king and by his peers.[949] His appeals, however, were\r\nrejected by the privy council, and he was commanded, in the king's name,\r\nto answer, under pain of being held a traitor. In view of the known\r\ndesire and intention of the king and his chief advisers, the trial was\r\nlikely to be expeditious and not over-scrupulous.[950] The most innocent\r\nexpressions of disapproval of the violent executions at Amboise were\r\nperverted into open approval of a plot against the king. The prosecution\r\nsought to establish the heresy of the prince, in order to furnish some\r\nground for finding him guilty of treason against Divine as well as royal\r\nauthority. Nor was this difficult. A priest, in full officiating\r\nvestments, was introduced, as by royal command, to say mass in Condé's\r\npresence. But the young Bourbon drove him out with rough words,\r\ndeclaring \"that he had come to his Majesty with no intention of holding\r\nany communion with the impieties and defilements of the Roman\r\nAntichrist, but solely to relieve himself of the false accusations that\r\nhad been made against him.\"[951] Before so partial a court the trial\r\ncould have but one issue. Condé was found guilty, and condemned to be\r\nbeheaded on a scaffold erected before the king's temporary residence, at\r\nthe opening of the States General.[952] The sentence was signed not\r\nonly by the judges to whom the investigation had been entrusted, but by\r\nmembers of the privy council, by the members of the Order of St.\r\nMichael, and by a large number of less important dignitaries, without\r\neven a formal examination into the merits of the case--so anxious were\r\nthe Guises to involve as many influential persons as possible in the\r\nsame responsibility with themselves. Of the privy councillors, Du\r\nMortier and Chancellor de l'Hospital alone refused to append their\r\nsignatures without a longer term for reflection, and endeavored to ward\r\noff the blow by procrastination.[953]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of the King of Navarre.]\r\n\r\nNavarre was himself in almost equal danger. An attempt to poison him was\r\nfrustrated by its timely revelation; a plot to assassinate him on\r\nleaving the king's residence, by the strength of his body-guard. A still\r\nmore atrocious scheme was concocted. Francis was to stab his cousin of\r\nNavarre with his dagger, leaving his attendants to despatch him with\r\ntheir swords. Such murderous projects can rarely be kept secret. Even\r\nCatharine de' Medici is said to have attempted to dissuade Antoine from\r\ngoing to the palace by warning him of the danger he would incur. At the\r\ndoor of the king's chamber a friendly hand interposed, and a friendly\r\nvoice asked: \"Sire, whither are you going to your ruin?\" But the prince,\r\nwith a resolution which it had been well had he manifested at an earlier\r\nperiod, paused only a moment to say to his faithful Renty: \"I am going\r\nto the spot where a conspiracy has been entered into to take my life....\r\nIf it please God, He will save me; but, if I die, I entreat you, by the\r\nfidelity I have ever known in you, ... to carry the shirt I wear, all\r\ncovered with blood, to my wife and son, and to conjure my wife, by the\r\ngreat love she has always borne me, and by her duty (since my son is\r\nnot yet old enough to avenge my death), to send it, torn by the dagger,\r\nand bloody, to the foreign princes of Christendom, that they may avenge\r\nmy death, so cruel and treacherous.\"[954] These gloomy forebodings were\r\nnot destined to be realized. Francis's anger evaporated in words, or was\r\nrestrained by his mother's secret injunctions,[955] and Antoine of\r\nNavarre was suffered to go away unharmed. The duke and cardinal, who\r\nwitnessed the scene from the recess of a window, are said to have\r\nmuttered half audibly as they left the room, \"That is the most cowardly\r\nheart that ever was!\"[956]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A plot for the utter destruction of the Huguenots.]\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the King of Navarre was, however, but a part of a\r\nlarger plot for the utter destruction of the Huguenots and of\r\nProtestantism in France, the details of which are but imperfectly\r\nknown.[957] It is alleged that preliminary lists of those infected by\r\nheresy had been obtained from all parts of France, and that a more exact\r\nknowledge was to be obtained by compelling all classes--from the\r\nnobility and members of the Order of St. Michael down to the simple\r\ncitizen--to subscribe to the articles of faith drawn up eighteen years\r\nbefore by the Sorbonne.[958] At the close of the sessions of the States\r\nGeneral, the full forces at the command of the court were to be set on\r\nfoot, and four armies, under the Duke of Aumale and Marshals St. André,\r\nBrissac, and Termes, were to serve as the instruments of destruction.\r\nTermes was to effect a junction with a Spanish force entering France\r\nthrough Béarn; and the Governor of Bayonne was instructed to surrender\r\nthat important city into the hands of Philip. The expenses of the\r\ncrusade were to be defrayed by the clergy, who, from cardinal down to\r\nchaplain, were to retain of their income only the amount necessary for\r\ntheir bare subsistence.[959] The recent publication of the Pope's bull,\r\nrenewing the Council of Trent, meanwhile served as a good excuse for\r\nforbidding the discussion of religious questions by the States General,\r\nthen about to meet, by the king's direction, at Orleans instead of\r\nMeaux.[960]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illness of the king.]\r\n\r\nThe moment for the execution of this widespread plan of destruction was\r\napproaching, when its devisers were startled by the sudden discovery\r\nthat the health of their nephew, the king, was fast failing. Francis's\r\nconstitution, always frail, and now still further undermined, was giving\r\nway in connection with a gathering in the ear, which resisted the\r\nefforts of the most skilful physicians.[961] \"This King,\" wrote the\r\nEnglish ambassador, on the twenty-first of November, giving to his\r\nfellow-envoy at Madrid the first intimation of Francis's illness,\r\n\"thought to have removed hence for a fortnight, but the day before his\r\nintended journey he felt himself somewhat evil disposed of his body,\r\nwith a pain in his head and one of his ears, which hath stayed his\r\nremoving from hence.\"[962] But the rapid progress of the disease soon\r\nmade it clear that the trip to Chenonceau, \"the queen's house,\" whence\r\nthe king \"was not to return hither until the Estates are assembled,\"\r\nwould never be taken by Francis. The sceptre must pass into other hands\r\neven more feeble than his.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The queen mother rejects the advances of the Guises,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and makes terms with Navarre.]\r\n\r\nThe Guises in consternation proposed to Catharine to hasten the death of\r\nNavarre and Condé,[963] and perhaps to put into immediate execution\r\ntheir ulterior projects. But Catharine de' Medici little relished an\r\nincreased dependence[964] upon a family she had good reason to distrust.\r\nInstead of accepting the advances of the Guises, she hastened to make\r\nterms with the King of Navarre. In an interview with that weak prince, a\r\ncompact was made which proved the source of untold evils. He had been\r\nforewarned by ladies in Catharine's interest, as he valued his life, to\r\noppose none of her demands; but the wily Florentine scarcely expected so\r\neasy a triumph as she obtained. To the amazement of friend and foe,\r\nAntoine de Bourbon ceded his right to the regency, without a struggle,\r\nto the queen mother, a foreigner and not of royal blood. For himself he\r\nmerely retained the first place under her, as lieutenant-general of the\r\nkingdom. He even consented to be reconciled to his cousins of Guise,\r\nand, after publicly embracing them, promised to forget all past grounds\r\nof quarrel.[965]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Francis II., Dec. 5, 1560.]\r\n\r\nThe vows which Francis made \"to God and to all the saints of paradise,\r\nmale and female, and particularly to Notre-Dame-de-Cléry, that, if they\r\nshould grant him restoration of health, he would never cease until he\r\nhad wholly purged the kingdom of those wicked heretics,\"[966] proved\r\nunavailing. On the fifth of December, 1560, he died in the eighteenth\r\nyear of his age and the seventeenth month of his reign. \"God, who\r\npierced the eye of the father, had now stricken the ear of the\r\nson.\"[967]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: \"Epître au Tigre de la Prance.\"]\r\n\r\n     The most annoying of the anonymous pamphlets against the Guises was\r\n     a letter bearing the significant direction: _Au Tigre de la\r\n     France_. Under this bloodthirsty designation every one knew that\r\n     the Cardinal of Lorraine alone could be meant, and the style of\r\n     the production showed that a master-hand in literature had been\r\n     concerned in the composition. The Guises were furious, but it was\r\n     impossible to discover the author or publisher of the libel. Both\r\n     succeeded admirably in preserving their incognito. Yet, as victims\r\n     were wanted to appease the anger of the ruling family, two unhappy\r\n     men expiated by their death a crime of which they were confessedly\r\n     innocent. The incident, which comes down to us attested not only by\r\n     the best of contemporary historians, but by the records of the\r\n     courts, recently brought to light, may serve to illustrate the\r\n     prevalent corruption of the judges and the occasional whimsical\r\n     application of the so-called justice wherein they were given to\r\n     indulging. Diligent search on the part of the friends of the Guises\r\n     led to the detection of only a single copy of the \"Tigre,\" and this\r\n     was found in the house of one Martin Lhomme, or Lhommet, a printer\r\n     by trade, and miserably poor. There was no evidence at all that he\r\n     had had any part in printing or publishing it. None the less did\r\n     the judges of parliament, and particularly M. Du Lyon, to whom the\r\n     case was specially confided, prosecute the trial with relentless\r\n     ardor. On the 15th of July, the unfortunate Lhomme, after having\r\n     been subjected to torture to extract information respecting his\r\n     supposed accomplices, was publicly hung on a gibbet on the Place\r\n     Maubert, in Paris. The well-informed Regnier de La Planche (p. 313)\r\n     is our authority for the statement that Du Lyon having, at a\r\n     supper, a few days later, been called to account for the iniquity\r\n     of his decision, made no attempt to defend it, but exclaimed: \"Que\r\n     voulez-vous? We had to satisfy Monsieur le Cardinal with something,\r\n     since we had failed to catch the author; for otherwise he would\r\n     never have given us any peace (il ne nous eust jamais donné\r\n     relasche).\" Still more unreasonable was the infliction of the\r\n     death-penalty upon Robert Dehors, a merchant of Rouen, who had\r\n     chanced to ride into Paris just as Lhomme was being led to\r\n     execution. Booted as he still was, he became a witness of the\r\n     brutality with which the crowd followed the poor printer, and\r\n     seemed disposed to snatch him from the executioner's hands in order\r\n     to tear him in pieces. Indignant at this violation of decency,\r\n     Dehors had the imprudence to remonstrate with those about him,\r\n     dissuading them from imbruing their hands in the blood of a\r\n     wretched man, when their desire was so soon to be accomplished by\r\n     the minister of the law. The Rouen merchant little understood the\r\n     ferocity of the Parisian populace. The mob instantly turned their\r\n     fury upon him, and but for the intervention of the royal archers he\r\n     would have met on the spot the fate from which he had sought to\r\n     rescue another to whose person and offence he was an utter\r\n     stranger. As it was, he escaped instant death only to become a\r\n     victim to the perverse ingenuity of the same judges, and be hung on\r\n     the same Place Maubert, \"for the sedition and popular commotion\r\n     caused by him, at the time of the execution of Martin Lhomme, by\r\n     means of scandalous expressions and blasphemies uttered and\r\n     pronounced by the said Dehors against the honor of God and of the\r\n     glorious Virgin Mary, wherewith the said prisoner induced the\r\n     people to sedition and public scandals.\" (See Registres du\r\n     parlement, July 13, 15, and 19, 1560, reprinted by Read in \"Le\r\n     Tigre.\")\r\n\r\n     It is not, perhaps, very much to be wondered at that a pamphlet so\r\n     dangerous to have in one's possession should have so thoroughly\r\n     disappeared that a few years since not a copy was known to be in\r\n     existence. It doubtless fared with the \"Tigre\" much as it did with\r\n     another outspoken libel--\"Taxe des parties casuelles de la boutique\r\n     du Pape\"--published a few years later, of which Lestoile (Read, p.\r\n     21) tells us that he was for a long time unsuccessful in the search\r\n     for a copy, to replace that which, to use his own words, \"I burned\r\n     at the St. Bartholomew, _fearing that it might burn me_!\"\r\n\r\n     By a happy accident, M. Louis Paris, in 1834, discovered a solitary\r\n     copy that had apparently been saved from destruction by being\r\n     buried in some provincial library. The discovery, however, was of\r\n     little avail to the literary world, as the pamphlet was eagerly\r\n     bought by the famous collector Brunet, only to find a place in his\r\n     jealously guarded cases, where, after a fashion only too common in\r\n     these days, a few privileged persons were permitted to inspect it\r\n     under glass, but not a soul was allowed to copy it. Fortunately,\r\n     after M. Brunet's death, the city of Paris succeeded in purchasing\r\n     the _seven printed leaves_, of which the precious book was\r\n     composed, for 1,400 francs! Even then the singular fortunes of the\r\n     book did not end. Placed in the Hôtel-de-Ville, this insignificant\r\n     pamphlet, almost alone of all the untold wealth of antiquarian lore\r\n     in the library, escaped the flames kindled by the insane Commune.\r\n     M. Charles Read, the librarian, had taken it to his own house for\r\n     the purpose of copying it and giving it to the world. This design\r\n     has now been happily executed, in an exquisite edition (Paris,\r\n     1875), containing not only the text, illustrated by copious notes,\r\n     but a photographic fac-simile. M. Read has also appended a poem\r\n     entitled \"Le Tigre, Satire sur les Gestes Mémorables des Guisards\r\n     (1561), \"for the recovery of which we are indebted to M. Charles\r\n     Nodier. Although some have imagined this to be the original \"Tigre\"\r\n     which cost the lives of Lhomme and Dehors, it needs only a very\r\n     superficial comparison of the two to convince us that the poem is\r\n     only an elaboration, not indeed without merit, of the more nervous\r\n     prose epistle. The author of the latter was without doubt the\r\n     distinguished _François Hotman_. This point has now been\r\n     established beyond controversy. As early as in 1562 the Guises had\r\n     discovered this; for a treatise published that year in Paris\r\n     (Religionis et Regis adversus exitiosas Calvini, Bezæ, et Ottomani\r\n     conjuratorum factiones defensio) uses the expressions: \"Hic te,\r\n     Ottomane, excutere incipio. Scis enim ex cujus officina _Tigris_\r\n     prodiit, liber certe tigride parente, id est homine barbaro,\r\n     impuro, impio, ingrato, malevolo, maledico dignissimus. Tu te\r\n     istius libelli auctorem ... audes venditare?\" While an expression\r\n     in a letter written by John Sturm, Rector of the University of\r\n     Strasbourg, July, 1562, to Hotman himself (Tygris, immanis illa\r\n     bellua quam tu _hic_ contra Cardinalis existimationem divulgari\r\n     curasti), not only confirms the statement of the hostile Parisian\r\n     pamphleteer, but indicates Strasbourg as the place of publication\r\n     (Read, pp. 132-139).\r\n\r\n     The \"Epistre envoyée au Tigre de la France\" betrays a writer well\r\n     versed in classical oratory. Some of the best of modern French\r\n     critics accord to it the first rank among works of the kind\r\n     belonging to the sixteenth century. They contrast its\r\n     sprightliness, its terse, telling phrases with the heavy, dragging\r\n     constructions that disfigure the prose of contemporary works.\r\n     Without copying in a servile fashion the Catilinarian speeches of\r\n     Cicero, the \"Tigre\" breathes their spirit and lacks none of their\r\n     force. Take, for example, the introductory sentences: \"Tigre\r\n     enragé! Vipère venimeuse! Sépulcre d'abomination! Spectacle de\r\n     malheur! Jusques à quand sera-ce que tu abuseras de la jeunesse de\r\n     nostre Roy? Ne mettras-tu jamais fin à ton ambition démesurée, à\r\n     tes impostures, à tes larcins? Ne vois-tu pas que tout le monde les\r\n     sçait, les entend, les cognoist? Qui penses-tu qui ignore ton\r\n     détestable desseing et qui ne lise en ton visage le malheur de tous\r\n     tes [nos] jours, la ruine de ce Royaume, et la mort de nostre Roy?\"\r\n     Or read the lines in which the writer sums up a portion of the\r\n     Cardinal's villainy: \"Quand je te diray que les fautes des finances\r\n     de France ne viennent que de tes larcins? Quand je te diray qu'un\r\n     mari est plus continent avec sa femme que tu n'es avec tes propres\r\n     parentes? Si je te dis encore que tu t'es emparé du gouvernement de\r\n     la France, et as dérobé cet honneur aux Princes du sang, pour\r\n     mettre la couronne de France en ta maison--que pourras-tu répondre?\r\n     Si tu le confesses, il te faut pendre et estrangler; si tu le nies,\r\n     je te convaincrai.\"\r\n\r\n     A passage of unsurpassed bitterness paints the portrait of the\r\n     hypocritical churchman: \"Tu fais mourir ceux qui conspirent contre\r\n     toy: et tu vis encore, qui as conspiré contre la couronne de\r\n     France, contre les biens des veuves et des orphelins, contre le\r\n     sang des tristes et des innocens! Tu fais profession de prescher de\r\n     sainteté, toy qui ne connois Dieu que de parole; qui ne tiens la\r\n     religion chrétienne que comme un masque pour te déguiser; qui fais\r\n     ordinaire trafic, banque et marchandise d'éveschés et de bénéfices:\r\n     qui ne vois rien de saint que tu ne souilles, rien de chaste que tu\r\n     ne violes, rien de bon que tu ne gâtes!... Tu dis que ceux qui\r\n     reprennent tes vices médisent du Roy, tu veux donc qu'on t'estime\r\n     Roy? Si Cæsar fut occis pour avoir pretendu le sceptre injustement,\r\n     doit-on permettre que tu vives, toy qui le demandes injustement?\"\r\n\r\n     With which terribly severe denunciation the reader may compare the\r\n     statements of a pasquinade, unsurpassed for pungent wit by any\r\n     composition of the times, written apparently about a year later.\r\n     Addressing the cardinal, Pasquin expresses his perplexity\r\n     respecting the place where his Eminence will find an abode. The\r\n     _French_ dislike him so much, that they will have him neither as\r\n     master nor as servant; the _Italians_ know his tricks; the\r\n     _Spaniards_ cannot endure his rage; the _Germans_ abhor incest; the\r\n     _English_ and _Scotch_ hold him to be a traitor; the _Turk_ and the\r\n     _Sophy_ are Mohammedans, while the cardinal believes in _nothing_!\r\n     _Heaven_ is closed against the unbeliever, the devils would be\r\n     afraid to have him in _hell_, and in the ensuing council the\r\n     Protestants are going to do away with _purgatory_! \"Et tu miser,\r\n     ubi peribis?\" Copy in State Paper Office (1561).\r\n\r\n     The peroration of \"Le Tigre\" is worthy of the great Roman orator\r\n     himself. The circumstance that, on account of the limited number of\r\n     copies of M. Read's edition, the \"Tigre\" must necessarily be\r\n     accessible to very few readers, will be sufficient excuse for here\r\n     inserting this extended passage, in which, for the sake of\r\n     clearness, I have followed M. Read's modernized spelling:\r\n\r\n     \"Mais pourquoi dis-je ceci? Afin que tu te corriges? Je connais ta\r\n     jeunesse si envieillie en son obstination, et tes moeurs si\r\n     dépravées, que le récit de tes vices ne te sçauroit émouvoir. Tu\r\n     n'es point de ceux-là que la honte de leur vilainie, ni le remords\r\n     de leurs damnables intentions puisse attirer à aucune résipiscence\r\n     et amendement. Mais si tu me veux croyre, tu t'en iras cacher en\r\n     quelque tannière, ou bien en quelque désert, si lointain que l'on\r\n     n'oye ni vent ni nouvelles de toy! Et par ce moyen tu pourras\r\n     éviter la pointe de cent mille espées qui t'attendent tous les\r\n     jours!\r\n\r\n     \"Donc va-t'-en! Descharge-nous de ta tyrannie! Evite la main du\r\n     bourreau! Qu'attends-tu encore? Ne vois-tu pas la patience des\r\n     princes du sang royal qui te le permet? Attends-tu le commandement\r\n     de leur parolle, puisque leur silence t'a déclaré leur volonté? En\r\n     le souffrant, ils te le commandent; en se taisant, ils te\r\n     condamnent. Va donc, malheureux, et tu éviteras la punition digne\r\n     de tes mérites!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: Reaching Paris early in May, 1560, Hubert Languet wrote\r\nthat suspicion was everywhere rife; men of any standing scarcely dared\r\nto converse with each other; some great calamity seemed on the point of\r\nbreaking forth.

I shall not insist upon the fact\r\nthat the description of La Planche as \"homme politique plustost que\r\nreligieux\" is inappropriate to the author of this history.

The condemnation\r\nof this view certainly does not mark a man of political rather than\r\nreligious tendencies!

But the edict was published\r\n_before_ the appointment of L'Hospital, and while Morvilliers, a\r\ncreature of the Guises, provisionally held the seals after Chancellor\r\nOlivier's death; and the spiritual jurisdiction it established differed\r\nlittle in principle from an inquisition. In fact, three of the French\r\nprelates, the Cardinals of Lorraine, Bourbon, and Châtillon, had, as we\r\nhave seen, been constituted a board of inquisitors of the faith; and,\r\nsoon after the publication of the Edict of Romorantin, the Cardinal of\r\nTournon was set over them as inquisitor-general.

Had Francis lived but a week longer, the ruin of the Huguenots\r\nmight perhaps have been consummated. Condé would have been executed at\r\nthe opening of the States General. Navarre and Montmorency, if no worse\r\ndoom befell them, would have been incarcerated at Loches and Bourges.\r\nThe Estates, deprived of the presence of these leaders, and overawed by\r\nthe formidable military preparations of the Guises,[968] would readily\r\nhave acquiesced in the most extreme measures. Liberty and reform would\r\nhave found a common grave.[969] But a few hours sufficed to disarrange\r\nthis programme. The political power was, at one stroke, transferred from\r\nthe hands of Francis and Charles of Lorraine to those of Catharine de'\r\nMedici and the King of Navarre; and the Protestants of Paris recognized\r\nin the event a direct answer to the petitions which they had offered to\r\nAlmighty God on the recent days of special humiliation and prayer.[970]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alarm of the Guises.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Funeral obsequies of Francis II.]\r\n\r\nThe altered posture of affairs was equally patent to the princes of late\r\ncomplete masters of the destinies of the country. In the first moments\r\nof their excessive terror, they are said to have shut themselves up in\r\ntheir palaces, and to have declined to leave this refuge until assured\r\nthat no immediate violence was contemplated.[971] Even after the\r\nimmediate danger had passed, however, they were too shrewd to pay to the\r\nremains of their nephew the tokens of respect exacted of the constable\r\nin behalf of Henry's corpse,[972] preferring to provide for their own\r\nsafety and future influence by being present at the meeting of the\r\nStates. The paltry convoy of Francis from Orleans to the royal vaults of\r\nSt. Denis presented so unfavorable a contrast to the pompous ceremonial\r\nof his father's interment, that it was wittily said, \"that the mortal\r\nenemy of the Huguenots had not been able to escape being himself buried\r\nlike a Huguenot.\"[973] A bitter taunt aimed at the unfaithfulness and\r\ningratitude of the Guises fell under their own eyes. A slip of paper was\r\nfound pinned to the velvet funereal pall, on which were written--with\r\nallusion to that famous chamberlain of Charles the Seventh, who, seeing\r\nhis master's body abandoned by the courtiers that had flocked to do\r\nobeisance to his son and successor, himself buried it with great pomp\r\nand at his own expense--the words: \"Where is Messire Tanneguy du\r\nChastel? _But he was a Frenchman!_\"[974]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navarre's opportunity.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His contemptible character.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adroitness and success of Catharine.]\r\n\r\nNever had prince of the blood a finer opportunity for maintaining the\r\nright, while asserting his own just claims, than fell to the lot of\r\nAntoine of Navarre. The sceptre had passed from the grasp of a youth of\r\nuncertain majority to that of a boy who was incontestably a minor.\r\nCharles, the second son of Henry the Second, who now succeeded his older\r\nbrother, was only ten years of age. It was beyond dispute that the\r\nregency belonged to Antoine as the first prince of the blood. Every\r\nsentiment of self-respect dictated that he should assume the high rank\r\nto which his birth entitled him,[975] and that, while exercising the\r\npower with which it was associated, in restraining or punishing the\r\ncommon enemies both of the public liberties and of the family of the\r\nBourbons, he should protect the Huguenots, who looked up to him as their\r\nnatural defender. But the King of Navarre had, unfortunately, entered\r\ninto the humiliating compact with the queen mother, to which reference\r\nwas made in the last chapter. From this agreement he now showed no\r\ndisposition to withdraw. The utopian vision of a kingdom of Navarre,\r\nonce more restored to its former dimensions, still flitted before his\r\neyes, and he preferred the absolute sovereignty of this contracted\r\nterritory to the influential but dangerous regency which his friends\r\nurged him to seize. Besides, he was sluggish, changeable, and altogether\r\nuntrustworthy. \"He is an exceedingly weak person\"--_suggetto\r\ndebolissimo_--said Suriano. \"As to his judgment, I shall not stop to say\r\nthat he wears rings on his fingers and pendants in his ears like a\r\nwoman, although he has a gray beard and bears the burden of many years;\r\nand that in great matters he listens to the counsels of flatterers and\r\nvain men, of whom he has a thousand about him.\"[976] Liberal in\r\npromises, and exhibiting occasional sparks of courage, the fire of\r\nAntoine's resolution soon died out, and he earned the reputation of\r\nbeing no more formidable than the most treacherous of advocates.\r\nSensual indulgence had sapped the very foundations of his\r\ncharacter.[977] It is true that his friends, forgetting the\r\ndisappointment engendered by his recent displays of timidity, reminded\r\nhim again of the engagements into which he had entered, to interfere in\r\ndefence of the oppressed, of his glorious opportunity, and of his\r\naccountability before the Divine Tribunal.[978] But their appeals\r\naccomplished little. Catharine was able to boast, in a letter to the\r\nFrench Ambassador at Madrid, just a fortnight after the death of\r\nFrancis, that \"she had great reason to be pleased\" with Navarre's\r\nconduct, for \"he had placed himself altogether in her hands, and had\r\ndespoiled himself of all power and authority.\" \"I dispose of him,\" she\r\nsaid, \"just as I please.\"[979] And to her daughter, Queen Isabella of\r\nSpain, she wrote by the same courier: \"He is so obedient; he has no\r\nauthority save that which I permit him to exercise.\"[980] The\r\napprehensions felt by Philip the Second regarding the exaltation of a\r\nheretic, in the person of his hated neighbor of Navarre, to the first\r\nplace in the vicinage of the French throne, might well be quieted after\r\nsuch reassuring intelligence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial embarrassment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The religions situation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catharine's neutrality.]\r\n\r\nYet the position of Catharine, it must be admitted, was by no means an\r\neasy one. The ablest statesman might have shrunk from coping with the\r\nfinancial difficulties that beset her. The crown was almost hopelessly\r\ninvolved. Henry the Second had in the course of a dozen years\r\naccumulated, by prodigal gifts and by needless wars, a debt--enormous\r\nfor that age--of forty-two millions of francs, besides alienating the\r\ncrown lands and raising by taxation a larger sum of money than had been\r\ncollected in eighty years previous.[981] The Venetian Michele summed up\r\nthe perplexities of the political situation under two questions: How to\r\nrelieve the people, now thoroughly exhausted;[982] and, how to rescue\r\nthe crown from its poverty. But, in reality, the financial embarrassment\r\nwas the least of the difficulties of the position Catharine had assumed.\r\nThe kingdom was rent with dissensions. Two religions were\r\nstruggling--the one for exclusive supremacy, the other at least for\r\ntoleration and recognition. Catharine had no strong religious\r\nconvictions to actuate her in deciding which of the two she should\r\nembrace. Two powerful political parties were contending for the\r\nascendency--that of the princes of the blood and of constitutional\r\nusage, and that of an ambitious family newly introduced into the\r\nkingdom, but a family which had succeeded in attaching to itself most,\r\nif not all, of the favorites of preceding kings. Catharine's ambition,\r\nin the absence of any convictions of right, regarded the success of\r\neither as detrimental to her own authority. She had, therefore, resolved\r\nto play off the one against the other, in the hope of being able,\r\nthrough their mutual antagonism, to become the mistress of both. Under\r\nthe reign of Francis the Second she had gained some notion of the\r\nhumiliation to which the Guises, in their moment of fancied security,\r\nwould willingly have reduced her. Yet, after all, the illegal usurpation\r\nof the Guises, who might, from their past experience, be more tolerant\r\nof her ambitious designs, was less formidable to her than the claims of\r\nthe Bourbon princes, based as were these claims upon ancestral usage and\r\nright, and equally fatal to her pretensions and to those of their\r\nrivals. It was a situation of appalling difficulty for a woman sustained\r\nin her course by no lofty consciousness of integrity and devotion to\r\nduty--for a woman who was by nature timid, and by education inclined to\r\nresort for guidance to judicial astrology or magic rather than to\r\nreligion.[983]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opening of the States General, Dec. 13, 1560.]\r\n\r\nA brief delay in the opening of the sessions of the States General was\r\nnecessitated by the sudden change in the administration. At length, on\r\nthe thirteenth of December, the pompous ceremonial took place in the\r\ncity of Orleans. It was graced by the presence of the boy-king, Charles\r\nthe Ninth, and of his mother, his brother, the future Henry the Third,\r\nand his sister Margaret. The King of Navarre, the aged Renée of Ferrara,\r\nand other members of the royal house, also figured here with all that\r\nwas most distinguished among the nobility of the realm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Address of Chancellor De l'Hospital.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Co-existence of two religions impossible.]\r\n\r\nTo the chancellor was, as usual, entrusted the honorable and\r\nresponsible duty of laying before the representatives of the three\r\norders the reasons of their present convocation. This office he\r\ndischarged in a long and learned harangue. If the hearers were treated\r\nwithout stint to that profusion of ancient learning, upon which the\r\norators of the age seem to have rested a great part of their claim to\r\npatient attention, they also listened to much that was of more immediate\r\nconcern to them, respecting the origin of the States General, and the\r\noccasions for which they had from time to time been summoned by former\r\nkings. L'Hospital announced that the special object of the present\r\nmeeting was to devise the means of allaying the seditions which had\r\narisen in consequence of religious differences. \"These,\" said\r\nL'Hospital, \"are the causes of the most serious dissensions. It is folly\r\nto hope for peace, rest, and friendship between persons of opposite\r\ncreeds. A Frenchman and an Englishman holding a common faith will\r\nentertain stronger affection for each other than two citizens of the\r\nsame city who disagree about their theological tenets.\"[984] So powerful\r\nwas still the prejudice of the age with one who was among the first to\r\ncatch a glimpse of the true principles of religious toleration! That two\r\ndiscordant religions should permanently co-exist in a state, he agreed\r\nwith most of his contemporaries in regarding as utterly impossible. For\r\nhow could the adherents of the papacy and the disciples of the new faith\r\nconceal their differences under the cloak of a common charity and mutual\r\nforbearance?[985]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Names of factions must be abolished.]\r\n\r\nYet the dawn of more enlightened principles could be detected in a\r\nsubsequent part of the chancellor's speech. After prescribing a\r\nuniversal council--that panacea which all the state doctors of the day\r\noffered for the cure of the ills of the body politic--he advocated the\r\nemployment, meantime, of persuasion instead of force, of gentleness\r\nrather than rigor, of charity and good works, as more effective than the\r\nmost trenchant of material weapons. And, while he recommended his\r\nhearers to pray for the conversion of the erring, he exclaimed: \"Let us\r\nremove those diabolical words, names of parties, factions, and\r\nseditions--'Lutherans,' 'Huguenots,' and 'Papists'--and let us retain\r\nonly the name of 'Christians.'\"[986] In concluding his address, he did\r\nnot forget to dwell upon the lamentable condition of the royal finances,\r\nthrown into almost inextricable confusion by twelve or thirteen years of\r\ncontinuous war and the expenses attending three magnificent weddings. He\r\nbegged the estates, while they exposed their grievances, not to fail to\r\nprovide the king with means for meeting his obligations.[987]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effrontery of Cardinal Lorraine.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De Rochefort orator for the noblesse.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: L'Ange for the tiers état.]\r\n\r\nIt now devolved upon the deputies to prepare a statement of their\r\ngrievances, and for this purpose the \"noblesse\" retired to the\r\nDominican, the clergy to the Franciscan, and the \"tiers\" to the\r\nCarmelite convents.[988] The Cardinal of Lorraine had had the effrontery\r\nto solicit, through his creatures, the honor of representing the three\r\norders collectively; but the proposition had been rejected with\r\nundissembled derision. Loud voices were heard from among the deputies of\r\nthe people, crying, \"We do not choose to select _him_ to speak for us of\r\nwhom we intend to offer our complaints!\"[989] Three orators were deputed\r\nto speak for the three orders.[990] The Sieur de Rochefort, in behalf of\r\nthe nobles, declared their approval of the government of Catharine, but\r\ninsisted at some length upon the necessity of conciliating their good\r\nwill by a studious regard for their privileges. He likened the king to\r\nthe sun and the \"noblesse\" to the moon. Any conflict between the two\r\nwould produce an eclipse that would darken the entire earth. He\r\ndenounced the chicanery of the ecclesiastical courts and the\r\nnon-residence of the priests;[991] and he closed by presenting a\r\npetition, which was read aloud by one of the secretaries of state,\r\ndemanding the grant of churches for the use of those nobles who\r\npreferred the purer worship.[992] The Bordalese lawyer, Jean L'Ange, in\r\nthe name of the people, dwelt chiefly on the three capital vices of the\r\nclergy--ignorance, avarice, and luxury,[993] and portrayed very\r\neffectively the general disorders, the intolerable tyranny of the\r\nGuises, the exhausted state of the public treasury, and the means of\r\nrestoring the Church to purity of faith and regularity of discipline.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrogant speech of Quintin for the clergy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Presumption in favor of the Catholic Church.]\r\n\r\nBut it was the clerical delegate, Jean Quintin, that attracted most\r\nattention. Standing between the other two orators, he delivered a speech\r\nof great length and insufferable arrogance. He admitted that the clergy\r\nmight need reformation; but the Church with its hierarchy must not be\r\ntouched--that was the body of Christ. Charles must defend the Church\r\nagainst heresy--against that Gospel falsely and maliciously so called,\r\nwhich consisted in profaning churches, in breaking the sacred images, in\r\nthe marriage of priests and nuns. He must not suffer the Reformation to\r\naffect the articles of faith, the sacraments, traditions, ordinances, or\r\nceremonial. Should any one venture to resuscitate heresies long dead and\r\nburied, he begged the king to declare him a champion of heresy and to\r\nproceed against him. He insisted on the presumption in favor of the\r\nCatholic Church, and demanded the unconditional submission of its\r\nopponents. \"They must believe us, without waiting for a council; not we\r\nthem.\" He was warm in his praise of the Emperors Theodosius II. and\r\nValentinian III., who confiscated the goods of heretics, banished them,\r\nand deprived them of the right of conveying or receiving property by\r\nwill. He raised his voice particularly in behalf of Burgundy and of his\r\nown diocese of Autun, whose inhabitants \"were well-nigh drowned by the\r\nmuch too frequent inundations of pestilent books from the infected\r\nlagoons of Geneva.\"[994]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporal interests.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sad straits of the clergy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A word for the down-trodden people.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this tirade against the inroads of Calvinism, the\r\nprudent doctor of canon law did not, however, altogether lose sight of\r\nthe temporal concerns of the priesthood. He proffered an urgent request\r\nfor the restoration of canonical elections, laying the growth of heresy\r\naltogether to the account of the abrogation of the Pragmatic Sanction by\r\nthe Concordat in 1517. The sanction being re-established, \"the\r\ndetestable and damnable sects, the execrable and accursed heresies of\r\nto-day\" would incontinently flee from the church. If he painted the\r\nportrait of the prelate elected by the suffrages of his diocese in\r\nsomewhat too nattering colors, he certainly gave a vivid picture of the\r\nsad straits to which the clergy were reduced by the imposition of the\r\nrepeated tithes on their revenues, now become customary. Masses were\r\nunsaid, churches had been stripped of their ornaments. Missals and\r\nchalices even had, in some places, been sold at auction to meet the\r\nexorbitant demands of royal officers. It was to be feared that, if\r\nChristian kings continued to lay sacerdotal possessions under\r\ncontribution, the Queen of the South would rise up in judgment with this\r\ngeneration, and would condemn it. Lest, however, this commination should\r\nnot prove terrible enough, the examples of Belshazzar and others were\r\njudiciously subjoined. On the other hand, Charles was urged to acquire a\r\nglory superior to that of Charlemagne, and to earn the surname of\r\n_Clerophilus_, or _Maximus_, by freeing the clergy of its burdens. By a\r\nvery remarkable condescension, after this lofty flight of eloquence, the\r\nclerical advocate deigned to utter a short sentence or two in the\r\ninterest of the \"noblesse,\" and even of the poor, down-trodden\r\npeople--begging the king to lighten the burdens which that so good, so\r\nobedient people had long borne patiently, and not to suffer this third\r\nfoot of the throne to be crushed or broken.[995] When the crown had\r\nreturned to this course of just action, the Church would pray very\r\ndevoutly in its behalf, the nobility fight valiantly, _the people obey\r\nhumbly_. It would be paradise begun on earth.[996]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The clergy alone makes no progress.]\r\n\r\nThus spoke the chosen delegates of the three orders when summoned into\r\nthe royal presence for the first time after the lapse of seventy-seven\r\nyears. The nobility and clergy vied with each other in extolling their\r\nown order; the people made little pretension, but had a large budget of\r\ngrievances demanding redress. Nearly forty years had the Reformation\r\nbeen gaining ground surely and steadily. It had found, at last,\r\nrecognition more or less explicit in the noblesse and the \"tiers état.\"\r\nBut the clergy had made no progress, had learned nothing. The speech of\r\nQuintin, their chosen representative, on this critical occasion, was\r\nlong and tiresome; but, instead of convincing, it only excited shame and\r\ndisgust.[997]\r\n\r\nIndeed, an allusion of his to the favorers of heresy daring to present\r\npetitions in behalf of the Huguenots, who demanded places in which to\r\nworship God, was taken by Admiral Coligny as a personal insult to\r\nhimself, for which Quintin was compelled to make a public apology.[998]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coligny presents a Huguenot petition.]\r\n\r\nThe incredible supineness of Antoine of Navarre prevented the States\r\nfrom demanding with much decision that the regency should be entrusted\r\nin the hands of him to whom it belonged of right. For how could\r\nenthusiasm be manifested in a matter regarding which the person chiefly\r\ninterested showed such utter indifference? But the religious demands of\r\nthe Huguenots were made distinctly known. As expressed in a petition\r\npresented in their name to the queen mother by the Admiral's hands,\r\nthese demands were comprehended under three heads: the convocation of a\r\nfree universal council, which should decide definitely respecting the\r\nreligious questions in dispute; the immediate liberation of all\r\nprisoners whose only crime was of a religious character--even if\r\ndisguised under the false accusation of sedition; and liberty of\r\nassembling for the purpose of listening to the preaching of God's word,\r\nand for the administration of the sacraments, under such conditions as\r\nthe royal council might deem necessary for the prevention of\r\ndisorder.[999] So gracious was Catharine's answer, so brilliant were the\r\nsigns of promise, that there were those who hoped soon to behold in\r\nFrance a king \"very Christian\" in fact no less than in name.[1000]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The estates prorogued.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meanwhile prosecutions for religion to cease.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no easy matter to grant these reasonable requests. The\r\nRoman Catholic party resisted, with all the energy of desperation, the\r\nconcession of any places for worship according to the reformed faith.\r\nCatharine was loth to take the decided step of disregarding their\r\nremonstrances. It seemed more convenient to avail herself of the\r\nrepresentations of the majority of the delegates of the \"tiers état,\"\r\nwho regarded it as necessary to apply for new powers from their\r\nconstituents, in consequence of the death of the monarch who had\r\nsummoned them. The estates were accordingly prorogued to meet again at\r\nPontoise on the first of May.[1001] The matter of the \"temples\" was\r\nadjourned until that time. Meanwhile, in order to conciliate the\r\nHuguenots, orders were issued that all prosecutions for religious\r\noffences should surcease, and that the prisoners should at once be\r\nliberated, with the injunction to live in a Catholic fashion for the\r\nfuture.[1002] This concession, poor as it was, met with opposition on\r\nthe part of the Parisian parliament, and was only registered--after more\r\nthan a month's refusal--because of the king's express desire.[1003] But\r\nit was far from satisfying the Protestants; for, in answer to their very\r\nfirst demand, they were referred to the Council of Trent, which the\r\npontiff had recently ordered to reassemble at the coming Easter. Such a\r\nconvocation--neither convened in a place of safe access, nor consisting\r\nof the proper persons to represent Christendom, nor under free\r\nconditions[1004]--could not be recognized by the Huguenots of France as\r\na competent tribunal to act in the final adjudication of their cause.\r\nThey must refuse to appear either at Trent or at the assembly of French\r\nprelates, to be held as a preliminary to their proceeding to the\r\nuniversal council, in accordance with the resolutions of the notables at\r\nFontainebleau.[1005]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of the fugitives.]\r\n\r\nYet, as contrasted with the earlier legislation, the provisional\r\ndispositions of the royal letter were highly encouraging. They permitted\r\na large number of persons incarcerated for religion's sake to issue from\r\nprison. The exiles, it was said, returned tenfold as numerous as they\r\nleft the country. Great was the indignation of their adversaries when\r\nall these, with numbers recruited from the ranks of the reformers in\r\nEngland, Flanders, Switzerland, and even from Lucca, Florence and\r\nVenice, began to preach with the utmost boldness. They might be accused\r\nof gross ignorance, and of uttering a thousand stupid remarks, but one\r\nthing could not be denied--every preacher had a crowd to hear him.[1006]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles writes to stop ministers from Geneva.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reply of the Genevese.]\r\n\r\nNo such toleration, however, as that now proclaimed was necessary to\r\ninduce the ministers of the reformed doctrines, who had qualified\r\nthemselves for their apostolic labors under the teaching of Calvin and\r\nBeza, to enter France. The gibbet and the fearful \"estrapade\" had not\r\ndeterred them. The prelates, therefore, induced the queen mother to\r\nattempt by other means to stem the flood of preachers that poured in\r\nfrom Geneva. On the twenty-third of January, seven or eight days before\r\nthe adjournment of the States General, a letter was despatched in the\r\nname of Charles IX. to the syndics and councils of the city of Geneva.\r\nIts tone was earnest and decided. It had appeared--so the king was made\r\nto say--from a very careful examination into the sources of the existing\r\ndivisions, that they were caused by the seditious teachings of preachers\r\nmostly sent by the Genevese authorities, or by their principal\r\nministers, as well as by an infinite number of defamatory pamphlets,\r\nwhich these preachers had disseminated far and wide throughout the\r\nkingdom. To them were directly traceable the recent commotions. He\r\ntherefore called on the magistracy to recall these sowers of discord,\r\nand threatened in no doubtful terms to take vengeance on the city should\r\nthe same course be continued after the receipt of the present\r\nwarning.[1007] Never was accusation more unjust, never was unjust\r\naccusation answered more promptly and with truer dignity. On the very\r\nday of the receipt of the king's letter (the twenty-eighth of January)\r\nthe magistrates deliberated with the ministers, and despatched, by the\r\nmessenger who had brought it, a respectful reply written by Calvin\r\nhimself. So far, they said, from countenancing any attempts to disturb\r\nthe quiet of the French monarchy, it would be found that they had passed\r\nstringent regulations to prevent the departure of any that might intend\r\nto create seditious uprisings. They had themselves sent no preachers\r\ninto France, nor had their ministers done more than fulfil a clear\r\ndictate of piety, in recommending, from time to time, such as they found\r\ncompetent, to labor, wherever they might find it practicable, for the\r\nspread of the Gospel, \"seeing that it is the sovereign duty of all kings\r\nand princes to do homage to Him who has given them rule.\" As for\r\nthemselves, they had condemned a resort to arms, and had never\r\ncounselled the seizure of churches, or other unauthorized acts.[1008]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condé cleared and reconciled to Guise.]\r\n\r\nAt no time since the death of the late king had the reversal of the\r\nsentence against Condé been doubtful. The time had now arrived for his\r\ncomplete restoration to favor. The first step was taken in the privy\r\ncouncil, where, on the thirteenth of March, the chancellor declared that\r\nhe knew of no informations made against him. Whereupon the prince was\r\nproclaimed, by the unanimous voice of the council, sufficiently cleared\r\nof all the charges raised by his enemies. The Bourbon, who had refused,\r\nuntil his honor should be fully satisfied, to enjoy the liberty which he\r\nmight easily have obtained, had been invited by Charles to the court,\r\nwhich was sojourning at Fontainebleau, and now resumed his seat in the\r\ncouncil.[1009] Just three months later (on Friday, the thirteenth of\r\nJune) the Parliament of Paris, after a prolonged examination, in which\r\nall the forms of law were observed with punctilious exactness, gave its\r\nsolemn attestation of the innocence of Louis of Condé, of Madame de\r\nRoye, his mother-in-law, and of the others who had so narrowly escaped\r\nbeing plunged with him in a common destruction.[1010] Such declarations\r\nmight be supposed to savor indifferently well of hypocrisy. They were,\r\nhowever, outdone in the final scene of this pompous farce, enacted about\r\ntwo months later in one of the halls of the castle of St. Germain. On\r\nthe twenty-fourth of August a stately assembly gathered in the king's\r\npresence. Catharine, the princes of the blood, five cardinals, and a\r\ngoodly number of dukes and counts, were present; for Louis of\r\nBourbon-Vendôme, Prince of Condé, and Francis of Guise were to be\r\npublicly reconciled to each other. Charles first announced the object\r\nfor which he had summoned this assemblage, and called upon the Duke of\r\nGuise to express his sentiments. \"Sir,\" said the latter, addressing\r\nCondé, \"I neither have, nor would I desire to have, advanced anything\r\nagainst your honor; nor have I been the author or the instigator of your\r\nimprisonment!\" To which Condé replied: \"Sir, I hold to be bad and\r\nmiserable him or those who have been its causes.\" Nothing abashed, Guise\r\nmade the rejoinder: \"I believe that it is so; that concerns me in no\r\nrespect.\" After this gratifying exhibition of convenient memory, if not\r\nof Christian forgiveness, the prince and duke, at the king's request,\r\nembraced each other; and the auditory, highly edified, broke up.[1011]\r\nIt was fitting that this hollow reconciliation should take place on the\r\nvery day upon which, eleven years later, a more treacherous compact was\r\nto bear fruit fatal to thousands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Humiliation of Navarre.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The boldness of the Particular Estates of Paris,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: secures Antoine more consideration.]\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to anticipate the events of subsequent months, in\r\norder to give the sequel of the singular procedure. We must now return\r\nto the spring of this eventful year. It was not long after the\r\nadjournment of the States General before the King of Navarre began to\r\nperceive some results of his humiliating agreement with Catharine de'\r\nMedici. The Guises were received by her with greater demonstrations of\r\nfavor than were the princes of the blood. The keys of the castle were\r\neven intrusted to the custody of Francis, on the pretext that he was\r\nentitled to this privilege as grand master of the palace. In vain did\r\nAntoine remonstrate against this insulting preference, and threaten to\r\nleave the court if his rival remained. Catharine found means to detain\r\nConstable Montmorency, who had intended to leave court in company with\r\nNavarre, and the latter was compelled to suppress his disgust. But the\r\ndeliberations of the Particular Estates of Paris, held soon after, had\r\nmore weight in securing for Navarre a portion of the consideration to\r\nwhich he was entitled. Disregarding the prohibition to touch upon\r\npolitical matters, they boldly discussed the necessity of an account of\r\nthe vast sums of money that had passed through the hands of the Guises,\r\nand of the restitution of the inordinate gifts which the cardinal and\r\nhis brother, Diana of Poitiers, the Marshal of St. André, and even the\r\nconstable, had obtained from the weakness of preceding monarchs. This\r\nboldness disturbed Catharine. She employed the constable to mediate for\r\nher with Antoine; and soon a new compact was framed, securing to the\r\nlatter more explicit recognition as lieutenant-general, and a more\r\npositive influence in the affairs of state.[1012]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His assurances to the Ambassador of Denmark.]\r\n\r\nThat influence he occasionally seemed anxious to exert in behalf of the\r\nreformed faith. He assured Gluck, the Danish ambassador, that, before\r\nthe expiration of the year, he would cause the Gospel to be preached\r\nthroughout the entire kingdom. And he displayed some magnanimity when he\r\nanswered Gluck, who had expressed anxiety that Lutheranism should be\r\nsubstituted for Calvinism in France, that \"inasmuch as the two\r\nProtestant communions agreed in thirty-eight of the forty articles in\r\nwhich both differed from the Pope, all Protestants ought to make common\r\ncause against the oppression of the Roman See; it would afterward be an\r\neasy task to arrange their minor differences, and restore the Church to\r\nits pristine purity and splendor.\"[1013]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intrigue of Artus Désiré.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Curiosity to hear Huguenot preaching and singing.]\r\n\r\nSo wonderful an awakening as that which was now witnessed in almost\r\nevery part of France could not long continue without arousing violent\r\nresistance. The very signs that seemed to indicate the speedy triumph of\r\nthe Reformation were, indeed, the occasion of the institution of an\r\norganized opposition of the most formidable character. Hints of the\r\npropriety of calling in foreign assistance had even before this time\r\nbeen audibly whispered. The theologians of the Sorbonne, alarmed at the\r\napparent favor displayed for the reformed teachers by the court, had\r\ndespatched one Artus Désiré with a letter to Philip the Second, in\r\nwhich they supplicated his intervention in behalf of the Catholic\r\nreligion, now threatened with ruin. Happily the enterprise was nipped in\r\nthe bud, and, on the arrest of Artus at Orleans, on his way to Spain,\r\nthe nefarious conspiracy was fully divulged. The priestly agent, after\r\ncraven prayers for his life, was immured for a time in a cloister.[1014]\r\nWell might the Romish party fear. The curiosity to hear the preaching of\r\nthe Word of God by men of piety and learning, the desire to hear those\r\ngrand psalms of Marot solemnly chanted by the chorus of thousands of\r\nhuman voices, had infected every class of society. The records of the\r\nchapters of cathedrals, during this period of universal spiritual\r\nagitation, are little else, we are told, than a list of cases of\r\necclesiastical discipline instituted against chaplains, canons, and even\r\nhigher dignitaries, for having attended the Huguenot services. At Rouen,\r\nthe chief singer of Notre Dame acknowledged before the united chapter\r\nthat he had often been present at the \"assemblies\"--nay, more--\"that he\r\nhad never heard anything there which was not good.\"[1015]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constable Montmorency's disgust.]\r\n\r\nIn the court at Fontainebleau the contagion daily spread. Beza, it is\r\ntrue, gave expression to the warning that \"not to be a Papist and to be\r\na Christian were different things.\"[1016] But of external marks of an\r\naltered condition of things there was no lack. Little account was taken\r\nof the arrival of Lent. Meat was openly sold and eaten.[1017] Huguenot\r\npreachers conducted their services publicly in the apartments of the\r\nPrince of Condé and of Admiral Coligny, first outside of the castle, and\r\nthen within its precincts. Catharine herself, partaking of the general\r\nzeal, declared her intention to hear the Bishop of Valence preach before\r\nthe young king and the court, in the saloon of the castle. Such was the\r\nnews that irritated and alarmed the aged, but still vigorous Anne of\r\nMontmorency. By birth, by tradition, by long association, the constable\r\nwas a devoted Roman Catholic. If any motive were wanting to determine\r\nhim to cling to the ancient régime, it was afforded by the proposition\r\nmade in the late Particular Estates of Paris that the favorites of the\r\nlast two monarchs should be required to disgorge the enormous gifts that\r\nhad helped to impoverish the nation. This project, for which he held the\r\nHuguenots responsible, was repugnant alike to his pride and to his\r\nexorbitant avarice. His prejudices were, moreover, skilfully fanned into\r\na flame by interested companions. His wife, Madeleine de Savoie--partly\r\nfrom conviction, partly through jealousy of his children by a former\r\nmarriage--her brother, the Count of Villars,[1018] and the Marshal of\r\nSt. André--a crafty, insidious adviser--plied him with plausible\r\narguments. Diana, the Duchess of Valentinois, solicited him by daily\r\nmessages. How could the first Christian baron abandon the ancient faith?\r\nHow could the favorite of Henry the Second consent to let his rich\r\nacquisitions escape him?[1019]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marshal Montmorency remonstrates.]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the constable was himself induced to attend the service\r\nin the castle at which Bishop Montluc preached; but he came out highly\r\ndispleased at the doctrines he had heard,[1020] and more convinced than\r\never that there was a secret compact between Catharine de' Medici and\r\nthe King of Navarre to change the religion of the country. The next day\r\na number of high nobles, in part ancient enemies--Montmorency, Guise,\r\nMontpensier, St. André--met in the obscure chapel of the \"basse-court,\"\r\nwhere a Dominican monk held forth to the common retainers of the royal\r\ncourt. The constable's eldest son, the upright but sluggish Marshal de\r\nMontmorency, himself having a secret leaning for the reformed doctrines,\r\nwas alarmed by this threatening demonstration, and immediately sought,\r\nin a private interview with his father, to deter him from entering the\r\narena as the ally of his former antagonists and the opponent of his own\r\nnephews, Coligny and D'Andelot. Better, he urged, to be umpire than\r\nparticipant in so ungrateful a contest. The Châtillons, of whom Anne had\r\nsaid that, if they were as good Christians in deed as they were in\r\nprofession, they would exercise forgiveness toward the Guises,\r\nthemselves came to see their offended uncle, and protested that they\r\nwished the cardinal and his brothers no evil, but desired merely to\r\nremove their ability to do them further damage. Neither his son nor his\r\nnephews made any impression on the obstinate disposition of the\r\nconstable. He had caught at the bait by which skilful anglers allured\r\nhim. He fancied himself the chosen champion of the church of his\r\nfathers, now assaulted by redoubtable enemies. What a glorious prospect\r\nlay before him if he succeeded! What a halo would surround his name, if\r\nthe splendor of the military achievements of his youth should be thrown\r\ninto the shade by the superior glory of having, in his old age, rescued\r\nthe most Christian nation of the world from the inroads of heresy! To\r\nevery argument he could only be brought to repeat the trite sophism,\r\n\"that a change of religion could not be effected without a revolution in\r\nthe state,\" and that, though he had no fear of being compelled to\r\nrestore the gifts he had received from the late monarchs, he would not\r\nsuffer their actions to be questioned or their honor impeached.[1021]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Triumvirate formed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A spurious statement.]\r\n\r\nOn Easter day (the sixth of April), the finishing stroke was given to\r\nthe new compact between the leaders of the anti-reformed party. Anne de\r\nMontmorency and François de Guise partook side by side of the sacrament\r\nin the chapel of Fontainebleau, and that evening Guise, Joinville, and\r\nSt. André were invited guests at the table of the constable.[1022] To\r\nthe union now distinctly formed, its opponents, in allusion to the\r\nnumber of the foremost members and to their proscriptive designs, soon\r\napplied the name of \"Triumvirate\"--the designation by which it has ever\r\nsince been known. What the details of these designs were is not\r\naltogether certain. If the document that has come down to us, purporting\r\nto be an authoritative statement emanating from the original parties to\r\nthe scheme, could be depended on as genuine, it would disclose to us an\r\natrocious plot, not only against the Huguenots of France, but for the\r\nextirpation of Protestantism throughout the world. The sanguinary\r\nproject was to be executed under the superintendence of his Catholic\r\nMajesty of Spain. The King of Navarre, the support of heresy in France,\r\nwas first to be seduced by promises or terrified by threats. Should\r\nneither course prove successful, Philip was to raise an army in the most\r\nsecret manner before winter. Should Antoine yield at once, he was to be\r\nexpelled from the kingdom, with his wife and children. Should he attempt\r\nresistance, the Duke of Guise would declare himself the head of the\r\nCatholics, and, between him and Philip, the heretical King of Navarre\r\nwould speedily be crushed. Then were all that had ever professed the\r\nreformed faith to be slain. Not one was to be spared. The entire race\r\nof the Bourbons was to be exterminated, lest an avenger or a\r\nresuscitator of Protestantism should arise from its descendants. The\r\nemperor and the Catholic princes of Germany would prevent the\r\nProtestants beyond the Rhine from sending succor to their French\r\nbrethren. The Roman Catholic cantons of Switzerland, with the assistance\r\nof the Pope, would engage the Protestant cantons. To the Duke of Savoy,\r\nsupported by Philip and the Italian dukes, was intrusted the welcome\r\ntask of destroying utterly the nest of heresy--Geneva. Here should the\r\nexecutioner revel in the blood of his victims. Not an inhabitant was to\r\nescape. All, without respect to age or sex, were to be slain with the\r\nsword or drowned in the lake, as an evidence that divine retribution had\r\ncompensated for the delay by the severity of the punishment, causing the\r\nchildren to bear, as an example memorable to all time, the penalty of\r\nthe wickedness of their fathers. The fruits of the French confiscations\r\nwould be applied as a loan to the expenses of the crusade in Germany,\r\nwhere the united forces of France, the emperor, and the Catholic princes\r\nwould subjugate the followers of Luther, as they had already\r\nexterminated the disciples of Calvin.\r\n\r\nSuch are the reported details of a plan almost too gross for belief. It\r\nis true that the existence of similar schemes--less extensive, perhaps,\r\nbut equally sanguinary, and, in the light of history, not much less\r\nabsurd--formed by the adherents of the papacy during the sixteenth\r\ncentury, is too well attested to admit of doubt. But the historical\r\ndifficulties surrounding this document have never yet been\r\nsatisfactorily explained, and the student of the Huguenot annals must\r\nstill content himself with regarding it as a summary of reports current\r\nwithin the first two years of the reign of Charles the Ninth, respecting\r\nthe secret designs of the Triumvirs, rather than as an authorized\r\nstatement of their intentions.[1023]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacres in holy week.]\r\n\r\nWhile the intrigues of the Duchess of Valentinois and other bigots had\r\nbeen successful at court, the enemies of the Huguenots had not been\r\nidle in other parts of France. Fearful of the effect which the apparent\r\nunion between Catharine and the King of Navarre might produce in\r\naccelerating the advance of the reformed doctrines, they resolved to\r\nstir up the zeal of the populace--that portion of the people that\r\nretained the strongest devotion for the traditional faith--in the\r\ncountry as well as in the capital.[1024] Holy week furnished\r\nopportunities that were eagerly embraced. Fanatical priests and monks\r\nwrought up the excitable mob to a frenzy.[1025] When their passions had\r\nreached a fervent heat, it was easy to bring on seditious explosions,\r\nthe blame of which could be attached to the other party. \"Few cities in\r\nthe realm,\" says Abbé Bruslart in his journal, \"escaped at this time\r\nriots and tumultuous scenes occasioned by the new religion.\"[1026]\r\nAmiens, Pontoise, and Paris itself were among the scenes of these\r\ndisorders. Twenty cities witnessed the slaughter of Protestants by the\r\ninfuriated rabble.[1027]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The affair at Beauvais.]\r\n\r\nThe disturbance that attracted more attention than any other took place\r\nin the episcopal city of Beauvais--about forty miles north of Paris--on\r\nEaster Monday, the very next day after Montmorency, Guise, and St. André\r\nhad been confirming their inauspicious compact at the sacred feast in\r\nhonor of a risen Redeemer. The Bishop of Beauvais was the celebrated\r\nCardinal Odet de Châtillon, long suspected of being at heart a convert\r\nto the reformed doctrines. More bold than he had formerly been, he now\r\nopenly fostered their spread in his diocese.[1028] But even the personal\r\npopularity of the brother of Coligny and D'Andelot could not, in the\r\npresent instance, secure immunity for the preachers who proclaimed the\r\nGospel under his auspices. Incited by the priesthood, the people\r\noverleaped all the bounds within which they had hitherto contained\r\nthemselves. The occasion was a rumor spread abroad that the Cardinal,\r\ninstead of attending the public celebration of the mass in his cathedral\r\nchurch, had, with his domestics, participated in a private communion in\r\nhis own palace, and that every communicant had, at the hands of the Abbé\r\nBouteiller, received both elements, \"after the fashion of Geneva.\"\r\nHereupon the mob, gathering in great force, assailed a private house in\r\nwhich there lived a priest accused of teaching the children the\r\ndoctrines of religion from the reformed catechisms. The unhappy Adrien\r\nFourré--such was the schoolmaster's name--was killed; and the rabble,\r\nrendered more savage through their first taste of blood, dragged his\r\ncorpse to the public square, where it was burned by the hands of the\r\ncity hangman. Odet himself incurred no little risk of meeting a similar\r\nfate. But the strength of the episcopal palace, and the sight of their\r\nbishop clothed in his cardinal's costume, appeased the mob for the time;\r\nand before the morrow came, a goodly number of the neighboring nobles\r\nhad rallied for his defence.[1029]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault on the house of Longjumeau.]\r\n\r\nIf such riotous attacks followed the preaching of the ecclesiastics in\r\nthe provinces, the demonstrations of hostility to the exercises of the\r\nProtestants could not be of a milder type in the midst of the turbulent\r\npopulace of Paris, and within a stone's throw of the Collége de la\r\nSorbonne. Toward the end of April information was received that the\r\ncity residence of the Sieur de Longjumeau, situated on the _Pré aux\r\nClercs_, was becoming a haunt of the Huguenots. It was not long before\r\nthe rabble, with ranks recruited from the neighboring colleges,\r\ninstituted an assault. But they met with a resistance upon which they\r\nhad not counted. Forewarned of his danger, Longjumeau had gathered\r\nbeneath his roof a number of friendly nobles, and laid in a good supply\r\nof arms. The undisciplined crowd fled before the well-directed fire of\r\nthe defenders, and left several men dead and a larger number wounded on\r\nthe field. Not satisfied with this victory by force of arms, Longjumeau\r\nresorted to parliament. But the court displayed its usual partiality for\r\nthe Roman Catholic faith. While it abstained from justifying the\r\nassailants, and forbade the students from assembling in the\r\nneighborhood, it reiterated the adage that \"there is nothing more\r\nincompatible than the co-existence of two different religions in the\r\nsame state,\"[1030] censured the nobleman's conduct, and ordered him\r\nforthwith to retire to his castle at Longjumeau.[1031]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New and tolerant order.]\r\n\r\nThe only salvation of France lay in putting an end to such alarming\r\nexhibitions of discord, from the frequent recurrence of which it was to\r\nbe feared that the country stood upon the verge of civil war. For this\r\nreason, Catharine de' Medici yielded to the persuasions of Chancellor\r\nL'Hospital, and, on the nineteenth of April, caused a royal letter to be\r\naddressed to all the judges, in which the practice of self-control and\r\ntolerance was enjoined. Insulting expressions based on differences of\r\nreligion were strictly forbidden. The very use of the hateful epithets\r\nof \"Papist\" and \"Huguenot\" was proscribed. Far from offering a reward\r\nfor denunciation, the king proclaimed it criminal to violate the\r\nsanctity of the home for the alleged purpose of ferreting out unlawful\r\nassemblages. He again ordered the release of all imprisoned for\r\nreligion's sake, and extended an invitation to exiles to return to their\r\nhomes, if they would live in a Catholic manner, granting them\r\npermission, if they were otherwise disposed, to sell their property and\r\nleave the kingdom.[1032]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition of the Parliament of Paris.]\r\n\r\nIt would have been not a little surprising if so tolerant an edict, even\r\nthough it did little more than repeat the provisions of the last royal\r\nletters on the same subject (of the twenty-eighth of January), had been\r\naccepted without opposition by the Romish party.[1033] Still more\r\nstrange if parliamentary jealousy had not taken umbrage at the neglect\r\nof immemorial usage, when the letter was sent to the lower courts before\r\nhaving received the honor of a formal registry at the hands of the\r\nParisian judges. It is difficult to say which offence was most resented.\r\nToleration, parliament remonstrated, was a tacit approval of a diversity\r\nof religion--a thing unheard of from Clovis's reign down to the present\r\nday. Kings and emperors--nay, even popes--had fallen into error and\r\nbeen proclaimed heretical or schismatic, but never had such calamity\r\nbefallen a king of France. It were better for Charles to make open\r\nprofession of his intention to live and die in his religion, and to\r\nenforce conformity on the part of his subjects, than to open the door\r\nwide to sedition by tolerating dissent. Better to renew the prohibition\r\nof heretical conventicles, and to reiterate the ancient penalties.\r\nParticularly ill-advised was it that Charles should be made to pronounce\r\nseditious those who applied the names \"Papist\" and \"Huguenot\" to their\r\nopponents, for it seemed to establish side by side two rival sects,\r\nalthough the name of the one was so novel as never to have found a place\r\nin any former missives of the crown.[1034]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular cry for Protestant pastors.]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Parisian parliament to verify the edict in the\r\ncustomary manner prevented its universal observance; but,\r\nnotwithstanding this untoward circumstance, it proved exceedingly\r\nfavorable to the development of the Huguenot movement.[1035] Scarcely a\r\nmonth after its publication, Calvin, in a letter to which we have more\r\nthan once had occasion to refer, expressed his astonishment at the ardor\r\nwith which the French Protestants were pressing forward to still greater\r\nachievements. The cry from all parts of Charles the Ninth's dominions\r\nwas for ministers of the Gospel.[1036] \"The eagerness with which\r\npastors are sought for on all hands from us is not less than that with\r\nwhich sacerdotal offices are wont to be solicited among the papists.\r\nThose who are in quest of them besiege my doors, as if I must be\r\nentreated after the fashion of the court; and vie with each other, as if\r\nthe possession of Christ's kingdom were a quiet one. And, on our part,\r\nwe desire to fulfil their earnest prayers to the extent of our ability;\r\nbut we are thoroughly exhausted; nay, we have for some time been\r\ncompelled to drag from the book-stores every workman that could be found\r\npossessed even of a slight tincture of literature and religious\r\nknowledge.\"[1037]\r\n\r\nThe letters that reached Calvin and his colleagues by every messenger\r\nfrom Southern France--many of which have recently come to light in the\r\nlibraries of Paris and Geneva--present a vivid picture of the condition\r\nof whole districts and provinces. From Milhau comes the intelligence\r\nthat the mass has for some time been banished from the place, but that a\r\nsingle pastor is by no means sufficient; he must have a colleague, that\r\none minister may take exclusive care of the neighboring country, \"where\r\nthere is an infinite number of churches,\" while the other remains in the\r\ncity. Everywhere there is an abundance of hot-headed persons who, by\r\ntheir breaking of crosses and images, and even plundering of churches,\r\ngive the adversary an opportunity for calumniating. \"May the Lord, of\r\nHis goodness, be pleased to purge His church of them!\"[1038]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moderation of the Huguenot ministers.]\r\n\r\nIn these most difficult circumstances--while, on the one hand, the\r\ndemand for ministers was largely in excess of the supply, and, on the\r\nother, the folly of certain inconsiderate enthusiasts seemed likely to\r\ndraw upon the great body of Protestants the unwarranted charge of\r\ndisorder and insubordination to law--the Huguenot ministers fearlessly\r\ntook a position that strikingly exhibits their excellent judgment, as\r\nwell as their high moral principle. They declined to countenance a\r\npolicy which offered, to say the least, bright temporary advantages.\r\nThey refused to trust the vessel freighted with their best hopes for the\r\nfuture of France, to be carried into port on the treacherous waves of\r\npopular excitement. They preferred to abate somewhat of the proper\r\ndemands which they might have exacted with success, that they might\r\ndeprive their enemies of the slightest ground for maligning their\r\nloyalty to their native land and its legitimate king. When the\r\nProtestants of Montauban--a town then beginning to assume a religious\r\ncharacter which it has never since lost--learned that they had been\r\nfalsely accused of having revolted from the king, and of having elected\r\na governor of their own, established a polity similar to that of the\r\nSwiss cantons, and coined money as an independent state, they not only\r\nrefuted the charges to the satisfaction of the royal lieutenant sent to\r\ninvestigate the truth,[1039] but they discontinued the _public_\r\ncelebration of the Lord's Supper, in order to avoid even the appearance\r\nof unwillingness to obey the king's commands. At the same time they\r\nwrote to Geneva an earnest request that, notwithstanding the need of\r\nteachers in France, no persons that had been monks or chaplains should\r\nbe admitted to the ministry unless after long and careful scrutiny. They\r\ndid more harm, they disquieted the churches more, they said, than the\r\nmost violent persecutions that had befallen the Protestants. For they\r\nrefused to submit to discipline, made light of the decisions of their\r\nbrethren, and, while seeking only their own pleasure, drew odium upon\r\nthe ministers who endeavored to uphold good order among the\r\npeople.[1040]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inconsistent laws and practice.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judicial perplexity.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the Huguenots was certainly anomalous, and presented the\r\nstrangest inconsistencies. The royal letters enjoined that no inquiries\r\nshould be made with the view of disturbing any one for religion's sake;\r\nthe Parliament of Paris refused to register these letters and obey the\r\nprovisions; the still more fanatical counsellors of the Parliament of\r\nToulouse rather increased than diminished their severities, and daily\r\nconsigned fresh victims to the flames.[1041] It was natural that the\r\nclergy should take advantage of these circumstances to renew their\r\nremonstrances against the continuance of the existing toleration. The\r\nCardinal of Lorraine seized the opportunity afforded him by the solemn\r\nceremonial of Charles's anointing at Rheims (on the thirteenth of June,\r\n1561) to present to the queen mother the collective complaints of the\r\nprelates, because, so far from witnessing the rigid enforcement of the\r\nroyal edicts, they beheld the heretical conventicles held with more and\r\nmore publicity from day to day, and the judges excusing themselves from\r\nthe performance of their duty by alleging the number of conflicting\r\nlaws, in the midst of which their course was by no means easy. He\r\ntherefore recommended the convocation of the parliament with the princes\r\nand members of the council, that, by their advice, some permanent and\r\nproper settlement of this vexed question might be reached.[1042]\r\nCatharine, who, in the publication of the letters-patent of April, had\r\nfollowed the advice of Chancellor L'Hospital, and seemed to lean to the\r\nside of toleration, now yielded to the cardinal's persuasions--whether\r\nfrom a belief that the mixed assembly which he proposed to convene would\r\npursue the path of conciliation already pointed out by the government,\r\nor from a fear of alienating a powerful party in the state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Mercuriale\" of 1561.]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of June, Charles, accompanied by his mother, by the\r\nKing of Navarre, and the other princes of the blood, and by the council\r\nof state, came to the chamber of parliament, and the chancellor\r\nannounced to the assembled members the object of this extraordinary\r\nvisit. It was to obtain advice not respecting religion itself--_that_\r\nwas reserved for the deliberation of the national council, and its\r\nmerits could not be discussed here--but respecting the best method of\r\nappeasing the commotions daily on the increase, caused by a diversity of\r\nreligious tenets. He therefore begged all present to express in brief\r\nterms their opinions on this important topic. It is not surprising that\r\nthe answers given should have been of the most varied import. Ever since\r\nthe time of Henry the Second, the Parliament of Paris had contained a\r\nconsiderable number of friends, more or less open, of Protestantism, and\r\namong the princes and noblemen who came to join in the deliberation, the\r\nnumber of its warm advocates was proportionately still greater. At the\r\nsame time, the Roman Catholic party was largely represented in the ranks\r\nof the members of the parliament proper, as recent events had indicated;\r\nwhile, among the high nobility and the dignitaries of the church, the\r\nweight of the constable and the Duke of Guise, the cardinals of Bourbon,\r\nTournon, Lorraine, and Guise, and the Bishop of Paris, counterbalanced\r\nthe influence of the King of Navarre, the Prince of Condé, the\r\nChâtillons, and the chancellor. Five or six different opinions were\r\nannounced by the successive speakers;[1043] but they could all be\r\nreduced to three. The more tolerant advocated the suspension of all\r\npunishments until the determination of the questions in dispute by a\r\ncouncil. A second class, on the contrary, maintained the propriety and\r\nexpediency of enforcing the laws which made death the penalty of\r\nheretical belief. The rest--and they mustered in the end a majority of\r\n_three_[1044] over the advocates of toleration, while they were much\r\nmore numerous than the champions of bloody persecution--advised the king\r\nto give to the ecclesiastical courts exclusive cognizance of heresy,\r\naccording to the provisions of the Edict of Romorantin, and to forbid\r\nthe holding of public or private conventicles, whether with or without\r\narms, in which sermons should be preached or the sacraments administered\r\notherwise than according to the customs of the Romish Church.[1045] Such\r\nwas the result of the deliberations of the Mercuriale of June and July,\r\n1561,[1046] in the course of which opinions had been freely expressed\r\nfar more radical than those of Anne Du Bourg in the Mercuriale of 1559.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Edict of July.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disappointment at its severity.]\r\n\r\nThe edict for which the direction had been thus marked out was published\r\non the eleventh of July, 1561.[1047] It has become celebrated in history\r\nas the \"Edict of July.\" After reiterating the injunctions of previous\r\nroyal letters, and forbidding all insults and breaches of the peace, on\r\npain of the halter, Charles was made to prohibit \"all enrollings,\r\nsignatures, or other things tending to sedition.\" Preachers in the\r\nchurches were strictly commanded to abstain from uttering words\r\ncalculated to excite the popular passions or prejudice. The most\r\nimportant portion of the law, however, was that which punished, by\r\nconfiscation of body and goods, all who attended, whether with or\r\nwithout arms, conventicles in which preaching was held or the holy\r\nsacraments administered. Of simple heresy the cognizance was still\r\nrestricted, as by the edict of Romorantin in the previous year, to the\r\nchurch courts; but no higher penalty could be imposed on the guilty,\r\nwhen handed over to the secular arm, than banishment from the kingdom.\r\nThe punishment of all offences in which public disorder or sedition was\r\nmingled with heresy, remained in the hands of the presidial\r\njudges.[1048] These were the leading features of this severe ordinance.\r\nIt is true that the edict was expressly stated to be only\r\nprovisional--to last no longer than until the Universal or National\r\nCouncil, whichever might be held--that pardon was offered to those who\r\nwould live in a Catholic manner for the future, that calumny was\r\nthreatened with exemplary punishment. Yet it was clear that the law was\r\nframed in the interest of the Roman Catholics, and in their interest\r\nalone. The Duke of Guise openly exulted. He exclaimed in the hearing of\r\nmany, \"that his sword would never rest in its scabbard when the\r\nexecution of this decision was in question.\"[1049] The disappointment of\r\nthe Protestants was not less extreme. At court, Admiral Coligny did not\r\nhesitate to declare that its provisions could never be executed.[1050]\r\nThe farther they were removed from St. Germain, the more loudly the\r\nHuguenots murmured, the greater was their indisposition to submit to the\r\nharsh conditions imposed upon them. In Guyenne and Gascony, and in\r\nLanguedoc, where whole towns were to be found containing scarcely one\r\navowed partisan of the papacy, the discontent was open and threatening.\r\nHow long did the bigots of Paris intend to keep their eyes closed and\r\nrefuse to recognize the altered aspect of affairs? Until what future day\r\nwas the simplest of rights--the right of the social and public worship\r\nof God--to be proscribed? Must the inhabitants of entire districts\r\ncontinue, month after month, and year after year, to stand in the eye of\r\nthe law as culprits, with the halter around their necks, and beg mercy\r\nof a despised priesthood and a dissolute court, for the crime of\r\nassembling in the open field, in the school-houses, or even in the\r\nparish churches, where their fathers had worshipped before them, to\r\nlisten to the preaching of God's word?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iconoclasm at Montauban.]\r\n\r\nWith the rising excitement the power of the ministers to control the\r\nardor of their flocks steadily declined. How could the people be\r\nmoderate, or even prudent, when their rights were so thoroughly ignored?\r\nThe events of Montauban during August and the succeeding months, may\r\nserve to illustrate the growing impatience of the laity. Until now, as\r\nwe have seen, the earnest warnings of their pastors had generally been\r\nsuccessful in restraining the Huguenots from touching the symbols of a\r\nhated system so temptingly exhibited before their eyes. But, a few weeks\r\nafter the unofficial intelligence of the enactment of the edict of July\r\nhad reached the city, the work of destruction commenced. On the night of\r\nthe fourteenth of August the Church of St. Jacques received the first\r\nbands of iconoclasts. The pictures and images were torn down or hurled\r\nfrom their niches and destroyed; but the chalices, the silver crosses,\r\nand other precious articles, were left untouched. The object was neither\r\nrobbery nor plunder. A week later, the same fate befel the paintings in\r\nthe church of the Augustinians. After another and a shorter interval,\r\nthe chapels of St. Antoine, St. Michel, St. Roch, St. Barthélemi, and\r\nNotre Dame de Baquet, witnessed similar scenes of destruction. It was at\r\nthis juncture that the edict of July was brought to Montauban and\r\npublicly proclaimed. Nothing could have been more inopportune. The\r\nraging fever of the popular pulse had been mistaken for a transient\r\nexcitement, and the specific now administered, far from quenching the\r\npatient's burning thirst, only stimulated it to a more irrepressible\r\ncraving. That very evening (Tuesday, the twenty-sixth of August), the\r\npeople, irritated beyond endurance, gathered around the Dominican\r\nchurch. The monks, forewarned of their danger, had taken the precaution\r\nto fortify themselves. They now rang the tocsin, but no one came to\r\ntheir rescue, and the stronghold was speedily taken. The assailants,\r\nhowever, cherished no enmity toward God's image in human flesh and\r\nbones. So, after effectually destroying all man's efforts to represent\r\nthe Divine likeness in stone or on canvas, the Huguenots proceeded to\r\nthe Carmelite Church. Here rich trophies awaited them--a \"Saint Suaire\"\r\nand relics, which, on close inspection, were found to be the bones of\r\nhorses instead of belonging to the saintly personages whose names they\r\nhad borne. The reader will scarcely feel surprise to learn that the\r\nmonks--with the single exception of the Franciscans--now judged that the\r\ntime for them to leave the city had arrived.\r\n\r\nInstructed by the somewhat suggestive example of the fate that had\r\nbefallen their brethren, the black and white friars, and, doubtless\r\nconsidering discretion the better part of valor, the priests of the\r\ncollegiate church of St. Stephen abandoned their preparations for\r\ndefence, and, stipulating only for their own safety, gave up their\r\npaintings to be consigned to the flames. A bonfire was kindled on one of\r\nthe public squares; and while the sacred pictures and images thrown upon\r\nit were being slowly consumed, bands of children looked on and chanted\r\nin chorus the metrical paraphrase of the ten commandments. The city\r\nbeing thus cleared of its public objects of superstitious\r\ndevotion,[1051] the people next turned their attention to those of a\r\nmore private character. As the crowds moved along the streets they\r\nearnestly appealed to the inmates of the houses to follow the noble\r\nexample the churches had set them. We are informed by a contemporary\r\nrecord that the iconoclasts carefully abstained from trespassing, and\r\nconfined themselves to an exhibition of those passages of Sacred Writ in\r\nwhich an idolatrous worship was prohibited. But, if the brief\r\nargumentation for which the rapidity of the transaction allowed time was\r\nnot in all cases sufficient to produce entire conviction, it may be\r\npresumed that any remaining scruples were removed by the contagion of\r\nthe popular enthusiasm. Montauban was purged of image-worship as in a\r\nday, and without the injury of man, woman, or child.[1052]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Edict cannot be executed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impatience with \"public idols.\"]\r\n\r\nColigny was right. The Edict of July could not be carried into execution\r\nin those parts of France where, as in Montauban, the mass of the\r\npopulation had openly adopted Protestantism. If the resistance\r\nencountered was often accompanied by an earnestness that disdained to be\r\ntrammelled by the customary forms of civil law, it was almost always\r\nexercised in accordance with the dictates of natural justice. If the\r\npeople, emancipated from the service of images, believed themselves to\r\npossess an indisputable right to dash in pieces or burn the curiously\r\nwrought saints sculptured in marble or portrayed by the painter's\r\npencil, this fact is less wonderful than that they scrupulously spared\r\nthe lives of the priests and monks to whose pecuniary advantage their\r\nformer worship had principally redounded. The plain Huguenot, like the\r\nplain Christian in the primitive age, was fully persuaded that he had an\r\nowner's title in the public idol, which not only justified him in\r\ndestroying it when he had discovered its vanity, but rendered it his\r\nimperative duty to execute the natural impulse. As for the obligation of\r\nnine-tenths of the population to use the idol tenderly, because of any\r\nrightful claim of the remaining tithe, this was a consideration that\r\nscarcely occurred to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin endeavors to repress it.]\r\n\r\nNor were they very solicitous respecting the dangers that might arise\r\nfrom over-precipitancy. Not so with Calvin, from whose closely logical\r\nintellect the influence of a thorough training in the principles of\r\nFrench law had not been obliterated. Never was disapprobation more\r\nclearly expressed than in the reformer's letter to the church of\r\nSauve--a small town in the Cevennes mountains, a score of miles from\r\nNismes--where a Huguenot minister, in his inconsiderate zeal, had taken\r\nan active part in the \"mad exploit\" of burning images and overturning a\r\ncross. This conduct Calvin regarded as the more reprehensible in one\r\n\"whose duty it was to moderate others and hold them in check.\" He denied\r\nthat \"God ever enjoined on any persons to destroy idols, save on every\r\nman in his own house, or in public on those placed in authority,\" and he\r\ndemanded that this \"fire-brand\" should exhibit his title to be lord of\r\nthe territory in which he had undertaken to exercise so distinct a\r\nfunction of royalty. \"In thus speaking,\" he added, \"we are not become\r\nthe advocates of the idols. Would to God that idolatry might be\r\nexterminated, even at the cost of our lives! But since obedience is\r\nbetter than all sacrifice, we must look to what is lawful for us to do,\r\nand must keep within our bounds.\" \"Have pity, very dear brethren,\" he\r\nwrote in conclusion, \"on the poor churches, and do not wittingly expose\r\nthem to butchery. Disavow this act, and openly declare to the people\r\nwhom he has misled, that you have separated yourselves from him who was\r\nits chief author, and that, for his rebellion, you have cut him off from\r\nyour communion.\"[1053] Calvin's advice was that of the whole body of\r\nProtestant divines in France and its neighborhood. Even an idolatrous\r\nworship must not be overturned by violent means.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Re-assembling of the States at Pontoise.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Able harangue of the \"Vierg\" of Autun.]\r\n\r\nThe States General, after having been first summoned to meet at Melun on\r\nthe first of May, and then prorogued, when it was found that some of the\r\nparticular States had introduced the consideration of the public affairs\r\nof the kingdom, instead of devising means for the payment of the royal\r\ndebt,[1054] finally met at Pontoise on the first of August. It does not\r\ncome within the scope of this history to dwell at great length upon the\r\nproceedings of this important political assembly. The States were bold\r\nand decided in tone. It was only after finding that those who had a\r\nclear right to the regency were unwilling to assert it, that they\r\nconsented, in deference to the request of Du Mortier, Admiral Coligny,\r\nand Antoine himself, to ratify the contract between Catharine de' Medici\r\nand the King of Navarre.[1055] Nearly four weeks were spent in the\r\ndiscussion of the subjects that were to be incorporated in the\r\n\"_cahiers_,\" or bills of remonstrance to be presented to the king. It\r\nwas at the solemn reception of the three orders in the great hall of the\r\nneighboring castle of St. Germain-en-Laye,[1056] on the twenty-seventh\r\nof August, that the \"tiers état\" expressed with greatest distinctness\r\nits sentiments respecting the present condition of the realm. Jacques\r\nBretagne, _vierg_[1057] of the city of Autun, a townsman of the clerical\r\norator of the first of January, whose arrogance had inspired such\r\nuniversal disgust, was their spokesman. After reflecting with\r\nconsiderable severity upon the deficiency of the clergy in sound\r\nlearning and spirituality--qualities for which they ought to be\r\npre-eminently distinguished--he took an impressive survey of the\r\nexcessive burdens of the people--burdens by which it had been reduced to\r\nsuch deep poverty as to be altogether unable to do anything to relieve\r\nthe crown until it had obtained time to recruit its exhausted\r\nresources.[1058] He declared it to be utterly inconceivable how such\r\nenormous debts had been incurred, while the purses of the \"third estate\"\r\nhad been drained by unheard-of subsidies. As he had before exhibited the\r\nobligations of the clergy by biblical example, so the orator next\r\nproved, by reference to the Holy Scriptures, that it was the duty of\r\nCharles to cause his subjects to be instructed by the preaching of God's\r\nword, as the surest foundation of his regal authority. Then, approaching\r\nthe vexed question of toleration, he declared that never had monarch\r\nmore reason to study the Word of Life than the youthful King of France\r\namid the growing divisions and discords of his realm. The different\r\nopinions held by Charles's subjects, he said, arose only from their\r\ngreat solicitude for the salvation of their souls. Both parties were\r\nsincere in their profession of faith. Let persecution, therefore, cease.\r\nLet a free national council be convened, under the presidency of the\r\nking in person, and let sure access be given to it. In fine, let places\r\nbe conceded to the advocates of the new doctrines for the worship of\r\nAlmighty God in the open day, and in the presence of royal officers; for\r\nthe voluntary service of the heart, which cannot be constrained, is\r\nalone acceptable to heaven. From such toleration, not sedition, but\r\npublic tranquillity, must necessarily result. And lest the ordinary\r\nallegation of the necessary truth of the Papal Church, on account of its\r\nantiquity, should be employed to corroborate the existing system of\r\npersecution, the deputy of the people reminded the king and court that\r\nthe same argument might be rendered effective in hardening Jews and\r\nTurks in their ancient unbelief. \"We need not busy ourselves in\r\nexamining the length of time, with a view to determining thereby the\r\ntruth or falsity of any religion. _Time is God's creature_, subject to\r\nHimself, in such a manner that ten thousand years are not a minute in\r\nreference to the power of our God!\"[1059]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Written demands of the tiers état.]\r\n\r\nIf the harangue of the orator of the third estate was alarming to the\r\nclergy, its written demands were little calculated to reassure them. For\r\nof several propositions made for the payment of the public debts from\r\nthe ecclesiastical property, none were very satisfactory to the priests.\r\nAccording to one, all benefices were to be laid under contribution. The\r\nholders of the lowest in valuation were to give up one-fourth of their\r\nrevenues; the holders of more valuable benefices a larger proportion;\r\nwhile the high dignitaries of the church were to be limited to a yearly\r\nstipend of six thousand livres for bishops, eight thousand for\r\narchbishops, and twelve thousand for cardinals. But the most obnoxious\r\nscheme was one proposing an innovation of a very radical character. The\r\naggregate revenues of the temporalities of the Gallican Church were\r\nestimated at four million livres; the temporalities themselves were\r\nworth one hundred and twenty millions. It was gravely proposed to\r\ndispose of all this property by sale. Forty-eight millions might be\r\nreserved, which, if invested at the usual rate of one-twelfth, or eight\r\nand a-third per cent., would secure to the clergy the revenue they now\r\nenjoyed. Forty-two millions would be required to pay off the debts of\r\nthe crown. The remaining thirty millions might be deposited with the\r\nchief cities of the kingdom, to be loaned out to foster the development\r\nof commerce; while the moderate interest thus obtained would suffice to\r\nfortify the frontiers and support the soldiery.[1060]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representative government demanded.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional changes proposed by the formal _cahier_ of the third\r\nestate were of an equally radical character. They looked to nothing\r\nshort of a representative government, protected by suitable guarantees,\r\nand a complete religious liberty. On the one hand, the monarch was to\r\nbe guided in the administration by a council of noblemen and learned and\r\nloyal subjects. Except in the case of princes of the blood, no two near\r\nrelatives, as father and son, or two brothers, should sit at the same\r\ntime in the council; while ecclesiastics of every grade were to be\r\nutterly excluded, both because they had taken an oath of fealty to the\r\nPope, and because their very profession demanded a residence in their\r\nrespective dioceses. On the other hand, the States General were to be\r\nconvened at least once in two years, and no offensive war was to be\r\nundertaken, no new impost or tax to be raised, without consulting them.\r\nHappy would it have been for France, had its people obtained, by some\r\nsuch reasonable concessions as these, the inestimable advantage of\r\nregular representation in the government! At the price of a certain\r\namount of political discussion, a bloody revolution might, perhaps, have\r\nbeen avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of religion, the third estate recommended, first of all,\r\nthe absolute cessation of persecution and the repeal of all intolerant\r\nlegislation, even of the edict of July past; grounding the\r\nrecommendation partly on the failure of all the rigorous laws hitherto\r\nenacted to accomplish their design, partly on the greater propriety and\r\nsuitableness of milder measures. And they judiciously added, with a\r\ncharitable discernment so rare in that age as to be almost startling:\r\n\"The diversity of opinions entertained by the king's subjects _proceeds\r\nfrom nothing else than the strong zeal and solicitude they have for the\r\nsalvation of their souls_.\"[1061] Strange that so sensible an\r\nobservation should be immediately followed by a disclaimer of any\r\nintention to ask for pardon for seditious persons, libertines,\r\nanabaptists, and atheists, the enemies of God and of the public peace!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An impartial national council.]\r\n\r\nIt was natural that, in accordance with these views, the third estate\r\nshould call for the convocation of a national council to settle\r\nreligious questions, to be presided over by the king himself, in which\r\nno one having an interest in retarding a reformation should sit, and\r\nwhere the word of God should be the sole guide in the decision of\r\ndoubtful points. Meanwhile, the third estate proposed, that in every\r\ncity a church or other place should be assigned for the worship of those\r\nwho were now forced to hold their meetings by night because of their\r\ninability to join with a good conscience in the ceremonies of the\r\n\"Romish Church\"--for so the document somewhat curtly designated the\r\nestablishment.[1062]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French prelates at Poissy.]\r\n\r\nWhile the States General were occupied at Pontoise in considering the\r\nmeans of relieving the king's pecuniary embarrassments, Catharine had\r\nassembled at Poissy all the bishops of France to take into consideration\r\nthe religious reformation which the times imperatively demanded. The\r\nPope as yet delayed the long-promised oecumenical council, and there\r\nwas little hope of obtaining its actual convocation on fair and\r\npractical terms unless, indeed, he should be frightened into it by the\r\nsuperior terrors of a French national council, which might throw France\r\ninto the arms of the Reformation. Tired of the duplicity of the pontiff,\r\nalarmed by the rapid progress of religious dissensions at home, not\r\nunwilling, perhaps, to make an attempt at reconciliation, which, if\r\nsuccessful, would confirm her own authority and remove the anxieties to\r\nwhich she was daily exposed--now from the side of the Guises, and again\r\nfrom that of the Huguenots--the queen mother had yielded to the\r\nsuggestion frequently made to her, and had consented to a discussion\r\nbetween the French prelates and the most learned Protestant\r\nministers.[1063]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invitation to all Frenchmen,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and particularly to Beza.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The couriers of Rome stripped.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the twenty-fifth of July an invitation had everywhere\r\nbeen extended by proclamation at the sound of the trumpet, to all\r\nFrenchmen who had any correction of religious affairs at heart, to\r\nappear with perfect safety and be heard before the approaching assembly\r\nat Poissy.[1064] Even before this public announcement, however, steps\r\nhad been taken to secure the presence of the most distinguished orator\r\namong the reformed, and, next to Calvin, their most celebrated\r\ntheologian. On the fourteenth of July, the Parisian pastors, and, on the\r\nsucceeding days, the Prince of Condé, the Admiral, and the King of\r\nNavarre, had written to Theodore Beza, begging him to come and thus take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity offered by the favorable disposition of the\r\nroyal court.[1065] Similar invitations were sent to Pietro Vermigli--the\r\ncelebrated reformer of Zurich, better known by the name of Peter\r\nMartyr--a native of Florence, now just sixty-one years of age, whose\r\neloquence, it was hoped, might exercise a deep influence upon his\r\ncountrywoman, the queen mother.[1066] So earnest, indeed, was the court\r\nin its desire to bring about the conference, that Catharine, well aware\r\nthat, should tidings of the project reach the ears of the Pope, he would\r\nleave no stone unturned to frustrate her design, gave secret orders that\r\nall the couriers that left France for Rome about this time should be\r\nstripped of their despatches on the Italian borders! This daring step\r\nwas actually executed by means of the governors of cities in Piedmont,\r\nwho were devoted to her interests.[1067]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French sincerity doubted.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this flattering invitation, however, there was much in the\r\ncondition of French affairs, especially in view of the edict of July\r\njust published, that made the two Swiss reformers and their colleagues\r\nhesitate before undertaking a mission which might possibly prove\r\nproductive of less benefit than injury to the cause they had at heart.\r\nWell might they suspect the sincerity of a court from which so unfair an\r\nordinance as that of July had but just emanated. What good results could\r\nflow from an interview for which the blood-stained persecutor of their\r\nbrethren, Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, professed his eagerness,\r\npromising himself and his friends an easy victory over the Huguenot\r\norators?[1068]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Urgency of Parisian Huguenots.]\r\n\r\nThe Protestants of Paris viewed the matter in a different light. So soon\r\nas they heard that Beza had concluded not to accede to their request,\r\nthey wrote again, on the tenth of August. In this letter they begged\r\nhim, although it was already so late that they had little hope of his\r\nbeing able to reach Poissy in time to take part in the opening of the\r\ncolloquy, at least to change his mind, and to set out as soon, and\r\ntravel as expeditiously as possible, in order to succor those who had,\r\nin his absence, entered upon the contest. Already, seeing little\r\neagerness on the part of the Protestants, their adversaries had begun to\r\nboast of victory. The common cry at Paris, even, was that the\r\nProtestants would not dare to maintain their errors \"before so good a\r\ncompany.\" If the prelates should be allowed to adjourn without advantage\r\nbeing taken of the opportunity accorded the reformers of defending their\r\nfaith, the nobles would be too much disgusted to interfere in their\r\nbehalf a second time; and the queen had distinctly said that, in that\r\ncase, she would never be able to believe that they had any right on\r\ntheir side. \"As to the edict,\" they added, \"which has induced you to\r\nadopt this resolution, although it is very bad, yet it can place you in\r\nno danger; for by it there is nothing condemned excepting the\r\n'assemblies;' and as to simple heresy, as they call it, it can at most\r\nbe punished only by banishment from the kingdom, without other loss.\r\nMoreover, we know with certainty that this edict was made for the sole\r\npurpose of contenting King Philip and the Pope, and drawing some money\r\nfrom the ecclesiastics. These ends are bad, but it seems to us that\r\nthere is nothing in all this that ought to prevent our appearing for the\r\nmaintenance of the truth of God, since it has pleased Him to give us the\r\nopportunity of coming forward and being heard, as we have so long\r\ndesired.\"[1069] Two days later Antoine of Navarre added his\r\nsolicitations in an earnest letter to the \"Magnificent Seigniors, the\r\nSyndics and Council of the Seigniory of Geneva.\"[1070]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza comes to St. Germain.]\r\n\r\nThat it was no personal fear which had occasioned Beza's delay was soon\r\nproved. Antoine had written on the twelfth of August; on the sixteenth,\r\nwithout waiting for a safe-conduct, the reformer was already on his way\r\nto St. Germain, acting upon the principle laid down by Calvin: \"If it be\r\nnot yet God's pleasure to open a _door_, it is our duty to creep in at\r\nthe _windows_, or to penetrate through the smallest _crevices_, rather\r\nthan allow the opportunity of effecting a happy arrangement to escape\r\nus.\"[1071] So expeditious, in fact, was Beza, that on the twenty-second\r\nof August he was in Paris.[1072] The next day he reached the royal court\r\nat St. Germain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's previous history.]\r\n\r\nThe theologian whose advent had been so anxiously awaited was a French\r\nexile for religion's sake. Born, on the twenty-fourth of June, 1519, of\r\nnoble parents, in the small but famous Burgundian city of Vezelay, none\r\nof the reformers sacrificed more flattering prospects than did Theodore\r\nBeza when he cast in his lot with the persecuted Protestants. At Bourges\r\nhe had been a pupil of Wolmar, until that eminent teacher was recalled\r\nto Germany. At Orleans he had been admitted a licentiate in law when\r\nscarcely twenty years old. At Paris he gave to the world a volume of\r\nLatin poetry of no mean merit, which secured the author great applause.\r\nThe \"Juvenilia\" were neither more nor less pagan in tone than the rest\r\nof the amatory literature of the age framed on the model of the\r\nclassics. That they were immoral seems never to have been suspected\r\nuntil Beza became a Protestant, and it was desirable to find means to\r\nsully his reputation. The discovery of the hidden depths of iniquity in\r\nthe reformer's youthful productions it was reserved for the same\r\nprurient imaginations to make that afterward fancied that they had\r\ndetected obscene allusions in the most innocent lines of the Huguenot\r\npsalter. At the age of forty-two years, Beza, after having successively\r\ndischarged with great ability the functions of professor of Greek in the\r\nAcadémie of Lausanne, and of professor of theology in that of Geneva,\r\nwas, next to Calvin, the most distinguished Protestant teacher of French\r\norigin. He was a man of commanding presence, of extensive erudition, of\r\nquick and ready wit, of elegant manners and bearing. No better selection\r\ncould have been made by the Huguenots of a champion to represent them at\r\nthe court of Charles the Ninth.[1073]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wrangling of the prelates.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the prelates had been in session more than three weeks. But\r\nlittle good had thus far come of their deliberations. In vain, had the\r\nking delivered before them a speech in which he incited them \"to provide\r\nsuch good means that the people might be induced to live in concord, and\r\nin obedience to the Catholic Church.\" In vain had he assured them that\r\nhe would not give them permission to separate until they had made a\r\nsatisfactory settlement of the religious affairs of the kingdom.[1074]\r\nThe prelates much preferred to fritter away their time in the discussion\r\nof petty details of ecclesiastical order and discipline--in regulating\r\nthe number of priests, settling the dignity of cathedral churches,\r\nprescribing the duties of bishops, and other matters of equal\r\nimportance--\"fancying that, in answering such questions, they were\r\napplying an efficacious remedy to the ills that desolated the church in\r\nthese times of troubles and divisions.\"[1075] In the words of a minister\r\nof state, writing to a French ambassador on the very day of Beza's\r\narrival at court, they intended to treat of the reformation of manners\r\nalone, \"without coming to the point of doctrine, which they had as lief\r\ntouch as handle fire.\"[1076]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Châtillon's communion.]\r\n\r\nThe doubtful allegiance of some of their own number to the Romish Church\r\nwas a source of peculiar vexation. As the prelates were about to join in\r\nthe celebration of the Lord's Supper, Cardinal Châtillon and two other\r\nbishops insisted upon communicating under both forms; and when their\r\ndemand was refused, they went to another church and celebrated the\r\ndivine ordinance with many of the nobility, all partaking both of the\r\nbread and of the wine, thus earning for themselves the nickname of\r\nProtestants.[1077]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Determination of Catharine and L'Hospital.]\r\n\r\nWhat with the disinclination of the bishops to enter into the\r\nconsideration of the real difficulties that beset the kingdom, and the\r\nopen hostility of the Pope and of Philip the Second[1078] to any\r\nassembly that bore the least resemblance to a national council,\r\nCatharine and her principal adviser, the chancellor, had an arduous and\r\nwell-nigh hopeless task. They strove to quiet the King of Spain and the\r\nPope by the assurance that the prelates had only been assembled in\r\norder to prepare them to go in a body to attend the universal council\r\nsoon to be convened. \"Those who are dangerously ill,\" wrote Catharine in\r\nher defence, \"may be excused for applying all herbs to their ache, in\r\norder to alleviate it when it becomes insupportable. Meanwhile they send\r\nfor the good physician--whom I take to be a good council--to cure so\r\nfurious and dangerous a disease.\" Only those who feel the suffering, she\r\nintimated, can talk understandingly with respect to its treatment.[1079]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A remarkable letter to the Pope.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect produced at Rome.]\r\n\r\nCatharine was not, however, satisfied with this general apology; she\r\neven undertook to express to the pontifical court her idea of some of\r\nthe reforms which were dictated by the times.[1080] On the fourth of\r\nAugust--nearly three weeks before Beza's arrival--she wrote a letter to\r\nPius the Fourth of so radical a character that its authenticity has been\r\ncalled into question, although without sufficient reason. After\r\nacquainting the Pope with the extraordinary increase in the number of\r\nthose who had forsaken the Roman Church, and with the impossibility of\r\nrestoring unity by means of coercion, she declared it a special mark of\r\ndivine favor that there were among the dissidents neither Anabaptists\r\nnor Libertines, for all held the creed as explained by the early\r\ncouncils of the Church. It was, consequently, the conviction of many\r\npious persons that, by the concession of some points of practice, the\r\npresent divisions might be healed. But more frequent and peaceful\r\nconferences must be held, the ministers of religion must preach concord\r\nand charity to their flocks, and the scruples of those who still\r\nremained in the pale of the Church must be removed by the abolition of\r\nall unnecessary and objectionable practices. Images, forbidden by God\r\nand disapproved of by the Fathers, ought at once to be banished from\r\npublic worship, baptism to be stripped of its exorcisms, communion in\r\nboth forms to be restored, the vernacular tongue to be employed in the\r\nservices of the church, private masses to be discountenanced. Such were\r\nthe abuses which it seemed proper to correct, while leaving the papal\r\nauthority undiminished, and the doctrines of the Church unaffected by\r\ninnovations.[1081] To such a length was a woman--herself devoid of\r\nstrong convictions, and possessing otherwise little sympathy with the\r\nbelief or the practice of the reformers--carried by the force of the\r\ncurrent by which she was surrounded. But, whether the letter was\r\ndictated by L'Hospital, or inspired by Bishop Montluc--at this time\r\nsuspected of being more than half a Huguenot at heart--the fact that a\r\nproduction openly condemning the Roman Catholic traditional usages on\r\nmore than one point should have emanated from the pen of Catharine de'\r\nMedici, is certainly somewhat remarkable. At Rome the letter produced a\r\ndeep impression. If the Pope did not at once give utterance to his\r\nserious apprehensions, he was at least confirmed in his resolution to\r\nredeem his pledge in respect to a universal council, and he must have\r\ncongratulated himself on having already despatched an able negotiator to\r\nthe French court, in the person of the Cardinal of Ferrara, a legate\r\nwhose intrigues will occupy us again presently.[1082]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's flattering reception.]\r\n\r\nDespite Pope and prelates, Beza met with the most flattering reception.\r\nHe was welcomed upon his arrival by the principal statesmen of the\r\nkingdom. L'Hospital showed his eagerness to obtain the credit of having\r\nintroduced him. Coligny, the King of Navarre, and the Prince of Condé\r\nbetrayed their joy at his coming. The Cardinals of Bourbon and Châtillon\r\nshook hands with him. Indeed, the contrast between Bourbon's present\r\ncordiality and his coldness a year before at Nérac, provoked Beza to\r\nmake the playful remark that \"he had not undergone any change since the\r\ncardinal had refused to speak to him through fear of being\r\nexcommunicated.\"[1083] Afterward, attended by a numerous escort,[1084]\r\nthe reformer was conducted to the quarters of the Prince of Condé, where\r\nthe princess and Madame de Coligny showed themselves \"marvellously well\r\ndisposed.\" On the morrow, which was Sunday, Beza preached in the\r\nprince's apartments before a large and honorable audience. Condé\r\nhimself, however, was absent, engaged in making that unfortunate St.\r\nBartholomew's Day reconciliation with the Duke of Guise, of which\r\nmention has already been made.[1085] Certainly neither Beza nor the\r\nother reformers could complain of the greeting extended to them. \"They\r\nreceived a more cordial welcome than would have awaited the Pope of\r\nRome, had he come to the French court,\" remarks a contemporary curate\r\nwith a spice of bitterness.[1086]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza meets Cardinal Lorraine.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cardinal professes to be satisfied.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A witty woman's caution.]\r\n\r\nThat very evening Beza and Lorraine crossed swords for the first time in\r\nthe apartments of Navarre.[1087] The former, coming by invitation, was\r\nmuch surprised to find there before him not only Antoine and his\r\nbrothers, but Catharine de' Medici and Cardinal Lorraine, neither of\r\nwhom had he previously met. Without losing his self-possession, however,\r\nhe briefly adverted to the occasion of his coming, and the queen mother\r\nin return graciously expressed the joy she would experience should his\r\nadvent conduce to the peace and quietness of the realm. Hereupon the\r\ncardinal took part in the conversation, and said that he hoped Beza\r\nmight be as zealous in allaying the troubles of France as he had been\r\nsuccessful in fomenting discord--a remark which Beza did not let pass\r\nunchallenged, for he declared that he neither had distracted nor\r\nintended to distract his native land. From inquiries respecting Beza's\r\ngreat master, Calvin, his age and health, the discourse turned to\r\ncertain obnoxious expressions which Lorraine attributed to Beza himself;\r\nbut the latter entirely disclaimed being their author, much to the\r\nconfusion of the cardinal, who had expected to create a strong prejudice\r\nagainst his opponent in the minds of the by-standers. The greater part\r\nof the evening, however, was consumed in a discussion respecting the\r\nreal presence. Beza, while denying that the sacramental bread and wine\r\nwere transmuted into the body and blood of Christ, was willing to admit,\r\naccording to Calvin's views and his own, \"that the bread is\r\nsacramentally Christ's body--that is, that although that body is now in\r\nheaven alone, while we have the signs with us on earth, yet the very\r\nbody of Christ is as truly given to us and received by faith, and that\r\nto our eternal life, on account of God's promise, as the sign is in a\r\nnatural manner placed in our hands.\"[1088] The statement was certainly\r\nfar enough removed from the theory of the Romish Church to have\r\nconsigned its author to the flames, had the theologians of the Sorbonne\r\nbeen his judges. But it satisfied the cardinal,[1089] who confessed that\r\nhe was little at home in a discussion foreign to his ordinary studies--a\r\nfact quite sufficiently apparent from his confused statements[1090]--and\r\ndid not attempt to conceal the little account which he made of the dogma\r\nof transubstantiation.[1091] \"See then, madam,\" said Beza, \"what are\r\nthose sacramentarians, who have been so long persecuted and overwhelmed\r\nwith all kinds of calumnies.\" \"Do you hear, cardinal?\" said the queen to\r\nLorraine. \"He says that the sacramentarians hold no other opinion than\r\nthat to which you have assented.\"[1092] With this satisfactory\r\nconclusion the discussion, which had lasted a couple of hours,[1093] was\r\nconcluded. The queen mother left greatly pleased with the substantial\r\nagreement which the two champions of opposite creeds had attained in\r\ntheir first interview, and flattering herself that greater results might\r\nattend the public conferences. The cardinal, too, professed high esteem\r\nfor Beza, and said to him, as he was going away: \"I adjure you to\r\nconfer with me; you will not find me so black as I am painted.\"[1094]\r\nBeza might have been pardoned, had he permitted the cardinal's\r\nprofessions somewhat to shake his convictions of the man's true\r\ncharacter. He was, however, placed on his guard by the pointed words of\r\na witty woman. Madame de Crussol, who had listened to the entire\r\nconversation, as she shook the cardinal's hand at the close of the\r\nevening, significantly said, in a voice loud enough to be heard by all:\r\n\"Good man for to-night; but to-morrow--what?\"[1095] The covert\r\nprediction was soon fulfilled. The very next day the cardinal was\r\nindustriously circulating the story that Beza had been vanquished in\r\ntheir first encounter.[1096]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Huguenot petition.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vexatious delay.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The petition informally granted.]\r\n\r\nThe Protestant ministers, assembled at St. Germain about ten days before\r\nBeza's arrival,[1097] had, with wise forethought, presented to the king\r\na petition embracing four points of prime importance.[1098] They guarded\r\nagainst an unfair treatment of the cause they had come to maintain, by\r\ndemanding that their opponents, the prelates, should not be permitted to\r\nconstitute themselves their judges, that the king and his council should\r\npreside in the conferences, and that the controversy should be decided\r\nby reference to the Word of God. Moreover, lest the incidents of the\r\ndiscussion should be perverted, and each party should so much the more\r\nconfidently arrogate to itself the credit of victory as the claim was\r\nmore difficult of refutation, they insisted on the propriety of\r\nappointing, by common consent of the two parties, clerks whose duty it\r\nwould be to take down in writing an accurate account of the entire\r\nproceedings. To so reasonable a petition the court felt compelled to\r\nreturn a gracious reply. The requests could not, however, be definitely\r\ngranted, the ministers were told, without first consulting the prelates,\r\nand gaining, if possible, their consent.[1099] This was no easy matter.\r\nMany of the doctors of Poissy, and even some members of the council,\r\nmaintained that with condemned heretics, such as the Huguenots had long\r\nbeen, it was wrong to hold any sort of discussion.[1100] Day after day\r\npassed, but the attainment of the object for which the ministers had\r\ncome seemed no nearer than when they left their distant homes. They were\r\nnot yet permitted to appear before the king and vindicate the confession\r\nof faith which they had, several months before, declared themselves\r\nprepared to maintain.[1101] Meantime it was notorious that their enemies\r\nwere ceaselessly plotting to arrange every detail of the conference--if,\r\nindeed, it must be held--in a manner so unfavorable to the reformers,\r\nthat they might rather appear to be culprits brought up for trial and\r\nsentence, before a court composed of Romish prelates, than as the\r\nadvocates of a purer faith.[1102] At length, weary of the protracted\r\ndelay, the Protestant ministers presented themselves before Catharine\r\nde' Medici, on the eighth of September, and demanded the impartial\r\nhearing to which they were entitled; and they plainly announced their\r\nintention to depart at once, unless they should receive satisfactory\r\nassurances that they would be shielded from the malice of their\r\nenemies.[1103] It was well for the Protestants that they exhibited such\r\ndecision. Catharine, who always deferred a definite decision on\r\nimportant matters until the last moment--a habit not unfrequently\r\nleading to the hurried adoption of the means least calculated to effect\r\nher selfish ends--was constrained to yield a portion of their demands.\r\nIn the presence of the Protestants an informal decree was passed, with\r\nthe consent of Navarre, Condé, Coligny, and the chancellor[1104]--those\r\nmembers of the council who happened to be in the audience chamber--that\r\nthe bishops should not be made judges; that to one of the secretaries of\r\nstate should be assigned the duty of writing out the minutes of the\r\nconference, but that the Protestants should retain the right of\r\nappending such notes as they might deem proper. The king would be\r\npresent at the discussions, together with the princes of the blood. But\r\nCatharine peremptorily declined to grant a formal decree according these\r\npoints. This, she said, would only be to furnish the opposite party with\r\na plausible pretext for refusing to enter into the colloquy.[1105]\r\nMeanwhile she urged them to maintain a modest demeanor, and to seek only\r\nthe glory of God, which she professed to believe that they had greatly\r\nat heart.[1106]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last efforts of the Sorbonne to prevent the colloquy.]\r\n\r\nThe Romish party, however, was unwilling to approach the distasteful\r\nconference without a final attempt to dissuade the queen from so\r\nperilous an undertaking. As the Protestants left Catharine's apartments,\r\na deputation of doctors of the Sorbonne entered the door. They came to\r\nbeg her not to grant a hearing to heretics already so often condemned.\r\nIf this request could not be accorded, they suggested that at least the\r\ntender ears of the king should be spared exposure to a dangerous\r\ninfection. But Catharine was too far committed to listen to their\r\npetition. She was resolved that the colloquy should be held, and held in\r\nthe king's presence.[1107]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 968: Evidently the Guises had acquiesced with so much alacrity\r\nin the convocation of the States General only because of their\r\nconfidence in their power to intimidate any party that should undertake\r\nto oppose them.

How deep the disappointment felt by the Protestants at the\r\nconstable's course must have been, can be gathered from the sanguine\r\npicture of the prospects of the French Reformation drawn by Languet a\r\ncouple of months earlier. Arguing from the comparative mildness of\r\nMontmorency in the persecutions under Henry II., from the fact that he\r\nhad allowed no one of his five sons to enter the ecclesiastical state,\r\nwhich offered rare opportunities of advancement, and from the influence\r\nwhich his sons and his three nephews--all favorably inclined to, if not\r\nopen adherents of the new doctrines--would exert over the old man, he\r\nnot unnaturally came to this conclusion: \"I am, therefore, of opinion\r\nthat, if the Guises still retain any power, the constable will join\r\nNavarre for the purpose of overwhelming them, and will make no\r\nopposition to Navarre if he sets on foot a moderate reformation of\r\ndoctrine.\" Epist. secr., ii., p. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1022: La Place and De Thou, _ubi supra_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1023: This document first appears in the Mémoires de Condé,\r\nunder the title \"Sommaire des choses premièrement accordées entre les\r\nDucs de Montmorency Connestable, et De Guyse Grand Maistre, Pairs de\r\nFrance, et le Mareschal Sainct André, pour la Conspiration du\r\nTriumvirat, et depuis mises en déliberation à l'entrée du Sacré et\r\nSainct Concile de Trente, et arrestée entre les Parties, en leur privé\r\nConseil faict contre les Hérétiques, et contre le Roy de Navarre, en\r\ntant qu'il gouverne et conduit mal les affaires de Charles neufiesme Roy\r\nde France, Mineur; lequel est Autheur de continuel accroissement de la\r\nnouvelle Secte qui pullule en France.\" The principal provisions are\r\ngiven by De Thou, iii. (liv. xxix.) 142, 143, under date of 1562, who\r\nexplicitly states his disbelief of its authenticity. Neither, indeed,\r\ndoes the compiler of the Mém. de Condé vouch for it. Among other\r\nobjections that have been urged with force against the genuineness of\r\nthe document, are the following: The improbability that the Triumvirs\r\nwould mature a plan involving all the Catholic sovereigns of Europe\r\nwithout previously obtaining their consent, of which there is no trace;\r\nthe inconsistency of the project with the well-known policy and\r\ncharacter of the German Emperor Ferdinand; the improbability that the\r\nCouncil of Trent would indorse a plan aimed at the humiliation of\r\nNavarre, who, when the council actually reassembled in January, 1562,\r\nwas completely won over to the Roman party. In favor of the document may\r\nbe urged: First, that M. Capefigue (Histoire de la réforme, de la ligue,\r\netc., ii. 243-245) asserts: \"J'ai trouvé cette pièce, qu'on a crue\r\nsupposée, en original et signée dans les MSS. Colbert, bibl. du roi.\"\r\nProf. Soldan, who has devoted an appendix to the first volume of his\r\nGesch. des Prot. in Frankreich, to a discussion of this reported\r\nagreement between the Triumvirs, was unsuccessful in finding any trace\r\nof such a paper. Secondly, that the Mémoires de Guise, the manuscript of\r\nwhich, according to the statement of the editor, M. Aimé Champollion,\r\nfils (Notice sur François de Lorraine, due d'Aumale et de Guise,\r\nprefixed to his Mémoires, first published in the Collection\r\nMichaud-Poujoulat, 1851, p. 5), is partly in the handwriting of the duke\r\nhimself, partly in that of his secretary, Millet, insert the \"Sommaire\"\r\nprecisely as it stands in the Mémoires de Condé, without any denial of\r\nits authenticity. This would appear, at first sight, to settle the\r\nquestion beyond cavil. But it must be borne in mind that many of the\r\nmémoires of the sixteenth century are compiled on the plan of including\r\nall contemporary papers of importance, whether written by friend or by\r\nfoe. Frequently the most contradictory narratives of the same event are\r\nplaced side by side, with little or no comment. This is precisely the\r\ncase with those of Guise, in which, for example, no less than _four_\r\naccounts--_three_ of them from Huguenot sources--are given of the\r\nmassacre of Vassy. Now we have the testimony of De Thou (_ubi supra_)\r\nthat this agreement, industriously circulated by the Prince of Condé and\r\nthe Huguenots, made a powerful impression not only in France, but in\r\nGermany and all Northern Europe. So important a document, even if a\r\nforgery, would naturally find a place in such a collection as the\r\nMémoires of Guise. Altogether the matter is in a singularly interesting\r\nposition. Could the manuscript seen by M. Capefigue be found and\r\nre-examined critically, the truth might, perhaps, be reached. M. Henri\r\nMartin, in his excellent Histoire de France, x. 79, note, accepts the\r\ndocument as genuine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1024: The \"plebe e populo minuto,\" the Venetian Michiel tell\r\nus, \"è quello che si vede certo con gran fervenzia e devozione\r\nfrequentar le chiese, e continuar li riti cattolici.\" Relations des Amb.\r\nVén. i., 412.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1025: \"Aulcuns desditz ecclésiasticques,\" is Claude Haton's\r\ningenuous admission respecting his fellow priests of this period,\r\n\"estoient fort vicieux encores pour lors, et les plus vicieux estoient\r\nceux qui plus resistoient auxditz huguenotz, jusques à mettre la main\r\naux cousteaux et aux armes.\" Mémoires, i. 129.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1026: Mémoires de Condé, i. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1027: \"In viginti urbibus aut circiter trucidati fuerunt pii a\r\nfuriosa plebe.\" Letter of Calvin to Bullinger, May 24, 1561, _apud_\r\nBaum, ii., App., 33.

In those of Languedoc, held at\r\nMontpellier in March, 1561, Terlon, a \"capitoul\" of Toulouse, speaking\r\nfor the \"tiers état,\" advocated the sale of all the secular possessions\r\nof the clergy, reserving only a residence for the incumbent, and\r\nassigning him a pension equal to his present income, to be paid by the\r\ncities of the kingdom. Chabot, a lawyer of Nismes, went further, and,\r\nwhen the clamor of the people had secured the hearing at first denied\r\nhim, did not hesitate to say that the burdens of the province should be\r\nplaced upon the shoulders of the priests and monks--whom he stigmatized\r\nas ignorant and corrupt--because of the evils they had inflicted upon\r\nthe people. He even wanted a petition to this effect, signed by thirty\r\nsyndicates favorable to the reformed religion, to be inserted in the\r\n_cahier_ of Languedoc.

Some\r\nsuch wholesale confiscation seems even to have entered into the plans of\r\nthe cabinet. In May, 1561, royal letters were sent to the Bishop of\r\nParis, to the provost, and indeed, throughout France, demanding a return\r\nof the true value of all episcopal and other revenues (Mémoires de\r\nCondé, i. 27). The object was plain enough. The clergy remonstrated\r\nenergetically, as may be imagined (Ib., i. 29-39).

That morning, at ten o'clock, a procession of\r\nministers and delegates of the Reformed churches left St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye on horseback for the village of Poissy. The ministers,\r\ntwelve in number, were men of note: Théodore de Bèze, or Beza, with whom\r\nthe reader is already well acquainted; Augustin Marlorat, a native of\r\nLorraine, formerly a monk, but now famous in the Protestant ranks, and\r\nthe leading pastor in Rouen, a man over fifty years of age; François de\r\nSaint Paul, a learned theologian and the founder of the churches of\r\nMontélimart, a delegate from Provence; Jean Raymond Merlin, professor of\r\nHebrew at Geneva, and chaplain of Admiral Coligny; Jean Malot, pastor at\r\nParis; François de Morel, who had presided in the First National Synod\r\nof 1559, and had recently been given to the Duchess Renée of Ferrara, as\r\nher private chaplain; Nicholas Folion, surnamed La Vallée, a former\r\ndoctor of the Sorbonne, now pastor at Orleans; Claude de la Boissière,\r\nof Saintes; Jean Bouquin, of Oléron; Jean Virel; Jean de la Tour, a\r\npatriarch of nearly seventy years; and Nicholas des Gallars, who, after\r\nhaving been a prominent preacher at Geneva and Paris, had for the past\r\ntwo years ministered to the large congregation of French refugees in\r\nLondon. It was a body of Huguenot theologians unsurpassed for ability by\r\nany others within the kingdom.[1108]\r\n\r\nSo high ran the excitement of the populace, stirred up by frequent\r\nappeals to the worst passions in the human breast, and by highly-colored\r\naccounts of the boldness with which the \"new doctrines\" had for weeks\r\nbeen preached within the precincts of the court, that serious\r\napprehension was entertained lest Beza and his companions might be\r\nassaulted by the way.[1109] The peaceable ministers of religion were,\r\ntherefore, accompanied by a strong escort of one hundred mounted archers\r\nof the royal guard. After a ride of less than half an hour, they reached\r\nthe nuns' convent, in which the prelates had been holding their\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assembly in the nuns' refectory.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The prelates.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, an august and imposing assembly was gathered in the spacious\r\nconventual refectory.[1110] On an elevated seat, upon the dais at its\r\nfarther extremity, was the king, on whose youthful shoulders rested the\r\ncrushing weight of the government of a kingdom rent by discordant\r\nsentiments and selfish factions, and already upon the verge of an open\r\ncivil war. Near him sat his wily mother--that \"merchant's daughter\"\r\nwhose plebeian origin the first Christian baron of France had pointed\r\nout with ill-disguised contempt, but whose plans and purposes had now\r\nacquired such world-wide importance that grave diplomats and shrewd\r\nchurchmen esteemed the difficult riddle of her sphinx-like countenance\r\nand character a worthy subject of prolonged study. Not far from their\r\nroyal brother, were two children: the elder, a boy of ten years, Edward\r\nAlexander, a few years later to appear on the pages of history under\r\nthe altered name of Henry the Third, the last Valois King of France; the\r\nyounger, a girl of nine--that Margaret of Valois and Navarre, whose\r\nnuptials have attained a celebrity as wide as the earth and as lasting\r\nas the records of religious dissensions. Antoine and Louis of Bourbon,\r\nbrothers by blood but not in character; Jeanne d'Albret, heiress of\r\nNavarre, more queenly at heart than many a sovereign with dominions far\r\nexceeding the contracted territory of Béarn; the princes representing\r\nmore distant branches of the royal stock, and the members of the council\r\nof state, completed the group. On two long benches, running along the\r\nopposite sides of the hall, the prelates were arranged according to\r\ntheir dignities. Tournon, Lorraine, and Châtillon, each in full\r\ncardinal's robes, faced their brethren of the Papal Consistory,\r\nArmagnac, Bourbon, and Guise, while a long row of archbishops and\r\nbishops filled out the line on either side. Altogether, forty or fifty\r\nprelates, with numerous attendant theologians and members of the\r\nsuperior clergy, regular and secular, had been marshalled to oppose the\r\nlittle band of reformers.[1111]\r\n\r\nIt was an array of pomp and power, of ecclesiastical place and wealth\r\nand ambition, of traditional and hereditary nobility, of all that an\r\nancient and powerful church could muster to meet the attack of fresh and\r\nvigorous thought, the inroad of moral and religious reforms, the\r\nirrepressible conflict of a faith based solely upon a written\r\nrevelation. The external promise of victory was all on the side of the\r\nprelates. Yet, strange to say, the engagement that was about to take\r\nplace was none of their seeking. With the exception of the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, they were well-nigh unanimous in reprobating a venture from\r\nwhich they apprehended only disaster. Perhaps even Lorraine now repented\r\nhis presumption, and felt less assured of his dialectic skill since he\r\nhad tried the mettle of his Genevese antagonist. Rarely has battle been\r\nforced upon an army after a greater number of fruitless attempts to\r\navoid it than those made by the French ecclesiastics, backed by the\r\nalternate solicitations and menaces of Pius the Fourth, and Philip of\r\nSpain. Such reluctance was ominous.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the feeling of the reformers was, indeed, confidence\r\nin the excellence of the cause they represented, but confidence not\r\nunmingled with anxiety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diffidence of Beza.]\r\n\r\nA letter written by Beza only a few days before affords us a glimpse of\r\nthe secret apprehensions of the Protestants. \"If Martyr come in time,\"\r\nhe wrote Calvin, \"that is, if he greatly hasten, his arrival will\r\nrefresh us exceedingly. We shall have to do with veteran sophists, and,\r\nalthough we be confident that the simple truth of the Word will prove\r\nvictorious, yet it is not in the power of every man instantly to resolve\r\ntheir artifices and allege the sayings of the Fathers. Moreover, it will\r\nbe necessary for us to make such answers that we shall not seem, to the\r\ncircle of princes and others that stand by, to be seeking to evade the\r\nquestion. In short, when I contemplate these difficulties, I become\r\nexceedingly anxious, and much do I deplore our fault in neglecting the\r\nexcellent instruments which God has given us, and thus in a manner\r\nappearing to tempt His goodness. Meanwhile, however, we have resolved\r\nnot to retreat, and we trust in Him who has promised us a wisdom which\r\nthe world cannot resist.... Direct us, my father, like children by your\r\ncounsels in your absence from us, since you cannot be present with us.\r\nFor, simple children I daily see and feel that we are, from whose mouth\r\nI hope that our wonderful Lord will perfect the praise of His\r\nwisdom.\"[1112]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: L'Hospital explains the objects in view.]\r\n\r\nThe king opened the conference with a few words before the Protestants\r\nwere admitted,[1113] and then called upon the chancellor to explain more\r\nfully the objects of the gathering. Hereupon Michel de L'Hospital,\r\nseating himself, by Charles's direction, on a stool at the king's right\r\nhand, set forth at considerable length the religious dissensions which\r\nhad fallen upon France, and the ineffectual measures to which the king\r\nand his predecessors had from time to time resorted. Severity and\r\nmildness had proved equally futile. Dangerous division had crept in. He\r\nbegged the assembled prelates to heal this disease of the body politic,\r\nto appease the anger of God visibly resting upon the kingdom by every\r\nmeans in their power; especially to reform any abuses contrary to God's\r\nword and the ordinances of the apostles, which the sloth or ignorance of\r\nthe clergy might have introduced, and thus remove every excuse which\r\ntheir enemies might possess for slandering them and disturbing the peace\r\nof the country. As the chief cause of sedition was diversity of\r\nreligious opinion, Charles had acceded to the advice of two previous\r\nassemblies, and had granted a safe-conduct to the ministers of the new\r\nsect, hoping that an amicable conference with them would be productive\r\nof great advantage. He, therefore, prayed the company to receive them as\r\na father receives his children, and to take pains to instruct them.\r\nThen, at all events, it could not be said, as had so often been said in\r\nthe past, that the dissenters had been condemned without a hearing.\r\nMinutes of the proceedings carefully made and disseminated through the\r\nkingdom would prove that the doctrine they professed had been refuted,\r\nnot by violence or authority, but by cogent reasoning. Charles would\r\ncontinue to be the protector of the Gallican Church.[1114]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenots are summoned.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's retort.]\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries over, the Protestants were summoned. Conducted by\r\nthe captain of the royal guard, they entered and advanced toward the\r\nking, until their farther progress was arrested by a railing which\r\nseparated the space allotted to the king and his courtiers, with the\r\nassembled prelates, from the lower end of the hall filled by a crowd of\r\ncurious spectators.[1115] No place had been assigned the Protestants\r\nwhere they might sit during the colloquy on an equality with their\r\nopponents, the Romish ecclesiastics. They were subjected to the paltry\r\nindignity of appearing in the guise of culprits brought to the bar to be\r\njudged and condemned. In truth, the spirit of conciliation which\r\nL'Hospital had been at so much pains to inculcate had found little\r\nwelcome in the breast of the prelates. \"Here come the Genevese curs,\"\r\nexclaimed a cardinal as the reformers made their appearance.\r\n\"Certainly,\" quietly retorted Beza, whose ear had caught the insulting\r\nexpression, turning to the quarter whence it came, \"faithful dogs are\r\nneeded in the Lord's sheep-fold to bark at the rapacious wolves.\"[1116]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's prayer and address.]\r\n\r\nWhen the twelve ministers had reached the bar, Theodore Beza, at their\r\nrequest, addressed the king: \"Sire, since the issue of all enterprises,\r\nboth great and small, depends upon the aid and favor of our God, and\r\nchiefly when these enterprises concern the interests of His service and\r\nmatters which surpass the capacity of our understandings, we hope that\r\nyour Majesty will not find it amiss or strange if we begin by the\r\ninvocation of His name, supplicating Him after the following manner.\"\r\n\r\nAs the orator pronounced these words, he reverently kneeled upon the\r\nfloor. His colleagues and the delegates of the churches followed his\r\nexample. A deep solemnity fell upon the assembly. According to one\r\naccount of the scene, even the Roman cardinals stood with uncovered\r\nheads while the Huguenot minister prayed. Catharine de' Medici joined\r\nwith still greater devotion, while King Charles remained seated on his\r\nthrone.[1117] After a moment's pause, Beza, with hands stretched out to\r\nheaven, according to the custom of the reformed churches of\r\nFrance,[1118] commenced his prayer with the confession of sins which in\r\nthe Genevan liturgy of Calvin formed the introduction to the worship of\r\nthe Lord's day.[1119]\r\n\r\n\"Lord God! Almighty and everlasting Father, we acknowledge and confess\r\nbefore Thy holy majesty that we are miserable sinners, conceived and\r\nborn in guilt and corruption, prone to do evil, unfit for any good; who,\r\nby reason of our depravity, transgress without end Thy holy\r\ncommandments. Wherefore we have drawn upon ourselves by Thy just\r\nsentence, condemnation and death. Nevertheless, O Lord, with heartfelt\r\nsorrow we repent and deplore our offences; and we condemn ourselves and\r\nour evil ways, with a true repentance beseeching that Thy grace may\r\nrelieve our distress. Be pleased, therefore, to have compassion upon us,\r\nO most gracious God! Father of all mercies; for the sake of thy son\r\nJesus Christ, our Lord and only Redeemer. And, in removing our guilt and\r\npollution, set us free and grant us the daily increase of Thy Holy\r\nSpirit; to the end that, acknowledging from our inmost hearts our\r\nunrighteousness, we may be touched with a sorrow that shall work true\r\nrepentance, and that this may mortify all our sins, and thereby bear the\r\nfruit of holiness and righteousness that shall be well-pleasing to thee,\r\nthrough the same Jesus Christ, our Lord and only Saviour.\r\n\r\n\"And, inasmuch as it pleaseth Thee this day so far to exhibit Thy favor\r\nto Thy poor and unprofitable servants, as to enable them with freedom,\r\nand in the presence of the king whom Thou hast set over them, and of the\r\nmost noble and illustrious company on earth, to declare that which Thou\r\nhast given them to know of Thy holy Truth, may it please Thee to\r\ncontinue the course of Thy goodness and loving kindness, O God and\r\nFather of lights, and so to illumine our understandings, guide our\r\naffections, and form them to all teachableness, and so to order our\r\nwords, that in all simplicity and truth, after having conceived,\r\naccording to the measure which it shall please Thee to grant unto us,\r\nthe secrets Thou hast revealed to men for their salvation, we may be\r\nable, both with heart and voice to propose that which may conduce to the\r\nhonor and glory of Thy holy name, and the prosperity and greatness of\r\nour king and of all those who belong to him, with the rest and comfort\r\nof all Christendom, and especially of this kingdom. O Almighty Lord and\r\nFather, we ask Thee all these things in the name and for the sake of\r\nJesus Christ, Thy Son our Saviour, as He Himself hath taught us to seek\r\nthem, saying: 'Our Father, which art in heaven, etc.'\"[1120]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His conciliatory remarks.]\r\n\r\nHaving concluded his petitions, Beza arose from his knees, and addressed\r\nthe king. His speech was graceful and conciliatory.[1121] It was a great\r\nprivilege, he said, for a faithful and affectionate subject to be\r\npermitted to see his prince, and thus to be more clearly impressed with\r\nthe fealty and submission which is his due. Still happier was he if\r\npermitted to be seen by his prince, and, what was more important, to be\r\nheard, and finally accepted and approved by him. To these great\r\nadvantages a part of Charles's very humble and obedient subjects, much\r\nto their regret, had long been strangers. It were sufficient ground for\r\ngratitude to God to the end of their days that now at length they were\r\ngranted an audience before the king and so noble and illustrious a\r\ncompany. But, when the same day that admitted them into the royal\r\npresence also invited, or rather kindly and gently constrained them\r\nwith common voice to confess the name of their God, and declare the\r\nobedience they owed Him, their minds were so incompetent to conceive,\r\ntheir tongues so inadequate to utter the promptings of their hearts,\r\nthat they preferred to confess their impotence by modest silence rather\r\nthan to disparage so great a benefit by the defect of their words. Yet\r\none of the points they had so long desired was still unfulfilled, and\r\nthat the most important, namely the acceptance of their service as\r\nagreeable. Would to God that so happy a termination might by their\r\ncoming be put, not so much to their past sufferings--of which the memory\r\nwas well-nigh extinguished by this joyful day--as to the troubles that\r\nhad afflicted the kingdom in consequence of religious dissensions, and\r\nto the attending ruin of so great a number of the king's poor subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenots victims of calumny.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their creed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Points of agreement.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His declaration as to the body of Christ.]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had hitherto prevented the Huguenots from obtaining a boon\r\nso long and ardently desired? It was the belief entertained by some that\r\nthey were, through ambition or restless love of innovation, the enemies\r\nof all concord, and the impression in the minds of others that their\r\narrogance demanded impossible conditions of peace. The prejudice arising\r\nfrom this and other sources to which he avoided an allusion, lest he\r\nmight seem to be reopening old wounds, was so strong, that the reformed\r\nwould have good reason to give way to despair, were they not sustained\r\nby a good conscience, by their assurance of the gentleness and equity of\r\nCharles and the illustrious princes of the blood, and by a charitable\r\npresumption that the prelates with whom they had come to confer were\r\ndisposed to exert themselves with them in the common endeavor rather to\r\nmake the truth clear than to obscure it. Respecting the extent of the\r\ndifferences between the prelatic and the reformed beliefs, those who\r\nrepresented them as of insignificant importance, and those who made them\r\nas great as between the creed of Christians and the creed of Jews or\r\nMoslems, were equally mistaken. If in some of the principal articles of\r\nthe Christian faith there was full agreement, on others, alas! there was\r\nan opposition between their tenets. The orator here enumerated in\r\nconsiderable detail the articles of the ancient creeds in which the\r\nHuguenot, not less than the Roman Catholic, professed his concurrence.\r\nWhat then, some one would say, are not these the terms of our belief? In\r\nwhat are we at variance? To which inquiry the true answer was, that the\r\ntwo sides differed not only because they gave some of these articles\r\ndivergent interpretations, but because the Church had built upon this\r\nfoundation a structure that comported little with it, \"as if the\r\nChristian religion were an edifice which was never finished.\" To speak\r\nwith greater detail, the reformed maintained, in opposition to the\r\nRomish theory, that there could be no satisfaction for sin save in\r\nChrist, and that to suppose the blessed Saviour to pay but a part of the\r\nprice of man's salvation, would be to rob him of his perfect mercy, and\r\nof his offices of prophet, priest, and king. They agreed with the\r\nRomanists neither in their definition of justifying faith, nor in their\r\naccount of its origin and effects. The same might be said respecting\r\ngood works. And, again, as to the Holy Scriptures, they received the Old\r\nand New Testaments as the word of God and the complete revelation of all\r\nthat is necessary for salvation, and consequently, as the touchstone for\r\ntesting the Fathers, the councils, and the traditions of the Church. Two\r\npoints remained for consideration: the sacraments and the government of\r\nthe Church. \"We are agreed, in our opinion,\" said Beza, \"regarding the\r\nmeaning of the word sacrament. The sacraments are visible signs by means\r\nof which our union with our Lord Jesus Christ is not merely signified or\r\nset forth, but is truly offered to us on the Lord's side, and therefore\r\nconfirmed, sealed, and, as it were, engraved by the Holy Spirit's\r\nefficiency in those who by a true faith apprehend Him who is thus\r\nsignified and presented to them. We, consequently, agree that in the\r\nsacraments there must necessarily supervene a heavenly, a supernatural\r\nchange. For we do not assert that the water of holy baptism is simply\r\nwater, but that it is a true sacrament of our regeneration, and of the\r\nwashing of our souls in the blood of Jesus Christ. So also we do not say\r\nthat the bread is simply bread, but the sacrament of the precious body\r\nof our Lord Jesus Christ which was offered up for us. Yet we do not say\r\nthat this change takes place in the substance of the signs, but in the\r\nuse and end for which they are ordained.\" The reformer then touched\r\nupon the doctrines of transubstantiation and consubstantiation; both of\r\nwhich he rejected. \"If then,\" he continued, \"some one asks us, whether\r\nwe make Jesus Christ absent from His Holy Supper, we answer that we do\r\nnot. But, if we regard the local distance (as we must do, when His\r\ncorporeal presence and His humanity distinctly considered are in\r\nquestion), we say that His body is as far removed from the bread and\r\nwine as the highest heaven is from the earth; since, as to ourselves, we\r\nare on the earth, and the sacraments also; while, as to Him, His flesh\r\nis in heaven, so glorified that his glory, as says St. Augustine, has\r\nnot taken away from Him the nature, but only the infirmity of a true\r\nbody.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outcry of the theologians of the Sorbonne.]\r\n\r\nThe last words of the sentence were inaudible, except to those who were\r\nclose to the speaker. The words, \"We say that His body is as far removed\r\nfrom the bread and wine as the highest heaven is from the earth,\" had\r\nfired the train to the magazine of concealed impatience and anger\r\nunderlying the studied external calmness of the prelatical body. An\r\nexplosion instantly ensued. The cry, \"Blasphemavit! Blasphemavit Deum!\"\r\nresounded from every quarter.[1122] Beza's voice was drowned in the\r\nnoisy expressions of disapproval by which the theologians of the\r\nSorbonne sought to testify their own unimpeachable orthodoxy.[1123] It\r\nseemed for the moment as if the ecclesiastics would continue their\r\nrepetition of the words and actions of the Jewish high-priest in the\r\nancient Sanhedrim, and break up the conference with the exclamation:\r\n\"What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard his\r\nblasphemy.\" Some of the prelates arose as if to leave, and Cardinal\r\nTournon went so far as to address himself to Charles and beg him either\r\nto impose silence upon Beza, or to permit him and his brother\r\necclesiastics to retire. But no notice was taken of his request.[1124]\r\nOn the contrary, the queen and the Cardinal of Lorraine felt constrained\r\nto express their displeasure at this outburst of passion on the part of\r\nthe prelates, and their desire that the conference should proceed.[1125]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's peroration.]\r\n\r\nWhen the storm had somewhat spent its violence, and comparative silence\r\nhad been restored, Beza, in no wise discomposed by the uproar, resumed\r\nhis interrupted discourse. He deemed it unnecessary to dwell upon the\r\nmatter of the administration of holy baptism, he said, for none could\r\nconfound the reformers with the Anabaptists, who found no more\r\ndetermined enemies than they were. With respect to the other five\r\nsacraments of the Romish Church, while the reformed refused to designate\r\nthem by that name, they believed that among themselves true confirmation\r\nwas established, penitence enjoined, marriage celebrated, ordination\r\nconferred, and the visitation of the sick and dying practised,\r\nconformably to God's Word. The last point--the government of the\r\nChurch--Beza despatched with a few words; for, appealing to the prelates\r\nthemselves to testify to the results of their recent deliberations, he\r\ndescribed the structure ecclesiastic as one in which everything was so\r\nperverted, everything in such confusion and ruin, that scarce could the\r\nbest architects in the world, whether they considered the present order\r\nor had regard to life and morals, recognize the remains, or detect the\r\ntraces of that ancient edifice so symmetrically laid out and reared by\r\nthe apostles. He closed by declaring the fervent desire of those whose\r\nspokesman he was for the restoration of the Church to its pristine\r\npurity, and by making on their behalf a warm profession of loyalty and\r\ndevotion to their earthly king. As he concluded, Beza and his associates\r\nagain kneeled in prayer. Then rising, he presented anew to Charles the\r\nconfession of faith of the reformed churches, begging him to receive it\r\nas the basis of the present conference between their delegates and the\r\nRomish prelates.[1126]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Tournon tries to cut short the conference.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Beza had ended his speech, Cardinal Tournon, the oldest\r\nmember of the Papal consistory in France, and presiding officer in the\r\nconvocation of the prelates, rose, trembling with anger, and addressed\r\nthe king. It was only by express command of Charles, he said, that the\r\nprelates had consented to hear \"these new evangelists.\" They had\r\nhesitated from conscientious scruples, fearing, with good reason, as the\r\nevent had proved, that they would utter words unworthy of entering the\r\nears of a very Christian king, and calculated to offend the good people\r\naround him. It was for this reason that the ecclesiastical convocation\r\nhad instructed him, in such case, humbly to entreat his Majesty to give\r\nno credit to the words of him who had spoken for \"those of the new\r\nreligion,\" and to suspend his judgment until he had heard the answer\r\nthey intended to give. But for their respect for the king, he said, the\r\nprelates, on hearing the abominable blasphemies pronounced in their\r\nhearing, would have risen and broken off the colloquy. He prayed Charles\r\nwith the greatest humility to persevere in the faith of his fathers, and\r\ninvoked the Virgin Mary and the blessed saints of paradise that thus it\r\nmight be.[1127]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catharine's decision.]\r\n\r\nHow long the age-stricken cardinal, the active persecutor of an entire\r\ngeneration of reformers, would have proceeded in his diatribe against\r\nthe \"blasphemy\" of the Genevese doctor, is doubtful. He was cut short in\r\nthe midst of it by the queen mother, who, in a decided tone, informed\r\nhim that the plan of the conference had been adopted only after mature\r\ndeliberation, with the advice of the council of state and by consent of\r\nparliament. No change or innovation was contemplated, but the appeasing\r\nof the troubles incident upon diversity of religious sentiment, and the\r\nrestoration to the right path of such as had erred. The matter in hand\r\nwas to demonstrate the truth by means of the simple Word of God, which\r\nshould be the sole rule. \"We are here,\" she said, \"for the purpose of\r\nhearing you on both sides, and of considering the matter on its own\r\nmerits. Therefore, reply to the speech of Sieur de Bèze which you have\r\njust heard.\" \"The speech was too long for us to undertake to answer it\r\non the spur of the moment,\" responded Tournon, in a more tractable tone;\r\nbut he promised that, if a copy of it were given to them in writing, a\r\nsuitable refutation would soon be forthcoming on the part of the\r\nprelates.[1128] Thus the conference broke up for the day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages gained.]\r\n\r\nIt could not be denied that Beza had spoken with great effect. For the\r\nfirst time in forty years the Reformation had obtained a partial\r\nhearing. The time-honored fashion of condemning its professors without\r\neven the formality of a trial had for once been violated; and, to the\r\nsatisfaction of some and the dismay of many, it was found that the\r\narguments that could be alleged in its behalf were neither few nor\r\ninsignificant. The Huguenots had acquired a new position in the eyes of\r\nthe court; that was certain. They were not a few seditious persons, who\r\nmust be put down. They were not a handful of enthusiasts, whom it were\r\nfolly to attempt to reason with. The child had become a full-grown man,\r\nwhose prejudices--if prejudices they were--must be overcome by calm\r\nargument, rather than removed by chastisement.[1129] If the studied\r\narrangement of the bar at the Colloquy of Poissy had been employed by\r\nthe petty malice of their opponents in order to give them the aspect of\r\nconvicted culprits, public opinion, unbiassed by such solemn trifling,\r\nregarded the disputants as equals in the eye of the law, and attempted\r\nto derive from the bearing of the champions some impression concerning\r\nthe justice of their respective positions.\r\n\r\nThe change in the basis for the settlement of the controversy was not\r\nless apparent. For an entire generation the advocates of Protestantism\r\nhad been pressing the claims of the Holy Scriptures as the ultimate\r\nauthority for the decision of all doubtful questions. The only reply was\r\na reference to the dogmas of the Church, and the demand of an\r\nunconditional submission to them. Beza had only reiterated the offer,\r\nmade a thousand times by his fellow-reformers, to surrender at once his\r\nreligious position should it be rendered untenable by means of proofs\r\ndrawn from the Scriptures. Cardinal Tournon had again made the trite\r\nrejoinder of the clergy; but sensible persons were tired of the\r\nunsatisfactory repetition. Catharine had given expression to the\r\nperemptory requisition of all enlightened France when she announced the\r\nsole appeal as lying to the \"simple Word of God.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brilliant success of Beza.]\r\n\r\nFrom this exhibition of his brilliant oratorical powers, and from those\r\ndisplays that shortly followed, Theodore Beza acquired the highest\r\nreputation both with friend and foe. Even those who would have it that\r\n\"he deceived the people,\" that his acquirements were superficial, that\r\nhe lacked good judgment, and, on the whole, had \"a very hideous soul,\"\r\ncould not help admitting that he was of a fine presence, ready wit, and\r\nkeen intellect, and that his excellent choice of language and ready\r\nutterance entitled him to the credit of eloquence.[1130] On the other\r\nhand, nothing could exceed the admiration and love excited by his ardent\r\nespousal of their cause in the breasts of the Protestants in all parts\r\nof the kingdom. His appearance at Poissy became their favorite episode\r\nin recent history. His portrait was hung up in many a chamber. He was\r\nalmost adored by whole multitudes of Frenchmen,[1131] as one whom noble\r\nbirth, learning, and brilliant prospects had not deterred from following\r\nthe dictates of his conscientious convictions; whom security in a\r\nforeign land had not rendered indifferent to the interests of the land\r\nof his birth; whose persuasive eloquence had won new adherents to the\r\ncause of the oppressed from among the rich and noble; who had maintained\r\nthe truth unabashed in the presence of the king and \"of the most\r\nillustrious company on earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His frankness justified.]\r\n\r\nNor will the candid student of history, if he but consider the attitude\r\nof the prelates at the colloquy of Poissy, be more inclined than were\r\nthe Protestants of his own day to censure Theodore Beza for any degree\r\nof alleged injudiciousness exhibited in that celebrated sentence in his\r\nspeech which provoked the outburst of indignation on the part of Tournon\r\nand his colleagues. What, forsooth, had their reverences come to the\r\ncolloquy expecting to hear from the lips of the reformed orators? If not\r\nthe most orthodox of sentiments--more orthodox than many sentiments\r\nwhose proclamation had been tolerated in their own private\r\nconvocation--was there not a moderate allowance of hypocrisy in their\r\npretended horror at the impiety of the heretic Beza? For certainly it\r\nwas scarcely to be anticipated by the most sanguine that he would\r\nprofess an unwavering belief in the transmutation of the substance of\r\nthe bread and wine into the very body and blood of Jesus Christ that\r\nsuffered on the cross; seeing that for a little more than a third of a\r\ncentury those of whom he was the avowed representative had, it must be\r\nadmitted, pretty clearly testified to the contrary on a thousand\r\n\"estrapades\" from the _Place de Grève_ to the remotest corner of France.\r\nSurely this extreme sensitiveness, this refined orthodoxy, unable to\r\nendure the simple enunciation of an opinion differing from their own on\r\nthe part of an avowed opponent, savored a little of affectation; the\r\nmore so as it came from prelates whose solicitude for their flocks had\r\nbeen manifested more in the way of seeking to obtain as large a number\r\nof folds as possible, than in the way of giving any special pastoral\r\nsupervision to one, and who found a more congenial residence at the\r\ndissolute court where pleasures and preferment could best be obtained,\r\nthan in obscure dioceses where a rude peasantry were thirsting for\r\ninstruction in the first rudiments of a Christian education. The truth\r\nwas--and no one was so blind as not to see it--that the Romish prelates\r\nhad come determined to seize the first good opportunity to break up the\r\ncolloquy, because from the colloquy they had good reason to apprehend\r\nserious injury to their interests. Nothing short of a complete betrayal\r\nof his cause by Beza could have precluded this.[1132] Had he been never\r\nso cautious, he could not have avoided giving some handle to those who\r\nwere watching him so closely. Not the nature of the sentiment he\r\nexpressed, but the danger lest the prelates might take advantage of it\r\nto refuse peremptorily to proceed with the colloquy, was the true ground\r\nof Catharine's displeasure.[1133] In order to remove this, so far as it\r\nmight be based upon any misapprehension of the import of his words, Beza\r\naddressed to the queen, on the next day, a dignified but conciliatory\r\nletter of explanation.[1134]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The prelates' notion of a conference.]\r\n\r\nA full week elapsed before the Cardinal of Lorraine was ready to make\r\nhis reply. Meantime the prelates had met, and had resolved that, instead\r\nof embracing a discussion of the entire field of controversy between the\r\ntwo churches, the conference should be restricted to _two_ points--the\r\nnature of the church and the sacraments. It was even proposed that a\r\nformula of faith should be drawn up and submitted to the Protestant\r\nministers. If they refused to subscribe to it, they were to be formally\r\nexcommunicated, and the conference abruptly broken off. Such was the\r\ncrude notion of a colloquy conceived by the prelates. No discussion at\r\nall, if possible![1135] Otherwise only on those points where agreement\r\nwas most difficult, and it was easiest to excite the _odium theologicum_\r\nof the by-standers. On the other hand, when this came to the ears of the\r\nProtestants, they felt constrained to draw up another solemn protest to\r\nthe king against the folly of making the prelates judges in a suit in\r\nwhich they appeared also as one of the parties--a course so impolitic\r\nthat it would rob the colloquy of all the good effects that had been\r\nexpected to flow from it.[1136]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: September 16th.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peter Martyr arrives.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cardinal of Lorraine's reply.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenots to wait for their faith to grow old.]\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance was not without its effect. On the next day, the\r\nsixteenth of September, the same assemblage was again gathered in the\r\nconventual refectory of Poissy, to hear the reply of the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine. The reformers appeared as on the previous occasion; but their\r\nranks had received a notable accession in the venerable Peter Martyr,\r\njust arrived from Zurich. The prelates had, it is true, objected to the\r\nadmission of a native of Italy; for the invitation, it was urged, had\r\nbeen extended only to Frenchmen. But the queen, who had greeted her\r\ndistinguished countryman with flattering marks of attention, interfered\r\nin his behalf, and, at the last moment, announced it to be her desire\r\nthat he should appear at the colloquy.[1137] The same trickery that had\r\nbrought Beza to the bar, in order to give him the appearance of a\r\ncriminal put upon trial, rather than that of the representative of a\r\nreligious party claiming to possess the unadulterated truth, assigned\r\nCharles of Lorraine a pulpit among his brother prelates, where, with a\r\ntheologian more proficient in theological controversy at his elbow, he\r\ncould assume the air of a judge giving his final sentence respecting the\r\nmatters in dispute.[1138] His long exordium was devoted to a\r\nconsideration of the royal and the sacerdotal authority, each of which\r\nhe in turn extolled. Then passing to the particular occasion of the\r\nconvocation of so goodly a number of archbishops, bishops, and\r\ntheologians--to all of whom he professed himself inferior in\r\nintelligence, knowledge, and eloquence--he expressed most sincere pity\r\nfor the persons who a week ago had, by the king's command, been\r\nintroduced into this assembly--persons long separated from the prelates\r\nby a discordant profession of faith and by insubordination, but showing,\r\naccording to their own assertions, some desire to be instructed by\r\nreturning to this their native land and to the house of their fathers,\r\nwho stood ready to receive and embrace them as children so soon as they\r\nshould recognize the Church's authority. He would utter no reproaches,\r\nbut compassionate their infirmity. He would recall, not reject; unite,\r\nnot separate. The prelates had gladly heard the confession of faith the\r\nHuguenots had made, and heartily wished that, as they agreed in the\r\nwords of that document, so they might also agree in the interpretation\r\nof its articles. Dismissing the consideration of the remaining points,\r\nas requiring more time than could be given on a single day, the cardinal\r\nundertook to prove only two positions, viz.: that the Church is not an\r\ninvisible, but a visible organization, and that the Lord Jesus Christ is\r\nreally and bodily present in the Holy Supper. He then called upon the\r\nreformed ministers, if, in their views respecting the eucharist, they\r\ncould accord neither with the Latin Church, nor with the Greek, nor with\r\nthe Lutherans of Germany, at least to seek that solitude for which they\r\nseemed to long. \"If you have so little desire to approach our faith and\r\nour practice,\" he said, \"go also farther from us, and disturb no longer\r\nthe flocks over which you have no legitimate charge, according to the\r\nauthority which we have of God; and, allowing your new opinions, if God\r\npermit, to grow as old as our doctrine and traditions have grown, you\r\nwill restore peace to many troubled consciences and leave your native\r\nland at rest.\" He urged Charles to cling steadfastly to the faith of his\r\nancestors, of whom none had gone astray, and who had transmitted to him\r\nthe proud title of \"Very Christian\" and of \"First Son of the Church.\" He\r\nexhorted the queen mother and his other noble hearers to emulate the\r\nglorious examples set for their imitation by Clotilde, who brought\r\nClovis to the Christian religion, and by their own illustrious ancestry;\r\nand he concluded by declaring the unalterable determination of the\r\necclesiastics of the Gallican Church never to forsake the holy, true,\r\nand Catholic doctrine which they preached, and to sustain which they\r\nwould not spare their blood nor their very lives.[1139]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tournon's new demand.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza asks a hearing.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of the speech of Charles of Lorraine, so long\r\nheralded by his brother ecclesiastics and by the devout Roman Catholics\r\nof the land as the sure refutation of all the heresies which the\r\nreformers might advance. It was fitting that some signal proof of its\r\nsuccess should be given. Scarcely had Lorraine ceased when the whole\r\nbody of prelates arose and gathered around the throne. Tournon was again\r\ntheir spokesman. He declared the full approval with which the Gallican\r\nbishops regarded the address of the Cardinal of Lorraine. They were\r\nready, if need be, to sign it with their own blood, for it was in\r\naccordance with the will of Christ and of his bride, our Mother Holy\r\nChurch. They begged Charles to give it full credit, and persevere in the\r\nCatholic faith of his fathers. Let the Protestants sign what the\r\ncardinal had said, as a preliminary to their receiving further\r\ninstruction. If they refused, let Charles purge his very Christian realm\r\nof them, so that there might be only \"_une foy_, _une loy_, _un\r\nroy_.\"[1140] He was followed at once by Theodore Beza, who, on the\r\ncontrary, urged his Majesty to grant him the liberty of replying on the\r\nvery spot to the arguments of his opponent. But Catharine, after a brief\r\nconsultation with the members of the royal council seated near her,\r\ndenied the request, and adjourned the discussion until another\r\noccasion.[1141]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advancing shadows of civil war.]\r\n\r\nThe opportunity thus promised, however, seemed distant and doubtful. The\r\ndetermination of the prelates to have nothing to do with any project for\r\na fair and equal conference was undisguised, and rumors were frequent\r\nand ominous that the queen would yield before their resolute attitude.\r\nThe decision of the reformers, under these circumstances, was soon\r\ntaken: it was, that, if these repeated delays were persisted in, they\r\nwould leave the court, protesting against the injustice which had been\r\nmanifested to them and to their cause.[1142] Yet their anxiety was\r\ngreat. That dark cloud of portentous aspect could be descried by all\r\nsharp-sighted observers. It was the approaching storm of civil war,\r\nevery moment rising higher above the horizon.[1143] Even now its advent\r\nwas heralded by the anarchy pervading entire provinces--a righteous\r\nretribution for the sanguinary legislation and the yet more barbarous\r\nexecutions ordered by the courts of law, to repress the free action of\r\nthe human intellect in the most noble sphere in which its energies could\r\nbe exercised--the region of religious thought.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another conference reluctantly conceded, September 24th.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's reply to the Cardinal of Lorraine.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claude D'Espense.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claude de Sainctes.]\r\n\r\nAnother tedious week passed by. Again, in view of the threats of an\r\nabrupt termination of the colloquy, the Huguenot ministers petitioned\r\nCharles to give them a patient hearing; reminding him of the distance\r\nthey had come--some of their number even from foreign lands, relying on\r\nhis royal word for a friendly interview with the prelates of his\r\nkingdom--in order to exhibit the inveterate abuses which the Pope and\r\nhis agents had introduced into the Church. Other remonstrances of like\r\ntenor followed.[1144] At last, with great reluctance,[1145] the\r\ntwenty-fourth of September was selected for a third conference. The\r\nobstinate resistance of the Romish ecclesiastics gained them one point.\r\nThe public character of the colloquy was abandoned.[1146] The large\r\nrefectory was exchanged for the small chamber of the prioress. The king\r\nwas not present. Catharine presided, and Antoine and Jeanne d'Albret,\r\nwith the members of the royal council, replaced the more numerous\r\nassemblage of the previous occasions. Instead of the crowd of prelates\r\nwhose various and striking dress formed a notable feature of the\r\ncolloquy, there appeared five or six cardinals, about as many bishops,\r\nand fifteen or sixteen theologians of the Sorbonne, laden with thick\r\nfolios--the writings of the Fathers of the first five centuries, with\r\nwhich the Cardinal of Lorraine still professed his ability to confute\r\nthe Reformed.[1147] Again the twelve Huguenot ministers were admitted;\r\nbut the lay deputies of the churches were excluded.[1148] The\r\ndiscussion was long and desultory. Beza began by replying to the first\r\npart of the cardinal's speech, and showed that there is an invisible as\r\nwell as a visible church, and that the marks of the true church are the\r\npreaching of God's Word and the right administration of the sacraments.\r\nNot a succession of ministry from the apostles, but a succession of\r\ndoctrine is essential.[1149] He was followed by a theologian of the\r\nSorbonne, Claude D'Espense, who, after making the gratuitous admission\r\nthat he wholly disapproved of the persecutions to which the Protestants\r\nhad been subjected,[1150] attempted to prove that the Protestant\r\nministers had no \"calling\" to their office, and that recourse must be\r\nhad to tradition to explain and supplement the Holy Scriptures. When\r\nBeza was about to reply, the floor was seized by a coarse Dominican\r\nfriar, one Claude de Sainctes, who in a scurrilous speech went over much\r\nof the same ground, and, waxing more and more vehement, did not hesitate\r\nto assert that tradition stood on a firmer foundation than the Bible\r\nitself, which could be perverted to countenance the most opposite\r\ndoctrines.[1151] An hour and a half of precious time was wasted by this\r\nunseasonable interruption, which had disgusted friend as well as foe.\r\nThen Beza, after remonstrating against the long and irregular character\r\nof the discussion, proceeded, amid frequent interruptions, to set forth\r\nthe views of the reformers respecting the extraordinary vocation which\r\nthey had received.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lorraine demands subscription to the Augsburg Confession.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza's home thrust.]\r\n\r\nBut this portion of the debate was soon closed by the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, who, declaring that the doctrine respecting the Church had\r\nbeen sufficiently considered, proposed the question of the sacraments,\r\nasserting that the prelates refused to proceed with the conference until\r\nthis should be settled. He then demanded of the ministers _whether they\r\nwould subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, which was received by the\r\nProtestants of Germany_. His object was manifest. He had long since\r\nresolved on adopting this course, with the view of either setting the\r\nFrench reformers at war with their brethren beyond the Rhine, or sowing\r\ndissension in the ranks of the Huguenots themselves. Beza, however, was\r\nnot unprepared for the question. He replied by asking whether the\r\ncardinal was himself ready to give the Augsburg Confession his\r\nunqualified approval. The wily prelate parried this home thrust, and\r\nstill persisted in his inquiry. Under these circumstances, could the\r\nreformers have relied upon the fairness of the conduct of the\r\nconference, their course would have been clear. But, aware that their\r\ndistinct refusal to consider a formula which their opponents were not\r\nthemselves prepared to adopt would be seized upon as a welcome pretext\r\nfor abruptly breaking off the colloquy, Beza, after declaring that he\r\nand his brethren were deputed by the French churches to maintain their\r\nown confession, and that this document alone furnished the proper\r\nsubject for debate, asked that a copy of the articles which they were\r\nrequired to sign might be furnished him for the deliberation of his\r\nfellow-ministers. The request was granted; and, as the session ended, a\r\nshort extract was handed to him, which asserted the real presence of\r\nChrist's body and blood in the sacrament, and its actual reception by\r\nthose who partook of the holy ordinance.[1152]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alternatives presented to the Huguenots.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: September 26th.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza claims fair play]\r\n\r\nTwo days later the colloquy was renewed. The delay, which had at first\r\nbeen a source of annoyance to the ministers, was now recognized by them\r\nas a providential interference in their behalf. What they had only\r\nsurmised, they now learned with certainty from trustworthy friends.\r\nTheir _hesitation_ to sign the Augsburg Confession was to be used as a\r\nconvenient handle for breaking up the conference; their _refusal_, for\r\ninvolving them in a quarrel with Protestant Germany; their _consent_,\r\nfor causing their expulsion from the churches they had betrayed, or\r\nsplitting those churches up into many parts.[1153] Theodore Beza opened\r\nthe discussion by reading the reply which he had carefully prepared by\r\ncommon consent of all his brethren. Never had his oratorical skill been\r\nexhibited to better advantage. He began by showing the evident\r\nimpropriety of introducing, as his opponents had done in the last\r\nconference, a discussion of the validity of the divine vocation of the\r\nProtestant ministers; for they had come here to confer, not to\r\n_officiate_--much less to witness the institution of the semblance of a\r\npenal prosecution against them. The objectionable character of such a\r\ndebate would be the more manifest, should he address any supposed bishop\r\nwith whom he was disputing and who had inquired: \"By what authority do\r\nyou preach and administer the sacraments?\" and retort by asking him in\r\nturn: \"Were you elected by the elders of the church of which you are\r\nbishop? Did the people seek for you? Were inquiries first made\r\nrespecting your life, your morals, and your belief?\" or, \"Who ordained\r\nyou? How much did you pay him?\" The answers to such questions would make\r\nmany a bishop blush. Beza next reminded the cardinal of his promise to\r\nconfute the Protestants by the testimony of the Fathers of the first\r\nfive centuries. For a discussion based upon them the ministers had come\r\nprepared. But now he brought them a single article on the Lord's Supper,\r\nand imperiously said: \"Sign this, or we will proceed no farther!\" Even\r\nwere the Huguenots prisoners brought before him for trial, they would\r\nnot be so treated. Their very office required the prelates to speak\r\ndifferently, for the bishop must be \"able by sound doctrine both to\r\nexhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and an amicable conference.]\r\n\r\nThen turning to the queen mother, Beza reminded her that he and his\r\ncompanions were there, not only for the purpose of submitting a\r\nconfession of their faith, but to serve God, Charles, and herself, by\r\nlaboring in all possible ways to appease the troubles that had arisen in\r\nconnection with religion. To dismiss them without giving them an\r\nopportunity for an amicable conference would not be the means of\r\nallaying the prevailing disturbances; and those who proposed to do so\r\nknew it well. Were the handful of Protestants at Poissy the only persons\r\nconcerned, there might, in the world's eye, be little likelihood that\r\ndanger would result from treating them as their enemies desired. But it\r\nmight please her Majesty to consider that they were here in behalf of a\r\nmillion persons in this realm, in Switzerland, Poland, Germany, England,\r\nand Scotland, who watched the proceedings of the colloquy, and who would\r\nbe astonished to hear, as they would hear, that, instead of such a\r\nconference as had been promised, the ministers had received the tenth\r\npart of an article, and had been told: \"Sign this; otherwise we will\r\nproceed no farther.\" What would be gained if the Protestants did sign\r\nit; for, did the prelates agree in the Augsburg Confession? If there was\r\na real desire to confer, let persons be appointed who were willing to\r\nmeet the Protestants, and let them examine together the Holy Scriptures\r\nand the old Fathers of the Christian Church, with the books before them,\r\nand let secretaries write out the results of the discussion in an\r\nauthentic form. Then it would be known that the ministers had not come\r\nto sow troubles, but to promote accord.[1154]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lorraine's anger.]\r\n\r\nThe prelates were much excited when Beza concluded. His reference to\r\nepiscopal elections stung them to the quick. Lorraine angrily accused\r\nhim of insulting not only the _sacerdotal_, but the _royal_ authority,\r\nsince it was Francis the First that had taken away the election of the\r\npriesthood from the people.[1155] Beza, replying, said that this very\r\nact was an evidence of the radical disturbance of the ancient order,\r\nwhen avarice, ambition, and unworthy rivalry between monks and canons\r\nrendered such a change necessary. Pressed again to sign the article\r\nsubmitted two days before, Beza persisted that it was unjust to endeavor\r\nto compel the Protestants to subscribe to that to which the prelates\r\nrefused their own indorsement.[1156]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peter Martyr and Lainez the Jesuit.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion was next carried on between the doctors of the Sorbonne\r\nand Beza and Martyr. The latter spoke in Italian,[1157] and won\r\nuniversal applause; but he was rudely interrupted by the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, who said that he did not want to hear a foreign language. A\r\nlittle later, a Spaniard, Lainez, the second general of the rising order\r\nof Jesus, who had just reached Paris in the train of the Cardinal Legate\r\nof Ferrara, begged permission to speak. Leave was granted him, and he\r\nindulged in an address much more remarkable for its coarse invective\r\nthan for its weight of argument.[1158] Not content with dissuading his\r\nhearers from listening to the Protestant ministers as persons already\r\nsufficiently convicted of error, he called them apes and foxes,[1159]\r\nand advised that they be sent to Trent, where the Pope had convoked a\r\nfree council to which they might have free access. He condemned the\r\nFrench for holding a separate council, and reprobated the discussion of\r\ntopics of such importance as those now under consideration in the\r\npresence of women, and of men trained to war. After these gentle hints\r\nrespecting the qualifications of the queen and his noble auditors to act\r\nas judges, he approached the all-absorbing question of the real\r\npresence--a feeble part of his speech in which we may be excused from\r\nfollowing him. The remainder of the day was spent in warm debate, which\r\ncontinued until the approach of night. Just as all were rising and about\r\nto leave, however, the queen called to her Beza and the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, and adjured them in God's name to strive for the establishment\r\nof peace. A knot of friends gathered around each; the conference was\r\nrenewed amid much confusion and noise; but the darkness soon\r\nnecessitated an adjournment.[1160]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Close of the Colloquy of Poissy.]\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of the Colloquy of Poissy. If anything more had\r\nuntil now been needed to demonstrate the futility of all hopes based\r\nupon an open discussion regulated solely by the caprice of the Cardinal\r\nof Lorraine, it was certainly furnished by the experience of the last\r\nsession. Catharine, however, was loth to abandon the scheme from which\r\nshe had expected such important results to flow. With her usual\r\nincapacity to understand the strength of religious convictions deeply\r\nimplanted in the soul, she still hoped to secure, from a private\r\ninterview of the more moderate Roman Catholics with a few of the leading\r\nProtestants, a plan of agreement that might serve to unite both\r\ncommunions. Some of her more conscientious advisers shared in the same\r\nsanguine expectations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A private conference.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman Catholic champions.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Abbé de Salignac.]\r\n\r\nFive Roman Catholic ecclesiastics were chosen to confer with as many\r\nProtestant ministers. They were selected as well for learning and\r\nability as for reputed moderation of sentiment.[1161] The Bishops\r\nMontluc of Valence, and Du Val of Séez in Normandy, the Abbé's de\r\nSalignac and Bouteiller, and D'Espense, doctor in the Sorbonne, were\r\nprobably all believed to be half inclined to fall in with the\r\nreformatory current. Of Montluc and D'Espense, mention has already more\r\nthan once been made. Bouteiller, it will be remembered, was the priest\r\nwho had officiated in the Cardinal of Châtillon's episcopal palace at\r\nBeauvais, the last Easter preceding, when the communion was administered\r\nunder both kinds, \"after the fashion of Geneva.\"[1162] Salignac was a\r\ntimid man, a fair sample of the \"Nicodemites,\" who had proved the bane\r\nof the Reformation in France. For thirty years he had held, and to some\r\nextent--if we may credit his own words--professed the same doctrines as\r\nCalvin, continually exhorting his hearers to turn from an empty, formal\r\nworship, to Christ as the only Saviour. Confessedly he had not rejected\r\n\"_that false doctrine_\"--for thus he did not hesitate, in his private\r\ncorrespondence with a Protestant, to designate the Romish creed--so\r\nopenly as the reformers were wont to do; but he claimed to have won the\r\nuniversal approval of the best men around him by his attacks upon\r\n\"Babylon,\" which he had approached sometimes \"by mines,\" sometimes \"in\r\nopen warfare,\" according to time and circumstances.[1163] Since no\r\nviolent opposition seems ever to have been made, no persecution ever to\r\nhave arisen against Salignac, and in view of the fact that the conflict\r\nof the last thirty years had been sufficiently sanguinary and little\r\ncalculated to reassure timid combatants, it is highly probable that the\r\nprudent abbé's subterranean operations greatly outnumbered his more\r\nvaliant exploits. Well might the reformers, who knew that victory was to\r\nbe obtained, not by burrowing under the ground, but by facing the perils\r\nof the battle-field, exclaim:\r\n\r\n    Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis\r\n    Tempus eget.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conference at St. Germain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A discussion of words.]\r\n\r\nTheodore Beza, Peter Martyr, Angustin Marlorat, Jean de L'Espine, and\r\nNicholas des Gallars, were appointed to represent the Protestants, and\r\nit was arranged that secretaries should be present at the conferences to\r\nnote the progress made toward unity. The ten theologians met in the\r\napartments of the King of Navarre, at St. Germain. Their conclusions\r\nwere to be submitted to the Protestant ministers and delegates present\r\nat the court, and at the same time carried to Poissy for ratification by\r\nthe still assembled prelates. Both parties were in earnest in seeking\r\nfor common ground on which they might stand. Compelled by the\r\ninstructions the bishops had received, to commence with the knotty\r\nquestion of the eucharist instead of adopting the more natural order of\r\nthe articles of the confession of faith, the Romish party inquired\r\nwhether, abandoning discussion for the time, both sides might not agree\r\non the formula which had been drawn up and approved by four of their\r\nnumber on the twenty-fifth of September, or on some similarly moderate\r\nstatement. The question, so far as the formula they referred to was\r\nconcerned, was promptly answered by Peter Martyr. The Zurich reformer,\r\nsomewhat apprehensive, as he had lately shown, lest his colleagues\r\nshould, in their eagerness for accord, make something approaching a\r\nsacrifice of doctrine, greatly to their surprise drew from his pocket a\r\npaper which he proceeded to read: \"I reply, for my part, that the body\r\nof Christ is truly and substantially nowhere else than in heaven. I do\r\nnot, however, deny that Christ's true body and his true blood, which\r\nwere given on the cross for the salvation of men, are by faith and\r\nspiritually received by the believing in the Holy Supper.\"[1164] A\r\nfriendly but laborious discussion, not of ideas nor of doctrines, but of\r\nwords, ensued. At length a statement was drawn up sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive, yet sufficiently general to admit of being approved in\r\ngood conscience by the entire number of theologians.[1165] But the\r\nprelates of Poissy promptly rejecting the article, the next day it was\r\nnecessary to renew the deliberation. A second form of agreement was\r\ndrafted,[1166] which the Roman Catholic deputies felt confident would\r\nmeet with the approval of those who had sent them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Premature delight of the queen mother.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The article rejected by the prelates.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their demand.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the article itself was to be kept secret until submitted to the\r\nprelates, the tidings that a harmonious result had been reached rapidly\r\nflew through the court and was carried to Catharine herself. Beza and\r\nMontluc were summoned into her presence. In the excess of her joy at the\r\nprospect of the peaceful solution of a difficult problem, and of an\r\nissue of the colloquy which would greatly conduce to her glory and the\r\nfirmer establishment of her rule, Catharine even cordially embraced the\r\nreformer, and bade him go on in the good way he and his companions had\r\nentered. Beza, not blind to the difficulties that still beset their\r\npath, replied that their highest desires were for truth and peace, but\r\nthat a good beginning only had been made.[1167] The Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, after reading the article, expressed the belief that the\r\nprelates of Poissy would be pleased,[1168] and for his own part seemed\r\nto regard the Protestants as having surrendered the entire ground of\r\ncontroversy to the Roman Catholics.[1169] But both queen and cardinal\r\nwere soon undeceived. The assembled prelates rejected the modified\r\narticle with scorn, treating with insult the deputies that brought it,\r\nas having betrayed their cause and played into the hands of the\r\nreformers.[1170] Under these circumstances a continuation of the\r\nconference would have been absurd. The Roman Catholic deputies,\r\ndespairing of any good fruits from their efforts at conciliation, never\r\nreturned; and the last vestige of the colloquy, on which such brilliant\r\nanticipations had been based, vanished into thin air.[1171] The prelates\r\nthemselves continued to sit for a few days. A committee of three bishops\r\nand sundry doctors of the Sorbonne, to whom the article agreed upon by\r\nthe Roman Catholic and Huguenot delegates was submitted for examination,\r\npronounced it (on the sixth of October) to be incomplete, dangerous, and\r\nheretical. Three days later the prelates published a formal condemnation\r\nof it, offered a definition which they declared to be orthodox, and\r\ncalled upon the king to require Beza and his companions either to sign\r\nthis new formula, or to consult the public peace by leaving France\r\naltogether. A long series of canons, in which the question of church\r\ndiscipline was touched lightly, and that of doctrine not at all--the\r\npaltry result of more than two months of sufficiently animated,[1172] if\r\nnot very harmonious discussion--was at the same time given to the\r\nworld.[1173]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catharine's financial success.]\r\n\r\nFrom a political point of view, the assembly of the prelates at Poissy\r\nhad not been unprofitable to the government. Alarmed by the radical\r\nprojects of the wholesale confiscation of ecclesiastical property which\r\nhad found no little favor with the other orders at Pontoise, equally\r\nalarmed by the possibility of being compelled to enter into a full and\r\nfair discussion with the champions of the Protestant doctrines, the\r\nwealthy dignitaries of the Gallican Church brought themselves, not\r\nwithout a severe struggle, to purchase exemption from these perils by a\r\npecuniary concession which delighted the perplexed financiers of France.\r\nThey pledged themselves to pay, by semi-annual instalments, the entire\r\nsum needed for the redemption of the royal domain which had been\r\nalienated to satisfy the public creditors.[1174] But in return they\r\ndemanded important equivalents. The first item was that the severe\r\n\"Edict of July\" should be made perpetual and irrevocable. This request\r\nCatharine and the council denied. To declare that odious law, which it\r\nhad never been possible to carry into execution in several provinces of\r\nFrance, a part of the fundamental constitution, would be a gratuitous\r\ninsult to the Huguenots, and would precipitate the country instantly\r\ninto the abyss upon the verge of which it was already hanging.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order for the restitution of the churches.]\r\n\r\nThe other demands of the bishops it seemed more practicable to grant.\r\nThey required that Charles should by solemn edict order the\r\ninstantaneous restitution of the churches seized by the Huguenots. In\r\nspite of the earnest protest of Beza,[1175] the government (on the\r\neighteenth of October) complied with the request.[1176] Within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the receipt of this edict, all persons who had\r\ntaken possession of churches were commanded, on penalty of death as\r\nrebels and felons, to vacate them, restoring whatever valuables they had\r\nremoved, and replacing the images and crosses they had destroyed. At the\r\nsame time the prohibition of the use of insulting language and acts was\r\nrenewed, and both parties were bidden to place their arms in the hands\r\nof the local magistrates.[1177] Thus, to use Beza's language, was Christ\r\nbetrayed, but at a much dearer price than that for which he was,\r\ncenturies ago, sold by Judas--for sixteen millions of francs instead of\r\nthe thirty pieces of silver.[1178] Having, by extorting the Edict of\r\nRestitution, succeeded in paving the way for renewed commotions, soon to\r\nculminate in open and widespread war, the prelates adjourned, with\r\nmingled satisfaction and disgust, toward the end of October, 1561.[1179]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of five German delegates.]\r\n\r\nThe conference of Poissy had scarcely been definitely abandoned when\r\nfive German Protestants appeared upon the scene. Three of these--Andreä,\r\nBeuerlin, and Balthasar Bidembach--had been sent by the Duke of\r\nWürtemberg; the others--Bouquin and Dilher--by the Elector Palatine.\r\nEarly in the summer, the King of Navarre, anxious to strengthen himself\r\nby enlisting in his favor the Protestant princes of Germany, had\r\nexpressed to them the desire, in which Catharine coincided, that some\r\ntheologians--learned and pious men, and inclined to peace--should be\r\nsent from beyond the Rhine to take part in the adjustment of the\r\nreligious questions at the Colloquy of Poissy. The Protestant electors,\r\nthe Landgrave of Hesse, and the Duke of Würtemberg, were unable,\r\nhowever, to agree on the instructions to be given to the envoys. While\r\nthe duke, devotedly attached to the doctrines of Luther, was bent upon\r\nstrongly recommending the adoption of the Augsburg Confession, the other\r\nprinces could not acquiesce in his plan. The landgrave refused to throw\r\nadditional difficulties in the way of the reformed churches of France,\r\njust emerging from a period of relentless persecution, and seeking for\r\nthe public recognition of the right to worship God, for which so many\r\nmartyrs had cheerfully laid down their lives. The Elector of Saxony\r\ndistrusted the sincerity of the intentions of the French court. As for\r\nthe Count Palatine, he himself had embraced the reformed theology, and\r\ncould not be expected to urge the Huguenots to give up their own\r\nwell-digested confession for one which they considered far inferior to\r\nit in all respects.[1180] And so it happened that, in consequence of a\r\ndiversity of sentiment regarding both doctrine and policy, there was no\r\ngeneral deputation sent to France, and the delegates of the two princes\r\nwho complied with the invitation arrived at Paris after the\r\ncolloquy--too late to do any harm, if not soon enough to do much good.\r\nThey were courteously received by the court. The Würtembergers, in\r\nparticular, were allowed frequent opportunities of explaining the merits\r\nof the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Before their return into\r\nGermany, they were distinctly informed by Navarre that, while he\r\nrecommended a closer union between the two branches of the Protestant\r\nChurch, his own views accorded with those of the adherents of the\r\nAugsburg Confession; and that his only reason for delaying to subscribe\r\nto it was a fear lest this step might interfere with the execution of\r\nthe union he desired to effect.[1181]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the colloquy proved a failure.]\r\n\r\nThe Colloquy of Poissy had proved, so far as the objects contemplated by\r\nits originators were concerned, a complete failure. Instead of drawing\r\nthe Roman Catholic and the reformed churches together, it had only\r\nwidened the breach separating them. Instead of exhibiting in a clearer\r\nlight the common ground on which a union might be practicable, it had\r\nrendered patent to all the antagonism which could not be cloaked by\r\nambiguous phrases and incomplete statements of doctrine. It is certainly\r\nworth while to inquire into some of the causes of a result so unexpected\r\nto a great number of intelligent men, who had framed their anticipations\r\nupon no superficial view of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catharine's crude notion of a conference.]\r\n\r\nThe crude notions of the court respecting the character which such a\r\nconference ought to assume must be regarded as one of these causes.\r\nCatharine, while extending the most gracious invitations to foreign\r\nProtestants, was herself apparently undecided how to treat the Huguenots\r\nwhen they should make their appearance. Even if we grant that her\r\nexplanations of the object of the projected colloquy, referred to on a\r\npreceding page,[1182] received their coloring from the fact that she was\r\nsupplying her ambassador in Germany with plausible representations\r\nwherewith to appease such irritated bigots as feared that the French\r\nqueen intended to propose a grave discussion of the religious question\r\nupon its own merits, yet the entire course of the conference exhibits\r\nher inability to comprehend the nature of a fair debate of the matters\r\nin dispute. The Huguenot ministers and delegates were obliged to\r\npetition that the prelates should not be permitted to act as their\r\njudges, and afterward to remind her of the promise she had given them to\r\nthis effect. Even after the point had been nominally accorded, the most\r\nimportant questions respecting the conference were decided in the\r\ncouncil, where _five_ cardinals and _three_ bishops had seats.[1183]\r\nUnder these circumstances it is not astonishing that Lorraine assumed a\r\ntone of superiority which his relation to the debate by no means\r\nwarranted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the prelates.]\r\n\r\nBesides this, the character of the assembly of prelates itself precluded\r\nthe possibility of an adjustment. With the exception of six or seven, so\r\ninsignificant were these ecclesiastical dignitaries individually, that,\r\nas a modern historian has well remarked, not one distinguished himself\r\nsufficiently to be named by any of the writers who treat of the\r\nconference. They were, generally, the younger sons of the most\r\ndistinguished families in France, and had entered the church not from\r\ndevotion, but in consequence of an immemorial custom which consigned to\r\nthe episcopal dignity or to a rich abbacy the youth whom an elder\r\nbrother debarred from entertaining the hope of succeeding to his\r\nfather's dignities and possessions. Few of them had ever seen their\r\ndioceses save on some great festival; none possessed the literary or\r\ntheological training necessary to qualify them for coping with the\r\nmaster-minds among the Protestants. Accordingly, each bishop had to come\r\nto Poissy with one or more \"theologians,\" doctors of the Sorbonne, to\r\nwhose better judgment and superior learning he was content to defer on\r\nevery disputed point. There was little probability that a body thus\r\nconstituted would consent to enter into a candid consideration of the\r\ndifferences separating the Roman Catholic and Protestant worlds.[1184]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the papal legate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The despondent nuncio, Viterbo.]\r\n\r\nBut the single event said by an eye-witness and actor in these scenes\r\nto have conduced more than any other to destroy all hope of agreement,\r\nwas the arrival at court of the papal legate, Ippolito D'Este, Cardinal\r\nof Ferrara.[1185] Pope Pius IV. had long been watching the affairs of\r\nFrance with deep solicitude. If his legates, Tournon and Lorraine, had\r\nfailed to alarm him by their reports of the progress of the \"new\r\ndoctrines,\" he could not but be troubled by the accounts which came from\r\nhis nuncio in France, Sebastiano Gualtieri, Bishop of Viterbo.\r\nGualtieri, an experienced diplomatist, learned, eloquent--and not\r\nwanting in cunning,[1186] if we may believe his successor in office--had\r\nproved himself unequal to the duties of his present position, by giving\r\nway to extreme despondency. In the gay capital of France he led a\r\nwretched life, in constant dread of future disaster, and ceaselessly\r\nuttering lugubrious prognostications. To the Pope he announced that\r\nreligious matters in France were desperate; everything was rushing to\r\nruin with ever-increasing velocity. The queen mother was unsound in the\r\nfaith, although, from motives of policy, she dissembled her true\r\nsentiments. She favored a preacher, one Bouteiller, who was equally\r\nunsound; and she refused to dismiss him when admonished of her error. He\r\nbegged the pontiff to recall him, so that he might not witness the\r\nfuneral obsequies of the unhappy kingdom.[1187]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anxiety of Pope Pius IV.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nuncio Santa Croce.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cardinal of Ferrara.]\r\n\r\nPius, rendered more apprehensive by these continual tidings of evil, and\r\ndispleased with much that his legates had done,[1188] could no longer\r\ndelay to take decided action. Accordingly, he resolved to grant\r\nGualtieri's request, and to send as apostolic nuncio in his place Santa\r\nCroce, Bishop of Pisa, who had formerly occupied this position at\r\nParis, but was now acting in a similar capacity in Portugal.[1189] But\r\nso grave did the conjuncture appear in the eyes of the papal court,\r\nthat, at a solemn consistory held on the twenty-eighth of June, the\r\nresolution was adopted to despatch a _third_ legate to St. Germain! The\r\npretext of this extraordinary mission was the desire to testify more\r\nclearly than the selection of the two previously existing legates had\r\ndone, to the earnestness of the solicitude felt at Rome for the\r\ninterests of the Church in France.[1190] The true reason would appear to\r\nhave been to correct the mistakes which the existing legates were\r\nsupposed to have committed. For the delicate post of _legatus a latere_,\r\nno better candidate could be found than the Cardinal of Ferrara.\r\nAlthough a man of no high intellectual abilities, he had received a\r\nthorough training in the Macchiavellian theory of politics,[1191] and,\r\nduring many years of diplomatic service, had enjoyed a fair opportunity\r\nfor schooling himself in its practical workings. The son of Lucretia\r\nBorgia, the grandson of Pope Alexander the Sixth, could scarcely help\r\nbeing an adept at intrigue. Next to this special qualification, his\r\nhighest recommendations were that he was the brother-in-law of Renée of\r\nFrance, and so by marriage uncle of the Duke of Guise; and that he had\r\ntwelve good reasons for feeling deep concern for the steadfastness of\r\nFrench orthodoxy, viz.: the three archbishoprics, the one bishopric, and\r\nthe eight rich abbeys which he held within the confines of Charles's\r\ndominions, deriving therefrom an income which was popularly estimated at\r\nfrom forty to sixty thousand crowns.[1192]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Master Renard turned monk.]\r\n\r\nThe new legate accepted the appointment with alacrity. Not so the\r\nnuncio. It was no small trial to leave the quiet court of Lisbon--where\r\nhis predecessors had been accustomed, during a short stay of a year or\r\ntwo, to accumulate a handsome fortune[1193]--for the turmoil of the\r\nFrench capital, threatened every day with the outbreak of civil war,\r\nwhere nothing but censure and hatred could be reaped.[1194] But Santa\r\nCroce did not hesitate long to renounce his golden prospects, and almost\r\nat the same moment that the Cardinal of Ferrara started from the banks\r\nof the Tiber, the Bishop of Pisa set forth from the gates of Lisbon.\r\nNeither legate nor nuncio, however, was in much haste to reach his\r\ndestination. Ferrara could plead ill-health, Santa Croce the prostrating\r\nheat of the season.[1195] It took each of the prelates two months and a\r\nhalf to accomplish his journey--the legate reaching the French court on\r\nthe nineteenth of September, the nuncio toward the end of the same\r\nmonth.[1196] The former travelled in great magnificence, with a\r\nbrilliant escort of four hundred horsemen or more, and accompanied by\r\nseveral bishops and other persons of distinction, among whom was Lainez,\r\nthe Jesuit, whose acquaintance we have already made. Avoiding the larger\r\nFrench cities where the Reformation had gained a foothold, and where,\r\nconsequently, marks of popular insult were apprehended,[1197] he\r\nreceived a brilliant welcome at the court, the king's brother Henry, and\r\nothers, riding out to greet him at his approach. The _people_ were less\r\ncordial. His assumed devotion could not deceive those who knew him to be\r\na devotee of pleasure.[1198] His appearance forcibly reminded them of\r\nthe old story of Master Fox turned hermit, and cries of \"Au Renard! Au\r\nRenard!\" were so loudly uttered when he was seen in the streets preceded\r\nby an attendant carrying a large silver cross, the badge of his office,\r\nthat he was soon fain to discard the obnoxious emblem.[1199] This was\r\nnot the only insult he was compelled to swallow. A portrait of his\r\ngrandfather, Pope Alexander the Sixth, was engraved and published, with\r\nan account of his life and death, in which the moral character of\r\nLucretia Borgia was painted in the darkest colors.[1200] It was,\r\nhowever, speedily suppressed by the civil authorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition of people and chancellor.]\r\n\r\nThe plenary powers which the papal commission conferred upon Ippolito\r\nd'Este created an opposition even in higher circles. He had, it is true,\r\napprehending an unfavorable reception, taken the pains to invite the\r\nFrench ambassador at Venice to confer with him while he was stopping in\r\nFerrara on his way to Paris, and had assured him that he went with the\r\nsole intention of subserving the interests of France, and would use the\r\npowers given him by the Pope no farther than Charles desired.[1201] This\r\nand reiterated assurances of the same tenor, after his arrival, did not\r\nremove the scruples of Michel de l'Hospital. The latter insisted that\r\nthe authority which the Pope pretended to confer upon his legate was in\r\ndirect contravention of the resolution of the recent States General,\r\nthat ecclesiastical benefices should henceforth be at the disposition,\r\nnot of the Pope, but of the prelates in their respective dioceses, and\r\nthat no papal dispensations should hereafter be received. He therefore\r\ndeclined to give to the pontifical warrant the official ratification\r\nwithout which it was of no validity in the kingdom; and he was supported\r\nin his refusal by the majority of the royal council. He was, however,\r\noverruled. It would be highly improper, the Cardinal of Ferrara\r\npersuaded Catharine and her advisers to believe, that a prelate allied\r\nto the royal house of France should be the first legate to be denied the\r\ncustomary honors. And so L'Hospital, after receiving a direct order from\r\nthe king, and having had several altercations with the legate,\r\nreluctantly affixed the great seal of France, taking care to relieve\r\nhimself of all responsibility by writing below it the words, _Me non\r\nconsentiente_. This addition for the present rendered the document\r\nentirely useless, for parliament promptly refused to receive or register\r\nthat which had failed to meet with the chancellor's approbation.[1202]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The legate's successful intrigues.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His excessive complaisance.]\r\n\r\nThe first great aim of Ferrara was to prevent the assembly of prelates\r\nat Poissy from assuming in any degree the character of a national\r\ncouncil by undertaking a genuine reformation of doctrine or practice,\r\nand to induce the reference of all such questions as ought there to have\r\nbeen discussed, to the Council of Trent.[1203] How well he succeeded was\r\nshown by the event. By purposely delaying his arrival until the assembly\r\nhad convened, he avoided the defeat that he might have experienced had\r\nhe been on the spot and opposed its opening.[1204] He was sufficiently\r\nearly, however, to effect all that was really of moment. His manners\r\nwere conciliatory and paved the way for his intrigues. Catharine was the\r\nmore friendly both to him and to Santa Croce, because of the contrast\r\nbetween their deportment and that of Gualtieri, whom she hated for his\r\nsour disposition and boorish ways.[1205] Navarre and the princes\r\nsuspected of a leaning toward Protestantism were plied with other arts.\r\nIn fact, so well did the legate counterfeit liberality of sentiment,\r\nthat even the Pope and his brethren of the Roman consistory seem to have\r\nbecome a little alarmed. For he went so far, on one occasion, as to\r\naccompany the Huguenot nobles to hear the sermon of one of their\r\nministers, greatly to the displeasure of the Pope and of Philip the\r\nSecond, as well as of the Cardinal of Tournon and other bigots at the\r\nFrench court who could not follow the tangled thread of his tortuous\r\npolicy.[1206] It was difficult for him to convince them that he had made\r\nthis extraordinary concession simply in order to induce Antoine and his\r\nmore intractable queen in their turn to attend the Roman Catholic\r\nservices. Navarre was naturally the person whom legate and nuncio were\r\nmost anxious to influence. For, respecting Catharine, they soon\r\nsatisfied themselves that, if she was not a very ardent Romanist, she\r\nwas nothing of a Protestant.[1207] The King of Navarre, however, was to\r\nbe gained only by skilful and concerted diplomacy. Easy to be duped as\r\nhe was, he had met with so many disappointments that he required\r\nsomething more than vague assurances to induce him to throw away the\r\nsolid advantages derived from still being the reputed head of the\r\nHuguenots. For about this time his agents at Madrid and at Rome had been\r\ncoldly received. Philip and his minister Alva excused themselves from\r\npaying any attention to his claims upon Navarre or an equivalent, until\r\nAntoine had shown more decided devotion to Catholicism than was afforded\r\nby simply attending mass, and they had made it evident that armed\r\nintervention in behalf of the French adherents of the old faith was\r\nrather to be expected from the Spaniard, than any act of condescension\r\nin favor of the titular king. From Rome he had scarcely obtained more\r\nencouragement than from Madrid.[1208] Under these circumstances, it\r\nseemed that little was needed to make his alienation from Romanism\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antoine of Navarre plied with suggestions.]\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the Spanish ambassador, Chantonnay, brother of\r\nCardinal Granvelle, by his severity and his continual threats of war not\r\nonly discouraged the Navarrese king, but rendered himself so hateful to\r\nthe court that his presence could scarcely be endured,[1209] the papal\r\nemissaries, to whom the Venetian Barbaro lent efficient aid, allured him\r\nby brilliant hopes of a sovereignty which Philip, induced by the Pope's\r\nintercessions, would confer upon him. Convinced that the destruction of\r\nall hope of recovering Navarre from the Spanish king would instantly\r\ncause Antoine to throw himself without disguise into the arms of the\r\nCalvinists, and would thus secure the speedy triumph of the Reformation\r\nthroughout all France,[1210] they even persuaded Chantonnay to abate\r\nsomewhat of his insolence, and to ascribe his master's delay in\r\nsatisfying Antoine's requests to Philip's belief that his suppliant was\r\nconfident of being able to frighten the Spaniards into\r\nrestitution.[1211] They represented to Antoine himself that his only\r\nchance of success lay in devotion to the Catholic faith. Joining arms\r\nwith \"those flagitious men\" the Huguenots, he would arouse the hostility\r\nof almost all Christendom. The Pope, the priests, even the greater part\r\nof France, would be his enemies. In a conflict with them he could place\r\nlittle reliance upon troops unaccustomed to war and drawn from every\r\nquarter--none at all upon the English, who were ancient enemies, or upon\r\nthe Germans, who fought for pay. Better would it be for him to secure\r\nbut half his demands by peace, than to lose all by trying the fortunes\r\nof war.[1212]\r\n\r\nHow thoroughly the legate and nuncio, with the assistance of their\r\nfaithful allies, the Spanish ambassador and the Guises, Montmorency and\r\nSt. André, were successful in seducing the unstable King of Navarre from\r\nhis allegiance to the Protestant faith, this, and the disastrous results\r\nof his defection, will be developed in a subsequent part of our history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contradictory counsels.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The triumvirate retire in disgust.]\r\n\r\nThe edict of the eighteenth of October, for the restitution of the\r\nchurches of which the Huguenots had taken possession, was by no means an\r\nexponent of the true dispositions of the court. It was rather a measure\r\nof political expediency, reluctantly adopted, to attain the double end\r\nof securing the pecuniary grant of which the government stood in\r\npressing need, and of preventing Philip from executing the threats of\r\ninvasion which Alva had but too plainly made in his interview with the\r\nFrench envoy extraordinary, Montbéron d'Auzances, and the ambassador,\r\nSebastien de l'Aubespine[1213]--threats which nothing would have been\r\nmore likely to convert into stern realities than the concession of the\r\nchurches for which the Protestants clamored. It was a measure\r\ndetermined upon by a royal council in which the influence of the party\r\ninclined to Protestant and liberal principles was preponderant; in which\r\nthe advice of the moderate Chancellor L'Hospital was supreme; in which\r\nthe plans of the Guises, of Montmorency and St. André, were set aside,\r\nto make room for those of Condé and Montluc, Bishop of Valence. It is\r\nthis fact that furnishes the clue to a circumstance which at first sight\r\nseems an inexplicable paradox, namely, that almost the very day on which\r\nthe intolerant resolution, compelling the Huguenots to surrender the\r\nchurches, even in places where they constituted the vast majority of the\r\npopulation, was adopted, the members of the triumvirate, formed for the\r\nexpress purpose of upholding the papal church in France, left the court\r\nin disgust. It was scarcely to be expected that these ambitious nobles,\r\naccustomed to occupy the first rank, and to dispose of the national\r\nconcerns according to their own private pleasure, should submit with\r\ngood grace to the decisions of a council in which the Bourbons held the\r\nsway, and a hated chancellor's opinions were followed whom they\r\nthemselves had raised to his elevated position. Much less was it natural\r\nfor them to remain when the measures which the administration proposed\r\nwere of enlarged toleration, instead of greater repression. Accordingly,\r\nthe Duke of Guise left Saint Germain for Joinville, one of his estates\r\non the borders of Lorraine, while his brother, the cardinal, repaired to\r\nhis archbishopric of Rheims. Here, while pretending to apply himself\r\nwith unheard-of diligence to his duties as a spiritual shepherd, and\r\npreaching, as was reported, rather the Lutheran than the Romish view of\r\nthe eucharist, he was making bids as high as those of the duke, if of a\r\ndifferent kind, for the favor and support of the neighboring German\r\nprinces who adhered to the Confession of Augsburg. Catharine, not sorry\r\nto be rid of their presence, and \"best pleased when the world was\r\ndiscordant,\" gave them a kind dismissal. The elements were less\r\npropitious. An extraordinarily severe storm that swept over St. Germain\r\non the day of their departure gave rise to a report among the courtiers\r\nthat \"the devil was carrying them off.\" It was little suspected,\r\nquaintly remarks the narrator of this incident, how soon he was going\r\nto bring them back![1214] Cardinal Tournon and Constable Montmorency\r\nfollowed the example of the Guises, and went into retirement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hopes entertained of the young king.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles's curiosity respecting the mass.]\r\n\r\nThe prospect was at this moment as dark to the papal party as it was\r\nfull of encouragement for the Huguenots and their sympathizers. Nothing\r\nbut a resort to violence could avert the speedy downfall of the\r\nauthority of the Roman pontiff in France. A few months more of peace,\r\nand everything might be lost.[1215] If the young king continued under\r\nthe influences now surrounding him, he might become a Huguenot openly,\r\nas it was pretty well understood, by those who had the opportunity of\r\nseeing him daily and noting his words and actions, that he was already\r\nhalf inclined to be one now. The Queen of Navarre, the Prince of Condé,\r\nand the leading Protestants at court perceived this and could not hide\r\ntheir delight. One day about this time, Jeanne D'Albret drew the English\r\nambassador apart from the courtiers waiting upon her, and, having seated\r\nhim by her side, related a conversation she had within the past few days\r\nheld with Charles. It is thus reported by Throkmorton in a despatch to\r\nQueen Elizabeth: \"Good aunt,\" said the king, \"I pray you tell me what\r\ndoth this mean, that the king, my uncle, your husband, doth every day go\r\nto mass, and you come not there, nor my cousin, your son, the Prince of\r\nNavarre? I answered (quoth the queen), Sire, the king, my husband doth\r\nso because you go thither, to wait upon you and obey your order and\r\ncommandment. Nay, aunt (quoth he), I do neither command nor desire him\r\nto do so. But if it be naught (as I do hear say it is), he might well\r\nenough forbear to be at it, and offend me nothing at all; for if I might\r\nas well as he, and did believe of it as he doth, I would not be at it\r\nmyself. The queen said, Why, sir, what do you believe of it? The king\r\nanswered, The queen, my mother, Monsieur de Cipierre, and my\r\nschoolmaster doth tell me, that it is very good, and that I do there\r\ndaily see God; but (said the king) I do hear by others that neither God\r\nis there nor the thing very good. And surely, aunt, to be plain with\r\nyou, _I would not be there myself_. And therefore you may boldly\r\ncontinue and do as you do, and so may the king, my uncle, your husband,\r\nuse the matter according to his conscience for any displeasure he shall\r\ndo unto me. _And, surely, aunt_ (quoth he), _when I shall be at my own\r\nrule I mean to quit the matter!_ But I pray you (said the king), keep\r\nthis matter to yourself, and use it so that it come not to my mother's\r\nears.\"[1216]\r\n\r\nIt need not occasion surprise that the Queen of Navarre paused, in the\r\nmidst of her expressions of intense gratification, to give utterance to\r\nthe fear that Charles might be \"too toward, too virtuous, and too good\r\nto tarry amongst them,\" or recalled the many similar \"acts and sayings\r\nof the late King Edward of England, who did not live long.\"[1217]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza is begged to remain.]\r\n\r\nWhen the first intimation of the edict for the restoration of the\r\nchurches reached Beza, his impulse was to abandon forthwith a court\r\nwhere his hopes had been so cruelly disappointed, and a want of proper\r\nconfidence had been displayed by his very friends among the royal\r\ncounsellors. But his indignant remonstrances were met by the assurance\r\nthat benevolent designs for the Reformation were concealed beneath the\r\napparent harshness of the law, which was a necessary concession to\r\ncertain circumstances. He was entreated to be of good courage and to\r\nremain. Catharine joined her solicitations to those of Condé, Admiral\r\nColigny, and other chiefs of the Protestants. Beza reluctantly\r\nconsented, and while Martyr was suffered to depart with courteous\r\nacknowledgments of his services, the Genevese was still more honorably\r\nretained at court.[1218] The new measure from which brilliant results\r\nwere expected was the calling of an assembly of notables, including\r\nrepresentatives from each of the parliaments, the princes of the blood,\r\nand members of the council, etc., which was to meet in December, and to\r\nsuggest some decree on the subject of the religious question, of a\r\nprovisional, if not of a permanent character.[1219]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish plot to kidnap the Duke of Orleans.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenot churches in France.]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, upon a rumor that the Duke of Nemours, a faithful\r\nally of the Guises, had plotted to carry off the young Duke of Orleans,\r\nthe future Henry the Third, into Spain, with the view of affording his\r\nbrother-in-law Philip a specious pretext for interfering in Trench\r\naffairs,[1220] Catharine de' Medici turned to the Protestants, and\r\ninquired what forces of theirs she could rely upon in the threatened\r\ncontest with the Spanish, Papal, and German Roman Catholic troops. Her\r\nquestion elicited the significant fact that there were two thousand one\r\nhundred and fifty Huguenot churches in France, varying in size from a\r\nmere handful of believers to a community of thousands of members,\r\nembracing almost the entire population of a provincial city, and under\r\nthe guidance of several pastors. In the name of these churches a\r\npetition was presented to the king, asking for places of worship, and\r\nloyally tendering life and property in his defence.[1221]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beza secures a favorable royal order.]\r\n\r\nTo restrain the impatience of so numerous a body as the Protestants,\r\nwhile waiting for the assembly of the notables which was to confer the\r\nfull measure of liberty they desired, was the task imposed upon Beza. He\r\nwas to serve as a _hostage_ for the obedience of the reformed\r\nchurches.[1222] But the sagacious theologian recognized the difficulty\r\nof the position he was called to fill. He warned the government\r\naccordingly against disappointing the hopes it aroused in the breasts of\r\nhis fellow Protestants, and he urged that if they must be temporarily\r\ndenied the use of the places of worship which they had occupied wherever\r\nthey constituted the bulk of the population, the present rigor must be\r\nsomewhat abated during the interval before their formal emancipation.\r\nAfter much importunity a mandate was obtained, addressed to the royal\r\nofficers, in which they were instructed to interpret the previous edicts\r\nwith leniency, permitting different degrees of liberty, according to the\r\nvarious circumstances in which they were placed. In Normandy and Gascony\r\nthe religious meetings might be open and unrestricted. In Paris they\r\nmust be held secretly in private houses, and not more than two hundred\r\npersons could be gathered together.[1223] Everywhere, however, the\r\nProtestants were to be protected, and this was a great step gained. For\r\nthose very officers, whose task it had not unfrequently been to drag the\r\nHuguenots to prison, were now constituted the guardians of their lives\r\nand property.[1224]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to restrain Huguenot impetuosity.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foix.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Châlons-sur-Marne.]\r\n\r\nYet, how to restrain the impetuosity, how to check the demands of the\r\nmultitudes recently converted to the reformed faith, how to induce them\r\nto give up the churches where whole generations of their ancestors had\r\nworshipped before them, and in which they believed that they had the\r\nclearest right of property, and hand them over to a mere handful of\r\nignorant or interested persons who would not listen to reason or\r\nScripture--this was the problem that seemed even beyond the power of\r\nBeza's wit to solve. The young vine, in whose branches the full sap of\r\nspring was rapidly circulating, must have room for healthy growth. From\r\nall parts of France the constant cry was for the Word of God and for\r\nliberty. Although the number of daily attendants on Calvin's lectures\r\nwas roughly estimated at a thousand,[1225] it was impossible for Geneva\r\nto supply the drafts made upon her, when there were three hundred\r\nparishes, apparently in a single province, which had thrown off the\r\nmass, but had as yet been unsuccessful in their quest of pastors;[1226]\r\nwhen the history of hundreds of towns and villages was the counterpart\r\nof the history of Foix, where, in two months, an infant church of\r\nthirty or forty members had grown to have five or six hundred, and the\r\nProtestant population was almost in the majority in the town, although\r\nas yet, notwithstanding incessant efforts to obtain a pastor, the only\r\npublic service consisted of the repetition by a layman of the prayers\r\ncontained in the liturgy of Calvin[1227]--when many a minister met with\r\nsuccess similar to that which attended Pierre Fornelet, who could point\r\nto fifteen villages in the vicinity of Châlons-sur-Marne, begging for\r\nHuguenot pastors, and all this the fruit of seven weeks of apostolic\r\nlabours; and could record the fact that poor men and women flocked to\r\nthe city from a distance of seven or eight leagues, when they simply\r\nheard that the Gospel was preached there[1228]--when it was estimated by\r\ncompetent witnesses that from four to six thousand ministers could be\r\nprofitably employed within the bounds of the kingdom.[1229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troyes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris.]\r\n\r\nIn some places, by strenuous exertion, the ministers were successful in\r\npersuading their flocks to refrain from overt acts tending to provoke\r\noutbursts of hostility. At Troyes, in Champagne, a thousand persons\r\nconvened by day or by night, not summoned by the sound of bells, but\r\nquietly notified by an \"_advertisseur_\" of the daily changing place of\r\nmeeting. Yet even there, on Sunday and on public holidays, the Huguenots\r\ntook pains to hold their \"assemblée\" in the open day, before the eyes of\r\ntheir enemies.[1230] At Paris, the Protestants, compelled to go some\r\ndistance into the country for worship, on their return (Sunday, the\r\ntwelfth of October), found the gates closed against them, and were\r\nattacked by a mob composed of the dregs of the populace. Many of their\r\nnumber were killed or wounded. The assailants retreated when the\r\nHuguenot gentry, with swords drawn, rallied for the defence of their\r\nunarmed companions, whom they could not, however, guarantee from the\r\nstones and other missiles hurled at them. For a few days the public\r\nservices were intermitted at the earnest request of the Prince of La\r\nRoche-sur-Yon, in the interest of good order and to prevent\r\ndisturbance.[1231] But a month later the Huguenots assembled openly, and\r\nin still greater numbers. On reaching the suburbs, the women were placed\r\nin the centre, with the men who had come on foot around them, while\r\nthose who were mounted on horseback shielded the whole from attack. A\r\nbody of guards was posted by the prince in the immediate\r\nneighborhood.[1232]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montpellier.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Churches visited and stripped.]\r\n\r\nIn the south of France the people were less easily curbed, and the\r\nindiscretion or treachery of their enemies often furnished provocation\r\nfor acts which the sober judgment of their pastors refused to sanction.\r\nThe chapter of the cathedral of Montpellier, with the view of overawing\r\nthe city, had, in October, introduced a garrison into the commanding\r\nFort St. Pierre. On a Sunday (the nineteenth of October) the Protestants\r\nlaid siege, and on the succeeding day the chapter entered into a\r\ncomposition with the citizens, by which the canons retained the liberty\r\nof celebrating their services, but bound themselves to lay down their\r\narms and dismiss the soldiers they had called in. When, however, a\r\nsoldier, as he was leaving, drew a pistol and killed one of the\r\nProtestants, the fury of the latter could not be repressed. They cried\r\nthat treacherous designs were on foot, and madly killed many of the\r\ncanons and their sympathizers. Then, directing their indignation against\r\nthe churches, where the doctrine that no faith need be kept with\r\nheretics had been inculcated, they overturned in a few hours the work of\r\nfour or five centuries. The next day, of sixty churches and chapels in\r\nMontpellier or its neighborhood, not one was open. Not a priest, not a\r\nmonk, dared to show his face. Yet this same excitable populace, which\r\nhad been wrought up to frenzy by a soldier's treacherous act, submitted\r\nwithout resistance when, on the twentieth of November, Joyeuse, in the\r\nking's name, published the obnoxious edict for the restitution of all\r\nchurches within twenty-four hours. The cathedral was given up, and the\r\nservices according to the rites of the reformed church were held in the\r\nspacious \"École mage,\" until, by a new arrangement with the canons, the\r\nProtestants were once more put in possession of two of the old\r\necclesiastical edifices. Yet the edict did not arrest the rapid progress\r\nof the new faith. The mass was not reinstated, and the small Roman\r\nCatholic minority remained at home on the feast-days. Even the lowest\r\nclass of the population--elsewhere, from ignorance and prejudice, the\r\nstronghold of the papal religion--here seemed to share in the universal\r\ntendency, and, unfortunately, as a local chronicler, to whom we are\r\nindebted for these particulars, informs us, took no better way of\r\ntestifying its devotion than by \"mutilating sepulchral monuments,\r\nunearthing the dead, and committing a thousand acts of folly.\" Carrying\r\ntheir hatred of everything that reminded them of the period of judicial\r\nabuse to the length of detesting even the insignia of office, the people\r\ncompelled the ministers of the law to doff their traditional square cap\r\nand assume a hat such as was worn by the rest of the population.[1233]\r\nThus the strength of the reformatory current could be gauged by the mud\r\nand rubbish which it tore from the banks on either side--an addition to\r\nits bulk that contributed nothing to its power, while marring its purity\r\nand sullying its fair antecedents. A class of persons attached\r\nthemselves to the Huguenot community that could not be brought into\r\nsubjection to the discipline instituted with such difficulty at Geneva.\r\nIt would seem invidious to lay their excesses to the account of the\r\nHuguenot leaders, whether religious or political, since those excesses\r\nmet with the severe reprobation of the latter.[1234]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rein, and not the spur, needed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriages and baptisms at court, \"after the fashion of\r\nGeneva.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Would that our friends might restrain themselves at least for two\r\nmonths!\" was the ejaculation of Beza, in view of the natural impatience\r\nexhibited on all sides. \"I fear our own party more than I do our\r\nadversaries.\"[1235] The rein was needed, not the spur. When, instead of\r\ntwo hundred persons, the Parisian assemblies of Huguenots often\r\nconsisted of six thousand, a fanatical populace, accustomed for a whole\r\ngeneration to see the very suspicion of Lutheranism expiated in the\r\nflames of the Place de Grève or of the Halles, could ill brook the sight\r\nof such open gatherings for the reformed worship. How much greater the\r\npopular indignation when it became known that Chancellor L'Hospital had\r\nauthorized _two_ places for public worship according to the rites of the\r\nreformed churches, in the neighborhood of the Gate of St. Antoine and\r\nthe Gate of St. Marceau! Added to these palpable proofs of the court's\r\ncomplicity with the heretics, was the no less scandalous fact that\r\nmarriages and baptisms, celebrated \"after the fashion of Geneva,\" were\r\nof frequent occurrence; that the nuptials of young De Rohan, cousin of\r\nAntoine of Navarre, and Mademoiselle de Brabançon, niece of the Duchess\r\nd'Étampes, had been performed on St. Michael's Day, and in the presence\r\nof Condé and the Queen of Navarre, by Theodore Beza himself; and that in\r\na masquerade in the royal palace Charles the Ninth had worn a cap which\r\nbore an unmistakable resemblance to a bishop's mitre![1236]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tanquerel's seditious declaration.]\r\n\r\nWhile legate and nuncio labored to put an end to these hateful\r\nmanifestations by personal solicitation addressed to Catharine, to\r\nCardinal Châtillon, and others,[1237] the priests and monks were no less\r\nactive in stirring up the passions of the people to open resistance. In\r\nthe scholastic halls of the Collége de Harecourt, one Tanquerel, a\r\ndoctor of the Sorbonne, enunciated the dangerous maxim that \"the Pope\r\ncan depose heretical kings and emperors.\" At this menacing declaration,\r\nwhich, under a king in his minority and a regency divided in its\r\nsentiments on religious questions, was much more than a theoretical\r\nabstraction, the government took alarm. The Parliament of Paris\r\ninvestigated the offence, and the doctrine of Tanquerel was severely\r\ncondemned. Tanquerel himself having fled from the city to avoid the\r\nconsequences of his rashness, the Dean of the Sorbonne was required, by\r\norder of the supreme court, to utter in his name a solemn recantation in\r\nthe presence of the assembled theologians and of a committee of\r\nparliament; and two theologians were deputed to St. Germain to beg the\r\nking's forgiveness.[1238]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jean de Hans.]\r\n\r\nThe preachers were not behind the doctors in the use of seditious\r\nlanguage. They attacked the government and its entire policy; and one of\r\ntheir number--Jean de Hans--while delivering Advent discourses in the\r\nchurch of St. Barthélemi, in the very neighborhood of the palace, so\r\ndistinguished himself for the extravagance of his denunciations, that he\r\nwas arrested and carried off to the court at St. Germain. Yet such was\r\nhis well-known popularity with the Parisians, that it was found\r\nnecessary to effect his capture by a troop of forty armed men; and the\r\npowerful intercession made in his behalf induced the government to\r\nforget his disrespectful language respecting the princes, and to release\r\nhim after barely a week's imprisonment.[1239]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip threatens to interfere in French affairs.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"A true defender of the faith.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courteville's mission to Flanders.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Tanquerel's treasonable thesis and Hans's excited\r\ndeclamation were not mere harmless speculations which might never be of\r\nany practical importance to the state. The King of Spain had taken the\r\npains to inform the queen mother that he had fully made up his mind to\r\ninterfere in the affairs of France, and to enforce Catholic supremacy at\r\nthe point of the sword. She might accept or decline the offers of the\r\nself-appointed champion of orthodoxy; _but, if she declined, he was\r\nresolved none the less to afford his succor to any true friend of the\r\nChurch that chose to request it_. Timid and irresolute Catharine, who\r\ndesired to steer clear of the Scylla of Spanish intervention quite as\r\nmuch as of the Charybdis of Huguenot supremacy, trembled for the\r\nsecurity of her unballasted bark. But the watchful old man who sat on\r\nSt. Peter's reputed seat was thrown into a paroxysm of delight. When the\r\nAmbassador Vargas handed him a copy of the message his master had sent\r\nto St. Germain, Pope Pius paused a moment, after he had read the\r\nundisguised threat, then burst out with a flood of benedictions on the\r\nhead of the Spanish king. \"There,\" he cried, \"is a truly Catholic\r\nprince, there a true defender of the faith! I expected no less of\r\nhim.\"[1240] And Philip intended to carry his menaces into effect. On the\r\ntwenty-fifth of October his secretary, Courteville, left Madrid,\r\nostensibly on a visit to his infirm father in Flanders, but in reality\r\nintrusted with a very important commission, which, in an age when it was\r\nno uncommon thing for a messenger to be waylaid and robbed of his\r\ndespatches, could scarcely be otherwise discharged. He was to make\r\ndiligent inquiries of Margaret of Parma, Regent of the Netherlands, as\r\nto the actual condition of the provinces, and the material support they\r\ncould give the undertaking upon which Philip has set his heart. While\r\npassing through Paris he was to confide his dangerous secret to the\r\nAmbassador Chantonnay, and instruct him to support any of the Roman\r\nCatholic nobles that might show a disposition to rise,[1241] or to\r\ninstigate them to action by the promise of Philip's support. Neither\r\nMargaret nor Chantonnay, however, could fulfil the monarch's desires.\r\nThe former thought that Philip had thrown away the golden opportunity by\r\nfailing to interfere while the question of Catharine's and Navarre's\r\nclaims to the administration was in dispute, and when the number of\r\nsectaries was much smaller than at present; and by the time Courteville\r\nreached Poissy, where Chantonnay was stopping, the assembled nobles had\r\ndispersed to their homes, and the Guises were practically farther from\r\nParis than from Brussels. So the execution of Philip's plan, both\r\nagreed, must be deferred for some time.[1242]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ill-starred Medici family.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Venetian envoy's lugubrious account of France.]\r\n\r\nIt could not be denied that the situation was critical in the extreme.\r\nLong-headed diplomatists of the conservative school shook their heads\r\nominously. They hinted that there might be only too much truth in the\r\ncurrent Catholic saying that the Medici family was destined to be fatal\r\nto Christendom. Under Leo the Tenth Germany was lost to the papacy,\r\nunder Clement the Eighth England had apostatized, and now under Pius the\r\nFourth, a third Pope of the same ill-starred race, France was on the\r\nbrink of ruin. The king was a boy, without experience and without\r\nauthority, the council full of discord, the supreme power in the hands\r\nof the queen, who, though sagacious, was yet only a woman, and both\r\ntimid and irresolute. The King of Navarre, while noble and gracious, was\r\na prince of little constancy and limited practice in government. The\r\npeople were in disorder and manifest division. Everywhere there were\r\nseditious and insolent men, who, under the pretext of religion, had\r\ndisturbed the general peace, overturned customs and discipline, and put\r\nin doubt the royal authority and the safety of all. Oh, that Philip the\r\nSecond had the courage of his father, or that Charles the Fifth had had\r\nhis son's glorious opportunity--_then would France be France no\r\nlonger_![1243] For just so certainly as the Spanish king was looked upon\r\nwith suspicion by the rulers, was he longed for by all that hated the\r\npresent state of things, and, most of all, by the prelates and the rest\r\nof the Catholics, who knew not in what other quarter to look for\r\nsalvation.[1244]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Romish complaints of Huguenot boldness.]\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that peace should long be maintained under such\r\ncircumstances. It could not be but that the Huguenots, conscious of\r\ntheir growing numbers, confident of the near approach of the day when\r\ntheir rights were to be formally recognized, and impatient of the\r\nfetters with which their enemies still attempted to embarrass their\r\nprogress, would assert their rights from day to day with increasing\r\nboldness. The priests and the rabble, on the other hand, regarded this\r\nnew courage with suspicion, and interpreted every action as springing\r\nfrom insufferable insolence. They were on the watch to detect fresh\r\nexamples of Huguenot audacity. They complained of the numbers that\r\nflocked to hear the reformed preachers, of the arms which some carried\r\nfor self-defence--a precaution not very astonishing in view of the\r\nexcited feelings of the Parisians and the frequent outbursts of their\r\nfury, and still less extraordinary on the part of the \"noblesse,\" who\r\nwere accustomed to wear a sword at all times. They went so far as to\r\nassert that the Huguenot multitude usurped the entire pavement, and were\r\nbecome so overbearing that they were ready to pick a quarrel with any\r\none that presumed \"to look at them.\" A peaceable Catholic must needs, to\r\navoid abuse and hard blows, show more skill in getting out of their way\r\nthan he would in shunning a mad dog. The streets resounded with their\r\nprofane psalm-singing, and ill fared it with the unlucky wight that\r\nventured to remonstrate, or dared to find fault with their provoking use\r\nof meat on the prohibited days. He was likely to have a broken head for\r\nhis pains, or be shut up in prison by judges who sympathized with the\r\n\"new doctrines.\"[1245] The court, however, more correctly ascribing the\r\ndisturbances that occurred on such occasions to the attacks made upon\r\nthe Protestants by their opponents, detached the \"chevalier du guet\"\r\nand his archers to attend the meetings and to prevent the disturbance of\r\nthe worshippers on their way to and from the places assigned for the\r\nProtestant services in the suburbs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"tumult of Saint Médard.\"]\r\n\r\nAt length, on Saturday, the twenty-seventh of December, a serious\r\ncommotion took place. One of the two spots where Catharine, at the\r\nchancellor's suggestion, had permitted the Huguenots of the capital to\r\nmeet for worship, was a spacious building on the southern side of the\r\nSeine, outside the walls and not far from the gate of St. Marceau. It\r\nbore the enigmatical designation of \"Le Patriarche,\" derived--so\r\nantiquarians alleged--from the circumstance that it had been built long\r\nbefore by a patriarch of Alexandria expelled from his see by the\r\nMoslems.[1246] Here a congregation of several thousand persons[1247] had\r\nassembled in the afternoon. The introductory services over, the pastor,\r\nJean Malot, had been preaching for a quarter of an hour, when his sermon\r\nwas noisily interrupted. Separated from the \"Patriarche\" by a narrow\r\nlane stood the parish church of Saint Médard. Under the pretext of\r\nsummoning the people to vespers, the priests had ordered all the bells\r\nin the tower to be rung violently, and hoped by the din to put an end to\r\nthe heretical worship in the vicinity. Finding it impossible to make\r\nhimself heard, the minister endeavored to restrain his excited audience,\r\nand after the singing of a psalm resumed his discourse. It was all in\r\nvain: St. Médard's bells pealed out the tocsin, and the sound of the\r\ndischarge of fire-arms, and the crash of stones hurled from the belfry,\r\nincreased the confusion. Meanwhile two Protestants had quietly gone over\r\nto the side door of the church, to request an abatement of the\r\ninterruption. Their civil request was answered with violence. One of the\r\nmen barely escaped with his life; the other, a deacon of the church, was\r\nkilled on the spot. Five or six royal archers, commanded by the provost,\r\nRouge-Oreille, next summoned the party within the church to desist, but\r\nmet with no better success. At length the people, now congregated around\r\nthe entrance, and subjected to a storm of missiles from the windows and\r\nthe tower, forced open the doors and entered the church. Here they\r\ndiscovered the corpse of their murdered brother. The priests and\r\nsacristans, though armed with swords and clubs, were soon driven to take\r\nrefuge in the belfry. In the struggle the ecclesiastics themselves\r\nbecame iconoclasts, and, when their supply of less sacred implements ran\r\nlow, broke in pieces the images of saints, and rained the fragments upon\r\nthe Huguenot crowd. Finally a threat to set fire to the belfry put an\r\nend at once to the ringing of the tocsin and to the holy shower.\r\nMeantime the tumultous peals of St. Médard's bells had drawn to the spot\r\nthe \"chevalier du guet,\" one Gabaston, who, on learning the\r\ncircumstances, promptly lent aid in quelling the disturbance, and\r\narrested a number of the leaders in the riotous proceedings. Yielding to\r\nan injudicious impulse, the motley crowd of Huguenots and of persons who\r\nhad been attracted to the scene by the noise resolved to accompany the\r\nprisoners to the \"Petit Châtelet,\" and the march assumed the appearance\r\nof a triumphal procession. Between Gabaston's troop of over two hundred\r\nmounted and foot archers, and the detachment of Rouge-Oreille, walked a\r\nband of unarmed Protestants, followed by the Roman Catholic prisoners,\r\nmany of them in their ecelesiastical dresses, and tied together two by\r\ntwo. It was deemed little short of a miracle that the procession, even\r\nwith its escort of soldiery, should be suffered to enter the city and\r\npass through its densely crowded streets on a public holiday, without\r\nbeing attacked by the intensely Roman Catholic populace.[1248]\r\n\r\nSuch was the famous \"tumult of Saint Médard\"--the result of a plan\r\nadopted expressly to stir up the inveterate hostility of the Parisians\r\nagainst the adherents of the Reformation, and to serve as the pretext\r\nfor demanding the prohibition of the Protestant \"assemblies.\"[1249] The\r\npopular explosion that had been expected instantly to follow the\r\napplication of the match was deferred until the morrow, when a rabble\r\nsuch as the capital alone could pour forth gutted the interior of the\r\n\"_Patriarche_\" and would have set it on fire, had it not been repulsed\r\nby a small body of Huguenot gentlemen.[1250] The plot had proved\r\nabortive; but it was the innocent victims and the friends of good order,\r\nnot the conspirators, who paid the penalty of the broken law. While the\r\npriest of Saint Médard and his accomplices were promptly discharged,\r\nwithout even a reprimand, Gabaston and one \"Nez-d'Argent,\" royal\r\nofficers who had interfered to restore order, were executed by command\r\nof parliament.[1251]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assembly of notables at St. Germain.]\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the occurrence of the seditious disturbance just\r\nnarrated, the assembly of notables was convened at St. Germain (January,\r\n1562). To this body it was proposed to refer the religious condition of\r\nthe realm, with the view of reaching some more definite and satisfactory\r\nsettlement than the \"Edict of July,\" whose provisions had become a dead\r\nletter before the ink with which they were written was dry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chancellor L'Hospital's opening address.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diversity of sentiment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nuncio's alarm and activity.]\r\n\r\nThe chancellor, who, according to custom, set forth at considerable\r\nlength the circumstances constraining the king, by his mother's advice,\r\nto summon the representatives of his trusty parliaments, with the\r\nhighest lords of the kingdom, to give him their counsel, dwelt upon the\r\nsignal failure of all the measures of repression hitherto adopted, and\r\nupon the necessity of finding other remedies for the public ills. He\r\ndisclaimed any intention on the king's part to introduce a discussion\r\nrespecting the two religions in order to settle their respective merits.\r\nIt was not to establish the faith, but to regulate the state, that they\r\nwere assembled. Those who were in no sense Christians might yet be\r\ncitizens; and, in leaving the Church, a man did not cease to be a good\r\nsubject of the king. \"We can live in peace,\" he added, \"with those who\r\ndo not observe the same ceremonies and usages, and we can apply to\r\nourselves the current saying: A wife's faults ought either to be cured\r\nor to be endured.\"[1252] When the opinions of the members of the\r\nassembly were successively given, the apprehensions entertained by the\r\nRomish party, from the very initiation of the plan of the conference,\r\nwere seen to be well grounded.[1253] The orthodoxy of the sentiments of\r\nthe majority was by no means above suspicion. The nuncio, Santa Croce,\r\nchronicles with alarm the preponderance of those who openly advocated\r\nthe adoption of lenient measures. It was evident that the Edict of July,\r\nwith its bloody policy, could command the votes of only a small\r\nminority. The pontifical ambassador trembled lest the Protestants\r\nshould, after all, obtain the largest concessions. He was, consequently,\r\nas despondent as ever his predecessor had been.[1254] But, more prudent\r\nthan the Bishop of Viterbo, he took pains to conceal his fears from the\r\neyes of the courtiers, lest he should furnish the Huguenots with fresh\r\nmeans of influencing the wavering government. Accordingly, instead of\r\ngiving up everything as lost, he spared neither time nor money,\r\nbesieging the doors of the grandees who were believed to be true friends\r\nof the Holy See, and entreating them to dismiss all intention of leaving\r\nthe court, and thus abandoning the field to their enemies.[1255] He even\r\nsought an interview with Catharine de' Medici, and, in company with the\r\nSpanish ambassador, offered her the united forces of the Pope and of\r\nPhilip to repress any disturbances that might arise from the adoption of\r\na course unpalatable to the Huguenots; and he returned from the audience\r\npersuaded that \"these preachers would obtain no churches, and would gain\r\nnothing from the conference.\"[1256]\r\n\r\nIn this conclusion, however, the nuncio was but partially correct. It is\r\ntrue that the small faction favoring an adherence to the old persecuting\r\npolicy succeeded, by uniting with the advocates of a limited\r\ntoleration, in defeating the project of the more liberal party;[1257]\r\nbut, as will be seen, it was by no means true that Protestantism gained\r\nnothing by the results of the deliberations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Edict of January.]\r\n\r\nThese results were embodied in the famous law which, from the\r\ncircumstance that it was signed on the seventeenth of January. 1562, is\r\nknown in history as the \"_Edict of January_.\" It began by repealing the\r\nprovisional edict of the preceding July, because, in consequence of its\r\nsweeping prohibition of all public and private assemblies, it had failed\r\nof accomplishing the objects intended, as was clear from the more\r\naggravated seditions ensuing. It ordained that \"those of the new\r\nreligion\" should give up all the churches they had seized, and\r\nprohibited them from building others, whether inside or outside of the\r\ncities. But the cardinal prescription was that, while all assemblages\r\nfor the purpose of listening to preaching, either by day or by night,\r\nwere forbidden within the walled cities, the penalties should be\r\nsuspended \"provisionally and until the determination of a general\r\ncouncil\" in the case of unarmed gatherings for religious worship held by\r\nday outside these limits. The Protestants, both on their way to their\r\nservices and on their return, were to be exempt from molestation on the\r\npart of the royal magistrates, who were enjoined to punish all seditious\r\npersons, whatever might be their religion. The ministers were commanded\r\nto inquire carefully into the life and morals of those whom they\r\nadmitted to their communion, to permit royal officers to be present at\r\nall their religious exercises, and to take a solemn oath before the\r\nlocal magistrates to observe this ordinance, promising, at the same\r\ntime, to teach no doctrines at variance with the true word of God as\r\ncontained in the Nicene Creed and in the canonical books of the Old and\r\nNew Testaments. Inflammatory and insulting harangues were forbidden\r\nalike to the Romish and the Protestant preachers. All seditious\r\ncombinations, the enrolment of troops, and the levy of money, were\r\nprohibited; nor could even an ecclesiastical synod or consistory be held\r\nwithout the previous consent of the royal officers and in their\r\npresence.[1258]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Huguenots no longer outlaws.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the most important features of a law the promulgation of which\r\nmarks the termination of the first great period in the history of the\r\nHuguenots of France--the period of persecution inflicted mainly\r\naccording to cruel legal ordinances and under the forms of judicial\r\nprocedure. From the moment of the publication of this charter--imperfect\r\nand inadequate as it manifestly was--the Huguenots ceased to be outlaws,\r\nand became, in the eye of the law, at least, a class entitled within\r\ncertain limits to the protection of the ministers of justice. Unhappily\r\nfor France, the solemn recognition of Protestant rights was scarcely\r\nconceded by representatives of the entire nation before an attempt was\r\nmade by a desperate faction to annul and overturn it by intrigue and\r\nviolence. The next act in this remarkable drama is, therefore, the\r\ninauguration of the period of _Civil War_, or of oppression exercised in\r\ndefiance of acknowledged rights and of the accepted principles of\r\nequity--a lamentable period, in which every bloody contest originated in\r\nthe determination of the one party to circumscribe or destroy, and of\r\nthe other to maintain in its integrity the fundamental basis of\r\ntoleration laid down in the Edict of January.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1108: La Place, 154; Baum, Theodor Beza, ii. 230-234.

The impression made\r\nby the cardinal's speech upon his Romanist and Protestant hearers\r\ndiffered widely. According to the Abbé Bruslart (Mém. de Condé, i. 52),\r\nhe spoke \"en si bons et élégans termes, et d'une si bonne grace et\r\nasseurance, que nos adversaires mesmes l'admiroient.\" Stuck makes him\r\nspeak \"admodum inepte\" (_ap._ Baum, ii., App., 66); while Beza writes:\r\n\"Nihil unquam audivi impudentius, nihil ineptius.... Cætera ejusmodi quæ\r\ncerte mihi nauseam moverunt\" (Ib., 63, 64). Peter Martyr judged more\r\nleniently (Ib., 67, 68). It is, therefore, hardly likely that Beza said,\r\nas Dr. Henry White alleges without referring to his authority (Massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew, 64); \"Had I the Cardinal's eloquence I should hope\r\nto convert half France.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1140: La Place, 178; Hist. ecclés. des égl. réf., _ubi supra_;\r\nJean de Serres, i. 280; De Thou, iii. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1141: La Place, etc., _ubi supra_; J. de Serres, i. 281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1142: \"Nobis certum est,\" says Beza in a letter of Sept. 17th,\r\n\"vel mox congredi vel protestatione facta discedere, si pergant diem de\r\ndie ducere.\" Baum, ii., App., 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1143: \"Quid novi sperare possim non video.

The result of their interview was the provisional\r\nadoption of a declaration on the subject of the eucharist, which, though\r\nundoubtedly Protestant in its natural import, was rejected by the rest\r\nof the ministers as not sufficiently explicit.

The correspondence of Beza and others that were present\r\nat the colloquy, collected by Prof. Baum in the supplementary volume of\r\ndocuments (published in 1852), and the detailed accounts of the Histoire\r\necclés. des égl. réf, of La Place (Commentaires de l'estat de la rel. et\r\nrépublique, which here terminate), and of Jean de Serres, who, in this\r\npart of his history, does little more than translate La Place, are the\r\nmost important sources of authentic information. Castelnau's account of\r\nthe colloquy (1. iii., c. 4) is remarkably incorrect. He makes the ten\r\ndelegates confer together for _three months_, without agreeing on a\r\nsingle point, and finally separate on the 25th of November. Davila is\r\nbrief and unsatisfactory (pp. 50, 51).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1172: From what Martyr wrote to the magistrates of Zurich\r\n(Oct. 17th) respecting the conduct of the bishops in connection with the\r\nsubscription to the canons, it would appear that the close of the\r\nprelatic assembly did not disgrace the amenities of the debates at its\r\ncommencement (see _ante_, p. 499): \"Accidit mira Dei providentia, ut\r\nrepente inter episcopos, qui erant Poysiaci, tam grave dissidium ortum\r\nfuerit, ut fere ad manus venerint, imo, ut homines fide digni affirmant\r\nres _ut pugnis et unguibus_ est acta.\" Baum, ii., App., 107.

Prof. Soldan, Geschichte des Prot. in Frankreich,\r\ni. 512, 513, gives the details of the famous \"Contract of Poissy.\" It\r\nmust be admitted that both nobles and people were ready enough with\r\nplans for paying off the national indebtedness _out of the property of\r\nthe Church_. These generous economists found that, according to the\r\nancient customs, one-third of the ecclesiastical revenues ought to be\r\nemployed for the support of the clergy, one-third to be given to the\r\npoor, and the remaining third expended in keeping the sacred edifices in\r\nrepair. They proposed, therefore, to relieve the clergy of the latter\r\ntwo-thirds of their possessions, and apply them to the extinction of the\r\nroyal debt, assuming that the nation would maintain the churches in\r\nbetter condition, and feed the poor more effectively than had ever been\r\ndone hitherto!

It is said that, after hearing Beza's\r\nspeech of the ninth of September, the cardinal sought to obtain, through\r\nthe instrumentality of the Marshal de Vieilleville, at Metz, and his\r\nsalaried spy Rascalon, at Heidelberg, some decided Lutherans, to be\r\nemployed in bringing the Protestants at Poissy into contempt, through\r\nthe wrangling of their theologians with those of Germany. See the Hist.\r\necclés. des égl. réf., etc. Yet it is not improbable, as La Place,\r\nCommentaires, 200, seems to hint that Navarre's project was maliciously\r\ncountenanced by the Cardinal of Lorraine. But the circumstance that, of\r\nthe _five_ German theologians, not less than _two_ were opposed to the\r\nAugsburg Confession, proves conclusively that they could not have been\r\ndespatched with the view of helping the cardinal out in his attempt.\r\nBossuet's admiration of the prelate's sagacity, in thus seeking to give\r\na brilliant demonstration of the variations of doctrine among\r\nProtestants, certainly seems to be wasted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1182: _Ante_, c. xi., p. 493.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1183: See the list of the twenty members of the council, in\r\nRecueil des anc. lois franç., xiv. 55, 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1184: See Baum, ii. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1185: \"Affulserat aliqua spes concordiæ, sed Legatus\r\nPontificius, i. e., Cardinalis Ferrariensis omnia perturbavit.\" Letter\r\nof Martyr to the magistrates of Zurich, Oct. 17, 1561, Baum, ii., App.,\r\n108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1186: \"Quique ingenio, eloquentia, _artificio_ plurimum\r\nvalebat.\" Prosp.

When a \"holy friar\" was\r\npreaching before the court, his sermon \"being without salt,\" the hearers\r\nlaughed, the king played with his dog, Catharine went to sleep, and\r\nFerrara \"plucked down his cap.\" Same to same, Dec. 14, 1561, \"two\r\no'clock after midnight.\" This industrious correspondent, who employed\r\nthe small hours of the night in transmitting to the English ambassador\r\nhis master's secrets, confessed to Throkmorton that he had no belief in\r\nthe depth of Ferrara's assumed concern, having \"so marked the living of\r\npriests\" that he believed that \"whensoever they are sure to have the\r\nsame livings that they have without being troubled, they care not an the\r\nPope were hanged, with all his indulgences,\" Letter of Dec. 16, 1561.\r\nState Paper Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1238: Journal de Bruslart, Mém. de Condé, i. 60, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1239: Ibid., i. 65; a highly colored, partisan, and\r\nconsequently inaccurate account is given by Claude Haton, i. 214-221. T.\r\nShakerley, in his letter of Dec. 16th, relates the friar's interview\r\nwith Catharine, who, on seeing the fellow's boldness and the strength of\r\nhis popularity among the merchants of Paris (at least sixty of whom\r\nescorted him), easily accepted his disclaimers, told him \"she was much\r\ncontent to hear that his preaching was good, without giving trouble to\r\nthe people,\" and bade him \"go his way and preach and fear no harm, for\r\nit should always please her son and her that the people should be taught\r\nas in old time they had been preached unto.\" The intercession of the\r\nParisians, accompanied \"by offers of forty thousand crowns pledge of his\r\nforthcoming,\" Shakerley affirms, \"has given _such a blow to the\r\npreachers of the other side_ [the Huguenots] that there is _wonderful\r\nchange_.\" State Paper Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1240: \"Y quando leyó aquel passo de la letra (que si la reyna\r\nmadre no quisiesse el ayuda que se le offrescia, la darie V.

The congregation was unusually large, the\r\nday being the festival of St. John, and a holiday. The day before, the\r\nProtestants had for the first time been permitted to assemble on a\r\nfeast-day, and Beza himself had preached without interruption to crowded\r\naudiences at Popincourt and at the Patriarche.

Its object was clearly revealed by the haste with\r\nwhich the parliament despatched a messenger to St. Germain, to solicit\r\nthe king in council to revoke the permission heretofore granted the\r\nProtestants to meet in the suburbs of Paris.

It had been let to the\r\nProtestants by a merchant of Lucca, who was himself only a tenant. In\r\nthe ensuing summer the owner, moved by displeasure for the impiety of\r\nthe religious services it had witnessed, made a gift of the \"Patriarche\"\r\nto the parliament, asking that it might be employed for the relief of\r\nthe poor and other charitable purposes.

It is almost\r\nsuperfluous to add that the Roman Catholic and Protestant authorities\r\ndiffer widely in the coloring given to the event.
