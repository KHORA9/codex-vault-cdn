With the result before him, the reader\r\ncan judge for himself now whether or not I was right. Right or wrong,\r\nthe many and exacting duties of a newspaper man's life would hardly\r\nhave allowed me to bring it to an end but for frequent friendly lifts\r\ngiven me by willing hands. To the President of the Board of Health, Mr.\r\nCharles G. Wilson, and to Chief Inspector Byrnes of the Police Force I\r\nam indebted for much kindness. The patient friendship of Dr. Roger S.\r\nTracy, the Registrar of Vital Statistics, has done for me what I never\r\ncould have done for myself; for I know nothing of tables, statistics\r\nand percentages, while there is nothing about them that he does not\r\nknow. Most of all, I owe in this, as in all things else, to the womanly\r\nsympathy and the loving companionship of my dear wife, ever my chief\r\nhelper, my wisest counsellor, and my gentlest critic.\r\n\r\n                                                                J.

It did not know because it did\r\nnot care. The half that was on top cared little for the struggles,\r\nand less for the fate of those who were underneath, so long as it was\r\nable to hold them there and keep its own seat. There came a time when\r\nthe discomfort and crowding below were so great, and the consequent\r\nupheavals so violent, that it was no longer an easy thing to do, and\r\nthen the upper half fell to inquiring what was the matter. Information\r\non the subject has been accumulating rapidly since, and the whole world\r\nhas had its hands full answering for its old ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn New York, the youngest of the world's great cities, that time came\r\nlater than elsewhere, because the crowding had not been so great. There\r\nwere those who believed that it would never come; but their hopes were\r\nvain. Greed and reckless selfishness wrought like results here as in\r\nthe cities of older lands. \"When the great riot occurred in 1863,\" so\r\nreads the testimony of the Secretary of the Prison Association of New\r\nYork before a legislative committee appointed to investigate causes\r\nof the increase of crime in the State twenty-five years ago, \"every\r\nhiding-place and nursery of crime discovered itself by immediate and\r\nactive participation in the operations of the mob. Those very places\r\nand domiciles, and all that are like them, are to-day nurseries of\r\ncrime, and of the vices and disorderly courses which lead to crime.\r\nBy far the largest part--eighty per cent. at least--of crimes against\r\nproperty and against the person are perpetrated by individuals who\r\nhave either lost connection with home life, or never had any, or whose\r\n_homes had ceased to be sufficiently separate, decent, and desirable to\r\nafford what are regarded as ordinary wholesome influences of home and\r\nfamily_.... The younger criminals seem to come almost exclusively from\r\nthe worst tenement house districts, that is, when traced back to the\r\nvery places where they had their homes in the city here.\" Of one thing\r\nNew York made sure at that early stage of the inquiry: the boundary\r\nline of the Other Half lies through the tenements.\r\n\r\nIt is ten years and over, now, since that line divided New York's\r\npopulation evenly. To-day three-fourths of its people live in the\r\ntenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the\r\ncities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them. The fifteen\r\nthousand tenant houses that were the despair of the sanitarian in the\r\npast generation have swelled into thirty-seven thousand, and more than\r\ntwelve hundred thousand persons call them home. The one way out he\r\nsaw--rapid transit to the suburbs--has brought no relief. We know now\r\nthat there is no way out; that the \"system\" that was the evil offspring\r\nof public neglect and private greed has come to stay, a storm-centre\r\nforever of our civilization. Nothing is left but to make the best of a\r\nbad bargain.\r\n\r\nWhat the tenements are and how they grow to what they are, we shall\r\nsee hereafter. The story is dark enough, drawn from the plain public\r\nrecords, to send a chill to any heart. If it shall appear that the\r\nsufferings and the sins of the \"other half,\" and the evil they\r\nbreed, are but as a just punishment upon the community that gave it\r\nno other choice, it will be because that is the truth. The boundary\r\nline lies there because, while the forces for good on one side vastly\r\noutweigh the bad--it were not well otherwise--in the tenements all\r\nthe influences make for evil; because they are the hot-beds of the\r\nepidemics that carry death to rich and poor alike; the nurseries of\r\npauperism and crime that fill our jails and police courts; that throw\r\noff a scum of forty thousand human wrecks to the island asylums and\r\nworkhouses year by year; that turned out in the last eight years a\r\nround half million beggars to prey upon our charities; that maintain\r\na standing army of ten thousand tramps with all that that implies;\r\nbecause, above all, they touch the family life with deadly moral\r\ncontagion. This is their worst crime, inseparable from the system. That\r\nwe have to own it the child of our own wrong does not excuse it, even\r\nthough it gives it claim upon our utmost patience and tenderest charity.\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do about it? is the question of to-day. It was\r\nasked once of our city in taunting defiance by a band of political\r\ncutthroats, the legitimate outgrowth of life on the tenement-house\r\nlevel.[1] Law and order found the answer then and prevailed. With our\r\nenormously swelling population held in this galling bondage, will that\r\nanswer always be given? It will depend on how fully the situation that\r\nprompted the challenge is grasped. Forty per cent. of the distress\r\namong the poor, said a recent official report, is due to drunkenness.\r\nBut the first legislative committee ever appointed to probe this sore\r\nwent deeper down and uncovered its roots. The \"conclusion forced\r\nitself upon it that certain conditions and associations of human life\r\nand habitation are the prolific parents of corresponding habits and\r\nmorals,\" and it recommended \"the prevention of drunkenness by providing\r\nfor every man a clean and comfortable home.\" Years after, a sanitary\r\ninquiry brought to light the fact that \"more than one-half of the\r\ntenements with two-thirds of their population were held by owners\r\nwho made the keeping of them a business, _generally a speculation_.\r\nThe owner was seeking a certain percentage on his outlay, and that\r\npercentage very rarely fell below fifteen per cent., and frequently\r\nexceeded thirty.[2]... The complaint was universal among the tenants\r\nthat they were entirely uncared for, and that the only answer to their\r\nrequests to have the place put in order by repairs and necessary\r\nimprovements was that they must pay their rent or leave. The agent's\r\ninstructions were simple but emphatic: 'Collect the rent in advance,\r\nor, failing, eject the occupants.'\" Upon such a stock grew this\r\nupas-tree. Small wonder the fruit is bitter. The remedy that shall be\r\nan effective answer to the coming appeal for justice must proceed from\r\nthe public conscience. Neither legislation nor charity can cover the\r\nground. The greed of capital that wrought the evil must itself undo it,\r\nas far as it can now be undone. Homes must be built for the working\r\nmasses by those who employ their labor; but tenements must cease to be\r\n\"good property\" in the old, heartless sense. \"Philanthropy and five per\r\ncent.\" is the penance exacted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tweed was born and bred in a Fourth Ward tenement.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Forty per cent. was declared by witnesses before a Senate\r\nCommittee to be a fair average interest on tenement property. Instances\r\nwere given of its being one hundred per cent. and over.]\r\n\r\nIf this is true from a purely economic point of view, what then of the\r\noutlook from the Christian standpoint? Not long ago a great meeting was\r\nheld in this city, of all denominations of religious faith, to discuss\r\nthe question how to lay hold of these teeming masses in the tenements\r\nwith Christian influences, to which they are now too often strangers.\r\nMight not the conference have found in the warning of one Brooklyn\r\nbuilder, who has invested his capital on this plan and made it pay more\r\nthan a money interest, a hint worth heeding: \"How shall the love of\r\nGod be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the\r\ngreed of man?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELL'S KITCHEN AND SEBASTOPOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                        GENESIS OF THE TENEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first tenement New York knew bore the mark of Cain from its birth,\r\nthough a generation passed before the writing was deciphered. It was\r\nthe \"rear house,\" infamous ever after in our city's history. There had\r\nbeen tenant-houses before, but they were not built for the purpose.\r\nNothing would probably have shocked their original owners more than the\r\nidea of their harboring a promiscuous crowd; for they were the decorous\r\nhomes of the old Knickerbockers, the proud aristocracy of Manhattan in\r\nthe early days.\r\n\r\nIt was the stir and bustle of trade, together with the tremendous\r\nimmigration that followed upon the war of 1812 that dislodged them.\r\nIn thirty-five years the city of less than a hundred thousand came to\r\nharbor half a million souls, for whom homes had to be found. Within the\r\nmemory of men not yet in their prime, Washington had moved from his\r\nhouse on Cherry Hill as too far out of town to be easily reached. Now\r\nthe old residents followed his example; but they moved in a different\r\ndirection and for a different reason. Their comfortable dwellings in\r\nthe once fashionable streets along the East River front fell into the\r\nhands of real-estate agents and boarding-house keepers; and here,\r\nsays the report to the Legislature of 1857, when the evils engendered\r\nhad excited just alarm, \"in its beginning, the tenant-house became a\r\nreal blessing to that class of industrious poor whose small earnings\r\nlimited their expenses, and whose employment in workshops, stores,\r\nor about the warehouses and thoroughfares, render a near residence\r\nof much importance.\" Not for long, however. As business increased,\r\nand the city grew with rapid strides, the necessities of the poor\r\nbecame the opportunity of their wealthier neighbors, and the stamp\r\nwas set upon the old houses, suddenly become valuable, which the best\r\nthought and effort of a later age has vainly struggled to efface.\r\nTheir \"_large_ rooms were partitioned into _several smaller ones_,\r\nwithout regard to light or ventilation, the rate of rent being lower\r\nin proportion to space or height from the street; and they soon became\r\nfilled from cellar to garret with a class of tenantry living from\r\nhand to mouth, loose in morals, improvident in habits, degraded, and\r\nsqualid as beggary itself.\" It was thus the dark bedroom, prolific of\r\nuntold depravities, came into the world. It was destined to survive\r\nthe old houses. In their new rôle, says the old report, eloquent in\r\nits indignant denunciation of \"evils more destructive than wars,\"\r\n\"they were not intended to last. Rents were fixed high enough to cover\r\ndamage and abuse from this class, from whom nothing was expected,\r\nand the most was made of them while they lasted. Neatness, order,\r\ncleanliness, were never dreamed of in connection with the tenant-house\r\nsystem, as it spread its localities from year to year; while reckless\r\nslovenliness, discontent, privation, and ignorance were left to work\r\nout their invariable results, until the entire premises reached the\r\nlevel of tenant-house dilapidation, containing, but sheltering not,\r\nthe miserable hordes that crowded beneath smouldering, water-rotted\r\nroofs or burrowed among the rats of clammy cellars.\" Yet so illogical\r\nis human greed that, at a later day, when called to account, \"the\r\nproprietors frequently urged the filthy habits of the tenants as an\r\nexcuse for the condition of their property, utterly losing sight of the\r\nfact that it was the tolerance of those habits which was the real evil,\r\nand that for this they themselves were alone responsible.\"\r\n\r\nStill the pressure of the crowds did not abate, and in the old garden\r\nwhere the stolid Dutch burgher grew his tulips or early cabbages a\r\nrear house was built, generally of wood, two stories high at first.\r\nPresently it was carried up another story, and another. Where two\r\nfamilies had lived ten moved in. The front house followed suit, if the\r\nbrick walls were strong enough. The question was not always asked,\r\njudging from complaints made by a contemporary witness, that the old\r\nbuildings were \"often carried up to a great height without regard to\r\nthe strength of the foundation walls.\" It was rent the owner was after;\r\nnothing was said in the contract about either the safety or the comfort\r\nof the tenants. The garden gate no longer swung on its rusty hinges.\r\nThe shell-paved walk had become an alley; what the rear house had left\r\nof the garden, a \"court.\" Plenty such are yet to be found in the Fourth\r\nWard, with here and there one of the original rear tenements.\r\n\r\nWorse was to follow. It was \"soon perceived by estate owners and agents\r\nof property that a greater percentage of profits could be realized\r\nby the conversion of houses and blocks into barracks, and dividing\r\ntheir space into smaller proportions capable of containing human life\r\nwithin four walls.... Blocks were rented of real estate owners, or\r\n'purchased on time,' or taken in charge at a percentage, and held\r\nfor under-letting.\" With the appearance of the middleman, wholly\r\nirresponsible, and utterly reckless and unrestrained, began the era of\r\ntenement building which turned out such blocks as Gotham Court, where,\r\nin one cholera epidemic that scarcely touched the clean wards, the\r\ntenants died at the rate of one hundred and ninety-five to the thousand\r\nof population; which forced the general mortality of the city up from\r\n1 in 41.83 in 1815, to 1 in 27.33 in 1855, a year of unusual freedom\r\nfrom epidemic disease, and which wrung from the early organizers of\r\nthe Health Department this wail: \"There are numerous examples of\r\ntenement-houses in which are lodged several hundred people that have a\r\n_pro rata_ allotment of ground area scarcely equal to two square yards\r\nupon the city lot, court-yards and all included.\" The tenement-house\r\npopulation had swelled to half a million souls by that time, and on the\r\nEast Side, in what is still the most densely populated district in all\r\nthe world, China not excluded, it was packed at the rate of 290,000\r\nto the square mile, a state of affairs wholly unexampled. The utmost\r\ncupidity of other lands and other days had never contrived to herd much\r\nmore than half that number within the same space. The greatest crowding\r\nof Old London was at the rate of 175,816. Swine roamed the streets and\r\ngutters as their principal scavengers.[3] The death of a child in a\r\ntenement was registered at the Bureau of Vital Statistics as \"plainly\r\ndue to suffocation in the foul air of an unventilated apartment,\" and\r\nthe Senators, who had come down from Albany to find out what was the\r\nmatter with New York, reported that \"there are annually cut off from\r\nthe population by disease and death enough human beings to people a\r\ncity, and enough human labor to sustain it.\" And yet experts had\r\ntestified that, as compared with uptown, rents were from twenty-five\r\nto thirty per cent. higher in the worst slums of the lower wards, with\r\nsuch accommodations as were enjoyed, for instance, by a \"family with\r\nboarders\" in Cedar Street, who fed hogs in the cellar that contained\r\neight or ten loads of manure; or \"one room 12 × 12 with five families\r\nliving in it, comprising twenty persons of both sexes and all ages,\r\nwith only two beds, without partition, screen, chair, or table.\" The\r\nrate of rent has been successfully maintained to the present day,\r\nthough the hog at least has been eliminated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It was not until the winter of 1867 that owners of swine\r\nwere prohibited by ordinance from letting them run at large in the\r\nbuilt-up portions of the city.]\r\n\r\nLest anybody flatter himself with the notion that these were evils of\r\na day that is happily past and may safely be forgotten, let me mention\r\nhere three very recent instances of tenement-house life that came under\r\nmy notice. One was the burning of a rear house in Mott Street, from\r\nappearances one of the original tenant-houses that made their owners\r\nrich. The fire made homeless ten families, who had paid an average of\r\n$5 a month for their mean little cubby-holes. The owner himself told\r\nme that it was _fully_ insured for $800, though it brought him in\r\n$600 a year rent. He evidently considered himself especially entitled\r\nto be pitied for losing such valuable property. Another was the case\r\nof a hard-working family of man and wife, young people from the old\r\ncountry, who took poison together in a Crosby Street tenement because\r\nthey were \"tired.\" There was no other explanation, and none was needed\r\nwhen I stood in the room in which they had lived. It was in the attic\r\nwith sloping ceiling and a single window so far out on the roof that\r\nit seemed not to belong to the place at all. With scarcely room enough\r\nto turn around in they had been compelled to pay five dollars and a\r\nhalf a month in advance. There were four such rooms in that attic, and\r\ntogether they brought in as much as many a handsome little cottage, in\r\na pleasant part of Brooklyn. The third instance was that of a colored\r\nfamily of husband, wife, and baby in a wretched rear rookery in West\r\nThird Street. Their rent was eight dollars and a half for a single room\r\non the top-story, so small that I was unable to get a photograph of it\r\neven by placing the camera outside the open door. Three short steps\r\nacross either way would have measured its full extent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TENEMENT OF 1863, FOR TWELVE FAMILIES ON EACH FLAT.[4]\r\n                 D, dark. L, light. H, halls.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This \"unventilated and fever-breeding structure\" the year\r\nafter it was built was picked out by the Council of Hygiene, then just\r\norganized, and presented to the Citizens' Association of New York as a\r\nspecimen \"multiple domicile\" in a desirable street, with the following\r\ncomment: \"Here are twelve living-rooms and twenty-one bedrooms, and\r\nonly six of the latter have any provision or possibility for the\r\nadmission of light and air, excepting through the family sitting-\r\nand living-room; being utterly dark, close, and unventilated. The\r\nliving-rooms are but 10 × 12 feet; the bedrooms 6½ × 7 feet.\"]\r\n\r\nThere was just one excuse for the early tenement-house builders, and\r\ntheir successors may plead it with nearly as good right for what it\r\nis worth. \"Such,\" says an official report, \"is the lack of house-room\r\nin the city that any kind of tenement can be immediately crowded with\r\nlodgers, if there is space offered.\" Thousands were living in cellars.\r\nThere were three hundred underground lodging-houses in the city when\r\nthe Health Department was organized. Some fifteen years before that the\r\nold Baptist Church in Mulberry Street, just off Chatham Street, had\r\nbeen sold, and the rear half of the frame structure had been converted\r\ninto tenements that with their swarming population became the scandal\r\neven of that reckless age. The wretched pile harbored no less than\r\nforty families, and the annual rate of deaths to the population was\r\nofficially stated to be 75 in 1,000. These tenements were an extreme\r\ntype of very many, for the big barracks had by this time spread east\r\nand west and far up the island into the sparsely settled wards. Whether\r\nor not the title was clear to the land upon which they were built was\r\nof less account than that the rents were collected. If there were\r\ndamages to pay, the tenant had to foot them. Cases were \"very frequent\r\nwhen property was in litigation, and two or three different parties\r\nwere collecting rents.\" Of course under such circumstances \"no repairs\r\nwere ever made.\"\r\n\r\nThe climax had been reached. The situation was summed up by the Society\r\nfor the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor in these words: \"Crazy\r\nold buildings, crowded rear tenements in filthy yards, dark, damp\r\nbasements, leaking garrets, shops, outhouses, and stables[5] converted\r\ninto dwellings, though scarcely fit to shelter brutes, are habitations\r\nof thousands of our fellow-beings in this wealthy, Christian city.\"\r\n\"The city,\" says its historian, Mrs. Martha Lamb, commenting on the\r\nera of aqueduct building between 1835 and 1845, \"was a general asylum\r\nfor vagrants.\" Young vagabonds, the natural offspring of such \"home\"\r\nconditions, overran the streets. Juvenile crime increased fearfully\r\nyear by year. The Children's Aid Society and kindred philanthropic\r\norganizations were yet unborn, but in the city directory was to be\r\nfound the address of the \"American Society for the Promotion of\r\nEducation in Africa.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"A lot 50 × 60, contained twenty stables, rented for\r\ndwellings at $15 a year each; cost of the whole $600.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                             THE AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dread of advancing cholera, with the guilty knowledge of the\r\nharvest field that awaited the plague in New York's slums, pricked the\r\nconscience of the community into action soon after the close of the\r\nwar. A citizens' movement resulted in the organization of a Board of\r\nHealth and the adoption of the \"Tenement-House Act\" of 1867, the first\r\nstep toward remedial legislation. A thorough canvass of the tenements\r\nhad been begun already in the previous year; but the cholera first,\r\nand next a scourge of small-pox, delayed the work, while emphasizing\r\nthe need of it, so that it was 1869 before it got fairly under way and\r\nbegan to tell. The dark bedroom fell under the ban first. In that year\r\nthe Board ordered the cutting of more than forty-six thousand windows\r\nin interior rooms, chiefly for ventilation--for little or no light was\r\nto be had from the dark hallways. Air-shafts were unknown. The saw\r\nhad a job all that summer; by early fall nearly all the orders had\r\nbeen carried out. Not without opposition; obstacles were thrown in the\r\nway of the officials on the one side by the owners of the tenements,\r\nwho saw in every order to repair or clean up only an item of added\r\nexpense to diminish their income from the rent; on the other side by\r\nthe tenants themselves, who had sunk, after a generation of unavailing\r\nprotest, to the level of their surroundings, and were at last content\r\nto remain there. The tenements had bred their Nemesis, a proletariat\r\nready and able to avenge the wrongs of their crowds. Already it taxed\r\nthe city heavily for the support of its jails and charities. The basis\r\nof opposition, curiously enough, was the same at both extremes; owner\r\nand tenant alike considered official interference an infringement of\r\npersonal rights, and a hardship. It took long years of weary labor to\r\nmake good the claim of the sunlight to such corners of the dens as\r\nit could reach at all. Not until five years after did the department\r\nsucceed at last in ousting the \"cave-dwellers\" and closing some five\r\nhundred and fifty cellars south of Houston Street, many of them below\r\ntide-water, that had been used as living apartments. In many instances\r\nthe police had to drag the tenants out by force.\r\n\r\nThe work went on; but the need of it only grew with the effort. The\r\nSanitarians were following up an evil that grew faster than they went;\r\nlike a fire, it could only be headed off, not chased, with success.\r\nOfficial reports, read in the churches in 1879, characterized the\r\nyounger criminals as victims of low social conditions of life and\r\nunhealthy, overcrowded lodgings, brought up in \"an atmosphere of actual\r\ndarkness, moral and physical.\" This after the saw had been busy in the\r\ndark corners ten years! \"If we could see the air breathed by these\r\npoor creatures in their tenements,\" said a well-known physician, \"it\r\nwould show itself to be fouler than the mud of the gutters.\" Little\r\nimprovement was apparent despite all that had been done. \"The new\r\ntenements, that have been recently built, have been usually as badly\r\nplanned as the old, with dark and unhealthy rooms, often over wet\r\ncellars, where extreme overcrowding is permitted,\" was the verdict\r\nof one authority. These are the houses that to-day perpetuate the\r\nworst traditions of the past, and they are counted by thousands. The\r\nFive Points had been cleansed, as far as the immediate neighborhood\r\nwas concerned, but the Mulberry Street Bend was fast outdoing it in\r\nfoulness not a stone's throw away, and new centres of corruption were\r\ncontinually springing up and getting the upper hand whenever vigilance\r\nwas relaxed for ever so short a time. It is one of the curses of the\r\ntenement-house system that the worst houses exercise a levelling\r\ninfluence upon all the rest, just as one bad boy in a schoolroom will\r\nspoil the whole class. It is one of the ways the evil that was \"the\r\nresult of forgetfulness of the poor,\" as the Council of Hygiene mildly\r\nput it, has of avenging itself.\r\n\r\nThe determined effort to head it off by laying a strong hand upon the\r\ntenement builders that has been the chief business of the Health Board\r\nof recent years, dates from this period. The era of the air-shaft has\r\nnot solved the problem of housing the poor, but it has made good use of\r\nlimited opportunities. Over the new houses sanitary law exercises full\r\ncontrol. But the old remain. They cannot be summarily torn down, though\r\nin extreme cases the authorities can order them cleared. The outrageous\r\novercrowding, too, remains. It is characteristic of the tenements.\r\nPoverty, their badge and typical condition, invites--compels it. All\r\nefforts to abate it result only in temporary relief. As long as they\r\nexist it will exist with them. And the tenements will exist in New York\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TENEMENT OF THE OLD STYLE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BIRTH OF THE AIR-SHAFT.]\r\n\r\nTo-day, what is a tenement? The law defines it as a house \"occupied by\r\nthree or more families, living independently and doing their cooking\r\non the premises; or by more than two families on a floor, so living\r\nand cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways,\r\nyards, etc.\" That is the legal meaning, and includes flats and\r\napartment-houses, with which we have nothing to do. In its narrower\r\nsense the typical tenement was thus described when last arraigned\r\nbefore the bar of public justice: \"It is generally a brick building\r\nfrom four to six stories high on the street, frequently with a store\r\non the first floor which, when used for the sale of liquor, has a\r\nside opening for the benefit of the inmates and to evade the Sunday\r\nlaw; four families occupy each floor, and a set of rooms consists of\r\none or two dark closets, used as bedrooms, with a living room twelve\r\nfeet by ten. The staircase is too often a dark well in the centre of\r\nthe house, and no direct through ventilation is possible, each family\r\nbeing separated from the other by partitions. Frequently the rear of\r\nthe lot is occupied by another building of three stories, high with\r\ntwo families on a floor.\" The picture is nearly as true to-day as ten\r\nyears ago, and will be for a long time to come. The dim light admitted\r\nby the air-shaft shines upon greater crowds than ever. Tenements are\r\nstill \"good property,\" and the poverty of the poor man his destruction.\r\nA barrack down town where he _has to live_ because he is poor brings\r\nin a third more rent than a decent flat house in Harlem. The statement\r\nonce made a sensation that between seventy and eighty children had been\r\nfound in one tenement. It no longer excites even passing attention,\r\nwhen the sanitary police report counting 101 adults and 91 children in\r\na Crosby Street house, one of twins, built together. The children in\r\nthe other, if I am not mistaken, numbered 89, a total of 180 for two\r\ntenements! Or when a midnight inspection in Mulberry Street unearths a\r\nhundred and fifty \"lodgers\" sleeping on filthy floors in two buildings.\r\nSpite of brown-stone trimmings, plate-glass and mosaic vestibule\r\nfloors, the water does not rise in summer to the second story, while\r\nthe beer flows unchecked to the all-night picnics on the roof. The\r\nsaloon with the side-door and the landlord divide the prosperity of the\r\nplace between them, and the tenant, in sullen submission, foots the\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nWhere are the tenements of to-day? Say rather: where are they not?\r\nIn fifty years they have crept up from the Fourth Ward slums and the\r\nFive Points the whole length of the island, and have polluted the\r\nAnnexed District to the Westchester line. Crowding all the lower wards,\r\nwherever business leaves a foot of ground unclaimed; strung along both\r\nrivers, like ball and chain tied to the foot of every street, and\r\nfilling up Harlem with their restless, pent-up multitudes, they hold\r\nwithin their clutch the wealth and business of New York, hold them\r\nat their mercy in the day of mob-rule and wrath. The bullet-proof\r\nshutters, the stacks of hand-grenades, and the Gatling guns of the\r\nSub-Treasury are tacit admissions of the fact and of the quality of\r\nthe mercy expected. The tenements to-day are New York, harboring\r\nthree-fourths of its population. When another generation shall have\r\ndoubled the census of our city, and to that vast army of workers, held\r\ncaptive by poverty, the very name of home shall be as a bitter mockery,\r\nwhat will the harvest be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                            THE MIXED CROWD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen once I asked the agent of a notorious Fourth Ward alley how\r\nmany people might be living in it I was told: One hundred and forty\r\nfamilies, one hundred Irish, thirty-eight Italian, and two that\r\nspoke the German tongue. Barring the agent herself, there was not a\r\nnative-born individual in the court. The answer was characteristic of\r\nthe cosmopolitan character of lower New York, very nearly so of the\r\nwhole of it, wherever it runs to alleys and courts. One may find for\r\nthe asking an Italian, a German, a French, African, Spanish, Bohemian,\r\nRussian, Scandinavian, Jewish, and Chinese colony. Even the Arab, who\r\npeddles \"holy earth\" from the Battery as a direct importation from\r\nJerusalem, has his exclusive preserves at the lower end of Washington\r\nStreet. The one thing you shall vainly ask for in the chief city of\r\nAmerica is a distinctively American community. There is none; certainly\r\nnot among the tenements. Where have they gone to, the old inhabitants?\r\nI put the question to one who might fairly be presumed to be of the\r\nnumber, since I had found him sighing for the \"good old days\" when the\r\nlegend \"no Irish need apply\" was familiar in the advertising columns\r\nof the newspapers. He looked at me with a puzzled air. \"I don't know,\"\r\nhe said. \"I wish I did. Some went to California in '49, some to the\r\nwar and never came back. The rest, I expect, have gone to heaven, or\r\nsomewhere. I don't see them 'round here.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever the merit of the good man's conjectures, his eyes did not\r\ndeceive him. They are not here. In their place has come this queer\r\nconglomerate mass of heterogeneous elements, ever striving and working\r\nlike whiskey and water in one glass, and with the like result: final\r\nunion and a prevailing taint of whiskey. The once unwelcome Irishman\r\nhas been followed in his turn by the Italian, the Russian Jew, and the\r\nChinaman, and has himself taken a hand at opposition, quite as bitter\r\nand quite as ineffectual, against these later hordes. Wherever these\r\nhave gone they have crowded him out, possessing the block, the street,\r\nthe ward with their denser swarms. But the Irishman's revenge is\r\ncomplete. Victorious in defeat over his recent as over his more ancient\r\nfoe, the one who opposed his coming no less than the one who drove him\r\nout, he dictates to both their politics, and, secure in possession\r\nof the offices, returns the native his greeting with interest, while\r\ncollecting the rents of the Italian whose house he has bought with the\r\nprofits of his saloon. As a landlord he is picturesquely autocratic.\r\nAn amusing instance of his methods came under my notice while writing\r\nthese lines. An inspector of the Health Department found an Italian\r\nfamily paying a man with a Celtic name twenty-five dollars a month\r\nfor three small rooms in a ramshackle rear tenement--more than twice\r\nwhat they were worth--and expressed his astonishment to the tenant,\r\nan ignorant Sicilian laborer. He replied that he had once asked the\r\nlandlord to reduce the rent, but he would not do it.\r\n\r\n\"Well! What did he say?\" asked the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"'Damma, man!' he said; 'if you speaka thata way to me, I fira you and\r\nyour things in the streeta.'\" And the frightened Italian paid the rent.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Irish landlord it must be said that like an apt\r\npupil he was merely showing forth the result of the schooling he had\r\nreceived, re-enacting, in his own way, the scheme of the tenements.\r\nIt is only his frankness that shocks. The Irishman does not naturally\r\ntake kindly to tenement life, though with characteristic versatility\r\nhe adapts himself to its conditions at once. It does violence,\r\nnevertheless, to the best that is in him, and for that very reason of\r\nall who come within its sphere soonest corrupts him. The result is a\r\nsediment, the product of more than a generation in the city's slums,\r\nthat, as distinguished from the larger body of his class, justly ranks\r\nat the foot of tenement dwellers, the so-called \"low Irish.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be assumed, of course, that the whole body of the\r\npopulation living in the tenements, of which New Yorkers are in the\r\nhabit of speaking vaguely as \"the poor,\" or even the larger part of\r\nit, is to be classed as vicious or as poor in the sense of verging on\r\nbeggary.\r\n\r\nNew York's wage-earners have no other place to live, more is the pity.\r\nThey are truly poor for having no better homes; waxing poorer in purse\r\nas the exorbitant rents to which they are tied, as ever was serf to\r\nsoil, keep rising. The wonder is that they are not all corrupted, and\r\nspeedily, by their surroundings. If, on the contrary, there be a steady\r\nworking up, if not out of the slough, the fact is a powerful argument\r\nfor the optimist's belief that the world is, after all, growing better,\r\nnot worse, and would go far toward disarming apprehension, were it not\r\nfor the steadier growth of the sediment of the slums and its constant\r\nmenace. Such an impulse toward better things there certainly is. The\r\nGerman rag-picker of thirty years ago, quite as low in the scale as\r\nhis Italian successor, is the thrifty tradesman or prosperous farmer of\r\nto-day.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The Sheriff Street Colony of rag-pickers, long since gone,\r\nis an instance in point. The thrifty Germans saved up money during\r\nyears of hard work in squalor and apparently wretched poverty to buy a\r\ntownship in a Western State, and the whole colony moved out there in a\r\nbody. There need be no doubt about their thriving there.]\r\n\r\nThe Italian scavenger of our time is fast graduating into exclusive\r\ncontrol of the corner fruit-stands, while his black-eyed boy\r\nmonopolizes the boot-blacking industry in which a few years ago he was\r\nan intruder. The Irish hod-carrier in the second generation has become\r\na brick-layer, if not the Alderman of his ward, while the Chinese\r\ncoolie is in almost exclusive possession of the laundry business. The\r\nreason is obvious. The poorest immigrant comes here with the purpose\r\nand ambition to better himself and, given half a chance, might be\r\nreasonably expected to make the most of it. To the false plea that he\r\nprefers the squalid homes in which his kind are housed there could\r\nbe no better answer. The truth is, his half chance has too long been\r\nwanting, and for the bad result he has been unjustly blamed.\r\n\r\nAs emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the\r\nforeign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined\r\nlines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more\r\ngregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business. A feeling\r\nof dependence upon mutual effort, natural to strangers in a strange\r\nland, unacquainted with its language and customs, sufficiently accounts\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman is the true cosmopolitan immigrant. All-pervading, he\r\nshares his lodging with perfect impartiality with the Italian, the\r\nGreek, and the \"Dutchman,\" yielding only to sheer force of numbers,\r\nand objects equally to them all. A map of the city, colored to\r\ndesignate nationalities, would show more stripes than on the skin of\r\na zebra, and more colors than any rainbow. The city on such a map\r\nwould fall into two great halves, green for the Irish prevailing in\r\nthe West Side tenement districts, and blue for the Germans on the\r\nEast Side. But intermingled with these ground colors would be an\r\nodd variety of tints that would give the whole the appearance of an\r\nextraordinary crazy-quilt. From down in the Sixth Ward, upon the site\r\nof the old Collect Pond that in the days of the fathers drained the\r\nhills which are no more, the red of the Italian would be seen forcing\r\nits way northward along the line of Mulberry Street to the quarter of\r\nthe French purple on Bleecker Street and South Fifth Avenue, to lose\r\nitself and reappear, after a lapse of miles, in the \"Little Italy\" of\r\nHarlem, east of Second Avenue. Dashes of red, sharply defined, would\r\nbe seen strung through the Annexed District, northward to the city\r\nline. On the West Side the red would be seen overrunning the old Africa\r\nof Thompson Street, pushing the black of the negro rapidly uptown,\r\nagainst querulous but unavailing protests, occupying his home, his\r\nchurch, his trade and all, with merciless impartiality. There is a\r\nchurch in Mulberry Street that has stood for two generations as a sort\r\nof milestone of these migrations. Built originally for the worship of\r\nstaid New Yorkers of the \"old stock,\" it was engulfed by the colored\r\ntide, when the draft-riots drove the negroes out of reach of Cherry\r\nStreet and the Five Points. Within the past decade the advance wave\r\nof the Italian onset reached it, and to-day the arms of United Italy\r\nadorn its front. The negroes have made a stand at several points along\r\nSeventh and Eighth Avenues; but their main body, still pursued by the\r\nItalian foe, is on the march yet, and the black mark will be found\r\novershadowing to-day many blocks on the East Side, with One Hundredth\r\nStreet as the centre, where colonies of them have settled recently.\r\n\r\nHardly less aggressive than the Italian, the Russian and Polish Jew,\r\nhaving overrun the district between Rivington and Division Streets,\r\neast of the Bowery, to the point of suffocation, is filling the\r\ntenements of the old Seventh Ward to the river front, and disputing\r\nwith the Italian every foot of available space in the back alleys of\r\nMulberry Street. The two races, differing hopelessly in much, have\r\nthis in common: they carry their slums with them wherever they go, if\r\nallowed to do it. Little Italy already rivals its parent, the \"Bend,\"\r\nin foulness. Other nationalities that begin at the bottom make a fresh\r\nstart when crowded up the ladder. Happily both are manageable, the one\r\nby rabbinical, the other by the civil law. Between the dull gray of the\r\nJew, his favorite color, and the Italian red, would be seen squeezed\r\nin on the map a sharp streak of yellow, marking the narrow boundaries\r\nof Chinatown. Dovetailed in with the German population, the poor but\r\nthrifty Bohemian might be picked out by the sombre hue of his life\r\nas of his philosophy, struggling against heavy odds in the big human\r\nbee-hives of the East Side. Colonies of his people extend northward,\r\nwith long lapses of space, from below the Cooper Institute more than\r\nthree miles. The Bohemian is the only foreigner with any considerable\r\nrepresentation in the city who counts no wealthy man of his race, none\r\nwho has not to work hard for a living, or has got beyond the reach of\r\nthe tenement.\r\n\r\nDown near the Battery the West Side emerald would be soiled by a\r\ndirty stain, spreading rapidly like a splash of ink on a sheet of\r\nblotting paper, headquarters of the Arab tribe, that in a single\r\nyear has swelled from the original dozen to twelve hundred, intent,\r\nevery mother's son, on trade and barter. Dots and dashes of color\r\nhere and there would show where the Finnish sailors worship their\r\ndjumala (God), the Greek pedlars the ancient name of their race, and\r\nthe Swiss the goddess of thrift. And so on to the end of the long\r\nregister, all toiling together in the galling fetters of the tenement.\r\nWere the question raised who makes the most of life thus mortgaged,\r\nwho resists most stubbornly its levelling tendency--knows how to drag\r\neven the barracks upward a part of the way at least toward the ideal\r\nplane of the home--the palm must be unhesitatingly awarded the Teuton.\r\nThe Italian and the poor Jew rise only by compulsion. The Chinaman\r\ndoes not rise at all; here, as at home, he simply remains stationary.\r\nThe Irishman's genius runs to public affairs rather than domestic\r\nlife; wherever he is mustered in force the saloon is the gorgeous\r\ncentre of political activity. The German struggles vainly to learn\r\nhis trick; his Teutonic wit is too heavy, and the political ladder he\r\nraises from his saloon usually too short or too clumsy to reach the\r\ndesired goal. The best part of his life is lived at home, and he makes\r\nhimself a home independent of the surroundings, giving the lie to the\r\nsaying, unhappily become a maxim of social truth, that pauperism and\r\ndrunkenness naturally grow in the tenements. He makes the most of his\r\ntenement, and it should be added that whenever and as soon as he can\r\nsave up money enough, he gets out and never crosses the threshold of\r\none again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                       THE DOWN TOWN BACK-ALLEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown below Chatham Square, in the old Fourth Ward, where the cradle\r\nof the tenement stood, we shall find New York's Other Half at home,\r\nreceiving such as care to call and are not afraid. Not all of it,\r\nto be sure, there is not room for that; but a fairly representative\r\ngathering, representative of its earliest and worst traditions. There\r\nis nothing to be afraid of. In this metropolis, let it be understood,\r\nthere is no public street where the stranger may not go safely by day\r\nand by night, provided he knows how to mind his own business and is\r\nsober. His coming and going will excite little interest, unless he is\r\nsuspected of being a truant officer, in which case he will be impressed\r\nwith the truth of the observation that the American stock is dying out\r\nfor want of children. If he escapes this suspicion and the risk of\r\ntrampling upon, or being himself run down by the bewildering swarms of\r\nyoungsters that are everywhere or nowhere as the exigency and their\r\nquick scent of danger direct, he will see no reason for dissenting\r\nfrom that observation. Glimpses caught of the parents watching the\r\nyoungsters play from windows or open doorways will soon convince him\r\nthat the native stock is in no way involved.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Elevated Railroad where it dives under the Brooklyn Bridge\r\nat Franklin Square, scarce a dozen steps will take us where we wish to\r\ngo. With its rush and roar echoing yet in our ears, we have turned\r\nthe corner from prosperity to poverty. We stand upon the domain of\r\nthe tenement. In the shadow of the great stone abutments the old\r\nKnickerbocker houses linger like ghosts of a departed day. Down the\r\nwinding slope of Cherry Street--proud and fashionable Cherry Hill that\r\nwas--their broad steps, sloping roofs, and dormer windows are easily\r\nmade out; all the more easily for the contrast with the ugly barracks\r\nthat elbow them right and left. These never had other design than to\r\nshelter, at as little outlay as possible, the greatest crowds out\r\nof which rent could be wrung. They were the bad after-thought of a\r\nheedless day. The years have brought to the old houses unhonored age,\r\na querulous second childhood that is out of tune with the time, their\r\ntenants, the neighbors, and cries out against them and against you in\r\nfretful protest in every step on their rotten floors or squeaky stairs.\r\nGood cause have they for their fretting. This one, with its shabby\r\nfront and poorly patched roof, what glowing firesides, what happy\r\nchildren may it once have owned? Heavy feet, too often with unsteady\r\nstep, for the pot-house is next door--where is it not next door in\r\nthese slums?--have worn away the brown-stone steps since; the broken\r\ncolumns at the door have rotted away at the base. Of the handsome\r\ncornice barely a trace is left. Dirt and desolation reign in the wide\r\nhallway, and danger lurks on the stairs. Rough pine boards fence off\r\nthe roomy fire-places--where coal is bought by the pail at the rate of\r\ntwelve dollars a ton these have no place. The arched gateway leads no\r\nlonger to a shady bower on the banks of the rushing stream, inviting to\r\nday-dreams with its gentle repose, but to a dark and nameless alley,\r\nshut in by high brick walls, cheerless as the lives of those they\r\nshelter. The wolf knocks loudly at the gate in the troubled dreams\r\nthat come to this alley, echoes of the day's cares. A horde of dirty\r\nchildren play about the dripping hydrant, the only thing in the alley\r\nthat thinks enough of its chance to make the most of it: it is the\r\nbest it can do. These are the children of the tenements, the growing\r\ngeneration of the slums; this their home. From the great highway\r\noverhead, along which throbs the life-tide of two great cities, one\r\nmight drop a pebble into half a dozen such alleys.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AT THE CRADLE OF THE TENEMENT.--DOORWAY OF AN\r\n                 OLD-FASHIONED DWELLING ON CHERRY HILL.]\r\n\r\nOne yawns just across the street; not very broadly, but it is not\r\nto blame. The builder of the old gateway had no thought of its ever\r\nbecoming a public thoroughfare. Once inside it widens, but only to\r\nmake room for a big box-like building with the worn and greasy look\r\nof the slum tenement that is stamped alike on the houses and their\r\ntenants down here, even on the homeless cur that romps with the\r\nchildren in yonder building lot, with an air of expectant interest\r\nplainly betraying the forlorn hope that at some stage of the game a\r\nmeat-bone may show up in the role of \"It.\" Vain hope, truly! Nothing\r\nmore appetizing than a bare-legged ragamuffin appears. Meat-bones,\r\nnot long since picked clean, are as scarce in Blind Man's Alley as\r\nelbow-room in any Fourth Ward back-yard. The shouts of the children\r\ncome hushed over the house-tops, as if apologizing for the intrusion.\r\nFew glad noises make this old alley ring. Morning and evening it echoes\r\nwith the gentle, groping tap of the blind man's staff as he feels his\r\nway to the street. Blind Man's Alley bears its name for a reason.\r\nUntil little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony\r\nof blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom\r\nevery child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President\r\nof the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once\r\nfour hundred thousand dollars--out of his alley and the surrounding\r\ntenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in\r\nthe end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had\r\nstubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even\r\nwhen the Board of Health at last compelled him to repair and clean\r\nup the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the\r\ntenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished\r\nagainst the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the\r\nBoard to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic.\r\n\r\n\"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in\r\nCalvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless,\r\nand now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of\r\nangry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned?\r\nThese people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where\r\nthey can, and let my house stand.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing\r\nto find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of\r\nluxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder.\r\nHe knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy\r\nhad gauged his tenants correctly. The cleaning up process apparently\r\ndestroyed the home-feeling of the alley; many of the blind people moved\r\naway and did not return. Some remained, however, and the name has clung\r\nto the place.\r\n\r\nSome idea of what is meant by a sanitary \"cleaning up\" in these slums\r\nmay be gained from the account of a mishap I met with once, in taking a\r\nflash-light picture of a group of blind beggars in one of the tenements\r\ndown here. With unpractised hands I managed to set fire to the house.\r\nWhen the blinding effect of the flash had passed away and I could see\r\nonce more, I discovered that a lot of paper and rags that hung on the\r\nwall were ablaze. There were six of us, five blind men and women who\r\nknew nothing of their danger, and myself, in an attic room with a\r\ndozen crooked, rickety stairs between us and the street, and as many\r\nhouseholds as helpless as the one whose guest I was all about us. The\r\nthought: how were they ever to be got out? made my blood run cold as I\r\nsaw the flames creeping up the wall, and my first impulse was to bolt\r\nfor the street and shout for help. The next was to smother the fire\r\nmyself, and I did, with a vast deal of trouble. Afterward, when I came\r\ndown to the street I told a friendly policeman of my trouble. For some\r\nreason he thought it rather a good joke, and laughed immoderately at my\r\nconcern lest even then sparks should be burrowing in the rotten wall\r\nthat might yet break out in flame and destroy the house with all that\r\nwere in it. He told me why, when he found time to draw breath. \"Why,\r\ndon't you know,\" he said, \"that house is the Dirty Spoon? It caught\r\nfire six times last winter, but it wouldn't burn. The dirt was so thick\r\non the walls, it smothered the fire!\" Which, if true, shows that water\r\nand dirt, not usually held to be harmonious elements, work together for\r\nthe good of those who insure houses.\r\n\r\nSunless and joyless though it be, Blind Man's Alley has that which its\r\ncompeers of the slums vainly yearn for. It has a pay-day. Once a year\r\nsunlight shines into the lives of its forlorn crew, past and present.\r\nIn June, when the Superintendent of Out-door Poor distributes the\r\ntwenty thousand dollars annually allowed the poor blind by the city, in\r\nhalf-hearted recognition of its failure to otherwise provide for them,\r\nBlindman's Alley takes a day off and goes to \"see\" Mr. Blake. That\r\nnight it is noisy with unwonted merriment. There is scraping of squeaky\r\nfiddles in the dark rooms, and cracked old voices sing long-forgotten\r\nsongs. Even the blind landlord rejoices, for much of the money goes\r\ninto his coffers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: UPSTAIRS IN BLINDMAN'S ALLEY.]\r\n\r\nFrom their perch up among the rafters Mrs. Gallagher's blind boarders\r\nmight hear, did they listen, the tramp of the policeman always on\r\nduty in Gotham Court, half a stone's throw away. His beat, though it\r\ntakes in but a small portion of a single block, is quite as lively\r\nas most larger patrol rounds. A double row of five-story tenements,\r\nback to back under a common roof, extending back from the street two\r\nhundred and thirty-four feet, with barred openings in the dividing\r\nwall, so that the tenants may see but cannot get at each other from\r\nthe stairs, makes the \"court.\" Alleys--one wider by a couple of feet\r\nthan the other, whence the distinction Single and Double Alley--skirt\r\nthe barracks on either side. Such, briefly, is the tenement that has\r\nchallenged public attention more than any other in the whole city and\r\ntested the power of sanitary law and rule for forty years. The name of\r\nthe pile is not down in the City Directory, but in the public records\r\nit holds an unenviable place. It was here the mortality rose during the\r\nlast great cholera epidemic to the unprecedented rate of 195 in 1,000\r\ninhabitants. In its worst days a full thousand could not be packed into\r\nthe court, though the number did probably not fall far short of it.\r\nEven now, under the management of men of conscience, and an agent, a\r\nKing's Daughter, whose practical energy, kindliness and good sense have\r\ndone much to redeem its foul reputation, the swarms it shelters would\r\nmake more than one fair-sized country village. The mixed character of\r\nthe population, by this time about equally divided between the Celtic\r\nand the Italian stock, accounts for the iron bars and the policeman. It\r\nwas an eminently Irish suggestion that the latter was to be credited\r\nto the presence of two German families in the court, who \"made trouble\r\nall the time.\" A Chinaman whom I questioned as he hurried past the iron\r\ngate of the alley, put the matter in a different light. \"Lem Ilish\r\nvelly bad,\" he said. Gotham Court has been the entering wedge for the\r\nItalian element, who until recently had not attained a foothold in the\r\nFourth Ward, but are now trailing across Chatham Street from their\r\nstronghold in \"the Bend\" in ever increasing numbers, seeking, according\r\nto their wont, the lowest level.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that this notorious block, whose name was so long\r\nsynonymous with all that was desperately bad, was originally built (in\r\n1851) by a benevolent Quaker for the express purpose of rescuing the\r\npoor people from the dreadful rookeries they were then living in. How\r\nlong it continued a model tenement is not on record. It could not have\r\nbeen very long, for already in 1862, ten years after it was finished, a\r\nsanitary official counted 146 cases of sickness in the court, including\r\n\"all kinds of infectious disease,\" from small-pox down, and reported\r\nthat of 138 children born in it in less than three years 61 had died,\r\nmostly before they were one year old. Seven years later the inspector\r\nof the district reported to the Board of Health that \"nearly ten per\r\ncent. of the population is sent to the public hospitals each year.\"\r\nWhen the alley was finally taken in hand by the authorities, and, as a\r\nfirst step toward its reclamation, the entire population was driven out\r\nby the police, experience dictated, as one of the first improvements to\r\nbe made, the putting in of a kind of sewer-grating, so constructed, as\r\nthe official report patiently puts it, \"as to prevent the ingress of\r\npersons disposed to make a hiding-place\" of the sewer and the cellars\r\ninto which they opened. The fact was that the big vaulted sewers had\r\nlong been a runway for thieves--the Swamp Angels--who through them\r\neasily escaped when chased by the police, as well as a storehouse for\r\ntheir plunder. The sewers are there to-day; in fact the two alleys are\r\nnothing but the roofs of these enormous tunnels in which a man may\r\nwalk upright the full distance of the block and into the Cherry Street\r\nsewer--if he likes the fun and is not afraid of rats. Could their grimy\r\nwalls speak, the big canals might tell many a startling tale. But they\r\nare silent enough, and so are most of those whose secrets they might\r\nbetray. The flood-gates connecting with the Cherry Street main are\r\nclosed now, except when the water is drained off. Then there were no\r\ngates, and it is on record that the sewers were chosen as a short cut\r\nhabitually by residents of the court whose business lay on the line\r\nof them, near a manhole, perhaps, in Cherry Street, or at the river\r\nmouth of the big pipe when it was clear at low tide. \"Me Jimmy,\" said\r\none wrinkled old dame, who looked in while we were nosing about under\r\nDouble Alley, \"he used to go to his work along down Cherry Street that\r\nway every morning and come back at night.\" The associations must have\r\nbeen congenial. Probably \"Jimmy\" himself fitted into the landscape.\r\n\r\nHalf-way back from the street in this latter alley is a tenement,\r\nfacing the main building, on the west side of the way, that was\r\nnot originally part of the court proper. It stands there a curious\r\nmonument to a Quaker's revenge, a living illustration of the power of\r\nhate to perpetuate its bitter fruit beyond the grave. The lot upon\r\nwhich it is built was the property of John Wood, brother of Silas,\r\nthe builder of Gotham Court. He sold the Cherry Street front to a man\r\nwho built upon it a tenement with entrance only from the street. Mr.\r\nWood afterward quarrelled about the partition line with his neighbor,\r\nAlderman Mullins, who had put up a long tenement barrack on his lot\r\nafter the style of the Court, and the Alderman knocked him down.\r\nTradition records that the Quaker picked himself up with the quiet\r\nremark, \"I will pay thee for that, friend Alderman,\" and went his\r\nway. His manner of paying was to put up the big building in the rear\r\nof 34 Cherry Street with an immense blank wall right in front of the\r\nwindows of Alderman Mullins's tenements, shutting out effectually\r\nlight and air from them. But as he had no access to the street from\r\nhis building for many years it could not be let or used for anything,\r\nand remained vacant until it passed under the management of the Gotham\r\nCourt property. Mullins's Court is there yet, and so is the Quaker's\r\nvengeful wall that has cursed the lives of thousands of innocent people\r\nsince. At its farther end the alley between the two that begins inside\r\nthe Cherry Street tenement, six or seven feet wide, narrows down to\r\nless than two feet. It is barely possible to squeeze through; but few\r\ncare to do it, for the rift leads to the jail of the Oak Street police\r\nstation, and therefore is not popular with the growing youth of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThere is crape on the door of the Alderman's court as we pass out, and\r\nupstairs in one of the tenements preparations are making for a wake. A\r\nman lies dead in the hospital who was cut to pieces in a \"can racket\"\r\nin the alley on Sunday. The sway of the excise law is not extended to\r\nthese back alleys. It would matter little if it were. There are secret\r\nby-ways, and some it is not held worth while to keep secret, along\r\nwhich the \"growler\" wanders at all hours and all seasons unmolested.\r\nIt climbed the stairs so long and so often that day that murder\r\nresulted. It is nothing unusual on Cherry Street, nothing to \"make a\r\nfuss\" about. Not a week before, two or three blocks up the street, the\r\npolice felt called upon to interfere in one of these can rackets at\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning, to secure peace for the neighborhood. The\r\ninterference took the form of a general fusillade, during which one of\r\nthe disturbers fell off the roof and was killed. There was the usual\r\nwake and nothing more was heard of it. What, indeed, was there to say?\r\n\r\nThe \"Rock of Ages\" is the name over the door of a low saloon that\r\nblocks the entrance to another alley, if possible more forlorn and\r\ndreary than the rest, as we pass out of the Alderman's court. It sounds\r\nlike a jeer from the days, happily past, when the \"wickedest man in New\r\nYork\" lived around the corner a little way and boasted of his title.\r\nOne cannot take many steps in Cherry Street without encountering some\r\nrelic of past or present prominence in the ways of crime, scarce one\r\nthat does not turn up specimen bricks of the coming thief. The Cherry\r\nStreet tough is all-pervading. Ask Superintendent Murray, who, as\r\ncaptain of the Oak Street squad, in seven months secured convictions\r\nfor theft, robbery, and murder aggregating no less than five hundred\r\nand thirty years of penal servitude, and he will tell you his opinion\r\nthat the Fourth Ward, even in the last twenty years, has turned out\r\nmore criminals than all the rest of the city together.\r\n\r\nBut though the \"Swamp Angels\" have gone to their reward, their\r\nsuccessors carry on business at the old stand as successfully, if not\r\nas boldly. There goes one who was once a shining light in thiefdom.\r\nHe has reformed since, they say. The policeman on the corner, who is\r\naddicted to a professional unbelief in reform of any kind, will tell\r\nyou that while on the Island once he sailed away on a shutter, paddling\r\nalong until he was picked up in Hell Gate by a schooner's crew, whom\r\nhe persuaded that he was a fanatic performing some sort of religious\r\npenance by his singular expedition. Over yonder, Tweed, the arch-thief,\r\nworked in a brush-shop and earned an honest living before he took\r\nto politics. As we stroll from one narrow street to another the odd\r\ncontrast between the low, old-looking houses in front and the towering\r\ntenements in the back yards grows even more striking, perhaps because\r\nwe expect and are looking for it. Nobody who was not would suspect the\r\npresence of the rear houses, though they have been there long enough.\r\nHere is one seven stories high behind one with only three floors. Take\r\na look into this Roosevelt Street alley; just about one step wide,\r\nwith a five-story house on one side that gets its light and air--God\r\nhelp us for pitiful mockery!--from this slit between brick walls.\r\nThere are no windows in the wall on the other side; it is perfectly\r\nblank. The fire-escapes of the long tenement fairly touch it; but the\r\nrays of the sun, rising, setting, or at high noon, never do. It never\r\nshone into the alley from the day the devil planned and man built it.\r\nThere was once an English doctor who experimented with the sunlight\r\nin the soldiers' barracks, and found that on the side that was shut\r\noff altogether from the sun the mortality was one hundred per cent.\r\ngreater than on the light side, where its rays had free access. But\r\nthen soldiers are of some account, have a fixed value, if not a very\r\nhigh one. The people who live here have not. The horse that pulls the\r\ndirt-cart one of these laborers loads and unloads is of ever so much\r\nmore account to the employer of his labor than he and all that belongs\r\nto him. Ask the owner; he will not attempt to deny it, if the horse\r\nis worth anything. The man too knows it. It is the one thought that\r\noccasionally troubles the owner of the horse in the enjoyment of his\r\nprosperity, built of and upon the successful assertion of the truth\r\nthat all men are created equal.\r\n\r\nWith what a shock did the story of yonder Madison Street alley come\r\nhome to New Yorkers one morning, eight or ten years ago, when a fire\r\nthat broke out after the men had gone to their work swept up those\r\nnarrow stairs and burned up women and children to the number of a\r\nfull half score. There were fire-escapes, yes! but so placed that\r\nthey could not be reached. The firemen had to look twice before they\r\ncould find the opening that passes for a thoroughfare; a stout man\r\nwould never venture in. Some wonderfully heroic rescues were made at\r\nthat fire by people living in the adjoining tenements. Danger and\r\ntrouble--of the imminent kind, not the everyday sort that excites\r\nneither interest nor commiseration--run even this common clay into\r\nheroic moulds on occasion; occasions that help us to remember that\r\nthe gap that separates the man with the patched coat from his wealthy\r\nneighbor is, after all, perhaps but a tenement. Yet, what a gap! and of\r\nwhose making? Here, as we stroll along Madison Street, workmen are busy\r\nputting the finishing touches to the brown-stone front of a tall new\r\ntenement. This one will probably be called an apartment house. They are\r\ncarving satyrs' heads in the stone, with a crowd of gaping youngsters\r\nlooking on in admiring wonder. Next door are two other tenements,\r\nlikewise with brown-stone fronts, fair to look at. The youngest of the\r\nchildren in the group is not too young to remember how their army of\r\ntenants was turned out by the health officers because the houses had\r\nbeen condemned as unfit for human beings to live in. The owner was a\r\nwealthy builder who \"stood high in the community.\" Is it only in our\r\nfancy that the sardonic leer on the stone faces seems to list that\r\nway? Or is it an introspective grin? We will not ask if the new house\r\nbelongs to the same builder. He too may have reformed.\r\n\r\nWe have crossed the boundary of the Seventh Ward. Penitentiary Row,\r\nsuggestive name for a block of Cherry Street tenements, is behind us.\r\nWithin recent days it has become peopled wholly with Hebrews, the\r\noverflow from Jewtown adjoining, pedlars and tailors, all of them. It\r\nis odd to read this legend from other days over the door: \"No pedlars\r\nallowed in this house.\" These thrifty people are not only crowding into\r\nthe tenements of this once exclusive district--they are buying them.\r\nThe Jew runs to real estate as soon as he can save up enough for a\r\ndeposit to clinch the bargain. As fast as the old houses are torn down,\r\ntowering structures go up in their place, and Hebrews are found to be\r\nthe builders. Here is a whole alley nicknamed after the intruder, Jews'\r\nAlley. But abuse and ridicule are not weapons to fight the Israelite\r\nwith. He pockets them quietly with the rent and bides his time. He\r\nknows from experience, both sweet and bitter, that all things come to\r\nthose who wait, including the houses and lands of their persecutors.\r\n\r\nHere comes a pleasure party, as gay as any on the avenue, though the\r\ncarry-all is an ash-cart. The father is the driver and he has taken\r\nhis brown-legged boy for a ride. How proud and happy they both look\r\nup there on their perch! The queer old building they have halted in\r\nfront of is \"The Ship,\" famous for fifty years as a ramshackle tenement\r\nfilled with the oddest crowd. No one knows why it is called \"The Ship,\"\r\nthough there is a tradition that once the river came clear up here\r\nto Hamilton Street, and boats were moored along-side it. More likely\r\nit is because it is as bewildering inside as a crazy old ship, with\r\nits ups and downs of ladders parading as stairs, and its unexpected\r\npitfalls. But Hamilton Street, like Water Street, is not what it was.\r\nThe missions drove from the latter the worst of its dives. A sailors'\r\nmission has lately made its appearance in Hamilton Street, but there\r\nare no dives there, nothing worse than the ubiquitous saloon and tough\r\ntenements.\r\n\r\nEnough of them everywhere. Suppose we look into one? No. -- Cherry\r\nStreet. Be a little careful, please! The hall is dark and you might\r\nstumble over the children pitching pennies back there. Not that it\r\nwould hurt them; kicks and cuffs are their daily diet. They have little\r\nelse. Here where the hall turns and dives into utter darkness is a\r\nstep, and another, another. A flight of stairs. You can feel your way,\r\nif you cannot see it. Close? Yes! What would you have? All the fresh\r\nair that ever enters these stairs comes from the hall-door that is\r\nforever slamming, and from the windows of dark bedrooms that in turn\r\nreceive from the stairs their sole supply of the elements God meant to\r\nbe free, but man deals out with such niggardly hand. That was a woman\r\nfilling her pail by the hydrant you just bumped against. The sinks\r\nare in the hallway, that all the tenants may have access--and all be\r\npoisoned alike by their summer stenches. Hear the pump squeak! It is\r\nthe lullaby of tenement-house babes. In summer, when a thousand thirsty\r\nthroats pant for a cooling drink in this block, it is worked in vain.\r\nBut the saloon, whose open door you passed in the hall, is always\r\nthere. The smell of it has followed you up. Here is a door. Listen!\r\nThat short hacking cough, that tiny, helpless wail--what do they mean?\r\nThey mean that the soiled bow of white you saw on the door downstairs\r\nwill have another story to tell--Oh! a sadly familiar story--before\r\nthe day is at an end. The child is dying with measles. With half a\r\nchance it might have lived; but it had none. That dark bedroom killed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"It was took all of a suddint,\" says the mother, smoothing the\r\nthrobbing little body with trembling hands. There is no unkindness in\r\nthe rough voice of the man in the jumper, who sits by the window grimly\r\nsmoking a clay pipe, with the little life ebbing out in his sight,\r\nbitter as his words sound: \"Hush, Mary! If we cannot keep the baby,\r\nneed we complain--such as we?\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN OLD REAR-TENEMENT IN ROOSEVELT STREET.]\r\n\r\nSuch as we! What if the words ring in your ears as we grope our way\r\nup the stairs and down from floor to floor, listening to the sounds\r\nbehind the closed doors--some of quarrelling, some of coarse songs,\r\nmore of profanity. They are true. When the summer heats come with their\r\nsuffering they have meaning more terrible than words can tell. Come\r\nover here. Step carefully over this baby--it is a baby, spite of its\r\nrags and dirt--under these iron bridges called fire-escapes, but loaded\r\ndown, despite the incessant watchfulness of the firemen, with broken\r\nhousehold goods, with wash-tubs and barrels, over which no man could\r\nclimb from a fire. This gap between dingy brick-walls is the yard. That\r\nstrip of smoke-colored sky up there is the heaven of these people. Do\r\nyou wonder the name does not attract them to the churches? That baby's\r\nparents live in the rear tenement here. She is at least as clean as\r\nthe steps we are now climbing. There are plenty of houses with half a\r\nhundred such in. The tenement is much like the one in front we just\r\nleft, only fouler, closer, darker--we will not say more cheerless. The\r\nword is a mockery. A hundred thousand people lived in rear tenements in\r\nNew York last year. Here is a room neater than the rest. The woman, a\r\nstout matron with hard lines of care in her face, is at the wash-tub.\r\n\"I try to keep the childer clean,\" she says, apologetically, but with\r\na hopeless glance around. The spice of hot soap-suds is added to the\r\nair already tainted with the smell of boiling cabbage, of rags and\r\nuncleanliness all about. It makes an overpowering compound. It is\r\nThursday, but patched linen is hung upon the pulley-line from the\r\nwindow. There is no Monday cleaning in the tenements. It is washday\r\nall the week round, for a change of clothing is scarce among the poor.\r\nThey are poverty's honest badge, these perennial lines of rags hung\r\nout to dry, those that are not the washerwoman's professional shingle.\r\nThe true line to be drawn between pauperism and honest poverty is the\r\nclothes-line. With it begins the effort to be clean that is the first\r\nand the best evidence of a desire to be honest.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of an answer, think you, would come from these tenements to\r\nthe question \"Is life worth living?\" were they heard at all in the\r\ndiscussion? It may be that this, cut from the last report but one of\r\nthe Association for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor, a\r\nlong name for a weary task, has a suggestion of it: \"In the depth of\r\nwinter the attention of the Association was called to a Protestant\r\nfamily living in a garret in a miserable tenement in Cherry Street.\r\nThe family's condition was most deplorable. The man, his wife, and\r\nthree small children shivering in one room through the roof of which\r\nthe pitiless winds of winter whistled. The room was almost barren of\r\nfurniture; the parents slept on the floor, the elder children in boxes,\r\nand the baby was swung in an old shawl attached to the rafters by cords\r\nby way of a hammock. The father, a seaman, had been obliged to give up\r\nthat calling because he was in consumption, and was unable to provide\r\neither bread or fire for his little ones.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this may be put down as an exceptional case, but one that came\r\nto my notice some months ago in a Seventh Ward tenement was typical\r\nenough to escape that reproach. There were nine in the family: husband,\r\nwife, an aged grandmother, and six children; honest, hard-working\r\nGermans, scrupulously neat, but poor. All nine lived in two rooms, one\r\nabout ten feet square that served as parlor, bedroom, and eating-room,\r\nthe other a small hall-room made into a kitchen. The rent was seven\r\ndollars and a half a month, more than a week's wages for the husband\r\nand father, who was the only bread-winner in the family. That day the\r\nmother had thrown herself out of the window, and was carried up from\r\nthe street dead. She was \"discouraged,\" said some of the other women\r\nfrom the tenement, who had come in to look after the children while\r\na messenger carried the news to the father at the shop. They went\r\nstolidly about their task, although they were evidently not without\r\nfeeling for the dead woman. No doubt she was wrong in not taking life\r\nphilosophically, as did the four families a city missionary found\r\nhousekeeping in the four corners of one room. They got along well\r\nenough together until one of the families took a boarder and made\r\ntrouble. Philosophy, according to my optimistic friend, naturally\r\ninhabits the tenements. The people who live there come to look upon\r\ndeath in a different way from the rest of us--do not take it as hard.\r\nHe has never found time to explain how the fact fits into his general\r\ntheory that life is not unbearable in the tenements. Unhappily for the\r\nphilosophy of the slums, it is too apt to be of the kind that readily\r\nrecognizes the saloon, always handy, as the refuge from every trouble,\r\nand shapes its practice according to the discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                        THE ITALIAN IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly a picturesque, if not very tidy, element has been added to\r\nthe population in the \"assisted\" Italian immigrant who claims so large\r\na share of public attention, partly because he keeps coming at such a\r\ntremendous rate, but chiefly because he elects to stay in New York,\r\nor near enough for it to serve as his base of operations, and here\r\npromptly reproduces conditions of destitution and disorder which, set\r\nin the frame-work of Mediterranean exuberance, are the delight of the\r\nartist, but in a matter-of-fact American community become its danger\r\nand reproach. The reproduction is made easier in New York because he\r\nfinds the material ready to hand in the worst of the slum tenements;\r\nbut even where it is not he soon reduces what he does find to his own\r\nlevel, if allowed to follow his natural bent.[7] The Italian comes in\r\nat the bottom, and in the generation that came over the sea he stays\r\nthere. In the slums he is welcomed as a tenant who \"makes less trouble\"\r\nthan the contentious Irishman or the order-loving German, that is to\r\nsay: is content to live in a pig-sty and submits to robbery at the\r\nhands of the rent-collector without murmur. Yet this very tractability\r\nmakes of him in good hands, when firmly and intelligently managed, a\r\nreally desirable tenant. But it is not his good fortune often to fall\r\nin with other hospitality upon his coming than that which brought him\r\nhere for its own profit, and has no idea of letting go its grip upon\r\nhim as long as there is a cent to be made out of him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The process can be observed in the Italian tenements in\r\nHarlem (Little Italy), which, since their occupation by these people,\r\nhave been gradually sinking to the slum level.]\r\n\r\nRecent Congressional inquiries have shown the nature of the\r\n\"assistance\" he receives from greedy steamship agents and \"bankers,\"\r\nwho persuade him by false promises to mortgage his home, his few\r\nbelongings, and his wages for months to come for a ticket to the land\r\nwhere plenty of work is to be had at princely wages. The padrone--the\r\n\"banker,\" is nothing else--having made his ten per cent. out of him\r\nen route, receives him at the landing and turns him to double account\r\nas a wage-earner and a rent-payer. In each of these rôles he is made\r\nto yield a profit to his unscrupulous countryman, whom he trusts\r\nimplicitly with the instinct of utter helplessness. The man is so\r\nignorant that, as one of the sharpers who prey upon him put it once,\r\nit \"would be downright sinful not to take him in.\" His ignorance and\r\nunconquerable suspicion of strangers dig the pit into which he falls.\r\nHe not only knows no word of English, but he does not know enough to\r\nlearn. Rarely only can he write his own language. Unlike the German,\r\nwho begins learning English the day he lands as a matter of duty, or\r\nthe Polish Jew, who takes it up as soon as he is able as an investment,\r\nthe Italian learns slowly, if at all. Even his boy, born here, often\r\nspeaks his native tongue indifferently. He is forced, therefore, to\r\nhave constant recourse to the middle-man, who makes him pay handsomely\r\nat every turn. He hires him out to the railroad contractor, receiving a\r\ncommission from the employer as well as from the laborer, and repeats\r\nthe performance monthly, or as often as he can have him dismissed. In\r\nthe city he contracts for his lodging, subletting to him space in the\r\nvilest tenements at extortionate rents, and sets an example that does\r\nnot lack imitators. The \"princely wages\" have vanished with his coming,\r\nand in their place hardships and a dollar a day, beheft with the\r\npadrone's merciless mortgage, confront him. Bred to even worse fare, he\r\ntakes both as a matter of course, and, applying the maxim that it is\r\nnot what one makes but what he saves that makes him rich, manages to\r\nturn the very dirt of the streets into a hoard of gold, with which he\r\neither returns to his Southern home, or brings over his family to join\r\nin his work and in his fortunes the next season.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IN THE HOME OF AN ITALIAN RAG-PICKER, JERSEY STREET.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery was made by earlier explorers that there is money in New\r\nYork's ash-barrel, but it was left to the genius of the padrone to\r\ndevelop the full resources of the mine that has become the exclusive\r\npreserve of the Italian immigrant. Only a few years ago, when\r\nrag-picking was carried on in a desultory and irresponsible sort of\r\nway, the city hired gangs of men to trim the ash-scows before they were\r\nsent out to sea. The trimming consisted in levelling out the dirt as\r\nit was dumped from the carts, so that the scow might be evenly loaded.\r\nThe men were paid a dollar and a half a day, kept what they found\r\nthat was worth having, and allowed the swarms of Italians who hung\r\nabout the dumps to do the heavy work for them, letting them have their\r\npick of the loads for their trouble. To-day Italians contract for the\r\nwork, paying large sums to be permitted to do it. The city received\r\nnot less than $80,000 last year for the sale of this privilege to the\r\ncontractors, who in addition have to pay gangs of their countrymen for\r\nsorting out the bones, rags, tin cans and other waste that are found\r\nin the ashes and form the staples of their trade and their sources of\r\nrevenue. The effect has been vastly to increase the power of the\r\npadrone, or his ally, the contractor, by giving him exclusive control\r\nof the one industry in which the Italian was formerly an independent\r\n\"dealer,\" and reducing him literally to the plane of the dump. Whenever\r\nthe back of the sanitary police is turned, he will make his home in the\r\nfilthy burrows where he works by day, sleeping and eating his meals\r\nunder the dump, on the edge of slimy depths and amid surroundings full\r\nof unutterable horror. The city did not bargain to house, though it\r\nis content to board, him so long as he can make the ash-barrels yield\r\nthe food to keep him alive, and a vigorous campaign is carried on at\r\nintervals against these unlicensed dump settlements; but the temptation\r\nof having to pay no rent is too strong, and they are driven from one\r\ndump only to find lodgement under another a few blocks farther up or\r\ndown the river. The fiercest warfare is waged over the patronage of the\r\ndumps by rival factions represented by opposing contractors, and it has\r\nhappened that the defeated party has endeavored to capture by strategy\r\nwhat he failed to carry by assault. It augurs unsuspected adaptability\r\nin the Italian to our system of self-government that these rivalries\r\nhave more than once been suspected of being behind the sharpening of\r\ncity ordinances, that were apparently made in good faith to prevent\r\nmeddling with the refuse in the ash-barrels or in transit.\r\n\r\nDid the Italian always adapt himself as readily to the operation of the\r\ncivil law as to the manipulation of political \"pull\" on occasion, he\r\nwould save himself a good deal of unnecessary trouble. Ordinarily he is\r\neasily enough governed by authority--always excepting Sunday, when he\r\nsettles down to a game of cards and lets loose all his bad passions.\r\nLike the Chinese, the Italian is a born gambler. His soul is in the\r\ngame from the moment the cards are on the table, and very frequently\r\nhis knife is in it too before the game is ended. No Sunday has passed\r\nin New York since \"the Bend\" became a suburb of Naples without one or\r\nmore of these murderous affrays coming to the notice of the police. As\r\na rule that happens only when the man the game went against is either\r\ndead or so badly wounded as to require instant surgical help. As to the\r\nother, unless he be caught red-handed, the chances that the police will\r\never get him are slim indeed. The wounded man can seldom be persuaded\r\nto betray him. He wards off all inquiries with a wicked \"I fix him\r\nmyself,\" and there the matter rests until he either dies or recovers.\r\nIf the latter, the community hears after a while of another Italian\r\naffray, a man stabbed in a quarrel, dead or dying, and the police know\r\nthat \"he\" has been fixed, and the account squared.\r\n\r\nWith all his conspicuous faults, the swarthy Italian immigrant has\r\nhis redeeming traits. He is as honest as he is hot-headed. There are\r\nno Italian burglars in the Rogues' Gallery; the ex-brigand toils\r\npeacefully with pickaxe and shovel on American ground. His boy\r\noccasionally shows, as a pick-pocket, the results of his training with\r\nthe toughs of the Sixth Ward slums. The only criminal business to which\r\nthe father occasionally lends his hand, outside of murder, is a bunco\r\ngame, of which his confiding countrymen, returning with their hoard to\r\ntheir native land, are the victims. The women are faithful wives and\r\ndevoted mothers. Their vivid and picturesque costumes lend a tinge of\r\ncolor to the otherwise dull monotony of the slums they inhabit. The\r\nItalian is gay, light-hearted and, if his fur is not stroked the wrong\r\nway, inoffensive as a child. His worst offence is that he keeps the\r\nstale-beer dives. Where his headquarters is, in the Mulberry Street\r\nBend, these vile dens flourish and gather about them all the wrecks,\r\nthe utterly wretched, the hopelessly lost, on the lowest slope of\r\ndepraved humanity. And out of their misery he makes a profit.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                               THE BEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Mulberry Street crooks like an elbow within hail of the old\r\ndepravity of the Five Points, is \"the Bend,\" foul core of New York's\r\nslums. Long years ago the cows coming home from the pasture trod a\r\npath over this hill. Echoes of tinkling bells linger there still, but\r\nthey do not call up memories of green meadows and summer fields; they\r\nproclaim the home-coming of the rag-picker's cart. In the memory of man\r\nthe old cow-path has never been other than a vast human pig-sty. There\r\nis but one \"Bend\" in the world, and it is enough. The city authorities,\r\nmoved by the angry protests of ten years of sanitary reform effort,\r\nhave decided that it is too much and must come down. Another Paradise\r\nPark will take its place and let in sunlight and air to work such\r\ntransformation as at the Five Points, around the corner of the next\r\nblock. Never was change more urgently needed. Around \"the Bend\" cluster\r\nthe bulk of the tenements that are stamped as altogether bad, even\r\nby the optimists of the Health Department. Incessant raids cannot\r\nkeep down the crowds that make them their home. In the scores of back\r\nalleys, of stable lanes and hidden byways, of which the rent collector\r\nalone can keep track, they share such shelter as the ramshackle\r\nstructures afford with every kind of abomination rifled from the dumps\r\nand ash barrels of the city. Here, too, shunning the light, skulks the\r\nunclean beast of dishonest idleness. \"The Bend\" is the home of the\r\ntramp as well as the rag-picker.\r\n\r\nIt is not much more than twenty years since a census of \"the Bend\"\r\ndistrict returned only twenty-four of the six hundred and nine\r\ntenements as in decent condition. Three-fourths of the population of\r\nthe \"Bloody Sixth\" Ward were then Irish. The army of tramps that grew\r\nup after the disbandment of the armies in the field, and has kept up\r\nits muster roll, together with the in-rush of the Italian tide, have\r\never since opposed a stubborn barrier to all efforts at permanent\r\nimprovement. The more that has been done, the less it has seemed to\r\naccomplish in the way of real relief, until it has at last become clear\r\nthat nothing short of entire demolition will ever prove of radical\r\nbenefit. Corruption could not have chosen ground for its stand with\r\nbetter promise of success. The whole district is a maze of narrow,\r\noften unsuspected passage-ways--necessarily, for there is scarce a\r\nlot that has not two, three, or four tenements upon it, swarming with\r\nunwholesome crowds. What a birds-eye view of \"the Bend\" would be like\r\nis a matter of bewildering conjecture. Its everyday appearance, as seen\r\nfrom the corner of Bayard Street on a sunny day, is one of the sights\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nBayard Street is the high road to Jewtown across the Bowery, picketed\r\nfrom end to end with the outposts of Israel. Hebrew faces, Hebrew\r\nsigns, and incessant chatter in the queer lingo that passes for\r\nHebrew on the East Side attend the curious wanderer to the very\r\ncorner of Mulberry Street. But the moment he turns the corner the\r\nscene changes abruptly. Before him lies spread out what might better\r\nbe the market-place in some town in Southern Italy than a street in\r\nNew York--all but the houses; they are still the same old tenements\r\nof the unromantic type. But for once they do not make the foreground\r\nin a slum picture from the American metropolis. The interest centres\r\nnot in them, but in the crowd they shelter only when the street is\r\nnot preferable, and that with the Italian is only when it rains or he\r\nis sick. When the sun shines the entire population seeks the street,\r\ncarrying on its household work, its bargaining, its love-making on\r\nstreet or sidewalk, or idling there when it has nothing better to do,\r\nwith the reverse of the impulse that makes the Polish Jew coop himself\r\nup in his den with the thermometer at stewing heat. Along the curb\r\nwomen sit in rows, young and old alike with the odd head-covering, pad\r\nor turban, that is their badge of servitude--her's to bear the burden\r\nas long as she lives--haggling over baskets of frowsy weeds, some sort\r\nof salad probably, stale tomatoes, and oranges not above suspicion.\r\nAsh-barrels serve them as counters, and not infrequently does the\r\narrival of the official cart en route for the dump cause a temporary\r\nsuspension of trade until the barrels have been emptied and restored.\r\nHucksters and pedlars' carts make two rows of booths in the street\r\nitself, and along the houses is still another--a perpetual market doing\r\na very lively trade in its own queer staples, found nowhere on American\r\nground save in \"the Bend.\" Two old hags, camping on the pavement, are\r\ndispensing stale bread, baked not in loaves, but in the shape of big\r\nwreaths like exaggerated crullers, out of bags of dirty bed-tick. There\r\nis no use disguising the fact: they look like and they probably are\r\nold mattresses mustered into service under the pressure of a rush of\r\ntrade. Stale bread was the one article the health officers, after a\r\nraid on the market, once reported as \"not unwholesome.\" It was only\r\ndisgusting. Here is a brawny butcher, sleeves rolled up above the\r\nelbows and clay pipe in mouth, skinning a kid that hangs from his hook.\r\nThey will tell you with a laugh at the Elizabeth Street police station\r\nthat only a few days ago when a dead goat had been reported lying in\r\nPell Street it was mysteriously missing by the time the offal-cart came\r\nto take it away. It turned out that an Italian had carried it off in\r\nhis sack to a wake or feast of some sort in one of the back alleys.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE BEND.]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the narrow entrance to Bandit's Roost, one of the\r\nmost notorious of these, is a shop that is a fair sample of the sort\r\nof invention necessity is the mother of in \"the Bend.\" It is not\r\nenough that trucks and ash-barrels have provided four distinct lines\r\nof shops that are not down on the insurance maps, to accommodate the\r\ncrowds. Here have the very hallways been made into shops. Three feet\r\nwide by four deep, they have just room for one, the shop-keeper, who,\r\nhimself within, does his business outside, his wares displayed on a\r\nboard hung across what was once the hall door. Back of the rear wall of\r\nthis unique shop a hole has been punched from the hall into the alley\r\nand the tenants go that way. One of the shops is a \"tobacco bureau,\"\r\npresided over by an unknown saint, done in yellow and red--there is\r\nnot a shop, a stand, or an ash-barrel doing duty for a counter, that\r\nhas not its patron saint--the other is a fish-stand full of slimy,\r\nodd-looking creatures, fish that never swam in American waters, or\r\nif they did, were never seen on an American fish-stand, and snails.\r\nBig, awkward sausages, anything but appetizing, hang in the grocer's\r\ndoorway, knocking against the customer's head as if to remind him\r\nthat they are there waiting to be bought. What they are I never had\r\nthe courage to ask. Down the street comes a file of women carrying\r\nenormous bundles of fire-wood on their heads, loads of decaying\r\nvegetables from the market wagons in their aprons, and each a baby at\r\nthe breast supported by a sort of sling that prevents it from tumbling\r\ndown. The women do all the carrying, all the work one sees going on\r\nin \"the Bend.\" The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in\r\nthe open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and\r\ngesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows. Near a\r\nparticularly boisterous group, a really pretty girl with a string of\r\namber beads twisted artlessly in the knot of her raven hair has been\r\nbargaining long and earnestly with an old granny, who presides over\r\na wheel-barrow load of second-hand stockings and faded cotton yarn,\r\nindustriously darning the biggest holes while she extols the virtues of\r\nher stock. One of the rude swains, with patched overalls tucked into\r\nhis boots, to whom the girl's eyes have strayed more than once, steps\r\nup and gallantly offers to pick her out the handsomest pair, whereat\r\nshe laughs and pushes him away with a gesture which he interprets as an\r\ninvitation to stay; and he does, evidently to the satisfaction of the\r\nbeldame, who forthwith raises her prices fifty per cent. without being\r\ndetected by the girl.\r\n\r\nRed bandannas and yellow kerchiefs are everywhere; so is the Italian\r\ntongue, infinitely sweeter than the harsh gutturals of the Russian Jew\r\naround the corner. So are the \"ristorantes\" of innumerable Pasquales;\r\nhalf of the people in \"the Bend\" are christened Pasquale, or get the\r\nname in some other way. When the police do not know the name of an\r\nescaped murderer, they guess at Pasquale and send the name out on\r\nalarm; in nine cases out of ten it fits. So are the \"banks\" that hang\r\nout their shingle as tempting bait on every hand. There are half a\r\ndozen in the single block, steamship agencies, employment offices, and\r\nsavings-banks, all in one. So are the toddling youngsters, bow-legged\r\nhalf of them, and so are no end of mothers, present and prospective,\r\nsome of them scarce yet in their teens. Those who are not in the street\r\nare hanging half way out of the windows, shouting at some one below.\r\nAll \"the Bend\" must be, if not altogether, at least half out of doors\r\nwhen the sun shines.\r\n\r\nIn the street, where the city wields the broom, there is at least an\r\neffort at cleaning up. There has to be, or it would be swamped in\r\nfilth overrunning from the courts and alleys where the rag-pickers\r\nlive. It requires more than ordinary courage to explore these on a hot\r\nday. The undertaker has to do it then, the police always. Right here,\r\nin this tenement on the east side of the street, they found little\r\nAntonia Candia, victim of fiendish cruelty, \"covered,\" says the account\r\nfound in the records of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nChildren, \"with sores, and her hair matted with dried blood.\" Abuse is\r\nthe normal condition of \"the Bend,\" murder its everyday crop, with the\r\ntenants not always the criminals. In this block between Bayard, Park,\r\nMulberry, and Baxter Streets, \"the Bend\" proper, the late Tenement\r\nHouse Commission counted 155 deaths of children[8] in a specimen year\r\n(1882). Their per centage of the total mortality in the block was\r\n68.28, while for the whole city the proportion was only 46.20. The\r\ninfant mortality in any city or place as compared with the whole number\r\nof deaths is justly considered a good barometer of its general sanitary\r\ncondition. Here, in this tenement, No. 59½, next to Bandits' Roost,\r\nfourteen persons died that year, and eleven of them were children; in\r\nNo. 61 eleven, and eight of them not yet five years old. According to\r\nthe records in the Bureau of Vital Statistics only thirty-nine people\r\nlived in No. 59½ in the year 1888, nine of them little children.\r\nThere were five baby funerals in that house the same year. Out of\r\nthe alley itself, No. 59, nine dead were carried in 1888, five in\r\nbaby coffins. Here is the record of the year for the whole block, as\r\nfurnished by the Registrar of Vital Statistics, Dr. Roger S. Tracy:\r\n\r\n _Deaths and Death-rates in 1888 in Baxter and Mulberry Streets,\r\n                   between Park and Bayard Streets._\r\n\r\n Key\r\n A = Five years old and over.\r\n B = Under five years.\r\n C = Total.\r\n D = General.\r\n\r\n ----------------+------------------+------------+---------------------\r\n                 |    POPULATION.   |   DEATHS.  |     DEATH-RATE.\r\n                 +------+----+------+---+---+----+------+-------+------\r\n                 |   A  |  B |   C  | A | B |  C |   A  |    B  |   D\r\n ----------------+------+----+------+---+---+----+------+-------+------\r\n Baxter Street   | 1,918| 315| 2,233| 26| 46|  72| 13.56| 146.02| 32.24\r\n Mulberry Street | 2,788| 629| 3,417| 44| 86| 130| 15.78| 136.70| 38.05\r\n                 +------+----+------+---+---+----+------+-------+------\r\n     Total       | 4,706| 944| 5,650| 70|132| 202| 14.87| 139.83| 35.75\r\n ----------------+------+----+------+---+---+----+------+-------+------\r\n\r\nThe general death-rate for the whole city that year was 26.27.\r\n\r\nThese figures speak for themselves, when it is shown that in the model\r\ntenement across the way at Nos. 48 and 50, where the same class of\r\npeople live in greater swarms (161, according to the record), but under\r\ngood management, and in decent quarters, the hearse called that year\r\nonly twice, once for a baby. The agent of the Christian people who\r\nbuilt that tenement will tell you that Italians are good tenants, while\r\nthe owner of the alley will oppose every order to put his property in\r\nrepair with the claim that they are the worst of a bad lot. Both are\r\nright, from their different stand-points. It is the stand-point that\r\nmakes the difference--and the tenant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANDITS' ROOST.]\r\n\r\nWhat if I were to tell you that this alley, and more tenement property\r\nin \"the Bend,\" all of it notorious for years as the vilest and worst\r\nto be found anywhere, stood associated on the tax-books all through\r\nthe long struggle to make its owners responsible, which has at last\r\nresulted in a qualified victory for the law, with the name of an\r\nhonored family, one of the \"oldest and best,\" rich in possessions and\r\nin influence, and high in the councils of the city's government? It\r\nwould be but the plain truth. Nor would it be the only instance by very\r\nmany that stand recorded on the Health Department's books of a kind\r\nthat has come near to making the name of landlord as odious in New York\r\nas it has become in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBottle Alley is around the corner in Baxter Street; but it is a fair\r\nspecimen of its kind, wherever found. Look into any of these houses,\r\neverywhere the same piles of rags, of malodorous bones and musty paper,\r\nall of which the sanitary police flatter themselves they have banished\r\nto the dumps and the warehouses. Here is a \"flat\" of \"parlor\" and two\r\npitch-dark coops called bedrooms. Truly, the bed is all there is room\r\nfor. The family tea-kettle is on the stove, doing duty for the time\r\nbeing as a wash-boiler. By night it will have returned to its proper\r\nuse again, a practical illustration of how poverty in \"the Bend\" makes\r\nboth ends meet. One, two, three beds are there, if the old boxes and\r\nheaps of foul straw can be called by that name; a broken stove with\r\ncrazy pipe from which the smoke leaks at every joint, a table of\r\nrough boards propped up on boxes, piles of rubbish in the corner.\r\nThe closeness and smell are appalling. How many people sleep here?\r\nThe woman with the red bandanna shakes her head sullenly, but the\r\nbare-legged girl with the bright face counts on her fingers--five, six!\r\n\r\n\"Six, sir!\" Six grown people and five children.\r\n\r\n\"Only five,\" she says with a smile, swathing the little one on her\r\nlap in its cruel bandage. There is another in the cradle--actually a\r\ncradle. And how much the rent?\r\n\r\nNine and a half, and \"please, sir! he won't put the paper on.\"\r\n\r\n\"He\" is the landlord. The \"paper\" hangs in musty shreds on the wall.\r\n\r\nWell do I recollect the visit of a health inspector to one of these\r\ntenements on a July day when the thermometer outside was climbing\r\nhigh in the nineties; but inside, in that awful room, with half a\r\ndozen persons washing, cooking, and sorting rags, lay the dying baby\r\nalongside the stove, where the doctors thermometer ran up to 115°!\r\nPerishing for the want of a breath of fresh air in this city of untold\r\ncharities! Did not the manager of the Fresh Air Fund write to the\r\npastor of an Italian Church only last year[9] that \"no one asked for\r\nItalian children,\" and hence he could not send any to the country?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See City Mission Report, February, 1890, page 77.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTTLE ALLEY.]\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen blocks up Mulberry Street there is a rag-picker's\r\nsettlement, a sort of overflow from \"the Bend,\" that exists to-day\r\nin all its pristine nastiness. Something like forty families are\r\npacked into five old two-story and attic houses that were built to\r\nhold five, and out in the yards additional crowds are, or were until\r\nvery recently, accommodated in sheds built of all sorts of old boards\r\nand used as drying racks for the Italian tenants' \"stock.\" I found\r\nthem empty when I visited the settlement while writing this. The\r\nlast two tenants had just left. Their fate was characteristic. The\r\n\"old man,\" who lived in the corner coop, with barely room to crouch\r\nbeside the stove--there would not have been room for him to sleep had\r\nnot age crooked his frame to fit his house--had been taken to the\r\n\"crazy-house,\" and the woman who was his neighbor and had lived in\r\nher shed for years had simply disappeared. The agent and the other\r\ntenants \"guessed,\" doubtless correctly, that she might be found on the\r\n\"island,\" but she was decrepit anyhow from rheumatism, and \"not much\r\ngood,\" and no one took the trouble to inquire for her. They had all\r\nthey could do attending to their own business and raising the rent.\r\nNo wonder; I found that for one front room and two \"bedrooms\" in the\r\nshameful old wrecks of buildings the tenant was paying $10 a month, for\r\nthe back-room and one bedroom $9, and for the attic rooms, according to\r\nsize, from $3.75 to $5.50.\r\n\r\nThere is a standing quarrel between the professional--I mean now the\r\nofficial--sanitarian and the unsalaried agitator for sanitary reform\r\nover the question of overcrowded tenements. The one puts the number a\r\nlittle vaguely at four or five hundred, while the other asserts that\r\nthere are thirty-two thousand, the whole number of houses classed as\r\ntenements at the census of two years ago, taking no account of the\r\nbetter kind of flats. It depends on the angle from which one sees it\r\nwhich is right. At best the term overcrowding is a relative one, and\r\nthe scale of official measurement conveniently sliding. Under the\r\npressure of the Italian influx the standard of breathing space required\r\nfor an adult by the health officers has been cut down from six to four\r\nhundred cubic feet. The \"needs of the situation\" is their plea, and no\r\nmore perfect argument could be advanced for the reformer's position.\r\n\r\nIt is in \"the Bend\" the sanitary policeman locates the bulk of his\r\nfour hundred, and the sanitary reformer gives up the task in despair.\r\nOf its vast homeless crowds the census takes no account. It is their\r\ninstinct to shun the light, and they cannot be corralled in one place\r\nlong enough to be counted. But the houses can, and the last count\r\nshowed that in \"the Bend\" district, between Broadway and the Bowery and\r\nCanal and Chatham Streets, in a total of four thousand three hundred\r\nand sixty-seven \"apartments\" only nine were for the moment vacant,\r\nwhile in the old \"Africa,\" west of Broadway, that receives the overflow\r\nfrom Mulberry Street and is rapidly changing its character, the notice\r\n\"standing room only\" is up. Not a single vacant room was found there.\r\nNearly a hundred and fifty \"lodgers\" were driven out of two adjoining\r\nMulberry Street tenements, one of them aptly named \"the House of\r\nBlazes,\" during that census. What squalor and degradation inhabit these\r\ndens the health officers know. Through the long summer days their carts\r\npatrol \"the Bend,\" scattering disinfectants in streets and lanes, in\r\nsinks and cellars, and hidden hovels where the tramp burrows. From\r\nmidnight till far into the small hours of the morning the policeman's\r\nthundering rap on closed doors is heard, with his stern command, \"_Apri\r\nport'!_\" on his rounds gathering evidence of illegal overcrowding. The\r\ndoors are opened unwillingly enough--but the order means business, and\r\nthe tenant knows it even if he understands no word of English--upon\r\nsuch scenes as the one presented in the picture. It was photographed\r\nby flash-light on just such a visit. In a room not thirteen feet\r\neither way slept twelve men and women, two or three in bunks set in a\r\nsort of alcove, the rest on the floor. A kerosene lamp burned dimly\r\nin the fearful atmosphere, probably to guide other and later arrivals\r\nto their \"beds,\" for it was only just past midnight. A baby's fretful\r\nwail came from an adjoining hall-room, where, in the semi-darkness,\r\nthree recumbent figures could be made out. The \"apartment\" was one of\r\nthree in two adjoining buildings we had found, within half an hour,\r\nsimilarly crowded. Most of the men were lodgers, who slept there for\r\nfive cents a spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LODGERS IN A CROWDED BAYARD STREET TENEMENT--\"FIVE CENTS\r\nA SPOT.\"]\r\n\r\nAnother room on the top floor, that had been examined a few nights\r\nbefore, was comparatively empty. There were only four persons in it,\r\ntwo men, an old woman, and a young girl. The landlord opened the\r\ndoor with alacrity, and exhibited with a proud sweep of his hand the\r\nsacrifice he had made of his personal interests to satisfy the law. Our\r\nvisit had been anticipated. The policeman's back was probably no sooner\r\nturned than the room was re-opened for business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                    A RAID ON THE STALE-BEER DIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidnight roll-call was over in the Elizabeth Street police-station,\r\nbut the reserves were held under orders. A raid was on foot, but\r\nwhether on the Chinese fan-tan games, on the opium joints of Mott and\r\nPell Streets, or on dens of even worse character, was a matter of\r\nguess-work in the men's room. When the last patrolman had come in from\r\nhis beat, all doubt was dispelled by the brief order \"To the Bend!\" The\r\nstale-beer dives were the object of the raid. The policemen buckled\r\ntheir belts tighter, and with expressive grunts of disgust took up\r\ntheir march toward Mulberry Street. Past the heathen temples of Mott\r\nStreet--there was some fun to be gotten out of a raid _there_--they\r\ntrooped, into \"the Bend,\" sending here and there a belated tramp\r\nscurrying in fright toward healthier quarters, and halted at the\r\nmouth of one of the hidden alleys. Squads were told off and sent\r\nto make a simultaneous descent on all the known tramps' burrows in\r\nthe block. Led by the sergeant, ours--I went along as a kind of war\r\ncorrespondent--groped its way in single file through the narrow rift\r\nbetween slimy walls to the tenements in the rear. Twice during our trip\r\nwe stumbled over tramps, both women, asleep in the passage. They were\r\nquietly passed to the rear, receiving sundry prods and punches on the\r\ntrip, and headed for the station in the grip of a policeman as a sort\r\nof advance guard of the coming army. After what seemed half a mile of\r\ngroping in the dark we emerged finally into the alley proper, where\r\nlight escaping through the cracks of closed shutters on both sides\r\nenabled us to make out the contour of three rickety frame tenements.\r\nSnatches of ribald songs and peals of coarse laughter reached us from\r\nnow this, now that of the unseen burrows.\r\n\r\n\"School is in,\" said the Sergeant drily as we stumbled down the worn\r\nsteps of the next cellar-way. A kick of his boot-heel sent the door\r\nflying into the room.\r\n\r\nA room perhaps a dozen feet square, with walls and ceiling that might\r\nonce have been clean--assuredly the floor had not in the memory of\r\nman, if indeed there was other floor than hard-trodden mud--but were\r\nnow covered with a brown crust that, touched with the end of a club,\r\ncame off in shuddering showers of crawling bugs, revealing the blacker\r\nfilth beneath. Grouped about a beer-keg that was propped on the wreck\r\nof a broken chair, a foul and ragged host of men and women, on boxes,\r\nbenches, and stools. Tomato-cans filled at the keg were passed from\r\nhand to hand. In the centre of the group a sallow, wrinkled hag,\r\nevidently the ruler of the feast, dealt out the hideous stuff. A pile\r\nof copper coins rattled in her apron, the very pennies received with\r\nsuch showers of blessings upon the giver that afternoon; the faces of\r\nsome of the women were familiar enough from the streets as those of\r\nbeggars forever whining for a penny, \"to keep a family from starving.\"\r\nTheir whine and boisterous hilarity were alike hushed now. In sullen,\r\ncowed submission they sat, evidently knowing what to expect. At the\r\nfirst glimpse of the uniform in the open door some in the group,\r\ncustomers with a record probably, had turned their heads away to avoid\r\nthe searching glance of the officer; while a few, less used to such\r\nscenes, stared defiantly.\r\n\r\nA single stride took the sergeant into the middle of the room, and\r\nwith a swinging blow of his club he knocked the faucet out of the keg\r\nand the half-filled can from the boss hag's hand. As the contents of\r\nboth splashed upon the floor, half a dozen of the group made a sudden\r\ndash, and with shoulders humped above their heads to shield their\r\nskulls against the dreaded locust broke for the door. They had not\r\ncounted upon the policemen outside. There was a brief struggle, two or\r\nthree heavy thumps, and the runaways were brought back to where their\r\ncomrades crouched in dogged silence.\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen!\" called the sergeant, completing his survey. \"Take them out.\r\n'Revolvers' all but one. Good for six months on the island, the whole\r\nlot.\" The exception was a young man not much if any over twenty, with a\r\nhard look of dissipation on his face. He seemed less unconcerned than\r\nthe rest, but tried hard to make up for it by putting on the boldest\r\nair he could. \"Come down early,\" commented the officer, shoving him\r\nalong with his stick. \"There is need of it. They don't last long at\r\nthis. That stuff is brewed to kill at long range.\"\r\n\r\nAt the head of the cellar-steps we encountered a similar procession\r\nfrom farther back in the alley, where still another was forming to take\r\nup its march to the station. Out in the street was heard the tramp of\r\nthe hosts already pursuing that well-trodden path, as with a fresh\r\ncomplement of men we entered the next stale-beer alley. There were\r\nfour dives in one cellar here. The filth and the stench were utterly\r\nunbearable; even the sergeant turned his back and fled after scattering\r\nthe crowd with his club and starting them toward the door. The very\r\ndog in the alley preferred the cold flags for a berth to the stifling\r\ncellar. We found it lying outside. Seventy-five tramps, male and\r\nfemale, were arrested in the four small rooms. In one of them, where\r\nthe air seemed thick enough to cut with a knife, we found a woman, a\r\nmother with a new-born babe on a heap of dirty straw. She was asleep\r\nand was left until an ambulance could be called to take her to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nReturning to the station with this batch, we found every window in the\r\nbuilding thrown open to the cold October wind, and the men from the\r\nsergeant down smoking the strongest cigars that could be obtained by\r\nway of disenfecting the place. Two hundred and seventy-five tramps had\r\nbeen jammed into the cells to be arraigned next morning in the police\r\ncourt on the charge of vagrancy, with the certain prospect of six\r\nmonths \"on the Island.\" Of the sentence at least they were sure. As to\r\nthe length of the men's stay the experienced official at the desk was\r\nsceptical, it being then within a month of an important election. If\r\ntramps have nothing else to call their own they have votes, and votes\r\nthat are for sale cheap for cash. About election time this gives them\r\na \"pull,\" at least by proxy. The sergeant observed, as if it were the\r\nmost natural thing in the world, that he had more than once seen the\r\nsame tramp sent to Blackwell's Island twice in twenty-four hours for\r\nsix months at a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ALL-NIGHT TWO-CENT RESTAURANT, IN \"THE BEND.\"]\r\n\r\nAs a thief never owns to his calling, however devoid of moral scruples,\r\npreferring to style himself a speculator, so this real home-product\r\nof the slums, the stale-beer dive, is known about \"the Bend\" by the\r\nmore dignified name of the two-cent restaurant. Usually, as in this\r\ninstance, it is in some cellar giving on a back alley. Doctored,\r\nunlicensed beer is its chief ware. Sometimes a cup of \"coffee\"\r\nand a stale roll may be had for two cents. The men pay the score.\r\nTo the women--unutterable horror of the suggestion--the place is\r\nfree. The beer is collected from the kegs put on the sidewalk by the\r\nsaloon-keeper to await the brewer's cart, and is touched up with drugs\r\nto put a froth on it. The privilege to sit all night on a chair, or\r\nsleep on a table, or in a barrel, goes with each round of drinks.\r\nGenerally an Italian, sometimes a negro, occasionally a woman, \"runs\"\r\nthe dive. Their customers, alike homeless and hopeless in their utter\r\nwretchedness, are the professional tramps, and these only. The meanest\r\nthief is infinitely above the stale-beer level. Once upon that plane\r\nthere is no escape. To sink below it is impossible; no one ever rose\r\nfrom it. One night spent in a stale-beer dive is like the traditional\r\nputting on of the uniform of the caste, the discarded rags of an old\r\ntramp. That stile once crossed, the lane has no longer a turn; and\r\ncontrary to the proverb, it is usually not long either.\r\n\r\nWith the gravitation of the Italian tramp landlord toward the old\r\nstronghold of the African on the West Side, a share of the stale-beer\r\ntraffic has left \"the Bend;\" but its headquarters will always remain\r\nthere, the real home of trampdom, just as Fourteenth Street is its\r\nlimit. No real tramp crosses that frontier after nightfall and in the\r\ndaytime only to beg. Repulsive as the business is, its profits to the\r\nItalian dive-keeper are considerable; in fact, barring a slight outlay\r\nin the ingredients that serve to give \"life\" to the beer-dregs, it\r\nis all profit. The \"banker\" who curses the Italian colony does not\r\ndespise taking a hand in it, and such a thing as a stale-beer trust\r\non a Mulberry Street scale may yet be among the possibilities. One of\r\nthese bankers, who was once known to the police as the keeper of one\r\nnotorious stale-beer dive and the active backer of others, is to-day an\r\nextensive manufacturer of macaroni, the owner of several big tenements\r\nand other real estate; and the capital, it is said, has all come out of\r\nhis old business. Very likely it is true.\r\n\r\nOn hot summer nights it is no rare experience when exploring the worst\r\nof the tenements in \"the Bend\" to find the hallways occupied by rows of\r\n\"sitters,\" tramps whom laziness or hard luck has prevented from earning\r\nenough by their day's \"labor\" to pay the admission fee to a stale-beer\r\ndive, and who have their reasons for declining the hospitality of the\r\npolice station lodging-rooms. Huddled together in loathsome files,\r\nthey squat there over night, or until an inquisitive policeman breaks\r\nup the congregation with his club, which in Mulberry Street has always\r\nfree swing. At that season the woman tramp predominates. The men, some\r\nof them at least, take to the railroad track and to camping out when\r\nthe nights grow warm, returning in the fall to prey on the city and to\r\nrecruit their ranks from the lazy, the shiftless, and the unfortunate.\r\nLike a foul loadstone, \"the Bend\" attracts and brings them back, no\r\nmatter how far they have wandered. For next to idleness the tramp loves\r\nrum; next to rum stale beer, its equivalent of the gutter. And the\r\nfirst and last go best together.\r\n\r\nAs \"sitters\" they occasionally find a job in the saloons about Chatham\r\nand Pearl Streets on cold winter nights, when the hallway is not\r\npracticable, that enables them to pick up a charity drink now and then\r\nand a bite of an infrequent sandwich. The barkeeper permits them to\r\nsit about the stove and by shivering invite the sympathy of transient\r\ncustomers. The dodge works well, especially about Christmas and\r\nelection time, and the sitters are able to keep comfortably filled\r\nup to the advantage of their host. But to look thoroughly miserable\r\nthey must keep awake. A tramp placidly dozing at the fire would not be\r\nan object of sympathy. To make sure that they do keep awake, the wily\r\nbartender makes them sit constantly swinging one foot like the pendulum\r\nof a clock. When it stops the slothful \"sitter\" is roused with a kick\r\nand \"fired out.\" It is said by those who profess to know that habit has\r\ncome to the rescue of oversleepy tramps and that the old rounders can\r\nswing hand or foot in their sleep without betraying themselves. In some\r\nsaloons \"sitters\" are let in at these seasons in fresh batches every\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nOn one of my visits to \"the Bend\" I came across a particularly ragged\r\nand disreputable tramp, who sat smoking his pipe on the rung of a\r\nladder with such evident philosophic contentment in the busy labor of a\r\nscore of rag-pickers all about him, that I bade him sit for a picture,\r\noffering him ten cents for the job. He accepted the offer with hardly a\r\nnod, and sat patiently watching me from his perch until I got ready for\r\nwork. Then he took the pipe out of his mouth and put it in his pocket,\r\ncalmly declaring that it was not included in the contract, and that it\r\nwas worth a quarter to have it go in the picture. The pipe, by the way,\r\nwas of clay, and of the two-for-a-cent kind. But I had to give in. The\r\nman, scarce ten seconds employed at honest labor, even at sitting down,\r\nat which he was an undoubted expert, had gone on strike. He knew his\r\nrights and the value of \"work,\" and was not to be cheated out of either.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRAMP.]\r\n\r\nWhence these tramps, and why the tramping? are questions oftener asked\r\nthan answered. Ill-applied charity and idleness answer the first\r\nquery. They are the whence, and to a large extent the why also. Once\r\nstarted on the career of a tramp, the man keeps to it because it is\r\nthe laziest. Tramps and toughs profess the same doctrine, that the\r\nworld owes them a living, but from stand-points that tend in different\r\ndirections. The tough does not become a tramp, save in rare instances,\r\nwhen old and broken down. Even then usually he is otherwise disposed\r\nof. The devil has various ways of taking care of his own. Nor is the\r\ntramps' army recruited from any certain class. All occupations and\r\nmost grades of society yield to it their contingent of idleness.\r\nOccasionally, from one cause or another, a recruit of a better stamp is\r\nforced into the ranks; but the first acceptance of alms puts a brand on\r\nthe able-bodied man which his moral nature rarely hold out to efface.\r\nHe seldom recovers his lost caste. The evolution is gradual, keeping\r\nstep with the increasing shabbiness of his clothes and corresponding\r\nloss of self-respect, until he reaches the bottom in \"the Bend.\"\r\n\r\nOf the tough the tramp doctrine that the world owes him a living makes\r\na thief; of the tramp a coward. Numbers only make him bold unless he\r\nhas to do with defenceless women. In the city the policemen keep him\r\nstraight enough. The women rob an occasional clothes-line when no one\r\nis looking, or steal the pail and scrubbing-brush with which they are\r\nset to clean up in the station-house lodging-rooms after their night's\r\nsleep. At the police station the roads of the tramp and the tough again\r\nconverge. In mid-winter, on the coldest nights, the sanitary police\r\ncorral the tramps here and in their lodging-houses and vaccinate them,\r\ndespite their struggles and many oaths that they have recently been\r\n\"scraped.\" The station-house is the sieve that sifts out the chaff from\r\nthe wheat, if there be any wheat there. A man goes from his first\r\nnight's sleep on the hard slab of a police station lodging-room to a\r\ndeck-hand's berth on an out-going steamer, to the recruiting office, to\r\nany work that is honest, or he goes \"to the devil or the dives, same\r\nthing,\" says my friend, the Sergeant, who knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEAP LODGING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the question of numbers with this tramps' army,\r\nanother factor of serious portent has to be taken into account: the\r\ncheap lodging-houses. In the caravanseries that line Chatham Street and\r\nthe Bowery, harboring nightly a population as large as that of many a\r\nthriving town, a home-made article of tramp and thief is turned out\r\nthat is attracting the increasing attention of the police, and offers\r\na field for the missionary's labors beside which most others seem of\r\nslight account. Within a year they have been stamped as nurseries of\r\ncrime by the chief of the Secret Police,[10] the sort of crime that\r\nfeeds especially on idleness and lies ready to the hand of fatal\r\nopportunity. In the same strain one of the justices on the police court\r\nbench sums up his long experience as a committing magistrate: \"The\r\nten-cent lodging-houses more than counterbalance the good done by the\r\nfree reading-room, lectures, and all other agencies of reform. Such\r\nlodging-houses have caused more destitution, more beggary and crime\r\nthan any other agency I know of.\" A very slight acquaintance with the\r\nsubject is sufficient to convince the observer that neither authority\r\noverstates the fact. The two officials had reference, however, to two\r\ndifferent grades of lodging-houses. The cost of a night's lodging makes\r\nthe difference. There is a wider gap between the \"hotel\"--they are all\r\nhotels--that charges a quarter and the one that furnishes a bed for a\r\ndime than between the bridal suite and the every-day hall bedroom of\r\nthe ordinary hostelry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Inspector Byrnes on Lodging-houses, in the North American\r\nReview, September, 1889.]\r\n\r\nThe metropolis is to lots of people like a lighted candle to the moth.\r\nIt attracts them in swarms that come year after year with the vague\r\nidea that they can get along here if anywhere; that something is bound\r\nto turn up among so many. Nearly all are young men, unsettled in life,\r\nmany--most of them, perhaps--fresh from good homes, beyond a doubt\r\nwith honest hopes of getting a start in the city and making a way for\r\nthemselves. Few of them have much money to waste while looking around,\r\nand the cheapness of the lodging offered is an object. Fewer still know\r\nanything about the city and its pitfalls. They have come in search\r\nof crowds, of \"life,\" and they gravitate naturally to the Bowery,\r\nthe great democratic highway of the city, where the twenty-five-cent\r\nlodging-houses take them in. In the alleged reading-rooms of these\r\ngreat barracks, that often have accommodations, such as they are,\r\nfor two, three, and even four hundred guests, they encounter three\r\ndistinct classes of associates: the great mass adventurers like\r\nthemselves, waiting there for something to turn up; a much smaller\r\nclass of respectable clerks or mechanics, who, too poor or too lonely\r\nto have a home of their own, live this way from year to year; and\r\nlastly the thief in search of recruits for his trade. The sights the\r\nyoung stranger sees, and the company he keeps, in the Bowery are not\r\nof a kind to strengthen any moral principle he may have brought away\r\nfrom home, and by the time his money is gone, with no work yet in\r\nsight, and he goes down a step, a long step, to the fifteen-cent\r\nlodging-house, he is ready for the tempter whom he finds waiting for\r\nhim there, reinforced by the contingent of ex-convicts returning from\r\nthe prisons after having served out their sentences for robbery or\r\ntheft. Then it is that the something he has been waiting for turns\r\nup. The police returns have the record of it. \"In nine cases out of\r\nten,\" says Inspector Byrnes, \"he turns out a thief, or a burglar, if,\r\nindeed, he does not sooner or later become a murderer.\" As a matter\r\nof fact, some of the most atrocious of recent murders have been the\r\nresult of schemes of robbery hatched in these houses, and so frequent\r\nand bold have become the depredations of the lodging-house thieves,\r\nthat the authorities have been compelled to make a public demand for\r\nmore effective laws that shall make them subject at all times to police\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nInspector Byrnes observes that in the last two or three years at\r\nleast four hundred young men have been arrested for petty crimes that\r\noriginated in the lodging-houses, and that in many cases it was their\r\nfirst step in crime. He adds his testimony to the notorious fact that\r\nthree-fourths of the young men called on to plead to generally petty\r\noffences in the courts are under twenty years of age, poorly clad, and\r\nwithout means. The bearing of the remark is obvious. One of the, to the\r\npolice, well-known thieves who lived, when out of jail, at the Windsor,\r\na well-known lodging-house in the Bowery, went to Johnstown after the\r\nflood and was shot and killed there while robbing the dead.\r\n\r\nAn idea of just how this particular scheme of corruption works, with\r\nan extra touch of infamy thrown in, may be gathered from the story\r\nof David Smith, the \"New York Fagin,\" who was convicted and sent to\r\nprison last year through the instrumentality of the Society for\r\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Here is the account from the\r\nSociety's last report:\r\n\r\n\"The boy, Edward Mulhearn, fourteen years old, had run away from his\r\nhome in Jersey City, thinking he might find work and friends in New\r\nYork. He may have been a trifle wild. He met Smith on the Bowery and\r\nrecognized him as an acquaintance. When Smith offered him a supper\r\nand bed he was only too glad to accept. Smith led the boy to a vile\r\nlodging-house on the Bowery, where he introduced him to his 'pals' and\r\nswore he would make a man of him before he was a week older. Next day\r\nhe took the unsuspecting Edward all over the Bowery and Grand Street,\r\nshowed him the sights and drew his attention to the careless way the\r\nladies carried their bags and purses and the easy thing it was to get\r\nthem. He induced Edward to try his hand. Edward tried and won. He was\r\nricher by three dollars! It did seem easy. 'Of course it is,' said his\r\ncompanion. From that time Smith took the boy on a number of thieving\r\nraids, but he never seemed to become adept enough to be trusted out\r\nof range of the 'Fagin's' watchful eye. When he went out alone he\r\ngenerally returned empty-handed. This did not suit Smith. It was then\r\nhe conceived the idea of turning this little inferior thief into a\r\nsuperior beggar. He took the boy into his room and burned his arms\r\nwith a hot iron. The boy screamed and entreated in vain. The merciless\r\nwretch pressed the iron deep into the tender flesh, and afterward\r\napplied acid to the raw wound.\r\n\r\n\"Thus prepared, with his arm inflamed, swollen, and painful, Edward was\r\nsent out every day by this fiend, who never let him out of his sight,\r\nand threatened to burn his arm off if he did not beg money enough. He\r\nwas instructed to tell people the wound had been caused by acid falling\r\nupon his arm at the works. Edward was now too much under the man's\r\ninfluence to resist or disobey him. He begged hard and handed Smith the\r\npennies faithfully. He received in return bad food and worse treatment.\"\r\n\r\nThe reckoning came when the wretch encountered the boy's father, in\r\nsearch of his child, in the Bowery, and fell under suspicion of knowing\r\nmore than he pretended of the lad's whereabouts. He was found in his\r\nden with a half dozen of his chums revelling on the proceeds of the\r\nboy's begging for the day.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five cent lodging-house keeps up the pretence of a bedroom,\r\nthough the head-high partition enclosing a space just large enough to\r\nhold a cot and a chair and allow the man room to pull off his clothes\r\nis the shallowest of all pretences. The fifteen-cent bed stands boldly\r\nforth without screen in a room full of bunks with sheets as yellow and\r\nblankets as foul. At the ten-cent level the locker for the sleeper's\r\nclothes disappears. There is no longer need of it. The tramp limit is\r\nreached, and there is nothing to lock up save, on general principles,\r\nthe lodger. Usually the ten- and seven-cent lodgings are different\r\ngrades of the same abomination. Some sort of an apology for a bed, with\r\nmattress and blanket, represents the aristocratic purchase of the tramp\r\nwho, by a lucky stroke of beggary, has exchanged the chance of an empty\r\nbox or ash-barrel for shelter on the quality floor of one of these\r\n\"hotels.\" A strip of canvas, strung between rough timbers, without\r\ncovering of any kind, does for the couch of the seven-cent lodger who\r\nprefers the questionable comfort of a red-hot stove close to his elbow\r\nto the revelry of the stale-beer dive. It is not the most secure perch\r\nin the world. Uneasy sleepers roll off at intervals, but they have not\r\nfar to fall to the next tier of bunks, and the commotion that ensues\r\nis speedily quieted by the boss and his club. On cold winter nights,\r\nwhen every bunk had its tenant, I have stood in such a lodging-room\r\nmore than once, and listening to the snoring of the sleepers like the\r\nregular strokes of an engine, and the slow creaking of the beams under\r\ntheir restless weight, imagined myself on shipboard and experienced the\r\nvery real nausea of sea-sickness. The one thing that did not favor the\r\ndeception was the air; its character could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUNKS IN A SEVEN-CENT LODGING-HOUSE, PELL STREET.]\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of one of these seven-cent houses was known to me\r\nas a man of reputed wealth and respectability. He \"ran\" three such\r\nestablishments and made, it was said, $8,000 a year clear profit on\r\nhis investment. He lived in a handsome house quite near to the stylish\r\nprecincts of Murray Hill, where the nature of his occupation was not\r\nsuspected. A notice that was posted on the wall of the lodgers' room\r\nsuggested at least an effort to maintain his up-town standing in the\r\nslums. It read: \"No swearing or loud talking after nine o'clock.\"\r\nBefore nine no exceptions were taken to the natural vulgarity of the\r\nplace; but that was the limit.\r\n\r\nThere are no licensed lodging-houses known to me which charge less than\r\nseven cents for even such a bed as this canvas strip, though there are\r\nunlicensed ones enough where one may sleep on the floor for five cents\r\na spot, or squat in a sheltered hallway for three. The police station\r\nlodging-house, where the soft side of a plank is the regulation couch,\r\nis next in order. The manner in which this police bed is \"made up\" is\r\ninteresting in its simplicity. The loose planks that make the platform\r\nare simply turned over, and the job is done, with an occasional coat\r\nof white-wash thrown in to sweeten things. I know of only one easier\r\nway, but, so far as I am informed, it has never been introduced in this\r\ncountry. It used to be practised, if report spoke truly, in certain\r\nold-country towns. The \"bed\" was represented by clothes-lines stretched\r\nacross the room upon which the sleepers hung by the arm-pits for a\r\npenny a night. In the morning the boss woke them up by simply untying\r\nthe line at one end and letting it go with its load; a labor-saving\r\ndevice certainly, and highly successful in attaining the desired end.\r\n\r\nAccording to the police figures, 4,974,025 separate lodgings were\r\nfurnished last year by these dormitories, between two and three\r\nhundred in number, and, adding the 147,634 lodgings furnished by the\r\nstation-houses, the total of the homeless army was 5,121,659, an\r\naverage of over fourteen thousand homeless men[11] for every night\r\nin the year! The health officers, professional optimists always in\r\nmatters that trench upon their official jurisdiction, insist that\r\nthe number is not quite so large as here given. But, apart from any\r\nslight discrepancy in the figures, the more important fact remains\r\nthat last year's record of lodgers is an all round increase over the\r\nprevious year's of over three hundred thousand, and that this has\r\nbeen the ratio of growth of the business during the last three years,\r\nthe period of which Inspector Byrnes complains as turning out so many\r\nyoung criminals with the lodging-house stamp upon them. More than half\r\nof the lodging-houses are in the Bowery district, that is to say, the\r\nFourth, Sixth, and Tenth Wards, and they harbor nearly three-fourths\r\nof their crowds. The calculation that more than nine thousand homeless\r\nyoung men lodge nightly along Chatham Street and the Bowery, between\r\nthe City Hall and the Cooper Union, is probably not far out of the way.\r\nThe City Missionary finds them there far less frequently than the thief\r\nin need of helpers. Appropriately enough, nearly one-fifth of all the\r\npawn-shops in the city and one-sixth of all the saloons are located\r\nhere, while twenty-seven per cent. of all the arrests on the police\r\nbooks have been credited to the district for the last two years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Deduct 69,111 women lodgers in the police stations.]\r\n\r\nAbout election time, especially in Presidential elections, the\r\nlodging-houses come out strong on the side of the political boss who\r\nhas the biggest \"barrel.\" The victory in political contests, in the\r\nthree wards I have mentioned of all others, is distinctly to the\r\ngeneral with the strongest battalions, and the lodging-houses are his\r\nfavorite recruiting ground. The colonization of voters is an evil of\r\nthe first magnitude, none the less because both parties smirch their\r\nhands with it, and for that reason next to hopeless. Honors are easy,\r\nwhere the two \"machines,\" intrenched in their strongholds, outbid each\r\nother across the Bowery in open rivalry as to who shall commit the most\r\nflagrant frauds at the polls. Semi-occasionally a champion offender is\r\ncaught and punished, as was, not long ago, the proprietor of one of the\r\nbiggest Bowery lodging-houses. But such scenes are largely spectacular,\r\nif not prompted by some hidden motive of revenge that survives from\r\nthe contest. Beyond a doubt Inspector Byrnes speaks by the card when\r\nhe observes that \"usually this work is done in the interest of some\r\nlocal political boss, who stands by the owner of the house, in case the\r\nlatter gets into trouble.\" For standing by, read twisting the machinery\r\nof outraged justice so that its hand shall fall not too heavily upon\r\nthe culprit, or miss him altogether. One of the houses that achieved\r\nprofitable notoriety in this way in many successive elections, a\r\nnotorious tramps' resort in Houston Street, was lately given up, and\r\nhas most appropriately been turned into a bar-factory, thus still\r\ncontributing, though in a changed form, to the success of \"the cause.\"\r\nIt must be admitted that the black tramp who herds in the West Side\r\n\"hotels\" is more discriminating in this matter of electioneering\r\nthan his white brother. He at least exhibits some real loyalty in\r\ninvariably selling his vote to the Republican bidder for a dollar,\r\nwhile he charges the Democratic boss a dollar and a half. In view of\r\nthe well-known facts, there is a good deal of force in the remark made\r\nby a friend of ballot reform during the recent struggle over that\r\nhotly contested issue, that real ballot reform will do more to knock\r\nout cheap lodging-houses than all the regulations of police and health\r\nofficers together.\r\n\r\nThe experiment made by a well-known stove manufacturer a winter or two\r\nago in the way of charity, might have thrown much desired light on\r\nthe question of the number of tramps in the city, could it have been\r\ncarried to a successful end. He opened a sort of breakfast shop for\r\nthe idle and unemployed in the region of Washington Square, offering\r\nto all who had no money a cup of coffee and a roll for nothing. The\r\nfirst morning he had a dozen customers, the next about two hundred. The\r\nnumber kept growing until one morning, at the end of two weeks, found\r\nby actual count 2,014 shivering creatures in line waiting their turn\r\nfor a seat at his tables. The shop was closed that day. It was one of\r\nthe rare instances of too great a rush of custom wrecking a promising\r\nbusiness, and the great problem remained unsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCHINATOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the tabernacles of Jewry and the shrines of the Bend, Joss\r\nhas cheekily planted his pagan worship of idols, chief among which\r\nare the celestial worshipper's own gain and lusts. Whatever may be\r\nsaid about the Chinaman being a thousand years behind the age on his\r\nown shores, here he is distinctly abreast of it in his successful\r\nscheming to \"make it pay.\" It is doubtful if there is anything he does\r\nnot turn to a paying account, from his religion down, or up, as one\r\nprefers. At the risk of distressing some well-meaning, but, I fear,\r\ntoo trustful people, I state it in advance as my opinion, based on the\r\nsteady observation of years, that all attempts to make an effective\r\nChristian of John Chinaman will remain abortive in this generation; of\r\nthe next I have, if anything, less hope. Ages of senseless idolatry,\r\na mere grub-worship, have left him without the essential qualities\r\nfor appreciating the gentle teachings of a faith whose motive and\r\nunselfish spirit are alike beyond his grasp. He lacks the handle of a\r\nstrong faith in something, anything however wrong, to catch him by.\r\nThere is nothing strong about him, except his passions when aroused.\r\nI am convinced that he adopts Christianity, when he adopts it at all,\r\nas he puts on American clothes, with what the politicians would call\r\nan ulterior motive, some sort of gain in the near prospect--washing, a\r\nChristian wife, perhaps, anything he happens to rate for the moment\r\nabove his cherished pigtail. It may be that I judge him too harshly.\r\nExceptions may be found. Indeed, for the credit of the race, I hope\r\nthere are such. But I am bound to say my hope is not backed by lively\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nChinatown as a spectacle is disappointing. Next-door neighbor to\r\nthe Bend, it has little of its outdoor stir and life, none of its\r\ngayly-colored rags or picturesque filth and poverty. Mott Street is\r\nclean to distraction: the laundry stamp is on it, though the houses\r\nare chiefly of the conventional tenement-house type, with nothing to\r\nrescue them from the everyday dismal dreariness of their kind save\r\nhere and there a splash of dull red or yellow, a sign, hung endways\r\nand with streamers of red flannel tacked on, that announces in Chinese\r\ncharacters that Dr. Chay Yen Chong sells Chinese herb medicines, or\r\nthat Won Lung & Co.--queer contradiction--take in washing, or deal\r\nout tea and groceries. There are some gimcracks in the second story\r\nfire-escape of one of the houses, signifying that Joss or a club has a\r\nhabitation there. An American patent medicine concern has seized the\r\nopportunity to decorate the back-ground with its cabalistic trade-mark,\r\nthat in this company looks as foreign as the rest. Doubtless the\r\nprivilege was bought for cash. It will buy anything in Chinatown, Joss\r\nhimself included, as indeed, why should it not? He was bought for cash\r\nacross the sea and came here under the law that shuts out the live\r\nChinaman, but lets in his dead god on payment of the statutory duty\r\non bric-à-brac. Red and yellow are the holiday colors of Chinatown as\r\nof the Bend, but they do not lend brightness in Mott Street as around\r\nthe corner in Mulberry. Rather, they seem to descend to the level of\r\nthe general dulness, and glower at you from doors and windows, from\r\nthe telegraph pole that is the official organ of Chinatown and from\r\nthe store signs, with blank, un-meaning stare, suggesting nothing,\r\nasking no questions, and answering none. Fifth Avenue is not duller on\r\na rainy day than Mott Street to one in search of excitement. Whatever\r\nis on foot goes on behind closed doors. Stealth and secretiveness are\r\nas much part of the Chinaman in New York as the cat-like tread of his\r\nfelt shoes. His business, as his domestic life, shuns the light, less\r\nbecause there is anything to conceal than because that is the way of\r\nthe man. Perhaps the attitude of American civilization toward the\r\nstranger, whom it invited in, has taught him that way. At any rate,\r\nthe very doorways of his offices and shops are fenced off by queer,\r\nforbidding partitions suggestive of a continual state of siege. The\r\nstranger who enters through the crooked approach is received with\r\nsudden silence, a sullen stare, and an angry \"Vat you vant?\" that\r\nbreathes annoyance and distrust.\r\n\r\nTrust not him who trusts no one, is as safe a rule in Chinatown as out\r\nof it. Were not Mott Street overawed in its isolation, it would not be\r\nsafe to descend this open cellar-way, through which come the pungent\r\nodor of burning opium and the clink of copper coins on the table. As\r\nit is, though safe, it is not profitable to intrude. At the first\r\nfoot-fall of leather soles on the steps the hum of talk ceases, and the\r\ngroup of celestials, crouching over their game of fan tan, stop playing\r\nand watch the comer with ugly looks. Fan tan is their ruling passion.\r\nThe average Chinaman, the police will tell you, would rather gamble\r\nthan eat any day, and they have ample experience to back them. Only\r\nthe fellow in the bunk smokes away, indifferent to all else but his\r\npipe and his own enjoyment. It is a mistake to assume that Chinatown is\r\nhoneycombed with opium \"joints.\" There are a good many more outside\r\nof it than in it. The celestials do not monopolize the pipe. In Mott\r\nStreet there is no need of them. Not a Chinese home or burrow there,\r\nbut has its bunk and its lay-out, where they can be enjoyed safe from\r\npolice interference. The Chinaman smokes opium as Caucasians smoke\r\ntobacco, and apparently with little worse effect upon himself. But woe\r\nunto the white victim upon which his pitiless drug gets its grip!\r\n\r\nThe bloused pedlars who, with arms buried half to the elbow in their\r\ntrousers' pockets, lounge behind their stock of watermelon seed and\r\nsugar-cane, cut in lengths to suit the purse of the buyer, disdain to\r\noffer the barbarian their wares. Chinatown, that does most things by\r\ncontraries, rules it holiday style to carry its hands in its pockets,\r\nand its denizens follow the fashion, whether in blue blouse, in gray,\r\nor in brown, with shining and braided pig-tail dangling below the\r\nknees, or with hair cropped short above a coat collar of \"Melican\"\r\ncut. All kinds of men are met, but no women--none at least with almond\r\neyes. The reason is simple: there are none. A few, a very few, Chinese\r\nmerchants have wives of their own color, but they are seldom or never\r\nseen in the street. The \"wives\" of Chinatown are of a different stock\r\nthat comes closer home.\r\n\r\nFrom the teeming tenements to the right and left of it come the white\r\nslaves of its dens of vice and their infernal drug, that have infused\r\ninto the \"Bloody Sixth\" Ward a subtler poison than ever the stale-beer\r\ndives knew, or the \"sudden death\" of the Old Brewery. There are houses,\r\ndozens of them, in Mott and Pell Streets, that are literally jammed,\r\nfrom the \"joint\" in the cellar to the attic, with these hapless victims\r\nof a passion which, once acquired, demands the sacrifice of every\r\ninstinct of decency to its insatiate desire. There is a church in Mott\r\nStreet, at the entrance to Chinatown, that stands as a barrier between\r\nit and the tenements beyond. Its young men have waged unceasing war\r\nupon the monstrous wickedness for years, but with very little real\r\nresult. I have in mind a house in Pell Street that has been raided no\r\nend of times by the police, and its population emptied upon Blackwell's\r\nIsland, or into the reformatories, yet is to-day honeycombed with\r\nscores of the conventional households of the Chinese quarter: the men\r\nworshippers of Joss; the women, all white, girls hardly yet grown to\r\nwomanhood, worshipping nothing save the pipe that has enslaved them\r\nbody and soul. Easily tempted from homes that have no claim upon the\r\nname, they rarely or never return. Mott Street gives up its victims\r\nonly to the Charity Hospital or the Potter's Field. Of the depth of\r\ntheir fall no one is more thoroughly aware than these girls themselves;\r\nno one less concerned about it. The calmness with which they discuss\r\nit, while insisting illogically upon the fiction of a marriage that\r\ndeceives no one, is disheartening. Their misery is peculiarly fond of\r\ncompany, and an amount of visiting goes on in these households that\r\nmakes it extremely difficult for the stranger to untangle them. I came\r\nacross a company of them \"hitting the pipe\" together, on a tour through\r\ntheir dens one night with the police captain of the precinct. The girls\r\nknew him, called him by name, offered him a pipe, and chatted with\r\nhim about the incidents of their acquaintance, how many times he had\r\n\"sent them up,\" and their chances of \"lasting\" much longer. There was\r\nno shade of regret in their voices, nothing but utter indifference and\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nOne thing about them was conspicuous: their scrupulous neatness. It\r\nis the distinguishing mark of Chinatown, outwardly and physically. It\r\nis not altogether by chance the Chinaman has chosen the laundry as\r\nhis distinctive field. He is by nature as clean as the cat, which he\r\nresembles in his traits of cruel cunning, and savage fury when aroused.\r\nOn this point of cleanliness he insists in his domestic circle,\r\nyielding in others with crafty submissiveness to the caprice of the\r\ngirls, who \"boss\" him in a very independent manner, fretting vengefully\r\nunder the yoke they loathe, but which they know right well they can\r\nnever shake off, once they have put the pipe to their lips and given\r\nMott Street a mortgage upon their souls for all time. To the priest,\r\nwhom they call in when the poison racks the body, they pretend that\r\nthey are yet their own masters; but he knows that it is an idle boast,\r\nleast of all believed by themselves. As he walks with them the few\r\nshort steps to the Potter's Field, he hears the sad story he has heard\r\ntold over and over again, of father, mother, home, and friends given\r\nup for the accursed pipe, and stands hopeless and helpless before the\r\ncolossal evil for which he knows no remedy.\r\n\r\nThe frequent assertions of the authorities that at least no girls under\r\nage are wrecked on this Chinese shoal, are disproved by the observation\r\nof those who go frequently among these dens, though the smallest girl\r\nwill invariably, and usually without being asked, insist that she is\r\nsixteen, and so of age to choose the company she keeps. Such assertions\r\nare not to be taken seriously. Even while I am writing, the morning\r\nreturns from one of the precincts that pass through my hands report the\r\narrest of a Chinaman for \"inveigling little girls into his laundry,\"\r\none of the hundred outposts of Chinatown that are scattered all over\r\nthe city, as the outer threads of the spider's web that holds its prey\r\nfast. Reference to case No. 39,499 in this year's report of the Society\r\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, will discover one of the\r\nmuch travelled roads to Chinatown. The girl whose story it tells was\r\nthirteen, and one of six children abandoned by a dissipated father. She\r\nhad been discharged from an Eighth Avenue store, where she was employed\r\nas cash girl, and, being afraid to tell her mother, floated about until\r\nshe landed in a Chinese laundry. The judge heeded her tearful prayer,\r\nand sent her home with her mother, but she was back again in a little\r\nwhile despite all promises of reform.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IN A CHINESE JOINT.]\r\n\r\nHer tyrant knows well that she will come, and patiently bides his time.\r\nWhen her struggles in the web have ceased at last, he rules no longer\r\nwith gloved hand. A specimen of celestial logic from the home circle at\r\nthis period came home to me with a personal application, one evening\r\nwhen I attempted, with a policeman, to stop a Chinaman whom we found\r\nbeating his white \"wife\" with a broom-handle in a Mott Street cellar.\r\nHe was angry at our interference, and declared vehemently that she was\r\n\"bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"S'ppose your wifee bad, you no lickee her?\" he asked, as if there\r\ncould be no appeal from such a common-sense proposition as that. My\r\nassurance that I did not, that such a thing could not occur to me,\r\nstruck him dumb with amazement. He eyed me a while in stupid silence,\r\npoked the linen in his tub, stole another look, and made up his mind. A\r\ngleam of intelligence shone in his eye, and pity and contempt struggled\r\nin his voice. \"Then, I guess, she lickee you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNo small commotion was caused in Chinatown once upon the occasion of an\r\nexpedition I undertook, accompanied by a couple of police detectives,\r\nto photograph Joss. Some conscienceless wag spread the report, after\r\nwe were gone, that his picture was wanted for the Rogues' Gallery\r\nat Headquarters. The insult was too gross to be passed over without\r\natonement of some sort. Two roast pigs made matters all right with\r\nhis offended majesty of Mott Street, and with his attendant priests,\r\nwho bear a very practical hand in the worship by serving as the\r\ndivine stomach, as it were. They eat the good things set before their\r\nrice-paper master, unless, as once happened, some sacrilegious tramp\r\nsneaks in and gets ahead of them. The practical way in which this\r\npeople combine worship with business is certainly admirable. I was\r\ntold that the scrawl covering the wall on both sides of the shrine\r\nstood for the names of the pillars of the church or club--the Joss\r\nHouse is both--that they might have their reward in this world, no\r\nmatter what happened to them in the next. There was another inscription\r\noverhead that needed no interpreter. In familiar English letters,\r\ncopied bodily from the trade dollar, was the sentiment: \"In God we\r\ntrust.\" The priest pointed to it with undisguised pride and attempted\r\nan explanation, from which I gathered that the inscription was intended\r\nas a diplomatic courtesy, a delicate international compliment to the\r\n\"Melican Joss,\" the almighty dollar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"THE OFFICIAL ORGAN OF CHINATOWN.\"]\r\n\r\nChinatown has enlisted the telegraph for the dissemination of public\r\nintelligence, but it has got hold of the contrivance by the wrong\r\nend. As the wires serve us in newspaper-making, so the Chinaman makes\r\nuse of the pole for the same purpose. The telegraph pole, of which I\r\nspoke as the real official organ of Chinatown, stands not far from\r\nthe Joss House in Mott Street, in full view from Chatham Square. In\r\nit centres the real life of the colony, its gambling news. Every day\r\nyellow and red notices are posted upon it by unseen hands, announcing\r\nthat in such and such a cellar a fan tan game will be running that\r\nnight, or warning the faithful that a raid is intended on this or that\r\ngame through the machination of a rival interest. A constant stream\r\nof plotting and counter-plotting makes up the round of Chinese social\r\nand political existence. I do not pretend to understand the exact\r\npolitical structure of the colony, or its internal government. Even\r\ndiscarding as idle the stories of a secret cabal with power over life\r\nand death, and authority to enforce its decrees, there is evidence\r\nenough that the Chinese consider themselves subject to the laws of the\r\nland only when submission is unavoidable, and that they are governed\r\nby a code of their own, the very essence of which is rejection of all\r\nother authority except under compulsion. If now and then some horrible\r\ncrime in the Chinese colony, a murder of such hideous ferocity as\r\none I have a very vivid recollection of, where the murderer stabbed\r\nhis victim (both Chinamen, of course) in the back with a meat-knife,\r\nplunging it in to the hilt no less than seventeen times, arouses the\r\npopular prejudice to a suspicion that it was \"ordered,\" only the\r\nsuspected themselves are to blame, for they appear to rise up as one\r\nman to shield the criminal. The difficulty of tracing the motive of the\r\ncrime and the murderer is extreme, and it is the rarest of all results\r\nthat the police get on the track of either. The obstacles in the way\r\nof hunting down an Italian murderer are as nothing to the opposition\r\nencountered in Chinatown. Nor is the failure of the pursuit wholly to\r\nbe ascribed to the familiar fact that to Caucasian eyes \"all Chinamen\r\nlook alike,\" but rather to their acting \"alike,\" in a body, to defeat\r\ndiscovery at any cost.\r\n\r\nWithal the police give the Chinese the name of being the \"quietest\r\npeople down there,\" meaning in the notoriously turbulent Sixth Ward;\r\nand they are. The one thing they desire above all is to be let alone,\r\na very natural wish perhaps, considering all the circumstances. If it\r\nwere a laudable, or even an allowable ambition that prompts it, they\r\nmight be humored with advantage, probably, to both sides. But the facts\r\nshow too plainly that it is not, and that in their very exclusiveness\r\nand reserve they are a constant and terrible menace to society, wholly\r\nregardless of their influence upon the industrial problems which\r\ntheir presence confuses. The severest official scrutiny, the harshest\r\nrepressive measures are justifiable in Chinatown, orderly as it appears\r\non the surface, even more than in the Bend, and the case is infinitely\r\nmore urgent. To the peril that threatens there all the senses are\r\nalert, whereas the poison that proceeds from Mott Street puts mind and\r\nbody to sleep, to work out its deadly purpose in the corruption of the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThis again may be set down as a harsh judgment. I may be accused of\r\ninciting persecution of an unoffending people. Far from it. Granted,\r\nthat the Chinese are in no sense a desirable element of the population,\r\nthat they serve no useful purpose here, whatever they may have done\r\nelsewhere in other days, yet to this it is a sufficient answer that\r\nthey are here, and that, having let them in, we must make the best of\r\nit. This is a time for very plain speaking on this subject. Rather than\r\nbanish the Chinaman, I would have the door opened wider--for his wife;\r\nmake it a condition of his coming or staying that he bring his wife\r\nwith him. Then, at least, he might not be what he now is and remains, a\r\nhomeless stranger among us. Upon this hinges the real Chinese question,\r\nin our city at all events, as I see it. To assert that the victims of\r\nhis drug and his base passions would go to the bad anyhow, is begging\r\nthe question. They might and they might not. The chance is the span\r\nbetween life and death. From any other form of dissipation than that\r\nfor which Chinatown stands there is recovery: for the victims of any\r\nother vice, hope. For these there is neither hope nor recovery; nothing\r\nbut death--moral, mental, and physical death.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                                JEWTOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenements grow taller, and the gaps in their ranks close up rapidly\r\nas we cross the Bowery and, leaving Chinatown and the Italians behind,\r\ninvade the Hebrew quarter. Baxter Street, with its interminable rows\r\nof old clothes shops and its brigades of pullers-in--nicknamed \"the\r\nBay\" in honor, perhaps, of the tars who lay to there after a cruise to\r\nstock up their togs, or maybe after the \"schooners\" of beer plentifully\r\nbespoke in that latitude--Bayard Street, with its synagogues and its\r\ncrowds, gave us a foretaste of it. No need of asking here where we\r\nare. The jargon of the street, the signs of the sidewalk, the manner\r\nand dress of the people, their unmistakable physiognomy, betray their\r\nrace at every step. Men with queer skull-caps, venerable beard, and the\r\noutlandish long-skirted kaftan of the Russian Jew, elbow the ugliest\r\nand the handsomest women in the land. The contrast is startling. The\r\nold women are hags; the young, houris. Wives and mothers at sixteen, at\r\nthirty they are old. So thoroughly has the chosen people crowded out\r\nthe Gentiles in the Tenth Ward that, when the great Jewish holidays\r\ncome around every year, the public schools in the district have\r\npractically to close up. Of their thousands of pupils scarce a handful\r\ncome to school. Nor is there any suspicion that the rest are playing\r\nhookey. They stay honestly home to celebrate. There is no mistaking\r\nit: we are in Jewtown.\r\n\r\nIt is said that nowhere in the world are so many people crowded\r\ntogether on a square mile as here. The average five-story tenement adds\r\na story or two to its stature in Ludlow Street and an extra building\r\non the rear lot, and yet the sign \"To Let\" is the rarest of all there.\r\nHere is one seven stories high. The sanitary policeman whose beat\r\nthis is will tell you that it contains thirty-six families, but the\r\nterm has a widely different meaning here and on the avenues. In this\r\nhouse, where a case of small-pox was reported, there were fifty-eight\r\nbabies and thirty-eight children that were over five years of age. In\r\nEssex Street two small rooms in a six-story tenement were made to hold\r\na \"family\" of father and mother, twelve children, and six boarders.\r\nThe boarder plays as important a part in the domestic economy of\r\nJewtown as the lodger in the Mulberry Street Bend. These are samples\r\nof the packing of the population that has run up the record here to\r\nthe rate of three hundred and thirty thousand per square mile. The\r\ndensest crowding of Old London, I pointed out before, never got beyond\r\na hundred and seventy-five thousand. Even the alley is crowded out.\r\nThrough dark hallways and filthy cellars, crowded, as is every foot\r\nof the street, with dirty children, the settlements in the rear are\r\nreached. Thieves know how to find them when pursued by the police,\r\nand the tramps that sneak in on chilly nights to fight for the warm\r\nspot in the yard over some baker's oven. They are out of place in this\r\nhive of busy industry, and they know it. It has nothing in common with\r\nthem or with their philosophy of life, that the world owes the idler\r\na living. Life here means the hardest kind of work almost from the\r\ncradle. The world as a debtor has no credit in Jewtown. Its promise\r\nto pay wouldn't buy one of the old hats that are hawked about Hester\r\nStreet, unless backed by security representing labor done at lowest\r\nmarket rates. But this army of workers must have bread. It is cheap and\r\nfilling, and bakeries abound. Wherever they are in the tenements the\r\ntramp will skulk in, if he can. There is such a tramps' roost in the\r\nrear of a tenement near the lower end of Ludlow Street, that is never\r\nwithout its tenants in winter. By a judicious practice of flopping over\r\non the stone pavement at intervals, and thus warming one side at a\r\ntime, and with an empty box to put the feet in, it is possible to keep\r\nreasonably comfortable there even on a rainy night. In summer the yard\r\nis the only one in the neighborhood that does not do duty as a public\r\ndormitory.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A TRAMP'S NEST IN LUDLOW STREET.]\r\n\r\nThrift is the watchword of Jewtown, as of its people the world over. It\r\nis at once its strength and its fatal weakness, its cardinal virtue and\r\nits foul disgrace. Become an over-mastering passion with these people\r\nwho come here in droves from Eastern Europe to escape persecution,\r\nfrom which freedom could be bought only with gold, it has enslaved\r\nthem in bondage worse than that from which they fled. Money is their\r\nGod. Life itself is of little value compared with even the leanest\r\nbank account. In no other spot does life wear so intensely bald and\r\nmaterialistic an aspect as in Ludlow Street. Over and over again I\r\nhave met with instances of these Polish or Russian Jews deliberately\r\nstarving themselves to the point of physical exhaustion, while working\r\nnight and day at a tremendous pressure to save a little money. An\r\navenging Nemesis pursues this headlong hunt for wealth; there is no\r\nworse paid class anywhere. I once put the question to one of their\r\nown people, who, being a pawnbroker, and an unusually intelligent and\r\ncharitable one, certainly enjoyed the advantage of a practical view of\r\nthe situation: \"Whence the many wretchedly poor people in such a colony\r\nof workers, where poverty, from a misfortune, has become a reproach,\r\ndreaded as the plague?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immigration,\" he said, \"brings us a lot. In five years it has averaged\r\ntwenty-five thousand a year, of which more than seventy per cent. have\r\nstayed in New York. Half of them require and receive aid from the\r\nHebrew Charities from the very start, lest they starve. That is one\r\nexplanation. There is another class than the one that cannot get work:\r\nthose who have had too much of it; who have worked and hoarded and\r\nlived, crowded together like pigs, on the scantiest fare and the worst\r\nto be got, bound to save whatever their earnings, until, worn out, they\r\ncould work no longer. Then their hoards were soon exhausted. That is\r\ntheir story.\" And I knew that what he said was true.\r\n\r\nPenury and poverty are wedded everywhere to dirt and disease, and\r\nJewtown is no exception. It could not well be otherwise in such crowds,\r\nconsidering especially their low intellectual status. The managers of\r\nthe Eastern Dispensary, which is in the very heart of their district,\r\ntold the whole story when they said: \"The diseases these people suffer\r\nfrom are not due to intemperance or immorality, but to ignorance, want\r\nof suitable food, and the foul air in which they live and work.\"[12]\r\nThe homes of the Hebrew quarter are its workshops also. Reference\r\nwill be made to the economic conditions under which they work in a\r\nsucceeding chapter. Here we are concerned simply with the fact. You\r\nare made fully aware of it before you have travelled the length of\r\na single block in any of these East Side streets, by the whir of a\r\nthousand sewing-machines, worked at high pressure from earliest dawn\r\ntill mind and muscle give out together. Every member of the family,\r\nfrom the youngest to the oldest, bears a hand, shut in the qualmy\r\nrooms, where meals are cooked and clothing washed and dried besides,\r\nthe live-long day. It is not unusual to find a dozen persons--men,\r\nwomen, and children--at work in a single small room. The fact accounts\r\nfor the contrast that strikes with wonder the observer who comes across\r\nfrom the Bend. Over there the entire population seems possessed of\r\nan uncontrollable impulse to get out into the street; here all its\r\nenergies appear to be bent upon keeping in and away from it. Not that\r\nthe streets are deserted. The overflow from these tenements is enough\r\nto make a crowd anywhere. The children alone would do it. Not old\r\nenough to work and no room for play, that is their story. In the home\r\nthe child's place is usurped by the lodger, who performs the service\r\nof the Irishman's pig--pays the rent. In the street the army of\r\nhucksters crowd him out. Typhus fever and small-pox are bred here, and\r\nhelp solve the question what to do with him. Filth diseases both, they\r\nsprout naturally among the hordes that bring the germs with them from\r\nacross the sea, and whose first instinct is to hide their sick lest the\r\nauthorities carry them off to the hospital to be slaughtered, as they\r\nfirmly believe. The health officers are on constant and sharp lookout\r\nfor hidden fever-nests. Considering that half of the ready-made clothes\r\nthat are sold in the big stores, if not a good deal more than half, are\r\nmade in these tenement rooms, this is not excessive caution. It has\r\nhappened more than once that a child recovering from small-pox, and in\r\nthe most contagious stage of the disease, has been found crawling among\r\nheaps of half-finished clothing that the next day would be offered for\r\nsale on the counter of a Broadway store; or that a typhus fever patient\r\nhas been discovered in a room whence perhaps a hundred coats had been\r\nsent home that week, each one with the wearer's death-warrant, unseen\r\nand unsuspected, basted in the lining.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Report of Eastern Dispensary for 1889.]\r\n\r\nThe health officers call the Tenth the typhus ward; in the office where\r\ndeaths are registered it passes as the \"suicide ward,\" for reasons\r\nnot hard to understand; and among the police as the \"crooked ward,\"\r\non account of the number of \"crooks,\" petty thieves and their allies,\r\nthe \"fences,\" receivers of stolen goods, who find the dense crowds\r\ncongenial. The nearness of the Bowery, the great \"thieves' highway,\"\r\nhelps to keep up the supply of these, but Jewtown does not support\r\nits dives. Its troubles with the police are the characteristic crop\r\nof its intense business rivalries. Oppression, persecution, have not\r\nshorn the Jew of his native combativeness one whit. He is as ready\r\nto fight for his rights, or what he considers his rights, in a\r\nbusiness transaction--synonymous generally with his advantage--as if\r\nhe had not been robbed of them for eighteen hundred years. One strong\r\nimpression survives with him from his days of bondage: the power of\r\nthe law. On the slightest provocation he rushes off to invoke it for\r\nhis protection. Doubtless the sensation is novel to him, and therefore\r\npleasing. The police at the Eldridge Street station are in a constant\r\nturmoil over these everlasting fights. Somebody is always denouncing\r\nsomebody else, and getting his enemy or himself locked up; frequently\r\nboth, for the prisoner, when brought in, has generally as plausible\r\na story to tell as his accuser, and as hot a charge to make. The day\r\ncloses on a wild conflict of rival interests. Another dawns with the\r\nprisoner in court, but no complainant. Over night the case has been\r\nsettled on a business basis, and the police dismiss their prisoner in\r\ndeep disgust.\r\n\r\nThese quarrels have sometimes a comic aspect. Thus, with the numerous\r\ndancing-schools that are scattered among the synagogues, often keeping\r\nthem company in the same tenement. They are generally kept by some\r\nman who works in the daytime at tailoring, cigarmaking, or something\r\nelse. The young people in Jewtown are inordinately fond of dancing,\r\nand after their day's hard work will flock to these \"schools\" for a\r\nnight's recreation. But even to their fun they carry their business\r\npreferences, and it happens that a school adjourns in a body to make\r\na general raid on the rival establishment across the street, without\r\nthe ceremony of paying the admission fee. Then the dance breaks up in\r\na general fight, in which, likely enough, someone is badly hurt. The\r\npolice come in, as usual, and ring down the curtain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MARKET SCENE IN THE JEWISH QUARTER.]\r\n\r\nBitter as are his private feuds, it is not until his religious life\r\nis invaded that a real inside view is obtained of this Jew, whom the\r\nhistory of Christian civilization has taught nothing but fear and\r\nhatred. There are two or three missions in the district conducting a\r\nhopeless propagandism for the Messiah whom the Tenth Ward rejects,\r\nand they attract occasional crowds, who come to hear the Christian\r\npreacher as the Jews of old gathered to hear the apostles expound the\r\nnew doctrine. The result is often strikingly similar. \"For once,\" said\r\na certain well-known minister of an uptown church to me, after such an\r\nexperience, \"I felt justified in comparing myself to Paul preaching\r\nsalvation to the Jews. They kept still until I spoke of Jesus Christ as\r\nthe Son of God. Then they got up and fell to arguing among themselves\r\nand to threatening me, until it looked as if they meant to take me out\r\nin Hester Street and stone me.\" As at Jerusalem, the Chief Captain\r\nwas happily at hand with his centurions, in the person of a sergeant\r\nand three policemen, and the preacher was rescued. So, in all matters\r\npertaining to their religious life that tinges all their customs, they\r\nstand, these East Side Jews, where the new day that dawned on Calvary\r\nleft them standing, stubbornly refusing to see the light. A visit to\r\na Jewish house of mourning is like bridging the gap of two thousand\r\nyears. The inexpressibly sad and sorrowful wail for the dead, as it\r\nswells and rises in the hush of all sounds of life, comes back from\r\nthe ages like a mournful echo of the voice of Rachel \"weeping for her\r\nchildren and refusing to be comforted, because they are not.\"\r\n\r\nAttached to many of the synagogues, which among the poorest Jews\r\nfrequently consist of a scantily furnished room in a rear tenement,\r\nwith a few wooden stools or benches for the congregation, are Talmudic\r\nschools that absorb a share of the growing youth. The school-master\r\nis not rarely a man of some attainments who has been stranded there,\r\nhis native instinct for money-making having been smothered in the\r\nprocess that has made of him a learned man. It was of such a school\r\nin Eldridge Street that the wicked Isaac Iacob, who killed his enemy,\r\nhis wife, and himself in one day, was janitor. But the majority of the\r\nchildren seek the public schools, where they are received sometimes\r\nwith some misgivings on the part of the teachers, who find it necessary\r\nto inculcate lessons of cleanliness in the worst cases by practical\r\ndemonstration with wash-bowl and soap. \"He took hold of the soap as\r\nif it were some animal,\" said one of these teachers to me after such\r\nan experiment upon a new pupil, \"and wiped three fingers across his\r\nface. He called that washing.\" In the Allen Street public school the\r\nexperienced principal has embodied among the elementary lessons, to\r\nkeep constantly before the children the duty that clearly lies next to\r\ntheir hands, a characteristic exercise. The question is asked daily\r\nfrom the teacher's desk: \"What must I do to be healthy?\" and the whole\r\nschool responds:\r\n\r\n            \"I must keep my skin clean,\r\n            Wear clean clothes,\r\n            Breathe pure air,\r\n            And live in the sunlight.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems little less than biting sarcasm to hear them say it, for to\r\nnot a few of them all these things are known only by name. In their\r\neveryday life there is nothing even to suggest any of them. Only the\r\ndemand of religious custom has power to make their parents clean up at\r\nstated intervals, and the young naturally are no better. As scholars,\r\nthe children of the most ignorant Polish Jew keep fairly abreast of\r\ntheir more favored playmates, until it comes to mental arithmetic, when\r\nthey leave them behind with a bound. It is surprising to see how strong\r\nthe instinct of dollars and cents is in them. They can count, and\r\ncorrectly, almost before they can talk.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years the police captured on the East Side a band of\r\nfirebugs who made a business of setting fire to tenements for the\r\ninsurance on their furniture. There has, unfortunately, been some\r\nevidence in the past year that another such conspiracy is on foot. The\r\ndanger to which these fiends expose their fellow-tenants is appalling.\r\nA fire-panic at night in a tenement, by no means among the rare\r\nexperiences in New York, with the surging, half-smothered crowds on\r\nstairs and fire-escapes, the frantic mothers and crying children, the\r\nwild struggle to save the little that is their all, is a horror that\r\nhas few parallels in human experience.\r\n\r\nI cannot think without a shudder of one such scene in a First Avenue\r\ntenement. It was in the middle of the night. The fire had swept up\r\nwith sudden fury from a restaurant on the street floor, cutting off\r\nescape. Men and women threw themselves from the windows, or were\r\ncarried down senseless by the firemen. Thirteen half-clad, apparently\r\nlifeless bodies were laid on the floor of an adjoining coal-office,\r\nand the ambulance surgeons worked over them with sleeves rolled up to\r\nthe elbows. A half-grown girl with a baby in her arms walked about\r\namong the dead and dying with a stunned, vacant look, singing in a low,\r\nscared voice to the child. One of the doctors took her arm to lead her\r\nout, and patted the cheek of the baby soothingly. It was cold. The\r\nbaby had been smothered with its father and mother; but the girl, her\r\nsister, did not know it. Her reason had fled.\r\n\r\nThursday night and Friday morning are bargain days in the \"Pig-market.\"\r\nThen is the time to study the ways of this peculiar people to the best\r\nadvantage. A common pulse beats in the quarters of the Polish Jews\r\nand in the Mulberry Bend, though they have little else in common.\r\nLife over yonder in fine weather is a perpetual holiday, here a\r\nveritable tread-mill of industry. Friday brings out all the latent\r\ncolor and picturesqueness of the Italians, as of these Semites. The\r\ncrowds and the common poverty are the bonds of sympathy between them.\r\nThe Pig-market is in Hester Street, extending either way from Ludlow\r\nStreet, and up and down the side streets two or three blocks, as the\r\nstate of trade demands. The name was given to it probably in derision,\r\nfor pork is the one ware that is not on sale in the Pig-market. There\r\nis scarcely anything else that can be hawked from a wagon that is not\r\nto be found, and at ridiculously low prices. Bandannas and tin cups\r\nat two cents, peaches at a cent a quart, \"damaged\" eggs for a song,\r\nhats for a quarter, and spectacles, warranted to suit the eye, at the\r\noptician's who has opened shop on a Hester Street door-step, for thirty\r\nfive cents; frowsy-looking chickens and half-plucked geese, hung by the\r\nneck and protesting with wildly strutting feet even in death against\r\nthe outrage, are the great staple of the market. Half or a quarter of a\r\nchicken can be bought here by those who cannot afford a whole. It took\r\nmore than ten years of persistent effort on the part of the sanitary\r\nauthorities to drive the trade in live fowl from the streets to the\r\nfowl-market on Gouverneur Slip, where the killing is now done according\r\nto Jewish rite by priests detailed for the purpose by the chief rabbi.\r\nSince then they have had a characteristic rumpus, that involved the\r\nentire Jewish community, over the fees for killing and the mode of\r\ncollecting them. Here is a woman churning horse-radish on a machine she\r\nhas chained and padlocked to a tree on the sidewalk, lest someone steal\r\nit. Beside her a butcher's stand with cuts at prices the avenues never\r\ndreamed of. Old coats are hawked for fifty cents, \"as good as new,\"\r\nand \"pants\"--there are no trousers in Jewtown, only pants--at anything\r\nthat can be got. There is a knot of half a dozen \"pants\" pedlars in the\r\nmiddle of the street, twice as many men of their own race fingering\r\ntheir wares and plucking at the seams with the anxious scrutiny of\r\nwould-be buyers, though none of them has the least idea of investing\r\nin a pair. Yes, stop! This baker, fresh from his trough, bare-headed\r\nand with bare arms, has made an offer: for this pair thirty cents; a\r\ndollar and forty was the price asked. The pedlar shrugs his shoulders,\r\nand turns up his hands with a half pitying, wholly indignant air. What\r\ndoes the baker take him for? Such pants--. The baker has turned to go.\r\nWith a jump like a panther's, the man with the pants has him by the\r\nsleeve. Will he give eighty cents? Sixty? Fifty? So help him, they are\r\ndirt cheap at that. Lose, will he, on the trade, lose all the profit\r\nof his day's pedling. The baker goes on unmoved. Forty then? What, not\r\nforty? Take them then for thirty, and wreck the life of a poor man. And\r\nthe baker takes them and goes, well knowing that at least twenty cents\r\nof the thirty, two hundred per cent., were clear profit, if indeed the\r\n\"pants\" cost the pedlar anything.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OLD CLO'E'S MAN--IN THE JEWISH QUARTERS.]\r\n\r\nThe suspender pedlar is the mystery of the Pig-market, omnipresent and\r\nunfathomable. He is met at every step with his wares dangling over his\r\nshoulder, down his back, and in front. Millions of suspenders thus\r\nperambulate Jewtown all day on a sort of dress parade. Why suspenders,\r\nis the puzzle, and where do they all go to? The \"pants\" of Jewtown\r\nhang down with a common accord, as if they had never known the support\r\nof suspenders. It appears to be as characteristic a trait of the race\r\nas the long beard and the Sabbath silk hat of ancient pedigree. I\r\nhave asked again and again. No one has ever been able to tell me what\r\nbecomes of the suspenders of Jewtown. Perhaps they are hung up as\r\nbric-à-brac in its homes, or laid away and saved up as the equivalent\r\nof cash. I cannot tell. I only know that more suspenders are hawked\r\nabout the Pig-market every day than would supply the whole of New York\r\nfor a year, were they all bought and turned to use.\r\n\r\nThe crowds that jostle each other at the wagons and about the sidewalk\r\nshops, where a gutter plank on two ash-barrels does duty for a counter!\r\nPushing, struggling, babbling, and shouting in foreign tongues, a\r\nveritable Babel of confusion. An English word falls upon the ear\r\nalmost with a sense of shock, as something unexpected and strange.\r\nIn the midst of it all there is a sudden wild scattering, a hustling\r\nof things from the street into dark cellars, into back-yards and\r\nby-ways, a slamming and locking of doors hidden under the improvised\r\nshelves and counters. The health officers' cart is coming down the\r\nstreet, preceded and followed by stalwart policemen, who shovel up\r\nwith scant ceremony the eatables--musty bread, decayed fish and stale\r\nvegetables--indifferent to the curses that are showered on them from\r\nstoops and windows, and carry them off to the dump. In the wake of the\r\nwagon, as it makes its way to the East River after the raid, follow a\r\nline of despoiled hucksters shouting defiance from a safe distance.\r\nTheir clamor dies away with the noise of the market. The endless\r\npanorama of the tenements, rows upon rows, between stony streets,\r\nstretches to the north, to the south, and to the west as far as the eye\r\nreaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                        THE SWEATERS OF JEWTOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything like an exhaustive discussion of the economical problem\r\npresented by the Tenth Ward[13] is beset by difficulties that increase\r\nin precise proportion to the efforts put forth to remove them. I have\r\ntoo vivid a recollection of weary days and nights spent in those\r\nstewing tenements, trying to get to the bottom of the vexatious\r\nquestion only to find myself in the end as far from the truth as at\r\nthe beginning, asking with rising wrath Pilate's question, \"What is\r\ntruth?\" to attempt to weary the reader by dragging him with me over\r\nthat sterile and unprofitable ground. Nor are these pages the place for\r\nsuch a discussion. In it, let me confess it at once and have done with\r\nit, I should be like the blind leading the blind; between the real and\r\napparent poverty, the hidden hoards and the unhesitating mendacity of\r\nthese people, where they conceive their interests to be concerned in\r\none way or another, the reader and I would fall together into the ditch\r\nof doubt and conjecture in which I have found company before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: I refer to the Tenth Ward always as typical. The district\r\nembraced in the discussion really includes the Thirteenth Ward, and in\r\na growing sense large portions of the Seventh and contiguous wards as\r\nwell.]\r\n\r\nThe facts that lie on the surface indicate the causes as clearly as\r\nthe nature of the trouble. In effect both have been already stated. A\r\nfriend of mine who manufactures cloth once boasted to me that nowadays,\r\non cheap clothing, New York \"beats the world.\" \"To what,\" I asked, \"do\r\nyou attribute it?\" \"To the cutter's long knife[14] and the Polish Jew,\"\r\nhe said. Which of the two has cut deepest into the workman's wages\r\nis not a doubtful question. Practically the Jew has monopolized the\r\nbusiness since the battle between East Broadway and Broadway ended in a\r\ncomplete victory for the East Side and cheap labor, and transferred to\r\nit the control of the trade in cheap clothing. Yet, not satisfied with\r\nhaving won the field, he strives as hotly with his own for the profit\r\nof half a cent as he fought with his Christian competitor for the\r\ndollar. If the victory is a barren one, the blame is his own. His price\r\nis not what he can get, but the lowest he can live for and underbid his\r\nneighbor. Just what that means we shall see. The manufacturer knows it,\r\nand is not slow to take advantage of his knowledge. He makes him hungry\r\nfor work by keeping it from him as long as possible; then drives the\r\nclosest bargain he can with the sweater.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: An invention that cuts many garments at once, where the\r\nscissors could cut only a few.]\r\n\r\nMany harsh things have been said of the \"sweater,\" that really apply to\r\nthe system in which he is a necessary, logical link. It can at least be\r\nsaid of him that he is no worse than the conditions that created him.\r\nThe sweater is simply the middleman, the sub-contractor, a workman like\r\nhis fellows, perhaps with the single distinction from the rest that he\r\nknows a little English; perhaps not even that, but with the accidental\r\npossession of two or three sewing-machines, or of credit enough to hire\r\nthem, as his capital, who drums up work among the clothing-houses.\r\nOf workmen he can always get enough. Every ship-load from German\r\nports brings them to his door in droves, clamoring for work. The sun\r\nsets upon the day of the arrival of many a Polish Jew, finding him\r\nat work in an East Side tenement, treading the machine and \"learning\r\nthe trade.\" Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on\r\none job. They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade,\r\ndriving their \"hands\" as they drive their machine, for all they are\r\nworth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most\r\ncases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often\r\nsupposed. If it resolves itself into a margin of five or six cents,\r\nor even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is\r\nnevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instincts\r\nindependent. The workman growls, not at the hard labor, or poor pay,\r\nbut over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the\r\nfirst opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by\r\ndriving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, thus reducing his\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nThe sweater knows well that the isolation of the workman in his\r\nhelpless ignorance is his sure foundation, and he has done what he\r\ncould--with merciless severity where he could--to smother every symptom\r\nof awakening intelligence in his slaves. In this effort to perpetuate\r\nhis despotism he has had the effectual assistance of his own system and\r\nthe sharp competition that keep the men on starvation wages; of their\r\nconstitutional greed, that will not permit the sacrifice of temporary\r\nadvantage, however slight, for permanent good, and above all, of the\r\nhungry hordes of immigrants to whom no argument appeals save the cry\r\nfor bread. Within very recent times he has, however, been forced to\r\npartial surrender by the organization of the men to a considerable\r\nextent into trades unions, and by experiments in co-operation, under\r\nintelligent leadership, that presage the sweater's doom. But as long as\r\nthe ignorant crowds continue to come and to herd in these tenements,\r\nhis grip can never be shaken off. And the supply across the seas is\r\napparently inexhaustible. Every fresh persecution of the Russian or\r\nPolish Jew on his native soil starts greater hordes hitherward to\r\nconfound economical problems, and recruit the sweater's phalanx. The\r\ncurse of bigotry and ignorance reaches halfway across the world, to sow\r\nits bitter seed in fertile soil in the East Side tenements. If the Jew\r\nhimself was to blame for the resentment he aroused over there, he is\r\namply punished. He gathers the first-fruits of the harvest here.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the sweater's work is done in the tenements, which the\r\nlaw that regulates factory labor does not reach. To the factories\r\nthemselves that are taking the place of the rear tenements in rapidly\r\ngrowing numbers, letting in bigger day-crowds than those the health\r\nofficers banished, the tenement shops serve as a supplement through\r\nwhich the law is successfully evaded. Ten hours is the legal work-day\r\nin the factories, and nine o'clock the closing hour at the latest.\r\nForty-five minutes at least must be allowed for dinner, and children\r\nunder sixteen must not be employed unless they can read and write\r\nEnglish; none at all under fourteen. The very fact that such a law\r\nshould stand on the statute book, shows how desperate the plight of\r\nthese people. But the tenement has defeated its benevolent purpose. In\r\nit the child works unchallenged from the day he is old enough to pull\r\na thread. There is no such thing as a dinner hour; men and women eat\r\nwhile they work, and the \"day\" is lengthened at both ends far into\r\nthe night. Factory hands take their work with them at the close of the\r\nlawful day to eke out their scanty earnings by working overtime at\r\nhome. Little chance on this ground for the campaign of education that\r\nalone can bring the needed relief; small wonder that there are whole\r\nsettlements on this East Side where English is practically an unknown\r\ntongue, though the people be both willing and anxious to learn. \"When\r\nshall we find time to learn?\" asked one of them of me once. I owe him\r\nthe answer yet.\r\n\r\nTake the Second Avenue Elevated Railroad at Chatham Square and ride up\r\nhalf a mile through the sweaters' district. Every open window of the\r\nbig tenements, that stand like a continuous brick wall on both sides of\r\nthe way, gives you a glimpse of one of these shops as the train speeds\r\nby. Men and women bending over their machines, or ironing clothes at\r\nthe window, half-naked. Proprieties do not count on the East Side;\r\nnothing counts that cannot be converted into hard cash. The road is\r\nlike a big gangway through an endless work-room where vast multitudes\r\nare forever laboring. Morning, noon, or night, it makes no difference;\r\nthe scene is always the same. At Rivington Street let us get off and\r\ncontinue our trip on foot. It is Sunday evening west of the Bowery.\r\nHere, under the rule of Mosaic law, the week of work is under full\r\nheadway, its first day far spent. The hucksters' wagons are absent or\r\nstand idle at the curb; the saloons admit the thirsty crowds through\r\nthe side-door labelled \"Family Entrance;\" a tin sign in a store-window\r\nannounces that a \"Sunday School\" gathers in stray children of the new\r\ndispensation; but beyond these things there is little to suggest the\r\nChristian Sabbath. Men stagger along the sidewalk groaning under heavy\r\nburdens of unsewn garments, or enormous black bags stuffed full of\r\nfinished coats and trousers. Let us follow one to his home and see how\r\nSunday passes in a Ludlow Street tenement.\r\n\r\nUp two flights of dark stairs, three, four, with new smells of cabbage,\r\nof onions, of frying fish, on every landing, whirring sewing machines\r\nbehind closed doors betraying what goes on within, to the door that\r\nopens to admit the bundle and the man. A sweater, this, in a small way.\r\nFive men and a woman, two young girls, not fifteen, and a boy who says\r\nunasked that he is fifteen, and lies in saying it, are at the machines\r\nsewing knickerbockers, \"knee-pants\" in the Ludlow Street dialect. The\r\nfloor is littered ankle-deep with half-sewn garments. In the alcove, on\r\na couch of many dozens of \"pants\" ready for the finisher, a bare-legged\r\nbaby with pinched face is asleep. A fence of piled-up clothing keeps\r\nhim from rolling off on the floor. The faces, hands, and arms to the\r\nelbows of everyone in the room are black with the color of the cloth\r\non which they are working. The boy and the woman alone look up at our\r\nentrance. The girls shoot sidelong glances, but at a warning look from\r\nthe man with the bundle they tread their machines more energetically\r\nthan ever. The men do not appear to be aware even of the presence of a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThey are \"learners,\" all of them, says the woman, who proves to be the\r\nwife of the boss, and have \"come over\" only a few weeks ago. She is\r\ndisinclined to talk at first, but a few words in her own tongue from\r\nour guide[15] set her fears, whatever they are, at rest, and she grows\r\nalmost talkative. The learners work for week's wages, she says. How\r\nmuch do they earn? She shrugs her shoulders with an expressive gesture.\r\nThe workers themselves, asked in their own tongue, say indifferently,\r\nas though the question were of no interest: from two to five dollars.\r\nThe children--there are four of them--are not old enough to work.\r\nThe oldest is only six. They turn out one hundred and twenty dozen\r\n\"knee-pants\" a week, for which the manufacturer pays seventy cents a\r\ndozen. Five cents a dozen is the clear profit, but her own and her\r\nhusband's work brings the family earnings up to twenty-five dollars a\r\nweek, when they have work all the time. But often half the time is put\r\nin looking for it. They work no longer than to nine o'clock at night,\r\nfrom daybreak. There are ten machines in the room; six are hired at\r\ntwo dollars a month. For the two shabby, smoke-begrimed rooms, one\r\nsomewhat larger than ordinary, they pay twenty dollars a month. She\r\ndoes not complain, though \"times are not what they were, and it costs a\r\ngood deal to live.\" Eight dollars a week for the family of six and two\r\nboarders. How do they do it? She laughs, as she goes over the bill of\r\nfare, at the silly question: Bread, fifteen cents a day, of milk two\r\nquarts a day at four cents a quart, one pound of meat for dinner at\r\ntwelve cents, butter one pound a week at \"eight cents a quarter of a\r\npound.\" Coffee, potatoes, and pickles complete the list. At the least\r\ncalculation, probably, this sweater's family hoards up thirty dollars\r\na month, and in a few years will own a tenement somewhere and profit\r\nby the example set by their landlord in rent-collecting. It is the way\r\nthe savings of Jewtown are universally invested, and with the natural\r\ntalent of its people for commercial speculation the investment is\r\nenormously profitable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: I was always accompanied on these tours of inquiry by\r\none of their own people who knew of and sympathized with my mission.\r\nWithout that precaution my errand would have been fruitless; even with\r\nhim it was often nearly so.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"KNEE-PANTS\" AT FORTY-FIVE CENTS A DOZEN--A LUDLOW\r\n                 STREET SWEATER'S SHOP.]\r\n\r\nOn the next floor, in a dimly lighted room with a big red-hot stove\r\nto keep the pressing irons ready for use, is a family of man, wife,\r\nthree children, and a boarder. \"Knee-pants\" are made there too, of a\r\nstill lower grade. Three cents and a half is all he clears, says the\r\nman, and lies probably out of at least two cents. The wife makes a\r\ndollar and a half finishing, the man about nine dollars at the machine.\r\nThe boarder pays sixty-five cents a week. He is really only a lodger,\r\ngetting his meals outside. The rent is two dollars and twenty-five\r\ncents a week, cost of living five dollars. Every floor has at least\r\ntwo, sometimes four, such shops. Here is one with a young family for\r\nwhich life is bright with promise. Husband and wife work together;\r\njust now the latter, a comely young woman, is eating her dinner of dry\r\nbread and green pickles. Pickles are favorite food in Jewtown. They are\r\nfilling, and keep the children from crying with hunger. Those who have\r\nstomachs like ostriches thrive in spite of them and grow strong--plain\r\nproof that they are good to eat. The rest? \"Well, they die,\" says our\r\nguide, dryly. No thought of untimely death comes to disturb this family\r\nwith life all before it. In a few years the man will be a prosperous\r\nsweater. Already he employs an old man as ironer at three dollars a\r\nweek, and a sweet-faced little Italian girl as finisher at a dollar and\r\na half. She is twelve, she says, and can neither read nor write; will\r\nprobably never learn. How should she? The family clears from ten to\r\neleven dollars a week in brisk times, more than half of which goes into\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nA companion picture from across the hall. The man works on the\r\nmachine for his sweater twelve hours a day, turning out three dozen\r\n\"knee-pants,\" for which he receives forty-two cents a dozen. The\r\nfinisher who works with him gets ten, and the ironer eight cents a\r\ndozen; buttonholes are extra, at eight to ten cents a hundred. This\r\noperator has four children at his home in Stanton Street, none old\r\nenough to work, and a sick wife. His rent is twelve dollars a month;\r\nhis wages for a hard week's work less than eight dollars. Such as he,\r\nwith their consuming desire for money thus smothered, recruit the ranks\r\nof the anarchists, won over by the promise of a general \"divide;\"\r\nand an enlightened public sentiment turns up its nose at the vicious\r\nforeigner for whose perverted notions there is no room in this land of\r\nplenty.\r\n\r\nTurning the corner into Hester Street, we stumble upon a nest of\r\ncloak-makers in their busy season. Six months of the year the\r\ncloak-maker is idle, or nearly so. Now is his harvest. Seventy-five\r\ncents a cloak, all complete, is the price in this shop. The cloak is\r\nof cheap plush, and might sell for eight or nine dollars over the\r\nstore-counter. Seven dollars is the weekly wage of this man with wife\r\nand two children, and nine dollars and a half rent to pay per month.\r\nA boarder pays about a third of it. There was a time when he made ten\r\ndollars a week and thought himself rich. But wages have come down\r\nfearfully in the last two years. Think of it: \"come down\" to this. The\r\nother cloak-makers aver that they can make as much as twelve dollars a\r\nweek, when they are employed, by taking their work home and sewing till\r\nmidnight. One exhibits his account-book with a Ludlow Street sweater.\r\nIt shows that he and his partner, working on first-class garments\r\nfor a Broadway house in the four busiest weeks of the season, made\r\ntogether from $15.15 to $19.20 a week by striving from 6 A.M.\r\nto 11 P.M., that is to say, from $7.58 to $9.60 each.[16]\r\nThe sweater on this work probably made as much as fifty per cent. at\r\nleast on their labor. Not far away is a factory in a rear yard where\r\nthe factory inspector reports teams of tailors making men's coats at an\r\naverage of twenty-seven cents a coat, all complete except buttons and\r\nbutton-holes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The strike of the cloakmakers last summer, that ended in\r\nvictory, raised their wages considerably, at least for the time being.]\r\n\r\nTurning back, we pass a towering double tenement in Ludlow Street,\r\nowned by a well-known Jewish liquor dealer and politician, a triple\r\ncombination that bodes ill for his tenants. As a matter of fact, the\r\ncheapest \"apartment,\" three rear rooms on the sixth floor, only one of\r\nwhich deserves the name, is rented for $13 a month. Here is a reminder\r\nof the Bend, a hallway turned into a shoemaker's shop. Two hallways\r\nside by side in adjoining tenements, would be sinful waste in Jewtown,\r\nwhen one would do as well by knocking a hole in the wall. But this\r\nshoemaker knows a trick the Italian's ingenuity did not suggest. He has\r\nhis \"flat\" as well as his shop there. A curtain hung back of his stool\r\nin the narrow passage half conceals his bed that fills it entirely from\r\nwall to wall. To get into it he has to crawl over the foot-board, and\r\nhe must come out the same way. Expedients more odd than this are born\r\nof the East Side crowding. In one of the houses we left, the coal-bin\r\nof a family on the fourth floor was on the roof of the adjoining\r\ntenement. A quarter of a ton of coal was being dumped there while we\r\ntalked with the people.\r\n\r\nWe have reached Broome Street. The hum of industry in this six-story\r\ntenement on the corner leaves no doubt of the aspect Sunday wears\r\nwithin it. One flight up, we knock at the nearest door. The grocer,\r\nwho keeps the store, lives on the \"stoop,\" the first floor in East\r\nSide parlance. In this room a suspender-maker sleeps and works with his\r\nfamily of wife and four children. For a wonder there are no boarders.\r\nHis wife and eighteen years old daughter share in the work, but the\r\ngirl's eyes are giving out from the strain. Three months in the year,\r\nwhen work is very brisk, the family makes by united efforts as high as\r\nfourteen and fifteen dollars a week. The other nine months it averages\r\nfrom three to four dollars. The oldest boy, a young man, earns from\r\nfour to six dollars in an Orchard Street factory, when he has work.\r\nThe rent is ten dollars a month for the room and a miserable little\r\ncoop of a bedroom where the old folks sleep. The girl makes her bed\r\non the lounge in the front room; the big boys and the children sleep\r\non the floor. Coal at ten cents a small pail, meat at twelve cents a\r\npound, one and a half pound of butter a week at thirty-six cents, and a\r\nquarter of a pound of tea in the same space of time, are items of their\r\nhouse-keeping account as given by the daughter. Milk at four and five\r\ncents a quart, \"according to quality.\" The sanitary authorities know\r\nwhat that means, know how miserably inadequate is the fine of fifty or\r\na hundred dollars for the murder done in cold blood by the wretches\r\nwho poison the babes of these tenements with the stuff that is half\r\nwater, or swill. Their defence is that the demand is for \"cheap milk.\"\r\nScarcely a wonder that this suspender-maker will hardly be able to save\r\nup the _dot_ for his daughter, without which she stands no chance of\r\nmarrying in Jewtown, even with her face that would be pretty had it a\r\nhealthier tinge.\r\n\r\nUp under the roof three men are making boys' jackets at twenty cents a\r\npiece, of which the sewer takes eight, the ironer three, the finisher\r\nfive cents, and the button-hole-maker two and a quarter, leaving a\r\ncent and three-quarters to pay for the drumming up, the fetching and\r\nbringing back of the goods. They bunk together in a room for which\r\nthey pay eight dollars a month. All three are single here, that is:\r\ntheir wives are on the other side yet, waiting for them to earn\r\nenough to send for them. Their breakfast, eaten at the work-bench,\r\nconsists of a couple of rolls at a cent a piece, and a draught of\r\nwater, milk when business has been very good, a square meal at noon in\r\na restaurant, and the morning meal over again at night. This square\r\nmeal, that is the evidence of a very liberal disposition on the part\r\nof the consumer, is an affair of more than ordinary note; it may be\r\njustly called an institution. I know of a couple of restaurants at\r\nthe lower end of Orchard Street that are favorite resorts for the\r\nPolish Jews, who remember the injunction that the ox that treadeth\r\nout the corn shall not be muzzled. Being neighbors, they are rivals\r\nof course, and cutting under. When I was last there one gave a dinner\r\nof soup, meat-stew, bread, pie, pickles, and a \"schooner\" of beer for\r\nthirteen cents; the other charged fifteen cents for a similar dinner,\r\nbut with two schooners of beer and a cigar, or a cigarette, as the\r\nextra inducement. The two cents had won the day, however, and the\r\nthirteen-cent restaurant did such a thriving business that it was about\r\nto spread out into the adjoining store to accommodate the crowds of\r\ncustomers. At this rate the lodger of Jewtown can \"live like a lord,\"\r\nas he says himself, for twenty-five cents a day, including the price of\r\nhis bed, that ranges all the way from thirty to forty and fifty cents a\r\nweek, and save money, no matter what his earnings. He does it, too, so\r\nlong as work is to be had at any price, and by the standard he sets up\r\nJewtown must abide.\r\n\r\nIt has thousands upon thousands of lodgers who help to pay its\r\nextortionate rents. At night there is scarce a room in all the district\r\nthat has not one or more of them, some above half a score, sleeping on\r\ncots, or on the floor. It is idle to speak of privacy in these \"homes.\"\r\nThe term carries no more meaning with it than would a lecture on social\r\nethics to an audience of Hottentots. The picture is not overdrawn. In\r\nfact, in presenting the home life of these people I have been at some\r\npains to avoid the extreme of privation, taking the cases just as they\r\ncame to hand on the safer middle-ground of average earnings. Yet even\r\nthe direst apparent poverty in Jewtown, unless dependent on absolute\r\nlack of work, would, were the truth known, in nine cases out of ten\r\nhave a silver lining in the shape of a margin in bank.\r\n\r\nThese are the economical conditions that enable my manufacturing friend\r\nto boast that New York can \"beat the world\" on cheap clothing. In\r\nsupport of his claim he told me that a single Bowery firm last year\r\nsold fifteen thousand suits at $1.95 that averaged in cost $1.12½.\r\nWith the material at fifteen cents a yard, he said, children's suits\r\nof assorted sizes can be sold at wholesale for seventy-five cents, and\r\nboys' cape overcoats at the same price. They are the same conditions\r\nthat have perplexed the committee of benevolent Hebrews in charge of\r\nBaron de Hirsch's munificent gift of ten thousand dollars a month for\r\nthe relief of the Jewish poor in New York. To find proper channels\r\nthrough which to pour this money so that it shall effect its purpose\r\nwithout pauperizing, and without perpetuating the problem it is sought\r\nto solve, by attracting still greater swarms, is indeed no easy task.\r\nColonization has not in the past been a success with these people.\r\nThe great mass of them are too gregarious to take kindly to farming,\r\nand their strong commercial instinct hampers the experiment. To herd\r\nthem in model tenements, though it relieve the physical suffering in a\r\nmeasure, would be to treat a symptom of the disease rather than strike\r\nat its root, even if land could be got cheap enough where they gather\r\nto build on a sufficiently large scale to make the plan a success.\r\nTrade schools for manual training could hardly be made to reach the\r\nadults, who in addition would have to be supported for months while\r\nlearning. For the young this device has proved most excellent under the\r\nwise management of the United Hebrew Charities, an organization that\r\ngathers to its work the best thought and effort of many of our most\r\npublic-spirited citizens. One, or all, of these plans may be tried,\r\nprobably will. I state but the misgivings as to the result of some\r\nof the practical minds that have busied themselves with the problem.\r\nIts keynote evidently is the ignorance of the immigrants. They must\r\nbe taught the language of the country they have chosen as their home,\r\nas the first and most necessary step. Whatever may follow, that is\r\nessential, absolutely vital. That done, it may well be that the case in\r\nits new aspect will not be nearly so hard to deal with.\r\n\r\nEvening has worn into night as we take up our homeward journey through\r\nthe streets, now no longer silent. The thousands of lighted windows in\r\nthe tenements glow like dull red eyes in a huge stone wall. From every\r\ndoor multitudes of tired men and women pour forth for a half-hour's\r\nrest in the open air before sleep closes the eyes weary with incessant\r\nworking. Crowds of half-naked children tumble in the street and on the\r\nsidewalk, or doze fretfully on the stone steps. As we stop in front\r\nof a tenement to watch one of these groups, a dirty baby in a single\r\nbrief garment--yet a sweet, human little baby despite its dirt and\r\ntatters--tumbles off the lowest step, rolls over once, clutches my leg\r\nwith unconscious grip, and goes to sleep on the flagstones, its curly\r\nhead pillowed on my boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n               THE BOHEMIANS--TENEMENT-HOUSE CIGARMAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvil as the part is which the tenement plays in Jewtown as the pretext\r\nfor circumventing the law that was made to benefit and relieve the\r\ntenant, we have not far to go to find it in even a worse rôle. If\r\nthe tenement is here continually dragged into the eye of public\r\ncondemnation and scorn, it is because in one way or another it is found\r\ndirectly responsible for, or intimately associated with, three-fourths\r\nof the miseries of the poor. In the Bohemian quarter it is made the\r\nvehicle for enforcing upon a proud race a slavery as real as any that\r\never disgraced the South. Not content with simply robbing the tenant,\r\nthe owner, in the dual capacity of landlord and employer, reduces him\r\nto virtual serfdom by making his becoming _his_ tenant, on such terms\r\nas he sees fit to make, the condition of employment at wages likewise\r\nof his own making. It does not help the case that this landlord\r\nemployer, almost always a Jew, is frequently of the thrifty Polish race\r\njust described.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Bohemian quarter is hardly the proper name to give to the\r\ncolony, for though it has distinct boundaries it is scattered over a\r\nwide area on the East Side, in wedge-like streaks that relieve the\r\nmonotony of the solid German population by their strong contrasts.\r\nThe two races mingle no more on this side of the Atlantic than on the\r\nrugged slopes of the Bohemian mountains; the echoes of the thirty\r\nyears' war ring in New York, after two centuries and a half, with\r\nas fierce a hatred as the gigantic combat bred among the vanquished\r\nCzechs. A chief reason for this is doubtless the complete isolation of\r\nthe Bohemian immigrant. Several causes operate to bring this about: his\r\nsingularly harsh and unattractive language, which he can neither easily\r\nhimself unlearn nor impart to others, his stubborn pride of race, and\r\na popular prejudice which has forced upon him the unjust stigma of\r\na disturber of the public peace and an enemy of organized labor. I\r\ngreatly mistrust that the Bohemian on our shores is a much-abused man.\r\nTo his traducer, who casts up anarchism against him, he replies that\r\nthe last census (1880) shows his people to have the fewest criminals of\r\nall in proportion to numbers. In New York a Bohemian criminal is such a\r\nrarity that the case of two firebugs of several years ago is remembered\r\nwith damaging distinctness. The accusation that he lives like the \"rat\"\r\nhe is, cutting down wages by his underpaid labor, he throws back in the\r\nteeth of the trades unions with the counter-charge that they are the\r\nfirst cause of his attitude to the labor question.\r\n\r\nA little way above Houston Street the first of his colonies is\r\nencountered, in Fifth Street and thereabouts. Then for a mile and a\r\nhalf scarce a Bohemian is to be found, until Thirty-eighth Street is\r\nreached. Fifty-fourth and Seventy-third Streets in their turn are the\r\ncentres of populous Bohemian settlements. The location of the cigar\r\nfactories, upon which he depends for a living, determines his choice\r\nof home, though there is less choice about it than with any other\r\nclass in the community, save perhaps the colored people. Probably more\r\nthan half of all the Bohemians in this city are cigarmakers, and it\r\nis the herding of these in great numbers in the so-called tenement\r\nfactories, where the cheapest grade of work is done at the lowest\r\nwages, that constitutes at once their greatest hardship and the chief\r\ngrudge of other workmen against them. The manufacturer who owns, say,\r\nfrom three or four, to a dozen or more tenements contiguous to his\r\nshop, fills them up with these people, charging them outrageous rents,\r\nand demanding often even a preliminary deposit of five dollars \"key\r\nmoney;\" deals them out tobacco by the week, and devotes the rest of\r\nhis energies to the paring down of wages to within a peg or two of the\r\npoint where the tenant rebels in desperation. When he does rebel, he\r\nis given the alternative of submission, or eviction with entire loss\r\nof employment. His needs determine the issue. Usually he is not in a\r\nposition to hesitate long. Unlike the Polish Jew, whose example of\r\nuntiring industry he emulates, he has seldom much laid up against a\r\nrainy day. He is fond of a glass of beer, and likes to live as well as\r\nhis means will permit. The shop triumphs, and fetters more galling than\r\never are forged for the tenant. In the opposite case, the newspapers\r\nhave to record the throwing upon the street of a small army of people,\r\nwith pitiful cases of destitution and family misery.\r\n\r\nMen, women and children work together seven days in the week in these\r\ncheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of\r\nday till far into the night. Often the wife is the original cigarmaker\r\nfrom the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a\r\nmatter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could\r\nget no other work. As they state the cause of the bitter hostility\r\nof the trades unions, she was the primary bone of contention in the\r\nday of the early Bohemian immigration. The unions refused to admit\r\nthe women, and, as the support of the family depended upon her to\r\na large extent, such terms as were offered had to be accepted. The\r\nmanufacturer has ever since industriously fanned the antagonism between\r\nthe unions and his hands, for his own advantage. The victory rests with\r\nhim, since the Court of Appeals decided that the law, passed a few\r\nyears ago, to prohibit cigarmaking in tenements was unconstitutional,\r\nand thus put an end to the struggle. While it lasted, all sorts of\r\nfrightful stories were told of the shocking conditions under which\r\npeople lived and worked in these tenements, from a sanitary point of\r\nview especially, and a general impression survives to this day that\r\nthey are particularly desperate. The Board of Health, after a careful\r\ncanvass, did not find them so then. I am satisfied from personal\r\ninspection, at a much later day, guided in a number of instances by the\r\nunion cigarmakers themselves to the tenements which they considered\r\nthe worst, that the accounts were greatly exaggerated. Doubtless the\r\npeople are poor, in many cases very poor; but they are not uncleanly,\r\nrather the reverse; they live much better than the clothing-makers\r\nin the Tenth Ward, and in spite of their sallow look, that may be\r\ndue to the all-pervading smell of tobacco, they do not appear to\r\nbe less healthy than other in-door workers. I found on my tours of\r\ninvestigation several cases of consumption, of which one at least was\r\nsaid by the doctor to be due to the constant inhalation of tobacco\r\nfumes. But an examination of the death records in the Health Department\r\ndoes not support the claim that the Bohemian cigarmakers are peculiarly\r\nprone to that disease. On the contrary, the Bohemian percentage of\r\ndeaths from consumption appears quite low. This, however, is a line of\r\nscientific inquiry which I leave others to pursue, along with the more\r\ninvolved problem whether the falling off in the number of children,\r\nsometimes quite noticeable in the Bohemian settlements, is, as has been\r\nsuggested, dependent upon the character of the parents' work. The sore\r\ngrievances I found were the miserable wages and the enormous rents\r\nexacted for the minimum of accommodation. And surely these stand for\r\nenough of suffering.\r\n\r\nTake a row of houses in East Tenth Street as an instance. They\r\ncontained thirty-five families of cigarmakers, with probably not half\r\na dozen persons in the whole lot of them, outside of the children, who\r\ncould speak a word of English, though many had been in the country half\r\na lifetime. This room with two windows giving on the street, and a rear\r\nattachment without windows, called a bedroom by courtesy, is rented at\r\n$12.25 a month. In the front room man and wife work at the bench from\r\nsix in the morning till nine at night. They make a team, stripping the\r\ntobacco leaves together; then he makes the filler, and she rolls the\r\nwrapper on and finishes the cigar. For a thousand they receive $3.75,\r\nand can turn out together three thousand cigars a week. The point has\r\nbeen reached where the rebellion comes in, and the workers in these\r\ntenements are just now on a strike, demanding $5.00 and $5.50 for their\r\nwork. The manufacturer having refused, they are expecting hourly to be\r\nserved with notice to quit their homes, and the going of a stranger\r\namong them excites their resentment, until his errand is explained.\r\nWhile we are in the house, the ultimatum of the \"boss\" is received.\r\nHe will give $3.75 a thousand, not another cent. Our host is a man of\r\nseeming intelligence, yet he has been nine years in New York and knows\r\nneither English nor German. Three bright little children play about the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nHis neighbor on the same floor has been here fifteen years, but shakes\r\nhis head when asked if he can speak English. He answers in a few broken\r\nsyllables when addressed in German. With $11.75 rent to pay for like\r\naccommodation, he has the advantage of his oldest boy's work besides\r\nhis wife's at the bench. Three properly make a team, and these three\r\ncan turn out four thousand cigars a week, at $3.75. This Bohemian has a\r\nlarge family; there are four children, too small to work, to be cared\r\nfor. A comparison of the domestic bill of fare between Tenth and Ludlow\r\nStreets result, in the discovery that this Bohemian's butcher's bill\r\nfor the week, with meat at twelve cents a pound as in Ludlow Street,\r\nis from two dollars and a half to three dollars. The Polish Jew fed as\r\nbig a family on one pound of meat a day. The difference proves to be\r\ntypical. Here is a suit of three rooms, two dark, three flights up.\r\nThe ceiling is partly down in one of the rooms. \"It is three months\r\nsince we asked the landlord to fix it,\" says the oldest son, a very\r\nintelligent lad who has learned English in the evening school. His\r\nfather has not had that advantage, and has sat at his bench, deaf and\r\ndumb to the world about him except his own, for six years. He has\r\nimproved his time and become an expert at his trade. Father, mother,\r\nand son together, a full team, make from fifteen to sixteen dollars a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nA man with venerable beard and keen eyes answers our questions through\r\nan interpreter, in the next house. Very few brighter faces would be\r\nmet in a day's walk among American mechanics, yet he has in nine years\r\nlearned no syllable of English. German he probably does not want to\r\nlearn. His story supplies the explanation, as did the stories of the\r\nothers. In all that time he has been at work grubbing to earn bread.\r\nWife and he by constant labor make three thousand cigars a week,\r\nearning $11.25 when there is no lack of material; when in winter they\r\nreceive from the manufacturer tobacco for only two thousand, the\r\nrent of $10 for two rooms, practically one with a dark alcove, has\r\nnevertheless to be paid in full, and six mouths to be fed. He was\r\na blacksmith in the old country, but cannot work at his trade here\r\nbecause he does not understand \"Engliska.\" If he could, he says, with a\r\nbright look, he could do better work than he sees done here. It would\r\nseem happiness to him to knock off at 6 o'clock instead of working, as\r\nhe now often has to do, till midnight. But how? He knows of no Bohemian\r\nblacksmith who can understand him; he should starve. Here, with his\r\nwife, he can make a living at least. \"Aye,\" says she, turning, from\r\nlistening, to her household duties, \"it would be nice for sure to have\r\nfather work at his trade.\" Then what a home she could make for them,\r\nand how happy they would be. Here is an unattainable ideal, indeed, of\r\na workman in the most prosperous city in the world! There is genuine,\r\nif unspoken, pathos in the soft tap she gives her husband's hand as she\r\ngoes about her work with a half-suppressed little sigh.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BOHEMIAN CIGARMAKERS AT WORK IN THEIR TENEMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe very ash-barrels that stand in front of the big rows of tenements\r\nin Seventy-first and Seventy-third Streets advertise the business\r\nthat is carried on within. They are filled to the brim with the stems\r\nof stripped tobacco leaves. The rank smell that waited for us on the\r\ncorner of the block follows us into the hallways, penetrates every\r\nnook and cranny of the houses. As in the settlement farther down\r\ntown, every room here has its work-bench with its stumpy knife and\r\nqueer pouch of bed-tick, worn brown and greasy, fastened in front\r\nthe whole length of the bench to receive the scraps of waste. This\r\nlandlord-employer at all events gives three rooms for $12.50, if two\r\nbe dark, one wholly and the other getting some light from the front\r\nroom. The mother of the three bare-footed little children we met on\r\nthe stairs was taken to the hospital the other day when she could no\r\nlonger work. She will never come out alive. There is no waste in these\r\ntenements. Lives, like clothes, are worn through and out before put\r\naside. Her place at the bench is taken already by another who divides\r\nwith the head of the household his earnings of $15.50 a week. He has\r\njust come out successful of a strike that brought the pay of these\r\ntenements up to $4.50 per thousand cigars. Notice to quit had already\r\nbeen served on them, when the employer decided to give in, frightened\r\nby the prospective loss of rent. Asked how long he works, the man\r\nsays: \"from they can see till bed-time.\" Bed-time proves to be eleven\r\no'clock. Seventeen hours a day, seven days in the week, at thirteen\r\ncents an hour for the two, six cents and a half for each! Good average\r\nearnings for a tenement-house cigarmaker in summer. In winter it is\r\nat least one-fourth less. In spite of it all, the rooms are cleanly\r\nkept. From the bedroom farthest back the woman brings out a pile of\r\nmoist tobacco-leaves to be stripped. They are kept there, under cover\r\nlest they dry and crack, from Friday to Friday, when an accounting is\r\nmade and fresh supplies given out. The people sleep there too, but the\r\nsmell, offensive to the unfamiliar nose, does not bother them. They are\r\nused to it.\r\n\r\nIn a house around the corner that is not a factory-tenement, lives\r\nnow the cigarmaker I spoke of as suffering from consumption which the\r\ndoctor said was due to the tobacco-fumes. Perhaps the lack of healthy\r\nexercise had as much to do with it. His case is interesting from its\r\nown stand-point. He too is one with a--for a Bohemian--large family.\r\nSix children sit at his table. By trade a shoemaker, for thirteen\r\nyears he helped his wife make cigars in the manufacturer's tenement.\r\nShe was a very good hand, and until his health gave out two years ago\r\nthey were able to make from $17 to $25 a week, by lengthening the day\r\nat both ends. Now that he can work no more, and the family under the\r\ndoctor's orders has moved away from the smell of tobacco, the burden\r\nof its support has fallen upon her alone, for none of the children\r\nare old enough to help. She has work in the shop at eight dollars a\r\nweek, and this must go round; it is all there is. Happily, this being\r\na tenement for revenue only, unmixed with cigars, the rent is cheaper:\r\nseven dollars for two bright rooms on the top floor. No housekeeping\r\nis attempted. A woman in Seventy-second Street supplies their cooking,\r\nwhich the wife and mother fetches in a basket, her husband being too\r\nweak. Breakfast of coffee and hard-tack, or black bread, at twenty\r\ncents for the whole eight; a good many, the little woman says with a\r\nbrave, patient smile, and there is seldom anything to spare, but----.\r\nThe invalid is listening, and the sentence remains unfinished. What of\r\ndinner? One of the children brings it from the cook. Oh! it is a good\r\ndinner, meat, soup, greens and bread, all for thirty cents. It is the\r\nprincipal family meal. Does she come home for dinner? No; she cannot\r\nleave the shop, but gets a bite at her bench. The question: A bite of\r\nwhat? seems as merciless as the surgeon's knife, and she winces under\r\nit as one shrinks from physical pain. Bread, then. But at night they\r\nall have supper together--sausage and bread. For ten cents they can eat\r\nall they want. Can they not? she says, stroking the hair of the little\r\nboy at her knee; his eyes glisten hungrily at the thought, as he nods\r\nstoutly in support of his mother. Only, she adds, the week the rent is\r\ndue, they have to shorten rations to pay the landlord.\r\n\r\nBut what of his being an Anarchist, this Bohemian--an infidel--I hear\r\nsomebody say. Almost one might be persuaded by such facts as these--and\r\nthey are everyday facts, not fancy--to retort: what more natural? With\r\nevery hand raised against him in the old land and the new, in the land\r\nof his hoped-for freedom, what more logical than that his should be\r\nturned against society that seems to exist only for his oppression?\r\nBut the charge is not half true. Naturally the Bohemian loves peace,\r\nas he loves music and song. As someone has said: He does not seek war,\r\nbut when attacked knows better how to die than how to surrender. The\r\nCzech is the Irishman of Central Europe, with all his genius and his\r\nstrong passions, with the same bitter traditions of landlord-robbery,\r\nperpetuated here where he thought to forget them; like him ever and on\r\nprinciple in the opposition, \"agin the government\" wherever he goes.\r\nAmong such a people, ground by poverty until their songs have died in\r\ncurses upon their oppressors, hopelessly isolated and ignorant of our\r\nlanguage and our laws, it would not be hard for bad men at any time\r\nto lead a few astray. And this is what has been done. Yet, even with\r\nthe occasional noise made by the few, the criminal statistics already\r\nalluded to quite dispose of the charge that they incline to turbulence\r\nand riot. So it is with the infidel propaganda, the legacy perhaps of\r\nthe fierce contention through hundreds of years between Catholics and\r\nProtestants on Bohemia's soil, of bad faith and savage persecutions\r\nin the name of the Christians' God that disgrace its history. The\r\nBohemian clergyman, who spoke for his people at the Christian\r\nConference held in Chickering Hall two years ago, took even stronger\r\nground. \"They are Roman Catholics by birth, infidels by necessity, and\r\nProtestants by history and inclination,\" he said. Yet he added his\r\ntestimony in the same breath to the fact that, though the Freethinkers\r\nhad started two schools in the immediate neighborhood of his church\r\nto counteract its influence, his flock had grown in a few years from\r\na mere handful at the start to proportions far beyond his hopes,\r\ngathering in both Anarchists and Freethinkers, and making good church\r\nmembers of them.\r\n\r\nThus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of\r\neducation, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably\r\npoor almost to a man. \"There is not,\" said one of them, who knew\r\nthoroughly what he was speaking of, \"there is not one of them all, who,\r\nif he were to sell all he was worth to-morrow, would have money enough\r\nto buy a house and lot in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                      THE COLOR LINE IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe color line must be drawn through the tenements to give the picture\r\nits proper shading. The landlord does the drawing, does it with an\r\nabsence of pretence, a frankness of despotism, that is nothing if not\r\nbrutal. The Czar of all the Russias is not more absolute upon his own\r\nsoil than the New York landlord in his dealings with colored tenants.\r\nWhere he permits them to live, they go; where he shuts the door, stay\r\nout. By his grace they exist at all in certain localities; his ukase\r\nbanishes them from others. He accepts the responsibility, when laid at\r\nhis door, with unruffled complacency. It is business, he will tell you.\r\nAnd it is. He makes the prejudice in which he traffics pay him well,\r\nand that, as he thinks it quite superfluous to tell you, is what he is\r\nthere for.\r\n\r\nThat his pencil does not make quite as black a mark as it did, that\r\nthe hand that wields it does not bear down as hard as only a short\r\nhalf dozen years ago, is the hopeful sign of an awakening public\r\nconscience under the stress of which the line shows signs of wavering.\r\nBut for this the landlord deserves no credit. It has come, is coming\r\nabout despite him. The line may not be wholly effaced while the name\r\nof the negro, alone among the world's races, is spelled with a small\r\nn. Natural selection will have more or less to do beyond a doubt in\r\nevery age with dividing the races; only so, it may be, can they work\r\nout together their highest destiny. But with the despotism that\r\ndeliberately assigns to the defenceless Black the lowest level for\r\nthe purpose of robbing him there that has nothing to do. Of such\r\nslavery, different only in degree from the other kind that held him\r\nas a chattel, to be sold or bartered at the will of his master, this\r\ncentury, if signs fail not, will see the end in New York.\r\n\r\nEver since the war New York has been receiving the overflow of colored\r\npopulation from the Southern cities. In the last decade this migration\r\nhas grown to such proportions that it is estimated that our Blacks have\r\nquite doubled in number since the Tenth Census. Whether the exchange\r\nhas been of advantage to the negro may well be questioned. Trades of\r\nwhich he had practical control in his Southern home are not open to\r\nhim here. I know that it may be answered that there is no industrial\r\nproscription of color; that it is a matter of choice. Perhaps so. At\r\nall events he does not choose then. How many colored carpenters or\r\nmasons has anyone seen at work in New York? In the South there are\r\nenough of them and, if the testimony of the most intelligent of their\r\npeople is worth anything, plenty of them have come here. As a matter of\r\nfact the colored man takes in New York, without a struggle, the lower\r\nlevel of menial service for which his past traditions and natural love\r\nof ease perhaps as yet fit him best. Even the colored barber is rapidly\r\ngetting to be a thing of the past. Along shore, at any unskilled labor,\r\nhe works unmolested; but he does not appear to prefer the job. His\r\nsphere thus defined, he naturally takes his stand among the poor, and\r\nin the homes of the poor. Until very recent times--the years since a\r\nchange was wrought can be counted on the fingers of one hand--he was\r\npractically restricted in the choice of a home to a narrow section\r\non the West Side, that nevertheless had a social top and bottom to\r\nit--the top in the tenements on the line of Seventh Avenue as far north\r\nas Thirty-second Street, where he was allowed to occupy the houses of\r\nunsavory reputation which the police had cleared and for which decent\r\nwhite tenants could not be found; the bottom in the vile rookeries\r\nof Thompson Street and South Fifth Avenue, the old \"Africa\" that is\r\nnow fast becoming a modern Italy. To-day there are black colonies in\r\nYorkville and Morrisania. The encroachment of business and the Italian\r\nbelow, and the swelling of the population above, have been the chief\r\nagents in working out his second emancipation, a very real one, for\r\nwith his cutting loose from the old tenements there has come a distinct\r\nand gratifying improvement in the tenant, that argues louder than\r\ntheories or speeches the influence of vile surroundings in debasing\r\nthe man. The colored citizen whom this year's census man found in his\r\nNinety-ninth Street \"flat\" is a very different individual from the\r\n\"nigger\" his predecessor counted in the black-and-tan slums of Thompson\r\nand Sullivan Streets. There is no more clean and orderly community in\r\nNew York than the new settlement of colored people that is growing up\r\non the East Side from Yorkville to Harlem.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is the characteristic of the negro in his new surroundings,\r\nas it was his virtue in the old. In this respect he is immensely the\r\nsuperior of the lowest of the whites, the Italians and the Polish\r\nJews, below whom he has been classed in the past in the tenant scale.\r\nNevertheless, he has always had to pay higher rents than even these\r\nfor the poorest and most stinted rooms. The exceptions I have come\r\nacross, in which the rents, though high, have seemed more nearly on a\r\nlevel with what was asked for the same number and size of rooms in the\r\naverage tenement, were in the case of tumble-down rookeries in which no\r\none else would live, and were always coupled with the condition that\r\nthe landlord should \"make no repairs.\" It can readily be seen, that his\r\nprofits were scarcely curtailed by his \"humanity.\" The reason advanced\r\nfor this systematic robbery is that white people will not live in the\r\nsame house with colored tenants, or even in a house recently occupied\r\nby negroes, and that consequently its selling value is injured. The\r\nprejudice undoubtedly exists, but it is not lessened by the house\r\nagents, who have set up the maxim \"once a colored house, always a\r\ncolored house.\"\r\n\r\nThere is method in the maxim, as shown by an inquiry made last year by\r\nthe _Real Estate Record_. It proved agents to be practically unanimous\r\nin the endorsement of the negro as a clean, orderly, and \"profitable\"\r\ntenant. Here is the testimony of one of the largest real estate firms\r\nin the city: \"We would rather have negro tenants in our poorest class\r\nof tenements than the lower grades of foreign white people. We find the\r\nformer cleaner than the latter, and they do not destroy the property\r\nso much. We also get higher prices. We have a tenement on Nineteenth\r\nStreet, where we get $10 for two rooms which we could not get more\r\nthan $7.50 for from white tenants previously. We have a four-story\r\ntenement on our books on Thirty-third Street, between Sixth and Seventh\r\nAvenues, with four rooms per floor--a parlor, two bedrooms, and a\r\nkitchen. We get $20 for the first floor, $24 for the second, $23 for\r\nthe third and $20 for the fourth, in all $87 or $1,044 per annum. The\r\nsize of the building is only 21+55.\" Another firm declared that in a\r\nspecified instance they had saved fifteen to twenty per cent. on the\r\ngross rentals since they changed their white tenants for colored ones.\r\nStill another gave the following case of a front and rear tenement\r\nthat had formerly been occupied by tenants of a \"low European type,\"\r\nwho had been turned out on account of filthy habits and poor pay. The\r\nnegroes proved cleaner, better, and steadier tenants.

Profitable, surely!\r\n\r\nI have quoted these cases at length in order to let in light on the\r\nquality of this landlord despotism that has purposely confused the\r\npublic mind, and for its own selfish ends is propping up a waning\r\nprejudice. It will be cause for congratulation if indeed its time has\r\ncome at last. Within a year, I am told by one of the most intelligent\r\nand best informed of our colored citizens, there has been evidence,\r\nsimultaneous with the colored hegira from the low down-town tenements,\r\nof a movement toward less exorbitant rents. I cannot pass from this\r\nsubject without adding a leaf from my own experience that deserves a\r\nplace in this record, though, for the credit of humanity, I hope as\r\nan extreme case. It was last Christmas that I had occasion to visit\r\nthe home of an old colored woman in Sixteenth Street, as the almoner\r\nof generous friends out of town who wished me to buy her a Christmas\r\ndinner. The old woman lived in a wretched shanty, occupying two mean,\r\ndilapidated rooms at the top of a sort of hen-ladder that went by the\r\nname of stairs. For these she paid ten dollars a month out of her\r\nhard-earned wages as a scrub-woman. I did not find her in and, being\r\ninformed that she was \"at the agent's,\" went around to hunt her up. The\r\nagent's wife appeared, to report that Ann was out. Being in a hurry\r\nit occurred to me that I might save time by making her employer the\r\npurveyor of my friend's bounty, and proposed to entrust the money, two\r\ndollars, to her to be expended for Old Ann's benefit. She fell in with\r\nthe suggestion at once, and confided to me in the fullness of her heart\r\nthat she liked the plan, inasmuch as \"I generally find her a Christmas\r\ndinner myself, and this money--she owes Mr. ---- (her husband, the agent)\r\na lot of rent.\" Needless to state that there was a change of programme\r\nthen and there, and that Ann was saved from the sort of Christmas cheer\r\nthat woman's charity would have spread before her. When I had the old\r\nsoul comfortably installed in her own den, with a chicken and \"fixin's\"\r\nand a bright fire in her stove, I asked her how much she owed of her\r\nrent. Her answer was that she did not really owe anything, her month\r\nnot being quite up, but that the amount yet unpaid was--two dollars!\r\n\r\nPoverty, abuse, and injustice alike the negro accepts with\r\nimperturbable cheerfulness. His philosophy is of the kind that has no\r\nroom for repining. Whether lie lives in an Eighth Ward barrack or in\r\na tenement with a brown-stone front and pretensions to the title of\r\n\"flat,\" he looks at the sunny side of life and enjoys it. He loves fine\r\nclothes and good living a good deal more than he does a bank account.\r\nThe proverbial rainy day it would be rank ingratitude, from his point\r\nof view, to look for when the sun shines unclouded in a clear sky.\r\nHis home surroundings, except when he is utterly depraved, reflect\r\nhis blithesome temper. The poorest negro housekeeper's room in New\r\nYork is bright with gaily-colored prints of his beloved \"Abe Linkum,\"\r\nGeneral Grant, President Garfield, Mrs. Cleveland, and other national\r\ncelebrities, and cheery with flowers and singing birds. In the art of\r\nputting the best foot foremost, of disguising his poverty by making\r\na little go a long way, our negro has no equal. When a fair share of\r\nprosperity is his, he knows how to make life and home very pleasant\r\nto those about him. Pianos and parlor furniture abound in the uptown\r\nhomes of colored tenants and give them a very prosperous air. But even\r\nwhere the wolf howls at the door, he makes a bold and gorgeous front.\r\nThe amount of \"style\" displayed on fine Sundays on Sixth and Seventh\r\nAvenues by colored holiday-makers would turn a pessimist black with\r\nwrath. The negro's great ambition is to rise in the social scale to\r\nwhich his color has made him a stranger and an outsider, and he is\r\nquite willing to accept the shadow for the substance where that is\r\nthe best he can get. The claw-hammer coat and white tie of a waiter\r\nin a first-class summer hotel, with the chance of taking his ease in\r\nsix months of winter, are to him the next best thing to mingling with\r\nthe white quality he serves, on equal terms. His festive gatherings,\r\npre-eminently his cake-walks, at which a sugared and frosted cake is\r\nthe proud prize of the couple with the most aristocratic step and\r\ncarriage, are comic mixtures of elaborate ceremonial and the joyous\r\nabandon of the natural man. With all his ludicrous incongruities, his\r\nsensuality and his lack of moral accountability, his superstition and\r\nother faults that are the effect of temperament and of centuries of\r\nslavery, he has his eminently good points. He is loyal to the backbone,\r\nproud of being an American and of his new-found citizenship. He is at\r\nleast as easily moulded for good as for evil. His churches are crowded\r\nto the doors on Sunday nights when the colored colony turns out to\r\nworship. His people own church property in this city upon which they\r\nhave paid half a million dollars out of the depth of their poverty,\r\nwith comparatively little assistance from their white brethren. He\r\nis both willing and anxious to learn, and his intellectual status is\r\ndistinctly improving. If his emotions are not very deeply rooted, they\r\nare at least sincere while they last, and until the tempter gets the\r\nupper hand again.\r\n\r\nOf all the temptations that beset him, the one that troubles him and\r\nthe police most is his passion for gambling. The game of policy is a\r\nkind of unlawful penny lottery specially adapted to his means, but\r\npatronized extensively by poor white players as well. It is the meanest\r\nof swindles, but reaps for its backers rich fortunes wherever colored\r\npeople congregate. Between the fortune-teller and the policy shop,\r\nclosely allied frauds always, the wages of many a hard day's work are\r\nwasted by the negro; but the loss causes him few regrets. Penniless,\r\nbut with undaunted faith in his ultimate \"luck,\" he looks forward to\r\nthe time when he shall once more be able to take a hand at \"beating\r\npolicy.\" When periodically the negro's lucky numbers, 4-11-44, come\r\nout on the slips of the alleged daily drawings, that are supposed to\r\nbe held in some far-off Western town, intense excitement reigns in\r\nThompson Street and along the Avenue, where someone is always the\r\nwinner. An immense impetus is given then to the bogus business that has\r\nno existence outside of the cigar stores and candy shops where it hides\r\nfrom the law, save in some cunning Bowery \"broker's\" back office, where\r\nthe slips are printed and the \"winnings\" apportioned daily with due\r\nregard to the backer's interests.\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether \"Africa\" has been improved by the advent of\r\nthe Italian, with the tramp from the Mulberry Street Bend in his train.\r\nThe moral turpitude of Thompson Street has been notorious for years,\r\nand the mingling of the three elements does not seem to have wrought\r\nany change for the better. The borderland where the white and black\r\nraces meet in common debauch, the aptly-named black-and-tan saloon, has\r\nnever been debatable ground from a moral stand-point. It has always\r\nbeen the worst of the desperately bad. Than this commingling of the\r\nutterly depraved of both sexes, white and black, on such ground, there\r\ncan be no greater abomination. Usually it is some foul cellar dive,\r\nperhaps run by the political \"leader\" of the district, who is \"in with\"\r\nthe police. In any event it gathers to itself all the law-breakers\r\nand all the human wrecks within reach. When a fight breaks out during\r\nthe dance a dozen razors are handy in as many boot-legs, and there is\r\nalways a job for the surgeon and the ambulance. The black \"tough\" is as\r\nhandy with the razor in a fight as his peaceably inclined brother is\r\nwith it in pursuit of his honest trade. As the Chinaman hides his knife\r\nin his sleeve and the Italian his stiletto in the bosom, so the negro\r\ngoes to the ball with a razor in his boot-leg, and on occasion does\r\nas much execution with it as both of the others together. More than\r\nthree-fourths of the business the police have with the colored people\r\nin New York arises in the black-and-tan district, now no longer fairly\r\nrepresentative of their color.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A BLACK-AND-TAN DIVE IN \"AFRICA.\"]\r\n\r\nI have touched briefly upon such facts in the negro's life as may serve\r\nto throw light on the social condition of his people in New York. If,\r\nwhen the account is made up between the races, it shall be claimed that\r\nhe falls short of the result to be expected from twenty-five years of\r\nfreedom, it may be well to turn to the other side of the ledger and see\r\nhow much of the blame is borne by the prejudice and greed that have\r\nkept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could\r\nhardly be equal. And in this view he may be seen to have advanced much\r\nfarther and faster than before suspected, and to promise, after all,\r\nwith fair treatment, quite as well as the rest of us, his white-skinned\r\nfellow-citizens, had any right to expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                            THE COMMON HERD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another line not always so readily drawn in the tenements,\r\nyet the real boundary line of the Other Half: the one that defines the\r\n\"flat.\" The law does not draw it at all, accounting all flats tenements\r\nwithout distinction. The health officer draws it from observation,\r\nlumping all those which in his judgment have nothing, or not enough, to\r\ngive them claim upon the name, with the common herd, and his way is,\r\nperhaps, on the whole, the surest and best. The outside of the building\r\ngives no valuable clew. Brass and brown-stone go well sometimes with\r\ndense crowds and dark and dingy rooms; but the first attempt to enter\r\nhelps draw the line with tolerable distinctness. A locked door is a\r\nstrong point in favor of the flat. It argues that the first step has\r\nbeen taken to secure privacy, the absence of which is the chief curse\r\nof the tenement. Behind a locked door the hoodlum is not at home,\r\nunless there be a jailor in place of a janitor to guard it. Not that\r\nthe janitor and the door-bell are infallible. There may be a tenement\r\nbehind a closed door; but never a \"flat\" without it. The hall that is a\r\nhighway for all the world by night and by day is the tenement's proper\r\nbadge. The Other Half ever receives with open doors.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OPEN DOOR.]\r\n\r\nWith this introduction we shall not seek it long anywhere in the city.\r\nBelow Houston Street the door-bell in our age is as extinct as the\r\ndodo. East of Second Avenue, and west of Ninth Avenue as far up as\r\nthe Park, it is practically an unknown institution. The nearer the\r\nriver and the great workshops the more numerous the tenements. The\r\nkind of work carried on in any locality to a large extent determines\r\ntheir character. Skilled and well-paid labor puts its stamp on a\r\ntenement even in spite of the open door, and usually soon supplies the\r\nmissing bell. Gas-houses, slaughter-houses and the docks, that attract\r\nthe roughest crowds and support the vilest saloons, invariably form\r\nslum-centres. The city is full of such above the line of Fourteenth\r\nStreet, that is erroneously supposed by some to fence off the good\r\nfrom the bad, separate the chaff from the wheat. There is nothing\r\nbelow that line that can outdo in wickedness Hell's Kitchen, in the\r\nregion of three-cent whiskey, or its counterpoise at the other end\r\nof Thirty-ninth Street, on the East River, the home of the infamous\r\nRag Gang. Cherry Street is not \"tougher\" than Battle Row in East\r\nSixty-third Street, or \"the village\" at Twenty-ninth Street and First\r\nAvenue, where stores of broken bricks, ammunition for the nightly\r\nconflicts with the police, are part of the regulation outfit of every\r\ntenement. The Mulberry Street Bend is scarce dirtier than Little\r\nItaly in Harlem. Even across the Harlem River, Frog Hollow challenges\r\nthe admiration of the earlier slums for the boldness and pernicious\r\nactivity of its home gang. There are enough of these sore spots. We\r\nshall yet have occasion to look into the social conditions of some of\r\nthem; were I to draw a picture of them here as they are, the subject,\r\nI fear, would outgrow alike the limits of this book and the reader's\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nIt is true that they tell only one side of the story; that there is\r\nanother to tell. A story of thousands of devoted lives, laboring\r\nearnestly to make the most of their scant opportunities for good; of\r\nheroic men and women striving patiently against fearful odds and by\r\ntheir very courage coming off victors in the battle with the tenement;\r\nof womanhood pure and undefiled. That it should blossom in such an\r\natmosphere is one of the unfathomable mysteries of life. And yet it\r\nis not an uncommon thing to find sweet and innocent girls, singularly\r\nuntouched by the evil around them, true wives and faithful mothers,\r\nliterally \"like jewels in a swine's snout,\" in the worst of the\r\ninfamous barracks. It is the experience of all who have intelligently\r\nobserved this side of life in a great city, not to be explained--unless\r\non the theory of my friend, the priest in the Mulberry Street Bend,\r\nthat inherent purity revolts instinctively from the naked brutality of\r\nvice as seen in the slums--but to be thankfully accepted as the one\r\ngleam of hope in an otherwise hopeless desert.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BIRD'S-EYE VIEW of AN EAST SIDE TENEMENT BLOCK.\r\n                 (FROM A DRAWING BY CHARLES F. WINGATE, ESQ.)]\r\n\r\nBut the relief is not great. In the dull content of life bred on\r\nthe tenement-house dead level there is little to redeem it, or to\r\ncalm apprehension for a society that has nothing better to offer its\r\ntoilers; while the patient efforts of the lives finally attuned to\r\nit to render the situation tolerable, and the very success of these\r\nefforts, serve only to bring out in stronger contrast the general\r\ngloom of the picture by showing how much farther they might have\r\ngone with half a chance. Go into any of the \"respectable\" tenement\r\nneighborhoods--the fact that there are not more than two saloons on\r\nthe corner, nor over three or four in the block will serve as a fair\r\nguide--where live the great body of hard-working Irish and German\r\nimmigrants and their descendants, who accept naturally the conditions\r\nof tenement life, because for them there is nothing else in New York;\r\nbe with and among its people until you understand their ways, their\r\naims, and the quality of their ambitions, and unless you can content\r\nyourself with the scriptural promise that the poor we shall have\r\nalways with us, or with the menagerie view that, if fed, they have no\r\ncause of complaint, you shall come away agreeing with me that, humanly\r\nspeaking, life there does not seem worth the living. Take at random\r\none of these uptown tenement blocks, not of the worst nor yet of the\r\nmost prosperous kind, within hail of what the newspapers would call\r\na \"fine residential section.\" These houses were built since the last\r\ncholera scare made people willing to listen to reason. The block is\r\nnot like the one over on the East Side in which I actually lost my way\r\nonce. There were thirty or forty rear houses in the heart of it, three\r\nor four on every lot, set at all sorts of angles, with odd, winding\r\npassages, or no passage at all, only \"runways\" for the thieves and\r\ntoughs of the neighborhood. These yards are clear. There is air there,\r\nand it is about all there is. The view between brick walls outside is\r\nthat of a stony street; inside, of rows of unpainted board fences, a\r\nbewildering maze of clothes-posts and lines; underfoot, a desert of\r\nbrown, hard-baked soil from which every blade of grass, every stray\r\nweed, every speck of green, has been trodden out, as must inevitably be\r\nevery gentle thought and aspiration above the mere wants of the body\r\nin those whose moral natures such home surroundings are to nourish. In\r\nself-defence, you know, all life eventually accommodates itself to its\r\nenvironment, and human life is no exception. Within the house there is\r\nnothing to supply the want thus left unsatisfied. Tenement-houses have\r\nno æsthetic resources. If any are to be brought to bear on them, they\r\nmust come from the outside. There is the common hall with doors opening\r\nsoftly on every landing as the strange step is heard on the stairs,\r\nthe air-shaft that seems always so busy letting out foul stenches from\r\nbelow that it has no time to earn its name by bringing down fresh air,\r\nthe squeaking pumps that hold no water, and the rent that is never\r\nless than one week's wages out of the four, quite as often half of the\r\nfamily earnings.\r\n\r\nWhy complete the sketch? It is drearily familiar already. Such as it\r\nis, it is the frame in which are set days, weeks, months, and years of\r\nunceasing toil, just able to fill the mouth and clothe the back. Such\r\nas it is, it is the world, and all of it, to which these weary workers\r\nreturn nightly to feed heart and brain after wearing out the body at\r\nthe bench, or in the shop. To it come the young with their restless\r\nyearnings, perhaps to pass on the threshold one of the daughters of\r\nsin, driven to the tenement by the police when they raided her den,\r\nsallying forth in silks and fine attire after her day of idleness.\r\nThese in their coarse garments--girls with the love of youth for\r\nbeautiful things, with this hard life before them--who shall save them\r\nfrom the tempter? Down in the street the saloon, always bright and gay,\r\ngathering to itself all the cheer of the block, beckons the boys. In\r\nmany such blocks the census-taker found two thousand men, women, and\r\nchildren, and over, who called them home.\r\n\r\nThe picture is faithful enough to stand for its class wherever along\r\nboth rivers the Irish brogue is heard. As already said, the Celt\r\nfalls most readily victim to tenement influences since shanty-town\r\nand its original free-soilers have become things of the past. If he\r\nbe thrifty and shrewd his progress thenceforward is along the plane\r\nof the tenement, on which he soon assumes to manage without improving\r\nthings. The German has an advantage over his Celtic neighbor in his\r\nstrong love for flowers, which not all the tenements on the East Side\r\nhave power to smother. His garden goes with him wherever he goes. Not\r\nthat it represents any high moral principle in the man; rather perhaps\r\nthe capacity for it. He turns his saloon into a shrubbery as soon as\r\nhis back-yard. But wherever he puts it in a tenement block it does\r\nthe work of a dozen police clubs. In proportion as it spreads the\r\nneighborhood takes on a more orderly character. As the green dies out\r\nof the landscape and increases in political importance, the police find\r\nmore to do. Where it disappears altogether from sight, lapsing into a\r\nmere sentiment, police-beats are shortened and the force patrols double\r\nat night. Neither the man nor the sentiment is wholly responsible for\r\nthis. It is the tenement unadorned that is. The changing of Tompkins\r\nSquare from a sand lot into a beautiful park put an end for good and\r\nall to the Bread and Blood riots of which it used to be the scene, and\r\ntransformed a nest of dangerous agitators into a harmless, beer-craving\r\nband of Anarchists. They have scarcely been heard of since. Opponents\r\nof the small parks system as a means of relieving the congested\r\npopulation of tenement districts, please take note.\r\n\r\nWith the first hot nights in June police despatches, that record the\r\nkilling of men and women by rolling off roofs and window-sills while\r\nasleep, announce that the time of greatest suffering among the poor\r\nis at hand. It is in hot weather, when life indoors is well-nigh\r\nunbearable with cooking, sleeping, and working, all crowded into the\r\nsmall rooms together, that the tenement expands, reckless of all\r\nrestraint. Then a strange and picturesque life moves upon the flat\r\nroofs. In the day and early evening mothers air their babies there,\r\nthe boys fly their kites from the house-tops, undismayed by police\r\nregulations, and the young men and girls court and pass the growler.\r\nIn the stifling July nights, when the big barracks are like fiery\r\nfurnaces, their very walls giving out absorbed heat, men and women lie\r\nin restless, sweltering rows, panting for air and sleep. Then every\r\ntruck in the street, every crowded fire-escape, becomes a bedroom,\r\ninfinitely preferable to any the house affords. A cooling shower on\r\nsuch a night is hailed as a heaven-sent blessing in a hundred thousand\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nLife in the tenements in July and August spells death to an army of\r\nlittle ones whom the doctor's skill is powerless to save. When the\r\nwhite badge of mourning flutters from every second door, sleepless\r\nmothers walk the streets in the gray of the early dawn, trying to stir\r\na cooling breeze to fan the brow of the sick baby. There is no sadder\r\nsight than this patient devotion striving against fearfully hopeless\r\nodds. Fifty \"summer doctors,\" especially trained to this work, are\r\nthen sent into the tenements by the Board of Health, with free advice\r\nand medicine for the poor. Devoted women follow in their track with\r\ncare and nursing for the sick. Fresh-air excursions run daily out of\r\nNew York on land and water; but despite all efforts the grave-diggers\r\nin Calvary work over-time, and little coffins are stacked mountains\r\nhigh on the deck of the Charity Commissioners' boat when it makes its\r\nsemi-weekly trips to the city cemetery.\r\n\r\nUnder the most favorable circumstances, an epidemic, which the\r\nwell-to-do can afford to make light of as a thing to be got over or\r\navoided by reasonable care, is excessively fatal among the children of\r\nthe poor, by reason of the practical impossibility of isolating the\r\npatient in a tenement. The measles, ordinarily a harmless disease,\r\nfurnishes a familiar example. Tread it ever so lightly on the avenues,\r\nin the tenements it kills right and left. Such an epidemic ravaged\r\nthree crowded blocks in Elizabeth Street on the heels of the grippe\r\nlast winter, and, when it had spent its fury, the death-maps in the\r\nBureau of Vital Statistics looked as if a black hand had been laid\r\nacross those blocks, over-shadowing in part the contiguous tenements\r\nin Mott Street, and with the thumb covering a particularly packed\r\nsettlement of half a dozen houses in Mulberry Street. The track of the\r\nepidemic through these teeming barracks was as clearly defined as the\r\ntrack of a tornado through a forest district. There were houses in\r\nwhich as many as eight little children had died in five months. The\r\nrecords showed that respiratory diseases, the common heritage of the\r\ngrippe and the measles, had caused death in most cases, discovering the\r\ntrouble to be, next to the inability to check the contagion in those\r\ncrowds, in the poverty of the parents and the wretched home conditions\r\nthat made proper care of the sick impossible. The fact was emphasized\r\nby the occurrence here and there of a few isolated deaths from\r\ndiphtheria and scarlet fever. In the case of these diseases, considered\r\nmore dangerous to the public health, the health officers exercised\r\nsummary powers of removal to the hospital where proper treatment could\r\nbe had, and the result was a low death-rate.\r\n\r\nThese were tenements of the tall, modern type. A little more than a\r\nyear ago, when a census was made of the tenements and compared with the\r\nmortality tables, no little surprise and congratulation was caused by\r\nthe discovery that as the buildings grew taller the death-rate fell.\r\nThe reason is plain, though the reverse had been expected by most\r\npeople. The biggest tenements have been built in the last ten years of\r\nsanitary reform rule, and have been brought, in all but the crowding,\r\nunder its laws. The old houses that from private dwellings were made\r\ninto tenements, or were run up to house the biggest crowds in defiance\r\nof every moral and physical law, can be improved by no device short of\r\ndemolition. They will ever remain the worst.\r\n\r\nThat ignorance plays its part, as well as poverty and bad hygienic\r\nsurroundings, in the sacrifice of life is of course inevitable. They\r\ngo usually hand in hand. A message came one day last spring summoning\r\nme to a Mott Street tenement in which lay a child dying from some\r\nunknown disease. With the \"charity doctor\" I found the patient on the\r\ntop floor, stretched upon two chairs in a dreadfully stifling room. She\r\nwas gasping in the agony of peritonitis that had already written its\r\ndeath-sentence on her wan and pinched face. The whole family, father,\r\nmother, and four ragged children, sat around looking on with the stony\r\nresignation of helpless despair that had long since given up the fight\r\nagainst fate as useless. A glance around the wretched room left no\r\ndoubt as to the cause of the child's condition. \"Improper nourishment,\"\r\nsaid the doctor, which, translated to suit the place, meant starvation.\r\nThe father's hands were crippled from lead poisoning. He had not been\r\nable to work for a year. A contagious disease of the eyes, too long\r\nneglected, had made the mother and one of the boys nearly blind. The\r\nchildren cried with hunger. They had not broken their fast that day,\r\nand it was then near noon. For months the family had subsisted on two\r\ndollars a week from the priest, and a few loaves and a piece of corned\r\nbeef which the sisters sent them on Saturday. The doctor gave direction\r\nfor the treatment of the child, knowing that it was possible only to\r\nalleviate its sufferings until death should end them, and left some\r\nmoney for food for the rest. An hour later, when I returned, I found\r\nthem feeding the dying child with ginger ale, bought for two cents a\r\nbottle at the pedlar's cart down the street. A pitying neighbor had\r\nproposed it as the one thing she could think of as likely to make the\r\nchild forget its misery. There was enough in the bottle to go round to\r\nthe rest of the family. In fact, the wake had already begun; before\r\nnight it was under way in dead earnest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IN POVERTY GAP, WEST TWENTY-EIGHTH ST. AN ENGLISH\r\n                 COAL-HEAVER'S HOME.[17]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Suspicions of murder, in the case of a woman who was\r\nfound dead, covered with bruises, after a day's running fight with her\r\nhusband, in which the beer jug had been the bone of contention, brought\r\nme to this house, a ramshackle tenement on the tail-end of a lot over\r\nnear the North River docks. The family in the picture lived above the\r\nrooms where the dead woman lay on a bed of straw, overrun by rats, and\r\nhad been uninterested witnesses of the affray that was an everyday\r\noccurrence in the house. A patched and shaky stairway led up to their\r\none bare and miserable room, in comparison with which a white-washed\r\nprison-cell seemed a real palace. A heap of old rags, in which the baby\r\nslept serenely, served as the common sleeping-bunk of father, mother,\r\nand children--two bright and pretty girls, singularly out of keeping in\r\ntheir clean, if coarse, dresses, with their surroundings. The father,\r\na slow-going, honest English coal-heaver, earned on the average five\r\ndollars a week, \"when work was fairly brisk,\" at the docks. But there\r\nwere long seasons when it was very \"slack,\" he said, doubtfully.\r\nYet the prospect did not seem to discourage them. The mother, a\r\npleasant-faced woman, was cheerful, even light-hearted. Her smile\r\nseemed the most sadly hopeless of all in the utter wretchedness of\r\nthe place, cheery though it was meant to be and really was. It seemed\r\ndoomed to certain disappointment--the one thing there that was yet to\r\nknow a greater depth of misery.]\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while a case of downright starvation gets into the\r\nnewspapers and makes a sensation. But this is the exception. Were the\r\nwhole truth known, it would come home to the community with a shock\r\nthat would rouse it to a more serious effort than the spasmodic undoing\r\nof its purse-strings. I am satisfied from my own observation that\r\nhundreds of men, women, and children are every day slowly starving to\r\ndeath in the tenements with my medical friend's complaint of \"improper\r\nnourishment.\" Within a single week I have had this year three cases\r\nof insanity, provoked directly by poverty and want. One was that of\r\na mother who in the middle of the night got up to murder her child,\r\nwho was crying for food; another was the case of an Elizabeth Street\r\ntruck-driver whom the newspapers never heard of. With a family to\r\nprovide for, he had been unable to work for many months. There was\r\nneither food, nor a scrap of anything upon which money could be raised,\r\nleft in the house; his mind gave way under the combined physical and\r\nmental suffering. In the third case I was just in time with the police\r\nto prevent the madman from murdering his whole family. He had the\r\nsharpened hatchet in his pocket when we seized him. He was an Irish\r\nlaborer, and had been working in the sewers until the poisonous gases\r\ndestroyed his health. Then he was laid off, and scarcely anything had\r\nbeen coming in all winter but the oldest child's earnings as cash-girl\r\nin a store, $2.50 a week. There were seven children to provide for, and\r\nthe rent of the Mulberry Street attic in which the family lived was $10\r\na month. They had borrowed as long as anybody had a cent to lend. When\r\nat last the man got an odd job that would just buy the children bread,\r\nthe week's wages only served to measure the depth of their misery. \"It\r\ncame in so on the tail-end of everything,\" said his wife in telling\r\nthe story, with unconscious eloquence. The outlook worried him through\r\nsleepless nights until it destroyed his reason. In his madness he had\r\nonly one conscious thought: that the town should not take the children.\r\n\"Better that I take care of them myself,\" he repeated to himself as he\r\nground the axe to an edge. Help came in abundance from many almost\r\nas poor as they when the desperate straits of the family became known\r\nthrough his arrest. The readiness of the poor to share what little they\r\nhave with those who have even less is one of the few moral virtues of\r\nthe tenements. Their enormous crowds touch elbow in a closeness of\r\nsympathy that is scarcely to be understood out of them, and has no\r\nparallel except among the unfortunate women whom the world scorns as\r\noutcasts. There is very little professed sentiment about it to draw a\r\nsentimental tear from the eye of romantic philanthropy. The hard fact\r\nis that the instinct of self-preservation impels them to make common\r\ncause against the common misery.\r\n\r\nNo doubt intemperance bears a large share of the blame for it; judging\r\nfrom the stand-point of the policeman perhaps the greater share. Two\r\nsuch entries as I read in the police returns on successive days last\r\nMarch, of mothers in West Side tenements, who, in their drunken sleep,\r\nlay upon and killed their infants, go far to support such a position.\r\nAnd they are far from uncommon. But my experience has shown me another\r\nview of it, a view which the last report of the Society for Improving\r\nthe Condition of the Poor seems more than half inclined to adopt in\r\nallotting to \"intemperance the cause of distress, or distress the cause\r\nof intemperance,\" forty per cent. of the cases it is called upon to\r\ndeal with. Even if it were all true, I should still load over upon the\r\ntenement the heaviest responsibility. A single factor, the scandalous\r\nscarcity of water in the hot summer when the thirst of the million\r\ntenants must be quenched, if not in that in something else, has in the\r\npast years more than all other causes encouraged drunkenness among the\r\npoor. But to my mind there is a closer connection between the wages\r\nof the tenements and the vices and improvidence of those who dwell\r\nin them than, with the guilt of the tenement upon our heads, we are\r\nwilling to admit even to ourselves. Weak tea with a dry crust is not\r\na diet to nurse moral strength. Yet how much better might the fare be\r\nexpected to be in the family of this \"widow with seven children, very\r\nenergetic and prudent\"--I quote again from the report of the Society\r\nfor the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor--whose \"eldest girl\r\nwas employed as a learner in a tailor's shop at small wages, and one\r\nboy had a place as 'cash' in a store. There were two other little boys\r\nwho sold papers and sometimes earned one dollar. The mother finishes\r\npantaloons and can do three pairs in a day, thus earning thirty-nine\r\ncents. Here is a family of eight persons with rent to pay and an income\r\nof less than six dollars a week.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet she was better off in point of pay than this Sixth Street\r\nmother, who \"had just brought home four pairs of pants to finish, at\r\nseven cents a pair. She was required to put the canvas in the bottom,\r\nbasting and sewing three times around; to put the linings in the\r\nwaist-bands; to tack three pockets, three corners to each; to put on\r\ntwo stays and eight buttons, and make six button-holes; to put the\r\nbuckle on the back strap and sew on the ticket, all for seven cents.\"\r\nBetter off than the \"church-going mother of six children,\" and with a\r\nhusband sick to death, who to support the family made shirts, averaging\r\nan income of one dollar and twenty cents a week, while her oldest girl,\r\naged thirteen, was \"employed down-town cutting out Hamburg edgings\r\nat one dollar and a half a week--two and a half cents per hour for\r\nten hours of steady labor--making the total income of the family two\r\ndollars and seventy cents per week.\" Than the Harlem woman, who was\r\n\"making a brave effort to support a sick husband and two children by\r\ntaking in washing at thirty-five cents for the lot of fourteen large\r\npieces, finding coal, soap, starch, and bluing herself, rather than\r\ndepend on charity in any form.\" Specimen wages of the tenements these,\r\nseemingly inconsistent with the charge of improvidence.\r\n\r\nBut the connection on second thought is not obscure. There is nothing\r\nin the prospect of a sharp, unceasing battle for the bare necessaries\r\nof life, to encourage looking ahead, everything to discourage the\r\neffort. Improvidence and wastefulness are natural results. The\r\ninstalment plan secures to the tenant who lives from hand to mouth his\r\nfew comforts; the evil day of reckoning is put off till a to-morrow\r\nthat may never come. When it does come, with failure to pay and the\r\nloss of hard-earned dollars, it simply adds another hardship to a life\r\nmeasured from the cradle by such incidents. The children soon catch\r\nthe spirit of this sort of thing. I remember once calling at the home\r\nof a poor washer-woman, living in an East Side tenement, and finding\r\nthe door locked. Some children in the hallway stopped their play and\r\neyed me attentively while I knocked. The biggest girl volunteered the\r\ninformation that Mrs. Smith was out; but while I was thinking of how\r\nI was to get a message to her, the child put a question of her own:\r\n\"Are you the spring man or the clock man?\" When I assured her that I\r\nwas neither one nor the other, but had brought work for her mother,\r\nMrs. Smith, who had been hiding from the instalment collector, speedily\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all the disheartening experiences of those who have devoted\r\nlives of unselfish thought and effort, and their number is not so\r\nsmall as often supposed, to the lifting of this great load, the\r\nindifference of those they would help is the most puzzling. They will\r\nnot be helped. Dragged by main force out of their misery, they slip\r\nback again on the first opportunity, seemingly content only in the\r\nold rut. The explanation was supplied by two women of my acquaintance\r\nin an Elizabeth Street tenement, whom the city missionaries had taken\r\nfrom their wretched hovel and provided with work and a decent home\r\nsomewhere in New Jersey. In three weeks they were back, saying that\r\nthey preferred their dark rear room to the stumps out in the country.\r\nBut to me the oldest, the mother, who had struggled along with her\r\ndaughter making cloaks at half a dollar apiece, twelve long years since\r\nthe daughter's husband was killed in a street accident and the city\r\ntook the children, made the bitter confession: \"We do get so kind o'\r\ndownhearted living this way, that we have to be where something is\r\ngoing on, or we just can't stand it.\" And there was sadder pathos to\r\nme in her words than in the whole long story of their struggle with\r\npoverty; for unconsciously she voiced the sufferings of thousands,\r\nmisjudged by a happier world, deemed vicious because they are human and\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular delusion, encouraged by all sorts of exaggerated\r\nstories when nothing more exciting demands public attention, that\r\nthere are more evictions in the tenements of New York every year \"than\r\nin all Ireland.\" I am not sure that it is doing much for the tenant\r\nto upset this fallacy. To my mind, to be put out of a tenement would\r\nbe the height of good luck. The fact is, however, that evictions are\r\nnot nearly as common in New York as supposed. The reason is that in\r\nthe civil courts, the judges of which are elected in their districts,\r\nthe tenant-voter has solid ground to stand upon at last. The law that\r\ntakes his side to start with is usually twisted to the utmost to give\r\nhim time and save him expense. In the busiest East Side court, that\r\nhas been very appropriately dubbed the \"Poor Man's Court,\" fully five\r\nthousand dispossess warrants are issued in a year, but probably not\r\nfifty evictions take place in the district. The landlord has only one\r\nvote, while there may be forty voters hiring his rooms in the house,\r\nall of which the judge takes into careful account as elements that have\r\na direct bearing on the case. And so they have--on his case. There\r\nare sad cases, just as there are \"rounders\" who prefer to be moved at\r\nthe landlord's expense and save the rent, but the former at least are\r\nunusual enough to attract more than their share of attention.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DISPOSSESSED.]\r\n\r\nIf his very poverty compels the tenant to live at a rate if not in a\r\nstyle that would beggar a Vanderbilt, paying four prices for everything\r\nhe needs, from his rent and coal down to the smallest item in his\r\nhousekeeping account, fashion, no less inexorable in the tenements\r\nthan on the avenue, exacts of him that he must die in a style that is\r\nfinally and utterly ruinous. The habit of expensive funerals--I know\r\nof no better classification for it than along with the opium habit\r\nand similar grievous plagues of mankind--is a distinctively Irish\r\ninheritance, but it has taken root among all classes of tenement\r\ndwellers, curiously enough most firmly among the Italians, who have\r\ntaken amazingly to the funeral coach, perhaps because it furnishes\r\nthe one opportunity of their lives for a really grand turn-out with a\r\nfree ride thrown in. It is not at all uncommon to find the hoards of\r\na whole lifetime of hard work and self denial squandered on the empty\r\nshow of a ludicrous funeral parade and a display of flowers that ill\r\ncomports with the humble life it is supposed to exalt. It is easier to\r\nunderstand the wake as a sort of consolation cup for the survivors for\r\nwhom there is--as one of them, doubtless a heathenish pessimist, put it\r\nto me once--\"no such luck.\" The press and the pulpit have denounced the\r\nwasteful practice that often entails bitter want upon the relatives of\r\nthe one buried with such pomp, but with little or no apparent result.\r\nRather, the undertaker's business prospers more than ever in the\r\ntenements since the genius of politics has seen its way clear to make\r\ncapital out of the dead voter as well as of the living, by making him\r\nthe means of a useful \"show of strength\" and count of noses.\r\n\r\nOne free excursion awaits young and old whom bitter poverty has denied\r\nthe poor privilege of the choice of the home in death they were denied\r\nin life, the ride up the Sound to the Potter's Field, charitably styled\r\nthe City Cemetery. But even there they do not escape their fate. In\r\nthe common trench of the Poor Burying Ground they lie packed three\r\nstories deep, shoulder to shoulder, crowded in death as they were in\r\nlife, to \"save space;\" for even on that desert island the ground is\r\nnot for the exclusive possession of those who cannot afford to pay\r\nfor it. There is an odd coincidence in this, that year by year the\r\nlives that are begun in the gutter, the little nameless waifs whom the\r\npolice pick up and the city adopts as its wards, are balanced by the\r\neven more forlorn lives that are ended in the river. I do not know how\r\nor why it happens, or that it is more than a mere coincidence. But\r\nthere it is. Year by year the balance is struck--a few more, a few\r\nless--substantially the same when the record is closed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE TRENCH IN THE POTTER'S FIELD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                      THE PROBLEM OF THE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the children becomes, in these swarms, to the last\r\ndegree perplexing. Their very number make one stand aghast. I have\r\nalready given instances of the packing of the child population in East\r\nSide tenements. They might be continued indefinitely until the array\r\nwould be enough to startle any community. For, be it remembered, these\r\nchildren with the training they receive--or do not receive--with the\r\ninstincts they inherit and absorb in their growing up, are to be our\r\nfuture rulers, if our theory of government is worth anything. More\r\nthan a working majority of our voters now register from the tenements.\r\nI counted the other day the little ones, up to ten years or so, in a\r\nBayard Street tenement that for a yard has a triangular space in the\r\ncentre with sides fourteen or fifteen feet long, just room enough\r\nfor a row of ill-smelling closets at the base of the triangle and a\r\nhydrant at the apex. There was about as much light in this \"yard\"\r\nas in the average cellar. I gave up my self-imposed task in despair\r\nwhen I had counted one hundred and twenty-eight in forty families.\r\nThirteen I had missed, or not found in. Applying the average for the\r\nforty to the whole fifty-three, the house contained one hundred and\r\nseventy children. It is not the only time I have had to give up such\r\ncensus work. I have in mind an alley--an inlet rather to a row of rear\r\ntenements--that is either two or four feet wide according as the wall\r\nof the crazy old building that gives on it bulges out or in. I tried\r\nto count the children that swarmed there, but could not. Sometimes I\r\nhave doubted that anybody knows just how many there are about. Bodies\r\nof drowned children turn up in the rivers right along in summer whom\r\nno one seems to know anything about. When last spring some workmen,\r\nwhile moving a pile of lumber on a North River pier, found under the\r\nlast plank the body of a little lad crushed to death, no one had missed\r\na boy, though his parents afterward turned up. The truant officer\r\nassuredly does not know, though he spends his life trying to find out,\r\nsomewhat illogically, perhaps, since the department that employs him\r\nadmits that thousands of poor children are crowded out of the schools\r\nyear by year for want of room. There was a big tenement in the Sixth\r\nWard, now happily appropriated by the beneficent spirit of business\r\nthat blots out so many foul spots in New York--it figured not long ago\r\nin the official reports as \"an out-and-out hog-pen\"--that had a record\r\nof one hundred and two arrests in four years among its four hundred and\r\nseventy-eight tenants, fifty-seven of them for drunken and disorderly\r\nconduct. I do not know how many children there were in it, but the\r\ninspector reported that he found only seven in the whole house who\r\nowned that they went to school. The rest gathered all the instruction\r\nthey received running for beer for their elders. Some of them claimed\r\nthe \"flat\" as their home as a mere matter of form. They slept in\r\nthe streets at night. The official came upon a little party of four\r\ndrinking beer out of the cover of a milk-can in the hallway. They were\r\nof the seven good boys and proved their claim to the title by offering\r\nhim some.\r\n\r\nThe old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious\r\nphase in the tenements. Under the best conditions found there, it\r\nis not easily answered. In nine cases out of ten he would make an\r\nexcellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is\r\nneither dull nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades\r\nunions has practically closed that avenue to him. Trade-schools,\r\nhowever excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him, and\r\nat the outset the boy stands condemned by his own to low and ill-paid\r\ndrudgery, held down by the hand that of all should labor to raise him.\r\nHome, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means\r\nnothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other\r\nhuman animals. Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it\r\nhave any. The very games at which he takes a hand in the street become\r\npolluting in its atmosphere. With no steady hand to guide him, the\r\nboy takes naturally to idle ways. Caught in the street by the truant\r\nofficer, or by the agents of the Children's Societies, peddling,\r\nperhaps, or begging, to help out the family resources, he runs the\r\nrisk of being sent to a reformatory, where contact with vicious boys\r\nolder than himself soon develop the latent possibilities for evil that\r\nlie hidden in him. The city has no Truant Home in which to keep him,\r\nand all efforts of the children's friends to enforce school attendance\r\nare paralyzed by this want. The risk of the reformatory is too great.\r\nWhat is done in the end is to let him take chances--with the chances\r\nall against him. The result is the rough young savage, familiar from\r\nthe street. Rough as he is, if any one doubt that this child of common\r\nclay have in him the instinct of beauty, of love for the ideal of which\r\nhis life has no embodiment, let him put the matter to the test. Let\r\nhim take into a tenement block a handful of flowers from the fields\r\nand watch the brightened faces, the sudden abandonment of play and\r\nfight that go ever hand in hand where there is no elbow-room, the wild\r\nentreaty for \"posies,\" the eager love with which the little messengers\r\nof peace are shielded, once possessed; then let him change his mind. I\r\nhave seen an armful of daisies keep the peace of a block better than\r\na policeman and his club, seen instincts awaken under their gentle\r\nappeal, whose very existence the soil in which they grew made seem a\r\nmockery. I have not forgotten the deputation of ragamuffins from a\r\nMulberry Street alley that knocked at my office door one morning on\r\na mysterious expedition for flowers, not for themselves, but for \"a\r\nlady,\" and having obtained what they wanted, trooped off to bestow\r\nthem, a ragged and dirty little band, with a solemnity that was quite\r\nunusual. It was not until an old man called the next day to thank me\r\nfor the flowers that I found out they had decked the bier of a pauper,\r\nin the dark rear room where she lay waiting in her pine-board coffin\r\nfor the city's hearse. Yet, as I knew, that dismal alley with its bare\r\nbrick walls, between which no sun ever rose or set, was the world of\r\nthose children. It filled their young lives. Probably not one of them\r\nhad ever been out of the sight of it. They were too dirty, too ragged,\r\nand too generally disreputable, too well hidden in their slum besides,\r\nto come into line with the Fresh Air summer boarders.\r\n\r\nWith such human instincts and cravings, forever unsatisfied, turned\r\ninto a haunting curse; with appetite ground to keenest edge by a hunger\r\nthat is never fed, the children of the poor grow up in joyless homes\r\nto lives of wearisome toil that claims them at an age when the play of\r\ntheir happier fellows has but just begun. Has a yard of turf been laid\r\nand a vine been coaxed to grow within their reach, they are banished\r\nand barred out from it as from a heaven that is not for such as they.\r\nI came upon a couple of youngsters in a Mulberry Street yard a while\r\nago that were chalking on the fence their first lesson in \"writin'.\"\r\nAnd this is what they wrote: \"Keeb of te Grass.\" They had it by heart,\r\nfor there was not, I verily believe, a green sod within a quarter of\r\na mile. Home to them is an empty name. Pleasure? A gentleman once\r\ncatechized a ragged class in a down-town public school on this point,\r\nand recorded the result: Out of forty-eight boys twenty had never seen\r\nthe Brooklyn Bridge that was scarcely five minutes' walk away, three\r\nonly had been in Central Park, fifteen had known the joy of a ride in\r\na horse-car. The street, with its ash-barrels and its dirt, the river\r\nthat runs foul with mud, are their domain. What training they receive\r\nis picked up there. And they are apt pupils. If the mud and the dirt\r\nare easily reflected in their lives, what wonder? Scarce half-grown,\r\nsuch lads as these confront the world with the challenge to give them\r\ntheir due, too long withheld, or----. Our jails supply the answer to\r\nthe alternative.\r\n\r\nA little fellow who seemed clad in but a single rag was among the\r\nflotsam and jetsam stranded at Police Headquarters one day last\r\nsummer. No one knew where he came from or where he belonged. The boy\r\nhimself knew as little about it as anybody, and was the least anxious\r\nto have light shed on the subject after he had spent a night in the\r\nmatron's nursery. The discovery that beds were provided for boys to\r\nsleep in there, and that he could have \"a whole egg\" and three slices\r\nof bread for breakfast put him on the best of terms with the world in\r\ngeneral, and he decided that Headquarters was \"a bully place.\" He sang\r\n\"McGinty\" all through, with Tenth Avenue variations, for the police,\r\nand then settled down to the serious business of giving an account of\r\nhimself. The examination went on after this fashion:\r\n\r\n\"Where do you go to church, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't have no clothes to go to church.\" And indeed his appearance,\r\nas he was, in the door of any New York church would have caused a\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, where do you go to school, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't go to school,\" with a snort of contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you buy your bread?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't buy no bread; we buy beer,\" said the boy, and it was\r\neventually the saloon that led the police as a landmark to his \"home.\"\r\nIt was worthy of the boy. As he had said, his only bed was a heap\r\nof dirty straw on the floor, his daily diet a crust in the morning,\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nInto the rooms of the Children's Aid Society were led two little girls\r\nwhose father had \"busted up the house\" and put them on the street after\r\ntheir mother died. Another, who was turned out by her step-mother\r\n\"because she had five of her own and could not afford to keep her,\"\r\ncould not remember ever having been in church or Sunday-school, and\r\nonly knew the name of Jesus through hearing people swear by it. She had\r\nno idea what they meant. These were specimens of the overflow from the\r\ntenements of our home-heathen that are growing up in New York's streets\r\nto-day, while tender-hearted men and women are busying themselves with\r\nthe socks and the hereafter of well-fed little Hottentots thousands of\r\nmiles away. According to Canon Taylor, of York, one hundred and nine\r\nmissionaries in the four fields of Persia, Palestine, Arabia, and Egypt\r\nspent one year and sixty thousand dollars in converting one little\r\nheathen girl. If there is nothing the matter with those missionaries,\r\nthey might come to New York with a good deal better prospect of success.\r\n\r\nBy those who lay flattering unction to their souls in the knowledge\r\nthat to-day New York has, at all events, no brood of the gutters\r\nof tender years that can be homeless long unheeded, let it be\r\nremembered well through what effort this judgment has been averted. In\r\nthirty-seven years the Children's Aid Society, that came into existence\r\nas an emphatic protest against the tenement corruption of the young,\r\nhas sheltered quite three hundred thousand outcast, homeless, and\r\norphaned children in its lodging-houses, and has found homes in the\r\nWest for seventy thousand that had none. Doubtless, as a mere stroke\r\nof finance, the five millions and a half thus spent were a wiser\r\ninvestment than to have let them grow up thieves and thugs. In the last\r\nfifteen years of this tireless battle for the safety of the State the\r\nintervention of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children\r\nhas been invoked for 138,891 little ones: it has thrown its protection\r\naround more than twenty-five thousand helpless children, and has\r\nconvicted nearly sixteen thousand wretches of child-beating and abuse.\r\nAdd to this the standing army of fifteen thousand dependent children\r\nin New York's asylums and institutions, and some idea is gained of the\r\ncrop that is garnered day by day in the tenements, of the enormous\r\nforce employed to check their inroads on our social life, and of the\r\ncause for apprehension that would exist did their efforts flag for ever\r\nso brief a time.\r\n\r\nNothing is now better understood than that the rescue of the children\r\nis the key to the problem of city poverty, as presented for our\r\nsolution to-day: that character may be formed where to reform it would\r\nbe a hopeless task. The concurrent testimony of all who have to\r\nundertake it at a later stage: that the young are naturally neither\r\nvicious nor hardened, simply weak and undeveloped, except by the bad\r\ninfluences of the street, makes this duty all the more urgent as well\r\nas hopeful. Helping hands are held out on every side. To private\r\ncharity the municipality leaves the entire care of its proletariat\r\nof tender years, lulling its conscience to sleep with liberal\r\nappropriations of money to foot the bills. Indeed, it is held by those\r\nwhose opinions are entitled to weight that it is far too liberal a\r\npaymaster for its own best interests and those of its wards. It deals\r\nwith the evil in the seed to a limited extent in gathering in the\r\noutcast babies from the streets. To the ripe fruit the gates of its\r\nprisons, its reformatories, and its workhouses are opened wide the year\r\nround. What the showing would be at this end of the line were it not\r\nfor the barriers wise charity has thrown across the broad highway to\r\nruin--is building day by day--may be measured by such results as those\r\nquoted above in the span of a single life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                       WAIFS OF THE CITY'S SLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst among these barriers is the Foundling Asylum. It stands at the\r\nvery outset of the waste of life that goes on in a population of nearly\r\ntwo millions of people; powerless to prevent it, though it gather\r\nin the outcasts by night and by day. In a score of years an army of\r\ntwenty-five thousand of these forlorn little waifs have cried out from\r\nthe streets of New York in arraignment of a Christian civilization\r\nunder the blessings of which the instinct of motherhood even was\r\nsmothered by poverty and want. Only the poor abandon their children.\r\nThe stories of richly-dressed foundlings that are dished up in the\r\nnewspapers at intervals are pure fiction. Not one instance of even a\r\nwell-dressed infant having been picked up in the streets is on record.\r\nThey come in rags, a newspaper often the only wrap, semi-occasionally\r\none in a clean slip with some evidence of loving care; a little slip of\r\npaper pinned on, perhaps, with some such message as this I once read,\r\nin a woman's trembling hand: \"Take care of Johnny, for God's sake. I\r\ncannot.\" But even that is the rarest of all happenings.\r\n\r\nThe city divides with the Sisters of Charity the task of gathering them\r\nin. The real foundlings, the children of the gutter that are picked\r\nup by the police, are the city's wards. In midwinter, when the poor\r\nshiver in their homes, and in the dog-days when the fierce heat and\r\nfoul air of the tenements smother their babies by thousands, they\r\nare found, sometimes three and four in a night, in hallways, in areas\r\nand on the doorsteps of the rich, with whose comfort in luxurious\r\nhomes the wretched mother somehow connects her own misery. Perhaps,\r\nas the drowning man clutches at a straw, she hopes that these happier\r\nhearts may have love to spare even for her little one. In this she is\r\nmistaken. Unauthorized babies especially are not popular in the abodes\r\nof the wealthy. It never happens outside of the story-books that a baby\r\nso deserted finds home and friends at once. Its career, though rather\r\nmore official, is less romantic, and generally brief. After a night\r\nspent at Police Headquarters it travels up to the Infants' Hospital on\r\nRandall's Island in the morning, fitted out with a number and a bottle,\r\nthat seldom see much wear before they are laid aside for a fresh\r\nrecruit. Few outcast babies survive their desertion long. Murder is\r\nthe true name of the mother's crime in eight cases out of ten. Of 508\r\nbabies received at the Randall's Island Hospital last year 333 died,\r\n65.55 per cent. But of the 508 only 170 were picked up in the streets,\r\nand among these the mortality was much greater, probably nearer ninety\r\nper cent., if the truth were told. The rest were born in the hospitals.\r\nThe high mortality among the foundlings is not to be marvelled at.\r\nThe wonder is, rather, that any survive. The stormier the night, the\r\nmore certain is the police nursery to echo with the feeble cries of\r\nabandoned babes. Often they come half dead from exposure. One live baby\r\ncame in a little pine coffin which a policeman found an inhuman wretch\r\ntrying to bury in an up-town lot. But many do not live to be officially\r\nregistered as a charge upon the county. Seventy-two dead babies were\r\npicked up in the streets last year. Some of them were doubtless put\r\nout by very poor parents to save funeral expenses. In hard times the\r\nnumber of dead and live foundlings always increases very noticeably.\r\nBut whether travelling by way of the Morgue or the Infants' Hospital,\r\nthe little army of waifs meets, reunited soon, in the trench in the\r\nPotter's Field where, if no medical student is in need of a subject,\r\nthey are laid in squads of a dozen.\r\n\r\nMost of the foundlings come from the East Side, where they are left by\r\nyoung mothers without wedding-rings or other name than their own to\r\nbestow upon the baby, returning from the island hospital to face an\r\nunpitying world with the evidence of their shame. Not infrequently they\r\nwear the bed-tick regimentals of the Public Charities, and thus their\r\norigin is easily enough traced. Oftener no ray of light penetrates the\r\ngloom, and no effort is made to probe the mystery of sin and sorrow.\r\nThis also is the policy pursued in the great Foundling Asylum of the\r\nSisters of Charity in Sixty-eighth Street, known all over the world\r\nas Sister Irene's Asylum. Years ago the crib that now stands just\r\ninside the street door, under the great main portal, was placed outside\r\nat night; but it filled up too rapidly. The babies took to coming\r\nin little squads instead of in single file, and in self-defence the\r\nsisters were forced to take the cradle in. Now the mother must bring\r\nher child inside and put it in the crib where she is seen by the sister\r\non guard. No effort is made to question her, or discover the child's\r\nantecedents, but she is asked to stay and nurse her own and another\r\nbaby. If she refuses, she is allowed to depart unhindered. If willing,\r\nshe enters at once into the great family of the good Sister who in\r\ntwenty-one years has gathered as many thousand homeless babies into her\r\nfold. One was brought in when I was last in the asylum, in the middle\r\nof July, that received in its crib the number 20715. The death-rate is\r\nof course lowered a good deal where exposure of the child is prevented.\r\nAmong the eleven hundred infants in the asylum it was something over\r\nnineteen per cent. last year; but among those actually received in the\r\ntwelvemonth nearer twice that figure. Even the nineteen per cent.,\r\nremarkably low for a Foundling Asylum, was equal to the startling\r\ndeath-rate of Gotham Court in the cholera scourge.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and sixty mothers, who could not or would not keep their\r\nown babies, did voluntary penance for their sin in the asylum last\r\nyear by nursing a strange waif besides their own until both should be\r\nstrong enough to take their chances in life's battle. An even larger\r\nnumber than the eleven hundred were \"pay babies,\" put out to be nursed\r\nby \"mothers\" outside the asylum. The money thus earned pays the rent of\r\nhundreds of poor families. It is no trifle, quite half of the quarter\r\nof a million dollars contributed annually by the city for the support\r\nof the asylum. The procession of these nurse-mothers, when they come to\r\nthe asylum on the first Wednesday of each month to receive their pay\r\nand have the babies inspected by the sisters, is one of the sights of\r\nthe city. The nurses, who are under strict supervision, grow to love\r\ntheir little charges and part from them with tears when, at the age of\r\nfour or five, they are sent to Western homes to be adopted. The sisters\r\ncarefully encourage the home-feeling in the child as their strongest\r\nally in seeking its mental and moral elevation, and the toddlers depart\r\nhappy to join their \"papas and mammas\" in the far-away, unknown home.\r\n\r\nAn infinitely more fiendish, if to surface appearances less\r\ndeliberate, plan of child-murder than desertion has flourished in New\r\nYork for years under the title of baby-farming. The name, put into\r\nplain English, means starving babies to death. The law has fought this\r\nmost heinous of crimes by compelling the registry of all baby-farms.\r\nAs well might it require all persons intending murder to register\r\ntheir purpose with time and place of the deed under the penalty of\r\nexemplary fines. Murderers do not hang out a shingle. \"Baby-farms,\"\r\nsaid once Mr. Elbridge T. Gerry, the President of the Society charged\r\nwith the execution of the law that was passed through his efforts, \"are\r\nconcerns by means of which persons, usually of disreputable character,\r\neke out a living by taking two, or three, or four babies to board.\r\nThey are the charges of outcasts, or illegitimate children. They feed\r\nthem on sour milk, and give them paregoric to keep them quiet, until\r\nthey die, when they get some young medical man without experience\r\nto sign a certificate to the Board of Health that the child died of\r\ninanition, and so the matter ends. The baby is dead, and there is no\r\none to complain.\" A handful of baby-farms have been registered and\r\nlicensed by the Board of Health with the approval of the Society for\r\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Children in the last five years, but none\r\nof this kind. The devil keeps the only complete register to be found\r\nanywhere. Their trace is found oftenest by the coroner or the police;\r\nsometimes they may be discovered hiding in the advertising columns of\r\ncertain newspapers, under the guise of the scarcely less heartless\r\ntraffic in helpless children that is dignified with the pretence of\r\nadoption--for cash. An idea of how this scheme works was obtained\r\nthrough the disclosures in a celebrated divorce case, a year or two\r\nago. The society has among its records a very recent case[18] of a\r\nbaby a week old (Baby \"Blue Eyes\") that was offered for sale--adoption,\r\nthe dealer called it--in a newspaper. The agent bought it after some\r\nhaggling for a dollar, and arrested the woman slave-trader; but the law\r\nwas powerless to punish her for her crime. Twelve unfortunate women\r\nawaiting dishonored motherhood were found in her house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Case\r\n42,028, May 16, 1889.]\r\n\r\nOne gets a glimpse of the frightful depths to which human nature,\r\nperverted by avarice bred of ignorance and rasping poverty, can\r\ndescend, in the mere suggestion of systematic insurance _for profit_\r\nof children's lives. A woman was put on trial in this city last year\r\nfor incredible cruelty in her treatment of a step-child. The evidence\r\naroused a strong suspicion that a pitifully small amount of insurance\r\non the child's life was one of the motives for the woman's savagery.\r\nA little investigation brought out the fact that three companies that\r\nwere in the business of insuring children's lives, for sums varying\r\nfrom $17 up, had issued not less than a million such policies! The\r\npremiums ranged from five to twenty-five cents a week. What untold\r\nhorrors this business may conceal was suggested by a formal agreement\r\nentered into by some of the companies, \"for the purpose of preventing\r\nspeculation in the insurance of children's lives.\" By the terms of\r\nthis compact, \"no higher premium than ten cents could be accepted on\r\nchildren under six years old.\" Barbarism forsooth! Did ever heathen\r\ncruelty invent a more fiendish plot than the one written down between\r\nthe lines of this legal paper?\r\n\r\nIt is with a sense of glad relief that one turns from this misery to\r\nthe brighter page of the helping hands stretched forth on every side\r\nto save the young and the helpless. New York is, I firmly believe,\r\nthe most charitable city in the world. Nowhere is there so eager a\r\nreadiness to help, when it is known that help is worthily wanted;\r\nnowhere are such armies of devoted workers, nowhere such abundance of\r\nmeans ready to the hand of those who know the need and how rightly to\r\nsupply it. Its poverty, its slums, and its suffering are the result of\r\nunprecedented growth with the consequent disorder and crowding, and the\r\ncommon penalty of metropolitan greatness. If the structure shows signs\r\nof being top-heavy, evidences are not wanting--they are multiplying day\r\nby day--that patient toilers are at work among the underpinnings. The\r\nDay Nurseries, the numberless Kindergartens and charitable schools in\r\nthe poor quarters, the Fresh Air Funds, the thousand and one charities\r\nthat in one way or another reach the homes and the lives of the poor\r\nwith sweetening touch, are proof that if much is yet to be done, if the\r\nneed only grows with the effort, hearts and hands will be found to do\r\nit in ever-increasing measure. Black as the cloud is it has a silver\r\nlining, bright with promise. New York is to-day a hundredfold cleaner,\r\nbetter, purer, city than it was even ten years ago.\r\n\r\nTwo powerful agents that were among the pioneers in this work of moral\r\nand physical regeneration stand in Paradise Park to-day as milestones\r\non the rocky, uphill road. The handful of noble women, who braved\r\nthe foul depravity of the Old Brewery to rescue its child victims,\r\nrolled away the first and heaviest bowlder, which legislatures and\r\ncity councils had tackled in vain. The Five Points Mission and the\r\nFive Points House of Industry have accomplished what no machinery of\r\ngovernment availed to do. Sixty thousand children have been rescued\r\nby them from the streets and had their little feet set in the better\r\nway. Their work still goes on, increasing and gathering in the waifs,\r\ninstructing and feeding them, and helping their parents with advice and\r\nmore substantial aid. Their charity knows not creed or nationality.\r\nThe House of Industry is an enormous nursery-school with an average of\r\nmore than four hundred day scholars and constant boarders--\"outsiders\"\r\nand \"insiders.\" Its influence is felt for many blocks around in that\r\ncrowded part of the city. It is one of the most touching sights in\r\nthe world to see a score of babies, rescued from homes of brutality\r\nand desolation, where no other blessing than a drunken curse was ever\r\nheard, saying their prayers in the nursery at bedtime. Too often their\r\nwhite night-gowns hide tortured little bodies and limbs cruelly bruised\r\nby inhuman hands. In the shelter of this fold they are safe, and a\r\nhappier little group one may seek long and far in vain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PRAYER-TIME IN THE NURSERY--FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF\r\n                 INDUSTRY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                            THE STREET ARAB.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all the barriers erected by society against its nether life, not\r\nthe labor of unnumbered societies for the rescue and relief of its\r\noutcast waifs, can dam the stream of homelessness that issues from a\r\nsource where the very name of home is a mockery. The Street Arab is\r\nas much of an institution in New York as Newspaper Row, to which he\r\ngravitates naturally, following his Bohemian instinct. Crowded out\r\nof the tenements to shift for himself, and quite ready to do it, he\r\nmeets there the host of adventurous runaways from every State in the\r\nUnion and from across the sea, whom New York attracts with a queer\r\nfascination, as it attracts the older emigrants from all parts of the\r\nworld. A census of the population in the Newsboys' Lodging-house on any\r\nnight will show such an odd mixture of small humanity as could hardly\r\nbe got together in any other spot. It is a mistake to think that they\r\nare helpless little creatures, to be pitied and cried over because they\r\nare alone in the world. The unmerciful \"guying\" the good man would\r\nreceive, who went to them with such a programme, would soon convince\r\nhim that that sort of pity was wasted, and would very likely give him\r\nthe idea that they were a set of hardened little scoundrels, quite\r\nbeyond the reach of missionary effort.\r\n\r\nBut that would only be his second mistake. The Street Arab has all the\r\nfaults and all the virtues of the lawless life he leads. Vagabond that\r\nhe is, acknowledging no authority and owing no allegiance to anybody or\r\nanything, with his grimy fist raised against society whenever it tries\r\nto coerce him, he is as bright and sharp as the weasel, which, among\r\nall the predatory beasts, he most resembles. His sturdy independence,\r\nlove of freedom and absolute self-reliance, together with his rude\r\nsense of justice that enables him to govern his little community, not\r\nalways in accordance with municipal law or city ordinances, but often\r\na good deal closer to the saving line of \"doing to others as one would\r\nbe done by\"--these are strong handles by which those who know how can\r\ncatch the boy and make him useful. Successful bankers, clergymen, and\r\nlawyers all over the country, statesmen in some instances of national\r\nrepute, bear evidence in their lives to the potency of such missionary\r\nefforts. There is scarcely a learned profession, or branch of honorable\r\nbusiness, that has not in the last twenty years borrowed some of its\r\nbrightest light from the poverty and gloom of New York's streets.\r\n\r\nAnyone, whom business or curiosity has taken through Park Row or across\r\nPrinting House Square in the midnight hour, when the air is filled with\r\nthe roar of great presses spinning with printers' ink on endless rolls\r\nof white paper the history of the world in the twenty-four hours that\r\nhave just passed away, has seen little groups of these boys hanging\r\nabout the newspaper offices; in winter, when snow is on the streets,\r\nfighting for warm spots around the grated vent-holes that let out\r\nthe heat and steam from the underground press-rooms with their noise\r\nand clatter, and in summer playing craps and 7-11 on the curb for\r\ntheir hard-earned pennies, with all the absorbing concern of hardened\r\ngamblers. This is their beat. Here the agent of the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children finds those he thinks too young for\r\n\"business,\" but does not always capture them. Like rabbits in their\r\nburrows, the little ragamuffins sleep with at least one eye open,\r\nand every sense alert to the approach of danger: of their enemy, the\r\npoliceman, whose chief business in life is to move them on, and of the\r\nagent bent on robbing them of their cherished freedom. At the first\r\nwarning shout they scatter and are off. To pursue them would be like\r\nchasing the fleet-footed mountain goat in his rocky fastnesses. There\r\nis not an open door, a hidden turn or runway which they do not know,\r\nwith lots of secret passages and short cuts no one else ever found.\r\nTo steal a march on them is the only way. There is a coal chute from\r\nthe sidewalk to the boiler-room in the sub-cellar of the Post Office\r\nwhich the Society's officer found the boys had made into a sort of\r\ntoboggan slide to a snug berth in wintry weather. They used to slyly\r\nraise the cover in the street, slide down in single file, and snuggle\r\nup to the warm boiler out of harm's way, as they thought. It proved a\r\ntrap, however. The agent slid down himself one cold night--there was\r\nno other way of getting there--and, landing right in the midst of the\r\nsleeping colony, had it at his mercy. After repeated raids upon their\r\nheadquarters, the boys forsook it last summer, and were next found\r\nherding under the shore-end of one of the East River banana docks,\r\nwhere they had fitted up a regular club-room that was shared by thirty\r\nor forty homeless boys and about a million rats.\r\n\r\nNewspaper Row is merely their headquarters. They are to be found all\r\nover the city, these Street Arabs, where the neighborhood offers a\r\nchance of picking up a living in the daytime and of \"turning in\"\r\nat night with a promise of security from surprise. In warm weather\r\na truck in the street, a convenient out-house, or a dug-out in a\r\nhay-barge at the wharf make good bunks. Two were found making their\r\nnest once in the end of a big iron pipe up by the Harlem Bridge,\r\nand an old boiler at the East River served as an elegant flat for\r\nanother couple, who kept house there with a thief the police had long\r\nsought, little suspecting that he was hiding under their very noses\r\nfor months together. When the Children's Aid Society first opened\r\nits lodging-houses, and with some difficulty persuaded the boys that\r\ntheir charity was no \"pious dodge\" to trap them into a treasonable\r\n\"Sunday-school racket,\" its managers overheard a laughable discussion\r\namong the boys in their unwontedly comfortable beds--perhaps the first\r\nsome of them had ever slept in--as to the relative merits of the\r\ndifferent styles of their everyday berths. Preferences were divided\r\nbetween the steam-grating and a sand-box; but the weight of the\r\nevidence was decided to be in favor of the sand-box, because, as its\r\nadvocate put it, \"you could curl all up in it.\" The new \"find\" was\r\nvoted a good way ahead of any previous experience, however. \"My eyes,\r\nain't it nice!\" said one of the lads, tucked in under his blanket up\r\nto the chin, and the roomful of boys echoed the sentiment. The compact\r\nsilently made that night between the Street Arabs and their hosts has\r\nnever been broken. They have been fast friends ever since.\r\n\r\nWhence this army of homeless boys? is a question often asked. The\r\nanswer is supplied by the procession of mothers that go out and in at\r\nPolice Headquarters the year round, inquiring for missing boys, often\r\nnot until they have been gone for weeks and months, and then sometimes\r\nrather as a matter of decent form than from any real interest in the\r\nlad's fate. The stereotyped promise of the clerks who fail to find\r\nhis name on the books among the arrests, that he \"will come back when\r\nhe gets hungry,\" does not always come true. More likely he went away\r\nbecause he was hungry. Some are orphans, actually or in effect, thrown\r\nupon the world when their parents were \"sent up\" to the island or to\r\nSing Sing, and somehow overlooked by the \"Society,\" which thenceforth\r\nbecame the enemy to be shunned until growth and dirt and the hardships\r\nof the street, that make old early, offer some hope of successfully\r\nfloating the lie that they are \"sixteen.\" A drunken father explains\r\nthe matter in other cases, as in that of John and Willie, aged ten\r\nand eight, picked up by the police. They \"didn't live nowhere,\" never\r\nwent to school, could neither read nor write. Their twelve-year-old\r\nsister kept house for the father, who turned the boys out to beg, or\r\nsteal, or starve. Grinding poverty and hard work beyond the years of\r\nthe lad; blows and curses for breakfast, dinner, and supper; all these\r\nare recruiting agents for the homeless army. Sickness in the house, too\r\nmany mouths to feed:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"DIDN'T LIVE NOWHERE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"We wuz six,\" said an urchin of twelve or thirteen I came across in the\r\nNewsboys' Lodging House, \"and we ain't got no father. Some on us had\r\nto go.\" And so he went, to make a living by blacking boots. The going\r\nis easy enough. There is very little to hold the boy who has never\r\nknown anything but a home in a tenement. Very soon the wild life in\r\nthe streets holds him fast, and thenceforward by his own effort there\r\nis no escape. Left alone to himself, he soon enough finds a place in\r\nthe police books, and there would be no other answer to the second\r\nquestion: \"what becomes of the boy?\" than that given by the criminal\r\ncourts every day in the week.\r\n\r\nBut he is not left alone. Society in our day has no such suicidal\r\nintention. Right here, at the parting of the ways, it has thrown up\r\nthe strongest of all its defences for itself and for the boy. What\r\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is to the\r\nbaby-waif, the Children's Aid Society is to the homeless boy at this\r\nreal turning-point in his career. The good it has done cannot easily\r\nbe over-estimated. Its lodging-houses, its schools and its homes block\r\nevery avenue of escape with their offer of shelter upon terms which\r\nthe boy soon accepts, as on the whole cheap and fair. In the great\r\nDuane Street lodging-house for newsboys, they are succinctly stated\r\nin a \"notice\" over the door that reads thus: \"Boys who swear and chew\r\ntobacco cannot sleep here.\" There is another unwritten condition, viz.:\r\nthat the boy shall be really without a home; but upon this the managers\r\nwisely do not insist too obstinately, accepting without too close\r\ninquiry his account of himself where that seems advisable, well knowing\r\nthat many a home that sends forth such lads far less deserves the name\r\nthan the one they are able to give them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STREET ARABS IN SLEEPING QUARTERS.]\r\n\r\nWith these simple preliminaries the outcast boy may enter. Rags do\r\nnot count; to ignorance the door is only opened wider. Dirt does not\r\nsurvive long, once within the walls of the lodging-house. It is the\r\nsettled belief of the men who conduct them that soap and water are as\r\npowerful moral agents in their particular field as preaching, and they\r\nhave experience to back them. The boy may come and go as he pleases,\r\nso long as he behaves himself. No restraint of any sort is put on his\r\nindependence. He is as free as any other guest at a hotel, and, like\r\nhim, he is expected to pay for what he gets. How wisely the men planned\r\nwho laid the foundation of this great rescue work and yet carry it on,\r\nis shown by no single feature of it better than by this. No pauper\r\nwas ever bred within these houses. Nothing would have been easier with\r\nsuch material, or more fatal. But charity of the kind that pauperizes\r\nis furthest from their scheme. Self-help is its very key-note, and it\r\nstrikes a response in the boy's sturdiest trait that raises him at\r\nonce to a level with the effort made in his behalf. Recognized as an\r\nindependent trader, capable of and bound to take care of himself, he is\r\nin a position to ask trust if trade has gone against him and he cannot\r\npay cash for his \"grub\" and his bed, and to get it without question.\r\nHe can even have the loan of the small capital required to start him\r\nin business with a boot-black's kit, or an armful of papers, if he is\r\nknown or vouched for; but every cent is charged to him as carefully\r\nas though the transaction involved as many hundreds of dollars, and\r\nhe is expected to pay back the money as soon as he has made enough to\r\nkeep him going without it. He very rarely betrays the trust reposed in\r\nhim. Quite on the contrary, around this sound core of self-help, thus\r\nencouraged, habits of thrift and ambitious industry are seen to grow up\r\nin a majority of instances. The boy is \"growing\" a character, and he\r\ngoes out to the man's work in life with that which for him is better\r\nthan if he had found a fortune.\r\n\r\nSix cents for his bed, six for his breakfast of bread and coffee, and\r\nsix for his supper of pork and beans, as much as he can eat, are the\r\nrates of the boys' \"hotel\" for those who bunk together in the great\r\ndormitories that sometimes hold more than a hundred berths, two tiers\r\nhigh, made of iron, clean and neat. For the \"upper ten,\" the young\r\nfinanciers who early take the lead among their fellows, hire them to\r\nwork for wages and add a share of their profits to their own, and for\r\nthe lads who are learning a trade and getting paid by the week, there\r\nare ten-cent beds with a locker and with curtains hung about. Night\r\nschools and Sunday night meetings are held in the building and are\r\nalways well attended, in winter especially, when the lodging-houses\r\nare crowded. In summer the tow-path and the country attract their\r\nshare of the bigger boys. The \"Sunday-school racket\" has ceased to\r\nhave terror for them. They follow the proceedings with the liveliest\r\ninterest, quick to detect cant of any sort, should any stray in. No\r\none has any just conception of what congregational singing is until\r\nhe has witnessed a roomful of these boys roll up their sleeves and\r\nstart in on \"I am a lily of the valley.\" The swinging trapeze in the\r\ngymnasium on the top floor is scarcely more popular with the boys than\r\nthis tremendously vocal worship. The Street Arab puts his whole little\r\nsoul into what interests him for the moment, whether it be pulverizing\r\na rival who has done a mean trick to a smaller boy, or attending at the\r\n\"gospel shop\" on Sundays. This characteristic made necessary some extra\r\nsupervision when recently the lads in the Duane Street Lodging House\r\n\"chipped in\" and bought a set of boxing gloves. The trapeze suffered a\r\ntemporary eclipse until this new toy had been tested to the extent of\r\nseveral miniature black eyes upon which soap had no effect, and sundry\r\nlittle scores had been settled that evened things up, as it were, for a\r\nfresh start.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GETTING READY FOR SUPPER IN THE NEWSBOYS' LODGING\r\n                 HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nI tried one night, not with the best of success I confess, to\r\nphotograph the boys in their wash-room, while they were cleaning up\r\nfor supper. They were quite turbulent, to the disgust of one of their\r\nnumber who assumed, unasked, the office of general manager of the show,\r\nand expressed his mortification to me in very polite language. \"If\r\nthey would only behave, sir!\" he complained, \"you could make a good\r\npicture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but it isn't in them, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, b'gosh!\" said he, lapsing suddenly from grace under the\r\nprovocation, \"them kids ain't got no sense, nohow!\"\r\n\r\nThe Society maintains five of these boys' lodging houses, and one\r\nfor girls, in the city. The Duane Street Lodging House alone has\r\nsheltered since its foundation in 1855 nearly a quarter of a million\r\ndifferent boys, at a total expense of a good deal less than half a\r\nmillion dollars. Of this amount, up to the beginning of the present\r\nyear, the boys and the earnings of the house had contributed no less\r\nthan $172,776.38. In all of the lodging-houses together, 12,153 boys\r\nand girls were sheltered and taught last year. The boys saved up no\r\ninconsiderable amount of money in the savings banks provided for them\r\nin the houses, a simple system of lock-boxes that are emptied for\r\ntheir benefit once a month. Besides these, the Society has established\r\nand operates in the tenement districts twenty-one industrial schools,\r\nco-ordinate with the public schools in authority, for the children\r\nof the poor who cannot find room in the city's school-houses, or are\r\ntoo ragged to go there; two free reading-rooms, a dressmaking and\r\ntypewriting school and a laundry for the instruction of girls; a\r\nsick-children's mission in the city and two on the sea-shore, where\r\npoor mothers may take their babies; a cottage by the sea for crippled\r\ngirls, and a brush factory for crippled boys in Forty-fourth Street.\r\nThe Italian school in Leonard Street, alone, had an average attendance\r\nof over six hundred pupils last year. The daily average attendance\r\nat all of them was 4,105, while 11,331 children were registered and\r\ntaught. When the fact that there were among these 1,132 children of\r\ndrunken parents, and 416 that had been found begging in the street,\r\nis contrasted with the showing of $1,337.21 deposited in the school\r\nsavings banks by 1,745 pupils, something like an adequate idea is\r\ngained of the scope of the Society's work in the city.\r\n\r\nA large share of it, in a sense the largest, certainly that productive\r\nof the happiest results, lies outside of the city, however. From the\r\nlodging-houses and the schools are drawn the battalions of young\r\nemigrants that go every year to homes in the Far West, to grow up\r\nself-supporting men and women safe from the temptations and the vice of\r\nthe city. Their number runs far up in the thousands. The Society never\r\nloses sight of them. The records show that the great mass, with this\r\nstart given them, become useful citizens, an honor to the communities\r\nin which their lot is cast. Not a few achieve place and prominence in\r\ntheir new surroundings. Rarely bad reports come of them. Occasionally\r\none comes back, lured by homesickness even for the slums; but the\r\nbriefest stay generally cures the disease for good. I helped once to\r\nsee a party off for Michigan, the last sent out by that great friend of\r\nthe homeless children, Mrs. Astor, before she died. In the party was\r\na boy who had been an \"Insider\" at the Five Points House of Industry,\r\nand brought along as his only baggage a padlocked and iron-bound box\r\nthat contained all his wealth, two little white mice of the friendliest\r\ndisposition. They were going with him out to live on the fat of the\r\nland in the fertile West, where they would never be wanting for a\r\ncrust. Alas! for the best-laid plans of mice and men. The Western diet\r\ndid not agree with either. I saw their owner some months later in the\r\nold home at the Five Points. He had come back, walking part of the\r\nway, and was now pleading to be sent out once more. He had at last\r\nhad enough of the city. His face fell when I asked him about the mice.\r\nIt was a sad story, indeed. \"They had so much corn to eat,\" he said,\r\n\"and they couldn't stand it. They burned all up inside, and then they\r\nbusted.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Astor set an example during her noble and useful life in gathering\r\nevery year a company of homeless boys from the streets and sending them\r\nto good homes, with decent clothes on their backs--she had sent out no\r\nless than thirteen hundred when she died, and left funds to carry on\r\nher work--that has been followed by many who, like her, had the means\r\nand the heart for such a labor of love. Most of the lodging-houses\r\nand school-buildings of the society were built by some one rich man\r\nor woman who paid all the bills, and often objected to have even the\r\nname of the giver made known to the world. It is one of the pleasant\r\nexperiences of life that give one hope and courage in the midst of\r\nall this misery to find names, that stand to the unthinking mass\r\nonly for money-getting and grasping, associated with such unheralded\r\nbenefactions that carry their blessings down to generations yet unborn.\r\nIt is not so long since I found the carriage of a woman, whose name is\r\nsynonymous with millions, standing in front of the boys' lodging-house\r\nin Thirty-fifth Street. Its owner was at that moment busy with a\r\nsurgeon making a census of the crippled lads in the brush-shop, the\r\nmost miserable of all the Society's charges, as a preliminary to\r\nfitting them out with artificial limbs.\r\n\r\nFarther uptown than any reared by the Children's Aid Society, in\r\nSixty-seventh Street, stands a lodging-house intended for boys of a\r\nsomewhat larger growth than most of those whom the Society shelters.\r\nUnlike the others, too, it was built by the actual labor of the young\r\nmen it was designed to benefit. In the day when more of the boys\r\nfrom our streets shall find their way to it and to the New York Trade\r\nSchools, of which it is a kind of home annex, we shall be in a fair\r\nway of solving in the most natural of all ways the question what to\r\ndo with this boy, in spite of the ignorant opposition of the men\r\nwhose tyrannical policy is now to blame for the showing that, out of\r\ntwenty-three millions of dollars paid annually to mechanics in the\r\nbuilding trades in this city, less than six millions go to the workman\r\nborn in New York, while his boy roams the streets with every chance of\r\ngrowing up a vagabond and next to none of becoming an honest artisan.\r\nColonel Auchmuty is a practical philanthropist to whom the growing\r\nyouth of New York will one day owe a debt of gratitude not easily paid.\r\nThe progress of the system of trade schools established by him, at\r\nwhich a young man may acquire the theory as well as the practice of a\r\ntrade in a few months at a merely nominal outlay, has not been nearly\r\nas rapid as was to be desired, though the fact that other cities are\r\ncopying the model, with their master mechanics as the prime movers in\r\nthe enterprise, testifies to its excellence. But it has at last taken\r\na real start, and with union men and even the officers of unions now\r\nsending their sons to the trade schools to be taught,[19] one may\r\nperhaps be permitted to hope that an era of better sense is dawning\r\nthat shall witness a rescue work upon lines which, when the leaven has\r\nfairly had time to work, will put an end to the existence of the New\r\nYork Street Arab, of the native breed at least.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Colonel Auchmuty's own statement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                           THE REIGN OF RUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere God builds a church the devil builds next door--a saloon, is\r\nan old saying that has lost its point in New York. Either the devil\r\nwas on the ground first, or he has been doing a good deal more in the\r\nway of building. I tried once to find out how the account stood, and\r\ncounted to 111 Protestant churches, chapels, and places of worship of\r\nevery kind below Fourteenth Street, 4,065 saloons. The worst half of\r\nthe tenement population lives down there, and it has to this day the\r\nworst half of the saloons. Uptown the account stands a little better,\r\nbut there are easily ten saloons to every church to-day. I am afraid,\r\ntoo, that the congregations are larger by a good deal; certainly the\r\nattendance is steadier and the contributions more liberal the week\r\nround, Sunday included. Turn and twist it as we may, over against every\r\nbulwark for decency and morality which society erects, the saloon\r\nprojects its colossal shadow, omen of evil wherever it falls into the\r\nlives of the poor.\r\n\r\nNowhere is its mark so broad or so black. To their misery it sticketh\r\ncloser than a brother, persuading them that within its doors only is\r\nrefuge, relief. It has the best of the argument, too, for it is true,\r\nworse pity, that in many a tenement-house block the saloon is the one\r\nbright and cheery and humanly decent spot to be found. It is a sorry\r\nadmission to make, that to bring the rest of the neighborhood up to\r\nthe level of the saloon would be one way of squelching it; but it is\r\nso. Wherever the tenements thicken, it multiplies. Upon the direst\r\npoverty of their crowds it grows fat and prosperous, levying upon it\r\na tax heavier than all the rest of its grievous burdens combined. It\r\nis not yet two years since the Excise Board made the rule that no\r\nthree corners of any street-crossing, not already so occupied, should\r\nthenceforward be licensed for rum-selling. And the tardy prohibition\r\nwas intended for the tenement districts. Nowhere else is there need of\r\nit. One may walk many miles through the homes of the poor searching\r\nvainly for an open reading-room, a cheerful coffee-house, a decent club\r\nthat is not a cloak for the traffic in rum. The dramshop yawns at every\r\nstep, the poor man's club, his forum and his haven of rest when weary\r\nand disgusted with the crowding, the quarrelling, and the wretchedness\r\nat home. With the poison dealt out there he takes his politics, in\r\nquality not far apart. As the source, so the stream. The rumshop turns\r\nthe political crank in New York. The natural yield is rum politics. Of\r\nwhat that means, successive Boards of Aldermen, composed in a measure,\r\nif not of a majority, of dive-keepers, have given New York a taste. The\r\ndisgrace of the infamous \"Boodle Board\" will be remembered until some\r\ncorruption even fouler crops out and throws it into the shade.\r\n\r\nWhat relation the saloon bears to the crowds, let me illustrate by a\r\ncomparison. Below Fourteenth Street were, when the Health Department\r\ntook its first accurate census of the tenements a year and a half ago,\r\n13,220 of the 32,390 buildings classed as such in the whole city.\r\nOf the eleven hundred thousand tenants, not quite half a million,\r\nembracing a host of more than sixty-three thousand children under\r\nfive years of age, lived below that line. Below it, also, were 234 of\r\nthe cheap lodging-houses accounted for by the police last year, with\r\na total of four millions and a half of lodgers for the twelvemonth,\r\n59 of the city's 110 pawnshops, and 4,065 of its 7,884 saloons. The\r\nfour most densely peopled precincts, the Fourth, Sixth, Tenth, and\r\nEleventh, supported together in round numbers twelve hundred saloons,\r\nand their returns showed twenty-seven per cent. of the whole number\r\nof arrests for the year. The Eleventh Precinct, that has the greatest\r\nand the poorest crowds of all--it is the Tenth Ward--and harbored\r\none-third of the army of homeless lodgers and fourteen per cent. of\r\nall the prisoners of the year, kept 485 saloons going in 1889. It\r\nis not on record that one of them all failed for want of support. A\r\nnumber of them, on the contrary, had brought their owners wealth and\r\nprominence. From their bars these eminent citizens stepped proudly into\r\nthe councils of the city and the State. The very floor of one of the\r\nbar-rooms, in a neighborhood that lately resounded with the cry for\r\nbread of starving workmen, is paved with silver dollars!\r\n\r\nEast Side poverty is not alone in thus rewarding the tyrants that\r\nsweeten its cup of bitterness with their treacherous poison. The Fourth\r\nWard points with pride to the honorable record of the conductors of\r\nits \"Tub of Blood,\" and a dozen bar-rooms with less startling titles;\r\nthe West Side to the wealth and \"social\" standing of the owners of\r\nsuch resorts as the \"Witches' Broth\" and the \"Plug Hat\" in the region\r\nof Hell's Kitchen three-cent whiskey, names ominous of the concoctions\r\nbrewed there and of their fatally generous measure. Another ward,\r\nthat boasts some of the best residences and the bluest blood on\r\nManhattan Island, honors with political leadership in the ruling\r\nparty the proprietor of one of the most disreputable Black-and-Tan\r\ndives and dancing-hells to be found anywhere. Criminals and policemen\r\nalike do him homage. The list might be strung out to make texts for\r\nsermons with a stronger home flavor than many that are preached in\r\nour pulpits on Sunday. But I have not set out to write the political\r\nhistory of New York. Besides, the list would not be complete. Secret\r\ndives are skulking in the slums and out of them, that are not labelled\r\nrespectable by a Board of Excise and support no \"family entrance.\"\r\nTheir business, like that of the stale-beer dives, is done through\r\na side-door the week through. No one knows the number of unlicensed\r\nsaloons in the city. Those who have made the matter a study estimate\r\nit at a thousand, more or less. The police make occasional schedules\r\nof a few and report them to headquarters. Perhaps there is a farce in\r\nthe police court, and there the matter ends. Rum and \"influence\" are\r\nsynonymous terms. The interests of the one rarely suffer for the want\r\nof attention from the other.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A DOWNTOWN \"MORGUE.\"]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these free lances that treat the law openly\r\nwith contempt, the saloons all hang out a sign announcing in fat\r\ntype that no beer or liquor is sold to children. In the down-town\r\n\"morgues\" that make the lowest degradation of tramp-humanity pan out a\r\npaying interest, as in the \"reputable resorts\" uptown where Inspector\r\nByrnes's men spot their worthier quarry elbowing citizens whom the\r\nidea of associating with a burglar would give a shock they would not\r\nget over for a week, this sign is seen conspicuously displayed. Though\r\napparently it means submission to a beneficent law, in reality the sign\r\nis a heartless, cruel joke. I doubt if one child in a thousand, who\r\nbrings his growler to be filled at the average New York bar, is sent\r\naway empty-handed, if able to pay for what he wants. I once followed a\r\nlittle boy, who shivered in bare feet on a cold November night so that\r\nhe seemed in danger of smashing his pitcher on the icy pavement, into\r\na Mulberry Street saloon where just such a sign hung on the wall, and\r\nforbade the barkeeper to serve the boy. The man was as astonished at\r\nmy interference as if I had told him to shut up his shop and go home,\r\nwhich in fact I might have done with as good a right, for it was after\r\n1 A.M., the legal closing hour. He was mighty indignant too,\r\nand told me roughly to go away and mind my business, while he filled\r\nthe pitcher. The law prohibiting the selling of beer to minors is about\r\nas much respected in the tenement-house districts as the ordinance\r\nagainst swearing. Newspaper readers will recall the story, told little\r\nmore than a year ago, of a boy who after carrying beer a whole day\r\nfor a shopful of men over on the East Side, where his father worked,\r\ncrept into the cellar to sleep off the effects of his own share in the\r\nrioting. It was Saturday evening. Sunday his parents sought him high\r\nand low; but it was not until Monday morning, when the shop was opened,\r\nthat he was found, killed and half-eaten by the rats that overran the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAll the evil the saloon does in breeding poverty and in corrupting\r\npolitics; all the suffering it brings into the lives of its thousands\r\nof innocent victims, the wives and children of drunkards it sends forth\r\nto curse the community; its fostering of crime and its shielding of\r\ncriminals--it is all as nothing to this, its worst offence. In its\r\naffinity for the thief there is at least this compensation that, as\r\nit makes, it also unmakes him. It starts him on his career only to\r\ntrip him up and betray him into the hands of the law, when the rum\r\nhe exchanged for his honesty has stolen his brains as well. For the\r\ncorruption of the child there is no restitution. None is possible. It\r\nsaps the very vitals of society; undermines its strongest defences, and\r\ndelivers them over to the enemy. Fostered and filled by the saloon, the\r\n\"growler\" looms up in the New York street boy's life, baffling the most\r\npersistent efforts to reclaim him. There is no escape from it; no hope\r\nfor the boy, once its blighting grip is upon him. Thenceforward the\r\nlogic of the slums, that the world which gave him poverty and ignorance\r\nfor his portion \"owes him a living,\" is his creed, and the career of\r\nthe \"tough\" lies open before him, a beaten track to be blindly followed\r\nto a bad end in the wake of the growler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                         THE HARVEST OF TARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"growler\" stood at the cradle of the tough. It bosses him through\r\nhis boyhood apprenticeship in the \"gang,\" and leaves him, for a time\r\nonly, at the door of the jail that receives him to finish his training\r\nand turn him loose upon the world a thief, to collect by stealth or by\r\nforce the living his philosophy tells him that it owes him, and will\r\nnot voluntarily surrender without an equivalent in the work which he\r\nhates. From the moment he, almost a baby, for the first time carries\r\nthe growler for beer, he is never out of its reach, and the two soon\r\nform a partnership that lasts through life. It has at least the merit,\r\nsuch as it is, of being loyal. The saloon is the only thing that\r\ntakes kindly to the lad. Honest play is interdicted in the streets.\r\nThe policeman arrests the ball-tossers, and there is no room in the\r\nback-yard. In one of these, between two enormous tenements that swarmed\r\nwith children, I read this ominous notice: \"_All boys caught in this\r\nyard will be delt with accorden to law._\"\r\n\r\nAlong the water-fronts, in the holes of the dock-rats, and on the\r\navenues, the young tough finds plenty of kindred spirits. Every corner\r\nhas its gang, not always on the best of terms with the rivals in the\r\nnext block, but all with a common programme: defiance of law and\r\norder, and with a common ambition: to get \"pinched,\" _i.e._, arrested,\r\nso as to pose as heroes before their fellows. A successful raid on\r\nthe grocer's till is a good mark, \"doing up\" a policeman cause for\r\npromotion. The gang is an institution in New York. The police deny\r\nits existence while nursing the bruises received in nightly battles\r\nwith it that tax their utmost resources. The newspapers chronicle its\r\ndoings daily, with a sensational minuteness of detail that does its\r\nshare toward keeping up its evil traditions and inflaming the ambition\r\nof its members to be as bad as the worst. The gang is the ripe fruit\r\nof tenement-house growth. It was born there, endowed with a heritage\r\nof instinctive hostility to restraint by a generation that sacrificed\r\nhome to freedom, or left its country for its country's good. The\r\ntenement received and nursed the seed. The intensity of the American\r\ntemper stood sponsor to the murderer in what would have been the common\r\n\"bruiser\" of a more phlegmatic clime. New York's tough represents the\r\nessence of reaction against the old and the new oppression, nursed in\r\nthe rank soil of its slums. Its gangs are made up of the American-born\r\nsons of English, Irish, and German parents. They reflect exactly the\r\nconditions of the tenements from which they sprang. Murder is as\r\ncongenial to Cherry Street or to Battle Row, as quiet and order to\r\nMurray Hill. The \"assimilation\" of Europe's oppressed hordes, upon\r\nwhich our Fourth of July orators are fond of dwelling, is perfect. The\r\nproduct is our own.\r\n\r\nSuch is the genesis of New York's gangs. Their history is not so easily\r\nwritten. It would embrace the largest share of our city's criminal\r\nhistory for two generations back, every page of it dyed red with blood.\r\nThe guillotine Paris set up a century ago to avenge its wrongs was\r\nnot more relentless, or less discriminating, than this Nemesis of New\r\nYork. The difference is of intent. Murder with that was the serious\r\npurpose; with ours it is the careless incident, the wanton brutality of\r\nthe moment. Bravado and robbery are the real purposes of the gangs; the\r\nformer prompts the attack upon the policeman, the latter that upon the\r\ncitizen. Within a single week last spring, the newspapers recorded six\r\nmurderous assaults on unoffending people, committed by young highwaymen\r\nin the public streets. How many more were suppressed by the police, who\r\nalways do their utmost to hush up such outrages \"in the interests of\r\njustice,\" I shall not say. There has been no lack of such occurrences\r\nsince, as the records of the criminal courts show. In fact, the past\r\nsummer has seen, after a period of comparative quiescence of the gangs,\r\na reawakening to renewed turbulence of the East Side tribes, and over\r\nand over again the reserve forces of a precinct have been called out\r\nto club them into submission. It is a peculiarity of the gangs that\r\nthey usually break out in spots, as it were. When the West Side is\r\nin a state of eruption, the East Side gangs \"lie low,\" and when the\r\ntoughs along the North River are nursing broken heads at home, or their\r\nrevenge in Sing Sing, fresh trouble breaks out in the tenements east\r\nof Third Avenue. This result is brought about by the very efforts made\r\nby the police to put down the gangs. In spite of local feuds, there is\r\nbetween them a species of ruffianly Freemasonry that readily admits to\r\nfull fellowship a hunted rival in the face of the common enemy. The\r\ngangs belt the city like a huge chain from the Battery to Harlem--the\r\ncollective name of the \"chain gang\" has been given to their scattered\r\ngroups in the belief that a much closer connection exists between them\r\nthan commonly supposed--and the ruffian for whom the East Side has\r\nbecame too hot, has only to step across town and change his name, a\r\nmatter usually much easier for him than to change his shirt, to find a\r\nsanctuary in which to plot fresh outrages. The more notorious he is,\r\nthe warmer the welcome, and if he has \"done\" his man he is by common\r\nconsent accorded the leadership in his new field.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it might be inferred that the New York tough is a\r\nvery fierce individual, of indomitable courage and naturally as\r\nblood-thirsty as a tiger. On the contrary he is an arrant coward. His\r\ninstincts of ferocity are those of the wolf rather than the tiger.\r\nIt is only when he hunts with the pack that he is dangerous. Then\r\nhis inordinate vanity makes him forget all fear or caution in the\r\ndesire to distinguish himself before his fellows, a result of his\r\nswallowing all the flash literature and penny-dreadfuls he can beg,\r\nborrow, or steal--and there is never any lack of them--and of the\r\nstrongly dramatic element in his nature that is nursed by such a diet\r\ninto rank and morbid growth. He is a queer bundle of contradictions\r\nat all times. Drunk and foul-mouthed, ready to cut the throat of a\r\ndefenceless stranger at the toss of a cent, fresh from beating his\r\ndecent mother black and blue to get money for rum,[20] he will resent\r\nas an intolerable insult the imputation that he is \"no gentleman.\"\r\nFighting his battles with the coward's weapons, the brass-knuckles and\r\nthe deadly sand-bag, or with brick-bats from the housetops, he is\r\nstill in all seriousness a lover of fair play, and as likely as not,\r\nwhen his gang has downed a policeman in a battle that has cost a dozen\r\nbroken heads, to be found next saving a drowning child or woman at the\r\nperil of his own life. It depends on the angle at which he is seen,\r\nwhether he is a cowardly ruffian, or a possible hero with different\r\ntraining and under different social conditions. Ready wit he has at all\r\ntimes, and there is less meanness in his make-up than in that of the\r\nbully of the London slums; but an intense love of show and applause,\r\nthat carries him to any length of bravado, which his twin-brother\r\nacross the sea entirely lacks. I have a very vivid recollection of\r\nseeing one of his tribe, a robber and murderer before he was nineteen,\r\ngo to the gallows unmoved, all fear of the rope overcome, as it seemed,\r\nby the secret, exultant pride of being the centre of a first-class\r\nshow, shortly to be followed by that acme of tenement-life bliss, a\r\nbig funeral. He had his reward. His name is to this day a talisman\r\namong West Side ruffians, and is proudly borne by the gang of which, up\r\ntill the night when he \"knocked out his man,\" he was an obscure though\r\naspiring member.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: This very mother will implore the court with tears, the\r\nnext morning, to let her renegade son off. A poor woman, who claimed\r\nto be the widow of a soldier, applied to the Tenement-house Relief\r\nCommittee of the King's Daughters last summer, to be sent to some home,\r\nas she had neither kith nor kin to care for her. Upon investigation\r\nit was found that she had four big sons, all toughs, who beat her\r\nregularly and took from her all the money she could earn or beg; she\r\nwas \"a respectable woman, of good habits,\" the inquiry developed, and\r\nlied only to shield her rascally sons.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A GROWLER GANG IN SESSION.]\r\n\r\nThe crime that made McGloin famous was the cowardly murder of an\r\nunarmed saloonkeeper who came upon the gang while it was sacking his\r\nbar-room at the dead of night. McGloin might easily have fled, but\r\ndisdained to \"run for a Dutchman.\" His act was a fair measure of the\r\nstandard of heroism set up by his class in its conflicts with society.\r\nThe finish is worthy of the start. The first long step in crime taken\r\nby the half-grown boy, fired with ambition to earn a standing in his\r\ngang, is usually to rob a \"lush,\" _i.e._, a drunken man who has strayed\r\nhis way, likely enough is lying asleep in a hallway. He has served\r\nan apprenticeship on copper-bottom wash-boilers and like articles\r\nfound lying around loose, and capable of being converted into cash\r\nenough to give the growler a trip or two; but his first venture at\r\nrobbery moves him up into full fellowship at once. He is no longer\r\na \"kid,\" though his years may be few, but a tough with the rest. He\r\nmay even in time--he is reasonably certain of it--get his name in the\r\npapers as a murderous scoundrel, and have his cup of glory filled\r\nto the brim. I came once upon a gang of such young rascals passing\r\nthe growler after a successful raid of some sort, down at the West\r\nThirty-seventh Street dock, and, having my camera along, offered\r\nto \"take\" them. They were not old and wary enough to be shy of the\r\nphotographer, whose acquaintance they usually first make in handcuffs\r\nand the grip of a policeman; or their vanity overcame their caution.\r\nIt is entirely in keeping with the tough's character that he should\r\nlove of all things to pose before a photographer, and the ambition is\r\nusually the stronger the more repulsive the tough. These were of that\r\nsort, and accepted the offer with great readiness, dragging into their\r\ngroup a disreputable-looking sheep that roamed about with them (the\r\nslaughter-houses were close at hand) as one of the band. The homeliest\r\nruffian of the lot, who insisted on being taken with the growler to his\r\n\"mug,\" took the opportunity to pour what was left in it down his throat\r\nand this caused a brief unpleasantness, but otherwise the performance\r\nwas a success. While I was getting the camera ready, I threw out a\r\nvague suggestion of cigarette-pictures, and it took root at once.\r\nNothing would do then but that I must take the boldest spirits of the\r\ncompany \"in character.\" One of them tumbled over against a shed, as if\r\nasleep, while two of the others bent over him, searching his pockets\r\nwith a deftness that was highly suggestive. This, they explained\r\nfor my benefit, was to show how they \"did the trick.\" The rest of\r\nthe band were so impressed with the importance of this exhibition\r\nthat they insisted on crowding into the picture by climbing upon the\r\nshed, sitting on the roof with their feet dangling over the edge, and\r\ndisposing themselves in every imaginable manner within view, as they\r\nthought. Lest any reader be led into the error of supposing them to\r\nhave been harmless young fellows enjoying themselves in peace, let me\r\nsay that within half an hour after our meeting, when I called at the\r\npolice station three blocks away, I found there two of my friends of\r\nthe \"Montgomery Guards\" under arrest for robbing a Jewish pedlar who\r\nhad passed that way after I left them, and trying to saw his head off,\r\nas they put it, \"just for fun. The sheeny cum along an' the saw was\r\nthere, an' we socked it to him.\" The prisoners were described to me by\r\nthe police as Dennis, \"the Bum,\" and \"Mud\" Foley.\r\n\r\nIt is not always that their little diversions end as harmlessly as did\r\nthis, even from the standpoint of the Jew, who was pretty badly hurt.\r\nNot far from the preserves of the Montgomery Guards, in Poverty Gap,\r\ndirectly opposite the scene of the murder to which I have referred in\r\na note explaining the picture of the Cunningham family (p. 169), a\r\nyoung lad, who was the only support of his aged parents, was beaten to\r\ndeath within a few months by the \"Alley Gang,\" for the same offence\r\nthat drew down the displeasure of its neighbors upon the pedlar: that\r\nof being at work trying to earn an honest living. I found a part of the\r\ngang asleep the next morning, before young Healey's death was known,\r\nin a heap of straw on the floor of an unoccupied room in the same row\r\nof rear tenements in which the murdered boy's home was. One of the\r\ntenants, who secretly directed me to their lair, assuring me that no\r\nworse scoundrels went unhung, ten minutes later gave the gang, to its\r\nface, an official character for sobriety and inoffensiveness that very\r\nnearly startled me into an unguarded rebuke of his duplicity. I caught\r\nhis eye in time and held my peace. The man was simply trying to protect\r\nhis own home, while giving such aid as he safely could toward bringing\r\nthe murderous ruffians to justice. The incident shows to what extent a\r\nneighborhood may be terrorized by a determined gang of these reckless\r\ntoughs.\r\n\r\nIn Poverty Gap there were still a few decent people left. When it\r\ncomes to Hell's Kitchen, or to its compeers at the other end of\r\nThirty-ninth Street over by the East River, and further down First\r\nAvenue in \"the Village,\" the Rag Gang and its allies have no need of\r\nfearing treachery in their periodical battles with the police. The\r\nentire neighborhood takes a hand on these occasions, the women in the\r\nfront rank, partly from sheer love of the \"fun,\" but chiefly because\r\nhusbands, brothers, and sweet-hearts are in the fight to a man and\r\nneed their help. Chimney-tops form the staple of ammunition then, and\r\nstacks of loose brick and paving-stones, carefully hoarded in upper\r\nrooms as a prudent provision against emergencies. Regular patrol posts\r\nare established by the police on the housetops in times of trouble in\r\nthese localities, but even then they do not escape whole-skinned, if,\r\nindeed, with their lives; neither does the gang. The policeman knows of\r\nbut one cure for the tough, the club, and he lays it on without stint\r\nwhenever and wherever he has the chance, knowing right well that, if\r\ncaught at a disadvantage, he will get his outlay back with interest.\r\nWords are worse than wasted in the gang-districts. It is a blow at\r\nsight, and the tough thus accosted never stops to ask questions.\r\nUnless he is \"wanted\" for some signal outrage, the policeman rarely\r\nbothers with arresting him. He can point out half a dozen at sight\r\nagainst whom indictments are pending by the basketful, but whom no\r\njail ever held many hours. They only serve to make him more reckless,\r\nfor he knows that the political backing that has saved him in the past\r\ncan do it again. It is a commodity that is only exchangeable \"for\r\nvalue received,\" and it is not hard to imagine what sort of value is\r\nin demand. The saloon, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, stands\r\nbehind the bargain.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, as well as because he knows from frequent experience\r\nhis own way to be the best, the policeman lets the gangs alone except\r\nwhen they come within reach of his long night-stick. They have their\r\n\"club-rooms\" where they meet, generally in a tenement, sometimes under\r\na pier or a dump, to carouse, play cards, and plan their raids; their\r\n\"fences,\" who dispose of the stolen property. When the necessity\r\npresents itself for a descent upon the gang after some particularly\r\nflagrant outrage, the police have a task on hand that is not of the\r\neasiest. The gangs, like foxes, have more than one hole to their\r\ndens. In some localities, where the interior of a block is filled\r\nwith rear tenements, often set at all sorts of odd angles, surprise\r\nalone is practicable. Pursuit through the winding ways and passages is\r\nimpossible. The young thieves know them all by heart. They have their\r\nrunways over roofs and fences which no one else could find. Their lair\r\nis generally selected with special reference to its possibilities\r\nof escape. Once pitched upon, its occupation by the gang, with its\r\near-mark of nightly symposiums, \"can-rackets\" in the slang of the\r\nstreet, is the signal for a rapid deterioration of the tenement, if\r\nthat is possible. Relief is only to be had by ousting the intruders.\r\nAn instance came under my notice in which valuable property had been\r\nwell-nigh ruined by being made the thoroughfare of thieves by night\r\nand by day. They had chosen it because of a passage that led through\r\nthe block by way of several connecting halls and yards. The place\r\ncame soon to be known as \"Murderers Alley.\" Complaint was made to the\r\nBoard of Health, as a last resort, of the condition of the property.\r\nThe practical inspector who was sent to report upon it suggested to\r\nthe owner that he build a brick-wall in a place where it would shut\r\noff communication between the streets, and he took the advice. Within\r\nthe brief space of a few months the house changed character entirely,\r\nand became as decent as it had been before the convenient runway was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TYPICAL TOUGHS (FROM THE ROGUES' GALLERY).]\r\n\r\nThis was in the Sixth Ward, where the infamous Whyo Gang until a few\r\nyears ago absorbed the worst depravity of the Bend and what is left of\r\nthe Five Points. The gang was finally broken up when its leader was\r\nhanged for murder after a life of uninterrupted and unavenged crimes,\r\nthe recital of which made his father confessor turn pale, listening\r\nin the shadow of the scaffold, though many years of labor as chaplain\r\nof the Tombs had hardened him to such rehearsals. The great Whyo had\r\nbeen a \"power in the ward,\" handy at carrying elections for the party\r\nor faction that happened to stand in need of his services and was\r\nwilling to pay for them in money or in kind. Other gangs have sprung\r\nup since with as high ambition and a fair prospect of outdoing their\r\npredecessor. The conditions that bred it still exist, practically\r\nunchanged. Inspector Byrnes is authority for the statement that\r\nthroughout the city the young tough has more \"ability\" and \"nerve\" than\r\nthe thief whose example he successfully emulates. He begins earlier,\r\ntoo. Speaking of the increase of the native element among criminal\r\nprisoners exhibited in the census returns of the last thirty years,[21]\r\nthe Rev. Fred. H. Wines says, \"their youth is a very striking fact.\"\r\nHad he confined his observations to the police courts of New York,\r\nhe might have emphasized that remark and found an explanation of the\r\ndiscovery that \"the ratio of prisoners in cities is two and one-quarter\r\ntimes as great as in the country at large,\" a computation that takes\r\nno account of the reformatories for juvenile delinquents, or the\r\nexhibit would have been still more striking. Of the 82,200 persons\r\narrested by the police in 1889, 10,505 were under twenty years old.\r\nThe last report of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nChildren enumerates, as \"a few typical cases,\" eighteen \"professional\r\ncracksmen,\" between nine and fifteen years old, who had been caught\r\nwith burglars' tools, or in the act of robbery. Four of them, hardly\r\nyet in long trousers, had \"held up\" a wayfarer in the public street and\r\nrobbed him of $73. One, aged sixteen, \"was the leader of a noted gang\r\nof young robbers in Forty-ninth Street. He committed murder, for which\r\nhe is now serving a term of nineteen years in State's Prison.\" Four of\r\nthe eighteen were girls and quite as bad as the worst. In a few years\r\nthey would have been living with the toughs of their choice without the\r\nceremony of a marriage, egging them on by their pride in their lawless\r\nachievements, and fighting side by side with them in their encounters\r\nwith the \"cops.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: \"The percentage of foreign-born prisoners in 1850, as\r\ncompared with that of natives, was more than five times that of native\r\nprisoners, now (1880) it is less than double.\"--American Prisons in the\r\nTenth Census.]\r\n\r\nThe exploits of the Paradise Park Gang in the way of highway robbery\r\nshowed last summer that the embers of the scattered Whyo Gang, upon\r\nthe wreck of which it grew, were smouldering still. The hanging of\r\nDriscoll broke up the Whyos because they were a comparatively small\r\nband, and, with the incomparable master-spirit gone, were unable to\r\nresist the angry rush of public indignation that followed the crowning\r\noutrage. This is the history of the passing away of famous gangs from\r\ntime to time. The passing is more apparent than real, however. Some\r\nother daring leader gathers the scattered elements about him soon,\r\nand the war on society is resumed. A bare enumeration of the names of\r\nthe best-known gangs would occupy pages of this book. The Rock Gang,\r\nthe Rag Gang, the Stable Gang, and the Short Tail Gang down about the\r\n\"Hook\" have all achieved bad eminence, along with scores of others\r\nthat have not paraded so frequently in the newspapers. By day they\r\nloaf in the corner-groggeries on their beat, at night they plunder the\r\nstores along the avenues, or lie in wait at the river for unsteady feet\r\nstraying their way. The man who is sober and minds his own business\r\nthey seldom molest, unless he be a stranger inquiring his way, or a\r\npoliceman and the gang twenty against the one. The tipsy wayfarer is\r\ntheir chosen victim, and they seldom have to look for him long. One\r\nhas not far to go to the river from any point in New York. The man who\r\ndoes not know where he is going is sure to reach it sooner or later.\r\nShould he foolishly resist or make an outcry--dead men tell no tales.\r\n\"Floaters\" come ashore every now and then with pockets turned inside\r\nout, not always evidence of a post-mortem inspection by dock-rats.\r\nPolice patrol the rivers as well as the shore on constant look-out\r\nfor these, but seldom catch up with them. If overtaken after a race\r\nduring which shots are often exchanged from the boats, the thieves have\r\nan easy way of escaping and at the same time destroying the evidence\r\nagainst them; they simply upset the boat. They swim, one and all, like\r\nreal rats; the lost plunder can be recovered at leisure the next day by\r\ndiving or grappling. The loss of the boat counts for little. Another is\r\nstolen, and the gang is ready for business again.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HUNTING RIVER THIEVES.]\r\n\r\nThe fiction of a social \"club,\" which most of the gangs keep up, helps\r\nthem to a pretext for blackmailing the politicians and the storekeepers\r\nin their bailiwick at the annual seasons of their picnic, or ball.\r\nThe \"thieves' ball\" is as well known and recognized an institution\r\non the East Side as the Charity Ball in a different social stratum,\r\nalthough it does not go by that name, in print at least. Indeed,\r\nthe last thing a New York tough will admit is that he is a thief.\r\nHe dignifies his calling with the pretence of gambling. He does\r\nnot steal: he \"wins\" your money or your watch, and on the police\r\nreturns he is a \"speculator.\" If, when he passes around the hat for\r\n\"voluntary\" contributions, any storekeeper should have the temerity\r\nto refuse to chip in, he may look for a visit from the gang on the\r\nfirst dark night, and account himself lucky if his place escapes\r\nbeing altogether wrecked. The Hell's Kitchen Gang and the Rag Gang\r\nhave both distinguished themselves within recent times by blowing up\r\nobjectionable stores with stolen gunpowder. But if no such episode mar\r\nthe celebration, the excursion comes off and is the occasion for a\r\nseries of drunken fights that as likely as not end in murder. No season\r\nhas passed within my memory that has not seen the police reserves\r\ncalled out to receive some howling pandemonium returning from a picnic\r\ngrove on the Hudson or on the Sound. At least one peaceful community up\r\nthe river, that had borne with this nuisance until patience had ceased\r\nto be a virtue, received a boat-load of such picnickers in a style\r\nbefitting the occasion and the cargo. The outraged citizens planted\r\na howitzer on the dock, and bade the party land at their peril. With\r\nthe loaded gun pointed dead at them, the furious toughs gave up and\r\nthe peace was not broken on the Hudson that day, at least not ashore.\r\nIt is good cause for congratulation that the worst of all forms of\r\nrecreation popular among the city's toughs, the moonlight picnic, has\r\nbeen effectually discouraged. Its opportunities for disgraceful revelry\r\nand immorality were unrivalled anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn spite of influence and protection, the tough reaches eventually\r\nthe end of his rope. Occasionally--not too often--there is a noose on\r\nit. If not, the world that owes him a living, according to his creed,\r\nwill insist on his earning it on the safe side of a prison wall. A\r\nfew, a very few, have been clubbed into an approach to righteousness\r\nfrom the police standpoint. The condemned tough goes up to serve his\r\n\"bit\" or couple of \"stretches,\" followed by the applause of his gang.\r\nIn the prison he meets older thieves than himself, and sits at their\r\nfeet listening with respectful admiration to their accounts of the\r\ngreat doings that sent them before. He returns with the brand of the\r\njail upon him, to encounter the hero-worship of his old associates\r\nas an offset to the cold shoulder given him by all the rest of the\r\nworld. Even if he is willing to work, disgusted with the restraint and\r\nhard labor of prison life, and in a majority of cases that thought is\r\nprobably uppermost in his mind, no one will have him around. If, with\r\nthe assistance of Inspector Byrnes, who is a philanthropist in his own\r\npractical way, he secures a job, he is discharged on the slightest\r\nprovocation, and for the most trifling fault. Very soon he sinks back\r\ninto his old surroundings, to rise no more until he is lost to view in\r\nthe queer, mysterious way in which thieves and fallen women disappear.\r\nNo one can tell how. In the ranks of criminals he never rises above\r\nthat of the \"laborer,\" the small thief or burglar, or general crook,\r\nwho blindly does the work planned for him by others, and runs the\r\nbiggest risk for the poorest pay. It cannot be said that the \"growler\"\r\nbrought him luck, or its friendship fortune. And yet, if his misdeeds\r\nhave helped to make manifest that all effort to reclaim his kind must\r\nbegin with the conditions of life against which his very existence is a\r\nprotest, even the tough has not lived in vain. This measure of credit\r\nat least should be accorded him, that, with or without his good-will,\r\nhe has been a factor in urging on the battle against the slums that\r\nbred him. It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price\r\nof liberty and the preservation of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                     THE WORKING GIRLS OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the harvest of tares, sown in iniquity and reaped in wrath, the\r\npolice returns tell the story. The pen that wrote the \"Song of the\r\nShirt\" is needed to tell of the sad and toil-worn lives of New York's\r\nworking-women. The cry echoes by night and by day through its tenements:\r\n\r\n      Oh, God! that bread should be so dear,\r\n      And flesh and blood so cheap!\r\n\r\nSix months have not passed since at a great public meeting in this\r\ncity, the Working Women's Society reported: \"It is a known fact that\r\nmen's wages cannot fall below a limit upon which they can exist, but\r\nwoman's wages have no limit, since the paths of shame are always\r\nopen to her. It is simply impossible for any woman to live without\r\nassistance on the low salary a saleswoman earns, without depriving\r\nherself of real necessities.... It is inevitable that they must in\r\nmany instances resort to evil.\" It was only a few brief weeks before\r\nthat verdict was uttered, that the community was shocked by the story\r\nof a gentle and refined woman who, left in direst poverty to earn her\r\nown living alone among strangers, threw herself from her attic window,\r\npreferring death to dishonor. \"I would have done any honest work, even\r\nto scrubbing,\" she wrote, drenched and starving, after a vain search\r\nfor work in a driving storm. She had tramped the streets for weeks on\r\nher weary errand, and the only living wages that were offered her were\r\nthe wages of sin. The ink was not dry upon her letter before a woman in\r\nan East Side tenement wrote down her reason for self-murder: \"Weakness,\r\nsleeplessness, and yet obliged to work. My strength fails me. Sing\r\nat my coffin: 'Where does the soul find a home and rest?'\" Her story\r\nmay be found as one of two typical \"cases of despair\" in one little\r\nchurch community, in the _City Mission Society's Monthly_ for last\r\nFebruary. It is a story that has many parallels in the experience of\r\nevery missionary, every police reporter and every family doctor whose\r\npractice is among the poor.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that at least one hundred and fifty thousand women\r\nand girls earn their own living in New York; but there is reason to\r\nbelieve that this estimate falls far short of the truth when sufficient\r\naccount is taken of the large number who are not wholly dependent upon\r\ntheir own labor, while contributing by it to the family's earnings.\r\nThese alone constitute a large class of the women wage-earners, and it\r\nis characteristic of the situation that the very fact that some need\r\nnot starve on their wages condemns the rest to that fate. The pay they\r\nare willing to accept all have to take. What the \"everlasting law of\r\nsupply and demand,\" that serves as such a convenient gag for public\r\nindignation, has to do with it, one learns from observation all along\r\nthe road of inquiry into these real woman's wrongs. To take the case\r\nof the saleswomen for illustration: The investigation of the Working\r\nWomen's Society disclosed the fact that wages averaging from $2 to\r\n$4.50 a week were reduced by excessive fines, the employers placing a\r\nvalue upon time lost that is not given to services rendered.\" A little\r\ngirl, who received two dollars a week, made cash-sales amounting to\r\n$167 in a single day, while the receipts of a fifteen-dollar male\r\nclerk in the same department footed up only $125; yet for some trivial\r\nmistake the girl was fined sixty cents out of her two dollars. The\r\npractice prevailed in some stores of dividing the fines between the\r\nsuperintendent and the time-keeper at the end of the year. In one\r\ninstance they amounted to $3,000, and \"the superintendent was heard to\r\ncharge the time-keeper with not being strict enough in his duties.\"\r\nOne of the causes for fine in a certain large store was sitting down.\r\nThe law requiring seats for saleswomen, generally ignored, was obeyed\r\nfaithfully in this establishment. The seats were there, but the girls\r\nwere fined when found using them.\r\n\r\nCash-girls receiving $1.75 a week for work that at certain seasons\r\nlengthened their day to sixteen hours were sometimes required to pay\r\nfor their aprons. A common cause for discharge from stores in which, on\r\naccount of the oppressive heat and lack of ventilation, \"girls fainted\r\nday after day and came out looking like corpses,\" was too long service.\r\nNo other fault was found with the discharged saleswomen than that they\r\nhad been long enough in the employ of the firm to justly expect an\r\nincrease of salary. The reason was even given with brutal frankness, in\r\nsome instances.\r\n\r\nThese facts give a slight idea of the hardships and the poor pay of\r\na business that notoriously absorbs child-labor. The girls are sent\r\nto the store before they have fairly entered their teens, because the\r\nmoney they can earn there is needed for the support of the family.\r\nIf the boys will not work, if the street tempts them from home,\r\namong the girls at least there must be no drones. To keep their\r\nplaces they are told to lie about their age and to say that they are\r\nover fourteen. The precaution is usually superfluous. The Women's\r\nInvestigating Committee found the majority of the children employed\r\nin the stores to be under age, but heard only in a single instance\r\nof the truant officers calling. In that case they came once a year\r\nand sent the youngest children home; but in a month's time they were\r\nall back in their places, and were not again disturbed. When it comes\r\nto the factories, where hard bodily labor is added to long hours,\r\nstifling rooms, and starvation wages, matters are even worse. The\r\nLegislature has passed laws to prevent the employment of children, as\r\nit has forbidden saloon-keepers to sell them beer, and it has provided\r\nmeans of enforcing its mandate, so efficient, that the very number of\r\nfactories in New York is _guessed_ at as in the neighborhood of twelve\r\nthousand. Up till this summer, a single inspector was charged with the\r\nduty of keeping the run of them all, and of seeing to it that the law\r\nwas respected by the owners.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SEWING AND STARVING IN AN ELIZABETH STREET ATTIC.]\r\n\r\nSixty cents is put as the average day's earnings of the 150,000, but\r\ninto this computation enters the stylish \"cashier's\" two dollars a day,\r\nas well as the thirty cents of the poor little girl who pulls threads\r\nin an East Side factory, and, if anything, the average is probably too\r\nhigh. Such as it is, however, it represents board, rent, clothing,\r\nand \"pleasure\" to this army of workers. Here is the case of a woman\r\nemployed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands\r\nfor a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pays\r\n$1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she\r\ncannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young,\r\nshe is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less\r\nthan a miracle if she is guilty of nothing worse than the \"early and\r\nimprovident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the\r\nprolific causes of the distress of the poor? Almost any door might seem\r\nto offer welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much\r\nhealthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one\r\nof the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic\r\nservice, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only\r\nhalf-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door\r\nat which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to\r\nknock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\r\n\r\nThe tenement and the competition of public institutions and farmers'\r\nwives and daughters, have done the tyrant shirt to death, but they\r\nhave not bettered the lot of the needle-women. The sweater of the East\r\nSide has appropriated the flannel shirt. He turns them out to-day at\r\nforty-five cents a dozen, paying his Jewish workers from twenty to\r\nthirty-five cents. One of these testified before the State Board of\r\nArbitration, during the shirtmakers' strike, that she worked eleven\r\nhours in the shop and four at home, and had never in the best of times\r\nmade over six dollars a week. Another stated that she worked from 4\r\no'clock in the morning to 11 at night. These girls had to find their\r\nown thread and pay for their own machines out of their wages. The white\r\nshirt has gone to the public and private institutions that shelter\r\nlarge numbers of young girls, and to the country. There are not half as\r\nmany shirtmakers in New York to-day as only a few years ago, and some\r\nof the largest firms have closed their city shops. The same is true of\r\nthe manufacturers of underwear. One large Broadway firm has nearly all\r\nits work done by farmers' girls in Maine, who think themselves well off\r\nif they can earn two or three dollars a week to pay for a Sunday silk,\r\nor the wedding outfit, little dreaming of the part they are playing in\r\nstarving their city sisters. Literally, they sew \"with double thread,\r\na shroud as well as a shirt.\" Their pin-money sets the rate of wages\r\nfor thousands of poor sewing-girls in New York. The average earnings of\r\nthe worker on underwear to-day do not exceed the three dollars which\r\nher competitor among the Eastern hills is willing to accept as the\r\nprice of her play. The shirtmaker's pay is better only because the very\r\nfinest custom work is all there is left for her to do.\r\n\r\nCalico wrappers at a dollar and a half a dozen--the very expert sewers\r\nable to make from eight to ten, the common run five or six--neckties\r\nat from 25 to 75 cents a dozen, with a dozen as a good day's work, are\r\nspecimens of women's wages. And yet people persist in wondering at the\r\npoor quality of work done in the tenements! Italian cheap labor has\r\ncome of late also to possess this poor field, with the sweater in its\r\ntrain. There is scarce a branch of woman's work outside of the home\r\nin which wages, long since at low-water mark, have not fallen to the\r\npoint of actual starvation. A case was brought to my notice recently\r\nby a woman doctor, whose heart as well as her life-work is with the\r\npoor, of a widow with two little children she found at work in an East\r\nSide attic, making paper-bags. Her father, she told the doctor, had\r\nmade good wages at it; but she received only five cents for six hundred\r\nof the little three-cornered bags, and her fingers had to be very\r\nswift and handle the paste-brush very deftly to bring her earnings up\r\nto twenty-five and thirty cents a day. She paid four dollars a month\r\nfor her room. The rest went to buy food for herself and the children.\r\nThe physician's purse, rather than her skill, had healing for their\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nI have aimed to set down a few dry facts merely. They carry their own\r\ncomment. Back of the shop with its weary, grinding toil--the home in\r\nthe tenement, of which it was said in a report of the State Labor\r\nBureau: \"Decency and womanly reserve cannot be maintained there--what\r\nwonder so many fall away from virtue?\" Of the outlook, what? Last\r\nChristmas Eve my business took me to an obscure street among the\r\nWest Side tenements. An old woman had just fallen on the doorstep,\r\nstricken with paralysis. The doctor said she would never again move her\r\nright hand or foot. The whole side was dead. By her bedside, in their\r\ncheerless room, sat the patient's aged sister, a hopeless cripple, in\r\ndumb despair. Forty years ago the sisters had come, five in number\r\nthen, with their mother, from the North of Ireland to make their home\r\nand earn a living among strangers. They were lace embroiderers and\r\nfound work easily at good wages. All the rest had died as the years\r\nwent by. The two remained and, firmly resolved to lead an honest life,\r\nworked on though wages fell and fell as age and toil stiffened their\r\nonce nimble fingers and dimmed their sight. Then one of them dropped\r\nout, her hands palsied and her courage gone. Still the other toiled on,\r\nresting neither by night nor by day, that the sister might not want.\r\nNow that she too had been stricken, as she was going to the store for\r\nthe work that was to keep them through the holidays, the battle was\r\nover at last. There was before them starvation, or the poor-house. And\r\nthe proud spirits of the sisters, helpless now, quailed at the outlook.\r\n\r\nThese were old, with life behind them. For them nothing was left but to\r\nsit in the shadow and wait. But of the thousands, who are travelling\r\nthe road they trod to the end, with the hot blood of youth in their\r\nveins, with the love of life and of the beautiful world to which not\r\neven sixty cents a day can shut their eyes--who is to blame if their\r\nfeet find the paths of shame that are \"always open to them?\" The very\r\npaths that have effaced the saving \"limit,\" and to which it is declared\r\nto be \"inevitable that they must in many instances resort.\" Let the\r\nmoralist answer. Let the wise economist apply his rule of supply\r\nand demand, and let the answer be heard in this city of a thousand\r\ncharities where justice goes begging.\r\n\r\nTo the everlasting credit of New York's working-girl let it be said\r\nthat, rough though her road be, all but hopeless her battle with life,\r\nonly in the rarest instances does she go astray. As a class she is\r\nbrave, virtuous, and true. New York's army of profligate women is not,\r\nas in some foreign cities, recruited from her ranks. She is as plucky\r\nas she is proud. That \"American girls never whimper\" became a proverb\r\nlong ago, and she accepts her lot uncomplainingly, doing the best she\r\ncan and holding her cherished independence cheap at the cost of a meal,\r\nor of half her daily ration, if need be. The home in the tenement and\r\nthe traditions of her childhood have neither trained her to luxury nor\r\npredisposed her in favor of domestic labor in preference to the shop.\r\nSo, to the world she presents a cheerful, uncomplaining front that\r\nsometimes deceives it. Her courage will not be without its reward.\r\nSlowly, as the conviction is thrust upon society that woman's work\r\nmust enter more and more into its planning, a better day is dawning.\r\nThe organization of working girls' clubs, unions, and societies with a\r\ncommunity of interests, despite the obstacles to such a movement, bears\r\ntestimony to it, as to the devotion of the unselfish women who have\r\nmade their poorer sisters' cause their own, and will yet wring from an\r\nunfair world the justice too long denied her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                      PAUPERISM IN THE TENEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed with me the fate of the Other Half thus\r\nfar, may not experience much of a shock at being told that in eight\r\nyears 135,595 families in New York were registered as asking or\r\nreceiving charity. Perhaps, however, the intelligence will rouse him\r\nthat for five years past one person in every ten who died in this city\r\nwas buried in the Potter's Field. These facts tell a terrible story.\r\nThe first means that in a population of a million and a half, very\r\nnearly, if not quite, half a million persons were driven, or chose, to\r\nbeg for food, or to accept it in charity at some period of the eight\r\nyears, if not during the whole of it. There is no mistake about these\r\nfigures. They are drawn from the records of the Charity Organization\r\nSociety, and represent the time during which it has been in existence.\r\nIt is not even pretended that the record is complete. To be well within\r\nthe limits, the Society's statisticians allow only three and a half to\r\nthe family, instead of the four and a half that are accepted as the\r\nstandard of calculations which deal with New York's population as a\r\nwhole. They estimate upon the basis of their every-day experience that,\r\nallowing for those who have died, moved away, or become for the time\r\nbeing at least self-supporting, eighty-five per cent. of the registry\r\nare still within, or lingering upon, the borders of dependence.\r\nPrecisely how the case stands with this great horde of the indigent\r\nis shown by a classification of 5,169 cases that were investigated by\r\nthe Society in one year. This was the way it turned out: 327 worthy of\r\ncontinuous relief, or 6.4 per cent.; 1,269 worthy of temporary relief,\r\nor 24.4 per cent.; 2,698 in need of work, rather than relief, or 52.2\r\nper cent.; 875 unworthy of relief, or 17 per cent.\r\n\r\nThat is, nearly six and a half per cent, of all were utterly\r\nhelpless--orphans, cripples, or the very aged; nearly one-fourth needed\r\njust a lift to start them on the road of independence, or of permanent\r\npauperism, according to the wisdom with which the lever was applied.\r\nMore than half were destitute because they had no work and were unable\r\nto find any, and one-sixth were frauds, professional beggars, training\r\ntheir children to follow in their foot-steps--a veritable \"tribe of\r\nIshmael,\" tightening its grip on society as the years pass, until\r\nsociety shall summon up pluck to say with Paul, \"if any man will not\r\nwork neither shall he eat,\" and stick to it. It is worthy of note that\r\nalmost precisely the same results followed a similar investigation in\r\nBoston. There were a few more helpless cases of the sort true charity\r\naccounts it a gain to care for, but the proportion of a given lot that\r\nwas crippled for want of work, or unworthy, was exactly the same as in\r\nthis city. The bankrupt in hope, in courage, in purse, and in purpose,\r\nare not peculiar to New York. They are found the world over, but we\r\nhave our full share. If further proof were wanted, it is found in the\r\nprevalence of pauper burials. The Potter's Field stands ever for utter,\r\nhopeless surrender. The last the poor will let go, however miserable\r\ntheir lot in life, is the hope of a decent burial. But for the five\r\nyears ending with 1888 the average of burials in the Potter's Field\r\nhas been 10.03 per cent. of all. In 1889 it was 9.64. In that year\r\nthe proportion to the total mortality of those who died in hospitals,\r\ninstitutions, and in the Almshouse was as 1 in 5.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A FLAT IN THE PAUPER BARRACKS, WEST THIRTY-EIGHTH\r\n                 STREET, WITH ALL ITS FURNITURE.]\r\n\r\nThe 135,595 families inhabited no fewer than 31,000 different\r\ntenements. I say tenements advisedly, though the society calls them\r\nbuildings, because at least ninety-nine per cent. were found in the big\r\nbarracks, the rest in shanties scattered here and there, and now and\r\nthen a fraud or an exceptional case of distress in a dwelling-house\r\nof better class. Here, undoubtedly, allowance must be made for the\r\nconstant moving about of those who live on charity, which enables\r\none active beggar to blacklist a dozen houses in the year. Still the\r\ngreat mass of the tenements are shown to be harboring alms-seekers.\r\nThey might almost as safely harbor the small-pox. That scourge is not\r\nmore contagious than the alms-seeker's complaint. There are houses that\r\nhave been corrupted through and through by this pestilence, until their\r\nvery atmosphere breathes beggary. More than a hundred and twenty pauper\r\nfamilies have been reported from time to time as living in one such\r\ntenement.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that pauperism grows in the tenements as naturally as\r\nweeds in a garden lot. A moral distemper, like crime, it finds there\r\nits most fertile soil. All the surroundings of tenement-house life\r\nfavor its growth, and where once it has taken root it is harder to\r\ndislodge than the most virulent of physical diseases. The thief is\r\ninfinitely easier to deal with than the pauper, because the very fact\r\nof his being a thief presupposes some bottom to the man. Granted that\r\nit is bad, there is still something, a possible handle by which to\r\ncatch him. To the pauper there is none. He is as hopeless as his own\r\npoverty. I speak of the _pauper_, not of the honestly poor. There is\r\na sharp line between the two; but athwart it stands the tenement, all\r\nthe time blurring and blotting it out. \"It all comes down to character\r\nin the end,\" was the verdict of a philanthropist whose life has been\r\nspent wrestling with this weary problem. And so it comes down to the\r\ntenement, the destroyer of individuality and character everywhere.\r\n\"In nine years,\" said a wise and charitable physician, sadly, to me,\r\n\"I have known of but a single case of permanent improvement in a poor\r\ntenement family.\" I have known of some, whose experience, extending\r\nover an even longer stretch, was little better.\r\n\r\nThe beggar follows the \"tough's\" rule of life that the world owes him\r\na living, but his scheme of collecting it stops short of violence. He\r\nhas not the pluck to rob even a drunken man. His highest flights take\r\nin at most an unguarded clothes-line, or a little child sent to buy\r\nbread or beer with the pennies he clutches tightly as he skips along.\r\nEven then he prefers to attain his end by stratagem rather than by\r\nforce, though occasionally, when the coast is clear, he rises to the\r\nheight of the bully. The ways he finds of \"collecting\" under the cloak\r\nof undeserved poverty are numberless, and often reflect credit on the\r\nman's ingenuity, if not on the man himself. I remember the shock with\r\nwhich my first experience with his kind--her kind, rather, in this\r\ncase: the beggar was a woman--came home to me. On my way to and from\r\nthe office I had been giving charity regularly, as I fondly believed,\r\nto an old woman who sat in Chatham Square with a baby done up in a\r\nbundle of rags, moaning piteously in sunshine and rain, \"Please, help\r\nthe poor.\" It was the baby I pitied and thought I was doing my little\r\nto help, until one night I was just in time to rescue it from rolling\r\nout of her lap, and found the bundle I had been wasting my pennies upon\r\njust rags and nothing more, and the old hag dead drunk. Since then I\r\nhave encountered bogus babies, borrowed babies, and drugged babies\r\nin the streets, and fought shy of them all. Most of them, I am glad\r\nto say, have been banished from the street since; but they are still\r\noccasionally to be found. It was only last winter that the officers\r\nof the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children arrested an\r\nItalian woman who was begging along Madison Avenue with a poor little\r\nwreck of a girl, whose rags and pinched face were calculated to tug\r\nhard at the purse-strings of a miser. Over five dollars in nickles\r\nand pennies were taken from the woman's pockets, and when her story of\r\npoverty and hunger was investigated at the family's home in a Baxter\r\nStreet tenement, bank-books turned up that showed the Masonis to be\r\nregular pauper capitalists, able to draw their check for three thousand\r\ndollars, had they been so disposed. The woman was fined $250, a worse\r\npunishment undoubtedly than to have sent her to prison for the rest of\r\nher natural life. Her class has, unhappily, representatives in New York\r\nthat have not yet been brought to grief.\r\n\r\nNothing short of making street begging a crime has availed to clear\r\nour city of this pest to an appreciable extent. By how much of an\r\neffort this result has been accomplished may be gleaned from the fact\r\nthat the Charity Organization Society alone, in five years, caused the\r\ntaking up of 2,594 street beggars, and the arrest and conviction of\r\n1,474 persistent offenders. Last year it dealt with 612 perambulating\r\nmendicants. The police report only 19 arrests for begging during the\r\nyear 1889, but the real facts of the case are found under the heading\r\n\"vagrancy.\" In all, 2,633 persons were charged with this offence, 947\r\nof them women. A goodly proportion of these latter came from the low\r\ngroggeries of the Tenth Ward, where a peculiar variety of the female\r\ntramp-beggar is at home, the \"scrub.\" The scrub is one degree perhaps\r\nabove the average pauper in this, that she is willing to work at least\r\none day in the week, generally the Jewish Sabbath. The orthodox Jew can\r\ndo no work of any sort from Friday evening till sunset on Saturday,\r\nand this interim the scrub fills out in Ludlow Street. The pittance\r\nshe receives for this vicarious sacrifice of herself upon the altar\r\nof the ancient faith buys her rum for at least two days of the week\r\nat one of the neighborhood \"morgues.\" She lives through the other\r\nfour by begging. There are distilleries in Jewtown, or just across its\r\nborders, that depend almost wholly on her custom. Recently, when one\r\nin Hester Street was raided because the neighbors had complained of\r\nthe boisterous hilarity of the hags over their beer, thirty two aged\r\n\"scrubs\" were marched off to the station-house.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find preconceived notions quite upset in a review of\r\nthe nationalities that go to make up this squad of street beggars. The\r\nIrish head the list with fifteen per cent., and the native American\r\nis only a little way behind with twelve per cent., while the Italian,\r\nwho in his own country turns beggary into a fine art, has less than\r\ntwo per cent. Eight per cent. were Germans. The relative prevalence of\r\nthe races in our population does not account for this showing. Various\r\ncauses operate, no doubt, to produce it. Chief among them is, I think,\r\nthe tenement itself. It has no power to corrupt the Italian, who comes\r\nhere in almost every instance to work--no beggar would ever emigrate\r\nfrom anywhere unless forced to do so. He is distinctly on its lowest\r\nlevel from the start. With the Irishman the case is different. The\r\ntenement, especially its lowest type, appears to possess a peculiar\r\naffinity for the worse nature of the Celt, to whose best and strongest\r\ninstincts it does violence, and soonest and most thoroughly corrupts\r\nhim. The \"native\" twelve per cent. represent the result of this\r\nprocess, the hereditary beggar of the second or third generation in the\r\nslums.\r\n\r\nThe blind beggar alone is winked at in New York's streets, because the\r\nauthorities do not know what else to do with him. There is no provision\r\nfor him anywhere after he is old enough to strike out for himself.\r\nThe annual pittance of thirty or forty dollars which he receives\r\nfrom the city serves to keep his landlord in good humor; for the rest\r\nhis misfortune and his thin disguise of selling pencils on the street\r\ncorners must provide. Until the city affords him some systematic way\r\nof earning his living by work (as Philadelphia has done, for instance)\r\nto banish him from the street would be tantamount to sentencing him to\r\ndeath by starvation. So he possesses it in peace, that is, if he is\r\nblind in good earnest, and begs without \"encumbrance.\" Professional\r\nmendicancy does not hesitate to make use of the greatest of human\r\nafflictions as a pretence for enlisting the sympathy upon which it\r\nthrives. Many New Yorkers will remember the French school-master who\r\nwas \"blinded by a shell at the siege of Paris,\" but miraculously\r\nrecovered his sight when arrested and deprived of his children by the\r\nofficers of Mr. Gerry's society. When last heard of he kept a \"museum\"\r\nin Hartford, and acted the overseer with financial success. His sign\r\nwith its pitiful tale, that was a familiar sight in our streets\r\nfor years and earned for him the capital upon which he started his\r\nbusiness, might have found a place among the curiosities exhibited\r\nthere, had it not been kept in a different sort of museum here as a\r\nmemento of his rascality. There was another of his tribe, a woman, who\r\nbegged for years with a deformed child in her arms, which she was found\r\nto have hired at an almshouse in Genoa for fifteen francs a month. It\r\nwas a good investment, for she proved to be possessed of a comfortable\r\nfortune. Some time before that, the Society for the Prevention of\r\nCruelty to Children, that found her out, had broken up the dreadful\r\npadrone system, a real slave trade in Italian children, who were\r\nbought of poor parents across the sea and made to beg their way on\r\nfoot through France to the port whence they were shipped to this city,\r\nto be beaten and starved here by their cruel masters and sent out to\r\nbeg, often after merciless mutilation to make them \"take\" better with a\r\npitying public.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the tenement offers a better chance of fraud on\r\nimpulsive but thoughtless charity, than all the wretchedness of the\r\nstreet, and with fewer risks. To the tender-hearted and unwary it\r\nis, in itself, the strongest plea for help. When such a cry goes up\r\nas was heard recently from a Mott Street den, where the family of a\r\n\"sick\" husband, a despairing mother, and half a dozen children in\r\nrags and dirt were destitute of the \"first necessities of life,\" it\r\nis not to be wondered at that a stream of gold comes pouring in to\r\nrelieve. It happens too often, as in that case, that a little critical\r\ninquiry or reference to the \"black list\" of the Charity Organization\r\nSociety, justly dreaded only by the frauds, discovers the \"sickness\"\r\nto stand for laziness, and the destitution to be the family's stock in\r\ntrade; and the community receives a shock that for once is downright\r\nwholesome, if it imposes a check on an undiscriminating charity that is\r\nworse than none at all.\r\n\r\nThe case referred to furnished an apt illustration of how thoroughly\r\ncorrupting pauperism is in such a setting. The tenement woke up early\r\nto the gold mine that was being worked under its roof, and before the\r\nday was three hours old the stream of callers who responded to the\r\nnewspaper appeal found the alley blocked by a couple of \"toughs,\" who\r\nexacted toll of a silver quarter from each tearful sympathizer with the\r\nmisery in the attic.\r\n\r\nA volume might be written about the tricks of the professional beggar,\r\nand the uses to which he turns the tenement in his trade. The Boston\r\n\"widow\" whose husband turned up alive and well after she had buried\r\nhim seventeen times with tears and lamentation, and made the public\r\npay for the weekly funerals, is not without representatives in New\r\nYork. The \"gentleman tramp\" is a familiar type from our streets, and\r\nthe \"once respectable Methodist\" who patronized all the revivals in\r\ntown with his profitable story of repentance, only to fall from grace\r\ninto the saloon door nearest the church after the service was over,\r\nmerely transferred the scene of his operations from the tenement to the\r\nchurch as the proper setting for his specialty. There is enough of real\r\nsuffering in the homes of the poor to make one wish that there were\r\nsome effective way of enforcing Paul's plan of starving the drones into\r\nthe paths of self-support: no work, nothing to eat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: COFFEE AT ONE CENT.]\r\n\r\nThe message came from one of the Health Department's summer doctors,\r\nlast July, to the King's Daughters' Tenement-house Committee, that\r\na family with a sick child was absolutely famishing in an uptown\r\ntenement. The address was not given. The doctor had forgotten to\r\nwrite it down, and before he could be found and a visitor sent to the\r\nhouse the baby was dead, and the mother had gone mad. The nurse found\r\nthe father, who was an honest laborer long out of work, packing the\r\nlittle corpse in an orange-box partly filled with straw, that he might\r\ntake it to the Morgue for pauper burial. There was absolutely not a\r\ncrust to eat in the house, and the other children were crying for\r\nfood. The great immediate need in that case, as in more than half of\r\nall according to the record, was work and living wages. Alms do not\r\nmeet the emergency at all. They frequently aggravate it, degrading\r\nand pauperizing where true help should aim at raising the sufferer\r\nto self-respect and self-dependence. The experience of the Charity\r\nOrganization Society in raising, in eight years, 4,500 families out of\r\nthe rut of pauperism into proud, if modest, independence, without alms,\r\nbut by a system of \"friendly visitation,\" and the work of the Society\r\nfor Improving the Condition of the Poor and kindred organizations along\r\nthe same line, shows what can be done by well-directed effort. It is\r\nestimated that New York spends in public and private charity every year\r\na round $8,000,000. A small part of this sum intelligently invested\r\nin a great labor bureau, that would bring the seeker of work and the\r\none with work to give together under auspices offering some degree of\r\nmutual security, would certainly repay the amount of the investment in\r\nthe saving of much capital now worse than wasted, and would be prolific\r\nof the best results. The ultimate and greatest need, however, the\r\nreal remedy, is to remove the cause--the tenement that was built for\r\n\"a class of whom nothing was expected,\" and which has come fully up to\r\nthe expectation. Tenement-house reform holds the key to the problem\r\nof pauperism in the city. We can never get rid of either the tenement\r\nor the pauper. The two will always exist together in New York. But by\r\nreforming the one, we can do more toward exterminating the other than\r\ncan be done by all other means together that have yet been invented, or\r\never will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n                       THE WRECKS AND THE WASTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPauperdom is to blame for the unjust yoking of poverty with punishment,\r\n\"charities\" with \"correction,\" in our municipal ministering to the\r\nneeds of the Nether Half. The shadow of the workhouse points like a\r\nscornful finger toward its neighbor, the almshouse, when the sun sets\r\nbehind the teeming city across the East River, as if, could its stones\r\nspeak, it would say before night drops its black curtain between them:\r\n\"You and I are brothers. I am not more bankrupt in moral purpose than\r\nyou. A common parent begat us. Twin breasts, the tenement and the\r\nsaloon, nourished us. Vice and unthrift go hand in hand. Pauper, behold\r\nthy brother!\" And the almshouse owns the bitter relationship in silence.\r\n\r\nOver on the islands that lie strung along the river and far up the\r\nSound the Nether Half hides its deformity, except on show-days, when\r\ndistinguished visitors have to be entertained and the sore is uncovered\r\nby the authorities with due municipal pride in the exhibit. I shall\r\nspare the reader the sight. The aim of these pages has been to lay bare\r\nits source. But a brief glance at our proscribed population is needed\r\nto give background and tone to the picture. The review begins with\r\nthe Charity Hospital with its thousand helpless human wrecks; takes\r\nin the penitentiary, where the \"tough\" from Battle Row and Poverty\r\nGap is made to earn behind stone walls the living the world owes him;\r\na thoughtless, jolly convict-band with opportunity at last \"to think\"\r\nbehind the iron bars, but little desire to improve it; governed like\r\nunruly boys, which in fact most of them are. Three of them were taken\r\nfrom the dinner-table while I was there one day, for sticking pins\r\ninto each other, and were set with their faces to the wall in sight\r\nof six hundred of their comrades for punishment. Pleading incessantly\r\nfor tobacco, when the keeper's back is turned, as the next best thing\r\nto the whiskey they cannot get, though they can plainly make out the\r\nsaloon-signs across the stream where they robbed or \"slugged\" their\r\nway to prison. Every once in a while the longing gets the best of some\r\nprisoner from the penitentiary or the workhouse, and he risks his life\r\nin the swift currents to reach the goal that tantilizes him with the\r\npromise of \"just one more drunk.\" The chances are at least even of his\r\nbeing run down by some passing steamer and drowned, even if he is not\r\novertaken by the armed guards who patrol the shore in boats, or his\r\nstrength does not give out.\r\n\r\nThis workhouse comes next, with the broken-down hordes from the dives,\r\nthe lodging-houses, and the tramps' nests, the \"hell-box\"[22] rather\r\nthan the repair-shop of the city. In 1889 the registry at the workhouse\r\nfooted up 22,477, of whom some had been there as many as twenty times\r\nbefore. It is the popular summer resort of the slums, but business is\r\nbrisk at this stand the year round. Not a few of its patrons drift\r\nback periodically without the formality of a commitment, to take their\r\nchances on the island when there is no escape from the alternative of\r\nwork in the city. Work, but not too much work, is the motto of the\r\nestablishment. The \"workhouse step\" is an institution that must be\r\nobserved on the island, in order to draw any comparison between it and\r\nthe snail's pace that shall do justice to the snail. Nature and man's\r\nart have made these islands beautiful; but weeds grow luxuriantly in\r\ntheir gardens, and spiders spin their cobwebs unmolested in the borders\r\nof sweet-smelling box. The work which two score of hired men could do\r\nwell is too much for these thousands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: In printing-offices the broken, worn-out, and useless\r\ntype is thrown into the \"hell-box,\" to be recast at the foundry.]\r\n\r\nRows of old women, some smoking stumpy, black clay-pipes, others\r\nknitting or idling, all grumbling, sit or stand under the trees that\r\nhedge in the almshouse, or limp about in the sunshine, leaning on\r\ncrutches or bean-pole staffs. They are a \"growler-gang\" of another\r\nsort than may be seen in session on the rocks of the opposite shore at\r\nthat very moment. They grumble and growl from sunrise to sunset, at\r\nthe weather, the breakfast, the dinner, the supper; at pork and beans\r\nas at corned beef and cabbage; at their Thanksgiving dinner as at the\r\nhalf rations of the sick ward; at the past that had no joy, at the\r\npresent whose comfort they deny, and at the future without promise. The\r\ncrusty old men in the next building are not a circumstance to them. The\r\nwarden, who was in charge of the almshouse for many years, had become\r\nso snappish and profane by constant association with a thousand cross\r\nold women that I approached him with some misgivings, to request his\r\npermission to \"take\" a group of a hundred or so who were within shot of\r\nmy camera. He misunderstood me.\r\n\r\n\"Take them?\" he yelled. \"Take the thousand of them and be welcome. They\r\nwill never be still, by ----, till they are sent up on Hart's Island in\r\na box, and I'll be blamed if I don't think they will growl then at the\r\nstyle of the funeral.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he threw his arms around me in an outburst of enthusiasm over the\r\nwondrous good luck that had sent a friend indeed to his door. I felt it\r\nto be a painful duty to undeceive him. When I told him that I simply\r\nwanted the old women's picture, he turned away in speechless disgust,\r\nand to his dying day, I have no doubt, remembered my call as the day of\r\nthe champion fool's visit to the island.\r\n\r\nWhen it is known that many of these old people have been sent to the\r\nalmshouse to die by their heartless children, for whom they had worked\r\nfaithfully as long as they were able, their growling and discontent is\r\nnot hard to understand. Bitter poverty threw them all \"on the county,\"\r\noften on the wrong county at that. Very many of them are old-country\r\npoor, sent, there is reason to believe, to America by the authorities\r\nto get rid of the obligation to support them. \"The almshouse,\" wrote a\r\ngood missionary, \"affords a sad illustration of St. Paul's description\r\nof the 'last days.' The class from which comes our poorhouse population\r\nis to a large extent 'without natural affection.'\" I was reminded by\r\nhis words of what my friend, the doctor, had said to me a little while\r\nbefore: \"Many a mother has told me at her child's death-bed, 'I cannot\r\nafford to lose it. It costs too much to bury it.' And when the little\r\none did die there was no time for the mother's grief. The question\r\ncrowded on at once, 'where shall the money come from?' Natural feelings\r\nand affections are smothered in the tenements.\" The doctor's experience\r\nfurnished a sadly appropriate text for the priest's sermon.\r\n\r\nPitiful as these are, sights and sounds infinitely more saddening\r\nawait us beyond the gate that shuts this world of woe off from one\r\nwhence the light of hope and reason have gone out together. The\r\nshuffling of many feet on the macadamized roads heralds the approach\r\nof a host of women, hundreds upon hundreds--beyond the turn in the\r\nroad they still keep coming, marching with the faltering step, the\r\nunseeing look and the incessant, senseless chatter that betrays the\r\ndarkened mind. The lunatic women of the Blackwell's Island Asylum are\r\ntaking their afternoon walk. Beyond, on the wide lawn, moves another\r\nstill stranger procession, a file of women in the asylum dress of dull\r\ngray, hitched to a queer little wagon that, with its gaudy adornments,\r\nsuggests a cross between a baby-carriage and a circus-chariot. One\r\ncrazy woman is strapped in the seat; forty tug at the rope to which\r\nthey are securely bound. This is the \"chain-gang,\" so called once\r\nin scoffing ignorance of the humane purpose the contrivance serves.\r\nThese are the patients afflicted with suicidal mania, who cannot be\r\ntrusted at large for a moment with the river in sight, yet must have\r\ntheir daily walk as a necessary part of their treatment. So this wagon\r\nwas invented by a clever doctor to afford them at once exercise and\r\namusement. A merry-go-round in the grounds suggests a variation of this\r\nscheme. Ghastly suggestion of mirth, with that stricken host advancing\r\non its aimless journey! As we stop to see it pass, the plaintive\r\nstrains of a familiar song float through a barred window in the gray\r\nstone building. The voice is sweet, but inexpressibly sad: \"Oh, how my\r\nheart grows weary, far from----\" The song breaks off suddenly in a low,\r\ntroubled laugh. She has forgotten, forgotten----. A woman in the ranks,\r\nwhose head has been turned toward the window, throws up her hands\r\nwith a scream. The rest stir uneasily. The nurse is by her side in\r\nan instant with words half soothing, half stern. A messenger comes in\r\nhaste from the asylum to ask us not to stop. Strangers may not linger\r\nwhere the patients pass. It is apt to excite them. As we go in with him\r\nthe human file is passing yet, quiet restored. The troubled voice of\r\nthe unseen singer still gropes vainly among the lost memories of the\r\npast for the missing key: \"Oh! how my heart grows weary, far from----\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is she, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hopeless case. She will never see home again.\"\r\n\r\nAn average of seventeen hundred women this asylum harbors; the asylum\r\nfor men up on Ward's Island even more. Altogether 1,419 patients\r\nwere admitted to the city asylums for the insane in 1889, and at the\r\nend of the year 4,913 remained in them. There is a constant ominous\r\nincrease in this class of helpless unfortunates that are thrown on\r\nthe city's charity. Quite two hundred are added year by year, and the\r\nasylums were long since so overcrowded that a great \"farm\" had to\r\nbe established on Long Island to receive the surplus. The strain of\r\nour hurried, over-worked life has something to do with this. Poverty\r\nhas more. For these are all of the poor. It is the harvest of sixty\r\nand a hundred-fold, the \"fearful rolling up and rolling down from\r\ngeneration to generation, through all the ages, of the weakness, vice,\r\nand moral darkness of the past.\"[23] The curse of the island haunts\r\nall that come once within its reach. \"No man or woman,\" says Dr. Louis\r\nL. Seaman, who speaks from many years' experience in a position that\r\ngave him full opportunity to observe the facts, \"who is 'sent up' to\r\nthese colonies ever returns to the city scot-free. There is a lien,\r\nvisible or hidden, upon his or her present or future, which too often\r\nproves stronger than the best purposes and fairest opportunities of\r\nsocial rehabilitation. The under world holds in rigorous bondage every\r\nunfortunate or miscreant who has once 'served time.' There is often\r\ntragic interest in the struggles of the ensnared wretches to break\r\naway from the meshes spun about them. But the maelstrom has no bowels\r\nof mercy; and the would-be fugitives are flung back again and again\r\ninto the devouring whirlpool of crime and poverty, until the end is\r\nreached on the dissecting-table, or in the Potter's Field. What can the\r\nmoralist or scientist do by way of resuscitation? Very little at best.\r\nThe flotsam and jetsam are mere shreds and fragments of wasted lives.\r\nSuch a ministry must begin at the sources--is necessarily prophylactic,\r\nnutritive, educational. On these islands there are no flexible twigs,\r\nonly gnarled, blasted, blighted trunks, insensible to moral or social\r\ninfluences.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Dr. Louis L. Seaman, late chief of staff of the\r\nBlackwell's Island hospitals: \"Social Waste of a Great City,\" read\r\nbefore the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1886.]\r\n\r\nSad words, but true. The commonest keeper soon learns to pick out\r\nalmost at sight the \"cases\" that will leave the penitentiary, the\r\nworkhouse, the almshouse, only to return again and again, each time\r\nmore hopeless, to spend their wasted lives in the bondage of the island.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic cells in Bellevue Hospital are a way-station for a goodly\r\nshare of them on their journeys back and forth across the East River.\r\nLast year they held altogether 3,694 prisoners, considerably more\r\nthan one-fourth of the whole number of 13,813 patients that went in\r\nthrough the hospital gates. The daily average of \"cases\" in this, the\r\nhospital of the poor, is over six hundred. The average daily census of\r\nall the prisons, hospitals, workhouses, and asylums in the charge of\r\nthe Department of Charities and Correction last year was about 14,000,\r\nand about one employee was required for every ten of this army to keep\r\nits machinery running smoothly. The total number admitted in 1889 to\r\nall the jails and institutions in the city and on the islands was\r\n138,332. To the almshouse alone 38,600 were admitted; 9,765 were there\r\nto start the new year with, and 553 were born with the dark shadow of\r\nthe poorhouse overhanging their lives, making a total of 48,918. In\r\nthe care of all their wards the commissioners expended $2,343,372. The\r\nappropriation for the police force in 1889 was $4,409,550.94, and for\r\nthe criminal courts and their machinery $403,190. Thus the first cost\r\nof maintaining our standing army of paupers, criminals, and sick poor,\r\nby direct taxation, was last year $7,156,112.94.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                        THE MAN WITH THE KNIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man stood at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fourteenth Street the\r\nother day, looking gloomily at the carriages that rolled by, carrying\r\nthe wealth and fashion of the avenues to and from the big stores down\r\ntown. He was poor, and hungry, and ragged. This thought was in his\r\nmind: \"They behind their well-fed teams have no thought for the morrow;\r\nthey know hunger only by name, and ride down to spend in an hour's\r\nshopping what would keep me and my little ones from want a whole year.\"\r\nThere rose up before him the picture of those little ones crying for\r\nbread around the cold and cheerless hearth--then he sprang into the\r\nthrong and slashed about him with a knife, blindly seeking to kill, to\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nThe man was arrested, of course, and locked up. To-day he is probably\r\nin a mad-house, forgotten. And the carriages roll by to and from the\r\nbig stores with their gay throng of shoppers. The world forgets easily,\r\ntoo easily, what it does not like to remember.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the man and his knife had a mission. They spoke in their\r\nignorant, impatient way the warning one of the most conservative,\r\ndispassionate of public bodies had sounded only a little while\r\nbefore: \"Our only fear is that reform may come in a burst of public\r\nindignation destructive to property and to good morals.\"[24] They\r\nrepresented, one solution of the problem of ignorant poverty _versus_\r\nignorant wealth that has come down to us unsolved, the danger-cry\r\nof which we have lately heard in the shout that never should have\r\nbeen raised on American soil--the shout of \"the masses against the\r\nclasses\"--the solution of violence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Forty-fourth Annual Report of the Association for\r\nImproving the Condition of the Poor. 1887.]\r\n\r\nThere is another solution, that of justice. The choice is between the\r\ntwo. Which shall it be?\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" say some well-meaning people; \"we don't see the need of putting\r\nit in that way. We have been down among the tenements, looked them\r\nover. There are a good many people there; they are not comfortable,\r\nperhaps. What would you have? They are poor. And their houses are not\r\nsuch hovels as we have seen and read of in the slums of the Old World.\r\nThey are decent in comparison. Why, some of them have brown-stone\r\nfronts. You will own at least that they make a decent show.\"\r\n\r\nYes! that is true. The worst tenements in New York do not, as a rule,\r\n_look bad_. Neither Hell's Kitchen, nor Murderers' Row bears its true\r\ncharacter stamped on the front. They are not quite old enough, perhaps.\r\nThe same is true of their tenants. The New York tough may be ready to\r\nkill where his London brother would do little more than scowl; yet,\r\nas a general thing he is less repulsively brutal in looks. Here again\r\nthe reason may be the same: the breed is not so old. A few generations\r\nmore in the slums, and all that will be changed. To get at the pregnant\r\nfacts of tenement-house life one must look beneath the surface. Many\r\nan apple has a fair skin and a rotten core. There is a much better\r\nargument for the tenements in the assurance of the Registrar of Vital\r\nStatistics that the death-rate of these houses has of late been brought\r\nbelow the general death-rate of the city, and that it is lowest in\r\nthe biggest houses. This means two things: one, that the almost\r\nexclusive attention given to the tenements by the sanitary authorities\r\nin twenty years has borne some fruit, and that the newer tenements\r\nare better than the old--there is some hope in that; the other, that\r\nthe whole strain of tenement-house dwellers has been bred down to the\r\nconditions under which it exists, that the struggle with corruption\r\nhas begotten the power to resist it. This is a familiar law of nature,\r\nnecessary to its first and strongest impulse of self-preservation. To\r\na certain extent, we are all creatures of the conditions that surround\r\nus, physically and morally. But is the knowledge reassuring? In the\r\nlight of what we have seen, does not the question arise: what sort of\r\ncreature, then, this of the tenement? I tried to draw his likeness from\r\nobservation in telling the story of the \"tough.\" Has it nothing to\r\nsuggest the man with the knife?\r\n\r\nI will go further. I am not willing even to admit it to be an\r\nunqualified advantage that our New York tenements have less of the slum\r\nlook than those of older cities. It helps to delay the recognition of\r\ntheir true character on the part of the well-meaning, but uninstructed,\r\nwho are always in the majority.\r\n\r\nThe \"dangerous classes\" of New York long ago compelled recognition.\r\nThey are dangerous less because of their own crimes than because of\r\nthe criminal ignorance of those who are not of their kind. The danger\r\nto society comes not from the poverty of the tenements, but from the\r\nill-spent wealth that reared them, that it might earn a usurious\r\ninterest from a class from which \"nothing else was expected.\" That\r\nwas the broad foundation laid down, and the edifice built upon it\r\ncorresponds to the groundwork. That this is well understood on the\r\n\"unsafe\" side of the line that separates the rich from the poor, much\r\nbetter than by those who have all the advantages of discriminating\r\neducation, is good cause for disquietude. In it a keen foresight may\r\nagain dimly discern the shadow of the man with the knife.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago a great meeting was held at Chickering Hall--I have\r\nspoken of it before--a meeting that discussed for days and nights\r\nthe question how to banish this spectre; how to lay hold with good\r\ninfluences of this enormous mass of more than a million people, who\r\nwere drifting away faster and faster from the safe moorings of the\r\nold faith. Clergymen and laymen from all the Protestant denominations\r\ntook part in the discussion; nor was a good word forgotten for the\r\nbrethren of the other great Christian fold who labor among the poor.\r\nMuch was said that was good and true, and ways were found of reaching\r\nthe spiritual needs of the tenement population that promise success.\r\nBut at no time throughout the conference was the real key-note of\r\nthe situation so boldly struck as has been done by a few far-seeing\r\nbusiness men, who had listened to the cry of that Christian builder:\r\n\"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been\r\nnurtured in sight only of the greed of man?\" Their practical programme\r\nof \"Philanthropy and five per cent.\" has set examples in tenement\r\nbuilding that show, though they are yet few and scattered, what may in\r\ntime be accomplished even with such poor, opportunities as New York\r\noffers to-day of undoing the old wrong. This is the gospel of justice,\r\nthe solution that must be sought as the one alternative to the man\r\nwith the knife.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not looking too much to the material condition of these\r\npeople,\" said a good minister to me after a lecture in a Harlem\r\nchurch last winter, \"and forgetting the inner man?\" I told him, \"No!\r\nfor you cannot expect to find an inner man to appeal to in the worst\r\ntenement-house surroundings. You must first put the man where he can\r\nrespect himself. To reverse the argument of the apple: you cannot\r\nexpect to find a sound core in a rotten fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                          WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn twenty years what has been done in New York to solve the\r\ntenement-house problem?\r\n\r\nThe law has done what it could. That was not always a great deal,\r\nseldom more than barely sufficient for the moment. An aroused municipal\r\nconscience endowed the Health Department with almost autocratic powers\r\nin dealing with this subject, but the desire to educate rather than\r\nforce the community into a better way dictated their exercise with\r\na slow conservatism that did not always seem wise to the impatient\r\nreformer. New York has its St. Antoine, and it has often sadly missed\r\na Napoleon III. to clean up and make light in the dark corners. The\r\nobstacles, too, have been many and great. Nevertheless the authorities\r\nhave not been idle, though it is a grave question whether all the\r\nimprovements made under the sanitary regulations of recent years\r\ndeserve the name. Tenements quite as bad as the worst are too numerous\r\nyet; but one tremendous factor for evil in the lives of the poor has\r\nbeen taken by the throat, and something has unquestionably been done,\r\nwhere that was possible, to lift those lives out of the rut where they\r\nwere equally beyond the reach of hope and of ambition. It is no longer\r\nlawful to construct barracks to cover the whole of a lot. Air and\r\nsunlight have a legal claim, and the day of rear tenements is past.\r\nTwo years ago a hundred thousand people burrowed in these inhuman\r\ndens; but some have been torn down since. Their number will decrease\r\nsteadily until they shall have become a bad tradition of a heedless\r\npast. The dark, unventilated bedroom is going with them, and the open\r\nsewer. The day is at hand when the greatest of all evils that now curse\r\nlife in the tenements--the dearth of water in the hot summer days--will\r\nalso have been remedied, and a long step taken toward the moral and\r\nphysical redemption of their tenants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EVOLUTION OF THE TENEMENT IN TWENTY YEARS.\r\n\r\n                 Old Style Tenement.\r\n\r\n                 Single Lot Tenement of To-day.]\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment has done something also, but very far from enough.\r\nAs a rule, it has slumbered peacefully until some flagrant outrage\r\non decency and the health of the community aroused it to noisy but\r\nephemeral indignation, or until a dreaded epidemic knocked at our door.\r\nIt is this unsteadiness of purpose that has been to a large extent\r\nresponsible for the apparent lagging of the authorities in cases not\r\ninvolving immediate danger to the general health. The law needs a\r\nmuch stronger and readier backing of a thoroughly enlightened public\r\nsentiment to make it as effective as it might be made. It is to be\r\nremembered that the health officers, in dealing with this subject of\r\ndangerous houses, are constantly trenching upon what each landlord\r\nconsiders his private rights, for which he is ready and bound to fight\r\nto the last. Nothing short of the strongest pressure will avail to\r\nconvince him that these individual rights are to be surrendered for\r\nthe clear benefit of the whole. It is easy enough to convince a man\r\nthat he ought not to harbor the thief who steals people's property;\r\nbut to make him see that he has no right to slowly kill his neighbors,\r\nor his tenants, by making a death-trap of his house, seems to be the\r\nhardest of all tasks. It is apparently the slowness of the process that\r\nobscures his mental sight. The man who will fight an order to repair\r\nthe plumbing in his house through every court he can reach, would\r\nsuffer tortures rather than shed the blood of a fellow-man by actual\r\nviolence. Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the\r\nlandlord no less than the tenant.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, the landlord has done his share; chiefly perhaps by\r\nyielding--not always gracefully--when it was no longer of any use to\r\nfight. There have been exceptions, however: men and women who have\r\nmended and built with an eye to the real welfare of their tenants as\r\nwell as to their own pockets. Let it be well understood that the two\r\nare inseparable, if any good is to come of it. The business of housing\r\nthe poor, if it is to amount to anything, must be business, as it was\r\nbusiness with our fathers to put them where they are. As charity,\r\npastime, or fad, it will miserably fail, always and everywhere. This\r\nis an inexorable rule, now thoroughly well understood in England and\r\ncontinental Europe, and by all who have given the matter serious\r\nthought here. Call it poetic justice, or divine justice, or anything\r\nelse, it is a hard fact, not to be gotten over. Upon any other plan\r\nthan the assumption that the workman has a just claim to a decent home,\r\nand the right to demand it, any scheme for his relief fails. It must\r\nbe a fair exchange of the man's money for what he can afford to buy at\r\na reasonable price. Any charity scheme merely turns him into a pauper,\r\nhowever it may be disguised, and drowns him hopelessly in the mire out\r\nof which it proposed to pull him. And this principle must pervade the\r\nwhole plan. Expert management of model tenements succeeds where amateur\r\nmanagement, with the best intentions, gives up the task, discouraged,\r\nas a flat failure. Some of the best-conceived enterprises, backed\r\nby abundant capital and good-will, have been wrecked on this rock.\r\nSentiment, having prompted the effort, forgot to stand aside and let\r\nbusiness make it.\r\n\r\nBusiness, in a wider sense, has done more than all other agencies\r\ntogether to wipe out the worst tenements. It has been New York's real\r\nNapoleon III., from whose decree there was no appeal. In ten years I\r\nhave seen plague-spots disappear before its onward march, with which\r\nhealth officers, police, and sanitary science had struggled vainly\r\nsince such struggling began as a serious business. And the process\r\ngoes on still. Unfortunately, the crowding in some of the most densely\r\npacked quarters down town has made the property there so valuable,\r\nthat relief from this source is less confidently to be expected, at\r\nall events in the near future. Still, their time may come also. It\r\ncomes so quickly sometimes as to fairly take one's breath away. More\r\nthan once I have returned, after a few brief weeks, to some specimen\r\nrookery in which I was interested, to find it gone and an army of\r\nworkmen delving twenty feet underground to lay the foundation of a\r\nmighty warehouse. That was the case with the \"Big Flat\" in Mott Street.\r\nI had not had occasion to visit it for several months last winter, and\r\nwhen I went there, entirely unprepared for a change, I could not find\r\nit. It had always been conspicuous enough in the landscape before, and\r\nI marvelled much at my own stupidity until, by examining the number of\r\nthe house, I found out that I had gone right. It was the \"flat\" that\r\nhad disappeared. In its place towered a six-story carriage factory with\r\nbusiness going on on every floor, as if it had been there for years and\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThis same \"Big Flat\" furnished a good illustration of why some\r\nwell-meant efforts in tenement building have failed. Like Gotham Court,\r\nit was originally built as a model tenement, but speedily came to\r\nrival the Court in foulness. It became a regular hot-bed of thieves\r\nand peace-breakers, and made no end of trouble for the police. The\r\nimmediate reason, outside of the lack of proper supervision, was that\r\nit had open access to two streets in a neighborhood where thieves and\r\n\"toughs\" abounded. These took advantage of an arrangement that had\r\nbeen supposed by the builders to be a real advantage as a means of\r\nventilation, and their occupancy drove honest folk away. Murderers'\r\nAlley, of which I have spoken elsewhere, and the sanitary inspector's\r\nexperiment with building a brick wall athwart it to shut off travel\r\nthrough the block, is a parallel case.\r\n\r\nThe causes that operate to obstruct efforts to better the lot of\r\nthe tenement population are, in our day, largely found among the\r\ntenants themselves. This is true particularly of the poorest. They\r\nare shiftless, destructive, and stupid; in a word, they are what the\r\ntenements have made them. It is a dreary old truth that those who would\r\nfight for the poor must fight the poor to do it. It must be confessed\r\nthat there is little enough in their past experience to inspire\r\nconfidence in the sincerity of the effort to help them. I recall the\r\ndiscomfiture of a certain well-known philanthropist, since deceased,\r\nwhose heart beat responsive to other suffering than that of human\r\nkind. He was a large owner of tenement property, and once undertook\r\nto fit out his houses with stationary tubs, sanitary plumbing,\r\nwood-closets, and all the latest improvements. He introduced his rough\r\ntenants to all this magnificence without taking the precaution of\r\nproviding a competent housekeeper, to see that the new acquaintances\r\ngot on together. He felt that his tenants ought to be grateful for\r\nthe interest he took in them. They were. They found the boards in the\r\nwood-closets fine kindling wood, while the pipes and faucets were as\r\ngood as cash at the junk shop. In three months the owner had to remove\r\nwhat was left of his improvements. The pipes were cut and the houses\r\nrunning full of water, the stationary tubs were put to all sorts of\r\nuses except washing, and of the wood-closets not a trace was left. The\r\nphilanthropist was ever after a firm believer in the total depravity\r\nof tenement-house people. Others have been led to like reasoning by\r\nas plausible arguments, without discovering that the shiftlessness\r\nand ignorance that offended them were the consistent crop of the\r\ntenement they were trying to reform, and had to be included in the\r\neffort. The owners of a block of model tenements uptown had got their\r\ntenants comfortably settled, and were indulging in high hopes of their\r\nredemption under proper management, when a contractor ran up a row of\r\n\"skin\" tenements, shaky but fair to look at, with brown-stone trimmings\r\nand gewgaws. The result was to tempt a lot of the well-housed tenants\r\naway. It was a very astonishing instance of perversity to the planners\r\nof the benevolent scheme; but, after all, there was nothing strange in\r\nit. It is all a matter of education, as I said about the landlord.\r\n\r\nThat the education comes slowly need excite no surprise. The forces\r\non the other side are ever active. The faculty of the tenement for\r\nappropriating to itself every foul thing that comes within its reach,\r\nand piling up and intensifying its corruption until out of all\r\nproportion to the beginning, is something marvellous. Drop a case of\r\nscarlet fever, of measles, or of diphtheria into one of these barracks,\r\nand, unless it is caught at the very start and stamped out, the\r\ncontagion of the one case will sweep block after block, and half people\r\na graveyard. Let the police break up a vile dive, goaded by the angry\r\nprotests of the neighborhood--forthwith the outcasts set in circulation\r\nby the raid betake themselves to the tenements, where in their hired\r\nrooms, safe from interference, they set up as many independent centres\r\nof contagion, infinitely more destructive, each and every one, than was\r\nthe known dive before. I am not willing to affirm that this is the\r\npolice reason for letting so many of the dives alone; but it might well\r\nbe. They are perfectly familiar with the process, and entirely helpless\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\nThis faculty, as inherent in the problem itself--the prodigious\r\nincrease of the tenement-house population that goes on without\r\ncessation, and its consequent greater crowding--is the chief obstacle\r\nto its solution. In 1869 there were 14,872 tenements in New York, with\r\na population of 468,492 persons. In 1879 the number of the tenements\r\nwas estimated at 21,000, and their tenants had passed the half-million\r\nmark. At the end of the year 1888, when a regular census was made for\r\nthe first time since 1869, the showing was: 32,390 tenements, with\r\na population of 1,093,701 souls. To-day we have 37,316 tenements,\r\nincluding 2,630 rear houses, and their population is over 1,250,000. A\r\nlarge share of this added population, especially of that which came to\r\nus from abroad, crowds in below Fourteenth Street, where the population\r\nis already packed beyond reason, and confounds all attempts to make\r\nmatters better there. At the same time new slums are constantly growing\r\nup uptown, and have to be kept down with a firm hand. This drift of\r\nthe population to the great cities has to be taken into account as a\r\nsteady factor. It will probably increase rather than decrease for many\r\nyears to come. At the beginning of the century the percentage of our\r\npopulation that lived in cities was as one in twenty-five. In 1880\r\nit was one in four and one-half, and in 1890 the census will in all\r\nprobability show it to be one in four. Against such tendencies, in\r\nthe absence of suburban outlets for the crowding masses, all remedial\r\nmeasures must prove more or less ineffective. The \"confident belief\"\r\nexpressed by the Board of Health in 1874, that rapid transit would\r\nsolve the problem, is now known to have been a vain hope.\r\n\r\nWorkingmen, in New York at all events, will live near their work, no\r\nmatter at what sacrifice of comfort--one might almost say at whatever\r\ncost, and the city will never be less crowded than it is. To distribute\r\nthe crowds as evenly as possible is the effort of the authorities,\r\nwhere nothing better can be done. In the first six months of the\r\npresent year 1,068 persons were turned out of not quite two hundred\r\ntenements below Houston Street by the sanitary police on their midnight\r\ninspections, and this covered only a very small part of that field. The\r\nuptown tenements were practically left to take care of themselves in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nThe quick change of economic conditions in the city that often\r\nout-paces all plans of relief, rendering useless to-day what met the\r\ndemands of the situation well enough yesterday, is another cause of\r\nperplexity. A common obstacle also--I am inclined to think quite as\r\ncommon as in Ireland, though we hear less of it in the newspapers--is\r\nthe absentee landlord. The home article, who fights for his rights,\r\nas he chooses to consider them, is bad enough; but the absentee\r\nlandlord is responsible for no end of trouble. He was one of the first\r\nobstructions the sanitary reformers stumbled over, when the Health\r\nDepartment took hold. It reported in 1869 that many of the tenants were\r\nentirely uncared for, and that the only answer to their requests to\r\nhave the houses put in order was an invitation to pay their rent or get\r\nout. \"Inquiry often disclosed the fact that the owner of the property\r\nwas a wealthy gentleman or lady, either living in an aristocratic part\r\nof the city, or in a neighboring city, or, as was occasionally found to\r\nbe the case, in Europe. The property is usually managed entirely by\r\nan agent, whose instructions are simple but emphatic: Collect the rent\r\nin advance, or, failing, eject the occupants.\" The Committee having\r\nthe matter in charge proposed to compel owners of tenements with ten\r\nfamilies or more to put a housekeeper in the house, who should be held\r\nresponsible to the Health Department. Unluckily the powers of the Board\r\ngave out at that point, and the proposition was never acted upon. Could\r\nit have been, much trouble would have been spared the Health Board,\r\nand untold suffering the tenants in many houses. The tribe of absentee\r\nlandlords is by no means extinct in New York. Not a few who fled from\r\nacross the sea to avoid being crushed by his heel there have groaned\r\nunder it here, scarcely profiting by the exchange. Sometimes--it can\r\nhardly be said in extenuation--the heel that crunches is applied in\r\nsaddening ignorance. I recall the angry indignation of one of these\r\nabsentee landlords, a worthy man who, living far away in the country,\r\nhad inherited city property, when he saw the condition of his slum\r\ntenements. The man was shocked beyond expression, all the more because\r\nhe did not know whom to blame except himself for the state of things\r\nthat had aroused his wrath, and yet, conscious of the integrity of his\r\nintentions, felt that he should not justly be held responsible.\r\n\r\nThe experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the\r\nlaw failed to supply to the early reformers. It has since been fully\r\ndemonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best\r\nand the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm\r\nhand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme.\r\nThis is a plain business proposition, that has been proved entirely\r\nsound in some notable instances of tenement building, of which more\r\nhereafter. Even among the poorer tenements, those are always the best\r\nin which the owner himself lives. It is a hopeful sign in any case.\r\nThe difficulty of procuring such assistance without having to pay a\r\nruinous price, is one of the obstructions that have vexed in this city\r\nefforts to solve the problem of housing the poor properly, because it\r\npresupposes that the effort must be made on a larger scale than has\r\noften been attempted.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which the tenants respond to intelligent efforts\r\nin their behalf, when made under fair conditions, is as surprising as\r\nit is gratifying, and fully proves the claim that tenants are only\r\nsatisfied in filthy and unwholesome surroundings because nothing better\r\nis offered. The moral effect is as great as the improvement of their\r\nphysical health. It is clearly discernible in the better class of\r\ntenement dwellers to-day. The change in the character of the colored\r\npopulation in the few years since it began to move out of the wicked\r\nrookeries of the old \"Africa\" to the decent tenements in Yorkville,\r\nfurnishes a notable illustration, and a still better one is found in\r\nthe contrast between the model tenement in the Mulberry Street Bend and\r\nthe barracks across the way, of which I spoke in the chapter devoted to\r\nthe Italian. The Italian himself is the strongest argument of all. With\r\nhis fatal contentment in the filthiest surroundings, he gives undoubted\r\nevidence of having in him the instinct of cleanliness that, properly\r\ncultivated, would work his rescue in a very little while. It is a queer\r\ncontradiction, but the fact is patent to anyone who has observed the\r\nman in his home-life. And he is not alone in this. I came across an\r\ninstance, this past summer, of how a refined, benevolent personality\r\nworks like a leaven in even the roughest tenement-house crowd. This\r\nwas no model tenement; far from it. It was a towering barrack in the\r\nTenth Ward, sheltering more than twenty families. All the light and air\r\nthat entered its interior came through an air-shaft two feet square,\r\nupon which two bedrooms and the hall gave in every story. In three\r\nyears I had known of two domestic tragedies, prompted by poverty and\r\njustifiable disgust with life, occurring in the house, and had come\r\nto look upon it as a typically bad tenement, quite beyond the pale\r\nof possible improvement. What was my surprise, when chance led me to\r\nit once more after a while, to find the character of the occupants\r\nentirely changed. Some of the old ones were there still, but they did\r\nnot seem to be the same people. I discovered the secret to be the new\r\nhousekeeper, a tidy, mild-mannered, but exceedingly strict little body,\r\nwho had a natural faculty of drawing her depraved surroundings within\r\nthe beneficent sphere of her strong sympathy, and withal of exacting\r\nrespect for her orders. The worst elements had been banished from the\r\nhouse in short order under her management, and for the rest a new era\r\nof self-respect had dawned. They were, as a body, as vastly superior to\r\nthe general run of their class as they had before seemed below it. And\r\nthis had been effected in the short space of a single year.\r\n\r\nMy observations on this point are more than confirmed by those of\r\nnearly all the practical tenement reformers I have known, who have\r\npatiently held to the course they had laid down. One of these, whose\r\nexperience exceeds that of all of the rest together, and whose\r\ninfluence for good has been very great, said to me recently: \"I hold\r\nthat not ten per cent. of the people now living in tenements would\r\nrefuse to avail themselves of the best improved conditions offered,\r\nand come fully up to the use of them, properly instructed; but they\r\ncannot get them. They are up to them now, fully, if the chances were\r\nonly offered. They don't have to come up. It is all a gigantic mistake\r\non the part of the public, of which these poor people are the victims.\r\nI have built homes for more than five hundred families in fourteen\r\nyears, and I have been getting daily more faith in human nature from\r\nmy work among the poor tenants, though approaching that nature on a\r\nplane and under conditions that could scarcely promise better for\r\ndisappointment.\" It is true that my friend has built his houses in\r\nBrooklyn; but human nature does not differ greatly on the two shores of\r\nthe East River. For those who think it does, it may be well to remember\r\nthat only five years ago the Tenement House Commission summed up the\r\nsituation in this city in the declaration that, \"the condition of the\r\ntenants is in advance of the houses which they occupy,\" quite the\r\nseverest arraignment of the tenement that had yet been uttered.\r\n\r\nThe many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few\r\nyears to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes\r\nwhere many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their\r\neffect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will\r\nmake plainer sailing for future builders of model tenements. In\r\nmany ways, as in the \"College Settlement\" of courageous girls, the\r\nNeighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of the King's Daughters,\r\nand numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and\r\nthe well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day\r\ncompanionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the\r\none who gives no less than to the one who receives. And thus, as a good\r\nlady wrote to me once, though the problem stands yet unsolved, more\r\nperplexing than ever; though the bright spots in the dreary picture\r\nbe too often bright only by comparison, and many of the expedients hit\r\nupon for relief sad makeshifts, we can dimly discern behind it all that\r\ngood is somehow working out of even this slough of despond the while\r\nit is deepening and widening in our sight, and in His own good season,\r\nif we labor on with courage and patience, will bear fruit sixty and a\r\nhundred fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                          HOW THE CASE STANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the bald facts with which we have to deal in New York?\r\n\r\nI. That we have a tremendous, ever swelling crowd of wage-earners which\r\nit is our business to house decently.\r\n\r\nII. That it is not housed decently.\r\n\r\nIII. That it must be so housed _here_ for the present, and for a long\r\ntime to come, all schemes of suburban relief being as yet utopian,\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nIV. That it pays high enough rents to entitle it to be so housed, as a\r\nright.\r\n\r\nV. That nothing but our own slothfulness is in the way of so housing\r\nit, since \"the condition of the tenants is in advance of the condition\r\nof the houses which they occupy\" (Report of Tenement-house Commission).\r\n\r\nVI. That the security of the one no less than of the other half\r\ndemands, on sanitary, moral, and economic grounds, that it be decently\r\nhoused.\r\n\r\nVII. That it will pay to do it. As an investment, I mean, and in hard\r\ncash. This I shall immediately proceed to prove.\r\n\r\nVIII. That the tenement has come to stay, and must itself be the\r\nsolution of the problem with which it confronts us.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact from which we cannot get away, however we may deplore\r\nit. Doubtless the best would be to get rid of it altogether; but as\r\nwe cannot, all argument on that score may at this time be dismissed as\r\nidle. The practical question is what to do with the tenement. I watched\r\na Mott Street landlord, the owner of a row of barracks that have\r\nmade no end of trouble for the health authorities for twenty years,\r\nsolve that question for himself the other day. His way was to give\r\nthe wretched pile a coat of paint, and put a gorgeous tin cornice on\r\nwith the year 1890 in letters a yard long. From where I stood watching\r\nthe operation, I looked down upon the same dirty crowds camping on\r\nthe roof, foremost among them an Italian mother with two stark-naked\r\nchildren who had apparently never made the acquaintance of a wash-tub.\r\nThat was a landlord's way, and will not get us out of the mire.\r\n\r\nThe \"flat\" is another way that does not solve the problem. Rather, it\r\nextends it. The flat is not a model, though it is a modern, tenement.\r\nIt gets rid of some of the nuisances of the low tenement, and of the\r\nworst of them, the overcrowding--if it gets rid of them at all--at\r\na cost that takes it at once out of the catalogue of \"homes for the\r\npoor,\" while imposing some of the evils from which they suffer upon\r\nthose who ought to escape from them.\r\n\r\nThere are three effective ways of dealing with the tenements in New\r\nYork:\r\n\r\nI. By law.\r\n\r\nII. By remodelling and making the most out of the old houses.\r\n\r\nIII. By building new, model tenements.\r\n\r\nPrivate enterprise--conscience, to put it in the category of duties,\r\nwhere it belongs--must do the lion's share under these last two\r\nheads. Of what the law has effected I have spoken already. The\r\ndrastic measures adopted in Paris, in Glasgow, and in London are not\r\npracticable here on anything like as large a scale. Still it can, under\r\nstrong pressure of public opinion, rid us of the worst plague-spots.\r\nThe Mulberry Street Bend will go the way of the Five Points when all\r\nthe red tape that binds the hands of municipal effort has been unwound.\r\nPrizes were offered in public competition, some years ago, for the best\r\nplans of modern tenement-houses. It may be that we shall see the day\r\nwhen the building of model tenements will be encouraged by subsidies\r\nin the way of a rebate of taxes. Meanwhile the arrest and summary\r\npunishment of landlords, or their agents, who persistently violate\r\nlaw and decency, will have a salutary effect. If a few of the wealthy\r\nabsentee landlords, who are the worst offenders, could be got within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the city, and by arrest be compelled to employ\r\nproper overseers, it would be a proud day for New York. To remedy the\r\novercrowding, with which the night inspections of the sanitary police\r\ncannot keep step, tenements may eventually have to be licensed, as now\r\nthe lodging-houses, to hold so many tenants, and no more; or the State\r\nmay have to bring down the rents that cause the crowding, by assuming\r\nthe right to regulate them as it regulates the fares on the elevated\r\nroads. I throw out the suggestion, knowing quite well that it is open\r\nto attack. It emanated originally from one of the brightest minds that\r\nhave had to struggle officially with this tenement-house question in\r\nthe last ten years. In any event, to succeed, reform by law must aim\r\nat making it unprofitable to own a bad tenement. At best, it is apt to\r\ntravel at a snail's pace, while the enemy it pursues is putting the\r\nbest foot foremost.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of profit the law ought to have its strongest ally in\r\nthe landlord himself, though the reverse is the case. This condition\r\nof things I believe to rest on a monstrous error. It cannot be that\r\ntenement property that is worth preserving at all can continue to yield\r\nlarger returns, if allowed to run down, than if properly cared for\r\nand kept in good repair. The point must be reached, and soon, where\r\nthe cost of repairs, necessary with a house full of the lowest, most\r\nignorant tenants, must overbalance the saving of the first few years\r\nof neglect; for this class is everywhere the most destructive, as well\r\nas the poorest paying. I have the experience of owners, who have found\r\nthis out to their cost, to back me up in the assertion, even if it\r\nwere not the statement of a plain business fact that proves itself. I\r\ndo not include tenement property that is deliberately allowed to fall\r\ninto decay because at some future time the ground will be valuable\r\nfor business or other purposes. There is unfortunately enough of that\r\nkind in New York, often leasehold property owned by wealthy estates or\r\nsoul-less corporations that oppose all their great influence to the\r\nefforts of the law in behalf of their tenants.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence, on the other hand, that it can be made to\r\npay to improve and make the most of the worst tenement property, even\r\nin the most wretched locality. The example set by Miss Ellen Collins\r\nin her Water Street houses will always stand as a decisive answer to\r\nall doubts on this point. It is quite ten years since she bought three\r\nold tenements at the corner of Water and Roosevelt Streets, then as now\r\none of the lowest localities in the city. Since then she has leased\r\nthree more adjoining her purchase, and so much of Water Street has at\r\nall events been purified. Her first effort was to let in the light\r\nin the hallways, and with the darkness disappeared, as if by magic,\r\nthe heaps of refuse that used to be piled up beside the sinks. A\r\nfew of the most refractory tenants disappeared with them, but a very\r\nconsiderable proportion stayed, conforming readily to the new rules,\r\nand are there yet. It should here be stated that Miss Collins's tenants\r\nare distinctly of the poorest. Her purpose was to experiment with this\r\nclass, and her experiment has been more than satisfactory. Her plan\r\nwas, as she puts it herself, fair play between tenant and landlord.\r\nTo this end the rents were put as low as consistent with the idea of\r\na business investment that must return a reasonable interest to be\r\nsuccessful. The houses were thoroughly refitted with proper plumbing. A\r\ncompetent janitor was put in charge to see that the rules were observed\r\nby the tenants, when Miss Collins herself was not there. Of late years\r\nshe has had to give very little time to personal superintendence, and\r\nthe care-taker told me only the other day that very little was needed.\r\nThe houses seemed to run themselves in the groove once laid down. Once\r\nthe reputed haunt of thieves, they have become the most orderly in the\r\nneighborhood. Clothes are left hanging on the lines all night with\r\nimpunity, and the pretty flower-beds in the yard where the children\r\nnot only from the six houses, but of the whole block, play, skip, and\r\nswing, are undisturbed. The tenants, by the way, provide the flowers\r\nthemselves in the spring, and take all the more pride in them because\r\nthey are their own. The six houses contain forty-five families, and\r\nthere \"has never been any need of putting up a bill.\" As to the income\r\nfrom the property, Miss Collins said to me last August: \"I have had six\r\nand even six and three-quarters per cent. on the capital invested; on\r\nthe whole, you may safely say five and a half per cent. This I regard\r\nas entirely satisfactory.\" It should be added that she has persistently\r\nrefused to let the corner-store, now occupied by a butcher, as a\r\nsaloon; or her income from it might have been considerably increased.\r\n\r\nMiss Collins's experience is of value chiefly as showing what can be\r\naccomplished with the worst possible material, by the sort of personal\r\ninterest in the poor that alone will meet their real needs. All the\r\ncharity in the world, scattered with the most lavish hand, will not\r\ntake its place. \"Fair play\" between landlord and tenant is the key, too\r\nlong mislaid, that unlocks the door to success everywhere as it did\r\nfor Miss Collins. She has not lacked imitators whose experience has\r\nbeen akin to her own. The case of Gotham Court has been already cited.\r\nOn the other hand, instances are not wanting of landlords who have\r\nundertaken the task, but have tired of it or sold their property before\r\nit had been fully redeemed, with the result that it relapsed into its\r\nformer bad condition faster than it had improved, and the tenants with\r\nit. I am inclined to think that such houses are liable to fall even\r\nbelow the average level. Backsliding in brick and mortar does not\r\ngreatly differ from similar performances in flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nBacked by a strong and steady sentiment, such as these pioneers have\r\nevinced, that would make it the personal business of wealthy owners\r\nwith time to spare to look after their tenants, the law would be\r\nable in a very short time to work a salutary transformation in the\r\nworst quarters, to the lasting advantage, I am well persuaded, of the\r\nlandlord no less than the tenant. Unfortunately, it is in this quality\r\nof personal effort that the sentiment of interest in the poor, upon\r\nwhich we have to depend, is too often lacking. People who are willing\r\nto give money feel that that ought to be enough. It is not. The money\r\nthus given is too apt to be wasted along with the sentiment that\r\nprompted the gift.\r\n\r\nEven when it comes to the third of the ways I spoke of as effective\r\nin dealing with the tenement-house problem, the building of model\r\nstructures, the personal interest in the matter must form a large share\r\nof the capital invested, if it is to yield full returns. Where that\r\nis the case, there is even less doubt about its paying, with ordinary\r\nbusiness management, than in the case of reclaiming an old building,\r\nwhich is, like putting life into a defunct newspaper, pretty apt to\r\nbe up-hill work. Model tenement building has not been attempted in\r\nNew York on anything like as large a scale as in many other great\r\ncities, and it is perhaps owing to this, in a measure, that a belief\r\nprevails that it cannot succeed here. This is a wrong notion entirely.\r\nThe various undertakings of that sort that have been made here under\r\nintelligent management have, as far as I know, all been successful.\r\n\r\nFrom the managers of the two best-known experiments in model tenement\r\nbuilding in the city, the Improved Dwellings Association and the\r\nTenement-house Building Company, I have letters dated last August,\r\ndeclaring their enterprises eminently successful. There is no reason\r\nwhy their experience should not be conclusive. That the Philadelphia\r\nplan is not practicable in New York is not a good reason why our own\r\nplan, which is precisely the reverse of our neighbor's, should not\r\nbe. In fact it is an argument for its success. The very reason why\r\nwe cannot house our working masses in cottages, as has been done in\r\nPhiladelphia--viz., that they must live on Manhattan Island, where\r\nthe land is too costly for small houses--is the best guarantee of the\r\nsuccess of the model tenement house, properly located and managed.\r\nThe drift in tenement building, as in everything else, is toward\r\nconcentration, and helps smooth the way. Four families on the floor,\r\ntwenty in the house, is the rule of to-day. As the crowds increase,\r\nthe need of guiding this drift into safe channels becomes more urgent.\r\nThe larger the scale upon which the model tenement is planned, the\r\nmore certain the promise of success. The utmost ingenuity cannot\r\nbuild a house for sixteen or twenty families on a lot 25 × 100 feet\r\nin the middle of a block like it, that shall give them the amount\r\nof air and sunlight to be had by the erection of a dozen or twenty\r\nhouses on a common plan around a central yard. This was the view\r\nof the committee that awarded the prizes for the best plan for the\r\nconventional tenement, ten years ago. It coupled its verdict with the\r\nemphatic declaration that, in its view, it was \"impossible to secure\r\nthe requirements of physical and moral health within these narrow and\r\narbitrary limits.\" Houses have been built since on better plans than\r\nany the committee saw, but its judgment stands unimpaired. A point,\r\ntoo, that is not to be overlooked, is the reduced cost of expert\r\nsuperintendence--the first condition of successful management--in the\r\nlarger buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Improved Dwellings Association put up its block of thirteen houses\r\nin East Seventy-second Street nine years ago. Their cost, estimated at\r\nabout $240,000 with the land, was increased to $285,000 by troubles\r\nwith the contractor engaged to build them. Thus the Association's task\r\ndid not begin under the happiest auspices. Unexpected expenses came\r\nto deplete its treasury. The neighborhood was new and not crowded at\r\nthe start. No expense was spared, and the benefit of all the best and\r\nmost recent experience in tenement building was given to the tenants.\r\nThe families were provided with from two to four rooms, all \"outer\"\r\nrooms, of course, at rents ranging from $14 per month for the four\r\non the ground floor, to $6.25 for two rooms on the top floor. Coal\r\nlifts, ash-chutes, common laundries in the basement, and free baths,\r\nare features of these buildings that were then new enough to be looked\r\nupon with suspicion by the doubting Thomases who predicted disaster.\r\nThere are rooms in the block for 218 families, and when I looked in\r\nrecently all but nine of the apartments were let. One of the nine was\r\nrented while I was in the building. The superintendent told me that\r\nhe had little trouble with disorderly tenants, though the buildings\r\nshelter all sorts of people. Mr. W. Bayard Cutting, the President of\r\nthe Association, writes to me:\r\n\r\n\"By the terms of subscription to the stock before incorporation,\r\ndividends were limited to five per cent. on the stock of the Improved\r\nDwellings Association. These dividends have been paid (two per cent.\r\neach six months) ever since the expiration of the first six months\r\nof the buildings operation. All surplus has been expended upon the\r\nbuildings. New and expensive roofs have been put on for the comfort\r\nof such tenants as might choose to use them. The buildings have been\r\ncompletely painted inside and out in a manner not contemplated at\r\nthe outset. An expensive set of fire-escapes has been put on at the\r\ncommand of the Fire Department, and a considerable number of other\r\nimprovements made. _I regard the experiment as eminently successful and\r\nsatisfactory_, particularly when it is considered that the buildings\r\nwere the first erected in this city upon anything like a large scale,\r\nwhere it was proposed to meet the architectural difficulties that\r\npresent themselves in the tenement-house problem. I have no doubt\r\nthat the experiment could be tried to-day with the improved knowledge\r\nwhich has come with time, and a much larger return be shown upon the\r\ninvestment. The results referred to have been attained in spite of the\r\nprovision which prevents the selling of liquor upon the Association's\r\npremises. You are aware, of course, how much larger rent can be\r\nobtained for a liquor saloon than for an ordinary store. An investment\r\nat five per cent. net upon real estate security worth more than the\r\nprincipal sum, ought to be considered desirable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tenement House Building Company made its \"experiment\" in a much\r\nmore difficult neighborhood, Cherry Street, some six years later.\r\nIts houses shelter many Russian Jews, and the difficulty of keeping\r\nthem in order is correspondingly increased, particularly as there are\r\nno ash-chutes in the houses. It has been necessary even to shut the\r\nchildren out of the yards upon which the kitchen windows give, lest\r\nthey be struck by something thrown out by the tenants, and killed.\r\nIt is the Cherry Street style, not easily got rid of. Nevertheless,\r\nthe houses are well kept. Of the one hundred and six \"apartments,\"\r\nonly four were vacant in August. Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman,\r\nthe secretary of the company, writes to me: \"The tenements are now\r\na decided success.\" In the three years since they were built, they\r\nhave returned an interest of from five to five and a half per cent.\r\non the capital invested. The original intention of making the tenants\r\nprofit-sharers on a plan of rent insurance, under which all earnings\r\nabove four per cent. would be put to the credit of the tenants, has not\r\nyet been carried out.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GENERAL PLAN OF THE RIVERSIDE BUILDINGS\r\n                 (A. T. WHITE'S) IN BROOKLYN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FLOOR PLAN OF ONE DIVISION IN THE RIVERSIDE\r\n                 BUILDINGS, SHOWING SIX \"APARTMENTS.\"]\r\n\r\nA scheme of dividends to tenants on a somewhat similar plan has\r\nbeen carried out by a Brooklyn builder, Mr. A. T. White, who has\r\ndevoted a life of beneficent activity to tenement building, and whose\r\nexperience, though it has been altogether across the East River, I\r\nregard as justly applying to New York as well. He so regards it\r\nhimself. Discussing the cost of building, he says: \"There is not the\r\nslightest reason to doubt that the financial result of a similar\r\nundertaking in any tenement-house district of New York City would be\r\nequally good.... High cost of land is no detriment, provided the value\r\nis made by the pressure of people seeking residence there. Rents in\r\nNew York City bear a higher ratio to Brooklyn rents than would the\r\ncost of land and building in the one city to that in the other.\" The\r\nassertion that Brooklyn furnishes a better class of tenants than the\r\ntenement districts in New York would not be worth discussing seriously,\r\neven if Mr. White did not meet it himself with the statement that the\r\nproportion of day-laborers and sewing-women in his houses is greater\r\nthan in any of the London model tenements, showing that they reach the\r\nhumblest classes.\r\n\r\nMr. White has built homes for five hundred poor families since he began\r\nhis work, and has made it pay well enough to allow good tenants a share\r\nin the profits, averaging nearly one month's rent out of the twelve, as\r\na premium upon promptness and order. The plan of his last tenements,\r\nreproduced on p. 292, may be justly regarded as the _beau ideal_ of\r\nthe model tenement for a great city like New York. It embodies all the\r\ngood features of Sir Sydney Waterlow's London plan, with improvements\r\nsuggested by the builder's own experience. Its chief merit is that it\r\ngathers three hundred real homes, not simply three hundred families,\r\nunder one roof. Three tenants, it will be seen, everywhere live\r\ntogether. Of the rest of the three hundred they may never know, rarely\r\nsee, one. Each has his private front-door. The common hall, with all\r\nthat it stands for, has disappeared. The fire-proof stairs are outside\r\nthe house, a perfect fire-escape. Each tenant has his own scullery and\r\nash-flue. There are no air-shafts, for they are not needed. Every room,\r\nunder the admirable arrangement of the plan, looks out either upon\r\nthe street or the yard, that is nothing less than a great park with a\r\nplay-ground set apart for the children, where they may dig in the sand\r\nto their heart's content. Weekly concerts are given in the park by a\r\nbrass band. The drying of clothes is done on the roof, where racks\r\nare fitted up for the purpose. The outside stairways end in turrets\r\nthat give the buildings a very smart appearance. Mr. White never has\r\nany trouble with his tenants, though he gathers in the poorest; nor\r\ndo his tenements have anything of the \"institution character\" that\r\noccasionally attaches to ventures of this sort, to their damage. They\r\nare like a big village of contented people, who live in peace with one\r\nanother because they have elbow-room even under one big roof.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that model tenements can be built\r\nsuccessfully and made to pay in New York, if the owner will be content\r\nwith the five or six per cent. he does not even dream of when investing\r\nhis funds in \"governments\" at three or four. It is true that in the\r\nlatter case he has only to cut off his coupons and cash them. But the\r\nextra trouble of looking after his tenement property, that is the\r\ncondition of his highest and lasting success, is the penalty exacted\r\nfor the sins of our fathers that \"shall be visited upon the children,\r\nunto the third and fourth generation.\" We shall indeed be well off, if\r\nit stop there. I fear there is too much reason to believe that our own\r\niniquities must be added to transmit the curse still further. And yet,\r\nsuch is the leavening influence of a good deed in that dreary desert\r\nof sin and suffering, that the erection of a single good tenement has\r\nthe power to change, gradually but surely, the character of a whole bad\r\nblock. It sets up a standard to which the neighborhood must rise, if it\r\ncannot succeed in dragging it down to its own low level.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so this task, too, has come to an end. Whatsoever a man soweth,\r\nthat shall he also reap. I have aimed to tell the truth as I saw it.\r\nIf this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a\r\nharvest of justice, it has served its purpose. While I was writing\r\nthese lines I went down to the sea, where thousands from the city were\r\nenjoying their summer rest. The ocean slumbered under a cloudless sky.\r\nGentle waves washed lazily over the white sand, where children fled\r\nbefore them with screams of laughter. Standing there and watching their\r\nplay, I was told that during the fierce storms of winter it happened\r\nthat this sea, now so calm, rose in rage and beat down, broke over the\r\nbluff, sweeping all before it. No barrier built by human hands had\r\npower to stay it then. The sea of a mighty population, held in galling\r\nfetters, heaves uneasily in the tenements. Once already our city,\r\nto which have come the duties and responsibilities of metropolitan\r\ngreatness before it was able to fairly measure its task, has felt the\r\nswell of its resistless flood. If it rise once more, no human power\r\nmay avail to check it. The gap between the classes in which it surges,\r\nunseen, unsuspected by the thoughtless, is widening day by day. No\r\ntardy enactment of law, no political expedient, can close it. Against\r\nall other dangers our system of government may offer defence and\r\nshelter; against this not. I know of but one bridge that will carry us\r\nover safe, a bridge founded upon justice and built of human hearts.\r\nI believe that the danger of such conditions as are fast growing up\r\naround us is greater for the very freedom which they mock. The words of\r\nthe poet, with whose lines I prefaced this book, are truer to-day, have\r\nfar deeper meaning to us, than when they were penned forty years ago:\r\n\r\n          \"--Think ye that building shall endure\r\n          Which shelters the noble and crushes the poor?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n              STATISTICS BEARING ON THE TENEMENT PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistics of population were left out of the text in the hope that\r\nthe results of this year's census would be available as a basis for\r\ncalculation before the book went to press. They are now at hand,\r\nbut their correctness is disputed. The statisticians of the Health\r\nDepartment claim that New York's population has been underestimated\r\na hundred thousand at least, and they appear to have the best of the\r\nargument. A re-count is called for, and the printer will not wait.\r\nSuch statistics as follow have been based on the Health Department\r\nestimates, except where the census source is given. The extent of the\r\nquarrel of official figures may be judged from this one fact, that the\r\nordinarily conservative and careful calculations of the Sanitary Bureau\r\nmake the death-rate of New York, in 1889, 25.19 for the thousand of\r\na population of 1,575,073, while the census would make it 26.76 in a\r\npopulation of 1,482,273.\r\n\r\n Population of New York, 1880 (census)
