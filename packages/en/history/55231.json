It thus embraces the central crisis of the whole war,\r\nthe arrival of the French in front of the Lines of Torres Vedras and\r\ntheir first short retreat, after they had realized the impossibility\r\nof forcing that impregnable barrier to their advance. The retreat\r\nthat began at Sobral on the night of Nov. 14, 1810, was to end at\r\nToulouse on April 11, 1814. The armies of the Emperor were never\r\nable to repeat the experiment of 1810, and to assume a general and\r\nvigorous offensive against Wellington and Portugal. In 1811 they\r\nwere on the defensive, despite of certain local and partial attempts\r\nto recover their lost initiative. In 1812 they had to abandon\r\nhalf Spain--Andalusia, Estremadura, Asturias, La Mancha, and much\r\nmore,--despite of Wellington’s temporary check before Burgos. In\r\n1813 they were swept across the Pyrenees and the Bidassoa; in 1814\r\nthey were fighting a losing game in their own land. Rightly then\r\nmay Masséna’s retreat to Santarem be called the beginning of the\r\nend--though it was not for a full year more that Wellington’s final\r\noffensive commenced, with the investment of Ciudad Rodrigo on Jan. 8,\r\n1812.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of Bussaco and Torres Vedras, therefore, marked the\r\nturning-point of the whole war, and I have endeavoured to set forth\r\nits meaning in full detail, devoting special care to the explanation\r\nof Wellington’s triple device for arresting the French advance--his\r\ncombination of the system of devastation, of the raising of the\r\n_levée en masse_ in Portugal, and of the construction of great\r\ndefensive lines in front of Lisbon. Each of these three measures\r\nwould have been incomplete without the other two. For the Lines of\r\nTorres Vedras might not have saved Portugal and Europe from the\r\ndomination of Napoleon, if the invading army had not been surrounded\r\non all sides by the light screen of irregular troops, which cut\r\nits communications, and prevented it from foraging far afield. Nor\r\nwould Masséna have been turned back, if the land through which he\r\nhad advanced had been left unravaged, and if every large village had\r\ncontained enough food to subsist a brigade for a day or a battalion\r\nfor a week.\r\n\r\nThe preparations, the advance, and the retreat of Masséna cover about\r\nhalf of this volume. The rest of it is occupied with the operations\r\nof the French in Northern, Eastern, and Southern Spain--operations\r\nwhich seemed decisive at the moment, but which turned out to be\r\nmere side-issues in the great contest. For Soult’s conquest of\r\nAndalusia, and Suchet’s victories in Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia\r\nonly distracted the imperial generals from their central task--the\r\nexpulsion of Wellington and his army from the Peninsula. Most\r\nreaders will, I think, find a good deal of new information in the\r\naccounts of the siege of Gerona and the battle of Ocaña. The credit\r\ndue to Alvarez for the defence of the Catalonian city has never\r\nbeen properly set forth before in any English history, nor have the\r\ndetails of Areizaga’s miserable campaign in La Mancha been fully\r\nstudied. In particular, the composition and strength of his army have\r\nnever before been elucidated, and Appendices V, VI of this volume\r\nconsist of absolutely unpublished documents.\r\n\r\nI have to offer my grateful thanks to those who have been good\r\nenough to assist me in the writing of this book, by furnishing me\r\nwith stores of private papers, or hitherto unknown official reports.\r\nTwo of the kind helpers who put me on the track of new information\r\nfor the compiling of Volume II have passed away while Volume III\r\nwas in progress. I bitterly regret the loss of my friends General\r\nArteche and Colonel F. A. Whinyates. The former, with his unrivalled\r\nknowledge of the contents of the historical department of the Madrid\r\nWar Office, had enabled me to discover many a lost document of\r\nimportance. The latter had placed at my disposal his copious store\r\nof papers, letters, and diaries relating to his old corps, the Royal\r\nArtillery. In this present section of the history of the war I am\r\nstill using much of the material which he lent me.\r\n\r\nBut new helpers have come to my aid while this volume was being\r\nwritten. To three of them I must express my special gratitude.\r\nThe first is Mr. W. S. M. D’Urban, of Newport House, near Exeter,\r\nwho has furnished me with copies of a collection of papers of\r\nunique interest, the diary and correspondence of his grandfather,\r\nSir Benjamin D’Urban, who served as the Quarter-Master-General\r\nof the Portuguese army, under Marshal Beresford, during the two\r\nyears covered by this section of my history. Thanks to the mass of\r\ndocuments furnished by Mr. D’Urban’s kindness, I am now in a position\r\nto follow the details of the organization, movements, and exploits\r\nof the Portuguese army in a way that had hitherto been impossible to\r\nme. Moreover, Sir Benjamin’s day by day criticisms on the strategy\r\nand tactics both of Masséna and of Wellington have the highest\r\ninterest, as reflecting the opinions of the more intelligent section\r\nof the head-quarters staff. It is noteworthy to find that, while\r\nmany of Wellington’s chief subordinates despaired of the situation\r\nin 1810, there were some who already felt an enthusiastic confidence\r\nin the plans of their leader, so much so that their criticisms\r\nwere reserved for the occasions when, in their opinion, he showed\r\nhimself over-cautious, and refused to take full advantage of the\r\nuncomfortable positions into which he had lured his enemy.\r\n\r\nThe second mass of interesting private papers placed in my hands\r\nof late is the personal correspondence of Nicholas Trant and John\r\nWilson, the two enterprising leaders of Portuguese militia forces,\r\nto whom Wellington had entrusted the cutting off of Masséna’s\r\ncommunication with Spain, and the restriction of his raids for\r\nsustenance to feed his army. These letters have been lent me by\r\nCommander Bertram Chambers of H.M.S. _Resolution_, a collateral\r\nrelative of Wilson. They fill up a gap in the military history of\r\n1810, for no one hitherto had the opportunity of following out in\r\ndetail the doings of these two adventurous soldiers and trusty\r\nfriends, while they were engaged in the difficult task that was set\r\nthem. For a sample of Trant’s breezy style of correspondence, I may\r\nrefer the reader to pages 399-400 of this volume. Unfortunately, when\r\nthe two militia generals were in actual contact, their correspondence\r\nnaturally ceased, so that the series of letters has many _lacunae_.\r\nBut they are nevertheless of the highest value.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I have to thank Sir Henry Le Marchant for a sight of the\r\nprivate papers of his grandfather, the well-known cavalry brigadier,\r\nGeneral John Gaspar Le Marchant, who fell at Salamanca. He did not\r\nland in the Peninsula till 1811, but during the preceding year he was\r\nreceiving many letters of interest, some from his own contemporaries,\r\nofficers of high rank in Wellington’s army, others from younger men,\r\nwho had been his pupils while he was in command of the Military\r\nCollege at High Wycombe. Some of the seniors, and one especially,\r\nwere among those down-hearted men--of the opposite type to Benjamin\r\nD’Urban--who were consistently expecting disaster, and looked for a\r\nhasty embarkation at Lisbon as the natural end of the campaign of\r\n1810. The younger men took a very different view of affairs, and\r\ninvariably sent cheerful accounts of the doings of the army.\r\n\r\nI must mention, once more, kind assistance from the officials of the\r\nHistorical sections of the War Ministries at Paris and at Madrid.\r\nMy friend Commandant Balagny, who gave me so much help during the\r\ncompilation of my second volume, has unfortunately been absent on a\r\nmilitary mission to Brazil during the last three years. But the kind\r\noffices of M. Martinien have continually aided me in getting access\r\nto the particular sections of the Paris archives with which I was\r\nfrom time to time concerned. I must here take the opportunity of\r\nexpressing once more my admiration for his colossal work, the _Liste\r\ndes officiers tués et blessés pendant les Guerres de l’Empire_,\r\nwhich, on the numberless occasions when no casualty-return appears\r\nin the Paris archives, enables one to determine what regiments\r\nwere present at any action, and in what proportion they suffered.\r\nAt Madrid Captain Emilio Figueras has continued his kind services,\r\noffered during the compilation of my second volume, and was\r\nindefatigable in going through the papers of 1810 with me, during my\r\ntwo visits to the Spanish capital.\r\n\r\nAmong my English helpers I must cite with special gratitude four\r\nnames. The first is that of Mr. C. T. Atkinson, Fellow of Exeter\r\nCollege, Oxford, who has read the proofs of the greater part of\r\nthis volume, and given me many valuable corrections and pieces of\r\ninformation, from his wide knowledge of British regimental history.\r\nThe second is that of Major John H. Leslie, R.A., who has compiled\r\nthe Artillery Appendix to this section, corresponding to that which\r\nColonel Whinyates compiled for the last. I am also most grateful to\r\nhim for an early view of the useful ‘Dickson Papers,’ which he is\r\npublishing for the Royal Artillery Institution. The third is that\r\nof the Rev. Alexander Craufurd, who has continued to give me notes\r\non the history of the Light Division, while it was commanded by his\r\ngrandfather, the famous Robert Craufurd. The fourth is that of Mr. C.\r\nE. Doble of the Clarendon Press, who has again read for errors every\r\npage of a long volume.\r\n\r\nLastly, the indefatigable compiler of the Index must receive once\r\nmore my heartfelt thanks for a labour of love.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find several topographical notes appended at the\r\nend of chapters, the results of my first and second tours along the\r\nborderland of Spain and Portugal. Two long visits to the battlefield\r\nof Bussaco, and some days spent between the Coa and the Agueda, and\r\nbehind the Lines of Torres Vedras, gave me many new topographical\r\nfacts of importance. Drives and walks in the Badajoz-Elvas country,\r\nand about Coimbra, also turned out most profitable. But my notes on\r\nthe battlefields of Fuentes d’Oñoro and Albuera can only be utilized\r\nin my next volume, which I trust may not be long in following its\r\npredecessor into print.\r\n\r\nThe spelling of many of the Spanish, and more especially the\r\nPortuguese, names may appear unfamiliar to some readers. But I\r\nbelieve that correctness should be studied above all things, even\r\nthough the results in cases like Bussaco with the double s, Golegão,\r\nor Santa Comba Dao, may produce a momentary shock to the eye.\r\nPortuguese spelling, both in personal names and in topography, was\r\nin a state of flux in 1810. For example, the General commanding the\r\nArtillery always appears as da Rosa in the official army lists, yet\r\nsigned his name da Roza; countless other instances could be produced.\r\nWhere it was possible I have followed the individual’s own version\r\nof his name: he ought to have known best. There are still, no doubt,\r\nerrors of spelling surviving: no man is infallible, but I have done\r\nmy best to reduce them to a minimum.\r\n\r\n    C.

WELLESLEY AND WELLINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the 20th of August, 1809, when Robert Craufurd’s Light\r\nBrigade[1] withdrew from the Bridge of Almaraz, to follow the rest\r\nof the British army across the mountains to the neighbourhood of\r\nBadajoz, and February 27, 1810, when part of that same brigade was\r\nengaged in the first skirmish of Barba del Puerco, not a shot was\r\nfired by any of Wellington’s troops. This gap of over six months in\r\nhis active operations may appear extraordinary, and it was bitterly\r\ncriticized at the time. Between August and March there was hard\r\nfighting both in the south of Spain and along the north-eastern\r\nfrontier of Portugal; but the British army, despite many invitations,\r\ntook no part in it. Wellington adhered to his resolve never to commit\r\nhimself again to a campaign in company with the Spaniards, unless he\r\nshould be placed in a position in which he could be independent of\r\nthe freaks of their government and the perversity of their generals.\r\nTwo months’ experience of the impracticability of Cuesta, of the\r\ndeliberate disobedience of Venegas, of the fruitless promises of\r\nthe commissary-general Lozano de Torres, of the insane demands and\r\nadvice sent in by the Central Junta, had convinced him that he dare\r\nnot risk his army in a second venture such as that which had led\r\nhim to Talavera. If he were made commander-in-chief by the Spanish\r\nGovernment, and granted a free hand in the direction of the Spanish\r\narmies, matters would look different[2]. But there was at present\r\nno chance whatever that he would receive such a mark of confidence.\r\nOnly a small minority of the leading men at Seville could endure with\r\npatience the idea of a British commander-in-chief. Wellington himself\r\nhad long dismissed the project--which Frère had broached in the\r\nspring[3]--as impracticable.\r\n\r\n  [1] Not, it must be remembered, to become the Light _Division_\r\n  till March 1810.\r\n\r\n  [2] See Wellington to Canning, Sept. 5, 1800, in _Dispatches_, v.\r\n  123-4.\r\n\r\n  [3] See vol. ii. pp. 465-6.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French advance had no sooner ceased--after the rather\r\nobjectless combat of Arzobispo--than the Junta began to press upon\r\nthe British general schemes for a resumption of the offensive and\r\na second march toward Madrid. The political situation, and not any\r\nmilitary considerations, was the originating cause of their untimely\r\nactivity. They felt that their authority was waning, that their\r\npopularity had vanished, that their critics were daily growing more\r\nvenomous, and they saw that success in the war would be the only\r\npossible way out of their difficulties. Hence at the very moment\r\nwhen Wellington was withdrawing his half-starved army from the\r\nTagus, and impeaching in letters of stinging irony the conduct of\r\nthe Junta’s mendacious commissaries, he was being pressed to resume\r\nthe offensive. Countless appeals were made to him. Both formal and\r\nargumentative invitations from the ministers at Seville, and private\r\nremonstrances by individuals, Spanish and English, were showered upon\r\nhim[4]. The Junta even went so far as to offer him command of the\r\nSpanish troops in Estremadura, though this offer was qualified by\r\ntheir statement that they intended to reduce those troops to 12,000\r\nmen, the larger half of the army being under orders to march eastward\r\ninto La Mancha and join the force of Venegas. This proposal did not\r\nin the least meet Wellington’s main objection to resuming active\r\noperations; viz. that he could not trust the Spanish Government to\r\nfeed his army, nor the Spanish generals to carry out with punctual\r\naccuracy any scheme for a joint campaign which might be laid before\r\nhim. He put the matter very plainly--‘till the evils of which I think\r\nthat I have reason to complain are remedied: till I see magazines\r\nestablished for the supply of the troops, and a regular system\r\nadopted for keeping them filled: till I see an army upon whose\r\nexertions I can depend, commanded by officers capable and willing\r\nto carry into execution the operations which have been planned by\r\nmutual agreement, I cannot enter upon any system of co-operation\r\nwith the Spanish armies[5].’ This statement was for publication: in\r\nprivate correspondence with his brother, the ambassador at Seville,\r\nhe added still more cogent reasons for declining to take the field\r\nwith Venegas or Eguia. He had witnessed with his own eyes the panic\r\nof Portago’s division on the night before Talavera, ‘when whole corps\r\nthrew away their arms and ran off in my presence, while neither\r\nattacked nor threatened with attack, but frightened (I believe) by\r\ntheir own fire’: he had seen Albuquerque’s cavalry, the day after\r\nthe combat of Arzobispo, lurking in every village for twenty miles\r\nround, and ‘had heard Spanish officers telling of nineteen or twenty\r\nactions of the same description as that of Arzobispo, an account of\r\nwhich (I believe) has never been published.’ The army of Estremadura\r\nconsisted, he concluded, ‘of troops by no means to be depended\r\nupon’--on every ground, therefore, he ought to avoid ‘risking the\r\nKing’s army again in such company[6].’\r\n\r\n  [4] See _Dispatches_, v. 168, for an account of an interview\r\n  with the Marquis of Malaspina and Lord Macduff, who had come to\r\n  Badajoz to make personal representation, which Wellington much\r\n  resented.\r\n\r\n  [5] Wellington to Wellesley, Oct. 30: _Dispatches_, v. 213. For\r\n  stronger language about the rash folly of Spanish generals, see\r\n  Wellington to Beresford, ibid. 179.\r\n\r\n  [6] Wellington to Wellesley, Aug. 24, from Merida.\r\n\r\nThere was no getting over this fundamental objection of Wellington’s,\r\nand his brother, therefore, was placed in a very uncomfortable\r\nposition. During all his negotiations with the Central Junta, Lord\r\nWellesley’s task indeed was a most invidious one. He had been\r\ndirected by his government to profess an earnest desire to aid the\r\nSpaniards in bringing the war to a successful conclusion, and to\r\npledge the aid of Great Britain, yet he was forced to refuse every\r\ndefinite proposal made to him by the Junta. On the other hand,\r\nthere were clauses in his instructions which provoked the most\r\nopenly-displayed suspicion and resentment, when he touched upon them\r\nin his conversations with Martin de Garay and the other Spanish\r\nministers. Such were the proposal to place the whole Spanish army\r\nunder a British commander (i.e. Wellington), the attempt to open up\r\nthe subject of a certain measure of free trade with Spanish America,\r\nand--most of all--the offer to send British troops to garrison\r\nCadiz. For despite the fiasco of the preceding winter, the Portland\r\nministry were still harping on this old string, and allusions to it\r\noccur in nearly every dispatch sent from London to the ambassador at\r\nSeville[7].\r\n\r\n  [7] See Canning’s instruction to Wellesley of June 27, 1809, on\r\n  pages 186-91 of Wellesley’s _Dispatches and Correspondence_,\r\n  Lond. 1838.\r\n\r\nWellesley’s position was made even more difficult by the fact\r\nthat all the Spanish factions opposed to the Central Junta tried\r\nto draw him into their schemes, by making lavish professions of\r\nwhat they were ready to do if only the present government were\r\nevicted from office. Of these factions there were many: the old\r\n‘Council of Castile,’ which the Junta had superseded, still clung\r\ntogether, making protests as to the legality of their successor’s\r\nposition. The local assemblies were equally jealous of the central\r\nauthority--the Juntas of Estremadura and Valencia, in especial, were\r\nalways intriguing behind its back, and the former at least made many\r\ntempting proposals both to Wellesley and to Wellington. But the most\r\ndangerous enemies of the existing government were the malcontents\r\nclose at its gates--the Andalusian conspirators, led by the members\r\nof the old Junta of Seville, and by the intriguers like the Conde de\r\nMontijo, the dukes of Infantado and Ossuna, and Francisco Palafox.\r\nThe dissatisfaction caused by the incapacity, indecision, and--as\r\nit was openly said--the nepotism and venality of the Junta was so\r\ngeneral, that a plan was formed in Seville to seize them, deport them\r\nall to the Canaries, and proclaim a Regency. The troops in the place\r\nwere tampered with, some demagogues were ready to raise the mob, and\r\nInfantado[8], who was in the thick of the plot, came to Wellesley\r\none night to divulge the arrangements for the ‘Pronunciamento’ and\r\nto bespeak his aid. Much as he disliked the Junta and its methods,\r\nthe Ambassador scornfully refused to make himself a member of a\r\nconspiracy, and after warning Infantado of his intention, went\r\nstraight to the Secretary Garay and gave him all the information as\r\nto the project, though without divulging any names. Some of the\r\nplotters fled, others were arrested. ‘For the last two days,’ writes\r\nWellesley to his brother, ‘I have been employed in endeavouring to\r\nsave the necks of these caitiffs from the just fury and indignation\r\nof the people and soldiery, and I have succeeded. A regular plot was\r\nformed to seize (and I believe to _hang_) them all. But I could not\r\nsuffer such outrages under my nose, so I interfered and saved the\r\ncurs from the rope. They were all gratitude _for an hour_ [Wellesley\r\nwas offered and refused the Order of the Golden Fleece next morning],\r\nbut now that they think themselves secure they have begun to cheat me\r\nagain[9].’\r\n\r\n  [8] See Baumgarten, _Geschichte Spaniens_, i. 408, and Toreno,\r\n  vol, ii. p. 72. Wellesley only calls the Duke ‘a person’:\r\n  _Dispatches_, p. 160.\r\n\r\n  [9] Wellesley to Wellington, Sept. 19, 1809. Wellington,\r\n  _Supplementary Dispatches_, vi. 372.\r\n\r\nMuch as every patriot should deprecate the employment of _coups\r\nd’état_ while a foreign war is on hand, there was much to excuse\r\nthe conduct of the enemies of the Junta. That body was now more\r\nthan a year old; it had been from the first regarded as a stop-gap,\r\nas a provisional government which was destined to give place to\r\nsomething more regular and constitutional when occasion should serve.\r\nA ‘Committee of Public Safety’ which fails to preserve the state\r\nstands self-condemned, and the history of the Central Junta had been\r\none record of consistent disaster. A body of over thirty persons is\r\ntoo large for a ministry, too small for a representative assembly.\r\nEvery intelligent Spaniard, whatever his politics, was desirous of\r\nseeing it give place to a regular government. The Conservatives\r\nand bureaucrats would have been contented if it had appointed a\r\nRegency of four or five persons, and then abdicated. The Liberals\r\ndemanded that it should summon the national Cortes, and leave to\r\nthat body the creation of an executive. Pamphlets were showered by\r\ndozens from the press--now more or less free, for the first time\r\nin Spanish history--to advocate one or other of these courses. The\r\nJunta, however, had no intention of surrendering its power, whatever\r\npretence of disinterestedness it might assume and proclaim. Its\r\nfirst attempts to put off the evil day when it must yield to public\r\nopinion were ingeniously absurd. It issued, as early as May 22, a\r\nproclamation acknowledging the advisability of summoning a Cortes,\r\nand then invited all well-thinking Spaniards to send in schemes and\r\nsuggestions during the next two months concerning the best way in\r\nwhich the national assembly could be organized, and the reforms and\r\nconstitutional improvements which it should take in hand. These\r\ndocuments were to be read and pondered over by a Commission, mainly\r\ncomposed of members of the Junta, which was to issue a report in due\r\ntime, embodying the best of the suggestions and the results of its\r\nown discussion[10]. This was an admirable device for wasting time\r\nand putting off the assembly of the Cortes. The Commission finally\r\ndecided, on September 19, after many weeks of session, that a supreme\r\nExecutive Council of five persons should be appointed, carefully\r\navoiding the name of Regency. But only existing members of the\r\nCentral Junta were to be eligible as Councillors, and the Council\r\nwas to be changed at short intervals, till every member of the\r\nJunta had taken a turn in it[11]. The only laudable clause of this\r\nscheme was one providing that Spanish America should be represented\r\nin the Junta, and therefore ultimately in the Executive Council.\r\nThe arrangement satisfied nobody--it merely substituted a rapidly\r\nchanging committee of the Junta for the whole of that body as the\r\nsupreme ruling power: and it was clear that the orders of the Council\r\nwould be those of the Junta, though they might be voiced by fewer\r\nmouths. The assembly of the Cortes would be put off _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n  [10] For the text of this wordy proclamation see Wellesley’s\r\n  _Spanish Dispatches_, pp. 135-9.\r\n\r\n  [11] Note the extraordinary similarity of this plan to that\r\n  produced by the Athenian oligarchs in 411 B. C. Had some one been\r\n  reading Thucydides?\r\n\r\nAny effect which the report of the Commission might have had, was\r\nspoilt by the fact that it was followed by a minority report, or\r\nmanifesto, drawn up by the Marquis of La Romana, who had been one of\r\nthe Commissioners. The Junta had called him back from Galicia, and\r\ncompelled him to surrender the army that he had re-formed, under the\r\npretext that he had been co-opted as a member of their own body. A\r\ndeath-vacancy had been created in the representation of the kingdom\r\nof Valencia: he had been named to fill it, summoned to Seville,\r\nand placed on the constitutional Commission. Dissenting from every\r\nword of the report of the majority, he published on October 14 a\r\ncounter-scheme, in which he declared that the venality, nepotism,\r\nand dilatory incapacity of the Junta made it necessary for Spain\r\nto seek a new executive which should be wholly independent of that\r\nbody. Accordingly he suggested that a Regency of five members should\r\nbe constituted, as the supreme governing body of the realm. No\r\nmember of the Junta was to sit therein. It was to be assisted, for\r\nconsultative purposes, by a body of six persons--one of whom was\r\nto be a South American. This second committee, to be called ‘the\r\nPermanent Deputation of the Realm,’ was to be considered to represent\r\nthe Cortes till that assembly should meet. It was not to meddle with\r\nexecutive matters, but was to devote itself to drawing up the details\r\nof the constitution of the future Cortes, and to suggesting practical\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nSo far as the declaration in favour of a Regency went, most sensible\r\nSpaniards liked La Romana’s scheme, and it obtained Wellesley’s\r\napproval also. But the idea of the ‘Permanent Deputation’ frightened\r\nthe Liberals, who feared that its existence would be made the excuse\r\nfor putting off the summoning of the Cortes for an indefinite time.\r\nMoreover it was rumoured that La Romana intended to resign his seat\r\nin the Junta, and to become a candidate for the position of Senior\r\nRegent, so that his proposals must be intended to benefit himself.\r\nThe suspicion that his personal ambitions inspired his patriotic\r\ndenunciation of the Junta’s misdoings was made the more likely by\r\nevents that occurred at the same moment in Valencia. There the\r\nleading personage of the moment was the governor, General José Caro,\r\nthe younger brother of La Romana, who had complete control of the\r\nlocal Junta, and exercised what his enemies called a tyranny in the\r\nprovince. He and his following were already on the worst terms with\r\nthe Seville Government, and now took the opportunity of bursting\r\nout into open rebellion. They issued a sounding manifesto against\r\nthe Supreme Junta, declared their intention of refusing to obey it\r\nany longer, and republished and sent in all directions to the other\r\nlocal Juntas La Romana’s report in favour of a Regency, of which Caro\r\nhad struck off 6,000 copies. They threatened to turn back by force\r\nGeneral Castro whom the Supreme Junta had sent to supersede Caro,\r\nand declared their second representative in that body, the Conde de\r\nContamina, deposed for ‘disobedience to the will of the people.’ It\r\nlooked as if La Romana might be intending to overthrow the central\r\ngovernment by means of his brother’s Valencian army. Apparently he\r\nmust be acquitted of this charge, his fiery and ambitious kinsman\r\nhaving gone far beyond his intentions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these intrigues, plots, and manifestos the\r\nCentral Junta had only one hope--to rehabilitate themselves by means\r\nof a great military success. With ruinous consequences they tried to\r\ndirect the course of the war with political rather than strategical\r\nends in view. Of the unhappy autumn campaign which their rashness\r\nprecipitated we shall speak in its proper place; but before narrating\r\nthe disasters of Ocaña and Alba de Tormes, we must turn back for\r\nsome months to consider the situation of Eastern Spain, where the\r\ncontinuous chronicle of events has been conducted no further than\r\nBlake’s rout at Belchite in June, and St. Cyr’s victory of Valls\r\nin February 1809. Much had happened in Catalonia and Aragon even\r\nbefore the day of Talavera. Much more was to take place before the\r\nill-judged November campaign of the Junta’s armies in New Castile and\r\nLeon had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.--This is a military history: for the war of pamphlets and\r\nmanifestos, plots and intrigues, between the Seville Government\r\nand its adversaries, the reader who is anxious to master the\r\ndisheartening details may consult Toreno’s Tenth Book; Schepeler,\r\niii. 460-86; Baumgarten, vol. i. chapter viii; Arteche, vol. vii.\r\nchapter vi, and above all the volume of the Marquis of Wellesley’s\r\n_Spanish Dispatches_ (London, 1838). There is a good and lively\r\ndescription of the chief members of the Junta and the ministry, and\r\nof the intrigues against them, in William Jacob’s _Travels in the\r\nSouth of Spain_ (London, 1811).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEVENTS IN EASTERN SPAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF 1809. THE\r\nSIEGE OF GERONA BEGUN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1809 the theatres of operations of the two French\r\narmy-corps entrusted with the reduction of Aragon and of Catalonia\r\nwere still divided by a broad belt of territory which was in the\r\nhands of the Spaniards, around the fortresses of Lerida, Mequinenza,\r\nand Tortosa. Only once had communication been opened between Suchet\r\nand St. Cyr, and then the force which had crossed from Aragon into\r\nCatalonia found itself unable to return. The only way of getting a\r\ndispatch from Saragossa to Barcelona was to send it by the circuitous\r\nroad through France. Co-operation between the 3rd and the 7th Corps\r\nwould have been difficult in any case; but since each of the two\r\ncorps-commanders was interested in his own problems alone, and found\r\nthem all-absorbing, the war in Catalonia and the war in Aragon went\r\non during 1809 and the first half of 1810 as separate affairs from\r\nthe French point of view. It was otherwise with the Spaniards: Blake\r\nhad been placed in command of the whole of the _Coronilla_, the\r\nthree provinces of Valencia, Aragon, and Catalonia which had formed\r\nthe ancient kingdom of Aragon[12]. He had Suchet on his left and\r\nSt. Cyr on his right, was equally interested in the operations of\r\neach, and might, so far as the rules of strategy go, have turned his\r\nmain force against whichever of the two he might please, leaving a\r\ncomparatively small force to ‘contain’ the other. Unfortunately he\r\nproved unable to make head against either of his adversaries. We\r\nhave already seen how, in the early summer, he threw himself upon\r\nSuchet, and was beaten off at Maria and routed at Belchite. In the\r\nlater months of the year it was mainly with St. Cyr that he had to\r\ndeal, and his efforts were equally unsuccessful. It would seem that\r\nhe found it very difficult to concentrate any preponderant portion\r\nof his troops for a blow to either side: very few battalions from\r\nCatalonia accompanied his Valencians and Aragonese to Maria: very\r\nfew Valencians were brought up to aid the Catalans in the operations\r\nabout Gerona. The problems of food and transport had something to\r\ndo with this, but the main difficulty was that the armies of both\r\nprovinces, more especially the Catalans, were essentially local\r\nlevies, and disliked being drawn far from their homes. There was\r\nalways some threatening danger in their own district which made\r\nthem loath to leave it unguarded, while they were taken off on some\r\ndistant expedition. The complaints and arguments of the Juntas,\r\nthe manifest unwillingness of the officers and men, fettered the\r\nhands of the commander-in-chief, whenever he strove to accomplish a\r\ngeneral concentration. Hence it came to pass that for the most part\r\nSt. Cyr was opposed by Catalan troops only, Suchet by Valencians and\r\nAragonese only, during the campaigns of 1809.\r\n\r\n  [12] Catalonia had been added to his command after Reding died of\r\n  wounds received at the battle of Valls.\r\n\r\nThe tasks of the commander of the 3rd Corps in the months that\r\nfollowed his victories over Blake were both less interesting and\r\nless important than those imposed upon his colleague in Catalonia.\r\nThey were however laborious enough; after having driven the\r\nSpanish regular armies out of Aragon, Suchet had now to tame the\r\ncountry-side. For even after Belchite he held little more than the\r\ntowns of Saragossa and Jaca, and the ground on which his camps were\r\npitched from day to day. When he had concentrated his corps to fight\r\nBlake, the rest of the province had slipped out of his hands. Its\r\nreconquest was a tedious matter, even though he had only to contend\r\nwith scattered bands of peasants, stiffened by stragglers from the\r\narmy that had dispersed after Belchite. The plain of the Ebro, which\r\nforms the central strip of Aragon, was easily subdued, but the\r\nmountains to the north and south were well fitted to be the refuge of\r\ninsurgents. The Aragonese, along with the Galicians, were the first\r\nof the Spaniards to take to systematic guerrilla warfare. Undismayed\r\nby the fate of Blake’s army, they had resolved to defend themselves\r\nto the last. There was more than one focus of resistance: a colonel\r\nRenovales, who had been one of the defenders of Saragossa, and had\r\nescaped after the capitulation, was at the head of the bands of the\r\nnorth-western mountains, in the vale of Roncal and on the borders\r\nof Navarre. In the north-eastern region, about the upper waters of\r\nthe Cinca and the hills beyond Jaca, two local chiefs named Perena\r\nand Sarasa kept the war on foot, getting their stores and ammunition\r\nfrom the Catalans on the side of Lerida. In an entirely distinct\r\npart of the province, south of the Ebro, lay Gayan and Villacampa,\r\nwhose centres of activity were Daroca and Molina, mountain towns from\r\nwhich they were often driven up into that central ganglion of all\r\nthe ranges of Spain, the Sierra de Albaracin, from which descend in\r\ndiverging directions the sources of the Tagus, the Guadalaviar, and\r\nthe Xucar. Both Gayan and Villacampa were officers of the regular\r\narmy, holding commissions under Blake: the band of the former had as\r\nits nucleus the regiment of La Princesa, whose extraordinary escape\r\nacross northern Spain after the combat of Santander has been told in\r\nanother place[13].\r\n\r\n  [13] See vol. ii. p. 387.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s work, during the later summer and the autumn of 1809, was\r\nto break up and as far as possible to destroy these bands. His\r\nsuccess was considerable but not complete: in July he stormed Gayan’s\r\nstronghold, the mountain sanctuary of Nuestra Señora del Aguila,\r\ncaptured his magazines, and drove him up into the mountains of\r\nMolina. Continuing his campaign south of the Ebro, he sent the Pole\r\nChlopiski against Villacampa, who abandoned Calatayud, Daroca, and\r\nthe other hill towns, and retired into the Sierra de Albaracin, where\r\nhe took refuge at the remote convent of El Tremendal, one of the most\r\nout-of-the-way spots in the whole Peninsula. Here, nevertheless,\r\nthe partisan was followed up on Nov. 23-4 by a column under Colonel\r\nHenriot, who manœuvred him out of his position, surprised him by a\r\nnight attack, and drove him over the Valencian border. The convent\r\nwas blown up, the dependent village of Orihuela sacked, and the\r\nFrench withdrew[14].\r\n\r\n  [14] For an excellent personal diary of all these operations see\r\n  General Von Brandt’s _Aus meinem Leben_, pp. 100-12. He accuses\r\n  Suchet of grossly exaggerating, both in his dispatches and his\r\n  memoirs, the difficulty and importance of these mountain raids\r\n  (see Suchet’s _Memoirs_, i. pp. 40-74, for a highly picturesque\r\n  narrative). The insurgents were still unskilled in arms, shot\r\n  very poorly, kept bad watch, and were given to panic. That there\r\n  is something in Brandt’s criticism seems to be shown by the fact\r\n  that the whole division of Musnier lost between July 1 and Dec.\r\n  31, 1809, only three officers killed and eight wounded out of\r\n  200 present with the eagles in six months of incessant raids and\r\n  skirmishes (see Martinien’s _Liste des officiers_, often quoted\r\n  before).\r\n\r\nThese operations had been carried out by Musnier’s division; but\r\nmeanwhile movements of a very similar sort were being undertaken by\r\nanother division, that of Laval, on the other side of Aragon, along\r\nthe slopes and gorges of the Pyrenees[15]. In the end of August a\r\ncolumn of 3,000 men stormed the convent of San Juan de la Peña, close\r\nto Jaca, which Sarasa and Renovales were wont to make their head\r\nquarters. It was an ancient building containing the tombs of the\r\nearly kings of Aragon, who reigned in the mountains before Saragossa\r\nhad been recovered from the Moor; it had never seen an enemy for\r\neight hundred years, and was reputed holy and impregnable. Hence its\r\ncapture dealt a severe blow to the confidence of the insurgents.\r\nRenovales, however, held out in the western upland, continuing to\r\ndefend himself in the valley of Roncal, till he was beset on all\r\nsides, for Suchet had obtained leave from Paris to call up the\r\nNational Guards of the Ariége, Basses Pyrénées and Haute Garonne, and\r\ntheir _bataillons d’élite_ attacked the insurgents in the rear from\r\nacross the high mountains, while the 3rd Corps advanced against them\r\nfrom the front. After much scattered fighting Renovales capitulated,\r\non condition that he should be allowed a free departure. He retired\r\nto Catalonia with some of his men: the rest dispersed for the moment,\r\nbut only to reassemble a few weeks later, under another and a more\r\nwary and obstinate chief, the younger Mina, who commenced in this\r\nsame autumn to make the borders of Aragon and Navarre the theatre\r\nof his hazardous exploits. But the region was comparatively quiet\r\nin September and October, and Suchet transferred the activity of\r\nhis movable column further to the eastward, where he drove some\r\n_partidas_ out of the valleys of the Cinca and Essera, and tried to\r\nopen up a new line of communication with France by way of the valley\r\nof Venasque. This was accomplished, for a moment, by the aid of\r\nnational guards from beyond the Pyrenees, who entered the valley from\r\nthe north while the troops of Suchet were operating from the south.\r\nBut the road remained unsafe, and could only be used for the passage\r\nof very large bodies of troops, so that it was practically of little\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n  [15] Suchet’s third division, that of Habert, was lying out in\r\n  the direction of the Cinca and the Guadalupe, watching lest Blake\r\n  might make a new sally from Tortosa or Lerida.\r\n\r\nIn December Suchet completed the formal conquest of Aragon, by\r\nmoving up the whole of Laval’s division into the high-lying district\r\nof Teruel, in the extreme south-east of the province, the only\r\npart of it that had never yet seen the French eagles. The Junta of\r\nAragon fled from thence over the border of the kingdom of Valencia,\r\nbut Villacampa and his bands remained in the mountains unsubdued,\r\nand while they continued to exist the conquest of the upland was\r\nincomplete. The moment that its towns ceased to be held by large\r\ngarrisons, it was clear that the insurgents would descend to reoccupy\r\nthem. Nevertheless Suchet had done much in this year: besides the\r\ncrushing of Blake he had accomplished the complete subjection of\r\nthe plains of Central Aragon, and had obtained a grip upon its two\r\nmountain regions. He had fortified Monzon, Fraga, Alcañiz, and Caspe\r\nas outposts against the Catalans, and, having received large drafts\r\nfrom France in the autumn, was on the last day of the year at the\r\nhead of a fine corps of 26,000 men, from which he might hope to\r\nproduce in the next spring a field army sufficient for offensive\r\noperations against Catalonia or Valencia, after providing garrisons\r\nfor his various posts of strength[16]. The weak point of his\r\nposition was that the guerrilleros had learned caution, refused for\r\nthe future to fight save under the most favourable conditions, and\r\ndevoted themselves to the safe and vexatious policy of intercepting\r\ncommunications and cutting up small parties and stragglers. They were\r\nmuch harder to deal with, when once they had learnt that not even in\r\nfastnesses like El Tremendal or San Juan de la Peña was it wise to\r\noffer the French battle. Unless Suchet left a garrison in every town,\r\nnay, in every considerable village, of the sierras, the insurgents\r\ndominated the whole region. If he did take such measures for holding\r\ndown the upland, he was forced to immobilize a very large proportion\r\nof his army. We shall note that in 1810 he was only able to draw out\r\n12,000 of his 26,000 men for the invasion of Western Catalonia.\r\n\r\n  [16] The 3rd Corps which had gone down to little over 10,000 men\r\n  in May 1809, counted on Jan. 1, 1810, the following force:\r\n\r\n    Division Laval                     5,348\r\n\r\n       ”     Musnier                   8,465\r\n\r\n       ”     Habert                    4,757\r\n\r\n    Cavalry Brigade                    2,172\r\n\r\n    Artillery and Engineers              928\r\n\r\n    Garrisons of Alcañiz, Jaca,\r\n      Monzon, Saragossa, Tudela        3,110\r\n\r\n    ‘Chasseurs des Montagnes’\r\n      [permanently embodied Pyrenean\r\n      National Guards]                 1,425\r\n                                      ------\r\n                         Total        26,205\r\n                                      ------\r\n\r\n  Of these 23,074 were effectives present with colours, the\r\n  remainder were in hospital or detached.\r\n\r\nWhile the commander of the 3rd Corps was making steady progress with\r\nthe conquest of Aragon, the fortunes of his colleague of the 7th\r\nCorps had been far more chequered. Indeed for the greater part of\r\n1809 St. Cyr was brought to a complete standstill by the unexpected\r\nobstinacy of the gallant garrison of Gerona, who for no less than\r\neight months kept the main body of the army of Catalonia detained in\r\nfront of their walls.\r\n\r\nWhen last we dealt with the operations in this region we left St.\r\nCyr victorious at the well-contested battle of Valls, after which\r\nhe advanced into the plain of Tarragona, made some demonstrations\r\nagainst that fortress, but returned after a few weeks to Barcelona\r\n(March 18) without having made any serious attempt to turn his\r\nvictory to practical account. This retreat after a brilliant\r\nsuccess may be compared to Victor’s similar evacuation of Southern\r\nEstremadura after Medellin, and was brought about, in the main,\r\nby the same cause, want of supplies. For when he had consumed the\r\nresources of the newly-subdued district between Valls and Tarragona,\r\nSt. Cyr had no means of providing his army with further subsistence.\r\nBarcelona, his base, could not feed him, for the city was itself\r\non the edge of famine: it was still beset to north and west by the\r\nlocal miqueletes, who had returned to their old haunts when the main\r\nFrench army had gone off southward on the campaign of Valls. It was\r\nstringently blockaded on the sea side by the British Mediterranean\r\nfleet, and it could not draw food from France by land, because\r\nthe high-road to Perpignan passed through the fortress of Gerona,\r\nwhich was still in Spanish hands. St. Cyr himself, it will be\r\nremembered, had only reached Barcelona by turning off on to side\r\ntracks through the mountain, and winning his way down to the shore by\r\nthe hard-fought battle of Cardadeu. Till Gerona should fall, and the\r\ngarrison of Barcelona be placed in direct communication with France,\r\nthere was little use in making ambitious offensive movements against\r\nTarragona or any other point in Southern or Central Catalonia. It was\r\nabsolutely necessary to reduce Gerona, and so to bring the division\r\nleft behind under Reille, in the Ampurdam and on the frontier of\r\nRoussillon, into free communication with the remainder of the 7th\r\nCorps. From the moment when St. Cyr passed the mountains during\r\nthe winter Reille had been fighting out a petty campaign against\r\nthe northern Catalans, which had no connexion whatever with his\r\nsuperior’s operations at Molins de Rey and Valls, and had little\r\ndefinite result of any kind.\r\n\r\nNo one saw more clearly than Napoleon the need for the reduction of\r\nGerona: as early as January he had issued orders both to St. Cyr and\r\nto Reille to prepare for the enterprise. But St. Cyr was now out of\r\ntouch, and Reille was far too weak in the early spring to dream of\r\nany such an adventure: he had been left no more than seven depleted\r\nbattalions to maintain his hold on Northern Catalonia, when St. Cyr\r\ntook the rest of the army across the hills to Barcelona. The Emperor\r\nwas not slow to realize that the 7th Corps must be reinforced on a\r\nlarge scale. He did so by sending thither in the spring of 1809 a\r\nbrigade of Berg troops (four battalions), the regiment of Würzburg\r\n(two battalions), and a division (seven battalions) of Westphalians:\r\nit will be noted that now, as always, he was most chary of drafting\r\nnative French troops to Catalonia, and always fed the war in that\r\ndirection with auxiliaries in whose fate he was little interested:\r\nthe campaign in eastern Spain was, after all, but a side issue in the\r\nmain struggle[17]. When these reinforcements had arrived Reille began\r\nto collect material at Bascara on the Fluvia, to which siege-guns\r\nlaboriously dragged across the Pyrenees were added: several companies\r\nof heavy artillery and sappers were brought up from France.\r\n\r\n  [17] Cette portion de l’Espagne reste, d’ailleurs, isolée, et\r\n  sans influence sur le reste de la Péninsule. Imperial Minute of\r\n  Dec. 1, 1809.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr meanwhile, four weeks after his retreat from the plain of\r\nTarragona, moved on to Vich upon April 18, with the divisions of\r\nSouham, Pino, Lecchi, and Chabot, leaving Duhesme with his original\r\nFrench division, which had held Barcelona since the outbreak of the\r\nwar, in charge of his base of operations. His departure was partly\r\ndesigned to spare the stores of Barcelona, where the pinch of famine\r\nwas beginning to be felt; for he intended to subsist his army on the\r\nupland plain of Vich, a rich corn-bearing district hitherto untouched\r\nby the war. But a few days after he had marched forth Barcelona\r\nwas freed from privation, by the lucky arrival of a squadron of\r\nvictuallers from Toulon, convoyed by Admiral Cosmao, which had put to\r\nsea in a storm and eluded the British blockading squadron (April 27).\r\nThe position of Vich, however, had been chosen by St. Cyr not only\r\nfor reasons of supply, but because the place was happily situated\r\nfor covering the projected siege of Gerona against any interruption\r\nby Blake. If the Spanish commander-in-chief brought up the wrecks\r\nof the old Catalan army from Tarragona, with his Valencian levies\r\nadded, he would almost certainly take the inland road by Manresa\r\nand Vich, since the coast-road was practically barred to him by the\r\nFrench occupation of Barcelona. As a matter of fact the commencement\r\nof the leaguer of Gerona was not vexed by any such interruption, for\r\nBlake had his eyes fixed on Saragossa in May and June, and was so\r\nfar from dreaming of an assault on St. Cyr, that he drew off part of\r\nthe Catalan army for his unhappy invasion of Aragon, which finished\r\nwith the disaster of Belchite. During the early months of this long\r\nsiege the only external helpers of the garrison of Gerona were the\r\nsmall force of regulars under the Swiss Wimpfen, and the miqueletes\r\nof Claros and Rovira from the Ampurdam, Reille’s opponents during the\r\nspring. At Tarragona the Marquis of Coupigny, the senior officer now\r\nin Catalonia, had no more than 6,000 men left of Reding’s old army,\r\nand was helpless to interfere with St. Cyr who had some 20,000 men\r\nconcentrated at Vich.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the siege therefore went on in the end of\r\nApril and the beginning of May without any hindrance, save from\r\nthe normal bickerings of the French outlying detachments with the\r\nlocal _somatenes_, which never ceased. Around Vich matters were\r\nparticularly lively, for the whole population of the town and the\r\nsurrounding plains had gone up into the hills, where they wandered\r\nmiserably for three months, much hunted by French foraging parties,\r\nwhich they occasionally succeeded in destroying. St. Cyr opened up\r\nhis communications with Reille by sending to him Lecchi’s Italian\r\ndivision, which cut its way amid constant skirmishes along the banks\r\nof the Ter to Gerona, and met the troops from the Ampurdam under\r\nits walls. Reille had moved forth from Bascara on May 4, and on the\r\neighth expelled the Spanish outposts from all the villages round the\r\nfortress, not without some lively skirmishing. He had brought up some\r\n10,000 infantry--including his own old division and all the newly\r\narrived Germans--with some 1,300 artillerymen and engineers. Almost\r\nat the same moment arrived dispatches from Paris, announcing that the\r\nEmperor, just before departing for the Austrian war, had superseded\r\nboth St. Cyr and Reille, being discontented with their handling of\r\naffairs in Catalonia. It is unfortunate that no statement in detail\r\nof his reasons appears in the _Correspondance_[18], but it would\r\nseem that he thought that the victories of Molins de Rey and Valls\r\nshould have had greater results, disapproved of St. Cyr’s retreat\r\nfrom in front of Tarragona, and thought that Reille had shown great\r\nweakness in dealing with the insurgents of the Ampurdam. He ignored\r\nthe special difficulties of the war in Catalonia, thinking that the\r\n30,000 men of the 7th Corps ought to have sufficed for its complete\r\nconquest. Indeed he showed his conception of the general state of\r\naffairs by recommending St. Cyr in March to undertake simultaneously\r\nthe sieges of Gerona, Tarragona, and Tortosa[19]. The leaguer of one,\r\nand that the smallest, of these places was destined to occupy the\r\nwhole army of Catalonia, when largely reinforced, for eight months.\r\nIf it had been cut up according to the imperial mandate, it is\r\nprobable that at least one of its sections would have been destroyed.\r\nSt. Cyr wrote in his memoirs that his master was jealous of him, and\r\nwished to see him fail, even at the cost of wrecking the 7th Corps.\r\nThis is of course absurd; but there can be no doubt that the Emperor\r\ndisliked his lieutenant, all the more because of the long string of\r\ncomplaints, and of demands for more men, money, and stores, which he\r\nwas now receiving week by week from Catalonia. He loved generals who\r\nachieved the impossible, and hated grumblers and _frondeurs_, a class\r\nto which St. Cyr, despite all his talents, undoubtedly belonged. It\r\nis possible that Napoleon’s determination to replace him may have\r\nbeen fostered by intrigues on the part of the officer to whom the 7th\r\nCorps was now turned over. Marshal Augereau had served with great\r\ncredit in the old republican campaign in Catalonia during 1793 and\r\n1794, imagined himself to have a profound knowledge of the country,\r\nand was anxious to try his hand in it. It was many years since he had\r\nbeen trusted with an independent command; both in the wars of 1806-7\r\nand in that of 1809 he had been lost in the ranks of the Grand Army.\r\nHis nomination to supersede St. Cyr was made early in May, but on his\r\nway to the seat of war he was seized with a fit of the gout, and was\r\ndetained in bed at Perpignan for many weeks. Thus his predecessor,\r\nthough apprised of his disgrace, was obliged to continue in command,\r\nand to commence the operations of which the Marshal, as he well knew,\r\nwould take all the credit. At the same moment Reille was displaced\r\nby Verdier, the general who had conducted the first unlucky siege of\r\nSaragossa--an experience which seems to have made him very cautious\r\nwhen dealing with Spaniards behind walls.\r\n\r\n  [18] There is only a short note in Dispatch no. 16,004. See p. 63\r\n  of this vol.\r\n\r\n  [19] See St. Cyr to Berthier, March 6, 1809, and St. Cyr’s\r\n  _Memoirs_, p. 130.\r\n\r\nLecchi’s division forced its way back to St. Cyr on May 18, bringing\r\nhim the intelligence of his supersession, but at the same time\r\napprising him that Augereau would not arrive as yet, and that the\r\nduty of commencing the siege of Gerona would still fall to his lot.\r\nAt the same time Verdier sent letters urging that his 10,000 infantry\r\nformed too small a force to surround such a large fortress, and\r\nthat he must ask for reinforcements from the covering army. If they\r\nwere denied him, he should refuse to begin the siege, throwing the\r\nresponsibility for this disobedience of the Emperor’s commands on\r\nhis superior: he had reported the situation to Paris. St. Cyr was\r\nincensed at the tone of this dispatch[20], above all at the fact\r\nthat Verdier was appealing straight to the Emperor, instead of\r\ncorresponding through his hierarchical superior, according to the\r\nrules of military etiquette. But he saw that Verdier had a good case,\r\nand he had just learnt that Blake had turned off against Aragon,\r\nso that no trouble from that quarter need be feared. Accordingly\r\nhe, very grudgingly, sent back Lecchi’s division to Gerona. It was\r\nthe worst that he possessed, being composed of no more than four\r\nNeapolitan and three Italian battalions, with a strength of little\r\nover 3,000 bayonets[21]. He added to it a regiment of Italian light\r\nhorse, several of his own batteries, and nearly all the engineers and\r\nsappers of his corps, so that the total reinforcement sent to Verdier\r\nconsisted of more than 4,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [20] It may be found printed in full in the Appendix to the\r\n  narrative of the siege of Gerona in Belmas’s _Sieges_, vol. ii.\r\n  pp. 660-1.\r\n\r\n  [21] 3,116 bayonets and two squadrons of Italian light horse by\r\n  the return of May 15. The Neapolitans were bad troops, deserting\r\n  whenever it was safe to do so.\r\n\r\nHaving received these succours, which brought up his total force to\r\n14,000 infantry and cavalry, and 2,200 artillerymen, sappers and\r\nengineers, Verdier commenced on May 24 his operations against Gerona:\r\non that day Lecchi’s division took its post in the plain of Salt,\r\non the west of the town, while the French and Westphalian divisions\r\nwere already close to the place on its eastern and northern sides.\r\nThe head quarters and the French brigades of Joba and Guillot lay\r\nby Sarria and the bridge of Pont-Mayor, where the magazines were\r\nestablished, while the Germans had been sent up on to the heights\r\neast of the fortress and held the plateaux of Campdura, San Medir,\r\nand Domeny. The rocky southern side of Gerona, in the direction of\r\nthe gorge of the Oña, was not yet properly invested.\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said, in an earlier volume of this work,\r\nconcerning the situation of Gerona, when its two earlier sieges by\r\nDuhesme were narrated[22]. It must suffice to repeat here that the\r\ntown is built on the steep down-slope of two lofty heights, with the\r\nriver Oña at its foot: the stream is crossed by two bridges, but is\r\nfordable everywhere save in times of spate. Beyond it lies the suburb\r\nof the Mercadal, surrounded by fortifications which form an integral\r\npart of the defences of the city. The river Ter, coming from the\r\nwest, joins the Oña at the north side of the Mercadal and washes the\r\nextreme north-western corner of the walls of the city proper. The two\r\nheights upon whose lower slopes Gerona is built are separated from\r\neach other by a deep ravine, called the Galligan, down which run an\r\nintermittent watercourse and a road, the only one by which approach\r\nto the city from the east is possible. The northern height is crowned\r\nby the strong fort of Monjuich, the most formidable part of the city\r\ndefences, with its three outlying redoubts called San Narciso, San\r\nLuis and San Daniel. The crest of the southern height is covered in a\r\nsimilar fashion by the three forts of the Capuchins, Queen Anne, and\r\nthe Constable, with the Calvary redoubt lower down the slope above\r\nthe Galligan, facing San Daniel on the other side of the ravine. Two\r\nother small fortifications, the redoubts of the ‘Chapter’ and the\r\n‘City,’ cover the path which leads down from the forts to Gerona.\r\nNeither the Monjuich nor the Capuchin heights are isolated hills;\r\neach is the end of a spur running down from the higher mountains.\r\nBut while the southern summit rises high above the hilly reach which\r\njoins it to the mountain of Nuestra Señora de los Angeles, the\r\nnorthern summit (where lies Monjuich) is at the end of a plateau\r\nextending far to the north. The Capuchin heights, therefore, can\r\nonly be attacked uphill, while Monjuich can be assailed from ground\r\nof a level little inferior to itself. But except on this point both\r\nheights are very strong, their slopes being in many places absolutely\r\nprecipitous, especially towards the Galligan, and everywhere steep.\r\nNevertheless there are winding paths leading up both, from Sarria\r\nand Pont-Mayor in the case of Monjuich, from Casa de Selva and other\r\nvillages towards the east and the sea in the case of the Capuchin\r\nheights. All the ground is bare rock, with no superincumbent soil.\r\n\r\n  [22] See vol. i. pp. 317-29.\r\n\r\nAll the fortifications were somewhat antiquated in type, nothing\r\nhaving been done to modernize the defences since the war of the\r\nSpanish Succession[23]. Ferdinand VI and Charles III had neglected\r\nGerona in favour of the new fortress of Figueras, nearer to the\r\nfrontier, on which large sums had been expended--for the benefit of\r\nthe French who seized it by treachery in 1808, and were now using it\r\nas their base of operations. The actual wall of enceinte of the city\r\nwas mediaeval--a plain rampart twenty-five feet high, too narrow for\r\nartillery and set thickly with small towers; only at its two ends,\r\non the Oña and the Ter, two bastions (called those of La Merced and\r\nSanta Maria) had been inserted, and properly armed. This weakness\r\nof the walls went for little so long as Monjuich, the Capuchins,\r\nand the other forts held firm, since the enemy could only approach\r\nthe town-enceinte at its two ends, where the bastions lay. Far more\r\ndangerous was the feebleness of the Mercadal, whose ramparts formed\r\nthe southern section of the exterior defences of the place. Its\r\ncircuit had five plain bastions, but no demi-lunes or other outer\r\ndefences, no covered way nor counterscarp: its profile, only some\r\neighteen or twenty feet high, was visible, across the flat ground\r\nwhich surrounds it, from the foot to the summit of the wall, for\r\nwant of ditch or glacis. The ground leading up to it was favourable\r\nfor siege approaches, since the soil was soft and easy to dig, and\r\nwas seamed with hollow roads and stone walls, giving much cover to\r\nan assailant. Aware of the defects of the fortifications of the\r\nMercadal, the Spaniards had prepared a line of defence behind it,\r\nalong the further bank of the Oña. They had made the river-front of\r\nthe city proper defensible to a certain extent, by building up the\r\ndoors and windows of all the houses which abut upon the water, mining\r\nthe two bridges, and fixing a stockade and entanglements in the bed\r\nof the Oña, along the considerable space, where it is fordable in\r\ndry weather[24]. They had indeed repaired the whole circuit of the\r\ndefences since Duhesme’s sieges of 1808, having cleared out the\r\nditches of Monjuich and of the bastions of La Merced and Santa Maria,\r\nwalled up many posterns, and repaired with new and solid masonry all\r\nthe parts of the walls that had been dilapidated at the moment of the\r\nfirst siege. They had also pulled down many isolated houses outside\r\nthe walls, and demolished the nearer half of the suburban village of\r\nPedret, which lies (most inconveniently for the defence) along the\r\nbank of the Ter between the water and the slopes of Monjuich.\r\n\r\n  [23] For a good historical study of the fortifications of Gerona\r\n  and their history, see Vacani, vol. iii. pp. 245-55.\r\n\r\n  [24] This last was done by public subscription, when the\r\n  engineers pointed out the danger of the city being stormed across\r\n  the river-bed. See Arteche, vii. 151. Belmas and Vacani do not\r\n  seem to have known of this fact, as each of them makes the remark\r\n  that if the Mercadal had been taken, a sudden rush might have\r\n  taken the assailants across the shallow river and into the old\r\n  town. It may be remarked that there had once been a river-wall,\r\n  but that most of it had been allowed to fall into decay when the\r\n  Mercadal was taken into the city defences.\r\n\r\nAll these precautions must be put to the credit of the governor,\r\nMariano Alvarez de Castro, a man to be mentioned with all honour and\r\nrespect, and probably the best soldier that Spain produced during\r\nthe whole Peninsular War. He was a veteran of the Revolutionary and\r\nPortuguese wars, and had a good reputation, but no special credit\r\nfor military science, down to the moment when he was put to the\r\ntest. He had been the officer in charge of the castle of Barcelona\r\non the occasion when it was seized by Duhesme in March 1808: his\r\nspirit had been deeply wounded by that vile piece of treachery, and\r\nhe had at once adhered to the national cause. Since then he had\r\nbeen serving in the Ampurdam against Reille, till the moment when\r\nhe was appointed governor of Gerona. Alvarez is described by those\r\nwho served under him as a severe, taciturn man of a puritan cast of\r\nmind. ‘I should call him,’ wrote one of his brigadiers, ‘an officer\r\nwithout the true military talents, but with an extreme confidence in\r\nProvidence--almost, one might say, a believer in miracles. His soul\r\nwas great, capable of every sacrifice, full of admirable constancy;\r\nbut I must confess that his heroism always seemed to me that of\r\na Christian martyr rather than of a professional soldier[25].’\r\nGeneral Fournas, who wrote this somewhat depreciatory sketch of\r\nhis chief, was one of those who signed the capitulation while\r\nAlvarez was moaning _no quiero rendirme_ on his sick-bed, so that\r\nhis judgement is hardly to be taken as unprejudiced; but his words\r\npoint the impression which the governor left on his subordinates.\r\nThe details of his defence sufficiently show that he was a skilful\r\nand resourceful as well as an obstinate general. His minute care to\r\nutilize every possible means of defence prove that he was no mere\r\nwaiter on miracles. That he was a very devout practising Catholic\r\nis evident from some of his doings; at the opening of the siege a\r\ngreat religious ceremony was held, at which the local patron saint,\r\nNarcissus, was declared captain of the city and presented with a\r\ngold-hilted sword. The levy _en masse_ of the citizens was called\r\n‘the Crusade,’ and their badge was the red cross. The ideas of\r\nreligion and patriotism were so closely intertwined that to the lay\r\ncompanies of this force were afterwards added two clerical companies,\r\none composed of monks and friars, the other of secular priests: about\r\n200 of these ecclesiastics were under arms[26]. Even the women were\r\norganized in squads for the transport of wounded, the care of the\r\nhospitals, and the carrying of provisions to the soldiery on the\r\nwalls: about 300 served, under the command of Donna Lucia Fitzgerald\r\nand Donna Maria Angela Bibern, wives of two officers of the regiment\r\nof Ultonia. Five of this ‘company of St. Barbara’ were killed and\r\neleven wounded during the siege.\r\n\r\n  [25] Manuscript notes of General Fournas, quoted by Arteche, vii.\r\n  458.\r\n\r\n  [26] The bishop gave his sanction to the formation of this\r\n  strange corps; see his proclamation in Arteche’s Appendix vii. p.\r\n  539, dated June 9.\r\n\r\nThe garrison at the moment of Verdier’s first attack consisted of\r\nabout 5,700 men, not including the irregulars of the Crusade. There\r\nwere seven battalions of the old army, belonging to the regiments\r\nof Ultonia[27], Borbon, and Voluntarios de Barcelona, with three\r\nbattalions of miqueletes, two local corps, 1st and 2nd of Gerona,\r\nand the 1st of Vich. Of cavalry there was a single squadron, newly\r\nlevied, the ‘escuadron de San Narciso.’ Of artillery there were but\r\n278 men, a wholly insufficient number: the officers of that arm\r\nwere given 370 more to train, partly miqueletes of the 2nd Gerona\r\nbattalion, partly sailors having some small experience of gunnery.\r\nIt was difficult to make proper use of the great store of cannon in\r\nthe fortress, when more than half the troops allotted to them had\r\nnever before seen, much less served, a heavy gun of position. To the\r\nabove 5,700 men of all arms must be added about 1,100 irregulars of\r\nthe ‘Crusade’--seven lay and two clerical companies of fusiliers\r\nand two more of artificers. But these were set to guard almost\r\nunapproachable parts of the wall, or held in reserve: most of the\r\nstress fell upon the organized troops. The defence was altogether\r\nconducted on scientific principles, and had nothing in common with\r\nthat of Saragossa. Here the irregulars formed only a small fraction\r\nof the garrison[28], and were never hurled in senseless fury against\r\nthe French batteries, but used carefully and cautiously as an\r\nauxiliary force, capable of setting free some part of the trained men\r\nfor service on the more important points of the enceinte[29].\r\n\r\n  [27] Ultonia, the regiment of Ulster, still contained many\r\n  officers of the old Jacobite strain, as may be seen by consulting\r\n  the list of killed and wounded, where such names as O’Donnell,\r\n  Macarthy, Nash, Fitzgerald, Pierson, Coleby, Candy, occur: but\r\n  it had just been raised from 200 to 800 bayonets by filling\r\n  the depleted _cadre_ with Catalan recruits, and all the junior\r\n  lieutenants, newly appointed, were Catalans also. So there was\r\n  little Irish about it save the names of some of its senior\r\n  officers.\r\n\r\n  [28] For the details of the composition of the Gerona garrison,\r\n  see Appendix no. 1.\r\n\r\n  [29] I know not why Napier, contrasting Gerona with Saragossa\r\n  (ii. 251), says that at the former place the regular garrison\r\n  was 3,000, the armed multitude ‘less than 6,000.’ When it is\r\n  remembered that its total population was 14,000 souls--of whom\r\n  some fled to places of safety before the siege began--and that\r\n  it had already raised two battalions of miqueletes with 1,360\r\n  bayonets out of its able-bodied male inhabitants, it is difficult\r\n  to see how more than 5,000 armed irregulars are to be procured,\r\n  for in a population of 14,000 souls there cannot be more than\r\n  some 3,000 men between eighteen and forty-five. As a matter of\r\n  fact (see documents in Arteche, vii. Appendix 5), the ‘Crusade’\r\n  was about 1,100 strong at most.\r\n\r\nFor the first two months of the siege Alvarez received no help\r\nwhatever from without: in May the central government of Catalonia had\r\nbeen left in a perfectly paralysed condition, when Blake went off\r\nhimself and took with him the best of the regular troops, in order to\r\nengage in the campaign of Alcañiz and Maria. Coupigny, the interim\r\ncommander at Tarragona, had only 6,000 organized men, and he and\r\nthe Catalan provincial junta were during that month much engrossed\r\nwith an enterprise which distracted them from the needs of Gerona. A\r\nwide-spread conspiracy had been formed within the walls of Barcelona,\r\nwith the object of rising against the garrison in St. Cyr’s absence.\r\nA secret committee of priests, merchants, and retired officers had\r\ncollected all the arms in the city, smuggled in many muskets from\r\nwithout, and enlisted several thousand persons in a grand design\r\nfor an outbreak and a sort of ‘Sicilian Vespers’ fixed--after two\r\npostponements--for the 11th of May. They opened communication with\r\nCoupigny and with the captains of the British frigates blockading the\r\nport. The one was to bring his troops to the gates, the others to\r\ndeliver an attack on the port, upon the appointed night. No Spaniard\r\nbetrayed the plot, though 6,000 citizens are said to have been in\r\nthe secret, but it was frustrated by two foreigners. Conscious that\r\nthe town could not be freed if the citadel of Monjuich was retained\r\nby the French, the conspirators sounded two Italian officers named\r\nCaptain Dottori, fort adjutant of Monjuich, and Captain Provana, who\r\nwas known to be discontented and thought to be corruptible. They\r\noffered them an immense bribe--1,000,000 dollars, it is said--to\r\nbetray the postern of Monjuich to the troops of Coupigny, who were to\r\nbe ready in the ditch at midnight. But they had mistaken their men:\r\nthe officers conferred with Duhesme, and consented to act as _agents\r\nprovocateurs_: they pretended to join the conspiracy, were introduced\r\nto and had interviews with the chiefs, and informed the governor.\r\nOn the morning before the appointed date many of the leaders were\r\narrested. Duhesme placed guards in every street, and proclaimed that\r\nhe knew all. The citizens remained quiet in their despair, the chiefs\r\nwho had not been seized fled, and the troops on the Llobregat retired\r\nto Tarragona. Duhesme hanged his captives, two priests named Gallifa\r\nand Pou, a young merchant named Massana, Navarro an old soldier, and\r\nfour others. ‘They went to the gallows,’ says Vacani, an eye-witness,\r\n‘with pride, convinced every one of them that they had done the duty\r\nof good citizens in behalf of king, country, and religion[30].’\r\n\r\n  [30] Vacani, iii. 211.\r\n\r\nEngrossed in this plot, the official chiefs of Catalonia half forgot\r\nGerona, and did nothing to help Alvarez till long after the siege had\r\nbegun. The only assistance that he received from without was that the\r\nmiqueletes and _somatenes_ of the Ampurdam and the mountain region\r\nabove Hostalrich were always skirmishing with Verdier’s outposts,\r\nand once or twice cut off his convoys of munitions on their way from\r\nFigueras to the front.\r\n\r\nThe French engineers were somewhat at variance as to the right way\r\nto deal with Gerona. There were two obvious alternatives. An attack\r\non the weak front of the Mercadal was certain to succeed: the ground\r\nbefore the walls was suitable for trenches, and the fortifications\r\nwere trifling. But when a lodgement had been made in this quarter\r\nof the town it would be necessary to work forward, among the narrow\r\nlanes and barricades, to the Oña, and then to cross that river in\r\norder to continue similar operations through the streets of Gerona.\r\nEven when the city had been subdued, the garrison might still hold\r\nout in the formidable works on the Monjuich and Capuchin heights. The\r\nreduction of the Mercadal and the city, moreover, would have to be\r\ncarried out under a continuous plunging fire from the forts above,\r\nwhich overlooked the whole place. This danger was especially insisted\r\nupon by some of the engineer officers, who declared that it would be\r\nimpossible for the troops to work their way forward over ground so\r\nexposed. As a matter of fact it was proved, after the siege was over\r\nand the forts had been examined by the captors, that this fear had\r\nbeen exaggerated; the angle of fire was such that large sections of\r\nthe town were in no way commanded from the heights, and the streets\r\ncould not have been searched in the fashion that was imagined. But\r\nthis, obvious in December, could not have been known in May[31].\r\nThe second alternative was to commence the attack on Gerona not\r\nfrom the easiest but from the most difficult side, by battering the\r\nlofty fort of Monjuich from the high plateau beside it. The defences\r\nhere were very formidable: the ground was bare exposed rock: but if\r\nMonjuich were once captured it was calculated that the town must\r\nsurrender, as it was completely overlooked by the fort, and had no\r\nfurther protection save its antiquated mediaeval wall. The deduction\r\nthat it would be cheaper in the end to begin with the difficult task\r\nof taking Monjuich, rather than the easier operations against the\r\nMercadal, seemed plausible: its fault was that it presupposed that\r\nAlvarez and his garrison would behave according to the accepted rules\r\nof siegecraft, and yield when their situation became hopeless. But in\r\ndealing with Spanish garrisons the rules of military logic did not\r\nalways act. Alvarez essayed the impossible, and held out behind his\r\ndefective defences for four months after Monjuich fell. The loss of\r\nmen and time that he thereby inflicted on the French was certainly\r\nno less than that which would have been suffered if the besiegers\r\nhad begun with the Mercadal, and worked upwards by incessant street\r\nfighting towards the forts on the height. But it is hard to say that\r\nVerdier erred: he did not know his adversary, and he did know, from\r\nhis experiences at Saragossa, what street fighting meant.\r\n\r\n  [31] See Belmas, iii. 516.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that Verdier’s views were accepted by the\r\nengineer-general, Sanson, who had been specially sent from France by\r\nthe Emperor, to give his opinion on the best mode of procedure. The\r\ndocument which Verdier, Sanson, and Taviel (the commanding artillery\r\nofficer of the 7th Corps) sent to Paris, to justify their choice of\r\nthe upper point of attack, lays stress mainly on the impossibility of\r\nadvancing from the Mercadal under the fire of the upper forts[32].\r\nBut there were other reasons for selecting Monjuich as the point\r\nof attack. It lay far nearer to the road to France and the central\r\nsiege-dépôts beside Sarria and the Pont Mayor. The approaches would\r\nbe over highly defensible ground where, if a disaster occurred, the\r\ndefeated assailant could easily recover himself and oppose a strong\r\nfront to the enemy. The shortness of the front was suitable for\r\nan army of the moderate strength of 14,000 men, which had to deal\r\nwith a fortress whose perimeter, allowing for outlying forts and\r\ninaccessible precipices, was some six miles. Moreover, the ground\r\nin front of the Mercadal had the serious inconvenience of being\r\nliable to inundation; summer spates on the Ter and Oña are rare, but\r\noccur from time to time; and there was the bare chance that when the\r\ntrenches had been opened all might be swept away by the rivers[33].\r\n\r\n  [32] See their letter in Appendix V to Belmas’s account of the\r\n  siege.\r\n\r\n  [33] Note, ibid., ii. p. 502.\r\n\r\nVerdier’s opinion was arrived at after mature reflection: the French\r\nhad appeared in front of Gerona on May 8: the outlying villages\r\non the east had been occupied between the twelfth and eighteenth:\r\nLecchi’s Italians had closed the western exits by occupying the plain\r\nof Salt on the twenty-fourth: the inner posts of observation of the\r\nSpaniards had been cleared off when, on May 30, the Italians seized\r\nthe suburban village of Santa Eugenia, and on June 1 the Germans took\r\npossession of the mountain of Nuestra Señora de los Angeles. But it\r\nwas only on June 6 that the besiegers broke ground, and commenced\r\ntheir trenches and batteries on the plateau of Monjuich. It was\r\nnecessary to make a beginning by subduing the outer defences of\r\nthe fort, the towers or redoubts of San Luis, San Narciso, and San\r\nDaniel: two batteries of 24-pounders were constructed against them,\r\nwhile a third battery of mortars on the ‘Green Mound’ by the Casa den\r\nRoca on the west bank of the Ter, was to play upon the north end of\r\nthe town: Verdier hoped that the bombardment would break the spirit\r\nof the citizens--little knowing the obstinate people with whom he\r\nhad to deal. Five thousand bombs thrown into the place in June and\r\nJuly produced no effect whatever. More batteries on the heights were\r\nthrown up upon the 13th and 15th of June, while on the former day, to\r\ndistract the attention of the Spaniards, Lecchi’s division, in the\r\nplain below, was ordered to open a false attack upon the Mercadal.\r\nThis had good effect as a diversion, since Alvarez had expected an\r\nassault in this quarter, and the long line of trenches thrown up\r\nby the Italians in front of Santa Eugenia attracted much of his\r\nattention. Three days of battering greatly damaged San Luis and San\r\nNarciso, which were no more than round towers of masonry with ditches\r\ncut in the rock, and only two or three guns apiece. The French also\r\ntook possession on the night of the fourteenth and fifteenth of the\r\nremains of the half-destroyed suburb of Pedret, between Monjuich\r\nand the Ter, as if about to establish themselves in a position from\r\nwhich they could attack the low-lying north gate of the town and the\r\nbastion of Santa Maria.\r\n\r\nHitherto the defence had seemed a little passive, but at dawn on the\r\nmorning of the seventeenth Alvarez delivered the first of the many\r\nfurious sallies which he made against the siege lines. A battalion\r\nof Ultonia rushed suddenly down-hill out of Monjuich and drove the\r\nFrench, who were taken completely by surprise, out of the ruins of\r\nPedret. Aided by a smaller detachment, including the artificers of\r\nthe _Crusade_, who came out of the Santa Maria gate, they destroyed\r\nall the works and lodgements of the besiegers in the suburb, and\r\nheld it till they were driven out by two French and one Westphalian\r\nbattalion sent up from Verdier’s reserves. The Spaniards were forced\r\nback into the town, but retired in good order, contented to have\r\nundone three days of the besiegers’ labour. They had lost 155 men,\r\nthe French 128, in this sharp skirmish.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the towers of San Luis and San Narciso, which had been\r\nreduced to shapeless heaps of stone, were carried by assault, with\r\na loss to the French of only 78 men; but an attempt to carry San\r\nDaniel by the same rush was beaten off, this redoubt being still in\r\na tenable state. Its gorge, however, was completely commanded from\r\nthe ruins of San Luis, and access to or exit from it was rendered\r\nso dangerous that Alvarez withdrew its garrison on the next night.\r\nThe possession of these three outworks brought the French close\r\nup to Monjuich, which they could now attack from ground which was\r\nfavourable in every respect, save that it was bare rock lacking\r\nsoil. It was impossible to excavate in it, and all advances had to\r\nbe made by building trenches (if the word is not a misnomer in this\r\ncase) of sandbags and loose stones on the surface of the ground.\r\nThe men working at the end of the sap were therefore completely\r\nexposed, and the work could only proceed at a great expense of life.\r\nNevertheless the preparations advanced rapidly, and on the night\r\nof July 2 an enormous battery of sandbags (called the _Batterie\r\nImpériale_) was thrown up at a distance of only four hundred yards\r\nfrom Monjuich. Next morning it opened on the fort with twenty 16-\r\nand 24-pounders, and soon established a superiority over the fire\r\nof the defence. Several Spanish pieces were dismounted, others had\r\nto be removed because it was too deadly to serve them. But a steady\r\nfire was returned against the besiegers from the Constable and\r\nCalvary forts, on the other side of the Galligan ravine. Nevertheless\r\nMonjuich began to crumble, and it looked as if the end of the siege\r\nwere already approaching. On July 3 there was a breach thirty-five\r\nfeet broad in the fort’s north-eastern bastion, and the Spanish flag\r\nwhich floated over it was thrown down into the ditch by a chance\r\nshot. A young officer named Montorro climbed down, brought it up, and\r\nnailed it to a new flagstaff under the fire of twenty guns. Meanwhile\r\nlong stretches of the parapet of Monjuich were ruined, the ditch\r\nwas half-filled with débris, and the garrison could only protect\r\nthemselves by hasty erections of gabions and sandbags, placed where\r\nthe crest of the masonry had stood.\r\n\r\nBy this time St. Cyr and the covering army had abandoned the position\r\nin the plain of Vich which they had so long occupied. The general\r\nhad, as it seems, convinced himself at last that Blake, who was still\r\nengaged in his unlucky Aragonese campaign, was not likely to appear.\r\nHe therefore moved nearer to Gerona, in order to repress the efforts\r\nof the local _somatenes_, who were giving much trouble to Verdier’s\r\ncommunications. On June 20 he established his head quarters at Caldas\r\nde Malavella, some nine miles to the south-east of Gerona. That\r\nsame evening one of his Italian brigades intercepted and captured a\r\nconvoy of 1,200 oxen which the Governor of Hostalrich was trying to\r\nintroduce into the beleaguered city along one of the mountain-paths\r\nwhich lead to the Capuchin heights from the coast. St. Cyr strung out\r\nhis 14,000 men in a line from San Feliu de Guixols on the sea to the\r\nupper Ter, in a semicircle which covered all the approaches to Gerona\r\nsaving those from the Ampurdam. He visited Verdier’s camp, inspected\r\nthe siege operations, and expressed his opinion that an attack on\r\nthe Mercadal front would have been preferable to that which had been\r\nactually chosen. But he washed his hands of all responsibility, told\r\nVerdier that, since he had chosen to correspond directly with Paris,\r\nhe must take all the praise or blame resulting from his choice,\r\nand refused to countermand or to alter any of his subordinate’s\r\ndispositions. On July 2 however he sent, with some lack of logic, a\r\nsummons of his own to Alvarez, inviting him to surrender on account\r\nof the desperate state of his defences: this he did without informing\r\nVerdier of his move. The Governor returned an indignant negative, and\r\nVerdier wrote in great wrath to complain that if the siege was his\r\naffair, as he had just been told, it was monstrous that his commander\r\nshould correspond with the garrison without his knowledge[34]. The\r\ntwo generals were left on even worse terms than before. St. Cyr,\r\nhowever, gave real assistance to the siege operations at this time by\r\nstorming, on July 5, the little fortified harbour-town of Palamos,\r\nwhich lies on the point of the sea-coast nearest to Gerona, and\r\nhad been hitherto used by the miqueletes as a base from which they\r\ncommunicated by night with the fortress, and at the same time kept\r\nin touch with Tarragona and the English ships of the blockading\r\nsquadron.\r\n\r\n  [34] See St. Cyr to Alvarez and Verdier to the Minister of War at\r\n  Paris, nos. 9 and 11 of Belmas’s Appendices in his second volume,\r\n  pp. 677 and 678.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 4th and 5th of July the defences of Monjuich\r\nappeared in such a ruinous condition that Commandant Fleury, the\r\nengineer officer in charge of the advanced parallel, took the\r\nextraordinary and unjustifiable step of assaulting them at 10 p.m.\r\nwith the troops--two companies only--which lay under his orders,\r\ntrusting that the whole of the guards of the trenches would follow\r\nif he made a lodgement. This presumptuous attack, made contrary\r\nto all the rules of military subordination, was beaten off with a\r\nloss of forty men. Its failure made Verdier determine to give the\r\nfort three days more of continuous bombardment, before attempting\r\nto storm it: the old batteries continued their fire, a new one was\r\nadded to enfilade the north-western bastion, and cover was contrived\r\nat several points to shelter the troops which were to deliver the\r\nassault, till the actual moment of the storm arrived[35]. But three\r\nhundred yards of exposed ground still separated the front trenches\r\nfrom the breach--a distance far too great according to the rules of\r\nsiegecraft. The Spaniards meanwhile, finding it impossible under such\r\na fire to block the breach, which was now broad enough for fifty men\r\nabreast[36], threw up two walls of gabions on each side of it, sank a\r\nditch filled with chevaux-de-frise in front of it, and loopholed some\r\ninterior buildings of the fort, which bore upon its reverse side.\r\n\r\n  [35] Napier says (ii. 250) that ‘the breaching fire ceased for\r\n  four days before the assault,’ and that this caused the failure.\r\n  The statement is in direct contradiction of Vacani (iii. 277)\r\n  who states that Verdier on the contrary ‘proseguì per tre giorni\r\n  il vivo fuoco della sua artilleria,’ and of Belmas (ii. 530) who\r\n  makes the same statement.\r\n\r\n  [36] See Alvarez’s letter in Belmas’s Appendix, no. 15, where he\r\n  says that the breach had this breadth since July 3.\r\n\r\nMonjuich, however, looked in a miserable state when, just before\r\nsunrise on July 7, Verdier launched his columns of assault upon\r\nit. He had collected for the purpose the grenadier and _voltigeur_\r\ncompanies of each of the twenty French, German, and Italian\r\nbattalions of the besieging army, about 2,500 men in all[37]. They\r\nwere divided into two columns, the larger of which went straight\r\nat the breach, while the smaller, which was furnished with ladders,\r\nwas directed to escalade the left face of the demi-lune which covers\r\nthe northern front of Monjuich. The troops passed with no great loss\r\nover the open space which divided them from the work, as its guns\r\nhad all been silenced, and the fire from the more distant forts was\r\nineffective in the dusk. But when they got within close musketry\r\nrange they began to fall fast; the head of the main column, which\r\nwas composed of some sapper companies and the Italian Velites of the\r\nGuard, got up on to the face of the breach, but could never break in.\r\nEvery officer or man who reached the cutting and its chevaux-de-frise\r\nwas shot down; the concentric fire of the defenders so swept the\r\nopening that nothing could live there. Meanwhile the rear of the\r\ncolumn was brought to a stand, partly in, partly outside, the ditch.\r\nThe Spaniards kept playing upon it with musketry and two or three\r\nsmall 2- and 4-pounders, which had been kept under cover and reserved\r\nfor that purpose, firing canister into it at a distance of twenty or\r\nthirty yards. Flesh and blood could not bear this for long, and the\r\nwhole mass broke and went to the rear. Verdier, who had come out to\r\nthe _Batterie Impériale_ to view the assault, had the men rallied\r\nand sent forward a second time: the head of the column again reached\r\nthe breach, and again withered away: the supporting mass gave way at\r\nonce, and fell back much more rapidly than on the first assault. Yet\r\nthe General, most unwisely, insisted on a third attack, which, made\r\nfeebly and without conviction, by men who knew that they were beaten,\r\nonly served to increase the casualty list. Meanwhile the escalade of\r\nthe demi-lune by the smaller column had been repelled with ease: the\r\nassailants barely succeeded in crossing the ditch and planting a few\r\nladders against the scarp: no one survived who tried to mount them,\r\nand the troops drew off.\r\n\r\n  [37] This seems a low estimate of Belmas, as the _compagnies\r\n  d’élite_ formed a third of each battalion.\r\n\r\nThis bloody repulse cost the French 1,079 casualties, including\r\nseventy-seven officers killed or wounded--much more than a third\r\nof the troops engaged. It is clear, therefore, that it was not\r\ncourage which had been lacking: nor could it be said that the\r\nenemy’s artillery fire had not been subdued, nor that the breach was\r\ninsufficient, nor that the 300 yards of open ground crossed by the\r\ncolumn had been a fatal obstacle; indeed, they had been passed with\r\nlittle loss. The mistake of Verdier had been that he attacked before\r\nthe garrison was demoralized--the same error made by the English\r\nat Badajoz in 1811 and at San Sebastian in 1813. A broad breach by\r\nitself does not necessarily make a place untenable, if the spirit\r\nof the defenders is high, and if they are prepared with all the\r\nresources of the military art for resisting the stormers, as were the\r\nGeronese on July 7-8. The garrison lost, it may be remarked, only\r\n123 men, out of a strength of 787 present in the fort that morning.\r\nThe casualty list, however, was somewhat increased by the accidental\r\nexplosion, apparently by a careless gunner, of the magazine of the\r\ntower of San Juan, alongside of the Galligan, which was destroyed\r\nwith its little garrison of twenty-five men.\r\n\r\nThe repulse of the assault of Monjuich thoroughly demoralized\r\nthe besieging army: the resistance of the Spaniards had been so\r\nfierce, the loss they had inflicted so heavy, that Verdier’s motley\r\ncollection of French, German, Lombard, and Neapolitan regiments lost\r\nheart and confidence. Their low spirits were made manifest by the\r\nsimultaneous outbreak of desertion and disease, the two inevitable\r\nmarks of a decaying morale. All through the second half of July and\r\nAugust the hospitals grew gradually fuller, not only from sunstroke\r\ncases (which were frequent on the bare, hot, rocky ground of the\r\nheights), but from dysentery and malaria. The banks of the Ter always\r\npossessed a reputation for epidemics--twice in earlier centuries\r\na French army had perished before the walls of Gerona by plagues,\r\nwhich the citizens piously attributed to their patron, San Narciso.\r\nIt was mainly because he realized the depression of his troops that\r\nVerdier refrained from any more assaults, and went on from July 9 to\r\nAugust 4 battering Monjuich incessantly, while he cautiously pushed\r\nforward his trenches, till they actually reached the ditch of the\r\ndemi-lune which covers the northern front of the fort. The garrison\r\nwas absolutely overwhelmed by the incessant bombardment, which\r\ndestroyed every piece of upstanding masonry, and prevented them from\r\nrebuilding anything that was demolished. They were forced to lurk in\r\nthe casemates, and to burrow for shelter in the débris which filled\r\nthe interior of the work. Three large breaches had been made at\r\nvarious points, yet Verdier would never risk another assault, till\r\non August 4 his approaches actually crowned the lip of the ditch of\r\nthe demi-lune, and his sappers had blown in its counterscarp. The\r\nruined little outwork was then stormed with a loss of only forty men.\r\nThis put the French in the possession of good cover only a few yards\r\nfrom the main body of the fort. Proceeding with the same caution as\r\nbefore, they made their advances against Monjuich by mining: on the\r\nnight of the 8th-9th August no less than twenty-three mines under the\r\nglacis of the fort were exploded simultaneously. This left a gaping\r\nvoid in front of the original breach of July 7, and filled up the\r\nditch with débris for many yards on either side: part of the interior\r\nof the fort was clearly visible from the besiegers’ trenches.\r\n\r\nOnly one resource for saving Monjuich remained to Alvarez--a sortie\r\nfor the expulsion of the enemy from their advanced works. It was\r\nexecuted with great courage at midday on August 9, while at the same\r\ntime separate demonstrations to distract the enemy were made at two\r\nother points. The column from Monjuich had considerable success;\r\nit stormed two advanced batteries, spiked their guns, and set fire\r\nto their gabions; the French were cleared out of many of their\r\ntrenches, but made head behind one of the rear batteries, where\r\nthey were joined by their reserves, who finally thrust back the\r\nsallying force into the fort. The damage done, though considerable,\r\ncould be repaired in a day. Verdier gave orders for the storm of\r\nthe dilapidated fort on the night of August 11, and borrowed a\r\nregiment from St. Cyr’s covering army to lead the assault, being\r\nstill very doubtful of the temper of his own troops. But at six on\r\nthe preceding afternoon an explosion was heard in Monjuich, and great\r\npart of its battered walls flew up into the air. The Spaniards had\r\nquietly evacuated it a few minutes before, after preparing mines for\r\nits demolition. The French, when they entered, found nothing but a\r\nshapeless mass of stones and eighteen disabled cannon. The garrison\r\nhad lost, in the sixty-five days of its defence, 962 men killed and\r\nwounded; the besiegers had, first and last, suffered something like\r\nthree times this loss.\r\n\r\nWhile the bombardment of Monjuich was going on, the Spanish generals\r\noutside the fortress had at last begun to make serious efforts for\r\nits assistance. Not only had the _somatenes_ redoubled their activity\r\nagainst Verdier’s convoys, and several times succeeded in destroying\r\nthem or turning them back, but Coupigny had at last begun to move,\r\nfor he saw that since Blake’s rout at Belchite on June 18 he, and he\r\nalone, possessed an organized body of troops on this side of Spain,\r\nsmall though it was. Unable to face St. Cyr in the field, he tried\r\nat least to throw succours into Gerona by the mountain paths from\r\nthe south, if he could do no more. The first attempt was disastrous:\r\nthree battalions started from Hostalrich under an English adventurer,\r\nRalph Marshall, whom Alvarez had suggested for the command of this\r\nexpedition. They evaded the first line of the covering army, but at\r\nCastellar, on July 10, ran into the very centre of Pino’s division,\r\nwhich had concentrated from all sides for their destruction. Marshall\r\nescaped into Gerona with no more than twelve men: 40 officers and 878\r\nrank and file laid down their arms; the rest of the column, some 600\r\nor 700 men, evaded surrender by dispersion[38].\r\n\r\n  [38] St. Cyr, Vacani, and Belmas all say that Marshall escaped\r\n  by hoisting the white flag, and taking to the hills while terms\r\n  of capitulation were being arranged. Coupigny on the other\r\n  hand (see his letter in Belmas’s Appendix no. 18) says that\r\n  Marshall behaved admirably, but was not seconded by his men,\r\n  who flinched and abandoned him. Rich, the officer who failed to\r\n  guide the column aright, was not, as Napier supposed (ii. 236),\r\n  an Englishman, but a Catalan, as is shown by his Christian name\r\n  Narciso. Ric or Rich is a common name in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nEqually disastrous, though on a smaller scale, was another attempt\r\nmade on August 4 by a party of 300 miqueletes to enter Gerona: they\r\neluded St. Cyr, but on arriving at the entry of the Galligan, close\r\nunder the forts, made the unfortunate mistake of entering the convent\r\nof San Daniel, which the garrison had been compelled to evacuate a\r\nfew days before. It was now in the French lines, and the Catalans\r\nwere all taken prisoners. It was not till August 17, six days\r\nafter the fall of Monjuich, that Alvarez obtained his first feeble\r\nreinforcement: the miquelete battalion of Cervera, with a draft for\r\nthat of Vich already in the garrison, altogether 800 bayonets, got\r\ninto the city on the west side, by eluding Lecchi’s Italians in\r\nthe plain and fording the Ter. They were much needed, for Alvarez\r\nwas complaining to the Catalan Junta that he had now only 1,500\r\nable-bodied men left of his original 5,000[39].\r\n\r\n  [39] This must have been an exaggeration, as 2,000 men under\r\n  arms of the old garrison survived to surrender in December. See\r\n  Alvarez’s letter, on p. 686 of Belmas’s Appendix.\r\n\r\nVerdier had written to his master, after the capture of Monjuich, to\r\nannounce that Gerona must infallibly surrender within eight or ten\r\ndays[40], now that it had nothing but an antiquated mediaeval wall\r\nto oppose to his cannon. So far, however, was he from being a true\r\nprophet that, as a matter of fact, the second and longer episode of\r\nthe siege, which was to be protracted far into the winter, had only\r\njust begun.\r\n\r\n  [40] See Verdier’s letter of August 12, in Belmas’s Appendix no.\r\n  11, p. 700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF GERONA. AUGUST-DECEMBER, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Monjuich had been evacuated, the position of Gerona was\r\nundoubtedly perilous: of the two mountain summits which command the\r\ncity one was now entirely in the hands of the French; for not only\r\nthe great fort itself but several of the smaller works above the\r\nravine of the Galligan--such as the fortified convent of San Daniel\r\nand the ruined tower of San Juan--had been lost. The front exposed\r\nto attack now consisted of the northern section of the old city\r\nwall, from the bastion of Santa Maria at the water’s edge, to the\r\ntower of La Gironella, which forms the north-eastern angle of the\r\nplace, and lies further up the slope of the Capuchin heights than any\r\nother portion of the enceinte. The space between these two points\r\nwas simply covered by a mediaeval wall set with small round towers:\r\nneither the towers nor the curtain between them had been built to\r\nhold artillery. Indeed the only spots on this front where guns had\r\nbeen placed were (1) the comparatively modern bastion of Santa Maria,\r\n(2) a work erected under and about the Gironella, and called the\r\n‘Redoubt of the Germans,’ and (3, 4) two parts of the wall called the\r\nplatforms[41] of San Pedro and San Cristobal, which had been widened\r\ntill they could carry a few heavy guns. On the rest of the enceinte,\r\nowing to its narrowness, nothing but wall-pieces and two-pounders\r\ncould be mounted. The parts of the curtain most exposed to attack\r\nwere the sections named Santa Lucia, San Pedro, San Cristobal, and\r\nLas Sarracinas, from churches or quarters which lay close behind\r\nthem. With nothing but an antiquated wall, seven to nine feet thick,\r\nthirty feet high, and destitute of a ditch, it seemed that this side\r\nof Gerona was doomed to destruction within a few days.\r\n\r\n  [41] Some call them bastions, but they are too small to deserve\r\n  that name.\r\n\r\nBut there were points in the position which rendered the attack\r\nmore difficult than might have been expected. The first was that any\r\napproaches directed against this front would be exposed to a flanking\r\nfire from the forts on the Capuchin heights, especially from the\r\nCalvary and Chapter redoubts. The second was that the greater part\r\nof the weak sections of the wall were within a re-entering angle;\r\nfor the tower of Santa Lucia and the ‘Redoubt of the Germans’ by the\r\nGironella project, and the curtains between them are in a receding\r\nsweep of the enceinte. Attacks on these ill-fortified sections would\r\nbe outflanked and enfiladed by the two stronger works. The only\r\nexposed part of the curtain was that called Santa Lucia, running\r\nfrom the tower of that name down to the bastion of Santa Maria.\r\nLastly, the parallels which the French might construct from their\r\nbase on Monjuich would have to be built on a down slope, overlooked\r\nby loftier ground, and when they reached the foot of the walls they\r\nwould be in a sort of gulley or bottom, into which the defenders of\r\nthe city could look down from above. The only point from which the\r\nnorth end of Gerona could be approached from flat ground and without\r\ndisadvantages of slope, is the short front of less than 200 yards\r\nbreadth between the foot of Monjuich and the bank of the Ter. Here,\r\nin the ruins of the suburb of Pedret, there was plenty of cover, a\r\nsoil easy to work, and a level terrain as far as the foot of the\r\nSanta Maria bastion. The engineers of the besieging army selected\r\nthree sections of wall as their objective. The first was the ‘Redoubt\r\nof the Germans’ and the tower of La Gironella, the highest and most\r\ncommanding works in this part of the enceinte: once established in\r\nthese, they could overlook and dominate the whole city. The other\r\npoints of attack were chosen for the opposite reason--because\r\nthey were intrinsically weak in themselves, not because they were\r\nimportant or dominating parts of the defences. The curtain of Santa\r\nLucia in particular seemed to invite attack, as being in a salient\r\nangle, unprotected by flanking fire, and destitute of any artillery\r\nof its own.\r\n\r\nVerdier, therefore, on the advice of his engineers, set to work\r\nto attack these points of the enceinte between La Gironella and\r\nSanta Maria. New batteries erected amid the ruins of Monjuich were\r\nlevelled against them, in addition to such of the older batteries\r\nas could still be utilized. On the front by Pedret also, where\r\nnothing had hitherto been done, works were prepared for guns to be\r\ndirected against Santa Maria and Santa Lucia. Meanwhile a perpetual\r\nbombardment with shell was kept up, against the whole quarter of the\r\ntown that lay behind the selected points of attack. Mortars were\r\nalways playing, not only from the Monjuich heights but from two\r\nbatteries erected on the so-called ‘Green Mound’ in the plain beyond\r\nthe river Ter. Their effect was terrible: almost every house in the\r\nnorthern quarter of Gerona was unroofed or destroyed: the population\r\nhad to take refuge in cellars, where, after a few days, they began\r\nto die fast--all the more so that food was just beginning to run\r\nshort as August advanced. From the 14th to the 30th of that month\r\nVerdier’s attack was developing itself: by its last day four breaches\r\nhad been established: one, about forty feet broad, in the curtain\r\nof St. Lucia, two close together in the works at La Gironella[42],\r\nthe fourth and smallest in the platform of San Cristobal. But the\r\napproaches were still far from the foot of the wall, the fire of the\r\noutlying Spanish works, especially the Calvary fort, was unsubdued,\r\nand though the guns along the attacked front had all been silenced,\r\nthe French artillery had paid dearly both in lives and in material\r\nfor the advantage they had gained. Moreover sickness was making\r\ndreadful ravages in the ranks of the besieging army. The malarious\r\npestilence on which the Spaniards had relied had appeared, after\r\na sudden and heavy rainfall had raised the Ter and Oña beyond\r\ntheir banks, and inundated the whole plain of Salt. By malaria,\r\ndysentery and sunstroke Verdier had lost 5,000 men, in addition to\r\nhis casualties in the siege. Many of them were convalescents in the\r\nhospitals of Perpignan and Figueras, but it was hard to get them\r\nback to the front; the _somatenes_ made the roads impassable for\r\nsmall detachments, and the officers on the line of communication,\r\nbeing very short of men, were given to detaining drafts that reached\r\nthem on their way to Gerona[43]. Hence Verdier, including his\r\nartillerymen and sappers, had less than 10,000 men left for the\r\nsiege, and these much discouraged by its interminable length, short\r\nof officers, and sickly. This was not enough to guard a periphery\r\nof six miles, and messengers were continually slipping in or out of\r\nGerona, between the widely scattered camps of the French.\r\n\r\n  [42] Belmas, for convenience’ sake, distinguishes these two\r\n  breaches by calling the northern one the breach in the Barracks,\r\n  the southern the breach in the Latrines of the ‘German Redoubt.’\r\n\r\n  [43] Between Gerona and Perpignan, for the defence of\r\n  communications and the garrisoning of Figueras, there were\r\n  at this time the Valais battalion, one battalion of the\r\n  Confederation of the Rhine (Waldeck-Reuss-Schwarzburg), one\r\n  battalion each of the French 7th and 113th--not more than 2,300\r\n  bayonets in all. See Returns of the Army of Spain for Sept. 15,\r\n  1809.\r\n\r\nOn August 31 a new phase of the siege began. In response to the\r\nconstant appeals of Alvarez to the Catalan Junta, and the consequent\r\ncomplaints of the Junta alike to the Captain-General Blake, and to\r\nthe central government at Seville, something was at last about to\r\nbe done to relieve Gerona. The supreme Central Junta, in reply to a\r\nformal representation of the Catalans dated August 16[44], had sent\r\nBlake 6,000,000 reals in cash, and a peremptory order to march on\r\nGerona whatever the state of his army might be, authorizing him to\r\ncall out all the _somatenes_ of the province in his aid. The general,\r\nwho had at last returned to Tarragona, obeyed, though entirely\r\nlacking confidence in his means of success; and on the thirty-first\r\nhis advance guard was skirmishing with St. Cyr’s covering army on the\r\nheights to the south of the Ter.\r\n\r\n  [44] For this correspondence see the Appendices nos. 16 and 24-5\r\n  in vol. ii of Belmas.\r\n\r\nBlake’s army, it will be remembered, had been completely routed at\r\nBelchite by Suchet on June 18. The wrecks of his Aragonese division\r\nhad gradually rallied at Tortosa, those of his Valencian divisions\r\nat Morella: but even by the end of July he had only a few thousand\r\nmen collected, and he had lost every gun of his artillery. For many\r\nweeks he could do nothing but press the Junta of Valencia to fill\r\nthe depleted ranks of his regiments with recruits, to reconstitute\r\nhis train, and to provide him with new cannon. Aragon had been\r\nlost--nothing could be drawn from thence: Catalonia, distracted by\r\nSuchet’s demonstration on its western flank, did not do as much as\r\nmight have been expected in its own defence. The Junta was inclined\r\nto favour the employment of miqueletes and _somatenes_, and to\r\nundervalue the troops of the line: it forgot that the irregulars,\r\nthough they did admirable work in harassing the enemy, could not be\r\nrelied upon to operate in large masses or strike a decisive blow.\r\nStill, the regiments at Tarragona, Lerida, and elsewhere had been\r\nsomewhat recruited before August was out.\r\n\r\nBlake’s field army was composed of some 14,000 men: there were five\r\nValencian regiments--those which had been least mishandled in the\r\ncampaign of Aragon--with the relics of six of the battalions which\r\nReding had brought from Granada in 1808[45], two of Lazan’s old\r\nAragonese corps, and five or six of the regiments which had formed\r\nthe original garrison of Catalonia. The battalions were very weak--it\r\ntook twenty-four of them to make up 13,000 infantry: of cavalry there\r\nwere only four squadrons, of artillery only two batteries. Those of\r\nthe rank and file who were not raw recruits were the vanquished of\r\nMolins de Rey and Valls, or of Maria and Belchite. They had no great\r\nconfidence in Blake, and he had still less in them. Despite the\r\norders received from Seville, which bade him risk all for the relief\r\nof Gerona, he was determined not to fight another pitched battle.\r\nThe memories of Belchite were too recent to be forgotten. Though\r\nmuch obloquy has been poured upon his head for this resolve, he was\r\nprobably wise in his decision. St. Cyr had still some 12,000 men in\r\nhis covering army, who had taken no share in the siege: their morale\r\nwas intact, and they had felt little fatigue or privation. They could\r\nbe, and were in fact, reinforced by 4,000 men from Verdier’s force\r\nwhen the stress came. Blake, therefore, was, so far as regular troops\r\nwent, outnumbered by the French, especially in cavalry and artillery.\r\nHe could not trust in time of battle the miqueletes, of whom some\r\n4,000 or 5,000 from the Ampurdam and Central Catalonia came to join\r\nhim. He thought that it might be possible to elude or outflank\r\nSt. Cyr, to lure him to divide his forces into scattered bodies by\r\nthreatening many points at once, or, on the other hand, to induce him\r\nto concentrate on one short front, and so to leave some of the exits\r\nof Gerona open. But a battle with the united French army he would not\r\nrisk under any conditions.\r\n\r\n  [45] See the ‘morning state’ given in Arteche, vii. pp. 565-6.\r\n  The Valencian regiments were Savoia, Orihuela, Voluntarios de\r\n  Valencia, and Almanza, with about 5,000 bayonets. Of Reding’s old\r\n  troops from the south there were Almeria, Baza, Santa Fé, 1st\r\n  of Granada (otherwise called Iliberia), and two battalions of\r\n  Provincial Grenadiers, something over 3,000 men. The rest were\r\n  mainly Catalans.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr, however, was too wary for his opponent: he wanted to fight\r\nat all costs, and he was prepared to risk a disturbance of the siege\r\noperations, if he could catch Blake in the open and bring him to\r\naction. The moment that pressure on his outposts, by regular troops\r\ncoming from the south, was reported, he drew together Souham’s and\r\nPino’s divisions on the short line between San Dalmay on the right\r\nand Casa de Selva on the left, across the high road from Barcelona.\r\nAt the same time he sent stringent orders to Verdier to abandon\r\nthe unimportant sections of his line of investment, and to come to\r\nreinforce the field army at the head of his French division, which\r\nstill counted 4,000 bayonets. Verdier accordingly marched to join\r\nhis chief, leaving Lecchi’s Italians--now little more than 2,000\r\nstrong--to watch the west side of Gerona, and handing over the charge\r\nof the works on Monjuich, the new approaches, and the park at Pont\r\nMayor, to the Westphalians. He abandoned all the outlying posts on\r\nthe heights, even the convent of San Daniel, the village of Campdura,\r\nand the peak of Nuestra Señora de los Angeles. Only 4,600 infantry\r\nand 2,000 gunners and sappers were left facing the garrison: but\r\nAlvarez was too weak to drive off even such a small force.\r\n\r\nOn September 1 Blake ostentatiously displayed the heads of his\r\ncolumns in front of St. Cyr’s position; but while the French general\r\nwas eagerly awaiting his attack, and preparing his counter-stroke,\r\nthe Spaniard’s game was being played out in another quarter. While\r\nRovira and Claros with their miqueletes made noisy demonstration\r\nfrom the north against the Westphalians, and threatened the park and\r\nthe camp at Sarria, Blake had detached one of his divisions, that of\r\nGarcia Conde, some 4,000 strong, far to the left beyond St. Cyr’s\r\nflank: this corps had with it a convoy of more than a thousand mules\r\nladen with provisions, and a herd of cattle. It completely escaped\r\nthe notice of the French, and marching from Amer at break of day came\r\ndown into the plain of Salt at noon, far in the rear of St. Cyr’s\r\narmy. Garcia Conde had the depleted Italian division of the siege\r\ncorps in front of him: one of the brigadiers, the Pole Milosewitz,\r\nwas in command that day, Lecchi being in hospital. This small force,\r\nwhich vainly believed itself covered from attack by St. Cyr’s corps,\r\nhad kept no look-out to the rear, being wholly intent on watching\r\nthe garrison. It was surprised by the Spanish column, cut into two\r\nhalves, and routed. Garcia Conde entered the Mercadal in triumph with\r\nhis convoy, and St. Cyr first learnt what had occurred when he saw\r\nthe broken remnants of the Italians pouring into the rear of his own\r\nline at Fornells.\r\n\r\nThat night Gerona was free of enemies on its southern and eastern\r\nsides, and Alvarez communicated freely with Rovira’s and Claros’s\r\nirregulars, who had forced in the Westphalian division and compelled\r\nit to concentrate in Monjuich and the camp by the great park near\r\nSarria. The garrison reoccupied the ruined convent of San Daniel by\r\nthe Galligan, and placed a strong party in the hermitage on the peak\r\nof Nuestra Señora de los Angeles. It also destroyed all the advanced\r\ntrenches on the slopes of Monjuich. On the next morning, however, it\r\nbegan to appreciate the fact that the siege had not been raised. St.\r\nCyr sent back Verdier’s division to rejoin the Westphalians, and with\r\nthem the wrecks of Lecchi’s routed battalions. He added to the force\r\nunder Verdier half Pino’s Italian division--six fresh battalions.\r\nWith these reinforcements the old siege-lines could be reoccupied,\r\nand the Spaniards were forced back from the points outside the walls\r\nwhich they had reoccupied on the night of September 1.\r\n\r\nBy sending away such a large proportion of the 16,000 men that he had\r\nconcentrated for battle on the previous day, St. Cyr left himself\r\nonly some 10,000 men for a general action with Blake, if the latter\r\nshould resolve to fight. But the Spanish general, being without\r\nGarcia Conde’s division, had also no more than 10,000 men in line.\r\nNot only did he refuse to advance, but when St. Cyr, determined to\r\nfight at all costs, marched against him with offensive intentions,\r\nhe hastily retreated as far as Hostalrich, two marches to the rear.\r\nThere he broke up his army, which had exhausted all its provisions.\r\nSt. Cyr did the same and for the same reasons; his men had to\r\ndisperse in order to live. He says in his memoirs that if Blake had\r\nshown a bold front against him, and forced him to keep the covering\r\narmy concentrated for two more days, the siege would have had to be\r\nraised. For the covering army had advanced against the Spaniards on\r\nSeptember 2 with only two days’ rations, it had exhausted its stores,\r\nand eaten up the country-side. On the fourth it would have had to\r\nretire, or to break up into small fractions, leaving the siege-corps\r\nunprotected. St. Cyr doubted whether the retreat would have ceased\r\nbefore Figueras was reached. But it is more probable that he would\r\nhave merely fallen back to join Verdier, and to live for some days\r\non the dépôts of Pont Mayor and Sarria. He could have offered battle\r\nagain under the walls of Gerona, with all his forces united. Blake\r\nmight have got into close touch with Alvarez, and have thrown what\r\nconvoys he pleased into the town; but as long as St. Cyr and Verdier\r\nwith 22,000 men lay opposite him, he could not have risked any\r\nmore. The situation, in short, would have been that which occurred\r\nin February 1811 under the walls of Badajoz, when Mortier faced\r\nMendizabal, and would probably have ended in the same fashion, by the\r\nFrench attacking and driving off the relieving army. Blake, then, may\r\nbe blamed somewhat for his excessive caution in giving way so rapidly\r\nbefore St. Cyr’s advance: but if we remember the quality of his\r\ntroops and the inevitable result of a battle, it is hard to censure\r\nhim overmuch.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Garcia Conde, whose movements were most happy and adroit,\r\nreinforced the garrison of Gerona up to its original strength of\r\n5,000 bayonets, by making over to Alvarez four whole battalions and\r\nsome picked companies from other corps, and prepared to leave the\r\ntown with the rest of his division and the vast drove of mules, whose\r\nburden had been discharged into the magazines. If he had dedicated\r\nhis whole force to strengthening the garrison, the additional troops\r\nwould have eaten up in a few days all the provisions that the\r\nconvoy had brought in[46]. Accordingly he started off at two a.m.\r\non September 4 with some 1,200 men, by the upland path that leads\r\npast the hermitage of Los Angeles: St. Cyr had just placed Pino’s\r\ntroops from the covering army to guard the heights to the south-east\r\nof Gerona, but Garcia Conde, warned by the peasants of their exact\r\nposition, slipped between the posts and got off to Hostalrich with a\r\nloss of no more than fifty men[47].\r\n\r\n  [46] The reinforcements left behind by Garcia Conde consisted of\r\n  two battalions of Baza (one of Reding’s old Granadan regiments),\r\n  with 1,368 bayonets, two Catalan ‘tercios,’ 1st and 2nd of\r\n  Talarn, with 716 bayonets, and select companies of 1st of Granada\r\n  (Iliberia), 2nd of Vich, and Voluntarios de Tarragona--in all\r\n  apparently about 2,707 men.\r\n\r\n  The table on p. 375 of Arteche’s vol. vii seems to err in\r\n  crediting the Cervera ‘tercio’ to Garcia: this had come in on\r\n  Aug. 17, as described on p. 35. On the other hand the company of\r\n  Voluntarios de Tarragona should be credited to him.\r\n\r\n  [47] St. Cyr tells a story to the effect that he had placed\r\n  Mazzuchelli’s brigade of Pino’s division in ambush behind the\r\n  hill of Palau to intercept Garcia Conde, and that the Spaniards\r\n  would have marched right into the trap on Sept. 3, if the\r\n  Italians had not been stupid enough to sound the _réveil_ at\r\n  dawn, and so warn the enemy of their existence. But the Spanish\r\n  accounts of Minali and Claros are quite different (see Arteche,\r\n  vii. 377); they are to the effect that Garcia Conde had intended\r\n  to start _at dusk_ on the third, but, hearing firing on the side\r\n  of Palau, deferred his exit and took another road. If he was\r\n  starting at 7 or 8 o’clock at night on the third, he cannot have\r\n  been warned by the morning bugles at 4 o’clock on the previous\r\n  morning. See St. Cyr, p. 234, and Napier, ii. 245, for the\r\n  French story, which the latter takes over whole from the former.\r\n  Belmas and Vacani do not give the tale, though they have a full\r\n  narration of the escape of Garcia Conde.\r\n\r\nBefore he could consider his position safe, Verdier had to complete\r\nthe lines of investment: this he did on September 5 by driving off\r\nthe intermediate posts which Alvarez had thrown out from the Capuchin\r\nheights, to link the town with the garrison in the hermitage of\r\nNuestra Señora de los Angeles. Mazzuchelli’s brigade stormed the\r\nhermitage itself on the following day, with a loss of about eighty\r\nmen, and massacred the greater part of the garrison. On that same\r\nday, however, the French suffered a small disaster in another part of\r\nthe environs. General Joba, who had been sent with three battalions\r\nto clear the road to Figueras from the bands of Claros and Rovira,\r\nwas beaten and slain at San Gregorio by those chiefs. But the\r\nmiqueletes afterwards retired to the mountains, and the road became\r\nintermittently passable, at least for large bodies of men.\r\n\r\nIt was not till September 11, however, that Verdier recommenced the\r\nactual siege, and bade his batteries open once more upon Gerona.\r\nThe eleven days of respite since Blake interrupted the bombardment\r\non September 1 had been invaluable to the garrison, who had cleared\r\naway the débris from the foot of the breaches, replaced the damaged\r\nartillery on the front of attack, and thrown up interior defences\r\nbehind the shattered parts of the wall. They had also destroyed all\r\nthe advanced trenches of the besiegers, which had to be reconstructed\r\nat much cost of life. In four days Verdier had recovered most of\r\nthe lost ground, when he was surprised by a vigorous sally from the\r\ngate of San Pedro: the garrison, dashing out at three p.m., stormed\r\nthe three nearest breaching batteries, spiked their guns, and filled\r\nin all the trenches which were advancing towards the foot of the\r\nwalls. Four days’ work was thus undone in an hour, and it was only\r\non September 19 that Verdier had reconstructed his works, and pushed\r\nforward so far towards his objective that he considered an assault\r\npossible. He then begged St. Cyr to lend him a brigade of fresh\r\ntroops, pleading that the siege-corps was now so weak in numbers,\r\nand so demoralized by its losses, that he did not consider that the\r\nmen would do themselves justice at a storm. The losses of officers\r\nhad been fearful: one battalion was commanded by a lieutenant,\r\nanother had been reduced to fifty men; desertion was rampant among\r\nseveral of the foreign corps. Of 14,000 infantry[48] of the French,\r\nWestphalian, and Italian divisions less than 6,000 now remained. So\r\nfar as mere siegecraft went, as he explained to St. Cyr, ‘the affair\r\nmight be considered at an end. We have made four large practicable\r\nbreaches, each of them sufficient to reduce the town. But the troops\r\ncannot be trusted.’ St. Cyr refused to lend a man for the assault,\r\nwriting with polite irony that ‘every general has his own task:\r\nyours is to take Gerona with the resources placed at your disposal\r\nby the government for that object, and the officers named by the\r\ngovernment to conduct the siege[49].’ He added that he considered,\r\nfrom its past conduct, that the morale of the siege-corps was rather\r\ngood than bad. He should not, therefore, allow the covering army to\r\njoin the assault; but he would lend the whole of Pino’s division to\r\ntake charge of Monjuich and the camps, during the storm, and would\r\nmake a demonstration against the Mercadal, to distract the enemy\r\nfrom the breaches. With this Verdier had to be content, and, after\r\nmaking two final protests, concentrated all his brigades save those\r\nof the Westphalian division, and composed with them four columns,\r\namounting to some 3,000 men, directing one against each of the four\r\nbreaches. That sent against the platform of San Cristobal was a mere\r\ndemonstration of 150 men, but the other three were heavy masses: the\r\nItalians went against Santa Lucia, the French brigade against the\r\nsouthern breach in the ‘Redoubt of the Germans,’ the Berg troops\r\nagainst the northern one. A separate demonstration was made against\r\nthe Calvary fort, whose unsubdued fire still flanked the breaches, in\r\nthe hope that its defenders might be prevented from interfering in\r\nthe main struggle.\r\n\r\n  [48] Verdier did not exaggerate: see Appendix no. 2 at end of\r\n  this volume, showing that his three divisions had lost 8,161 men\r\n  out of 14,044 by September 15.\r\n\r\n  [49] See the acrid correspondence between St. Cyr and Verdier in\r\n  Appendices nos. 37-8, 40-6 of Belmas, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nAlvarez, who had noted the French columns marching from all quarters\r\nto take shelter, before the assault, in the trenches on the slopes\r\nof Monjuich and in front of Pedret, had fair warning of what was\r\ncoming, and had done his best to provide against the danger. The\r\nless important parts of the enceinte had been put in charge of\r\nthe citizens of the ‘Crusade,’ and the picked companies of every\r\nregiment had been told off the breaches. The Englishman, Ralph\r\nMarshall, was in charge of the curtain of Santa Lucia, William Nash,\r\nthe Spanish-Irish colonel of Ultonia, commanded at the two breaches\r\nunder La Gironella: Brigadier Fournas, the second-in-command of the\r\ngarrison, had general supervision of the defences; he had previously\r\ntaken charge of Monjuich during the great assault in August.\r\nEverything had been done to prepare a second line of resistance\r\nbehind the breaches; barricades had been erected, houses loopholed,\r\nand a great many marksmen disposed on roofs and church towers, which\r\nlooked down on the rear-side of the gaps in the wall.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock in the afternoon of September 19 the three columns\r\ndestined for the northern breaches descended from Monjuich on the\r\nside of San Daniel, crossed the Galligan, and plunged into the\r\nhollow at the foot of the ‘Redoubt of the Germans.’ At the same\r\nmoment the fourth column started from the ruins of the tower of San\r\nJuan to attack the curtain of Santa Lucia. The diversion against the\r\nCalvary fort was made at the same moment, and beaten off in a few\r\nminutes, so that the fire of this work was not neutralized during\r\nthe assault according to Verdier’s expectation. The main assault,\r\nnevertheless, was delivered with great energy, despite the flanking\r\nfire. At the two points of attack under La Gironella the stormers\r\ntwice won, crossed, and descended from the breach, forcing their\r\nway into the ruined barracks behind. But they were mown down by the\r\nterrible musketry fire from the houses, and finally expelled with\r\nthe bayonet. At the Santa Lucia curtain the Italians scaled the\r\nbreach, but were brought up by a perpendicular drop of twelve feet\r\nbehind it--the foot of the wall in this quarter chancing to be much\r\nhigher than the level of the street below. They held the crest of the\r\nbreach for some time, but were finally worsted in a long and furious\r\nexchange of fire with the Spaniards on the roofs and churches before\r\nthem, and recoiled. The few surviving officers rallied the stormers,\r\nand brought them up for a second assault, but at the end of two hours\r\nof hard fighting all were constrained to retire to their trenches.\r\nThey had lost 624 killed and wounded, including three colonels (the\r\nonly three surviving in the whole of Verdier’s corps) and thirty\r\nother officers. The Spanish loss had been 251, among them Colonel\r\nMarshall, who was mortally wounded at his post on the Santa Lucia\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIEGE OF GERONA]\r\n\r\nVerdier accused his troops of cowardice, which seems to have been\r\nunjust. St. Cyr wrote to the Minister of War to express his opinion\r\nthat his subordinate was making an excuse to cover his own error,\r\nin judging that a town must fall merely because there were large\r\nbreaches in its walls[50]. ‘The columns stopped for ninety minutes\r\non the breaches under as heavy a fire as has ever been seen. There\r\nwas some disorder at the end, but that is not astonishing in view of\r\nthe heavy loss suffered before the retreat. I do not think that\r\npicked grenadiers would have done any better, and I am convinced\r\nthat the assault failed because the obstacles to surmount were\r\ntoo great.’ The fact was that the Spaniards had fought with such\r\nadmirable obstinacy, and had so well arranged their inner defences,\r\nthat it did not suffice that the breaches should have been perfectly\r\npracticable. At the northern assault the stormers actually penetrated\r\ninto the buildings behind the gaps in the ruined wall, but could\r\nnot get further forward[51]. In short, the history of the siege of\r\nGerona gives a clear corroboration of the old military axiom that\r\nno town should ever surrender merely because it has been breached,\r\nand justifies Napoleon’s order that every governor who capitulated\r\nwithout having stood at least one assault should be sent before a\r\ncourt martial. It refutes the excuses of the too numerous commanders\r\nwho have surrendered merely because there was a practicable breach in\r\ntheir walls, like Imaz at Badajoz in 1811. If all Spanish generals\r\nhad been as wary and as resolute as Mariano Alvarez, the Peninsular\r\nWar would have taken some unexpected turns. The moral of the defences\r\nof Tarifa, Burgos, and San Sebastian will be found to be the same as\r\nthat of the defence of Gerona.\r\n\r\n  [50] ‘Il paraît que l’on a employé la ressource, malheureusement\r\n  trop usitée en pareil cas, de dire que les troupes n’ont pas fait\r\n  leur devoir, ce qui produit de justes réclamations de leur part.’\r\n  (St. Cyr to the Minister, Sept. 24, 1809.)\r\n\r\n  [51] The not unnatural suggestion that the German and Italian\r\n  troops may have failed to display such desperate courage as the\r\n  native French in the assault seems to be refuted by their losses,\r\n  which were hardly smaller in proportion. Of 1,430 native French\r\n  of the 7th and 56th Line and 32nd Léger, 328 were put out of\r\n  action; of 1,400 Berg, Würzburg, and Italian troops, 296. The\r\n  difference in the percentage is so small that it is clear that\r\n  there was no great difference in conduct.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the repulse of September 19 on the besieging army was\r\nappalling. Verdier, after writing three venomous letters to the\r\nEmperor, the War Minister, and Marshal Augereau[52], in which he\r\naccused St. Cyr of having deliberately sacrificed the good of the\r\nservice to his personal resentments, declared himself invalided. He\r\nthen went off to Perpignan, though permission to depart was expressly\r\ndenied him by his superior: his divisional generals, Lecchi and\r\nMorio, had already preceded him to France. Disgust at the failure of\r\nthe storm had the same effect on the rank and file: 1,200 men went\r\nto the hospital in the fortnight that followed the assault, till by\r\nOctober 1 the three divisions of the siege-corps numbered little more\r\nthan 4,000 bayonets--just enough to hold Monjuich and the camps by\r\nthe great dépôts at Pont Mayor and Sarria. The store of ammunition in\r\nthe park had been used up for the tremendous bombardment poured upon\r\nthe breaches from the 15th to the 17th of September. A new supply was\r\nwanted from Perpignan, yet no troops could be detached to bring it\r\nforward, for the miqueletes were again active, and on September 13\r\nhad captured or destroyed near Bascara a convoy guarded by so many as\r\n500 men.\r\n\r\n  [52] See especially Verdier to Augereau, no. 53, and to the\r\n  Minister, no. 61, of Belmas’s Appendices.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr, left in sole charge of the siege by Verdier’s departure,\r\ncame to the conclusion that it was useless to proceed with the attack\r\nby means of trenches, batteries, and assaults, and frankly stated\r\nthat he should starve the town out, but waste no further lives on\r\nactive operations. He drew in the covering corps closer to Gerona, so\r\nthat it could take a practical part in the investment, put the wrecks\r\nof Lecchi’s troops--of whom less than 1,000 survived--into Pino’s\r\ndivision, and sent the French brigade of Verdier’s old division to\r\nguard the line between Bascara and the Frontier. Thus the distinction\r\nbetween the siege-corps and the covering troops ceased to exist, and\r\nSt. Cyr lay with some 16,000 men in a loose circle round Gerona,\r\nintent not on prosecuting advances against the walls, but only on\r\npreventing the introduction of further succours. He was aware that\r\nacute privations were already being suffered by the Spaniards:\r\nGarcia Conde’s convoy had brought in not much more than eight days’\r\nprovisions for the 5,000 men of the reinforced garrison and the\r\n10,000 inhabitants who still survived. There was a considerable\r\namount of flour still left in store, but little else: meat, salt\r\nand fresh, was all gone save horseflesh, for Alvarez had just begun\r\nto butcher his draught horses and those of his single squadron of\r\ncavalry. There was some small store of chocolate, tobacco, and\r\ncoffee, but wine and aguardiente had run out, so had salt, oil, rice,\r\nand--what was most serious with autumn and winter approaching--wood\r\nand charcoal. All the timbers of the houses destroyed by the\r\nbombardment had been promptly used up, either for fortification or\r\nfor cooking[53]. Medical stores were wholly unobtainable: the chief\r\nhospital had been burnt early in the siege, and the sick and wounded,\r\nlaid in vaults or casemates for safety, died off like flies in the\r\nunderground air. The seeds of pestilence were spread by the number\r\nof dead bodies of men and animals which were lying where they could\r\nnot be reached, under the ruins of fallen houses. The spirit alike of\r\ngarrison and troops still ran high: the repulse of the great assault\r\nof September 19, and the cessation of the bombardment for many days\r\nafter had encouraged them. But they were beginning to murmur more\r\nand more bitterly against Blake: there was a general, if erroneous,\r\nopinion that he ought to have risked a battle, instead of merely\r\nthrowing in provisions, on September 1. Alvarez himself shared this\r\nview, and wrote in vigorous terms to the Junta of Catalonia, to ask\r\nif his garrison was to perish slowly by famine.\r\n\r\n  [53] The very interesting list of the prices of commodities at\r\n  the commencement and the end of the siege, drawn up by Dr. Ruiz,\r\n  one of the Gerona diarists, may be found on p. 579 of Arteche’s\r\n  vol. vii. Note the following--the real (20 to the dollar) =\r\n  2½_d._ :--\r\n\r\n                                          _Reals._\r\n                                  _In June._  _In Sept._\r\n\r\n    Wheat flour, the qr.               80         112\r\n    Barleymeal, the qr.                30          56\r\n    Oatmeal, the qr.                   48          80\r\n    Coffee, the lb.                     8          24\r\n    Chocolate, the lb.                 16          64\r\n    Oil, the measure                    2½         24\r\n    Salt fish, the lb.                  2¼         32\r\n    Cheese, the lb.                     4          40\r\n    Wood, the arroba (32 lb.)           5          48\r\n    Charcoal, ditto                     3½         40\r\n    Tobacco, the lb.                   24         100\r\n    A fowl                             14         320\r\n    Rice, the lb.                       1½         32\r\n    Fresh fish from the Ter, the lb.    4          36\r\n\r\n  Thus while flour and meal had not doubled in value, coffee had\r\n  gone up threefold, chocolate and tobacco fourfold, cheese and\r\n  fuel tenfold, and the other commodities far more.\r\n\r\nBlake responded by a second effort, less happily planned than that of\r\nSeptember 1. He called together his scattered divisions, now about\r\n12,000 strong, and secretly concentrated them at La Bispal, between\r\nGerona and the sea. He had again got together some 1,200 mules\r\nladen with foodstuffs, and a large drove of sheep and oxen. Henry\r\nO’Donnell, an officer of the Ultonia regiment, who had been sent out\r\nby Alvarez, marched at the head of the convoy with 2,000 picked men;\r\na division of 4,000 men under General Wimpfen followed close behind\r\nto cover its rear. Blake, with the rest, remained at La Bispal: he\r\ncommitted the egregious fault of omitting to threaten other parts of\r\nthe line of investment, so as to draw off St. Cyr’s attention from\r\nthe crucial point. He trusted to secrecy and sudden action, having\r\nsucceeded in concentrating his army without being discovered by the\r\nFrench, who thought him still far away beyond Hostalrich. Thus it\r\ncame to pass that though O’Donnell struck sharply in, defeated an\r\nItalian regiment near Castellar, and another three miles further on,\r\nand reached the Constable fort with the head of the convoy, yet the\r\nrest of Pino’s division and part of Souham’s concentrated upon his\r\nflank and rear, because they were not drawn off by alarms in other\r\nquarters. They broke in between O’Donnell and his supports, captured\r\nall the convoy save 170 mules, and destroyed the leading regiment of\r\nWimpfen’s column, shooting also, according to the Spanish reports,\r\nmany scores of the unarmed peasants who were driving the beasts of\r\nburden[54]. About 700 of Wimpfen’s men were taken prisoners, about\r\n1,300 killed or wounded, for little quarter was given. The remnant\r\nrecoiled upon Blake, who fell back to Hostalrich next day, September\r\n27, without offering to fight. The amount of food which reached the\r\ngarrison was trifling, and Alvarez declared that he had no need for\r\nthe additional mouths of O’Donnell’s four battalions, and refused to\r\nadmit them into the city. They lay encamped under the Capuchin fort\r\nfor some days, waiting for an opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\n  [54] See Toreno, ii, and Arteche, vii. 412.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus wrecked Blake’s second attempt to succour Gerona,\r\nand driven him from the neighbourhood, St. Cyr betook himself to\r\nPerpignan, in order, as he explained to the Minister of War[55],\r\nto hurry up provisions to the army at the front, and to compel\r\nthe officers at the base to send forward some 3,000 or 4,000\r\nconvalescents fit to march, whose services had been persistently\r\ndenied him[56]. Arrived there he heard that Augereau, whose gout\r\nhad long disappeared, was perfectly fit to take the field, and\r\ncould have done so long before if he had not preferred to shift on\r\nto other shoulders the responsibility for the siege of Gerona. He\r\nwas, on October 1, at the baths of Molitg, ‘destroying the germs of\r\nhis malady’ as he gravely wrote to Paris,--amusing himself, as St.\r\nCyr maintains in his memoirs. Convinced that the siege had still a\r\nlong time to run, and eager to do an ill turn to the officer who had\r\nintrigued to get his place, St. Cyr played on the Marshal precisely\r\nthe same trick that Verdier had played on himself a fortnight before.\r\nHe announced that he was indisposed, wrote to congratulate Augereau\r\non his convalescence, and to resign the command to his hands, and\r\ndeparted to his home, without waiting for an answer, or obtaining\r\nleave from Paris--a daring act, as Napoleon was enraged, and might\r\nhave treated him hardly. He was indeed put under arrest for a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  [55] See St. Cyr to the Minister, Belmas, ii. Appendix no. 67.\r\n\r\n  [56] Augereau to the Minister, ibid., Oct. 8.\r\n\r\nFrom the first to the eleventh of October Souham remained in charge\r\nof the army, but on the twelfth Augereau appeared and took command,\r\nbringing with him the mass of convalescents who had been lingering\r\nat Perpignan. Among them was Verdier, whose health became all that\r\ncould be desired when St. Cyr had disappeared. The night following\r\nthe Marshal’s arrival was disturbed by an exciting incident. Henry\r\nO’Donnell from his refuge on the Capuchin heights, had been watching\r\nfor a fortnight for a good chance of escape. There was a dense fog\r\non the night of the 12th-13th: taking advantage of it O’Donnell\r\ncame down with his brigade, made a circuit round the town, crossed\r\nthe Oña and struck straight away into the plain of Salt, which,\r\nbeing the most open and exposed, was also the least guarded section\r\nof the French lines of investment. He broke through the chain of\r\nvedettes almost without firing, and came rushing before dawn into\r\nSouham’s head-quarters camp on the heights of Aguaviva. The battalion\r\nsleeping there was scattered, and the general forced to fly in his\r\nshirt. O’Donnell swept off his riding-horses and baggage, as also\r\nsome prisoners, and was out of reach in half an hour, before the\r\nrallying fractions of the French division came up to the rescue of\r\ntheir chief. By six o’clock the escaping column was in safety in the\r\nmountains by Santa Coloma, where it joined the miqueletes of Milans.\r\nFor this daring exploit O’Donnell was made a major-general by the\r\nSupreme Junta. His departure was a great relief to Alvarez, who had\r\nto husband every mouthful of food, and had already put both the\r\ngarrison and the townsfolk on half-rations of flour and horseflesh.\r\n\r\nAugereau was in every way inferior as an officer to St. Cyr. An old\r\nsoldier of fortune risen from the ranks, he had little education\r\nor military science; his one virtue was headlong courage on the\r\nbattlefield, yet when placed in supreme command he often hesitated,\r\nand showed hopeless indecision. He had been lucky enough to earn\r\na great reputation as Napoleon’s second-in-command in the old\r\ncampaigns of Italy in 1796-7. Since then he had made his fortune by\r\nbecoming one of the Emperor’s most zealous tools and flatterers.\r\nHe was reckoned a blind and reckless Bonapartist, ready to risk\r\nanything for his master, but spoilt his reputation for sincerity by\r\ndeserting him at the first opportunity in 1814. He was inclined to\r\na harsh interpretation of the laws of war, and enjoyed a doubtful\r\nreputation for financial integrity. Yet he was prone to ridiculous\r\nself-laudatory proclamations and manifestos, written in a bombastic\r\nstrain which he vainly imagined to resemble his master’s thunders of\r\nthe _Bulletins_. Scraps of his address to the citizens of Gerona may\r\nserve to display his fatuity--\r\n\r\n‘Unhappy inhabitants--wretched victims immolated to the caprice\r\nand madness of ambitious men greedy for your blood--return to your\r\nsenses, open your eyes, consider the ills which surround you! With\r\nwhat tranquillity do your leaders look upon the graves crammed with\r\nyour corpses! Are you not horror-struck at these cannibals, whose\r\nmirth bursts out in the midst of the human hecatomb, and who yet dare\r\nto lift their gory hands in prayer towards the throne of a God of\r\nPeace? They call themselves the apostles of Jesus Christ! Tremble,\r\ncruel and infamous men! The God who judges the actions of mortals is\r\nslow to condemn, but his vengeance is terrible.... I warn you for the\r\nlast time, inhabitants of Gerona, reflect while you still may! If you\r\nforce me to throw aside my usual mildness, your ruin is inevitable. I\r\nshall be the first to groan at it, but the laws of war impose on me\r\nthe dire necessity.... I am severe but just. Unhappy Gerona! if thy\r\ndefenders persist in their obstinacy, thou shalt perish in blood and\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) AUGEREAU.’\r\n\r\nStuff of this sort was not likely to have much effect on fanatics\r\nlike Alvarez and his ‘Crusaders.’ If it is so wrong to cause the\r\ndeaths of men--they had only to answer--Why has Bonaparte sent his\r\nlegions into Spain? On the Marshal’s line of argument, that it is\r\nwrong to resist overwhelming force, it is apparently a sin before God\r\nfor any man to attempt to defend his house and family against any\r\nbandit. There is much odious and hypocritical nonsense in some of\r\nNapoleon’s bulletins, where he grows tender on the miseries of the\r\npeople he has conquered, but nothing to approach the maunderings of\r\nhis copyist.\r\n\r\nAugereau found the army about Gerona showing not more than 12,000\r\nbayonets fit for the field--gunners and sappers excluded. The men\r\nwere sick of the siege, and it would seem that the Marshal was\r\nforced, after inspecting the regiments and conferring with the\r\ngenerals, to acquiesce in St. Cyr’s decision that any further\r\nassaults would probably lead to more repulses. He gave out that\r\nhe was resolved to change the system on which the operations had\r\nhitherto been conducted, but the change amounted to nothing more\r\nthan that he ordered a slow but steady bombardment to be kept up,\r\nand occasionally vexed the Spaniards by demonstrations against the\r\nmore exposed points of the wall. It does not appear that either of\r\nthese expedients had the least effect in shaking the morale of the\r\ngarrison. It is true that during October and November the hearts of\r\nthe Geronese were commencing to grow sick, but this was solely the\r\nresult of starvation and dwindling numbers. As to the bombardment,\r\nthey were now hardened to any amount of dropping fire: on October\r\n28 they celebrated the feast of San Narciso, their patron, by a\r\nprocession all round the town, which was under fire for the whole\r\ntime of its progress, and paid no attention to the casualties which\r\nit cost them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when the second half of October had begun, Blake made\r\nthe third and last of his attempts to throw succours into Gerona.\r\nIt was even more feebly carried out than that of September 26, for\r\nthe army employed was less numerous. Blake’s force had not received\r\nany reinforcement to make up for the men lost in the last affair,\r\na fact that seems surprising, since Valencia ought now to have\r\nbeen able to send him the remainder of the regiments which had\r\nbeen reorganized since the disasters of June. But it would seem\r\nthat José Caro, who was in command in that province, and the local\r\nJunta, made excuses for retaining as many men as possible, and cared\r\nlittle for the danger of Gerona, so long as the war was kept far\r\nfrom their own frontier. It was, at any rate, with no more than\r\n10,000 or 12,000 men, the remains of his original force, that Blake\r\nonce more came forward on October 18, and threatened the blockading\r\narmy by demonstrations both from the side of La Bispal and that of\r\nSanta Coloma. He had again collected a considerable amount of food\r\nat Hostalrich, but had not yet formed a convoy: apparently he was\r\nwaiting to discover the weakest point in the French lines before\r\nrisking his mules and his stores, both of which were by now very\r\nhard to procure. There followed a fortnight of confused skirmishing,\r\nwithout any battle, though Augereau tried with all his might to force\r\non a general engagement. One of his Italian brigades was roughly\r\nhandled near La Bispal on the twenty-first, and another repulsed near\r\nSanta Coloma on the twenty-sixth, but on each occasion, when the\r\nFrench reinforcements came up, Blake gave back and refused to fight.\r\nOn November 1 the whole of Souham’s division marched on Santa Coloma,\r\nand forced Loygorri and Henry O’Donnell to evacuate it and retire to\r\nthe mountains. Souham reported that he had inflicted a loss of 2,000\r\nmen on the Spaniards, at the cost of eleven killed and forty-three\r\nwounded on his own side! The real casualty list of the two Spanish\r\ndivisions seems to have been somewhat over 100 men[57].\r\n\r\n  [57] See Souham’s dispatch, striving to make the combat into\r\n  a very big business, in Belmas, ii, Appendix no. 72, and cf.\r\n  Arteche, vii. pp. 430-1.\r\n\r\nNothing decisive had taken place up to November 7, when Augereau\r\nconceived the idea that he might make an end of Blake’s fruitless but\r\nvexatious demonstrations, by dealing a sudden blow at his magazines\r\nin Hostalrich. If these were destroyed it would cost the Spaniards\r\nmuch time to collect another store of provisions for Gerona.\r\nAccordingly Pino marched with three brigades to storm the town,\r\nwhich was protected only by a dilapidated mediaeval wall unfurnished\r\nwith guns, though the castle which dominated it was a place of\r\nconsiderable strength, and proof against a _coup de main_. Only one\r\nof Blake’s divisions, that of Cuadrado, less than 2,000 strong,\r\nwas in this quarter, and Augereau found employment for the others\r\nby sending some of Souham’s troops against them. The expedition\r\nsucceeded: while Mazzuchelli’s brigade occupied the attention of\r\nCuadrado, the rest of the Italians stormed Hostalrich, which was\r\ndefended only by its own inhabitants and the small garrison of the\r\ncastle. The Spaniards were driven up into that stronghold after a\r\nlively fight, and all the magazines fell into Pino’s hands and were\r\nburnt. At a cost of only thirty-five killed and sixty-four wounded\r\nthe food, which Blake had collected with so much difficulty, was\r\ndestroyed[58]. Thereupon the Spanish general gave up the attempt to\r\nsuccour Gerona, and withdrew to the plain of Vich, to recommence\r\nthe Sisyphean task of getting together one more convoy. It was not\r\ndestined to be of any use to Alvarez and his gallant garrison, for\r\nby the time that it was collected the siege had arrived at its final\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n  [58] See Pino’s and Augereau’s dispatches in Belmas’s Appendices,\r\n  nos. 73 and 74.\r\n\r\nThe Geronese were now reaching the end of their strength: for the\r\nfirst time since the investment began in May some of the defenders\r\nbegan to show signs of slackening. The heavy rains of October and\r\nthe commencement of the cold season were reducing alike troops and\r\ninhabitants to a desperate condition. They had long used up all their\r\nfuel, and found the chill of winter intolerable in their cellars and\r\ncasemates. Alvarez, though reduced to a state of physical prostration\r\nby dysentery and fever, was still steadfast in heart. But there was\r\ndiscontent brewing among some of his subordinates: it is notable, as\r\nshowing the spirit of the time, that the malcontents were found among\r\nthe professional soldiers, not among the citizens. Early in November\r\nseveral officers were found holding secret conferences, and drawing\r\nup an address to the local Junta, setting forth the desperate state\r\nof the city and the necessity for deposing the governor, who was\r\nrepresented as incapacitated for command by reason of his illness: it\r\nwas apparently hinted that he was going mad, or was intermittently\r\ndelirious[59]. Some of the wild sayings attributed to Alvarez during\r\nthe later days of the siege might be quoted as a support for their\r\nrepresentations. To a captain who asked to what point he was expected\r\nto retire, if he were driven from his post, it is said that he\r\nanswered, ‘to the cemetery.’ To another officer, the first who dared\r\nto say that capitulation was inevitable because of the exhaustion\r\nof the magazines, he replied, ‘When the last food is gone we will\r\nstart eating the cowards, and we will begin with you.’ Though aware\r\nthat their conspiracies were known, the malcontents did not desist\r\nfrom their efforts, and Alvarez made preparations for seizing and\r\nshooting the chiefs. But on the night of November 19 eight of them,\r\nincluding three lieutenant-colonels[60], warned by a traitor of their\r\napproaching fate, fled to Augereau’s camp. Their arrival was the\r\nmost encouraging event for the French that had occurred since the\r\ncommencement of the siege. They spoke freely of the exhaustion of the\r\ngarrison, and said that Alvarez was mad and moribund.\r\n\r\n  [59] Alvarez’s letter to Blake of Nov. 3 printed in Arteche’s\r\n  Appendix, no. 18 of his vol. vii, gives this account of the first\r\n  discovery of plots.\r\n\r\n  [60] Of whom two, strangely enough, had been specially mentioned\r\n  for courage at the September assault.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently this information concerning the desperate state\r\nof the garrison which induced Augereau to recommence active siege\r\noperations. He ordered up ammunition from Perpignan to fill the\r\nempty magazines, and when it arrived began to batter a new breach in\r\nthe curtain of Santa Lucia. On December 2 Pino’s Italians stormed\r\nthe suburb of La Marina, outside the southern end of the town, a\r\nquarter hitherto unassailed, and made a lodgement therein, as if to\r\nopen a new point of attack. But this was only done to distract the\r\nenemy from the real design of the Marshal, which was nothing less\r\nthan to cut off the forts on the Capuchin heights from Gerona by\r\nseizing the redoubts, those of the ‘Chapter’ and the ‘City,’ which\r\ncovered the steep upward path from the walls to the group of works on\r\nthe hilltop. At midnight on December 6 the voltigeur and grenadier\r\ncompanies of Pino’s division climbed the rough southern face of the\r\nCapuchin heights, and surprised and escaladed the ‘Redoubt of the\r\nCity,’ putting the garrison to the sword. Next morning the batteries\r\nof the forts above and the city below opened a furious fire upon the\r\nlost redoubt, and Alvarez directed his last sally, sending out every\r\nman that he could collect to recover the work. This led to a long\r\nand bloody fight on the slopes, which ended most disastrously for\r\nthe garrison. Not only was the sortie repulsed, but in the confusion\r\nthe French carried the Calvary and Chapter redoubts, the other works\r\nwhich guarded the access from Gerona to the upper forts. On the\r\nafternoon of December 7 the communication with them was completely\r\ncut off, and as their garrisons possessed no separate magazines, and\r\nhad been wont to receive their daily dole from the city, it was clear\r\nthat they must be starved out. They had only food for forty-eight\r\nhours at the moment[61].\r\n\r\n  [61] Napier (ii. 249) says that the sortie was so far\r\n  successful that the Geronese opened the way for the garrison\r\n  of the Constable fort to escape into the city. But I can find\r\n  no authority for this in either the French or the Spanish\r\n  narratives, see especially Vacani.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the sally had drained away the governor’s last\r\nstrength: he took to his bed that evening, was in delirium next day,\r\nand on the morning of the ninth received the last sacraments of the\r\nChurch, the doctors having declared that his hours were numbered. His\r\nlast conscious act was to protest against any proposal to surrender,\r\nbefore he handed over the command to the senior officer present,\r\nGeneral Juliano Bolivar. Had Alvarez retained his senses, it is\r\ncertain that an attempt would have been made to hold the town, even\r\nwhen the starving garrisons of the forts should have surrendered.\r\nBut the moment that his stern hand was removed, his successor,\r\nBolivar, called together a council of war, to which the members of\r\nthe Junta, no less than the officers commanding corps, were invited.\r\nThey voted that further resistance was impossible, and sent out\r\nBrigadier-General Fournas, the man who had so well defended Monjuich,\r\nto obtain terms from Augereau. On the morning of the tenth the\r\nMarshal received him, and dictated a simple surrender, without any of\r\nthe favourable conditions which Fournas at first demanded. His only\r\nconcession was that he offered to exchange the garrison for an equal\r\nnumber of the unhappy prisoners from Dupont’s army, now lying in\r\nmisery on the pontoons at Cadiz, if the Supreme Junta concurred. But\r\nthe bargain was never ratified, as the authorities at Seville were\r\nobdurate.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 11 the survivors of the garrison marched\r\nout, and laid down their arms on the glacis of the Mercadal. Only\r\n3,000 men came forth; these looked like living spectres, so pale,\r\nweak, and tattered that ‘the besiegers,’ as eye-witnesses observed,\r\n‘felt ashamed to have been held at bay so long by dying men.’ There\r\nwere 1,200 more lying in the hospitals. The rest of the 9,000 who\r\nhad defended the place from May, or had entered with Garcia Conde in\r\nSeptember, were dead. A detailed inspection of figures shows that\r\nof the 5,723 men of Alvarez’s original command only 2,008 survived,\r\nwhile of the 3,648 who had come later there were still 2,240 left: i.\r\ne. two-thirds of the old garrison and one-third of the succours had\r\nperished. The mortality by famine and disease far exceeded that by\r\nthe sword: 800 men had died in the hospitals in October, and 1,300\r\nin November, from mere exhaustion. The town was in a dreadful state:\r\nabout 6,000 of the 14,000 inhabitants had perished, including nearly\r\nall the very young and the very old. 12,000 bombs and 8,000 shells\r\nhad been thrown into the unhappy city: it presented a melancholy\r\nvista of houses roofless, or with one or two of the side-walls\r\nknocked in, of streets blocked by the fallen masonry of churches or\r\ntowers, under which half-decayed corpses were partially buried. The\r\nopen spaces were strewn with broken muskets, bloody rags, wheels of\r\ndisabled guns and carts, fragments of shells, and the bones of horses\r\nand mules whose flesh had been eaten. The stench was so dreadful that\r\nAugereau had to keep his troops out of the place, lest infection\r\nshould be bred among them. In the magazines nothing was found save a\r\nlittle unground corn; all the other provisions had been exhausted.\r\nThere were also 168 cannon, mostly disabled; about 10,000 lb. of\r\npowder, and a million musket cartridges. The military chest handed\r\nover contained 562 reals--about 6_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nAugereau behaved very harshly to the garrison: many feeble or\r\ndiseased men were made to march to Perpignan and perished by the\r\nway. The priests and monks of the ‘Crusade’ were informed that they\r\nwere combatants, and sent off with the soldiery. But the fate of the\r\ngallant Governor provokes especial indignation. Alvarez did not die\r\nof his fever: when he was somewhat recovered he was forwarded to\r\nPerpignan, and from thence to Narbonne, where he was kept for some\r\ntime and seemed convalescent. Orders then came from Paris that he\r\nwas to be sent back to Spain--apparently to be tried as a traitor,\r\nfor it was alleged that in the spring of 1808 he had accepted the\r\nprovisional government installed by Murat. He was separated from his\r\naide-de-camp and servants, and passed on from dungeon to dungeon\r\ntill he reached Figueras. The day after his arrival at that place he\r\nwas found dead, on a barrow--the only bed granted him--in the dirty\r\ncellar where he had been placed. It is probable that he perished\r\nfrom natural causes, but many Spaniards believed that he had been\r\nmurdered[62].\r\n\r\n  [62] For details of this disgraceful cruelty, see Arteche’s\r\n  ‘Elogio’ on Alvarez in the proceedings of the Madrid Academy.\r\n  The Emperor Napoleon himself must bear the responsibility, as\r\n  it was by orders from Paris that Alvarez was sent back from\r\n  France to Figueras. Apparently he was to be tried at Barcelona,\r\n  and perhaps executed. There is no allusion to the matter in the\r\n  _Correspondance de Napoléon_.\r\n\r\nGreat as the losses of the garrison of Gerona had been, they were\r\nfar exceeded, both positively and proportionately, by those of the\r\nbesieging army. The French official returns show that on June 15 the\r\nthree divisions charged with the attack, those of Verdier, Morio, and\r\nLecchi, had 14,456 bayonets, and the two divisions of the covering\r\narmy, those of Souham and Pino, 15,732: there were 2,637 artillerymen\r\nand engineers over and above these figures. On December 31, twenty\r\ndays after the surrender, and when the regiments had been joined by\r\nmost of their convalescents, the three siege-divisions counted 6,343\r\nmen, the covering divisions 11,666, and the artillery and engineers,\r\n2,390.\r\n\r\nThis shows a loss of over 13,000 men; but on examination the deficit\r\nis seen to be even larger, for two new battalions from France had\r\njust joined Verdier’s division in December, and their 1,000 bayonets\r\nshould be deducted from his total. It would seem, then, that the\r\ncapture of Gerona cost the 7th Corps about 14,000 men, as well as\r\na whole campaigning season, from April to December. The attack on\r\nCatalonia had been brought to a complete standstill, and when Gerona\r\nfell the French occupied nothing but the ruined city, the fortresses\r\nof Rosas and Figueras hard by the frontier, and the isolated\r\nBarcelona, where Duhesme, with the 6,000 men of his division, had\r\nbeen lying quiescent all the summer and autumn. Such a force was too\r\nweak to make detachments to aid St. Cyr or Augereau, since 4,000 men\r\nat least were needed for the garrison of the citadel and the outlying\r\nforts, and it would have been hopeless for the small remainder to\r\ntake the field. Duhesme only conducted one short incursion to\r\nVillafranca during the siege of Gerona. In the last months of the\r\nyear Barcelona was again in a state of partial starvation: the food\r\nbrought in by Cosmao’s convoy in the spring had been exhausted, while\r\na second provision-fleet from Toulon, escorted by five men-of-war,\r\nhad been completely destroyed in October. Admiral Martin surprised it\r\noff Cape Creus, drove ashore and burnt two line-of-battle ships and\r\na frigate, and captured most of the convoy. The rest took refuge in\r\nthe harbour of Rosas, where Captain Halliwell attacked them with the\r\nboats of the squadron and burnt them all[63].\r\n\r\n  [63] For details, see James’s _Naval History_, v. pp. 142-5.\r\n\r\nWhile Gerona was enduring its last month of starvation, those whose\r\ncare it should have been to succour the place at all costs were\r\nindulging in a fruitless exchange of recriminations, and making\r\npreparations when it was all too late. Blake, after retiring to Vich\r\non November 10, informed the Junta of Catalonia that he was helpless,\r\nunless more men could be found, and that they must find them. Why\r\nhe did not rather insist that the Valencian reserves should be\r\nbrought up, and risk stripping Tarragona and Lerida of their regular\r\ngarrisons, it is hard to say. This at any rate would have been in his\r\npower. The Catalan Junta replied by summoning a congress at Manresa\r\non November 20, to which representatives of every district of the\r\nprincipality were invited. The congress voted that a levy _en masse_\r\nof all the able-bodied men from seventeen to forty-five years of age\r\nshould be called out[64], and authorized a loan of 10,000,000 reals\r\nfor equipping them. They also wrote to Seville, not for the first\r\ntime, to demand reinforcements from the Central Junta. But the battle\r\nof Ocaña had just been fought and lost, and Andalusia could not\r\nhave spared a man, even if there had been time to transport troops\r\nto Tarragona. All that the Catalans received was honorary votes of\r\napproval for the gallant behaviour of the Geronese. The levy _en\r\nmasse_ was actually begun, but there was an insuperable difficulty\r\nin collecting and equipping the men in winter time, when days were\r\nshort and roads were bad. The weeks passed by, and Gerona fell long\r\nbefore enough men had been got together to induce Blake to try a\r\nnew offensive movement. Why was the congress not called in September\r\nrather than in November? Blake had always declared that he was too\r\nweak to risk a battle with the French for the raising of the siege,\r\nbut till the last moment the Catalans contented themselves with\r\narguing with him, and writing remonstrances to the Central Junta,\r\ninstead of lending him the aid of their last levies.\r\n\r\n  [64] The Proclamation of Nov. 29 ordering this levy, written in a\r\n  very magniloquent style, may be found in Belmas, Appendix no. 81.\r\n\r\nOne or two points connected with this famous siege require a word\r\nof comment. It is quite clear that St. Cyr during its early stages\r\ndid not try his honest best to help Verdier. During June and July\r\nhis covering army was doing no good whatever at Vich: he pretended\r\nthat he had placed it there in order to ward off possible attacks\r\nby Blake. But it was matter of public knowledge that Blake was far\r\naway in Aragon, engaged in his unhappy campaign against Suchet, and\r\nthat Coupigny, left at Tarragona with a few thousand men, was not a\r\nserious danger. St. Cyr could have spared a whole division more for\r\nthe siege operations, without risking anything. If he had done so,\r\nGerona could have been approached on two sides instead of one, the\r\nMercadal front might have been attacked, and the loose blockade,\r\nwhich was all that Verdier could keep up, for want of more men, might\r\nhave been made effective. But St. Cyr all through his military career\r\nearned a reputation for callous selfishness and habitual leaving\r\nof his colleagues in the lurch. On this occasion he was bitterly\r\noffended with Verdier, for giving himself the airs of an equal, and\r\ncorresponding directly with the Emperor. There can be no doubt that\r\nhe took a malicious pleasure in seeing his failures. It is hardly\r\ndisguised in his clever and plausible _Journal des Opérations de\r\nl’Armée de Catalogne en 1808-1809_[65].\r\n\r\n  [65] Napoleon’s comments on the operations of his generals\r\n  are always interesting, though sometimes founded on imperfect\r\n  information, or vitiated by predispositions. Of St. Cyr’s\r\n  campaign he writes [Disp. no. 16,004] to Clarke, his Minister of\r\n  War:\r\n\r\n  ‘Il faut me faire un rapport sérieux sur la campagne du général\r\n  Gouvion Saint-Cyr en Catalogne: (1) Sur les raisons qui l’ont\r\n  porté à évacuer cette province, lorsque Saragosse était prise\r\n  et sa jonction faite avec le maréchal Mortier. (2) Sur ce qu’il\r\n  s’est laissé attaquer par les Espagnols, et ne les a jamais\r\n  attaqués, et sur ce que, après les avoir toujours battus par la\r\n  valeur des troupes, il n’a jamais profité de la victoire. (3) Sur\r\n  ce qu’il a, par cet esprit d’égoisme qui lui est particulier,\r\n  compromis le siège de Gérone: sur ce qu’il n’a jamais secouru\r\n  suffisamment l’armée assiégeante, l’a au contraire attirée à\r\n  lui, et a laissé ravitailler la ville. (4) Sur ce qu’il a quitté\r\n  l’armée sans permission, sous le vain prétexte de maladie.’\r\n\r\n  The first point seems unjust to St. Cyr. From his position\r\n  in front of Tarragona, after Valls, he had no real chance of\r\n  combining his operations with the army of Aragon. But the other\r\n  three charges seem well founded.\r\n\r\nVerdier, on the other hand, seems to have felt all through that he\r\nwas being asked to perform a task almost impossible, when he was\r\nset to take Gerona with his own 14,000 men, unaided by the covering\r\narmy. His only receipt for success was to try to hurry on the matter\r\nby delivering desperate blows. Both the assault on Monjuich on July\r\n8 and that on the city on September 19 were premature; there was\r\nsome excuse for the former: Verdier had not yet realized how well\r\nAlvarez could fight. But the second seems unpardonable, after the\r\nwarning received at Monjuich. If the general, as he declared before\r\ndelivering his assault, mistrusted his own troops, he had no right\r\nto order a storm at all, considering his experience of the way in\r\nwhich the Spaniards had behaved in July. He acted on the fallacious\r\ntheory that a practicable breach implies a town that can be taken,\r\nwhich is far from being the case if the garrison are both desperate\r\nand ingenious in defending themselves. The only way to deal with\r\nsuch a resolute and capable adversary was to proceed by the slow and\r\nregular methods of siegecraft, to sap right up to the ditch before\r\ndelivering an assault, and batter everything to pieces before risking\r\na man. This was how Monjuich was actually taken, after the storm had\r\nfailed. Having neither established himself close under the walls, nor\r\nsubdued the flanking fires from the Calvary and Chapter redoubts, nor\r\nascertained how far the Spaniards had prepared inner defences for\r\nthemselves, he had no right to attack at all.\r\n\r\nAs to Blake, even after making all possible allowances for the\r\nfact that he could not trust his troops--the half-rallied wrecks\r\nof Maria and Belchite--for a battle in the field, he must yet be\r\npronounced guilty of feebleness and want of ingenuity. If he could\r\nnever bring up enough regulars to give him a chance of facing St.\r\nCyr, the fault was largely his own: a more forcible general would\r\nhave insisted that the Valencian reserves should march[66], and would\r\nhave stripped Lerida and Tarragona of men: it could safely have\r\nbeen done, for neither Suchet nor Duhesme was showing any signs of\r\nthreatening those points. He might have insisted that the Catalan\r\nJunta should call out the full levy of _somatenes_ in September\r\ninstead of in November. He might also have made a better use of\r\nthe irregulars already in the field, the bands of Rovira, Milans,\r\nand Claros. These miqueletes did admirable service all through the\r\nsiege, by harassing Verdier’s rear and cutting off his convoys, but\r\nthey were not employed (as they should have been) in combination\r\nwith the regulars, but allowed, as a rule, to go off on excursions\r\nof their own, which had no relation to the main objects of Blake’s\r\nstrategy. The only occasion on which proper use was made of them was\r\nwhen, on September 1, they were set to threaten Verdier’s lines,\r\nwhile Garcia Conde’s convoy was approaching Gerona. It may be pleaded\r\nin the Spanish general’s defence that it was difficult to exact\r\nobedience from the chiefs: there was a distinct coolness between the\r\nregulars and the irregulars, which sometimes led to actual quarrels\r\nand conflicts when they met. But here again the reply is that more\r\nforcible captain-generals were able to control the miqueletes, and if\r\nBlake failed to do so, it was only one more sign of his inadequacy.\r\nIt is impossible to avoid the conclusion that he mismanaged matters,\r\nand that if in his second and third attempts to relieve Gerona he had\r\nrepeated the tactics of his first, he would have had a far better\r\nchance of success. On September 1 only did he make any scientific\r\nattempt to distract the enemy’s attention and forces, and on that\r\noccasion he was successful. Summing things up, it may be said that he\r\nwas not wrong to refuse battle with the troops that he had actually\r\nbrought up to Gerona: they would undoubtedly have been routed if he\r\nhad risked a general engagement. His fault was that he did not bring\r\nup larger forces, when it was in his power to do so, by the exercise\r\nof compulsion on the Catalan and Valencian Juntas. But these bodies\r\nmust share Blake’s responsibilities: they undoubtedly behaved in\r\na slack and selfish fashion, and let Gerona perish, though it was\r\nkeeping the war from their doors for a long eight months.\r\n\r\n  [66] The Valencian troops at Maria were eleven battalions, viz.\r\n  Savoia (three), 1st and 3rd Cazadores de Valencia (two), America\r\n  (two), Voluntarios de Valencia (one), 1st of Valencia (three).\r\n  Of these only Savoia (now two batts. only) and Voluntarios\r\n  de Valencia turned up for the relief of Gerona. Along with\r\n  them came two fresh regiments, 2nd Cazadores of Orihuela, and\r\n  Almanza, which had not been at Maria. But these were Murcian, not\r\n  Valencian, troops.\r\n\r\nAll the more credit is due to Alvarez, considering the way in which\r\nhe was left unsuccoured, and fed with vain promises. A less constant\r\nsoul would have abandoned the defence long before: the last two\r\nmonths of resistance were his sole work: if he had fallen sick in\r\nOctober instead of December, his subordinates would have yielded\r\nlong before. But it is not merely for heroic obstinacy that he must\r\nbe praised. Every detail of the defence shows that he was a most\r\ningenious and provident general: nothing was left undone to make the\r\nwork of the besiegers hard. Moreover, as Napier has observed, it\r\nis not the least of his titles to merit that he preserved a strict\r\ndiscipline, and exacted the possible maximum of work from soldier\r\nand civilian alike, without the use of any of those wholesale\r\nexecutions which disgraced the defence of Saragossa. His words were\r\nsometimes truculent, but his acts were just and moderate. He never\r\ncountenanced mob-law, as did Palafox, yet he was far better obeyed by\r\nthe citizens, and got as good service from them as did the Aragonese\r\ncommander. He showed that good organization is not incompatible with\r\npatriotic enthusiasm, and is far more effective in the hour of danger\r\nthan reckless courage and blind self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE AUTUMN CAMPAIGN OF 1809: TAMAMES, OCAÑA, AND ALBA DE TORMES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as August 30, when Wellington had not fully completed his\r\nretreat from Almaraz and Jaraicejo to Badajoz and Merida, the central\r\nJunta had already begun to pester him and his brother, the Ambassador\r\nat Seville, with plans for a resumption of the offensive in the\r\nvalley of the Tagus. On that day Martin de Garay, the Secretary of\r\nState, wrote to represent to Wellesley that he had good reason to\r\nbelieve that the troops of Victor, Mortier, and Soult were making\r\na general movement to the rear, and that the moment had arrived\r\nwhen the allied armies in Estremadura and La Mancha should ‘move\r\nforward with the greatest activity, either to observe more closely\r\nthe movements of the enemy, or to attack him when circumstances may\r\nrender it expedient[67].’ The French movement of retreat was wholly\r\nimaginary, and it is astonishing that the Spanish Government should\r\nhave been so mad as to believe it possible that ‘their retrograde\r\nmovement may have originated in accounts received from the North,\r\nwhich compel the enemy either to retire into the interior of France,\r\nor to take up a position nearer to the Pyrenees.’ On a groundless\r\nrumour, of the highest intrinsic improbability, they were ready to\r\nhurl the newly-rallied troops of Eguia and Venegas upon the French,\r\nand to invite Wellington to join in the advance. Irresponsible\r\nfrivolity could go no further. But the Junta, as has been already\r\nsaid, were eager for a military success, which should cause their\r\nunpopularity to be forgotten, and were ready to seize on any excuse\r\nfor ordering their troops forward. This particular rumour died\r\naway--the French were still in force on the Tagus, and, as a matter\r\nof fact, the only movement northwards on their part had been the\r\nreturn of Ney’s corps to Salamanca. But though the truth was soon\r\ndiscovered, the Junta only began to look out for new excuses for\r\nrecommencing active operations.\r\n\r\n  [67] De Garay to Wellesley in _Wellesley Dispatches_, p. 92.\r\n\r\nWellington, when these schemes were laid before him, reiterated\r\nhis refusal to join in any offensive campaign, pointed out that\r\nthe allied forces were not strong enough to embark on any such\r\nhazardous undertaking, and bluntly expressed his opinion that ‘he\r\nwas much afraid, from what he had seen of the proceedings of the\r\nCentral Junta, that in the distribution of their forces they do\r\nnot consider military defence and military operations so much as\r\npolitical intrigue, and the attainment of petty political objects.’\r\nHe then proceeded to make an estimate of the French armies, to show\r\ntheir numerical superiority to the allies; in this he very much\r\nunder-estimated the enemy’s resources, calculating the whole force\r\nof the eight corps in Spain at 125,000 men, exclusive of sick and\r\ngarrisons not available for active service. As a matter of fact there\r\nwere 180,000 men, not 125,000, with the Eagles at that moment, after\r\nall deductions had been made, so that his reasoning was far more\r\ncogent than he supposed[68]. But this only makes more culpable the\r\nobstinate determination of the Junta to resume operations with the\r\nmuch inferior force which they had at their disposal.\r\n\r\n  [68] Wellington to Wellesley, from Merida, Sept. 1, 1809.\r\n\r\nUndismayed by their first repulse, the Spanish ministers were soon\r\nmaking new representations to Wellesley and Wellington, in order to\r\ninduce them to commit the English army to a forward policy. They sent\r\nin repeated schemes for supplying Wellington with food and transport\r\non a lavish scale[69]; but he merely expressed his doubts as to\r\nwhether orders that looked admirable on paper would ever be carried\r\nout in practice. He consented for the present to remain at Badajoz,\r\nas long as he could subsist his army in its environs, but warned\r\nthe Junta that it was more probable that he would retire within the\r\nPortuguese border, for reasons of supply, than that he would join in\r\nanother campaign on the Tagus.\r\n\r\n  [69] See the details in Wellesley to Canning, Sept. 2, 1809.\r\n\r\nDespite of all, the government at Seville went on with its plans for\r\na general advance, even after they recognized that Wellington was\r\nnot to be moved. A grand plan of operations was gradually devised\r\nby the War-Minister Cornel and his advisers. Stated shortly it was\r\nas follows. The army in La Mancha, which Venegas had rallied after\r\nthe disaster of Almonacid, was to be raised to a strength of over\r\n50,000 men by the drafting into it of a full two-thirds of Cuesta’s\r\nold army of Estremadura. On September 21 Eguia marched eastwards up\r\nthe Guadiana, with three divisions of infantry and twelve or thirteen\r\nregiments of cavalry, to join Venegas[70]. The remaining force,\r\namounting to two divisions of infantry and 2,500 cavalry, was left\r\nin Estremadura under the Duke of Albuquerque, the officer to whom\r\nthe government was obliged to assign this army, because the Junta of\r\nBadajoz pressed for his appointment and would not hear of any other\r\ncommander. He was considered an Anglophil, and a friend of some of\r\nthe Andalusian malcontents, so the force left with him was cut down\r\nto the minimum. All the old regular regiments were withdrawn from\r\nhim, save one single battalion, and he was left with nothing save\r\nthe newly-raised volunteer units, some of which had behaved so badly\r\nat Talavera[71]. His cavalry was soon after reduced by the order to\r\nsend a brigade to join the Army of the North, so that he was finally\r\nleft with only five regiments of that arm or about 1,500 sabres. Of\r\nhis infantry, about 12,000 strong, over 4,000 were absorbed by the\r\ngarrison of Badajoz, so that he had only 8,000 men available for\r\nservice in the field.\r\n\r\n  [70] His head quarters moved from Truxillo on the seventeenth,\r\n  were at La Serena on the twenty-first, and joined the army of La\r\n  Mancha about October 1.\r\n\r\n  [71] See the list of Albuquerque’s army in Appendix no. 2. There\r\n  had been twenty-one regular battalions in Cuesta’s army in June.\r\n  Twenty of these marched off with Eguia, leaving only one (4th\r\n  Walloon Guards) with Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nEguia, on the other hand, carried with him to La Mancha some 25,000\r\nmen, the picked corps of the Estremaduran army; and, as the remains\r\nof Venegas’s divisions rallied and recruited after Almonacid,\r\namounted to rather more than that number, the united force exceeded\r\n50,000 sabres and bayonets. With this army the Junta intended to\r\nmake a direct stroke at Madrid, while Albuquerque was directed to\r\nshow himself on the Tagus, in front of Almaraz and Talavera, with\r\nthe object of detaining at least one of the French corps in that\r\ndirection. It was hoped, even yet, that Wellington might be induced\r\nto join in this demonstration. If once the redcoats reappeared at the\r\nfront, neither Soult nor Mortier could be moved to oppose the army of\r\nLa Mancha. Meanwhile Ney and the French corps in Leon and Old Castile\r\nwere to be distracted by the use of a new force from the north,\r\nwhose composition must be explained. The Junta held that the last\r\ncampaign had failed only because the allies had possessed no force\r\nready to detain Soult and Ney. If they had not appeared at Plasencia,\r\nWellington, Cuesta, and Venegas would have been able to drive King\r\nJoseph out of his capital. Two months later the whole position was\r\nchanged, in their estimation, by the fact that Spain once more\r\npossessed a large ‘Army of the Left,’ which would be able to occupy\r\nat least two French corps, while the rest of the allies marched again\r\non Madrid. That such a force existed did indeed modify the aspect of\r\naffairs. La Romana had been moved to Seville to become a member of\r\nthe Junta, but his successor, the Duke Del Parque, was collecting a\r\nhost very formidable as far as numbers went. The old army of Galicia\r\nhad been reformed into four divisions under Martin de la Carrera,\r\nLosada, Mahy, and the Conde de Belveder--the general whose name was\r\nso unfortunately connected with the ill-fought combat of Gamonal.\r\nThese four divisions now comprised 27,000 men, of whom more than half\r\nwere newly-raised Galician recruits, whom La Romana had embodied in\r\nthe depleted cadres of his original battalions, after Ney and Soult\r\nhad evacuated the province in July. A few of the ancient regiments\r\nthat had made the campaign of Espinosa had died out completely--their\r\nsmall remnants having been drafted into other corps[72]. On the other\r\nhand there were a few new regiments of Galician volunteers--but La\r\nRomana had set his face against the creation of such units, wisely\r\npreferring to place his new levies in the ranks of the old battalions\r\nof the regular army[73]. In the main, therefore, the new ‘Army of\r\nthe Left’ represented, as far as names and cadres went, Blake’s\r\noriginal ‘Army of Galicia[74].’ It had the same cardinal fault as\r\nthat army, in that it had practically no cavalry whatever: the single\r\ndragoon regiment that Blake had owned (La Reina) having been almost\r\ncompletely destroyed in 1808[75]. Each division had a battery; the\r\nguns, of which La Romana’s army had been almost destitute in the\r\nspring, had been supplied from England, and landed at Corunna during\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\n  [72] The only regiments of Blake’s original army that seem to be\r\n  completely dead in October 1809 are 2nd of Catalonia, Naples,\r\n  Pontevedra, Compostella. Naples had been drafted into Rey early\r\n  in 1809. Of the others I can find no details.\r\n\r\n  [73] The new Galician regiments which appear in the autumn of\r\n  1809 are Monforte de Lemos, Voluntarios de la Muerte, La Union,\r\n  Lovera, Maceda, Morazzo.\r\n\r\n  [74] For the full muster-roll of Del Parque’s army in October,\r\n  see Appendix no. 4.\r\n\r\n  [75] Some small fraction of it reappeared in the campaign of 1809.\r\n\r\nBut the Galician divisions, though the most numerous, were not\r\nthe only units which were told off to the new ‘Army of the Left.’\r\nAsturias had been free of invaders since Ney and Bonnet retired from\r\nits borders in June 1809. The Central Junta ordered Ballasteros to\r\njoin the main army with the few regular troops in the principality,\r\nand ten battalions of the local volunteers, a force of over 9,000\r\nmen. The Asturian Junta, always very selfish and particularist in\r\nits aims, made some protests but obeyed. Nine of its less efficient\r\nregiments were left behind to watch Bonnet.\r\n\r\nFinally the Duke Del Parque himself had been collecting fresh levies\r\nabout Ciudad Rodrigo, while the plains of Leon lay abandoned by\r\nthe French during the absence of Ney’s corps in the valley of the\r\nTagus. Including the garrison of Rodrigo he had 9,000 men, all in new\r\nunits save one old line battalion and one old militia regiment[76].\r\nDeducting the 3,500 men which held the fortress, there were seven\r\nbattalions--nearly 6,000 bayonets--and a squadron or two of horse\r\navailable for the strengthening of the field army. These were now\r\ntold off as the ‘5th Division of the Army of the Left’; that of\r\nBallasteros was numbered the 3rd Division.\r\n\r\n  [76] One battalion of Majorca, and the Militia battalion of\r\n  Segovia.\r\n\r\nThe Galician, Asturian, and Leonese divisions had between them less\r\nthan 500 horsemen. To make up for this destitution the Central Junta\r\ndirected the Duke of Albuquerque to send off to Ciudad Rodrigo, via\r\nthe Portuguese frontier, a brigade of his cavalry. Accordingly\r\nthe Prince of Anglona marched north with three regiments[77], only\r\n1,000 sabres in all, and joined Del Parque on September 25. Thus at\r\nthe end of that month the ‘Army of the Left’ numbered nearly 50,000\r\nmen--all infantry save 1,500 horse and 1,200 gunners. But they were\r\nscattered all over North-Western Spain, from Oviedo to Astorga, and\r\nfrom Astorga to Ciudad Rodrigo, and had to be concentrated before\r\nthey could act. Nor was the concentration devoid of danger, for the\r\nFrench might fall upon the Asturians or the Leonese before they had\r\njoined the Galician main body. As a matter of fact the 50,000 never\r\ntook the field in one mass, for Del Parque left a division under\r\nMahy to protect Galicia, and, when these regiments and the garrison\r\nof Rodrigo were deducted, he had but 40,000 in all, including sick\r\nand men on detachment. This, nevertheless, constituted a formidable\r\nforce--if it had been in existence in July, Soult and Ney could never\r\nhave marched against Wellington with their whole strength, and the\r\nTalavera campaign might have had another end. But the troops were\r\nof varying quality--the Leonese division was absolutely raw: the\r\nGalicians had far too many recruits with only two months’ training in\r\ntheir ranks, the Estremaduran cavalry had a bad record of disasters.\r\nA general of genius might have accomplished something with the Army\r\nof the Left--but Del Parque, though more cautious than many of his\r\ncompeers, was no genius.\r\n\r\n  [77] Borbon, Sagunto, and Granaderos de Llerena, 1,053 sabres in\r\n  October. These regiments had newly rejoined the Estremaduran army\r\n  from the rear.\r\n\r\nThe Junta had a deeply-rooted notion that if sufficient pressure were\r\napplied to Wellesley and Wellington, they would permit Beresford’s\r\nPortuguese army, now some 20,000 strong, to join Del Parque for\r\nthe advance into the plains of Leon. They had mistaken their men:\r\nWellington returned as peremptory a refusal to their request for the\r\naid of the Portuguese troops as to their demand that his own British\r\narmy should advance with Albuquerque to the Tagus[78].\r\n\r\n  [78] See Wellington to Wellesley, from Badajoz, Oct. 30, 1809.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more hazardous than the plan finally formulated\r\nat the Seville War Office for the simultaneous advance of the\r\narmies of La Mancha, the North, and Estremadura. Even if it had\r\nbeen energetically supported by Wellington and Beresford, it\r\nwould have been rash: converging operations by several armies\r\nstarting from distant bases against an enemy concentrated in their\r\nmidst are proverbially disastrous. In this particular plan three\r\nforces--numbering in all about 110,000 men, and starting from\r\npoints so far apart as Ciudad Rodrigo, Truxillo, and the Passes\r\nby La Carolina, were to fall upon some 120,000 men, placed in a\r\ncomparatively compact body in their centre. A single mistake in the\r\ntiming of operations, the chance that one Spanish army might outmarch\r\nanother, or that one of the three might fail to detain any hostile\r\nforce in its front (as had happened with Venegas during the Talavera\r\nCampaign) was bound to be ruinous. The French had it in their power\r\nto deal with their enemies in detail, if the least mischance should\r\noccur: and with Spanish generals and Spanish armies it was almost\r\ncertain that some error would be made.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Junta made their last preparation for the grand stroke,\r\nby deposing Venegas from the command of the united army in La Mancha.\r\nEguia held the interim command for a few days, but was to be replaced\r\nby Areizaga, an elderly general who had never commanded more than\r\na single division, and had to his credit only courage shown in a\r\nsubordinate position at the battle of Alcañiz. He was summoned from\r\nLerida, and came hastily to take up his charge.\r\n\r\nThe sole advantage which the Spaniards possessed in October 1809\r\nwas that their enemy did not expect to be attacked. A month after\r\nTalavera matters had apparently settled down for the whole autumn, as\r\nfar as the French generals could calculate. With the knowledge that\r\nthe Austrian War was over, and that unlimited reinforcements could\r\nnow be poured into Spain by his brother, King Joseph was content to\r\nwait. He had refused to allow Soult to make his favourite move of\r\ninvading Portugal in the end of August, because he wished the Emperor\r\nto take up the responsibility of settling the next plan of campaign,\r\nand of determining the number of new troops that would be required to\r\ncarry it out. The French corps, therefore, were in a semicircle round\r\nMadrid: Soult and Mortier in the central Tagus Valley at Plasencia\r\nand Talavera, Victor in La Mancha, with Sebastiani supporting him at\r\nToledo and Aranjuez, Ney at Salamanca, Dessolles and the Royal Guard\r\nas a central reserve in the capital. This was a purely defensive\r\nposition, and Joseph intended to retain it, till the masses of troops\r\nfrom Germany, with the Emperor himself perchance at their head,\r\nshould come up to his aid. It does not seem to have entered into his\r\nhead that the enemy would again take the offensive, after the fiasco\r\nof the Talavera campaign, and the bloody lesson of Almonacid.\r\n\r\nIn September and the early days of October the French hardly moved\r\nat all. Ney left his corps at Salamanca, and went on a short leave\r\nto Paris on September 25, so little was any danger expected in the\r\nplains of Leon. The charge of the 6th corps was handed over to\r\nMarchand, his senior divisional general. There was an even more\r\nimportant change of command pending--Jourdan had been soliciting\r\npermission to return to France ever since July. He had been on\r\nexcellent terms with King Joseph, but found it hard to exact\r\nobedience from the marshals--indeed he was generally engaged in a\r\ncontroversy either with Victor or with Soult. The Emperor was not\r\ninclined to allow him to quit Spain, but Jourdan kept sending in\r\napplications to be superseded, backed by medical certificates as\r\nto his dangerous state of health. Finally he was granted leave to\r\nreturn, by a letter which reached him on October 25, just as the new\r\ncampaign was beginning to develop into an acute phase. But he gladly\r\nhanded over his duties to Soult, who thus became ‘major-general’ or\r\nchief of the Staff to King Joseph, and departed without lingering or\r\nreluctance for France, glad to be quit of a most invidious office[79].\r\n\r\n  [79] For Jourdan’s personal views, see his _Mémoires_, ed.\r\n  Grouchy, p. 282.\r\n\r\nBefore Jourdan’s departure there had been some small movements of\r\nthe French troops: hearing vague rumours of the passage eastward of\r\nEguia’s army, King Joseph ordered a corresponding shift of his own\r\ntroops towards that quarter. Soult and the 2nd Corps were ordered\r\nfrom Plasencia to Oropesa and Talavera, there relieving Mortier and\r\nthe 5th Corps, who were to push up the Tagus toward Toledo. This\r\nwould enable Victor to call up Sebastiani’s cavalry and two of his\r\ninfantry divisions from Toledo into La Mancha. Having thus got\r\ntogether some 25,000 men, Victor advanced to Daimiel, and pressed in\r\nthe advanced posts of the main Spanish army on October 15. Eguia, who\r\nwas still in temporary command, since Areizaga had not yet arrived,\r\nmade no attempt to stand, but retired into the passes of the Sierra\r\nMorena. This apparent timidity of the enemy convinced the Marshal\r\nthat nothing dangerous was on hand in this quarter. He drew back\r\nhis army into cantonments, in a semicircle from Toledo to Tarancon,\r\nleaving the cavalry of Milhaud and Paris out in his front.\r\n\r\nNothing more happened in La Mancha for a fortnight: but on the other\r\nwing, in the kingdom of Leon, matters came to a head sooner. About\r\nthe middle of September the bulk of the Galician army, the divisions\r\nof Losada, Belveder and La Carrera, had moved down the Portuguese\r\nfrontier via Alcanizas, and joined Del Parque at Ciudad Rodrigo. On\r\nthe twenty-fifth of the same month the Prince of Anglona, with the\r\ncavalry brigade from Estremadura, also came in to unite himself to\r\nthe Army of the Left. Del Parque had thus 25,000 infantry and 1,500\r\nhorse concentrated. He had still to be joined by Ballasteros and the\r\nAsturians, who had to pick their way with caution through the plains\r\nof Leon. Mahy and the 4th division of the Galicians had been left in\r\nthe passes above Astorga, to cover the high-road into Galicia. He\r\nhad a vanguard in Astorga, under Santocildes, and the town, whose\r\nwalls had been repaired by the order of La Romana, was now capable of\r\nmaking some defence.\r\n\r\nFacing Del Parque and his lieutenants there were two distinct forces.\r\nThe 6th Corps, now under Marchand, was concentrated at Salamanca.\r\nHaving received few or no drafts since its return from Galicia it was\r\nrather weak--its twenty-one battalions and four cavalry regiments\r\nonly counted at the end of September some 13,000 bayonets and 1,200\r\nsabres[80] effective--the sick being numerous. In the north of Leon\r\nand in Old Castile Kellermann was in charge, with an independent\r\nforce of no great strength: his own division of dragoons, nearly\r\n3,000 sabres, was its only formidable unit. The infantry was composed\r\nof three Swiss battalions, and four or five French battalions, which\r\nhad been left in garrisons in Old Castile when the regiments to\r\nwhich they belonged went southward in the preceding winter[81].\r\nThe whole did not amount to more than 3,500 bayonets. The dragoons\r\nwere very serviceable in the vast plains of Leon, but it was with\r\ndifficulty, and only by cutting down garrisons to a dangerous extent,\r\nthat Kellermann could assemble a weak infantry brigade of 2,000 men\r\nto back the horsemen.\r\n\r\n  [80] See the table given by Sprünglin on p. 366 of his _Mémoires_.\r\n\r\n  [81] Apparently Kellermann had at this moment a battalion each of\r\n  the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Swiss, a battalion of the Garde de Paris,\r\n  one each of the 12th Léger and 32nd Line, and one or two of the\r\n  122nd.\r\n\r\nIt was nevertheless on Kellermann’s side, and by the initiative of\r\nthe French, that the first clash took place in north-western Spain.\r\nHearing vague reports of the movement of the Galician divisions\r\ntowards Ciudad Rodrigo, Kellermann sent General Carrié, with two\r\nregiments of dragoons and 1,200 infantry, to occupy Astorga, being\r\nignorant apparently that it was now garrisoned and more or less\r\nfortified. Carrié found the place occupied, made a weak attack upon\r\nit on October 9, and was beaten off. He was able to report to his\r\nchief that the Spaniards (i. e. Mahy’s division) were in some force\r\nin the passes beyond.\r\n\r\nAt much the same moment that this fact was ascertained Del Parque\r\nbegan to move: he had been lying since September 24 at Fuente\r\nGuinaldo in the highland above Ciudad Rodrigo. On October 5 he\r\nmade an advance as far as Tamames, on the by-road from Rodrigo to\r\nSalamanca which skirts the mountains, wisely avoiding the high-road\r\nin the more level ground by San Martin del Rio and Castrejon. He had\r\nwith him his three Galician divisions and his 1,500 horse, but he\r\nhad not brought forward his raw Leonese division under Castrofuerte,\r\nwhich still lay by Rodrigo. On hearing of the duke’s advance Marchand\r\nsent out reconnaissances, and having discovered the position of the\r\nSpaniards, resolved at once to attack them. On October 17 he started\r\nout from Salamanca, taking with him his whole corps, except the two\r\nbattalions of the 50th regiment, which were left to garrison the town.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the next day Marchand came in sight of the enemy,\r\nwho was drawn up ready to receive him on the heights above Tamames.\r\nThe French general had with him nineteen battalions, some 12,000\r\nbayonets--his 1,200 horse, and fourteen guns. Del Parque had 20,000\r\nGalician infantry, Anglona’s cavalry, and eighteen guns: his position\r\nwas so strong, and his superiority in infantry so marked, that he was\r\nprobably justified in risking a battle on the defensive.\r\n\r\nTamames, an unwalled village of moderate size, lies at the foot of a\r\nrange of swelling hills. Its strategical importance lies in the fact\r\nthat it is the meeting-place of the two country roads from Ciudad\r\nRodrigo to Salamanca _via_ Matilla, and from Ciudad Rodrigo to Bejar\r\nand the Pass of Baños _via_ Nava Redonda. Placed there, Del Parque’s\r\narmy threatened Salamanca, and had a choice of lines of retreat,\r\nthe roads to Rodrigo and to the passes into Estremadura being both\r\nopen. But retreat was not the duke’s intention. He had drawn up his\r\narmy on the heights above Tamames, occupying the village below with\r\na battalion or two. On the right, where the hillside was steeper,\r\nhe had placed Losada and the 2nd Division: on the left, where the\r\nridge sinks down gently into the plain, was Martin de la Carrera\r\nwith the Vanguard Division. The Conde de Belveder’s division--the\r\nthird--formed the reserve, and was drawn up on the reverse slope,\r\nbehind La Carrera. The Prince of Anglona’s cavalry brigade was out on\r\nthe extreme left, partly hidden by woods, in the low ground beyond\r\nthe flank of the Vanguard.\r\n\r\nMarchand, arriving on the ground in the afternoon after a march of\r\nfourteen miles from Matilla, was overjoyed to see the enemy offering\r\nbattle, and attacked without a moment’s hesitation. His arrangements\r\nmuch resembled those of Victor at Ucles--though his luck was to be\r\nvery different. It was clear that the Spanish left was the weak\r\npoint, and that the heights could be turned and ascended on that side\r\nwith ease. Accordingly Maucune’s brigade (six battalions in all)[82]\r\nand the light cavalry, strengthened by one regiment of dragoons, were\r\nordered to march off to the right, to form in a line perpendicular\r\nto that of Del Parque, and break down his flank. When this movement\r\nwas well developed, Marcognet’s brigade (six battalions)[83] was to\r\nattack the Spanish centre, to the east of the village of Tamames,\r\nwhile the 25th Léger (two battalions) was to contain the hostile\r\nright by a demonstration against the high and difficult ground in\r\nthat direction. Marchand kept in reserve, behind his centre, the 27th\r\nand 59th of the Line (six battalions) and his remaining regiment\r\nof dragoons. The vice of this formation was that the striking\r\nforce--Maucune’s column--was too weak: it would have been wise to\r\nhave strengthened it at the expense of the centre, and to have made a\r\nmere demonstration against the heights above the village of Tamames,\r\nas well as on the extreme French left.\r\n\r\n  [82] 6th Léger (two batts.), 69th Line (three batts.), and one\r\n  battalion of _voltigeurs réunis_.\r\n\r\n  [83] 39th and 76th of the Line.\r\n\r\nMaucune accomplished his flank march undisturbed, deployed in front\r\nof La Carrera’s left and advanced against it. The Spanish general\r\nthrew back his wing to protect himself, and ordered his cavalry\r\nto threaten the flank of the advancing force. But he was nearly\r\nswept away: when the skirmishing lines were in contact, the French\r\nbrigadier ordered his cavalry to charge the centre of the Spanish\r\ndivision: striking in diagonally, Lorcet’s Hussars and Chasseurs\r\nbroke La Carrera’s line, and captured the six guns of his divisional\r\nartillery. Almost at the same moment Anglona’s cavalry came in upon\r\nMaucune’s flank; but being opposed by two battalions of the 69th in\r\nsquare, they received but one fire and fled hastily to the rear.\r\nMaucune then resumed his march up the hill, covering his flank with\r\nhis horsemen, and pushing La Carrera’s broken line before him. But at\r\nthe head of the slope he met Belveder’s reserve, which let the broken\r\ntroops pass through their intervals, and took up the fight steadily\r\nenough. The French were now opposed by triple numbers, and the combat\r\ncame to a standstill: Maucune’s offensive power was exhausted, and\r\nhe could no longer use his cavalry on the steep ground which he had\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF TAMAMES. Oct. 18, 1809.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on seeing their right brigade opening the combat with\r\nsuch success, the two other French columns went forward, Marcognet\r\nagainst the Spanish centre, Anselme of the 25th Léger against the\r\nextreme right. But the ground was here much steeper: Losada’s\r\nGalician division stood its ground very steadily, and Marcognet’s\r\ntwo regiments made an involuntary halt three-quarters of the way up\r\nthe heights, under the full fire of the two Spanish batteries\r\nthere placed and the long line of infantry. The officers made several\r\ndesperate attempts to induce the columns to resume their advance, but\r\nto no effect. They fell in great numbers, and at last the regiments\r\nrecoiled and descended the hill in disorder. Losada’s battalions\r\npursued them to the foot of the slope, and the Spanish light troops\r\nin the village sallied out upon their flank, and completed their\r\nrout. Marcognet’s brigade poured down into the plain as a disordered\r\nmass of fugitives, and were only stayed when Marchand brought up the\r\n27th and 59th to their rescue. Del Parque wisely halted the pursuing\r\nforce before it came into contact with the French reserves, and took\r\nup again his post on the heights.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the 25th Léger, on the extreme French right, had not\r\npressed its attack home, and retreated when the central advance was\r\nrepulsed. Maucune, too, seeing the rout to his left, withdrew from\r\nthe heights under cover of his cavalry, carrying off only one of the\r\nSpanish guns that he had taken early in the fight, and leaving in\r\nreturn a disabled piece of his own on the hill.\r\n\r\nThe battle was fairly lost, and Marchand retired, under cover of\r\nhis cavalry along the Salamanca road. The enemy made no serious\r\nattempt to pursue him in the plain, where his horsemen would have\r\nbeen able to act with advantage. The French had lost 1,300 or 1,400\r\nmen, including 18 officers killed, and a general (Lorcet) and 54\r\nofficers wounded[84]. Marcognet’s brigade supplied the greater part\r\nof the casualties; the 76th lost its eagle, seven officers killed and\r\nfifteen wounded: the 39th almost as many. The cavalry and Maucune’s\r\nbrigade suffered little. The very moderate Spanish loss was 713\r\nkilled and wounded, mostly in La Carrera’s division.\r\n\r\n  [84] Marchand in his dispatch says 1,300 men in all were lost,\r\n  and a gun; he makes no mention of the eagle. His aide-de-camp,\r\n  Sprünglin, who has a good account of the battle in his _Mémoires_\r\n  (pp. 370-1), gives the total of 1,500. The Spaniards exaggerated\r\n  the loss to 3,000.\r\n\r\nThis was the first general action since Baylen in which the Spaniards\r\ngained a complete victory. They had a superiority of about seven\r\nto four in numbers, and a good position; nevertheless the troops\r\nwere so raw, and the past record of the Army of the Left was so\r\ndisheartening, that the victory reflects considerable credit on the\r\nGalicians. The 6th Corps was reckoned the best of all the French\r\nunits in Spain, being entirely composed of old regiments from the\r\narmy of Germany. It is not too much to say that Ney’s absence was\r\nresponsible for the defeat of his men. Marchand attacked at three\r\npoints, and was weak at each. The Marshal would certainly have\r\nmassed a whole division against the Spanish left, and would not have\r\nbeen stopped by the stout resistance made by Belveder’s reserve. A\r\ndemonstration by a few battalions would have ‘contained’ Losada’s\r\ntroops on the left, where the ground was too unfavourable for a\r\nserious attack[85].\r\n\r\n  [85] ‘La perte de cette affaire fut entièrement due à la faute\r\n  que fit le Général Marchand de multiplier ses attaques, et de\r\n  s’engager par petits paquets. Tout le monde se mêlait de donner\r\n  son avis, et on remarquait l’absence de M. le Maréchal,’ says\r\n  Sprünglin in p. 371 of his _Mémoires_.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October the beaten army reached Salamanca by a\r\nforced march. Marchand feared that the enemy would now manœuvre\r\neither by Ledesma, so as to cut him off from Kellermann and the\r\ntroops in the north, or by Alba de Tormes, so as to intercept his\r\ncommunication with Madrid. In either case he would have to retreat,\r\nfor there was no good defensive ground on the Tormes to resist an\r\narmy coming from the west. As a matter of fact Del Parque moved by\r\nLedesma, for two reasons: the first was that he wished to avoid the\r\nplains, fearing that Kellermann might have joined the 6th Corps\r\nwith his cavalry division. The second was that, by moving in this\r\ndirection, he hoped to make his junction with Ballasteros, who had\r\nstarted from the Asturias to join him, and had been reported to have\r\nmoved from Astorga to Miranda del Duero, and to be feeling his way\r\nsouth-eastward. The juncture took place: the Asturian division, after\r\nan unsuccessful attempt to cut off the garrison of Zamora on the\r\nseventeenth, had marched to Ledesma, and met the main army there. Del\r\nParque had now 28,000 men, and though still very weak in cavalry,\r\nthought himself strong enough to march on Salamanca. He reached it on\r\nOctober 25 and found it evacuated. Marchand, learning that Kellermann\r\nwas too far off to help him, and knowing that no reinforcements\r\nfrom Madrid could reach him for many days, had evacuated the town\r\non the previous evening. He retired towards Toro, thus throwing up\r\nhis communications with Madrid in order to make sure of joining\r\nKellermann. This seems doubtful policy, for that general could only\r\naid him with 4,000 or 5,000 men, and their joint force would be\r\nunder 20,000 strong. On the other hand, by retiring on Peñaranda or\r\nMedina de Campo, and so approaching the King’s army, he could have\r\ncounted on picking up much larger reinforcements, and on resuming the\r\nstruggle with a good prospect of success.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Jourdan, on hearing of the disaster of Tamames,\r\nhad dispatched, to aid the 6th Corps, Godinot’s brigade of Dessolles’\r\ndivision, some 3,500 bayonets, from Madrid, and Heudelet’s division\r\nof the 2nd Corps, about 4,000 strong, from Oropesa, as well as a\r\ncouple of regiments of cavalry. He made these detachments without\r\nscruple, because there was as yet no sign of any activity on the part\r\nof the Spanish armies of La Mancha and Estremadura. A week later he\r\nwould have found it much more hazardous to weaken his front in the\r\nvalley of the Tagus. These were the last orders issued by Jourdan,\r\nwho resigned his post on October 31, while Soult on November 5\r\narrived at Madrid and replaced him as chief of the staff to King\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nDel Parque, not unnaturally elated by his victory, now nourished\r\nambitious ideas of clearing the whole of Leon and Old Castile of\r\nthe enemy, being aware that the armies of La Mancha and Estremadura\r\nought now to be on the move, and that full occupation would be found\r\nere long for the French corps in the valley of the Tagus. He ordered\r\nup his 5th Division, the raw Leonese battalions of Castrofuerte,\r\nfrom Ciudad Rodrigo, and made vehement appeals to the Portuguese\r\nGovernment to lend him the whole of Beresford’s army for a great\r\nadvance up the Douro. The Regency, though much pressed by the Spanish\r\nambassador at Lisbon, gave a blank refusal, following Wellington’s\r\nadvice to have nothing to do with offensive operations in Spanish\r\ncompany[86]. But part of Beresford’s troops were ordered up to\r\nthe frontier, not so much to lend a moral support to Del Parque’s\r\nadvance[87] as to be ready to defend their own borders in the event\r\nof his defeat. Showing more prudence than Wellington had expected,\r\nDel Parque did not push forward from Salamanca, when he became\r\ncertain that he would have to depend on his own forces alone. Even\r\nafter the arrival of his reserves from Rodrigo he remained quiet,\r\nonly pushing out reconnaissances to discover which way the enemy had\r\ngone. He had, in fact, carried out his part in the Central Junta’s\r\nplan of campaign, by calling the attention of the French to the\r\nnorth, and distracting troops thither from the King’s army. It was\r\nnow the time for Albuquerque and Areizaga to take up the game, and\r\nrelieve him. Marchand meanwhile had retired across the Douro, and\r\ntaken up an extended line behind it from Zamora to Tordesillas--a\r\nfront of over forty miles--which it would have been impossible to\r\nhold with his 13,000 men against a heavy attack delivered at one\r\npoint. But he was hardly in position when Kellermann arrived, took\r\nover the command, and changed the whole plan of campaign (November\r\n1). He had left two battalions to guard Benavente, two to hold\r\nValladolid, and had only brought up his 3,000 dragoons and 1,500\r\ninfantry. Seeing that it was absolutely necessary to recover the\r\nline of communication with Madrid, he ordered the 6th Corps to leave\r\nZamora and Toro, mass at Tordesillas, and then cross the Douro to\r\nMedina del Campo, the junction point of the roads from Madrid,\r\nSegovia, Valladolid, and Toro. To this same place he brought up his\r\nown small force, and having received Godinot’s brigade from Madrid,\r\nhad thirty-four battalions and eighteen squadrons concentrated--about\r\n23,000 men. Though not yet joined by the other troops from the\r\nsouth--Heudelet’s division--he now marched straight upon Salamanca\r\nin two columns, one by Cantalapiedra, the other by Fuente Sauco,\r\nintending to offer battle to Del Parque.\r\n\r\n  [86] Del Parque’s demands had begun as early as the end of\r\n  September, see Wellington to Castlereagh, Badajoz, Sept. 29,\r\n  _Dispatches_, v. 200-1, and cf. Wellington to Forjaz, Oct. 15,\r\n  ibid. 223.\r\n\r\n  [87] Wellington to Beresford, Nov. 16, 1809.\r\n\r\nBut the duke, much to the surprise of every one, utterly refused\r\nto fight, holding the plain too dangerous for an army so weak in\r\ncavalry as his own, and over-estimating the enemy’s force at 36,000\r\nmen[88]. He retired from Salamanca, after having held it less than\r\na fortnight, on November 5, and took not the road to Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nbut that to Bejar and the Pass of Baños, as if he were about to\r\npass the mountains into Estremadura[89]. This was an excellent\r\nmove: the French could not pursue him in force without evacuating\r\nOld Castile and Leon, which it would have been impossible for them\r\nto contemplate. For when Kellermann had concentrated his troops to\r\nstrike at Salamanca, there was nothing left behind him in the vast\r\nupland save a battalion or two at Benavente, Valladolid, and Burgos.\r\nMahy, from Galicia, and the Asturians might have overrun the whole\r\nregion unopposed. As it was, the whole of the provinces behind the\r\nDouro showed signs of bursting out into insurrection. Julian Sanchez,\r\nthe Empecinado, and other guerrillero chiefs, whose names were soon\r\nto be famous, raised large bands during the absence of the normal\r\ngarrisons, and swept the country-side, capturing convoys and cutting\r\nthe lines of communication between Vittoria, Burgos, and Valladolid.\r\nPorlier came down with a flying column from the Asturias, assaulted\r\nPalencia, and threatened Burgos. The French governors on every side\r\nkept reporting their perilous position, when they could get a message\r\nthrough to Madrid[90].\r\n\r\n  [88] He sent this estimate to Wellington, see the latter to\r\n  Beresford, Badajoz, Nov. 16.\r\n\r\n  [89] The Junta afterwards contemplated bringing him down to join\r\n  Albuquerque, via Plasencia, which was free of French troops,\r\n  since Soult had moved to Oropesa. But this does not seem to have\r\n  been thought of so early as Nov. 5.\r\n\r\n  [90] See Soult to Clarke, from Madrid, Nov. 6, for these\r\n  movements.\r\n\r\nRealizing that he must cover his rear, or the whole of Old Castile\r\nwould be lost to the insurgents, Kellermann, after occupying\r\nSalamanca on November 6, left the 6th Corps and Godinot’s brigade\r\ndistributed between Ledesma, Salamanca, and Alba de Tormes, watching\r\nDel Parque, and returned in haste with his own troops to the Douro.\r\nHe commenced to send out flying columns from Valladolid to deal with\r\nthe guerrilleros, but did not work too far afield, lest he might be\r\ncalled back by a new forward movement on the part of the Army of\r\nthe Left. But in a few days he had to recast all his arrangements,\r\nfor--as Del Parque had calculated--the campaign in La Mancha had\r\njust opened, and the position of the French in Leon and Old Castile\r\nwas profoundly affected by the new developments.\r\n\r\nIn the south, as we have already explained, the Junta designed\r\nAlbuquerque’s army of Estremadura to be a mere demonstrating force,\r\nwhile Areizaga’s 55,000 men were to strike the real blow. The\r\nEstremaduran troops, as was proper, moved early to draw the attention\r\nof the enemy. Albuquerque’s first division under Bassecourt--6,000\r\ninfantry and 600 horse--was on the Tagus from Almaraz to Meza\r\nde Ibor: his second division under St. Juan and the rest of his\r\ncavalry--some 4,000 in all--were moving up from Truxillo. Bassecourt\r\nbegan by sending a small force of all arms across the river at\r\nAlmaraz, to drive in Soult’s outposts and spread reports abroad in\r\nall directions that he was acting as the vanguard to Wellington’s\r\narmy, which was marching up from Badajoz. Unfortunately the full\r\neffect that he desired was not produced, because deserters informed\r\nSoult that the British Army was still quiescent on the Guadiana[91].\r\nThe French made no movement, and left the 2nd Corps alone to watch\r\nAlbuquerque.\r\n\r\n  [91] Soult to Clarke, from Madrid, Nov. 6. The deserters were a\r\n  body of twenty-one men of the Walloon Guards, who had enlisted\r\n  from Dupont’s prisoners in order to get a chance of escaping:\r\n  they reached Oropesa on Oct. 25.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Areizaga, within a few days of assuming the command of the\r\narmy of La Mancha, commenced his forward movement. On November 3,\r\nhaving concentrated his eight divisions of infantry and his 5,700\r\nhorse at Santa Cruz de Mudela, at the foot of the passes, he gave\r\nthe order to advance into the plains. The head quarters followed the\r\nhigh-road, with the train and three divisions: the rest, to avoid\r\nencumbering the _chaussée_, marched by parallel side-roads, but were\r\nnever more than ten miles from their Commander-in-Chief: at any rate\r\nAreizaga avoided the sin of dispersion. His army was the best which\r\nhad been seen under the Spanish banners since Tudela. The men had all\r\nbeen furnished with new clothes and equipment since August, mainly\r\nfrom English stores landed at Cadiz. There were sixty guns, and\r\nsuch a body of cavalry as had never yet been collected during the\r\nwar. The value of the troops was very unequal; if there were many\r\nold battalions of the regular army, there were also many new units\r\ncomposed of half-trained Andalusian levies. The cavalry included the\r\nold runaways of Medellin, and many other regiments of doubtful value.\r\nThe morale was on the whole not satisfactory. ‘I wish I had anything\r\nagreeable to communicate to you from this army’ wrote Colonel Roche,\r\na British officer attached to Areizaga’s staff, to Wellington. ‘The\r\ncorps which belonged to the original army of La Mancha are certainly\r\nin every respect superior to those from Estremadura, and from\r\neverything that I can learn none of those abuses which were to be\r\nlamented in the army of Estremadura existed here--or, at least, in\r\na much less degree. But nothing can exceed the general discontent,\r\ndissatisfaction, and demoralization of the mass of the people and of\r\nthe army. How can anybody who has the faculty of reason separate the\r\ninefficiency, intrigue, bad organization, and consequent disasters\r\nof the army from the source of all those evils in the Junta? There\r\nis not a man of the least reflection who, as things now stand, has a\r\nhope of success; and this is the more melancholy, because the mass of\r\nthe people are just as inveterate in their resentment and abhorrence\r\nof the French as at the first hour of the revolution[92].’ The fact\r\nseems to have been that the superior officers doubted the wisdom of\r\ntaking the offensive according to the Junta’s orders, and had no\r\nconfidence in Areizaga, who was only known as a fighting general, and\r\nhad no reputation for skill. The rank and file, as Arteche remarks,\r\nwere disposed to do their duty, but had no confidence in their\r\nluck[93]. Their government and not their generals must take the major\r\npart of the blame for the disaster that followed.\r\n\r\n  [92] Roche to Wellington, from Santa Cruz de la Mudela,\r\n  _Wellington Supplementary Dispatches_, vi. 394. Cf. also the same\r\n  to the same, vi. 414.\r\n\r\n  [93] _Historia de la Guerra de la Independencia_, vii. 283.\r\n\r\nAreizaga was well aware that his best chance was to strike with\r\nextreme boldness and vigour, and to dash into the midst of the French\r\nbefore they could concentrate. Hence his march was at first conducted\r\nwith great rapidity and decision; between the 3rd and the 8th of\r\nNovember he made nearly fifteen miles a day, though the roads were\r\nsomewhat broken up by the autumn rains. On the eighth he reached\r\nLa Guardia, eighty miles from his starting-point, and his advanced\r\ncavalry under General Freire had its first skirmish with a brigade of\r\nMilhaud’s dragoons at Costa de Madera, near Dos Barrios. The Spanish\r\nhorse deployed in such numbers that the French were compelled to move\r\noff in haste and with some loss, though they had beaten off with ease\r\nthe first two or three regiments which had gone forward against them.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish advance had been so rapid and so unexpected that Soult\r\nand King Joseph had been taken completely by surprise. On November\r\n6 the Marshal had reported to Paris that ‘the troops on the Tagus\r\nand in La Mancha are up to the present unmolested, and as, from all\r\nI can learn, there is no prospect of the enemy making any offensive\r\nmovement on that side, I intend to form from them a strong flying\r\ncolumn to hunt the brigands in the direction of Burgos[94].’ Only\r\nfour days later he had to announce that an army of at least 40,000\r\nmen was close in front of Aranjuez, and not more than thirty-five\r\nmiles from Madrid, and that he was hurrying together troops from all\r\nquarters to make head against them. At the moment indeed, there was\r\nnothing directly between Areizaga’s vanguard at La Guardia and the\r\nSpanish capital, save the Polish division of the 4th Corps stationed\r\nat Aranjuez, and Milhaud’s five regiments of dragoons at Ocaña. If\r\nthe Spaniard had pushed on for three days more at his starting pace,\r\nhe might have crossed the Tagus, and have forced King Joseph to\r\nfight, close in front of Madrid, with an imperfectly assembled army.\r\nOn the ninth and tenth Leval’s Germans were in march from Toledo to\r\nAranjuez to join Sebastiani’s Poles: Mortier’s first division was\r\nhurrying from Talavera to Toledo, and his second division was making\r\nready to follow. The 2nd Corps, despite Albuquerque’s demonstration\r\nin front of Almaraz, was preparing to quit Oropesa, in order to\r\nreplace Mortier’s men at Talavera. Victor, in the meanwhile, with\r\nthe First Corps, was lying in front of Toledo at Ajofrin, with his\r\ncavalry at Mora and Yebenes: he reported that no hostile force had\r\ncome his way, but that he had ascertained that a large army had\r\nmarched past his front along the great _chaussée_ from Madridejos to\r\nAranjuez. He was in a position to attack it in rear and flank, if\r\nthere was a sufficient force gathered in its front to justify him in\r\nclosing[95].\r\n\r\n  [94] Soult to Clarke, Madrid, Nov. 6.\r\n\r\n  [95] Soult to Clarke, Madrid, Nov. 10.\r\n\r\nBut on reaching La Guardia, Areizaga seemed suddenly to realize\r\nthe dangers of his movement. No doubt it was the news that Victor\r\nwas almost in his rear that paralysed him, but he halted on the\r\nninth, when a bold advance would certainly have enabled him to seize\r\nAranjuez, by evicting the small force under Milhaud and Sebastiani.\r\nFor three fatal days, the 9th, 10th, and 11th of November, the\r\nSpanish main body remained halted in a mass at La Guardia, as if for\r\nthe special purpose of allowing the enemy to concentrate. On the\r\neleventh Areizaga at last began to move again: he sent forward the\r\nwhole of his cavalry, supported by Zayas and his Vanguard division,\r\nto press back the force in his front. They found Milhaud’s five\r\nregiments of dragoons ranged in line of battle before the small town\r\nof Ocaña, and supported by Sebastiani’s Polish infantry. Freire\r\nadvanced, using his triple superiority of numbers to turn both flanks\r\nof the French cavalry; Milhaud, after some partial charges, retired\r\nbehind the Poles, who formed a line of six battalion squares. The\r\nSpanish horse made a half-hearted attempt to attack them, but were\r\nrepelled by their rolling fire before they came to close quarters,\r\nand drew back. It was now four o’clock in the afternoon, and the\r\nSpanish infantry was only just beginning to come up. Zayas and Freire\r\nagreed that it was too late to begin a second attack, and put off\r\nfighting till the next morning. But during the night the French\r\nevacuated Ocaña and retired to Aranjuez, wisely judging that it would\r\nbe insane to wait for the arrival of the Spanish main body. They had\r\nlost about fifty men, Freire’s cavalry just over two hundred.\r\n\r\nNext day [November 12], Areizaga brought up the whole of his army to\r\nOcaña, and his cavalry reconnoitred up to the gates of Aranjuez and\r\nthe bridge of Puente La Reyna. Sebastiani made ready to defend them,\r\nand having been joined by the German division from Toledo, wrote to\r\nSoult to say that he would resist to the last extremity, in order\r\nto gain time for the arrival of Victor’s corps and the other troops\r\nwhich were marching up from the west and north[96]. The attack\r\nwhich he expected was never delivered. Areizaga, nervous about the\r\npresence of the 1st Corps on his flank, had resolved to shift his\r\narmy eastward to get further away from it. Abandoning his line of\r\ncommunication by La Guardia and Madridejos, he marched his whole\r\nforce by cross-roads parallel to the Tagus up to La Zarza, and seized\r\nthe fords of Villamanrique, twenty-five miles above Aranjuez, on the\r\nMadrid-Albacete road. If Victor, as he supposed, had been manœuvring\r\non his flank, this movement would have cut him off from his base in\r\nAndalusia, and have left him only the mountains of Murcia as a line\r\nof retreat. But, as a matter of fact, the 1st Corps was no longer at\r\nAjofrin or Mora, but had been called behind the Tagus, so that his\r\nretreat was safer than he supposed.\r\n\r\n  [96] Sebastiani to Soult, night of the twelfth-thirteenth, from\r\n  Aranjuez.\r\n\r\nSoult and King Joseph, meanwhile, had been completing their\r\nconcentration. They had written to Kellermann, ordering him to send\r\nback to Madrid without delay the brigade of Dessolles’ division\r\nunder Godinot which had been lent him, and to spare them as well one\r\ninfantry brigade of the 6th Corps. These troops were too far off\r\nto be available at once; but of the remainder of their units the\r\nRoyal Guard and Spanish battalions of King Joseph, with Dessolles’\r\nremaining brigade, were moved out to support Sebastiani. Victor\r\nhad been brought back across the Tagus, and was also marching on\r\nAranjuez. Mortier’s corps was concentrated at Toledo, while the 2nd\r\nCorps was in motion from Oropesa to Talavera, having discovered no\r\nsigns of a serious advance on the part of Albuquerque. The care of\r\nMadrid was handed over to the incomplete French division of the 4th\r\nCorps[97], some of whose battalions were dispersed at Guadalajara,\r\nAlcala, Segovia, and other garrisons. Paris’s light cavalry of the\r\nsame corps was also at this moment watching the roads to the east of\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\n  [97] It had still no divisional general, and was officially known\r\n  by the name of ‘Sebastiani’s division’--regiments 28th, 32nd,\r\n  58th, 75th.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth Areizaga threw Lacy’s division across the Tagus,\r\nand laid down two pontoon bridges near Villamanrique, so as to be\r\nable to bring over his whole army in the shortest possible time.\r\nBut the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth were days of storm,\r\nthe river rose high, and the artillery and train stuck fast on the\r\nvile cross-roads from Ocaña over which they were being brought. In\r\nconsequence less than half the Spanish army was north of the Tagus\r\non November 15, though the advance cavalry pushed on to the line of\r\nthe Tajuna, and skirmished with Paris’s _chasseurs_ about Arganda.\r\nIt seemed nevertheless that Areizaga was committed to an advance\r\nupon Madrid by the high-road from Albacete, wherefore Soult blew up\r\nthe bridges of Aranjuez and Puente la Reyna, and ordered Victor to\r\nmarch from Aranjuez on Arganda with the 1st Corps, nearly 20,000 men,\r\npurposing to join him with the King’s reserves and to offer battle on\r\nthe Tajuna, while Mortier and Sebastiani’s Poles and Germans should\r\nfall upon the enemy’s flank. But this plan was foiled by a new move\r\nupon Areizaga’s part; he now commenced a retreat as objectless as his\r\nlate advance. Just as Victor’s cavalry came in touch with his front,\r\nhe withdrew his whole army across the Tagus, destroyed his bridges,\r\nand retired to La Zarza on the seventeenth, evidently with the\r\nintention of recovering his old line of communication with Andalusia,\r\nvia Ocaña and Madridejos.\r\n\r\nThe moment that this new departure became evident, Soult reversed\r\nthe marching orders of all his columns save Victor’s, and bade them\r\nreturn hastily to Aranjuez, where the bridge was repaired in haste,\r\nand to cross the Tagus there, with the intention of intercepting\r\nAreizaga’s line of retreat and forcing a battle on him near Ocaña.\r\nVictor, however, had got so far to the east that it would have wasted\r\ntime to bring him back to Aranjuez, wherefore he was directed to\r\ncross the river at Villamanrique and follow hard in Areizaga’s rear.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eighteenth Milhaud’s and Paris’s cavalry,\r\nriding at the head of the French army, crossed the Tagus at Aranjuez,\r\nand pressing forward met, between Ontigola and Ocaña, Freire’s\r\nhorsemen moving at the head of Areizaga’s column, which on this\r\nday was strung out between La Zarza and Noblejas, marching hastily\r\nwestward towards the high-road. The collision of Milhaud and Freire\r\nbrought about the largest cavalry fight which took place during the\r\nwhole Peninsular War. For Milhaud and Paris had eight regiments,\r\nnearly 3,000 men, while three of Freire’s four divisions were\r\npresent, to the number of over 4,000 sabres. On neither side was any\r\ninfantry in hand.\r\n\r\nSebastiani, who had come up with the light cavalry of his corps, was\r\neager for a fight, and engaged at once. Charging the Spanish front\r\nline with Paris’s light horse, he broke it with ease: but Freire came\r\non with his reserves, forming the greater part of them into a solid\r\ncolumn--an odd formation for cavalry. Into this mass Milhaud charged\r\nwith four regiments of dragoons. The heaviness of their formation\r\ndid not suffice to enable the Spaniards to stand. They broke when\r\nattacked, and went to the rear in disorder, leaving behind them\r\neighty prisoners and some hundreds of killed and wounded. The French\r\nlost only a few scores, but among them was Paris, the not unworthy\r\nsuccessor of the adventurous Lasalle in command of the light cavalry\r\ndivision attached to the 4th Corps.\r\n\r\nMoving forward in pursuit of the routed squadrons, Sebastiani\r\napproached Ocaña, but halted on discovering that there was already\r\nSpanish infantry in the town. The head of Areizaga’s long column had\r\nreached it, while the cavalry combat was in progress: the rest was\r\nvisible slowly moving up by cross-roads from the east. Soult was\r\nat once apprised that the enemy’s army was close in his front--so\r\nclose that it could not get away without fighting, for its train and\r\nrearguard were still far behind, and would be cut off if the main\r\nbody moved on without making a stand.\r\n\r\nAreizaga, though he had shown such timidity when faced by\r\nSebastiani’s 9,000 men at Aranjuez, and by Victor’s 20,000 on the\r\nTajuna, now offered battle to the much more formidable force which\r\nSoult was bringing up. He was indeed compelled to fight, partly\r\nbecause his men were too weary to move forward that night, partly\r\nbecause he wished to give time for his train to arrive and get on to\r\nthe _chaussée_.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the nineteenth his army was discovered drawn up in\r\ntwo lines on each side of the town of Ocaña. There were still some\r\n46,000 infantry and 5,500 cavalry under arms despite of the losses\r\nof the late week[98]. The oncoming French army was smaller; though\r\nit mustered 5,000 horse it had only 27,000 foot--the Germans and\r\nPoles of Sebastiani, Mortier with nearly the whole of the 5th Corps,\r\na brigade of Dessolles’ division, the King’s guards, and the cavalry\r\nof Milhaud, Paris, and Beauregard[99]. Victor was too far off to be\r\navailable; having found the flooded Tagus hard to cross, he was on\r\nthis day barely in touch with the extreme rearguard of Areizaga’s\r\narmy which was escorting the train. Being nearly twenty miles from\r\nOcaña, he could not hope to arrive in time for the general action, if\r\nit was to be delivered next morn. If Areizaga stood firm for another\r\nday, Victor would be pressing him from the flank and rear while the\r\nmain army was in his front: but it was highly probable that Areizaga\r\nwould not stand, but would retreat at night; all his previous conduct\r\nargued a great disinclination to risk a battle. Wherefore Soult and\r\nthe King, after a short discussion[100], agreed to attack at once,\r\ndespite their great numerical inferiority. In the open plain of La\r\nMancha a difference of 16,000 or 17,000 infantry was not enough to\r\noutweigh the superior quality and training of the French army.\r\n\r\n  [98] Colborne, in a letter dated December 5, says ‘we had 46,100\r\n  infantry and nearly 6,000 cavalry drawn out, in a very bad\r\n  position.’ He was present all through the campaign, but wrote no\r\n  full report.\r\n\r\n  [99] Viz.\r\n    Mortier’s Infantry Divisions (Girard and Gazan),\r\n      twenty-two batts.

See his letter in vol. vii of\r\n  Ducasse’s _Life and Correspondence of Joseph Napoleon_.\r\n\r\nThere is, so to speak, no position whatever at Ocaña: the little\r\nunwalled town lies in a level upland, where the only natural feature\r\nis a ravine which passes in front of the place; it is sufficiently\r\ndeep and broad at its western end to constitute a military obstacle,\r\nbut east of the town gradually grows slighter and becomes a mere\r\ndip in the ground. Areizaga had chosen this ravine to indicate the\r\nline of his left and centre; but on his right, where it had become\r\nso shallow as to afford no cover, he extended his troops across and\r\nbeyond it. The town was barricaded and occupied, to form a central\r\nsupport to the line. There were olive-groves in the rear of Ocaña\r\nwhich might have served to hide a reserve, or to mark a position for\r\na rally in case a retreat should become necessary. But Areizaga had\r\nmade no preparation of this sort. His trains, with a small escort,\r\nhad not arrived even on the morning of the nineteenth, but were still\r\nbelated on the cross-roads from Noblejas and La Zarza.\r\n\r\nThe order of the Spanish army in line of battle is difficult to\r\nreconstruct, for Areizaga uses very vague language in the dispatch\r\nin which he explained his defeat, and the other documents available,\r\nthough they give detailed accounts of some of the corps, say little\r\nor nothing of others. It seems, however, that Zayas, with the\r\nvanguard division, formed the extreme left, behind the deepest part\r\nof the ravine, with a cavalry brigade under Rivas on its flank and\r\nrear. He had the town of Ocaña on his right. Then followed in the\r\nline, going from left to right, the divisions of Vigodet, Giron,\r\nCastejon, and Lacy. Those of Copons, Jacomé, and Zerain appear\r\nto have formed a second line in support of the other four[101].\r\nVigodet’s left was in the town of Ocaña and strongly posted, but\r\nthe other flank, where Lacy lay, was absolutely in the air, with no\r\nnatural feature to cover it. For this reason Areizaga placed beyond\r\nit Freire, with the whole of the cavalry except the brigade on the\r\nextreme left under Rivas. Unfortunately the Spanish horse, much\r\nshaken by the combat of the preceding day, was a weak protection for\r\nthe flank, despite its formidable numbers. The sixty guns of the\r\nartillery were drawn out in the intervals of the infantry divisions\r\nof the first and second line.\r\n\r\n  [101] This order seems the only one consistent with the sole\r\n  sentence in Areizaga’s dispatch to the Junta in which he explains\r\n  his battle-array: ‘Inmediatamente formé por mi mismo la primera\r\n  linea en direccion de Ocaña, colocando por la izquierda la\r\n  division de Vigodet, defendida por la frente de la gran zanja,\r\n  y por su derecha las divisiones de Giron, Castejon y Lacy: la\r\n  de Copons formaba martillo, junta á las tapias de la villa,\r\n  inmediata á la de Giron, y las demás la secunda linea á distancia\r\n  competente para proteger á la primera.’ The unnamed divisions\r\n  which must have lain beyond Copons in the right of the second\r\n  line are Jacomé and Zerain.\r\n\r\nSoult’s plan of attack was soon formed. The ravine made the Spanish\r\nleft--beyond Ocaña--inaccessible, but also prevented it from taking\r\nany offensive action. The Marshal therefore resolved to ignore it\r\ncompletely, and to concentrate all his efforts against the hostile\r\ncentre and right, in the open ground. The scheme adopted was a\r\nsimple one: Sebastiani’s Polish and German divisions were to attack\r\nthe Spanish right wing, and when they were at close quarters with\r\nthe enemy the main mass of the French cavalry was to fall upon\r\nFreire’s horse, drive it out of the field, and attack on the flank\r\nthe divisions already engaged with the infantry. For this purpose\r\nMilhaud’s, Paris’s, and Beauregard’s regiments, more than 3,500\r\nsabres, were massed behind the Poles and Germans. For a time their\r\nmarch would be masked by olive-groves and undulations of the ground,\r\nso that they might come in quite suddenly upon the enemy. Mortier\r\nwith his first division--that of Girard--and a regiment of Gazan’s,\r\nfollowed in the rear of the Polish and German infantry, to support\r\ntheir frontal attack. Dessolles, with his own brigade and Gazan’s\r\nremaining one, took post opposite Ocaña, ready to fall upon the\r\nSpanish centre, when the attack to his left should have begun to make\r\nway. He had in his front the massed artillery of the 4th and 5th\r\nCorps, thirty guns under Senarmont, which took ground on a low knoll\r\nabove the great ravine, from which they could both play upon the town\r\nof Ocaña and also enfilade part of the Spanish line to its immediate\r\nright--Vigodet’s division and half of Giron’s. Finally the King, with\r\nhis guards and other troops, horse and foot, were placed to the right\r\nrear of Dessolles, to act as a general reserve, or to move against\r\nZayas if he should attempt to cross the ravine and turn the French\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe plan, despite of some checks at the commencement, worked in a\r\nsatisfactory fashion. The German and Polish divisions of Leval and\r\nWerlé attacked Lacy’s and Castejon’s divisions, which gave back\r\nsome little way, in order to align themselves with Vigodet who\r\nwas sheltered by the slight eastern end of the ravine. The enemy\r\nfollowed and brought up six guns to the point to play upon the new\r\nposition which the Spaniards had taken up. The forward movement was\r\ncontinuing, when suddenly to the surprise of the French, Lacy’s,\r\nCastejon’s, and Giron’s men, leaving their places in the line, made\r\na furious counter-charge upon the Poles and Germans, drove them\r\nback for some distance, and threw them into disorder. This movement\r\nwas no result of Areizaga’s generalship: he had betaken himself\r\nto the summit of the church-tower of Ocaña, an inconvenient place\r\nfrom which to issue orders, and practically left his subordinates\r\nto fight their own battle. Mortier was forced to bring forward\r\nGirard’s division to support his broken first line. It was hotly\r\nengaged with Lacy and Giron, when suddenly it felt the Spaniards\r\nslacken in their fire, waver, and break. This was the result of the\r\nintervention of a new force in the field. The great mass of French\r\nsquadrons, which had been sent under Sebastiani to turn the Spanish\r\nright, had now come into action. Arriving close to Freire’s cavalry\r\nbefore it was discovered, it fell on that untrustworthy corps, and\r\nscattered it to the winds in a few minutes. Then, while three or four\r\nregiments followed the routed horsemen, the rest turned inwards upon\r\nthe hostile infantry. The flanks of the first and second lines of\r\nAreizaga’s right were charged simultaneously, and hardly a regiment\r\nhad time to get into square. Brigade after brigade was rolled up\r\nand dispersed or captured; the mass of fugitives, running in upon\r\nthe troops that were frontally engaged with Girard, wrecked them\r\ncompletely. Of the five divisions of the Spanish left, a certain\r\nnumber of steady regiments got away, by closing their ranks and\r\npushing ahead through the confusion, firing on friend and foe alike\r\nwhen they were hustled. But many corps were annihilated, and others\r\ncaptured wholesale. The last seems to have been the fate of nearly\r\nthe whole of Jacomé’s division of the second line, as hardly a single\r\nunit from it is reported as rallied a month later, and the French\r\naccounts speak of a whole column of 6,000 men which laid down its\r\narms in a mass before the light cavalry of the 4th Corps. Just as the\r\nSpanish right broke up, Dessolles with his two brigades, followed\r\nby the King’s reserve, crossed the ravine and attacked the town of\r\nOcaña, and the two divisions--Vigodet and Copons--which lay in first\r\nand second line immediately to the east of it. These retired, and got\r\naway in better order than their comrades to the right. Of all the\r\nSpanish army only Zayas’s vanguard division, on the extreme left, now\r\nremained intact. Areizaga had sent it an order to cross the ravine\r\nand attack the French right, when he saw his army beginning to break\r\nup. Then, a few minutes later, he sent another order bidding it close\r\nto the right and cover the retreat. After this the Commander-in-Chief\r\ndescended from his tower, mounted his horse, and fled. Zayas\r\ncarried out the second order, moved to the right, and found himself\r\nencompassed by masses of fugitives from Giron’s, Castejon’s, and\r\nLacy’s broken divisions, mixed with French cavalry. He sustained,\r\nwith great credit to himself and his troops, a rearguard action for\r\nsome miles, till near the village of Dos Barrios, where his line was\r\nbroken and his men at last mixed with the rest of the fugitives[102].\r\n\r\n  [102] The only detailed accounts of the Spanish movements that\r\n  I have discovered are the divisional reports of Lacy and Zayas,\r\n  both in the Foreign Office archives at the Record Office.\r\n  Areizaga’s dispatch is so vague as to be nearly useless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF OCAÑA. Nov. 19, 1809.]\r\n\r\nThe whole routed multitude now streamed wildly over the plain, with\r\nthe French cavalry in hot pursuit. Thousands of prisoners were\r\ntaken, and the chase only ended with nightfall. The fugitives headed\r\nstraight for the Sierra Morena, and reached it with a rapidity even\r\ngreater than that which they had used in their outward march a\r\nfortnight before. Victor’s cavalry arrived in time to take up the\r\npursuit next morning: they had on their way to the field captured the\r\nwhole of the trains of the Spanish army, on the road from Noblejas\r\nto Ocaña. The losses of Areizaga’s army were appalling; about 4,000\r\nkilled and wounded and 14,000 prisoners. Thirty flags and fifty out\r\nof the sixty guns had been captured. When the wrecks of the army had\r\nbeen rallied in the passes, three weeks after the battle, only some\r\n21,000 infantry[103] and 3,000 horse were reported as present. The\r\ndivisions of Lacy, Jacomé, and Zerain had practically disappeared,\r\nand the others had lost from a third to a half of their numbers. The\r\ncondition of the cavalry was peculiarly disgraceful; as it had never\r\nstood to fight, its losses represent not prisoners, for the most\r\npart, but mere runaways who never returned to their standards. The\r\nFrench had lost about 90 officers and 1,900 men, nearly all in the\r\ndivisions of Leval, Werlé, and Girard[104]. The cavalry, which had\r\ndelivered the great stroke and won the battle, suffered very little.\r\nMortier had been slightly wounded, Leval and Girard severely.\r\n\r\n  [103] Viz. Zayas, Vigodet, and Castejon, about 4,000 men each,\r\n  Copons 3,000, Giron 2,500, remains of the other three divisions\r\n  about 3,500. From the returns in the Madrid War Office.\r\n\r\n  [104] Martinien’s lists of officers killed and wounded show that\r\n  the German division lost 19 officers, the Polish division 23,\r\n  Girard’s division 28--in all 70 out of the total of 94 officers\r\n  hit in the whole army.\r\n\r\nEven allowing for the fact that Areizaga had been the victim of the\r\nJunta’s insensate resolve to make an offensive movement on Madrid,\r\nit is impossible to speak with patience of his generalship. For a\r\ncombination of rashness and vacillation it excels that of any other\r\nSpanish general during the whole war. His only chance was to catch\r\nthe enemy before they could concentrate: he succeeded in doing this\r\nby his rapid march from the passes to La Guardia. Then he waited\r\nthree days in deplorable indecision, though there were only 10,000\r\nmen between him and Madrid. Next he resumed his advance, but by the\r\ncircuitous route of Villamanrique, by taking which he lost three days\r\nmore. Then he halted again, the moment that he found Victor with\r\n20,000 men in his front, though he might still have fought at great\r\nadvantage. Lastly he retreated, yet so slowly and unskilfully that he\r\nwas finally brought to action at Ocaña by the 34,000 men of Mortier\r\nand Sebastiani. He was sent out to win a battle, since Madrid could\r\nnot be delivered without one, and knew that he must fight sooner or\r\nlater, but threw away his favourable opportunities, and then accepted\r\nan action when all the chances were against him. For he must have\r\nknown by this time the miserable quality of his cavalry, yet gave\r\nbattle in a vast plain, where everything depended on the mounted\r\narm. In the actual moment of conflict he seems to have remained in a\r\nhypnotized condition on his church-tower, issuing hardly an order,\r\nand allowing the fight to go as it pleased. Yet he was, by all\r\naccounts, possessed of personal courage, as he had proved at Alcañiz\r\nand elsewhere. Apparently responsibility reduced him to a condition\r\nof vacillating idiocy. Perhaps the most surprising fact of the whole\r\nbusiness is that the Junta retained him in command after his fiasco,\r\nthanked him for his services, and sent him an honorary present--as it\r\nhad done to Cuesta after Medellin with somewhat better excuse. He was\r\nits own man, and it did not throw him over, even when he had proved\r\nhis perfect incompetence.\r\n\r\nTo complete the narrative of the deplorable autumn campaign of 1809,\r\nit only remains to tell of the doings of Albuquerque and Del Parque.\r\nThe former played his part with reasonable success; he was ordered\r\nto distract the attention of the enemy from the army of La Mancha,\r\nand did what he could. Having got some 10,000 men concentrated at\r\nAlmaraz, he sent one column over the Tagus to demonstrate against\r\nthe 2nd Corps from beyond the river, and with another threatened\r\nthe bridge of Talavera from the near side. But Heudelet, now in\r\ncommand of the 2nd Corps, soon found that there was no reality in\r\nhis demonstration, and that he was not supported by the English,\r\nthough he had given out that Wellington was close in his rear. After\r\nskirmishing around Talavera from the 17th to the 22nd of November,\r\nthe Duke hastily recrossed the river on hearing the news of Ocaña,\r\nand resumed his old positions.\r\n\r\nDel Parque’s campaign was more vigorous and more unfortunate. While\r\nhe lay in the passes above Bejar and Baños, he got early news of the\r\nwithdrawal of Godinot’s and Marcognet’s troops toward Madrid, when\r\nSoult summoned them off to reinforce the main army. He reasoned that\r\nsince he had now only the 6th Corps, shorn of one of its brigades,\r\nin his front, he might repeat the success of Tamames, for Marchand\r\nwas weaker than he had been in October, while he himself was far\r\nstronger. Accordingly he disregarded an order from the Junta to\r\nextend his operations southward, and to join Albuquerque in the\r\nvalley of the Tagus. Instead, he marched once more upon Salamanca\r\non November 18, the day before the disaster of Ocaña. He drove in\r\nan outlying brigade of Marchand’s force from Alba de Tormes, and\r\npressed it vigorously back towards the main body. Conscious that with\r\nhis 10,000 men he could not hope to face 30,000, Marchand promptly\r\nevacuated Salamanca on December 19, and retired, just as he had done\r\nin October, behind the Douro, concentrating his whole corps at Toro.\r\nHe sent urgent demands for help both to Kellermann at Valladolid,\r\nand to Soult at Madrid. By the time that they arrived Areizaga had\r\nbeen dealt with, and the army in New Castile could spare as many\r\nreinforcements as were required. Marcognet’s brigade, the one which\r\nhad been borrowed from the 6th Corps, was first sent back from\r\nSegovia, the point which it had reached in its southward march, and\r\nGazan’s division of the 5th Corps was ordered by Soult to follow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Del Parque, still ignorant of the disaster in the south,\r\nhad occupied Salamanca on November 20, and on the following day moved\r\nout towards Cantalapiedra and Medina del Campo, with the object of\r\nthrowing himself between Marchand and Kellermann and the capital.\r\nThis was an excellent move, and, but for what had happened at Ocaña,\r\nmight have had considerable results, since the Army of the Left ought\r\nto have made an end of the small French force in Old Castile.\r\n\r\nKellermann, however, had seen the danger of Marchand’s retreat to\r\nToro, and had directed him to close in towards the east, and to\r\noccupy Medina del Campo, as the strategical point that must be held\r\nin order to maintain touch with Madrid. Thus it chanced that on\r\nNovember 23 Labassée’s brigade and four regiments of cavalry, coming\r\nfrom Tordesillas, reached Medina del Campo just as Marcognet’s\r\nbrigade, returning from Segovia, came into the town from the other\r\nside. They had hardly met when the approach of Del Parque’s army\r\nalong the Salamanca road was reported. The two French brigadiers\r\nthought for a moment of fighting, and the cavalry was ordered to\r\npress back the Spanish advanced guard. They drove off with ease\r\nAnglona’s horsemen, who rode at the head of the long column, but\r\nwere repulsed by Ballasteros’s infantry, which formed square in good\r\nstyle, and drove them off with a rolling fire of musketry. Seeing\r\nthat the whole Spanish army was coming up, Marcognet and Labassée\r\nthen evacuated Medina del Campo, and retired to Valdestillas.\r\nWith one push more the Spaniards could have cut the line between\r\nValladolid and Madrid.\r\n\r\nOn November 24 the whole 6th Corps and Kellermann’s dragoons, with a\r\nbattalion or two from the garrisons of Old Castile, were concentrated\r\nat Puente de Duero, with their van at Valdestillas. If attacked, they\r\nmust have gone behind the Douro and abandoned all touch with Madrid;\r\nfor there were not more than 16,000 men in line, and they were forced\r\nto take the defensive. But, to their surprise, Del Parque made no\r\nadvance. He had heard on that morning of the disaster of Ocaña, and\r\nguessed that reinforcements for Kellermann must already be on the\r\nmarch. Wherefore he resolved to regain the mountains without delay,\r\nand to give up Salamanca and his other conquests. With this prudent\r\nresolve he broke up from Medina del Campo, and marched hastily away\r\nin retreat, making, not for Salamanca, which was too much in the\r\nplains to please him, but for Alba de Tormes. He had gained a day’s\r\nstart by his prompt action, but on the twenty-sixth Kellermann set\r\noff in pursuit, leaving orders for the troops that were expected from\r\nMadrid to follow him.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh the French cavalry failed\r\neven to get in touch with Del Parque’s rearguard, and found nothing\r\nbut a few stragglers on the road. But on the afternoon of the\r\ntwenty-eighth the leading squadrons reported that they had come upon\r\nthe whole Spanish army encamped in a mass around the town of Alba de\r\nTormes. The duke had flattered himself that he had shaken off his\r\npursuers, and was surprised in a most unfortunate position. Two of\r\nhis divisions (Ballasteros and Castrofuerte) were beyond the Tormes,\r\npreparing to bivouac on the upland above it. The other three were\r\nquartered in and about the town, while the cavalry was watching the\r\nroad, but had fallen in so close to the main body that its vedettes\r\ngave very short notice of the approach of the enemy. Kellermann was\r\nriding with the leading brigade of his cavalry--Lorcet’s _chasseurs_\r\nand hussars; the six regiments of dragoons were close behind him, so\r\nthat he had over 3,000 sabres in hand; but the infantry was ten miles\r\nto the rear. If he waited for it, Del Parque would have time to cross\r\nthe river and take up a defensive position behind it. The French\r\ngeneral, therefore, resolved to risk a most hazardous experiment,\r\nan attack with unsupported cavalry upon a force of all arms, in the\r\nhope of detaining it till the infantry should come up. The Spaniards\r\nwere getting into line of battle in a hurry, Losada’s division on the\r\nright, Belveder’s and La Carrera’s on the left, the cavalry--1,200\r\nsabres at most--in their front. The divisions beyond the river were\r\nonly beginning to assemble, and would take some time to recross the\r\nnarrow bridge: but 18,000 men were on the right bank prepared to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment’s delay Kellermann ordered Lorcet’s brigade to\r\ncharge the Spanish right and centre: it was followed by the six\r\nregiments of dragoons in three successive lines, and the whole mass\r\ncame down like a whirlwind upon Del Parque’s front, scattering his\r\ncavalry to the winds, and breaking the whole of Losada’s and the\r\nright of Belveder’s divisions. A battery of artillery, and nearly\r\n2,000 prisoners were taken. The wrecks of the broken divisions fell\r\nback into Alba de Tormes, and jammed the bridge, thus preventing the\r\ndivisions on the further side from recrossing it. Kellermann then\r\nrallied his squadrons, and led them against La Carrera’s division and\r\nthe remaining battalions of that of Belveder. These troops, formed in\r\nbrigade-squares upon a rising ground, held out gallantly and repulsed\r\nthe charge. But they were cut off from the bridge, which they could\r\nonly reach by a dangerous flank movement over rough ground. By\r\ncontinually threatening to repeat his attacks, Kellermann kept them\r\nfrom moving off, till, two hours and a half after the action had\r\nbegun, the French infantry and guns commenced to come up. La Carrera\r\nsaw that it would be fatal to await them, and bade his division\r\nretreat and reach the bridge as best it could. This was naturally\r\ndone in disorder, and with some loss; but it was already growing\r\ndusk, and the bulk of the Spanish left got away.\r\n\r\nWhile the Spaniards were defiling over the bridge, Marchand’s leading\r\nbrigade attacked Alba, out of which it drove some rallied troops of\r\nLosada’s division, who held the town to cover La Carrera’s retreat.\r\nThis was done with ease, for Del Parque had not brought over his two\r\nintact divisions, preferring to use them as a second line behind\r\nwhich the others could retire. Alba was stormed, and two guns, which\r\nhad been placed behind a barricade at its main exit, were taken by\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\nHere the fighting stopped: the Spaniards had lost five flags, nine\r\nguns, most of their baggage, and about 3,000 killed or taken--no\r\nvery ruinous deductions from an army of 32,000 men. The French\r\ncasualties were less than 300 in all[105]. Del Parque was determined\r\nnot to fight again next morning, and bade his army make off under\r\ncover of the night. The disorder that followed was frightful: the\r\nthree divisions that had been in the battle dispersed, and went\r\noff in all directions, some towards Ciudad Rodrigo, others towards\r\nTamames, others by the hill-road that leads towards Tala and the\r\nPass of Baños. Many of the raw Leonese troops, though they had not\r\nbeen engaged, also left their colours in the dark[106]. It was a\r\nfull month before Del Parque could collect his whole army, which,\r\nwhen it had been reorganized, was found to number 26,000 men,\r\ndespite all its misfortunes. It would seem, therefore, that beside\r\nthe losses in the battle some 3,000 men must have gone off to their\r\nhomes. The duke fixed his head quarters at San Martin de Trebejos\r\nin the Sierra de Gata, and dispersed his infantry in cantonments\r\nabout Bejar, Fuenteguinaldo, and Miranda de Castanar. Having only\r\nthe ruined region around Coria and Plasencia, and the small district\r\nabout Ciudad Rodrigo, to feed them, these troops suffered dreadful\r\nprivations during the winter, living on half-rations eked out with\r\nedible acorns. By the middle of January they had lost 9,000 men from\r\nfever, dysentery, and starvation.\r\n\r\n  [105] Martinien’s lists show 4 officers killed and 14 wounded.\r\n\r\n  [106] There is a long report by Del Parque in the Record\r\n  Office, in which he states that the panic was caused by a stray\r\n  party of his own routed cavalry dashing in among the rearguard\r\n  in the dark, and crying that the French were pursuing them.\r\n  He afterwards court-martialled and shot some cavalrymen for\r\n  cowardice.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, it is fair to say that Del Parque’s campaign\r\ncontrasts most favourably with that of Areizaga. He showed a laudable\r\nprudence when he twice evacuated Salamanca rather than fight a\r\nbattle in the plain. His victory of Tamames was most creditable,\r\nshowing that when prudently conducted, and ranged in a well-chosen\r\nhill-position, his army could give a good account of itself. But\r\nfor the disaster of Alba de Tormes his record might be considered\r\nexcellent. There, it is true, he committed a grave mistake, by\r\nseparating his army into two halves by the river when his enemy was\r\nin pursuit. But in his defence it may be urged that his cavalry\r\nought to have had vedettes out for ten or fifteen miles to the rear,\r\nand to have given him long warning of the approach of the French.\r\nAnd when the enemy’s horse did make its sudden appearance, it was\r\ncontrary to the laws of probability that it would attack at once,\r\nwithout waiting for its infantry and guns. Kellermann’s headlong\r\ncharge was a violation of all rules, a stroke of inspiration which\r\ncould not have been foreseen. If the Spanish cavalry had been of\r\nany use whatever, and if Losada’s division had only known how to\r\nform square in a hurry, it ought to have been beaten off. But the\r\nresisting-power of a Spanish army was always a doubtful quantity.\r\nKellermann resolved to take the risk of attacking, and was rewarded\r\nby a victory on which he was not entitled to reckon. He would\r\nprobably have justified his tactics by urging that failure could have\r\nno severe penalty, for the Spaniards could not pursue him if he were\r\nrepulsed, while success would bring splendid results. This was true:\r\nand if his infantry had been five miles more to the front, he might\r\nhave captured the whole of La Carrera’s division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF ANDALUSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF OCAÑA. DECEMBER 1809-JANUARY 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the disaster of Ocaña gave a death-blow to the Central\r\nJunta. Its attempt to win back its lost credit by an offensive\r\ncampaign against Madrid having ended in such a lamentable\r\nfashion, there was nothing left for it but to acquiesce in its\r\nown supersession by the oft-discussed national Cortes. But that\r\nassembly was not to meet till March 1, 1810--a date still four\r\nmonths in the future,--and even its form and constitution had not\r\nyet been settled. For it would have been absurd to have called it\r\ntogether in the ancient and unrepresentative shape,--a legacy from\r\nthe time of Charles V,--in which it had been wont to meet under the\r\nBourbon kings. Many regions had few or no members; decayed mediaeval\r\ntowns of Old Castile had more deputies than the most populous\r\nprovinces. Moreover, it had yet to be settled how that larger half\r\nof the realm which was now occupied by the French was to elect its\r\nrepresentatives. The commission was still sitting to determine these\r\nvital points, and in this moment of dismay the day of the assembly\r\nof the Cortes seemed very far distant. The French might be following\r\nhard on the heels of Areizaga’s broken host, and might enter Seville,\r\nlong before it had been decided what sort of a Cortes was to take\r\nover the power from the hands of the discredited Central Junta.\r\n\r\nThat most unhappy government, therefore, had to face both an acute\r\nconstitutional crisis and an acute military crisis. Something had\r\nto be done without delay to satisfy public opinion concerning the\r\nconvocation of the Cortes, or the revolution which had been checked\r\nby Wellesley’s aid in September would certainly burst forth again.\r\nBut even more pressing was the necessity for rallying and reinforcing\r\nthe army which had been crushed at Ocaña, before the French should\r\nresume their advance. The actual administrative power was for\r\nthe moment in the hand of the first of those temporary executive\r\ncommittees to which the Junta had agreed to delegate its authority by\r\nthe decree of September 19. This body, composed of six members, among\r\nwhom La Romana was numbered, had come into office on November 1. The\r\nrest of the Junta were only too eager to throw on their comrades the\r\nweight of the responsibility which should have fallen upon them all.\r\nThe executive committee was accused on all sides of slow and feeble\r\naction. It published, as soon as possible, the details concerning\r\nthe constitution of the forthcoming Cortes, which (in pursuance of\r\nthe recommendation of the commission of inquiry) was to consist\r\nof two classes of members, elected representatives who were to be\r\nallotted in due proportion to all the provinces of the realm, and\r\n‘privilegiados’ or chosen individuals from the nobility and the\r\nhigher clergy. The American colonies were to be given members no less\r\nthan the mother country, but their numbers were to be small. Such\r\nan arrangement seemed to foreshadow a double-chambered legislature,\r\nresembling that of Great Britain, and British precedents had no doubt\r\nbeen running in the minds of the framers of the constitution. But--as\r\nwe shall see--the Cortes, when it actually met, took no such shape.\r\nThe mandate for the election of the assembly was duly published;\r\nand so far public opinion was to a certain extent satisfied, for it\r\nwas clear that the Central Junta was at last about to abdicate. But\r\nthough the majority of the Spanish people were contented to wait,\r\nprovided that the executive committee should show signs of rising to\r\nthe occasion, and doing its best as an _interim_ government, there\r\nwere some politicians who saw in the crisis only an opportunity\r\nfor pushing their private ambitions. Those veteran intriguers, the\r\nConde de Montijo and Francisco Palafox, undismayed by the failure\r\nof the September plot, began to make arrangements with the Seville\r\ndemagogues for a fresh attempt at a _coup d’état_. Their plots seem\r\nto have distracted Romana and his colleagues from their obvious\r\nmilitary duties--the conspirator at home is always the enemy who\r\nlooms most large before the eyes of a weak government. But after some\r\nsearch both were discovered, arrested and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the executive committee, with the Junta’s approval, issued\r\na long series of edicts concerning the reorganization of the army,\r\nand the defence of Andalusia from the French attack, which might at\r\nany moment begin. The ‘Army of the Centre,’ of which Areizaga was\r\nstill, strange to say, left in command, was to be raised to 100,000\r\nmen by a strenuous conscription. The press was to be all-embracing,\r\nmarried men, novices in monasteries, persons in minor orders, only\r\nsons of widows, all the classes hitherto exempt, were to be subject\r\nto it. To provide funds the clergy were ordered to send in to the\r\nmint all church plate save such as was strictly necessary for the\r\ncelebration of the sacraments, and all private citizens were bidden\r\nto contribute one half of their table-silver. In order to provide\r\nteams for the artillery--which had lost nearly all its horses and\r\nguns at Ocaña--a strict requisition for draught animals was begun all\r\nover Andalusia. Engineers were sent out to fortify all the passes\r\nof the Sierra Morena, with permission to exact forced labour from\r\nthe peasantry of the hill country. Three members of the Junta--Rabe,\r\nRiquelme and Campo Sagrado--were sent to Areizaga’s head quarters at\r\nLa Carolina as ‘field deputies,’ to stir up or support the energy of\r\nthe commander-in-chief. This was a device borrowed from the practice\r\nof the French Revolution, and had no better effect than might have\r\nbeen expected. As in 1793, the ‘Representatives on Mission’ were\r\neither useless or positively harmful. They either wished to thrust\r\namateurish plans of their own upon the military men, or at least\r\ndistracted them by constant inquisitorial supervision.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the effect of this volley of violent decrees was small.\r\nWith six months to carry them out they might, no doubt, have produced\r\ngreat results. But within nine weeks after the disaster of Ocaña\r\nthe French had commenced their attack, and in that space of time\r\nlittle had been accomplished. The money was beginning to come in, the\r\nrecruits were being collected, but had not been armed or clothed,\r\nstill less drilled. Of the fortifications in the passes many had\r\nbeen sketched out, but only a few had begun to take tangible shape.\r\nTo man them there was still only the wrecks of Areizaga’s old army,\r\nwhich had hardly begun to receive its drafts of conscripts. Its\r\nwhole force at the New Year did not exceed 30,000 men, and these were\r\ndistributed over a front of more than 150 miles, for not only the\r\nmain group of passes in front of La Carolina had to be watched, but\r\nalso the eastern ingress into Andalusia by Baeza and Ubeda, and the\r\nwestern defiles from Almaden and Benalcazar, which lead directly down\r\non to Cordova. The whole country-side was in a state of desperate\r\nturmoil and excitement, yet very little in the way of practical\r\ndefence had been completed by the middle of January.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in accordance with the ridiculous constitution of the\r\n‘executive committee,’ half of its members went out of office at the\r\nNew Year, and were succeeded by other individuals of the Junta. Among\r\nthose superseded was La Romana, who was now directed to go off to\r\nValencia as captain-general. The Junta seems to have considered that\r\nhe would be less dangerous in company with his brother José Caro in\r\nthat province, than when posted at the seat of government, with his\r\nbrother to back him by threats of Valencian military interference.\r\nYet La Romana did not depart, and was still lingering at Seville when\r\nthe French crossed the Sierra Morena.\r\n\r\nThere was a larger military problem before the Junta and the new\r\n‘executive committee’ than the mere defence of Andalusia. The whole\r\narrangement of the national armies had to be recast in consequence of\r\nthe black day of Ocaña. The corps of Del Parque and Albuquerque, as\r\nwell as all the smaller outlying bodies of troops, had to receive new\r\norders. Above all it was necessary to discover what were the plans of\r\nWellington, for the present position of the British army at Badajoz\r\nwas the most important factor in the whole situation. As long as it\r\nremained there, in support of the small force under Albuquerque which\r\nwas guarding the passages of the Tagus at Almaraz and Arzobispo, the\r\nwestern section of the front of Andalusia was secure. The defence of\r\nthe eastern section, too, was in no small degree helped by the fact\r\nthat Wellington’s solid troops were in a position to march up the\r\nGuadiana, and to threaten the flank of any French army which might\r\nintend to attack the Despeña-Perros, or any other of the passes which\r\nlead from La Mancha down to the Andalusian plains.\r\n\r\nIt was a terribly disquieting fact for the Junta that, even before\r\nOcaña had been fought and lost, Wellington had begun to announce his\r\nintention of leaving Badajoz and retiring within the boundaries of\r\nPortugal. He had paid a flying visit to Seville on the 2nd-4th[107]\r\nof November, just as Areizaga’s unhappy advance into La Mancha\r\nwas commencing. The project had been concealed from him[108], and\r\nwhen he learnt of it he had expressed his entire disapprobation\r\nof it, and had refused to give any promise to support the Spanish\r\narmies in their offensive movements. For this reason he had been\r\nbitterly provoked when Areizaga and Albuquerque both wrote him, a\r\nlittle later, to say that they had been promised the assistance of\r\nhis army by the Junta[109]. He had consistently prophesied ill of\r\nthe adventure, and had recorded his opinion that both Del Parque\r\nand Areizaga would probably lose their armies. In a dispatch of\r\nNovember 20, six days before the news of Ocaña reached him, he\r\nhad announced his definite intention of leaving Badajoz with the\r\nmain body of his army, and transferring himself to the north of\r\nthe Tagus, where, by posting himself in the Portuguese province of\r\nBeira, he would cover the high-roads to Lisbon from Old Castile. This\r\ndecision was founded on his belief that when the French had made\r\nan end of Areizaga and Del Parque--a contingency which he regarded\r\nas almost certain[110]--they would strike at Lisbon and not at\r\nSeville. He had good reasons for holding this view; it was exactly\r\nconsonant with Napoleon’s own plan, which was only abandoned by\r\nreason of King Joseph’s pleadings with his brother. For, from the\r\nFrench standpoint, it was far more profitable to conquer Portugal\r\nand to expel the British army from the Peninsula, than to overrun\r\nAndalusia. Wellington and his troops formed the one solid nucleus of\r\nresistance which still remained; it was clear that the dispersion of\r\nthe miserable wrecks of Areizaga’s host would present no difficulty.\r\nAnd not only was it advisable, from the Emperor’s point of view,\r\nto destroy the most formidable hostile force still surviving, but\r\nthe balance of strategical advantage was all in favour of subduing\r\nPortugal, before Andalusia should be invaded. For Portugal flanks\r\nthe attack on southern Spain, and a good army based upon it could\r\ncheck the advance on Seville and Cadiz by demonstrations aimed at\r\nValladolid or Madrid, which might wreck or delay the conquest of\r\nAndalusia. It may be objected that Andalusia also flanks the attack\r\non Portugal; but the objection had no validity since the day of\r\nOcaña, as the Junta had now no longer any striking force in hand. It\r\nwould be many months before Areizaga’s host was in a proper condition\r\nfor undertaking even cautious defensive operations. A French attack\r\non Portugal, therefore, would be practically unmolested by external\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n  [107] He then pushed on to Cadiz, where he was on the 6th-7th,\r\n  spent a night at Seville again on the 9th-10th, and was back at\r\n  Badajoz on the 11th of November. At Cadiz he parted with his\r\n  brother, who was just embarking for England, to take up his place\r\n  in the new Ministry.\r\n\r\n  [108] As late as Oct. 28 he had written to Colonel Roche, the\r\n  British officer attached to the staff of the Army of the Centre,\r\n  to beg him to press on the newly-arrived Areizaga the necessity\r\n  of adopting a defensive posture, and risking nothing. From the\r\n  wording of the letter it is clear that no hint of the orders\r\n  sent to Areizaga from Seville had reached Badajoz. _Wellington\r\n  Dispatches_, v. 248-9, see also the dispatch to Castlereagh on p.\r\n  267.\r\n\r\n  [109] See Wellington to Roche, and to B. Frère, Badajoz, Nov. 19.\r\n  _Dispatches_, v. 292-3 and 294.\r\n\r\n  [110] ‘Nothing can save them save a victory by Areizaga, and\r\n  the possession of Madrid, _which are the most improbable of\r\n  events_.... If Del Parque and Albuquerque are destroyed, _which\r\n  is not unlikely, indeed pretty certain_ ... we must make our\r\n  arrangements for the defence of Portugal.’ Wellington to\r\n  Beresford, Nov. 20, 1809.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the strength of the French troops in Spain was\r\nnot sufficient to provide two armies for offensive purposes, the one\r\ndestined to march on Seville, the other on Lisbon. The numbers at the\r\nfront had not appreciably increased since the autumn, though already\r\nthe reinforcements which the Emperor had set upon the march, after\r\nconcluding his peace with Austria, had begun to appear at Bayonne,\r\nand to cross the Bidassoa. But in December and January the roads were\r\nbad, the days short, and provisions hard to procure. Hence Wellington\r\nreckoned that, till the spring should arrive, the allies would have\r\nto face no more than the forces which were already opposed to them.\r\nWhen, however, the campaigning season should have come round, and the\r\nreinforcements from Germany should have been incorporated with the\r\nold Army of Spain, he thought that Portugal would be the enemy’s main\r\nobjective. It was therefore his intention to withdraw his army, or\r\nat least the greater part of it, from Spanish Estremadura, and to\r\narrange it so as to cover Lisbon, even though by making this movement\r\nhe was weakening the left flank of the defence of Andalusia. If he\r\nhad to choose between the interests of Portugal and those of Spain,\r\nhe was prepared to sacrifice the latter. His reasons were simple: (1)\r\nhe considered Portugal more important in the grand strategy of the\r\ndefence of the Peninsula than Andalusia; (2) he regarded it as more\r\ndefensible, and he had already--as we shall presently see--sketched\r\nout and commenced the construction of his great lines of Torres\r\nVedras, in which his trust as a final impregnable stronghold was\r\nalready fixed; (3) he held that although Great Britain was pledged\r\nto assist both Spain and Portugal, yet her moral obligation to the\r\nlatter was far more binding, since Portugal had placed herself\r\nentirely in the hands of her allies, had put her army at their\r\ndisposal, and had contributed all her resources to the common cause,\r\nwhile the Spanish Junta had shown a jealous and suspicious spirit,\r\nhad refused to show confidence in Great Britain, and had persisted in\r\ncarrying out a military policy of its own, which led to a consistent\r\nseries of disasters; (4) the Portuguese army, though its fighting\r\npower was not as yet ascertained, could be at least relied upon for\r\nobedience; experience had shown that the promises of the Spaniards\r\ncould not be trusted, and that any campaign undertaken in their\r\ncompany might be wrecked by some incalculable piece of slackness or\r\nmiscalculation[111].\r\n\r\n  [111] Wellington’s arguments must be culled from his various\r\n  dispatches to Lord Liverpool and other ministers in November\r\n  and December 1809. For the first of the motives quoted above\r\n  see Wellington to Liverpool Dec. 9. ‘The object in occupying\r\n  this proposed position [in Beira] is to be at the point of the\r\n  defence of Portugal, to divert the attention of the French from\r\n  the South of Spain, when they shall receive their reinforcements,\r\n  and thus to give time to the Spanish Government to repair\r\n  their losses.... It is absolutely necessary to cross the Tagus\r\n  immediately, as it may be depended upon that the enemy’s first\r\n  effort, after receiving his reinforcements, will be upon the\r\n  troops to the North of the Tagus.’ Very much the same opinion is\r\n  expressed in the earlier dispatch to Lord Liverpool of November\r\n  14. Expressions of Wellington’s conviction that it was impossible\r\n  to co-operate with the Junta or the Spanish generals may be found\r\n  _passim_ in all his confidential letters. See for example that to\r\n  Sir J. Anstruther, pp. 386-8 of _Supplementary Dispatches_, vol.\r\n  vi.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on November 20 Wellington declared his intention of\r\nwithdrawing his army--save one single division--to the north of the\r\nTagus, and of placing it at various points in the province of Beira,\r\nso as to cover all the practicable roads to Lisbon from the side\r\nof Old Castile. On the twenty-sixth he sent formal notice of his\r\nintentions to Seville, well knowing the storm of indignation that\r\nwould be roused thereby. At the same time he advised the Junta to\r\nreinforce Albuquerque’s army of Estremadura with troops drawn from\r\nDel Parque, adding that to keep Albuquerque well to the front, in his\r\npresent positions at Almaraz and Arzobispo, was the best means of\r\nprotecting the western approaches of Andalusia. Del Parque’s corps,\r\nwhose reason for existence was the ‘containing’ of the French troops\r\nin Old Castile, would be able to spare troops to strengthen the\r\narmy of Estremadura, because the English host, in its new position,\r\nwould be behind it, and opposed to the forces under Kellermann and\r\nMarchand, which had hitherto had nothing in their front but the ‘Army\r\nof the Left.’ Moreover, it would be an appreciable relief to Del\r\nParque, who was finding the greatest difficulty in feeding his army\r\nin the thinly-peopled mountain region between Ciudad Rodrigo and\r\nBejar, to be freed from the burden of maintaining one or two of his\r\nfive divisions.\r\n\r\nThe Junta, as might have been expected, took Wellington’s\r\ndetermination to remove from Badajoz with the worst of graces. They\r\ncould hardly have failed to do so, when one of his main reasons for\r\ndeparting, barely concealed in his dispatches to them, was his fear\r\nof getting involved in their operations, and his reluctance to place\r\nhis troops in line with the Spanish armies. Nor could they have\r\nbeen expected to agree with his strategical view that Lisbon, not\r\nCadiz, would be the main objective of the grand advance of the French\r\narmies, when the spring should come round. To every man or body of\r\nmen their own possible dangers naturally seem more imminent and more\r\ninteresting than those of their neighbours. The departure of the\r\nEnglish from Badajoz was formally announced to the Junta on November\r\n26, and began to be carried out on December 8, when the brigade of\r\nGuards marched for Portalegre, and was followed on successive days by\r\nthe other brigades of the army. By the 24th of December Wellington\r\nand his staff alone were left in the Estremaduran fortress, and next\r\nday his head quarters were at Elvas, across the frontier. The second\r\ndivision, under Hill, halted at Abrantes, where Wellington intended\r\nto leave it, as the nucleus of a covering force which was to guard\r\nLisbon from any possible attack from the south side of the Tagus. The\r\nrest of the army pursued its way across the mountains of Beira, and\r\nby January 3, 1810, head quarters were at Coimbra, and the main body\r\nof the British troops was beginning to take up billets in the small\r\ntowns of the valley of the Mondego.\r\n\r\nConvinced that no more was to be hoped from Wellington, the Executive\r\nCommittee issued their orders for a new arrangement of the line of\r\ndefence of Andalusia. Albuquerque was ordered to leave no more than\r\na small corps of observation on the Tagus, in front of Almaraz,\r\nand to bring back the main body of the army of Estremadura to the\r\nline of the Guadiana, in order to link his right wing to the left\r\nof Areizaga’s forces. On December 24 his new head quarters were\r\nat Don Benito, and he had some 8,000 men collected there and at\r\nthe neighbouring town of Merida; the rest of his small army was\r\nfurnishing the garrison of Badajoz, and the detached force on the\r\nTagus, whose duty was to watch the movements of the French 2nd Corps,\r\nwhich still lay in its old post at Talavera, and remained entirely\r\nquiescent.\r\n\r\nFrom Albuquerque’s post at Don Benito there was a gap of seventy-five\r\nmiles to the next force in the Spanish line. This consisted of the\r\nwrecks of the two old divisions of Copons and Zerain from the army\r\nof Areizaga, not more than 4,500 strong[112]. They were encamped at\r\nPozo Blanco and at Almaden, the mining town on the Alcudia, where the\r\nfrontiers of Estremadura, Andalusia, and La Mancha meet. This place\r\nlies near the northern exit of the two passes, the Puerto Blanco and\r\nPuerto Rubio which lead down from La Mancha on to Cordova, the one\r\nby Villaharta, the other by Villanueva de la Jara and Adamuz. Both\r\nare difficult, both pass through a desolate and uninhabited country,\r\nbut either of them might conceivably serve for the passage of an\r\narmy. Sixty miles east of Almaden was the main body of the rallied\r\nArmy of the Centre, occupying the group of passes which lie around\r\nthe high-road from Madrid to Andalusia. Head quarters were at La\r\nCarolina, the central point upon which the routes from most of these\r\npasses converge. About 13,000 men were disposed in front, covering\r\nthe main _chaussée_ through the Despeña-Perros, and the side defiles\r\nof the Puerto del Rey and the Puerto del Muradal. Here Areizaga had\r\nconcentrated the remains of the divisions of Zayas, Castejon, Giron\r\nand Lacy, of which the last two were mere wrecks, while the two\r\nformer counted about 4,000 bayonets apiece. Finally, some fifteen\r\nmiles off to the right, the remnants of the divisions of Vigodet and\r\nJacomé, perhaps 6,000 men in all, covered the two easternmost passes\r\nfrom La Mancha, those of Aldea Quemada and Villa Manrique, which\r\ndescend not upon La Carolina, but on Ubeda and Linares, the towns at\r\nthe headwaters of the Guadalquivir in the extreme north-eastern angle\r\nof the Andalusian plain. Areizaga’s artillery was all in the passes,\r\nplaced in the various new entrenchments which were being thrown up.\r\nHis cavalry had for the most part been sent back to recruit and\r\nreform itself in the interior of the province, being useless in the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n  [112] The papers in the Madrid archives show that Copons had\r\n  about 3,000 men, Zerain (whose division had been almost entirely\r\n  destroyed) about 1,500.\r\n\r\nThe mere description of this disposition of forces is sufficient to\r\nshow the hopeless condition of the defence of Andalusia. Areizaga\r\nwas trying to cover every possible line by which the French might\r\nadvance, with the result that his army and that of Albuquerque were\r\nstrung out on a front of 150 miles, and could not concentrate 15,000\r\nmen on any single point. The passes which they were trying to guard\r\nwere not only numerous, but in several cases very practicable,\r\nwhere roads lay not between cliffs or precipices, but over slopes\r\nwhich could be ascended by infantry on each side of the pass. The\r\nfortifications and the troops holding them could be turned by enemies\r\nwho took the trouble to climb the side acclivities. It was clear that\r\nif the French chose to attack the Sierra Morena with no more than the\r\n60,000 men who had been concentrated after the battle of Ocaña, they\r\ncould bring an overwhelming force to bear on any one or two of the\r\npasses which they might select, while leaving the garrisons of the\r\nrest alone, or threatening them with trifling demonstrations. If\r\nthe enemy should choose to strike by Almaden at Cordova, the Spanish\r\ncentre and right wing would be cut off from their retreat on Seville,\r\nand would have to take refuge in the kingdom of Murcia. If the\r\nDespeña-Perros and its neighbours should turn out to be the selected\r\nobjective, Areizaga’s right wing must suffer the same fate. And, if\r\ndriven from the passes, the army would have to encounter, in the\r\nbroad plain behind, the overpowering force of French cavalry which\r\nKing Joseph could bring up. The problem set before the defence was\r\na hopeless one, and most of the generals under Areizaga were aware\r\nof the fact--as indeed were the rank and file. Disaster was bound to\r\nfollow if the enemy managed his business with ordinary prudence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Spanish Infantry 1808_\r\n  (_Showing the old Bourbon uniform_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF ANDALUSIA. KING JOSEPH AND HIS PLANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen considering the action of the French after the victory of\r\nOcaña, it is necessary to remember that King Joseph and Soult were\r\nnot in the position of ordinary invaders, who have just succeeded in\r\ndemolishing the last army of their enemy. In wars of a normal type\r\nthe victor knows that the vanquished will sue for terms when further\r\nresistance appears hopeless; he proceeds to dictate the cessions of\r\nterritory or payments of indemnities that he thinks proper, as the\r\nprice of peace. But it was not a profitable treaty which Napoleon\r\ndesired: he had put it out of his own power to end the war in such a\r\nfashion, when he declared his brother King of Spain. For him there\r\nwas no Spanish government in existence save that which he had set up\r\nat Madrid: the Central Junta, and the Cortes when it should meet,\r\nwere mere illegal assemblies, with which he could not deign to enter\r\ninto negotiations. It was now perfectly clear that the Spaniards\r\nwould never submit of their own accord. Their position in December\r\n1809, desperate as it might be, was no worse than it had been in the\r\nMarch of the same year. Areizaga’s army had suffered no more at Ocaña\r\nthan had those of Cuesta and Cartaojal nine months before, on the\r\ndisastrous fields of Medellin and Ciudad Real. Indeed, there were\r\nprobably more men actually in line to defend Andalusia in December\r\nthan there had been in April. Moreover, in the early spring Soult had\r\nbeen in the full career of conquest in Portugal, and nothing save\r\nCradock’s insignificant force appeared to prevent his onward march\r\nto Lisbon. At mid-winter, on the other hand, the flank of Andalusia\r\nwas covered by Wellington’s victorious army, and by the reorganized\r\nPortuguese host of Beresford. If the Junta had refused to listen to\r\nthe insidious advances of Sotelo in April[113], there was no reason\r\nto suppose that it would lend a ready ear to any similar advocate of\r\nsubmission in December. Indeed, its every action showed a resolve to\r\nfight out the losing game to the end.\r\n\r\n  [113] See vol. ii. pp. 168-9.\r\n\r\nJoseph Bonaparte would never be King of Spain till every province was\r\nheld down by French bayonets. Not only must each corner of the land\r\nbe conquered, but after conquest it must be garrisoned. For, where\r\nthere was no garrison, insurrection burst out at once, and the weary\r\nprocess of pacification had to be repeated.\r\n\r\nIt was this last fact that restrained King Joseph from following up\r\nhis pursuit of the wrecks of the Spanish army to the Sierra Morena,\r\nand the gates of Seville, on the morning after Ocaña. To make up\r\nthe host that had defeated Areizaga, and the other smaller force\r\nthat was dealing with Del Parque in Leon, the King had been forced\r\nto concentrate all his divisions, and the consequence had been that\r\nthe control of the broad tracts behind him had been lost. We have\r\nalready had occasion to mention[114] that throughout Old Castile and\r\nLeon, the open country was now in the hands of the guerrilleros,\r\nwho had been growing in force and numbers ever since the time of\r\nTalavera, and had risen to the height of their confidence after the\r\nday of Tamames, and Del Parque’s repeated occupation of Salamanca.\r\nNavarre, and many parts of New Castile were equally disturbed, and\r\nAragon, which Suchet had tamed during the autumn, was beginning\r\nonce more to move. There were no French troops in the disturbed\r\nregions save scanty garrisons at Burgos, Valladolid, Benavente,\r\nAvila, Segovia, Guadalajara, Palencia, Tudela, Tafalla, and a few\r\nother strategic points. These were cut off from each other, and from\r\nMadrid, save when a governor sent out his messenger with an escort\r\nmany hundreds strong, and even such a force had often to fight its\r\nway through half a dozen bands before reaching its destination. The\r\ngarrisons themselves were not always safe: so powerful were the\r\nbands of some of the guerrillero chiefs that they aspired to waging\r\nregular war, and did not confine themselves to blocking the roads, or\r\nintercepting couriers and convoys. The Empecinado, whose sphere of\r\nactivity lay on the borders of Old and New Castile, got possession\r\nof Guadalajara for a day, though he retired when reinforcements\r\nfrom Madrid were reported to be approaching. Somewhat later, the\r\nyounger Mina--‘the Student,’ as he was called to distinguish him\r\nfrom his more celebrated uncle Espoz, stormed the town of Tafalla,\r\nand shut up the remains of its garrison in its castle, while the\r\nflying-columns of the governor of Navarre were seeking him in every\r\nother direction. He too, like the Empecinado, had to seek safety in\r\nretreat and dispersion, when his exploit drew in upon him forces sent\r\nfrom Suchet’s army of Aragon.\r\n\r\n  [114] See page 83.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the guerrilleros did not merely constitute a military\r\ndanger for King Joseph. It affected him in another, and an equally\r\nvexatious, fashion, by cutting off nearly all his sources of revenue.\r\nWhile the open country was in the hands of the insurgents, he could\r\nraise neither imposts nor requisitions from it. The only regular\r\nincome that he could procure during the later months of 1809 was\r\nthat which came in from the local taxes of Madrid, and the few other\r\nlarge towns of which he was in secure possession. And save in the\r\ncapital itself, his agents and intendants had to fight hard with the\r\nmilitary governors to secure even this meagre pittance[115]. The\r\nKing could not command a quarter of the sum which he required to pay\r\nthe ordinary expenses of government. His courtiers and ministers,\r\nFrench and Spanish, failed to receive their salaries, and the Spanish\r\narmy, which he was busily striving to form, could not be clothed\r\nor armed, much less paid. Nothing vexed Joseph more than this: he\r\nwished to make himself independent of his brother’s generals, by\r\nraising a large force of his own, which should be at his personal\r\ndisposition. He formed the _cadre_ of regiment after regiment, and\r\nfilled them with deserters from the foreign troops of the Junta, and\r\nwith any prisoners who could be induced to enlist under his banners\r\nin order to avoid transportation to France. But the recruits, when\r\nsent to join the new regiments, disappeared for the most part within\r\na few weeks. Joseph thought that it was from lack of pay and proper\r\nsustenance, and raged at the idea that, but for the want of money,\r\nhe might have at his disposition a formidable army of his own. But he\r\ndeceived himself: the ‘juramentados’ had for the most part no desire\r\nsave to desert and rejoin their old colours: the real renegades were\r\nfew. In the ranks of the Junta’s army the soldier was even worse\r\nclothed, fed, and paid than in that of Joseph. No amount of pampering\r\nwould have turned the King’s Spanish levies into loyal servants.\r\n\r\n  [115] For a typical example of the relations of French governors\r\n  and the King’s officials see Thiébault’s account of his quarrel\r\n  with Amoros in his autobiography, iv. 350-5. Cf. Miot de Melito,\r\n  chapters xi-xii of vol. ii.\r\n\r\nPending the reduction to order of the country-side of the two\r\nCastiles, which he vainly hoped to see accomplished during the next\r\nsix months, Joseph found only one expedient for raising money. It was\r\na ruinous one, and could not be repeated. This was the confiscation\r\nof property belonging to all persons who were in the service of\r\nthe Junta, and of all the religious orders. This would have given\r\nhim vast sums, if only he could have found buyers. But it was not\r\neasy to persuade any one to pay ready cash for lands overrun by\r\nthe guerrilleros, or for houses in towns which were practically in\r\na state of siege, and were also subject to a grinding taxation.\r\nProperty of immense value had to be alienated for wholly inadequate\r\nsums. The _afrancesados_, whom Joseph was most anxious to conciliate,\r\ngot such payment as he could afford, mainly in the form of vain\r\ngrants of property which they could not turn to account. The only\r\nready money which was in circulation was that which came from the\r\ncoining down, at the Madrid mint, of the considerable amount of\r\nplate belonging to the monasteries and the churches on which the\r\nKing had laid hands. Naturally, he was regarded as a sacrilegious\r\nrobber by his unwilling subjects--though few, or none, murmured when\r\nthe Central Junta filled its exchequer by similar expedients. But\r\nthe Junta had not decreed the abolition of the religious orders--it\r\nonly purported to be raising a patriotic loan from their resources.\r\nA minister of Joseph sums up the situation sufficiently well in\r\nthree sentences. ‘Spanish public opinion was inexorable: it rejected\r\neverything coming from us--even benefits: thus the King and his\r\ncouncillors spent themselves in fruitless labours. Nothing answered\r\ntheir expectations, and the void in the Treasury, the worst danger,\r\nshowed no sign of diminution. On the contrary, the financial distress\r\nincreased every day, and the unpleasant means which we were compelled\r\nto employ in order to supply the never-ceasing wants of the army\r\ncompletely alienated the nation from us[116].’\r\n\r\n  [116] Miot de Melito, ii. p. 351.\r\n\r\nThe orders issued by the King and Soult after the battle of Ocaña,\r\nshow that they had no immediate intention of pursuing Areizaga’s\r\nrouted host, and entering Andalusia at its heels--tempting though\r\nsuch a policy might be from the purely military point of view. After\r\nVictor and the 1st Corps had joined him, on the day following the\r\nbattle, Joseph had nearly 60,000 men in hand. But his first move was\r\nto disperse this formidable army: Gazan’s division of Mortier’s corps\r\nwas at once hurried off towards the north, to reinforce Kellermann in\r\nLeon--for the battle of Alba de Tormes had not yet taken place, and\r\nit was thought that the 6th Corps needed prompt assistance. Laval’s\r\ndivision of Sebastiani’s corps was detached in another direction,\r\nbeing told off to escort to Madrid, and afterwards to Burgos and\r\nVittoria, the vast mass of prisoners taken at Ocaña. Milhaud, with\r\nhis own dragoons, and an infantry brigade taken from Sebastiani’s\r\ncorps, was directed to push eastwards by way of Tarancon, and then\r\nto march on Cuenca, where it was reported that many of the fugitives\r\nfrom Areizaga’s army had rallied. The brigade of Dessolles’ division\r\nwhich had been present at Ocaña and Joseph’s own troops returned to\r\nMadrid, in company with their master. When the capital was again\r\nadequately garrisoned, numerous flying-columns were sent out from\r\nit, to clear the roads, and disperse the guerrilleros. Mortier, with\r\nthat part of the 5th Corps which had not been detached under Gazan,\r\nwas drawn back to Toledo. Thus of all the troops which had been\r\nconcentrated on November 20th, only Victor’s corps and the Polish\r\ndivision, with the cavalry brigade of the 4th Corps, were retained in\r\nLa Mancha, facing the Sierra Morena. The 1st Corps was pushed forward\r\nto Ciudad Real and its neighbourhood, with its advanced cavalry\r\nwatching the passes. The Poles remained at Ocaña and La Guardia,\r\nwith Perreymond’s three regiments of light horse in front of them at\r\nMadridejos[117].\r\n\r\n  [117] For all these details see Soult’s dispatches to the\r\n  Minister of War at Paris, dated Nov. 21 and Nov. 24, from\r\n  Aranjuez and Madrid. Perreymond had received the cavalry brigade\r\n  of the 4th Corps when Paris fell in action.\r\n\r\nIn the dispatch which detailed to the Minister of War at Paris this\r\ndisposition of the army, Soult explained his reasons for holding\r\nback. It was a more pressing necessity to restore order in the\r\nprovinces of the interior than to pursue the wrecks of Areizaga’s\r\nforce, which was so completely dispersed that no further danger\r\nneed be feared from it. Before undertaking any large general scheme\r\nof operation, the King thought it best to consult his imperial\r\nbrother as to his wishes. It was rumoured that Napoleon himself\r\nmight appear on the scene within a few weeks, and it was certain\r\nthat the first columns of reinforcements from Germany, which might\r\nprove to be the heralds of his approach, were just about to cross\r\nthe Bidassoa. Moreover, it would be prudent to discover what had\r\nbecome of Albuquerque and of the English, before any great move to\r\nthe southward was made, as also to make an end of the army of Del\r\nParque, by means of the reinforcements which had just been sent to\r\nKellermann[118].\r\n\r\n  [118] Soult to Clarke, Nov. 21: ‘Sa Majesté a pensé qu’il était\r\n  inutile qu’elle s’engageât vers la Sierra Morena, à la poursuite\r\n  des débris de l’armée de la Manche, qu’on ne pourra plus joindre,\r\n  et qui se sauvent individuellement sur toutes les directions,\r\n  d’autant plus que tout porte à croire qu’il y aura encore des\r\n  mouvements sur la droite, et qu’il convient de se mettre en\r\n  mesure de repousser les nouveaux corps [Albuquerque, Del Parque,\r\n  and the English] qui pourraient se présenter pour la forcer. Il\r\n  est aussi pressant de prendre des dispositions pour rétablir\r\n  l’ordre et la tranquillité dans les provinces de l’intérieur, et\r\n  pour assurer la liberté des communications. Après la bataille\r\n  d’Ocaña le roi a aussi en vue de se mettre en mesure d’attendre\r\n  que Sa Majesté L’Empereur ait jugé à propos de faire connaître\r\n  ses intentions sur les opérations ultérieures qui devront être\r\n  faites.’ The entirely false supposition that Albuquerque and the\r\n  English were on the move was, as Soult afterwards explained, due\r\n  to a dispatch received from Heudelet at Talavera, who sent in an\r\n  alarming report that Wellington was expected at Truxillo in a few\r\n  days. As to the idea that Del Parque might join Albuquerque, the\r\n  Junta had actually given him an order to do so (see page 97), but\r\n  he had ignored it, and marched on Salamanca.\r\n\r\nWithin three weeks the situation had changed, and many of the reasons\r\nwhich had induced the King and Soult to adopt a waiting policy had\r\ndisappeared. On November 28th, as we have already seen, Kellermann\r\nrouted Del Parque at Alba de Tormes, though he had not yet received\r\nthe succours which Gazan was bringing up to his aid. The Army of the\r\nLeft being no longer a source of danger, Kellermann not only sent\r\norders to Gazan--who had reached Segovia--to return to New Castile,\r\nsince he was no longer wanted in the North, but presently sent back\r\nto the King Rey’s brigade of Dessolles’ division which had been lent\r\nhim early in November. Thus 10,000 men who had been detached came\r\nback under the King’s control[119], and were once more available for\r\noffensive operations.\r\n\r\n  [119] At the New Year Gazan had 6,600 men present with the\r\n  eagles, Rey 4,100. See Tables at the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nStill more important was the fact that in the first days of December\r\nthe reinforcements from Germany had at last begun to cross the\r\nPyrenees, and were arriving in Navarre and Biscay in enormous\r\nnumbers. Two strong divisions, commanded by Loison and Reynier and\r\ncounting more than 20,000 bayonets, had already appeared, and the\r\nhead of the interminable column which followed them had reached\r\nBayonne. It was certain that at least 90,000 men were on the march,\r\nto fill up the void in Old Castile which had been causing the King\r\nand Soult so much trouble. The roads would soon be cleared, the\r\nisolated garrisons relieved, and the communications with Madrid\r\nmade safe. The newly arrived generals had received orders to sweep\r\nevery valley on their southward march, and to disperse every band\r\nof guerrilleros[120]. Another possible source of danger, which had\r\npreoccupied the minds of Joseph and his Major-general after Ocaña,\r\nhad also been removed. The English had made no forward movement\r\ntowards the Tagus; they were reported to be still quiescent at\r\nBadajoz, and rumours (which afterwards turned out to be correct)\r\nhad already reached the French head quarters, to the effect that\r\nWellington was just about to retire into Portugal. Moreover,\r\nMilhaud’s expedition to Tarancon and Cuenca, and the excursions of\r\nthe flying-columns sent out from Madrid, had all proved successful.\r\nThe insurgents had been dispersed with ease, wherever they had been\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\n  [120] See Orders for Loison (in Napoleon to Berthier of Dec.\r\n  9), and for Reynier (in Napoleon to Berthier, Dec. 14), in the\r\n  _Correspondance_. Reynier was superseded by Lagrange, and sent to\r\n  command the 2nd Corps a little later.\r\n\r\nOf all the reasons for delay which were valid on November 20th there\r\nwas now none left unremoved save the most important of all. The\r\nEmperor had not yet made his intentions known; though pressed to\r\ndeclare his will by every letter sent by his brother or by Soult,\r\nhe gave no answer as to a general plan of campaign. Several of his\r\ndispatches had reached Madrid: they were full of details as to the\r\ntroops which he was sending across the Pyrenees, they contained some\r\nadvice as to finance, and some rebukes for the King concerning petty\r\nmatters of administration[121], but there was no permission, still\r\nless any order, to invade Andalusia or Portugal; nor did Napoleon\r\ndeign to state that he was, or was not, coming to Spain in person.\r\nIt was only when Joseph received the first dispatch opening up the\r\nmatter of the divorce of Josephine[122], that he was able to guess\r\nthat, with such an affair on hand, his brother would not set out for\r\nthe Peninsula during the winter or the early spring.\r\n\r\n  [121] The Emperor scolds his brother for not sending to Paris the\r\n  flags taken at Ocaña, and for calling Sebastiani’s 3rd Division\r\n  ‘the Polish division’ instead of ‘the division of the Grand Duchy\r\n  of Warsaw!’\r\n\r\n  [122] In a dispatch dated from the Trianon on Dec. 17.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of December Joseph had made up his mind that it would\r\nbe politic to attack Andalusia without delay. He had won over Soult\r\nto his ideas--the Marshal having now abandoned the plan, which he had\r\nurged so strongly in the autumn, that Lisbon not Seville should be\r\nthe objective of the next French advance. It is easy to understand\r\nthe King’s point of view--he wished rather to complete the conquest\r\nof his own realm, by subduing its wealthiest and most populous\r\nprovince, than to do his brother’s work in Portugal, where he had\r\nno personal interest. It is less obvious why Soult concurred with\r\nhim--as a great strategist he should have envisaged the situation\r\nfrom the military rather than the political point of view. Apparently\r\nJoseph had won him over by giving him all that he asked, and treating\r\nhim with effusive courtesy: their old quarrels of the preceding\r\nsummer had been entirely forgotten. At any rate Soult had now become\r\nthe ardent advocate of the invasion of Andalusia, though--as his\r\npredecessor Jourdan tersely puts it--‘the English army being now the\r\nonly organized force in a state to face the imperial troops, and its\r\npresence in the Peninsula being the thing that sustained the Spanish\r\ngovernment and gave confidence to the Spanish people, I imagine that\r\nwe ought to have set ourselves to destroy that army, rather than to\r\nhave disseminated our troops in garrisoning the whole surface of\r\nSpain[123].’ The same thought was in the Emperor’s mind when he wrote\r\nin January--too late to stop the Andalusian expedition--that ‘the\r\nonly danger in Spain is the English army; the rest are partisans who\r\ncan never hold the field against us[124].’\r\n\r\n  [123] Jourdan, _Mémoires_, p. 294.\r\n\r\n  [124] Napoleon to Berthier, Jan. 31, 1810--giving directions\r\n  which could not be carried out, because the invasion of Andalusia\r\n  had begun ten days before the dispatch had been written.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of December, 1809, Soult at last made a formal appeal,\r\nin a dispatch to Berthier, for leave to commence the march on\r\nSeville. ‘At no time since the Spanish War began,’ he wrote, ‘have\r\ncircumstances been so favourable for invading Andalusia, and it\r\nis probable that such a movement would have the most advantageous\r\nresults. I have already informed your Excellency that preparations\r\nwould be made for this movement, while we waited for his Majesty to\r\ndeign to make known to us his supreme will.’ Soult adds that if only\r\nLoison’s division of the reinforcements may be brought up to Burgos,\r\nand a second division sent to Saragossa, in order to free Suchet for\r\nfield service, the invasion can be begun, as soon as the army in New\r\nCastile has completed its equipment and received its drafts.\r\n\r\nNo direct reply was received to this dispatch, nor to several\r\nsubsequent communications, in which Soult and Joseph set forth the\r\narrangements which they were making, always subject to the Imperial\r\napproval, for concentrating an army for the Andalusian expedition.\r\nStrange as it may appear, it was only in a letter written on January\r\n31, 1810, when the King had already crossed the Sierra Morena, that\r\nNapoleon vouchsafed a word concerning the all-important problem[125].\r\nIt is clear that he had ample time to have stopped it, if such\r\nhad been his will; the ultimate responsibility, therefore, lay\r\nwith him. But he refrained from ordering it, or from approving it,\r\nthus reserving to himself all the possibilities of _ex-post-facto_\r\ncriticism. Since no prohibition came, Joseph made up his mind to\r\nstrike; it was natural that he should be fascinated by the idea\r\nof conquering in person the one great province of Spain which\r\nremained intact. A brilliant campaign, in which he would figure\r\nas commander-in-chief as well as king, might at last convince the\r\nSpaniards of his capacity. He was prepared to play the part of a\r\nmerciful and generous conqueror. At the worst the revenues of the\r\nwealthy Andalusia would be a godsend to his depleted treasury.\r\n\r\n  [125] Soult writes plaintively to Berthier, from Madrid, on\r\n  January 1, 1810: ‘Le Roi croit ne pouvoir différer davantage:\r\n  ainsi il se met en mesure d’exécuter les dispositions générales\r\n  de l’Empereur, lorsque Sa Majesté aura daigné les faire\r\n  connaître; et il est vraisemblable qu’avant que la Sierra Morena\r\n  soit passée, les ordres, qui out été demandés depuis plus d’un\r\n  mois, seront parvenus.’ But the order never came.\r\n\r\nTwo plans were drawn up for the invasion. The first was more\r\ncautious, and more consonant with the strict rules of strategy. The\r\nsecond was bolder and promised more immediate results. According to\r\nthe first the King was to concentrate his main army in La Mancha, and\r\nto threaten the passes, while two great flanking columns carried out\r\nthe preliminary conquest of Estremadura and Valencia. Mortier was to\r\nmarch with the 5th and 2nd Corps upon Badajoz, to crush Albuquerque,\r\nand to occupy the valley of the Guadiana. Simultaneously Suchet\r\nwas to make a push from Aragon into Valencia with the bulk of his\r\ncorps, while his place at Saragossa was to be taken by a large force\r\ndrawn from the newly-arrived reinforcements from France. Only when\r\nBadajoz and Valencia had fallen, and Suchet and Mortier could advance\r\nparallel with him on either flank, was the King to march against\r\nSeville. The weak point of the scheme was that either Badajoz or\r\nValencia might make a long resistance; if their garrisons fought like\r\nthat of Gerona the central advance on Andalusia might be delayed for\r\nan indefinite time.\r\n\r\nThe second plan, the one that was adopted, was to leave the 2nd\r\nCorps alone to watch Albuquerque and Estremadura, to order Suchet\r\nto advance against Valencia, but to strike straight at Seville,\r\nwithout waiting for the completion of either the Estremaduran or the\r\nValencian operations. In the original draft for this campaign[126],\r\nnearly the whole of the King’s army was to concentrate at Almaden\r\nand Ciudad Real, and from thence to strike straight at Cordova, by\r\nthe difficult and little-used passes of the central Sierra Morena.\r\nMeanwhile Sebastiani, with no more than a single infantry division\r\nand Milhaud’s dragoons, was to demonstrate against the main group\r\nof passes in front of La Carolina, along the line of the high-road\r\nfrom Madrid, so as to distract the attention of the Spaniards from\r\nthe real point of attack. More than 50,000 men were to descend\r\nsuddenly on Cordova, for the whole of the 1st and 5th Corps,\r\nDessolles’ Reserve division, the King’s Guard, and Latour-Maubourg’s\r\ndragoons, were to march in a mass by the unexpected route via\r\nAlmaden, Villanueva de la Jara, and Adamuz. The Spanish centre would\r\nundoubtedly be broken, and it was probable that Cordova, Seville, and\r\nCadiz would be carried by the first rush, for Areizaga’s army would\r\nbe cut off from them and driven eastward towards Murcia.\r\n\r\n  [126] It may be found set forth in full in Soult’s dispatch to\r\n  Berthier of Jan. 1, 1810.\r\n\r\nThe plan, an admirable one from the point of view of strategy, had\r\nto be abandoned, for it was found that the country between Almaden\r\nand Cordova was so absolutely barren and uninhabited, and the roads\r\nso bad, that it would be impossible to carry a very large body of\r\ntroops across it at mid-winter. It was doubtful whether the passes\r\nwere practicable for artillery; it was certain that no food could\r\nbe obtained, and the train required to carry rations for 50,000 men\r\nwould be so large and heavy that it would probably stick fast in the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nOn January 11, when Mortier, Dessolles, and the rest of the army had\r\nalready moved out of their cantonments and taken the road for La\r\nMancha, the revised draft of the plan of campaign was issued. It was\r\ninferior in unity of conception to the first plan, and did not seem\r\nlikely to produce such good results; but it had the merit of being\r\npracticable. By this scheme Victor alone was to march on Cordova,\r\nwith the 22,000 men of the 1st Corps: he was to endeavour to take his\r\nartillery with him, but if the passes proved too rough, he was to\r\nsend it back by Almaden to join the main army. Mortier, Dessolles,\r\nSebastiani, Milhaud, and the King’s Reserves were to strike at the\r\ngroup of passes in front of La Carolina, and to drive the Spaniards\r\nout of them: it was hoped that they would thrust Areizaga’s host\r\ninto the arms of Victor, who would be descending into the valley of\r\nthe Guadalquivir just in time to meet the enemy retiring from the\r\ndefiles. For this operation the King was to take with him rather more\r\nthan 40,000 men.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that this plan divided the French army into two\r\nseparate columns entirely destitute of lateral communications,\r\nand that, if the Spaniards had been stronger, considerable danger\r\nwould have been incurred. Areizaga might have concentrated every\r\nman against one or other of the columns, and have brought it to a\r\nstand, while merely observing the other. But to do so he would have\r\nrequired a far larger force than he actually possessed: he had, as\r\nwe have seen, only 23,000 men under arms, and even if he collected\r\nevery available bayonet in one mass, either half of the French army\r\nwas strong enough to meet and to beat him. The King, therefore, was\r\nrunning no real risk when he divided up his troops. As a matter of\r\nfact, Areizaga had made matters easy for the enemy, by splitting his\r\nsmall and dilapidated host into three sections--Zerain, with 4,500\r\nmen only, was on Victor’s road; the head quarters, with 13,000 men,\r\nwere at La Carolina opposite the King; Vigodet with 6,000, was far to\r\nthe right in the eastern passes[127]. Disaster was inevitable from\r\nthe first moment of the campaign.\r\n\r\n  [127] See for details pages 111-12.\r\n\r\nOn January 7 King Joseph and Soult moved out from Madrid in the wake\r\nof the columns of Dessolles and the Royal Guard, which had already\r\nstarted. On the 8th they were at Toledo, on the 11th at Almagro, near\r\nCiudad Real; here they conferred with Victor, and, in consequence of\r\nhis reports concerning the state of the passes in the direction of\r\nCordova, recast their plans, and adopted the scheme of operations\r\nwhich has just been detailed. On the following day Victor and his\r\ncorps marched from Ciudad Real for Almaden, to carry out the great\r\nturning movement. The main army waited for six days to allow him to\r\nget far forward on his rugged route, and only on the 18th started out\r\nto deliver the frontal attack on the Despeña-Perros and the other\r\npasses in front of La Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that Joseph had left behind him to garrison\r\nMadrid the French division of the 4th Corps[128], and not Dessolles’\r\ntroops, who had been wont to occupy the capital during the earlier\r\noperations. Both Dessolles’ and Joseph’s own reserves, his Royal\r\nGuard and a strong brigade of his newly-raised Spanish army, joined\r\nin the invasion. Since the German division of the 4th Corps was still\r\nabsent, escorting the prisoners of Ocaña, it resulted that Sebastiani\r\nhad with him only his Polish division, his cavalry, and some details\r\nsufficient to muster up a total of just 10,000 men. His corps was\r\nnever properly reassembled during the whole of the rest of the war,\r\nas some of the regiments which he now left behind never rejoined him\r\nin Andalusia, but were left in garrison in New Castile till 1812, and\r\npractically became part of the ‘Army of the Centre.’\r\n\r\n  [128] With the exception of the 58th Regiment, which went on with\r\n  Sebastiani to the front.\r\n\r\nBesides the garrison of Madrid, Joseph left to cover his rear the\r\nwhole 2nd Corps, still under the provisional command of Heudelet,\r\nwhich lay at Talavera and was charged to watch Albuquerque. If the\r\nrumour of the departure of the English from Badajoz were true,\r\nthere would be no danger in this quarter. But Joseph was not yet\r\nquite certain that Wellington had retired into Portugal. The only\r\nserious preoccupation which vexed his mind, at the moment when he was\r\npreparing to attack, was the idea that the English might still come\r\nup by Truxillo and join Albuquerque in a raid on Madrid. Heudelet,\r\nthe constant purveyor of false information, did his best to scare his\r\nmaster on January 13, by sending him a report that Wellington was\r\nstill at Badajoz with 23,000 men[129]. But later and more trustworthy\r\nnews from other quarters, showing that the English army had marched\r\noff for Abrantes long before Christmas, at last set the King’s mind\r\nat rest on this all-important topic.\r\n\r\n  [129] Heudelet, writing from Talavera on Jan. 13, assured the\r\n  King that he had certain information, by English deserters, that\r\n  Wellington’s army, 16,000 foot and 7,000 cavalry, was at Merida,\r\n  Badajoz, and Elvas on Dec. 31. As a matter of fact, the army had\r\n  marched off between Dec. 9 and Dec. 20, and Wellington himself\r\n  had retired into Portugal on Christmas Eve. On the day when\r\n  Heudelet wrote he and his head quarters were at Vizeu, in the\r\n  Beira.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be feared from the west when Wellington had\r\ntaken his departure. Albuquerque’s small force was powerless, and if\r\nDel Parque moved down from the Sierra de Francia into the valley of\r\nthe Tagus, the 6th Corps could make a corresponding movement. Ney\r\nhad now returned to take command at Salamanca, and the confidence\r\nof his troops, shaken somewhat by Marchand’s incapable leadership,\r\nwas now restored. Behind Ney and Kellermann were the innumerable\r\nbattalions of the new reinforcements from Germany, the head of whose\r\ncolumn had now reached Burgos. The King’s rear, therefore, was well\r\nguarded when he began his great offensive movement against Andalusia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nANDALUSIA OVERRUN: CADIZ PRESERVED. JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1810\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, 1810, the unfortunate Areizaga began to\r\nreceive from all quarters dispatches which left him no doubt that\r\nthe fatal hour had arrived, and that the whole of his line, from\r\nVillamanrique on the east to Almaden on the west, was about to be\r\nassailed by the enemy. From every point on his front of 150 miles,\r\nhis subordinates sent him in reports to the effect that strong\r\nhostile columns had come up, and had thrust in their outposts.\r\nIndeed, Zerain, from his remote cantonment on the extreme left, had\r\nannounced that an overwhelming force, coming from the direction of\r\nCiudad Real, had beaten him out of the town of Almaden as early as\r\nthe 15th, and had compelled him to retire towards the south-west,\r\nleaving the direct road to Cordova uncovered. This was, of course,\r\nthe corps of Victor, whose flanking movement was already threatening\r\nto cut the line of communication between La Carolina and Seville.\r\nBut it would take some days for the 1st Corps to pass the rugged\r\ndefiles of the Sierra de Los Pedroches, which lie between Almaden\r\nand the valley of the Guadalquivir. An even more pressing danger\r\nseemed to be foreshadowed from the less-remote right of the Spanish\r\nline, where Vigodet reported, from the pass of Villamanrique, that\r\nhe had been driven in to his final fighting position at Montizon, by\r\na French column marching up from Villanueva de los Infantes. In the\r\ncentre, the enemy had advanced to Santa Cruz de la Mudela, where the\r\nroads to all the group of passes about the Despeña-Perros branch off,\r\nbut had not yet shown how many of them he intended to use. Areizaga\r\ncould not determine whether some of the French movements were mere\r\ndemonstrations, or whether every one of them portended a real attack\r\non the morrow. Zerain was too far off to be helped; but Vigodet’s\r\ndemands for assistance were so pressing that the Commander-in-Chief\r\nsent off to his aid, on the night of the 19th, the one division\r\nwhich he had hitherto kept in reserve at La Carolina, the 4,000\r\nbayonets of Castejon. This left him only three divisions--those of\r\nZayas, Lacy, and Giron, not more than 9,000 men in all, to defend the\r\nhigh-road to Madrid and the subsidiary passes on its immediate flank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDALUSIA, to illustrate the Campaign of 1810.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the appearance of the French advanced guards\r\nimplied a genuine attack at every possible point of access.\r\nKing Joseph had resolved to carry the whole of the defiles by a\r\nsimultaneous onslaught on the morning of the 20th. His policy seems\r\nto have been one of very doubtful wisdom, for it would have been\r\nas effective to pierce the Spanish line at one point as at four,\r\nand he could have concentrated an overwhelming force, and have\r\nbeen absolutely certain of success, if he had launched his main\r\nbody at one objective, while demonstrating against the rest. He\r\nhad preferred, however, to cut up his army into four columns, each\r\nof which assailed a different pass. Sebastiani, on the extreme\r\nFrench left, separated by a gap of twenty miles from the main\r\ncolumn, was the enemy who had driven in Vigodet at the opening of\r\nthe Villamanrique pass. He had with him the remains of his own 4th\r\nCorps--of which such a large proportion had been left behind in New\r\nCastile,--a body of about 10,000 men[130]. His orders were to force\r\nthe defile in his front, and to descend into the plain in the rear of\r\nthe Spanish centre, by way of Ubeda and Linares, so as to cut off the\r\nenemy’s retreat towards Murcia, and to envelop him if he should hold\r\nthe Despeña-Perros too long.\r\n\r\n  [130] Viz. by the ‘morning states’ of January 15, in the French\r\n  War Office, Sebastiani had: Polish Division, 4,809 men; 58th of\r\n  the Line, 1,630 men; Milhaud’s Dragoons, 1,721 men; Perreymond’s\r\n  Light Horse, 1,349 men; Artillery and Engineers, 569 men; or a\r\n  total of 10,078 sabres and bayonets.\r\n\r\nNext to Sebastiani in the French line was a column composed of\r\nGirard’s division of the 5th Corps, the King’s Guards, and the\r\nSpanish regiments in Joseph’s service[131]. It was nearly 14,000\r\nstrong, and advanced straight up the Madrid _chaussée_, aiming at\r\nthe Despeña-Perros and the Spanish centre. If the enemy should fight\r\nwell, and if the flanking movements should fail, this column would\r\nhave the hardest work before it: for, unlike the minor passes to east\r\nand west, the Despeña-Perros becomes in its central length a narrow\r\nand precipitous defile, easily capable of defence. The Spaniards had\r\nrun entrenchments across it, and had mined the road at more than\r\none point. But its fatal weakness lay in the fact that the by-paths\r\nfrom the western passes descend into it to the rear of the point\r\nwhere these obstructions had been placed. If they were seized by the\r\nadvancing French, the fortifications across the _chaussée_ would\r\nprove a mere trap for the troops which held them.\r\n\r\n  [131] Strength apparently: Girard, 7,040; Royal Guards, about\r\n  2,500; Spaniards, about 2,000; Cavalry, about 1,500; Artillery,\r\n  &c., 800.\r\n\r\nMortier, with Gazan’s division of the 5th Corps and Dessolles’\r\ntroops, about 15,000 strong, was told off to assail these flanking\r\ndefiles on the Spanish left[132]. The two passes are the Puerto del\r\nRey and the Puerto del Muradal. The former got its name from Alfonso\r\nVIII, who in 1212 had turned the position of the Almohad Sultan\r\nMohammed-abu-Yakub by this route, and so forced him to the decisive\r\nbattle of Navas de Tolosa, a few miles to the rear. In 1810 it was a\r\ntortuous and rough road, but practicable for artillery: the slopes\r\non either side of it, moreover, were not inaccessible to infantry.\r\nA mile or two to its left, nearer the Despeña-Perros, was the still\r\nrougher path of the Puerto del Muradal, which was practicable for\r\ninfantry but not for guns. Between this defile and the entrenchments\r\nacross the Madrid _chaussée_, the crest of the Sierra was accessible\r\nto troops advancing in loose order and prepared for a stiff climb:\r\nthe Spanish engineers had therefore placed a large earthwork on its\r\nculminating point, known as the Collado de Valdeazores. Giron’s\r\nweak division of no more than 3,200 bayonets was entrusted with the\r\ndefence both of the Puerto del Rey and the Puerto del Muradal. Those\r\nof Lacy and Zayas, about 5,000 in all, held the Despeña-Perros and\r\nthe entrenchments on each side of it. Areizaga lay behind them, with\r\na reserve of 1,000 men at most--having sent off Castejon and his\r\ndivision to join Vigodet on the preceding night, he had no more with\r\nhim than his personal guard, the ‘Batallón del General’, and some\r\ndetached companies.\r\n\r\n  [132] Gazan’s division, forming the third French column, had\r\n  6,414 bayonets; Dessolles’, the extreme right-hand column, 8,354.\r\n\r\nMortier, like the good general that he was, did not confine his\r\noperations to an attack against the narrow fronts of the two passes,\r\nbut assailed the rough hillside on each side of them, sending out\r\nwhole battalions deployed as skirmishers to climb the slopes. Of\r\nGazan’s division, one brigade marched against the Puerto del Muradal,\r\nbut the other went up, in open order, on the space between the Puerto\r\nand the Spanish redoubt at the Collado de Valdeazores. Similarly,\r\nDessolles attacked the Puerto del Rey with a few battalions, but sent\r\nthe rest up the less formidable portions of the flanking slopes.\r\nGirard and the King’s Reserves, meanwhile, did not press their attack\r\non the Despeña-Perros, till the troops on their right had already\r\nbegun to drive the enemy before them.\r\n\r\nThe results of these tactics might have been foreseen from the first:\r\nGiron’s 3,200 men, attacked by 15,000, were driven in at a pace that\r\never grew more rapid. They could not defend the passes, because the\r\nslopes on each side were turned by the enemy. Their line was broken\r\nin two or three places, and they fled in haste down the rear of\r\nthe Sierra, to escape being captured by flanking detachments which\r\nwere pushing on at full speed to head them off. The moment that the\r\nDespeña-Perros was turned by Mortier’s movement, the troops occupying\r\nit had to retreat at headlong speed, just as Girard was commencing\r\nhis attack on them. All did not retire with sufficient promptness:\r\nthe battalion in a redoubt on the Collado de los Jardines, on the\r\nright flank of the high-road, was cut off and captured _en masse_.\r\nAll the guns in the pass were taken, there being no time to get them\r\naway down the steep road in their rear. After two hours of scrambling\r\nrather than fighting, the main passages of the Sierra Morena were in\r\nthe hands of the French. The mines on the high-road had been fired\r\nwhen the retreat was ordered, but did not wreck the _chaussée_ in\r\nsuch a way as to prevent the enemy from pursuing. The losses of the\r\nSpaniards were no more than a few hundreds killed and wounded, and\r\n500 prisoners; those of the French were less than 100 in all[133].\r\nThere had, in truth, been hardly the semblance of a battle.\r\n\r\n  [133] Soult’s statement that he lost ‘some 25 men’ (Soult\r\n  to Berthier, Jan. 21) is no doubt a little exaggerated. But\r\n  Martinien’s invaluable tables show that Mortier’s corps, which\r\n  did nearly all the fighting, lost only _two_ officers out of 549\r\n  present, probably, therefore, it lost no more than forty men.\r\n  Dessolles must have lost about the same.\r\n\r\nThe full results of the disaster were only developed next day: the\r\ntroops which had defended the central passes escaped, though in\r\ndreadful disorder. But those further to their right were destined\r\nto a worse fate. While Mortier and the King were forcing the great\r\ndefiles, Sebastiani had been fighting all day with Vigodet, in the\r\ndefiles about Montizon and St. Esteban del Puerto. He had no such\r\nsuperiority in numbers over his enemy as had the King on the main\r\nfield of operations[134], hence his progress was slower, and his\r\nvictory, though complete, was not so prompt and crushing. Vigodet\r\nand his 6,000 men were dispersed by the afternoon, and fled down the\r\nvalley of the Guadalen towards the plains, with Sebastiani’s cavalry\r\nin pursuit. Having fought much longer than Lacy and Giron, their\r\nlosses were heavier than those of the central division--probably\r\n1,000 killed, wounded, or taken. Shortly after, there appeared on\r\nthe scene, moving along the steep hill-path from La Carolina, the\r\nSpanish division of Castejon, which had been sent off on the previous\r\nnight to support Vigodet. It found the St. Esteban position in the\r\npossession of the French, and turned hastily back to rejoin Areizaga.\r\nBut, while it had been on the march, the Commander-in-Chief and his\r\narmy had been routed, and La Carolina was in the hands of the French.\r\nCastejon found himself enclosed between Sebastiani and the King, in\r\na most perilous position. On the morning of the 21st, he tried to\r\nescape by the by-path to Linares, but on arriving near that place\r\nfound that Mortier’s troops were already across his road. A brigade\r\nof Sebastiani’s corps was in hot pursuit in his rear, and Castejon,\r\nseeing himself thus enclosed, surrendered at Arquillos, with his\r\nwhole intact division of over 4,000 men and ten guns.\r\n\r\n  [134] Of his whole 10,000 men only 6,400 were infantry, and\r\n  Vigodet (with the wrecks of Jacomé’s division) had nearly as many.\r\n\r\nAlready, before the capture of this Spanish corps, the King and\r\nSebastiani had joined hands, their reconnoitring parties having met\r\nin the valley of the Guadalen. On learning of the complete success\r\nof both columns, Joseph and Soult resolved to urge the pursuit in\r\ntwo separate directions. Sebastiani was told to push forward by\r\nway of Ubeda and Baeza to Jaen, while the main column marched by\r\nBaylen on Andujar and Cordova. It was hoped that news of Victor would\r\nsoon be received: if all had gone well, he would have reached the\r\nGuadalquivir somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cordova, so as to be\r\nin the rear of any Spanish force that might have retreated from La\r\nCarolina in the direction of Seville.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, both Vigodet and also Areizaga with the\r\nwreck of the troops from the central passes, had abandoned any hope\r\nof covering Seville, and had retreated southwards on Jaen. There was\r\nno force whatever left upon the Cordova road, and the King met no\r\nresistance upon the 22nd or the 23rd. On the latter day Sebastiani,\r\narriving in front of Jaen, found the Spanish commander-in-chief with\r\nsome 7,000 or 8,000 men prepared to defend the town. He attacked at\r\nonce, and routed these dispirited troops, who made little or no show\r\nof resistance. Practically the whole force went to pieces: the French\r\ncaptured forty-six guns, mostly those of the reserve-park of the Army\r\nof Andalusia, which had been deposited in Jaen. Of the wrecks of that\r\nunhappy force, Areizaga carried off a small remnant to Guadix in the\r\neastern mountains, near the borders of Murcia. Lacy, with another\r\nfraction, retired on Granada. But the large majority had left their\r\ncolours, and dispersed to their homes.\r\n\r\nKing Joseph and Soult meanwhile, advancing unopposed along the\r\nhigh-road to Cordova and Seville, got into touch at Andujar with\r\nthe advanced cavalry of Victor on the night of the 22nd of January.\r\nThe march of the 1st Corps had been toilsome in the extreme, but\r\nalmost unopposed save by the difficulties of the road. After driving\r\nZerain’s little detachment out of Almaden on the 15th, they had\r\nhardly seen an enemy. Zerain and his colleague Copons had retired by\r\nthe road towards Seville south-westward. Victor, though he sent out\r\nflying parties of cavalry to threaten Benalcazar and Hinojosa, to\r\nhis right, had really pushed further to the left, on the easternmost\r\nof the two rough passes which lead to Cordova. The day after\r\nleaving Almaden he had sent his artillery back to La Mancha, the\r\ndilapidated and abandoned road to which he had committed himself\r\nproving absolutely impracticable for anything that travelled on\r\nwheels. But he pushed on with his infantry and horsemen, and passing\r\nSanta Eufemia, Torrecampo and Villanueva de la Jara, came down into\r\nthe plain of the Guadalquivir at Adamuz, fifteen miles to the east\r\nof Cordova, on January 21st, the day after Soult and King Joseph\r\nhad forced the Despeña Perros and the Puerto del Rey. Wishing to\r\nget into touch with them before attacking Cordova, he halted his\r\ninfantry, but sent out his cavalry to the gates of that city on the\r\none side, and on the other to Montoro and Andujar, where they met\r\nthe vedettes of the main army on the evening of the 22nd. Thus the\r\nFrench host was once more concentrated: the march on Seville could\r\nbe continued without delay. Victor now became the advanced guard: he\r\nentered Cordova, which opened its gates without resistance, on the\r\n24th. There was no Spanish force in front of the French army, since\r\nZerain and Copons had retired towards Seville by a road far to the\r\nwest, while the wrecks of Areizaga’s army had been driven off in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction.\r\n\r\nSoult and King Joseph, therefore, had leisure to plan out the\r\nremainder of their campaign without any disturbance from the enemy.\r\nOn the 25th[135] they resolved to detach Sebastiani and his 10,000\r\nmen for the conquest of Granada, to leave Dessolles’ division at\r\nCordova and Andujar, but to march on Seville in a single mass with\r\nthe remaining 50,000 sabres and bayonets of the Army of Andalusia.\r\nThe desire to seize the capital from which the Junta had so long\r\ndefied him, seems to have mastered every other idea in the mind of\r\nthe intrusive King. The rebel government should be captured, or at\r\nleast forced to take refuge in Portugal or the sea. Then at last\r\nthe provinces would submit, the regular armies would lay down their\r\narms, the guerrillero bands would disperse to their homes, and he\r\nmight reign as a real king, not as the mere tool of his imperious\r\nbrother. The capture of Seville would be the last act but one of\r\nthe drama: after that he would become the national monarch of a\r\nsubmissive people, and carry out all the schemes of vague benevolence\r\non which his mind was wont to dwell in his more hopeful hours. That\r\nthe resistance would continue, even if Seville were his own and the\r\nJunta were scattered and discredited, he did not dream. And Seville,\r\nhe knew, must fall; to defend it there could be, as he concluded,\r\nnothing but a half-armed mob, backed by the few thousand dispirited\r\nsoldiers who had fled before Victor from the western section of\r\nthe Sierra Morena. Even if the rebel capital made itself a second\r\nSaragossa, he had at his disposal an army double the strength of that\r\nwhich had reduced the obstinate Aragonese city.\r\n\r\n  [135] For details of their plans see the dispatch of Soult to\r\n  Berthier, from Andujar under the date of that day.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent years critics, wise after the event, never tired of\r\ndeclaiming against the policy which Joseph and Soult approved on\r\nJanuary 25, 1810. It was easy in 1811 or 1812 to point out that a\r\ndivision or two might have been spared from the victorious army to\r\nexecute a march upon Cadiz, while the main force was dealing with\r\nSeville. The island-fortress, which was to defy the French during\r\nthe next three years, might have been caught while it was still\r\nungarrisoned and panic-stricken, if only the invaders had detached\r\na column from Carmona, where the road from Cordova bifurcates to\r\nSeville on the right and Cadiz on the left. It is certain that,\r\nif any suggestion to that effect was made at the time, Soult,\r\nMortier, and the other generals present at the council of war passed\r\nit over[136]. The fact was that Seville loomed large before the\r\nimaginations of them all: Cadiz seemed but a secondary affair at\r\nthe moment. It appeared probable that the whole of the scattered\r\nforces of the enemy would mass themselves to defend the insurgent\r\ncapital. On January 25th, when the original plan was drawn up, no one\r\nrealized that there was a Spanish army approaching, whose presence\r\nin Andalusia had not yet become known, or that the general of that\r\narmy would deliberately leave Seville to its fate, as incapable of\r\ndefence and doomed to destruction, and hasten by forced marches to\r\nthrow himself into the island-city which was destined to become the\r\nnew capital of insurgent Spain. Unable to foresee such a development,\r\nJoseph wrote to his brother on January 27 that Seville would probably\r\nsubmit without fighting, and that he would then enter Cadiz ‘_sans\r\ncoup férir_.’\r\n\r\n  [136] There was a considerable controversy among French military\r\n  writers as to whether the omission to march on Cadiz was the\r\n  fault of Soult or of the King. The authors of _Victoires et\r\n  Conquêtes_, having put all the blame on the latter (vol. xx. page\r\n  7), his friends hastened to reply. His aide-de-camp Bigarré,\r\n  who was present with him at the time, explicitly says in his\r\n  autobiography (pp. 265-6) that the King raised the point, but\r\n  was talked down by Soult and Dessolles. Miot de Melito (ii. 385)\r\n  bears witness to the same effect, saying that he heard Soult\r\n  clinch his argument by crying ‘Qu’on me réponde de Séville, moi\r\n  je réponds de Cadix.’ Both say that the final decision was made\r\n  at Carmona. See also Ducasse’s _Correspondance du roi Joseph_,\r\n  vii. 142-3, and x. pp. 395-6, where the same story is given by\r\n  the King himself.\r\n\r\nAlbuquerque’s operations, which ultimately turned out to be the\r\nmost important section of the Andalusian campaign, need a word of\r\nexplanation. It will be remembered that, early in January, he had\r\nassembled, at Don Benito and Medellin, the small field-force that he\r\ncould command, after providing the garrison of Badajoz and leaving a\r\ndetachment above Almaraz to watch the French 2nd Corps. It did not\r\namount to more than 8,000 men, of which some 1,000 were cavalry. His\r\nposition at Don Benito was intended to protect the flank of Zerain\r\nand Copons, who lay to his right, covering the passes that lead from\r\nAlmaden on to Cordova. On January 15th he received from Zerain the\r\nnews that he was about to be attacked at Almaden by a French column\r\nof at least 20,000 men. The Duke promptly began to march eastward to\r\njoin his colleague, and reached Campanario on January 16th. Here he\r\nwas met by the information that Zerain had been driven out of Almaden\r\non the preceding day, and had drawn back by Benalcazar and Hinojosa\r\non to the Seville road. Copons from Pozo Blanco was retiring in the\r\nsame direction. The Duke thereupon concluded that his duty was to\r\nfall back by a route parallel to that of Victor’s advance, and to\r\ndraw nearer to Seville, strengthening himself as he approached that\r\ncity by Zerain’s and Copons’ small corps.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he sent off three of his weakest battalions to strengthen\r\nthe garrison of Badajoz, which was very small at the moment, directed\r\nhis artillery (with a cavalry escort) to take the good but circuitous\r\nhigh-road to Seville by Merida, Los Santos, and Santa Olalla, and\r\nstarted off across the mountains with his infantry and 500 horse.\r\nMarching very rapidly, though the roads were bad and the days short,\r\nhe moved by Zalamea and Maguilla to Guadalcanal, on the borders\r\nof Andalusia, which he reached on January 18th. Here he received\r\nfrom the Central Junta an absurd order, apparently based on the\r\nidea that he was still at Campanario, which bade him stop Victor’s\r\nadvance, by falling on his flank and rear by the road to Agudo and\r\nAlmaden. But since the marshal had seized Almaden on the 15th, and\r\nwas known to have moved southward from thence, it was clear that he\r\nmust now be more than half-way to Cordova: if the Army of Estremadura\r\nplunged back into the mountains to seek Agudo and Almaden, it would\r\nonly reach them on the 22nd or 23rd, and Victor would be at the\r\ngates of Cordova on the 21st. The Junta’s order was so hopelessly\r\nimpracticable that the Duke took upon himself to disobey it, and\r\nwrote in reply that he should move so as to place himself between\r\nVictor and Seville, and would cover the Andalusian capital ‘so far as\r\nwas possible with the small force at his disposition.’\r\n\r\nAccordingly Albuquerque, instead of returning northward into the\r\nEstremaduran mountains, moved a stage further south, to El Pedroso,\r\non the road from Guadalcanal to Seville, and sent orders to Copons\r\nand Zerain to join him with their small divisions. Two days later\r\nhe received the order which should have been sent him on the 18th,\r\ninstead of the insane directions that were actually given; by it\r\nhe was directed to march on Seville with all speed. On the 23rd,\r\ntherefore, he arrived at the ferry of Cantillana, twenty miles\r\nnorth of Seville: here he received news that his artillery and its\r\nescort had safely completed its round, and were about to cross the\r\nGuadalquivir at Rinconada, fifteen miles to the south. At Cantillana,\r\nhowever, the Duke got the last dispatch which the Central Junta ever\r\nissued; it was dated on the 23rd, a few hours before the members\r\ndispersed and fled. By this he was directed to march not on Seville\r\nbut on Cordova, which at the moment the document came to hand--the\r\nmorning of the 24th--had just been occupied by Victor.\r\n\r\nThat day Albuquerque crossed the Guadalquivir and occupied Carmona,\r\nwhere he was joined by his artillery, and by part of Copons’\r\ndivision, but not (apparently) by Zerain’s, which had retired into\r\nSeville. He had now about 10,000 men, of whom 1,000 were horsemen,\r\nand 20 guns. From Carmona he threw out a cavalry screen on all\r\nsides: his vedettes on the 27th struck French cavalry at Ecija,\r\nand were driven in; they reported that the enemy was advancing\r\nin enormous force from Cordova--as was indeed the case. Meanwhile\r\nnews had come up from Seville that the Junta had fled on the night\r\nof the 23rd-24th, that anarchy reigned in the city, and that a new\r\nrevolutionary government had been installed. There was no longer any\r\nlegitimate executive from which orders could be received. Albuquerque\r\nhad to make up his mind whether he would retire into Seville, and\r\nput himself at the disposition of the mob and its leaders, or\r\nwhether he should seek some safer base of operations. Without a\r\nmoment’s hesitation he resolved to leave the Andalusian capital to\r\nitself, and to retire on Cadiz, which he knew to be ungarrisoned,\r\nyet to be absolutely impregnable if it were properly held. This wise\r\nresolution, it may be said without hesitation, saved the cause of\r\nSpain in the south. If Cadiz had been left unoccupied there would\r\nhave been no further resistance in Andalusia.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to the operations of the French. On the 25th\r\nVictor had advanced from Cordova, taking the direct road to Seville\r\nvia La Carlota and Ecija, while Mortier and the Royal Guard followed\r\nhim at short intervals. The Duke of Belluno occupied Ecija on the\r\n27th and Carmona on the 28th. On these two days his advanced guard\r\ngot into contact with Albuquerque’s cavalry screen, and learnt from\r\nprisoners that the Army of Estremadura, whose presence in Andalusia\r\nthus became known, was in front of them[137]. On reaching Carmona\r\nVictor obtained the still more important news that Albuquerque, after\r\nstaying in that place for two days, had not retired into Seville,\r\nas might have been expected, but had marched southward to Utrera on\r\nthe road to Cadiz, leaving the greater city uncovered. On the night\r\nof the 29th the leading division of Victor’s corps, the dragoons of\r\nLatour-Maubourg, appeared in front of Seville, and reported that\r\nworks were being hastily thrown up around it on all sides[138], and\r\nthat they had been fired on by masses of armed irregulars at every\r\npoint where they had pushed forward vedettes towards its suburbs[139].\r\n\r\n  [137] See Soult to Berthier, from Carmona, Jan. 31.\r\n\r\n  [138] Soult, in his dispatch of Jan. 31, says that the advanced\r\n  guard of the 1st Corps appeared before Seville _hier au soir_,\r\n  i. e. on the 30th. But the Spanish authorities give the evening\r\n  of the 29th as the true date, and seem to be correct. Possibly\r\n  Soult is speaking of the first solid force of infantry, and\r\n  does not count the cavalry as a real advanced guard, but only\r\n  as a reconnoitring force. As Latour-Maubourg was at Carmona on\r\n  the 28th, it seems certain that he must have reached Seville\r\n  (eighteen miles only from Carmona) on the 29th, not the 30th.\r\n\r\n  [139] Napier (ii. 298) seems unjust to the arrangements of the\r\n  King and Soult when he writes: ‘From Andujar to Seville is only\r\n  100 miles, and the French took ten days to traverse them, a\r\n  tardiness for which there appears no adequate cause.’ He then\r\n  attributes it to King Joseph’s wish to make spectacular entries,\r\n  and to display his benevolence to the Andalusian towns. But the\r\n  facts are wrong. Joseph reached Andujar late on Jan. 22; Victor’s\r\n  cavalry was in front of Seville on Jan. 29: this makes seven,\r\n  not ten, days: and the distance by the direct road via Ecija and\r\n  Carmona is not 100, but 130 miles. A rate of eighteen miles a day\r\n  is no bad record for an army advancing through a hostile country,\r\n  even if it is meeting with no actual resistance. And January days\r\n  are short, with sunrise late and sunset early.\r\n\r\nSeville was at this moment, and had been now for six days, in a state\r\nof chaos. The Central Junta had absconded on the 23rd, taking along\r\nwith it both its Executive Committee and the Ministers of State.\r\nThe panic had begun on the 18th, when the news had come in that\r\nVictor’s corps had thrust Zerain out of Almaden three days before,\r\nand was marching on Cordova. It had grown worse two days later, when\r\nAreizaga reported that another French army was marching against the\r\nDespeña-Perros. The Junta published a proclamation on the 20th,\r\nexhorting the Andalusians to have no fear, for Albuquerque had been\r\ndirected to fall on Victor’s flank, and Del Parque with the Army of\r\nCastile was on the march to join him, so that the enemy would be\r\nforced to turn back to guard himself. Such orders were indeed sent,\r\nbut any man of sense could see that they must arrive too late. If\r\nVictor was at Almaden on the 15th, he might be at Cordova on the\r\n21st: if King Joseph was at the foot of the passes on the 19th, he\r\nmight be across them on the 20th. What use, therefore, would be a\r\nsummons sent to Albuquerque in Estremadura, or to Del Parque in the\r\nmountains between Bejar and Ciudad Rodrigo? The French would be\r\nin the valley of the Guadalquivir long before Del Parque had even\r\nreceived his orders to move. As a matter of fact, that general got\r\nhis dispatch on January 24, the day that Victor entered Cordova, and\r\neven Albuquerque was informed of the Junta’s behests only on the\r\n18th, when he reached Guadalcanal.\r\n\r\nThe obvious ineptitude which the Government had shown, and the\r\nimminent peril to which Seville was exposed, gave another chance\r\nto the local conspirators, who had already twice prepared a\r\n_pronunciamento_ against the Junta. On the 22nd riots broke out, and\r\ndemagogues were preaching at every street corner the necessity for\r\ndeposing these incapable rulers, and substituting for them a regency\r\nof true patriots, and a Committee of Public Safety, which should\r\nshow the energy in which the Junta had been so lacking. The people\r\nclamoured at the doors of the Arsenal, asking for muskets and cannon,\r\nthey mustered outside the prisons where Palafox, Montijo, and other\r\nchiefs who had been arrested for their earlier plots, were still\r\nconfined. Many of the members of the Junta left Seville on this and\r\nthe following day, on the plausible pretext that it was necessary for\r\nthem to betake themselves to Cadiz--which, by a decree of Jan. 13,\r\nhad been designated as the meeting-place of the approaching National\r\nCortes--in order to make preparations for the meeting of that august\r\nassembly. Indeed, the Junta had been directed to meet at Cadiz on\r\nFebruary 1 for that purpose. The news that King Joseph had forced the\r\npasses of the Sierra Morena, which came to hand early on the 22nd,\r\nsufficed to make an end of any shadow of power which the Junta still\r\npossessed. Next day those members who had hitherto stuck to their\r\npost, and the Ministers, left the town with elaborately contrived\r\nsecrecy. Seville fell into the hands of the mob, who, led by a\r\nCapuchin friar riding on a mule and brandishing a crucifix, burst\r\nopen the prisons and the Arsenal, armed themselves, and nominated\r\na new ‘Supreme National Junta.’ Its executive was to be composed\r\nof Palafox and Montijo, the Marquis of La Romana, General Eguia,\r\nand Francisco Saavedra, an aged and respectable person, who had\r\nbeen president of the old Junta of Seville, the original committee\r\nwhich had been suppressed by the Central Junta. He is said to have\r\nbeen used as a mere tool by Palafox and Montijo, and to have been\r\ndisgusted by their acts. This new, and obviously illegal, Government\r\nissued decrees stigmatizing the fugitive ‘Centralists’ as cowards\r\nand traitors, and claiming authority not only over Andalusia, but\r\nover all Spain. They ordered the calling out of the levy _en masse_,\r\nand issued commissions displacing generals and governors in all the\r\nprovinces. One of these documents declared Del Parque removed from\r\nthe command of the Army of the Left, and named La Romana as his\r\nsuccessor. The marquis, glad to escape from the tumult, rode off\r\nat once, presented himself at the head quarters of the Castilian\r\narmy, and was recognized without difficulty as its chief--though his\r\nauthority might well have been contested if any general had chosen to\r\ntake up the cause of the discredited Central Junta.\r\n\r\nBut that unhappy body had no longer a single friend: its members\r\nwere mobbed and arrested on their flight from Seville to Cadiz; its\r\nPresident the Archbishop of Laodicea, its Vice-President the Conde\r\nde Altamira, and the War Minister Cornel were seized at Xeres by a\r\nfrantic mob, and would have been murdered, if General Castaños, whom\r\nthe Junta had treated so badly in December 1808, had not arrived\r\nin time to save their lives. Twenty-three members reached Cadiz,\r\nand there, by a proclamation dated January 29th, abdicated their\r\nauthority, and nominated a Regency, to which they resigned their\r\npower, and the duty of receiving and welcoming the expected Cortes.\r\nThe Regents were Castaños, the Bishop of Orense, Admiral Escaño,\r\nSaavedra--the president of the new and illegal Junta at Seville--and\r\nFernandez de Leon, an American Treasury-official, who was to\r\nrepresent the Colonies[140]. It will be noted that the nominators\r\nwere wise enough to refrain from appointing any of their own number\r\nto serve in the Regency.\r\n\r\n  [140] After a very short tenure of office Fernandez de Leon was\r\n  superseded by Lardizabal, another American.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the duty of resisting the first shock of the French\r\nadvance fell not on the Regency, but on the Revolutionary Government\r\nwhich had installed itself in power at Seville. These usurpers proved\r\nthemselves quite as incapable as the men whom they had superseded.\r\nWhen once in possession of power, Palafox and his friends had to\r\ncount up their resources: they had at their disposal an armed mob\r\nof 20,000 men, and a mere handful of regular troops, consisting of\r\nthe regiments which had served as the guards of the late Junta, and\r\nfour or five isolated battalions from the division of Zerain, which\r\nhad finally sought refuge in Seville. These troops seem to have been\r\nabout 4,000 strong at the most[141]. There was an immense quantity\r\nof artillery from the arsenal; it had been dragged out to line the\r\nnew earthworks, on which the populace was busily engaged, but not two\r\nhundred trained gunners existed to man the batteries. It was hoped\r\nthat Albuquerque’s Estremaduran army would come to their aid, but--as\r\nwe have already seen--the Duke deliberately refused to acknowledge\r\nthe authority of the Seville Junta, and, instead of falling back upon\r\nthe city, marched southwards to Utrera on the Cadiz road, leaving the\r\ngreat _chaussée_ Ecija-Carmona-Seville open to the French.\r\n\r\n  [141] It is difficult to make out what precisely were the\r\n  battalions in Seville on January 23-29. But they certainly\r\n  included a battalion of the 1st Walloon Guards [the Junta’s old\r\n  guard], with 1st and 2nd of España and Barbastro from Zerain’s\r\n  division. It is almost certain that most of Zerain’s other\r\n  battalions were with these three.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, the leaders of the Junta having taken stock of their\r\nposition, and discovered its danger (for the lines which the people\r\nhad thrown up would have required 50,000 men to man them, and not\r\nhalf that force was forthcoming even if every rioter armed with\r\na musket was counted), copied in the most ignominious fashion\r\nthe prudence or cowardice of the Central Junta, which they had\r\nso fiercely denounced five days before. Under the cover of the\r\nnight Eguia, Montijo, Saavedra, and Palafox absconded from Seville\r\nwithout taking leave of their followers. Saavedra fled to Cadiz,\r\nwhere it is surprising to find that he was made a member of the new\r\nRegency, Palafox to Albuquerque’s camp, Montijo to the southern\r\nmountains, where (as he announced) he was intending to collect an\r\narmy of succour for Seville. When, therefore, on the next evening\r\nLatour-Maubourg’s dragoons appeared before the entrenchments of the\r\ncity, there was no longer any responsible government to turn the\r\nardour of the multitude to account. Nevertheless, mobs, headed by\r\nfrantic friars, ran to the entrenchments, and discharged musketry and\r\ncannon-shot at every French vedette that showed itself.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 30th, Victor appeared to reinforce\r\nLatour-Maubourg’s cavalry, bringing with him the bulk of the\r\ninfantry of the 1st Corps. The King, Soult, and Mortier were close\r\nbehind[142]. On this day it had been settled at a Council-of-War\r\nheld at Carmona that the whole of the army should march on Seville,\r\nleaving Cadiz alone for the present, and detaching only a brigade of\r\ncavalry to pursue the army of Albuquerque. On the next morning Victor\r\nreceived assurances, from persons who had escaped from the city,\r\nthat it was doubtful whether he would be opposed, since the mob was\r\npanic-stricken at the flight of its leaders, and the senior military\r\nofficers were convinced that resistance was impossible. Certain that\r\nthe defence would be feeble, if any were offered, Soult gave orders\r\nthat the 1st Corps should storm the lines on February 1st. But no\r\nmilitary operations were necessary: on the evening of January 31st\r\nthe corporation of Seville had sent out a deputation to negotiate for\r\nsurrender. They offered to admit the enemy, if they were guaranteed\r\nsecurity of life and property for all who should submit, and a\r\npromise that no extraordinary war-contribution should be levied on\r\ntheir city. To this the King, who was anxious to enter the place\r\nas a pacific conqueror, without storm or bloodshed, gave an eager\r\nconsent. While the civil authorities were treating with Victor, the\r\nsmall body of regular troops in Seville, under the Visconde de Gand,\r\nquietly left the place by the bridge leading to the western side of\r\nthe Guadalquivir, and retreated in haste toward the Condado de Niebla\r\nand the borders of Portugal.\r\n\r\n  [142] Dessolles’ division had been left behind at Cordova and\r\n  Andujar, to garrison Upper Andalusia, and to extend a helping\r\n  hand to Sebastiani, if he should meet with any resistance in his\r\n  conquest of the kingdom of Granada.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of February 1, Joseph entered Seville in triumph at\r\nthe head of his Guard, and lodged himself in the Alcazar, the old\r\nresidence of the Kings of Spain. He was welcomed by a deputation\r\nwhich comprised some persons of mark. The impression made on the\r\ncitizens by the conduct of the two Juntas, and the turbulence of\r\nthe mob which had ruled during the last eight days, had been so\r\ndeplorable that a considerable number of the Sevillians despaired of\r\nthe national cause, and rushed to acknowledge the usurper. Indeed,\r\nthere were more ‘Josefinos’ found in this city than in any other\r\ncorner of Spain. The ‘intrusive king’ released a number of political\r\nprisoners, whom the last Junta had arrested on suspicion of treason.\r\nApparently this suspicion had been well grounded, as many of the\r\ncaptives, headed by the Swiss generals Preux and Reding[143], did\r\nhomage to Joseph, and accepted office under him.\r\n\r\n  [143] Younger brother of the victor of Baylen.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these defections to his cause, and by the fact that\r\ndeputations had presented themselves from Cordova and Jaen to bespeak\r\nhis protection, Joseph hastened to publish an absurd address to his\r\narmy, couched in the magniloquent style which all French writers of\r\nproclamations at this time were wont to borrow from their Emperor.\r\n‘The barriers placed by Nature between the North and the South of\r\nSpain have fallen. You have met with friends only beyond the Sierra\r\nMorena. Jaen, Cordova, Seville have flung open their gates.... The\r\nKing of Spain desires that between the Pillars of Hercules a third\r\npillar shall arise, to recall to posterity, and to the navigators of\r\nboth the new and the old world, the memory of the officers and men of\r\nthat French army which drove back the English, saved thirty thousand\r\nSpaniards, pacified the ancient Baetica, and regained for France her\r\nnatural allies.’ The rather puzzling passage concerning the ‘thirty\r\nthousand Spaniards saved’ refers to the prisoners of Ocaña and the\r\nSierra Morena, whom the French, according to the King, ‘recognized as\r\nbrethren led astray by the common enemy. You spared them, and I have\r\nreceived them as my children.’\r\n\r\nSome elation in the King’s language was, perhaps, pardonable at the\r\nmoment. The moral effect of the surrender of Seville was considerable\r\nin France, England, and the rest of Europe, though less in Spain than\r\nelsewhere. The tangible trophies of the conquest were enormous--the\r\nplace had been the central arsenal of Spain, and the amount of\r\nartillery, ammunition, and warlike equipment captured was very\r\nlarge. The cannon-foundry and other military factories were taken\r\nover in excellent condition, and kept the French army of Andalusia\r\nwell supplied during the three years of its existence. Tobacco to\r\nthe value, as it was said, of £1,000,000 was found in the great\r\ncentral magazine, and quinine, quicksilver, and other commodities of\r\ngovernment monopoly to a considerable additional sum. Nothing had\r\nbeen done, since the news of the passage of the Sierra Morena had\r\narrived, to destroy or remove all this valuable state property.\r\n\r\nOn the day following their entry into Seville, Joseph and Soult\r\ndirected Victor to march in pursuit of Albuquerque, and to take\r\npossession of Cadiz. So complete had been the _débâcle_ of the\r\nSpanish armies since the Andalusian campaign began, that it seems\r\nto have been supposed that the Army of Estremadura would offer no\r\nserious resistance, even if it should succeed in throwing itself into\r\nCadiz before it was overtaken. Marching with laudable expedition, the\r\nDuke of Belluno covered the eighty-three miles between Seville and\r\nCadiz in four days, and presented himself in front of the place on\r\nthe evening of February 5th. But Albuquerque, unmolested in his march\r\nfrom Utrera, had arrived on the 3rd, bringing with him not only his\r\nown troops and those of Copons, but several recruit-battalions picked\r\nup at Xeres, Lebrija, San Lucar, and Puerto Santa Maria, where they\r\nhad been organizing. He had some 12,000 men in all, not counting the\r\ncivic militia of Cadiz, which had hitherto been its sole garrison.\r\n\r\nCadiz, in the days when the practicable range of the heaviest\r\nartillery did not exceed 2,500 yards, was one of the strongest places\r\nin the world. The town lies on the extreme point of a long sandy\r\npeninsula, which runs out into the sea from the Isla de Leon, a large\r\nisland separated from the mainland of Andalusia by the salt-water\r\nchannel of the Rio Santi Petri, an arm of the sea varying from 300 to\r\n400 yards in breadth, and flowing through marshes which make access\r\nto its banks very difficult. The Isla, protected by this enormous\r\nwet ditch, has a front towards the continent of about seven miles,\r\nfrom the naval arsenal of La Carraca at its north end to the Castle\r\nof Santi Petri at its south. Batteries had already been thrown up\r\nat all the commanding points, and Albuquerque had broken the only\r\nbridge, that of Zuazo, which crossed the marsh and the Rio. It would\r\nbe impossible to pass the channel save by collecting great quantities\r\nof boats, and these would have to move under artillery fire. Venegas,\r\nthe military governor of Cadiz, had already ordered all the vessels,\r\nsmall and great, of the villages round the bay to be destroyed or\r\nbrought across to the city. Moreover, there were a score of gunboats\r\nin the channel, manned from the Spanish fleet, which could be used\r\nto oppose any attempt to cross the Rio. Indeed, naval assistance to\r\nany amount was available for the defence of Cadiz: there were a dozen\r\nSpanish and four English line-of-battle ships in the harbour. All\r\nthrough the three long years while the French lay in front of the\r\nIsla, no attempt was ever made to throw a force in boats across the\r\nchannel: the venture seemed too hazardous.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Victor had, by some expedient, succeeded in crossing\r\nthe Rio, there were two lines of defence behind it, of far greater\r\nstrength than that formed by this outer ditch of the Cadiz works.\r\nThe triangular Isla de Leon forms with its apex a long sand-spit,\r\nwhich projects for four miles into the Atlantic. Half way along it\r\nthe breadth of the spit is contracted to no more than 200 yards,\r\nand here there was a continuous entrenchment from water to water,\r\ncalled the Cortadura, or the battery of San Fernando, armed with many\r\nheavy guns. Supposing this isthmus to have been passed, there lies,\r\ntwo miles further along the sand-spit, the outer enceinte of Cadiz\r\nitself, with a front of not more than 400 yards in breadth, and deep\r\nwater on either side.\r\n\r\nCadiz had been captured more than once in earlier wars, but always by\r\nan enemy who could attack from the sea. Neither the Isla de Leon nor\r\nthe San Fernando line could be held against an attack supported by a\r\nfleet which came close in shore, and battered the works from flank\r\nand rear, or landed troops behind them. The sea, it may be remarked,\r\nis four fathoms deep to within a short distance (about 300 yards) of\r\nthe shore, all along the south front of the Isla and the Isthmus,\r\nso that there was nothing to prevent a fleet coming close to the\r\nworks. But against any naval attack Cadiz was, in 1810, absolutely\r\nsecured by the predominance of the English fleet. There was no armed\r\nFrench vessel nearer than Bayonne or Barcelona, nor any possibility\r\nof bringing one round. All that was done by the besiegers in a three\r\nyears’ leaguer was to build some gunboats in the northern inlets of\r\nthe bay, and these they never dared to bring out into the open water.\r\n\r\nThe real danger to Cadiz lay not from the sea side, nor on the Isla\r\nfront, but from the inner side of the harbour and the east. Here a\r\nlong spit of land runs out from beside the town of Puerto Real in\r\nthe direction of Cadiz. It is called the Trocadero, from a village\r\nsituated on its south-eastern side. At its extreme point is a fort\r\nnamed San José, while another fort, named San Luis, lies alongside\r\nof the other on a low mud-island. In advance of both, built right in\r\nthe marsh, and surrounded by water at high-tide, was a third called\r\nMatagorda. These three forts were the outer defences of the harbour\r\nagainst a naval attack, and could cross fires with the town batteries\r\nand a castle called Puntales, which lies on the easternmost point\r\nof the isthmus, a mile from the battery of San Fernando. Matagorda\r\nis only 1,200 yards from Puntales, and 3,000 yards from the eastern\r\npoint of the city of Cadiz. If the French took possession of it, and\r\nof the neighbouring San José and San Luis, they could bombard the\r\nPuntales castle and all the neighbouring section of the Isthmus,\r\nto the grave danger and discomfort of all who had to pass between\r\nthe city and the Isla de Leon. They would also be able to annoy\r\nships lying in all the eastern reaches of the great harbour. But\r\nbefore Victor arrived in front of Cadiz, San José, San Luis, and\r\nMatagorda were blown up, with the leave of the governor Venegas, by a\r\ndetachment of seamen from the British fleet. There could, therefore,\r\nbe no trouble from this direction, unless the enemy succeeded in\r\nrestoring and rearming the three forts,--no easy task under the fire\r\nof the Puntales castle and the fleet. It was not till some months\r\nhad passed that the struggle began for these ruined works, the only\r\npoints from which the defence could be seriously incommoded.\r\n\r\nOn his first arrival Victor summoned the town, and received a prompt\r\nand angry answer of refusal from the governor and the local Junta.\r\nThe marshal inspected the city’s outer defences, and was forced to\r\nreport to the King at Seville that it seemed that nothing could\r\nbe done against the place till he had brought up heavy artillery,\r\nand built himself boats. Joseph, unwilling to believe anything\r\nthat contradicted the hopes of complete triumph that he had been\r\nnourishing ever since the passage of the Sierra Morena, came up to\r\nPuerto Santa Maria, on the bay of Cadiz, looked at the situation,\r\ndid not find it reassuring, and wrote to his imperial brother to\r\npropose that he should send out his Toulon fleet to attack the place\r\non the sea side[144]. Napoleon, still smarting under the memory of\r\nhow Admiral Martin had destroyed an important section of that fleet\r\nin the preceding October, ignored this proposal. He did not forget,\r\nthough his brother had apparently done so, the fact that the British\r\nMediterranean fleet was still in existence.\r\n\r\n  [144] ‘Sire, il paraît que Cadix veut se défendre. Nous verrons\r\n  dans quelques jours ce qu’elle fera lorsque nous aurons quelques\r\n  batteries montées. Si votre Majesté pouvait disposer de l’escadre\r\n  de Toulon, l’occasion pourrait être bonne.’ Joseph to Napoleon,\r\n  Sta. Maria, Feb. 18.\r\n\r\nThus the position in front of Cadiz assumed the shape which it was to\r\nmaintain for months, and even for years. Victor’s corps could provide\r\nenough men to observe the whole shore of the bay, and to blockade\r\nthe garrison. But the Spaniards recovered their courage when they\r\nsaw the enemy reduced to inactivity, and began ere long to receive\r\nreinforcements. The first to arrive were 3,000 of the regular troops\r\nwhich had been at Seville. This corps, under the Visconde de Gand,\r\nhad escaped westward after the capitulation, and, though pursued\r\nby a brigade of Mortier’s corps, reached Ayamonte, at the mouth of\r\nthe Guadiana, and there took ship for Cadiz. Somewhat later there\r\narrived some troops sent by Wellington. The Spaniards in their day of\r\ndisaster had forgotten their old jealousy about Cadiz, and asked for\r\naid. Wellington, though loath to spare a man from Portugal, sent them\r\nin the early days of February three British[145] and two Portuguese\r\nbattalions from Lisbon, under General William Stewart. So promptly\r\nwere these troops shipped and landed, that they arrived at Cadiz\r\nbetween the 10th and the 15th of February, to the number of about\r\n3,500 bayonets[146]. Thus the town was placed in security from any\r\n_coup de main_ on Victor’s part.\r\n\r\n  [145] 79th, 2nd batt. 87th, and 94th regiments, and the 20th\r\n  Portuguese line regiment.\r\n\r\n  [146] See Wellington to Bart. Frère and General Stewart, from\r\n  Torres Vedras, Feb. 5th, and Vizeu, Feb. 27, 1810.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CADIZ AND ITS ENVIRONS.]\r\n\r\nThe internal situation in Cadiz, however, left much to be desired.\r\nThe town had elected a local Junta of defence, of which the governor\r\nVenegas was made President, and this body had frequent disputes\r\nwith the new Regency, nominated by the Central Junta at the time\r\nof its abdication, and also with Albuquerque, whom Venegas did not\r\nwish to recognize as his hierarchical superior. The local body could\r\nmake a fair show of objections to recognizing the legitimacy of the\r\nRegency: the old Central Junta itself had a doubtful origin, and the\r\ngovernment nominated by those of its members who had taken refuge in\r\nCadiz could not claim a clear title. But to raise the point at this\r\nmoment of crisis was factious and unpatriotic, and the conduct of the\r\nlocal Junta became merely absurd when it tried to arrogate to itself\r\nauthority extending outside its own city, and to issue orders to\r\nthe outlying provinces, or the colonies of America. Still worse, it\r\nrefused to issue clothing and footgear to Albuquerque’s army, whose\r\nequipment had been worn out by the long march from Estremadura, or\r\nto subsidize the military hospitals, though it had a considerable\r\nstock both of money and of military stores at its disposition. At the\r\nend of February the Regency nominated Venegas Viceroy of Mexico, and\r\nhaving bought him off with this splendid piece of preferment, made\r\nAlbuquerque his successor in the governorship of Cadiz. But even thus\r\nthey did not succeed in getting proper control over the city, for the\r\nJunta refused to allow the Duke to place his head quarters within the\r\nwalls, or to issue orders to the civic militia. A _modus vivendi_\r\nwas only reached when the Regents made an ignominious pact with the\r\nlocal oligarchy, by which the latter, in return for recognizing their\r\nlegitimate authority, and undertaking to pay and feed the garrison,\r\nwere granted the control of the port-revenues and other royal taxes\r\nof Cadiz, as well as of all the subsidies arriving from America. How\r\nthe functions of government became still further complicated, when\r\nthe members of the long-expected Cortes began to arrive, and to claim\r\ntheir rights as the sole legitimate representatives of the nation,\r\nmust be told in another chapter[147].\r\n\r\n  [147] For a scathing account of the conduct of the Cadiz Junta\r\n  and its doings see Schepeler, vol. iii. 550-5. Napier very\r\n  rightly calls it ‘an imperious body without honour, talents, or\r\n  patriotism’ (ii. 334).\r\n\r\nLeaving matters at a deadlock in and about Cadiz, we must turn back\r\nto the operations of the French in the outlying parts of Andalusia.\r\nSebastiani, it will be remembered, had taken Jaen on January 23rd.\r\nHe was directed to march from thence on Granada and Malaga, to\r\nscatter the remains of Areizaga’s army, and to subdue the valleys\r\nof the Sierra Nevada and the long sea-coast below them. All this\r\nhe accomplished with ease. On the 28th he routed at Alcala la Real\r\na force composed of some of Areizaga’s fugitives, which had been\r\njoined by Freire and all the cavalry of the Andalusian army. These\r\nregiments, which had been cantoned in the valley of the Guadalquivir,\r\nsince they were useless in the passes, had been collected by Freire\r\nto the number of 2,000 sabres. They were routed and dispersed by\r\nMilhaud’s and Perreymond’s dragoons and chasseurs, losing over 500\r\nmen and the whole of their artillery. The survivors dispersed, and\r\nretired in small parties eastward, only rallying in the province of\r\nMurcia. That same evening Sebastiani pushed on towards Granada, and\r\nwas met by a deputation of its magistrates, who brought the keys of\r\nthe city and a promise of submission. The French vanguard entered it\r\nnext day. Lacy, who had taken refuge there with the small remains\r\nof his division, retired to Guadix. Sebastiani levied a military\r\ncontribution of 5,000,000 reals on the city, placed a garrison of\r\n1,500 men in the Alhambra, and marched with a mixed force on Malaga,\r\nthe only place in this quarter where organized resistance showed\r\nitself. Here the local magistrates had been deposed by a popular\r\nrising, and several thousand irregulars had been collected by a\r\nColonel Abello, a Capuchin friar named Fernando Berrocal, and three\r\nbrothers, notaries, of the name of San Millan. They seized the passes\r\nof the Sierra de Alhama, and called all the hill-country to arms.\r\nSebastiani, marching by Antequera, cleared the passes on February\r\n5th, beat the half-armed insurgent bands outside the suburbs of\r\nMalaga, and stormed the town. He exacted a contribution of 12,000,000\r\nreals, and hung the three San Millans and several other leading\r\ninsurgents. After this he extended his troops along the coast, and\r\noccupied Velez Malaga, Motril, and Almunecar. The roads and the\r\ntowns were his, but many of the insurgents took to the hills, and\r\nmaintained a guerrilla warfare, which never ceased throughout the\r\nnext three years. There were always bands on foot in the Alpujarras\r\nand the Sierra de Ronda, though the 4th Corps expended much energy\r\nin hunting them down.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Giron, Lacy, Freire, and the rest of the fugitive generals\r\nhad retired eastward. They had now come under the orders of Blake,\r\nwho superseded Areizaga and took over charge of 3,000 or 4,000\r\ndispirited men at Guadix on January 30th. He retired at once within\r\nthe borders of the kingdom of Murcia. Small parties and stragglers\r\ncontinued to come in for many weeks, and by March there were 10,000\r\nfoot and 1,500 horse collected--all in the worst state of equipment,\r\nand thoroughly demoralized by their late disasters.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the other end of Andalusia: King Joseph, when\r\ndeparting to inspect the outworks of Cadiz, had left Mortier in\r\ncommand in this quarter. The Marshal, after hunting the little force\r\nof the Visconde de Gand out of the Condado de Niebla, had been\r\ndirected to deal a stroke at Badajoz. Accordingly, leaving a brigade\r\nin Seville and another in the Condado, he marched with one infantry\r\ndivision and his light cavalry into Estremadura. He reached Olivenza\r\nwith 9,000 men, and summoned Badajoz on February 12th, but he had\r\narrived too late. A considerable Spanish force was now before him,\r\nthe old host of Del Parque, which the Central Junta had called down\r\nto the Guadiana when the original Army of Estremadura marched under\r\nAlbuquerque to succour Andalusia. How Mortier and La Romana, the\r\nsuccessor of Del Parque, dealt with each other in the months of the\r\nspring must be told in a later chapter[148].\r\n\r\n  [148] See Section xix, chapter iv of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe King, meanwhile, spent the months of February and March in a\r\ncircular tour through Andalusia, where he affected to perceive\r\nnothing but friendly feeling among the inhabitants. He visited\r\nRonda, Malaga, Granada, Jaen, celebrating _Te Deums_, and giving\r\nbull-fights and banquets. It is certain that a sufficient show of\r\nsubmission was made to nourish his happy illusions as to the finality\r\nof his conquest. Threats or bribes induced many notables to present\r\nthemselves at his receptions, and it seems that a considerable\r\nportion of the Andalusians hoped to save themselves from the rapacity\r\nof the military authorities by professing an enthusiasm for the\r\nKing. He, for his part, did his best to protect them--but he was\r\nsoon gone, and the native officials whom he appointed were powerless\r\nagainst Sebastiani, the church plunderer, and Soult, the judicious\r\ncollector of works of art. ‘At the very moment when the King was\r\nlavishing assurances and promises,’ writes his devoted servant Miot,\r\n‘and everywhere extolling the thorough disinterestedness of France,\r\nsevere and crushing exactions were being laid on the provinces in our\r\noccupation. An iron hand was grinding them to the dust. The King was\r\npowerless to resist the open violation of the promises which he was\r\ndaily giving[149].’\r\n\r\n  [149] Miot, ii. 432. Compare Joseph’s hysterical letter to\r\n  the Emperor (Ducasse, vii. 236): ‘La pacification générale de\r\n  l’Andalousie sera opérée.... Mais, sire, au nom du sang français\r\n  et du sang espagnol rappelez Loison, Kellermann, Thouvenot! Ces\r\n  hommes nous coûtent bien cher!’ It is curious that he, in the\r\n  same letter, quotes as ‘hommes honnêtes,’ along with Mortier,\r\n  Suchet, and Reynier, both Soult and Sebastiani, who were\r\n  plunderers on as large a scale as Kellermann or Loison.\r\n\r\nOpen resistance, however, had ceased, save at Cadiz and in the\r\ninaccessible recesses of the Sierra Nevada. Andalusia had been\r\nsubdued from end to end, and neither the King nor Soult yet realized\r\nthat a lamentable strategic mistake had been made when 70,000 veteran\r\ntroops had been pinned down to garrison the newly conquered realm,\r\nwhile Portugal and Wellington’s army remained untouched. In their\r\nconception, as in that of the Emperor, the conquest of Portugal was\r\nto be sufficiently provided for by the new reinforcements which were\r\nnow pouring over the Ebro, to the number of over 100,000 sabres and\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX\r\n\r\nTHE PORTUGUESE CAMPAIGN OF 1810.\r\n\r\nTHE PRELIMINARIES: JANUARY-AUGUST 1810\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY GEOGRAPHY OF PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe continual existence of Portugal down to the present day in\r\nface of the persistent hostility and immensely superior force of\r\nits neighbour Spain seems at first sight to be one of the most\r\ninexplicable phenomena in modern history. It appears all the more\r\nastounding when we remember that the lesser kingdom was once\r\nconquered, and held down for sixty years, by the greater power.\r\nFew states have won back and maintained their independence in such\r\nmasterful fashion as did Portugal, in the long ‘War of Independence’\r\nthat followed the insurrection of 1640 under the house of Braganza.\r\nBut intense national spirit and heroic obstinacy on the part of the\r\nsmaller people are not sufficient to account for the survival of the\r\nPortuguese kingdom as a separate entity. Its geography, which at the\r\nfirst sight seems hopelessly unfavourable to its defence, turns out\r\non investigation to be eminently suitable for resistance against an\r\nattack from the east. On a first glance at the map it appears as if\r\nPortugal was composed of no more than the lower valleys of three\r\ngreat Spanish rivers, the Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana, so\r\nthat the state which owns three-quarters of the course of each of\r\nthese streams has but to send down its armies from the uplands of\r\nLeon and New Castile, to conquer the narrow land which lies about\r\ntheir estuaries. But nothing can be more deceptive than the map, when\r\nthe Iberian Peninsula is in question. As we observed in our earlier\r\nvolume[150], the rivers of Spain and Portugal are not highways, or\r\nlines of communication, but barriers--torrents sunk in gorges cut\r\ndeep below the level of the face of the land. The chief roads, with\r\nfew exceptions, avoid, instead of courting, the neighbourhood of\r\nthe great streams. The leading routes which descend from Spain into\r\nPortugal in no case follow the lines of the Douro or the Tagus.\r\nThough the coast-plains, which form the heart of the kingdom of\r\nPortugal, its most wealthy and populous regions, lie about the mouths\r\nof those rivers, it is not by descending their banks that conquest\r\nor trade arrives most easily at its goal. As a matter of fact, Spain\r\nand Portugal turn their backs upon each other: the smaller realm\r\nlooks out upon the sea; her strength and wealth lie upon the Atlantic\r\ncoast: the inland that touches Spain is rugged and unpeopled, in many\r\nparts a mere waste of rock and heath. Nor, on the other hand, do\r\nLeon and New Castile look towards Portugal: the real ports of Madrid\r\nare Valencia and Alicante, not Lisbon, and that not from political\r\nreasons, but simply because those are the points where the sea can\r\nbe reached with the minimum of mountain and desert to be passed\r\nthrough. The way down from the central tableland of Spain to the\r\nMediterranean is less difficult than the way down to the Atlantic.\r\nHence comes the fact that the high-roads leading from Spain into\r\nPortugal are so surprisingly few, and that the two main alternative\r\nroutes from Madrid to Lisbon run, the one much further north, the\r\nother much further south, than might have been expected. There is not\r\nnow, and never has been, any straight road down the Tagus between\r\nthe two capitals, obvious though the line looks upon the map. The\r\ntwo main gates of Portugal are at Almeida and Elvas; at Alcantara,\r\nwhich appears the natural point of approach, there is but the most\r\nmiserable of posterns--as Junot discovered in November 1807, much to\r\nhis discomfiture. Marshal Berwick had made the same experience in\r\n1705, during the War of the Spanish Succession[151].\r\n\r\n  [150] See vol. i. pp. 75, 76.\r\n\r\n  [151] A student of the War of the Spanish Succession is always\r\n  surprised to see how much fighting took place on fronts which\r\n  were left severely alone by the English and French in 1809-12.\r\n\r\nIn the old wars between Spain and Portugal the whole land frontier of\r\nthe smaller kingdom was exposed to attacks from the larger. But the\r\ncircumstances of 1810 differed from those of 1705 or 1762 or 1801,\r\nin that the subsidiary campaigns in the extreme north and south,\r\nwhich had always accompanied the main clash along the frontiers of\r\nBeira and Alemtejo, could not on this occasion take place. The French\r\nwere no longer in possession of Galicia, from which the Spaniards had\r\nbeen wont to demonstrate against Oporto, nor, at the other extremity\r\nof the line, had they a firm grip on Huelva, and the Condado de\r\nNiebla, from which alone an attack could be directed against the\r\nremote southern province of Algarve.\r\n\r\nPortugal presents three sections of frontier to an invader coming\r\nfrom the side of Spain. The northernmost, that from the mouth of the\r\nMinho to Miranda-de-Douro, was not within the scope of operations\r\nin 1810. It can only be approached from Galicia; that province was\r\nnot subdued, nor had the French any intention of dealing with it\r\ntill after they should have dealt with Portugal. An invasion of\r\nthe Tras-os-Montes and the Entre-Douro-e-Minho would have been an\r\nobjectless operation: they would fall of themselves if once Lisbon\r\nwere captured and the English expelled from the Peninsula. A move\r\nagainst Oporto by some flanking division of the invading army might\r\nhave been conceivable, but such an attempt would be made, if made at\r\nall, from the south of the Douro, through northern Beira, and not\r\nthrough the mountains of the Tras-os-Montes.\r\n\r\nThere remain two other sections of the Portuguese frontier: the\r\none from the Douro to the Tagus, and the other from the Tagus to\r\nthe Guadiana. Both of these were accessible to the French in 1810,\r\nsince they were in possession alike of the plains of Leon and of La\r\nMancha, and of northern Andalusia. It was open to them to choose one\r\nor the other front for attack, or to attack both at once. Lisbon\r\nbeing the objective, it was clear that an attack on the northern or\r\nBeira frontier possessed a paramount advantage over an attack on\r\nthe southern or Alemtejo frontier. A successful advance north of\r\nthe Tagus brings the invader directly to the gates of Lisbon; one\r\nsouth of the Tagus brings him only to the heights of Almada, where\r\nhe is separated from the Portuguese capital by the broad estuary of\r\nthe Tagus. Napoleon’s power, like that of the devil in mediaeval\r\nlegends, ended at the edge of the salt water; and in face of the\r\nnaval strength which the English always maintained at Lisbon, a\r\nvictorious French army camped on the heights of Almada would be\r\nalmost as far from final success as when it started from Spain. The\r\n1,900 yards of strait which protected the Portuguese capital could\r\nnot be crossed. The most that the invader could accomplish would\r\nbe to worry the ships in the port, and the lower quarters of the\r\ncity, by a distant bombardment, if he could bring up heavy guns from\r\nSpain[152]. For nearly twenty miles inland from Lisbon the estuary of\r\nthe Tagus expands into a broad brackish lagoon four to eleven miles\r\nbroad, a complete protection against any attack from the east. Only\r\nat Alhandra does this inland sea contract, and for some further miles\r\nnorthward from that point the eastern bank of the Tagus is formed\r\nby broad salt-marshes (_lezirias_) cut up by countless channels of\r\nwater, and practically inaccessible. It is only at Salvaterra, thirty\r\nmiles north of Lisbon, that the Tagus assumes its ordinary breadth,\r\nand becomes an ordinary military obstacle. From that point upwards\r\nan invader from the Andalusian side might endeavour to cross it,\r\nand it presents no more difficulties than any other broad river.\r\nBut, though even Rhines and Danubes may be passed in the face of\r\nan enemy, the operation is not one which a prudent general courts,\r\nand the Tagus is broad, absolutely bridgeless, and fickle in the\r\nextreme in its alternations of high and low water. To fight one’s\r\nway from the valley of the Guadiana in order to meet such a problem\r\nat the end does not seem inviting. And even if the Tagus is passed,\r\nthere are still thirty miles of road, including some formidable\r\ndefensive positions, between the invader and Lisbon[153]. Yet there\r\nwas one contingency under which an advance on the left bank of the\r\nriver might be advantageous to the invader, and so possible was this\r\ncontingency that Wellington from the very first had declared that\r\nhe thought it probable that the French would move troops in that\r\ndirection. If the Anglo-Portuguese army were drawn away to the Beira\r\nfrontier, between Tagus and Douro, in order to resist a front attack\r\ndelivered from the plains of Leon, and if it became involved in an\r\nactive campaign somewhere far to the north, on the line of the Coa,\r\nor the Mondego, or the Alva, a subsidiary French force, striking\r\nsouth of the Tagus from the direction of Spanish Estremadura, might\r\ngive dreadful trouble. If it could cross the Tagus anywhere between\r\nAbrantes and Salvaterra, it might get between the Anglo-Portuguese\r\narmy and its base, and either fall upon its rear or capture Lisbon.\r\nFor this reason Wellington, so far back as October 1809, had made\r\nup his mind that, if the French had an army on foot anywhere in\r\nthe direction of Badajoz and Elvas, he must leave a considerable\r\nproportion of his own forces to watch them, and to defend, if need\r\nbe, the line of the lower Tagus[154]. As long as the enemy had not\r\nyet subdued Badajoz and the neighbouring fortresses, and while\r\nthere was still a strong Spanish army in that quarter, the need for\r\nprecaution was not so pressing. Nevertheless, all through the summer\r\nof 1810 Wellington kept Hill with one English and one Portuguese\r\ndivision at Portalegre, south of the Tagus, though he withdrew this\r\ndetachment when Masséna marched on Coimbra. Matters were much more\r\nperilous after the battle of the Gebora and the fall of Badajoz in\r\nFebruary 1811. From that time onward, all through 1811 and 1812,\r\nnearly a third of the Anglo-Portuguese army was kept in the Alemtejo,\r\nfirst under Beresford, then under Hill, in order to guard against\r\nthe possible stab in the back from the French army of Andalusia.\r\n\r\n  [152] See Map of the Lines of Torres Vedras, in Section xx of\r\n  this volume, for the environs of Lisbon.\r\n\r\n  [153] Eliot, in his very judicious remarks on p. 100 of his\r\n  _Defence of Portugal_, published just before Masséna’s invasion,\r\n  sums up the situation with--‘a passage may without any difficulty\r\n  be forced to the left bank of the Tagus: but then the enemy is as\r\n  far from the accomplishment of his project as before, the river\r\n  forming an insuperable barrier if well defended.’\r\n\r\n  [154] Wellington to Col. Fletcher, commanding Royal Engineers,\r\n  Oct. 20, 1809 (_Dispatches_, v. 235): ‘The enemy will probably\r\n  attack on two distinct lines, the one south, the other north of\r\n  the Tagus, and the system of defence must be founded upon this\r\n  general basis.... His object will be, by means of the corps south\r\n  of the Tagus, to turn the positions which we shall take up in\r\n  front of the corps north of that river, to cut off from Lisbon\r\n  the corps opposed to him, and to destroy it by an attack in front\r\n  and rear. This can be avoided only by the retreat of the right,\r\n  centre, and left of the allies to a point at which (from the\r\n  state of the river) they cannot be turned, by the passage of the\r\n  Tagus by the enemy’s left corps.’\r\n\r\n  Six days later (_Disp._ v. 245) Wellington wrote to Admiral\r\n  Berkeley in similar terms: ‘It is probable that in the event\r\n  of the enemy being enabled to invade this country in force, he\r\n  will make his main attack by the right of the Tagus: but he\r\n  will employ one corps on the left of the river, with the object\r\n  of embarrassing, if not of preventing, the embarcation of the\r\n  British army.’\r\n\r\nBut the attack south of the Tagus was in Wellington’s, and also, we\r\nmay add, in Napoleon’s conception[155], only a secondary operation.\r\nThe main invasion was almost inevitably bound to take place on the\r\nBeira, not on the Alemtejo frontier. Between Fregeneda, where the\r\nPortuguese border line quits the Douro, to the pass of Villa Velha\r\non the Tagus there is a distance of somewhat more than 100 miles.\r\nThe division between Portugal and Spain does not lie along any\r\nwell-marked natural feature, such as a mountain range or a broad\r\nriver--though two small sections of the frontier are coincident with\r\nthe insignificant streams of the Elga and the Agueda. It is rather\r\ndrawn, in a somewhat arbitrary and haphazard fashion, through the\r\nmidst of the desert upland, where Spain and Portugal turn their\r\nbacks to each other. For the only piece of flat plain-land on the\r\nwhole border is that from the Douro to Almeida, a mere ten or twelve\r\nmiles, and immediately behind the Coa, only three or four miles\r\nfrom Almeida, the mountains begin. The rest of the frontier runs\r\nthrough thinly-peopled, barren highlands, from which the Coa, the\r\nMondego, the Zezere, and the Ponçul fall away towards Portugal, and\r\nthe Agueda and the Alagon towards Spain. The mountains are not,\r\nfor the most part, very high--the culminating peak of the Serra da\r\nEstrella is only 6,540 feet--but they are singularly rugged and\r\nscarped, and much cleft by ravines, along whose sides the few roads\r\ncrawl miserably, in constant precipitous dips and rises. This broad\r\nbelt of upland, one long series of defiles for an invader, is some\r\nhundred miles broad, and does not cease till Coimbra, on the one\r\nside, or Abrantes, on the other, is reached: only then does the\r\nplain-land begin, and the country-side become fertile and thickly\r\npeopled. Only from those points onward is it possible for an army\r\nto live on the local produce: in the upland it must carry its food\r\nwith it; for a single division would exhaust in a day the stores of\r\nthe poor villages of the mountains; and the small poverty-stricken\r\ntowns of Guarda, Celorico, Sabugal, Penamacor, and Idanha have few\r\nresources. Castello Branco and Vizeu are the only two places in the\r\nupland where there is a valley of some breadth and richness, which\r\ncan supply an army for many days. In this simple fact lies the\r\nexplanation of the difficulties of the Portuguese campaigns of 1810\r\nand 1811. Both the invader and the defender must bring their food\r\nwith them, and protracted operations can only be kept up by means\r\nof incessant convoys from the rear. The campaign not infrequently\r\nbecame a starving-match, and the combatant who first exhausted his\r\nprovisions had to retire, and to disperse his divisions in search of\r\nthe wherewithal to live. Thanks to Wellington’s providence it was\r\nalways the French who were forced to this expedient.\r\n\r\n  [155] So much so that in _Corresp._, xx. p. 552, we find him\r\n  informing Masséna that Badajoz and Elvas need not be touched till\r\n  after Lisbon has fallen. The first contrary view, ordering a\r\n  demonstration on the Lower Tagus, appears in the dispatch on p.\r\n  273 of vol. xxi.\r\n\r\nThe Beira frontier is divided into two sections by the range of\r\nmountains which crosses the border at right angles, half way between\r\nDouro and Tagus: it is known as the Sierras de Gata and de Jarama\r\nwhile in Spain, as the Serra da Estrella when it reaches Portugal.\r\nIts central ganglion lies between the high-lying towns of Sabugal\r\nand Penamacor in Portugal and the pass of Perales in Spain. From\r\nthis point run off the great spurs which separate the valleys of\r\nthe Ponçul, the Zezere, the Agueda, the Coa, and the Alagon. An\r\ninvader must make his choice whether he will advance into Portugal\r\nsouth or north of the Serra da Estrella: to attempt to do so on both\r\nsides of the range would be risking too much, if there is an enemy\r\nof any strength in the field, since the columns to the right and to\r\nthe left would be hopelessly separated, and liable to be beaten in\r\ndetail. In the whole Peninsular War there was only one invasion made\r\nby the southern route, that of Junot in the winter of 1807-8. It was\r\nsuccessful because it was absolutely unopposed. Nevertheless the\r\nFrench lost many men, had to leave their artillery behind them, and\r\nonly arrived with the shadow of an army at Abrantes. It is true that\r\nJunot chose absolutely the worst path that could be found between the\r\nSerra da Estrella and the Tagus--the pass of Rosmarinhal, close above\r\nthe latter river--and that he would have fared not quite so badly if\r\nhe had marched from Zarza on Idanha and Castello Branco. But even at\r\nthe best this region is most inhospitable: there are points where\r\nwater is not procurable on stretches of eight or ten miles, others\r\nwhere the main road is so steep that a six-pounder requires not\r\nonly a dozen horses but the assistance of fifty men to get it up the\r\nslope. Except in the immediate neighbourhood of Castello Branco, the\r\ncountry-side is almost uninhabited[156]. The whole ‘corregidoria,’\r\nwhich took its name from that town, and extended from the Elga to the\r\nZezere, had only 40,000 souls in its broad limits--it was forty miles\r\nlong by thirty broad, the size of a large English county. Junot’s\r\nexperiences served as a warning to his successors, and no French\r\narmy during the rest of the war endeavoured to cross this corner of\r\nPortugal when advancing on Lisbon. Castello Branco was seized once or\r\ntwice by a raiding force, but it was never used as the starting-point\r\nof an army making a serious attempt to advance towards the Portuguese\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n  [156] The above notes on the Castello Branco country and its\r\n  roads are mostly derived from Eliot’s _Defence of Portugal_.\r\n  Eliot has marched all over the region; see his pages 78-81.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be considered only the section of the frontier\r\nbetween the Douro and the Serra da Estrella, the front on which\r\nMasséna’s great blow was delivered in the autumn of 1810. It was\r\na region which had from the earliest times been the battle-ground\r\nof the Spanish and Portuguese. Half a dozen times since the Middle\r\nAges armies from the plains of Leon had invaded the Beira on this\r\nfront. Such campaigns always began with a siege of Almeida, the\r\nsentinel-fortress pushed out in front of the mountains to face the\r\nSpanish Ciudad Rodrigo. Almeida generally fell--it is too advanced a\r\nposition for safety, and (as Dumouriez remarked in his military study\r\nof Portugal) its value would have doubled if it had only been placed\r\nupon the west instead of the east bank of the Coa, close to the\r\nfriendly mountains, and not on the outskirts of the perilous plain.\r\nBut rare, indeed, were the occasions on which the Spaniard succeeded\r\nin piercing the broad belt of tangled upland beyond Almeida, and\r\nappearing at the gates of Coimbra or Oporto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRAL PORTUGAL.]\r\n\r\nThere are four lines of further advance open to an invader who has\r\ncaptured Almeida. The first, a march on Oporto via Pinhel and Lamego,\r\nmay be mentioned only to be dismissed from consideration. It is of\r\nno use to an army which aims at Lisbon, and proposes to conquer\r\nPortugal by a blow at its heart. Masséna, whose directions were to\r\ndrive the British into the sea in the shortest and most effective\r\nfashion, could not have contemplated such a secondary object as the\r\ncapture of Oporto for a moment. There remain three other roads to be\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n(1) The road north of the river Mondego, by Celorico, Vizeu, Bussaco,\r\nand Coimbra. (2) The corresponding and parallel road south of the\r\nMondego, from Celorico by Chamusca, Maceira and Ponte de Murcella to\r\nCoimbra. (3) The road which, striking south from Celorico, crosses\r\nthe headwaters of the Zezere, by Belmonte and Fundão, and then,\r\nclimbing the Serra de Moradal, descends to Castello Branco, and from\r\nthence reaches Abrantes by the Sobreira Formosa. It may be remarked,\r\nby the way, that nothing in all the geography of Portugal seems more\r\nastonishing than that there should not be a fourth alternative road,\r\none down the long valley of the Zezere, which, running in a straight\r\nline from Belmonte to Abrantes, looks on the map as if it ought to\r\nbe a main artery of communication, and seems to indicate the obvious\r\nroad to Lisbon from Almeida, since a straight line drawn between\r\nthese points would run along the river for some forty miles. But as a\r\nmatter of fact there was neither a first nor a second-rate road down\r\nthe Zezere: the only towns on its course, Covilhão and Belmonte, lie\r\nhard by its sources, and its central reaches were almost uninhabited.\r\nThe only good line of communication running near it is a by-road or\r\nduplication of the third route mentioned above, called the _Estrada\r\nNova_, which, leaving the upper Zezere at Belmonte, keeps high up\r\nthe side of the Serra de Moradal, and rejoins the Castello Branco\r\nroad at Sobreira Formosa. This route was much employed by Wellington\r\nin later years, as a military road from north to south, usable even\r\nwhen Castello Branco was threatened by the French. But in 1810 he\r\nhad ordered it to be rendered impassable, and this had been done by\r\nmaking several long cuttings at points where the track passed along\r\nprecipices, the whole roadway being blown or shovelled down into\r\nthe gulf below[157]. The French were, of course, unaware of this,\r\nand Masséna is said by his confidant Foy to have taken the _Estrada\r\nNova_ into serious consideration, and to have decided against it\r\nbecause of the necessity for forcing the passage of the Zezere when\r\nthe defiles were passed, and for laying siege to Abrantes[158].\r\nA far more practical objection was its extreme wildness: it runs\r\nalong an absolutely uninhabited mountain-side, and the neighbourhood\r\nis destitute not only of food but of water for great sections of\r\nits length. This Masséna ought to have known, if his Portuguese\r\nadvisers had been competent. Apparently he was wholly unaware of its\r\ncharacter, just as he was necessarily ignorant of the fact that his\r\nprescient adversary had blasted away huge sections of it, so that it\r\nwas absolutely impassable for guns or wagons, as also that earthworks\r\nhad been carefully constructed to cover the point where it debouches\r\non to the Zezere.\r\n\r\n  [157] For the perilous adventure among these cuttings of a\r\n  small French column which crossed the Estrada Nova, that which\r\n  escorted Foy back to Santarem in Feb. 1811, see the autobiography\r\n  of General Hulot, pp. 325-33. A considerable number of men and\r\n  horses fell down these cuttings in a forced night-march, and in\r\n  all several hundred men of Foy’s column perished, starved and\r\n  storm-beaten on this inhospitable road. The survivors only got\r\n  through by cutting a slippery foot-track along the precipices:\r\n  nothing on wheels could have passed that way.\r\n\r\n  [158] In Foy’s interesting minute of his conversation with\r\n  Napoleon about the invasion, on Nov. 23, 1810, when he had taken\r\n  home Masséna’s dispatches: ‘Montrez-moi les deux routes de Ponte\r\n  de Murcella et de Castello Branco,’ says the Emperor. Then after\r\n  a pause: ‘Et l’Estrada Nova? Pourquoi Masséna n’a-t-il pas\r\n  débouché par l’Estrada Nova?’--‘Sire, à cause d’Abrantès et du\r\n  Zézère.’--‘Oui, Masséna a bien fait; maintenant il faut prendre\r\n  Abrantès: Elvas ne nous servirait de rien.’ See Foy’s _Mémoires_,\r\n  p. 111.\r\n\r\nThe Castello Branco road, therefore, with this dependent by-road,\r\nthe Estrada Nova, was practically left out of consideration by\r\nthe Marshal. There remains the choice between the two northern\r\nroutes, Celorico-Vizeu-Coimbra, and Celorico-Chamusca-Ponte de\r\nMurcella-Coimbra. Both traverse rough ground--but ground less rough\r\nthan that to be found on some parts of the Castello Branco road.\r\nAlong both there is an intermittent belt of cultivated land, and\r\nnot unfrequent villages. Both are intersected by many good military\r\npositions, on which a defending army can offer battle to an invader\r\nwith advantage. In especial, the northern road strikes and climbs the\r\ngranite ridge of Bussaco with every disadvantage for the attacking\r\nside, and the southern road is contracted into a difficult defile\r\nat the passage of the Alva near Ponte de Murcella. On the whole,\r\nhowever, this last is the better line for advance:--the strongest\r\ntestimonial to the fact is that Wellington expected Masséna to take\r\nit, and erected at the passage of the Alva almost[159] the only\r\nearthworks, save those of the lines of Torres Vedras, which he\r\nconstructed in his preparations for the reception of the invader.\r\nWhen he first heard that the Marshal was moving forward from\r\nAlmeida to Celorico, and was clearly aiming at the Mondego valley,\r\nhe announced that he should endeavour to stop the invader on the\r\nAlva[160], not apparently thinking it at all probable that Masséna\r\nwould move by Vizeu and the north bank of the Mondego. On realizing\r\nthat this was really his adversary’s design, he observed with some\r\nexultation that, while there were certainly many bad roads in\r\nPortugal, the enemy had taken decidedly the worst of those open to\r\nhim[161]; moreover, he had committed himself to attack the heights\r\nof Bussaco, the most formidable position in the whole of northern\r\nPortugal. How the French commander came to make this choice we shall\r\ndiscuss in its proper place. Suffice it to say that Wellington had\r\nnot realized how bad was Masséna’s information, how worthless his\r\nmaps, and--what is most surprising of all--how entirely destitute of\r\nlocal knowledge were the Portuguese traitors--Alorna, Pamplona, and\r\nthe other renegade officers--whom the Emperor had sent as guides and\r\nadvisers to the Marshal. And in truth, the unsuspected ignorance of\r\nMasséna and his advisers added an incalculable element of chance to\r\nthe problem set before Wellington. He was obliged to make his plans\r\non the hypothesis that the enemy would make the correct move: and not\r\nunfrequently the enemy, for reasons which the English general could\r\nnot possibly foresee, made the wrong one.\r\n\r\n  [159] There were some others thrown up on the extreme lower\r\n  course of the Zezere, by Barca Nova and Punhete, to guard against\r\n  a possible but unlikely use of the Castello Branco road by the\r\n  enemy.\r\n\r\n  [160] Wellington to Hill (_Disp._, vi. p. 441), Sept. 15.\r\n\r\n  [161] Wellington to Chas. Stuart, Sept. 18.\r\n\r\nThe French invasion was bound to commence with a preliminary\r\nclearance of the outlying fortresses still in the hands of the\r\nSpaniards. These to some extent protected the Portuguese frontier\r\nin 1810, though they had been built with the express purpose, not\r\nof protecting, but of threatening it, and had never before been\r\nattacked by an enemy coming from the east. Only three of these\r\nfortresses were of any importance--Astorga, Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nBadajoz. The other strongholds of Spanish Estremadura, Alcantara\r\n(which had stood a siege in the War of the Spanish Succession),\r\nAlbuquerque, Olivenza, were either not in a state of defence at all,\r\nor were hopelessly antiquated, and little suited to face modern\r\nartillery and modern siegecraft.\r\n\r\nAstorga lies so far to the north that it might have been neglected\r\nwithout much peril to the French scheme of invasion. But the Emperor\r\nhad ordered that it should be reduced before the great enterprise\r\nbegan: it gave the Spanish army of Galicia a foothold in the plains\r\nof Leon, from which it might operate against Masséna’s rear, if he\r\nshould pass it by. Its capture, too, was considered a matter of\r\nsmall difficulty, for it was but a mediaeval walled town, to which\r\nsome hasty outworks had been added during the last year. It will be\r\nremembered that when Moore passed that way in January 1809, Astorga\r\nhad been treated by both sides as an open town, and no attempt had\r\nbeen made to garrison or defend it. Since then La Romana had repaired\r\nits dilapidated enceinte, stockaded its suburbs, and armed it with\r\nguns brought from Ferrol. As late as January 11, 1810, Napoleon\r\nseems hardly aware of this fact: in a dispatch of that date he\r\norders Loison to make his head quarters there, evidently under the\r\nimpression that it is not held by the Spaniards, or at least that\r\nit is a place which they will evacuate at the first appearance of a\r\nserious attack[162]. It is only in March that he writes to Junot that\r\nAstorga must be besieged and taken, in order to occupy the attention\r\nof the Galicians and to thrust them back into their mountains[163].\r\n\r\n  [162] _Nap. Corresp._, xx. p. 117. Napoleon to Berthier.\r\n\r\n  [163] Ibid., p. 271.\r\n\r\nCiudad Rodrigo was a more serious business. It was a regular\r\nfortress, though only one of the second class; its prestige, as the\r\nonly Spanish stronghold on the Portuguese frontier, was great. It\r\ncommands the whole southern stretch of the plains of Leon, being\r\nthe only place out of the control of an invader who is superior in\r\ncavalry, and therefore master of the defenceless _Tierra de Campos_.\r\nThere was also a small Spanish army depending upon it, and clinging\r\nto the skirts of the Sierra de Gata. This was the division of Martin\r\nde la Carrera, which had been left behind when the greater part\r\nof Del Parque’s Army of the Left marched down into Estremadura in\r\nJanuary 1810, in order to replace there the troops which had gone\r\noff to the defence of Cadiz. It was clear that Ciudad Rodrigo must\r\nbe taken, and Martin de la Carrera brushed away or destroyed, before\r\nany serious attempt to invade Portugal was begun. If the Emperor\r\nthought that such a remote place as Astorga was worth his notice,\r\nit was obvious that he would regard Ciudad Rodrigo as absolutely\r\nindispensable to his designs. It was for its reduction that he gave\r\nMasséna the great battering train of fifty heavy guns, with 2,500\r\nartillerymen and sappers, which was assigned to him, independent of\r\nthe artillery of the three corps of the Army of Portugal.\r\n\r\nBadajoz, far to the south, in Spanish Estremadura, stood to the\r\ndefence of Southern Portugal exactly as Ciudad Rodrigo to the defence\r\nof Northern Portugal. It possessed also in Elvas a counterpart to\r\nAlmeida. But Badajoz is immensely larger and stronger than Rodrigo,\r\njust as Elvas is infinitely more formidable than Almeida. The two\r\nfortresses on the frontier of Leon are small places crowning mere\r\nmounds set in a plain. Badajoz and Elvas have towering citadels\r\nset on rugged hills, and overlooking the whole country-side. They\r\nhave also strong detached forts on dominant positions: the circuit\r\nof ground that must be taken up by an army that intends to besiege\r\nthem is very large, and at Badajoz there is a first-class river,\r\nthe Guadiana, which cuts in two the lines which the assailant must\r\noccupy. It may be added that based on Badajoz there was a whole\r\nSpanish army of 15,000 men, not a mere division of 3,000, like that\r\nwhich lurked in the mountains above Rodrigo. Noting the strength of\r\nBadajoz and Elvas, the Emperor had made up his mind that they should\r\nbe observed and ‘contained’ by troops from the Army of Andalusia,\r\nbut not attacked till Lisbon had been conquered and the English\r\nexpelled from Portugal. ‘Les Anglais une fois battus et rembarqués,\r\nBadajoz et Elvas tombent d’eux-mêmes,’ he wrote in a holograph minute\r\naddressed to Masséna, just before the advance across the Portuguese\r\nfrontier began[164]. It was only when the invasion had been brought\r\nto a standstill before the lines of Torres Vedras, that he came to\r\nthe conclusion that pressure must be applied south of the Tagus, to\r\ndistract Wellington, and that Soult, as a preliminary to an attack\r\non the Alemtejo, must capture Badajoz and Elvas, and disperse the\r\nSpanish Army of Estremadura. The idea came to him tardily: thanks to\r\nWellington’s careful starvation of the main French army, Masséna was\r\nforced to retreat into Leon when Soult had only recently captured\r\nBadajoz, and had not yet shown a man in front of Elvas. The scheme\r\nwas hatched, like so many of Napoleon’s Spanish plans, about three\r\nmonths too late for effective realization. As late as November 1810\r\nthe orders to Soult are merely to demonstrate against Badajoz, and\r\nto hinder the departure of La Romana’s army for the lines of Torres\r\nVedras, but not to besiege the Estremaduran fortress. Probably it was\r\nFoy’s information as to the existence and strength of the unsuspected\r\nlines of Torres Vedras, which reached him late in November, that made\r\nthe Emperor realize the advisability of that secondary attack by\r\nthe south bank of the Tagus which Wellington had foreseen and taken\r\nmeans to meet a full year before. Fortunately a capable general on\r\nthe defensive always knows his own weak spots long before they are\r\ndiscovered by the enemy. By the time that Soult had at last captured\r\nBadajoz and the small dependent places--Olivenza, Albuquerque, Campo\r\nMayor--Wellington had got rid of Masséna from the neighbourhood of\r\nLisbon, and was preparing to chase him home across Northern Portugal.\r\nWithin a few weeks of its surrender by the traitor Imaz, Badajoz was\r\nbeing besieged by a detachment of the British army, and Soult had\r\nhis hands full, as he strove at once to hold down Andalusia and to\r\nrelieve the beleaguered fortress.\r\n\r\n  [164] Napoleon to Masséna, July 29, 1810, _Corresp._, xx. p. 552.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far back as September 1809, while his army still lay at Badajoz\r\nand the Talavera campaign was hardly over, Wellington had foreseen\r\nthe oncoming invasion of Portugal, which did not actually begin till\r\nAugust 1810[165]. Writing to his brother, then on his special mission\r\nto Seville, he had laid down his conclusions. Bonaparte would, in\r\nconsequence of the cessation of the Austrian war, be enabled to\r\npour unlimited reinforcements into Spain. The British army, even\r\nif raised to 40,000 men, would not be strong enough to cover both\r\nSeville and Lisbon. Considering the temper of the Spanish government\r\nand the Spanish troops, he thought it would be most unadvisable to\r\ncommit himself to the defence of Andalusia. But he was prepared to\r\nundertake the defence of Portugal. He implored the British Ministry\r\nnot to sacrifice its strong position on the Tagus in order to\r\nembark upon a hazardous campaign in the South[166]. His views as to\r\nPortugal were simply the development of those which he had drawn up\r\nfor Castlereagh’s eye on his first sailing for the Peninsula[167].\r\nPortugal though ‘all frontier’ might be defended against any French\r\narmy of less than 100,000 men, if its resources were placed at his\r\ndisposal, and he were given a free hand to utilize them according\r\nto his own plan. The Portland Cabinet, though much doubting whether\r\nWellington could carry out his pledge, and though reluctant to\r\nabandon the idea that Andalusia might be defended and Cadiz made\r\nsecure by British troops, finally yielded to the General’s appeal.\r\n\r\n  [165] For his views just after Talavera see vol. ii. of this\r\n  work, pages 609-10.\r\n\r\n  [166] ‘I strongly recommend to you, unless you mean to incur the\r\n  risk of the loss of your army, not to have anything to do with\r\n  Spanish warfare, on any ground whatever, in the existing state\r\n  of things.... If you should take up Cadiz you must lay down\r\n  Portugal.’ Wellington to Castlereagh, _Dispatches_, v. 90.\r\n\r\n  [167] See vol. ii. pages 286-8.\r\n\r\nBut on December 2, 1809, the Portland Cabinet gave place to Spencer\r\nPerceval’s new administration, and Wellington had to reiterate\r\nthe arguments which he had used to Castlereagh and Canning to new\r\ncorrespondents, Lord Liverpool and Lord Bathurst. Fortunately the\r\nincoming ministers resolved to adhere to the promises made by their\r\npredecessors, and to persist in the defence of Portugal. It was of\r\nimmense value to Wellington that his brother Wellesley soon replaced\r\nLord Bathurst at the Foreign Office, so that he could command in\r\nthis Ministry a supporter as firm as Castlereagh had been in the\r\nlast. Nevertheless his position was not entirely fortunate: the\r\nnew administration was being fiercely assailed by the Whigs over\r\nthe general policy of risking British armies on the Continent. The\r\ncalamities of the Walcheren expedition supplied a text on which the\r\nOpposition could preach interminable sermons. The men who were not\r\nashamed to allege, for party reasons, that Wellington was a rash\r\ngeneral, and that the Talavera campaign had been a disaster, were\r\ncontinually harassing the Ministry, by their suggestions that when\r\nthe French Emperor marched in person to Spain the British army in the\r\nPeninsula must inevitably be destroyed. It was probably to aid them\r\nthat Napoleon kept inserting in the _Moniteur_ articles in which it\r\nwas asserted that the maintenance of the incapable ‘Sepoy General’ at\r\nthe head of the British forces was the thing which France must most\r\ndesire. In Lord Liverpool’s correspondence with Wellington it is easy\r\nto see that the idea that it might be necessary to evacuate Portugal,\r\nwhen the French attack was delivered, almost preponderated over that\r\nof preparing for the defence of that realm. While Wellington’s whole\r\nmind is set on working out the details of a campaign from which he\r\nhopes great things, his correspondent is always thinking of the\r\npossibility of a disastrous embarkation at the end of it. The General\r\ncould not pledge himself that Portugal might be defended against any\r\nodds whatever: it was possible that the Emperor might lead or send\r\nagainst him an army of absolutely overpowering strength, though he\r\ndid not think such a contingency probable. But since he could not\r\nsay that his position was impregnable, he was being continually\r\nworried with suggestions as to all the possible contingencies that\r\nmight occur to his discomfiture. The ministers dreaded that the\r\nPeninsular venture might end in a fiasco, like the Duke of York’s\r\nDutch expedition of 1799, and thought that such a failure would lose\r\nthem their offices. Hence they were nervous about every false rumour\r\nthat reached them from France concerning the Emperor’s approaching\r\ndeparture; and the more certain information about the immense numbers\r\nof troops that were passing the Pyrenees filled them with dread.\r\nIt required all Wellington’s robust self-confidence to keep them\r\nreassured. He had to be perpetually repeating to them that all his\r\npreparations for retreat and embarkation, if the worst should happen,\r\nhad been already thought out--they might make up their minds that he\r\nwould do nothing rash. But he was inclined to think that there would\r\nin the end be no need to depart. ‘I shall delay the embarkation,’ he\r\nwrote, ‘as long as it is in my power, and shall do everything that is\r\nin my power to avert the necessity of embarking at all. If the enemy\r\nshould invade this country with a force less than that which I should\r\nthink so superior to ours as to create a necessity for embarking, I\r\nshall fight a battle to save the country, and for this I have made\r\nthe preparations.’ He did not think he could be beaten; but if, by\r\nsome mischance, the fortune of war went against him, he had still\r\nno doubt that he could bring off the army in safety. ‘If we do go,\r\nI feel a little anxiety to go like gentlemen, out of the hall door\r\n(particularly after all the preparations I have made to enable us to\r\ndo so), and not out of the back door or by the area.’\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that in this most interesting dispatch to\r\nLord Liverpool Wellington distinctly asserts that his worst enemy\r\nwas the ghost of Sir John Moore[168]. ‘The great disadvantage under\r\nwhich I labour is that Sir John Moore, who was here before me, gave\r\nhis opinion that Portugal could not be defended by the army under\r\nhis command. It is obvious that the country was in a very different\r\nsituation at that time from what it is at present, and that I am in a\r\nvery different situation from that in which he found himself ..., yet\r\npersons who ought to be better acquainted with these facts entertain\r\na certain prejudice against the adoption of any plan for opposing\r\nthe enemy of which Portugal is to be the theatre. I have as much\r\nrespect as any man for the opinion and judgement of Sir John Moore,\r\nand I should mistrust my own if it were opposed to his in a case\r\nwhere he had had the opportunity of knowing and considering. But he\r\npositively knew nothing about Portugal, and could know nothing about\r\nits existing state[169].’\r\n\r\n  [168] See also vol. ii. page 286, of this book.\r\n\r\n  [169] All these quotations are from Wellington to Lord Liverpool,\r\n  April 2, 1810, a long dispatch written from Vizeu, every word of\r\n  which is well worth study.\r\n\r\nThe most vexatious thing for Wellington was that ‘the persons who\r\nought to have known better,’ yet were perpetually uttering melancholy\r\nvaticinations as to the approach of disaster, included some of\r\nhis own senior officers. I have seen a letter from a general in\r\nPortugal to his friend in England containing such phrases as this:\r\n‘I most strongly suspect that before many months are over our heads\r\nthere will be no opportunity for this employment (that of a cavalry\r\nbrigadier) left to _any one_, on the Continent at least. The next\r\ncampaign will close the eventful scene in the Peninsula, as far as we\r\nare concerned; for I am decidedly of opinion that neither (Marshal)\r\nWellington nor (Marshal) Beresford will prevent the approaching\r\nsubjugation of Portugal.’ Or again: ‘I am quite surprised at Lord\r\nW.’s pliant disposition. I suspect he feels himself tottering on his\r\nthrone, and wishes to conciliate at any sacrifice[170].’ The frequent\r\ncomplaints in Wellington’s correspondence as to the sort of letters\r\nthat were going home to England in the spring of 1810 sufficiently\r\nshow that these down-hearted views were not uncommon among his\r\nsubordinates. If the generals on the spot foresaw disaster, it is no\r\nwonder that the ministers in London felt anxious, and refused to be\r\ncomforted by the confident dispatches of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  [170] I found these passages in letters to Sir John Le Marchant,\r\n  then in command at the Staff College at High Wycombe, from a\r\n  highly-placed friend in Portugal. It is notable that other\r\n  contemporary epistles from younger men, old pupils of Le\r\n  Marchant, show a far more cheery spirit. The correspondence (from\r\n  which I shall have many other passages to quote) was placed at my\r\n  disposition by the kindness of Sir Henry Le Marchant, grandson of\r\n  Sir John.\r\n\r\nThe preparations which Wellington was making during the winter of\r\n1809-10 and the ensuing spring, for the reception of the inevitable\r\nFrench invasion, may be arranged, in the main, under three heads. We\r\nmust first treat of the complete reorganization of the Portuguese\r\nmilitary forces, not only the regulars but the militia, and the old\r\n_levée en masse_ of the Ordenança. Second come the elaborate plans\r\nfor the construction of enormous field-works for the protection of\r\nLisbon, the famous lines of Torres Vedras, and the fortification of\r\ncertain other, and more advanced, points. The third, and in some\r\nways the most important of all, was the arrangement of the great\r\nscheme for devastating the country-side in front of the invader, and\r\nfighting him by the weapon of starvation, a device new to the French,\r\nbut not unprecedented in the earlier history of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese regular army had taken hardly any part in the\r\ncampaigns of 1809. The only sections of it that had been under fire\r\nwere Silveira’s two regiments, the four battalions that marched with\r\nWellington to Oporto in May, and Wilson’s Loyal Lusitanian Legion,\r\nwhich had fought with more valour than success at the bridge of\r\nAlcantara and the Pass of Baños[171]. Beresford, with the greater\r\npart of the troops that were in a condition to take the field, had\r\nbeen out on the border in July, and had remained for some days in\r\nSpain, on the side of Coria and Zarza Mayor, but he had never been in\r\ncontact with the enemy[172]. The fighting power of the reorganized\r\nPortuguese army was still a doubtful quantity.\r\n\r\n  [171] See vol. ii. pages 440-1 and 620.\r\n\r\n  [172] See vol. ii. pages 600-1. Beresford had some 18,000 men\r\n  with him.\r\n\r\nThe field-strength of the Portuguese regular forces should have\r\nbeen, according to its establishments, 56,000 men. In September 1809\r\nthere were only 42,000 men with the colours[173], and of these much\r\nmore than half were recruits, who had recently been thrust into the\r\ndepleted _cadres_ of the old army. There were many regiments which\r\nhad been practically destroyed by the French, and which showed,\r\nwhen Beresford first marched out to the frontier, only 200 or 300\r\nmen instead of their normal 1,500[174]. Many others had less than\r\nhalf their complement. The first thing that required to be done was\r\nto fill up the gaps, and this was accomplished during the winter\r\nof 1809-10 by a stringent use of the conscription law already\r\nexisting. The line regiments in the Bussaco campaign showed, with\r\nhardly an exception, 1,200 or 1,300 effectives present--i.e. if the\r\nsick and ‘details’ are added they were nearly or quite up to their\r\nestablishment of 1,500[175]. The cavalry was less effective: the\r\nnumber of men could be filled up, but horses were hard to find,\r\nand in the end Wellington sent four of the twelve regiments to do\r\ndismounted duty in garrison, and served out their mounts to the\r\nremaining eight, which nevertheless could never show more than 300\r\nor 400 sabres present, out of their nominal 594. Portugal is not a\r\nhorse-breeding country, and the British cavalry was competing with\r\nthe native for the small supply of remounts that could be procured.\r\nThe artillery, on the other hand, was high in strength and very\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n  [173] See tables in vol. ii. pages 629-31.\r\n\r\n  [174] On Sept. 15, 1809, the 22nd, which had been destroyed by\r\n  Soult at Oporto, had only 193 men. The 8th had but 369, the 15th\r\n  577, the 24th 505.\r\n\r\n  [175] Ten regiments present at Bussaco had over 1,100 men each,\r\n  only one less than 800. This was the 22nd, mentioned above as\r\n  practically non-existent a year before. It had only recruited\r\n  up to the strength of one battalion: all the rest had two. The\r\n  strongest regiment was the 11th with 1,438 men.\r\n\r\nMere numbers are no test of the efficiency of a host. The weak\r\npoint of the old national army had been--as we mentioned in\r\nanother place--the effete and unmilitary character of its body of\r\nofficers--more especially of its senior officers[176]. The junior\r\nranks, filled up since the French invasion with young men who had\r\ntaken up the military career from patriotic motives, were infinitely\r\nbetter. By the second year of the war there were many admirable\r\nofficers among them. But it was men capable of handling a battalion\r\nor a regiment that were wanting. We saw how Beresford had been forced\r\nto introduce many British officers into the service, though he was\r\naware that the personal pride of the Portuguese officers was bitterly\r\nhurt thereby. His justification may be deduced from a confidential\r\nmemorandum written for him by his chief-of-the-staff, Benjamin\r\nD’Urban[177], which is well worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n  [176] See vol. ii. pages 210-15.\r\n\r\n  [177] This unpublished document here quoted, along with the whole\r\n  of Sir Benjamin’s journal and correspondence, has been placed at\r\n  my disposal by his grandson, Mr. D’Urban. They are invaluable for\r\n  the Portuguese aspect of the War.\r\n\r\n‘There are yet among the field officers, captains, and older\r\nsubalterns a number of incorrigible officers of the old school, who\r\nare a dead weight upon their respective regiments, and mischievous in\r\nthe way of example. Whenever it may be thought expedient, from time\r\nto time, to get rid of them, there will be no difficulty in finding\r\nexcellent young men to replace them from the ranks respectively\r\nbelow.... But I feel it incumbent upon me to give it you as my\r\ndecided opinion, resulting from a close investigation into the causes\r\nof the defects of the Portuguese, that it will be utterly impossible\r\neither to make a regiment fit for service, or to preserve it when\r\nmade so, without giving it an English commanding-officer and at least\r\ntwo English captains.\r\n\r\n‘The Portuguese soldier is naturally indolent. He falls with the\r\ngreatest facility into slouching and slovenly habits, unless he is\r\nconstantly roused and forced to exert himself. But many a Portuguese\r\nofficer, if not constantly spurred and urged to do his duty, is at\r\nleast as indolent as his men. Nothing (I am persuaded by experience)\r\nwill counteract this, and create activity among the officers and\r\nconsequent diligence and care among the men, but the strictness,\r\nenergy and vigilance of an English commanding-officer.\r\n\r\n‘Even supposing a sufficient energy of character in the native\r\nofficer, he does not and will not, if he be not a _Fidalgo_ himself,\r\nexercise coercive or strong measures to oblige one of that class\r\nto do his duty. He is aware that in doing so he makes a powerful\r\nenemy, and all the habits of thought in which he has been educated\r\ninspire him with such a dread of this, that no sense of duty will\r\nurge him to encounter it. Thus, whenever a regiment is commanded by a\r\nnon-Fidalgo, it never fails to suffer extremely: for the noblemen are\r\npermitted to do as they please, and afford a very bad example, for\r\nthey are at least as indolent as the ordinary Portuguese.\r\n\r\n‘The English captains will be found invaluable, especially in the\r\nhands of an English commandant. Their example is infinitely useful.\r\nThe Portuguese captains are piqued into activity and attention,\r\nwhen they see their companies excelled in efficiency by those\r\nof the English, and they do from emulation what a sense of duty\r\nwould perhaps never bring them to. There are a variety of by-paths\r\nand oblique means by which the parts of a Portuguese corps are\r\nconstantly, and almost insensibly, endeavouring to return to the old\r\nhabits that they are so much attached to. To nip this, from time to\r\ntime, in the bud, it is necessary to be aware of it: without the\r\nfaithful surveillance of English subordinate officers (who, ever\r\nmixing with the mass of the men, can’t well be ignorant of what is\r\ngoing on) the commanding-officer can rarely be warned in time.’\r\n\r\nBeresford replied that all this was true, but that ‘the national\r\nfeeling required management,’ and that to place every regimental\r\nor brigade command in British hands would provoke such fierce\r\njealousy that he was ‘compelled to humour the prejudices and satisfy\r\nthe pride of the nation.’ His device for doing this was to make\r\na general rule that wherever a Portuguese officer was in chief\r\ncommand he should have a British officer second in command under\r\nhim, and vice versa[178]. When a brigade was given to a Portuguese,\r\nhe managed that the two colonels of the regiments forming it should\r\nbe Englishmen; similarly, if a Portuguese commanded a regiment\r\nhis senior major was always an Englishman. By this means it was\r\nsecured that a fair half of the higher pieces of promotion should\r\nbe left to the native officers, but that every Portuguese placed\r\nin a responsible position should have a British officer at his\r\nback. In addition there were from two to four British captains in\r\neach battalion, but no subalterns; for, to encourage good men to\r\nvolunteer into the Portuguese service, it was provided that all who\r\ndid so should receive a step of promotion, and a British lieutenant\r\nbecame a Portuguese captain on exchange, and a British captain a\r\nPortuguese major. The system seems to have worked well, and with\r\nfar less friction than might have been expected[179]. The better\r\nclass of native officers were piqued into emulation, just as D’Urban\r\nhad expected; the worst was gradually eliminated[180]. It must be\r\nnoted that to every battalion there were added one or two British\r\nsergeants, whose services were needed for the drilling of the men in\r\nthe English exercises, which now superseded the old German system\r\nleft behind by La Lippe, the last reorganizer of the Portuguese army.\r\nFor the whole drill of the infantry was changed, and the British\r\nformations and manœuvres introduced. Dundas’s ‘Eighteen Manœuvres’\r\nwere translated, and became the Bible of the Lusitanian no less than\r\nthe British officer[181]. The employment of the two-deep line, the\r\nessential feature of the system, was made the base of all Portuguese\r\ndrill; at Bussaco it justified itself. The Caçadores were trained\r\non the ‘Rifle Regulations’ of Coote Manningham, and their uniform\r\nwas modified in cut, though not in colour, to a close resemblance\r\nof that of the British rifleman[182]. The net result of all these\r\nchanges was that for the future the British and Portuguese units of\r\nWellington’s army could be moved by the same words of command, and in\r\nthe same formations, and that all the disadvantages resulting from\r\nthe coexistence of two different systems of drill disappeared.\r\n\r\n  [178] This rule I find definitely laid down in a letter of\r\n  Hardinge, Beresford’s Quartermaster-general, written as late as\r\n  1812, but the practice was already in full use by 1810.\r\n\r\n  [179] For narratives of the daily life of a British officer in a\r\n  Portuguese regiment see Bunbury’s _Reminiscences of a Veteran_,\r\n  and Blakiston’s _Twelve Years of Military Adventure_. Both had\r\n  their difficulties, but both, on the whole, got on well with\r\n  their colleagues. D’Urban’s correspondence supplies a frequent\r\n  commentary on regimental problems.\r\n\r\n  [180] How this was done may be read in Blakiston.\r\n\r\n  [181] See Bunbury, p. 54.\r\n\r\n  [182] They were dressed in dark brown instead of in the rifle\r\n  green. The shako, coat, and trousers were of the British model.\r\n\r\nTwo principal difficulties still remained in the administration of\r\nthe Portuguese army. The first was, what to do with the few senior\r\nofficers of undoubted patriotism but more doubtful capacity, who\r\nwere too important and influential to be placed upon the shelf,\r\nyet might cause a disaster if placed in a critical position of\r\nresponsibility. The most notable of them was Silveira, who had\r\nacquired much popularity by his obstinate, if ill-managed, resistance\r\nto Soult in the spring of 1809. Wellington, with many searchings\r\nof heart, placed him in command of the Tras-os-Montes, where it\r\nwas most unlikely that any serious irruption of the French would\r\ntake place[183]. He had a large force placed under him, but it did\r\nnot include a single regular regiment, and, with militia only at\r\nhis disposition, it was hoped that he would be discouraged from\r\nattempting any hazardous experiments. Moreover, he was given a\r\nBritish second-in-command, first John Wilson and afterwards Miller,\r\nto curb his eccentricities so far as was possible. Baccelar, another\r\nofficer of doubtful merit, but more dangerous from torpidity than\r\nfrom rashness, was given charge of the militia of the three northern\r\nprovinces, so that Silveira was technically under his orders--though\r\nthe nominal subordinate would seem to have paid little attention\r\nto his superior. The most important post, however, assigned to a\r\nPortuguese officer was the governorship of Elvas, the strongest\r\nfortress of Portugal, and one which would stand in the forefront of\r\nthe battle if the French made the subsidiary invasion south of the\r\nTagus, which Wellington was inclined to expect. The command of this\r\ngreat stronghold and the 6,000 men of its garrison (of whom half\r\nwere regulars) was given to General Leite, an active and ingenious\r\nofficer, and (what was more important) a man who obeyed orders. Of\r\nall the Portuguese he was the one whom Wellington most trusted; every\r\nBritish narrator of the war who came in contact with him has a word\r\nof praise in his behalf. Of the other native generals, Lecor, in\r\ncommand of a division, and Fonseca, in command of a brigade, were\r\nwith the field army. Miranda was given charge of the militia of\r\nNorthern Estremadura, who were likely to be in the thickest of the\r\ntrouble. But the other Portuguese units of the allied host were under\r\nBritish officers: Pack, Archibald and Alexander Campbell, MacMahon,\r\nColeman, Harvey, Collins, and Bradford had charge of the regular\r\nbrigades of the field army. The native generals, save those above\r\nmentioned, were placed in administrative posts, or in charge of\r\nthose sections of the militia which were probably destined to see no\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n  [183] Silveira was the despair of Beresford and his\r\n  chief-of-the-staff D’Urban. The latter writes (Apr. 19, 1810):\r\n  ‘This general is the most extraordinary of all the people in this\r\n  extraordinary country. Perpetually fluctuating--incapable of\r\n  standing still--always wishing to move backward or forward--all\r\n  his movements to no purpose but that of harassing his troops. The\r\n  man is either very weak or very designing--perhaps both. Anyhow\r\n  he is a mischievous charlatan, and I wish the Marshal would not\r\n  yield to the prejudices of the people by employing him.’\r\n\r\nThe second point of difficulty in the organization of the Portuguese\r\narmy was the commissariat. In the old days it had been a purely\r\ncivilian branch of the service, non-military intendants dealing with\r\ncontractors and merchants. For this had been substituted a _Junta de\r\nViveres_ mainly composed of officers, which proved as ineffective,\r\nif not as corrupt, as the body which had preceded it. The British\r\ngovernment had taken over the responsibility of paying half the\r\nPortuguese army[184], but not that of feeding it, and despite of\r\nthe handsome subsidies that it paid to the Regency for the general\r\npurposes of the war, the native troops, especially those quartered\r\nfar from Lisbon, were often in a state of semi-starvation. ‘The\r\nPortuguese corps ought to have a commissariat attached to them, and\r\nI believe each brigade has a commissary,’ wrote Wellington, ‘but\r\nthey have no magazines and no money to purchase supplies[185].’ One\r\nmain difficulty arose from the fact that the Junta de Viveres shrank\r\nfrom the heavy expense of organizing a proper transport train, and\r\ntried to make shift with requisitioned carts and oxen, which were\r\ndifficult to get (since the British army was competing with the\r\nPortuguese for draught animals) and still harder to retain--for the\r\npeasant driver always absconded with his beasts when he found an\r\nopportunity. Another difficulty was that the Junta tried to feed\r\nthe troops with requisitioned corn, instead of paying for it with\r\nmoney down; hence it got grudging service. ‘I know from experience,’\r\nobserves Wellington, ‘that the Portuguese army could not be in the\r\ndistress under which it suffers, from want of provisions, if only\r\na part of the food it receives from the country were paid for.’\r\nAnd he suggested as a remedy that the British ministers should\r\nearmark part of the subsidy for use on the commissariat and no other\r\npurpose[186]. It was long before this matter was set to rights.\r\nBeresford’s correspondence in 1810 bristles with complaints as to the\r\ninefficiency of the Junta de Viveres[187].\r\n\r\n  [184] Viz. the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th,\r\n  15th, 16th, 19th of the line, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Caçadores.\r\n\r\n  [185] Wellington to Hill, Jan. 24, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [186] Wellington to Villiers, Jan. 25, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [187] D’Urban writes, May 4, ‘Such is the poverty, imbecility,\r\n  and want of arrangement of the Portuguese government, that any\r\n  regular system of supply is not to be expected. The whole civil\r\n  branch of the army is in such a state of confusion, that I hold\r\n  it impossible to carry on active operations for more than a few\r\n  weeks.’\r\n\r\nIf the regular army was badly fed, so that desertion and sickness\r\nwere both too prevalent in some corps, it was not to be expected\r\nthat the militia would fare better. Wellington had ordered, and\r\nBeresford had arranged for, the embodiment of every one of the 48\r\nmilitia regiments of the national establishment. They should properly\r\nhave given 70,000 men, but such a figure was never reached. Some of\r\nthe regimental districts were too thinly peopled to give the full\r\n1,500 men at which each was assessed. In others the officers placed\r\nin charge were incapable, or the local magistrates recalcitrant.\r\nMany regiments could show only 500 or 600 bayonets in 1810, few over\r\n1,000[188]. The total number under arms at the time of Masséna’s\r\ninvasion may have reached 45,000 bayonets. Of the 48 regiments eight\r\nbelonged to the lands south of the Tagus, and were never brought up\r\nto the front; they furnished the garrisons of Elvas and Campo Mayor,\r\nand a corps of observation on the lower Guadiana, destined to watch\r\nthe French in the direction of Ayamonte and the Condado de Niebla,\r\nlest any unexpected raid might be made in that quarter[189]. The\r\nfive regiments from the district immediately round the capital were\r\nat work on the ever-growing lines of Torres Vedras. One regiment\r\nwas in garrison at Peniche, two at Abrantes, three at Almeida. The\r\nmain force, consisting of the remaining units contributed by the\r\nNorth and the Beira, was divided into five corps, destined partly\r\nfor active operations against the enemy’s flanks and rear, when\r\nhe should enter Portugal, partly for the defence of Oporto and\r\nthe Tras-os-Montes, if any assault should be threatened in that\r\ndirection. These divisions stood as follows:--three regiments under\r\nLecor were left in the Castello Branco country, to protect it against\r\nraids from Spanish Estremadura. Seven under Trant, all corps from\r\nthe coast-land between the Douro and the Mondego, were to cover\r\nOporto from the south, or to operate against the rear of the invading\r\narmy, if it should leave that city alone and keep on the direct\r\nroad to Lisbon. Six under Silveira guarded the Tras-os-Montes, and\r\nwatched the French detachments in the northern part of the plains of\r\nLeon. Eight under Miller lay around Oporto, ready to support either\r\nSilveira or Trant if occasion should arise[190]. After the campaign\r\nbegan, and Masséna’s intention to leave the North alone became\r\nevident, half Miller’s division was placed under John Wilson (who had\r\noriginally been Silveira’s chief-of-the-staff and second-in-command)\r\nand sent south into the Beira to co-operate with Trant. Finally,\r\nfour regiments under the Portuguese brigadier Miranda lay at Thomar,\r\napparently for the purpose of aiding Lecor or strengthening the\r\ngarrison of Abrantes. This division ultimately retreated into the\r\nlines of Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\n  [188] I note in D’Urban’s diary, when he was making an inspection\r\n  tour with Beresford at the end of the winter, ‘At Sardão a very\r\n  good regiment of militia, 1,100 strong, that of Maia.’ ‘Abrantes,\r\n  two regiments of militia, Lousão 1,035, Soure 1,035, all armed.’\r\n  But, on the other hand, ‘Vizeu, Arganil, Trancoso, ordered to be\r\n  assembled at Almeida, have only--the first 867, the second 600,\r\n  the last 505 firelocks, and the description of troops the very\r\n  worst.’ Of course the numbers were somewhat higher by the next\r\n  August.\r\n\r\n  [189] These regiments were Lagos, Tavira, Beja, Evora,\r\n  Villaviciosa, Portalegre, Alcazar do Sul, Setubal.\r\n\r\n  [190] It may be well to name, once for all, the composition of\r\n  these Militia Brigades. They were distributed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Garrison of Abrantes:\r\n        Lousão\r\n        Soure\r\n    Garrison of Almeida:\r\n        Vizeu\r\n        Arganil\r\n        Trancoso\r\n    In the Lines:\r\n        1, 2, 3, 4 of Lisbon\r\n        Torres Vedras\r\n    With Lecor about Castello Branco:\r\n        Idanha\r\n        Covilhão\r\n        Castello Branco\r\n    Under Miller about Oporto:\r\n        Guimaraens\r\n        Viana\r\n        Braga\r\n        Basto\r\n        Villa do Conde\r\n        Arcos\r\n        Barcellos\r\n        Barco\r\n    With Trant, between the Douro and the Mondego:\r\n        Aveiro\r\n        Feira\r\n        Coimbra\r\n        Porto\r\n        Maia\r\n        Penafiel\r\n        Oliveira do Azemis\r\n    With Silveira about Braganza:\r\n        Lamego\r\n        Chaves\r\n        Villa Real\r\n        Braganza\r\n        Miranda\r\n        Moncorvo\r\n    With Miranda about Thomar:\r\n        Tondella\r\n        Santarem\r\n        Thomar\r\n        Leiria\r\n\r\n  Of Miller’s division, I think, but am not sure, that the last\r\n  four were those detached under Wilson in September.\r\n\r\nAll these troops were entirely unfitted for a place in the line of\r\nbattle; Wellington refused to mix them with the regular brigades,\r\nsave in the garrisons of Almeida, Abrantes, and Elvas. He directed\r\nthe brigadiers never to risk them in battle, even against a much\r\ninferior force of the French. Their sole purpose was to cut lines of\r\ncommunication, to render marauding by the enemy’s small detachments\r\nimpossible, and to restrict his power of making reconnaissances far\r\nafield. They were told that they might defend a pass or a ford for\r\na time, so as to delay the advance of a hostile column, but that\r\nthey were never to commit themselves to a serious combat with any\r\nconsiderable body. Convoys, stragglers, small detachments, were the\r\ngame on which they must prey. The programme was not a brilliant\r\none to lay down before an ambitious officer, and more than once\r\nSilveira, Trant, and Wilson disobeyed orders, and tried to withstand\r\na full French division in some chosen position. Such experiments\r\nalmost always ended in a disaster. It was not surprising, for the\r\nmilitia were not troops from whom much could be expected. The best\r\nmen in every district had been taken for the regular army; all\r\nthe trained officers were also needed there. The militia _cadres_\r\nwere composed of civilians who had to learn their duties just as\r\nmuch as the privates whom they were supposed to instruct. All the\r\npatriotic and energetic young men of the governing classes had\r\nsought commissions in the line; the less willing and active were\r\ndriven into the militia. Service therein brought neither much credit\r\nnor much promotion. If the Regency half-starved the regulars, it\r\nthree-quarter-starved the militia, which was normally in a state\r\nof destitution of clothing, shoes, and food. Hardly a regiment was\r\nprovided with uniforms; as a rule only the officers showed the\r\nregulation blue and silver. As long as the corps was in its own\r\ndistrict it was fed somehow, but when moved to some strategical point\r\nin the rugged mountains of the Beira, it was liable to go wholly\r\nto pieces from sheer privation. Fortunately the Portuguese peasant\r\nled a frugal life at all times, and expected little; the desertion,\r\nthough large, was not nearly so great as might have been expected.\r\nThe fact was that the men were essentially loyal, and hated the\r\nFrench with a perfect hatred. They might be very poor soldiers, but\r\nthey were very bitter personal enemies of the invader. Nevertheless,\r\nthey were liable to panics on very slight provocation. ‘At the best\r\nthey are a very daily and uncertain sort of fighting people[191],’\r\nremarked one of their leaders. Another wrote in a more forcible\r\nlanguage, ‘Scripture says, Put not your trust in princes--I say,\r\nFool is the man who puts his trust in a damnable militia.’ Each of\r\nthese sentences was indited the day after a disastrous and wholly\r\nunnecessary rout.\r\n\r\n  [191] D’Urban to Wilson, and Trant to Wilson, after two\r\n  unfortunate incidents in 1812, when the militia had been more or\r\n  less under arms for two whole years. The former are in D’Urban’s,\r\n  the latter in Wilson’s correspondence.\r\n\r\nOver and above the regular army and the militia, the Portuguese\r\nmilitary system contemplated the utilization of the whole _levée\r\nen masse_ of the nation under the name of the Ordenança. This was\r\nno foreshadowing of the modern idea of universal service, but a\r\nsurvival of the mediaeval practice which, in Portugal as in England,\r\nmade every freeman liable to be called out in time of extremity,\r\nat his own cost and with his own weapons. Every peasant between\r\nsixteen and sixty was theoretically supposed to be enrolled in one\r\nof the companies of 250 which each group of villages was supposed\r\nto possess. The organization had been effective enough in the old\r\nmediaeval wars with Castile: it had even proved serviceable in the\r\n‘War of Independence’ that followed the successful rising of 1640.\r\nBut against modern regular armies it was comparatively useless; when\r\ncalled out in the war of 1762 the Ordenança had not justified its\r\nold reputation. Little could be expected of mobs armed with pikes\r\nand fowling-pieces, save that they should cut off a few convoys and\r\nstragglers, or occasionally obstruct a defile. A French officer who\r\ndeeply studied this forgotten campaign wrote that, ‘whatever the\r\nSpaniards may say to the contrary, this war of the peasantry is\r\nby no means important, except against ignorant and undisciplined\r\ntroops[192].’\r\n\r\n  [192] Dumouriez, _State of Portugal_, page 22. There was,\r\n  however, one notable combat at Villa Pouca in the Tras-os-Montes\r\n  where a whole Spanish column of 3,000 men was defeated by the\r\n  Ordenança.\r\n\r\nWhen Wellington resolved to call out the Ordenança in 1810 he was\r\nignorant of none of these facts. Nevertheless, he insisted that\r\nthe Regency should issue the old royal ‘Ordinance’ to call out the\r\nlevy. His object was threefold: from the political and moral point\r\nof view it was necessary to take this measure, because it was the\r\nancient and established method of proclaiming that the country was\r\nin danger. It was so understood by the peasantry, in whose memories\r\nthe traditions of the Spanish invasions were still fresh; they\r\nexpected to be summoned, and would have doubted the imminence of the\r\nemergency if they had not been. The call was at once an appeal to\r\ntheir patriotism, and equivalent to a proclamation of martial law.\r\nSecondly, Wellington hoped to find assistance to a certain degree\r\nfor the work which he had set aside for the militia, by the aid of\r\nthe Ordenança. Pervading the whole country-side, and knowing every\r\ngoat-track and inaccessible fastness, their motley companies would\r\nsurround the invading army as it marched, prevent marauding by small\r\nparties, and render inter-communication between columns impossible,\r\nsave by large detachments. French narrators of the campaign speak of\r\n‘the cruel callousness with which Wellington exposed these half-armed\r\npeasants to the wrath of the most efficient army in the world,’ and\r\nwax sentimental over the miseries of the Portuguese. But sentiment\r\nfrom such a quarter is suspicious: it is absurd to find old soldiers\r\nwriting as if the main duty of a general defending a country were\r\nto spare its peasantry as much inconvenience as possible. Did not\r\nNapoleon in 1814 make every endeavour to raise Lorraine and Champagne\r\n_en masse_ in the rear of the Allies, and has any French critic\r\never blamed him for doing so? Was the actual misery suffered by\r\nthe inhabitants of Beira so much greater than what they would have\r\nendured if they had remained at home, and offered no resistance? The\r\ncountry-side would have been stripped bare by an army forced to make\r\n‘war support war,’ and one can hardly believe, judging from parallel\r\nincidents in Spain, that outrages would have been conspicuous by\r\ntheir absence.\r\n\r\nBut it would seem that the third of Wellington’s reasons for calling\r\nout the Ordenança was far more cogent, and lay nearer to the heart\r\nof his scheme than the other two. Throughout Portuguese history the\r\nsummons to the levy _en masse_ had always been combined with another\r\nmeasure, from which indeed it could not be disentangled--the order\r\nto the whole population to evacuate and devastate the land in face\r\nof the advancing enemy. The use of the weapon of starvation against\r\nthe French was an essential part of Wellington’s plan for defending\r\nPortugal. When he told the British Ministry that he would undertake\r\nthe defence of the realm, this was one of the main conditions of his\r\npledge. He had realized the great fact that the conduct of the war\r\nin the Peninsula depended on supplies: the old aphorism that ‘beyond\r\nthe Pyrenees large armies starve and small armies get beaten’ was\r\nat the back of all his schemes for the year 1810. He calculated\r\nthat the French would find the greatest difficulty in accumulating\r\nstores sufficient to feed an army of invasion large enough to attack\r\nPortugal, and that, even if such stores could be gathered, there\r\nwould be a still greater difficulty in getting them to the front as\r\nthey were needed. For not only would it be hard to collect the mass\r\nof transport required for an army of 70,000, 80,000, or 100,000 men,\r\nbut the convoys which it formed would find it impossible to move\r\nover the vast stretch of bad roads between Salamanca and Lisbon,\r\nwhen the communications were cut and the Militia and Ordenança were\r\ninfesting every pass and hillside. It was almost certain that the\r\ninvaders would make no such attempt to feed themselves from the\r\nrear, but would start with a moderate train, carrying no more than\r\nprovisions for a week or two, and hoping to subsist (in the usual\r\nFrench style) on the resources of the invaded country. Such resources\r\nWellington was determined that they should not find. They would ere\r\nlong be starved out, and forced to fall back on their magazines,\r\ncertainly losing a large proportion of their men from privations by\r\nthe way. If this scheme had been carried out with rigid perfection,\r\nMasséna’s invasion would have amounted to no more than a promenade\r\nto Torres Vedras, and a prompt return to the borders of Spain with\r\na famished army. Unfortunately the device, though it worked well\r\nand was ultimately quite successful, was not perfectly executed in\r\nevery corner and by every subordinate, so that the French, showing\r\na magnificent obstinacy, and suffering untold privations, remained\r\nbefore the Lines for three months before they retired. But retire\r\nthey did, and with a loss of a third of their army, and a deplorable\r\ndecadence of their morale, so that Wellington’s scheme was fully\r\njustified[193].\r\n\r\n  [193] Unlike the many French writers who content themselves\r\n  with denouncing Wellington’s inhumanity, Pelet (Masséna’s\r\n  chief confidant) confesses that the English general’s plan was\r\n  perfectly logical. In his _Aperçu de la Campagne de Portugal_,\r\n  he writes, ‘On a critiqué sans raison son système de guerre.\r\n  Il était à peu près infaillible contre un ennemi inférieur en\r\n  nombre. Mais peu de généraux oseront “sauver un pays” d’une telle\r\n  manière.’\r\n\r\nThe plan for defeating the enemy by the system of devastation was\r\nneither ‘dictated by the hard heart of a general trained in the\r\natrocious wars of the East,’ as certain French authors have written,\r\nnor was it (as some of the English authors have supposed) suggested\r\nto Wellington by the measures which had been taken in 1803-4 for\r\nwithdrawing all food and transport from the south coast of England,\r\nif Napoleon should be successful in crossing from Boulogne. It was\r\nan ancient Portuguese device, practised from time immemorial against\r\nthe Castilian invader, which had never failed of success. Nor had\r\nit come to an end with the War of Independence of 1640, or the war\r\nof the Spanish Succession of 1704. When Spain had made her last\r\nserious assault on Portugal in 1762 (Godoy’s miserable mock-war of\r\n1801 does not deserve to be counted), the plan had worked admirably.\r\nWhen the Conde d’Aranda invaded the Beira ‘the country had been\r\n“driven” in the most systematic style, and everything that could\r\nnot be carried off had been destroyed, so that the Spaniard found\r\nhimself in a desert, being unable to discover either provisions,\r\ncars, or peasants: the inhabitants had abandoned their villages,\r\nand carried off everything. The enemy had to be supplied with every\r\nnecessary from Spain: the infantry were harassed with fatigue in\r\nremaking the roads, and the cavalry-horses destroyed in conducting\r\nprovisions. At last d’Aranda retreated, leaving his sick and wounded\r\nat Castello Branco, with a letter commending them to the attention\r\nof the allies[194].’ Of this same war Dumouriez wrote: ‘As soon as\r\nthe Spaniards enter Portugal the King publishes a declaration, by\r\nwhich he enjoins on his subjects to fall upon the invaders, and the\r\nnational hatred always excites them to execute the “Ordinance.” As\r\nthe Spanish army pushes on, the villages are depopulated, and the\r\ninhabitants fall back on the capital. The peasantry arrive there in\r\ncrowds with wives and children, so that the king at the end of three\r\nmonths has 200,000 or 300,000 extra mouths to feed[195].’\r\n\r\n  [194] Continuation of Vertot’s _History of Portugal_, ii. 51.\r\n\r\n  [195] Dumouriez’s _State of Portugal_, p. 21, _n._\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a description of the great migration of 1810, but\r\nwas actually written in 1766. It is clear, then, that Wellington\r\ndid not invent the system of devastation, but simply utilized, and\r\ncarried out to its logical end, an old custom essentially national,\r\nand familiar to the Portuguese from time immemorial. It was the\r\nregular device of the weak against the strong in the Middle Ages,\r\nand differed in nothing from ‘Good King Robert’s Testament,’ the\r\ntime-honoured system applied by the Scots to the English in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n    ‘In strait placis gar hide all store,\r\n    And byrnen ye plaineland thaim before,\r\n    Thanne sall thei pass away in haist,\r\n    When that thai find na thing but waist,\r\n    So sall ye turn thaim with gret affrai,\r\n    As thai were chasit with swerd awai.’\r\n\r\nFortunately for himself, for England, and for Europe, Wellington\r\nhad to deal with a peasantry almost as frugal, as tough, and as\r\nstubborn in their hatred as the mediaeval Scot. They saw nothing\r\nstrange in the demand now made to them, and obeyed. The difficulty\r\nlay with the townsfolk of large places, such as Coimbra, Thomar,\r\nor Santarem, which lay far from the frontier, and had not the\r\nold traditions of the peasantry, since the Spaniards had never\r\npenetrated to their doors since the seventeenth century. Here\r\nthere was much recalcitrance, as was but natural; the burgher had\r\nmuch to abandon where the peasant had little. Yet, as we shall see,\r\nthe scheme was carried out in the end, and those who stayed behind\r\nto greet the French could be counted on one hand in places of the\r\nsize of Vizeu, Coimbra, or Leiria. That fanatical patriotism went\r\nfar towards producing such a result is true, but does not explain\r\nthe whole matter: quite as strong a motive was the unforgotten tale\r\nof the horrors that had followed Soult’s entry into Oporto. To the\r\nPortuguese citizens the approach of the French meant probable murder\r\nand rape, hence came the readiness that they showed to depart. There\r\nwere exaggerated rumours abroad of the ruthlessness of the French:\r\nwas not Loison, the ‘Maneta’ of whom so many atrocious (and mostly\r\nfalse) stories were told, known to be in high command?\r\n\r\nWellington’s scheme for the clearing of the country-side in face\r\nof the enemy had long been thought out. It included not merely the\r\nevacuation of the towns and villages, but the destruction of bridges,\r\nmills, even ovens; the removal of all animals and means of transport,\r\nthe destruction of all food-stuff that could not be carried off, the\r\nburning of all ferry-boats and other small craft on the navigable\r\nrivers. ‘The moment that the enemy crosses the frontier,’ he wrote to\r\nBeresford, ‘the governor of the province of Estremadura must be told\r\nthat it is necessary to order all carts, carriages, and other means\r\nof conveyance, with all the provisions they can carry, away. He ought\r\nto have all his arrangements prepared for ordering them off as soon\r\nas the French approach. The Captains Mor[196] and their Ordenança\r\nmust be prepared to give the enemy all the opposition in their power,\r\nnot by assembling in large bodies, but by lying out in the mountains\r\nand the strong parts of the roads, annoying their patrols and small\r\nparties, and interrupting their communications[197].’ This comes from\r\nan order of February: by August, when a new harvest had been gathered\r\nin, the question of the destruction of food stuffs became more\r\ndifficult. The peasantry, as was natural, persisted in hiding rather\r\nthan burning what could not be carried off. By one means or another\r\na certain number of these concealed stores, even when buried in pits\r\nor removed to remote ravines, were discovered by the French, and\r\nenabled them to prolong their precarious stay in front of the Torres\r\nVedras lines.\r\n\r\n  [196] For these officers and their duties see vol. ii. pp. 221-2.\r\n\r\n  [197] Wellington to Beresford, Vizeu, Feb. 28, 1810, long before\r\n  the actual invasion.\r\n\r\nAs to the displacement of the population, Wellington considered\r\nthat in many parts it would be sufficient if it took to the hills\r\nfor a few days, while the French army was passing. His military\r\narrangements were such that he thought it impossible that the enemy\r\nwould be able either to leave small posts behind him, or to maintain\r\nhis lines of communication with Spain. It would suffice, therefore,\r\nthat the peasantry in parts off the main roads, and remote from large\r\ntowns or points of strategical importance, should make ready for a\r\nmerely temporary migration. They must always, however, be ready to\r\nflit again, if fresh columns of the enemy, advancing or retreating,\r\nshould come near their abodes. The townsfolk and the inhabitants\r\nof the fertile coast plains of Estremadura and Western Beira were\r\nrecommended to retire either to Lisbon or to Oporto, according as\r\nthey were nearer to one or to the other. It was clear that the\r\nproblem of feeding them there would be a matter for the Government,\r\nfor individuals of the poorer classes could not be expected to carry\r\nor to buy provisions for many weeks. Hence there was a need for the\r\naccumulation of immense stores, over and above those required for\r\nthe army. The Portuguese Regency did what it could, but in its usual\r\nslip-shod and inefficient fashion, and there is no doubt that much\r\nmisery and a certain amount of starvation fell to the lot of the\r\nunhappy emigrants. Fortunately Lisbon and Oporto were great ports\r\nand full of food; but despite of this, the position of the refugees\r\nbecame deplorable, when Masséna tarried at Santarem two months longer\r\nthan Wellington had considered probable. But their suffering was not\r\nin vain: the French were starved out, even if it was a few weeks\r\nlater than had been expected.\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the organization of the military force of Portugal,\r\nand the arrangements for the depopulation of the country, we have\r\nstill to explain the third section of Wellington’s great scheme of\r\ndefence--that consisting of fortifications. We have already mentioned\r\nthat Almeida and Elvas had been repaired and garrisoned, the former\r\nwith 5,000 men, consisting of one regiment of regulars and three of\r\nmilitia, under the English general William Cox, the other by 8,000\r\nmen,--two regiments of regulars and five of militia,--under General\r\nLeite. These were the outer bulwarks of the realm. Campo Mayor, a\r\nsmall and antiquated fortress, a sort of outlying dependency of\r\nElvas, was held by one militia battalion under a Colonel Talaya,\r\na retired engineer officer. It was not expected to make a serious\r\nresistance, but did so in the time of need, and detained a French\r\ndivision before its walls for some precious days in the spring of\r\n1811, to the great glory and credit of its governor.\r\n\r\nOnly two other of the ancient fortresses of Portugal were placed in\r\na state of defence, and made to play a notable part in Wellington’s\r\ngeneral scheme for checking the French. These were Peniche and\r\nAbrantes. The former is a very strong isolated sea-fortress, on a\r\nprojecting headland in the Atlantic, forty miles north of Lisbon. It\r\ncommands several good creeks and landing-places, suitable for the\r\nembarkation and disembarkation of troops, and is nearly impregnable,\r\nbecause of the narrowness of the isthmus connecting it with the\r\nmainland. Placed where it is, just in the rear of the position which\r\nan enemy must take who is meditating an attack on Lisbon, it offers\r\nunique opportunities for making incursions on his rear and his\r\ncommunications. Moreover, it afforded a refuge and a safe point of\r\ndeparture by sea, for any section of the allied troops which might\r\nbecome isolated, and be pressed towards the water by the advancing\r\nenemy. Some of Wellington’s officers considered that it was an even\r\nbetter place for embarkation than Lisbon, if the French should\r\nprove too strong, and the British should be compelled to abandon\r\nPortugal. The Commander-in-Chief thought otherwise, but caused its\r\nfortification to be carefully restored, and garrisoned it with a\r\npicked regiment of militia[198].\r\n\r\n  [198] D’Urban says in his diary (Dec. 8, 1809): ‘Inspected\r\n  Peniche. The isthmus over which the peninsula is approached is\r\n  covered with water at high tide, and from the line of works\r\n  describing a sort of arc, very powerful cross-fires may be\r\n  established upon every part of it. There are nearly 100 good\r\n  guns upon the work, the brass ones especially good. This is the\r\n  most favourable position that can he conceived for embarking\r\n  the British army, should it ever be necessary to do so. The\r\n  circumference abounds with creeks and clefts in the rocks, inside\r\n  which there is always smooth water, and easy egress for boats.\r\n  They are out of the reach of fire from the mainland: indeed,\r\n  there is sufficient room to encamp a large force perfectly beyond\r\n  the range of the enemy. If it should be thought worth while, this\r\n  peninsula could be held by England, even if Portugal otherwise\r\n  were in the power of the enemy. There is abundance of water. If\r\n  it be the wish of Lord Wellington he can retire upon Lisbon, give\r\n  battle in front of it, and, if the day go against him, retreat\r\n  upon Peniche and defend it so long as he pleases.’\r\n\r\nEven more important than Peniche was Abrantes, the one great\r\ncrossing-place of the Tagus above Lisbon where there was a permanent\r\nbridge, and free communication by good roads between Beira and\r\nAlemtejo. It lies at the point where the road from Spain by way\r\nof Castello Branco crosses the road from north to south down the\r\nPortuguese frontier, from Almeida and Guarda to Evora and Elvas. An\r\ninvader who has advanced towards Lisbon through Beira has it on his\r\nflank and rear, equally so an invader who has advanced on the same\r\nobjective from Badajoz and the Guadiana. It is the natural point\r\nat which to move troops north and south along the frontier, though\r\nWellington had established an alternative temporary crossing-point at\r\nVilla Velha, thirty miles higher up the river, by means of pontoons.\r\nBut this secondary passage was inferior in safety, since it was not\r\nprotected by a fortress like Abrantes. Orders were given to burn the\r\npontoons if ever a French force from the East should came near. At\r\nAbrantes, on the other hand, the boat-bridge could be pulled up and\r\nstacked under the city walls in the event of an attack, and did not\r\nneed to be destroyed. The town is situated on a lofty eminence upon\r\nthe north bank of the Tagus. Its fortifications were antiquated in\r\n1809, but had been for many months in process of being rebuilt and\r\nstrengthened by the English engineer Patton. With new earthworks\r\nand redoubts it had been made a strong place, which could not be\r\ntaken without a regular siege and plenty of heavy artillery. Here\r\nWellington had placed a garrison of two militia regiments under the\r\nPortuguese general Lobo, whose orders were to resist to the last,\r\nand to make sure of burning the boat-bridge, down to the last plank,\r\nbefore surrendering. The French never put him to the test, since they\r\nhad no heavy guns with them, and therefore regarded it as hopeless\r\nto attempt an attack on the place[199].\r\n\r\n  [199] D’Urban has a long disquisition on Abrantes in his diary.\r\n  Its weak points, he says, were an outlying hill on the Punhete\r\n  road, which gave a favourable position for hostile batteries, and\r\n  the friable nature of the gravelly soil, which did not bind well\r\n  in trenches and outworks.\r\n\r\nAlmeida and Elvas, Peniche and Abrantes, were regular fortresses with\r\nlarge garrisons. There were, however, other points where Wellington\r\nordered fortifications of a less permanent kind to be thrown up,\r\nbecause he thought them of first-rate strategical importance. The two\r\nmost important were one on the northern line of advance which the\r\nFrench might take, the other on the central or Castello Branco line.\r\nThe first was a line of redoubts behind the river Alva, just where it\r\njoins the Mondego, on either side of the bridge and village of Ponte\r\nde Murcella. It was here, he thought, that Masséna would choose his\r\nroad, along the south bank of the Mondego, if he marched on Lisbon\r\nby the Beira line. But the Marshal moved by Vizeu, partly (as it\r\nseems) because he had heard of the fortifications of this defile, and\r\nthe works were never used. Equally unprofitable (so it chanced) was\r\nanother important series of field-works, constructed to cover the\r\nlowest reach of the Zezere against an invader who should come by the\r\nCastello Branco road, and should have masked or taken Abrantes. This\r\nwas a line of redoubts and trenches, almost a fortified camp, on the\r\neast bank of the river from Tancos to opposite Martinchel, blocking\r\nboth the roads which lead from Castello Branco into Estremadura.\r\nMasséna, coming not by the route which was guarded against, but from\r\nLeiria and Thomar, took the lines of Zezere in the rear, and they\r\nproved useless.\r\n\r\nAlong with the precautions taken on the banks of the Alva and the\r\nZezere, two other pieces of engineering must be mentioned. The one,\r\nthe destruction of the _Estrada Nova_,--the mountain-road which leads\r\nfrom Fundão and Belmonte to the lower Zezere without passing through\r\nCastello Branco,--has already been noticed, when we were dealing\r\nwith the possible lines of invasion in Portugal. The other move was\r\nconstructive, not destructive, in character. Foreseeing that Abrantes\r\nmight be masked, or besieged on the northern bank of the Tagus, and\r\nall the roads in that direction thereby blocked, while it might\r\nstill be very profitable to have free communication between Lisbon\r\nand the Castello Branco region, he caused the road above the south\r\nbank of the Tagus, from opposite Abrantes to the flying-bridge at\r\nVilla Velha, to be thoroughly reconstructed. This route, by Gavião\r\nand Niza, was so much easier in its slopes than the old high-road\r\nAbrantes-Castello Branco, that, even when the latter was safe, troops\r\nmoving from east to west, along the Tagus often used it during the\r\nnext two years of the war, though it involved two passages of the\r\nriver instead of one.\r\n\r\nBut all the matters of engineering hitherto mentioned were\r\nunimportant and merely subsidiary, when placed beside the one great\r\npiece of work which formed the keystone of Wellington’s plan for\r\nthe defence of Portugal. His whole scheme depended on the existence\r\nof an impregnable place of refuge, available both for his army, and\r\nfor the emigrant population of the country-side which he was about\r\nto devastate. He must have a line on which the invader could be\r\nfinally checked and forced to halt and starve. If such a line had not\r\nexisted, his whole scheme would have been impracticable, and after\r\na lost battle he might have been driven to that hurried embarkation\r\nwhich the ministers in London foresaw and dreaded. But his eye had\r\nbeen fixed upon the ground in front of Lisbon ever since his second\r\nlanding in the Peninsula in April 1809, and there he thought that the\r\nnecessary stronghold might be found. A full year before Masséna’s\r\ninvasion he had informed the British cabinet that though he could not\r\nundertake to defend all Portugal, ‘for the whole country is frontier,\r\nand it would be difficult to prevent the enemy from entering by\r\nsome point or other,’ he yet conceived that he might protect the\r\nessential part of the realm, the capital, against anything save the\r\nmost overwhelming odds[200]. The scheme had taken definite shape in\r\nhis head when, on October 20, 1809, he wrote his famous dispatch to\r\nColonel Fletcher, the commanding engineer at Lisbon, directing him to\r\ndraw up without delay a scheme for the construction of two successive\r\nlines of trenches and redoubts, covering the whole stretch of country\r\nfrom the Atlantic to a point on the estuary of the Tagus twenty miles\r\nor more north of the capital. This was, in its essentials, the order\r\nfor the construction of the lines of Torres Vedras, for though the\r\nfront designated does not exactly tally with that ultimately taken\r\nup, it only differs from it in points of detail. Fletcher is directed\r\nto survey a line from the mouth of the Castanheira brook to the mouth\r\nof the Zizandre, and another, a few miles behind, from Alhandra on\r\nthe Tagus by Bucellas and Cabeça de Montechique towards Mafra. These\r\nroughly represent the two lines of defence ultimately constructed,\r\nthough in the end the extreme right flank was drawn back from the\r\nCastanheira to the Alhandra stream. Fletcher is told that the works\r\nwill be on the largest scale: the fortified camp above Torres Vedras\r\nis to hold 5,000 men, the works at Cabeça de Montechique alone will\r\nrequire 5,000 workmen to be set to dig at once; great operations,\r\nsuch as the damming up of rivers and the creation of marshes many\r\nmiles long, are suggested.\r\n\r\n  [200] For these views of Aug. and Sept. 1809, see vol. ii. p. 610.\r\n\r\nHow the great scheme worked out, and how the works stood when\r\nMasséna’s long-expected army at last appeared in front of them, will\r\nbe told in a later chapter, in its due place. Suffice it here to say\r\nthat all through the spring and summer of 1810 they were being urged\r\nforward with feverish haste.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that it was an easy matter to carry out all\r\nthese preparations. The Portuguese government ended by adopting\r\nall Wellington’s suggestions: but it was not without friction that\r\nhe achieved his purpose. While he was planning works at the very\r\ngates of Lisbon, and making provisions for the devastation of\r\nwhole provinces in view of the approaching invasion, he was often\r\nmet by suggestions that it would be possible to defend the outer\r\nfrontiers of the realm, and that his schemes were calculated to\r\ndishearten the Portuguese people, rather than to encourage them to\r\na firm resistance. The Regency, moreover, had enough national pride\r\nto resent the way in which a policy was dictated to them, without\r\nany reference to their own views. The governing party in Portugal\r\nhad accepted the English alliance without reserve, but it often\r\nwinced at the consequences of its action. There was a view abroad\r\nthat the little nation was being set in the forefront of the battle\r\nof European independence mainly for the benefit of Great Britain.\r\nFortunately the memory of Junot’s dictatorship and Soult’s ravages\r\nwas still fresh enough to overcome all other considerations. A\r\nmoment’s reflection convinced Wellington’s most ardent critics that\r\nthough the British yoke might sometimes seem hard, anything was\r\nbetter than a return to French servitude. The Regency murmured, but\r\nalways ended by yielding, and issued the edicts necessary to confirm\r\nall the orders of the general.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Portuguese government at this moment requires a\r\nword of explanation. The original Regency confirmed by Sir Hew\r\nDalrymple in 1808 had been somewhat changed in its personnel. It\r\nwas now a more numerous body than at its first installation; of the\r\noriginal members, only the Patriarch (Antonio de Castro, late bishop\r\nof Oporto), and the Marquez de Olhão (Francisco de Mello e Menezes,\r\nthe Constable or Monteiro Mor, as he is more frequently called), now\r\nsurvived. But four new members had been appointed in 1810. The most\r\nimportant of them was José Antonio de Menezes e Sousa, generally\r\nknown as the ‘Principal Sousa,’ an ecclesiastic who was one of\r\nthe band of three Sousa brothers, who formed the backbone of the\r\nanti-French party in Portugal. The eldest of them, Rodrigo de Sousa\r\nCoutinho, Conde de Linhares, was prime minister of the Prince Regent\r\nat Rio de Janeiro. The third, Domingos Antonio de Sousa Coutinho,\r\nafterwards Conde de Funchal, was Portuguese minister in London. Thus\r\nwhen the Principal entered the Regency, this busy and capable family\r\ncould pull the strings alike at Rio, London, and Lisbon, in the\r\ninterests of their relations and dependants. This they did without\r\nscruple and without ceasing. Domestic politics in Portugal had always\r\nbeen a matter of family alliances, as much as of principles. They\r\npresented, indeed, a considerable resemblance to those of Great\r\nBritain during the Whig domination of the eighteenth century. Hence\r\nthere was considerable danger that the policy of the alliance against\r\nNapoleon might become identified in the eyes of the Portuguese nation\r\nwith the domination of the Sousa faction. That this peril was avoided\r\nwas not their fault: they did their best to keep all promotion,\r\ncivil and military, for their own adherents; hence came interminable\r\nquarrels on petty personal questions both with Wellington and\r\nBeresford. Fortunately the two Marshals could generally get their way\r\nin the end, when large interests were at stake, because the Sousas\r\nwere pledged to the British alliance, and dared not break with it.\r\nTo do so would have brought other politicians to the front. But,\r\nmeanwhile, unending controversies wasted Wellington’s time and soured\r\nhis temper: more than once he is found writing in his dispatches\r\nto Lord Liverpool that the ‘impatient, meddling, mischievous’[201]\r\nPrincipal ought to be got out of the Regency and promoted to some\r\nforeign embassy, or great civil post, where he could do less harm.\r\nBut the British government thought, and probably was right in\r\nthinking, that it was better to bear with known evils than to quarrel\r\nwith the Sousa family, and thereby to break up the pro-British party\r\nin Portugal. Wellington had to endure the Principal’s small intrigues\r\nand petty criticism till the end.\r\n\r\n  [201] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, _Dispatches_, vi. p. 435.\r\n\r\nThe other members who entered the Regency in 1810 were the Conde\r\nde Redondo, Fernando Maria de Sousa Coutinho--another of the Sousa\r\nclan--Doctor Raymundo Nogueira, a law professor of the University of\r\nCoimbra[202] and--far the most important of all--the newly appointed\r\nBritish Minister at Lisbon, Mr. Charles Stuart. The nomination of\r\na foreigner to such a post touched Portuguese pride to the quick,\r\nand was looked upon by all enemies of the Sousa faction as an act\r\nof miserable weakness on the part of the Conde de Linhares and the\r\nPrince Regent. It was considered doubtful policy on the part of the\r\nPerceval Cabinet to consent to the appointment, considering the\r\noffence which it was certain to give. In their justification it must\r\nbe pleaded that both the Patriarch and the Principal Sousa were men\r\ncapable of causing any amount of difficulty by their ill-considered\r\nplans and their personal intrigues, and that a colleague who could\r\nbe trusted to keep an eye upon their actions, and to moderate their\r\nambitions was much needed. Stuart was a man of moderate and tactful\r\nbearing, but could be neither cajoled nor overruled. It was on his\r\ninfluence in the Regency that Wellington relied most for support. At\r\nthis moment there were two questions in process of discussion which\r\nrendered it most necessary that the Portuguese government should\r\nnot be left entirely to its own guidance. Taking advantage of the\r\nunhappy condition of Spain, and the weakness of the newly appointed\r\nexecutive at Cadiz, the Portuguese were pressing for the restoration\r\nof Olivenza, Godoy’s old conquest of 1801, and for the recognition\r\nof the Princess Carlotta of Spain, the wife of the Prince of the\r\nBrazils, as the person entitled to act as Regent of Spain during the\r\ncaptivity of her brothers at Valençay. Dom Pedro de Sousa Holstein,\r\nthe Portuguese minister at Cadiz--a kinsman of Linhares and the\r\nPrincipal--was actively urging both these demands on the Spanish\r\ngovernment. If he had succeeded in imposing them on Castaños and\r\nhis colleagues there would have been desperate friction between the\r\nallies. But by promising the active support of the Portuguese army\r\nwithin the Spanish frontiers--which he had no power to guarantee, and\r\nwhich Wellington had absolutely refused to grant--the minister won\r\nsome support at Cadiz. Extra pressure was brought to bear upon the\r\nSpaniards by the massing of Brazilian troops on the South American\r\nfrontier, on the side of Rio Grande do Sul--a most unjustifiable act,\r\nwhich might have led to an actual rupture, a thing which the British\r\ngovernment was bound to prevent by every means in its power. The\r\nonly way to prevent an open breach between Spain and Portugal was\r\nto check the activity of Sousa Holstein, an end which Stuart found\r\nmuch difficulty in accomplishing, because the objects for which the\r\nminister was striving, and especially the restoration of Olivenza\r\nto its old owners, were entirely approved by his colleagues in the\r\nRegency. When it is added that there were numerous other points of\r\nfriction between the British and the Portuguese governments--such as\r\nthe question of free trade with Brazil, that of the suppression of\r\nthe slave trade, and that of the form to be adopted for the payment\r\nof the subsidies which maintained the Portuguese army--it is easy\r\nto understand that Stuart’s position on the Council of Regency was\r\nno easy one. He often found himself in a minority of one when a\r\ndiscussion started: he frequently had to acquiesce in decisions\r\nwhich he did not approve, merely in order to avoid friction on\r\nmatters of secondary importance. But in matters of really primary\r\nmoment he generally succeeded in getting his way, owing to the simple\r\nfact that Portugal was dependent on Great Britain for the continuance\r\nof her national existence. Conscious of this, the other members of\r\nthe Regency would generally yield a reluctant assent at the last\r\nmoment, and Wellington’s plans, when set forth by Stuart, though\r\noften criticized, delayed, and impeded, were in the end carried out\r\nwith more or less completeness.\r\n\r\n  [202] A man of whom all Portuguese writers speak with\r\n  respect; even Napier notes him (ii. 386) as ‘a man of talent\r\n  and discretion.’ But Wellington seems to have disliked him.\r\n  ‘The admission of Dr. Raymundo Nogueira to the Regency, and\r\n  the reasons of his admission, were truly ludicrous ... his\r\n  appointment is to be agreeable to the lower orders--from among\r\n  whom he is selected!’ (Wellington to Charles Stuart, Celorico,\r\n  Aug. 4, 1810.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH PREPARATIONS: MASSÉNA’S ARMY OF PORTUGAL\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the summer campaign of 1809 the French Army of Spain had\r\nreceived hardly any reinforcements from beyond the Pyrenees. Every\r\nman that the Emperor could arm was being directed against Austria\r\nin May and June. But when Wagram had been won, and the armistice\r\nof Znaym signed, and when moreover it had been discovered that the\r\nBritish expedition to the Isle of Walcheren need not draw off any\r\npart of the Army of Germany, the Emperor began to turn his attention\r\nto the Peninsula. The armistice with Austria had been signed on July\r\n12: only six days later, on the 18th of the same month, Napoleon\r\nwas already selecting troops to send to Spain, and expressing\r\nhis intention of going there himself to ‘finish the business’ in\r\nperson[203]. But he had made up his mind that it was too late in the\r\nyear for him to transport any great mass of men to the Peninsula in\r\ntime for operations in the autumn, and had settled that the expulsion\r\nof the English and the conquest of Cadiz, Seville, and Valencia must\r\nbe delayed to the spring of 1810. On September 7 he wrote[204] to\r\napprove King Joseph’s decision that Soult should not be allowed to\r\nmake any attempt on Portugal in the autumn, and a month later he\r\nadvised his brother to defend the line of the Tagus, and drive back\r\nSpanish incursions, but to defer all offensive movements till the\r\nreinforcements should have begun to arrive[205].\r\n\r\n  [203] ‘Faites-moi connaître la marche que vous faites faire aux\r\n  66e, 82e, 26e, etc., etc.: _lorsque j’entrerai en Espagne_ cela\r\n  me pourra faire une force de 18,000 hommes.’ Napoleon to Clarke,\r\n  Schönbrunn, July 18.\r\n\r\n  [204] Napoleon to Clarke, Schönbrunn, Sept. 7.\r\n\r\n  [205] Napoleon to Clarke, memoranda for King Joseph, Oct. 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the new army that was to enter Spain was dictated\r\nin a minute to the Minister of War on October 7, in which the\r\nEmperor stated that the total force was to be about 100,000 men,\r\nincluding the Guard, that it was all to be on the roads between\r\nOrleans and Bayonne by December, and that he should take command\r\nin person[206]. It may be noted that the troops designated in this\r\nmemorandum were actually those which took part in the campaign of\r\n1810, with the exception of the Old Guard, which was held back when\r\nNapoleon determined to remain behind, and to send a substitute as\r\ncommander-in-chief in Spain. Since the bulk of the immense column was\r\nonly directed to reach Bayonne at the end of the year, it was clear\r\nthat it would not be within striking distance of the enemy till March\r\n1810.\r\n\r\n  [206] Same to same, Oct. 7, 1809.\r\n\r\nDown to the month of December 1809, Napoleon’s correspondence\r\nteems with allusions to his approaching departure for Spain. They\r\nwere not merely intended to deceive the public, for they occur in\r\nletters to his most trusted ministers and generals. We might be\r\ninclined to suspect an intention to cajole the English Ministry in\r\nthe magnificent phrases of the address to the Corps Législatif on\r\nDecember 3, when the Emperor declares that ‘the moment he displays\r\nhimself beyond the Pyrenees the Leopard in terror will seek the Ocean\r\nto avoid shame, defeat, and death.’ But business was certainly meant\r\nwhen Berthier was advised to send forward his carriages and horses\r\nto Madrid, and when the Old Guard’s departure for the frontier was\r\nordered[207]. Suddenly, in the third week of December, the allusions\r\nto the Emperor’s impending departure cease. It would appear that his\r\nchange of purpose must be attributed not to the news of Ocaña, where\r\nthe last great Spanish army had perished, but to a purely domestic\r\ncause: this was the moment at which the question of the Imperial\r\nDivorce came into prominence. It would seem that when Napoleon had\r\nconceived the idea of the Austrian marriage, and had learnt that\r\nhis offers were likely to be accepted, he gave up all intention of\r\ninvading Spain in the early spring in person. The divorce was first\r\nofficially mooted when the ‘protest’ was laid before a Privy Council\r\non December 15[208], and after that day there is no more mention of\r\na departure for the South. All through January, February, and March\r\nthe negotiations were in progress, and on April 1-2[209] the Emperor\r\nmarried his new wife. The festivities which followed lasted many\r\ndays, and when they were over the Emperor conducted his spouse on a\r\nlong tour through the Northern Departments in May, and did not return\r\nto the vicinity of Paris till June, when the army of invasion, which\r\nhad long since reached the Peninsula, had been already handed over to\r\na new chief.\r\n\r\n  [207] Napoleon to Berthier, Nov. 28.\r\n\r\n  [208] Napoleon to Clarke, Dec. 5. Minute for the Privy Council\r\n  dated Dec. 15, in the _Correspondance_.\r\n\r\n  [209] The civil ceremony took place on the first, the religious\r\n  on the second of these two days.\r\n\r\nIn the months during which the marriage negotiations were in\r\nprogress, and the columns of reinforcements were pouring into\r\nNavarre and Old Castile, it is not quite certain what were the\r\nEmperor’s real intentions as to the allocation of the command.\r\nNothing clear can be deduced from an order given to Junot in the\r\nmiddle of February ‘to spread everywhere the news of the arrival of\r\nthe Emperor with 80,000 men, in order to disquiet the English and\r\nprevent them from undertaking operations in the South[210].’ This\r\nis but a _ruse de guerre_; the marriage project was so far advanced\r\nthat the ratifications of the contract were signed only four days\r\nlater than the date of the dispatch[211], and Napoleon must have\r\nknown that he could not get away from Paris for another two months\r\nat the least. But it was only on April 17 that an Imperial Decree,\r\ndated at Compiègne, was published, announcing that not the whole\r\nFrench force in Spain, but three army corps (the 2nd, 6th, and 8th),\r\nwith certain other troops, were to form the Army of Portugal and to\r\nbe placed under the command of Masséna, Duke of Rivoli and Prince of\r\nEssling. After this it was certain that the Emperor would not cross\r\nthe Pyrenees. Five days later this was made still more clear by an\r\norder to the Commandant of the Guard to recall the old Chasseur and\r\nGrenadier regiments of that corps from the various points that they\r\nhad reached on the way to Bayonne, and to send on to Spain only the\r\nTirailleur and Voltigeur regiments recently raised in 1809, and\r\ngenerally known as the ‘Young Guard’[212]. Napoleon never took the\r\nfield in person without the veteran portion of his body-guard.\r\n\r\n  [210] Napoleon to Berthier, Paris, Feb. 12.\r\n\r\n  [211] On Feb. 16: see Napoleon to King Joseph, Paris, Feb. 23.\r\n\r\n  [212] Napoleon to Clarke, April 22, 1810. Not in the\r\n  _Correspondance_, but given at length by Ducasse in his _Memoirs\r\n  of King Joseph_, vii. 275.\r\n\r\nThe non-appearance of the Emperor had one most important result. If\r\nhe had taken the field, every marshal and general in Spain would have\r\nbeen subject to a single directing will, and would have been forced\r\nto combine his operations with those of his neighbours, whether he\r\nwished or no. On determining to devote the spring and summer of 1810\r\nto nuptial feasts and state progresses, instead of to a campaign\r\non the Tagus, he did not nominate any single commander-in-chief\r\nto take his place. Masséna, from his seniority and his splendid\r\nmilitary record, might have seemed worthy of such promotion. He was\r\nnot given it, but only placed in charge of three army corps, and of\r\ncertain parts of Old Castile and Leon and the garrison troops there\r\nresiding. This was a vast charge, embracing in all the command of\r\n138,000 men. But it gave Masséna no control over the rest of the\r\narmies of Spain, and no power to secure their co-operation, save\r\nby the tedious method of appeals to Paris. Indeed, the Emperor had\r\nchosen the precise moment of King Joseph’s conquest of Andalusia to\r\nbreak up such hierarchical organization of command as existed in\r\nthe Peninsula. By a decree of February 8 he took the provinces of\r\nAragon and Catalonia, with the army corps there employed, completely\r\nout of the sphere of the authority of King Joseph: Augereau and\r\nSuchet were forbidden to hold any communication with Madrid, and\r\nwere directed to make every report and request to Paris. This would\r\nnot have been fatal to the success of the main operations of the\r\nFrench army, for Aragon and Catalonia were a side-issue, whose\r\nmilitary history, all through the war, had little connexion with\r\nthat of Castile and Portugal. But their severance from the military\r\nhierarchy dependent on the King was followed by that of Navarre,\r\nthe Basque provinces, Burgos, Valladolid, Palencia, and Toro, which\r\nwere formed into four ‘Military Governments’ under Generals Dufour,\r\nThouvenot, Dorsenne, and Kellermann. These governors were given\r\ncomplete civil and military autonomy, with power to raise taxes,\r\nadminister justice, to name and displace Spanish functionaries, and\r\nto move their troops at their own pleasure, under responsibility to\r\nthe Emperor alone. The ‘6th Government’ (Valladolid, Palencia, Toro)\r\nwas afterwards placed under the authority of Masséna; the others\r\nremained independent Viceroyalties. Thus military authority in the\r\nPeninsula was divided up for the future between (1) the Commander of\r\nthe Army of Portugal, who controlled not only his army but all the\r\nregions which it occupied--Leon, the greater part of Old Castile, and\r\npart of Estremadura; (2) the military governors of Catalonia, Aragon,\r\nNavarre, Biscay, Burgos; (3) the King, who practically controlled his\r\nArmy of the Centre and the kingdom of New Castile alone, since Soult,\r\nin Andalusia, though not formally created a ‘military governor,’\r\npractically acted on his own responsibility, without any reference\r\nto the King’s wishes. All the viceroys reported directly to Paris,\r\nand kept the Emperor fully employed with their perpetual bickerings.\r\nHow Napoleon came to create and continue such a vicious system it\r\nis hard to conceive. Apparently the explanation must be sought in\r\nthe fact that he feared servants with too great power, and acted on\r\nthe principle of _divide et impera_, despite of the fact that he\r\nknew, as a soldier, that the want of a commander-in-chief is ruinous\r\nin practical war. At the bottom was the idea that he himself could\r\nmanage everything, even when his armies were a thousand miles away,\r\nand when it took three weeks or a month to transmit orders to them.\r\nHe sometimes acknowledged in a moment of self-realization that this\r\nwas a bad arrangement, and that it was impossible for him to conduct\r\nor criticize the details of strategy at such a distance, or under\r\nsuch conditions. But after a lucid moment he would fall back into\r\nhis usual ways of thought, and proceed to give orders and directions\r\nwhich were obsolete before the dispatches that conveyed them could be\r\ndelivered to the hands of his marshals.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to details--the old Army of Spain had come to a standstill\r\nafter it had overrun Andalusia in February 1810. Three corps\r\nunder Soult were absorbed by that new conquest, some 73,000 men\r\nin all[213]. Suchet with his 3rd Corps, 26,000 men, held Aragon;\r\nAugereau with the vast 7th Corps, 56,900 in all, did not hold down,\r\nbut was executing military promenades in, the turbulent Catalonia.\r\nThe 2nd and 6th Corps lay observing Portugal, the former with head\r\nquarters at Talavera, the latter with head quarters at Salamanca. Ney\r\nhad now returned to take charge of the 6th Corps, and Reynier (an old\r\nenemy of the English, who had beaten him at Alexandria and Maida) was\r\nnamed chief of the 2nd Corps. This last had now been shorn of its\r\nthird division,--that which had been composed of so many fractional\r\nunits in 1809; these had been made over to the 6th Corps, which in\r\n1810 possessed three divisions[214] and no longer two. Reynier had\r\nabout 18,000 men, Ney no less than 38,000 after this rearrangement;\r\nhe had been assigned Lorges’ dragoon-division as well as the troops\r\ntransferred from the 2nd Corps. The King had 14,000 men in Madrid\r\nand New Castile: the old garrisons of the Northern Provinces,\r\nexcluding the newly arrived reinforcements, made up nearly 20,000 men\r\nmore. This 237,000 sabres and bayonets represents the old army of\r\n1809[215]; the troops sent down by the Emperor after the termination\r\nof the Austrian War had not, for the most part, been absorbed into\r\nthe old units, though they had crossed the Pyrenees in December and\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n  [213] Note that the 4th Corps had left behind in Madrid 6,000\r\n  men of its 1st division (the 28th Léger, 32nd and 75th Line) and\r\n  taken on instead 8,000 men of the division Dessolles, properly\r\n  forming part of the ‘Army of the Centre.’\r\n\r\n  [214] Loison’s division of the 6th Corps received these stray\r\n  battalions, which were united to those of the same regiments\r\n  which had crossed the Pyrenees with him. They consisted of\r\n  a battalion each of the _Légion du Midi_, of the _Légion\r\n  Hanovrienne_, the 26th, 66th, 82nd of the line, and the 32nd\r\n  Léger.\r\n\r\n  [215] All these figures are _inclusive_ of men sick and detached,\r\n  the former about 16,000, the latter 44,000.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to see what troops constituted these succours, the\r\n100,000 men with whom the Emperor had originally intended to march\r\nin person to the conquest of the Peninsula. On looking through\r\ntheir muster roll the first thing that strikes the eye is that very\r\nlittle--almost nothing indeed--had been taken from the Army of\r\nGermany. The Emperor, though Austria was tamed and Prussia was under\r\nhis feet, did not think it safe to cut down to any great extent the\r\ngarrisons of Central Europe and Eastern France:\r\n\r\n(1) Of all the corps that had taken part in the Wagram campaign only\r\none had been directed on Spain, and this was a force of the second\r\nline, a unit originally called the ‘Corps de Réserve de l’Armée\r\nd’Allemagne’ and afterwards the 8th Corps. It had played only a small\r\npart in the late war, and was mostly composed of the newly raised 4th\r\nbattalions of regiments serving elsewhere. Recruited up to a strength\r\nof 30,000 men by the addition of some stray battalions from Northern\r\nGermany, it was the first of all the new reinforcements to reach\r\nSpain[216]. Indeed, the head of its column reached Burgos by the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1810. It was assigned to the Army of Portugal. By the drafting\r\naway of some of its 4th battalions to join the regiments to which they\r\nappertained it ultimately came down to about 20,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [216] Junot’s original corps was reinforced by the 22nd of the\r\n  line (4 batts.) drawn from the Prussian fortresses, and by some\r\n  units which had hitherto been doing garrison duty in Navarrese\r\n  and Biscayan fortresses, where they were now replaced by the\r\n  Young Guard. Among these were the Irish Brigade (2 batts.) and\r\n  the Prussian regiment which had formed the original garrison of\r\n  Pampeluna.\r\n\r\n(2) Next in point of importance were the two divisions of the Young\r\nGuard under Generals Roguet and Dumoustier, nineteen battalions,\r\nwith three provisional regiments of the Guard Cavalry, nearly 15,000\r\nmen in all. These units had been formed in 1809, just in time for\r\nsome of them to take their share in the bloody days of Essling and\r\nWagram. The Emperor did not make them over to the Army of Portugal,\r\nbut retained them in Biscay and Navarre, close under the Pyrenees.\r\nApparently he disliked sending any of his Guards so far afield as\r\nto render it difficult to draw them back to France, in the event\r\n(unlikely as it was at this moment) of further troubles breaking out\r\nin Central Europe. The Guard divisions stayed in Spain two years, but\r\nwere never allowed to go far forward into the interior.\r\n\r\n(3) Deeply impressed with the danger and difficulty of keeping up the\r\nlines of communication between Bayonne and Madrid, since Mina and\r\nhis coadjutors had set the guerrilla war on foot in Navarre and Old\r\nCastile, Napoleon had formed a corps whose special duty was to be\r\nthe keeping open of the roads, and the policing of the country-side\r\nbetween the frontier and the Spanish capital. This was composed of\r\ntwenty squadrons of _Gendarmes_, all veterans and picked men, each\r\nwith a total strength of seven officers and 200 troopers. The decree\r\nordering their selection from among the _gendarmerie_ of Southern\r\nand Central France was published on November 24, 1809: but the first\r\nsquadrons only began to pass the Pyrenees in February 1810, and many\r\ndid not appear till April and May. Yet 4,000 men were in line by the\r\nsummer[217].\r\n\r\n  [217] For details of this corps and its services see the\r\n  monograph, _La Gendarmerie en Espagne et Portugal_, by E. Martin,\r\n  Paris, 1898.\r\n\r\n(4) A few new regiments which had not hitherto been represented in\r\nthe Peninsula were moved down thither. Among these were the Neuchâtel\r\ntroops from Berthier’s principality, a German division from the minor\r\nstates of the Confederation of the Rhine under General Rouyer[218],\r\nwhich went to Catalonia, the 7th, 13th, and 25th _Chasseurs à\r\nCheval_, with two battalions of Marines. The total did not amount to\r\nmore than some 10,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [218] Nine battalions as follows: Two of Nassau, the others from\r\n  Gotha, Weimar, Altenburg, Waldeck, Reuss, Schwarzburg, Anhalt,\r\n  and Lippe; strength about 6,000 men.\r\n\r\n(5) By far the largest item in the reinforcements was composed of\r\nthe 4th battalions of wellnigh every regiment which was already\r\nserving in Spain. The army which had marched across the Pyrenees\r\nin 1808 had been organized on the basis of three field-battalions\r\nto the regiment, the 4th battalion being the dépôt battalion. But\r\nNapoleon had now raised the standard to four (or in a few cases more)\r\nfield-battalions, over and above the dépôt. All the fourth battalions\r\nwere now existing and available; a few had served in the Austrian\r\nWar, many of the others had been lying in the camps which the\r\nEmperor had formed at Boulogne, Pontivy, and elsewhere, to protect\r\nhis coasts against possible English descents. Those belonging to 40\r\nregiments already in Spain, with the full complement of 840 men each,\r\nwere first ordered to cross the Pyrenees: they numbered 33,600 men:\r\nthese were all at the front by May 1810. The Emperor somewhat later\r\ndispatched the fourth battalions of twenty-six regiments more to the\r\nPeninsula, giving to the temporary organization the name of the 9th\r\nCorps. This should have given another 21,840 men, and nearly did so;\r\ntheir gross total, when all had reached Vittoria in September 1810,\r\nwas 20,231. But the 9th Corps should not be reckoned in the first\r\n100,000 men which the Emperor set aside for the spring campaign of\r\n1810, it was a supplementary addition[219].\r\n\r\n  [219] The 4th battalions ultimately retained in Junot’s corps did\r\n  not for the most part belong to regiments of the Spanish army,\r\n  but to regiments in Germany or the colonies. They are over and\r\n  above the 66 fourth battalions accounted for in the list above.\r\n  For details of the whole set of reinforcements see Tables in\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\n(6) The Emperor dealt in a similar way with the cavalry; the\r\nregiments already in Spain had been reduced to a strength of two or\r\nthree squadrons by the wear and tear of eighteen months of war. The\r\ndépôts had now got ready two squadrons fit for field service. Those\r\nbelonging to sixteen regiments of dragoons, organized into eight\r\nprovisional regiments, were sent early to the front, and were all in\r\nSpain by January 1810.\r\n\r\n(7) In addition to units like 4th battalions and 3rd and 4th\r\nsquadrons added to the strength of each dragoon or infantry regiment,\r\nthe Emperor did not neglect to send drafts to fill up the depleted\r\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd battalions and 1st and 2nd squadrons. In the early\r\nmonths of 1810, 27,000 men, in small drafts not amounting to the\r\nstrength of a battalion or squadron were forwarded to recruit the old\r\nunits. They went forward in ‘régiments de marche,’ which were broken\r\nup on reaching the head quarters of the corps to which each party\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nAdding together all the units, with an extra allowance of 3,500\r\nartillery for the new batteries that came in with Junot’s Corps,\r\nthe Guard divisions, and the 9th Corps, we get as a total of the\r\nreinforcements poured into Spain between December 1809, and September\r\n1810, the following figures:--\r\n\r\n  Junot’s corps, at its final strength in June,\r\n    infantry only                                  20,000\r\n  Young Guard divisions                            15,000\r\n  Gendarmerie                                       4,000\r\n  New regiments                                    10,000\r\n  4th battalions, the first arrivals               33,600\r\n  4th battalions forming the 9th Corps             20,000\r\n  Cavalry in organized squadrons                    5,000\r\n  Artillery in complete batteries                   3,500\r\n  Drafts, not in permanent units, for Infantry,\r\n    Cavalry, and Artillery                         27,000\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                                                  138,100\r\n\r\nThis total far exceeds the original 100,000 of which Napoleon had\r\nspoken in the autumn of 1809, but is certainly rather below the\r\nactual number of men received into the Peninsula; the figure for\r\ndrafts, in especial, is hard to verify. But as the total strength\r\nof the Army of Spain in the autumn of 1809 was 237,000 men, and in\r\nSeptember 1810, 353,000 men, while at least 25,000 had been lost in\r\nthe interval[220], the figures cannot be far out.\r\n\r\n  [220] Over and above the ordinary death-rate for French troops\r\n  quartered in Spain, which was very high, we have to allow for the\r\n  losses at Tamames, Ocaña, the conquest of Andalusia, the sieges\r\n  of Astorga, Gerona, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Almeida, and all smaller\r\n  engagements.\r\n\r\nOf this total, as we have already said, the 2nd, 6th, and 8th Corps\r\nand the troops under Kellermann and Bonnet occupying the provinces\r\nof Toro, Palencia, Valladolid, and Santander formed the ‘Army of\r\nPortugal’ assigned to Masséna; he was also given an extra unattached\r\ndivision under Serras[221], and promised the use of the 9th Corps\r\nwhen it should have crossed the Pyrenees. The gross total of this\r\nforce was in May, when the new Commander-in-Chief had taken up his\r\npost, about 130,000 men, of whom some 86,000 were effective and\r\navailable for active operations at the moment. Serras, Kellermann,\r\nand Bonnet were tied down to their local duties--the first had to\r\nlook after the Spanish army of Galicia, the second to keep the plains\r\nof Valladolid quiet, the third to hold Santander and (when it was\r\nfully subdued) to enter and overrun the Asturias. The 20,000 men of\r\nthe 9th Corps were not yet arrived in Spain[222]. The troops in the\r\nprovinces of Burgos, Biscay, and Navarre, though not placed under the\r\nMarshal’s actual command, were yet in existence to cover his rear and\r\nhis communications with France. If they are added to the total of the\r\nforce which, directly or indirectly, was employed for the conquest\r\nof Portugal, some 30,000 more must be taken into consideration. But,\r\nthough they were useful, indeed indispensable, for the conquest of\r\nPortugal, it is fairer to leave them out of consideration.\r\n\r\n  [221] This division had charge of the Provinces of Leon, Zamora,\r\n  and Salamanca, which were not a ‘military government.’\r\n\r\n  [222] Roughly, on May 15, 2nd Corps 20,000 men, 6th ditto 35,000,\r\n  8th ditto 26,000, Cavalry reserve 5,000, effectives present under\r\n  arms, besides the sick, who made up about 12,000 more, and some\r\n  6,000 men detached. See Tables in Appendix.\r\n\r\nBut the exact total of an army is, after all, less important than\r\nthe character and capacity of its generals. The individuality of\r\nMasséna was the most important factor in the problem of the invasion\r\nof Portugal. He was fifty-two years of age--very nearly the eldest\r\nof all the Marshals--and he was the only one of those on active\r\nservice, save Jourdan, who had achieved greatness in the days\r\nbefore Napoleon arrived at supreme power. He had led an army of\r\n60,000 men when, of the three corps-commanders now under him, Ney\r\nwas but a lieutenant-colonel, Junot a young captain, and Reynier a\r\nbrigadier-general. Like nearly all the men of the Revolution he had\r\nrisen from below; he sprang from a poor family in Genoa: according to\r\nhis enemies they were Jews, and his name was but Manasseh disguised.\r\nHis personal character was detestable; many of the marshals had an\r\nevil reputation for financial probity, but Masséna’s was the worst\r\nof all. ‘He plundered like a _condottiere_ of the Middle Ages,’\r\nwrote one of his lieutenants. He had been in trouble, both with\r\nthe Republican government and with the Emperor, for his shameless\r\nmalversations in Italy, and had piled up a large private fortune by\r\nsurreptitious methods[223]. Avarice is not usually associated with\r\nlicentiousness, but he shocked even the easy-going public opinion\r\nof the French army by the way in which he paraded his mistress at\r\nunsuitable moments and in unsuitable company. He took this person,\r\nthe sister of one of his aides-de-camp, with him all through the\r\ndangers of the Portuguese campaign, where her presence often caused\r\nfriction and delays, and occasionally exposed him to insults[224].\r\nMasséna was hard, suspicious, and revengeful; an intriguer to the\r\nfinger-tips, he was always prone to suppose that others were\r\nintriguing against himself[225]. Though an old Republican, who had\r\nrisen from the ranks early in the revolutionary war, he had done\r\nhis best to make himself agreeable to Napoleon by the arts of the\r\ncourtier. Altogether, he was a detestable character--but he was a\r\ngreat general. Of all the marshals of the Empire he was undoubtedly\r\nthe most capable; Davoust and Soult, with all their abilities, were\r\nnot up to his level. As a proof of his boldness and rapid skill in\r\nseizing an opportunity the battle of Zurich is sufficient to quote;\r\nfor his splendid obstinacy the defence of Genoa at the commencement\r\nof his career has its parallel in the long endurance before the lines\r\nof Torres Vedras at its end. His best testimonial is that Wellington,\r\nwhen asked, long years after, which of his old opponents was the best\r\nsoldier, replied without hesitation that Masséna was the man, and\r\nthat he had never permitted himself to take in his presence the risks\r\nthat he habitually accepted when confronted with any of the other\r\nmarshals[226].\r\n\r\n  [223] The Emperor once confiscated 3,000,000 francs which Masséna\r\n  had collected by selling licences to trade with the English at\r\n  Leghorn and other Italian ports. See the Memoirs of General\r\n  Lamarque, who carried out the seizure.\r\n\r\n  [224] See Thiébault, iv. 375; Marbot, ii. 380-1; Duchesse\r\n  d’Abrantes, viii. 50. All these may be called scandal-mongers,\r\n  but the lady’s presence, and the troubles to which it gave rise,\r\n  are chronicled by more serious authorities.\r\n\r\n  [225] See Foy’s complaints on p. 114 of his _Vie Militaire_ (ed.\r\n  Girod de L’Ain) as to the way in which the Marshal suspected him\r\n  of undermining his favour with the Emperor.\r\n\r\n  [226] See Lord Stanhope’s _Conversations with the Duke of\r\n  Wellington_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  ANDRÉ MASSÉNA, DUC DE RIVOLI PRINCE D’ESSLING,\r\n  Né à Nice, en 1755,\r\n  Mort à sa Terre près Paris, en Avril 1817.]\r\n\r\nThe fatigues of the late Austrian war, in which he had borne such\r\nan honourable part, had tried Masséna’s health; it was not without\r\ndifficulty that the Emperor had persuaded him to undertake the\r\nPortuguese campaign. When he first assembled round him at Salamanca\r\nthe staff which was to serve him in the invasion, he astonished\r\nand somewhat disheartened his officers by beginning his greetings\r\nto them with the remark, ‘Gentlemen, I am here contrary to my own\r\nwish; I begin to feel myself too old and too weary to go on active\r\nservice. The Emperor says that I must, and replied to the reasons for\r\ndeclining this post which I gave him, by saying that my reputation\r\nwould suffice to end the war. It was very flattering no doubt, but\r\nno man has two lives to live on this earth--the soldier least of\r\nall[227].’ Those who had served under the Marshal a few years back,\r\nand now saw him after an interval, felt that there was truth in what\r\nhe said. Foy wrote in his diary, ‘He is no longer the Masséna of the\r\nflashing eyes, the mobile face, and the alert figure whom I knew\r\nin 1799, and whose head then recalled to me the bust of Marius. He\r\nis only fifty-two, but looks more than sixty; he has got thin, he\r\nis beginning to stoop; his look, since the accident when he lost\r\nhis eye by the Emperor’s hand[228], has lost its vivacity. The tone\r\nof his voice alone remains unchanged.’ But if the Marshal’s bodily\r\nvigour was somewhat abated, his will was as strong as ever. He needed\r\nit at this juncture, for he had to command subordinates who were\r\nanything but easy to deal with. Ney, though an honest man and an\r\nadmirable soldier, had the fault of insubordination in the highest\r\ndegree. He never obeyed any one save the Emperor in the true military\r\nfashion. He quarrelled with every colleague that he met--notably\r\nwith Soult--and had an old and very justifiable personal dislike for\r\nMasséna. Even before the latter appeared at the front, he had been\r\nheard to use threatening language concerning him. Junot was almost as\r\nbad; having held the chief command in the last Portuguese expedition\r\nhe had a strong, if a mistaken, belief that it was becoming that he\r\nshould be placed in charge of the second. His record rendered the\r\nidea absurd, but this he was the last to understand, being of an\r\noverweening and self-confident disposition. He was stupid enough to\r\nregard Masséna as his supplanter, and to show sullen resentment. Of\r\nthe three chiefs of the army corps about to invade Portugal, Reynier\r\nwas the only one on decent terms with his Commander-in-Chief, but\r\neven he was not reckoned his friend[229].\r\n\r\n  [227] This comes from an eye-witness with no grudge against\r\n  Masséna, Hulot, commanding the artillery of the 8th Corps. See\r\n  his _Mémoires_, p. 303.\r\n\r\n  [228] Foy, p. 101. The Emperor, a notoriously bad shot, lodged\r\n  some pellets in the Marshal’s left eye while letting fly at\r\n  a pheasant. Napoleon turned round and accused his faithful\r\n  Berthier of having fired the shot: the Prince of Neuchâtel was\r\n  courtier enough to take the blame without a word, and in official\r\n  histories appears as the culprit (see e. g. Amic’s _Masséna_,\r\n  p. 272); for other notes see Guingret, p. 250. What is most\r\n  astonishing is that Masséna was complaisant enough to affect to\r\n  blame Berthier for the disaster.\r\n\r\n  [229] See the admirable summary of all this in Foy’s diary (Girod\r\n  de L’Ain), p. 101. Marbot gives the same views at bottom, but\r\n  with his usual exaggeration, and with ‘illustrative anecdotes,’\r\n  occasionally of doubtful accuracy.\r\n\r\nMasséna’s chief of the staff was Fririon, a scientific soldier and\r\na man well liked by his colleagues; but it is said that he was not\r\nso much in the Marshal’s confidence as Lieut.-Colonel Pelet, the\r\nsenior aide de camp of his staff. Complaints are found, in some\r\nof the letters and memoirs of the time, that Masséna would talk\r\nmatters over with Pelet, and issue orders without letting even his\r\nchief of the staff know of his change of plan or new inspiration.\r\nPelet’s own indiscreet statements on this point seem to justify the\r\ncomplaints made by others against him[230]. There was friction,\r\ntherefore, even within the staff itself, and all that the Marshal\r\ndid, or said, was criticized by some of those who should have been\r\nhis loyal subordinates, under the notion that it had been inspired by\r\nothers, who were accorded a more perfect confidence by their common\r\nchief. Exact knowledge of the disputes in the _État Major_ is hard\r\nto obtain, because, when the campaign was over, every man tried to\r\nmake out that its failure had been due to the advice given to Masséna\r\nby those of whom he was jealous. At the bottom, however, all this\r\ncontroversy is not very important--there is no doubt that the Marshal\r\nhimself was responsible for all that had happened--he was not the man\r\nto be led by the nose or over-persuaded by ambitious or intriguing\r\nunderlings.\r\n\r\n  [230] Note Pelet’s _Aperçu sur la Campagne de Portugal_, nearly\r\n  forty pages in the Appendix to _Victoires et Conquêtes_, vol.\r\n  xxi: for his disputes with Baron Fririon see the _Spectateur\r\n  Militaire_ for 1841. Pelet says, ignoring the chief of the staff\r\n  entirely, ‘qu’il était investi de la confiance _absolue_ du\r\n  maréchal: qu’il faisait _seul_ auprès de lui tout le travail\r\n  militaire et politique, qu’il dirigeait la haute correspondance\r\n  avec le major-général (Berthier) et les chefs de corps, etc.,\r\n  etc.’ For Fririon’s comparative impotence see a story on p. 387\r\n  of Marbot’s vol. ii, which may or may not be true--probably the\r\n  former.\r\n\r\n  Pelet’s writings give a poor impression of his brain-power and\r\n  his love of exact truth. He says, for example, in his _Aperçu_\r\n  that Masséna had only 40,000 men in his army of invasion, when it\r\n  is certain that he had 64,000. See Baron Fririon’s remarks on him\r\n  in _Spectateur Militaire_, June 1841, pp. 1-5.\r\n\r\nFailure or success is not the sole criterion of merit. Masséna’s\r\ncampaign was a disastrous business; yet on investigating the\r\ndisabilities under which he laboured, we shall be inclined in the\r\nend to marvel that he did so much, not that he did no more. The\r\nfundamental error was the Emperor’s, who gave him too few men for\r\nthe enterprise with which he was entrusted. Napoleon refused to\r\ntake the Portuguese troops into consideration, when he weighed the\r\nneeds of the expedition. He repeatedly wrote that ‘it was absurd\r\nthat his armies should be held in check by 25,000 or 30,000 British\r\ntroops,’ as if nothing else required to be taken into consideration.\r\nHe did not realize that Wellington had turned the Portuguese regular\r\narmy into a decent fighting machine, capable of holding back French\r\ndivisions in line of battle--as was shown at Bussaco. He had not\r\nforeseen that the despised militia required to be ‘contained’ by\r\nadequate numbers of troops on the line of communications. Still less\r\nhad he dreamed of the great scheme for the devastation of Portugal,\r\nwhich was to be not the least effective of the weapons of its\r\ndefender. But of this more will be said in the proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MONTHS OF WAITING: SIEGE OF ASTORGA (MARCH-MAY 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nMasséna, as we have seen, was only appointed Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Army of Portugal on April 17, 1810, and did not appear at\r\nValladolid, to take up his charge, till May. The campaign, however,\r\nhad begun long before under the Emperor’s own directions. There\r\nwere preliminary operations to be carried out, which could be\r\nfinished before either the new General-in-Chief or the main body\r\nof the reinforcements from beyond the Pyrenees had arrived. These\r\nwere the repression of the insurgent bands of Navarre, Biscay, and\r\nOld Castile, the firm establishment of the line of communications\r\nbetween Salamanca and Bayonne, and the capture of the outlying\r\nSpanish fortresses, Astorga and Ciudad Rodrigo, which served as\r\nexternal defences for the Portuguese frontier. ‘Les besoins en\r\nEspagne sont successifs,’ wrote the Emperor early in the winter of\r\n1809-10[231], ‘il faut d’abord un corps qui soumette les derrières.\r\nÉtant en Novembre il serait impossible de réunir tous les moyens\r\navant du commencement de janvier. Et dans cette presqu’île coupée de\r\nmontagnes les froids et les neiges de janvier ne permettront de rien\r\nfaire.’ All that he could do before spring would be to send forward\r\nJunot’s corps, and the other earlier reinforcements, to positions\r\nfrom which they should be ready to strike, the moment that the fine\r\nweather began. With the coming of the new year, when these corps had\r\nreached their destined positions, the imperial orders begin to abound\r\nin elaborate directions for the extermination of the guerrillas of\r\nthe Upper Ebro and the Upper Douro[232], orders which led to much\r\nmarching and counter-marching of the newly arrived troops, but to\r\nlittle practical effect in the way of repression, for skilled leaders\r\nlike Mina, the Empecinado, and Julian Sanchez, nearly always slipped\r\nbetween the fingers of their pursuers, and on the few occasions when\r\nthey were pressed into a corner, simply bade their men disperse and\r\nunite again at some distant rendezvous. These operations, however,\r\nwere wholly subsidiary: the actual advance against Portugal only\r\ncommences with the orders given to Junot in February to concentrate\r\nhis corps at Valladolid, to hand over the charge of Salamanca and Old\r\nCastile to Kellermann’s dragoons and the divisions of the 6th Corps,\r\nand then to subdue the whole of the plain-land of Leon, as far as the\r\nfoot of the Asturian and Galician mountains, including the towns of\r\nBenavente, Leon, and Astorga. Bonnet and his division, now as always\r\nbased on Santander, were already advancing to invade the Asturias,\r\nand to threaten Galicia from the east. Ney with the 6th Corps was\r\nordered to draw near to the frontier of Portugal on the side of\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, ‘to inundate all the approaches to that kingdom with\r\nhis cavalry, disquiet the English, and prevent them from dreaming\r\nof transferring themselves back to the south.’ The news of the near\r\napproach of the Emperor himself with 80,000 men was to be spread in\r\nevery direction[233].\r\n\r\n  [231] Napoleon to Clarke, Oct. 30, 1809.\r\n\r\n  [232] See for example Jan. 20, 1810, to Berthier; Jan. 31, to\r\n  same; Feb. 12, to same.\r\n\r\n  [233] _Correspondance_, vol. xx, Napoleon to Berthier, Feb. 12,\r\n  1810.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the third great unit which was to form part of the\r\nprojected Army of Portugal, the 2nd Corps (under the temporary\r\ncommand of General Heudelet[234]), was taking part in a separate and\r\nremote series of operations, far to the South. This corps, it will be\r\nremembered, had been left on the Tagus about Talavera and Oropesa,\r\nto protect the rear of Soult and King Joseph, when they marched\r\nin January with the 1st, 4th, and 5th Corps to conquer Andalusia.\r\nThat exploit having been accomplished, Mortier went, with half of\r\nthe 5th Corps, to attack Badajoz, and to subdue Estremadura, which\r\nSoult imagined to be defenceless, since Albuquerque had marched\r\nwith the old Estremaduran army to save Cadiz. Mortier advanced\r\nunopposed to the walls of Badajoz, which he reached on February 12,\r\nbut found himself unable to undertake its siege with his small force\r\nof 9,000 men, because a new Spanish host had just appeared upon\r\nthe scene. La Romana, with three of the divisions of the army that\r\nhad been beaten at Alba de Tormes in November, had marched down the\r\nSpanish-Portuguese frontier by the Pass of Perales; and on the same\r\nday that Mortier appeared in front of Badajoz, his vanguard arrived\r\nat Albuquerque, only twenty miles away. These divisions were 13,000\r\nstrong: La Romana could add to this force a few thousands more left\r\nbehind by Albuquerque. Mortier rightly felt that he dare not commence\r\nthe regular siege of Badajoz when he had such superior numbers in\r\nhis front. He therefore asked for reinforcements, both from Soult\r\nand from King Joseph. The former could spare nothing from Andalusia\r\nat this moment, but the 2nd Corps was ordered to leave the Tagus\r\nand place itself in communication with Mortier. Heudelet had other\r\nprojects on hand at the moment: he had just seized Plasencia on\r\nFebruary 10, and was engaged in bickering with Carlos d’España and\r\nMartin Carrera, whom La Romana had left in the Sierra de Gata. But,\r\nin obedience to his orders, he called in his detachments, and marched\r\nby Deleytosa and Truxillo into the valley of the Guadiana. This\r\nmovement, from the French point of view, was a hazardous one; by the\r\ntransference southward of the 2nd Corps, a long gap was left between\r\nNey at Salamanca and Heudelet and Mortier in Estremadura. No troops\r\nwhatever covered Madrid from the side of the south-west and the\r\nvalley of the Tagus, and an irruption of the English on this line was\r\none of the dangers which Napoleon most dreaded[235]. He was unaware\r\nof Wellington’s deeply-rooted determination to commit himself to no\r\nmore Spanish campaigns.\r\n\r\n  [234] Soult had given up the 2nd Corps when he became King\r\n  Joseph’s Major-General: Reynier, appointed to command it, had not\r\n  yet appeared.\r\n\r\n  [235] ‘Il faut prévoir que les Anglais peuvent marcher sur\r\n  Talavera pour faire diversion,’ wrote Napoleon on Jan. 31 to\r\n  Berthier. But Heudelet had been moved before his caution could\r\n  reach Madrid.\r\n\r\nLong before Heudelet approached the Guadiana, Mortier had been\r\ncompelled, partly by want of supplies, partly by the threatening\r\nattitude of La Romana, who began cautiously to turn his flanks, to\r\nretire from in front of the walls of Badajoz. He gave back as far\r\nas Zafra on the road to the south, and six days after marched for\r\nSeville, leaving only a rearguard at Santa Ollala, on the extreme\r\nborder of Estremadura. Soult required his presence, for, on account\r\nof a rising in Granada, and a threatening movement by the Spanish\r\narmy of Murcia, the French reserves in Andalusia had been moved\r\neastward, and its capital was almost stripped of troops. Hence when\r\nthe 2nd Corps reached Caçeres on March 8, and appeared in front of\r\nAlbuquerque on March 14, it found that the 5th Corps had departed,\r\nand that it was nearly 100 miles from the nearest friendly post.\r\nHeudelet, therefore, having all La Romana’s army in his front, and\r\nno orders to execute (since the junction with Mortier had failed),\r\nretired to Merida, where Reynier arrived from the north, superseded\r\nhim, and took command. Here the 2nd Corps remained practically\r\npassive for the rest of the spring, keeping open, but with difficulty\r\nand at long intervals, the communications between Madrid and Seville,\r\nby means of detachments at Truxillo and Almaraz. To a certain\r\nextent Reynier kept La Romana’s army in check, but he did not fully\r\ndischarge even that moderate task, for the Spanish general detached\r\nsouthward two of his divisions, those of Contreras and Ballasteros,\r\nto threaten the frontiers of Andalusia and stir up an insurrection\r\nin the Condado de Niebla and the other regions west of Seville.\r\nBallasteros surprised the cavalry brigade of Mortier’s corps at\r\nValverde, at midnight on February 19, and scattered it, killing\r\nBeauregard, the brigadier. He then advanced to Ronquillo, only twenty\r\nmiles from Seville, where, on March 25-6, he had an indecisive\r\nengagement with one of Gazan’s brigades, after which he retired into\r\nthe Condado. Mortier, thereupon, came out against him from Seville at\r\nthe head of a whole division. Unwisely offering battle at Zalamea,\r\non the Rio Tinto, on April 15, Ballasteros was beaten, and retired\r\ninto the mountains. Thither, after some time, he was pursued by\r\nMortier’s columns, and again defeated at Araçena on May 26. But he\r\nrallied his broken force in the Sierra de Araçena, where he remained\r\nfor long after, a thorn in the side of the Army of Andalusia, always\r\ndescending for a raid in the plains of Seville when he was left\r\nunwatched. Soult was forced to keep a considerable part of the 5th\r\nCorps in observation of him--a detachment that he was loth to spare.\r\n\r\nLa Romana’s central divisions, meanwhile, those of Charles O’Donnell\r\n(brother of the Henry O’Donnell who had distinguished himself at\r\nGerona in the previous autumn), Mendizabal, and Contreras, bickered\r\nwith the 2nd Corps in the direction of Caçeres and Torresnovas,\r\nwithout any notable advantage on either side. But as long as Reynier\r\nlay at Merida, and Mortier might at any moment come up from Seville\r\nto his aid, Wellington felt uneasy as to the possibility of a French\r\nadvance between Tagus and Guadiana, and, regarding La Romana’s army\r\nas an insufficient security on this side, moved Hill with a force\r\nof 12,000 men to Portalegre, close to the rear of Badajoz. Hill had\r\nwith his own British division, now consisting of three brigades[236],\r\nanother division composed of Portuguese, under General Hamilton[237],\r\nthe English heavy cavalry brigade of Slade, a weak Portuguese cavalry\r\nbrigade under Madden[238], and three batteries. He was ordered not\r\nto countenance any offensive movements on the part of La Romana, but\r\nto support him, and to endeavour to cover Badajoz, if the French\r\nshould unite the 2nd and 5th Corps, and make a serious move westward.\r\nThere was no need, as matters turned out, for any such support,\r\nfor Reynier, though he executed some rather useless feints and\r\ncounter-marches in April and May, undertook nothing serious. One of\r\nhis demonstrations drew Hill to Arronches, close to Elvas, on May 14,\r\nbut it turned out to be meaningless, and the British troops returned\r\nto their usual head quarters at Portalegre a few days later. There\r\nseems to have been some uncertainty of purpose in all this manœuvring\r\nof the French in Estremadura. Reynier was not strong enough to offer\r\nto fight La Romana and Hill combined; he might have done so with good\r\nprospect of success if Mortier could have been spared from Andalusia;\r\nbut half the 5th Corps was usually detached far to the south,\r\nhunting the insurgents of the Sierra de Ronda, and the other half\r\nhad to garrison Seville and watch Ballasteros. Hence Reynier, left\r\nto himself, did no more for the common cause of the French in Spain\r\nthan detain Hill’s two divisions in the Alemtejo. That Wellington\r\nwas thus obliged to divide his army was no doubt a permanent gain\r\nto the enemy: yet they obtained it by the very doubtful expedient of\r\nleaving nothing on the Tagus; a push in the direction of Plasencia\r\nand Almaraz by even a small Spanish force would have been a very\r\ntiresome and troublesome matter for King Joseph, who would have been\r\nforced either to bring down Ney from Salamanca, or to call Reynier\r\nback from the Guadiana, for Madrid was entirely uncovered on the\r\nWest. But nothing of the sort happened; La Romana kept his main\r\nbody concentrated in front of Badajoz, and had the full approval of\r\nWellington for doing so.\r\n\r\n  [236] Hill’s division, two brigades strong at Talavera in August,\r\n  had received a third brigade in September under Catlin Craufurd,\r\n  consisting of the 2/28th, 2/34th, and 2/39th.\r\n\r\n  [237] Composed of the 2nd, 4th, 10th, and 14th regiments, each\r\n  two battalions strong, with 4,500 bayonets.\r\n\r\n  [238] 1st and 4th Portuguese cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme opposite flank of the French front, on the shores\r\nof the Bay of Biscay, there was going on at this same time a\r\nside-campaign conducted with a much greater degree of vigour, but\r\nequally indecisive in the end. The Asturias had been almost stripped\r\nof troops by Del Parque, in order to reinforce the army that fought\r\nat Tamames and Alba de Tormes. When the Duke moved his main force\r\nsouthward after the last-named fight, he carried off with him the\r\ndivision of Ballasteros, which had been the core of the old Asturian\r\nArmy. General Antonio Arce was left in the principality with some\r\n4,000 men, whom he kept at Colombres, behind the Deba, under General\r\nLlano-Ponte, watching the French force in the province of Santander.\r\nNew levies, little more than 2,000 strong, were being collected\r\nat Oviedo. In the end of January General Bonnet, whose division\r\nat Santander had received its drafts, and had been strengthened\r\nup to 7,000 men[239], thought himself strong enough to drive in\r\nArce’s weak line and to make a dash at the Asturian capital. On\r\nthe 25th he attacked the lines of Colombres, and carried them with\r\nno difficulty. On the 31st he captured Oviedo, which was evacuated\r\nby the Captain-General Arce and the local Junta without serious\r\nfighting. But that active partisan Juan Porlier at once cut off his\r\ncommunication with Santander, by seizing Infiesto and Gijon. Bonnet\r\nat once evacuated Oviedo, and turned back to clear his rear. Porlier\r\nescaped along the coast to Pravia, and meanwhile the main body of\r\nthe Asturians, under General Barcena, reoccupied the capital. Having\r\ndriven off Porlier, the French general marched westward once more,\r\nbeat Barcena at the bridge of Colleto on February 14, and again made\r\nhimself master of Oviedo. The Asturians rallied behind the Narcea,\r\nwhere they were joined by a brigade of 2,000 men sent to their aid by\r\nMahy, the Captain-General of Galicia.\r\n\r\n  [239] He had 7,094 men with the colours, besides sick and\r\n  detached, by the imperial muster rolls of Jan. 15, 1810.\r\n\r\nThat province, like the Asturias, had been left almost ungarrisoned\r\nby Del Parque, when he took the old ‘Army of Galicia’ across the\r\nSierra de Gata, and transferred it to Estremadura. Mahy had been left\r\nbehind with the skeleton of one division, which he was to recruit, as\r\nbest he could, by new levies. His main preoccupation at this moment\r\nwas the defence of the newly fortified stronghold of Astorga, which\r\nwas already threatened by the French troops in the plains of Leon.\r\nBut seeing his flank menaced by Bonnet’s advance, he lent what men he\r\ncould spare to aid in the defence of the Asturias.\r\n\r\nThe Asturian junta, having deposed General Arce for incapacity\r\nand corruption, and appointed Cienfuegos to take over his troops,\r\nordered the resumption of offensive operations against Bonnet in\r\nMarch. Porlier, their great partisan-hero, made a circuit along the\r\ncoast, and threatened the French communications with Santander.\r\nAt the same time their main force advanced against Oviedo by the\r\nvalley of the Nalon. Bonnet’s advanced brigade was driven in, after\r\na sharp skirmish at Grado on March 19, and disquieted by Porlier’s\r\nsimultaneous attack on his rear, he evacuated the Asturian capital\r\nfor the _third_ time, and gave back as far as Cangas de Onis, in the\r\nvalley of the Ona. He then called up all the reinforcements that\r\nhe could obtain from Santander, and marched--for the fourth time\r\nin three months!--on Oviedo with his whole division; the Spaniards\r\nretired without offering serious opposition, and took up a line\r\nbehind the Narcea [March 29]. This time Bonnet left them no time to\r\nrally, but forced the passage of that river, whereupon the Asturians\r\nascended to Tineo in the mountains, while the Galician succours\r\ngave back to Navia, almost on the edge of their own principality\r\n[April 25-26]. After this, Bonnet’s offensive force was spent;\r\nhaving to occupy Oviedo and its ports of Gijon and Aviles, as well\r\nas all the central and eastern Asturias, and, moreover, to defend\r\nhis communication with Santander from new attacks of Porlier, his\r\nstrength sufficed for no more. His 7,000 men were immobilized for\r\nthe rest of the year: he had conquered two-thirds of the Asturias,\r\nand barely succeeded in keeping it down. But he was quite unable to\r\nspare a man to aid in French operations in the plains of Leon, or\r\neven to make a serious attempt to threaten Galicia. Once or twice he\r\nsucceeded in communicating with the forces which Junot (and after him\r\nKellermann and Serras) commanded in the plains beyond the Cantabrian\r\nrange, by expeditions pushed down through the pass of Pajares on\r\nto Leon; but the road was always closed again by the guerrillas,\r\nand no co-operation could take place. In short, the Spaniards lost\r\nthe greater part of the Asturias, and the French lost the further\r\nservices of Bonnet’s division[240]. It had no power to threaten\r\nGalicia, because it was forced to keep garrisons in Gijon, Aviles,\r\nLastres, Santona, and all the sea-ports, with a full brigade at\r\nOviedo in the centre, to support them. Any concentration of troops,\r\nleading to the evacuation of the smaller garrisons, at once let loose\r\nthe guerrillas from their mountains. Bonnet had but 7,000 men in\r\nall: of these, not more than half could be used for an expedition,\r\nand such a force was too small to have any practical effect on the\r\ngeneral course of events in north-western Spain.\r\n\r\n  [240] I cannot understand Napier’s narrative of this little\r\n  campaign, on pages 352-4 of his vol. ii. It runs as follows,\r\n  and seems to have no relation to the facts detailed by Belmas,\r\n  Toreno, Arteche, or any other historian. No mention is made of\r\n  the four captures of Oviedo!\r\n\r\n  ‘Mahy was organizing a second army at Lugo and in the Asturias.\r\n  D’Arco [Arce] commanded 7,000 men, 3,000 of whom were posted at\r\n  Cornellana under General Ponte.... Bonnet, from the Asturias,\r\n  threatened Galicia by the Concija d’Ibas: having destroyed\r\n  Ponte’s force at Potes de la Sierra [30 miles from Colombres,\r\n  where the actual fight took place], he menaced Galicia by the\r\n  pass of Nava de Suarna [a place which his vanguard did not\r\n  approach by a matter of 40 miles].... But he did not pass Nava\r\n  de Suarna, and General D’Arco rallied the Asturian fugitives at\r\n  Louarca. It seems probable that while Bonnet drew the attention\r\n  of the Galician army towards Lugo [he was never within 100 miles\r\n  of that place], Junot thought to penetrate by Puebla Senabria.\r\n  But finally Junot, drawing a reinforcement from Bonnet, invested\r\n  Astorga with 10,000 infantry,’ &c. [No troops from Bonnet’s force\r\n  ever appeared before Astorga.]\r\n\r\nThis last blunder is apparently borrowed from _Victoires et\r\nConquêtes_, xx. 12, which states that General Bonnet detached\r\nJeannin’s brigade, the 46th and 65th, to Astorga. But these regiments\r\ndid not belong to Bonnet, but were, from the first to the last,\r\nparts of Junot’s own corps, and never entered the Asturias. Compare\r\nNapoleon, _Correspondance_, xx. 21, the muster rolls of Jan. 1, Feb.\r\n15, and Belmas, iii. p. 46.\r\n\r\nBonnet’s operations were, of course, wholly subsidiary; the really\r\nimportant movements that were on foot in the early spring of 1810\r\nwere those of Junot and Ney in the plains of Leon. In pursuance\r\nof the Emperor’s orders to the effect that the whole plain-land\r\nof Leon was to be occupied, as a preliminary to the invasion of\r\nPortugal, Loison, who had re-entered Spain at the head of a number\r\nof battalions which were ultimately to join the corps of Ney, was\r\nordered to move on from Valladolid and occupy the country about\r\nBenavente and Astorga. He was left free to select either of those\r\ntowns as his head quarters, and was directed to communicate with\r\nBonnet, when the latter should have entered the Asturias, so that\r\ntheir operations should threaten Galicia simultaneously[241].\r\nLoison’s expedition, however, proved a complete failure; he marched\r\ntowards Astorga early in February with nearly 10,000 men. On the\r\n11th he appeared before that town, and learnt that since Carrié’s\r\nreconnaissance in October 1809[242], it had been much strengthened.\r\nLa Romana had repaired the breaches of its mediaeval walls. He had\r\nthrown up entrenchments round the suburb of La Reteibia, which\r\noccupies that part of the hill of Astorga, which is not covered\r\nby the town itself. He had also established outlying posts in the\r\nsuburbs of San Andrés and Puerta del Rey, which lie at the foot of\r\nthe hill, on its northern and eastern sides. Fourteen guns, only two\r\nof them 12-pounders, the rest light, had been mounted on the walls.\r\nThe place, therefore, was a make-shift fortification of the most\r\nantiquated style. General Garcia Velasco, who had been left behind in\r\nGalicia with one division of the old Northern army when Del Parque\r\nmarched for Estremadura, was in charge of this portion of the Spanish\r\nfront, under the superintendence of Mahy, the Captain-General. He had\r\nplaced half his troops--five battalions, or 2,700 men, in Astorga,\r\nwhile he himself with the remainder lay beyond the mountains, at\r\nVillafranca, in the Vierzo, with about the same force. The total of\r\norganized troops in Galicia at this moment did not exceed 8,000 men,\r\nincluding the small brigade which Mahy sent to the Asturias, and a\r\ndetachment under Echevarria at Puebla de Senabria. Astorga had not\r\nbeen expecting a siege at such an early date as February 11; it was\r\nonly provisioned for twenty days, and the guns had not ammunition\r\nto last for even that short space of time. The governor, José\r\nSantocildes, was a man of courage and resource, who knew how to put\r\non a bold face to an impossible situation, or instant disaster might\r\nhave followed.\r\n\r\n  [241] Napoleon to Berthier, Jan. 11, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [242] See p. 76.\r\n\r\nLoison was disconcerted to find that Astorga, his destined head\r\nquarters, was held and garrisoned against him. His engineers\r\nreconnoitred its walls, and informed him that it could not be taken\r\nwithout a regular battering-train. He had only field-pieces with him,\r\nthe weather was abominable, and his troops--all conscript battalions\r\nfrom France--were suffering terribly from the continued rain and\r\ncold. Wherefore he contented himself with inviting Santocildes to\r\nsurrender, promising him promotion at King Joseph’s hands, if he\r\n‘would implore the clemency of a sovereign who treats all Spaniards\r\nlike a father[243].’ When the governor sent a curt reply, intimating\r\nthat he and his people intended to do their duty, Loison retired to\r\nLa Baneza, and reported to his chiefs that he was helpless for want\r\nof siege-guns. He announced at the same time that he had attempted\r\nto communicate with Bonnet at Oviedo, by sending two battalions to\r\nthe foot of the pass of Pajares, but that the mountain roads were all\r\nblocked with snow, and that this detachment had been forced to fall\r\nback into the plains, without obtaining any news of what was afoot in\r\nthe Asturias[244].\r\n\r\nA few days later, the head of Junot’s corps entered the province\r\nof Leon, and Loison was directed to move southward and join Ney\r\nat Salamanca. His place on the Esla and the Orbigo was taken by\r\nClausel’s division of the 8th Corps. The newly arrived general\r\nexecuted another reconnaissance to the neighbourhood of Astorga, and\r\non February 26 sent Santocildes a second summons, in the name of\r\nJunot. It received the same answer that had been given to Loison.\r\nIt was clear that Astorga must be besieged, and that a battering\r\ntrain must be placed at the disposition of the force charged with\r\nthe operation. But in the present state of the roads it would take\r\nsome time to bring heavy guns to the front. Further operations had\r\nto be postponed. The 6th Corps, it may be remarked, had executed\r\nat the same time that Loison appeared in front of Astorga, a\r\ndemonstration against Ciudad Rodrigo. King Joseph had written from\r\nAndalusia to beg Ney to threaten the place, while the news of the\r\nFrench victories in the south were still fresh, assuring him that\r\nthe Spaniards were so cowed that a prompt surrender was probable.\r\nThe Marshal, though doubting the wisdom of these optimistic views,\r\nconcentrated his corps, advanced to San Felices, and on February\r\n13 summoned Rodrigo. He got from General Herrasti, the governor,\r\nan answer as bold and confident as that which Loison received from\r\nSantocildes, and returned to Salamanca to disperse his troops in\r\ncantonments and ask for a battering-train[245]. His short and\r\nineffective excursion to the banks of the Agueda had taken him in\r\nsight of the British outposts on the Spanish frontier, and had\r\ninduced Wellington for a moment to think that the invasion of\r\nPortugal was at hand. It was impossible that he should have guessed\r\nthat Ney’s advance had no better cause than King Joseph’s foolish\r\nconfidence. Hence the withdrawal of the 6th Corps, after the vain\r\nsummons of Ciudad Rodrigo, was as inexplicable as its advance. ‘I do\r\nnot understand Ney’s movement,’ he wrote to his trusted subordinate,\r\nRobert Craufurd, ‘coupled as it is with the movement upon Badajoz\r\nfrom the south of Spain. The French are not strong enough for the two\r\nsieges at the same time, and I much doubt whether they are in a state\r\nto undertake one of them[246].’ The prompt retirement of Ney from\r\nbefore Ciudad Rodrigo, and of Mortier from before Badajoz, completely\r\njustified his conclusions within a day or two of the writing of his\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n  [243] For the letters of Loison to Santocildes and the reply of\r\n  the Spanish brigadier, see the correspondence in Belmas, iii. pp.\r\n  53-6.\r\n\r\n  [244] Loison to Berthier, Feb. 16, from La Baneza.\r\n\r\n  [245] For notes as to the cause and execution of this abortive\r\n  movement, see the diary of Ney’s aide de camp, Sprünglin, pages\r\n  402-3.\r\n\r\n  [246] Wellington to Craufurd, Feb. 16. Compare similar remarks in\r\n  Wellington to Beresford, from Vizeu, Feb. 21, 1810.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for the French in the kingdom of Leon to do, save\r\nto await the arrival of the great battering-train which Napoleon\r\nhad bestowed upon his Army of Portugal. It was far to the rear: on\r\nFebruary 20 its head was only beginning to approach Burgos, and\r\nits tail had not quitted Bayonne. The reason of this tardiness was\r\nthe want of draught animals at the southern dépôts of France. The\r\nequipment of the train and the artillery of the 8th Corps, and the\r\nother great reinforcements which had just passed the Pyrenees,\r\nhad exhausted the available supplies of horses[247], and when the\r\nauthorities at Bayonne had to place the ‘grand park’ on a war footing\r\nthere was intolerable delay. Even when detachments of the park had\r\nstarted, they made slow progress in Spain, for the French horses died\r\noff rapidly in the bitter weather of the plateau of Old Castile, and\r\nit was almost impossible to replace them by requisition from the\r\ncountry-side. Junot, bold to the verge of rashness, and feverishly\r\nanxious to remake the reputation that he had lost at Vimiero, could\r\nnot endure the delay. He sent to requisition Spanish guns from the\r\ngovernors of Burgos and Segovia, dispatched his own teams to draw\r\nthem, and when he heard that a small train was procurable, ordered\r\nthe 8th Corps towards Astorga on March 15, leaving the cannon to\r\nfollow. The month’s delay in the investment had enabled Santocildes\r\nto fill up the supply of food and ammunition which had been so low\r\nin February; he had now got his fortress in as good state as was\r\npossible, considering the intrinsic weakness of its mediaeval walls,\r\nand had induced 3,000 of the 4,000 inhabitants to retire to Galicia.\r\n\r\n  [247] Even the 8th Corps had to leave guns behind at Bayonne for\r\n  want of horses, Belmas, ii. 13.\r\n\r\nOn March 21 Clausel’s division invested Astorga, while Solignac’s\r\ncame up to Leon and Benavente in support, and St. Croix’s division of\r\ndragoons took post in advance of La Baneza, to observe the Spanish\r\nforces in southern Galicia and the Portuguese of the Tras-os-Montes.\r\nTill the guns should arrive, there was nothing to be done save to\r\nchoose the point of attack, prepare fascines and gabions, and open\r\nthe first parallel, out of harm’s way from the small artillery of the\r\ngarrison--none of it heavier than a 12-pounder. Valazé, Junot’s chief\r\nengineer, opined that the low-lying suburbs at the foot of the hill\r\nof Astorga might be neglected, and the newly entrenched Reteibia\r\non the high ground masked by a false attack, while the projecting\r\nand unflanked north-west corner of the old walls of the city itself\r\nmight be battered from the slopes below: here, as in all its circuit,\r\nthe place had neither ditch nor glacis: there was simply the stout\r\nmediaeval wall, broken every 30 yards by a small square tower, which\r\nfollowed the sky-line of the plateau.\r\n\r\nThe first three weeks of the siege had an unusual character, since\r\nthe French could build what works they pleased, but could not\r\nseriously batter Astorga with the sixteen field-guns of small calibre\r\nbelonging to the division lying before the walls. The officer in\r\ntemporary command of the artillery, Colonel Noël, contented himself\r\nwith opening fire from various false attacks, from which the guns\r\nwere repeatedly moved, in order to distract the attention of the\r\nenemy from the chosen front on the north-west, where the approaches\r\nwere completed, and a great battery constructed, ready for the\r\nsiege-guns when they should arrive. Meanwhile there was a good deal\r\nof infantry skirmishing in and about the lower suburbs, in whose\r\noutskirts the French ultimately established themselves, though they\r\nhad no intention of pushing up to the walls either from Puerta del\r\nRey or from San Andrés[248]. The garrison defended itself well,\r\nexecuted several vigorous sorties, and lost no post of importance,\r\nthough the line of resistance in the suburbs was gradually thrust\r\nback. Santocildes received several encouraging messages from his\r\nchief Mahy, who announced that he was bringing up to the pass of\r\nFoncebadon, on the edge of the plain of Astorga, every man that\r\nGalicia could furnish. But even when the Captain-General had brought\r\nhis reserves from Lugo to join Garcia’s division, they had only\r\n5,000 bayonets. To hold them off, Junot sent Clausel’s division to\r\nthe outposts, and replaced it in the trenches by Solignac’s and\r\none brigade of Lagrange’s. Mahy, in face of such an accumulation\r\nof men, was absolutely helpless. Echevarria, with his weak brigade\r\nfrom Puebla de Senabria, had pushed a little forward, to give moral\r\nsupport to Mahy. He was surprised and routed near Alcanizas on April\r\n10, by St. Croix’s dragoons.\r\n\r\n  [248] There are good narratives in the autobiographies of Noël\r\n  and Hulot of the artillery, beside the excellent account in\r\n  Belmas, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIEGE OF ASTORGA]\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the siege-train arrived from Valladolid; it was\r\nsmall[249], but sufficient against an enemy so miserably provided\r\nwith guns as Santocildes. Junot himself came up on the 17th to watch\r\nthe effect of the attack. It was instant and overpowering. When\r\nonce the artillery had been placed in the works prepared for it,\r\nand had begun its fire, the old walls of Astorga began to crumble.\r\nThe light Spanish pieces on the enceinte were overpowered, despite\r\nof the gallant way in which the gunners stuck to their work[250].\r\nBy noon on the 21st of April the north-western angle of the walls\r\nof Astorga had been beaten down, and the fallen stones, there being\r\nno ditch, had accumulated at the foot of the broad breach, so as\r\nto give an easy entrance. Fortunately for the defence, there was\r\na large church just inside the angle: its roof and tower had been\r\nshot down, but the garrison had made themselves strong in the lower\r\nparts of the building, and threw up traverses from it to the wall on\r\neach side of the breach. This gave them a second line of defence,\r\nthough but a weak one, and when Junot sent in a summons in the\r\nafternoon Santocildes refused his offer. At seven the French general\r\nbade 700 men storm the breach; the forlorn hope was composed of\r\nthe voltigeur and grenadier companies of the Irish Legion and the\r\n47th of the Line. The column penetrated to the foot of the breach\r\nwithout much difficulty, though exposed to heavy musketry from the\r\nwalls, and a flanking fire from the suburb of the Reteibia. The\r\nbreach was carried, and, in addition, a house built with its back\r\nto the ramparts just inside the enceinte. But the assailants could\r\nget no further, owing to the murderous fire which the Spaniards kept\r\nup from behind the ruined church and the traverses. After an hour\r\nof desperate attempts to break in, they took shelter, some in the\r\nhouse that they had captured, but the majority behind the lip of the\r\nbreach, where they covered themselves as best they could, by piles of\r\ndébris built in with their haversacks, and even with the corpses of\r\nthe fallen. Under this poor shelter they lay till dark, suffering\r\nheavily. During the night the troops in the trenches ran out a line\r\nof gabions from the front works to the foot of the walls, and by dawn\r\nhad opened a good communication with the men at the breach, though\r\nthey had to work under a furious but blind fire from above.\r\n\r\n  [249] Only consisting of four 24-pounders, one 16-pounder, four\r\n  12-pounders, eight 6-inch howitzers, and one 6-inch mortar. See\r\n  Belmas, iii. 28.\r\n\r\n  [250] ‘Les Espagnols rispostèrent avec vivacité; on s’étonnait\r\n  d’autant plus que, le parapet étant en pierres sèches, chaque\r\n  boulet qui le frappait en faisait jaillir de nombreux éclats.’\r\n  Belmas, iii. 34.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on April 22, Santocildes surrendered. He might have held out\r\nsome hours longer behind his inner defences, if he had not exhausted\r\nnearly all his musket ammunition in resisting the storm. There\r\nwere less than thirty cartridges a head left for the infantry of\r\nthe garrison, and only 500 pounds of powder for the artillery. The\r\ndefence had been admirable, and, it may be added, very scientific,\r\na fact proved by the low figures of the dead and wounded, which did\r\nnot amount to 200 men[251]. The French, in the assault alone, lost\r\nfive officers and 107 men killed, and eight officers and 286 men\r\nwounded[252]. Junot was thought to have been precipitate in ordering\r\nthe storm: his excuse was that there were less than two hours of\r\ndaylight left, and that, if he had deferred the attack till next\r\nmorning, the Spaniards would have retrenched the breach under cover\r\nof the dark, and made it impracticable. The siege cost the 8th Corps\r\nin all 160 killed and some 400 wounded, a heavy butcher’s bill for\r\nthe capture of a mediaeval fortress armed with only fourteen light\r\nguns. Two thousand five hundred prisoners were taken, as shown by\r\nSantocildes’ lists, but Junot claimed to have ‘captured 3,500 fine\r\ntroops, all with good English muskets, and well clothed in English\r\ngreat coats,’ as well as 500 sick and wounded--impossible figures.\r\n\r\n  [251] Two officers and forty-nine men killed, ten officers and\r\n  ninety-nine men wounded, according to his official report to the\r\n  Junta, in which all details are duly given.\r\n\r\n  [252] See the figures in Junot’s dispatch, given on pages 66-7 of\r\n  Belmas, vol. iii.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the surrender Mahy made a feeble demonstration\r\nagainst the covering troops, on both the passes of Manzanal and\r\nFoncebadon, while Echevarria beat up the force at Penilla which lay\r\nfacing him. All three attacks were checked with ease, the Galician\r\narmy not being able to put more than 6,000 men in the field on the\r\nthree fronts taken together. Its loss was heavy, especially at\r\nPenilla.\r\n\r\nAfter detaching the 22nd Regiment, which was ordered to endeavour\r\nto communicate with Bonnet in the Asturias, and garrisoning Astorga\r\nwith two battalions, Junot drew back the greater part of his corps\r\nto Valladolid and Toro. He had been ordered to place himself near\r\nNey, in order to aid and cover the 6th Corps in the oncoming siege of\r\nCiudad Rodrigo. At the same time he received the unwelcome news that\r\nMasséna had been named Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Portugal,\r\nand that the 8th Corps was placed under his orders.\r\n\r\nMasséna, as has been already mentioned, did not arrive at Salamanca\r\ntill May 28th: he could not well have reached the front earlier,\r\nsince the Emperor had only placed him in command in April. The long\r\ndelay in the opening of the main campaign must, therefore, be laid\r\nto Napoleon’s account rather than to that of his generals. If he had\r\nsuspected that every day of waiting meant that Wellington had added\r\nan extra redoubt to the ever-growing lines of Torres Vedras, it is\r\npermissible to believe that he would have hurried forward matters at\r\na less leisurely pace. But his determination to conduct the invasion\r\nof Portugal in what he called ‘a methodical fashion’ is sufficiently\r\nshown by the orders sent to Salamanca on May 29. ‘Tell the Prince\r\nof Essling that, according to our English intelligence, the army of\r\nGeneral Wellington is composed of no more than 24,000 British and\r\nGermans, and that his Portuguese are only 25,000 strong. I do not\r\nwish to enter Lisbon at this moment, because I could not feed the\r\ncity, whose immense population is accustomed to live on sea-borne\r\nfood. He can spend the summer months in taking Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nthen Almeida. He need not hurry, but can go methodically to work. The\r\nEnglish general, having less than 3,000 cavalry, may offer battle on\r\nground where cavalry cannot act, but will never come out to fight in\r\nthe plains[253].’\r\n\r\n  [253] Napoleon to Berthier, May 29, 1810.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then proceeds to add that with the 50,000 men of the 6th\r\nand 8th Corps, the cavalry reserve, &c., Masséna is strong enough to\r\ntake both Rodrigo and Almeida at his ease: Reynier and the 2nd Corps\r\ncan be called up to the bridge of Alcantara, from whence they can\r\nmenace Central Portugal and cover Madrid. No order is given to bring\r\nup this corps to join the main army: it seems that the Emperor at\r\nthis moment had in his head the plan, with which Wellington always\r\ncredited him, of threatening a secondary attack in the Tagus valley.\r\nThe 2nd Corps is treated as covering Masséna’s left, while on his\r\nright he will be flanked by Kellermann, who is to add to the small\r\nforce already under his command in Old Castile a whole new division,\r\nthat of Serras, composed of troops just arrived from France[254].\r\nThis, added to Kellermann’s dragoons, would make a corps of 12,000\r\nmen. In addition, as the Emperor remarks, by the time that the\r\nArmy of Portugal is ready to march on Lisbon, it will have in its\r\nrear the 9th Corps under Drouet, nearly 20,000 men, who will be\r\nconcentrated at Valladolid before the autumn has begun. There will\r\nbe over 30,000 men in Leon and Old Castile when Masséna’s army moves\r\non from Almeida, and in the rear of these again Burgos, Navarre,\r\nand Biscay will be held by the Young Guard, and by twenty-six 4th\r\nbattalions from France, which were due to start after the 9th Corps,\r\nand would have made their appearance south of the Pyrenees by August\r\nor September.\r\n\r\n  [254] Serras’ division consisted of the 113th Line, a Tuscan\r\n  regiment originally employed in Catalonia, which had been so cut\r\n  up in 1809 that it had been sent back to refill its cadres; also\r\n  of the 4th of the Vistula (two battalions), a Polish regiment\r\n  raised in 1810, with four provisional battalions, and three stray\r\n  battalions belonging to regiments in the South, which had not\r\n  been allowed to go on to join Soult [4th battalions of the 32nd\r\n  and 58th Line and of 12th Léger]: his total strength was 8,000\r\n  men.\r\n\r\nThis document is a very curious product of the imperial pen.\r\nIt would be hard to find in the rest of the _Correspondance_ a\r\ndispatch which so completely abandons the ‘Napoleonic methods’ of\r\nquick concentration and sharp strokes, and orders a delay of three\r\nmonths or more in the completion of a campaign whose preliminary\r\noperations had begun so far back as February. We may reject at\r\nonce the explanation offered by some of Napoleon’s enemies, to the\r\neffect that he was jealous of Masséna, and did not wish him to\r\nachieve too rapid or too brilliant a success. But it is clear that a\r\nhumanitarian regard for the possible sufferings of the inhabitants\r\nof Lisbon--the only reason alleged for the delay--is an inadequate\r\nmotive. Such things did not normally affect the Emperor, and he must\r\nhave remembered that when Junot occupied Portugal at the mid-winter\r\nof 1807-8 famine had not played its part in the difficulties\r\nencountered by the French. Nor does it seem that an exaggerated\r\nestimate of the enemy’s strength induced him to postpone the\r\nattack till all the reinforcements had arrived. He under-estimates\r\nWellington’s British troops by some 5,000, his Portuguese troops by\r\nat least 15,000 men. He is utterly ignorant of the works of Torres\r\nVedras, though six months’ labour has already been lavished on them,\r\nand by this time they were already defensible. Three months seem\r\nan altogether exaggerated time to devote to the sieges of the two\r\nlittle old-fashioned second-rate fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and\r\nAlmeida. From whence, then, comes this unprecedented resolve to adopt\r\na ‘methodical’ system in dealing with the invasion of Portugal? It\r\nhas been suggested that the Emperor was very desirous to make sure\r\nof the absolute suppression of the guerrilleros of the Pyrenees and\r\nthe Ebro, before pushing forward his field army to Lisbon. Possibly\r\nhe was influenced by his knowledge of the infinite difficulty that\r\nMasséna would find in equipping himself with a train, and more\r\nespecially in creating magazines during the months before the harvest\r\nhad been gathered in. Some have thought that, looking far forward,\r\nhe considered it would be more disastrous to the English army to be\r\n‘driven into the sea’ somewhere in the rough months of October and\r\nNovember rather than in the fine weather of June--and undoubtedly\r\nno one who reads his dispatches can doubt that the desire to deal\r\nan absolutely crushing blow to that army was his dominating idea\r\nthroughout. But probably the main determining factor in Napoleon’s\r\nmind was the resolve that there should be no failure this time, for\r\nwant of preparation or want of sufficient strength; that no risks\r\nshould be taken, and that what he regarded as an overwhelming force\r\nshould be launched upon Portugal. After Junot’s disaster of 1808\r\nand Soult’s fiasco in 1809, the Imperial prestige could not stand\r\na third failure. The old pledge that ‘the leopard should be driven\r\ninto the sea’ must be redeemed at all costs on this occasion. Solid\r\nsuccess rather than a brilliant campaign must be the end kept in\r\nview: hence came the elaborate preparations for the sustaining of\r\nMasséna’s advance by the support of Drouet, Kellermann, and Serras.\r\nEven Suchet’s operations in Eastern Spain were to be conducted\r\nwith some regard to the affairs of Portugal[255]. It was a broad\r\nand a formidable plan--but it failed in one all-important factor.\r\nWellington’s strength was underrated; it was no mere driving of\r\n25,000 British troops into the sea that was now in question, but\r\nthe reduction of a kingdom where every man had been placed under\r\narms, and every preparation made for passive as well as for active\r\nresistance. When Napoleon was once more foiled, it was because he\r\nhad treated the Portuguese army--a ‘_tas de coquins_’ as he called\r\nthem--as a negligible quantity, and because he had foreseen neither\r\nthat systematic devastation of the land, nor the creation of those\r\nvast lines in front of Lisbon, which were such essential features of\r\nWellington’s scheme of defence. The French attack was delivered by\r\n65,000 men, not by the 100,000 whose advent the British general had\r\nfeared: and precisely because the numbers of the Army of Portugal\r\nwere no greater, the attack was made on the Beira frontier only.\r\nMasséna had no men to spare for the secondary invasion south of the\r\nTagus which Wellington had expected and dreaded. The Emperor’s plans\r\nwent to wreck because he had under-estimated his enemy, and assigned\r\ntoo small a force to his lieutenant. But it was no ordinary general\r\nwho had so prepared his defence that Napoleon’s calculations went all\r\nastray. The genius of Wellington was the true cause of the disastrous\r\nend of the long-prepared invasion.\r\n\r\n  [255] See the curious dispatch no. 16651, of July 14, directing\r\n  Suchet to be ready to send half his corps to Valladolid after he\r\n  should have taken Tortosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MONTHS OF WAITING: THE SIEGE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO (MAY-JULY 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long months of delay that followed the first operations of the\r\nFrench in 1810 were a time of anxious waiting for Wellington. He had\r\nmoved his head quarters to Vizeu on the 12th of January, and had\r\nbeen lying in that bleak and lofty town all through the rest of the\r\nwinter. With him there had come to the North all the old British\r\ndivisions save the 2nd, which had been left with Hill, first at\r\nAbrantes and then at Portalegre, to watch the French between the\r\nTagus and the Guadiana. The 1st Division was placed at Vizeu, the 3rd\r\nat Trancoso and the neighbouring villages, the 4th at Guarda, while\r\nthe cavalry wintered in the coast plain between Coimbra and Aveiro.\r\nOnly the Light Brigade of Robert Craufurd, which takes the new\r\nstyle of the Light _Division_ on March 1, was pushed forward to the\r\nSpanish frontier, and lay in the villages about Almeida[256], with\r\nits outposts pushed forward to the line of the Agueda. The Portuguese\r\nregular brigades, which were afterwards incorporated in the British\r\ndivisions, were still lying in winter quarters around Coimbra and\r\nThomar, drilling hard and incorporating their recruits. The militia\r\nwere also under arms at their regimental head quarters, save the\r\nfew battalions which had already been thrown into Elvas, Almeida,\r\nPeniche, and Abrantes.\r\n\r\n  [256] The head quarters of the 43rd during January and February\r\n  were at Valverde, above the Coa, those of the 52nd at Pinhel,\r\n  those of the 95th at Villa Torpim.\r\n\r\nWellington’s front, facing the French, was formed by Hill’s corps\r\nin the Alemtejo, Lecor’s Portuguese brigade in the Castello Branco\r\ndistrict, and Craufurd’s force on the Agueda. Neither Hill nor\r\nLecor was in actual contact with the enemy, and La Romana’s army,\r\nspread out from the Pass of Perales to Zafra and Araçena in a thin\r\nline, lay between them and Reynier’s and Mortier’s outposts. It was\r\notherwise with Craufurd, who was placed north of La Romana’s left\r\ndivision, that of Martin Carrera; he was in close touch with Ney’s\r\ncorps all along the line of the Agueda, as far as the Douro. Since\r\nthe outposts of the 6th Corps had been pushed forward on March 9th,\r\nthe Commander of the Light Division was in a most responsible, not\r\nto say a dangerous, position. The main army was forty miles to his\r\nrear in its cantonments at Vizeu, Guarda, and Trancoso. He had with\r\nhim of British infantry only the first battalions of the 43rd,\r\n52nd, and 95th, with one battery, and one regiment of cavalry, the\r\n1st Hussars of the King’s German Legion. His orders were to keep\r\nopen the communication with Ciudad Rodrigo till the last possible\r\nmoment, to cover Almeida as long as was prudent, and to keep the\r\nCommander-in-Chief advised of every movement of the enemy. It was\r\nclear that he might be thrust back at any moment: the 6th Corps,\r\nsince Loison had joined it, was 30,000 strong: the Light Division had\r\nonly 2,500 infantry with the 500 German light horse. On March 28th\r\nWellington sent up to reinforce Craufurd two battalions of Caçadores,\r\nthe 1st and 2nd. The latter of these units was afterwards changed for\r\nthe 3rd[257], which, trained by Elder, the best of all the colonels\r\nlent to the Portuguese army, was reckoned the most efficient corps\r\nthat could be selected from Beresford’s command. But the two Caçador\r\nbattalions only added 1,000 bayonets to the Light Division, and even\r\nafter their arrival Craufurd’s force was less than 4,000 strong.\r\n\r\n  [257] On Craufurd’s complaint that the 2nd Caçadores were badly\r\n  commanded and too full of boys. He repeatedly asked for, and\r\n  ultimately obtained, the 3rd battalion in place of the 2nd,\r\n  because of his confidence in Elder.\r\n\r\nRobert Craufurd, though only a brigadier, and junior of his rank,\r\nhad been chosen by Wellington to take charge of his outpost line\r\nbecause he was one of the very few officers then in the Peninsula in\r\nwhose ability his Commander-in-Chief had perfect confidence. Nothing\r\nis more striking than to compare the tone and character of the\r\nletters which Wellington wrote to him with those which he dispatched\r\nto most of his other general officers. Only with Craufurd, Hill,\r\nand Beresford, did he ever condescend to enter into explanations\r\nand state reasons. The rest receive orders without comment, which\r\nthey are directed to carry out, and are given no opportunity to\r\ndiscuss[258]. The difference was noted and resented by the others:\r\nwhen on March 8th Craufurd was formally given charge of the whole\r\noutpost line of the army, and his seniors Picton and Cole were\r\ntold to conform their movements to his, without waiting for orders\r\nfrom head quarters, some friction was engendered[259]. Picton and\r\nCraufurd, in especial, were for the rest of the campaign in a state\r\nof latent hostility, which more than once led to high words when they\r\nmet--a fact which was not without its dangers to the welfare of the\r\narmy[260].\r\n\r\n  [258] Note especially Wellington’s explanatory dispatch to\r\n  Craufurd of March 8, where he even goes so far as to give his\r\n  subordinate a free hand as to the choice of his line: ‘You must\r\n  be a better judge of the details of this question than I can be,\r\n  and I wish you to consider them, in order to be able to carry\r\n  the plan into execution when I shall send it to you.’ In another\r\n  letter Wellington writes: ‘Nothing can be of greater advantage to\r\n  me than to have the benefit of your opinion on _any_ subject.’\r\n\r\n  [259] ‘I intend that the divisions of Generals Cole and Picton\r\n  should support you on the Coa, without waiting for orders from\r\n  me, if it should be necessary, and they shall be directed\r\n  accordingly.’ 8th March, from Vizeu.\r\n\r\n  [260] It should not be forgotten that Picton, no less than\r\n  Craufurd, was at this time living down an old disaster. But\r\n  Picton’s misfortune had not been military. It was the celebrated\r\n  case of _Rex_ v. _Picton_. He had been tried for permitting\r\n  the use of torture to extract evidence against criminals\r\n  while governor of the newly conquered island of Trinidad, and\r\n  convicted, though Spanish law (which was still in force in\r\n  Trinidad) apparently permitted of the practice. After this Picton\r\n  was a marked man. The story of Luisa Calderon, the quadroon\r\n  girl who had been tortured by ‘picketing,’ had been appearing\r\n  intermittently in the columns of every Whig paper for more than\r\n  three years.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated commander of the Light Division was at this time well\r\nknown for his ability, but reckoned rather an unlucky soldier. He had\r\nentered the army so far back as 1779, and had seen service in every\r\nquarter of the globe, yet in 1809 was only a colonel. This was the\r\nmore astounding since he was one of the few scientific soldiers in\r\nthe British army when the Revolutionary War broke out. He had spent\r\nsome time at Berlin in 1782, studying the tactics of the army of\r\nFrederick the Great, and had translated into English the official\r\nPrussian treatise on the Art of War. His knowledge of German, a rare\r\naccomplishment in the British army at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, caused him to be given the post of military attaché at\r\nCoburg’s head quarters in 1794, and he followed the Austrian army\r\nthrough all the disasters of that and the two following years. Again\r\nin 1799 he went out to take the same post at the head quarters of\r\nthe army of Switzerland, but quitted it to serve on the staff of the\r\nDuke of York, during the miserable Dutch expedition of that same\r\nyear. He seemed destined to witness nothing but disasters, and though\r\nhe was known to have done his duty with admirable zeal and energy\r\nin every post that he occupied, promotion lingered. Probably his\r\ncaustic tongue and fiery temper were his hindrances, but it seems\r\nastonishing that he took twenty-six years to attain the rank of\r\ncolonel, though he was not destitute of political influence, having\r\nfriends and relatives in Parliament, and even in the Ministry[261].\r\nIn 1801 he was a disappointed man, thought of retiring from the\r\narmy, and, having accepted a nomination borough, sat in the Commons\r\nfor five years. In 1805 he was at last made a colonel, and in the\r\nfollowing year went on active service with the expedition which,\r\nsent originally to the Cape, was distracted in 1807 to the unhappy\r\nBuenos Ayres campaign. This was the zenith of his misfortunes; it\r\nwas he who, placed in charge of a light brigade by the incapable\r\nWhitelocke, was thrust forward into the midst of the tangled streets\r\nof Buenos Ayres, surrounded in the convent of San Domingo, and forced\r\nto capitulate for lack of support. At the ensuing court-martial he\r\nwas acquitted of all blame, but the fact that he had surrendered a\r\nBritish brigade rankled in his mind for the rest of his life. The\r\nunshaken confidence in his abilities felt by the Home authorities was\r\nmarked by the fact that he was sent out in October 1808 with Baird’s\r\ncorps, which landed at Corunna, and again in June 1809 to Lisbon,\r\neach time in command of a brigade. But his bad luck seemed still\r\nto attend him: he missed the victory of Corunna because Moore had\r\ndetached his brigade on the inexplicable march to Vigo. He failed to\r\nbe present at Talavera, despite of the famous forced march which he\r\nmade towards the sound of the cannon.\r\n\r\n  [261] His elder brother, Sir Charles Craufurd, was\r\n  Deputy-Adjutant-General, and M.P. for Retford. Windham, the\r\n  Secretary for War, was his devoted friend.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Craufurd was burning to vindicate his reputation, and to\r\nshow that the confidence which Wellington placed in him was not\r\nundeserved. He still regarded himself as a man who had been unjustly\r\ndealt with, and had never been given his chance. He could not forget\r\nthat he was four years older than Beresford, five years older than\r\nWellington, eight years older than Hill, yet was but a junior\r\nbrigadier-general in charge of a division[262]. He was full of a\r\nconsuming energy, on the look-out for slights and quarrels, a very\r\nstrict disciplinarian, restless himself and leaving his troops no\r\nrest. He was not liked by all his officers: in the Light Division\r\nhe had many admirers[263] and many bitter critics. Nor was he at\r\nfirst popular with the rank and file, though they soon began to\r\nrecognize the keen intelligence that guided his actions, and to see\r\nthat he was a just if a hard master[264]. In the matter of feeding\r\nhis troops, the most difficult task imposed on a general of the\r\nPeninsular army, he had an unparalleled reputation for accomplishing\r\nthe impossible--even if the most drastic methods had to be employed.\r\nThe famous old story about Wellington and the commissary had Craufurd\r\n(and not, as it is sometimes told, Picton) as its hero. As a sample\r\nof his high-handed ways, it may be mentioned that he once seized\r\nand impounded some church-plate till the villages to which it\r\nbelonged found him some corn for his starving division. Craufurd, on\r\none of his happy days, and they were many, was the most brilliant\r\nsubordinate that Wellington ever owned. His mistakes--and he\r\ncommitted more than one--were the faults of an ardent and ambitious\r\nspirit taking an immoderate risk in the hour of excitement.\r\n\r\n  [262] Though senior in the date of his first commission to nearly\r\n  all the officers of the Peninsular army, Craufurd was six years\r\n  junior to Picton, and one year junior to Hope. Graham, much his\r\n  senior in age, had only entered the army in 1793.\r\n\r\n  [263] Such as Shaw-Kennedy, William Campbell, Kincaid, and Lord\r\n  Seaton.\r\n\r\n  [264] For Craufurd’s life and personality see his biography by\r\n  his grandson the Rev. Alex. Craufurd, London, 1890. The most\r\n  vivid picture of him is in Rifleman Harris’s chronicle of the\r\n  Corunna retreat, a wonderful piece of narrative by a writer from\r\n  the ranks, who admired his general despite of all his severity,\r\n  and acknowledges that his methods were necessary. Though Napier\r\n  as a historian is on the whole fairly just to his old commander,\r\n  whose achievements were bound up indissolubly with the glories of\r\n  the Light Division, as a man he disliked Craufurd: in one of his\r\n  hooks which I possess (Delagrave’s _Campagne de Portugal_) he has\r\n  written in the margin several bitter personal remarks about him,\r\n  very unlike the language employed in his history. The unpublished\r\n  Journal of Colonel McLeod of the 43rd is (as Mr. Alex. Craufurd\r\n  informs me) written in the same spirit. So is Charles Napier’s\r\n  _Diary_.\r\n\r\nFrom March to July 1810 Craufurd, in charge of the whole outpost\r\nsystem of Wellington’s army, accomplished the extraordinary feat of\r\nguarding a front of forty miles against an active enemy of sixfold\r\nforce, without suffering his line to be pierced, or allowing the\r\nFrench to gain any information whatever of the dispositions of\r\nthe host in his rear. He was in constant and daily touch with\r\nNey’s corps, yet was never surprised, and never thrust back save\r\nby absolutely overwhelming strength; he never lost a detachment,\r\nnever failed to detect every move of the enemy, and never sent\r\nhis commander false intelligence. This was the result of system\r\nand science, not merely of vigilance and activity. The journal of\r\nhis aide de camp Shaw-Kennedy, giving the daily work of the Light\r\nDivision during the critical months of 1810, might serve as an\r\nillustrative manual of outpost duty, and was indeed printed for that\r\npurpose in 1851[265].\r\n\r\n  [265] As an Appendix to Lord F. Fitz-Clarence’s _Manual of\r\n  Outpost Duties_.\r\n\r\nCraufurd’s one cavalry regiment, the German Hussars, had to cover\r\na front of nearly forty miles, and performed the duty admirably;\r\nit had been chosen for the service because it was considered by\r\nWellington superior in scouting power to any of his British light\r\ncavalry corps. ‘General Craufurd worked out the most difficult\r\npart of the outpost duty with them. He had the great advantage of\r\nspeaking German fluently, and he arranged for the outpost duties of\r\nthe different parts of the long line that he had to guard by his\r\npersonal communications with the captains of that admirable corps,\r\nmen who were themselves masters of the subject. They each knew his\r\nplan for the space that they covered, though not his general plan,\r\nand each worked out his part most admirably. The General communicated\r\nwith them direct. He had the great advantage of possessing, with\r\nhis great abilities and energy, uncommon bodily strength, so that\r\nhe could remain on horseback almost any length of time.... When\r\nhis operations began, the point to be observed was the line of the\r\nAgueda, extending for some forty miles. The country, although very\r\nirregular in its surface, was quite open and unenclosed, and fit\r\nalmost everywhere for the action of all three arms. When he took up\r\nthe line he kept his infantry back entirely, with the exception of\r\nfour companies of the Rifles above the bridge of Barba del Puerco,\r\nupon the _calculation_ of the time that would be required to retire\r\nthe infantry behind the Coa, after he received information from the\r\ncavalry of the enemy’s advance. If we are properly to understand\r\nCraufurd’s operations, the _calculation_ must never be lost sight\r\nof, for it was on calculations that he acted all along. The\r\nhazarding of the four companies at Barba del Puerco forms a separate\r\nconsideration: it rested on the belief that the pass there was so\r\ndifficult, that four companies could defend it against any numbers,\r\nand that, if they were turned higher up the river, the Hussars would\r\ngive the Rifles warning in ample time for a safe retreat.... Special\r\nreports were made of the state of the fords of the Agueda _every_\r\nmorning, and the rapidity of its rises was particularly marked.\r\nAn officer had special charge of all deserters from the enemy, to\r\nexamine them and bring together their information[266]. Beacons were\r\nprepared on conspicuous heights, so as to communicate information\r\nas to the enemy’s offensive movements. To ensure against mistakes\r\nin the night, pointers were kept at the stations of communication,\r\ndirected to the beacons.... As Napier has remarked in his History,\r\n_seven minutes_ sufficed for the division to get under arms in the\r\nmiddle of the night, and a quarter of an hour, night or day, to bring\r\nit in order of battle to its alarm-posts, with the baggage loaded and\r\nassembled at a convenient distance to the rear. And this not upon a\r\nconcerted signal, nor as a trial, but at all times and certain[267].’\r\n\r\n  [266] One of the most curious points in Shaw-Kennedy’s _Diary_\r\n  [p. 218] is that from the reports of deserters Craufurd succeeded\r\n  in reconstructing the exact composition of Ney’s corps, in\r\n  brigades and battalions, with a final error of only one battalion\r\n  and 2,000 men too few.\r\n\r\n  [267] Shaw-Kennedy, _Diary_, pp. 142 and 147.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture it remains to be added that there were some\r\nfifteen fords between Ciudad Rodrigo and the mouth of the Agueda,\r\nwhich were practicable in dry weather for all arms, and that several\r\nof them could be used even after a day or two of rain. The French\r\nwere along the whole river; they had 3,000 horse available in March\r\nand April, 5,000 in May and June. Their infantry at some points were\r\nonly three or four miles back from the river: yet Craufurd’s line was\r\nnever broken, nor was even a picket of ten men cut off or surrounded.\r\nThe least movement of the enemy was reported along the whole front in\r\nan incredibly short time, the whole web of communication quivered at\r\nthe slightest touch, and the division was immediately ready to fight\r\nor to draw back, according as the strength of the French dictated\r\nboldness or caution.\r\n\r\nDuring February Wellington had rightly concluded that Craufurd had\r\nnothing to fear; Ney’s early demonstration against Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nhad no more serious significance than Mortier’s similar appearance\r\nin front of Badajoz. But when March arrived, and the 8th Corps\r\nappeared in the plains of Leon and commenced the siege of Astorga,\r\nwhile Ney began to move up his cavalry to the line of the Yeltes,\r\nand Loison’s division, coming from Astorga, established itself on\r\nthe lower Agueda, it seemed likely that serious work would soon\r\nbegin. The first test of the efficiency of Craufurd’s outpost system\r\nwas made on the night of March 19-20, when Ferey, commanding the\r\nbrigade of Loison’s division which lay at San Felices, assembled his\r\nsix voltigeur companies before dawn, and made a dash at the pass of\r\nBarba del Puerco. He had the good luck to bayonet the sentries at\r\nthe bridge before they could fire, and was half way up the rough\r\nascent from the bridge to the village, when Beckwith’s detachment\r\nof the 95th Rifles, roused and armed in ten minutes, were upon him.\r\nThey drove him down the defile, and chased him back across the river\r\nwith the loss of two officers and forty-five men killed and wounded.\r\nBeckwith’s riflemen lost one officer and three men killed, and ten\r\nmen wounded in the three companies engaged. After this alarm Craufurd\r\nwas in anxious expectation of a general advance of the 6th Corps, and\r\nmade every preparation to receive them. But Ferey’s reconnaissance\r\nhad no sequel, and a whole month passed by without any serious move\r\non the part of the enemy. The Agueda was in flood for the greater\r\npart of April, owing to incessant rains, which made the outpost work\r\nsimple, as the number of points to be observed went down from fifteen\r\nto three or four. It was not till the twenty-sixth that Maucune’s\r\nand Ferey’s brigades moved up close to Ciudad Rodrigo, drove in the\r\nSpanish outposts, and formed the blockade of the place on the east\r\nside of the Agueda. Even then its bridge remained unmolested, and\r\nCraufurd could communicate quite freely with the garrison, and did\r\nso till June 2nd. Masséna at a later date blamed Ney for having\r\nestablished this partial and useless blockade before he was ready\r\nto commence the siege in earnest. The two French brigades consumed,\r\nduring the month of May, the whole of the local resources of the\r\ndistrict around Rodrigo, so that, when the rest of the army came\r\nup, all supplies had to be brought up from a great distance. It may\r\nalso be remarked that to advance a corps of no more than 7,000 men\r\nwithin striking distance of the British army would have been very\r\nhazardous, if Wellington had been entertaining any designs of taking\r\nthe offensive--and Ney at this time could not have been sure that\r\nsuch a contingency was unlikely. The only advantage which the Marshal\r\ngot from keeping his detachment so close to the fortress was that,\r\nin their month of waiting, the brigades were able to prepare a great\r\nstore of gabions and fascines, and the engineers to make a thorough\r\nsurvey of the environs.\r\n\r\nCiudad Rodrigo stands on a single circular knoll of no great height,\r\nwhose summit it exactly covers. It is a small place of some 8,000\r\nsouls, packed tight in narrow streets within a stout mediaeval wall\r\nthickly set with towers. A fourteenth-century castle, on which the\r\nhouses press in too close for strength, fills its south-eastern\r\ncorner: there is no other inner place of refuge. The Agueda, divided\r\ninto several channels, runs under the southern side of the place; it\r\nis crossed by a bridge completely commanded by the fire of the walls.\r\nOn the water-front the knoll is at its highest, on the opposite face\r\nit is much less steep, and only very slightly exceeds the level of\r\nthe surrounding ground. Round the circuit of the mediaeval wall a\r\nlow modern enceinte had been constructed, and served as an outer\r\nprotection (_fausse-braye_); it was only twelve feet high, so did not\r\nshield more than a third of the inner wall, which could be battered\r\nover its summit. Its outline was zigzagged in the form of redans, and\r\nit was furnished with a dry ditch. Its glacis, owing to the rising of\r\nthe knoll, gave it little protection, so that both the older and the\r\nmodern wall could be searched, for the greater part of their height,\r\nby the artillery of a besieger. Outside the eastern gate of Rodrigo\r\nlies the straggling suburb of San Francisco, on very low ground. It\r\nwas so large and so close to the walls that the governor Herrasti\r\nconsidered it absolutely necessary to take it inside the circuit\r\nof his defences. It had accordingly been surrounded by a strong\r\nearthwork, and the three great monasteries which it contains--San\r\nFrancisco, San Domingo, and Santa Clara--had been strengthened and\r\nloopholed. The small suburb of La Marina, just across the bridge, was\r\nretrenched and manned, as was also the convent of Santa Cruz, which\r\nstands isolated 200 yards outside the north-west angle of the town.\r\nOther outlying buildings had been levelled to the ground, lest they\r\nshould afford cover to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIEGE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO]\r\n\r\nThese preparations were very wise and helpful, but they did not do\r\naway with the main weakness of Ciudad Rodrigo considered as a modern\r\nfortress. Like many other mediaeval strongholds it is commanded\r\nby outlying heights, which could be disregarded as an element of\r\ndanger in the fourteenth or the sixteenth century, because of their\r\ndistance, but became all-important with the improvement of artillery.\r\nIn this case two knolls, considerably higher than that on which the\r\nplace stands, lie outside its northern walls. The smaller, named the\r\nLittle Teson, lies only 200 yards from the northern angle of the\r\ntown; it is some fifty feet higher than the base of the ramparts.\r\nImmediately behind it rises the Great Teson, which dominates the\r\nwhole country-side, its broad flat top, three-quarters of a mile in\r\ndiameter, being a hundred feet above the level of the plain. It was\r\nhopeless to think of holding the little Teson as an outwork, since\r\nthe greater one looks down into it and searches it from end to end.\r\nThe Great Teson, on the other hand, is so large--its circuit is about\r\nthe same as the city itself--that it would be impossible to think\r\nof defending it, as when entrenched it would require a garrison of\r\nat least 3,000 men, and Herrasti had but 5,500 troops under his\r\ncommand. Its slopes, moreover, are gentle, and do not lend themselves\r\nto fortification. The southern edge of the plateau of the Great Teson\r\nbeing only 500 yards from the town wall, it was obvious that here\r\nwas the place from which Rodrigo could best be assailed. Batteries\r\non its sky-line could breach both the inner and outer walls, and\r\ncould command every square foot both of the town and of the fortified\r\nsuburbs. Accordingly the brigades which lay before the place in\r\nMay had encamped on and behind the Teson, and stored the gabions,\r\nfascines, and sandbags which they were making in a park, near the\r\nconvent of La Caridad and the village of Pedro de Toro, on its\r\nfurther side.\r\n\r\nHerrasti, as we have said, had a garrison of 5,500 men, composed of\r\none line battalion, two militia battalions, three battalions of new\r\nlevies from the town and its vicinity, called ‘Voluntarios de Ciudad\r\nRodrigo,’ and one battalion of ‘Urban Guards[268].’ None of these\r\ntroops, save the line battalion of Majorca (which had formed part of\r\nthe old Army of Estremadura) had ever been under fire--a fact which\r\nmakes their fine defence all the more creditable. There were only\r\n11 officers and 37 men of the artillery of the line in the place:\r\nthese had to train 350 men assigned to them from the infantry; but\r\nfortunately the long delay in the opening of the siege had allowed\r\nthe instruction to be thoroughly carried out. Of engineers there were\r\nonly 4 officers and 60 sappers--of cavalry none--but the partisan\r\nchief Julian Sanchez with some 200 of his Lancers chanced to be in\r\nthe place on the day when it was completely invested, and was forced\r\nto cut his way out when the bombardment began. Perhaps the main\r\nstrength of Ciudad Rodrigo, as of Gerona, lay in the personality of\r\nits governor. General Andrés Herrasti, a veteran of nearly seventy\r\nyears, was determined to do his duty, and showed as much ingenuity\r\nand readiness as obstinacy in his defence.\r\n\r\n  [268] Herrasti’s report gives 1st of Majorca 706 officers and\r\n  men, Avila and Segovia militia 857 and 317 respectively, three\r\n  battalions of volunteers of Ciudad Rodrigo 2,242, Urban guard\r\n  750, artillery 375, sappers 60; total, with some details added,\r\n  5,510, not including Sanchez’s Partida. See Belmas, iii. 314.\r\n\r\nThough the French had appeared before the walls of Ciudad Rodrigo\r\non April 26th, it was not till May 30th that Ney came up in person,\r\nwith four brigades of infantry and Montbrun’s division of reserve\r\ncavalry, to complete the investment. The main cause of the delay was,\r\nas usual, the lack of supplies. Ney had to levy and forward from\r\nSalamanca two months’ rations for an army of 30,000 men, and could\r\nonly do so after long and harassing preparation. He nearly came to\r\nactual blows with King Joseph over the matter, for he sent a cavalry\r\nbrigade to raise requisitions in the province of Avila, which was\r\noutside his command, and General Hugo, the King’s governor, put his\r\ntroops under arms and refused to allow the dragoons to enter his\r\ndistrict. An imperial rescript, however, soon arrived, which placed\r\nAvila at the disposition of the 6th Corps, and the royal authorities\r\nhad to yield[269].\r\n\r\n  [269] See Sprünglin’s _Journal_, p. 417.\r\n\r\nAll Ney’s troops were now concentrated for the siege, his outlying\r\ndetachments in every direction having been relieved by Junot, who,\r\nat Masséna’s orders, brought down the 8th Corps from the Douro,\r\nplaced a brigade to watch the Pass of Baños, left garrisons in\r\nZamora and Toro, and advanced with the remainder of his troops to\r\nthe line of the Agueda. Clausel’s division and St. Croix’s division\r\nof dragoons took post at San Felices, in immediate touch with\r\nCraufurd’s division. Solignac’s division lay a march and a half to\r\nthe rear at Ledesma. San Felices is only 20, Ledesma is 40 miles\r\nfrom Ciudad Rodrigo, so that the 8th Corps, deducting the outlying\r\nbrigades, could have joined Ney in two days. These distances were\r\nthe governing factor in Wellington’s policy during the next month.\r\nNey had 26,000 men of the 6th Corps and Montbrun’s 4,000 dragoons in\r\nfront of Rodrigo; Junot could join him with 8,000 infantry and 1,800\r\ncavalry in a day; a second day would bring up Solignac with 7,000\r\nmen more. Unless the 6th Corps could be surprised in its camps, and\r\nforced to fight before it received its reinforcements, there would\r\nbe 47,000 French to face. Of their numbers Wellington was roughly\r\naware; the figures sent in to him by Craufurd were accurate to within\r\na few thousands[270], and estimated the enemy at 40,000 men. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief’s own calculation was even nearer the truth; early\r\nin May he reckoned Ney, with Loison’s division included, at 30,000\r\nmen, Junot and Kellermann at 30,000[271]. Early in June he made out\r\nthat the two corps in his front, without Kellermann, amounted to\r\n50,000 men[272], which was only 3,000 over the true total. He himself\r\nhad at this moment only 18,000 British troops under his hand, and\r\nwithin striking distance. He had on April 27th, brought up his head\r\nquarters and the 1st Division to Celorico, and moved forward Picton\r\nand the 3rd Division to Pinhel, while Cole with the 4th remained at\r\nGuarda, and the Light Division was, as usual, facing the Agueda. The\r\ncavalry had also come up from the Mondego valley, and lay behind\r\nAlmeida. Moreover, the five Portuguese brigades of Harvey, Collins,\r\nPack, Coleman, and Alex. Campbell were ordered up to the front[273],\r\nand joined the army in the first days of May. Wellington thereupon\r\nincorporated Harvey’s brigade with the 3rd Division and Collins’s\r\nwith the 4th, a system which he afterwards carried out with nearly\r\nall the Portuguese units. The whole of this mass of troops came to\r\nsome 15,000 men[274]. These, with the British, making a total of\r\n32,000 men, were all that Wellington could count upon, for he could\r\nnot dare to move Hill’s 12,000 men from the south, where they were\r\nobserving Reynier, nor to displace the small reserve, which lay at\r\nAbrantes and Thomar to guard against a possible French move along the\r\nTagus by Castello Branco. Lisbon could not be left unprotected on\r\nthis side, so long as Reynier lay between the Tagus and the Guadiana.\r\n\r\n  [270] May 2, to Craufurd.\r\n\r\n  [271] On June 1 Craufurd calculated the troops in front of Ciudad\r\n  Rodrigo, by counting regiments and battalions, at over 25,000\r\n  men. There were really 30,000, and the under-estimate came\r\n  from allowing only 550 men to a battalion, while they really\r\n  averaged 650. About the same time Craufurd estimated the parts\r\n  of Junot’s corps in the neighbourhood to be 13,000 men: they\r\n  were really nearly 17,000. The cause of error was the same. See\r\n  Shaw-Kennedy’s _Diary_, pages 190-5. The estimates are corrected,\r\n  on fuller information, early in July, see ibid., p. 220.\r\n\r\n  [272] To Charles Stuart, June 8, and to Hill, June 9.\r\n\r\n  [273] This movement, unchronicled elsewhere, appears in D’Urban’s\r\n  diary, April 26. ‘The Portuguese ordered to the front, consisting\r\n  of two brigades of artillery, 4th and 6th Caçadores, 1st and 16th\r\n  (Pack), 7th and 19th (Coleman), 6th and 18th (Alex. Campbell),\r\n  11th and 23rd (Collins), 9th and 21st (Harvey) of the Line. They\r\n  all go into march on the 28th, and will arrive by successive\r\n  brigades at Celorico in four days.’\r\n\r\n  [274] At this moment the total force of the allied army was:--\r\n\r\n    1st Division (all British)  6,000 bayonets.\r\n    3rd    ”     British        2,500 with Harvey’s Portuguese   1,800\r\n    4th    ”        ”           4,000 with Collins’s    ”        2,500\r\n    Light  ”        ”           2,500 with 2 Caçador Batts.      1,000\r\n    Pack’s, Campbell’s, and Coleman’s Portuguese brigades        8,000\r\n    Cavalry (British)           2,100        Portuguese            700\r\n    Artillery   ”               1,000        Portuguese            600\r\n                               ------                           ------\r\n                               18,100                           14,600\r\n\r\nBy bringing up every man Wellington could have attacked Ney’s\r\n30,000 in front of Rodrigo with 33,000, of whom nearly half would\r\nhave consisted of the newly organised Portuguese brigades, of which\r\nhardly a battalion had been under fire. He would have had under 3,000\r\ncavalry to face 5,000, and a marked inferiority in artillery also. No\r\npractical assistance could have been got by inviting the co-operation\r\nof Martin Carrera’s depleted Spanish division of 3,000 men, which\r\nlay on the hills about the sources of the Agueda, watching Ney’s\r\nflank. If the first stroke should fail, and Ney were not surprised,\r\nWellington would have Junot’s 17,000 men to count with within\r\nforty-eight hours. Ciudad Rodrigo lies on a plain, a full day’s march\r\nfrom the hills, and by advancing to relieve it the British army must\r\ncommit itself to an action in the open. It is no wonder then that\r\nWellington refused to attempt the movement; weak in cavalry and with\r\n15,000 troops of uncertain value in his ranks, he would have been mad\r\nto embark upon such an operation. It was most improbable that Ney\r\ncould have been surprised, and forced to fight without Junot’s aid,\r\nwhen he had 5,000 horsemen at hand, to discover and report the first\r\nmovement of the Anglo-Portuguese. Napoleon had been right when he\r\ntold Masséna that it was practically impossible that Wellington would\r\noffer battle in the plains. Herrasti had been sent assurances that\r\nthe British army would do anything that was feasible for his relief,\r\nbut he was warned in a supplementary letter of June 6th that it might\r\nbe impossible to aid him. ‘You will believe,’ wrote Wellington, ‘that\r\nif I should not be able to attempt your relief, it will be owing\r\nto the superior strength of the enemy, and to the necessity for my\r\nattending to other important objects[275].’ Notwithstanding this\r\ncaution it would appear that the Spanish governor still hoped for\r\nprompt assistance. It seemed to him, as it did to all Spanish and\r\nsome English officers at the time[276], that Wellington would not\r\nbe able to endure the spectacle of Ciudad Rodrigo being taken while\r\nhis outposts were lying only six miles in front of it. Those who\r\nheld such views little knew the inflexible character of the man with\r\nwhom they had to deal, or his contempt for considerations of pride\r\nor sentiment. To take a great risk, when victory would mean only the\r\nraising of the siege of Rodrigo till Junot and Kellermann should have\r\njoined Ney, while defeat might mean the loss of Portugal, was not in\r\nconsonance with Wellington’s character. The possible gain and loss\r\nwere too unequal, and he very rightly, and not without much regret,\r\nremained in observation at Celorico[277]. He sums up the matter\r\nthus:--‘I must leave the mountains and cross the plains, as well as\r\ntwo rivers, to raise the siege. To do this I have about 33,000 men\r\n(including Carrera’s Spaniards), of which 3,000 are cavalry[278].\r\nIncluded are 15,000 Spaniards and Portuguese, which troops (to say\r\nthe best of them) are of doubtful quality. Is it right, under these\r\ncircumstances, to risk a general action to raise the siege of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo? I should think not[279].’ And again, ‘My object is to be\r\nable to relieve the place, if it should be advisable to attempt it,\r\nin consequence of any alteration in the enemy’s force. This does\r\nnot appear to be a very probable event at present, and ought not to\r\nbe provided for according to the common rules of prudence, at any\r\nconsiderable risk[280].’ Expressions of regret are added, ‘I do not\r\ngive the matter up; if they hold out like men they are worth saving,\r\nand under certain circumstances it might be possible to “incur the\r\nrisk.”’ But the ‘certain circumstances’ never came about; they seem\r\nto have been the possibility either that (1) Ney or Junot might make\r\ndetachments, or move their corps into a less concentrated position\r\nthan they at present occupied, or (2) that they might form a covering\r\narmy, and advance to drive him off from his present quarters, which\r\nwere too close to Ciudad Rodrigo for their comfort. This last\r\ncontingency almost happened, as we shall see; probably if the enemy\r\nhad come out to attack him Wellington would have accepted battle, in\r\none of the defensive positions that he knew so well how to select.\r\n\r\n  [275] _Dispatches_, vi. p. 172.\r\n\r\n  [276] D’Urban, for example, wrote in his journal on June 18 that\r\n  he took the daring step of suggesting a surprise attack on Ney to\r\n  the General. No notice was taken of his suggestion.\r\n\r\n  [277] Picton summed up the situation in a letter to a friend [see\r\n  Robinson’s _Life of Picton_, i. 273] very clearly: ‘If we attempt\r\n  to relieve the place the French will drive us out of Portugal:\r\n  while if they get possession of it, they will lose time, which is\r\n  more important to them than Ciudad Rodrigo. But they have got to\r\n  find this out.’\r\n\r\n  [278] A slight under-estimate, as it would seem, for with La\r\n  Carrera’s force the whole would have been 36,000 sabres and\r\n  bayonets. Of the 3,000 cavalry 700 were Portuguese and 300\r\n  Spaniards.\r\n\r\n  [279] Wellington to Henry Wellesley, June 20.\r\n\r\n  [280] Wellington to Craufurd, June 24.\r\n\r\nNey, as has been already mentioned, arrived before the fortress with\r\nsome 20,000 men on May 30th. On June 1st he threw a bridge across the\r\nAgueda, a mile and a half above Rodrigo, but sent no troops across\r\nit. Two days later Masséna came up from the rear, approved of the\r\nplan that had been formed for breaching the city from the side of the\r\ntwo Tesons, and, having reviewed the 6th Corps, took his way back\r\nto Salamanca. At this moment he gave orders to Reynier and the 2nd\r\nCorps to leave Truxillo and the valley of the Guadiana, and to cross\r\nthe Tagus to Coria and Plasencia, from whence they could threaten\r\nCastello Branco and Abrantes. This was in accordance with the orders\r\nof the Emperor, who had bidden him call up Reynier from the Guadiana,\r\nto cover his flank. Such a movement had been foreseen by Wellington,\r\nwho as early as June 9th had directed Hill to leave Portalegre with\r\nhis 12,000 men, and to cross the Tagus at Villa Velha the moment\r\nthat Reynier should have passed it at Almaraz[281]. Some days later\r\nthe Galician general Mahy sent to the British head quarters four\r\nduplicates of Napoleon’s dispatches to Masséna and King Joseph, which\r\nhad been intercepted by guerrillas on the way to Salamanca[282]. They\r\ncorroborated all Wellington’s suspicions, and enabled him to provide\r\nagainst the danger on this side even before it had begun to arise.\r\nHill’s route by Villa Velha being appreciably shorter than that of\r\nReynier, he was in position beyond the Tagus before the 2nd Corps had\r\nreached Coria. Their cavalry met and skirmished at Ladoeiro on the\r\nZarza-Castello Branco road on July 22nd. Thus the relative position\r\nof the two hostile forces in the south was exactly preserved:\r\nWellington knew that he could call in Hill to join his main army as\r\nquickly as Masséna could draw Reynier to himself through the Pass of\r\nPerales--the only route possible for him. He felt all the more secure\r\nbecause he had now some British troops at Abrantes ready to support\r\nHill. Three newly arrived battalions[283], which landed at Lisbon\r\nearly in April, had been passed up the Tagus to Thomar and the line\r\nof the Zezere, where, uniting with two Portuguese brigades, they\r\nformed Leith’s ‘5th Division,’ a fresh factor in the situation. This\r\ndetachment, with two batteries added, could assist Hill with 7,000\r\nmen, if Reynier should push forward in the direction of Castello\r\nBranco.\r\n\r\n  [281] Wellington to Hill, July 9.\r\n\r\n  [282] These were Napoleon’s dispatches nos. 16,505, 16,519-20,\r\n  and 16,504, as is shown by the excellent analysis of them given\r\n  by D’Urban in his diary. He read them over with Beresford on July\r\n  1. No. 16,519 was very valuable, as giving the exact strength\r\n  of the 2nd, 6th, and 8th Corps--the first absolutely certain\r\n  analysis of them that Wellington obtained.\r\n\r\n  [283] These were the 3/1st, 1/9th, 2/38th, which arrived at\r\n  Lisbon April 1-8. Leith’s division was formally constituted only\r\n  on July 15, but really existed since June.\r\n\r\nWhether at this moment Masséna was proposing to order a serious\r\nattack on this side, or whether he was from the first intending\r\nto bring up the 2nd Corps to join the main army, is not certain.\r\nNapoleon in some of his dispatches seems to recommend the rather\r\nhazardous ‘attack on double external lines’--a result of his general\r\nunder-estimate of Wellington’s resisting power. On May 29th he\r\ntold his lieutenant that with 50,000 men of the 6th and 8th Corps\r\nhe could capture both Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, and then march\r\n‘methodically’ into Portugal, while Reynier at Alcantara could cover\r\nthe communication with Madrid and menace Upper Beira; ‘le prince le\r\nmaintiendra dans cette position sans le laisser entamer.’ Masséna,\r\nhowever, did not think his main army strong enough, and, being left\r\na free hand by his master, ultimately called in Reynier to join him,\r\nand so freed Wellington from the harassing doubt as to whether he\r\nmight not have to defend himself on the Zezere and on the Mondego at\r\nthe same moment.\r\n\r\nLong before the orders reached the 2nd Corps to move up from Truxillo\r\nto Coria and Zarza, the siege of Rodrigo had begun in earnest. On\r\nJune 1st, as we have already seen, Ney had cast a bridge across the\r\nAgueda above the town; four days later a second was constructed at\r\nthe ford of Lora, below the place. The moment that it was completed,\r\nMarchand’s division, half Mermet’s, and the light cavalry brigade\r\nof Lamotte crossed the river and established camps on its western\r\nbank. The horsemen pushed back Craufurd’s pickets to Marialva and\r\nManzanilla, and completely cut his communication with Rodrigo, which\r\nhad hitherto been intermittently open. The troops which had passed\r\nthe river threw up redoubts to cover the bridge heads, and slightly\r\nentrenched their camps. On June 8th Ney received the first convoy of\r\nhis siege train, which continued to come in by detachments during the\r\nnext week, till he had fifty heavy guns in hand, with 700 rounds for\r\neach, and 2,000 gunners and sappers of the ‘Grand Park[284].’\r\n\r\n  [284] See the Emperor’s dispatches to Berthier of May 27 and May\r\n  29.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the French opened their first parallel on the Great\r\nTeson, on a front of 1,500 yards; it was only 500 yards from the\r\nglacis of the town. Herrasti kept up a furious fire upon it, and\r\nvexed the workmen by two sorties, which were not pressed home and\r\ndid no harm. On the 19th six batteries on the Teson were commenced;\r\nthe work was easy owing to the great store of gabions and sandbags\r\nalready in store, which the brigades of Maucune and Ferey had\r\nprepared in May. While the emplacements for the guns were being got\r\nready, the sappers pushed forward zig-zags from the right end of the\r\nfirst parallel down the slopes on the flank of the Little Teson. One\r\napproach was directed toward the isolated convent of Santa Cruz, the\r\nother toward the extreme northern angle of the town. The Spaniards,\r\nthough firing furiously day and night, could not prevent either the\r\nconstruction of the batteries or the advance of the approaches;\r\nwherefore Julian Sanchez, seeing that his cavalry could not live\r\nunder the oncoming bombardment, got leave from the governor to quit\r\nthe town. On the night of the 21st-22nd he crossed the bridge, broke\r\nthrough the lines of Marchand’s division, and escaped by the Fuente\r\nGuinaldo road with his 200 Lancers. He came into Craufurd’s camp, and\r\ngave a full report of the state of the garrison and the progress of\r\nthe enemy’s works.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the French to open their second parallel so\r\nlong as the convent of Santa Cruz was held, for the fire of this\r\noutwork would have enfiladed its whole length. On the night of\r\nthe 23rd-24th, therefore, Ney tried to storm the convent with a\r\npicked body of Grenadiers; they blew in its door with a petard,\r\nand set fire to its lower story, but were finally driven off. The\r\nconvent was partially destroyed, but the garrison gallantly clung\r\nto its ruins, and covered themselves in the débris. The French\r\nlost fifteen killed and fifty wounded that night. On June 25th the\r\nbatteries opened, without waiting for the reduction of Santa Cruz,\r\nwith forty-six guns placed in six batteries along the crest of the\r\nTeson. The counter-fire of the besieged was very effective; two\r\nexpense magazines containing 9,000 lb. of powder were blown up in the\r\ntrenches, many guns dismounted, and one battery silenced. The loss of\r\nthe besiegers was heavy[285]. The Spaniards suffered less, but fires\r\nbroke out in several quarters of the town from the shells thrown by\r\nthe French mortars, and many houses were destroyed. The ruins of\r\nthe convent of Santa Cruz, moreover, were so thoroughly battered to\r\npieces that the garrison retired, when an assault was made upon it\r\nby 300 Grenadiers after nightfall. This enabled the French to push\r\nforward their works much nearer to the town.\r\n\r\n  [285] Masséna came up from Salamanca this day to inspect the\r\n  bombardment, and made (as was his wont) a rather mendacious\r\n  report thereon to the Emperor, declaring that the French loss\r\n  had been 12 killed and 41 wounded, whereas it had exceeded 100\r\n  [see Belmas, iii. p. 233], and that the defence of the place was\r\n  seriously impaired--which it was not as yet.\r\n\r\nFour days of furious artillery engagement followed, in which the\r\nbesiegers, though suffering heavily, succeeded not only in setting\r\nmore than half the town on fire, but, what was more serious, in\r\nmaking a breach in the fausse-braye, at the projecting angle of the\r\nnorth side of the city, on which four of the batteries had been\r\ntrained, and in injuring the inner mediaeval wall at the back of it.\r\nBelieving, wrongly as it seems, that the breach was practicable, Ney\r\nsent an officer to summon the town. Herrasti replied that he was\r\nstill in a position to defend himself, and ‘that after forty-nine\r\nyears of service he knew the laws of war and his military duty.’ He\r\nmade, however, the unusual request that he might be allowed to send a\r\nletter to Wellington, and that a suspension of arms should be granted\r\ntill the return of his messenger. The Marshal, as was natural, sent a\r\nrefusal, and ordered the bombardment to recommence (June 28th).\r\n\r\nUp to this moment the French engineers had been under the impression\r\nthat Ciudad Rodrigo would probably surrender when it had been\r\nbreached, without standing an assault. Now that they recognized\r\nthat the governor intended to fight to the last, and noted that he\r\nhad spent the night following the summons in clearing the ditch and\r\nrepairing the damaged fausse-braye with sandbags, they resolved that\r\nthe breaching batteries must be brought closer in, and the approaches\r\npushed up to the foot of the walls. Accordingly a second parallel was\r\nopened along the front of the Little Teson, two hundred and fifty\r\nyards in advance of the first, on the night of July 1st. On the same\r\nnight a column of 600 men stormed the convent of San Francisco in\r\nthe suburb, a post which would have enfiladed the southern end of\r\nthe new parallel in the most dangerous fashion. Having obtained this\r\nlodgement in the suburb the French set to work to conquer the whole\r\nof it, and after some stiff street-fighting stormed Santa Clara, its\r\ncentral stronghold. Herrasti thereupon evacuated the rest of the\r\nscattered houses, and withdrew all his troops inside the town (July\r\n3rd).\r\n\r\nThe new battery on the Little Teson was costly to build and\r\nmaintain--on one night the French lost sixty-one men killed and\r\nwounded in it[286]. But it was very effective; the original breach\r\nwas much enlarged, and the old wall behind it was reduced to ruins.\r\nMeanwhile a mortar battery, placed in the conquered suburb, played\r\nupon the parts of the town which had hitherto escaped bombardment,\r\nand reduced many streets to ashes. The position of the garrison\r\nwas unsatisfactory, and Herrasti sent out several emissaries to\r\nbeg Wellington to help him, ere it was too late. Most of these\r\nadventurers were captured by the French, but at least two reached\r\nthe British commander[287], who had recently come up to the front\r\nto observe for himself the state of the enemy’s forces. He found\r\nthem too strong to be meddled with, and sent back a letter stating\r\nthat he was ready to move if he saw any chance of success, but that\r\nat present none such was visible. He then retired, after leaving\r\nCraufurd two squadrons of the 16th Light Dragoons to strengthen his\r\nthin outpost line. Herrasti, though much dispirited by Wellington’s\r\nreply, continued to make a vigorous defence, but the town was now\r\nmostly in ruins, and the breach gaped wide.\r\n\r\n  [286] Belmas, iii. 245, July 2.\r\n\r\n  [287] See Shaw-Kennedy’s _Diary_, pp. 208-9 and 211.\r\n\r\nOn July 4th Masséna, who had again come up to visit the siege,\r\nobtained intelligence that Wellington had been with the Light\r\nDivision at Gallegos, and determined to push back the British\r\noutposts, in order to discover whether the front line of his enemy\r\nhad been strengthened by any troops from Portugal. It seemed to\r\nhim likely enough that the British general might have massed his\r\narmy for a bold stroke at the besiegers, now that the strength of\r\nCiudad Rodrigo was running low. Accordingly St. Croix’s division\r\nof dragoons, supported by a brigade of Junot’s infantry, crossed\r\nthe Azava brook and drove in Craufurd’s cavalry pickets. They\r\nretired, skirmishing vigorously all the way, to Gallegos, where the\r\nfive infantry battalions of the Light Division had concentrated.\r\nCraufurd, having strict orders from his chief that he was not to\r\nfight, fell back on Fort Concepcion, the work on the Spanish frontier\r\nhalf way to Almeida. Thereupon the French retired, having obtained\r\nthe information that they wanted, viz. that Craufurd had not been\r\nreinforced by any considerable body of troops from the rear. The\r\nLight Division had manœuvred with its customary intelligence and\r\nalertness all day; its flanks were being continually turned by\r\nhorsemen in overpowering numbers, but it beat them off with ease,\r\nand lost only five men wounded while falling back across ten miles\r\nof absolutely open country. The French lost five officers and over\r\ntwenty men[288], mostly in combats with the German Hussars, who\r\nsurpassed themselves on this day, and repeatedly charged the heads\r\nof the hostile columns on favourable occasions. For the future\r\nCraufurd kept behind the Dos Casas, while the French took up his old\r\nline on the Azava. This move made any attempt to help Ciudad Rodrigo\r\na harder business than before, since the British outposts were now\r\nfifteen instead of only six miles from the town. An attempt to storm\r\nby surprise the French camps on the near side of the place was for\r\nthe future impossible.\r\n\r\n  [288] Belmas, iii. 250. For the conduct of the Hussars see\r\n  Beamish’s _German Legion_, i. pp. 274-6. Martinien’s lists show\r\n  that the 1st French dragoons lost one, the 2nd three, and the 4th\r\n  one officer on this day.\r\n\r\nWarned by this activity on the part of the enemy, Wellington again\r\nreinforced Craufurd’s cavalry, giving him three squadrons of the 14th\r\nLight Dragoons, so that the Light Division had now some 1,200 horse\r\nto watch its long and much exposed front. But the French advance now\r\nhalted again for a full fortnight, the demonstration of July 4th\r\nhaving had no other purpose than that of ascertaining the strength of\r\nthe British observing force behind the Azava.\r\n\r\nOn the four days that followed Craufurd’s retreat the French\r\nbatteries were thundering against the northern angle of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo, and had reduced it to one vast breach more than 120 feet\r\nbroad. But Ney, more sparing of life than was his wont, refused to\r\norder an assault till the whole of the Spanish artillery on the\r\nneighbouring front should have been silenced, and till the engineers\r\nshould have worked up to and blown in the counterscarp. This last\r\npreliminary was accomplished on the night of the eighth, when a mine\r\ncontaining 800 lb. of powder was exploded with success just outside\r\nthe counterscarp, and cast down a vast amount of earth into the\r\nditch, so that there was now an almost level road from the advanced\r\ntrenches to the foot of the inner wall. The garrison repeatedly built\r\nup the lip of the breach with palisades and sandbags, under a heavy\r\nfire and at great expense of life. But their flimsy repairs were\r\nswept away again and again by the batteries on the Little Teson, and\r\nall their guns on this front of the walls were gradually disabled or\r\ndestroyed. Early on the afternoon of July 9th the engineers informed\r\nthe Marshal that Ciudad Rodrigo was untenable, and that a storm could\r\nnot fail of success. Three battalions, composed of picked voltigeur\r\nand grenadier companies, were brought up to the advanced trenches,\r\nunder the Marshal’s personal superintendence. Before letting them\r\nloose on the broad acclivity of rubble before them, Ney asked for\r\nthree volunteers who would take the desperate risk of climbing up\r\nto the crest of the breach to see if it were retrenched behind. A\r\ncorporal and two privates made this daring venture, ran lightly up\r\nto the summit, fired their muskets into the town, and descended\r\nunhurt, under a scattering fire from the few Spaniards who were still\r\nholding on to the ruins. On receiving their assurance that nothing\r\nwas to be feared, Ney ordered the storming battalions to move out\r\nof the trenches, but ere they had started an officer with a white\r\nflag appeared on the breach, and descended to inform the Marshal\r\nthat the Governor was prepared to capitulate. Finding that Ney was\r\nimmediately below, Herrasti came out in person with his staff a few\r\nminutes later, and settled the whole matter in a short conversation.\r\nNey congratulated the white-haired veteran on his handsome defence,\r\nreturned him his sword, and told him that he should have all the\r\nhonours of war.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the garrison marched out next morning about 4,000 strong,\r\nlaid down its arms below the glacis, and was marched off to Bayonne.\r\nThe Spaniards had lost 461 killed and 994 wounded, just a quarter of\r\ntheir force, in their highly honourable resistance. They had only a\r\nfew days’ provisions left, and, though their munitions were by no\r\nmeans exhausted, they would have been forced to yield for want of\r\nfood, even if the storm had failed, which was absolutely impossible.\r\nThe French captured 118 guns, most of them in bad order or disabled,\r\nand 7,000 muskets. Not a house or church in the place was intact,\r\nand a large majority were roofless or levelled to the ground. There\r\nwas no use whatever in protracting the resistance, and it is clear\r\nthat Herrasti had done all that a good officer could. In his dispatch\r\nto the Junta he spoke somewhat bitterly of the fact that Wellington\r\nhad made no effort to relieve the place, showing feeling natural\r\nenough under the circumstances. Martin La Carrera, who had been\r\ncommanding the Spanish division that lay in the mountains south of\r\nthe town, expressed his wrath still more bitterly, and marched off\r\nto Estremadura in high dudgeon, the moment that the news of the\r\nsurrender reached him.\r\n\r\nThe French had been forced to much greater exertions in the siege\r\nof Rodrigo than they had expected when they first sat down before\r\nits walls. Their artillery had thrown 11,000 shells and 18,000\r\nround shot into the place, which almost exhausted their store of\r\nmunitions--only 700 rounds for each of their fifty guns having been\r\nprovided. They had lost 180 killed and over 1,000 wounded, mainly in\r\nthe costly work of pushing forward the approaches towards the wall,\r\nbefore the Spanish artillery fire had been silenced. Professional\r\ncritics attributed the delays and losses of the siege entirely to\r\nthe fact that the engineers believed, when they first planned their\r\nworks, that the enemy would surrender the moment that a breach had\r\nbeen made, an idea which had never entered into Herrasti’s head[289].\r\nMasséna showed his ill-temper, when all was over, by sending the\r\ncivilian members of the Junta as prisoners to France, and imposing a\r\nfine of 500,000 francs on the miserable ruined town. It is surprising\r\nto learn that he actually succeeded in extracting half that sum from\r\nthe homeless and starving population.\r\n\r\n  [289] See the criticisms in Belmas, iii. 259. Compare the views\r\n  of the artilleryman Hulot, pages 306-9 of his autobiography.\r\n\r\nOn the day that the garrison of Rodrigo marched out (July 10)\r\nCraufurd had suffered a misadventure. Seeing that the French foragers\r\nwere busy in the villages between the Azava and the Dos Casas, he\r\nhad resolved to make an attempt to surprise some of their bands, and\r\nwent out from Fort Concepcion with six squadrons of cavalry[290],\r\nsix companies of the Rifles and the 43rd, a battalion of Caçadores\r\nand two guns. Coming suddenly upon the French covering party near\r\nthe village of Barquilla, he ordered his cavalry to pursue them.\r\nThe enemy, consisting of two troops of dragoons and 200 men of the\r\n22nd regiment from Junot’s corps, began a hasty retreat towards\r\ntheir lines. Thereupon Craufurd bade his leading squadrons, one of\r\nthe German Hussars and one of the 16th, to charge[291]. They did\r\nso, falling upon the infantry, who halted and formed square in a\r\ncorn-field to receive them. The charge, made by men who had been\r\ngalloping for a mile, and had been much disordered by passing some\r\nenclosures, failed. The troopers, opening out to right and left under\r\nthe fire of the square, swept on and chased the French cavalry, who\r\nwere making off to the flank. They followed them for some distance,\r\nfinally overtaking them and making two officers and twenty-nine men\r\nprisoners. Meanwhile Craufurd called up the next squadron from the\r\nroad, the leading one of the 14th Light Dragoons, and sent it in\r\nagainst the little square. Headed by their colonel Talbot the men\r\nof the 14th charged home, but were unable to break the French, who\r\nstood firm and waited till the horses’ heads were within ten paces of\r\ntheir bayonets before firing. Talbot and seven of his men fell dead,\r\nand some dozen more were disabled. Before another squadron could\r\ncome up, the French slipped off into the enclosures of the village\r\nof Cismeiro and got away. It was said that no effort was made to\r\nstop them because two outlying squadrons of British cavalry[292],\r\nwhich had ridden in towards the sound of the firing, were mistaken\r\nfor a large body of French horse coming up to the rescue of the\r\ninfantry. Both Craufurd and the British cavalry were much criticized\r\nover this affair[293]; but it was, in truth, nothing more than an\r\nexample of the general rule that horsemen could not break steady\r\ninfantry, properly formed in square, during the Peninsular War. The\r\ninstances to the contrary are few. It was said at the time that\r\nCraufurd might have used his leading squadrons to detain and harass\r\nthe French till his guns or his infantry, which were a mile to the\r\nrear, could be brought up. This may have been so, but criticism after\r\nthe event is easy, and if the guns or the riflemen had come up ten\r\nminutes late, and the French infantry had been allowed to go off\r\nuncharged, the General would have been blamed still more. He lost in\r\nall an officer and eight men killed, and twenty-three wounded, while\r\nhe took thirty-one prisoners, but the defeat rankled, and caused\r\nso much unpleasant feeling that Wellington went out of his way to\r\nsend for and rebuke officers who had been circulating malevolent\r\ncriticism[294]. The French captain Gouache, who had commanded the\r\nsquare, was very properly promoted and decorated by Masséna: nothing\r\ncould have been more firm and adroit than his conduct[295].\r\n\r\n  [290] Viz. three squadrons of the 14th, one (Krauchenberg’s)\r\n  of the 1st Hussars K.G.L., and two of the 16th. The other two\r\n  squadrons of the hussars, and the 4th squadron of the 14th, were\r\n  holding the outpost line to right and left.\r\n\r\n  [291] It is certain that both charged, and both were beaten off.\r\n  But the regimental diarists of the two regiments each mention\r\n  only the repulse of the squadron from the other corps. See\r\n  Tompkinson (of the 16th), _Diary_, p. 31, and Von Linsingen’s\r\n  letter (from the 1st Hussars), printed in Beamish, i. 279-80.\r\n\r\n  [292] Von Grüben’s squadron of the K.G.L. Hussars, and the fourth\r\n  squadron of the 14th Light Dragoons, neither of which formed part\r\n  of Craufurd’s little expedition. The former had been watching\r\n  Villa de Ciervo, the latter was on outpost duty.\r\n\r\n  [293] Charles Napier in his diary [_Life_, i. p. 132] and\r\n  Tomkinson [p. 31] accuse Craufurd of reckless haste. Harry Smith,\r\n  in his autobiography [i. p. 22], holds that the Rifles could have\r\n  got up in time to force the square to surrender. Leach [p. 142]\r\n  makes much the same comment. All these were eye-witnesses. Yet it\r\n  would have taken some time to bring up the guns or the infantry,\r\n  and the French were near broken ground, over which they might\r\n  have escaped, if not immediately assailed. See also Craufurd’s\r\n  Life by his grandson, pp. 114-16.\r\n\r\n  [294] Among these officers was General Stewart, the\r\n  adjutant-general, see Wellington to Craufurd, from Alverca, July\r\n  23, a very interesting letter, commented on in the _Life of\r\n  Craufurd_, pp. 117-20.\r\n\r\n  [295] Hulot (p. 36) says that he met the square retiring, and\r\n  noticed that numbers of the bayonets and gun-barrels had been cut\r\n  and bent by the blows of the English dragoons, as they tried to\r\n  force their way in. See Masséna’s dispatch to Berthier of Aug.\r\n  10, in Belmas’s _Pièces Justificatives_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCOMBAT OF THE COA: SIEGE OF ALMEIDA (JULY-AUGUST 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 10th the French had entered Ciudad Rodrigo, but ten days\r\nmore elapsed before they made any further advance. Masséna, who had\r\nreturned to the front, was resolved to follow his master’s orders\r\nand to act ‘methodically.’ It was clearly incumbent on him to begin\r\nthe siege of Almeida as soon as possible, and, as that place is only\r\ntwenty-one miles from Ciudad Rodrigo, one long march would have\r\nplaced him before its walls. But since he had only a few thousand\r\nrounds of ammunition left for his heavy guns, he refused to move on\r\ntill all the available reserves were on their way from Salamanca to\r\nthe front, and requisition for a further supply had been sent to\r\nBayonne. He had also to do his best to scrape together more food,\r\nsince the magazines that Ney had collected were nearly exhausted when\r\nRodrigo fell. Moreover, 1,500 draught animals had died during the\r\nlate siege, and it was necessary to replace them before the Great\r\nPark could move forward.\r\n\r\nOn July 21st, however, some convoys having come up from Salamanca,\r\nMasséna directed Ney to advance with the 6th Corps and to drive\r\nCraufurd back on to Almeida. The main point that he was directed\r\nto ascertain on this day was whether the English intended to make\r\na stand at Fort Concepcion, the isolated Spanish work which faces\r\nAlmeida on the frontier, beyond the Turones. This was a solid\r\neighteenth-century fort, covering the bridge where the high-road\r\npasses the river. It had lately been repaired, and could have\r\nresisted a bombardment for some days. But it would have required\r\na garrison of 1,000 men, and, since it lies in the midst of the\r\nplain, there would be little chance of relieving it, if once it were\r\nsurrounded. Wellington, therefore, gave orders that it should be\r\nblown up whenever the French should advance in force toward Almeida,\r\nand that Craufurd should make no attempt to defend the line of the\r\nTurones, and should send back his infantry to Junca, a village about\r\na mile outside the gates of Almeida[296], keeping his cavalry only\r\nto the front. On the 21st Ney advanced with the whole of Loison’s\r\ndivision, and Treillard’s cavalry brigade. Thereupon Craufurd, with\r\nsome reluctance, retired and blew up Fort Concepcion as he went. The\r\nFrench advanced, skirmishing with the 14th Light Dragoons and the\r\nGerman Hussars, but finally halted at Val de Mula, four miles from\r\nAlmeida. Craufurd established himself at Junca, only three miles\r\nfrom the enemy’s line of pickets. On the next evening he received a\r\nstrong suggestion, if not quite an order, from his Chief to send his\r\ninfantry across the Coa. ‘I am not desirous of engaging an affair\r\nbeyond the Coa,’ wrote Wellington. ‘Under these circumstances, if\r\nyou are not covered from the sun where you are, would it not be\r\nbetter that you should come to this side of it, with your infantry at\r\nleast[297]?’ The tentative form of the note well marks the confidence\r\nthat the Commander-in-Chief was wont to place in his subordinate’s\r\njudgement. This time that confidence was somewhat misplaced, for\r\nCraufurd tarried two days longer by the glacis of Almeida, and\r\nthereby risked a disaster.\r\n\r\n  [296] Wellington to Craufurd from Alverca, July 16.\r\n\r\n  [297] Wellington to Craufurd from Alverca, July 22, 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Almeida is not on the Coa, but two miles\r\nfrom it, and that its guns, therefore, did not cover the one bridge\r\nover which Craufurd could make his retreat. Indeed, that bridge and\r\nthe river also are invisible from Almeida. The fortress is slightly\r\nraised above the level of the rolling plain, which extends as far\r\nas Ciudad Rodrigo: the river flows in a deep bed, so much below the\r\nplateau as to be lost to sight. Its ravine is a sort of cañon which\r\nmarks the end of the plains of Leon. It has often been remarked that\r\nAlmeida’s value would have been doubled, if only it had been on the\r\nnear side of the Coa, and commanded its bridge. But Portuguese kings\r\nhad built and rebuilt the old fortress on its original site, with no\r\nregard for strategy. Craufurd, then, should have remembered that, if\r\nhe were suddenly attacked in his camp outside the gates, he risked\r\nbeing thrown back into the town (the last thing he would wish), or\r\nbeing hustled down to the bridge and forced to pass his division\r\nacross it in dangerous haste. But he had so often challenged, held\r\nback, and evaded Ney’s and Junot’s advanced guards, that he evidently\r\nconsidered that he was taking no very serious risk in staying where\r\nhe was. He was, moreover, discharging a valuable function by keeping\r\nAlmeida from being invested, as stores and munitions were still being\r\npoured into the place. The only peril was that he might be attacked\r\nboth without warning and by overwhelming superiority of numbers,\r\nwith the defile at his back. Neither of these misadventures had yet\r\nhappened to him during the four and a half months while he had been\r\ndefying the 6th and the 8th Corps along the banks of the Agueda. The\r\nFrench had never assailed him with much more than a division, nor had\r\nthey ever pressed on him with headlong speed, so as to prevent an\r\norderly retreat properly covered by a moderate rearguard.\r\n\r\nNow, however, Ney, untrammelled by any other operation, had his\r\nwhole corps concentrated behind Val de Mula, and having learnt of\r\nthe defile that lay in Craufurd’s rear, thought that he might be\r\nhurled into it and crushed or caught. Before dawn he arrayed his\r\nwhole 24,000 men in one broad and deep column. Two cavalry brigades,\r\nLamotte’s 3rd Hussars and 15th Chasseurs, and Gardanne’s 15th and\r\n25th Dragoons, were in front. Then came the thirteen battalions of\r\nLoison’s division, in a line of columns; behind them was Mermet with\r\neleven battalions more, while three regiments of Marchand’s division\r\n(the fourth was garrisoning Ciudad Rodrigo) formed the reserve.\r\nIn a grey morning, following a night of bitter rain, the French\r\nhorsemen rode at the British cavalry pickets, and sent them flying\r\nhelter-skelter across the three miles of rolling ground that lay in\r\nfront of the Light Division. On hearing the fire of the carbines\r\nCraufurd’s men turned out with their accustomed celerity, and in a\r\nvery short space were aligned to the right of Almeida, with their\r\nflank only 800 yards from the glacis, and their front covered by a\r\nseries of high stone walls bounding suburban fields. There would have\r\nbeen just enough time to get cavalry, guns, and impedimenta across\r\nthe bridge of the Coa if the General had started off at once. But,\r\nnot realizing the fearful strength that lay behind the French cavalry\r\nadvance, he resolved to treat himself to a rearguard action, and not\r\nto go till he was pushed. On a survey of the ground it is easy to\r\nunderstand the temptation, for it would be hard to find a prettier\r\nbattlefield for a detaining force, if only the enemy were in no more\r\nthan moderate strength. A long double-headed spur runs down from the\r\nhigh plateau on which Almeida stands to the Coa. Successive points\r\nof it can be held one after the other, and it is crossed by many\r\nstone walls giving good cover for skirmishers. With his left covered\r\nby the fire of the fortress, and his right ‘refused’ and trending\r\nback towards the river, Craufurd waited to be attacked, intending\r\nto give the leading French brigade a lesson. There was a delay of\r\nmore than an hour before the French infantry was up, but when the\r\nassault came it was overwhelming. Craufurd’s line of three British\r\nand two Portuguese battalions[298] was suddenly assaulted by Loison’s\r\nthirteen, who came on at the _pas de charge_ ‘yelling, with drums\r\nbeating, and the officers, like mountebanks, running ahead with their\r\nhats on their swords, capering like madmen and crying as they turned\r\nto wave on their men, “Allons, enfants de la Patrie, le premier qui\r\ns’avançera, Napoléon le recompensera[299].”’ The rolling fire of\r\nthe British stopped the first rush, when suddenly a French cavalry\r\nregiment, the 3rd Hussars, charged across the interval between\r\nCraufurd’s left and the walls of Almeida, braving the fire of the\r\nramparts in the most gallant style. Some fell, but the gunners were\r\nflurried at this unexpected development, and fired wildly, so that\r\nthe hussars swept down unchecked on the extreme flank of the Light\r\nDivision, where a company of the 95th Rifles was annihilated[300],\r\nand began riding along the rear of the line and rolling it up. They\r\nwere luckily checked for a moment by a stone wall, but Craufurd saw\r\nthat he must retreat at once, since he was turned on the side where\r\nhe had thought that he was safest. The cavalry and guns were ordered\r\nto gallop for the bridge, the Caçadores to follow them, and the rest\r\nof the infantry to fall back in échelon from the left, defending\r\neach enclosure and fold of the hillside as long as possible. But it\r\nis hard to make an orderly retreat when a foe with twofold strength\r\nin his fighting line is pressing hard. Moreover, the road to the\r\nbridge has an unfortunate peculiarity; instead of making straight for\r\nits goal it overshoots it, in order to descend the slope at an easy\r\npoint, and then comes back along the river bank for a quarter of a\r\nmile. The cavalry and guns, forced to keep to the road because the\r\nhillside was too steep for them, had to cover two sides of a triangle\r\nwith a sharp turn at the apex, which delayed them terribly. To add\r\nto the trouble an artillery caisson was upset at a sharp turn, and\r\ntook much trouble to right and send forward. Thus it chanced that\r\nthe covering infantry were driven down close to the bridge before\r\nthe Caçadores and the last of the guns had crossed the river. The\r\nretreat of the three British battalions had been most perilous; at\r\none moment a wing of the 43rd found themselves checked by a vineyard\r\nwall ten feet high, while the French were pressing hard on their\r\nrear. They only escaped by shoving a long part of it over by sheer\r\nstrength--fortunately, like all other walls in this part of Portugal,\r\nit was made of dry flat stones without mortar. Finally the 43rd, the\r\nRifles, and part of the 52nd were massed on a long knoll covered\r\nwith pine-trees, which lies above the bridge and completely masks it\r\nagainst an attack from above. While they held firm, Craufurd ranged\r\nthe guns and the Caçadores on the slopes upon the other side, so as\r\nto command the passage when the rest of the troops should have to\r\ncross. He then began to withdraw the 43rd, and part of that battalion\r\nhad already crossed the water, when five companies of the 52nd,\r\nwhich had occupied the extreme right wing of the division, were seen\r\nhastening along the river bank some way above the bridge. They had\r\nheld out a little too long on the slopes above, and seemed likely to\r\nbe cut off, for the French, noting their position, made a vigorous\r\neffort, and carried the knoll which protected their line of retreat\r\nto the point of passage. This was a desperate crisis, but such was\r\nthe splendid courage and initiative of the regimental officers of the\r\nLight Division that the disaster was averted. At one point Beckwith,\r\ncolonel of the Rifles, at another Major McLeod of the 43rd, called on\r\nthe disordered mass of men, who had been driven back to the bridge\r\nhead, to charge again and save the 52nd. The soldiers grasped the\r\nsituation, cheered and followed; they recaptured the knoll that they\r\nhad just lost, and held it for ten minutes more, gaining time for the\r\ncompanies of the 52nd to pass behind and cross the bridge. ‘No one\r\npresent,’ wrote an eye-witness, ‘can fail to remember the gallantry\r\nof Major McLeod. How either he or his horse escaped being blown to\r\natoms, while in this daring manner he charged on horseback at the\r\nhead of some 200 skirmishers of the 43rd and 95th mixed together,\r\nand headed them in making a dash at the line of French infantry,\r\nwhom we dislodged, I am at a loss to imagine. It was one of those\r\nextraordinary escapes which tend to implant in the mind some faith in\r\nthe doctrine of fatality[301].’\r\n\r\n  [298] The 43rd on the left, the two Caçador battalions in the\r\n  centre, the 52nd on the right, while the Rifles were partly\r\n  dispersed along the front, partly with the 43rd.\r\n\r\n  [299] Simmons’s _Journal of a British Rifleman_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n  [300] Of this, O’Hare’s Company of the 1/95th, sixty-seven\r\n  strong, an officer and eleven men were killed or wounded and\r\n  forty-five were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n  [301] Leach’s _Reminiscences_, pp. 149-50.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the 52nd were safe, the troops on the knoll evacuated\r\nit, and crossed the bridge behind them at full speed, while the\r\nFrench reoccupied the wooded eminence. If Ney had been wise he would\r\nhave stopped at this moment, and have contented himself with having\r\ndriven in the Light Division with a loss of 300 men, while his own\r\ntroops had suffered comparatively little. But, carried away by the\r\nexcitement of victory, he resolved to storm the bridge, thinking\r\nthat the British troops were too much shaken and disordered to make\r\nanother stand, even in a strong position. There were plenty of\r\nexamples in recent French military history, from Lodi to Ebersberg,\r\nwhere passages had been forced under difficulties as great.\r\nAccordingly he ordered the 66th, the leading regiment of Loison’s\r\ndivision, to push on and cross the river. This was a dire mistake:\r\nCraufurd already had the Caçadores in position behind stone walls a\r\nlittle above the bridge, and Ross’s guns placed across the road so as\r\nto sweep it from end to end. The British battalions were no sooner\r\nacross the river than they began to string themselves out behind the\r\nrocks and walls, which lie in a sort of small amphitheatre on the\r\nslope commanding the passage. The bridge, a two-arched structure\r\nseventy yards long, crosses the Coa diagonally, at a point where\r\nit is narrowed down between rocks, and flows very fiercely: it was\r\nflooded at this moment from the rain of the previous night, and\r\nwas swelling still, for a tropical storm had just begun and raged\r\nat intervals throughout the afternoon. The cavalry, useless at\r\nthe bridge, was sent up-stream to watch some difficult fords near\r\nAlveirenos.\r\n\r\nThe French 66th, ordered by the Marshal to carry the bridge, formed\r\nits grenadiers on the knoll, to lead the column, and then charged\r\nat the passage. But the leading company was mown down, before it\r\nhad got half way across, by a concentrated musketry salvo from the\r\nhillside in front, and the enfilading fire of the guns from the\r\nright. The column broke, and the men recoiled and dispersed among the\r\nrocks and trees by the bank, from whence they opened a fierce but\r\nineffective fire upon the well-sheltered British battalions. Ney, who\r\nhad now lost his temper, ordered up a _bataillon d’élite_ of light\r\ninfantry[302] which had distinguished itself at the siege of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo, and told his aide de camp Sprünglin to take the command and\r\ncross at all costs[303]. There ensued a most gallant effort and a\r\nhideous butchery. The Chasseurs flung themselves at the bridge, and\r\npushed on till it was absolutely blocked by the bodies of the killed\r\nand the wounded, and till they themselves had been almost literally\r\nexterminated, for out of a battalion of little more than 300 men 90\r\nwere killed and 147 wounded in less than ten minutes. A few survivors\r\nactually crossed the bridge, and threw themselves down among the\r\nrocks at its western end, where they took shelter from the British\r\nfire in a little corner of dead ground, but could of course make no\r\nfurther attempt to advance.\r\n\r\n  [302] The _Chasseurs de la Siège_ formed of picked marksmen from\r\n  all the regiments of the 6th Corps.\r\n\r\n  [303] That Ney himself was the person responsible for this mad\r\n  adventure seems proved by the journal of Sprünglin, who writes ‘À\r\n  midi je reçus de M. le Maréchal lui-même l’ordre d’emporter _à\r\n  tout prix_ le pont de la Coa, d’où deux compagnies de Grenadiers\r\n  venaient d’être repoussés. J’avais 300 hommes; je formai mon\r\n  bataillon en colonne et abordai les Anglais à la baïonnette, et\r\n  au cri de _Vive l’Empereur_. Le pont fut emporté, mais j’eus\r\n  4 officiers et 86 soldats tués, et 3 officiers et 144 soldats\r\n  blessés. Le 25 le bataillon, étant détruit, fut dissous.’ That\r\n  the bridge was ‘emporté’ in any other sense than that a score or\r\n  so of survivors got to the other side, and then returned, is of\r\n  course untrue. Sprünglin, p. 439.\r\n\r\nNey, irritated beyond measure, now bade a mounted officer sound\r\nfor a ford at a spot above the bridge, where the river spreads\r\nout into a broad reach. But horse and man were killed by a volley\r\nfrom the British side, and floated down the swollen stream[304].\r\nFinding the river impracticable, the Marshal again ordered the 66th\r\nto go forward: this third attack, delivered without the dash and\r\ndetermination of the first two, was beaten back with little trouble.\r\nThe firing then died down, and during one of the fierce rainstorms\r\nof the late afternoon the few chasseurs who had crossed the bridge\r\nran back and escaped to their own bank. Craufurd held the position\r\nthat he had occupied till midnight, and then retired on Pinhel. He\r\nhad lost 333 men only[305], and was fortunate therein, for half his\r\ndivision might have been destroyed if the officers had shown less\r\nintelligence and the men less pluck. The French had 527 casualties,\r\nfour-fifths of them in the mad attempt to force the bridge, in which\r\nthe colonel of the 66th and fifteen of his officers had fallen, and\r\nthe battalion of Chasseurs had been practically exterminated[306].\r\nNey forwarded an honest chronicle of the day’s doings to his chief,\r\nwhich Masséna wrote up, and sent to the Emperor turned into a work of\r\nfancy, in which he declared that he had destroyed 1,200 of Craufurd’s\r\nmen (whom he estimated at 2,000 horse and 8,000 infantry, double\r\ntheir real strength), taken 300 prisoners, a colour, and two guns.\r\nMaking no mention of the complete check that Loison’s division had\r\nsuffered at the bridge, he stated that ‘the Imperial troops have\r\nshown once again this day that there is no position which can resist\r\ntheir intrepidity.’ He added foolish gossip, ‘Their Estafete-Mor\r\n(chief Portuguese courier) has been captured with all his dispatches,\r\nin which are several of the 25th and 26th instant, which declare\r\nthat the English army is in complete rout, that its deplorable state\r\ncannot be exaggerated, that the English have never been in such a\r\nhot corner, that they have lost sixty officers, of whom they buried\r\ntwenty-four on the battlefield, about 400 dead and 700 wounded[307].’\r\nApparently these ‘dispatches’ are an invention of Masséna’s own. It\r\nis incredible that any British officer can have written such stuff\r\nafter a combat of which every man present was particularly proud, and\r\nin which the losses had been incredibly small, considering the risks\r\nthat had been run. Four officers, not twenty-four, had been killed,\r\nand one made prisoner. Instead of being in ‘complete rout’ the Light\r\nDivision had retired at leisure and unmolested, without leaving even\r\na wounded man or a single cart behind.\r\n\r\n  [304] For an interesting description of this incident, see George\r\n  Napier’s autobiography, p. 131.\r\n\r\n  [305] Thirty-six killed, 189 wounded, 83 missing. See Tables in\r\n  Appendix.\r\n\r\n  [306] Martinien’s invaluable lists show 7 officers killed and 17\r\n  wounded, which at the normal rate of 22 men per officer, exactly\r\n  corresponds to the actual loss of 117 killed and 410 wounded\r\n  (Koch, vii. 118).\r\n\r\n  [307] It is a curious fact that in the draft of Masséna’s\r\n  dispatch in the _Archives du Ministère de la Guerre_, we actually\r\n  catch him in the act of falsifying returns. There is first\r\n  written ‘Nous leur avons pris 100 hommes et deux pièces de canon.\r\n  Notre perte a été de près de 500 hommes tant tués que blessés.’\r\n  Then the figures 100 are scratched out and above is inserted\r\n  ‘un drapeau et 400 hommes,’ while for the French loss 500 is\r\n  scratched out and 300 inserted. Ney, whose dispatch was lying\r\n  before Masséna, had honestly written that Craufurd ‘a été chassé\r\n  de sa position avec une perte considérable de tués et de blessés,\r\n  nous lui avons fait en outre une centaine de prisonniers.’ Ney\r\n  reported also a loss of about 500 men, which Masséna deliberately\r\n  cut down to 300. Belmas (iii. 379) has replaced the genuine\r\n  figures in his reprint of Masséna’s dispatch, though both the\r\n  draft in the _Archives_ and the original publication in the\r\n  _Moniteur_ give the falsifications. Masséna says nought of the\r\n  check at the bridge, though Ney honestly wrote ‘au delà du Coa,\r\n  une réserve qu’il avait lui permis de se reconnaître, et il\r\n  continue sa retraite sur Pinhel la nuit du 24.’ As to the guns\r\n  captured, it was perfectly true that some cannon were taken that\r\n  day, but not in fighting, nor from Craufurd. The governor of\r\n  Almeida was mounting two small guns (4-pounders) on a windmill\r\n  some way outside the glacis. They had not been got up to their\r\n  position, but were lying below--removed from their carriages,\r\n  in order to be slung up more easily on to the roof. The mill\r\n  was abandoned when Ney came up, and the dismounted cannon fell\r\n  into his hands. He said not a word of them, any more than he\r\n  did of the imaginary flag alleged by Masséna to have been\r\n  captured. But the Prince of Essling brought in both, to please\r\n  the imperial palate, which yearned for British flags and guns.\r\n  His dispatch, published some weeks later in the _Moniteur_, came\r\n  into Craufurd’s hands in November, and provoked him to write a\r\n  vindication of his conduct, and a contradiction of ‘the false\r\n  assertions contained in Marshal Masséna’s report of an action\r\n  which was not only highly honourable to the Light Division,\r\n  but positively terminated in its favour, notwithstanding the\r\n  extraordinary disparity of numbers. For a corps of 4,000 men\r\n  performed, in the face of an army of 24,000, one of the most\r\n  difficult operations of war,--a retreat from a broken and\r\n  extensive position over one narrow defile, and defended during\r\n  the whole day the first defensible position that was to be found\r\n  in the neighbourhood of the place where the action commenced.’\r\n  For the whole letter see Alex. Craufurd’s _Life of Craufurd_, pp.\r\n  140-1.\r\n\r\nWellington was justly displeased with Craufurd for accepting this\r\nwholly unnecessary combat: if the Light Division had been withdrawn\r\nbehind the Coa on the 22nd, as he had advised, no danger would have\r\nbeen incurred, and the bridge might have been defended without\r\nthe preliminary retreat to the water’s edge. Yet so great was the\r\nconfidence in which Craufurd was held by Wellington, that their\r\ncorrespondence shows no break of cordiality or tension of relations\r\nduring the ensuing days[308], though unofficially the divisional\r\ngeneral was aware that the Commander-in-Chief had disapproved\r\nhis action, and felt the blame that was unspoken in the keenest\r\nfashion[309]. There was another British general involved in a serious\r\ndegree of culpability on the 24th: this was Picton, who hearing\r\nat his post of Pinhel the firing in the morning, rode up to the\r\nbridge of the Coa; there he met Craufurd, who was just preparing\r\nto resist Ney’s attempt to cross the river. Picton was asked to\r\nbring up the 3rd Division in support, which could have been done\r\nin less than three hours, but roughly refused, saying apparently\r\nthat Craufurd might get out of his own scrape. The generals parted\r\nafter an exchange of some hard words, and Picton rode back to order\r\nhis division to get ready to retreat, having committed one of the\r\ngreatest military sins, that of refusing to support a comrade in the\r\nmoment of danger, because he did not choose to compromise his own\r\ntroops[310].\r\n\r\n  [308] See the letter to Craufurd in the _Dispatches_, dated\r\n  July 26 and 27. His letter to Lord Liverpool of July 25 offers,\r\n  indeed, excuses for Craufurd. But in that to Henry Wellesley of\r\n  July 27, and still more in that to his relative Pole of July 31,\r\n  he expresses vexation. ‘I had positively forbidden the foolish\r\n  affairs in which Craufurd involved his outposts, ... and repeated\r\n  my injunction that he should not engage in an affair on the right\r\n  of the river.... You will say in this case, “Why not accuse\r\n  Craufurd?” I answer, “Because if I am to be hanged for it, I\r\n  cannot accuse a man who I believe has meant well, and whose error\r\n  was one of judgement, not of intention.”’\r\n\r\n  [309] See _Craufurd’s Life_, pp. 149-50.\r\n\r\n  [310] This interview was denied by Robinson in his _Life of\r\n  Picton_ (i. 294) on the mere allegation of some of Picton’s\r\n  staff that they had not heard of it, or been present at it. But\r\n  the evidence of William Campbell, Craufurd’s brigade-major,\r\n  brought forward by Napier at Robinson’s challenge, is conclusive.\r\n  See Napier, vi. pp. 418-19, for the ‘fiery looks and violent\r\n  rejoinders’ witnessed by Campbell. Picton had been specially\r\n  ordered to support Craufurd if necessary. See _Wellington\r\n  Dispatches_, v. pp. 535 and 547.\r\n\r\nHaving cleared the country-side beyond the Coa by pressing back the\r\nLight Division, and having ascertained by a reconnaissance that\r\nPicton had evacuated Pinhel on the night of the 25th, Masséna was\r\nable to sit down to besiege Almeida at his leisure. The investment\r\nwas assigned to Ney and the 6th Corps, while Junot and the 8th\r\nCorps were brought up from the Agueda, and placed in the villages\r\nbehind and to the right of the besieged place, so as to be able to\r\nsupport Ney at a few hours’ notice. The extreme steepness of the\r\nbanks of the Coa during its whole course rendered it most unlikely\r\nthat Wellington would attempt the relief of Almeida by a direct\r\nadvance. He would have had to force a passage, and the Coa, unlike\r\nthe Agueda, has very few fords. Its only two bridges, that opposite\r\nAlmeida, and that higher up at Castello Bom, were held in force by\r\nthe 6th Corps. The siege however might not improbably prove long.\r\nAlmeida was in far better repair than Ciudad Rodrigo, and had less\r\ndefects. The little town is situated on the culminating knoll of an\r\nundulating plateau, a very slight eminence, but one which was not\r\ncommanded by any higher ground as Rodrigo was by the two Tesons.\r\nThe outline of the place is almost circular, and exactly fits the\r\nround knoll on which it stands. It has six bastions, with demi-lunes\r\nand a covered way. There is a dry ditch cut in the solid rock, for\r\nAlmeida lies on a bare granite plateau, with only two or three feet\r\nof earth covering the hard stratum below. It was well armed with over\r\n100 guns, forty of which were 18-pounders or still heavier. It had\r\ncasemates completely proof against bomb fire, and large enough to\r\ncover the whole garrison. This, as has been already said, consisted\r\nof one regular regiment, the 24th of the Line over 1,200 strong, and\r\nthe three militia regiments of Arganil, Trancoso, and Vizeu--in all\r\nsome 4,000 infantry, with a squadron of the 11th cavalry regiment\r\nand 400 gunners. The governor was William Cox--an English colonel\r\nand a Portuguese brigadier; he had with him five other English\r\nofficers, all the rest of the garrison being Portuguese. There was\r\nan ample store both of food and of ammunition, which Wellington\r\nhad been pouring in ever since the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo began.\r\nOnly two serious defects existed in the place: the first was that\r\nits glacis was too low, and left exposed an unduly large portion of\r\nthe walls[311]. The second, a far worse fault, was that the grand\r\nmagazine was established in a rather flimsy mediaeval castle in the\r\ncentre of the town, and was not nearly so well protected as could\r\nhave been desired. Nevertheless Wellington calculated that Almeida\r\nshould hold out at least as long as Ciudad Rodrigo, and had some\r\nhope that its siege would detain Masséna so much that the autumn\r\nrains would set in before he had taken the place, in which case the\r\ninvasion of Portugal would assume a character of difficulty which it\r\nwas far from presenting in August or September.\r\n\r\n  [311] This came from the extreme hardness of the soil, which\r\n  induced the builders of the 18th-century enceinte to put less\r\n  earth into the glacis than was needed, since it had to be scraped\r\n  up and carried from a great distance, owing to the fact that the\r\n  coating of soil all around is so thin above the rock.\r\n\r\nFor some days after the investment of Almeida had been completed the\r\n6th Corps remained quiescent, and made no attempt to break ground in\r\nfront of the place. Ney was waiting for the Grand Park and the train,\r\nwhich had now started in detachments from Ciudad Rodrigo, but were\r\nadvancing very slowly on account of the lack of draught animals. For\r\na moment Wellington thought it possible that the enemy was about to\r\nmask Almeida, and to advance into Portugal with his main army without\r\ndelay[312]. This hypothesis received some support from the facts that\r\nJunot had moved up from the Agueda, and that Reynier had shown the\r\nhead of a column beyond the Pass of Perales. This last appeared a\r\nmost significant movement; for if the 2nd Corps was about to march\r\nup from the Tagus to join Masséna, the deduction was that it was\r\nrequired to join in a general invasion, since it was clear that it\r\nwas not needed for the mere siege of Almeida. Wellington accordingly\r\nwrote to urge Hill to keep a most vigilant eye on Reynier, and to\r\nbe ready to move up to the Mondego the moment that it was certain\r\nthat his opponent had passed the Sierra de Gata and linked himself\r\nto the main French army. As a matter of fact there was, as yet, no\r\ndanger from Reynier. The advance of one of his flanking detachments\r\nto Navas Frias beyond the Pass of Perales, and a raid made upon\r\nPenamacor on July 31 and upon Monsanto on August 1, by another, were\r\npure matters of foraging and reconnaissance. Reynier had no orders to\r\nmove up his whole force to join Masséna, and was only amusing himself\r\nby demonstrations. His actions became most puzzling to Wellington\r\nwhen, a few days later, he called back all the troops that had moved\r\nnorthward, and concentrated his force at Zarza la Mayor, on the road\r\nto Castello Branco, so as to threaten once more to invade Central\r\nPortugal by the line of the Tagus. This was no device of his own, but\r\nthe result of a dispatch from Masséna dated July 27, ordering him to\r\nkeep more to the south for the present, to threaten Abrantes, and to\r\nafford Hill no chance of joining Wellington.\r\n\r\n  [312] Wellington to Hill, Alverca, July 27, ‘There is not the\r\n  smallest appearance of the enemy’s intending to attack Almeida,\r\n  and I conclude that as soon as they have got together their\r\n  force, they will make a dash at us, and endeavour to make our\r\n  retreat as difficult as possible.’\r\n\r\nReynier’s feints meanwhile had given Hill some trouble; the\r\nappearance of a northward move on the part of his adversary had\r\ncaused the British general to make ready for a parallel march on\r\nFundão and Guarda, so as to connect himself with his chief. He\r\ntransferred his head quarters first from Castello Branco to Sarzedas,\r\nand then from Sarzedas to Atalaya, at the foot of the pass that leads\r\nto the Mondego valley, intending to cross the mountains the moment\r\nthat Reynier had passed over the Perales defiles with his main body.\r\nBut seeing the 2nd Corps unexpectedly turning back and concentrating\r\nat Zarza, Hill also retraced his steps, and lay at Sarzedas again\r\nfrom August 3rd till September 21st, with his advanced guard at\r\nCastello Branco and his cavalry well out to the front along the\r\nSpanish frontier, watching every movement of the 2nd Corps. During\r\nthis time of waiting the Portuguese cavalry of his division had two\r\nsmall but successful engagements with Reynier’s horse, of whom they\r\ncut up a squadron on the 3rd of August near Penamacor and another\r\non the 22nd at Ladoeiro, when two officers and sixty men of the\r\nHanoverian _Chasseurs à Cheval_ were killed or taken[313].\r\n\r\n  [313] For details of this combat see Foy’s observations on p. 97\r\n  of his _Vie Militaire_, ed. Girod de L’Ain.\r\n\r\nWellington’s doubts as to Masséna’s intentions in the first days of\r\nAugust were provoked not merely by the movements of the 2nd Corps,\r\nbut by a demonstration made on an entirely new front by General\r\nSerras, the officer who had been left with an unattached division to\r\nhold the plains of Leon, when Junot and the 8th Corps went off to\r\njoin the main army on the Agueda. In obedience to Masséna’s orders,\r\non July 27 Serras collected at Benavente as much of his division as\r\ncould be spared from garrison duty, and moved forward to threaten\r\nthe frontier of the Tras-os-Montes, far to the north of Portugal.\r\nHe advanced with some 5,000 men as far as Puebla de Senabria, from\r\nwhich on July 29 he drove out a small Spanish force under General\r\nTaboada--the weak brigade which Echevarria had formerly commanded.\r\nSilveira immediately collected all the Portuguese militia of his\r\ndistrict at Braganza, and prepared to defend the frontier. But\r\nSerras unexpectedly turned back, left a battalion of the 2nd Swiss\r\nRegiment and a squadron of horse in Puebla de Senabria, and returned\r\nto Zamora. The moment that he was gone Silveira and Taboada united\r\ntheir forces, attacked this small detached force, routed it, and\r\nshut it up in the town on August 4. It was forced to surrender some\r\nsix days later, about 20 officers and 350 men, all that remained of\r\n600, being made prisoners. Serras, who had hurried back when he heard\r\nof Silveira’s offensive movement, was too late by twelve hours to\r\nsave his men, and found Puebla de Senabria empty, for the allies had\r\ngone off with their prisoners and taken to the mountains. He then\r\nretired to Benavente, and Taboada reoccupied Puebla de Senabria,\r\nwhere he was not again disturbed. Serras soon after was drawn away\r\nto the north-east by the demands of Bonnet, whose communications\r\nwith Santander had once more been cut by Porlier’s roving Asturian\r\nbands. He called on his colleague to attack this partisan force in\r\nthe rear, and while Serras was hunting it at Potes and Alba, in the\r\nCantabrian Hills, Northern Portugal and Galicia were left undisturbed\r\nin September[314].\r\n\r\n  [314] For a narrative of these obscure campaigns see Schaller’s\r\n  _Souvenirs d’un officier Fribourgeois_, pp. 29-37.\r\n\r\nWhile glancing at the subsidiary operations in this remote corner\r\nof Spain, it may be worth while to note, as a proof of the slight\r\nhold which Bonnet and Serras possessed on their allotted districts,\r\nthat on June 7 Mahy threatened Astorga, while the Asturian bands\r\nof Colonel Barcena, eluding Bonnet, came down into the plains by\r\nthe Pass of Pajares and surprised Leon[315]. They got into the town\r\nby escalade at night, held it for two days, and only evacuated it\r\nwhen Serras came up in strength on June 9. Provoked at this bold\r\nadventure, Bonnet made his last attempt to conquer Western Asturias,\r\nand so to destroy the indefatigable and evasive partisans in his\r\nfront. He forced his way across the Narcea and the Navia, and his\r\nvanguard had reached Castropol, on the Galician border, upon July 5,\r\nwhen he heard to his disgust that the enemy had slipped behind him.\r\nBarcena was threatening his base at Oviedo, while Porlier’s band,\r\ncarried round by English ships, had landed near Llanes and cut the\r\ncommunication with Santander. These clever moves brought Bonnet back\r\nin haste: he evacuated Western Asturias, called up Serras to his aid,\r\nand was engaged in August and September in the hunt after Porlier\r\nwhich we have already mentioned[316].\r\n\r\n  [315] See ibid., pp. 32-3.\r\n\r\n  [316] For a narrative of these interesting but obscure movements,\r\n  see Schepeler, iii. 596-9. It is impossible to give a full\r\n  account of them here, but necessary to mention them, to show the\r\n  Sisyphean character of Bonnet’s task.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the main focus of the war in the North. On August\r\n15th Ney’s troops, having at last received the siege-train and a good\r\nsupply of munitions from Ciudad Rodrigo and Salamanca, broke ground\r\nin front of Almeida. Wellington was much relieved at the news, as\r\nit was now clear that Masséna was about to besiege the place, and\r\nnot to mask it and march forward into Portugal. The front which the\r\nengineers of the 6th Corps had chosen for attack was that facing the\r\nbastion of San Pedro on the south-east front of the town. The first\r\nparallel was drawn at a distance of only 500 yards from the walls;\r\nit was found very difficult to complete, owing to the shallowness\r\nof the earth, and had to be built with gabions and sandbags rather\r\nthan to be excavated in the rocky subsoil. In many places outcrops of\r\nstone came to the surface, and had actually to be blasted away by the\r\nsappers, in order to allow of a trench of the shallowest sort being\r\nformed. It was clear that the construction of approaches towards the\r\ntown would present the greatest difficulties, since there was little\r\nearth in which to burrow. Between the 17th and the 24th no less than\r\neleven batteries were constructed along the first parallel. They\r\nwere armed with more than fifty heavy guns, for there was artillery\r\nin abundance; in addition to the old siege-train many of the Spanish\r\nguns taken in Ciudad Rodrigo had been brought forward. The Portuguese\r\nkept up a vigorous but not very destructive fire all the time; but on\r\nthe 24th they succeeded in preventing the commencement of a second\r\nparallel, driving out the workmen before they could cover themselves\r\nin the stony ground. At six o’clock on the morning of the 26th August\r\nthe batteries were all completed and opened fire. Several quarters\r\nof the town were in flames before the afternoon, and the guns on the\r\nthree bastions attacked were unable to hold their own against the\r\nconverging fire directed on them. But no serious damage had been\r\ndone to the defences, and the governor was undismayed. At seven\r\no’clock in the evening, however, a fearful disaster occurred--one in\r\nits own way unparalleled in magnitude during the whole Peninsular\r\nWar. The door of the great magazine in the castle had been opened,\r\nin order to allow of the sending out of a convoy of powder to the\r\nsouthern ramparts, where the artillery had been hard at work all\r\nday. A leaky barrel was handed out, which left a trail of powder\r\nbehind it along the ground; it was being fixed to the saddle of a\r\npack-ass when a French bomb fell in the courtyard of the castle. In\r\nbursting, the bomb chanced to ignite the train; the spark ran along\r\nit and exploded another barrel at the door of the magazine, which\r\nwas still open[317]. This mischance fired the whole store, and\r\nin two seconds the castle, the cathedral at its side, and the whole\r\ncentral portion of the town had been blasted out of existence. ‘The\r\nearth trembled,’ wrote a French eye-witness, ‘and we saw an immense\r\nwhirlwind of fire and smoke rise from the middle of the place. It was\r\nlike the bursting of a volcano--one of the things that I can never\r\nforget after twenty-six years. Enormous blocks of stone were hurled\r\ninto the trenches, where they killed and wounded some of our men.\r\nGuns of heavy calibre were lifted from the ramparts and hurled down\r\nfar outside them. When the smoke cleared off, a great part of Almeida\r\nhad disappeared, and the rest was a heap of débris[318].’ Five\r\nhundred of the garrison perished, including nearly every man of the\r\ntwo hundred artillerymen who were serving the guns on the front of\r\nattack. Some inhabitants were killed, but not many, for the majority\r\nhad taken refuge in the casemates when the bombardment began that\r\nmorning. It was the unfortunate soldiers who were manning the walls\r\nthat suffered.\r\n\r\n  [317] This version of the cause of the disaster is given\r\n  by Soriano da Luz (iii. 73) from the mouth of an artillery\r\n  officer (one José Moreira) who had it from the only man in the\r\n  castle-yard who escaped. This soldier, seeing the train fired,\r\n  jumped into an oven-hole which lay behind him, and chanced not to\r\n  be killed.\r\n\r\n  [318] Sprünglin’s _Journal_, pp. 444-5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMBAT OF THE COA. JULY 24TH, 1810.]\r\n\r\nFearing that the French might seize the moment for an escalade,\r\nGeneral Cox ran to the ramparts and, assisted by a Portuguese\r\nartillery officer, loaded and fired into the trenches some of the few\r\nguns on the south front which were not disabled. He turned out the\r\nwhole garrison, and kept them under arms that night, lying behind\r\nthe walls in expectation of an assault which never came. The morning\r\nlight enabled him to realize the full extent of the disaster; the\r\nbastions and curtains had suffered little, the shell, so to speak,\r\nof the town was still intact, and the casemates had stood firm, but\r\neverything within the enceinte was wrecked. Only five houses in\r\nthe place had kept their roofs: the castle was a deep hole, like\r\nthe crater of a volcano: the streets were absolutely blocked with\r\nruins, so that there was no going from place to place save along the\r\nramparts.\r\n\r\nThere were still 4,000 men under arms; but the officer commanding\r\nthe artillery reported that thirty-nine barrels of powder, and a few\r\nhundred rounds in the small expense-magazines on the ramparts, were\r\nall that had escaped the explosion. That is to say, there was not\r\npowder in the place to keep up a reply for one day to the batteries\r\nof the besieger. The infantry had 600,000 cartridges in their\r\nregimental stores (150 rounds per man) but that was of no use for\r\nthe heavy guns. Moreover, more than half the gunners had perished in\r\nthe disaster of the previous night--only 200 were left to man nearly\r\n100 guns that were still serviceable. It was clear that Almeida was\r\ndoomed, since it could not defend itself without powder: but there\r\nwas a chance that Wellington, whose outposts must have heard and\r\nseen the explosion, might think it worth while to dash forward and\r\nendeavour to save the garrison during the next twenty-four hours.\r\nTherefore Cox resolved to protract his resistance as long as was\r\npossible, to give his chief the option of fighting if he should so\r\nplease. But the defence could not be prolonged for more than a day or\r\ntwo at the most.\r\n\r\nAt nine on the morning of the 27th Masséna sent in his aide de\r\ncamp Pelet to demand the surrender of the fortress. Cox had him\r\nblindfolded, and taken into a casemate for their interview, so that\r\nhe might not be able to judge of the awful effects of the explosion.\r\nThe usual haggling followed--the French officer threatened that\r\nthe place should be escaladed at once, and the garrison put to the\r\nsword. The governor replied that his walls were intact, that he\r\ncould still defend himself, and that the ‘deplorable accident’ had\r\nnot appreciably diminished his resisting power[319]. But he finally\r\nconsented to send out an officer to the French camp to negotiate for\r\nterms. All this was merely done to gain time, and the semaphore on\r\nthe western ramparts was signalling desperate messages to Wellington\r\nall the morning.\r\n\r\n  [319] There is a good account of this interview in Sprünglin’s\r\n  _Journal_, p. 445, the diarist having accompanied Pelet into the\r\n  town.\r\n\r\nCox’s attempt to gain time was fruitless, for a reason that he had\r\nnot foreseen. The garrison was hopelessly demoralized, knew that\r\nit must surrender, and did not see why it should expose itself to\r\nanother day’s bombardment for a lost cause. During the conference\r\nin the casemate General d’Alorna and other Portuguese officers on\r\nMasséna’s staff came out of the trenches, and boldly presented\r\nthemselves at the foot of the walls, calling to their compatriots\r\nabove and beseeching them to accept the good terms offered, and\r\nnot to risk their lives for Wellington, who would abandon them\r\njust as he had abandoned Herrasti at Ciudad Rodrigo. The officers\r\non the ramparts ought to have driven the renegades away, by shots\r\nif necessary; but, far from doing so, they entered into long\r\nconversation with them and approved their arguments. D’Alorna\r\nrecognized some old acquaintances among the regulars, and pledged his\r\nword to them that an assault was imminent, and that they were doomed\r\nif they made any resistance. What was still more unlucky for Cox was\r\nthat the officer whom he sent out to the French camp to treat, Major\r\nBarreiros of the artillery, was one of those who were most convinced\r\nthat further defence was fruitless; he divulged the hopeless state of\r\nthe place to the Marshal, and bade him press his attack without fear,\r\nfor the garrison would not fight. He himself remained at the French\r\nhead quarters, and did not return to Almeida. Masséna, therefore,\r\nsent back a blank refusal of all Cox’s demands and conditions, and\r\nordered the bombardment to recommence at seven in the evening, while\r\napproaches were thrown out from the second parallel towards the\r\nramparts. A feeble musketry fire alone replied.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of the bombardment speedily brought matters inside the\r\nplace to a head. A deputation of Portuguese officers, headed by\r\nBernardo Da Costa, the second in command, visited Cox and informed\r\nhim that further resistance was madness, and that if he did not at\r\nonce hoist the white flag they would open the gates to the enemy. The\r\nGovernor was forced to yield, and capitulated at eleven o’clock on\r\nthe night of the 27th. Masséna granted him the terms that the regular\r\ntroops should be sent as prisoners to France, while the three militia\r\nregiments should be allowed to disperse to their homes, on giving\r\ntheir parole not to serve again during the war.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th the garrison marched out, still 4,000\r\nstrong, its total loss during the siege having been some 600--nearly\r\nall destroyed in the explosion. The French had lost fifty-eight\r\nkilled and 320 wounded during the operations. The capitulation was\r\nno sooner ratified than it was violated: instead of dismissing\r\nthe militia and marching off the regulars towards France, Masséna\r\nkept them together, and set the renegades d’Alorna and Pamplona to\r\ntempt them to enter the French service. The officers were promised\r\nconfirmation of their rank, the men were invited to compare the\r\nrelative advantages of prison and of joining the victorious side\r\nand keeping their liberty. The arguments of the traitors seemed to\r\nprevail; almost the whole of the regulars and 600 of the militia\r\nsignified their consent to enlist with the enemy. The rest of the\r\nmilitia were turned loose, but d’Alorna was able to organize a\r\nbrigade of three battalions to serve the Emperor as the ‘Second\r\nPortuguese Legion[320].’ But the intentions of these docile recruits\r\nwere quite other than Masséna had supposed. They had changed their\r\nallegiance merely in order to escape being sent to France, and while\r\nleft unguarded during the next three days, absconded in bands of 200\r\nor 300 at a time, officers and all, and kept presenting themselves\r\nat Silveira’s and Wellington’s outposts, for a week. The French,\r\nundeceived too late, disarmed the few men remaining in the camp, who\r\nwere packed off to France, to rejoin Cox and the half-dozen officers\r\nwho had loyally refused to accept d’Alorna’s offers[321]. Wellington\r\nhad been somewhat alarmed when the first news of the adhesion of the\r\ngarrison to the French cause reached him, fearing that it implied\r\nserious disaffection in the whole Portuguese army[322]. He was\r\nsoon undeceived on this point, as the troops gradually streamed in\r\nto his camp[323]. But he was then seized with grave doubts as to\r\nwhether he could, consistently with military honour, accept the\r\nservice of these perjured but patriotic people. ‘It was well enough\r\nfor the private men, but highly disgraceful to the character of\r\nthe officers[324],’ he observed, and was pondering what should be\r\ndone, and proposing to cashier the officers, when he received a\r\nproclamation from the Regency approving the conduct of the deserters\r\nand restoring them to their place in the army. Finally he resolved\r\nthat, since Masséna had obviously broken the capitulation by his\r\naction, it might be held that it was not binding on the prisoners,\r\nand ordered the 24th Regiment to be re-formed at its head quarters\r\nat Braganza. The militia he dismissed to their homes, on the scruple\r\nthat the French had let some, though not all of them, go free after\r\nthe capitulation[325]. There remained the problem of what was to be\r\ndone with the Portuguese officers who had played a treacherous part\r\non the 27th, especially Barreiros, the negotiator who had betrayed\r\nthe state of the town to Masséna, and Da Costa, who had headed the\r\nmutinous deputation to Cox, which forced him to surrender. Finally,\r\ntheir names were included with those of the officers who had served\r\non Masséna’s Portuguese staff during the campaign, in a great\r\nindictment placed before a special commission on traitors (called a\r\n_Junta de Inconfidencia_), which sat at Lisbon during the autumn. All\r\nfrom d’Alorna downwards were declared guilty of high treason, and\r\ncondemned to death on December 22, 1810, but only two were caught and\r\nexecuted--João de Mascarenhas, one of d’Alorna’s aides de camp, and\r\nDa Costa, the lieutenant-governor of Almeida. The former was captured\r\nby the Ordenança while carrying Masséna’s dispatches in 1810, and the\r\nlatter was apprehended in 1812; Mascarenhas died by the garotte, Da\r\nCosta was shot. Of the others, some never returned to Portugal, the\r\nothers were pardoned at various dates between 1816 and 1820[326].\r\n\r\n  [320] The First Portuguese Legion, which served against Austria\r\n  in 1809, was composed of the troops drafted out of the Peninsula\r\n  by Junot in 1808 during his domination at Lisbon.\r\n\r\n  [321] D’Urban’s diary reports that 450 men and 18 officers of the\r\n  24th of the Line came in between the 2nd and 4th of September to\r\n  Silveira’s outposts; a still larger number reached Wellington’s.\r\n\r\n  [322] D’Urban has most gloomy remarks on the subject in his\r\n  diary, under the date Aug. 30.\r\n\r\n  [323] To Chas. Stuart, from Celorico, Aug. 31.\r\n\r\n  [324] To Chas. Stuart, from Celorico, Sept. 11.\r\n\r\n  [325] Wellington to Masséna, Sept. 24. ‘Votre excellence\r\n  s’est engagée que les officiers et les soldats de la milice\r\n  retourneraient chez eux: malgré cet engagement vous en avez\r\n  retenu 7 officiers et 200 soldats de chaque régiment, pour en\r\n  faire un corps de pionniers. La capitulation d’Almeida est donc\r\n  nulle, et je suis en droit d’en faire ce que je voudrais. Mais je\r\n  puis vous assurer qu’il n’y a pas un seul soldat de la milice qui\r\n  était en Almeida au service.’\r\n\r\n  [326] For details of all this, including the curious terms of\r\n  the Portuguese sentence for high treason, see Soriano da Luz,\r\n  iii. 80-109, and 719-22. The attempts to exculpate Barreiros seem\r\n  inadequate. Da Costa was shot, not for treason, but for cowardice\r\n  and mutiny.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Almeida, the British army had been held in a\r\nposition somewhat less advanced and more concentrated than that\r\nwhich it had occupied in July. Wellington had brought back his head\r\nquarters from Alverca to Celorico, where he had the Light Division\r\nunder his hand. A few miles behind, on the high-road running down\r\nthe south bank of the Mondego, was the 1st Division, at Villa\r\nCortes. Picton and the 3rd Division had been drawn back from Pinhel\r\nto Carapichina, but Cole and the 4th remained firm at Guarda. The\r\nPortuguese brigades of Coleman and A. Campbell were at Pinhanços,\r\nthat of Pack at Jegua. The whole of the cavalry had come up from the\r\nrear to join the brigade that had recently operated under Craufurd’s\r\norders. They now lay in a thick line of six regiments from in front\r\nof Guarda, through Alverca and Freixadas to Lamegal. Thus the whole\r\narmy was concentrated on a short front of fifteen miles, covering the\r\nwatershed between the Coa and the Mondego, and the bifurcation of the\r\nroads which start from Celorico, down the two banks of the last-named\r\nriver. The French held back, close to Almeida, with a strong advance\r\nguard at Pinhel, and occasionally raided the low country towards the\r\nDouro, in the direction of Villanova de Fosboa and Castel Rodrigo.\r\nAbout August 19 Wellington moved forward a day’s march, the front of\r\nhis infantry columns being pushed up to Alverca and Freixadas, on a\r\nfalse rumour that Masséna was leaving the 6th Corps unsupported at\r\nAlmeida, and had drawn back Junot into the plains of Leon. If this\r\nhad been the case, Wellington intended to make a push to relieve\r\nthe besieged fortress. But he soon discovered that the report was\r\nbaseless, and that the 8th Corps was still on the Azava and the\r\nAgueda, wherefore he halted, and was still lying twelve miles in\r\nfront of Celorico when the noise of the explosion at Almeida, and the\r\ncessation of fire on the next day, betrayed the fact that the place\r\nhad fallen, and that there was no longer any reason for maintaining\r\na forward position. On the night of the 28th, therefore, the whole\r\narmy was drawn back once more to the strong line between Guarda and\r\nCelorico, and arrangements were made for a further retreat, in case\r\nthe French should follow up the capture of Almeida by an instant and\r\ngeneral advance. Masséna seemed at first likely to make this move:\r\non September 2 a brigade of infantry and 1,200 horse drove in the\r\nBritish cavalry outposts to Maçal de Chão only five miles in front\r\nof Celorico. Looking upon this as the commencement of the serious\r\ninvasion of Portugal, Wellington sent back his infantry to Villa\r\nCortes, Pinhanços, and Moita, far down the high-road on the south of\r\nthe Mondego, and bade Cole draw in the 4th Division from Guarda to\r\nSan Martinho, under the north side of the Serra da Estrella. Only\r\ncavalry were left at, and in front of, Celorico and Guarda. This\r\nretreat shows that Wellington was fully convinced that the French\r\nwould advance along the high-road to the south of the Mondego, where\r\nhe intended to stand at bay on the Alva, behind the entrenchments of\r\nPonte de Murcella.\r\n\r\nThe main point of interest at this moment was the movements of\r\nthe French 2nd Corps, which still lay in cantonments at Zarza and\r\nCoria in front of Hill. Guarda being no longer held in force, it\r\nwas clear that Hill could not safely join the main army by the\r\nroad Atalaya-Fundão-Guarda, if Reynier moved up by the Pass of\r\nPerales to Alfayates and Sabugal. Wellington began an anxious daily\r\ncorrespondence with Hill, giving him a new line of march by Sobreira\r\nFormosa, Villa d’el Rei and Espinhal, for his junction, but ordering\r\nhim to be sure that he did not move till Reynier had thoroughly\r\ncommitted himself to the transference of his whole force to the north\r\nof the Sierra de Gata. For it would be disastrous if feints should\r\ninduce the British detaining force to leave Villa Velha and Abrantes\r\nuncovered, and Reynier should turn out to have selected them as his\r\nobjective, and to be meditating an invasion along the Castello Branco\r\nline[327]. It was even possible, though not likely, that Masséna\r\nmight bring up the 6th and 8th Corps to join Reynier, instead of\r\nbringing Reynier across the mountains to join them[328]. But every\r\ncontingency had to be provided against, the unlikely ones as well as\r\nthe likely. As a corollary to Hill’s march, that of Leith had also\r\nto be arranged; he must wait at Thomar till it was certain that the\r\n2nd Corps had moved, but the moment that certainty was obtained, must\r\nmarch for Ponte de Murcella, and join the main army, if the French\r\nhad gone north, but support Hill on the Castello Branco road if they\r\nhad taken the other, and less probable, course.\r\n\r\n  [327] See Wellington to Hill of Aug. 31, Sept. 1, Sept. 4, Sept.\r\n  6. The Commander-in-Chief was much worried by a false rumour that\r\n  Reynier was already in force at Sabugal on Aug. 31, and then by\r\n  an equally false one that the whole 2nd Corps had marched south\r\n  towards the Tagus, and was about to cross it near Alcantara (see\r\n  the letter to La Romana of Sept. 6). As a matter of fact, Reynier\r\n  made no definite move from Zarza till Sept. 10, though he had\r\n  made feints, in both the directions indicated, with small forces.\r\n\r\n  [328] That this possibility was in Wellington’s mind is shown\r\n  by the letter to La Romana of Sept. 6, from Gouvea, in which he\r\n  writes, ‘Vous aurez appris les mouvements du corps de Regnier de\r\n  la part du Général Hill. Ou l’ennemi va faire le mouvement sur\r\n  notre droite (dont je vous ai écrit) ou il va faire le siège de\r\n  Badajoz. On dit que du canon a passé d’Almeida à Sabugal, et de\r\n  là vers Regnier, mais je ne sais pas si c’est vrai, ou si c’est\r\n  du canon de siège.... Vous savez ce qu’il faut faire si on se met\r\n  entre nous deux, en passant le Tage à Villa Velha, ou au-dessous\r\n  de la jonction.’\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON ALMEIDA AND THE BRIDGE OF THE COA\r\n\r\nThe small circular town of Almeida has never recovered from the\r\ndisaster of 1810. The population does not fill up the area within\r\nthe walls: open spaces are frequent, and some of the more important\r\nbuildings--especially the old palace of the governor--stand in ruins.\r\nOthers show solid seventeenth- or eighteenth-century masonry on\r\nthe ground floor, and flimsy modern repairs above, where the upper\r\nstories were blown away by the explosion. The cathedral has never\r\nbeen properly rebuilt, and is a mere fragment. The railway passes\r\ntwelve miles south of Almeida, so that the place has had no chance\r\nof recovery, and remains in a state of decay. The walls stand just\r\nas they were left after Wellington’s hasty repairs in 1811. The vast\r\nbomb-proof shelters repeatedly mentioned in narratives of the siege\r\nare still visible, damp but intact. The surrounding country-side is a\r\nlow, rolling, treeless upland--the edge of the vast plains of Leon.\r\nIt contrasts very strongly with the hilly and picturesque scenery\r\nthat is reached when once the Coa has been passed.\r\n\r\nFrom Almeida the ground slopes down sharply to the place of\r\nCraufurd’s celebrated skirmish. The town is not visible after the\r\nfirst mile of the descent towards the deep-sunk gorge through which\r\nthe Coa cuts its way. The high-road is very bad for artillery, being\r\nsteep, filled with great stones, and in many places shut in by high\r\nbanks, which tower above it and make it narrow. The sharp turn at the\r\nend, where it descends to the river with a sudden twist, must have\r\nbeen specially tiresome to a force with cavalry and guns, compelled\r\nto a hasty retreat. All the slopes about the road are cut up into\r\nsmall fields by high walls of undressed stone, without mortar,\r\nsuch as are seen on Cotswold. The bridge is not visible till the\r\ntraveller approaching from Almeida has got down to the level of the\r\nriver: it is completely masked by the high fir-clad knoll described\r\nin the text, so long as he is descending the slope above. From the\r\npoint where the road swerves aside, to avoid this knoll, there is\r\na rough goat-track down to the still invisible bridge, but this is\r\nnot available for guns, horses, or _formed_ infantry, only for men\r\nscrambling individually.\r\n\r\nThe two-arched bridge is seventy yards long; it crosses the Coa\r\ndiagonally, with a curious twist in the middle, where there is a\r\nlittle monument recording the reparation of the structure by John\r\nVI, in the days after the war was over. There is no mention of\r\nCraufurd’s fight in the inscription--only a laudation of the King.\r\nThe bridge crosses the river at a sort of gorge--the place where the\r\nrocks on the two sides come nearest. Hence the stream runs under\r\nit very fiercely, being constricted to far less than its normal\r\nbreadth. Up-stream the channel broadens and the passage looks much\r\nless formidable, but for some distance on each side of the bridge the\r\nriver is very rapid, darting between rocks and boulders. The little\r\ncorner where the few French who passed the bridge found a small angle\r\nof dead-ground can be easily identified. It was just to their right\r\nafter crossing. All the rest of the ground on the west bank could\r\nbe thoroughly searched by the British guns, which were placed a few\r\nhundred yards up the road on the left hand, as well as by the fire of\r\nthe infantry ensconced among rocks and boulders above the bridge.\r\n\r\nOf the French attacking force during the early part of the skirmish,\r\nthose who were on their left, nearest the river and opposite the\r\n52nd, had far easier ground to cover than those on the right,\r\nopposite the 43rd. It is not so high or rough, and less cut up by\r\nstone walls. Hence the stress on the 52nd ought to have been the\r\nheavier--yet they lost only 22 men to the 129 of the 43rd. The damage\r\nto the latter must have been caused partly when the cavalry got in\r\namong them, just as the retreat began, partly when they stormed the\r\nknoll to cover the retreat of the 52nd.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the fight is most picturesque on a small scale--one of\r\nthe prettiest corners in Portugal, all rock, fir-trees, and rushing\r\nwater.--[Notes made on the spot on April 14, 1906.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XX\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN THE EAST AND SOUTH OF SPAIN DURING THE SPRING AND\r\nSUMMER OF 1810\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSUCHET AND AUGEREAU IN ARAGON, VALENCIA, AND CATALONIA, MARCH-JULY\r\n1810\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Suchet had successfully pacified the plains of Aragon during\r\nthe autumn of 1809, and though Augereau in the last month of that\r\nyear had received the surrender of the much-enduring garrison of\r\nGerona, the position of the French in North-Eastern Spain was still\r\nfar from satisfactory. It was not yet possible for the 3rd and the\r\n7th Corps to combine their operations. While the broad strip of\r\nterritory in Western Catalonia reaching from the foot of the Pyrenees\r\nto the sea--whose places of strength were Lerida, Tarragona, and\r\nTortosa--still remained intact, Augereau and Suchet could still\r\ncommunicate only by the circuitous route through France: a letter\r\nfrom Saragossa to Barcelona took a fortnight or more to arrive at\r\nits destination. It was high time that they should endeavour to get\r\ninto touch with each other, by cutting through the Spanish line\r\nof defence. Both of the corps-commanders had now a comparatively\r\nfree hand, and could assemble a considerable force for offensive\r\noperations. Suchet’s position was the happier: he had no Spanish army\r\nopposed to him at the moment. His only opponents were--to the West\r\nthe bold guerrillero Mina the Younger on the borders of Navarre; to\r\nthe South Villacampa with the dilapidated remains of his band on\r\nthe side of the Sierra de Albaracin and Molina; and to the East the\r\ngovernor of Lerida, who kept a flying force under Colonel Perena on\r\nfoot between the Cinca and the Segre, for the encouragement of the\r\ninsurgents of Eastern Aragon. None of these three opponents could\r\ndo any serious mischief to the 3rd Corps, which had risen by the New\r\nYear of 1810 to a strength of 24,000 men[329], now that its drafts\r\nfrom France were beginning to arrive. Mina was the most tiresome\r\nof the three: he was a young man of untiring energy, and kept the\r\nborders of Navarre in a perpetual ferment, till he was finally put\r\ndown by mere force of numbers. For while Suchet sent a number of\r\ncolumns under General Harispe to hunt him, Lagrange’s division of\r\nthe newly arrived 8th Corps came down from the side of Pampeluna,\r\nand swept the valleys of the Arga and the Aragon from the other\r\nquarter. Pursued from one refuge to another by 12,000 men, Mina ended\r\nby bidding his followers disperse. He did not appear again as a\r\ncombatant till the 8th Corps had passed on into Castile in the month\r\nof February 1810.\r\n\r\n  [329] Suchet in his _Mémoires_ (i. 77) says that in Jan. 1810 his\r\n  corps was only 20,000 strong. But the imperial muster-rolls show\r\n  that it had 23,000 _présents sous les armes_, besides 1,819 men\r\n  in hospital and 973 detached, in that month.\r\n\r\nVillacampa and Perena being very weak adversaries, Suchet could now\r\ndispose of the greater part of his corps for offensive operations.\r\nTwo lines of attack were open to him: the more natural and obvious\r\none was to attack Lerida or Tortosa, while Augereau and the 7th\r\nCorps moved against them from the other side. This was Suchet’s own\r\nintention, and he had received dispatches from Paris which approved\r\nof the plan. But another objective was pointed out to him from\r\nanother quarter. It will be remembered that while King Joseph and\r\nSoult were planning the details of their Andalusian expedition, one\r\nof the schemes which they discussed was the use of the 3rd Corps\r\nas a flanking detachment to cover their attack on Seville[330]:\r\nit was to march on Valencia while Mortier marched on Badajoz. The\r\nplan was rejected in favour of the direct frontal march against the\r\npasses of the Sierra Morena. Nevertheless, when the defiles had been\r\npassed, and the King had entered Cordova in triumph, he recurred to\r\nhis original scheme, and on January 27 Soult sent orders to Suchet\r\ndirecting him to make a dash at Valencia, and assuring him that the\r\ndemoralization of the Spaniards was so great that he would probably\r\nenter the city without meeting with much resistance. Similar orders,\r\nas we have already seen, were sent to Ney, who was directed at the\r\nsame moment to make himself master of Ciudad Rodrigo[331], which\r\nSoult and the King imagined to be likely to surrender at the first\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n  [330] See p. 123 of this volume.\r\n\r\n  [331] See p. 222.\r\n\r\nSuchet, though doubting (as he says) the wisdom of the plan of\r\ncampaign imposed upon him, prepared to obey, and concentrated 8,000\r\nmen, consisting of Laval’s division and half that of Musnier, at\r\nTeruel, on the borders of Valencia, while Habert, with six battalions\r\nmore, was to move in a separate parallel column from Alcañiz, and to\r\nstrike down on to the sea-coast of Valencia by way of Morella. On\r\ntheir way to Teruel some of Laval’s columns made a side-stroke at\r\nVillacampa, and drove off his band into the mountains of New Castile.\r\n\r\nThe march on Valencia had already begun, when Suchet received at\r\nTeruel, on March 1, the dispatch from the Emperor which announced to\r\nhim that the kingdom of Aragon had been made an independent ‘military\r\ngovernment’ under his charge[332], and that he was for the future to\r\ntake no orders from Madrid, but to seek all his instructions from\r\nParis. By the same dispatch Suchet was informed that the Emperor\r\napproved of the plan for directing the 3rd Corps against Lerida and\r\nthe rear of Catalonia which he had himself always advocated. But\r\nsince Habert’s column had already disappeared in the mountains, and\r\ncould not be recalled, and since his own advanced guard had actually\r\ncrossed the borders of Valencia, Suchet thought that it was now too\r\nlate to turn back, and that he must endeavour to carry out Soult’s\r\norders, even though they were now countermanded by the Emperor.\r\nAccordingly he marched by Sarrion, on the road which leads from\r\nTeruel to Segorbe, and from thence to Murviedro on the Valencian\r\ncoast, where Habert was to join him.\r\n\r\n  [332] See p. 200.\r\n\r\nThe force opposed to Suchet was that Valencian army which the\r\ngovernor--or rather the dictator--José Caro had so persistently\r\nrefused to lend to Blake in the preceding autumn for the relief\r\nof Gerona. It was about 12,000 strong at the moment, and as some\r\nnine months had elapsed since the disaster of Belchite, where the\r\nValencian troops had fared so badly, the regiments had been recruited\r\nup to their old strength, and had been thoroughly reorganized and\r\nre-equipped. Nevertheless, Caro did not wish to risk them in the\r\nopen field, and, when Suchet’s approach was reported to him, ordered\r\nthe troops to prepare to retreat within the walls of the city of\r\nValencia, which had been so successfully defended against Moncey\r\ntwo years before. He was probably right in his decision: having no\r\ngreat superiority of numbers over the French invading columns, he\r\nwould have been risking over much if he had offered battle on the\r\nfrontier, even in an advantageous position. Behind the fortifications\r\nof Valencia, which had been improved and enlarged during the last two\r\nyears, he could at least be certain of making a long and formidable\r\nresistance. If the enemy appeared without a great battering-train,\r\nand unprepared for a regular siege, the garrison would be absolutely\r\nsafe. Accordingly, Caro sent out only a single brigade to observe and\r\nretard Suchet’s advance: this force, assisted by some armed peasants,\r\ntried to hold the defile of Alventosa against the French (March 4),\r\nbut was beaten out of the position with ease, lost four guns, and\r\nretired by Segorbe and Murviedro on to Valencia, without offering\r\nfurther resistance. Suchet, following in the wake of the Spanish\r\ndetachment, reached Murviedro on March 5, and there met Habert,\r\nwhose march by Morella and Castellon-de-la-Plana had been absolutely\r\nunopposed.\r\n\r\nA day later the French appeared in front of the fortifications of\r\nValencia. Having surveyed the outworks, and summoned the place in\r\nvain, Suchet found that there was no more to be done. His bolt was\r\nshot: the city intended to defend itself: it was full of troops,\r\nand the whole population had been armed. Caro had given notice that\r\nthe defence was to be conducted in the style of Saragossa, and as\r\na foretaste of his intentions court-martialled and hanged several\r\npersons who were accused of being traitors[333]. After lying four\r\ndays in front of Valencia, Suchet marched off again on the night of\r\nMarch 10-11, having convinced himself that he had been sent on a\r\nfool’s errand by Soult and King Joseph. For the expedition had only\r\nbeen undertaken on the hypothesis that the enemy was demoralized\r\nand ready to surrender--which was clearly not the case. No siege\r\ntrain had been brought, and without heavy artillery Valencia was\r\nimpregnable. The retreat of the French was hastened by the fact\r\nthat their communications with Aragon had already been cut off.\r\nVillacampa, undismayed by his defeat in February, had returned to\r\nthe front the moment that the invading columns had passed on to\r\nthe Valencian coast. He had blockaded the garrison of Teruel, cut\r\noff two small columns which were moving in its neighbourhood, and\r\ncaptured four guns and some 300 prisoners. At the same moment, though\r\nSuchet was unaware of the fact, Colonel Perena, with a detachment\r\nfrom Lerida, had made a demonstration against Monzon, and when the\r\ngarrison of Eastern Aragon concentrated to defend it, had fallen on\r\nFraga and burnt the bridge there--the only crossing of the Cinca\r\nwhich was in French hands. Mina, too, warned of the departure of the\r\nmain body of the 3rd Corps for the South, had reassembled some of his\r\nlevies, and begun to render the road from Saragossa to Pampeluna once\r\nmore unsafe.\r\n\r\n  [333] Whether the Conde de Pozoblanco and the other persons\r\n  executed were really traitors is very doubtful. Napier takes them\r\n  as such (ii. 303), Suchet denies it (p. 100); Schepeler says\r\n  (iii. 627) that proclamations of King Joseph and treasonable\r\n  letters were found in the Count’s house. Toreno (ii. 124) remains\r\n  doubtful, but points out that Caro and Pozoblanco were old\r\n  enemies, and thinks that, at any rate, there was personal spite\r\n  in the matter.\r\n\r\nSuchet, therefore, on withdrawing from Valencia, found plenty of\r\noccupation awaiting him in Aragon. Villacampa was once more chased\r\ninto the wilds of the Sierra de Albaracin: and several columns\r\nwere detached in pursuit of Mina. This time the young partisan was\r\nunfortunate--he was caught between one of Suchet’s detachments and\r\na party sent out by the governor of Navarre, and taken prisoner on\r\nMarch 31, with some scores of his followers. His place, however, was\r\ntaken ere long by his uncle Espoz y Mina, who rallied the remnant of\r\nthe guerrilleros of North-Western Aragon, and continued the struggle\r\nwith an energy as great, and a success far greater, than that of his\r\nnephew.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the months of February and March had been wasted, so\r\nfar as the 3rd Corps was concerned, and it was not till April that\r\nSuchet was able to take in hand the enterprise which he himself had\r\napproved, and to which the Emperor had now given his consent--the\r\nsiege of Lerida. A few weeks after his return to Saragossa he\r\nreceived from Paris two imperial letters denouncing his late\r\ncampaign as presumptuous, objectless, and altogether deserving of\r\nhigh condemnation[334].\r\n\r\n  [334] Dated from Compiègne on April 9 and April 20. See\r\n  _Correspondance_, xx. 284 and 299.\r\n\r\nWhile the Valencian expedition had been in progress Marshal Augereau\r\nhad been trying his hand at the Catalan problems which Verdier and\r\nSt. Cyr had found so puzzling. His luck had been bad--and his faults\r\nhad been many--for of all the commanders-in-chief who successively\r\nendeavoured to subjugate the untameable principality he was decidedly\r\nthe least capable. When Gerona fell, the main body of his army was\r\nlet loose for operations in the open field. But Verdier’s divisions,\r\non whom the burden of the siege work had fallen, were in much too\r\ndilapidated a condition for active service[335]. Leaving them\r\nto recover their strength and gather up their convalescents, in\r\ncantonments between Figueras and Gerona, Augereau moved southwards\r\nin January, at the head of the troops of Souham and Pino, whose two\r\ndivisions still counted 12,000 bayonets with the eagles, though\r\nthey left behind them 5,000 sick in the hospitals of Figueras and\r\nPerpignan.\r\n\r\n  [335] In January, Verdier’s French and Westphalian divisions\r\n  could only show 6,000 men in line and 7,000 in hospital. Muster\r\n  roll of Jan. 15 in the _Archives Nationaux_.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal’s main duty at this moment was to clear the road from\r\nFigueras to Barcelona, which the Spanish fortress of Gerona had so\r\neffectually blocked during the whole year 1809. All further advances\r\nwere suspended till this operation should have been completed, by\r\nthe Emperor’s special orders. Duhesme, indeed, isolated in Barcelona\r\nwith some 6,000 men, communicating with France only by sea, and\r\nsurrounded by a discontented population, which was reduced to\r\nsemi-starvation by the blockade kept up by the British fleet, was in\r\na perilous condition. There had been many who thought that if Blake,\r\nin October 1809, had marched against Barcelona instead of trying to\r\nthrow succours into Gerona, he would have forced Augereau to abandon\r\nthe siege of the latter place. For Duhesme would have been in such\r\ndanger, since he was neither strong enough to fight in the open nor\r\nto man efficiently the immense circuit of the walls of Barcelona,\r\nthat Augereau might probably have judged that it was better to save\r\nthe capital of Catalonia than to continue the interminable blockade\r\nof the smaller town that was holding out so obstinately against\r\nhim. Be this as it may, Augereau set Souham’s and Pino’s columns\r\non the march early in January 1810, after having first executed at\r\ntheir head a sort of _battue_ of the _somatenes_ of the mountains\r\naround Gerona, as far as Ripol and Campredon. His progress was a\r\nreign of terror: he had issued on December 28th a proclamation\r\nstating that all irregulars taken with arms in their hands were to\r\nbe treated as simple highway robbers, and hung without any form of\r\ntrial[336]. He was as good as his word, and all the prisoners taken\r\nby the flying columns of Souham and Pino were suspended on a line\r\nof gallows erected on the high-road between Gerona and Figueras.\r\nThese atrocities turned the war in Catalonia into a struggle even\r\nmore ferocious than that of 1809, for the natives, very naturally,\r\nretaliated upon every French straggler that they caught, and the\r\nSpanish regular officers had great difficulty in saving the lives\r\neven of large bodies who had laid down their arms upon formal terms\r\nof surrender.\r\n\r\n  [336] The text of this bloodthirsty document may be found\r\n  in Belmas, i. 429. There are details of its execution in\r\n  Barckhausen, who mentions that several priests were among the\r\n  victims.\r\n\r\nTwo roads lead from Gerona and the valley of the Ter to\r\nBarcelona--that by Vich and that by Hostalrich. They unite near\r\nGranollers, twenty miles outside Barcelona. Augereau marched with the\r\nItalian division of Pino by the second road, while he sent Souham by\r\nthe other. Both met with opposition: the small castle of Hostalrich\r\nwas still held by the Spaniards--it was the only fortified place in\r\ncentral Catalonia which was now in their hands, and commanded, though\r\nit did not actually block, the main road to Barcelona. On arriving\r\nbefore it, the Marshal ordered Mazzuchelli’s Italian brigade to form\r\nthe siege, trusting that the place would fall in a few days; but\r\nfinding the resistance more serious than he had expected, he finally\r\ncontinued his march, with the remainder of the Italian division,\r\ntowards Granollers and Barcelona. He had ordered Duhesme to come out\r\nto meet him at the former place, with as many of his troops as he\r\ncould spare from garrison duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATALONIA]\r\n\r\nSouham meanwhile, on the eastern road, had entered Vich on January\r\n11. He found that it had just been evacuated by the main body of the\r\nSpanish Army of Catalonia, whose head quarters had been maintained\r\nin that town all through the later months of the siege of Gerona.\r\nThis force, still numbering about 7,000 men, was no longer under the\r\ncommand of its old general. Blake had resigned at Christmastide,\r\nafter a lively altercation with the Junta of Catalonia, who laid the\r\nblame for the fall of Gerona on his shoulders, while he maintained\r\nthat they were to blame for not having ordered the general _levée\r\nen masse_ of the principality at an earlier date[337]. The command\r\nthen passed in quick succession to the two senior general officers of\r\nthe Catalan army, first to the Marquis of Portago, and then, after\r\nhe had fallen ill, to General Garcia Conde, Governor of Lerida. But\r\nthese interim commanders-in-chief were replaced in a few weeks by a\r\nyounger and much more active leader, Henry O’Donnell--the man who had\r\nconducted the second convoy for Gerona, and had cut his way out of\r\nthe place with such splendid address and resolution. He had only just\r\nbeen raised to the rank of Major-General, yet was now entrusted by\r\nthe Central Junta with the control of the entire army of Catalonia.\r\nAs he was setting to work to reorganize it, Souham arrived in front\r\nof his head quarters. Judging it unwise to offer battle at the head\r\nof demoralized troops, O’Donnell evacuated Vich, and fell back to the\r\nmountains above it. Souham followed him with an advanced guard as far\r\nas the pass called the Col de Suspina, where the Spaniard suddenly\r\nturned upon the pursuing force, and hurled it back with loss upon the\r\nmain body of the division (January 12, 1810). He refused, however,\r\nto face Souham next day, and retreated towards Manresa; thereupon\r\nthe French general also turned back, thinking it profitless to leave\r\nthe Vich-Barcelona road, and to plunge into the hills in pursuit of\r\nan evasive enemy. He ended by making his way across the mountains to\r\njoin the Marshal.\r\n\r\n  [337] See pp. 62, 63 of this volume.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Augereau, with Pino’s Italian brigades, reached\r\nGranollers, and came into touch with Duhesme’s troops, just in time\r\nto find that a disaster had preceded his arrival. The Governor of\r\nBarcelona, in obedience to the orders sent him, had marched out on\r\nJanuary 16 with three battalions and 250 cuirassiers in order to meet\r\nthe Marshal. He waited four days at Granollers, and then left the\r\nbrigade under the charge of Colonel Guétry, and returned in person\r\nto Barcelona, recalled by rumours of a threatened attack from the\r\nside of Tarragona. On the morning after his departure Guétry’s force,\r\nwhich believed itself in complete security, was suddenly surprised in\r\nits camps by a detachment sent out by O’Donnell. That enterprising\r\nofficer had heard that Augereau was still twenty miles away, and\r\nthat Guétry had scattered his men in the three villages of Santa\r\nPerpetua, Mollet, and Granollers, in order to cover them from the\r\nbitter January weather. Accordingly, he resolved to risk an attack\r\non this unwary detachment. Two brigades--about 4,000 men--under the\r\nMarquis of Campo Verde, made a forced march across the mountains,\r\nand fell upon the villages at dawn. The battalion of the 112th in\r\nSanta Perpetua was completely cut to pieces or captured--only two\r\nmen are said to have escaped. The 7th and the cuirassiers at Mollet\r\nfared somewhat better, but were driven back to Barcelona with heavy\r\nloss. Part of the third battalion, one of the 5th Italian Line\r\nregiment, which was posted at Granollers, escaped destruction by\r\nthrowing itself into a fortified convent, and held out for two days,\r\ntill it was saved by the approach of Augereau along the high-road.\r\nAltogether, Duhesme’s division was thinned by the loss of 1,000 men\r\non January 21-22: Guétry had been taken prisoner, with some 600 men\r\nmore and two guns. The Spaniards disappeared the moment that Augereau\r\ncame in sight, and rejoined O’Donnell in the hills.\r\n\r\nAugereau entered Barcelona on the twenty-fourth, and at once\r\nasserted his authority by deposing Duhesme from the governorship and\r\nsending him home to France. They were old enemies, and the general’s\r\nfriends regarded his disgrace as a display of spite on the part of\r\nhis superior[338]. But as all the Spanish narratives describe the\r\neighteen-months’ dictatorship of Duhesme as having been as much\r\ndistinguished for private rapacity as for public oppression, it\r\nis probable that the Marshal’s action was wholly justifiable. The\r\nEmperor, however, refused to sanction the prosecution of the general\r\non the charges laid against him, remarking that such proceedings\r\nwould give too much pleasure to the Catalans, ‘il y avait bien autre\r\nchose à faire que de réjouir les Espagnols par cette réaction[339].’\r\n\r\n  [338] Duhesme, or the friend writing under his name, gives\r\n  himself most handsome and unconvincing testimonials in the\r\n  narrative printed in 1823, as part of the _Mémoires sur la Guerre\r\n  d’Espagne_. They contrast strangely with Arteche’s quotations\r\n  from Barcelonese local writers.\r\n\r\n  [339] Napoleon to Clarke, Compiègne, April 24, 1810.\r\n\r\nHaving concentrated Pino’s and Souham’s troops at Barcelona, Augereau\r\nwould have proceeded to advance against the Catalans, and lay siege\r\nto Tarragona, but for one fact--the magazines of the city were almost\r\nempty, and no food could be procured for the army. Indeed, after a\r\nvery few days it was necessary for the Marshal to retrace his steps,\r\nin order to bring up an enormous convoy for the revictualling of\r\nthe place, which was being collected at Perpignan and Figueras.\r\nAll that he had done by his march was to open up the road, and to\r\nmuzzle the fortress of Hostalrich, which was still being blockaded by\r\nthe Italians. Accordingly, on February 1 his two divisions marched\r\nback each by the way that it had originally taken--Souham to Vich,\r\nwhere he halted, Pino to Gerona, where the convoy began presently\r\nto gather, escorted thither in detachments by a large body of\r\nreinforcements which had just come up from France. For the Emperor\r\nhad strengthened the Army of Catalonia by a division of troops of the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine, under General Rouyer, and by a Neapolitan\r\nbrigade--some 8,000 men in all. But the long train of carts and mules\r\ncame in slowly, and March began before Augereau was ready to move.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his lieutenant Souham had been exposed to a sudden and\r\nunexpected peril. O’Donnell had discovered that the division at Vich\r\nwas completely isolated and did not count much more than 5,000 sabres\r\nand bayonets. Having reorganized his own field army at Moya, near\r\nManresa, and brought it up to a strength of 7,000 foot and 500 horse\r\nby calling a few troops from Tarragona, he directed the somatenes\r\nof Northern Catalonia to muster on the other side of Vich, so as to\r\nfall on Souham from the rear. The indefatigable miquelete leaders\r\nRovira and Milans got together between 3,000 and 4,000 men, despite\r\nof all their previous losses and defeats. On February 19 these levies\r\nthrust in the pickets of the French division on the eastern side,\r\nbut Souham did not see his danger till, on the following morning, he\r\nfound O’Donnell’s regular troops pouring down into the plain of Vich\r\nin three columns, and challenging him to a battle in the open. Since\r\nthe day of Valls the Catalan army had never tried such a bold stroke.\r\n\r\nThe French general was greatly outnumbered--he had but 4,000 infantry\r\nand 1,200 horse to oppose to O’Donnell’s 7,500 regulars and the\r\n3,500 miqueletes. The action fell into two separate parts--while\r\nRovira and Milans bickered with two battalions left to guard the\r\ntown of Vich, Souham fought a pitched battle against the Spanish\r\nmain body with the eight battalions and two and a half regiments of\r\ncavalry[340] which constituted the remainder of his force. It was a\r\nfierce and well-contested fight: O’Donnell took the offensive, and\r\nhis men displayed an unwonted vigour and initiative. Unhappily for\r\nthis enterprising general his small body of horsemen was utterly\r\nunable to restrain or to cope with the superior French cavalry. Twice\r\nthe battle was turned by the charge of Souham’s squadrons: after the\r\nfirst repulse O’Donnell rallied his beaten right wing, threw in all\r\nhis reserves, and tried to outflank the shorter French line on both\r\nsides. The enemy was losing heavily and showing signs of yielding,\r\nwhen the whole of his cavalry made a second desperate charge on the\r\nSpanish right. It was completely successful; O’Donnell’s turning\r\ncolumn, composed of the Swiss regiments of Kayser[341] and Traxler,\r\nwas broken, and the larger part of it captured. Thereupon, the\r\nSpanish general, who had displayed undaunted courage throughout the\r\nday, and headed several charges in person, thought it time to retire.\r\nHe fell back on the mountains, leaving behind him 800 killed and\r\nwounded, and 1,000 prisoners. The French had suffered at least 600\r\ncasualties[342], including Souham himself, desperately wounded in\r\nthe head, and had been within an ace of destruction: but for their\r\nsuperiority in cavalry, the day was lost.\r\n\r\n  [340] 1st Léger (three batts.), 42nd Ligne (three batts.), 93rd\r\n  Ligne (one batt.), and 7th Ligne (one batt.). Meanwhile the\r\n  other battalion of the 7th Ligne and that of the 3rd Léger were\r\n  holding back the miqueletes. The cavalry were the 24th Dragoons,\r\n  3rd Provisional Chasseurs (soon afterwards rechristened the 29th\r\n  Chasseurs), and half the Italian ‘Dragoons of Napoleon.’\r\n\r\n  [341] This regiment had been formed on the ‘cadre’ of the old\r\n  Swiss regiment of Beschard, by means of deserters from the German\r\n  and Italian troops of the French Army of Catalonia.\r\n\r\n  [342] Martinien’s lists show 29 officers killed and wounded,\r\n  which, at the usual rate, presupposes about 600 or 700\r\n  casualties. Napier, Schepeler, and Arteche all three state the\r\n  French loss at 1,000 or 1,200--evidently too high.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, Augereau had at last collected his vast convoy at\r\nGerona--there were more than a thousand waggons laden with flour,\r\nbesides pack-mules, caissons, carriages, and other vehicles of all\r\nsorts. He marched in person to escort it, with the Italians--who were\r\nnow under Severoli, Pino having gone home on leave,--and the newly\r\narrived German division of Rouyer. Verdier was left behind--as in\r\nJanuary--to defend the Ampurdam from the incursions of the miqueletes\r\nof Rovira and Milans. Meanwhile, Souham’s division, which had passed\r\ninto the hands of General Augereau, the Marshal’s brother, since\r\nits old chief had been invalided to France, pursued a line of march\r\nparallel to that of the main force. Moving from Vich by the Col de\r\nSuspina and Manresa, it came down into the valley of the Llobregat,\r\non the same day that Pino’s and Rouyer’s troops reached it by the\r\nother route. The Marshal and the main column had made their way past\r\nHostalrich, which was found still unsubdued, and still blockaded by\r\nMazzuchelli’s brigade, which had been left opposite it in January.\r\nThese troops were ordered to join their division, a mixed detachment\r\nunder Colonel Devaux being left in their stead to watch the castle.\r\nThe Marshal then took up his residence in the palace at Barcelona,\r\nand had himself proclaimed Governor of Catalonia with great state,\r\nin consonance with the imperial decree of February 8, which had\r\ntaken the principality out of the hands of King Joseph, and made its\r\nadministrator responsible to Paris alone, and not to Madrid.\r\n\r\nAugereau established himself permanently at Barcelona, and proceeded\r\nduring the next two months to act rather as a viceroy than as a\r\ncommander-in-chief. The conduct of military operations he handed\r\nover to his brother, to the unbounded disgust of the other generals.\r\nIn what proportions the responsibility for the disasters which\r\nfollowed should be distributed between the two Augereaus it is hard\r\nto say. But Napoleon, very naturally and reasonably, placed it on\r\nthe Marshal’s shoulders, and wrote that ‘Ce n’est point en restant\r\ndans les capitales éloignées de l’armée que des généraux en chef\r\npeuvent acquérir de la gloire ou mériter mon estime[343].’ The force\r\nassembled on the Llobregat was now a very large one, consisting of\r\nthree divisions, those of Augereau, Severoli, and Rouyer. It numbered\r\nnearly 20,000 men, for along with the convoy there had marched a mass\r\nof drafts for the old regiments of the 7th Corps, which brought their\r\nbattalions up to full strength[344].\r\n\r\n  [343] _Correspondance_, 16411. From Compiègne, 24 April, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [344] Severoli’s division alone numbered 6,900 foot and 900\r\n  horse, at the moment.\r\n\r\nThere were only two rational plans of campaign open to the French:\r\nthe one was to march on Tarragona with a siege-train, and to\r\ncomplete the conquest of Catalonia by the capture of its greatest\r\nfortress. The other was to mask Tarragona, and to strike across\r\nthe principality westward, in order to get into communication with\r\nSuchet and the Army of Aragon, by way of Igualada, Cervera, and\r\nLerida. If the two corps could meet, Northern Catalonia would be\r\ncompletely isolated from Tarragona, Tortosa, and Valencia. It was\r\nthis latter plan which Augereau had been ordered to carry out by\r\nhis master. He was directed to march on Lerida, and to join Suchet\r\nbefore that place. By a dispatch of February 19 he had been informed\r\nthat on March 1 the Army of Aragon would have arrived before Lerida,\r\nand would be forming its siege[345]. This prophecy was false: for\r\nSuchet, as we have seen, had gone off on his Valencian expedition,\r\nand was at Teruel on the appointed day. It was impossible to direct\r\nfrom Paris a combined movement depending on accurate timing for its\r\nsuccess. But Augereau should have attempted to carry out the order\r\nsent him by his master with proper zeal and dispatch. This he failed\r\nto do: his own inclination was to strike a blow at Tarragona, and the\r\nmovements of his corps show that this was the operation which he had\r\ndetermined to carry out. Instead of marching in person with his main\r\nbody, on Cervera and Lerida, he directed his brother to take his own\r\nand Severoli’s divisions and to move by Villafranca on Reus, a large\r\ntown twelve miles to the north-west of Tarragona, and suitable as\r\na base of operations against that city (March 29). A battalion and\r\na half was dropped at Villafranca, to keep open the communications\r\nbetween Reus and Barcelona, while a brigade of Rouyer’s newly arrived\r\nGermans, under the ever-unlucky Schwartz--the vanquished of Bruch and\r\nEsparraguera[346]--was placed as a sort of flank-guard at Manresa.\r\nOn March 27 a summons was sent in to Tarragona demanding surrender.\r\nThis was, of course, refused--the town was full of troops, for Henry\r\nO’Donnell had just strengthened its garrison by retiring into it\r\nhimself, with the 6,000 men who represented the remains of his field\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n  [345] Napoleon to Clarke, Feb. 19, from Paris. Cf. another\r\n  dispatch of Feb. 26, no. 16294 of the _Correspondance_.\r\n\r\n  [346] See vol. i. pp. 309-11.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish general, contemplating the position of affairs with a\r\nwary eye, had convinced himself that he could stop General Augereau’s\r\nfurther movements by striking at his line of communication with\r\nBarcelona. This he proceeded to do in the most skilful and successful\r\nfashion. Before the enemy closed in upon Tarragona, he sent out\r\na picked force under General Juan Caro, with orders to attack\r\nVillafranca and Manresa without a moment’s delay. This daring stroke\r\nwas completely successful: Caro stormed Villafranca at dawn on March\r\n30, and took or captured the whole of the 800 men posted there. He\r\nwas wounded, and had to hand over his command to Campo Verde, who,\r\nafter some preliminary skirmishing lasting for three days, completed\r\nthe little campaign by driving Schwartz out of Manresa, after a heavy\r\nfight, on April 5, in which the German brigade lost 30 officers and\r\n800 men[347]. The somatenes turned out to hunt the routed force as\r\nit retired on Barcelona, and inflicted many further losses, so that\r\nSchwartz only brought back a third of his brigade to the Marshal.\r\n\r\n  [347] The Lippe-Bückeburg officer Barckhausen says in his diary\r\n  that only 20 officers and 620 men were lost. But Martinien’s\r\n  lists show 30 officers of the Nassau, ducal Saxon, and\r\n  Anhalt-Lippe regiments killed or wounded at or near Manresa on\r\n  the 2nd-5th of April.\r\n\r\nThe touch between the two divisions at Reus and the garrison of\r\nBarcelona was thus completely severed. Moreover, Augereau feared\r\nlest the next move of the raiding force might be an attack on the\r\nisolated force under Colonel Devaux which was blockading Hostalrich.\r\nHe therefore sent out a brig with one of his aides-de-camp on\r\nboard, bearing orders to his brother and Severoli to return at\r\nonce to his head quarters with their troops. By good fortune the\r\nmessenger reached his destination without being intercepted by\r\nEnglish cruisers, and the two divisions started on their march back\r\nto Barcelona on April 7. Only two days before, Severoli, more by\r\nluck than by skill, had got for a moment into touch with the Army\r\nof Aragon. An exploring column of two battalions under Colonel\r\nVillatte, which he had sent out westward to Falcet, in the direction\r\nof the Ebro, met--entirely by chance--a similar detachment of\r\nMusnier’s division of the 3rd Corps, which had advanced to Mora. On\r\ninterchanging news of their respective armies, Villatte learnt from\r\nhis colleague that Suchet was at this moment marching on Lerida,\r\nwhere, according to the Emperor’s instructions to Marshal Augereau,\r\nhe ought to have arrived more than a month before. Villatte brought\r\nback the information to Severoli, but the latter could make no\r\nuse of it while he was under orders to return without delay to\r\nBarcelona[348]. He and General Augereau accomplished their retreat\r\nin three days, much harassed on the way, not only by the somatenes\r\nof the mountains but also by O’Donnell, who followed them with\r\na detachment of the garrison of Tarragona. They took some small\r\nrevenge on him, however, at Villafranca, where they turned on the\r\npursuers and inflicted a sharp check on their advanced guard, which\r\nwas pressing in, with more courage than discretion, on a force which\r\noutnumbered it by four to one. On April 9 the whole army was encamped\r\noutside the walls of Barcelona. Counting the garrison, Augereau\r\nhad now more than 20,000 men in hand, but, not contented with this\r\nconcentration, he sent orders back to the Ampurdam, ordering Verdier\r\nto bring forward as many troops as possible to Gerona, and from\r\nthence to push forward down the high-road as far as Granollers, so\r\nas to succour Devaux, if the Spaniards should show any intention of\r\nrelieving Hostalrich.\r\n\r\n  [348] For details of Villatte’s expedition see Vacani, iv. 140-1.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal’s next move lost him the favour of Napoleon, and led to\r\nhis removal in disgrace to Paris. On April 11 he issued orders to\r\nSeveroli to march on Hostalrich, and there to take over the conduct\r\nof the siege from Devaux, while at the same time he himself moved\r\nback to Gerona with his brother’s French division, and an immense\r\ntrain, consisting partly of the empty carts of the convoy which he\r\nhad brought south in March, partly of confiscated property of all\r\nsorts from Barcelona[349]. Augereau’s excuse for this retrograde\r\nmovement, which abandoned all Central Catalonia to the enemy, was\r\nthat his army would have exhausted the magazines of Barcelona if\r\nhe had kept it concentrated for ten days more, and that he had\r\nno other way of feeding it, since the activity of the somatenes\r\nmade the dispatch of foraging detachments utterly impossible. The\r\nmoral effect of the move was deplorable: after taking in hand an\r\noffensive movement against Tarragona, he had allowed himself to be\r\nchecked by an enemy hopelessly inferior in numbers, had lost over\r\n3,000 men in petty combats, and then had retired to the base from\r\nwhich he had started in January. Three months had been wasted, and\r\nnothing had been gained save that the small castle of Hostalrich\r\nwas now in a desperate condition for want of food, and must fall if\r\nnot speedily succoured. What rendered the position of Augereau the\r\nmore shameful was that he had now in front of him only a skeleton\r\nenemy. For O’Donnell at this moment was distracted by the advance\r\nof Suchet against Lerida, and had been forced to draw off towards\r\nthe borders of Aragon two of the four divisions into which he had\r\nreorganized his little field army. Facing Augereau there was only\r\nCampo Verde’s division of regulars--not over 5,000 strong--and the\r\nbands of the mountains. It was against such an enemy that the Marshal\r\nhad concentrated 25,000 men--including Verdier’s force--between\r\nHostalrich and Gerona.\r\n\r\n  [349] According to Spanish accounts this included much ill-gotten\r\n  property belonging to the Marshal himself, and other superior\r\n  officers. Ferrer (see Arteche, viii. 203) declares that Augereau\r\n  carried off all the furniture of the Royal Palace.\r\n\r\nThe food-problem, on which those who defend Augereau lay all the\r\nstress possible[350], was no doubt a very real one. The feeding\r\nof Barcelona, with its garrison and its large civil population, by\r\nmeans of convoys brought from France, was no easy task. But it seems\r\nclear that with the large force at his disposition--the 7th Corps was\r\nover 50,000 strong[351]--Augereau could have organized convoy-guards\r\nsufficiently powerful to defy the Spaniards, without abandoning the\r\noffensive position in front of Barcelona, which was all-important to\r\nhim. He might have set aside 10,000 men for that purpose, and still\r\nhave kept a strong field army together. Had he done so, O’Donnell\r\ncould not have dared to march with 8,000 men, the pick of the Catalan\r\narmy, to relieve Lerida, while his old enemies were massed, awaiting\r\nan impossible attack, a hundred miles away.\r\n\r\n  [350] For a defence of the Marshal on these lines, see _Victoires\r\n  et Conquêtes_, vol. xx. pp. 52-3.\r\n\r\n  [351] About 56,000 in all, but 10,000 were in hospital or\r\n  detached.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the one task which was completed by the 7th Corps during\r\nthe months of April and May was the reduction of Hostalrich. The\r\nlittle castle was a place of strength, perched high above the\r\nabandoned town to which it belonged. It was garrisoned by two\r\nbattalions, one of Granadan regulars from Reding’s old division, the\r\nother of local Catalan levies[352], under Colonel Juliano Estrada,\r\nan officer of high spirit and commendable obstinacy. To the first\r\nsummons made to him in January by Augereau, he had replied that\r\n‘Hostalrich was the child of Gerona, and would know how to emulate\r\nthe conduct of the mother-city.’ Nor was this high-flown epigram\r\nbelied by the after-conduct of the garrison. Hostalrich held out from\r\nJanuary 16 to May 12 without receiving either a convoy from without\r\nor any reinforcements. Twice the local miqueletes attempted to pass\r\nsuccours into the castle, but on each occasion they were driven off,\r\nafter having barely succeeded in communicating with Estrada. Their\r\nconvoys never got close enough to enter the gates. At last, on May\r\n12, the provisions of the place were completely exhausted: thereupon\r\nEstrada took in hand a scheme which was only tried by one other\r\ngovernor during the whole Peninsular War--the Frenchman Brennier at\r\nAlmeida in May 1811. He put every able-bodied man of the garrison\r\nunder arms at midnight, issued silently from the castle, and\r\ncharged at the besiegers’ lines, with the intention of cutting his\r\nway through to Campo Verde’s head quarters in the mountains. He was\r\nfortunate enough to pierce the Italian outposts at the first rush.\r\nBut two whole brigades were presently at his heels, his guides lost\r\ntheir way among cliffs and ravines, and he was overtaken. Turning\r\nback with his rearguard to fend off the pursuers, he was wounded and\r\ntaken prisoner. Ten other officers and some 300 soldiers shared his\r\nfate: the rest of the garrison dispersed in the hills, and reached\r\nVich in small parties to the number of 800 men. If only their gallant\r\ncommander had escaped with them, the exploit would have been an exact\r\nparallel to the Almeida sortie of 1811.\r\n\r\n  [352] One battalion of Iliberia (or 1st of Granada) and one\r\n  tercio of levies from the province of Gerona: total strength\r\n  about 1,200 bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of Hostalrich and of a small fort on the Isles of Las\r\nMedas near the mouth of the Ter, were the last achievements of the\r\nArmy of Catalonia while it was under the command of Augereau. On\r\nApril 24 the Emperor had resolved to remove him from his post, and\r\nhad ordered Marshal Macdonald, Duke of Tarentum, to relieve him.\r\nIn the _Moniteur_ it was merely stated that the elder Marshal had\r\nbeen forced by ill-health to resign his charge. But the real causes\r\nof his displacement are plainly stated in Napoleon’s letter to\r\nthe Minister of War. They were the blow which he had given to the\r\nimperial prestige by his retreat to Gerona, and his disobedience\r\nin having failed to march on Lerida in aid of Suchet. It must be\r\nconfessed that the wrath of the Emperor was justifiably roused. Its\r\nfinal manifestation took the shape of a minute directing that when\r\nthe _Moniteur_ published the news of the successes at Hostalrich and\r\nLas Medas, the name of Augereau was to be kept out of the paragraph,\r\nand only those of his subordinates mentioned[353].\r\n\r\n  [353] See _Correspondance_, 16411, Napoleon to Clarke, of April\r\n  24, and 16500, same to same of May 23.\r\n\r\nWhile the new commander of the 7th Corps was on his way from Italy\r\nto Perpignan, and for some time after his arrival on May 22, there\r\nwas a complete suspension of active operations. None of the French\r\ngenerals in the principality could do more than await orders, and\r\nkeep the neighbourhood of his cantonments safe from the irrepressible\r\nmiqueletes. The whole interest of the French operations in\r\nNorth-Western Spain during this period turns on the movements of the\r\nArmy of Aragon.\r\n\r\nOn returning from his futile Valencian expedition, Suchet had found\r\nawaiting him at Saragossa orders to commence without delay the siege\r\nof Lerida, and promising that Augereau would ‘contain’ the Spanish\r\narmy of Catalonia, and would ultimately open up communication with\r\nhim by way of Cervera or Momblanch. In obedience to the imperial\r\nmandate, the commander of the 3rd Corps collected more than half\r\nhis troops for the expedition against Lerida. This concentration\r\nentailed the abandonment of the rough country of Southern Aragon to\r\nVillacampa and his bands; for having determined to leave only Laval’s\r\ndivision behind him to protect the central parts of the province,\r\nSuchet had to evacuate the region of Teruel, Albaracin and Montalvan.\r\nLaval’s two brigades remained in the valley of the Jiloca, between\r\nSaragossa and Daroca, watching the debouches from the mountains.\r\nThe other two divisions of the Army of Aragon were destined for the\r\nsiege of Lerida. Musnier, with one column, marching down from Caspe\r\nand Alcañiz[354], crossed the Ebro at Flix, and approached Lerida\r\nfrom the south. Habert, with his division, coming from the side of\r\nSaragossa, made for the same goal by way of Alcubierre and Monzon. It\r\nmight seem a dangerous experiment to march the two isolated columns\r\nacross the Spanish front, for a junction at a point so remote from\r\ntheir respective starting-points. But, for the moment, there was no\r\nhostile force of any importance in their neighbourhood. Severoli\r\nand Augereau being still at Reus, when Musnier and Habert started\r\non their way, O’Donnell could spare no troops for the relief of\r\nLerida. It was not till they had retired, and the Duke of Castiglione\r\nhad withdrawn all his forces to Hostalrich and Gerona, that the\r\nCaptain-General found himself free for an expedition to the West. In\r\nfront of Musnier, while he was marching on Lerida, there were nothing\r\nbut trifling detachments sent out for purposes of observation by\r\nthe Governor of Tortosa. In front of Habert there were only 2,000\r\nmen under Colonel Perena, thrown out from Lerida to observe the\r\nopen country between the Segre and the Cinca. This was the sole\r\nfield-force which remained from the old Spanish Army of Aragon,\r\nwith the exception of the two dilapidated regiments that formed the\r\nnucleus of Villacampa’s band.\r\n\r\n  [354] It was with a detachment of this column that Severoli’s\r\n  flanking party under Villatte got into communication on April 4,\r\n  as detailed above, page 296.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, Suchet arrived at Monzon with a brigade of infantry,\r\nand the six companies of artillery and four of engineers which were\r\ndestined for the siege of Lerida. On the thirteenth he was before the\r\nwalls of the place on the west bank of the Segre, while on the next\r\nday Habert appeared on the other bank, driving before him Colonel\r\nPerena and his battalions. This second French column had passed the\r\nSegre at Balaguer, from which it had expelled the Spanish brigade.\r\nPerena, having the choice between returning into the mountains\r\nor strengthening the garrison of Lerida, had taken the latter\r\nalternative. On the same day Musnier came up from the South, and\r\njoined the army with the force that had started from Alcañiz and had\r\ncrossed the Ebro at Flix. Suchet had now concentrated the whole of\r\nthe 13,000 men[355] whom he destined for the siege.\r\n\r\n  [355] For his strength at this moment, see the table which he\r\n  gives in his _Mémoires_, vol. i, Appendix 4. His figures cannot\r\n  always be trusted: for instance, purporting in this table to\r\n  give his whole force, present at Lerida or detached in Aragon,\r\n  he omits the six squadrons of gendarmerie which were guarding\r\n  his rear [37 officers, 1,121 men] and the four battalions of\r\n  _Chasseurs des Montagnes_, who were garrisoning Jaca, Venasque,\r\n  &c. [about 2,000 men].\r\n\r\nThe town of Lerida, then containing some 18,000 inhabitants, lies\r\nin a vast treeless plain on the western bank of the broad and rapid\r\nSegre. Its topography is peculiar: out of the dead level of the\r\nplain rise two steep and isolated hills. One of these, about 800\r\nyards long by 400 broad, and rising 150 feet above the surrounding\r\nflats, is crowned by the citadel of the town; the other, somewhat\r\nlonger but rather narrower, is no other than the hill about which\r\nCaesar and Afranius contended in the old Civil Wars of Rome, when\r\nLerida was still Ilerda. It lies about three-quarters of a mile from\r\nthe first-named height. In 1810 its culminating summit was covered\r\nby a large work called Fort Garden, and its southern and lower end\r\nwas protected by the two small redoubts called San Fernando and El\r\nPilar. The town occupies the flat ground between the citadel-height\r\nand the river. It has no trans-pontine suburb, but only a strong\r\n_tête-du-pont_ on the other side of the Segre. The strength of the\r\nplace lay in the fact that its whole eastern front was protected\r\nby the river, its whole western front by the high-lying citadel.\r\nThe comparatively short southern front was under the guns of Fort\r\nGarden, which commanded all the ground over which an enemy could\r\napproach this side of the town. There only remained, unprotected\r\nby outer works, the northern front, and this was the point which a\r\nskilful enemy would select as his objective. Another fact which much\r\nfavoured the defence was that the besieger was forced to make very\r\nlong lines of investment, since he had to shut in not only the town,\r\nbut the whole plateau on which lie Fort Garden and its dependent\r\nworks. Moreover, he must keep a force beyond the Segre, to block\r\nthe _tête-du-pont_, and this force must be a large one, because the\r\neast was the quarter from which succours sent from Catalonia must\r\ncertainly appear. The garrison, on the other hand, was quite adequate\r\nto man the works entrusted to it; the entry into the town of Perena’s\r\nAragonese battalions had brought it up to a strength of over 8,000\r\nmen. The artillery were the weak point--there were only 350 trained\r\nmen to man over 100 pieces. The Governor was Major-General Garcia\r\nConde, who owed his promotion to his brilliant achievements at Gerona\r\nin the preceding September.\r\n\r\nSuchet’s 13,000 men were insufficient for a close and thorough\r\ninvestment of such a large space as that covered by the Lerida-Garden\r\nfortifications. He was forced to leave a considerable part of\r\nits southern front watched by cavalry posts alone. Of his total\r\nforce, Musnier, with six battalions and the greater part of the\r\ncavalry--about 4,000 men in all, was beyond the river. Three\r\nbattalions blocked the _tête-du-pont_, the rest formed a sort\r\nof covering force, destined to keep off the approach of enemies\r\nfrom the side of Catalonia. On the hither side of the Segre the\r\nthree brigades of Habert, Buget, and Vergès were encamped facing\r\nthe western and north-western fronts of Lerida. They counted only\r\nthirteen battalions, being weakened by 1,200 men who had been\r\ndetached to garrison Monzon and Fraga. The communication between\r\nMusnier’s division and the rest of the army was by a flying bridge\r\nthrown across the Segre two miles above the town; it was guarded\r\nby a redoubt. The artillery park was placed at the village of San\r\nRufo, opposite the north-western angle of the town, from which it is\r\ndistant about 2,500 yards. It was evident from the first that this\r\nwould be the point of attack selected by the French engineers.\r\n\r\nThe army had barely taken up its position when, on April 19, rumours\r\nwere spread abroad that O’Donnell was on his way to relieve Lerida.\r\nThey must have been pure guesses, for the Spanish general on that day\r\nwas still at Tarragona and had made no movement. They were, however,\r\nsufficiently persistent to induce Suchet to take off Musnier’s\r\ncovering corps, strengthened by three other battalions, on a mission\r\nof exploration, almost as far as Tarrega, on the Barcelona road. No\r\nSpanish force was met, nor could any information be extracted from\r\nthe inhabitants. The absence of the troops on the left bank of the\r\nSegre was soon detected by Garcia Conde, who--to his great regret\r\nthree days later--sent messengers to inform O’Donnell that the French\r\nlines to the east of the city were now almost unoccupied.\r\n\r\nThe fiery O’Donnell was already on his way when this news reached\r\nhim. The moment that he was sure that Augereau had left Barcelona\r\nand was retreating northward, he had resolved to fly to the relief\r\nof Lerida with the two divisions of which he could dispose. On\r\nthe twentieth he marched from Tarragona by Valls and Momblanch,\r\nwith 7,000 regular infantry, 400 horse, a single battery, and some\r\n1,500 miqueletes. On the twenty-third he had reached Juneda, twelve\r\nmiles from Lerida, without having seen a French picket or having\r\nbeen detected himself. He intended to drive off the few battalions\r\nblocking the bridge-head, and to open up communication with the\r\nbesieged town that same day. Unfortunately for him, Suchet and\r\nMusnier had returned on the previous night from their expedition to\r\nTarrega, and were now lying at Alcoletge, three miles north of the\r\nbridge-head, with seven battalions and 500 cuirassiers.\r\n\r\nPushing briskly forward along the high-road, in a level treeless\r\nplateau, destitute of cover of any kind, the leading Spanish\r\ndivision--that of Ibarrola--came into contact about midday with\r\nthe small force guarding the bridge-head, which was now in charge\r\nof Harispe, Suchet’s chief-of-the-staff. To the surprise of the\r\nSpaniards, who had expected to see these three battalions and two\r\nsquadrons of hussars retire in haste, the French showed fight.\r\nHarispe was aware that Musnier could come up to his aid within an\r\nhour, and was ready for battle. His hussars charged the leading\r\nregiment of Ibarrola’s column, and threw it into disorder, while his\r\ninfantry formed up in support. At this moment the Spanish general\r\nreceived news that Musnier was moving in towards his flank; he\r\ntherefore retired, to get the support of O’Donnell, who was following\r\nhim with the second division. But at the ruined village of Margalef,\r\nsix miles from Lerida, the column of Musnier came up with Ibarrola,\r\nand he was so hard pressed that he formed line, with 300 cavalry on\r\nhis right wing and his three guns on his left. The position was as\r\nbad a one as could be found for the Spanish division--a dead flat,\r\nwith no cover. Musnier, on reaching the front, flung his cavalry,\r\n500 cuirassiers of the 13th regiment, at the Spanish right wing.\r\nThe horsemen placed there broke, and fled without crossing sabres,\r\nand the French charge fell on the flank battalion of the infantry,\r\nwhich was caught while vainly trying to form square. It was ridden\r\ndown in a moment, and the horsemen then rolled up the whole line,\r\nregiment after regiment. A great part of Ibarrola’s corps was\r\ncaptured, and O’Donnell, who came on the field with the division of\r\nPirez just as the disaster took place, could do no more than retire\r\nin good order, covering the scattered remnants of his front line. A\r\nSwiss battalion, which he told off as his rearguard, was pierced by\r\nthe cuirassiers and for the most part captured. In this disastrous\r\naffair the Spaniards lost 500 killed and wounded and several thousand\r\nprisoners[356], as also four flags and the half-battery belonging\r\nto Ibarrola’s division. The French, of whom the cavalry alone were\r\nseriously engaged, are said by Suchet to have had no more than 23\r\nkilled and 82 wounded[357].\r\n\r\n  [356] Suchet says that he took 5,600 prisoners, a figure that\r\n  appears quite impossible, as Schepeler rightly remarks (iii.\r\n  649). Ibarrola’s division had only 4,000 bayonets, and of that\r\n  of Pirez only the one Swiss battalion was seriously engaged.\r\n  Moreover, Ibarrola’s division was not absolutely exterminated,\r\n  for O’Donnell on April 26 issued an order of the day, in which he\r\n  thanks the division for its courage, and praises the battalions\r\n  which kept their ranks and re-formed behind those of Pirez,\r\n  ‘returning in good order to occupy the position (Juneda), from\r\n  which they had started at dawn.’ See the document, printed in\r\n  Arteche’s Appendix, no. 12 of vol. viii. I should doubt if 2,000\r\n  prisoners were not nearer the mark than 5,600.\r\n\r\n  [357] Figures probably correct. Martinien’s lists show one\r\n  officer killed and two wounded; of the latter, one was the\r\n  cavalry general Boussard.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that O’Donnell must take the blame for the ruin that\r\nfell upon his little field army. He should not have been caught with\r\nhis two divisions marching with an interval of four miles between\r\nthem. Nor ought he to have been ignorant of the return of Musnier’s\r\nforce, considering that he had 400 cavalry, who should have been\r\nexploring the whole country-side for miles around, instead of riding\r\nin a mass along with Ibarrola’s infantry. The carelessness shown was\r\nunpardonable: relying, apparently, on Garcia Conde’s dispatch--now\r\ntwo days old--concerning the weakness of the French beyond the Segre,\r\nthe Spanish general was caught moving as if for an unopposed entry\r\ninto Lerida, instead of in battle order. It may be added that he\r\nwould have done well to collect more men before advancing against\r\nSuchet--8,000 bayonets and sabres were too small a force to tackle\r\nthe main body of the 3rd Corps, even if they were aided by a sortie\r\nfrom Lerida, as O’Donnell had intended. It would have been well to\r\nmake some endeavour to get troops from the Valencian army, whose\r\n12,000 men were absolutely idle at the moment. It is true that José\r\nCaro and the Valencian Junta were very chary of sending their men\r\noutside their own border. But for such a great affair as the relief\r\nof Lerida a brigade or two might have been borrowed. There was a\r\nconsiderable Valencian force, at the moment, in the neighbourhood of\r\nAlcañiz.\r\n\r\nAfter the combat of Margalef Suchet summoned Lerida for a second\r\ntime, and offered to allow the Governor to see the prisoners and\r\nguns which he had taken from O’Donnell. Garcia Conde very rightly\r\nanswered that he relied on his own forces alone, and should fight\r\nto the end. Accordingly, the regular siege began. The trenches were\r\nopened opposite the north front of the town on April 29; several days\r\nof heavy rain hindered the completion of the first parallel, but on\r\nMay 7 the breaching batteries were ready and the bombardment began.\r\nThe front attacked--the Carmen and Magdalena bastions--was weak: it\r\nwas not protected by any flanking fires, and had neither a ditch nor\r\na covered way. It was bound to succumb before the very heavy fire\r\ndirected against it, unless the defence should succeed in beating\r\ndown the fire of the breaching batteries. The Spaniards did their\r\nbest, bringing up every gun that could be mounted, and replacing each\r\ninjured piece as it was disabled. But the end was obvious from the\r\nfirst: the walls were not strong enough to resist the attack.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Suchet made two successive assaults on a part of the\r\ndefences very far distant from the main front of attack--the two\r\nisolated redoubts which stood on the south end of the extramural\r\nplateau, of which Fort Garden formed the main protection. He wished\r\nto gain a footing on this high ground, both because he could from\r\nthence molest the south front of the town, and because he wished to\r\nprevent the Spaniards from using the plateau as a place of refuge\r\nafter the fall of the city, which he regarded as inevitable. The\r\nfirst attempt to take the works by escalade, on the night of April\r\n23-24, was a disastrous failure: the Pilar was occupied for a moment,\r\nbut the attack on San Fernando failed, and the dominating fire from\r\nit drove the stormers out of the smaller work, after they had held it\r\nfor a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe second escalade was more successful: it was carried out on the\r\nnight of May 12-13, and ended in the storming of both works. Only a\r\nsmall part of their garrison succeeded in escaping into Fort Garden:\r\nthe besieged lost 300 men, the successful assailants only 120. The\r\ngreater part of the plateau was now in the hands of the French.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, May 13, the engineers announced that the two\r\nbreaches in the north front of the town walls were practicable, and\r\nthat same evening Lerida was stormed. The breaches were carried with\r\nno great difficulty, but the garrison made a stubborn resistance\r\nfor some time, behind traverses and fortified houses in the rear of\r\nthem. When these were carried, the city was at Suchet’s mercy; but\r\nit was not at the city alone that he was aiming--he wished to master\r\nthe citadel also. During the last siege of Lerida, that by the Duke\r\nof Orleans in 1707, the high-lying castle had held out for many days\r\nafter the town had been lost. Suchet’s way of securing his end was\r\neffective but brutal. On the whole, it was the greatest atrocity\r\nperpetrated by any combatant, French, Spanish, or English, during\r\nthe whole Peninsular War. When his troops had entered the streets,\r\nhe directed columns towards each gate, and having secured possession\r\nof them all, so as to make escape into the open country impossible,\r\nbade his troops push the whole non-combatant population of Lerida\r\nuphill into the citadel, where the beaten garrison was already taking\r\nrefuge. ‘The soldiery,’ as he writes, with evident complacency and\r\npride in his ingenuity, ‘were set in a concentric movement to push\r\nthe inhabitants, along with the garrison, towards the upper streets\r\nand the citadel. They were dislodged by musketry fire from street\r\nafter street, house after house, in order to force them into the\r\ncastle. That work was still firing, and its discharges augmented the\r\ndanger and the panic of the civil population, as they were thrust,\r\nalong with the wreck of the garrison, into the ditch and over the\r\ndrawbridge. Pressed on by our soldiers, they hastily poured into the\r\ncastle yard, before the Governor had time to order that they should\r\nnot be allowed to enter.’ The castle being crammed with some fifteen\r\nthousand men, women, and children, Suchet gave orders to bombard it\r\nwith every available mortar and howitzer. ‘Every shell,’ he writes,\r\n‘that fell into the narrow space containing this multitude, fell on\r\nserried masses of non-combatants no less than of soldiery. It had\r\nbeen calculated that the Governor and the most determined officers\r\nwould be influenced by the presence of these women, children, old\r\nfolk, and unarmed peasants. As General Suchet had flattered himself\r\nwould be the case, the scheme had a prompt and decisive effect.’ On\r\nthe 14th at midday, Garcia Conde, unable to stand the slaughter any\r\nlonger, hoisted the white flag.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how the forcing of thousands of\r\nnon-combatants, by means of musketry fire, on to the front of the\r\nenemy’s line of defence, differs in any way from the device, not\r\nunknown among African savages and Red Indians[358], of attacking\r\nunder cover of captured women and children thrust in upon the weapons\r\nof their fathers and husbands. The act places that polished writer\r\nand able administrator Louis-Gabriel Suchet on the moral level of\r\na king of Dahomey. He acknowledges that the plan was deliberately\r\nthought out, and that scores of his victims perished not in the\r\nsubsequent bombardment, but by being shot down by his own men while\r\nthe crowd was being collected and hunted forward[359]. Historians\r\nhave denounced the atrocities committed by the French rank and file\r\nat Tarragona or Oporto, by the English rank and file at Badajoz or\r\nSt. Sebastian, but the cultured general who worked out this most\r\neffective plan for the reduction of a hostile citadel has never had\r\nhis due meed of shame. Napier’s remark that, ‘though a town taken by\r\nassault is considered the lawful prey of a licentious soldiery, yet\r\nthis remnant of barbarism does not warrant the driving of unarmed and\r\nhelpless people into a situation where they must perish,’ seems a\r\nsufficiently mild censure, when all the circumstances are taken into\r\naccount[360].\r\n\r\n  [358] One or two cases can also be quoted from the European\r\n  Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n  [359] Suchet, _Mémoires_, i. pp. 147-8.\r\n\r\n  [360] Napier, ii. 322.\r\n\r\nThe total number of Spanish troops surrendered by Garcia Conde in the\r\nCitadel and Fort Garden, or captured by the French during the storm,\r\namounted to over 7,000 men, of whom about 800 were wounded lying in\r\nthe hospital. It was calculated that 1,200 or 1,500 more had perished\r\nduring the siege, and that about 500 of the civil population had\r\nfallen victims to Suchet’s barbarous device. The French losses during\r\nthe whole series of operations had been 1,100 killed and wounded. The\r\nSpaniards declared that Garcia Conde had betrayed Lerida, and ought\r\nnever to have surrendered. But the only ground for this accusation\r\nwas that, after a short captivity, he did homage to King Joseph, and\r\nbecame an _Afrancesado_. Though he had shown dash and courage at\r\nGerona, it is clear that he lacked the firmness of governors such\r\nas Mariano Alvarez, or Andrés Herrasti. His defence of Lerida had\r\nnot been particularly skilful nor particularly resolute: with over\r\n8,000 men within the walls he ought to have been able to hold out\r\nlonger against Suchet’s 13,000. The most blameworthy part of his\r\narrangements was his neglect to retrench the breaches, and to form\r\na strong second line of temporary works behind them. Alvarez, under\r\nsimilar conditions, and with a garrison far less strong in comparison\r\nto the besieging army, held out for months after his walls had been\r\nbreached, simply because he treated them only as an outer line of\r\nresistance, and was prepared to fight on behind his inner defences.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Lerida, Suchet, having received through France\r\nthe news that the whole of Augereau’s army was collected in the\r\nneighbourhood of Hostalrich and Gerona, made up his mind that he\r\nhad better attempt nothing ambitious until the 7th Corps was in a\r\nposition to help him. But there was a small task close to his hand,\r\nwhich was well worth undertaking in a moment of enforced leisure.\r\nThis was the siege of Mequinenza, the only fortress left in Spanish\r\nhands on the eastern side of Aragon. It was a small place, but not\r\nwithout its strategic importance, for not only did it cover the\r\njunction of the Segre and the Ebro, but it was the highest point open\r\nfor navigation on the last-named river. Any one holding Mequinenza\r\ncan use the Ebro as a high-road, except in times of drought, and\r\nthis was an advantage of no small importance, since the country from\r\nthence to the sea chances to be singularly destitute of roads of\r\nany kind. A few months later, Suchet found the place invaluable, as\r\nhe was able to prepare his battering-train for the siege of Tortosa\r\nwithin its walls, and then to send all the heavy material down-stream\r\nwith the minimum of trouble. Mequinenza was a small place, consisting\r\nof a few hundred houses along the river bank enclosed by a weak\r\nand old-fashioned wall, but dominated by a strong castle, which\r\ntowers 500 feet above the water at the end of a spur of the Sierra\r\nde Montenegre. The garrison consisted of about 1,000 men, under a\r\nColonel Carbon.\r\n\r\nThe very day after Lerida had fallen, Suchet sent a brigade to invest\r\nMequinenza: more troops followed after an interval. It was clear that\r\nthe taking of the town would offer small difficulty: but the castle\r\nwas another matter. Its defences were independent of those of the\r\nplace below, and its site was so lofty and rocky that it could not\r\nbe battered from any ground accessible by existing roads. Indeed,\r\nit could only be approached along the crest of the Sierra, of which\r\nit forms the last lofty point. The main interest of the siege of\r\nMequinenza lies in the fact that, in order to reduce the castle, the\r\nFrench engineers had to build a road practicable for heavy guns in\r\nzig-zags up the side of the Sierra. They had arrived in front of the\r\nplace on May 15: by June 1 the road was completed: it was a piece\r\nof hard work, as in order to utilize the easiest possible slopes it\r\nhad been made no less than five miles long. But when the guns had\r\nonce been got up on to the crest of the mountain, Mequinenza--town\r\nand castle alike--was doomed. The town was stormed on June 5; it\r\nmight have been captured long before, but there was little use in\r\ntaking possession of it until the attack upon the castle had been\r\nbegun. Before the storm, Colonel Carbon had wisely ordered all the\r\nlarge river craft in the place, eleven in number, to run down-stream\r\nto Tortosa; he was well aware that Suchet wanted to open up the\r\nnavigation of the Ebro, and was resolved that he should find no\r\nvessels ready for him. Two of the craft ran ashore and were captured;\r\nthe other nine got off clear.\r\n\r\nWhen the three batteries erected on the summit of the Sierra opened\r\non the castle, the walls began to crumble at once. At the end of\r\neight days its front towards the French trenches was a mass of\r\nshapeless ruins. Carbon then surrendered, without waiting for an\r\nassault, which must undoubtedly have proved successful. There was\r\nnothing particularly obstinate, or, on the other hand, particularly\r\ndiscreditable, in the defence. The castle was not a modern fortress;\r\nits sole strength had lain in its inaccessible position; and when the\r\nFrench had climbed up on to a level with it, nothing more could be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHaving mastered Lerida and Mequinenza, and obtained a firm footing\r\nin the plain of Western Catalonia, Suchet had now harder work before\r\nhim. His first necessity was to clear the country behind him of\r\nthe insurgents, who had swarmed down from the hills to attack the\r\ntroops left behind in Central Aragon, while the main army had been\r\nconcentrated before Lerida. Villacampa had half destroyed a column\r\nof 350 men at Arandija on the Xalon on May 14. Catalan somatenes\r\nhad attacked the garrison of the valley of Venasque, on the very\r\nfrontier of France, on May 16. Valencian bands had besieged the\r\ncastle of Alcañiz for many days. But all the enemies of Suchet had\r\nto fly, as soon as his main army became once more free for field\r\nservice. No attempt was made to oppose a serious resistance to his\r\nmovable columns: the insurgents fled to right and left: the most\r\nextraordinary proof of their demoralization was that, on June 13,\r\nGeneral Montmarie, at the head of one of these columns, found the\r\nstrong fort of Morella, within the Valencian border, absolutely\r\nunoccupied. He seized and garrisoned it, knowing that this place,\r\nwhich commands the mountain-road from Aragon to Valencia, was of\r\nimmense strategical importance.\r\n\r\nWhen June came round, Suchet had once more mastered all Aragon, and\r\nwas free for work outside its borders. A march against Valencia, on\r\nthe one side, or against Tortosa and Tarragona on the other, was\r\nequally possible. But at this moment Napoleon was set on proceeding\r\n‘methodically’--in Eastern Spain no less than in Portugal--and the\r\norders issued to the Commander of the 3rd Corps were, to proceed\r\nagainst Tortosa, and cut off Valencia from Catalonia by its capture.\r\nThe longer and more difficult advance against Valencia itself was\r\nrelegated to a distant date; there must be no more fiascos like that\r\nof February. Accordingly, Suchet was ordered to follow up the capture\r\nof Lerida and Mequinenza by the reduction of Tortosa[361]. He was\r\ninformed at the same time that Macdonald, the new commander of the\r\nArmy of Catalonia, was ordered to attack Tarragona. In this way, the\r\nrestless O’Donnell would find his hands full at home, and would not\r\nbe able to spare time or men for the relief of Tortosa. Only from the\r\nValencian Army, which had always been badly led, and managed with the\r\nmost narrow particularism by José Caro and his Junta, need Suchet\r\nexpect any trouble.\r\n\r\n  [361] Napoleon to Berthier, _Correspondance_, May 29, 1810.\r\n\r\nBut until Macdonald was prepared to lead down his corps to the\r\nneighbourhood of Tarragona and the lower Ebro, Suchet felt that his\r\nown enterprise must be held back, or at least conducted with caution.\r\nAnd although Macdonald had received his orders in May, on taking\r\nover Augereau’s post, it was some time before he was able to execute\r\nthem. June and July had passed, and August had arrived, before he\r\nappeared in the regions where Suchet had been told to expect him,\r\nand at last placed himself in communication with the Army of Aragon.\r\nThis long delay was entirely due to the burden imposed upon him by\r\nthe necessities of Barcelona, with its large garrison and its vast\r\ncivil population. The provisions which Augereau had introduced into\r\nthe city in the early spring were exhausted, and his successor was\r\nforced to replace them by escorting thither two new convoys of great\r\nsize in June and July. So active were the miqueletes that Macdonald\r\nfound himself obliged to take with him his French and his Italian\r\ndivision as escort on each occasion. For a first-class convoy is a\r\nvast affair, stretching out to long miles in a mountain country,\r\nand requiring to be strongly guarded at every point of its unwieldy\r\nlength. The Emperor was bitterly disappointed at Macdonald’s delays:\r\nit was hard to convince him that the problem of food-supply in\r\nCatalonia was almost insoluble, and that neither Barcelona nor the\r\nfield army could be permanently fed by seizing the resources of\r\nthe valley of the Llobregat, or the Campo of Tarragona, and making\r\nwar support war in the regular style. Catalonia had never fed its\r\nwhole population even in time of peace, but had largely depended\r\non corn brought up from Aragon or imported by sea. But the British\r\nMediterranean squadron now made the transport of food to Barcelona\r\nby water impossible, while, till the 3rd Corps and the 7th Corps\r\nshould finally meet, it was impossible to supply the latter from\r\nthe Aragonese base. While neither of the normal ways of procuring\r\na regular supply of provisions was practicable, nothing remained\r\nbut the weary task of escorting convoys from Perpignan and Figueras\r\nto Barcelona. This Macdonald accomplished thrice, in June, July,\r\nand August: it was only after the third journey that he left the\r\nstoreshouses of Barcelona so thoroughly replenished that he was\r\nable to think of further offensive operations, and to concert the\r\nlong-delayed junction with Suchet and the 3rd Corps. The Marshal in\r\nhis autobiography confesses that he hated the task set him, and found\r\nit entirely out of the lines of his experience. He began his career\r\nby repealing Augereau’s hanging edicts, and endeavoured to introduce\r\nmore humane methods of warfare. But his own men were out of hand, and\r\nthe Spaniards being as fierce as ever, his task was a very hard one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Henry O’Donnell was granted three months in which to\r\nreorganize the Catalan army, which had suffered so severely at\r\nMargalef. His untiring energy enabled him to raise his force by the\r\nend of July to 22,000 men, organized in five divisions, with which\r\nhe formed a double front, facing Suchet on the west and Macdonald\r\non the east. One division under Campo Verde lay northward in the\r\nmountains, with head quarters at Cardona, and detachments pushed\r\nforward as far as Urgel and Olot: its main task was to harass the\r\nFrench garrison of the Ampurdam, and to threaten Macdonald’s rear\r\nevery time that he moved forward towards Barcelona. A second division\r\nlay facing that city, on the lower Llobregat, with detachments\r\nat Montserrat and Manresa, which kept up the communications with\r\nCampo Verde and the North. Two more divisions lay westward, in the\r\ndirection of Falcet and Borja Blanca, watching Suchet, and prepared\r\nto oppose any serious attempt on his part to close in upon Tortosa.\r\nThe fifth division, or reserve, formed a central mass of troops,\r\nready to reinforce either the detachments which watched Suchet or\r\nthose which watched Macdonald; it lay south of Tarragona, at the Col\r\nde Alba. Thus posted O’Donnell waited for further developments, and\r\ncontinued to drill and exercise his new levies, to dismiss inactive\r\nand incompetent officers, to collect magazines, and to quarrel\r\nwith the local Junta. For this active and intelligent, if reckless\r\nand high-handed, young officer was on even worse terms with the\r\nCatalan authorities than his predecessor, Blake. The main cause of\r\nquarrel was that O’Donnell wished to strengthen his regular troops,\r\nby drafting into the depleted _cadres_ of Reding’s and Coupigny’s\r\nold battalions every recruit that he could catch. He held that the\r\nFrench could only be brought to a final check by disciplined troops.\r\nThe Junta, on the other hand, believed in guerrilla warfare, and\r\npreferred to call out from time to time the miqueletes and somatenes,\r\nwho drifted back to their homes whenever a crisis was over. Both\r\nsides had much to say for themselves: the Catalans could point out\r\nthat the regular troops had been beaten times out of number, while\r\ntheir own irregulars had achieved many small successes, and done\r\nthe French much harm. O’Donnell, on the other hand, was quite right\r\nin holding that guerrilla operations, much as they might incommode\r\nthe enemy, would never deal him a fatal blow or finish the war. He\r\ndreamed of recruiting his army up to a force of 50,000 men at some\r\nhappy future date, and of delivering a stroke with superior numbers\r\nwhich should destroy the French hold on Catalonia. Meanwhile, much as\r\nthey quarrelled, the Irish-Spanish general and the local Junta were\r\nboth too good haters of France to allow their disputes to prevent\r\na vigorous resistance from being kept up in the principality.\r\nO’Donnell carried his point to the extent of persuading the Junta to\r\nallow him to form many of the ever-changing tercios of miqueletes\r\ninto ‘legions,’ which were to be kept permanently embodied[362], and\r\nto count as part of the regular army. Hence came the large rise in\r\nhis muster-rolls.\r\n\r\n  [362] To please the Catalans, who hated the idea of long service,\r\n  the enlistment in the Legions was made for two years only, and\r\n  the men were to be entitled to fifteen days’ leave during each\r\n  half-year of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XX: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF SPAIN DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF 1810\r\n(MARCH-OCTOBER 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation which had been created by King Joseph’s rapid conquest\r\nof the open country of Andalusia in January and February 1810, and\r\nby his failure to capture Cadiz, was destined to remain unchanged\r\nin any of its more important details for a full year. Soult, with\r\nthe three corps of Victor, Sebastiani, and Mortier, was strong\r\nenough to hold the towns and plains, strong enough also to blockade\r\nCadiz and to spare expeditionary forces at intervals for operations\r\noutside the limits of his own sphere of command. From time to time\r\nhe sent the greater part of Mortier’s corps against Estremadura,\r\nand the greater part of Sebastiani’s corps against Murcia. But his\r\n70,000 men were not sufficient to provide an army for the permanent\r\nconquest of either of these provinces. And every time that 10,000 or\r\n15,000 sabres and bayonets were distracted to one of these raids,\r\nthe total of troops left behind to watch Cadiz, to guard Seville,\r\nand to repress the interminable activity of the guerrilleros of the\r\nmountains was found to be dangerously small. Ere long the force that\r\nhad marched out for external operations had to be called back in\r\nhaste, to ward off some peril to one or other of the vital points of\r\nAndalusia.\r\n\r\nSoult himself remained for the greater part of his time at Seville,\r\noccupied not only in keeping the movements of his three corps in\r\nunison--no easy task, for both Victor and Sebastiani had wills of\r\ntheir own, and even the placid Mortier occasionally murmured--but\r\nin superintending the details of civil administration. It was\r\nvery seldom that he marched out in person at the head of his last\r\nreserves, to strengthen some weak point in his line of offence\r\nor defence. During the next two years he was quite as much the\r\nViceroy as the Commander-in-Chief in Andalusia. Though the Emperor\r\nhad refrained from naming that kingdom one of the ‘Military\r\nGovernments,’ which he had created by his decree of Feb. 15, 1810,\r\nyet Soult made himself in fact, if not in name, as independent as\r\nthe governors of Aragon or Navarre or Catalonia. The bond of common\r\ninterests and desires which had united him to King Joseph during\r\nthe winter of 1809-10 was soon broken. The monarch at Madrid soon\r\ndiscovered that his presence was not desired in Andalusia--some\r\ngood military reason could always be discovered which made it\r\nimpracticable that he should revisit Seville. Little or no money\r\nwas remitted to him from the South: rich as was Soult’s sphere of\r\ngovernance, it was always made to appear that the expenses of the\r\nsustenance of the army and of the siege of Cadiz were so great\r\nthat no surplus remained for the central government. When the King\r\nmurmured, and appealed to Paris, his brother usually supported the\r\nMarshal[363]; it was Napoleon’s first maxim that war should maintain\r\nwar, and he thought it of far more importance that the army of\r\nAndalusia should pay for itself, than that the bankrupt exchequer at\r\nMadrid should be recruited[364]. As the months rolled on, and Joseph\r\ngradually realized the position, his hatred for the plausible Marshal\r\nbecame as bitter as it had been during their earlier quarrel in the\r\nsummer of 1809. He had good reason to be angry, for Soult undoubtedly\r\nsacrificed the interests of the King of Spain to those of the Viceroy\r\nof Andalusia. He played a selfish game, though he had always a good\r\nmilitary excuse for any particular refusal to fall in with the King’s\r\nplans or to obey his orders. In 1810 his conduct may be justified,\r\nbut in 1811 and 1812 he undoubtedly--as will be shown in chapters to\r\ncome--ruined what small chance there was of bringing the Peninsular\r\nWar to a successful termination, by pursuing a policy which made the\r\nmaintenance of the French authority in Andalusia its chief end, and\r\nnot the general good of the imperial arms in Spain.\r\n\r\n  [363] Though not always. See the case of the revenue from the\r\n  quicksilver mines, in _Correspondance_, no. 17,076.\r\n\r\n  [364] Cf. ibid., July 10, to Soult.\r\n\r\nSoult’s conduct at Oporto in the days of his invasion of Portugal\r\nmust never be forgotten when his doings in Andalusia are discussed.\r\nHe undoubtedly yearned after supreme power, and though the lesson\r\nwhich he had received after his vain attempt to create himself king\r\nof ‘Northern Lusitania’ had not been forgotten, his ambitions were as\r\ngreat as ever. He suppressed his desire for the royal name, but gave\r\nhimself the reality of the royal power. He practically kept a court,\r\na ministry, and a revenue of his own[365], despite of all the angry\r\ncomplaints of his immediate master at Madrid. Secure in the support\r\nof the Emperor, who reckoned him the ‘best military head in Spain,’\r\nhe ignored or disobeyed all such communication from Joseph as did\r\nnot suit his purpose. To a great extent he justified his policy by\r\nsuccess: the plain-land of Andalusia was undoubtedly the part of the\r\nFrench holding in Spain where the administration was most successful,\r\nand the occupation most thorough. Soult not only built up, but\r\nkept together, an _Afrancesado_ party among the local population,\r\nwhich was stronger and more compact than in any other part of the\r\nPeninsula. He even succeeded in raising a small permanent force of\r\nSpanish auxiliaries, which was decidedly more trustworthy and less\r\ngiven to desertion than the regiments of the same class which King\r\nJoseph was perpetually creating in Madrid--only to see them crumble\r\naway under his hand. The Army of Andalusia was strengthened by two\r\nregiments of Chasseurs à Cheval, which were attached to the 5th\r\nCorps[366], and some free companies of infantry[367], which were used\r\nfor garrison and blockhouse work. But it was far more important that\r\nSoult succeeded in enlisting many battalions of a sort of national\r\nguard, which he called _Escopeteros_ (fusiliers); with them he kept\r\nthe peace of the larger towns, such as Seville, Cordova, and Jaen.\r\nThe very existence of such a force, which King Joseph had vainly\r\nattempted to establish in Madrid, was of evil omen for the patriotic\r\ncause in Andalusia. On several occasions they fought well against\r\nthe guerrilleros, when the latter attempted raids dangerously close\r\nto the great cities. For the _Juramentado_ was well aware that if the\r\nnational cause were at last to triumph an evil fate would await him.\r\nHaving once committed himself to the French side, he was forced to\r\ndefend his own neck from the gallows.\r\n\r\n  [365] There was desperate quarrelling with Madrid when Soult\r\n  tried to get hold of the port-revenues--small as these were,\r\n  owing to the English blockade--and when he tried to nominate\r\n  consuls on his own authority. See Ducasse’s _Correspondance du\r\n  Roi Joseph_, vol. vii. p. 337.\r\n\r\n  [366] 3rd and 4th Chasseurs à Cheval, both present at Albuera and\r\n  other fights in Estremadura in 1810-12. They seem to have gone to\r\n  pieces on the evacuation of Andalusia in the autumn of 1812.\r\n\r\n  [367] Cazadores de Jaen, Francos de Montaña, &c. There was a\r\n  company of this sort in Badajoz when it was taken in 1812. The\r\n  Spanish government shot the officers after trial by court martial.\r\n\r\nSoult’s civil government was conducted with a far greater decency\r\nthan that of Duhesme, Kellermann, and other noted plunderers among\r\nthe French governors. But it involved, nevertheless, a considerable\r\namount of more or less open spoliation. The Marshal’s own hands\r\nwere not quite clean: his collection of the works of Murillo and\r\nVelasquez, the pride of Paris in after years, represented blackmail\r\non Andalusian church-corporations, when it did not come from\r\nundisguised confiscation. Unless he was much maligned by his own\r\ncompatriots, no less than by the Spaniards, hard cash as well as\r\npictures did not come amiss to him[368]. But his exactions were\r\nmoderate compared with those of some of his subordinates: though\r\nMortier and Dessolles had good reputations Sebastiani had an infamous\r\none, and Perreymond, Godinot (who shot himself early in 1812 when\r\ncalled to face a commission of inquiry), and certain other generals\r\nhave very black marks against them. Still the machine of government\r\nworked, if not without friction, at least with an efficiency that\r\ncontrasted favourably with the administration of any other province\r\nof Spain save Suchet’s domain of Aragon.\r\n\r\n  [368] Cf. Observations by his aide-de-camp St. Chamans, in his\r\n  _Memoirs_, pp. 203-5, as to the Marshal’s administration. It may\r\n  serve as an example of the liberal way in which the superior\r\n  officers were allowed to draw in money, that Soult gave his\r\n  ex-aide-de-camp 1,500 francs a month, when he was commanding in\r\n  the town of Carmona, besides his pay and free food and quarters.\r\n  It is small wonder that he and other governors began, as he said,\r\n  ‘à trancher du grand seigneur.’ Cf. Arteche, viii. 109, for\r\n  Spanish views on Soult’s administration.\r\n\r\nBut it was only the valley of the Guadalquivir which lay subdued\r\nbeneath the feet of Soult. Cadiz and the mountains had yet to be\r\ndealt with, and, as the months went on, the difficulties of the\r\nFrench Army of Andalusia became more and more evident. It was only\r\nby degrees that the French generals came to comprehend the absolute\r\nimpregnability of Cadiz, and the advantage that the possession of the\r\nisland-city and the fleet depending on it gave to the Spaniards. In\r\nthe first months of the siege Victor’s engineers and artillerists\r\nhad flattered themselves that something might be done to molest the\r\nplace, if not to reduce it to surrender, by pushing batteries forward\r\nto the extreme front of the ground in their possession all around the\r\nharbour. Within the first weeks of his arrival in front of Cadiz,\r\nVictor made an attempt to push forward his posts along the high-road\r\nwhich crosses the broad salt-marshes of the Santi Petri. But the bogs\r\nand water-channels were found impracticable, and the Spanish works\r\nin front of the bridge of Zuazo too strong to be attacked along the\r\nnarrow causeway. The French drew back to Chiclana, which became the\r\nhead quarters of the left wing of the blockading force, and where\r\nRuffin’s division was permanently encamped. It was then thought that\r\nsomething might be accomplished further to the north, by working\r\nagainst the Arsenal of La Carraca, at the one end of the Spanish\r\nline, or the projecting castle of Puntales at the other. The struggle\r\nfor the points of vantage from which Puntales could be battered\r\nformed the chief point of interest during the early months of the\r\nsiege. The French, pushing down from the mainland on to the peninsula\r\nof the Trocadero, began to erect works on the ground most favourable\r\nfor attacking the fort of Matagorda, which had once more become the\r\noutermost bulwark of Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThere was a bitter fight over this work, which stands on the tidal\r\nflats below the Trocadero, surrounded by mud for one half of the day,\r\nand by water for the other. It will be remembered that Matagorda had\r\nbeen blown up at the time of the first arrival of the French before\r\nCadiz. But after a few days of reflection the English and Spanish\r\nengineer officers in command of the defence grew uneasy as to the\r\npossibilities of mischief which might follow from the seizure of the\r\nruined fort by the enemy. Their fears, as it afterwards turned out,\r\nwere unnecessary. But they led to the reoccupation of Matagorda on\r\nFebruary 22 by a detachment of British artillery, supported by a\r\ncompany of the 94th regiment. The front of the work facing toward\r\nthe mainland was hastily repaired, and heavy guns brought over the\r\nharbour from Cadiz were mounted on it. Moreover, it was arranged\r\nthat it should be supported by a Spanish ship-of-the-line and some\r\ngunboats, as far as the mud banks permitted.\r\n\r\nVictor took the reoccupation of the fort as a challenge, and\r\nthought that the Allies must have good reasons for attaching so\r\nmuch importance to it. Accordingly he multiplied his batteries on\r\nthe Trocadero, till he had got forty guns mounted in a dominating\r\nposition, with which to overwhelm the garrison in their half-ruinous\r\nstronghold. There was a long and fierce artillery contest, but the\r\nFrench had the advantage both in the number of guns and in the\r\nconcentric fire which they could pour upon the fort. The naval help\r\npromised to Matagorda proved of little assistance, partly owing to\r\nthe impracticability of the mud flats when the tide was out, partly\r\nbecause the gunboats could not endure the fire of the French heavy\r\nartillery. On April 22 General Graham, who had arrived at Cadiz and\r\ntaken command of the British forces over the head of General Stewart,\r\nordered Matagorda to be evacuated. It was high time, for the fort was\r\nshot to pieces, and 64 men out of a garrison of 140 had been killed\r\nor wounded[369]. The enemy took possession of the ruins, and rebuilt\r\nand rearmed the fort; they also re-established the ruined forts of\r\nSan Luis and San José, on the firm ground facing Matagorda, to which\r\nthey had not possessed a safe access till the outer work in the mud\r\nhad been captured. These were the most advanced points toward Cadiz\r\nwhich the French could hold, and here they mounted their heaviest\r\nguns, in the hope of demolishing the Castle of Puntales on the other\r\nside of the water, and of making the inner harbour useless for\r\nshipping. Their purpose was only partly accomplished: the ships, it\r\nis true, had to move east or west, into the outer harbour or nearer\r\nto the Carraca and the Isla de Leon. But Puntales was never seriously\r\ninjured, and maintained an intermittent artillery duel with Matagorda\r\nacross the strait as long as the siege lasted. The occasional bombs\r\nthat fell beyond Puntales, in the direction of the Cortadura, did not\r\nseriously incommode the garrison, and ships could always pass the\r\nstrait between the two forts at night without appreciable risk. Later\r\non Soult caused mortars of unprecedented dimensions to be cast in the\r\narsenal of Seville, on the designs presented to him by an artillery\r\nofficer of the name of Villantroys. But even when these had been\r\nmounted on Matagorda no great damage was done, one bomb only--as a\r\nSpanish popular song recorded--ever touched Cadiz town, and that only\r\nkilled a street dog.\r\n\r\n  [369] There is a good account of the desperate life of the\r\n  garrison of Matagorda during the bombardment in the _Eventful\r\n  Life of a Scottish Soldier_, by Sergeant Donaldson of the 94th.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Spanish Infantry 1810_\r\n  (_showing the new uniform introduced under British influence_)]\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Matagorda, the next most notable event of the\r\nspring in front of Cadiz was a fearful hurricane, lasting from the\r\n6th to the 9th of March, which caused grave losses to the vessels\r\nin the outer harbour. A south-wester from the Atlantic drove three\r\nSpanish line-of-battle ships, one of which, the _Concepcion_, was a\r\nthree-decker of 100 guns, and a Portuguese 74, upon the coast about\r\nPuerto Santa Maria and Rota. The French opened upon them with red-hot\r\nshot, and destroyed them all, slaying a great part of the unfortunate\r\ncrews, who had no thought of resistance, and were only trying to\r\nescape to land, where they were bound to become prisoners. More than\r\nthirty merchant ships, mostly British, were destroyed by the same\r\nstorm. One was a transport containing a wing of the 4th regiment,\r\nwhich was coming to reinforce the garrison of Cadiz. Some 300 men\r\nfrom this unlucky vessel got ashore and were captured by the French.\r\n\r\nA month after the loss of Matagorda the outer harbour of Cadiz again\r\nsaw some exciting scenes. Moored beside the Spanish fleet were a\r\nnumber of pontoons, old men-of-war from which the masts and rigging\r\nhad been removed, and which were used as prison-ships. On them there\r\nwere still kept several thousands of French prisoners, mostly the men\r\ncaptured with Dupont in 1808. It is astonishing that the Regency had\r\nnot ordered their removal to some more remote spot the moment that\r\nVictor’s army appeared in front of Cadiz. Overcrowded, and often kept\r\nwithout sufficient food for days at a time, these unhappy captives\r\nwere in a deplorable position. The sight of their fellow-countrymen\r\nin possession of the opposite coast drove them to desperation, and\r\nthey were prepared to take any risks for a chance of escape. Having\r\nnoted, during the hurricane of March 6th-9th, that every vessel\r\nwhich broke loose from its moorings had been cast by the set of\r\nthe tide upon the coast in the direction of Rota, the prisoners on\r\nthe _Castilla_, on which nearly all the officers were confined,\r\nwaited for the next south-wester. When it came, on the night of the\r\n15th-16th May, they rose upon their small guard of Spanish marines,\r\noverpowered them, and then cut the cables of the pontoon, committing\r\nthemselves to the perils of the sea as well as to the risk of being\r\nsunk by the neighbouring men-of-war. But it was supposed that they\r\nhad got adrift by accident, and they had been carried by the tide\r\nalmost to the opposite shore before it was realized that an escape\r\nwas on foot. Two gunboats sent to tow the _Castilla_ back met with\r\nresistance, the prisoners firing on them with the muskets taken from\r\ntheir guard, and throwing cold shot down upon the little vessels when\r\ntheir crews tried to board. Just as they were beaten off, the pontoon\r\nwent ashore. The French garrisons of the neighbouring batteries ran\r\ndown to help their countrymen to escape; at the same moment other\r\ngunboats, Spanish and English, came up, and began firing on the\r\ncrowd, who strove to swim or scramble ashore. Some were killed, but\r\nover 600 got to land. It is surprising that after this incident the\r\nSpaniards did not take better care of the remaining pontoons, but\r\nten days later the prisoners on the _Argonauta_ were able to repeat\r\nthe trick of their comrades. On this occasion the absconding vessel\r\nran ashore upon a mud-bank some hundreds of yards from the shore of\r\nthe Trocadero. The stranded vessel remained for hours under the fire\r\nof the gunboats which pursued it, and a large proportion of the men\r\non board perished, for when the troops on shore brought out boats\r\nto save the survivors, many of them were sunk as they plied between\r\nthe _Argonauta_ and the land. Finally the pontoon was set on fire,\r\nand several wounded Frenchmen are said to have been burnt alive. The\r\nEnglish seamen who were engaged in this distressing business were\r\nheartily disgusted with their share in it[370].\r\n\r\n  [370] See the letter of Charles Vaughan deploring the ‘beastly\r\n  necessity of firing into the poor devils’ quoted by Napier in his\r\n  Appendix, vol. ii. p. 482. For a narrative by one of the escaping\r\n  French officers see the _Mémoires_ of Colonel Chalbrand.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Regency at last ordered the removal of the rest of\r\nthe French prisoners from Cadiz. The few remaining officers were\r\nsent to Majorca, and afterwards to England. Of the men part were\r\ndispatched to the Canaries, part to the Balearic Islands. But the\r\nislanders protested against the presence of so many French in their\r\nmidst, raised riots, and killed some of the prisoners. Thereupon the\r\nRegency ordered 7,000 of them to be placed upon the desolate rock\r\nof Cabrera, where there were no inhabitants and no shelter save one\r\nsmall ruined castle. The wretched captives, without roofs or tents\r\nto cover them, and supplied with food only at uncertain intervals\r\nand in insufficient quantity, died off like flies. Once, when storms\r\nhindered the arrival of the provision ships from Majorca, many scores\r\nperished in a day of sheer starvation[371]. The larger half did not\r\nsurvive to see the peace of 1814, and those who did were for the most\r\npart mere wrecks of men, invalids for life. Even allowing for the\r\ndesperate straits of the Spanish government, which could not feed its\r\nown armies, the treatment of the Cabrera prisoners was indefensible.\r\nThey might at least have been exchanged for some of the numerous\r\nSpanish garrisons taken in 1810-11; but the Regency would not permit\r\nit, though Henry O’Donnell had arranged with Macdonald a regular\r\n_cartel_ for prisoners in the neighbouring Catalonia. This is one of\r\nthe most miserable corners of the history of the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\n  [371] Nothing can be more distressing reading than the chronicles\r\n  of the Cabrera prisoners, Ducor, Guillemard, Gille and others.\r\n  Actual cannibalism is said to have occurred during the longest of\r\n  the spells of fasting caused by the non-arrival of provisions.\r\n  [See Gille, p. 240.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to Andalusia. By the month of May the Regency at Cadiz\r\nhad recovered a certain confidence, in view of the utter inefficacy\r\nof Victor’s attempt to molest their city. From that month began a\r\nsystematic attempt to organize into a single system all the forces\r\nthat could be turned to account against Soult. There were now in\r\nthe Isla some 18,000 Spanish troops, as well as 8,000 British and\r\nPortuguese. This was a larger garrison than was needed, now that\r\nthe defences had been put in order; and it was possible to detach\r\nsmall expeditionary corps to east and west, to stir up trouble in\r\nthe coast-land of Andalusia, and serve as the nuclei round which\r\nthe insurgents of the mountains might gather. For the insurrection\r\nin the remoter corners of the kingdom of Granada had never died\r\ndown, despite of all the efforts of Sebastiani to quell it. The\r\nRegency had now determined that an effort should be made to extend\r\nit westward--the Sierra de Ronda being quite as well suited for\r\nirregular operations as the Alpujarras. At the other end of the line,\r\ntoo, there were opportunities in the Condado de Niebla and the lands\r\nby the mouth of the Guadiana, which the French had hardly touched:\r\ntrifling detachments of the 5th Corps at Moguer and Niebla observed\r\nrather than occupied that region. By means of the large fleet always\r\nmoored in Cadiz harbour, it was possible to transfer troops to any\r\npoint of the coast, for the French could not guard every creek and\r\nfishing-village, and if an expedition failed it had a fair chance of\r\nescaping by sea. Moreover any force thrown ashore in the south had\r\nthe option of retiring into Gibraltar if hard pressed, just as any\r\nforce sent to the west might retire on Portugal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the insurgents and the garrison of Cadiz there were\r\ntwo regular armies whose energies might be turned against Soult.\r\nThe relics of Areizaga’s unfortunate host, which had fled into the\r\nkingdom of Murcia, and had been rallied by Blake, were now 12,000\r\nstrong, and since Suchet’s expedition against Valencia had failed,\r\nand there was no danger from the north, this force could be employed\r\nagainst Sebastiani and the French corps in the kingdom of Granada. It\r\nwas in a deplorable condition, but was yet strong enough to render\r\nassistance to the insurgents of the Alpujarras, by demonstrating\r\nagainst Granada, and so forcing Sebastiani to keep his troops massed\r\nfor a regular campaign. Whenever the French general was threatened\r\nfrom the east, he had to abandon his smaller posts, and to desist\r\nfrom hunting the guerrilleros, who thus obtained a free hand.\r\n\r\nThe Regency could also count to a certain extent upon aid from\r\nLa Romana and the Army of Estremadura. The Marquis--it will be\r\nremembered--was now confronted in his own province by Reynier and\r\nthe 2nd Corps[372], but he had thrust his flanking division, under\r\nBallasteros, into the mountains of North-Western Andalusia, where it\r\nhad been contending with Mortier’s corps in the direction of Araçena\r\nand Zalamea, as has already been recounted[373]. This outlying\r\ndivision was in communication with Cadiz, via Ayamonte and the\r\nlower Guadiana, and could always compel Soult to detach troops from\r\nSeville by descending into the plains. La Romana himself could, and\r\noccasionally did, provide further occupation for the 5th Corps by\r\nmoving other troops southward, on the Seville high-road, when he was\r\nnot too much engrossed by Reynier’s demonstrations in his front.\r\n\r\n  [372] See pp. 213-14 of this volume and p. 246.\r\n\r\n  [373] See pp. 215-16 of this volume.\r\n\r\nThus it was possible to harass the French troops in Andalusia on\r\nall sides. With the object of securing some sort of unity for their\r\noperations, the Regency made Blake Commander-in-Chief of the forces\r\nin Cadiz as well as of those in Murcia, declaring them parts of a\r\nsingle ‘Army of the Centre.’ Albuquerque’s separate charge had come\r\nto an end when, after many quarrels with the Cadiz Junta, he resigned\r\nthe post of governor, and accepted that of Ambassador to the Court\r\nof St. James’s at the end of March. He died not long after his\r\narrival in London, engaged to the last in a hot warfare of pamphlets\r\nand manifestos with the Junta, whose monstrous insinuations against\r\nhis probity and patriotism are said to have driven him into the\r\nbrain-fever which terminated his life. He was a man of unsullied\r\nhonour and high personal courage, but not a lucky general, though\r\nhis last military action, the direction of the Army of Estremadura\r\non Cadiz, was a sound and meritorious piece of strategy. He and\r\nLa Romana were the only Spanish officers with whom Wellington was\r\nable to work in concert without perpetual friction, but the British\r\nCommander-in-Chief had a greater respect for his allies’ hearts\r\nthan for their heads as may be gathered from constant references\r\nin the _Wellington Dispatches_, as well as from the confidential\r\nconversations of the Duke’s later years[374].\r\n\r\n  [374] See _Wellington Dispatches_, v. p. 292, &c., and Stanhope’s\r\n  _Conversations with the Duke of Wellington_, pp. 10 and 23.\r\n\r\nBlake arrived in Cadiz on April 22, having turned over the temporary\r\ncommand of the Murcian army to General Freire, the ever-unlucky\r\ncavalry commander who had served under Venegas and Areizaga in the\r\ncampaigns of Almonacid and Ocaña. He set himself to reorganize the\r\nvarious Estremaduran and other troops in Cadiz into one division\r\nof horse and three divisions of foot, which he numbered Vanguard,\r\n2nd, and 4th of the Army of the Centre. The Murcian forces were\r\ndistributed into the 1st, 3rd, and 5th infantry divisions of the\r\nsame army, and two small cavalry divisions. This reorganization of\r\nthe regular troops was followed by systematic attempts to foster the\r\ninsurrection to right and left of Seville. General Copons was sent\r\nto Ayamonte, at the mouth of the Guadiana, with 700 men, round whom\r\nhe collected a miscellaneous assemblage of peasantry, which often\r\ndescended from the hills to worry the French garrisons of Moguer and\r\nNiebla. When chased by stronger forces detached from Mortier’s corps,\r\nhe would retire into Portugal. When unmolested he joined hands with\r\nBallasteros and the flanking division of the army of La Romana, or\r\nexecuted raids of his own in the central plain of the kingdom of\r\nSeville. Often chased, and sometimes dispersed, his bands were never\r\ncompletely crushed, and kept Western Andalusia, or ‘Spanish Algarve,’\r\nas it was called in the old days when the boundaries of Castile and\r\nPortugal had only just been fixed, in a state of constant ferment.\r\n\r\nThe diversion which was prepared on the other flank by Blake and the\r\nRegency was far more important. Their intention was to wrest from\r\nthe French the whole district of the Sierra de Ronda, the mountain\r\nregion between Gibraltar and Malaga, and so to thrust in a wedge\r\nbetween Victor and Sebastiani. There was already the nucleus of an\r\ninsurrection in this quarter; soon after King Joseph’s triumphal\r\nprogress from Xeres by Ronda and Malaga to Granada, the first small\r\nbands had appeared. They were headed by local chiefs, such as\r\nBecerra, Ruiz, and Ortiz--better known as El Pastor--whose original\r\nfollowers were a party of the smugglers who, in times of peace and\r\nwar alike, had been wont to ply a contraband trade with Gibraltar.\r\nIn March and April they were not strong enough to do more than\r\nmolest the convoys passing from Malaga and Seville to the French\r\ngarrison of Ronda. But finding the enemy in their neighbourhood weak\r\nand helpless--the bulk of the 1st Corps was before Cadiz, and that\r\nof the 5th Corps was still watching La Romana on the roads north\r\nof Seville--they multiplied in numbers and extended their raids\r\nfar afield. They asked for aid both from the British Governor of\r\nGibraltar and from the Regency at Cadiz, promising that, if they were\r\nbacked by regular troops, they would easily expel the French and\r\nmaster the whole country-side. Already their activity had produced\r\nfavourable results, for Soult sent down from Seville Girard’s\r\ndivision of the 5th Corps, a detachment which left Mortier too weak\r\nfor any serious operations on the side of Estremadura, and Sebastiani\r\ndrew back from an expedition against Murcia, which might otherwise\r\nhave proved most prejudicial to the Spanish cause.\r\n\r\nThis raid deserves a word of notice: just after Blake had left Murcia\r\nfor Cadiz, Sebastiani (who had for the moment got the better of the\r\ninsurgents in the Alpujarras) assembled at Baza, in the eastern\r\nextremity of the kingdom of Granada, the greater part of the 4th\r\nCorps, and marched with 7,000 men on Lorca. Freire, distrusting\r\nhis troops, refused to fight, threw 4,000 men into the impregnable\r\nharbour-fortress of Cartagena, and retired with the rest of his army\r\nto Alicante, within the borders of Valencia. Thus, the rich city of\r\nMurcia, along with the whole of the rest of its province, which had\r\nnever seen the French before, was exposed undefended to Sebastiani.\r\nHe entered it on April 23, and commenced by fining the corporation\r\n50,000 dollars for not having received him with a royal salute\r\nand the ringing of the bells of their churches. The rest of his\r\nbehaviour was in keeping: he entered the cathedral while mass was in\r\nprogress, and interrupted the service to seize the plate and jewels.\r\nHe confiscated the money and other valuables in all the monasteries,\r\nhospitals, and banks. He permitted his officers to blackmail many\r\nrich inhabitants, and his rank and file to plunder houses and shops.\r\nTwo days after his entry he retraced his footsteps, and retreated\r\nhastily towards Granada, leaving a ruined city behind him[375]. The\r\ncause of his sudden departure was the news that the insurgents of the\r\nAlpujarras, whom he had vainly imagined that he had crushed, were\r\nbeleaguering all his small garrisons, and that Malaga itself had been\r\nseized by a large band of the Serranos, and held for a short space,\r\nthough General Perreymond had afterwards succeeded in driving them\r\nout. But the whole of the Alhama and Ronda Sierras were up in arms,\r\nno less than the more eastern hills where the rising had begun. It\r\nwould have been absurd for Sebastiani to proceed any further with\r\nthe offensive campaign in Murcia, when Southern Andalusia was being\r\nlost behind his back.\r\n\r\n  [375] For strange and scandalous details of Sebastiani’s doings\r\n  in Murcia, see Schepeler, iii. pp. 566-7.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of May Girard and Sebastiani, with some small\r\nassistance from Dessolles, who spared a few battalions from the\r\nkingdom of Cordova, were actively engaged in endeavouring to repress\r\nthe mountaineers. The larger bands were dispersed, not without\r\nsevere fighting--Girard’s men had hot work at Albondonates on May\r\n1, and at Grazalema on May 3[376]. But just as the main roads had\r\nbeen reopened, and the blockade of the French garrison of Ronda\r\nraised, the whole situation was changed by the landing at Algeciras\r\nof General Lacy, with a division of 3,000 regulars sent from Cadiz\r\nby the Regency (June 19). His arrival raised the spirits of the\r\ninsurgents, and they thronged in thousands to his aid, when he\r\nannounced his intention of marching against Ronda. Lacy, however,\r\nwas both irresolute and high-handed--as he afterwards showed on a\r\nlarger stage when he became Captain-General of Catalonia. On arriving\r\nbefore Ronda he judged the rocky stronghold too formidable for him\r\nto meddle with, and turned aside to Grazalema, to the disgust of his\r\nfollowers. He then fell into a quarrel with the Serranos, dismissed\r\nmany of them--smugglers and others--from his camp, as unworthy to\r\nserve alongside of regular soldiers, and even imprisoned some of\r\nthe more turbulent chiefs. At this moment Girard from the north\r\nand Sebastiani from the east began to close in upon him. Uneasy\r\nat their approach, Lacy fell back towards the coast, and after\r\nsome insignificant skirmishes re-embarked his force at Estepona\r\nand Marbella, from whence he sailed round to Gibraltar and landed\r\nat the Lines of San Roque, under the walls of that fortress (July\r\n12)[377]. Almost the only positive gain produced by his expedition\r\nhad been the occupation of Marbella, where he left a garrison which\r\nmaintained itself for a considerable time. It was no doubt something\r\nto have detained Girard and Sebastiani in the remote mountain of the\r\nsouth for a full month, when they were much needed by Soult in other\r\ndirections. Yet the evil results of Lacy’s timid manœuvres and hasty\r\nflight upon the morale of the insurgents might have been sufficiently\r\ngreat to counterbalance these small advantages, if the Serranos had\r\nbeen less tough and resolute. It is surprising to find that they did\r\nnot lose courage, but kept the rising afoot with undiminished energy,\r\nbeing apparently confirmed in their self-confidence by the poor show\r\nmade by the regular army, rather than disheartened at the ineffective\r\nsuccour sent them from Cadiz. Despite of all the efforts of Soult’s\r\nflying columns, they could not be entirely dispersed, though they\r\nwere hunted a hundred times from valley to valley. The power of the\r\nviceroy of Andalusia stopped short at the foot-hills, though his\r\ndragoons kept the plains in subjection. Every time that Ronda and the\r\nother isolated garrisons in the mountains had to be revictualled,\r\nthe convoy had to fight its way to its destination through swarms of\r\n‘sniping’ insurgents[378].\r\n\r\n  [376] Martinien’s lists show that the 40th regiment of Girard’s\r\n  division lost four officers at Albondonates, and the 64th the\r\n  same number at Grazalema--so the skirmishes must have been fairly\r\n  vigorous.\r\n\r\n  [377] That Lacy’s force was not so entirely destroyed as Napier\r\n  implies is shown by the fact that many of the same regiments\r\n  could be utilized for the subsequent expedition to the Condado de\r\n  Niebla.\r\n\r\n  [378] For illustrative anecdotes of warfare in the Serrania de\r\n  Ronda, see the autobiography of Rocca of the 2nd Hussars, who was\r\n  busy in this region in the spring and summer of 1810.\r\n\r\nThe Regency had not yet done with Lacy and his expeditionary force.\r\nAfter they had lain for some time under the walls of Gibraltar, they\r\nwere re-embarked and taken back to Cadiz, from where a short time\r\nafter they were dispatched for a raid in the Condado de Niebla. In\r\nthis region, where Copons was already in arms, the French forces,\r\nunder Remond and the Duke of Aremberg, were so weak that the\r\nJunta believed that Lacy’s division would easily clear the whole\r\ncountry-side of the enemy. Its liberation would be most valuable,\r\nbecause Cadiz was wont to draw both corn and cattle from the lands\r\nbetween the Rio Tinto and Guadiana, and had felt bitterly the want of\r\nits accustomed supplies since the war had been carried thither.\r\n\r\nLacy landed in the Bay of Huelva on August 23 with nearly 3,000 men.\r\nHe had the good fortune to meet and to overcome in succession two\r\nsmall French columns which marched against him from Moguer and from\r\nSan Juan del Puerto. Thereupon the Duke of Aremberg--whose whole\r\nforce in this region was less than 1,500 men (two battalions of the\r\n103rd of the line and the 27th Chasseurs)--evacuated Niebla and fell\r\nback on Seville. Copons, who had been told to join Lacy but had\r\nfailed to receive his instructions in time, pursued a separate French\r\ncolumn under General Remond for some distance, but was soon stopped\r\nby the news that a large force was moving against him, to repair\r\nthis check to the French arms. Lacy, meanwhile, to the surprise and\r\ndisgust of the inhabitants of the Condado, re-embarked on August\r\n29 and went back to Cadiz, professing to regard the purpose of his\r\nexpedition as completed. He had this much justification, that the\r\nnews of his raid had induced Soult to send out against him, at a most\r\ncritical moment, the main body of Gazan’s division, which marched to\r\nNiebla, vainly sought the expeditionary force, and returned to its\r\nbase after wasting a fortnight. But a larger garrison was now left in\r\nWestern Andalusia, Copons was hunted more vigorously than before, and\r\ncruel reprisals were made on the inhabitants of Moguer and Huelva,\r\nwho had aided Lacy.\r\n\r\nFeeble as it had been, Lacy’s raid on the Condado had staved off a\r\nserious danger to the Spanish Army of Estremadura, by forcing Soult\r\nto detach Gazan against him, at a moment when he was concentrating\r\nthe 5th Corps for a blow at La Romana, and was already engaged in\r\nactive operations against the Marquis. A complete change had taken\r\nplace in the situation in Estremadura at the end of July, when\r\nReynier, acting under orders from Masséna[379], had marched northward\r\nfrom his old base at Merida and Medellin, and crossed the Tagus at\r\nthe ferry of Alconetar above the broken bridge of Alcantara[380]\r\n(July 16). This removal of the whole 2nd Corps to the north, followed\r\n(as we have already seen) by the corresponding transference of Hill’s\r\nBritish force from Portalegre to the neighbourhood of Castello\r\nBranco, had left La Romana at Badajoz with no enemy in front of him,\r\nand had caused a complete rupture of communications between the\r\nFrench Army of Andalusia and the Army of Portugal, who could for\r\nthe future only hear of each other by the circuitous route through\r\nMadrid, since that by Almaraz was closed.\r\n\r\n  [379] See pp. 246-7 of this volume.\r\n\r\n  [380] Not marked in any contemporary map that I have seen. It is\r\n  situated, however, opposite the junction of the River Almonte\r\n  with the Tagus, about eighteen miles above Alcantara, near the\r\n  ancient ruined bridge of Mantible.\r\n\r\nSoult had now thrown upon his hands, to his immense disgust, the\r\ntask of containing the whole of La Romana’s force, which Reynier had\r\nbeen keeping in check from March till July. Accordingly he called\r\nback from the Sierra de Ronda the division of Girard, wishing to\r\nreunite the whole 5th Corps for the protection of the northern\r\napproaches to Seville. He was only just in time, for La Romana had\r\nseen his opportunity, and had resolved to concentrate his army for\r\na demonstration against Andalusia, which seemed to offer great\r\ntemptations while nothing but the solitary division of Gazan stood\r\nbetween him and Seville, and that division, moreover, was weakened by\r\nthe detachments under Remond and Aremberg which lay in the Condado de\r\nNiebla. Accordingly the Marquis, leaving Charles O’Donnell to watch\r\nReynier on the Tagus, and another division to guard Badajoz, marched\r\nwith his cavalry and the infantry of La Carrera[381] and Ballasteros\r\nto invade Andalusia. He also told Copons to come up to reinforce him\r\nwith his levies from the lower Guadiana. Even without the help of the\r\nlatter, who never succeeded in reaching him, he had 10,000 foot and\r\n1,000 horse. But La Romana was always unlucky when he fought: just\r\nas he started, Girard had returned from Ronda to Seville. On hearing\r\nthat the Army of Estremadura was on the move, Soult pushed the newly\r\nreturned division, strengthened by part of Gazan’s regiments and a\r\nbrigade of cavalry, out towards the passes of the Morena. On August\r\n11, Girard, with about 7,000 bayonets and 1,200 sabres, encountered\r\nLa Romana at Villagarcia, just outside the town of Llerena. The\r\nSpaniards were eager to fight, believing that they had only to deal\r\nwith some fraction of Gazan’s division; the news of Girard’s return\r\nfrom Ronda had not yet reached them. They got involved in a severe\r\ncombat, were beaten, and were forced back to Zafra and Almendralejo,\r\nwith a loss of 600 men--triple that of the French.\r\n\r\n  [381] Which had just rejoined him from the north, after the fall\r\n  of Ciudad Rodrigo. See p. 253.\r\n\r\nSoult then strengthened Girard’s column, placed Mortier in command,\r\nand bade him push for Badajoz. But just as the Duke of Treviso was\r\npreparing to advance, the news of Lacy’s disembarkation at Moguer\r\narrived. There were hardly any troops left in Seville, wherefore\r\nSoult hastily recalled from Mortier such of Gazan’s regiments as\r\nwere with him, and nearly all the cavalry, and sent them off against\r\nLacy. Girard’s division retired from Zafra and took up a defensive\r\nposition in the passes covering Seville. Thus a dangerous crisis was\r\navoided, for if the whole 5th Corps had marched on Badajoz in August,\r\nand had driven back La Romana into Portugal, Wellington’s flank in\r\nthe Alemtejo would have been left exposed. There was no longer a\r\nBritish division south of the Tagus to support the Spanish Army of\r\nEstremadura, since Hill had transferred himself to Castello Branco\r\nin order to ‘contain’ Reynier. Of regular troops, indeed, Wellington\r\nhad nothing left on the Alemtejo frontier save Madden’s brigade of\r\nPortuguese horse, and the two infantry regiments of the same nation,\r\nwho formed part of the garrison of Elvas. Hence he was much troubled\r\nat La Romana’s tendency to take the offensive against Seville, and\r\nrepeatedly begged him to content himself with defensive operations,\r\nand not to attract the notice of Soult. For the Duke of Dalmatia, if\r\nleft alone, had enough to occupy his attention in Andalusia, yet, if\r\nprovoked, might abandon some outlying part of his viceroyalty, in\r\norder to concentrate a force which might crush the Estremaduran army,\r\nand then execute that diversion against Portugal south of the Tagus\r\nwhich Wellington so much dreaded[382].\r\n\r\n  [382] See Wellington, _Dispatches_, vi. p. 343. ‘I am a little\r\n  anxious about Mortier’s movement into Estremadura, not on account\r\n  of the progress he can make, but because I think that the Marquis\r\n  de la Romana is inclined to fight a battle. If we could only\r\n  avoid a disaster for some time, I hope we may do some good at\r\n  last.’ Cf. also vi. pp. 348 and 393.\r\n\r\nYet despite the warning that he had received at the combat of\r\nVillagarcia, and, despite of his ally’s entreaties, La Romana\r\nrenewed in September the project that had cost him so dear in\r\nAugust. Learning that the passes in front of Seville were once more\r\nweakly held by the French, he began to move his army southward in\r\ndetachments, till he had gathered a heavy force at Guadalcanal and\r\nMonasterio. Attributing his misfortunes in the last month to the\r\nweakness of his cavalry, he brought down with him Madden’s Portuguese\r\nhorsemen, a weak brigade of 800 men[383], which Wellington had put\r\nat his disposition, not foreseeing that its existence would add to\r\nthe inclination which the Marquis felt for offensive demonstrations.\r\nThe inevitable result followed. Disquieted by the activity of the\r\nEstremaduran army--its raiding parties had already pressed as far\r\nas Santa Olalla on the Seville road, and Constantina on the Cordova\r\nroad--Soult ordered Mortier to concentrate the main body of the 5th\r\nCorps at Ronquillo, and to attack the enemy. La Romana gave back\r\nat once, evacuating the passes, but his rearguard was overtaken at\r\nFuente Cantos, behind Monasterio, by the French horse (Sept. 15). His\r\ncavalry, under La Carrera[384], turned to bay to cover the retreat,\r\nbut was charged and scattered with heavy loss by Briche’s Chasseurs,\r\nwho captured the battery that accompanied it, and enveloped a large\r\nmass of the beaten horsemen, who would have been forced to surrender\r\nif Madden’s Portuguese, charging at the right moment, and with great\r\nvigour, had not checked the French advance, and given time for the\r\nrouted brigades to save themselves in the hills. Madden, though\r\npursued by the French reserves, made a steady and successful retreat,\r\nwith small loss. The Spaniards, however, left behind them six guns\r\nand 500 killed and wounded, while the French loss had not exceeded\r\n100.\r\n\r\n  [383] The brigade consisted of three squadrons each of the 5th\r\n  and 8th regiments, and two of the 3rd. Beresford’s report to\r\n  Wellington speaks of their behaviour in the highest terms. See\r\n  Soriano da Luz, vol. iii. pp. 66-7.\r\n\r\n  [384] Dissatisfied with all his cavalry officers, La Romana had\r\n  removed La Carrera to the command of the horse, making over his\r\n  old infantry division to Carlos d’España.\r\n\r\nMortier then pursued La Romana to Zafra, and pushed his advanced\r\ncavalry as far as Fuente del Maestre, only thirty miles from Badajoz.\r\nThus the situation which Wellington most dreaded had come into\r\nexistence once again: a considerable French army was moving into\r\ncentral Estremadura, and threatening the Alemtejo frontier south of\r\nthe Tagus, at a moment when every man of the Anglo-Portuguese field\r\narmy was fully employed in Beira by the advance of Masséna. But\r\nagain, as in August, Mortier did not push his advantage, though La\r\nRomana actually retired behind the Tagus to Montijo, after raising\r\nthe garrison of Badajoz to its full strength, and left the Duke\r\nof Treviso the opportunity of laying siege either to that city,\r\nto Olivenza, or even to Elvas, if he should so please. But the\r\ngoverning fact in all the operations of Soult and his lieutenants at\r\nthis period was, as we have already pointed out, that if any great\r\nconcentration of the French for offensive purposes took place, it\r\nwas only made by withdrawing the garrison troops from some one of\r\nthe many disturbed regions of Andalusia. When the whole 5th Corps\r\nwas united, and had advanced to Zafra, Western Andalusia was almost\r\nstripped of troops. Indeed, at Seville itself, Soult had nothing\r\nbut his new Spanish levies, and the convalescents from his central\r\nhospital, together with some detachments escorting convoys which\r\nhappened to be passing through the city, and had been detained in\r\norder to add a few hundred bayonets to its garrison. When, therefore,\r\nCopons began to make himself felt once more in the Condado de Niebla,\r\nand a second raiding expedition from Cadiz landed at Huelva, Soult\r\nfelt very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHis perturbation of mind was increased by news from the East:\r\nSebastiani at this moment had been molested by demonstrations of\r\nthe Spanish Army of Murcia against his flank. Blake had returned in\r\nAugust from Cadiz to inspect the section of his forces which he had\r\nleft behind under Freire, and which he had not seen since April. He\r\nhad pushed reconnaissances to Huescar in the kingdom of Granada,\r\nhad sent supplies to aid the insurgents of the Alpujarras, and was\r\nbeginning to stir up a new rising on the side of Jaen. This provoked\r\nSebastiani to concentrate the larger part of the 4th Corps, and to\r\nmarch against him with 8,000 men[385]. Blake gave back before his\r\nenemy as far as the neighbourhood of Murcia, where he had prepared\r\na fortified position by inundating the Huerta, or suburban plain,\r\nwhich is watered by many canals drawn from the river Segura, and\r\nby stockading all the villages. Fourteen thousand regulars, with\r\na powerful artillery, held the approaches, while a mass of armed\r\npeasantry hung around Sebastiani’s flanks. The French, however, only\r\nadvanced as far as Lebrilla, twelve miles from Murcia, and then\r\nhalted (Aug. 28). Sebastiani, after reconnoitring Blake’s line,\r\nthought it too powerful to be meddled with, and retired two days\r\nlater towards his base, much harassed by the peasantry on his way.\r\nBut during the three weeks that it took for the French general to\r\nconcentrate his field-force, to march on Murcia, and to return,\r\nall had gone to wrack and ruin behind him. The insurgents of the\r\nAlpujarras had captured the important seaport towns of Almunecar and\r\nMotril, and had garrisoned their castles with the aid of English guns\r\nsent from Gibraltar. The people of the Sierra de Alhama had cut the\r\nroads between Malaga and Granada, and 4,000 mountaineers had attacked\r\nGranada itself; they were defeated outside its gates by the garrison\r\non Sept. 4, but were still hanging about its vicinity.\r\n\r\n  [385] The 4th Corps was now a little stronger than it had been in\r\n  the spring, the 32nd regiment, 2,000 strong, having joined from\r\n  Madrid. But it was still short of its German division, which now\r\n  lay in La Mancha, but had never crossed the Sierra Morena.\r\n\r\nThe news of all these troubles had reached Soult while Sebastiani\r\nwas quite out of touch, lost to sight in the kingdom of Murcia. They\r\nundoubtedly had their part in inducing the Marshal to recall Mortier\r\nand the 5th Corps from Estremadura. He once more divided its two\r\ndivisions, drawing back Gazan to Seville to form his central reserve,\r\nwhile Girard watched the passes as before. Meanwhile Copons had\r\nalready been beaten in the Condado by the column of General Remond\r\n(Sept. 15), and Sebastiani on his return cleared the neighbourhood\r\nof Granada and Malaga of insurgents, and drove the untameable bands\r\nof the Alpujarras to take refuge in their mountains. Motril and\r\nAlmunecar were both recovered. Thus the storm passed, as soon as the\r\ntwo French expeditionary forces under Mortier and Sebastiani returned\r\nonce more to their usual garrison-posts.\r\n\r\nOnly two more incidents remain to be chronicled in the Andalusian\r\ncampaign of 1810. Campbell, the governor of Gibraltar, had\r\nresolved--somewhat too late--to lend a small detachment to aid the\r\nGranadan insurgents. The plan which he concerted with the Spanish\r\ngovernor of Ceuta was that Lord Blayney with two British battalions\r\nfrom the Gibraltar garrison--the 82nd and 89th [_erratum_: “Lord\r\nBlayney’s force had only a half-battalion, not a whole battalion of\r\nthe 89th, but contained 4 companies of foreign chasseurs”], and a\r\nSpanish regiment (Imperial de Toledo) from Ceuta, 2,200 men in all,\r\nshould be thrown on shore at Fuengirola, twenty miles on the nearer\r\nside of Malaga, where there was a small French garrison and a dépôt\r\nof stores, which was serving for a brigade then engaged in the siege\r\nof Marbella, the town which had been garrisoned by Lacy in June[386],\r\nand which was still holding out gallantly in October.\r\n\r\n  [386] See p. 328 of this chapter.\r\n\r\nIt was calculated that, on hearing of a descent at Fuengirola,\r\nSebastiani would come with the larger part of the garrison of\r\nMalaga to relieve the fort. But the moment that he was known to be\r\nnearing the expeditionary force, Lord Blayney was to re-embark and\r\nto make a dash at Malaga itself, which he could reach more swiftly\r\nby water than Sebastiani by land. Secret partisans within the city\r\nwere ready to take arms, and the peasantry of the Sierra de Alhama\r\nwere also enlisted in the enterprise. The scheme seems liable to\r\nmany criticisms--the whole was at the mercy of the winds and waves\r\nof stormy October: what would happen if the weather was too rough to\r\nallow of re-embarkation, or of easy landing at Malaga? And if Malaga\r\nwere captured for the moment, for how long could 2,000 regulars,\r\nbacked by a mass of undisciplined insurgents, hold it against the\r\nwhole of Sebastiani’s corps, which would be hurled upon it at short\r\nnotice? The expedition, however, was not actually wrecked on either\r\nof these dangers, but ruined by the folly of its chief. Lord Blayney\r\nlanded successfully on October 13, and laid siege to Fuengirola,\r\nwhich was held by 150 Poles under a Captain Milokosiewitz. Instead of\r\nmaking the attack a mere demonstration, he brought some 12-pounders\r\nashore, and set to work to batter the castle in all seriousness.\r\nFinding its walls commencing to crumble, he held on for two days,\r\nthough, if he had reflected, he must have remembered that the\r\ngarrison of Malaga might be with him at any moment. He was busily\r\npreparing for an assault, when Sebastiani suddenly fell upon him\r\nwith 3,000 men from the rear. Apparently the English commander had\r\nneglected to keep up any watch on the side of the inland, and the\r\npeasantry had failed to send any intelligence of the fact that the\r\nFrench were on the move. The besiegers, taken entirely by surprise,\r\nand distracted also by a sortie of the little garrison, were rolled\r\ndown to the sea-shore in confusion. Lord Blayney--a short-sighted\r\nman--rode in among some French whom he mistook for Spaniards, and\r\nwas made prisoner in the most ignominious fashion. The Spanish\r\nregiment got off with little loss: it had kept its ranks, and forced\r\nits way to the boats after beating off an attack. The 82nd was\r\npartly on shipboard at the moment of the combat, and the companies\r\nwhich were on shore saved themselves by a steady rearguard action.\r\nBut the battalion of the 89th was half destroyed, losing over 200\r\nprisoners besides some forty killed. The utter incapacity of the\r\nBritish commander was best shown by the fact that if he had but\r\ncarried out the plan on which he was acting, he would certainly have\r\ncaptured Malaga--for Sebastiani had left only 300 men in the city\r\nwhen he marched on Fuengirola, and, if the expeditionary force had\r\nre-embarked twenty-four hours before the disaster, it would have\r\nfound the place practically undefended, and Sebastiani a long day’s\r\nmarch away, and incapable of returning in time to save it[387].\r\n\r\n  [387] Lord Blayney, a humorous person save when the absurdities\r\n  of his own generalship were in question, wrote an interesting\r\n  narrative of his ‘Forced Journey to France,’ which contains one\r\n  of the best accounts of the state of Madrid under King Joseph’s\r\n  government, as well as some curious notes on the state of the\r\n  English prisoners at Verdun in 1811-13.\r\n\r\nThe very last military event of the year 1810 on the Andalusian\r\nside was a disaster far worse than that of Lord Blayney--suffered\r\nby a general whose almost unbroken series of defeats from Medina\r\nde Rio Seco down to Belchite ought to have taught him by this time\r\nthe advantages of caution, and the doubtful policy of risking a\r\ndemoralized army in a fight upon open ground. When Sebastiani retired\r\nfrom the kingdom of Murcia in the first days of September, Blake had\r\nbrought back his army to its old positions on the frontier of that\r\nrealm. Seven weeks later, finding the French line in front of him\r\nvery weak, he resolved to try a demonstration in force, or perhaps\r\neven a serious stroke against the force of the enemy in Granada. On\r\nNovember 2 he crossed the Murcian border, with 8,000 foot and 1,000\r\nhorse, and occupied Cullar.\r\n\r\nOn the next day he was at the gates of Baza, where there were four\r\nbattalions of the French force which covered Granada[388]. But on\r\nthe next morning General Milhaud rode up with a powerful body of\r\nhorsemen, the greater part of his own division of Dragoons and the\r\nPolish Lancers from Sebastiani’s corps-cavalry, some 1,300 men\r\nin all. Though he had only 2,000 infantry to back him, Milhaud\r\ndetermined to fight at once. Blake’s army invited an attack; it was\r\nadvancing down the high-road with the cavalry deployed in front, one\r\ndivision of infantry supporting it, while a second division was some\r\nmiles to the rear, on the hills which separate the plain of Baza\r\nfrom the upland of the Sierra de Oria. A rearguard of 2,000 men was\r\nstill at Cullar, ten miles from the scene of action. The situation\r\nmuch resembled that of Suchet’s combat of Margalef, and led to the\r\nsame results. For Milhaud’s squadrons, charging fiercely along and\r\non each side of the road, completely routed Blake’s cavalry, and\r\ndrove it back on to the leading infantry division, which broke, and\r\nwas badly cut up before its remnants could take shelter with the\r\nother division in reserve on the hill behind. Blake gave the order\r\nfor an instant retreat, and Milhaud could not follow far among the\r\nrocks and defiles. But he had captured a battery of artillery and a\r\nthousand prisoners, and killed or wounded some 500 men more, in the\r\nfew minutes during which the engagement lasted. The French cavalry\r\nlost no more than 200 men. The infantry had hardly fired a shot.\r\nBlake, not being pursued, retired only as far as the Venta de Bahul\r\non the other side of Cullar, and remained on the Murcian border,\r\ncured for a time of his mania for taking the offensive at the head of\r\na demoralized army.\r\n\r\n  [388] From the 32nd and 58th Line, Rey’s brigade of Sebastiani’s\r\n  corps. The 88th, in _Victoires et Conquêtes_, xx. 127, and\r\n  Arteche is a misprint. That regiment was with Girard in the\r\n  Sierra Morena, 150 miles away.\r\n\r\nThus ended the inconclusive campaign of 1810 in Andalusia--the\r\nFrench on the last day of the year held almost precisely the same\r\nlimits of territory that they had occupied on the 1st of March. They\r\nhad beaten the enemy in four or five considerable actions, yet had\r\ngained nothing thereby. They were beginning to understand that Cadiz\r\nwas impregnable, and that the complete subjection of the mountains\r\nof the South and East was a far more serious task than had been at\r\nfirst supposed. Things indeed had come to a deadlock, and Soult kept\r\nreporting to his master that another 25,000 men would be required to\r\nenable him to complete his task. Almost as many battalions belonging\r\nto the 1st, 4th, and 5th Corps as would have made up that force had\r\nbeen sent by the Emperor into Spain. They were intended to join\r\ntheir regiments in the end, but meanwhile they had been distracted\r\ninto the 8th and 9th Corps, and were marching in the direction of\r\nPortugal, when Soult wished to see them on the Guadalquivir[389].\r\nVery little of the mass of reinforcements which had been poured\r\ninto the Peninsula in the spring of 1810 had come his way. While the\r\nwhole battalions had been sent away with Junot or Drouet, the drafts\r\nin smaller units had been largely intercepted by the generals along\r\nthe line of communication. There were 4,000 of such recruits detained\r\nin New Castile alone, and formed into ‘provisional battalions’ to\r\ngarrison Madrid and its neighbourhood. King Joseph must not be\r\nblamed too much for thus stopping them on their way: he had been\r\nleft with an utterly inadequate force, when the Emperor turned\r\noff everything on to the direction of Portugal. During the summer\r\nand autumn of 1810 there were with him only two French infantry\r\nregiments[390], the same number of light cavalry regiments[391],\r\nLahoussaye’s weak division of dragoons[392], and the German division\r\nof the 4th Corps less than 4,000 strong, over and above his own guard\r\nand untrustworthy ‘juramentado’ battalions[393]. The royal troops\r\nnumbered about 7,000 men, the other units, including Soult’s detained\r\ndrafts, about 12,000: with them Joseph had to garrison Madrid, Avila,\r\nSegovia, Toledo, and Almaraz, and hold down all New Castile and La\r\nMancha--which last province was described at the time as ‘populated\r\nsolely by beggars and brigands’. He had the duty of maintaining the\r\nsole and very circuitous line of communication between Soult and\r\nMasséna, which, after Reynier went north in July, had to be worked\r\nvia Almaraz. He was frequently annoyed not only by the Empecinado\r\nand other guerrilleros, but by Villacampa, who descended from\r\nhigher Aragon into the Cuenca region, and by Blake’s cavalry, which\r\noften raided La Mancha. But his great fear was lest La Romana or\r\nWellington should send troops up the vast gap left between Reynier at\r\nZarza and Coria and Mortier in the Sierra Morena; there was nothing\r\nbut Lahoussaye’s dragoons and two infantry battalions in the whole\r\ndistrict about Almaraz and Talavera, where such a blow would have\r\nfallen. It was small wonder that he felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n  [389] The 8th Corps had in its ranks the 4th battalions of the\r\n  following regiments whose first three battalions were in the\r\n  south of Spain, and belonged to the 1st, 4th, or 5th corps--the\r\n  28th, 34th, and 75th. But the 9th Corps was almost entirely\r\n  composed of 4th battalions of the corps of Victor, Sebastiani,\r\n  and Mortier, including those of the 8th, 24th, 45th, 54th, 63rd,\r\n  94th, 95th, 96th Line, and 16th and 27th Léger, of the 1st corps,\r\n  and of the 17th Léger, and 40th, 88th, 100th and 103rd Line of\r\n  the 5th Corps.\r\n\r\n  [390] 28th and 75th, the remaining brigade of the 1st Division of\r\n  the 4th Corps, which never joined Sebastiani in Andalusia.\r\n\r\n  [391] 26th Chasseurs and 3rd Dutch Hussars.\r\n\r\n  [392] 17th, 18th, 19th, and 27th Dragoons, only two squadrons\r\n  each--only 1,300 men.\r\n\r\n  [393] As a sample of their behaviour it may be mentioned that the\r\n  whole guard of the south gate of Toledo once marched off to join\r\n  the insurgents, officers and all.\r\n\r\nBut military sources of disquietude formed only the smaller half of\r\nKing Joseph’s troubles at this date. His political vexations, which\r\nengrossed a much larger portion of his time and energy, must be dealt\r\nwith elsewhere. They will be relegated to the same chapter which\r\ntreats of the new development of Spanish politics consequent on the\r\nlong-delayed meeting of the Cortes in the winter of 1810-11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI\r\n\r\nBUSSACO AND TORRES VEDRAS (SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMASSÉNA’S ADVANCE TO BUSSACO (SEPTEMBER 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Almeida Masséna waited much longer than Wellington\r\nhad anticipated. The reasons for his delay were the usual ones\r\nthat were always forthcoming when a French army had to advance\r\nin the Peninsula--want of transport and penury of supplies. The\r\nMarshal had just discovered that the country-side in front of\r\nhim had already been depopulated by Wellington’s orders, and\r\nthat the only inhabitants that were to be met would be the armed\r\nOrdenança, who were already shooting at his vedettes and attacking\r\nhis foraging parties. He was inclined to treat them as brigands;\r\nhis Provost-marshal, Colonel Pavetti, having been surprised and\r\ncaptured along with five gendarmes of his escort by the villagers\r\nof Nava d’Avel on September 5, he caused the place to be burned,\r\nshot the one or two male inhabitants who could be caught, and\r\nissued a proclamation stating that no quarter would be given to\r\ncombatants without uniforms. This provoked two stiff letters from\r\nWellington[394], who wrote to say that the Ordenança were an integral\r\npart of the Portuguese military forces, and that, if they wore no\r\nuniforms, the Marshal should remember that many of the revolutionary\r\nbands which he had commanded in the old war of 1792-7 were no\r\nbetter equipped: ‘vous devez vous souvenir que vous-même vous avez\r\naugmenté la gloire de l’armée Française en commandant des soldats qui\r\nn’avaient pas d’uniforme.’ If Ordenança were shot as ‘brigands and\r\nhighway robbers’ in obedience to the proclamation of September 7,\r\nit was certain that French stragglers and foragers would be knocked\r\non the head, and not taken prisoners, by the enraged peasantry. At\r\npresent the number of them sent in to the British head quarters by\r\nthe Portuguese irregulars proved that the laws of war were being\r\nobserved. Masséna replied that Pavetti had been ambushed by men who\r\nhid their arms, and ran in upon him and his escort while he was\r\npeaceably asking his way. His letter then went off at a tangent, to\r\ndiscuss high politics, and to declare that he was not the enemy of\r\nthe Portuguese but of the perfidious British government, &c., &c.\r\nFinally he complained that the Arganil and Trancoso militia, whom he\r\nhad sent home after the fall of Almeida, had taken up arms again; if\r\ncaught, ‘leur sort sera funeste’[395]. The last statement Wellington\r\ndenied; he said that the capitulation had been annulled by the French\r\nthemselves, when they debauched the 24th regiment, and detained 600\r\nof the militia to form a battalion of pioneers, but stated that as\r\na matter of fact the militia battalions had not been re-embodied.\r\nThe French continued to shoot the Ordenança, and the Ordenança soon\r\nbegan to reply by torturing as well as hanging French stragglers;\r\nWellington forbade but could not prevent retaliation.\r\n\r\n  [394] Wellington to Masséna, Sept. 9 and Sept. 24.\r\n\r\n  [395] Masséna to Wellington, Sept. 14, from Fort Concepcion\r\n  (_Archives du Ministère de la Guerre_).\r\n\r\nIn his dispatch to Berthier of September 8[396], Masséna explains\r\nthat the depopulation of the district in front of him, and the fact\r\nthat the Ordenança had taken arms throughout the country-side, have\r\ncompelled him to make an enormous provision of food for his army.\r\nSince the land has been swept bare, he must collect fifteen or twenty\r\ndays’ rations for the 6th and 8th Corps. ‘Each day demonstrates the\r\nnecessity of this more clearly, but each day makes it more evident\r\nthat we are not obtaining as much as our activity deserves. The small\r\namount of transport available, and the destruction by the Spanish\r\nbrigands of several convoys of corn which were coming up from the\r\nprovince of Valladolid, have occasioned delay in the accumulation\r\nof the stores. An additional vexation is that while it was reported\r\nthat we had captured 300,000 rations of biscuit in Almeida, there\r\nturn out really to be only 120,000 rations.’ But it was the loss\r\nof draught-beasts that was the most serious trouble; to his great\r\nregret Masséna had to cut down the artillery of each division from\r\ntwelve to eight guns, for want of horses, with a similar reduction\r\nof the caissons. Every animal that could be procured was given over\r\nto the train, yet it could not carry even the fifteen days’ food\r\nwhich the Marshal considered the minimum that he could afford to\r\ntake with him. There was also a deficiency in cartridges for the\r\ninfantry, for whom 1,200,000 rounds were only procured by setting the\r\nartificers of the train to make up as many as was possible from the\r\npowder captured at Ciudad Rodrigo. Finally Masséna explains that the\r\nlosses in the two late sieges, the necessity for garrisoning Almeida\r\nand Rodrigo, and the effects of a sickly summer, have reduced the\r\ntwo corps and the reserve cavalry under his hand to 42,000 or 45,000\r\nmen, so that he must incorporate Reynier with his main army, in order\r\nto get a sufficient force concentrated for the invasion. When this\r\nhas been done, he will have no force to leave behind to guard his\r\ncommunications, and Kellermann and Serras are too much occupied to\r\nspare a man for that purpose. The Spaniards will press in between\r\nthe army and Salamanca the moment that the troops have entered the\r\nPortuguese mountains. He will advance, therefore, on September 15,\r\nbut only with grave apprehension for his rear, and he begs that\r\nat all costs a division of the 9th Corps should be brought up to\r\nSalamanca. He had been promised long ago that this should be done,\r\nbut no signs of Drouet’s arrival were yet visible.\r\n\r\n  [396] In the _Archives du Ministère de la Guerre_, see Appendix\r\n  to this vol.\r\n\r\nReynier accordingly was called up, at last, to join the main army; he\r\nleft Zarza and Penamacor on the 10th of September, crossed the Pass\r\nof Perales, and on the 12th was at Alfayates, with cavalry in front\r\nat Sabugal. Hill, always vigilant, perceived Reynier’s movement as\r\nsoon as it had taken place. On the 12th his corps quitted Sarzedas,\r\nleaving nothing behind in the Castello Branco country save Lecor’s\r\nPortuguese at Fundão, who were ordered to follow, unless Reynier\r\nshould send back any detachments to the south side of the Sierra de\r\nGata. Leith started from the banks of the Zezere three days later,\r\nand on the 20th the two divisions were drawing near to Wellington’s\r\nrear in the valley of the Mondego, Hill being at Espinhal that day,\r\nand Leith (who had less distance to cover) a march further to the\r\nfront, at Foz d’Aronce. Wellington’s concentration on the Alva must\r\nobviously be completed before the French could strike.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 1810, Ney and Junot broke up from the encampments\r\nin front of Almeida, while Reynier drew in close to the main body by\r\nmarching up from Sabugal towards Guarda. It was clear that the attack\r\nof the French was to be delivered along the line of the Mondego, but\r\nwhether by its southern or its northern bank Wellington could not yet\r\nbe sure, though he was under the impression that the former would be\r\nthe chosen route, since the _chaussée_ from Almeida by Celorico and\r\nPonte de Murcella is good for a Portuguese road, while the mountain\r\ntrack by Trancoso and Vizeu is abominable. Yet one of the three\r\ncolumns of the French pointed from the first towards the north bank:\r\nwhile Ney took his way by Freixadas and Alverca towards Celorico,\r\nJunot was reported to have turned off from the main road at Valverde,\r\nand to be marching by Pinhel westward or north-westward. What Reynier\r\nwould do after reaching Guarda remained yet to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe total force which Masséna had drawn together for the invasion\r\nwas 65,000[397] officers and men. He had left behind a regiment of\r\ndragoons and four battalions of infantry to take care of Almeida\r\nand Ciudad Rodrigo. In the latter place he had also deposited\r\nhis siege-train, with the considerable body of artillerymen\r\nbelonging to it. Brennier and Cacault commanded at the two places\r\nrespectively. They had between them some 3,500 men, a force which\r\nperceptibly diminished the army of invasion, yet was insufficient\r\nto do more than to hold the two fortresses. Gardanne, with five\r\nsquadrons of dragoons, was to maintain touch between them. Not\r\na man would be available from the garrisons for service against\r\nSpanish or Portuguese insurgents--indeed both Almeida and Rodrigo\r\nwere practically under blockade from the moment that the main army\r\nwent forward, and were destined to learn nothing of its doings\r\nfor many days. Wellington’s _cordon_ of Ordenança proved perfectly\r\nefficient[398].\r\n\r\n  [397] For details see the Tables in the Appendix. All the troops\r\n  left behind have been rigidly deducted. The figures given by\r\n  Fririon, 59,806, are not quite exact, see proofs in Appendix: he\r\n  makes some troops enter Portugal which were left as garrisons,\r\n  and on the other hand omits whole battalions which marched, as if\r\n  they had never existed.\r\n\r\n  [398] The troops left behind were the fifth battalion of\r\n  the 82nd, the fourth battalions of the 15th and 86th, and a\r\n  provisional battalion of convalescents, or about 2,000 infantry;\r\n  a squadron of the 3rd Dragoons (157 men), the whole of the 10th\r\n  Dragoons (718 men) under Gardanne, and some 800 men belonging to\r\n  the siege-train and park.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 15th the 2nd Corps had reached Guarda, from\r\nwhich it drove out a picket of the 16th Light Dragoons, who retired\r\ntowards the Mondego. The 6th Corps bivouacked at Freixadas, having\r\npushed back from it two squadrons of the 14th Light Dragoons and the\r\nGerman Hussars. The 8th Corps, which had to come up from the Azava,\r\npassed Almeida and slept beyond the Coa. In its rear was Montbrun’s\r\nreserve cavalry division, and behind this again the reserve artillery\r\nof the whole army. This column, therefore, was by far the longest and\r\n(owing to the amount of guns and caissons) the most unwieldy of the\r\nthree masses in which the French were marching.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th Wellington hoped to see Masséna’s designs unmasked. But\r\nit proved a day of continued doubt: Reynier left Heudelet’s division\r\nat Guarda, and moved on with Merle’s and the cavalry to Celorico.\r\nHere he met Ney, who had marched from Freixadas to Celorico, and had\r\npushed his light cavalry through it in advance. One body of horsemen\r\ntook a hill road high up the side of the Serra da Estrella, and\r\nreached Linhares, another followed the great _chaussée_ as far as\r\nCarapichina, and detached a squadron or two from that point to seize\r\nthe bridge of Fornos d’Algodres, over which passes the bad side-road\r\nfrom Celorico to Vizeu. Was the enemy about to turn aside on this\r\npath, or to pursue the more probable policy of continuing along\r\nthe _chaussée_ to Ponte de Murcella? Nothing could yet be deduced\r\nfrom Junot’s movements: his heavy column only reached Pinhel that\r\nday: from thence he might either come down to Celorico (the most\r\nprobable course), or make a move towards Oporto, by the high-road\r\nPinhel-Marialva-St. João da Pesqueira, or (what seemed least likely)\r\nfollow the very bad mountain-road from Pinhel by Povoa d’el Rei to\r\nTrancoso and Vizeu. Meanwhile Wellington ordered the continuation of\r\nthe retreat of his army towards Ponte de Murcella and the position\r\nbehind the Alva. The 1st, 3rd, and 4th Divisions retired at their\r\nleisure along the great _chaussée_, by Saragoça and Chamusca: the\r\nLight Division moved parallel to them by the mountain-road Gouvea-San\r\nMartinho-San Romão. The appearance of Ney’s cavalry at Linhares on\r\nthis track made the Commander-in-Chief anxious to have it watched,\r\nsince it was possible that the 6th Corps might use it. The cavalry,\r\nkeeping the rear well guarded, lay this day at Pinhanços on the\r\n_chaussée_ and San Martinho on the hill-road. Head quarters were\r\nat Cea, on the latter line. The only troops now left north of the\r\nMondego, on the route which Junot might possibly follow from Pinhel,\r\nwere a few cavalry-pickets, wherefore the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nconceiving it just possible that the 8th Corps might be intending\r\nto make a dash at Oporto, while the other two kept him in check,\r\nsent urgent letters to Trant, the officer in charge of the militia\r\nof Northern Beira, and to Baccelar, who lay at Oporto with the\r\nmilitia of the Entre-Douro-e-Minho, to take precautions against this\r\nmovement. Trant, from Moimento de Beira, was to feel for Junot’s\r\nfront and flank: Baccelar was to send out some picked battalions,\r\nunder J. Wilson, to the line of the Vouga, and to get into touch with\r\nTrant on his left.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th Masséna’s intentions at last became clear to his\r\nadversary. The cavalry of the 6th Corps crossed the bridge of Fornos,\r\nwhich it had seized on the previous night, and the leading division\r\nof infantry followed it to Juncaes, on the Mondego bank: nothing\r\ncame along the _chaussée_, all the French columns turning off it at\r\nCarapichina, and pursuing the cross-road. Ney’s rear was still at\r\nCelorico, to which place the whole of the 2nd Corps also came up that\r\nday. In the evening the head of the cavalry of the 6th Corps was near\r\nMangualde, many miles along the road north of the Mondego. It seemed\r\nprobable therefore, that a transference of the whole French army to\r\nthe right bank, over the bridge of Fornos, was about to take place.\r\nThis became almost certain when the simultaneous news arrived that\r\nJunot had marched that day from Pinhel not towards Celorico, nor on\r\nthe Oporto road (that by Marialva and St. João da Pesqueira), but by\r\nthe abominable cross-road by Povoa d’el Rei to Trancoso. The 8th and\r\n6th Corps therefore were showing a tendency to converge on Vizeu.\r\nIf so, they must be aiming at reaching Coimbra without touching\r\nWellington’s chosen position of Ponte de Murcella, where he had hoped\r\nto fight. This deduction once made, the British commander had to\r\nrecast his plans. ‘The 2nd and 6th Corps came to Celorico yesterday,’\r\nhe wrote to Leith that evening, ‘and a part of them crossed the\r\nMondego at Fornos. More have crossed this day, while no part of the\r\nenemy’s army has moved this way [i. e. along the great _chaussée_\r\nsouth of the river]. It is generally understood that their whole\r\narmy is between the Douro and the Mondego, and that they are about\r\nto move on Coimbra. I shall have troops in Coimbra to-morrow[399].’\r\nAll the divisions were ordered back at once, so as to be ready on the\r\nLower Mondego to resist the French, when they should appear from the\r\ndirection of Vizeu. Only cavalry were left at Sampayo and Gouvea,\r\nto watch the passage of the Mondego by the French army, and to make\r\ncertain that its rear (i. e. Reynier’s corps) might not be about to\r\nuse the main _chaussée_, a move which was even yet possible.\r\n\r\n  [399] To Cotton and to Leith, both dated Sept. 17.\r\n\r\nMasséna’s resolve to use the route by the north bank of the Mondego\r\nsurprised all British and some French observers at the time, and has\r\nbeen censured by most historical critics. He left a good for a bad\r\nroad: he imposed two extra marches on his army at a moment when it\r\nwas short of provisions. He gave Wellington ample time to call up\r\nHill and Leith, and to select a new position for battle to replace\r\nthat of Ponte de Murcella. The Bussaco hillsides, where the clash\r\nwas to come, were as formidable as those behind the Alva. But these\r\nconsiderations were less obvious to Masséna in 1810 than they appear\r\nto the critic of 1907. It must first be remembered that his maps were\r\nabominable: the actual case of plans used by the staff of the Army of\r\nPortugal is preserved[400]: it is that issued by Lopez in 1778, which\r\nin the remoter parts of Portugal not only offers a mere travesty of\r\nthe natural features, but actually marks as existing roads that never\r\nhad been made, and omits others that were actually available. It\r\nshows, moreover, no distinction between _chaussées_, country roads,\r\nand mere mule tracts. Places of considerable importance are misplaced\r\nby several miles, e. g. Almeida is placed on the Coa instead of two\r\nmiles from it: Vizeu is much too far north, as is also Bussaco.\r\nAs far as this map goes, the physical difficulties in the way of\r\nan advance north of the Mondego look no greater than those on the\r\nsouthern bank. But, it may be said, Masséna should have supplemented\r\nthe use of the map by collecting oral information, and by sending\r\nreconnaissances in every direction. He did so, so far as was in\r\nhis power. But exploration far afield was only possible with large\r\nbodies of men, since the Ordenança blocked every road to the isolated\r\nstaff-officer, and the only oral information which was forthcoming\r\nwas defective. Masséna asked for it from Alorna, Pamplona, and the\r\nother Portuguese officers on his staff--there were no less than\r\neighteen of them in all. They were absolutely ignorant of their own\r\ncountry,--a normal thing in the military men of the old Portuguese\r\narmy. Even Pamplona, whose estates lay in the neighbourhood of\r\nCoimbra, gave hopelessly erroneous information about the routes\r\nleading into that town. But, from natural _amour propre_ they avoided\r\nconfessing their ignorance, and, when taken into council by Masséna,\r\ngave him copious but wholly misleading details. They assured him\r\nthat the roads Pinhel-Trancoso-Vizeu and Fornos-Mangualde-Vizeu\r\nwere no worse than other lines of communication, and that the great\r\n_chaussée_ by Sampayo and Ponte de Murcella was crossed by so many\r\ntorrents and climbed so many slopes that it was not preferable to the\r\nroutes north of the river. The news that a formidable position behind\r\nthe Alva had been entrenched had reached the French head quarters;\r\nhence Masséna had fair reasons for taking the route that he selected,\r\nso far as strategy went. It undoubtedly enabled him to turn the line\r\nof the Alva. Moreover, on it lay a large town--Vizeu--from which it\r\nwas hoped that much food would be procured, for the invaders were\r\nstill ignorant of the thoroughness with which Wellington’s plans for\r\ndevastating the country before them had been carried out. Even after\r\nCelorico and Guarda had been found empty of inhabitants, they hardly\r\nbelieved that such a large place as Vizeu, a town of 9,000 souls,\r\nwould be deserted.\r\n\r\n  [400] For a most interesting article on these maps, and all\r\n  that they show, see Mr. T. J. Andrews’s article in the _English\r\n  Historical Review_ for 1901. The maps, captured at Vittoria, are\r\n  now in the Library of Queen’s College, Belfast.\r\n\r\nMasséna’s mistake became evident to his soldiers on the first day on\r\nwhich he ordered his columns to quit the main-roads and take to the\r\nby-paths. The infantry could still get forward, but the artillery\r\nand waggon-train began to drag behind, to lose horses, and to see\r\nvehicle after vehicle broken, disabled, or abandoned. On the 18th the\r\ninfantry of the 6th Corps got as far as Mangualde on the north bank\r\nof the Mondego, but the artillery was so much delayed in the defile\r\nafter passing Juncaes that it could not catch up the rear of the\r\nmarching troops, and had to be parked at night not many miles beyond\r\nthe bridge of Fornos. The 2nd Corps on reaching this spot found the\r\nroad blocked, and bivouacked with one division beyond the Mondego,\r\nand one still in the rear of the bridge. But the troubles of this\r\ncolumn were nothing to those of the 8th Corps on the miserable road\r\nfrom Pinhel to Vizeu. The journal of the commandant of the artillery\r\nof Junot’s first division, Colonel Noël, may be quoted as giving a\r\nfair description of the marches of the 17th and 18th September:--\r\n\r\n‘After passing the little town of Trancoso, with its battlemented\r\nwall, all the country-side is mountain and rock. There is no road,\r\nonly a stony narrow dangerous track, which the artillery had all the\r\npains in the world to follow without meeting accidents. It is all\r\nsteep ups and downs. I had to march with a party of gunners ahead\r\nof me, with picks and crowbars to enlarge the track. As each arm\r\nonly looked out for itself, the artillery soon got left to the rear,\r\nand deserted by the infantry and cavalry. We only arrived at our\r\nhalting-places late at night, utterly done up. The guns were almost\r\nalways abandoned to themselves; we did not know what road to follow,\r\nhaving no one to give us information but a few infantry stragglers,\r\nwho had themselves lost their way. At noon on the 18th I halted with\r\nmy two batteries after two hours of incessant uphill, to find myself\r\nat the crest of a mountain, with a precipitous descent before me, and\r\nbeyond that another ascent winding upwards, as far as the eye could\r\nreach. We were so exhausted that it was useless to go further that\r\nday, but on the 19th, with a party of gunners always working in front\r\nto enlarge the road, we moved over hill and vale, completely out of\r\ntouch with the army. I had to ride out with four mounted men to hunt\r\nfor any trace of it. At last, in a deserted village, we found an old\r\npeasant who pointed out the road to Vizeu. But it was only on the\r\n20th that we got there.’ Noël’s batteries, it may be remarked, were\r\nmoving all the time between the infantry, which was ahead, and the\r\nGrand Park which was behind them, with Montbrun’s cavalry bringing\r\nup the rear. Yet they were absolutely lost and had to shift for\r\nthemselves without orders or escort[401].\r\n\r\n  [401] _Mémoires_ of Col. Noël, pp. 112-13.\r\n\r\nThe Park fared even worse; when nearing Sotojal, on the 20th, it was\r\nunexpectedly beset by Colonel Trant, who had come down from Moimenta\r\nwith a brigade of his militia and two squadrons of Portuguese regular\r\ncavalry. The Park was escorted by one company of grenadiers, who\r\nmarched at its head, and a battalion of the Irish Legion, who were\r\nfar to the rear, while Montbrun’s immense cavalry column was quite\r\nout of sight. Trant had a great opportunity, for the long file of\r\nvehicles and guns, caught in a narrow road, was almost helpless. But\r\nhe failed to do all that was in his power; his cavalry charged the\r\ncompany at the head of the column and was repulsed. He then filed\r\nhis battalions along the hillside, opened fire on the horses and\r\nmen of the train, and, descending into their midst, captured and\r\ndestroyed some caissons and took some eighty prisoners. But when\r\nthe escort-battalion came hurrying up from the rear, his levies\r\nwere stricken with panic and hastily retired, though they were\r\nstrong enough to have held off the five hundred Irish, and to have\r\nsmashed or rolled over the precipices the greater part of the guns\r\nand waggons. Montbrun’s cavalry did not get up till all was over,\r\nand would have been perfectly useless on the precipitous road, even\r\nif they had arrived earlier. If Trant’s foray had been properly\r\ncarried out, Masséna might have lost his reserve artillery and most\r\nof his provisions--a disaster which might have forced him to turn\r\nback to Almeida. He deserved such a punishment for having marched\r\nhis all-important train on the extreme flank of his army, with an\r\ninsufficient escort[402].\r\n\r\n  [402] A lively account of this affair may be found in Marbot,\r\n  ii. 378; details may not be all trustworthy, but the general\r\n  narrative agrees with Trant’s report, printed in Soriano da Luz,\r\n  vol. vii, Appendix.\r\n\r\nThough Junot’s infantry divisions reached the deserted walls of\r\nVizeu on Sept. 19th and there met the corps of Ney, the divisional\r\nartillery did not arrive till next day, while the reserve artillery,\r\nthe trains and the heavy cavalry were struggling in upon the 21st and\r\n22nd by detachments. For Montbrun had halted the great convoy after\r\nTrant’s attack, and parked it, fearing that the Portuguese might\r\ncome back in greater numbers and give more trouble. When he started\r\nit again, on the 21st, he took care to give it better marching\r\narrangements, and to attach cavalry escorts to each section. But\r\nthis caused much delay, and meanwhile the 8th Corps waited at Vizeu\r\n‘marking time’ and unable to move. Even the 6th Corps remained there\r\ntwo days, waiting while its gun-carriages and cannons were being\r\nrepaired; for the Fornos-Vizeu road, though infinitely less rough\r\nthan that which the 8th Corps and the park had followed, was still\r\nbad enough to shake many vehicles to pieces. The Intendant-General\r\nreported that nineteen caissons carrying 2,900 rations of biscuit\r\nbelonging to the 6th Corps broke down and had to be burnt; the\r\nfood was distributed among the regiments as they passed, with much\r\nconsequent waste[403]. All that Ney could do between the 18th of\r\nSeptember, when he reached Vizeu, and the 21st, was to push forward\r\nan advanced guard to Tondella, fifteen miles down the Vizeu-Coimbra\r\nroad, with an infantry division in support at Fail. Meanwhile the 2nd\r\nCorps, following in the wake of the 6th, had also made its way to\r\nVizeu. The bulk of Reynier’s force took the Fornos-Mangualde-Lagiosa\r\nroute, as Ney’s had done. But an advanced guard of all arms descended\r\nthe great _chaussée_ south of the river as far as Taboa, driving in\r\nthe pickets of the English cavalry, and then crossed the Mondego at\r\nthe bridge of Taboa, and fell into the rear of the rest of the corps\r\nbeyond Mangualde. This apparently was intended to keep Wellington\r\nuncertain, as long as possible, as to whether part of the French\r\narmy was not intending, after all, to follow the _chaussée_ and\r\npresent itself before the position on the Alva[404]. But it was\r\nexecuted by so small a force that the British general was not for\r\nan hour deceived[405]. He was at this moment in a cheerful frame\r\nof mind; Masséna had made a mistake in choosing his route, and was\r\nmerely wasting time when time was most precious. ‘There are certainly\r\nmany bad roads in Portugal,’ he wrote, ‘but the enemy has taken\r\ndecidedly the worst in the whole kingdom’[406]; and again, ‘I imagine\r\nthat Marshal Masséna has been misinformed, and has experienced more\r\ndifficulty in making his movement than he expected. He has certainly\r\nselected one of the worst roads in Portugal for his march[407].’\r\nOwing to the necessary delays of the enemy Wellington was now in a\r\nposition as strong as that on the Alva; his head quarters were at\r\nthe convent of Bussaco, his divisions, including Leith and Hill,\r\nso placed that they could be concentrated on the Serra de Alcoba,\r\nright across the Vizeu-Coimbra road, long before the French could\r\ndescend from Vizeu. ‘We have an excellent position here, in which I\r\nam strongly tempted to give battle[408],’ he wrote on the evening of\r\nthe 21st, foreseeing six days ahead the probability of the engagement\r\nwhich was to make Bussaco famous. There was a road by which his\r\nposition might be turned, but it was doubtful whether the enemy would\r\ndiscover it, and ‘I do not yet give up hopes of discovering a remedy\r\nfor that misfortune[409].’\r\n\r\n  [403] Report of Lambert, Intendant-General, dated Vizeu, Sept. 23.\r\n\r\n  [404] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, from Lorvão, Sept. 20.\r\n\r\n  [405] Indeed, an exploring party under Captain Somers Cocks, of\r\n  the 16th Light Dragoons, had dogged the steps of the detachment,\r\n  and counted every battalion. See Tomkinson’s Diary, pp. 39-40.\r\n\r\n  [406] Wellington to Charles Stuart, Sept. 18.\r\n\r\n  [407] Wellington to Lord Liverpool, Sept. 20.\r\n\r\n  [408] Ibid., Sept. 20.\r\n\r\n  [409] Wellington to Stapleton Cotton, Sept. 21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONDEGO VALLEY]\r\n\r\nMasséna, meanwhile, was chafing at his self-imposed delays, and\r\nwriting querulous letters from Vizeu to Berthier. ‘The grand park\r\nand the baggage,’ he wrote on the 22nd, ‘are still in the rear,\r\nand will only get up to-morrow. It is impossible to find worse\r\nroads than these; they bristle with rocks; the guns and train have\r\nsuffered severely, and I must wait for them. I must leave them two\r\ndays at Vizeu when they come in, to rest themselves, while I\r\nresume my march on Coimbra, where (as I am informed) I shall find\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese concentrated. Sir, all our marches are across\r\na desert; not a soul to be seen anywhere; everything is abandoned.\r\nThe English push their barbarity to the point of shooting the\r\nwretched inhabitant who tries to remain in his village; the women,\r\nthe children, the aged, have all decamped. We cannot find a guide\r\nanywhere. The soldiers discover a few potatoes and other vegetables;\r\nthey are satisfied, and burn for the moment when they shall meet\r\nthe enemy.’ The plan of devastation was already beginning to work;\r\nMasséna had exhausted seven of the thirteen days’ provisions which\r\nhis army carried, and it was not with the potatoes gleaned in the\r\nfields of Vizeu, or the ripe grapes of its vineyards, that he could\r\nrefill the empty store-waggons. He must push on for Coimbra as fast\r\nas possible; this, no doubt, was why he made up his mind to march\r\non that place, not by descending from Vizeu to Aveiro and entering\r\nthe coast plain, but by taking the direct road by Santa Comba Dao,\r\nMortagoa, and Bussaco. Even Lopez’s faulty map shows the ridge of\r\nBussaco as a serious physical feature, but the Marshal does not seem\r\nto have reflected for a moment that Wellington might choose to defend\r\nit. The orders drawn up on September 24th for the march on Coimbra\r\npresuppose an unobstructed progress[410]. Having met no active\r\nresistance as yet from the Anglo-Portuguese army, Masséna wrongly\r\ntook it for granted that he might count on the prolongation of this\r\ngood fortune.\r\n\r\n  [410] See the orders in the _Archives du Ministère de la Guerre_.\r\n\r\nBefore moving on from Vizeu the organization of the French army\r\nwas slightly modified. Junot’s corps contained a number of fourth\r\nbattalions, belonging to regiments whose three senior battalions were\r\nserving in the 2nd Corps. The two corps had never met till both lay\r\nat Vizeu. Masséna then ordered the fourth battalions of the 36th,\r\n47th, 70th of the Line, and the 2nd and 4th Léger to join their\r\nregiments in Reynier’s corps; this reduced the 8th Corps by 2,850\r\nmen; in return, however, Reynier was ordered to make over to Junot\r\ntwo regiments of old troops, the 15th and 86th of the line (each of\r\nthree battalions) making in all 2,251 bayonets. Thus the two corps\r\nwere somewhat equalized in quality, the 2nd receiving five battalions\r\nof recruits, while the 8th (in which there were too few veterans)\r\ngot in return six battalions which had served in Spain since the\r\ncommencement of the war. The net result was to make the 2nd Corps\r\na little stronger (17,024 men) and the 8th Corps a little weaker\r\n(15,904 men)[411].\r\n\r\n  [411] It is this interchange of troops which makes all the\r\n  figures of the Army of Portugal so divergent. Fririon, for\r\n  example, ignores it, as do most French statisticians. But see\r\n  Masséna’s orders (14), and the ‘situations’ in the _Archives_ of\r\n  Sept. 14 and Sept. 27 respectively.\r\n\r\nOn September 21st the advance of the Army of Portugal was\r\nrecommenced, though the train and heavy baggage was not yet prepared\r\nto start, and some of its rear detachments had not even reached\r\nVizeu. But on that day the advanced guard of the 6th Corps advanced\r\nfrom Tondella, and found in front of it some light cavalry and two\r\nPortuguese regiments--the first hostile troops that the French had\r\nseen since the campaign began. The whole of the 2nd and 6th Corps\r\nfollowed behind, and bivouacked that night at Casal-de-Maria,\r\nTondella, Sabugoça and other villages on the steep downward road from\r\nVizeu to Coimbra. The 8th Corps still remained at Vizeu, guarding\r\nthe belated reserve artillery and train. On the 22nd the 2nd Corps,\r\npassing the 6th, which had hitherto taken the lead, crossed the Criz\r\nand drove in the British outposts, who retired on Mortagoa. But Ney\r\nand the 6th Corps remained stationary, and the 8th did not even yet\r\nmake a start. These delays seem extraordinary, but Masséna was still\r\npaying for his evil choice of roads; the infantry had to wait for the\r\nguns, and the guns could only creep forward as the sappers enlarged\r\nand improved the roads for them.\r\n\r\nWellington, meanwhile, was recasting his dispositions at his leisure.\r\nWhen Masséna’s march on Vizeu had become certain, the British\r\nCommander-in-Chief thought at first that the enemy would take the\r\ngood _chaussée_ Vizeu-Aveiro, so as to descend into the coast-plain\r\nand attack Coimbra from the easiest side. He therefore, on the 18th\r\nmoved the 1st Division back from Ponte de Murcella to Coimbra, where\r\nit was joined by a new brigade from Lisbon, composed of the 1st\r\nbattalions of the 7th and 79th, newly landed. A. Campbell’s and\r\nColeman’s Portuguese also moved to the same point. The 3rd and 4th\r\nDivisions remained at Ponte de Murcella in the entrenched position,\r\nwith the Light Division and Pack’s Portuguese in front of them at\r\nVenda do Porco and Sampayo.\r\n\r\nBut on the 20th, when Ney’s advanced guard began to come out from\r\nVizeu on the Santa Comba Dao road, not on the Aveiro road, Wellington\r\ndiscovered that it was on the mountain of Bussaco, and not on the\r\nplain in front of Coimbra, that he would next meet the enemy.\r\nAccordingly Pack’s Portuguese and the Light Division forded the\r\nMondego below Sampayo, as did the light cavalry, and a detaining\r\nforce was thus thrown across the Vizeu-Coimbra road. The Portuguese\r\nbrigade took post behind the Criz torrent, Craufurd’s men a little\r\nto the rear at Mortagoa. At the same time the 1st Division and the\r\ntroops attached to it moved out from Coimbra to Mealhada on the\r\nAveiro road, a point from which they could easily be called up to\r\nthe Bussaco position, if no French columns were discovered coming\r\ndown the Aveiro road, as now seemed probable. This day, Leith’s\r\ndivision, to Wellington’s intense satisfaction, arrived at San Miguel\r\nde Payares behind the Alva, and so joined the main body. Hill was\r\nreported to be a day’s march only to the rear, at Foz d’Aronce. Thus\r\nthe whole of the Anglo-Portuguese regular forces between Douro and\r\nTagus were neatly concentrated. At the same time Trant was told to\r\nbring the militia of Northern Beira down the Oporto-Coimbra road to\r\nAgueda and Sardão, and Baccelar was directed to support him with\r\nWilson’s militia brigade, in case Masséna should have some subsidiary\r\noperation against Oporto in his mind.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the first skirmish of the campaign took place; the 2nd\r\nCorps, advancing into the plain in front of Mortagoa, found Pack’s\r\nPortuguese facing them on the right, and Craufurd’s division on the\r\nleft, with a screen of cavalry in front. They pushed in the horsemen\r\nupon the infantry, but halted when artillery opened upon them, and\r\nmade no further advance. On this day the belated 8th Corps, with the\r\nreserve cavalry, at last started from Vizeu. Next morning Reynier\r\npressed on in force with two heavy columns each formed by a division,\r\nand Craufurd was ordered by Wellington to retire, which he did with\r\nsome reluctance by alternate échelons of brigades[412]. The 95th and\r\n43rd had some sharp skirmishing with the French van, and made a stand\r\nby the village of Moura under the Bussaco heights, before retiring\r\nup the high-road, and taking position upon the crest of the great\r\nridge[413], which they did at six o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n  [412] According to Napier (iii. 22-3) Craufurd risked his\r\n  division somewhat in their skirmish. But this criticism is not\r\n  made by D’Urban, Leach, and other eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\n  [413] The Light Division had been first divided into brigades on\r\n  Aug. 8, when the 1st was constituted of the 43rd, four companies\r\n  of the 95th, and the 1st Caçadores, under Beckwith: the 2nd of\r\n  the 52nd, four companies of the 95th, and the 3rd Caçadores,\r\n  under Barclay. See Atkinson’s lists of the Peninsular Army in the\r\n  _Eng. Hist. Rev_.\r\n\r\nWhile the advanced guards of Reynier and Ney were driving in Craufurd\r\nand Pack, the Anglo-Portuguese army was assembling on Wellington’s\r\nchosen fighting-ground. Picton and Cole, with the 3rd and 4th\r\nDivisions, had already taken up their quarters on the Bussaco ridge\r\non the 21st, the first across the road from San Antonio de Cantaro\r\nto Palheiros, the second across the _chaussée_, behind the spot to\r\nwhich the troops of Pack and Craufurd were retiring. Leith, who had\r\nbeen brought over the Mondego by the fords of Peña Cova on the 23rd,\r\nmoved up on to the southern tract of the Bussaco heights on the\r\n24th. Hill, who reached the line of the Alva on the 22nd, followed\r\nin Leith’s wake, and on the 25th was at Peña Cova waiting for orders\r\nto cross. The 1st Division with Campbell’s and Coleman’s Portuguese\r\nalone were still absent, though not far off. They had started from\r\nMealhada, when it became clear that no French force was coming by the\r\nAveiro-Coimbra road, but on the night of the 25th were still some\r\neight miles away, and did not get into position between Cole and\r\nPicton till between nine and ten o’clock on the morning of the 26th.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, nearly 40,000 men, composed of the Light, 3rd, 4th,\r\n5th Divisions and their Portuguese auxiliaries, and of Hill on their\r\nflank, only four miles away, were concentrated on the night of the\r\n25th, when Reynier’s vanguard deployed in front of the heights.\r\nBefore ten o’clock on the following morning Spencer had arrived,\r\nand Hill was over the fords and encamped along the rear slopes of\r\nthe heights. There seems to be no truth whatever in the allegation\r\nthat the British army was in a somewhat dangerous position on the\r\nevening of the 25th, for the French had only their vanguard up, and\r\nthere were less than two hours of daylight left when Craufurd retired\r\nfrom Moura, and Reynier and Ney obtained their first view of the\r\nBritish position. Before the enemy could have collected in strength\r\nsufficient for an attack, night would have set in.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE SITUATION ON SEPT. 25\r\n\r\nNapier wholly misrepresents the state of affairs in vol. iii. pp.\r\n22-3. He writes as follows: ‘Before 3 o’clock 40,000 French infantry\r\nwere embattled on the two points (the _chaussée_ and the San Antonio\r\nde Cantaro road), their guns trying the range above, while the\r\nskirmishing clatter of musketry arose from the dark wooded chasms\r\nbelow. Ney, whose military glance was sure, instantly perceived\r\nthat the mountain, a crested not a table one, could hide no great\r\nreserves, that it was only half occupied, and that the allies were\r\nmoving with the disorder usual on the taking of unknown ground.\r\nHe wished therefore to attack, but Masséna was ten miles to the\r\nrear, the officer sent to him waited two hours for an audience, and\r\nthen returned with orders to attend the Prince’s arrival. Thus a\r\ngreat opportunity was lost, for Spencer was not up, Leith’s troops\r\nwere only passing the Mondego, and Hill was still behind the Alva.\r\nScarcely 25,000 men were in line, and with great intervals.’\r\n\r\nAlmost every statement here is incorrect.\r\n\r\n(1) The French did not reach the ground in front of the heights till 5\r\no’clock: they were not up at 3 p.m. [D’Urban’s _Diary_: ‘At noon, the\r\nheads of the French infantry columns having reached the lower falls\r\nleading from the Mortagoa Valley, he pushed forward his cavalry and\r\nbegan to skirmish with our pickets. It not being Lord Wellington’s\r\nintention to dispute this ground, but rather to entice Masséna to\r\nfollow and attack him in his position of Boçaco, the Light Division was\r\ngradually withdrawn, the 95th and 43rd covering the retreat and Ross’s\r\nartillery playing upon the enemy’s advance from hill to hill, till at\r\n5 o’clock they were halted by the fire of the 43rd before the village\r\nof Sula. At about 6 the firing ceased, and our advance (heretofore\r\nat Moura and Sula) took up their ground (as well as General Cole’s\r\ndivision) upon the heights of Boçaco.’] This diary, _written that same\r\nnight_, cannot be wrong as to the dating of the hours. D’Urban was\r\nriding with Beresford at Wellington’s side. Napier was writing from\r\nmemory twenty years after.\r\n\r\n(2) Ney did not ‘perceive the mountain only half occupied, and wish\r\nto attack,’ on the evening of the 25th. His reconnaissance was made\r\non the morning of the 26th, and it was _then_ that he expressed\r\nhis wish to attack, when Wellington had every man in line. This is\r\nconclusively proved by the following note of Ney to Reynier, dated at\r\n10.30 on the morning of the 26th, from his advanced posts, which lies\r\nin the French archives:--\r\n\r\n‘Je reçois à l’instant, mon cher général, votre lettre de ce jour.\r\nJe pense qu’une grande partie de l’armée anglo-portugaise a passé\r\nla nuit sur la crête des montagnes qui dominent la vallée de Moura.\r\nDepuis ce matin l’ennemi marche par sa gauche, et semble diriger ses\r\ncolonnes principales sur la route d’Oporto. Cependant il tient encore\r\nassez de monde à la droite du parc, qui couvre le couvent de Minimes\r\nappelé Sako, et montre une douzaine de pièces d’artillerie. Le chemin\r\nde Coimbre passe tout près de ce couvent. Si j’avais le commandement\r\nj’attaquerais sans hésiter un seul instant. Mais je crois que vous\r\nne pouvez rien compromettre en vous échellonant sur la droite de\r\nl’ennemi, et en poussant ses avant-postes le plus possible: car\r\nc’est véritablement par ce point qu’il faudrait le forcer à faire sa\r\nretraite.’ What Ney had seen, and wrongly took for a general movement\r\nof the English army towards its left, was Cole taking ground to the\r\nleft on the arrival of Spencer, who came up between 8 and 10 that\r\nmorning, just before Ney was scribbling this hasty note to Reynier.\r\n\r\n(3) The stretch of mountain opposite Ney and Reynier was _not_\r\n‘crested’ but ‘table’--so much so that Wellington took two squadrons\r\nof cavalry up to it, for use in the battle. The British general\r\n_never_ took up a position where he had no space to hide his reserves.\r\n\r\n(4) The time when Ney sent an officer to Masséna to ask leave to\r\nattack was the morning of the 26th, not the evening of the 25th. How\r\ncould Ney have hoped to get the permission to fight and carry it out,\r\nwhen the time when he reached Moura was 5 o’clock, and dusk falls at\r\n6.30? The messenger had twenty miles to ride, to Mortagoa and back.\r\nSee Fririon’s note in his ‘Aperçu sur la Campagne de Portugal’ in\r\n_Victoires et Conquêtes_, xxi. 320.\r\n\r\n(5) Leith’s troops, so far from being ‘only passing the Mondego’\r\non the afternoon of the 25th, had passed it on the 23rd [_Journal_\r\nof Leith Hay, aide-de-camp of Leith, i. 228]. On the night of the\r\n22nd-23rd Wellington wrote to Hill, ‘Leith’s, Picton’s, and Cole’s\r\ndivisions are now on the Serra de Busaco’ [_Dispatches_, vi. 462].\r\nHill was not ‘behind the Alva,’ but massed at the fords of Peña Cova,\r\nonly four miles from the battlefield. He crossed at dawn on the 26th,\r\nbut could have been in action within two hours of the first shot, if\r\nthe attack had been made on the 25th.\r\n\r\n(6) Wellington, including Hill’s division, had therefore 40,000 men,\r\nnot 25,000. But the latter number would have sufficed, for Ney and\r\nReynier had only their advanced guards up, and in the hour and a half\r\nbefore dusk could not have brought up their whole corps by the bad\r\nand narrow roads from behind. The _Diary_ of the 6th Corps mentions\r\nthat only the vanguard division (Loison) bivouacked in front of the\r\nheights. The rearguard was as far back as Barril that night.\r\n\r\n(7) The exact moment of the arrival of the British 1st Division may\r\nbe gauged from the fact that it passed Luzo, the village behind\r\nBussaco, at 8 a.m. on the 26th--Diary of Stothert (3rd Foot Guards),\r\np. 188. There is only two miles from Luzo to the position taken up by\r\nthe 1st Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF BUSSACO (SEPTEMBER 27, 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains that we should describe the ground which Wellington had\r\nchosen on the 21st, and on which he fought with such splendid success\r\nupon the 27th. The ridge which takes its name from the convent of\r\nBussaco is one of the best-marked positions in the whole Iberian\r\nPeninsula. A single continuous line of heights covered with heather\r\nand furze, with the dull-red and dull-grey granite cropping up\r\nhere and there through the soil, extends from the Mondego on the\r\nright--where it ends precipitously--to the main chain of the Serra\r\nde Alcoba on the left. The ridge is very irregular in its altitude:\r\nthe two loftiest sections are one at a distance of two miles from\r\nthe Mondego, and the other to the immediate right of the convent\r\nenclosure, where the original obelisk commemorating the battle was\r\nset up[414]. Between these two culminating summits the ridge sinks\r\ndown, and is at its lowest where the country-road from San Antonio\r\nde Cantaro to Palheiros passes over it. There are three other points\r\nwhere it is crossed by lines of communication; two lie far to the\r\neast, not far from the Mondego, where bad paths from San Paulo to\r\nPalmazes and from Carvalhal to Casal exist. The third and most\r\nimportant is in its left centre, where (close to the convent) the\r\n_chaussée_ from Celorico to Coimbra, the main artery of the local\r\nroad-system, passes the watershed. It does so at a place which is\r\nby no means the least lofty point of the ridge; but the line was\r\nobvious to the road-making engineer, because a spur (the only one\r\nof any importance in the heights) here runs gradually down from the\r\nSerra into the lower ground. To lead the _chaussée_ up the side of\r\nthis spur, past the village of Moura, and so to the crest of the\r\nridge on gentle slopes, was clearly better than to make it charge the\r\nmain range, even at a less lofty point. The convent lies just to the\r\nright of the spot where the _chaussée_ passes the sky-line, a few\r\nhundred yards off the road. It was a simple, low quadrangle, with a\r\nsmall chapel in its midst, standing in a fine wood of pine and oak,\r\nsurrounded by a ten-foot wall. The wood is sprinkled with hermitages,\r\npicturesque little buildings hewn in the rock, where those of the\r\nmonks who chose practised the anchorite’s life. The outer wall\r\nof the wood and the tops of its trees are just visible on the\r\nsky-line of the main ridge: the convent is not, being well down the\r\nreverse-slope. The point where the convent wood tops the heights is\r\nthe only section of them where trees are seen on the summit: the rest\r\nof the line is bare heath, with occasional outbreaks of rock, falling\r\nin slopes of greater or lesser steepness towards the broken wooded\r\nfoot-hills, where the French lay. On part of the left-centre there is\r\nground which it is no exaggeration to describe as precipitous, to the\r\nfront of the highest piece of the ridge, below the old obelisk. The\r\neffect of the whole line of heights is not dissimilar to, though on a\r\nsmaller scale than, the Malvern Hills. The highest point on the Serra\r\nis about 1,200 feet above sea-level--but much less, of course, above\r\nthe upland below.\r\n\r\n  [414] There are two monuments: this simple weather-beaten obelisk\r\n  on the culminating height where the 1st Division stood, a point\r\n  where no fighting took place, and the modern column lower down\r\n  and close to the high-road, behind the spot where Craufurd\r\n  fought. Here the Portuguese to this day maintain a small military\r\n  post, and hoist a flag to do honour to the victory.\r\n\r\nThe position of Bussaco is fully nine miles long[415] from end\r\nto end, from the steep hill above the Mondego to Cole’s western\r\nflank: this was a vast front for an army of 50,000 men to cover,\r\naccording to the ideas of 1810. There were absolute gaps in the line\r\nat more than one place, especially above Carvalho, where about a\r\nmile separated Leith’s left from his central brigade. The defence\r\nof such a position could only be risked because of two facts: one\r\nwas that every movement of the enemy on the lower ground before\r\nthe ridge could be accurately made out from above: he could not\r\nconcentrate in front of any section of the heights without being\r\nseen. His only chance of doing so would have been to take advantage\r\nof the night; but even if he had drawn up for the attack before\r\ndawn--a thing almost impossible in the broken, ravine-cut, wooded\r\nbottoms--he could not have moved till full daylight, because the\r\nface of the position presents so many irregularities, such as small\r\ngullies and miniature precipices, that columns climbing in the dark\r\nmust undoubtedly have got lost and broken up on the wild hillside.\r\nMoreover, there was a thick cordon of British pickets pushed forward\r\nalmost to the foot of the ridge, which would have given warning by\r\ntheir fire and their preliminary resistance, if any advance had been\r\nattempted in the grey dawn.\r\n\r\n  [415] Which makes astounding Fririon’s statement that it was only\r\n  three-quarters of a league long (p. 46).\r\n\r\nThe second advantage of the Bussaco position is that on its\r\nleft-centre and right-centre the ridge has a broad flat top, some\r\n300 or 400 yards across, on which all arms can move laterally with\r\nease to support any threatened point. It is so broad that Wellington\r\neven ventured to bring up a few squadrons of dragoons to the summit,\r\nrightly arguing that a cavalry charge would be of all things the most\r\nunexpected reception that an enemy who had breasted such a hillside\r\ncould meet at the end of his climb. As a matter of fact, however,\r\nthis section of the heights was never attacked by the French. The\r\nright of the position is not flat-topped like the centre, but has\r\na narrow saddle-back, breaking into outcrops of rock at intervals:\r\nbut though here prompt motion from right to left, or left to right,\r\nis not possible on the crest, there is a rough country-path, good\r\nfor infantry and available even for guns, a few hundred yards down\r\nthe reverse side of the slope. Along this troops could be moved\r\nwith ease, entirely out of sight of the enemy. It proved useful for\r\nLeith’s division during the battle. Wellington calculated, therefore,\r\nwith perfect correctness, that he could count on getting an adequate\r\nforce of defenders to any portion of his long line before the enemy\r\ncould establish himself on the summit. The extreme left, where Cole’s\r\ndivision lay, was the hardest part of his line to reinforce, for want\r\nof good lateral communication: it was also a good deal lower than\r\nCraufurd’s post; here, therefore, Wellington had placed the main mass\r\nof his reserves; the German Legion, and two Portuguese brigades were\r\nlying on his left-centre very close to the 4th Division, so that\r\nthey would be available at short notice, though they would have a\r\nstiff climb if the French chose that section of the position as their\r\nobjective, and it had to be strengthened in haste.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the army remains to be described. On the extreme\r\nright, on the height of Nossa Senhora do Monte, just overhanging the\r\nMondego, was a battalion of the Lusitanian Legion, with two guns.\r\nNext to them, on very high ground, lay Hill’s division, three British\r\nand two Portuguese brigades[416], with a battery on each flank. Then\r\ncame a slight dip in the ridge, where the road from San Paulo to\r\nPalmazes crosses it: athwart this path lay Leith’s newly constituted\r\n5th Division, consisting of three British and seven Portuguese\r\nbattalions. The British brigade lay on the right, then came (after\r\na long interval) two battalions of the Lusitanian Legion, the only\r\ntroops guarding two miles of very rough ground. On Leith’s extreme\r\nleft, towards Picton’s right, was Spry’s Portuguese brigade, and\r\nthree unattached battalions (8th Line and Thomar militia). Beyond the\r\n8th regiment, where the watershed sinks again, and is crossed by the\r\nroad from San Antonio de Cantaro to Palheiros, Picton’s line began.\r\nOn his right, across the road, was Arentschildt’s Portuguese battery,\r\nsupported by the 74th British regiment, and Champlemond’s Portuguese\r\nbrigade of three battalions. The 45th and 88th, the two remaining\r\nbattalions of the brigade of Mackinnon, were placed to the left of\r\nthe road, the former on the first spur to the north of it, the latter\r\nnearly a mile to the left. Lightburne’s brigade, and Thompson’s\r\nBritish battery were a short distance beyond the 88th. North of\r\nPicton’s position the ridge rises suddenly again to its loftiest\r\nsection; along this almost impregnable ground, with its precipitous\r\nfront, were ranged the three British brigades of Spencer’s 1st\r\nDivision--the Guards on the right, Blantyre’s on the left, Pakenham’s\r\nin the centre, 5,000 bayonets dominating the whole country-side\r\nand the rest of the position. North of them again, where the ridge\r\nfalls sharply along the back wall of the convent wood, was Pack’s\r\nPortuguese brigade, reaching almost to the high-road. Along the curve\r\nof the high-road itself, in column, was Coleman’s Portuguese brigade,\r\nand beside it A. Campbell’s Portuguese, with the German Legion\r\nbeyond them on the Monte Novo ridge. Coleman, Campbell, and the\r\nGermans were the main reserve of the army, and were in second line,\r\nfor, far to the front of them, on a lower slope, along a curve of the\r\n_chaussée_, lay Craufurd and the Light Division, looking down on the\r\nvillage of Sula almost at the bottom of the heights. Between Craufurd\r\nand his next neighbour to the right, Pack, was a curious feature of\r\nthe field, a long narrow ravine, with steep grassy sides, terraced\r\nin some places into vineyards[417]. This cleft, between Sula on the\r\nleft and Moura on the right, cuts deep up into the hillside, its\r\nhead almost reaching the crest of the watershed below the convent.\r\nIn order to circumvent this precipitous gully, the _chaussée_, after\r\npassing through the village of Moura, takes a semicircular curve to\r\nthe right, and goes round the head of the cleft. For half a mile\r\nor more it overhangs the steep declivities on its right, while on\r\nits left at this point it is dominated by a pine wood on the upper\r\nslopes, so that it forms more or less of a defile. The gully is so\r\nnarrow here that guns on Craufurd’s position had an easy range on the\r\nroad, and enfiladed it most effectively. The battery attached to the\r\nLight Division--that of Ross--had been placed in a sort of natural\r\nredoubt, formed by a semicircle of boulders with gaps between;\r\nsome of the guns bore on the village of Sula, on the lower slope\r\nbelow, others across the ravine, to the high-road. They were almost\r\ninvisible, among the great stones, to an enemy coming up the hill or\r\nalong the _chaussée_. Craufurd had got a battalion of his Caçadores\r\n(No. 3) in the village, low down the slope, with his other Portuguese\r\nbattalion and the 95th Rifles strung out on the hillside above, to\r\nsupport the troops below them. His two strong Line battalions, the\r\n43rd and 52nd, were lying far above, in the road, at the point where\r\nit has passed the head of the gully in its curve, with a little fir\r\nwood behind them and a small windmill in their front. The road being\r\ncut through the hillside here, they were screened as they stood, but\r\nhad only to advance a few feet to reach the sky line, and to command\r\nthe slope stretching upwards from the village of Sula.\r\n\r\n  [416] Archibald Campbell’s and Fonseca’s brigades, forming\r\n  Hamilton’s Portuguese Division, which was attached to the British\r\n  2nd Division throughout the war, and shared with it the triumphs\r\n  of Albuera, Vittoria, and St. Pierre.\r\n\r\n  [417] This is the feature which Napier, somewhat hyperbolically,\r\n  describes as ‘a chasm so profound that the naked eye could hardly\r\n  distinguish the movement of troops in the bottom, yet so narrow\r\n  in parts that 12-pounders could range across (iii. 21).’ It does\r\n  _not_, as he says, separate the Serra de Bussaco from the last\r\n  ridge in front of it, that which the French held, as it only\r\n  lay in front of Craufurd and Pack. There is no chasm between\r\n  Spencer’s, Picton’s, Leith’s, or Hill’s position and the French\r\n  knolls.\r\n\r\nTo the left rear of Craufurd’s position, and forming the\r\nnorth-western section of the English line lay Cole’s 4th Division,\r\nreaching almost to the villages of Paradas and Algeriz. Its\r\nPortuguese brigade (11th and 23rd regiments) was thrown forward on\r\nthe left under Collins, its two English brigades were at the head of\r\nthe slope. The ground was not high, but the slope was very steep, and\r\nas a matter of fact was never even threatened, much less attacked.\r\n\r\nSixty guns were distributed along the line of the Serra. Ross’s\r\nhorse artillery troop were with Craufurd, Bull’s with Cole; of the\r\nfield-batteries Lawson’s was with Pack, Thompson’s with Lightburne,\r\nRettberg’s [K.G.L.] with Spencer, Cleeves’ [K.G.L.] with Coleman.\r\nThere were also four Portuguese field-batteries; Arentschildt’s was\r\non the high-road with Picton, Dickson’s two batteries with Hill,\r\nPassos’s with Coleman, alongside of Cleeves’ German guns. Counting\r\ntheir artillerymen, and the two squadrons of the 4th Dragoons on\r\nthe summit of the plateau, Wellington had 52,000 men on the field.\r\nOf the rest of his disposable army, the Portuguese cavalry brigade\r\n(regiments 1, 4, 7, 8; 1,400 sabres under Fane) and one British\r\nregiment (13th Light Dragoons) were beyond the Mondego, far to\r\nthe south-east, watching the open country across the Alva as far\r\nas Foz Dao and Sobral. Their head quarters were at Foz de Alva.\r\nTo defend the Ponte de Murcella position against any possible\r\nflanking force the French might have detached, Wellington had left\r\nLe Cor’s Portuguese, two regular regiments (Nos. 12 and 13) and\r\nthree battalions of the Beira militia. All these troops were ten or\r\ntwelve miles from the nearest point at which a shot was fired, in a\r\ndifferent valley, and were alike unseeing and unseen. In a similar\r\nfashion, far out to the west, on the other side of the watershed,\r\nin the low ground by Mealhada, was the English cavalry, with the\r\nexception of the one regiment at Foz de Alva and two squadrons on the\r\nConvent ridge.\r\n\r\nReynier’s corps, pushing the English rearguard before it, had\r\narrived in front of the Bussaco position on the afternoon of\r\nSeptember 25th. When Ney’s corps came up at dusk Reynier edged\r\naway to the left, and established himself on the low hills above\r\nthe hamlet of San Antonio de Cantaro, leaving the ground about the\r\nhigh-road to the 6th Corps. The 8th and Montbrun’s cavalry were still\r\nsome way behind, beyond Barril. Masséna, for reasons which it is\r\nhard to divine, had not come to the front, though he must have heard\r\nthe guns firing all through the afternoon, and had been informed by\r\nReynier that the English were standing at bay on the Bussaco ridge.\r\nHe came no further to the front than Mortagoa on the 25th. Ney on the\r\nmorn of the next day was busy reconnoitring the position; he sent\r\nforward _tirailleurs_ to push in Craufurd’s outposts, and ventured\r\nas far to the front as was possible. So well hidden was Wellington’s\r\nline that the Marshal formed an entirely erroneous conception of\r\nwhat was before him. At 10.30 in the morning he wrote to Reynier to\r\nsay that the whole English army seemed to be moving to its left,\r\napparently on the road towards Oporto, but that it had still a\r\nrearguard, with a dozen guns, in position to the right of the park\r\nwhich covers the convent. Apparently Cole’s division, taking ground\r\nto its left on Spencer’s arrival, and Craufurd on the _chaussée_ was\r\nall that he had made out. He had not discovered Leith and the 5th\r\nDivision, and could not, of course, know that Spencer was at this\r\nmoment arriving at the convent, and that Hill was across the Mondego\r\nat Peña Cova.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal added that if he had been in chief command he should\r\nhave attacked whatever was in front of him without a moment’s\r\nhesitation[418]. But things being as they were, he thought that\r\nReynier would risk nothing by pushing forward on the English right,\r\nand thrusting back Wellington’s outposts, for it was desirable to\r\nmake him retreat towards his left. It is clear that Ney, if he had\r\npossessed a free hand, would have brought on a battle, when he was\r\nonly intending to drive in a rearguard. For by 10.30 on the 26th\r\nWellington had every man upon the field whom he intended to use in\r\nthe fight, and would have welcomed an assault. Of the French, on the\r\nother hand, Junot’s 8th Corps and the cavalry and artillery were\r\nstill far away to the rear. They only came up in rear of Ney on the\r\nnight of the 26th-27th.\r\n\r\n  [418] See the letter quoted on page 358.\r\n\r\nMasséna, on receiving Ney’s report, rode up to the front at about\r\ntwo o’clock on the 26th--a late hour, but he is said to have been\r\nemployed in private matters at Mortagoa[419]. When he had at last\r\nappeared, he pushed forward as near to the foot of the British\r\nposition as was safe, and reconnoitred it with care. In the evening\r\nhe drew up orders for attacking the Bussaco heights at their most\r\naccessible points--along the _chaussée_ that leads from Moura up to\r\nthe convent, and along the country-road from San Antonio de Cantaro\r\nto Palheiros.\r\n\r\n  [419] See Marbot, ii. p. 384--if that lively writer may be\r\n  trusted.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Essling had no hesitation whatever about risking a\r\nbattle. He had never seen the English before, and held concerning\r\nthem the same views as the other French officers who had no\r\nexperience of Wellington’s army. Some confused generalization from\r\nthe misfortunes of the Duke of York’s troops in 1794-5 and 1799\r\ndetermined the action of all the marshals till they had made personal\r\nacquaintance with the new enemy. The English were to be dealt with by\r\ndrastic frontal attacks pushed home with real vigour. It is curious,\r\nas Napoleon remarked soon after[420], that Reynier, who had been\r\nbadly beaten by the English at Alexandria and Maida, had learnt no\r\nmore than the others, and committed exactly the same errors as his\r\ncolleagues. He, who had experience of his adversaries, and Ney, who\r\nhad not, adopted precisely the same tactics. These, indeed, were\r\nindicated to them by Masséna’s order to attack in columns, each at\r\nleast a division strong, preceded by a swarm of _tirailleurs_. There\r\nwas no question of a general advance all along the line; the two\r\nCorps-Commanders were directed to choose each his point, and to break\r\nthrough the British army at it, by force of mass and impact. Only\r\ntwo sections of Wellington’s nine-mile position were to be touched,\r\nthere being a long gap between the objectives assigned to Ney and\r\nto Reynier. But by throwing 13,000 or 14,000 men in close order at\r\neach of the two short fronts selected, Masséna thought that he could\r\npenetrate the thin line of the defenders.\r\n\r\n  [420] See Foy’s account of his interview with the Emperor in his\r\n  _Vie Militaire_, p. 108.\r\n\r\nAs none of the historians of the battle have thought it worth while\r\nto give the Marshal’s orders in detail, and many writers have\r\nmisconceived or mis-stated them, it is necessary to state them[421].\r\nThe attacks of the 2nd and 6th Corps were not to be simultaneous;\r\nReynier, having the easier ground before him, was told to move first.\r\nHe was to select the most accessible stretch of the hillside in his\r\nfront, and to climb it, with his whole corps in one or two columns,\r\npreceded by a skirmishing line. Having gained the crest, and pierced\r\nthe British line, he was to re-form his men, and then drop down the\r\nreverse slope of the heights on to the Coimbra road, along which he\r\nwas to press in the direction of the convent of Bussaco, toward the\r\nrear of Wellington’s centre.\r\n\r\n  [421] This unpublished document from the _Archives du Ministère\r\n  de la Guerre_ seems to have escaped all historians.\r\n\r\nNey was directed not to move till he should have learnt that Reynier\r\nhad crowned the heights; but when he should see the 2nd Corps on the\r\ncrest, was to send forward two columns of a division each against\r\nthe British left-centre. One division was to follow the _chaussée_,\r\nthe other to mount the rough path up the spur on which the village\r\nof Sula stands. Both columns, like those of the 2nd Corps, were to\r\nbe preceded by a thick line of skirmishers. They were to halt and\r\nre-form when the crest of the English position should be carried, and\r\nthen to adapt their movements to suit those of Reynier’s corps.\r\n\r\nJunot was to assemble his two infantry divisions behind Moura, and\r\nto have them ready to reinforce either Ney or Reynier as might be\r\nneeded. His artillery was to be placed on the knolls on each side of\r\nthe _chaussée_, so as to be able to hold back the allied army if,\r\nafter repulsing Ney, it should attempt a forward movement. Montbrun’s\r\ncavalry and the reserve artillery were to be placed on either side of\r\nthe _chaussée_ behind Junot’s centre[422].\r\n\r\n  [422] These orders are printed in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe horsemen were obviously useless, save that in the event of\r\nWellington being defeated they could be sent forward in pursuit. Nor\r\nwere the guns much more serviceable: they could sweep the lower parts\r\nof the slopes of Bussaco, but could not reach its crest with their\r\nfire. Indeed, the only French artillery used successfully on the\r\nnext day were two batteries which Ney’s columns of attack took with\r\nthem along the _chaussée_, as far as the elbow of road in front of\r\nMoura. These were in effective range of Craufurd’s and Pack’s troops,\r\nsince the latter were on a level with them, and not on the highest\r\ncrest of the British position. Reynier’s guns could just reach the\r\nsummit of the pass of San Antonio de Cantaro, but not so as to play\r\nupon it with any good result.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Junot and Reynier were in favour of trying the\r\nfrontal attack which Masséna had dictated, as was also Laszowski, the\r\nPolish general who commanded the engineers of the army. Fririon, the\r\nchief of the staff, and Eblé, commanding the artillery, spoke against\r\nthe policy of ‘taking the bull by the horns.’ Masséna, according to\r\nFririon, turned on the doubters with the words ‘You come from the\r\nold Army of the Rhine, you like manœuvring; but it is the first time\r\nthat Wellington seems ready to give battle, and I want to profit by\r\nthe opportunity[423].’ Ney, too, as we read with some surprise, is\r\nsaid to have given the opinion that it would have been feasible to\r\nassault the heights yesterday, but that now, when Wellington had been\r\ngiven time to bring up his reserves and settle his army down into\r\nthe most advantageous position, the policy of taking the offensive\r\nhad become doubtful. He therefore advised that the army should turn\r\naside and make a stroke at Oporto, which would be found unprotected\r\nsave by militia. Masséna, according to his official biographer,\r\nannounced ‘that the Emperor had ordered him to march on Lisbon, not\r\non Oporto. This was entirely correct: the capture of Lisbon would\r\nend the whole war, that of Oporto would prolong it, and bring no\r\ndecisive result. Moreover, it was quite uncertain whether Wellington\r\nwould not be able to prevent such a move. He has troops échelloned\r\nas far as the Vouga, and he could get to Oporto in three marches,\r\nbecause he possesses the Oporto-Coimbra _chaussée_, while the French\r\narmy, moving by worse roads, would require five marches to reach\r\nit.’ It is suggested that Ney’s policy was really to goad his\r\nsuperior into making the frontal attack at Bussaco, by feigning to\r\nbelieve it dangerous and to counsel its abandonment. For he thought\r\nthat Masséna would do precisely the opposite of what he was advised,\r\nout of his personal dislike for himself, and general distaste for\r\nhaving counsel thrust upon him. If this was so, the Duke of Elchingen\r\ncarried his point--to the entire discomfiture both of himself and his\r\ncommander-in-chief[424].\r\n\r\n  [423] So Fririon in his _Campagne de Portugal_, p. 47. But his\r\n  enemy Pelet says (_Vic. et Conq._, xxi. p. 321) that Ney, like\r\n  Reynier, ‘demanda la bataille à grands cris.’ Cf., for what it is\r\n  worth, Marbot’s tale, ii. 384.\r\n\r\n  [424] All this is told at great length in Koch’s _Vie de\r\n  Masséna_, vii. p. 192, where the Council of War is described with\r\n  many details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF BUSSACO Sep. 27th, 1810.\r\n  _Position of the Troops at the commencement of the French Attack_]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, after Masséna had retired to his head quarters at\r\nMortagoa, there was a little skirmishing on the English right-centre,\r\nwhere Reynier’s advanced guard drove the light company of the 88th\r\noff some knolls at the foot of the heights, opposite San Antonio de\r\nCantaro. Much about the same time there was some bickering on Ney’s\r\nfront: the pickets of Pack’s 4th Caçadores and Craufurd’s 95th were\r\nattacked, but held their ground. The contest was never very serious\r\nand the fire died down at dusk. That evening the British army slept\r\nin order of battle, ‘each man with his firelock in his grasp at his\r\npost. There were no fires, and the death-like stillness that reigned\r\nthroughout the line was only interrupted by the occasional challenge\r\nof an advanced sentry, or a random shot fired at some imaginary foe.’\r\nBelow and in front, all the low hills behind Moura and San Antonio\r\nwere bright with the bivouac fires of the French, of which three\r\ngreat masses could be distinguished, marking the position of the 2nd,\r\n6th, and 8th Corps[425].\r\n\r\n  [425] Grattan’s _Adventures with the 88th_, pp. 28-9, and Leith\r\n  Hay, i. 231.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of the 27th was somewhat misty, but as soon as the light was\r\nstrong enough Reynier commenced his attack. He had chosen for his\r\nobjective, as was natural, the lowest point of the ridge opposite\r\nhim, the dip where the country-road from San Antonio de Cantaro\r\ncrosses the Serra. His two divisions, according to order, were drawn\r\nup in two heavy columns preceded by a dense swarm of _tirailleurs_.\r\nHeudelet’s division on the left was across the high-road, with the\r\n31st Léger in front, then the two regiments of Foy’s brigade, the\r\n70th and 17th Léger, with the 47th in reserve. The whole made 15\r\nbattalions, or 8,000 men. Merle’s division had the right, and was\r\nto attack north of the road: of its eleven battalions, making 6,500\r\nmen, the 36th of the Line led, the 2nd Léger followed, the 4th Léger\r\nbrought up the rear. All the battalions were in serried column with a\r\nfront of one company only, and in each regiment the three, or four,\r\nbattalions were originally drawn up one behind the other. But the\r\ninvoluntary swerving of the attack soon turned the two divisions into\r\nan irregular échelon of battalion-columns, the right in every case\r\nleading. And the roughness of the hillside soon broke the ordered\r\nranks of each column into a great clump of men, so that to the\r\nBritish defenders of the ridge the assault seemed to be delivered\r\nby a string of small crowds crossing the hillside diagonally. It\r\nis curious that Reynier placed no troops to his left of the road;\r\na study of his orders (as of those of Masséna[426]) leads to a\r\nsuspicion that they had failed to discover Leith’s division, and\r\nstill more Hill’s, and imagined that the road was on the extreme\r\nright, not in the right-centre, of the British position. Otherwise\r\nReynier would have taken some precaution to guard himself from a\r\nflank attack from Leith, to which he was deliberately exposing his\r\nleft column.\r\n\r\n  [426] Masséna’s orders for the battle call Reynier’s attack one\r\n  on ‘la droite de l’armée ennemie,’ but it was really on the\r\n  right-centre, Hill and Leith extending for four miles south of\r\n  the point assailed.\r\n\r\nThere were, as has already been pointed out, several gaps in\r\nthe nine-mile British line. One was between the 8th regiment of\r\nPortuguese, on Leith’s extreme left, and the rest of the 5th\r\nDivision. Another was between Picton’s troops at the pass of San\r\nAntonio and his left wing--the 88th and Lightburne’s brigade.\r\nBetween the 45th and the 88th there was three-quarters of a mile of\r\nunoccupied ground. The first gap led to no danger, the second caused\r\nfor a moment a serious crisis. Such was indeed almost bound to occur\r\nwhen a line so long was held by such a small army. But this morning\r\nthere arose the special danger that fog hid the first movements of\r\nthe enemy from the eye, if not from the ear.\r\n\r\nMerle’s division seems to have been the first of Reynier’s two\r\ncolumns to move: at dawn, with the mist lying thick on the hillside,\r\nit began to move up the steep slope some three-quarters of a mile to\r\nthe right of the San Antonio-Palheiros road. Here its _tirailleurs_\r\ncame in contact with the light companies of the 74th, 88th, and 45th\r\nregiments, which were strung out along the front, and soon began\r\nto push this thin line up hill. For some reason undetermined--a\r\ntrick of the mist, or a bend of the hillside--the three French\r\nregiments all headed somewhat to their left, so as to pass across\r\nthe front of the 88th, and to direct their advance precisely to the\r\nunoccupied piece of crest between that regiment and the troops placed\r\nimmediately above the pass of San Antonio. Their progress was slow:\r\nthe _tirailleurs_ left far behind them the eleven battalion-columns,\r\nwhich were trampling through the dense matted heather which here\r\ncovers the hillside. Hearing the bicker of the skirmishing far to\r\nhis left, Picton took the alarm, and though he could see nothing\r\nin the fog, detached first a wing of the 45th under Major Gwynne,\r\nand then the two battalions of the 8th Portuguese, to fill the\r\nunoccupied space which intervened between him and the 88th. If he\r\nhad suspected the strength of the column that was aiming at it he\r\nwould have sent more. But he was already distracted by the frontal\r\nattack of Heudelet’s vanguard along the high-road. A column of four\r\nbattalions--the 31st Léger--was pushing up the road, and driving in\r\nthe skirmishers of Champlemond’s Portuguese brigade. Just at this\r\nmoment the mist began to lift, and Arentschildt’s guns opened on\r\nthe broad mass, and began to plough long lanes through it. It still\r\nadvanced, but was soon brought to a standstill by the fire of the\r\nBritish 74th and Portuguese 21st, which were drawn up in line to\r\nright and left, a little below the guns. The 31st Léger tried to\r\ndeploy, but with small success, each section being swept away by the\r\nconverging fire of the Anglo-Portuguese musketry, as it strove to\r\nfile out of the disordered mass. Nevertheless, the French regiment\r\ngallantly held its ground for some time, shifting gradually towards\r\nits right to avoid the fire of the guns, and gaining a little of the\r\nhillside in that direction with its first battalion, while the other\r\nthree were tending to edge away from the road, and to break up into a\r\nshapeless crowd[427].\r\n\r\n  [427] The _Mémoires_ of Lemonnier Delafosse, a captain in\r\n  the 31st Léger, give an excellent and clear account of its\r\n  sufferings, see pp. 69-70 of his work.\r\n\r\nPicton soon saw that there was no danger here, handed over the\r\ncommand at the Pass of San Antonio to Mackinnon, and started off\r\ntowards his left, where the firing was growing heavier every minute,\r\nand the vast column of Merle’s division, climbing the hillside\r\ndiagonally, had become visible through the mist.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the attack of Merle was made very slow by\r\nthe steepness of the hillside and the heather that clung about the\r\nsoldiers’ stumbling feet. For the leading regiment reached the crest\r\nbefore there were any British troops yet established on the point at\r\nwhich it aimed. It was lurching over the sky-line on to the little\r\nplateau above, just as the defenders arrived--the 88th descending\r\nfrom the British left, the wing of the 45th and the two battalions\r\nof the 8th Portuguese coming along the hill-road from the right. If\r\nthe French had been granted ten minutes to rest from the fatigue of\r\ntheir long climb, and to recover their order, they might have broken\r\nthe British line. But Wallace, the commander of the 88th, was one of\r\nWellington’s best colonels, the very man for the emergency. Seeing\r\nthat the French must be charged at once, ere they had time to make a\r\nfront, he threw out three of his companies as skirmishers to cover\r\nhis flanks, called to the wing of the 45th to fall in on his right,\r\nand charged diagonally across the little plateau on to the flank of\r\nthe great disordered mass before him. At the same moment the 8th\r\nPortuguese, a little further along the hilltop, deployed and opened\r\na rolling fire against the front of the enemy, while Wellington\r\nhimself, who had been called down from his post of observation on\r\nthe Convent height by the noise of the fighting, came up with two of\r\nThompson’s guns, and turned their fire upon the flank and rear of the\r\nclimbing mass, which was still surging up the hillside. Apparently\r\nat the same instant the light companies of the 45th and 88th,\r\nwhich had been engaged in the earlier skirmishing with the French\r\n_tirailleurs_, and had been driven far away to their right, were\r\nrallied by Picton in person, and brought up along the plateau, to the\r\nright of the 8th Portuguese. They drew up only sixty yards from the\r\nflank of the leading French regiment, and opened a rolling fire upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt any other juncture and on any other ground, four battalions would\r\nhave been helpless against eleven. But Wallace had caught the\r\npsychological moment: the French 36th, dead beat from its climb, and\r\nin hopeless disorder, was violently charged in flank by the Connaught\r\nRangers and the wing of the 45th, while it was just gathering itself\r\nup to run in upon the Portuguese battalions that lay in its front.\r\nThe French had no time to realize their position, or to mark the\r\nsmallness of the force opposed to them, when the blow fell. The four\r\nbattalions of the 36th were rolled down hill and to their left by\r\nthe blasting fire of Wallace’s little force, followed by a desperate\r\nbayonet charge. They were thrust sideways against the 2nd Léger,\r\nwhich was just reaching the sky-line on their left, and was beginning\r\nto struggle in among some rocks which here crown the crest of the\r\nheights. Then the whole mass gave way, trampled down the 4th Léger in\r\ntheir rear, and rushed down the slope. ‘All was confusion and uproar,\r\nsmoke, fire, and bullets, French officers and soldiers, drummers\r\nand drums, knocked down in every direction; British, French, and\r\nPortuguese mixed together; while in the midst of all was to be seen\r\nWallace fighting like his ancestor of old, and still calling to his\r\nsoldiers to “press forward.” He never slackened his fire while a\r\nFrenchman was within his reach, and followed them down to the edge of\r\nthe hill, where he formed his men in line waiting for any order that\r\nhe might receive, or any fresh body that might attack him[428].’ This\r\nwas certainly one of the most timely and gallant strokes made by a\r\nregimental commander during the war, and the glory was all Wallace’s\r\nown, as Picton very handsomely owned. ‘The Colonel of the 88th and\r\nMajor Gwynne of the 45th are entitled to the whole of the credit,’\r\nhe wrote to Wellington, ‘and I can claim no merit whatever in the\r\nexecutive part of that brilliant exploit, which your Lordship has so\r\nhighly and so justly extolled[429].’\r\n\r\n  [428] Grattan’s _Adventure with the Connaught Rangers_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n  [429] Picton to Wellington, _Supplementary Dispatches_, vi. p.\r\n  635. I do not know whether Wallace really descended from the\r\n  famous Sir William, but Craufurd of the Light Division (as his\r\n  descendant and biographer has pointed out to me) chanced to have\r\n  a connexion with the Knight of Ellerslie.\r\n\r\nThe victorious British troops followed the enemy far down the\r\nhillside, till they came under the fire of Reynier’s artillery,\r\nand were warned to retire to their former position. They thus\r\nmissed the last episode of Reynier’s attack, which occurred along\r\nthe hillside just to the left of the point at which their collision\r\nwith Merle’s battalions had taken place. The Commander of the 2nd\r\nCorps, seeing his right column rolling down the slope, while the\r\n31st was melting away, and gradually giving ground under the fire of\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese troops at the Pass of San Antonio, hurried to\r\nFoy’s brigade and started it up the hill to the right of the 31st.\r\nFoy had been told to support that regiment, but had taken Reynier’s\r\norders to mean that he was to follow up its advance when it began\r\nto make headway. His Corps-Commander cantered up to him shouting\r\nangrily, ‘Why don’t you start on the climb? You could get the troops\r\nforward if you choose, but you don’t choose.’ Whereupon Foy rode to\r\nthe leading regiment of his brigade, the 17th Léger, put himself at\r\nits head, and began to ascend the heights, his other regiment, the\r\n70th, following in échelon on his left rear. At this moment Merle’s\r\ndivision was still visible, falling back in great disorder some way\r\nto the right, and pursued by Wallace--a discouraging sight for the\r\nseven battalions that were about to repeat its experiment. Foy chose\r\nas his objective the first and lowest hilltop to the French right of\r\nthe pass of San Antonio, and took his string of columns, the right\r\nalways leading, up towards it at such pace as was possible over the\r\nlong heather, and among the occasional patches of stones. The troops\r\nwhich were in front of them here were those sections of Picton’s\r\ndivision which were neither far away on the English left with Wallace\r\nand Lightburne, nor actively engaged on the road against the 31st\r\nLéger, viz. the right wing of the British 45th under Colonel Meade,\r\nand the Portuguese 8th of the Line which had just been aiding in the\r\nrepulse of Merle. These were soon afterwards joined by one battalion\r\nof the 9th Portuguese from Champlemond’s brigade, and the unattached\r\nbattalion of Thomar militia, which Picton sent up the hill. Yet this\r\nwas still far too small a force to resist Foy’s seven battalions,\r\nunless speedily supported.\r\n\r\nBut support in sufficient quantity was forthcoming. General Leith\r\nhad received orders from Wellington to close in to Picton’s right\r\nif he saw no hostile troops in his own front. As it was clear that\r\nReynier had kept no reserves or flanking detachments to the south\r\nof the high-road, it was possible for the 5th Division to move at\r\nonce[430]. While the fog was still hanging thickly along the crests\r\nof the Serra, Leith ordered a general move of his brigades to the\r\nleft, while Hill detached troops from the southern end of the\r\nposition to occupy the heights which the 5th Division was evacuating.\r\nThis general move to the left was carried out along the rough but\r\nserviceable country-road which passes along the rear of the plateau,\r\nout of sight of the French. At the moment when Foy’s attack was\r\nbeginning, Leith had just reached the Pass of San Antonio, with\r\nSpry’s Portuguese brigade at the head of his column, then the two\r\nbattalions of the Lusitanian legion, and lastly, Barnes’s British\r\nbrigade. One of Dickson’s Portuguese batteries was also with him. He\r\ndropped the guns at the pass to aid Arentschildt’s battery, whose\r\nfire was beginning to slacken from want of ammunition, and left Spry\r\nin their rear and the Legionary battalions on the country-road hard\r\nby, while he brought up Barnes’s brigade to the front, and reported\r\nhis arrival to Picton. The latter said, it appears, that he was\r\nstrong enough at the Pass, but would be obliged if Leith would attend\r\nto the attack which was being made at this moment on the height to\r\nits immediate left[431]. This movement of Foy’s was now becoming\r\ndangerous: forcing his way to the summit under a destructive fire, he\r\nhad met on the edge of the plateau the three Portuguese battalions\r\nand the wing of the British 45th, and had driven them back--the\r\nThomar militia broke and fled down the rear declivity of the heights,\r\nand the 8th Portuguese, though they did not fly, gave way and fell\r\nback in disorder. Just at this moment Leith, with Barnes’s three\r\nbattalions, came up along the communication-road at the back of the\r\nplateau. ‘A heavy fire of musketry,’ writes Leith, ‘was being kept\r\nup upon the heights, the smoke of which prevented a clear view of\r\nthe state of things. But when the rock forming the high part of the\r\nSerra became visible, the enemy appeared to be in full possession of\r\nit, and a French officer was in the act of cheering, with his hat\r\noff, while a continued fire was being kept up from thence, and along\r\nthe whole face of the slope of the Serra, in a diagonal direction\r\ntowards its bottom, by the enemy ascending rapidly in successive\r\ncolumns, formed for an attack upon a mass of men belonging to the\r\nleft battalion of the 8th and the 9th Portuguese, who, having been\r\nseverely pressed, had given way, and were rapidly retiring in\r\ncomplete confusion and disorder. The enemy had dispersed or driven\r\noff everything opposed to him--was in possession of the rocky\r\neminence of the Serra.’ A few of his _tirailleurs_ were even on the\r\nupper edge of the rear slope.\r\n\r\n  [430] Leith’s nephew and aide-de-camp, Leith Hay, had explored\r\n  all the villages in this direction on the previous afternoon,\r\n  with a squadron of Portuguese horse, see his _Narrative_, i. 381.\r\n\r\n  [431] Picton and Leith each rather slur over the part taken by\r\n  the other in their parallel narratives of the crisis. Picton\r\n  says that he took command of Leith’s troops: ‘at this moment\r\n  Major-General Leith’s aide-de-camp came up to report the arrival\r\n  of that general and his division, on which I rode from the post\r\n  of San Antonio to the road of communication, and directed the\r\n  leading regiment of the brigade to proceed without loss of time\r\n  to the left, as I had no occasion for assistance. General Leith’s\r\n  brigade, in consequence, moved on and arrived in time to join the\r\n  five companies of the 45th and the 8th Portuguese in repulsing\r\n  the enemy’s last attempt.’ Leith, on the other hand, speaks of\r\n  having taken command of some of Picton’s troops, as if the latter\r\n  had not been present, and says nought of their conversation.\r\n  ‘Major-General Leith thereupon directed a movement of succession,\r\n  ordering Colonel Douglas with the right battalion of the 8th\r\n  Portuguese to support the point attacked. He also directed the\r\n  9th Portuguese under Colonel Sutton (belonging to Major-General\r\n  Picton’s division) to move up to the support of General Picton’s\r\n  division,’ and again, ‘He (General Leith) ordered the 8th and 9th\r\n  Portuguese to support the point attacked, and where the enemy\r\n  were fast gaining ground.’ Each general speaks as if he had been\r\n  in command, and I fear that each is using undue reticence as to\r\n  the other’s doings. See note at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nLeith, realizing that there was still time to save the position--for\r\nonly the head of the French column had crowned the rocky\r\nknoll,--deployed his leading battalion, the 9th, across the summit of\r\nthe plateau, while sending on his second, the 38th, to get between\r\nthe enemy and the reverse slope of the position. This last move\r\nturned out to be fruitless, for the rear face of the knoll is so\r\nsteep and so thickly covered with large boulders[432], that the 38th\r\nwas unable to climb it, and came back to fall in on the right of\r\nthe 9th. But before it could get back, the senior regiment had done\r\nits work. Leith had led it diagonally across the plateau, so as to\r\nplace it along the flank of the leading battalions of Foy’s column,\r\nof which the first was now ensconced on the summit of the heights,\r\nwhile the others were struggling up to join it. The 9th opened with\r\na volley at 100 yards, and then advanced firing, receiving hardly\r\nany return from the enemy, who seemed entirely disconcerted by the\r\nappearance of a new force parallel with its flank. At twenty yards\r\nfrom the French, the 9th lowered its bayonets and prepared to charge,\r\nLeith riding at its head waving his plumed hat. Then the enemy gave\r\nway. ‘My heroic column,’ writes Foy, ‘much diminished during the\r\nascent, reached the summit of the plateau, which was covered with\r\nhostile troops. Those on our left made a flank movement and smashed\r\nus up by their battalion volleys; meanwhile those on our front,\r\ncovered by some rocks, were murdering us with impunity. The head of\r\nmy column fell back to its right, despite my efforts; I could not\r\nget them to deploy, disorder set in, and the 17th and 70th raced\r\ndown-hill in headlong flight. The enemy pursued us half-way to the\r\nfoot of the heights, till he pulled up on coming under effective fire\r\nfrom our artillery[433].’\r\n\r\n  [432] Napier calls it a ‘precipice,’ but this is not the right\r\n  word. I found that I could walk freely about on it, but no formed\r\n  body of men could have passed up the slope.\r\n\r\n  [433] Foy’s diary, pp. 103-4, tallies exactly with Leith’s\r\n  narrative in _Wellington Supplementary Dispatches_, vi. 678, and\r\n  Cameron’s letter in Napier, Appendix to vol. vi.\r\n\r\nThe battle was now over on this side: Reynier had in reserve only\r\none regiment, the 47th of the Line. His other twenty-two battalions\r\nhad all been beaten to pieces; they had lost over 2,000 men,\r\nincluding more than half their superior officers: Merle commanding\r\nthe 1st Division was wounded, his junior brigadier Graindorge was\r\nkilled; Foy, commanding the first brigade of the other division, was\r\nwounded. Of the six colonels who had gone up the heights, those of\r\nthe 31st Léger, 2nd Léger, 4th Léger, and 70th had been hit: of the\r\ntwenty-three battalion commanders four were killed, seven wounded.\r\nOf 421 officers in all who went into action, 118--more than one\r\nin four--had been disabled. Of the 2,023 casualties, 350 men and\r\nfifteen officers were prisoners in the hands of the British. And\r\nthese losses had been suffered without inflicting any corresponding\r\nloss upon the defenders of the position: Picton’s division had 427\r\nkilled and wounded; Leith’s 160. The only regiments appreciably\r\ndiminished were the 45th, 88th, and Portuguese 8th--with 150, 134,\r\nand 113 casualties respectively. The only superior officers hit were\r\nthe Portuguese brigadier Champlemond, and a major each in the 45th\r\nand 88th. Of the 3rd and 5th Divisions only six British and five\r\nPortuguese battalions had been engaged[434]--the superiority of force\r\nagainst them had been about two to one. Yet Reynier complained in\r\nhis dispatch to Masséna of being crushed by ‘a triple superiority of\r\nnumbers’! As a matter of fact, it was the position that beat him, not\r\nthe imagined numbers of the allies. Wellington could risk much in\r\ntaking up a long line, when he had a good road of communication along\r\nits rear, to shift troops from point to point, and when he could\r\ndescry every movement of the enemy half an hour before it began to\r\ntake effect.\r\n\r\n  [434] Viz. British: Mackinnon’s 1/88th, 1/45th, 74th, Barnes’s\r\n  3/1st, 1/9th, 2/38th. Portuguese: Champlemond’s 9th Line (2\r\n  batts.) and 21st Line (1 batt.), with the 8th from Leith’s\r\n  division (2 batts.). Spry’s brigade and the Lusitanian Legion\r\n  from Leith were never under fire, and did not lose a man.\r\n  Picton’s left brigade (Lightburne) was never engaged, save that\r\n  the light companies of the 5th and 83rd, far down the slope, lost\r\n  eight and four men respectively. The Thomar militia bolted before\r\n  coming under fire.\r\n\r\nThe other half of the battle of Bussaco was an even shorter business\r\nthan Reynier’s struggle with Picton and Leith, but no less bloody\r\nand decisive. Ney exactly obeyed Masséna’s orders to attack, with\r\ntwo divisions, the ground on each side of the Coimbra _chaussée_,\r\nwhen he should see the 2nd Corps lodged on the crest beside the pass\r\nof San Antonio de Cantaro. The many reproaches heaped upon him,\r\nby critics who have not read his orders, for attacking too late,\r\nand not at the same moment as Reynier, are groundless: he was told\r\nto go forward only when his colleague ‘sera maître des hauteurs.’\r\nHe moved precisely when the dispersing mists showed Merle’s great\r\ncolumn massed on the edge of the plateau. Of his three divisions he\r\nhad, again in exact obedience to orders, placed Loison on the right,\r\nMarchand on the left, while Mermet was in reserve, behind Moura.\r\nThe two fighting divisions were completely separated by the deep\r\nand steep ravine of which we have had occasion to speak. The ground\r\nin front of them was very different: Marchand had to advance, by\r\nrather gentle slopes, along the _chaussée_, which curves up towards\r\nthe convent of Bussaco. Loison had to go up a hillside of a very\r\ndifferent sort, whose lower stretch, as far as the village of Sula,\r\nis gentle, and much cut up by woods and orchards, but whose upper\r\nhalf, beyond Sula, is extremely steep and absolutely destitute of\r\ncover. There was no road here, only a rough mule-track.\r\n\r\nLoison started a few minutes before Marchand: he had his two brigades\r\nside by side, Simon’s (six battalions) on the right, Ferey’s (also\r\nsix battalions) on the left. Both started from the low ground in\r\nfront of Sula, each with a strong chain of _tirailleurs_ covering\r\nan advance in serried battalion columns; the 26th regiment was the\r\nleading regiment in Simon’s, the 66th in Ferey’s brigade. On leaving\r\nthe bottom, and advancing among the trees on the lower slope, both\r\nbrigades found their _tirailleurs_ at once checked by a very strong\r\nskirmishing line. Pack had spread out the whole of the 4th Caçadores\r\non the hillside in front of his line battalions. Craufurd had thrown\r\nout the 95th--more than 700 rifles--and the 3rd Caçadores--600 rifles\r\nmore--into the enclosures in front of Sula. The 43rd and 52nd, with\r\nthe 1st Caçadores, were lying down in the hollow road at the head of\r\nthe steep slope above that village, completely concealed from sight.\r\nOf formed troops, Loison could only see the 1st Division far above\r\nhim on the left on the highest plateau of the Serra, and Cole far\r\naway to his right on the lower hillsides towards Paradas. In order\r\nto press in the obstinate light troops in front of him, Loison was\r\ncompelled to push forward whole battalions from his fighting-line: by\r\na strenuous use of these, the Caçadores and Rifles were evicted first\r\nfrom the lower slopes, then from the village of Sula. But when the\r\nlatter had been captured, the French found themselves under a heavy\r\nfire of artillery: Ross’s guns on the knoll above, between their\r\nembrasures of rock, being carefully trained upon the exits of the\r\nvillage, while Cleeves’ German battery joined in from its position at\r\nthe head of the ravine, and took Ferey in flank. It was impossible\r\nto halt in Sula, and Loison ordered his brigadiers to push forward\r\nthe attack once more, taking Ross’s guns and the windmill near them\r\nas their objective. The slope was now much steeper, the British\r\nand Portuguese skirmishers had rallied once more above Sula, and\r\nCraufurd had sent down the 1st Caçadores to feed the fighting-line.\r\nIt was only with a severe effort, and with much loss, that the French\r\nbattalions won their way up the culminating slope. Simon’s front\r\nregiment, the 26th of the Line, stuck to the mule-path up the hill\r\nfrom Sula, in one dense and deep column, with the front of a company\r\nonly, and a depth of three battalions. Ferey’s brigade, having no\r\ntrack to follow, seems to have moved in a somewhat less vicious\r\nformation along the slope further to the left, bordering on the\r\nnorthern edge of the funnel-like ravine which formed the boundary of\r\nCraufurd’s position. Both were in a very disordered condition, owing\r\nto the fierce conflict which they had waged with the screen of Rifles\r\nand Caçadores all up the hillside.\r\n\r\nLying in the hollow road parallel with the head of the ravine were\r\nthe two Line regiments of the Light Division, the 43rd on the right,\r\nthe 52nd on the left. They were very strong battalions, despite their\r\nlosses at the Coa, the one having 800 the other 950 bayonets. In\r\nfront of them, on the sky-line by the little windmill, to the right\r\nof Ross’s guns, Craufurd had been standing all through the earlier\r\nstages of the engagement, watching the gradual progress of the French\r\nup the hillside. He waited patiently till the enemy’s two columns, a\r\nfew hundred yards apart, had reached the last steep of the hillside\r\nbelow him. His recoiling skirmishers were at last thrust in upon\r\nhim--they passed, some to the flanks, some through the intervals\r\nbetween the battalions and the guns, and the front was clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEY’S ATTACK at BUSSACO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REYNIER’S ATTACK at BUSSACO.]\r\n\r\nThen came the opportunity: the French, pulling themselves together,\r\nwere preparing to rush up the last twenty yards of the ascent and to\r\nrun in upon the guns, when Craufurd waved his hat to the battalions\r\nlying in the road behind him, the appointed signal for action, and\r\n(it is said) called to the men behind him ‘Now 52nd, revenge the\r\ndeath of Sir John Moore.’ The crest was at once covered by the\r\nlong red line, and the fronts of the French brigades received such\r\na volley at ten paces as has been seldom endured by any troops in\r\nwar. The whole of the heads of their columns crumbled away in a\r\nmass of dead and dying. The centre and rear stood appalled for\r\none moment; then Major Arbuthnot wheeled in three companies of the\r\n52nd upon the right flank of Simon’s leading regiment, while Lloyd\r\nof the 43rd did the same upon the extreme left, so as to produce a\r\nsemicircle of fire[435]. It was impossible to stand under it, and\r\nthe French broke and went hurtling down the hill, the wrecks of the\r\nfront battalions carrying the rear ones away with them. So steep was\r\nthe slope on their left that some are said to have lost their footing\r\nand to have rolled down to the bottom of the ravine before they\r\ncould stop. The Light Division followed as far as Sula, and beyond,\r\nnot stopping till Loison’s people had taken refuge in the wooded\r\nground beyond that village, and the French guns by Moura had begun\r\nto play upon their pursuers. The rush had carried away the whole\r\nof the enemy, save one battalion upon Ferey’s extreme left, which\r\nhad moved so far down in the slope of the ravine that it had become\r\nseparated from the rest. This solitary column, pressing forward, came\r\nto the sky-line not in front of Craufurd, but at the very head of the\r\nravine, below Cleeves’ battery. Here it was dealt with by the leading\r\nunit of Coleman’s Portuguese brigade, which was standing in line\r\nnear the _chaussée_. The 1st battalion of the 19th regiment, under\r\nMajor McBean, charged it and rolled it back into the cleft, down\r\nwhose bottom it hastily recoiled, and joined the rest of the flying\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n  [435] A passage of Napier’s account of the movements of the Light\r\n  Division (iii. 27) has puzzled many readers. ‘Eighteen hundred\r\n  British bayonets went sparkling over the brow of the hill. Yet\r\n  so hardy were the leading French that every man of the first\r\n  section raised his musket, and two officers and ten soldiers\r\n  (of the 52nd) fell before them. Not a Frenchman had missed his\r\n  mark!’ This passage looks as if the whole French division had\r\n  been conceived by Napier as moving in a single column with a\r\n  front of only twelve men. An eye-witness, Sir John Bell, of the\r\n  52nd, who owned the copy of the book which I now have before\r\n  me, has written Bosh! in the margin against the words. Of\r\n  course the enemy was advancing with each battalion in column of\r\n  companies, with a front of thirty at least. What Napier seems\r\n  to have had in his head was an anecdote told by his brother\r\n  George (_Autobiography_, p. 143). ‘My company met the very head\r\n  of the French column, and immediately calling to my men to form\r\n  column of sections, in order to give more force to our rush, we\r\n  dashed forward. I was in front of my men a yard or two, when a\r\n  Frenchman made a plunge at me with his bayonet, and at the same\r\n  time received the contents of his musket under my hip and fell.\r\n  At the same instant they fired upon my front section, consisting\r\n  of about nine men in the front rank, all of whom fell, four dead,\r\n  the rest wounded.’ But this does not imply that the French column\r\n  was only twelve broad.\r\n\r\nThis made an end of Loison’s two brigades as a serious attacking\r\nforce. They reeled back to their original position, under cover of\r\nthe 25th Léger, which Mermet sent out to relieve them. But later in\r\nthe day they pushed some skirmishers up the hill again, and bickered\r\nwith Craufurd’s outposts. Wellington, seeing that the Light Division\r\nwas fatigued, sent the light companies of Löwe’s German brigade\r\nand A. Campbell’s 6th Caçadores, from the reserves, to take up the\r\nskirmishing. It stood still about Sula, but the French got a few men\r\ninto the village, whom Craufurd had to evict with a company of the\r\n43rd.\r\n\r\nLoison lost, out of 6,500 men used in the attack, twenty-one officers\r\nkilled and forty-seven wounded, with some 1,200 men. His senior\r\nbrigadier, Simon, was wounded in the face, and taken prisoner by a\r\nprivate of the 52nd. The loss of the Light Division was marvellously\r\nsmall--the 3rd Caçadores and the 95th, who had fought through the\r\nlong skirmish up the hill, had seventy-eight and forty-one casualties\r\nrespectively, but the 43rd and 52nd had the astounding record of only\r\nthree men killed, and two officers and eighteen men wounded. McBean’s\r\nPortuguese battalion lost one officer and twenty-five men: the German\r\nlight companies had nearly fifty casualties, but this was later in\r\nthe day. Altogether, Loison’s attack was repelled with a loss of only\r\n200 men to the allies.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to tell of one more section of the Battle of Bussaco;\r\nit was entirely independent of the rest. When Ney started Loison to\r\nhis right of the deep ravine, he had sent forward Marchand’s division\r\nto his left of it, along the great _chaussée_. On turning the sweep\r\nof the road beyond Moura, the leading brigade of this column (6th\r\nLéger and 69th Line, five battalions) came under a terrible artillery\r\nfire from the three batteries which Wellington had placed at the\r\nhead of the ravine, those of Cleeves, Parros, and Lawson. They,\r\nnevertheless, pushed along the road till they came level with a small\r\npine wood on their left, which was full of the skirmishers of Pack’s\r\nPortuguese brigade--the whole of the 4th Caçadores had been sent\r\ndown into it from the height above. The flanking fire of these light\r\ntroops was so galling that the French brigade--apparently without\r\norders and by an instinctive movement--swerved to its left, and went\r\nup the hillside to turn the Caçadores out of their cover. After a\r\nsharp bickering they did so, and then emerging from the wood on to\r\nthe smooth slope of the height below the convent wall, got into a\r\ndesperate musketry duel with Pack’s four Line-battalions, who stood\r\nin front of them. They were now in disorder, and their brigadier,\r\nMaucune, had been wounded. But they made several attempts to storm\r\nthe hillside, which were all beaten back by the Portuguese musketry\r\nand the fire of Lawson’s artillery on the right. The second brigade\r\nof Marchand (that of Marcognet) pushed as far along the road as the\r\npreceding brigade had gone, but stopped when it came under the fire\r\nof Cleeves’ and Parros’s guns, to which that of Ross’s (from across\r\nthe ravine) was also added, when Loison’s attack had been beaten\r\noff. Seeing that Marchand was making no headway, that Loison had\r\nbeen routed, and that Reynier’s corps was out of action, Ney called\r\nback his column, which fell back behind Moura. Maucune’s brigade had\r\nsuffered severely--it had lost its brigadier, the colonel of the 6th\r\nLéger, and thirty-three other officers with some 850 men. The rear\r\nbrigade (Marcognet’s) had suffered less--its casualty list, however,\r\nwas fully 300 killed and wounded. There had been a little skirmishing\r\nmeanwhile opposite Wellington’s centre, for during the main attack\r\nNey had sent forward some voltigeur companies from his reserves to\r\noccupy the line of skirmishers at the foot of the heights, which\r\nSpencer’s 1st Division had thrown out. These two thin screens of\r\nlight troops paired off against each other, and contended all the\r\nmorning with some loss, but no appreciable advantage on either\r\nside[436].\r\n\r\n  [436] Sprünglin, Ney’s aide-de-camp, gives an account of his\r\n  being detached with these voltigeurs, on p. 450 of his diary.\r\n  He lost 142 men. It must have been in contending with these\r\n  companies that the 1st Division (excluding the German brigade,\r\n  occupied elsewhere) got the 89 casualties returned by Wellington,\r\n  as also the 5/60 their 24 casualties. The only one of the British\r\n  battalions in this quarter which had an appreciable number of\r\n  men hurt was the 1/79th. Its regimental history says that its\r\n  light company was almost cut off at the commencement of the day.\r\n  The captain was taken prisoner--being the only British officer\r\n  captured that day--with six men, and there were over 40 other\r\n  casualties. Stopford’s brigade lost two men--Lord Blantyre’s\r\n  seven.\r\n\r\nMasséna still had it in his power to attack again, for Mermet’s\r\ndivision of the 6th Corps, and the whole of Junot’s 13,000 infantry\r\nhad not yet advanced and had hardly lost a man. But the result of\r\nNey’s and Reynier’s efforts had been so disheartening that the\r\nMarshal refused to waste more lives on what was clearly a hopeless\r\nenterprise. He could now see Wellington’s army concentrated on the\r\ntwo points that had been attacked. Hill’s heavy column of 10,000\r\nmen had now lined the heights on Leith’s right: Cole had edged\r\nthe 4th Division close in to Craufurd’s left, and Coleman and the\r\nGermans were visible in the rear. If Masséna had still 20,000 fresh\r\ninfantry, the English general had 33,000 who had not yet come up\r\ninto the fighting-line. It was useless to persist. Accordingly,\r\nthe skirmishing along Ney’s front was allowed to die down in the\r\nafternoon, and the French divisions retired to their camps.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of Wellington’s army had been 1,252 officers and\r\nmen, of whom 200 were killed, 1,001 wounded, and fifty-one missing.\r\nNo officer over the rank of a major had been killed: and the only\r\nsenior officers wounded were the Portuguese brigadier Champlemond and\r\nColonel Barclay of the 52nd. Of the casualties, 626 were in the ranks\r\nof the British, 626 in those of the Portuguese regiments--a strange\r\ncoincidence in the losses of the two allied armies. The Portuguese\r\nline, indeed, had done their fair half of the fighting, as the return\r\nshowed--in no instance with discredit, in some with high merit. If\r\nthe 8th and 9th Portuguese had broken before Foy’s attack, it was\r\nunder severe stress, and when attacked by superior numbers. On the\r\nother hand, Pack’s brigade, Coleman’s 19th, and the Caçadores of the\r\nLight Division won the highest praises from their commanders, and had\r\ntaken a most distinguished part in the victory. Wellington now knew\r\nexactly how far they could be trusted, and could estimate at last the\r\nreal fighting value of his army--at least, for a defensive battle in\r\nchosen and favourable ground. It would be another matter to calculate\r\nhow far the allied host was capable of taking the offensive.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of the French, as shown by the return--which was not\r\nquite complete--presented to Masséna on October 1, was 4,498, of whom\r\n522 were killed, 3,612 wounded, and 364 missing (i.e. prisoners).\r\nAfter his usual fashion he represented it to the Emperor as being\r\n‘about 3,000[437].’ One general (Graindorge), two colonels, and\r\nfifty-two other officers had been killed, four generals (Maucune,\r\nFoy, Merle, Simon) were wounded--the last was also a prisoner; five\r\ncolonels and 189 other officers were wounded. The 2nd Corps in all\r\nhad lost at least 2,043 officers and men, the 6th Corps at least\r\n2,455[438]. It may be remembered that of all the battles in the\r\nPeninsular War this was the one in which the proportion of officers\r\nto men hit on the French side was highest, one to sixteen--the\r\naverage being one to twenty-two in ordinary engagements. The\r\nexcessive proportion of casualties in the commissioned ranks bears\r\nwitness to a desperate attempt to lead on the men to an impossible\r\ntask, in which the officers sacrificed themselves in the most\r\nsplendid style.\r\n\r\n  [437] This too in a dispatch to Berthier dated Coimbra, Oct. 4,\r\n  three days after the returns had been placed before him.\r\n\r\n  [438] For these returns, see Appendix, no. xiii. They are\r\n  certainly incomplete, omitting (1) losses of the cavalry of the\r\n  2nd Corps (where Martinien’s invaluable tables show that three\r\n  officers were wounded), (2) losses of the 8th Corps, which\r\n  caught a few shells as it stood on the heights by Moura and had\r\n  (as again shown by Martinien’s tables) six officers hit, which\r\n  must imply some hundred men. (3) Some casualties in the infantry\r\n  omitted in the returns, for while the report accounts for 253\r\n  killed and wounded officers, Martinien names 275. Deducting the\r\n  cavalry and 8th Corps losses mentioned above, there are still\r\n  fifteen officers (and therefore presumably 250 men) too few given\r\n  in the reports sent in to Masséna; e.g. for the 2nd Léger the\r\n  report has eighteen officers hit, Martinien gives the names of\r\n  twenty-two.\r\n\r\nMasséna must not be too much blamed for his experiment. He had still\r\nto ascertain the fighting value of Wellington’s army--and estimated\r\nit too low, because of the extreme prudence which his adversary\r\nhad hitherto displayed. He was handicapped by the impossibility of\r\nusing his artillery effectively, and the position in front of him\r\nwas strong--even stronger than he guessed, because of the road of\r\ncommunication along the rear of the plateau--but not too strong\r\nto be forced, if the defenders did not fight well. Moreover, it\r\nwas immensely long--nine miles from end to end, so that two blows\r\ndelivered with a corps each in the centre might have pierced the\r\nline before the enemy’s distant reserves could get up. Favoured by\r\nthe fog--as we have seen--Reynier actually won the heights for a\r\nmoment, though Ney never got near the crest. The mistake lay not so\r\nmuch in making the trial as in under-rating the warlike efficiency of\r\nthe enemy. Strokes like Wallace’s charge with the 45th and 88th, or\r\nCraufurd’s masterly advance with the 43rd and 52nd, are beyond the\r\ncommon experiences of war. Masséna put forty-five battalions[439]\r\ninto his fighting-line--they were repulsed by twenty-four, for that\r\nwas the number of Anglo-Portuguese battalions which engaged more than\r\ntheir light-companies[440]. This could not have been foreseen. But\r\nthe lesson was learnt. Before the lines of Torres Vedras, a fortnight\r\nlater, Masséna refused to take any more risks of the kind, and the\r\ncampaign assumed a very different character, because the invader had\r\nlearnt to respect his enemy.\r\n\r\n  [439] Viz. all Reynier’s Corps, save the 47th, twenty-two\r\n  battalions; Marchand eleven battalions, Loison twelve\r\n  battalions--total 26,000 men. See Tables in Appendix.\r\n\r\n  [440] Viz. the brigades of Mackinnon and Champlemond of the 3rd\r\n  Division: the 1st, 9th, 38th, British, and the 8th Portuguese of\r\n  Leith, Craufurd’s five battalions, Pack’s five battalions, three\r\n  battalions of Coleman--total 14,000 men. See Tables in Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) NOTE ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF BUSSACO\r\n\r\nI spent two days in April 1904 and two days in April 1906 in going\r\nvery carefully over the field--save that of its nine-mile length I\r\ndid not investigate closely either Cole’s position on the extreme\r\nnorth, or Hill’s on the extreme south, no fighting having come near\r\neither of them. The ground is so minutely described in the preceding\r\nchapter that only a few additional points require notice.\r\n\r\n(1) The ravine which lay between Pack and Craufurd, and between\r\nMarchand and Loison, is a feature which no map can properly express,\r\nand which no one who has not gone very carefully over the hillside\r\ncan fully picture to himself. It produces an absolute want of\r\ncontinuity between the two fights which went on to its right and left.\r\n\r\n(2) The Mondego is not visible from any point of the line of heights\r\ntill Hill’s position is reached. It is sunk far below the level of\r\nthe upland.\r\n\r\n(3) The San Antonio-Palheiros road is a mere country track, barely\r\ndeserving the name of road, though practicable for artillery and\r\nvehicles. The _chaussée_ Moura-Bussaco is a high-road of the first\r\nclass, admirably engineered. The paths across the Serra at Hill’s end\r\nof it are wretched mule-tracks, not suitable for wheeled traffic. So\r\nis the track from Sula up the slope to Craufurd’s standing-place.\r\n\r\n(4) The view from the summit of the Serra is very extensive,\r\nembracing on the one side all the slopes of the Estrella as far as\r\nGuarda, and on the other the whole coast-plain of Coimbra as far\r\nas the sea. But in each direction there is so much wood and hill\r\nthat many roads and villages are masked. The French army, both in\r\nadvance and retreat, was only intermittently visible. But enough\r\ncould be made out to determine its general movements with fair\r\nprecision. When it reached the foot-hills before the Serra every\r\ndetail of its disposition could be followed by an observer on any\r\npart of the crest, save that below Sula woods in the bottom hide the\r\nstarting-point of Loison’s division.\r\n\r\n(5) In the chapel by the side of the _chaussée_, just behind the\r\nsky-line of the English position, the traveller will find a little\r\nmuseum, including a very fine topographical map, with the position of\r\nthe allied troops, and more especially of the Portuguese regiments,\r\nwell marked. There are a few errors in the placing of the British\r\nbattalions, but nothing of consequence. The French army is only\r\nvaguely indicated. But the map is a credit to the Portuguese engineer\r\nofficers who compiled it.\r\n\r\n(6) As I have observed in the next chapter, the ground to the north,\r\nalong the Serras de Alcoba and de Caramula, is not so uniformly\r\nlofty, or so forbidding in its aspect, as to cause the observer\r\nto doubt whether there can be any pass across the watershed in\r\nthat direction. Indeed, the first idea that strikes the mind on\r\nreaching the summit of the Serra, and casting a glance round the\r\nwide landscape, is that it is surprising that any officer in the\r\nFrench army can have believed that the Caramula was absolutely\r\nimpracticable. Moreover it is far less easily defensible than the\r\nBussaco ridge, because it is much more broken and full of cover. The\r\nbeauty of the Bussaco position is that, save on the Moura-Sula spurs,\r\nit is entirely bare of cover on the side facing eastward. The smooth,\r\nsteep slope, with its furze and heather and its occasional outcrops\r\nof rock, makes a splendid glacis. The reverse space would be a far\r\nworse position to defend, against an enemy coming from Coimbra and\r\nthe coast-plain, because it is thickly interspersed with woods.\r\n\r\n(7) With the possible exception of some of the Pyrenean\r\nfighting-grounds, Bussaco gives the most beautiful landscape of\r\nany of the British battlefields of the Peninsula. Albuera is tame,\r\nTalavera is only picturesque at its northern end, Salamanca is\r\nrolling ground with uninteresting ploughed fields, save where the two\r\nArapiles crop up in their isolated ruggedness. Fuentes d’Oñoro is\r\na pretty hillside, such as one may see in any English county, with\r\nmeadow below and rough pasture above. Vimiero is dappled ground, with\r\nmany trees but no commanding feature. But the loftiness, the open\r\nbreezy air, the far-reaching view over plain, wood, mountain, and\r\ndistant sea, from the summit of the Bussaco Serra is unique in its\r\nbeauty. It is small wonder that the modern Portuguese have turned it\r\ninto a health-resort, or that the British colony at Oporto have fixed\r\non the culminating plateau as the best golf-course in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) NOTE ON THE CRISIS OF THE BATTLE OF BUSSACO\r\n\r\nWhile there is no point of dispute concerning that part of the\r\nBattle of Bussaco in which Craufurd, Pack, and Coleman were engaged\r\nagainst the 6th Corps, there was bitter controversy on the exact\r\ndetails of the repulse of Reynier’s corps by Picton and Leith.\r\nPicton, and following him his subordinates of the 3rd Division,\r\nthought that Leith’s part in the action was insignificant, that he\r\nmerely repulsed a minor attack after the main struggle was over.\r\nLeith and his officers considered that they gave the decisive blow,\r\nthat Picton’s line would have been broken and the battle perhaps\r\nlost, if Barnes’s brigade had not arrived at the critical moment\r\nand saved the situation. All that Picton would allow was that Leith\r\n‘aided the wing of the 45th and the 8th Portuguese in repulsing the\r\nenemy’s last attempt.’ Grattan, who wrote an admirable narrative\r\nof the defeat of Merle’s division by the 88th and the neighbouring\r\ntroops, denied that the 3rd Division was ever pressed, says that he\r\nnever saw Leith’s men till the action was over, and points out that\r\nBarnes’s brigade, out of 1,800 bayonets, lost but 47 men altogether,\r\nwhile the 45th regiment alone lost thrice, and the 88th more than\r\ntwice, as many killed and wounded out of their scanty numbers (150\r\nand 134 out of 560 and 679 respectively). Other 3rd Division officers\r\nsuggest (see the letters in the Appendix to Napier’s sixth volume)\r\nthat Leith fought only with a belated body of French skirmishers,\r\nor with men who had been cut off from the main attacking column by\r\nthe successful advance of Wallace. On the other hand Leith (see his\r\nletter in Wellington, _Supplementary Dispatches_, vol. vi, p. 678)\r\nspeaks of coming on the ground to find a large French column crossing\r\nthe Serra, and the Portuguese 8th and 9th broken, and about to recoil\r\ndown the rear slope. His aide-de-camp, Leith-Hay, and Cameron of the\r\n9th bear him out.\r\n\r\nNapier has failed to make the situation clear, from not seeing that\r\nthere were two completely separate attacks of the French, divided by\r\nan appreciable interval. He thinks that Foy was on the Serra as soon\r\nas Merle, and calls his column (iii. p. 25) ‘the French battalions\r\nwhich had first gained the crest,’ while as a matter of fact they had\r\nonly started after Wallace’s repulse of Merle was long over.\r\n\r\nThe real situation is made clear when Reynier’s and Heudelet’s\r\ndispatches in the French Archives and Foy’s diary are studied. From\r\nthese it is clear that there were _two_ occasions on which the French\r\ngot to the top of the Serra, the first during Merle’s attack, the\r\nsecond during Foy’s. I have quoted Foy’s narrative on p. 377 above;\r\nbut it may be well to give also his note showing the starting-time of\r\nhis column. ‘La première division (Merle) a gravi la montagne en se\r\njettant à droite. Mais à peine les têtes arrivaient sur le plateau,\r\nqu’attaquées tout à coup par des troupes immensement supérieures en\r\nnombre, fraîches et vigoureuses, elles ont été culbutées en bas de\r\nla montagne dans le plus grand désordre. Ma brigade s’était portée\r\nau pied de la montagne, devant soutenir le 31e Léger. Au moment de\r\nl’échec de la 1re division j’ai fait halte un moment pour ne pas\r\nêtre entraîné par les fuyards.’ It was only at this instant, when\r\nthe fugitives from Merle’s attack were pouring past him, that he got\r\nhis orders from Reynier to attack, and started to climb the slope.\r\nThere must, therefore, have been an interval of more than half an\r\nhour--possibly of an hour--between the moment when Wallace thrust\r\nMerle off the plateau, and that at which Foy crowned it, only to be\r\nattacked and beaten by the newly arrived Leith. For it took a very\r\nlong time for the French 17th and 70th to climb the slope, and they\r\nonly reached the top with difficulty, the skirmishers of the 8th and\r\n9th Portuguese and of Meade’s wing of the 45th having fought hard to\r\nkeep them back.\r\n\r\nReynier’s dispatch is equally clear as to his corps having made two\r\nseparate attacks. He adds that some of Sarrut’s men were rallied in\r\ntime to support Foy, a statement for which I find no corroboration\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nNapier then has failed to grasp the situation, when he makes the\r\nFrench crown the crest above the pass of San Antonio and the crest\r\nopposite Wallace, 900 yards further north, at the same moment. And\r\nthe statement that Leith’s charge was directed against the other\r\nflank of the same mass that was beaten by the 88th and 45th is\r\naltogether erroneous.\r\n\r\nLeith’s narrative of the business, in short, fits in with the French\r\nstory, and must be considered correct. Picton cannot be acquitted\r\nof deliberate belittling of the part taken by his colleague in the\r\naction. Foy’s attack, though made by only seven battalions, while\r\nMerle had eleven, was the more dangerous of the two, and was defeated\r\nby Leith alone, after the small fraction of Picton’s force in front\r\nof it had been broken and thrust back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S RETREAT TO THE LINES OF TORRES VEDRAS (OCTOBER 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dawn of September 28 brought small comfort to Masséna. His\r\ndesperate attacks of the preceding day had been repulsed with such\r\nease and such heavy loss, that neither he nor any of his subordinates\r\ndreamed of renewing the attempt to force the line of the Serra. Only\r\nthree courses were open to him--to retreat on Almeida, giving up\r\nthe campaign as one too ambitious for the strength of his army, or\r\nto change his objective and strike backwards at Oporto,--if Lisbon\r\nwere beyond his grasp,--or to endeavour to move Wellington out of\r\nhis position by turning his flank, since a frontal attack had proved\r\ndisastrous. The first course was advocated by more than one adviser,\r\nbut presented no attractions to the Marshal: he was both obstinate\r\nand angry, and did not dream for a moment of spoiling his military\r\nreputation by retreating tamely after a lost battle. The blow at\r\nOporto was equally unattractive: he had been told to drive the\r\nEnglish out of Portugal, and to capture Lisbon, not to make a mere\r\nlodgement on the Douro. Moreover, as he had remarked to Ney before\r\nthe battle, if he marched on Oporto by the bad road via Vizeu, he\r\nmight find the British army once more in his front, when he drew\r\nnearer to the city, since the Coimbra-Oporto _chaussée_ is both\r\nshorter and better than the by-roads which he would have to follow.\r\nThere remained the third possibility--that of turning Wellington out\r\nof the Bussaco position by flanking operations. The country-side did\r\nnot look very promising, but the attempt must be made.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 28th the French cavalry was sent out in both directions\r\nto explore the whole neighbourhood--a task which Masséna should have\r\nprescribed to it on the 25th and 26th, instead of keeping it massed\r\nin his rear. The reconnaissances sent southward by Reynier’s light\r\ncavalry brought no encouraging report: if the French army crossed the\r\nMondego, it would only run against Wellington’s carefully prepared\r\nposition behind the Alva. Fane’s cavalry were out in this direction,\r\nand would give ample time of warning to allow the allied army to pass\r\nthe fords of Peña Cova and man the long series of earthworks. Only a\r\nrepetition of the Bussaco disaster could follow from an attempt to\r\ntake the offensive on this side. From the north, however, Montbrun,\r\nwho had ridden out with some of Sainte-Croix’s dragoons, brought far\r\nmore cheering news. This indeed was the flank where, on the first\r\nprinciples of topography, some hope of success might have been looked\r\nfor. To any one standing either on the Bussaco heights or on the\r\nlower ridge in front of them, and casting an eye over the dappled\r\nand uneven country-side to the north, it seems incredible that there\r\nshould be no route whatever across the Serra de Caramula. Both the\r\nseacoast-plain of Beira and the valley of the Oerins, the little\r\nriver which drains the plain of Mortagoa, were thickly populated. Was\r\nit likely that there would be no means of getting from the one to the\r\nother save by the _chaussée_ through Bussaco, or the circuitous road\r\nfar to the north, from Vizeu to Aveiro via Feramena and Bemfeita?\r\nThe maps, it is true, showed no other route: but every day that he\r\nremained in Portugal was proving more clearly to the Marshal that his\r\nmaps, Lopez and the rest, were hopelessly inaccurate. The Serra de\r\nCaramula, though rugged, is not one continuous line of precipices,\r\nnor is it of any great altitude. On first principles it was probable\r\nthat there might be one or more passages in this stretch of thirty\r\nmiles, though it was conceivable that there might be no road over\r\nwhich artillery could travel[441].\r\n\r\n  [441] As a matter of fact, the modern railway from Coimbra and\r\n  Pampilhosa to the upper Mondego does not use the pass of Bussaco,\r\n  but goes north of it, round the left flank of Wellington’s\r\n  position, by Luso, far south of the Boialvo road to Mortagoa.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, nothing astonishing in the fact that Montbrun\r\ndiscovered that such a track existed, nine miles north of Bussaco,\r\nrunning from Mortagoa, by Aveleira and Boialvo, to Sardão in the\r\nvalley of the Agueda, one of the affluents of the Vouga. There was\r\nnothing particularly startling in the discovery, nor did it imply\r\nany special perspicacity in the discoverers, as many of the French\r\nnarratives seek to imply. A peasant captured in one of the deserted\r\nvillages high up the Oerins, and cross-questioned by Masséna’s\r\nPortuguese aide-de-camp Mascarenhas, who accompanied Sainte-Croix on\r\nhis reconnaissance, revealed the fact that this country-road existed.\r\nHe even, it is said, expressed to his compatriot his surprise that\r\nthe French had not taken it when first they arrived at Mortagoa,\r\nsince it was unguarded, while the whole allied army was lying\r\nacross the Bussaco _chaussée_. It was, he said, habitually used by\r\nthe ox-waggons of the peasantry: it was not a good road, but was a\r\nperfectly practicable one.\r\n\r\nWith this all-important news Montbrun and Sainte-Croix returned to\r\nMasséna about midday. The Marshal at once resolved to make an attempt\r\nto utilize the Boialvo road. There was some danger in doing so,\r\nsince it was possible that Wellington might wait till the greater\r\npart of the French army had retired from his front, and then descend\r\nupon the rearguard and overwhelm it. Or, on the other hand, he might\r\nhave made preparations to hold the further end of the pass, so that\r\nwhen the vanguard of the invaders was nearing Boialvo or Sardão they\r\nmight find 20,000 men, withdrawn from the Bussaco position in haste,\r\nlying across their path at some dangerous turn of the road. Indeed,\r\nwe may confidently assert that if in 1810 the British general had\r\npossessed the army that he owned in 1813, Masséna would have had\r\nthe same unpleasant experience that befell Soult at Sorauren, when\r\nhe attempted a precisely similar manœuvre--a flank march round the\r\nallied army on the day after a lost battle.\r\n\r\nBut Masséna was prepared to take risks, and the risk which he was now\r\naccepting was a considerably less perilous one than that which he\r\nhad incurred when he chose to make a frontal attack on the Bussaco\r\nposition on the preceding day. For though flank marches across an\r\nenemy’s front are justly deprecated by every military authority, this\r\nwas one executed at a distance of nine or ten miles from the British\r\nline, and not in a level country, on to which Wellington might\r\neasily descend from his fastness, but in a broken wooded upland,\r\nfull of ridges on which the French might have formed up to fight if\r\nassailed. If this fact did not remove the danger, it at any rate made\r\nit infinitely less. If one of the two possible contretemps should\r\nhappen--if Wellington should come down with a sudden rush upon the\r\nrearguard--that force would have to fight a defensive action on the\r\nridges below Bussaco, till the main body could turn back to help it.\r\nIn that case there would follow a pitched battle upon rolling and\r\nuneven ground, which did not favour one side more than the other;\r\nand this, at any rate, would be a more favourable situation for\r\nthe French than that in which they had fought on Sept. 27. If, on\r\nthe other hand, Wellington should send a strong detachment to hold\r\nthe western debouch of the Boialvo road, nothing would be lost--if\r\nnothing would be gained. It was improbable that there would be any\r\nposition in that quarter quite so strong as the tremendous slope of\r\nthe Serra de Bussaco. The result of an attempt to force the defile\r\nmight be successful.\r\n\r\nAt any rate Masséna thought the experiment worthy of a trial.\r\nAccordingly, on the afternoon of the 28th, ostentatious\r\ndemonstrations were made against the front of the Bussaco position,\r\nwhich led to a good deal of objectless skirmishing[442]. Wellington\r\nwas not for a moment deceived. Indeed, the idea that another assault\r\nwas impending was negatived by the fact that both Reynier’s and Ney’s\r\nmen were seen to be throwing up _abattis_ and digging trenches on the\r\nflanks of the two roads on which they lay. These could only be meant\r\nfor defensive use, and presumably must be intended to help the French\r\nrearguard to hold the ridges, if the Anglo-Portuguese army should\r\ndescend upon them. Late in the afternoon officers furnished with good\r\ntelescopes, and stationed on the highest point of the Bussaco Serra,\r\nreported that they could detect columns in movement from the French\r\nrear in the direction of the north-west. These were Sainte-Croix’s\r\ncavalry and the baggage-trains of Ney and Junot making their way to\r\nthe rear, in order to get into the Mortagoa-Boialvo road. At six\r\no’clock, dusk having still not come on, it was reported that Ney’s\r\ninfantry reserves were certainly moving in the same direction. Only\r\nLoison’s division was still immovable on its old position opposite\r\nSula. At nightfall, therefore, the movement of the French was well\r\nascertained. It might mean merely a general retreat on Mortagoa and\r\nan abandonment of the campaign[443], but this was most unlikely. Far\r\nmore probable was some march to turn the allied flank by the passes\r\nof the Serra de Caramula. Wellington himself had no doubt whatever\r\nthat this was the enemy’s intention. As the dusk fell he stood for\r\nsome time on the summit of the Serra, watching the French columns\r\nreceding in the distance. He then rode back to his head quarters at\r\nthe convent of Bussaco, and dictated without delay a series of orders\r\nwhich set his whole army in retreat for Coimbra and Lisbon. Before\r\ndaylight the position was deserted, only a rearguard being left on\r\nit. He does not seem to have thought for a moment of attacking, on\r\nthe following morning, the 2nd Corps and Loison’s division, which\r\nhad been left in his front, nor of directing his right wing to\r\nmarch on Sardão, which it could have reached long before the French\r\narrived there. Each of these courses was so obvious that critics have\r\nlavished blame upon him for not adopting the one or the other[444].\r\n\r\n  [442] The firing commenced soon after 12 noon. See Tomkinson, p.\r\n  44.\r\n\r\n  [443] This was imagined to be the case by some observers, who\r\n  overrated Masséna’s loss, and thought he had 10,000 casualties on\r\n  the 27th.\r\n\r\n  [444] See, for example, Fririon, pp. 55-6, Toreno, ii. 164.\r\n  Thiers, and even Napier, iii. 32-3.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of his conduct is neither that he failed to see the\r\ntwo alternatives which were in his power, nor that he showed (as\r\nseveral French writers maintain) an excessive timidity. Still less is\r\nit possible to urge, as some have done, that he was ruined by his own\r\nneglect to occupy the Boialvo road. He knew of that pass, had taken\r\nit into consideration, and in one of his dispatches speaks vaguely\r\nof a means which he was hoping to discover to render it useless to\r\nthe enemy[445]. This remedy cannot mean, as some have supposed, the\r\nmoving thither of Trant’s corps of Portuguese militia. It is true\r\nthat Wellington had ordered this force to occupy Sardão some days\r\nbefore. But it was neither large enough, nor composed of troops solid\r\nenough, to resist, even in a strong position, the attack of a single\r\nFrench brigade. Some other device must have been meant, though we\r\ncannot determine what it may have been. The true key to Wellington’s\r\naction is to remember the immense pains that he had taken in building\r\nthe Lines of Torres Vedras, and the elaborate arrangements that\r\nhad been made during the last few weeks to complete the system for\r\ndevastating Portugal in front of the enemy. It was by these means,\r\nand not by fights in the open, that he had from the first designed\r\nto defeat the invader. Bussaco had been an ‘uncovenanted mercy’: if\r\nMasséna chose to run his head against that stone wall, it was worth\r\nwhile to man it, and to permit him to break himself against its\r\ngranite boulders. But such an operation as descending into the plain\r\nto attack the 2nd Corps on the 29th, or offering battle in front of\r\nSardão on that same day, was not within the scope of Wellington’s\r\nintentions. If he had wished to engage in that sort of fighting,\r\nhe had already had ample opportunities to attack sections of the\r\nFrench army during the last two months. But to get engaged with one\r\ncorps in a rolling upland, and then to have the other two converging\r\non him while the fight was in progress, he had never intended--nor\r\nwould he do so now. He gave his orders for the retreat of the army\r\non Coimbra actually before the French had possession of their own\r\nend of the Boialvo pass, and at a moment when a single night march\r\nwould have sufficed to place Cole, Craufurd, and Spencer across the\r\nwestern end of it, with ample time to choose a position before the\r\nenemy could arrive in front. He explains his refusal to do so in his\r\n‘Memorandum of Operations in 1810’ in the following terms: ‘It would\r\nhave been impossible to detach a corps from the army to occupy the\r\nSerra de Caramula after the action of the 27th. That corps might have\r\nbeen hard pressed and obliged to retreat, in which case it must have\r\nretreated upon Sardão and the north of Portugal. It could not have\r\nrejoined the army, and its services would have been wanting in the\r\nfortified position in front of Lisbon. It was therefore determined\r\nto rely upon Colonel Trant alone to occupy the Serra de Caramula,\r\nas his line of operations and retreat was to the northward. Nothing\r\ncould have been done, except by detaching a large corps, to prevent\r\nthe French from throwing a large force across the Caramula. When,\r\ntherefore, they took that road, there was nothing for it but to\r\nwithdraw from Bussaco. And, after quitting Bussaco, there was no\r\nposition that we could take up with advantage, in which we could\r\nbe certain that we could prevent the enemy from getting to Lisbon\r\nbefore us, till we reached the fortified positions in front of that\r\nplace[446].’ As to the other possibility, that of attacking the\r\nFrench rearguard below Bussaco instead of endeavouring to stop its\r\nvanguard at Sardão, Wellington only observes that ‘they had at least\r\n12,000 or 14,000 more men than we had, and good as our position was,\r\ntheirs was equally good.’ If he had fallen upon Reynier, the latter\r\n(he thought) could have detained him long enough to allow Ney and\r\nJunot to return, and so he would have found himself committed to an\r\noffensive action against superior numbers on unfavourable ground.\r\n\r\n  [445] _Dispatches_, vi. 460. Had he proposed to blast away\r\n  sections, so as to make it impassable for wheel traffic, as he\r\n  did with the Estrada Nova?\r\n\r\n  [446] _Dispatches_, vii. pp. 306-7.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are unanswerable when we consider Wellington’s\r\nposition. He _might_ have succeeded in checking Masséna at Boialvo\r\nor Sardão; but, if he did not, ruin would ensue, since he might be\r\ncut off from the detached corps, and then would not have men enough\r\nto hold the Lines of Torres Vedras. He _might_ have crushed Reynier\r\nbefore he was succoured, but if he failed to do so, and became\r\ninvolved in a general action, a disastrous defeat was possible. In\r\nshort, considering what failure would mean--the loss of Lisbon,\r\nthe re-embarkation of the army, probably the end of the Peninsular\r\nWar--he rightly hesitated to take any risk whatever. At the same\r\ntime, we may suspect that if the allied army of 1810 had been the\r\narmy of 1813, Wellington might very possibly have played a more\r\nenterprising game. But the Portuguese still formed the larger half of\r\nhis force, and though he had ascertained by their behaviour on the\r\n27th that they were now capable of fighting steadily in a defensive\r\naction on favourable ground, it was nevertheless very doubtful\r\nwhether he could dare to risk them in a battle fought under different\r\nconditions. One cheering example of the courage and discipline of\r\nthese newly organized regiments did not justify him in taking it for\r\ngranted that they could be trusted under all possible conditions, as\r\nif they were veteran British troops.\r\n\r\nOn the dawn of Sept. 29, therefore, the two armies were marching\r\naway from each other. On the Bussaco position there remained only\r\nCraufurd’s Light Division, strengthened by Anson’s cavalry brigade,\r\nwhich was brought up behind the Serra, to form the mounted section\r\nof the force which was for the next ten days to act as the rearguard\r\nof the allied army. Opposite them only Reynier remained, and he had\r\ndrawn far back on to the Mortagoa road, where he stood in a defensive\r\nposition in the morning, but retired, brigade after brigade, in the\r\nafternoon. The main body of Wellington’s army was retiring in two\r\ncolumns: Hill, and Hamilton’s Portuguese division crossed the fords\r\nof Peña Cova and marched for Espinhal and Thomar. The force which\r\nhad been left far out on the right behind the Alva--Fane’s cavalry\r\nand Lecor’s Portuguese militia--joined Hill and accompanied him to\r\nLisbon. This column was absolutely unmolested by the enemy during\r\nthe whole twelve days of the retreat to the Lines. The French did\r\nnot so much as follow it with a cavalry patrol. The other and larger\r\ncolumn, formed of Spencer, Cole, Leith, and Picton, with Pack’s,\r\nColeman’s, and Alex. Campbell’s Portuguese, marched for Mealhada and\r\nCoimbra. Craufurd and Anson started twelve hours later to bring up\r\nthe rear. During the hours while the Light Division was waiting its\r\norders to start, some of its officers explored the evacuated French\r\nposition, and found parked in an enclosure 400 desperately wounded\r\nsoldiers, whom Masséna had abandoned to the mercy of the Portuguese\r\npeasantry. He had used up all available carts and mules to carry his\r\nwounded, but had been forced to leave the worst cases behind. They\r\nwere picked up and moved into the convent of Bussaco[447]; on what\r\nbecame of them afterwards it is well not to speculate. No friendly\r\ncolumn came that way again[448], and the Ordenança were daily growing\r\nmore exasperated at the conduct of the invading army. The French were\r\nnot only carrying out in an intermittent fashion Masséna’s edict of\r\nSept. 4, directing that all men with arms but without uniforms were\r\nto be shot at sight, but burning every village that they passed, and\r\nmurdering nearly every peasant that they could hunt down, whether he\r\nwas bearing arms or no[449].\r\n\r\n  [447] See Tomkinson, p. 44, and von Linsingen’s Diary, in\r\n  Beamish, i. 292. Fririon and the other French narratives speak of\r\n  the difficulties of transporting the wounded, but do not mention\r\n  that any were abandoned.\r\n\r\n  [448] Unless some of Reynier’s rearguard cavalry may have looked\r\n  in at Bussaco on the 30th, when Craufurd had gone. This is\r\n  possible. Trant’s Portuguese were back in the place on Oct. 4.\r\n\r\n  [449] This seems proved by the ‘Table of Damages committed by the\r\n  French Army in 1810-11,’ published by the Coimbra authorities\r\n  in 1812, which gives the number of houses burnt and persons\r\n  killed in each rural-deanery (arcyprestado) of the bishopric\r\n  of Coimbra. Omitting the rural-deaneries south of the Mondego,\r\n  where the damages were mainly done during the retreat of the\r\n  French in March 1811, and taking only those north of the river,\r\n  where no hostile column appeared after October 1810--the district\r\n  having been protected by Trant and Wilson during Masséna’s return\r\n  march,--we find the following statistics:--\r\n\r\n  Deanery of Mortagoa     108 murders  19 villages and 47 isolated\r\n                                            houses burnt.\r\n      ”      Oliveirinha  102    ”    100 houses burnt.\r\n      ”      Arazede       99    ”    124      ”\r\n      ”      Coimbra city  14    ”      7      ”\r\n\r\n  The figures for the deaneries south of Mondego (Soure, Arganil,\r\n  Redinha, Miranda do Corvo, Sinde, Cea) are enormously higher. See\r\n  Soriano da Luz, iii. 203.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the 29th and 30th of September, the French army\r\nwas executing its flank march, practically unopposed, though not\r\nunobserved. Sainte-Croix’s division of dragoons was at the head of\r\nthe line of march: then came the infantry of the 8th Corps, which\r\nhad been put in the vanguard because it had not suffered at Bussaco.\r\nNext came the reserve cavalry of Montbrun, followed by the Grand\r\nPark and the massed baggage of the 6th and 8th Corps, mixed with a\r\nconvoy of over 3,000 wounded. Ney’s troops brought up the rear of\r\nthe main column. Reynier was a day’s march to the rear; having spent\r\nthe 29th opposite the Bussaco heights, he only reached Mortagoa that\r\nevening. Sainte-Croix’s cavalry on this same day had passed the\r\nwatershed and reached Avellans de Cima, where they met a patrol of\r\nDe Grey’s dragoons, who had sent parties out in all directions, from\r\ntheir head quarters at Mealhada in the coast-plain. From this time\r\nonward the French advanced guard was watched by the four regiments\r\nof Slade and De Grey, who were directed to hold back its exploring\r\ncavalry, and not to permit it to reach Coimbra an hour sooner than\r\ncould be helped. There was also a clash on the afternoon of the 30th\r\nbetween part of Sainte-Croix’s dragoons and the Portuguese militia\r\nof Trant in front of Sardão. Trant had been ordered to be at that\r\nplace on September 27: he only arrived there on the afternoon of\r\nthe 28th, not by his own fault, but because his superior officer\r\nBaccelar, commanding the whole militia of the North, had ordered him\r\nto move from Lamego to Sardão by the circuitous road along the Douro,\r\nand then from Feira southward, instead of taking the straight road\r\nacross, the mountains north of Vizeu, where he might possibly have\r\nbeen stopped by some outlying French detachment. Trant had at the\r\nmoment only a squadron of dragoons and four militia regiments with\r\nhim (Porto, Penafiel, Coimbra, and a battalion of light companies),\r\nand these, from hard marching, and from desertion, were in all less\r\nthan 3,000 strong. Knowing that he was expected to hold the debouch\r\nof the Boialvo road against anything short of a strong force, Trant\r\nmade an attempt to stand his ground. But his vanguard bolted at\r\nthe first shot fired, and with the rest he had to make a hurried\r\nretreat beyond the Vouga, leaving the road free to the French[450].\r\nSainte-Croix had already pushed in between him and the British\r\ncavalry, who now began to make a slow retreat towards Mealhada. At\r\nthat place, early on the 30th, Slade and De Grey were joined by\r\nAnson’s eight squadrons, who had come in at the tail of Craufurd’s\r\ndivision after the rearguard evacuated the Bussaco position. On\r\nthis day the main column of the British infantry marched through\r\nCoimbra, leaving the Light Division alone in the city. Wellington’s\r\nhead quarters that night were at Condeixa six miles south of the\r\nMondego. The three cavalry brigades retired, bickering with the\r\nFrench advanced guard all day, as far as Fornos, eight miles north of\r\nCoimbra. Masséna’s infantry, after emerging from the Boialvo pass,\r\nwere now pushing south, and bivouacked on the night of the 30th,\r\nNey and Junot’s corps at Mealhada, Reynier’s at Barreiro, ten miles\r\nbehind the others. The biscuit which the French army had taken with\r\nit from Almeida was now almost exhausted, and it was a great relief\r\nto the troops to find, in the deserted villages of the plain of\r\nCoimbra, considerable quantities of maize and rice, with which they\r\ncould eke out or replace the carefully hoarded rations.\r\n\r\n  [450] I cannot resist quoting here Trant’s account of the\r\n  engagement. He was a man of quaint humour, and the all too few\r\n  letters from him to General J. Wilson, which have come into my\r\n  hands by the courtesy of Wilson’s representative, Captain Bertram\r\n  Chambers, R.N., inspire me with regret that I have not his whole\r\n  correspondence. ‘I have once more been putting my fellows to a\r\n  trial--my Caçadore battalion did not do as it ought, and had\r\n  about thirty killed, wounded, and prisoners, without making\r\n  scarcely any resistance--a pleasant business. On the 30th I was\r\n  still at Agueda (Sardão and Agueda are one village, properly\r\n  speaking, but divided by a bridge), though I was aware that\r\n  the French principal force of cavalry was at Boyalva, only a\r\n  league from Agueda, and I was completely cut off from the army.\r\n  On that morning I had withdrawn the infantry to the Vouga, but\r\n  placed my dragoons close to Agueda to observe the French, with\r\n  the Caçadores at a half-way distance to support them. I put\r\n  them in the most advantageous possible position, protected by a\r\n  close pine wood, through which the French cavalry must pass. I\r\n  had been from three in the morning till one o’clock, making my\r\n  arrangements, and had just sat down to eat something, in a small\r\n  village on the left of the Vouga, when a dragoon came flying to\r\n  inform me that the French were coming on with two columns of\r\n  cavalry in full speed. My coffee was not ready, and remained for\r\n  the French to amuse themselves with. I had only time to get the\r\n  Penafiel regiment over the bridge when the French arrived--five\r\n  minutes sooner and I had been nabbed! I drew up in a good\r\n  position, but the French did not cross the Vouga, and I returned\r\n  to Oliveira without molestation--but not without a damned false\r\n  alarm and panic on the part of the dragoons who were covering my\r\n  rear. They galloped through the infantry, and carried confusion\r\n  and all the comforts of hell to Oporto! Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  ‘Bravoure Bombasto,’ who commanded the Caçadores, ordered his men\r\n  to fire, but thought that enough for his honour, as he instantly\r\n  left them to shift for themselves, and never looked behind till\r\n  he reached Oporto. I put this fellow, with four of the leading\r\n  dragoons, into the common dungeon of this place, and am about\r\n  to inflict some divisional punishment, for I daren’t report\r\n  such conduct to the Marshal (Beresford), who does not punish by\r\n  halves! My regiments of infantry--this is the brighter side of\r\n  the picture--showed no agitation, notwithstanding the attack\r\n  on their nerves. The enemy’s force, I now ascertain, was 800\r\n  cavalry, two pieces, and two infantry regiments. The cavalry\r\n  alone would have done my business if they had crossed the Vouga!\r\n  But they contented themselves with driving in the dragoons and\r\n  the Caçadore battalion from Agueda. God bless you. N.T.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the city of Coimbra was full of distressing scenes. Though\r\nWellington had ordered the whole population of Western Beira to\r\nleave their abodes as soon as the French reached Vizeu, yet only\r\nthe richest of the inhabitants of Coimbra had departed. The bulk\r\nhad still held to their houses, and the news of the victory of\r\nBussaco had encouraged them to hope that no evacuation would be\r\nnecessary. The Portuguese government, though it had consented to\r\ncarry out Wellington’s scheme of devastation, and had duly published\r\nproclamations commanding its execution, had taken no great pains to\r\nsecure obedience to it. The sacrifice, indeed, that was demanded\r\nof the citizens of a wealthy town such as Coimbra was a very great\r\none--far more bitter than that imposed on the peasantry, who were\r\ntold at the same moment to evacuate their flimsy cottages. It was\r\nbitterly resented, and, despite of the proclamation, four-fifths\r\nof the 40,000 inhabitants of Coimbra were still in their houses\r\nwhen, on the night of the 28th-29th, arrived Wellington’s dispatch\r\nstating that he was abandoning Bussaco, that the French would be in\r\nthe city by the 30th or on the 1st of October, and that force would\r\nbe used, if necessary, to expel people who still clung to their\r\ndwellings. During the next two days the whole of the population of\r\nCoimbra was streaming out of the place by the roads to the south, or\r\ndropping down the Mondego in boats, to ship themselves for Lisbon\r\nat the little port of Figueira. Even on the 1st of October, the day\r\nwhen the French were reputed to be facing Fornos, only eight miles\r\naway, all had not yet departed. Many of the poor, the infirm, and\r\nthe reckless remained behind to the last possible moment, and only\r\nstarted when the distant cannonade on the northern side showed that\r\nthe British outposts were being driven in. Twenty miles of road were\r\ncovered by the dense column of fugitives, headed by those who had\r\nstarted on the 29th and brought up behind by those who had waited\r\ntill the last moment. There was a great want of wheeled conveyances:\r\nthe richer folks had gone off with most of them, and others had been\r\nrequisitioned for the allied wounded. Hence, many could take off\r\nnothing but what they could carry on their persons. An eye-witness\r\nwrites that he saw the whole _chaussée_ covered with respectable\r\nfamilies walking on foot with bundles on their heads, while in the\r\nabandoned houses he noticed food of all sorts, table-linen, shirts,\r\nand all manner of other property, which was left behind in disorder\r\nbecause it was too heavy to be carried[451]. Another tells how ‘the\r\nold and the infirm, no less than the young and robust, carrying with\r\nthem all their more valuable effects, covered the fields as well\r\nas the road in every direction, and from time to time the weary\r\nfugitives, unable to carry further the heavier articles that they\r\nhad endeavoured to save, dropped them by the wayside and struggled\r\nonward, bereft of the remnant of their little property[452].’\r\nFortunately the weather for the first eight days after the evacuation\r\nof Coimbra was warm and dry, so that the unhappy multitude had almost\r\nreached Lisbon before they began to suffer any inconvenience from the\r\nOctober rains.\r\n\r\n  [451] Tomkinson, p. 47.\r\n\r\n  [452] Lord Londonderry, ii. p. 12.\r\n\r\nWhile this exodus was going on, Craufurd’s Light Division stood\r\nunder arms on the northern side of the city, while the six regiments\r\nof British horse, in the extreme rearguard, were bickering with\r\nMasséna’s squadrons in the plain toward Fornos. On this day the\r\nMarshal had strengthened his van with almost the whole of his\r\ncavalry, having added to Sainte-Croix’s division, which had hitherto\r\nformed the advance, most of Montbrun’s reserve of dragoons, and\r\nLamotte’s light brigade from the 6th Corps. This body of thirty-four\r\nsquadrons was altogether too strong for Stapleton Cotton’s three\r\nbrigades, who had to give way whenever they were seriously pressed.\r\nTwo miles outside Coimbra the British horse was divided into two\r\ncolumns: De Grey’s heavy dragoons crossed the Mondego at a ford\r\nopposite Pereira, Slade and Anson’s light dragoons and hussars by\r\nanother at Alciada, nearer to the city. At the same moment the Light\r\nDivision, when the enemy’s horse came in sight, retired through\r\nCoimbra, crossed the bridge, and pressed up the ascent towards\r\nCondeixa, thrusting before them the rearguard of belated fugitives\r\nwho had only made up their minds to depart at the last possible\r\nmoment. It is said that the block in front of them was so great that\r\nCraufurd’s regiments would have been in a situation of some danger,\r\nif they had been closely followed by French infantry, and forced to\r\nturn back to defend themselves. But nothing more than a troop of\r\ndragoons watched their passage of the bridge and their retreat to\r\nCondeixa, and not a shot had to be fired.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise with the cavalry column composed of Slade’s and\r\nAnson’s brigades: they were closely followed by the bulk of the\r\nFrench cavalry, and had to turn at the ford to hold back their eager\r\npursuers. Two squadrons of the German Hussars and one of the 16th\r\nLight Dragoons charged in succession to check the French vanguard,\r\nwhile a fire was kept up by a line of dismounted skirmishers all\r\nalong the river bank. The hussars lost four men killed, and two\r\nofficers and thirteen men wounded, besides six prisoners; the\r\n16th, two wounded and one missing in this skirmish. It could have\r\nbeen avoided, according to critics on the spot, if the brigade had\r\nretreated a little faster in the previous stage of its movement. But\r\nStapleton Cotton, forgetting the dangers of crossing such a defile\r\nas a narrow ford, had been rather too leisurely in covering the\r\nlast three miles, considering that the French were so close behind\r\nhim[453]. The enemy’s loss was insignificant[454].\r\n\r\n  [453] See Beamish’s _History of the King’s German Legion_, i.\r\n  293-4, and Tomkinson, p. 46.\r\n\r\n  [454] De Grey’s brigade, though it had no regular fighting, lost\r\n  five prisoners and one trooper wounded in this same retreat. The\r\n  total loss of the cavalry that day was thirty-four men.\r\n\r\nThat night the British rearguard lay at Soure and Condeixa, while\r\nhead quarters and the rear of the main army were at Redinha. The\r\nFrench did not cross the Mondego with more than a few cavalry\r\npatrols, and made no attempt to incommode the retreating column.\r\nIndeed they were otherwise employed. The entry of an army into a\r\ndeserted town is always accompanied by disorders: that of the army of\r\nMasséna into Coimbra was an exaggerated example of the rule--and for\r\ngood reasons. The men had been living on bare rations for a month,\r\nand suddenly they found themselves in a town of 40,000 souls, where\r\nevery door was open, every larder garnished, and every cellar full.\r\nThe very quays were littered with sacks of flour torn open, and\r\npuncheons of rum stove in, for Wellington’s commissariat officers\r\nhad been to the last moment engaged in breaking up and casting into\r\nthe river the remains of the magazine which had been feeding the\r\narmy at Bussaco. The houses on every side were full of valuable\r\ngoods, for most of the inhabitants had only been able to carry off\r\ntheir money and plate, and had left all else behind them. The first\r\ndivision of the 8th Corps, the earliest French troops to enter the\r\nplace, consisted almost entirely of newly-formed fourth battalions,\r\ncomposed of conscripts, and ill disciplined. They broke their ranks\r\nand fell to plunder, only half-restrained by their officers, many\r\nof whom joined in the sport. A late comer from the artillery says\r\nthat he saw one officer breaking open a door with a pickaxe, and\r\nanother placing a sentry at the door of a shop which he wished to\r\nreserve for his own personal pillage[455]. There was wide-spread\r\ndrunkenness, some arson, and an enormous amount of mischievous and\r\nwanton waste. It was afterwards said that Junot’s corps destroyed in\r\ntwelve hours an amount of food that would have sufficed to supply the\r\nwhole army for three weeks. It is at any rate certain that Coimbra\r\nwas full of provisions when the French arrived, and that, when order\r\nwas tardily restored, only a few days’ consumption could be scraped\r\ntogether to fill the empty waggons before the host marched on.\r\nMasséna raged against Junot for not having kept his men in hand, yet,\r\nif Portuguese narratives are to be trusted, he set as bad an example\r\nas any disorderly conscript, since he requisitioned for himself out\r\nof the University buildings all the telescopes and mathematical\r\ninstruments, and distributed them among his staff[456]. The pillage\r\nwas as wanton and objectless as it was thorough; the tombs of the\r\nkings in the church of Santa Cruz were broken open, the University\r\nMuseum and laboratories wrecked, and all the churches wantonly\r\ndamaged and desecrated. There was no attempt to restore order, or to\r\nutilize the captured property for the general good of the army, till\r\nthe 6th Corps marched in on the next day. Even these later comers,\r\nhowever, could not be restrained from joining in the plunder. The mob\r\nof soldiers threatened to shoot the commissary-generals Lambert and\r\nLaneuville, when they began to put guards over the nearly-emptied\r\nstorehouses.\r\n\r\n  [455] Colonel Noël’s _Souvenirs Militaires_, pp. 120-1.\r\n\r\n  [456] The authority for this statement is the Portuguese renegade\r\n  General Pamplona, who served on the Marshal’s staff. See p. 155\r\n  of his _Aperçu sur les campagnes des Français en Portugal_.\r\n  Pamplona adds that Ney refused to take the present of a large\r\n  telescope, which Masséna sent him as a propitiatory gift. A less\r\n  certain authority says that the Marshal caught in the street a\r\n  plunderer with a barrel of butter, and another with a chest of\r\n  wax candles, and let them off punishment on condition that they\r\n  took them to his own quarters! Soriano da Luz, iii. p. 198.\r\n\r\nThe state of his army on the 1st and 2nd October sufficiently\r\nexplains the conduct of Masséna in refraining from the pursuit of\r\nWellington’s rearguard. But he was also somewhat puzzled to determine\r\nthe policy which he must now adopt. Down to the last moment he\r\nhad thought that Wellington would have fought at Fornos, or some\r\nother such position, to defend Coimbra. And even when Coimbra was\r\nevacuated, he had imagined that he might find the enemy drawn up\r\nto dispute the passage of the Mondego. But it was now clear that\r\nWellington was in full retreat for Lisbon. Since the Marshal was\r\nstill ignorant of the existence of the lines of Torres Vedras, which\r\nwas only revealed to him four days later, he was somewhat uncertain\r\nhow to interpret the conduct of his adversary. After the vigorous\r\nstand that Wellington had made at Bussaco, it seemed dangerous to\r\nargue that he must now be in headlong flight for his ships, and\r\nabout to evacuate Portugal. Yet the rapidity of his retreat seemed\r\nto argue some such purpose. Ought he, therefore, to be pursued\r\nwithout a moment’s delay, in order that his embarkation might be\r\nmade difficult? This course, it is said, was advocated by Reynier,\r\nMontbrun, Fririon, and the Portuguese renegade d’Alorna. On the other\r\nhand, Ney and Junot both advised a stay at Coimbra, to rest the army,\r\ncollect provisions, and, what was most important of all, to reopen\r\ncommunications with Almeida, Ciudad Rodrigo, and the 9th Corps, which\r\nwas now due on the Spanish frontier. They pointed to the diminished\r\nstrength of the army, which, having lost 4,600 men at Bussaco, and\r\n4,000 more by the hard marching and poor feeding of the last month,\r\nwas now reduced to some 57,000 men. The fighting-power of Wellington\r\nwas formidable, as he had shown at Bussaco, where many of the French\r\nofficers persisted in believing that he had shown numbers superior\r\nto their own--in which they erred. A hasty advance, it was urged,\r\nmight bring the invaders in face of a second Bussaco, where there\r\nwas no chance of a turning movement. Would the commander-in-chief\r\nwish to accept another battle of the same sort? It would be better to\r\nestablish a new base at Coimbra, to bring up the 9th Corps from the\r\nrear, and only to move on when the army was thoroughly reorganized.\r\nMeanwhile a detachment might demonstrate against Oporto, to distract\r\nWellington’s attention[457]. This was the policy that Napoleon,\r\ntwo months after, declared that Masséna should have adopted. ‘Why,’\r\nhe asked, ‘did the Prince of Essling, after his failure at Bussaco,\r\npursue the march on Lisbon, instead of taking up a position on the\r\nMondego, and restoring his communications with Almeida? I had not\r\nburdened him with orders or instructions, and he could see that the\r\nEnglish were not easy to beat.’ Masséna’s advocate, Foy, replied that\r\n‘if the Army of Portugal had been halted on the Mondego, your Majesty\r\nwould have said to the Prince, Why did you not march on? The English\r\nwould have re-embarked, if they had been pressed.’ To which Napoleon,\r\nwith a broad smile, answered, ‘Very true; I probably should have said\r\nso[458].’\r\n\r\n  [457] Fririon, in his account of these debates (pp. 72-3),\r\n  forgets that the existence of the Lines of Torres Vedras was\r\n  still unknown both to Masséna and his subordinates. So does\r\n  Delagrave (pp. 93-4). But Pelet, Masséna’s confidant, is positive\r\n  that they were first heard of from prisoners taken at Pombal on\r\n  Oct. 5, two days after the advance had recommenced.\r\n\r\n  [458] Foy’s minutes of his conversation with the Emperor on Nov.\r\n  22, sent by him to Masséna, in his letter of Dec. 4. See Appendix\r\n  to Foy’s _Vie Militaire_ by Girod de L’Ain, p. 348.\r\n\r\nThe problem presented to the Marshal, indeed, was not an easy one. If\r\nhe remained at Coimbra, his enemies would delate him to the Emperor\r\nfor timidity; if he advanced, he might find that he had undertaken a\r\ntask too great for his strength. The personal equation settled the\r\ndifficulty: Masséna was obstinate and enterprising to the verge of\r\ntemerity. He resolved to go on, at the earliest possible moment, in\r\nthe hope of forcing Wellington to a battle on ground less favourable\r\nthan Bussaco, or of compelling him to embark without any general\r\nengagement at all. Two days only were spent at Coimbra. On October 3,\r\nMontbrun’s cavalry, after making a reconnaissance as far as the sea\r\nand the port of Figueira, crossed the Mondego to Villa Nova de Ancos,\r\nwhile the 8th Corps, headed by Sainte-Croix’s dragoons, occupied\r\nCondeixa: one division of Ney’s corps followed them. The rest of the\r\n6th Corps and Reynier made ready to resume their advance.\r\n\r\nA minor problem remained to be resolved. Should a large garrison\r\nbe left in Coimbra, and a new base for the army established there?\r\nThe Marshal had shot into the convent of Santa Clara 3,000 Bussaco\r\nwounded, and 1,000 sick men. There was an accumulation of waggons of\r\nthe corps-trains and the Grand Park, which could push on no further,\r\nfor want of draught beasts, and all manner of other impedimenta.\r\nIf the army went on at full speed, in the hope of overtaking the\r\nEnglish, all this must be left behind. But if left unguarded, wounded\r\nand all might become the victims of Trant’s militia, which was known\r\nto have retired no further than the Vouga, or even of the Ordenança\r\nof the hills. A strong garrison must be placed in Coimbra to make it\r\nsafe: rumour had it on October 2 that Taupin’s brigade and a regiment\r\nof dragoons were to be set to guard the city[459]. But rumour was\r\nwrong: Masséna, after some doubting, made up his mind that he could\r\nnot spare even 3,000 men. Every bayonet would be wanted if Wellington\r\nonce more turned to bay. Accordingly he took the extraordinary\r\nstep of telling off only a single company, 156 men, of the 44th\r\n_Équipage de la Marine_--a naval unit which had been given him in\r\norder that he might have a nucleus of sea-going people, in case he\r\nsucceeded in seizing the Portuguese arsenal at Lisbon. One would\r\nhave thought that such men would have been so valuable, if only the\r\nenterprise had succeeded, that he would have chosen rather a company\r\nof ordinary infantry. These sailors, with two or three hundred\r\nfootsore or convalescent men, organized into a couple of provisional\r\ncompanies, were all that the Marshal placed at the disposition of\r\nMajor Flandrin, to whom he gave the high-sounding title of Governor\r\nof Coimbra. That officer was told that every day would increase\r\nhis force, as more convalescents came out of hospital, and 3,500\r\nmuskets, belonging to the sick and wounded, were left with him. The\r\nwhole mass of disabled men was concentrated in the convent of Santa\r\nClara, a vast building outside the trans-pontine suburb of Coimbra,\r\non the south side of the Mondego. The garrison was so weak that it\r\ncould do no more than keep a guard at each of the exits of the town,\r\nwhich was destitute of walls, with a post of thirty men, all that\r\ncould be spared, at Fornos, on the great north road facing Oporto.\r\nTo abandon his wounded to almost certain destruction was a reckless\r\nact on the Marshal’s part: probably he said to himself that if he\r\ncould but catch and beat the Anglo-Portuguese army, a small disaster\r\nin his rear would be forgiven him. Unlike Wellington, he was ‘taking\r\nrisks’[460].\r\n\r\n  [459] So Guingret, of the 6th Corps, who mentions that his\r\n  own regiment received notice that no garrison was to be left,\r\n  only just in time to enable it to pick up its slightly wounded\r\n  and footsore men, who would otherwise have remained behind.\r\n  (_Memoirs_, p. 79.)\r\n\r\n  [460] The best summing up of the Marshal’s resolve may be found\r\n  in Foy’s minute presented to Napoleon on Nov. 22: ‘Le prince n’a\r\n  pas pu se résoudre à faire un fort détachement lorsqu’il devait\r\n  livrer sous peu de jours une bataille décisive à une armée déjà\r\n  victorieuse et deux fois plus nombreuse[!] que la notre. Les\r\n  dangers que couraient ses malades ont affligé son cœur, mais il a\r\n  pensé que la crainte de perdre l’hôpital ne devait pas arrêter la\r\n  campagne.’ (Foy’s _Vie Militaire_, Appendix, p. 348.)\r\n\r\nOn October 4 the French army made its regular start from Coimbra;\r\nthe 6th Corps came out to Villa Pouca and Condeixa on the Pombal\r\nroad, the 2nd Corps to Venda do Cego on the Ancião road, which runs\r\nparallel with the other, ten miles to the east, and joins it at\r\nLeiria. Montbrun’s cavalry pushed in from Soure, to place itself in\r\nfront of the 8th Corps, which now moved on from Condeixa as the head\r\nof the main infantry column. Its scouts that evening bickered in\r\nfront of Pombal with Anson’s light cavalry, which was covering the\r\nretreat of the allied army. The two days which the French had spent\r\nin plundering Coimbra had allowed the Anglo-Portuguese infantry to\r\nget a start which they never lost: they never saw the enemy again\r\nduring the rest of the retreat. That night Wellington’s head quarters\r\nwere at Leiria, while Hill, unpursued by any hostile force, was at\r\nThomar. For the next six days the British pursued a leisurely course\r\ntowards the Lines, along the three roads Thomar-Santarem-Villafranca,\r\nwhich was taken by Hill; Alcobaça-Caldas-Torres Vedras, which was\r\ntaken by Picton; and Leiria-Batalha-Alemquer, which was taken\r\nby Spencer, Leith, and Cole. It was along the last-named, the\r\ncentral, road, that Craufurd’s infantry and the three cavalry\r\nbrigades followed the main body, at the distance of a day’s march.\r\nAnson’s light cavalry brought up the extreme rear, and was almost\r\nthe only unit which saw the enemy between the 4th and the 10th of\r\nOctober[461]. The rest of the allied army had completely outmarched\r\nMasséna. Its retreat was marked by some disorders: the sight of rich\r\nmonasteries like Alcobaça and Batalha, and large towns, like Thomar\r\nand Leiria, standing empty, yet left full of all such property as\r\nthe inmates could not easily carry off, proved as tempting to the\r\nBritish as the sight of Coimbra had been to the French. There was\r\nmuch drunkenness, much looting, and some wanton mischief. Wellington\r\nset himself to repress it by the strong hand. He hung at Leiria\r\ntwo troopers of the 4th Dragoon Guards, who were caught plundering\r\na chapel, and a man of the 11th Portuguese infantry. Some of the\r\nregiments which were found specially addicted to pillage were ordered\r\nto bivouac in the open fields every night, and never to be quartered\r\nin a village[462].\r\n\r\n  [461] Though Slade’s brigade had the rearguard on the 7th, and\r\n  was engaged on the 8th also, Anson’s only was in touch with the\r\n  French on the 4th-6th, and again on the 9th-10th.\r\n\r\n  [462] This was the case with Picton’s division, despite its\r\n  splendid services and heavy loss at Bussaco, only ten days back.\r\n  Leith’s British brigade and the Lusitanian Legion are also\r\n  specially upbraided for straggling. See _General Orders_ for\r\n  1810, pp. 173-4.\r\n\r\nAnson’s brigade, alone among the allied troops, had an adventurous\r\ncareer during the retreat to the Lines. It was always in touch with\r\na pursuing force of immense strength, for Masséna had constituted a\r\nflying vanguard under Montbrun, whose orders were to push the enemy\r\nat all costs, and to try to come up with his infantry. This force\r\nconsisted of Sainte-Croix’s dragoons, Pierre Soult’s cavalry from\r\nthe 2nd Corps, Lamotte’s from the 6th Corps, one brigade (Ornano’s)\r\nof the Reserve Cavalry, and Taupin’s infantry from the 8th Corps.\r\nLamotte’s light horse had the place of honour, and endured most of\r\nthe hard knocks. They had lively skirmishing with Anson’s 1st German\r\nHussars and 16th Light Dragoons between Pombal and Leiria on the\r\n5th October. The British brigade turned back twice, and drove their\r\npursuers back on to Taupin’s infantry, but always suffered when it\r\nhad to resume its inevitable retreat. The French lost eight killed,\r\nseventeen wounded (including five officers) and twenty prisoners--the\r\nBritish fifty in all, including two officers wounded, and one taken.\r\nThis combat would not have been worth mentioning, but for the fact\r\nthat it was from prisoners captured in it that Masséna got his first\r\nnews of the existence of the Lines of Torres Vedras. Some of the\r\ntroopers spoke freely of ‘the Lines’ as their point of destination,\r\nnot guessing that this was the first time that their captors had\r\nheard of them. Hence the French generals learned that there were\r\nnow fortifications in front of Lisbon: but they had, of course, no\r\nknowledge of their extent or character, and only expected to find\r\nsome field-works on which Wellington would turn to bay. In fact,\r\nMasséna was encouraged by the news, thinking that he was now certain\r\nof the battle which he desired.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th October the French infantry was all concentrated at\r\nLeiria, Reynier’s corps having now rejoined the other two. Montbrun’s\r\ncavalry spread out so far as Alcobaça--whose monastery it sacked--on\r\nthe coast-road, and Muliano on the central road. Vedettes were sent\r\nout on the cross-road to Thomar also, but could find no trace of an\r\nenemy in that direction. On the night that followed Masséna received\r\nthe disquieting intelligence that his deliberate taking of risks with\r\nregard to Coimbra had already been punished. A mounted officer, who\r\nhad escaped, brought him news that his hospitals and their guard had\r\nbeen captured at a single blow by Trant’s militia that same afternoon.\r\n\r\nThat enterprising partisan, it will be remembered, had been driven\r\nbehind the Vouga by Sainte-Croix’s dragoons on September 30th. Since,\r\nhowever, none of the French turned aside to molest him, and all\r\nmarched across his front on the Coimbra road, he was not forced to\r\nretire any further. And having his orders from Wellington to follow\r\nthe enemy with caution, and pick up his stragglers and marauders, he\r\ncame southward again when Masséna’s rearguard entered Coimbra. He\r\nhad advanced to Mealhada when it was reported to him, on the 6th,\r\nthat the rearguard of the French had left the city on the preceding\r\nday. A few people who had returned from the mountains to their homes,\r\ndespite Wellington’s proclamation, sent him assurances that the\r\nnumbers of the garrison were absolutely insignificant, and that of\r\nthe wounded enormous. Judging rightly that it would have a splendid\r\nmoral effect to capture Masséna’s hospitals, and the commencement of\r\na base-magazine which was being formed at Coimbra, Trant resolved to\r\nstrike at once. If he had waited a little he could have got help from\r\nJ. Wilson and from Miller, who had descended into the Celorico-Vizeu\r\ncountry, each with his brigade. They had been directed by Wellington\r\nto cut the French communications with Almeida, and had already\r\ncarried out their orders.\r\n\r\nBut Trant dreaded delay, thinking that Masséna might send back troops\r\nto Coimbra, when he found that Wellington was retiring as far as\r\nLisbon. Without waiting for his colleagues, he marched at midday from\r\nMealhada to Fornos on the 7th, and had the good fortune to surprise\r\nand capture the insignificant French post at that village: not a man\r\nescaped. He was now only eight miles from Coimbra, and was able to\r\nrush down into the city in the early afternoon before his arrival\r\nwas known. He had with him one weak squadron of regular dragoons,\r\nand six militia battalions, having been joined since September 29th\r\nby all his stragglers and some outlying units. The whole made about\r\n4,000 men[463]. Formed in two columns, they charged into Coimbra by\r\nits two northern entrances, sweeping away the small French guards at\r\nthe gates. The squadron of cavalry then galloped along the street\r\nparallel with the river, and seized the bridge, thus cutting off the\r\ncommunication between the French in the town and those at the convent\r\nof Santa Clara, where the wounded lay. The small grand-guard, which\r\nthe enemy kept inside the place, took refuge in the bishop’s palace,\r\nbut was forced to lay down its arms at the end of an hour. The men\r\nat the convent, joined by many of the convalescents, kept up a fire\r\nfor a short time, but surrendered at discretion, on Trant’s promise\r\nto protect them from the fury of his troops. He was, unfortunately,\r\nnot entirely able to redeem his promise: the Coimbra local regiment\r\nwas so enraged at the state in which it found its native town that\r\nit mishandled some of the prisoners--eight are said to have been\r\nslain[464]. The total loss of the Portuguese division was three\r\nkilled and one officer and twenty-five men wounded.\r\n\r\n  [463] The brigade was not complete, the Feira battalion\r\n  having--somehow or other--got to Lisbon. But Porto, Penafiel,\r\n  Coimbra, Aveiro, Maia, and a combined battalion of light\r\n  companies were apparently present.\r\n\r\n  [464] See Trant’s dispatch to Beresford in Soriano da Luz, vii,\r\n  Appendix, p. 221.\r\n\r\nWilson and Miller came up next day, and sweeping the roads towards\r\nCondeixa and Pombal, picked up 300 more stragglers and marauders from\r\nthe tail of Masséna’s marching column. Trant handed over Coimbra to\r\nthem, and escorted his prisoners to Oporto with his own division:\r\nthere were 3,507 sick and wounded, of whom half could march, while\r\nthe rest were taken off in carts. Of able-bodied men not more than\r\n400 soldiers were taken: but some hundreds of commissariat and\r\nhospital employés and men of the train brought up the total figures\r\nof the prisoners to 4,500 men. Trant has been accused by some French\r\nwriters[465] of deliberately exposing his captives to the fury of the\r\npeasantry, and parading the wounded in an indecent fashion through\r\nthe streets of Oporto. But the handsome testimonial to his humanity\r\nsigned by a committee of French officers, which Napier prints in the\r\nAppendix no. 5 to his third volume, is enough to prove that Trant\r\ndid his best for his prisoners, and that the unfortunate incident\r\nwhich occurred just after the surrender must not be laid to his\r\naccount[466].\r\n\r\n  [465] As for example Delagrave, p. 197, and Fririon, p. 75.\r\n\r\n  [466] Trant delivered nearly 400 British and Portuguese wounded,\r\n  whom Wellington had been obliged to leave behind at Coimbra, as\r\n  non-transportable.\r\n\r\nMasséna’s army received the news of the fall of Coimbra with\r\nindignation. It produced a painful impression on every mind; and\r\nwhile the rank and file murmured at the Marshal’s cruelty in\r\nabandoning their comrades to death--for it was falsely reported that\r\nthe Portuguese had massacred them all--the officers blamed his blind\r\nimprovidence, and observed that a brigade might well have been spared\r\nto protect not only the hospitals but the invaluable base-dépôt\r\nbehind them[467].\r\n\r\n  [467] Sprünglin writes, under Oct. 7, in his Diary: ‘Lorsque le\r\n  sort des malheureux abandonnés à Coimbre fut connu dans l’armée,\r\n  on murmura hautement contre le Prince d’Essling. On qualifia\r\n  de coupable entêtement et de barbarie sa conduite à Busaco et\r\n  l’abandon des blessés à Coimbre. Il faut avouer que le maréchal\r\n  Ney, le général Reynier et le duc d’Abrantes ne firent rien pour\r\n  faire cesser ces murmures. Dès lors l’armée perdit de sa force,\r\n  parce que le général-en-chef n’avait plus la confiance de ses\r\n  soldats.’ Cf. Guingret, p. 79.\r\n\r\nThere was heavy skirmishing between the British rearguard cavalry and\r\nMontbrun’s advance, both on the 8th and 9th of October. On the first\r\nof these days the horse-artillery troop attached to Anson’s brigade\r\nwas, by some extraordinary mistake, left encamped out in front of\r\nthe squadrons which were told off as its escort, and was nearly\r\nsurprised in Alcoentre by an irruption of Sainte-Croix’s dragoons\r\nin a storm of rain[468]. Somers Cocks’s squadron of the 16th Light\r\nDragoons charged just in time to save the guns, and to jam the head\r\nof the enemy’s column, as it was crossing the bridge which leads into\r\nthe village. Alcoentre was held till dusk, when Taupin’s infantry\r\ncame up, and Anson’s brigade retired, having lost only one trooper\r\nwounded, while the French had sixteen disabled or taken.\r\n\r\n  [468] ‘Rather a new style of war, to place guns in a village and\r\n  the troops protecting them a mile in the rear.’--Tomkinson, p. 51.\r\n\r\nFrom this day onward, the weather, which had been fine and dry since\r\nthe army left Coimbra, broke up for the autumn rains, and the last\r\nthree days of the retreat to the Lines were spent in torrential\r\ndownpour. This had the advantage of delaying the French; for while\r\nthe British infantry, who were two days ahead of them, reached\r\ntheir destined position on the 9th (with the exception of the Light\r\nDivision and Pack’s Portuguese), the enemy was marching on flooded\r\nroads from the 8th to the 11th.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th there was continual bickering in the rain, from Quinta da\r\nTorre as far as Alemquer, between Lamotte’s light cavalry brigade,\r\nwhich had again replaced Sainte-Croix’s dragoons at the head of the\r\npursuing column, and Anson’s two much-enduring regiments. On this\r\nday the 1st Hussars of the King’s German Legion had the thick of the\r\nwork: Linsingen’s squadron of that admirable regiment, which formed\r\nthe rear detachment of the whole army, turned back to charge no less\r\nthan four times in five miles, and always with success. At dusk the\r\nFrench infantry got up, and the allied cavalry retired on to Alemquer\r\nafter a fatiguing day of fighting, in which the hussars had lost two\r\nkilled, two officers and nine men wounded, and seventeen missing; the\r\nsupporting regiment, the 16th Light Dragoons, had one killed, three\r\nwounded, and four missing, and the Royals of Slade’s brigade, who\r\nonly got engaged in the late evening, one wounded and four missing.\r\nLamotte’s loss was a little more--six killed, twenty-two wounded, and\r\ntwenty-one prisoners[469]. Three of his officers were hurt, one taken.\r\n\r\n  [469] Readers interested in cavalry work should read Beamish, i.\r\n  298-301, and Tomkinson, 52-3, who have admirable accounts of this\r\n  rearguard fighting.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (Oct. 10) the whole of the British cavalry marched\r\nfrom Alemquer to within the Lines, distributing themselves to the\r\ncantonments which had been arranged for them. But Craufurd’s and\r\nPack’s infantry, which had hitherto been completely covered by\r\nthe horsemen, did not follow their example with quite sufficient\r\npromptitude, and got engaged in an unnecessary skirmish. The Light\r\nDivision should have withdrawn at noon, but Craufurd, believing the\r\nFrench infantry to be still far away, and despising the cavalry\r\nwhich hovered around him, remained in Alemquer, intending to spend\r\nanother night in a dry cantonment, for the torrential rain which\r\nwas falling promised a fatiguing march to his men. At four o’clock\r\nTaupin’s infantry came up, and engaged the pickets of the Light\r\nDivision in a skirmish. Having been strictly forbidden by Wellington\r\nto get entangled in a rearguard action, and remembering perhaps\r\nhis experience at the Coa, Craufurd tardily and unwillingly moved\r\noff. But dusk coming on, his column missed its road, and instead\r\nof retiring into the section of the Lines which it was destined\r\nto occupy, between the Monte Agraça and the valley of Calandriz,\r\nwent too far to the west, and came in upon the position of the 1st\r\nDivision in front of Sobral. This would have been dangerous if the\r\nFrench had had any infantry to the front, to take advantage of the\r\nunoccupied gap in the lines. But Montbrun’s advanced guard had\r\npressed more than thirty miles in front of the main body of Masséna’s\r\narmy, and this force contained nothing but cavalry, save the single\r\nbrigade of Taupin--less than 3,000 men[470]. This force, such as it\r\nwas, did not pass Alemquer that night--Craufurd, in his retreat on\r\nSobral, was followed by cavalry alone. It was not till next morning,\r\nwhen Montbrun sent out reconnaissances in all directions, that he\r\nfound himself in front of fortifications drawn across every road,\r\nand gradually realized that he was in front of the famous ‘Lines of\r\nTorres Vedras.’\r\n\r\n  [470] For this reason the dismal picture of the situation drawn\r\n  by Napier (iii. 38-9) must be considered exaggerated. The French\r\n  main army was further off than he imagines; it had not passed\r\n  Alcoentre. The cavalry could have done nothing against the\r\n  heights, and Taupin’s brigade would have been crushed if it had\r\n  endeavoured to enter the gap. But it never came within ten miles\r\n  of the exposed point on the 10th and 11th, not having passed\r\n  Alemquer. The Light Division diarists do not treat seriously the\r\n  position which Napier paints in such gloomy colours. See Leach,\r\n  p. 172, and Simmons, p. 111. The Light Division countermarched\r\n  from Sobral to Arruda and reached their proper post long before\r\n  midnight. There they picked up a detachment of 150 convalescents\r\n  and recruits from Lisbon, who, had been waiting for them. Among\r\n  these were Harry Smith and Simmons, who have accounts of the\r\n  arrival of the division ‘after dark,’ and of its relief at\r\n  finding large fires already lighted and provisions prepared by\r\n  the draft.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Wellington’s final arrangements for\r\nthe reception of the army of Masséna in front of Lisbon were made\r\nat leisure, or at a moment when he had nothing to distract him.\r\nThough the actual retreat of his army from the position of Bussaco\r\nto the position of Torres Vedras was conducted at an easy pace,\r\nand practically unmolested by the enemy, yet the days during which\r\nit was being carried out were a time of political, though not of\r\nmilitary, storm and stress. Ever since the French had started from\r\nAlmeida, and made their first advance into the mountains of Beira,\r\nWellington had been engaged in an endless and tiresome controversy\r\nwith the Portuguese Regency. Though they had assented, long before,\r\nto the scheme for devastating the country-side and bringing Masséna\r\nto a check only in front of Lisbon, yet when the actual invasion\r\nbegan, and the first hordes of fugitives were reported to be leaving\r\ntheir homes, and burning their crops, and taking to the mountains,\r\nseveral of the members of the Regency became appalled at the awful\r\nsacrifices which they were calling upon the nation to endure. The\r\nPrincipal Sousa put himself at the head of the movement, and was\r\nsupported by the Patriarch, the Bishop of Oporto, so famous in 1808.\r\nSousa brought before the Regency proposals that Wellington should\r\nbe formally requested to try the chances of a pitched battle on\r\nthe frontier, before retiring on Coimbra or Lisbon. In addition,\r\nhe was always maintaining in private company that the people\r\nshould not be required to take in hand the scheme of devastation\r\nand wholesale emigration, till it was certain the allied army was\r\nunable to stop Masséna somewhere east of the Serra da Estrella.\r\nHe also laid before the Regency documents intended to prove that\r\nthe system of devastation was physically impossible, and that it\r\nwould prove incapable of stopping the advance of the French, owing\r\nto the difficulty that would be found in persuading the peasantry\r\nto destroy instead of hiding their stores of food[471]. There was\r\na certain modicum of truth in this last argument, and the French\r\ndid succeed in living for a longer time in the evacuated districts\r\nthan Wellington had considered possible. On the other hand, the\r\nPrincipal was hopelessly wrong in his contention that the French\r\nwould suffer little inconvenience. They were starved out of Portugal\r\nby Wellington’s device, even though it took longer to work out\r\nits results than he had calculated. There is no reason to suppose\r\nthat Sousa was in any way treacherously inclined: he and his whole\r\nfamily stood or fell with the English alliance, and the victory\r\nof the French would mean ruin to them. But his private and public\r\nutterances and those of his satellites had a deplorable effect. In\r\nthe mouth of the common people it took the form of a widely-spread\r\nrumour that Wellington had refused to fight at all, and intended to\r\nre-embark the British army. This did not lead to any wish to submit\r\nto Napoleon, but to a desperate determination to resist even if\r\ndeserted. Wellington’s dispatches are full of a riot which took place\r\nin Lisbon on September 7th, when the militia proposed to seize on St.\r\nJulian’s, the Citadel, and the Bugio fort because they were informed\r\nthat the English garrisons were about to evacuate them and put to\r\nsea[472]. When Masséna had already passed Coimbra, Sousa was mad\r\nenough to propose, at the Regency board, that the Portuguese troops\r\nshould not retire within the Lines, but remain outside and offer\r\nbattle in the open, even if the British refused to stand by them. The\r\nnervous activity of the government had been shown some three weeks\r\nbefore by the sudden arrest and deportation of some fifty persons in\r\nLisbon, who were suspected, rightly or wrongly, of ‘Jacobinism,’ and\r\nhad been accused of having secret communication with d’Alorna and\r\nthe other renegades in Masséna’s army. They included a few officers,\r\nand a good many lawyers, doctors, merchants, and minor officials,\r\nas well as some dependants and relatives of the exiles. The case\r\nagainst most of them was so weak that Wellington protested against\r\ntheir banishment, holding that the alarm caused by the arrests would\r\nmake the people of Lisbon unreasonably suspicious, and give rise to\r\na belief in wide-spread plots. But despite his letter to the Regency\r\nall were shipped off to the Azores[473]. Some were ultimately allowed\r\nto go to England, others to Brazil, but the majority were not allowed\r\nto return to Portugal till 1816.\r\n\r\n  [471] For Sousa’s arguments, see Soriano da Luz, iii. pp. 130-44.\r\n  That author thinks the Principal’s arguments weighty, and sees no\r\n  harm in the fact that he set them forth in public and private.\r\n  Cf. Wellington, _Dispatches_, vi. 430.\r\n\r\n  [472] See Wellington to Charles Stuart, Sept. 9, and to Lord\r\n  Liverpool, Sept. 13, 1810, _Dispatches_, vol. vi. pp. 420-30.\r\n\r\n  [473] See Soriano da Luz, iii. 90-9, for a list of them, and\r\n  Wellington’s _Dispatches_, vi. 433, for the protest against the\r\n  deportation; also ibid. 528-9.\r\n\r\n‘All I ask from the Government,’ wrote Wellington, on October 6th, in\r\nthe midst of the retreat, ‘is tranquillity in the town of Lisbon, and\r\nprovisions for their own troops[474].’ These two simple requirements\r\nwere precisely those which he did not obtain. The capital of Portugal\r\nwas kept disturbed by arbitrary arrests, by proclamations which\r\noften contained false news, and sometimes pledged the Regency to\r\nmeasures which the Commander-in-Chief disapproved, and by senseless\r\nembargoes laid on vehicles and commodities, which were never turned\r\nto use[475]. At the same time the Portuguese troops were not fed, and\r\nthe tents which had been ordered forward to the positions behind the\r\nlines never started from the magazines of Lisbon[476].\r\n\r\n  [474] _Dispatches_, vi. p. 493.\r\n\r\n  [475] _Dispatches_, vi. 521. ‘When they have got mules and\r\n  carriages, by injudicious seizure, they do not employ them, but\r\n  the animals and people are kept starving and shivering, while we\r\n  still want provisions.’\r\n\r\n  [476] Ibid., vi. p. 506.\r\n\r\nWellington’s temper, tried to the uttermost by these distractions,\r\nwhen his mind was entirely engrossed by military problems, grew\r\nsharp and irritable at this time. He went so far as to write to\r\nthe Prince Regent at Rio de Janeiro, to declare that either he or\r\nPrincipal Sousa must leave the country. He suggested that some post\r\nas ambassador or special envoy should be found for the man who\r\ntroubled him so. The Patriarch, as ‘a necessary evil,’ he did not\r\nwish to displace, but only to scare. Unfortunately, an appeal to\r\nBrazil was hopeless, since the Regent was entirely in the hands of\r\nthe Principal’s brother, the Conde de Linhares. Much acrimonious\r\ncorrespondence, delayed by the vast time which was consumed in\r\ngetting letters to and from Rio, only led in the end to a proposal\r\nfrom Linhares that his brother should leave the Regency, if Charles\r\nStuart, the British Ambassador, was also withdrawn from it, and if\r\nthe War-Minister, General Miguel Forjaz, whom Wellington considered\r\na necessary person and the ablest man in Portugal, should also be\r\nremoved from his post[477]. To this proposal neither Wellington\r\nnor the British government would consent, and as it only came in\r\nwhen Masséna’s invasion had already been foiled, and the French had\r\nretired into Spain, the crisis was over. The Principal remained at\r\nthe Council Board, to talk much impracticable and mischievous stuff,\r\nbut to do little positive harm. When the invasion was past Wellington\r\ncould afford to disregard him.\r\n\r\n  [477] See Soriano da Luz, iii. p. 142. For text of it his\r\n  _Appendix_, vii. 178-9. The answer was only written on Feb. 11,\r\n  1811, and only got to Wellington in April when the crisis was\r\n  over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LINES OF TORRES VEDRAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto, when speaking of Wellington’s immense scheme for\r\nfortifying the position on which he intended to bring his enemy to a\r\nstandstill, refrained from entering into the details of his plan. It\r\nis now time to describe it in full, and to explain its design.\r\n\r\nThe character of the peninsula on which Lisbon stands lends\r\nitself sufficiently well to defence. At a first inspection the\r\ncountry-side offers a rather chaotic expanse of mountain and valley,\r\nwhose general features are hard to seize from any one point. On\r\nfurther examination, it appears that the whole square mass of land\r\nbetween the Atlantic and the Tagus estuary is nothing more than a\r\ncontinuation of the ridge of the Serra de Monte Junta, the main\r\nmountain-chain of Estremadura. But from the backbone or central mass\r\nof the highland so many large spurs are thrown out to each side, and\r\nthese are themselves so high and steep, that the whole peninsula\r\nseems more like a ganglion of mountains than a well-marked chain.\r\nThe two chief joints or vertebrae in the backbone are the Monte\r\nAgraça above Sobral, and the Cabeça de Montechique six miles south\r\nof it, and these form the central points respectively of the first\r\nand second lines of defence which were finally laid out. Besides\r\nthe outer defences there was in Wellington’s scheme, from the very\r\nstart, an inner ring of works, covering only a small area on the\r\nsea-shore, at the southernmost point of the peninsula, to the west of\r\nLisbon. This was merely intended to cover an embarkation, if by any\r\nunforeseen disaster the Lines themselves should be pierced.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak of the system of defences in detail. In October\r\n1809, Wellington’s plan had embraced no more than one continuous\r\nline of works from Alhandra on the Tagus to the mouth of the Rio\r\nSão Lourenço on the Atlantic, with certain redoubts and fortified\r\ncamps thrown out in front, at Torres Vedras, Monte Agraça, and other\r\npoints. These latter fortifications were not intended to be held in\r\npermanence; but it was hoped that they might defer and hinder the\r\nenemy’s attack on the main line in the rear. It was only the long\r\ndelay in Masséna’s advance, which gave Wellington five or six months\r\non which he had not counted, that led to the ultimate strengthening\r\nof the scattered outer works, and their conversion into a continuous\r\nwhole, capable of turning back, instead of merely detaining for a\r\ntime, the invading army. Indeed, all across the peninsula, designs\r\nthat were slight, isolated, and provisional when first drawn up, were\r\nin the end enlarged, and perfected into wholly different structures.\r\nFor the engineers, having unlimited labour at their disposal,\r\nand much more time than had been promised them, could turn their\r\nattention, after the essential works had been completed, to devising\r\nall manner of additional improvements and securities for the chosen\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Lines was entrusted to Colonel Fletcher,\r\nWellington’s commanding engineer, who had as his chief assistant\r\nMajor John Jones, the historian of the works, and in addition eleven\r\nBritish officers of the Royal Engineers, two from the King’s German\r\nLegion, and three from the Portuguese regular army. Wellington\r\nhimself, after making one all-embracing survey of-the positions in\r\nFletcher’s company in October 1809, and another in February 1810,\r\nleft all the rest to his subordinate, and refrained from worrying him\r\nwith matters of detail, being satisfied that his own intentions had\r\nbeen thoroughly well grasped. The labour available was, firstly, that\r\nof the Lisbon militia regiments, who were brought up by alternate\r\npairs, and paid an extra 4_d._ a day for their services[478];\r\nsecondly, that of hired volunteers from the peasantry of the\r\ndistrict, of whom from 5,000 to 7,000 were generally in hand; they\r\nreceived 1_s._, afterwards 1_s._ 8_d._ a day[479]; and lastly of a\r\nconscription from the whole of southern Estremadura, for a circuit\r\nof forty miles around. The forced labour was paid at the same rate\r\nas that freely hired. On the whole, only about £100,000 was paid\r\nout between November 1809 and September 1810--so that the Lines of\r\nTorres Vedras may be considered one of the cheapest investments in\r\nhistory. The militiamen and peasantry were worked in gangs of some\r\n1,000 or 1,500 men, each in charge of an engineer officer, who had\r\na few English and Portuguese military artificers as his assistants:\r\nonly 150 such were available, so short were both armies of trained\r\nmen. ‘In some districts a subaltern officer of engineers with a few\r\nEnglish soldiers, utterly ignorant of the language, directed and\r\ncontrolled the labour of 1,500 peasantry, many of them compelled\r\nto work at a distance of forty miles from their homes, while their\r\nlands lay neglected. Nevertheless, during a year of this forced\r\nlabour not a single instance of insubordination or riot occurred.\r\nThe great quantity of work performed should, in justice to the\r\nPortuguese, be ascribed more to the regular habit of persevering\r\nlabour in those employed than to the efficiency of the control\r\nexercised over them[480].... Indeed, it is but a tribute of justice\r\nto the Portuguese of Estremadura to state that, during many months of\r\nconstant personal intercourse, both private and public, the labouring\r\nclasses ever showed themselves respectful, industrious, docile, and\r\nobedient, while the governing classes in every public transaction\r\nevinced much intelligence, patriotism, good sense, and probity.\r\nSecrecy with respect to the extent and nature of the works was\r\nenjoined, and it is highly creditable to all concerned that hardly a\r\nvague paragraph concerning the Lines found its way into the public\r\nprints. The French invaders remained ignorant of the nature of the\r\nbarrier rising against them, till they found our army arrayed on it\r\nso as to stop their further advance[481].’\r\n\r\n  [478] Or two _vintems_ Portuguese money.\r\n\r\n  [479] Or six, and afterwards ten, _vintems_. See Jones, _Lines of\r\n  Torres Vedras_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n  [480] Jones, p. 79.\r\n\r\n  [481] Id., p. 107.\r\n\r\nThe total frontage of the southern and stronger series of lines,\r\nthose which Wellington originally planned as his line of defence, was\r\ntwenty-two miles from sea to sea. The outer and northern series of\r\nworks, which was originally only a supplement and outer bulwark to\r\nthe other, was longer, extending to twenty-nine miles, for it crosses\r\nthe peninsula in a diagonal fashion and not on the shortest possible\r\nline that could be drawn. Lastly, the small interior line round St.\r\nJulian’s and Oyeras, which was prepared as the embarking-place of the\r\narmy in the event of defeat, has a circumference of about two miles.\r\nIn all, therefore, fifty-three miles of defences were planned--a\r\nstupendous work, far exceeding, when its elaborate details are\r\nstudied, anything that had been constructed in modern times in the\r\nway of field-fortification.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the character of the Lines in no way\r\nresembles that of our own great Roman wall from Tyne to Solway,\r\nof the wall of China, or of any other long continuous stretch of\r\nmasonry. It is only on a few points that works of any great length\r\nare to be found. The Lines are in essence a series of closed\r\nearthworks, dotted along the commanding points of the two ranges\r\nof hills which Wellington chose as his first and second fronts\r\nof resistance. Some few of the earthworks rose to the dignity of\r\nfortified camps, armed with many scores of guns. The majority of\r\nthem were small redoubts, constructed to hold three to six guns and\r\ngarrisons of two or three hundred men only. But even the smallest of\r\nthem were individually formidable from their structure: the normal\r\nditch was 16 feet wide and 12 feet deep, the parapets 8 to 14 feet\r\nthick, and all were properly fitted with banquettes. When it is\r\nremembered that they were well palisaded, and had outer hindrances\r\nof abattis, _chevaux de frise_, and _trous-de-loup_ scattered in\r\nfront, it is clear that they were forts requiring a regular attack,\r\nnot mere lines of trench and mound. The strength of the whole series\r\nwas that they were placed in scientific fashion, so as to cross\r\nfires over all the ground on which an attacking force was likely to\r\npresent itself. No practicable point of assault could be found on\r\nwhich advancing columns would not be cut up by flanking fire for\r\na very long distance, before they drew near to their objective.\r\nImmense pains had been taken to make the more exposed sections of\r\nthe country-side into one vast glacis. Mounds which might have given\r\ncover had been removed to the last stone, hollow roads filled up,\r\nhouses pulled down, olive-groves and vineyards stubbed up to the\r\nroots, so as to give a perfectly smooth and featureless ascent up\r\nto the line of redoubts. Greatly to Wellington’s credit (as may be\r\nincidentally remarked) compensation was paid on a liberal scale to\r\nall owners of dwellings, mills, fruit-trees, &c., for the havoc made\r\nby these necessary pieces of demolition. The result was a complete\r\nclearance of cover. ‘We have spared neither house, garden, vineyard,\r\nolive-trees, woods, or private property of any description,’ wrote\r\nthe officer in charge of the works to his chief at the end of the\r\npreparations: ‘the only blind to the fire of the works now standing\r\nanywhere is that beautiful avenue of old trees in the pass of Torres\r\nVedras. The Juiz da Fora and the inhabitants pleaded with me so hard\r\nfor the latest moment, lest they might be cut down unnecessarily,\r\nthat I have consented to defer it till the day before the troops\r\nmarch in. As I have trustworthy men with axes in readiness on the\r\nspot, there is no doubt of their being felled in time. The pine woods\r\non the Torres heights are already down, and formed into abattis[482].’\r\n\r\n  [482] Major Jones to Col. Fletcher, the chief engineer, then\r\n  absent on a visit to Wellingtons head quarters. See Jones, _Lines\r\n  of Torres Vedras_, p. 187.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary, or indeed possible, to slope into a glacis the\r\nwhole of the ground in front of each of the lines of defences. In\r\nmany places other methods of making it impassable were used. At the\r\nnorth-western front of the first line, between Torres Vedras and the\r\nsea, for nearly six miles, a long marsh had been created: the river\r\nZizandre had been dammed up, and had filled the whole of the narrow\r\nbottom in which it flows. ‘It has overflowed its banks, and in a\r\nshort time more than half the valley has become so complete a bog\r\nthat no reward can induce any of the peasantry to pass over it[483],’\r\nwrote the officer who had carried out the experiment. Nor was it\r\npossible for the enemy to attempt to drain the bog, for four[484]\r\nredoubts furnished with heavy guns, and placed on dominating\r\npoints of the hillside, commanded the bottom so completely that it\r\nwas impossible for any party to approach it with safety. Yet the\r\nredoubts were out of the range of field-guns on the slopes beyond the\r\nZizandre: only guns of position could have touched them, and Masséna\r\nhad none such with him. Two similar inundations on a smaller scale\r\nhad been caused at the other end of the Lines, by damming up the\r\nAlhandra and Alverca streams, each of which spread out in a marsh a\r\nmile broad, reaching to the foot of the heights above the Tagus, and\r\ncould only be passed on the narrow paved high-road from Santarem to\r\nLisbon.\r\n\r\n  [483] Jones, _Lines_, p. 26.\r\n\r\n  [484] Afterwards, when Masséna had arrived, increased to sixteen\r\n  redoubts with seventy-five guns. See Jones, p. 113.\r\n\r\nIn other places a very different method of making the Lines\r\nunapproachable had been adopted. Where the heights were very steep,\r\nbut not absolutely inaccessible--a dangerous thing to the defence,\r\nfor here ‘dead ground,’ unsearchable by the cannon of the redoubts\r\nabove, must almost necessarily occur,--the slope had been cut or\r\nblasted away in bands, so as to make absolute precipices on a small\r\nscale. At one point above Alhandra[485] this was done on a front\r\nof full 2,000 yards. Even this was not the last precaution taken:\r\nat several places ravines ran deep into the line, and up them\r\ncolumns, more or less under cover, might possibly have penetrated.\r\nSuch ravines, therefore, were stuffed, at chosen points, by a broad\r\nabattis or entanglement, mainly composed of olive-trees with all\r\ntheir chief boughs remaining, dragged together and interlaced for a\r\ndepth of many yards. Such a structure could not be crawled through,\r\nnor could it be hewn down without an infinite waste of time and\r\nlabour; nor, on the other hand, did it afford any cover, since grape\r\nor musketry could play perfectly well through it. The chief of these\r\ntraps was that laid across the long ravine above the village of\r\nArruda, down the bottom of which flows one of the winter torrents\r\nwhich fall eastward into the Tagus.\r\n\r\n  [485] Jones, _Lines_, p. 173. ‘An extent of upwards of 2,000\r\n  yards on the left has been so cut and blasted along its summit\r\n  as to give a continuous scarp, everywhere exceeding 10 feet in\r\n  height, and covered for its whole length by both musketry and\r\n  cannon.’\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that Portugal was a well-wooded country: there are\r\nregions where it would be impossible to procure the immense amount\r\nof timber that was lavished on the accessories of the redoubts. All,\r\nas has been already mentioned, were palisaded; many had in addition\r\nabattis or entanglements thrown up in front of them, some way down\r\nthe hillside, so as to detain the advancing enemy under fire as long\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe works were divided into eight sections, the first line composed\r\nof four, the second line of three, while the eighth consisted of\r\nthe inner retrenchment for purposes of embarkation, at the extreme\r\nsouthern point of the peninsula. Of the outer or secondary line the\r\nthree sections were:\r\n\r\n(1) A front of five miles from the Tagus at Alhandra along the crest\r\nof a steep but not very lofty ridge, as far as the great ravine\r\nthat overlooks the village of Arruda. This front was elaborately\r\nfortified, as it blocks the great road, in the flat by the waterside,\r\nwhich forms the easiest approach to Lisbon from the north. In the\r\nfive miles there were ultimately constructed no less than 23 redoubts\r\nwith 96 guns. Two thousand yards of hillside in one place had been\r\nscarped into a precipice; a mile by the side of the Tagus had been\r\ninundated. The one considerable gap in the line, the ravine at the\r\nhead of the valley of Calandriz, had been choked by one of the great\r\n_abattis_ above described. The redoubts required a garrison of 6,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n(2) The second section, from the ravine above Arruda to the left of\r\nthe steep Monte Agraça, formed somewhat of a salient angle: it had\r\na front in all of some four and a half miles, which included the\r\nmost lofty and defensible part of the backbone range of the Lisbon\r\npeninsula. One of the four great paved roads entering the capital\r\nfrom the north, however, passes over the shoulder of these heights,\r\nand they were therefore very heavily fortified from the first, the\r\nlarge redoubt for 1,600 men, on the top of Monte Agraça being one of\r\nthe original outer works ordered for construction in Wellington’s\r\nearliest notes of October 1809. There were in all seven redoubts\r\nmounting 55 guns and requiring a garrison of 3,000 men on this\r\nfraction of the lines.\r\n\r\n(3) Quite different in character was the front of eight miles from\r\nthe left of Monte Agraça to the pass of Runa, overlooking the upper\r\nvalley of the Zizandre and the village of Sobral. The fortification\r\nof this line had not entered into Wellington’s original plan, and\r\nthere were only two redoubts upon it when Masséna appeared before it\r\nin October 1810. Such defence as there was consisted in the fact that\r\nthe dominating Monte Agraça redoubts overlooked it on the right, and\r\nthat the two small works just mentioned commanded the main high-road\r\nfrom Sobral to Cabeça de Montechique, which goes through its centre.\r\nBut there was a clear possibility that the enemy might make a push up\r\nthe valley and the high-road, by the village of Zibreira, and this\r\nwas indeed the most probable point of attack in the whole 29 miles of\r\nfront for the enemy to select. When, at the last moment, the British\r\nCommander-in-Chief determined to hold the outer lines, and not merely\r\nto fall back after having used them for a temporary defence, he had\r\nto cram this point with troops, and to construct new works upon it\r\nas quickly as possible. Four divisions, therefore, more than 20,000\r\nmen, were concentrated here. Wellington’s own head quarters were\r\nestablished at the hamlet of Pero Negro, on the slope above the\r\nhigh-road, and a very large redoubt was thrown up on the Portello\r\nhill, above Zibreira, with several smaller ones further to the right,\r\nto connect it with the Monte Agraça works. Sobral, the village at\r\nthe foot of the heights, was held as an outpost, but abandoned when\r\nMasséna pushed forward to the front, as it was too far advanced to\r\nthe north to be treated as an integral part of the position. But the\r\nFrench, when they had carried Sobral with difficulty, looked at the\r\nmain line behind it, and refused to attempt any further advance. The\r\nhillside was as formidable as the Bussaco heights from which they had\r\nonly recently been repulsed: it was full of troops and growing in\r\nstrength every moment as the earthworks continued to arise.\r\n\r\n(4) The fourth section of the outer or northern front was that from\r\nthe gorge of the Zizandre (or the pass of Runa, as it is sometimes\r\ncalled) to the sea. It was about twelve miles long, but of this space\r\nsix miles and more was covered by the impassable bog formed by the\r\nobstructed Zizandre, and another mile was formed by the formidable\r\nentrenched camp of San Vincente, above the town of Torres Vedras, the\r\nmost complete and self-sufficing of all the works in the peninsula.\r\nThis stronghold lay outside the main line, beyond the river, covering\r\nthe bridge and the paved _chaussée_ from Leiria to Lisbon, the only\r\ncarriage-road on the western side of the Lines[486]. It was one\r\nof the earliest of the fortifications commenced by Wellington’s\r\nengineers, having been started on November 8, 1809, and was placed in\r\nsuch a conspicuous point, and planned on such a large scale, that it\r\nattracted public attention more than any other part of the works, and\r\ngave its name to the whole in popular parlance[487]. The whole front\r\non both sides of Torres Vedras and its great fort was so strong and\r\ninaccessible as to offer little temptation to the invader to select\r\nit as a point of serious attack, all the more so because troops\r\nbrought opposite to it would be completely cut off from any left in\r\nfront of the eastern and central part of the lines. For the geography\r\nof the peninsula at this point is peculiar: north of the gorge of\r\nthe Zizandre the great backbone range, the Serra de Barregudo and\r\nthe Serra de Monte Junta, extends for a distance of fifteen miles,\r\nwithout being crossed by a single road practicable for horses, much\r\nless for wheeled vehicles. There are nothing but goat-tracks across\r\nthe heights. If, therefore, any considerable body of troops had been\r\nsent to observe or contain the western section of the lines, it\r\nwould have been separated by two days’ march from the rest of the\r\narmy, and liable to be crushed, ere succoured, by the defenders of\r\nLisbon, who had good cross-roads across the peninsula, by which they\r\ncould transfer themselves from point to point under the protection\r\nof their works. As a matter of fact, nothing but flying parties of\r\nFrench horse ever appeared in this direction. Masséna had not troops\r\nto spare for any secondary attack, more especially for one on such an\r\nunpromising part of the Lines. Wellington had foreseen this when he\r\ndistributed his field army behind the various sections of the front:\r\nto support the garrisons of the twelve miles of redoubts about Torres\r\nVedras he only placed one division, while there were three behind\r\nthe eastern section, and more than four in the partially entrenched\r\ncentral part[488].\r\n\r\n  [486] By an astonishing blunder the camp of Torres Vedras is\r\n  placed by Napier in his map (and apparently in his text also)\r\n  _south_ of the river Zizandre, on the main line of heights,\r\n  while in reality it was a great _tête-du-pont_ covering the only\r\n  passage from north to south over the stream and its bogs.\r\n\r\n  [487] See note to that effect in Jones, p. 21.\r\n\r\n  [488] The third division (Picton) only, behind Torres Vedras.\r\n  Behind the Alhandra-Arruda section were the 2nd (Hill),\r\n  Hamilton’s Portuguese, and the Light Division; in the central\r\n  part the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th Divisions and three unattached\r\n  Portuguese brigades (Pack, Coleman, and Al. Campbell).\r\n\r\nPassing on to the second line of defence, from Quintella on the Tagus\r\nto the mouth of the Rio São Lourenço on the Atlantic, we find three\r\nsections of defence, which, unlike those of the outer line, were all\r\ncompleted by September 1810, and had no central gap.\r\n\r\n(1) There was over a mile of impassable inundation at the eastern\r\nend, between Quintella and Alverca. Above the first-named village\r\nwas an isolated hill, which was all fortress, for no less than six\r\nredoubts had been placed upon it, to enfilade the high-road across\r\nthe inundated lower ground. Then came the Serra de Serves, three\r\nmiles of lofty and difficult hills, which had been scarped into\r\nalmost perfect inaccessibility. In a sudden dip west of this range\r\nwas the pass of Bucellas, through which runs one of the three great\r\nhigh-roads that enter Lisbon. It was easily defensible, as it lies\r\nbetween two high and steep mountain-sides, and is only a couple of\r\nhundred yards broad. Redoubts were placed so as to rake it from end\r\nto end, and to flank it on both sides. The _chaussée_ itself was\r\nblocked with successive abattis, and the viaduct leading up to it was\r\nmined.\r\n\r\n(2) The second section of the inner line extended from the pass\r\nof Bucellas to the Park of Mafra, a front of over six miles. The\r\neastern part of this was formed by the towering heights of the\r\nCabeça de Montechique, the most dominating mountain-summit in the\r\nwhole peninsula, almost steep enough to defend itself without\r\nfortification; but three redoubts nevertheless had been reared upon\r\nits summit. But from the pass of Montechique, at the left side of\r\nthe summit, down to Mafra the ground was less well marked, and here\r\nthe _chaussée_ from Sobral and Zibreira crossed the range. Much\r\nfortification, therefore, was lavished on these four miles, along\r\nwhich there were nine strong redoubts, connected with each other in\r\nthe rear by a military road passing along the southern crest of the\r\nheights. There was a second and formidable ridge behind this line,\r\nwhere further defence could be offered in the unlikely event of the\r\nenemy forcing his way up the high-road.\r\n\r\n(3) From Mafra to the sea, nearly ten miles, there was for the most\r\npart a well-marked line of heights protected in front by the ravine\r\nof the river of São Lourenço, a deep, rugged, and in many cases\r\ninaccessible cleft, only crossed by a single road, that from Torres\r\nVedras to Mafra. Nevertheless, six redoubts were reared, to cover\r\nthis, and the few other points where the ravine was passable. The\r\neastern part of this section, that along the wall of the Royal Park\r\n(Tapada) of Mafra, was its weakest portion, and for two miles at\r\nthis point the British engineers set all their ingenuity to work.\r\nThe outlying heights called the Serra de Chypre, in front of the\r\npark, were covered by four redoubts, and turned into a first defence.\r\nThe wall of the Tapada itself was loopholed and furnished with a\r\nbanquette. The important road which passes its foot was obstructed\r\nwith cuts, enfiladed by the artillery of several works, and stockaded\r\nat more than one point. There was another group of redoubts along the\r\nsouth end of the Torres Vedras road, at the village of Morugueira;\r\nand finally Mafra town, in the rear of all, was turned into a\r\ndefensive post by means of trenches and barricades. Altogether, what\r\nwas by nature the weakest point in the southern lines was made by\r\nart one of the strongest. This too, in spite of the fact that, being\r\napproachable only from Torres Vedras, it was on the whole not a\r\nprobable front on which to expect an attack.\r\n\r\nA mere mention must suffice for the eighth section of the defensive\r\nworks, the semicircle at St. Julian’s and Oyeras which was intended\r\nto protect the embarkation of the army if the worst should come. It\r\nwas strongly entrenched, and could be held by a very few battalions,\r\nwhile the rest were utilizing the numerous and solid piers alongside\r\nof which the fleet of transports was to be moored.\r\n\r\nHaving described the Lines, it remains that we should describe the\r\ngarrison set to guard them, detailing separately each element,\r\nregular and irregular. The forces at the disposition of Wellington\r\nwere materially increased at the moment of his arrival within\r\nthe Lines. On October 8 he found at his disposition a brigade of\r\nthree battalions newly arrived at Lisbon, the 1/50th, 1/71st, and\r\n1/92nd, all old Corunna regiments which had served in the Walcheren\r\nexpedition, and were still none too healthy from their long sojourn\r\nin the deadly marshes of Zeeland. There had also landed about the\r\nsame time the 94th regiment, and the Brunswick Oels Light Infantry,\r\na foreign battalion raised from the refugees who had fought under\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick in the abortive North German insurrection of\r\n1809. Moreover, two battalions--the 2/30th and 2/44th--had just been\r\nsent to Lisbon from Cadiz, where General Graham now thought that\r\nthe British contingent was larger than was absolutely necessary.\r\nThe 1/4th and 1/23rd came out a little later, and do not appear in\r\nthe fortnighty ‘general state’ of the army till November 15. Thus\r\nthe army was swelled by nine battalions, or some 6,500 men[489]. No\r\ncavalry, however, had arrived.\r\n\r\n  [489] About 5,800 rank and file, with 250 officers and 350\r\n  sergeants and drummers, by mid-winter return.\r\n\r\nWellington used these new arrivals to form a new 6th Division of\r\ninfantry, and to complete to full strength the 5th Division, which\r\nhad hitherto possessed only one British brigade. He did not, however,\r\nkeep the lately landed units together: acting on the principle which\r\nhe always followed, of mixing veteran acclimatized battalions with new\r\narrivals, he formed the new 6th Division by adding Campbell’s brigade,\r\ntaken from Cole’s 4th Division, to two Portuguese regiments the 8th\r\nand the Lusitanian Legion, both of which had been hitherto attached\r\nto the 5th Division, and had served with Leith at Bussaco. In the 4th\r\nDivision, Campbell’s brigade was replaced by that of Pakenham, taken\r\nfrom Spencer’s 1st Division, while compensation was made to Spencer,\r\nby giving him the newly landed 1/50th, 1/71st, and 1/92nd, as a new\r\nbrigade under Erskine. The 5th Division under Leith got three more\r\nof the fresh arrivals, the 1/4th, 2/30th, and 2/44th as its second\r\nbrigade. The 94th was given to Picton’s second brigade,--which had\r\nhitherto consisted of only 2⅓ battalions,--to raise it to average\r\nbrigade-strength. The Brunswick Oels Jägers, being a light corps, were\r\npartly divided up into separate companies and told off to different\r\nbrigades (as the 5/60th, a similar unit, had already been), though the\r\nhead quarters and six companies joined Pakenham’s brigade in the 4th\r\nDivision. But when the 1/23rd, the last of the reinforcements, came\r\nout, it also joined Pakenham, while the Brunswickers were transferred\r\nto the Light Division--where they did not long abide[490].\r\n\r\n  [490] For all these changes see Atkinson’s admirable ‘Composition\r\n  of the British Army in the Peninsula,’ printed in the _English\r\n  Historical Review_.\r\n\r\nEven after allowing for the trifling losses at Bussaco, the British\r\nfield army in Portugal was now far larger than it had ever been\r\nbefore, the gross total of troops in the Lines amounting to 42,000\r\nmen, of whom about 7,000 were sick or detached, and 35,000 were\r\npresent under arms. This figure does not include the two battalions\r\nof marines who guarded St. Julian’s and the lines around it at the\r\nmouth of the Tagus.\r\n\r\nOf Portuguese regulars, Wellington had now under his hand the 24,000\r\nmen who had fought at Bussaco, plus the 1,400 cavalry under Fane and\r\nthe brigade under Bradford (now consisting of five battalions)[491]\r\nwhich had been guarding the position behind the Alva on the day of\r\nthe battle, together with the reserve artillery of Lisbon. The total\r\nmade 27,500 men, of whom 24,500 were with the colours and 3,000 sick\r\nin hospital.\r\n\r\n  [491] The 12th and 13th line regiments and the 5th Caçadores, not\r\n  much over 2,500 bayonets in all.\r\n\r\nOf militia there were three brigades and four isolated units more\r\nwithin the Lines--the Southern Beira brigade of Lecor, three\r\nregiments[492], the Northern Estremaduran brigade of Miranda,\r\nalso three regiments[493], and the Lisbon local brigade of five\r\nregiments[494] with two stray units from the north[495], and two from\r\nthe south[496]. The numbers of all the regiments ran very low, owing\r\nto the way in which they had been neglected and under-fed by their\r\ngovernment, since they were called out nine months before; many had\r\ndied, and far more had deserted. The thirteen corps did not between\r\nthem supply more than 8,200 men present under arms, with 1,000 sick\r\nin hospital. In addition there were 3,200 artillerymen improvised\r\nfrom the ranks of the infantry militia or the Ordenança, making\r\naltogether 12,400 troops of the ‘second line.’\r\n\r\n  [492] Idanha, Castello Branco, Covilhão.\r\n\r\n  [493] Thomar, Leiria, Santarem; the fourth battalion (Tondella)\r\n  was in garrison at Peniche, as was also a considerable body of\r\n  dépôt troops from the line, half-trained recruits, &c.\r\n\r\n  [494] 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Lisbon, and Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\n  [495] Feira and Vizeu, properly belonging to Trant’s corps, but\r\n  somehow separated from it.\r\n\r\n  [496] Setubal and Alcaçer do Sul.\r\n\r\nAs to the Ordenança who had taken refuge in and about Lisbon with\r\ntheir families, when the whole population of southwestern Beira and\r\nnorthern Estremadura retired within the Lines, it is impossible to\r\nobtain any figures, save that they supplied the bulk of the 3,000\r\nvolunteer artillerymen just mentioned above, and that the picked men\r\nof the Ordenança of the capital itself had been organized into two\r\nbattalions of ‘Atiradores Nacionales’ of about 450 men each. The\r\nwhole may have amounted to any number from 20,000 up to 40,000 men,\r\nof whom about two-thirds were armed with muskets, the rest, those\r\nfrom the remoter districts, having still nothing better than pikes.\r\nAs most of them were scattered with their families in the villages\r\nwhere they had taken refuge, or the camps of huts which they had\r\nformed in sheltered situations, they could hardly be considered to be\r\nin a state of mobilization, and certainly were of no use either for\r\ngarrisoning forts or for employment in the line of battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINES OF TORRES VEDRAS]\r\n\r\nLastly, in calculating the forces which Wellington accumulated within\r\nthe Lines, we must mention the two Spanish divisions from the Army\r\nof Estremadura. Hearing that all was quiet for the moment on the\r\nfrontier of Andalusia, the British Commander had asked the Marquis\r\nof La Romana, whether, in accordance with a promise made so long ago\r\nas July, he could spare any troops to assist in the holding back of\r\nthe main French army of invasion. The Marquis, with a liberality of\r\nwhich the Cadiz Regency would have disapproved, if its leave had been\r\nasked, replied that he would bring up his two reserve divisions.\r\nLeaving Ballasteros on the Andalusian border, and another division\r\nunder Imaz at Badajoz, in addition to the garrison and Madden’s\r\nPortuguese cavalry, he marched for Aldea Gallega and Lisbon with the\r\ntroops of La Carrera[497] and Charles O’Donnell[498], about 8,000\r\nmen. On October 25th he had arrived at the cantonments behind Mafra,\r\non the second line of defence, which his ally had requested him to\r\noccupy. Wellington defended the bringing up of these troops by the\r\nplea ‘that he did not think himself justified in not bringing into\r\nhis positions all the force which was at his disposal’[499]. But it\r\nis doubtful whether the advantage of getting 8,000 Spanish troops\r\nwithin the Lines justified the danger incurred in Estremadura, when\r\nit was possible that Soult might send out Mortier at any moment\r\nto attack the depleted army that covered the approach to Badajoz.\r\nNapoleon thought that he should have done so, and when he heard of\r\nthe arrival of La Romana at Lisbon, wrote to censure the Duke of\r\nDalmatia in the fiercest strain[500]. ‘It was a shame and a scandal\r\nthat he had retired to Seville: the 5th Corps had orders to be always\r\nat La Romana’s heels, and to prevent him from moving into Portugal,\r\nso that the news of its return to Seville roused the Emperor’s\r\nsurprise and anger.’ There can be no doubt that Napoleon did well to\r\nbe angry. The balance of affairs in Andalusia tended to stand at an\r\nequipoise precisely because La Romana’s army was strong enough to\r\nkeep the 5th Corps employed. When 8,000 men had been withdrawn by the\r\nMarquis to the Lisbon lines, Mortier was in a position to sweep all\r\nbefore him as far as the gates of Badajoz, or to execute a raid into\r\nthe Alemtejo if that course seemed preferable. But Soult did not send\r\nhis lieutenant on this errand on his own initiative, but waited till\r\nhe received direct orders to do so from Paris. By that time it was\r\ntoo late, and neither the disaster of the Gebora nor even the fall\r\nof Badajoz had any influence on the course of events in Portugal.\r\nMasséna was forced to retreat before a single patrol from the Army\r\nof Andalusia had got into touch with his outposts. What might have\r\nhappened if Soult had launched his blow at Badajoz in October, and\r\nhad appeared on the left bank of the Lower Tagus in December, it is\r\nimpossible to say. Probably Wellington would have found some means of\r\naverting disaster, but it is unquestionable that his task of defence\r\nwould have been made far more difficult.\r\n\r\n  [497] Who had now resigned the command of the cavalry, and gone\r\n  back to his old infantry division.\r\n\r\n  [498] The ‘Vanguard’ and 2nd Division of his army.\r\n\r\n  [499] _Dispatches_, vi. p. 544.\r\n\r\n  [500] _Correspondance_, xxi. pp. 273, 295.\r\n\r\nFor the full realization of the meaning of the Lines of Torres Vedras\r\nthere are two general facts which must be remembered. Firstly, they\r\nwere garrisoned by troops which formed no part of the field army.\r\nWellington’s sixty thousand regulars were not frittered away in the\r\ngarrisoning of redoubts, but were held in masses behind the lines,\r\nready to reinforce any threatened point, and to deliver a pitched\r\nbattle in the open, if the head of the French army were thrust\r\nthrough the defences at some weak section. The generals of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who so often built lines, and\r\nwere so easily evicted from them, suffered disaster because they drew\r\nout their armies in one attenuated thread, and were therefore weak\r\nat every point, and always inferior to the assailant at the place\r\nwhere he made his assault. Wellington’s army was (with the exception\r\nof the 3rd Division at Torres Vedras) gathered in two solid masses,\r\none facing Sobral, on the heights between Monte Agraça and Runa, the\r\nsecond and smaller behind Alhandra. The one could reach the other in\r\nhalf a day’s march, for the roads behind and parallel to the lines\r\nhad been put in good repair.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this vast system of redoubts was to be held by the\r\ntroops of the second line, and by them only. There were altogether\r\nsome 20,000 men of the second line in the fortifications, composed of\r\n(1) the 8,000 (afterwards raised to 11,000) militia infantry. (2) Of\r\nabout 800 Portuguese regular artillery, aided by over 2,000 gunners\r\npicked from the militia and Ordenança, trained by the regulars and\r\nincorporated with them. (3) Of some 250 British artillerymen from\r\nthe batteries which had been lying in reserve at Lisbon. (4) Of\r\npicked companies of the Lisbon Ordenança (atiradores) drilled into a\r\nstate of discipline not much worse than that of the militia. (5) Of\r\nthe landing force of 2,000 British marines, partly from the fleet,\r\npartly brought specially from England to garrison the proposed lines\r\nof embarkation at St. Julian’s. (6) Of the dépôts, convalescents and\r\nrecruits of the eight Line regiments of infantry raised from Lisbon\r\nand Southern Estremadura--about 4,000 strong.\r\n\r\nIn all, therefore, there were about 20,000 men, mostly troops of\r\nsecondary quality, or 28,000 if the Spanish auxiliaries are counted,\r\nready to man the Lines, without a man being withdrawn from the ranks\r\nof the field army. The outer lines were calculated to require about\r\n18,000 men for the redoubts, the inner ones 14,000, but clearly both\r\ndid not require to be manned at once. If the outer line were broken,\r\nthe garrison-troops from the intact parts of it could fall back on\r\nthe second. Meanwhile the field army would be engaging any French\r\ncolumns that might have broken through, and there would be ample\r\ntime to arrange for the manning of the second and stronger front.\r\nBut it must be repeated once more that it was not on the passive\r\ndefence of the redoubts by their garrisons that Wellington reckoned\r\nfor success, but on the fighting of the field army, who would tackle\r\nthe columns of attack that had committed themselves to the assault\r\nof the section--whichever it might be--that Masséna might select as\r\nhis objective. All criticism based on general principles concerning\r\nthe weakness of long extended lines falls to the ground, when it is\r\nremembered that Wellington had his army massed for a pitched battle\r\nin and behind his defences, not strung out on an interminable front.\r\n\r\nThe last point on which stress must be laid is that the most careful\r\narrangements for the transmission of orders and intelligence from end\r\nto end of the Lines had been made. There were five signal-stations,\r\nwith semaphores worked by seamen on (1) the redoubt No. 30 near the\r\nAtlantic, (2) the great redoubt of Torres Vedras, (3) the Monte de\r\nSocorro above Wellington’s head quarters at Pero Negro, (4) the\r\nsummit of the Monte Agraça, (5) the hill behind Alhandra on the\r\nTagus. After some practice it was found that a message could be sent\r\nfrom one end to the other of the 29 miles in _seven_ minutes, and\r\nfrom No. 3, the head quarters semaphore, to either end of the Lines\r\nin _four_ minutes. There was a similar line of four semaphores on\r\nthe second, or main, series of defences. Military roads had been\r\nopened behind both the fronts, so that troops could be moved along\r\nthe shortest possible line. On the other hand, it was fortunate that\r\nthere existed no cross-road from sea to sea _outside_ the Lines,\r\nwhich could be of any practical use to the invader. The only route of\r\nthis sort, that from Alemquer by Sobral to Runa, was commanded for\r\nthe whole length from Sobral to Runa by the British heights, whose\r\nfoot it hugs, while from Sobral to Alemquer it is separated from\r\nthe Lines by the steep and pathless ridge of Galaria, across which\r\nnothing on wheels could pass. Nevertheless, here lay the invaders’\r\nbest chance--corps placed on this road, and screened by the ridge,\r\ncould be moved for some distance to left or right unseen from the\r\nLines. The road, however, was bad, rocky, and narrow: it is marked as\r\nthe ‘Calçada Arruinada’ or ‘ruined road’ in contemporary maps. The\r\nother paved road in this direction, that from Sobral to Arruda and\r\nAlhandra, passed through the line of ground occupied by the British\r\nat two points, and was under fire from the redoubts at short range\r\nfor the rest of its course: it was absolutely impracticable.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be added that the navy had been utilized for\r\nauxiliary service: not only were its marines under orders to man the\r\nSt. Julian’s lines, but its seamen had fitted out all the gunboats\r\nin the Lisbon arsenal. A flotilla of great strength infested the\r\nTagus estuary, and by the fire of its heavy guns prevented the French\r\nfrom approaching the shore, or endeavouring to build boats at the\r\nmouths of its creeks. If any attacks had been made upon either of the\r\nextreme ends of the Lines, the columns delivering them would have\r\nbeen under fire from the sea throughout their operations. But, as we\r\nshall see, the French never contemplated this: the one temptation\r\nwhich Masséna felt was to assault, far inland, the gap in front of\r\nSobral between the Monte Agraça and the Serra de Socorro. And there,\r\nas we shall see, at the critical moment, prudence got the better of\r\nambition, and the invader turned back foiled. The high-water mark of\r\nFrench conquest in Europe was reached on the knoll by Sobral on the\r\nwet and gusty 14th of October, 1810.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMASSÉNA BEFORE THE LINES OF TORRES VEDRAS: HIS RETREAT TO SANTAREM\r\n(OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of October 10, when Craufurd made his hasty retreat to\r\nSobral, and went within the Lines, Montbrun had his head quarters at\r\nAlemquer, where he kept Taupin’s infantry brigade, and Lamotte’s and\r\nSainte-Croix’s cavalry. Pierre Soult’s light horse felt towards their\r\nleft, in the direction of the Tagus, and occupied Carregado, where\r\nthey failed to find any British outposts, Hill’s corps having been\r\nwithdrawn behind the brook which enters the Tagus near Castanheira.\r\nThe main body of the army was far to the rear, in one vast column:\r\nNey’s and Reynier’s corps lay that night in and about Alcoentre:\r\nJunot’s bivouacked around the convent of Nossa Senhora de Maxeira,\r\na short distance to the south of Alcoentre. All the troops were\r\nterribly fatigued by three days’ movement in torrential rain, and had\r\nno more marching-power left in them.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the following morning (October 11) that Montbrun\r\ndiscovered the Lines. His cavalry had been ordered to move forward on\r\nthe two roads across which they lay. Pierre Soult therefore pushed\r\nfor Villafranca, on the high road which skirts the Tagus; he found\r\nHill’s outlying pickets at Villafranca, drove them out of the town,\r\nand on passing it came in sight of the line of redoubts and scarped\r\nhillside above Alhandra, which was manned by the Portuguese militia\r\nand backed by Hill’s British infantry. It was impossible to advance\r\nfurther, so the brigadier, leaving an advanced post in Villafranca,\r\ndrew back his three regiments to Castanheira, and sent his report to\r\nMontbrun.\r\n\r\nThat general himself, with the main body of his cavalry, had\r\nfollowed the rough road from Alemquer to Lisbon. He drove in some\r\nBritish dragoon pickets, and then arrived in front of the village\r\nof Sobral, which he found occupied by the infantry outposts of\r\nSpencer’s division. He did not attempt to push further that day,\r\nas his flanking reconnaissance had come in sight of the sections\r\nof the Lines behind Arruda and behind Zibreira, where redoubts and\r\nsolid lines of infantry were visible. Sobral itself was clearly\r\nnot held in force, nor did it form an integral part of the British\r\nposition. But Montbrun feared to attack it, when he had only a single\r\nbrigade of infantry to the front, while many thousands of British\r\ntroops might issue from the Lines to overwhelm him if he committed\r\nhimself to a serious attack. The village on its knoll was left alone\r\nfor the present, though it was tempting to contemplate the seizure\r\nof a point which lay so far forward--less than two miles from the\r\nfront of Wellington’s chosen position. But Montbrun contented\r\nhimself with sending back word to Masséna that he had come upon a\r\ncontinuous line of fortifications stretching from the Tagus bank to\r\nsome point westward, which was not yet discovered. For his furthest\r\nreconnaissances towards Runa and the Upper Zizandre had found the\r\nenemy in front of them, however far they pushed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Masséna’s tired infantry of the main body had made hardly\r\nany movement: the 2nd and 6th Corps still lay about Alcoentre. Junot\r\nalone with the 8th Corps advanced as far as Moinho de Cubo, half way\r\nbetween Alcoentre and Alemquer. Thus Wellington was given a whole\r\nday more to arrange his troops in their positions along the Lines.\r\nOn this morning he was rather under the impression that the French\r\nattack would be directed upon Alhandra and Hill’s corps, which, he\r\nobserved, would be a ‘tough job, defended as all the entrances of the\r\nvalleys are by redoubts, and the villages by abattis[501].’ Moreover,\r\nthe French ‘positively could not’ get guns up to attack the line west\r\nof Hill, since, in the existing state of the weather, no cannon could\r\nleave the paved roads, and the only path of that description leading\r\nfrom the Sobral direction to the Tagus bank ran through Arruda, where\r\nCraufurd and the Light Division were now comfortably installed.\r\nConsidering it likely, therefore, that Masséna would bring a heavy\r\nattacking force, by circuitous roads from the rear, to Villafranca,\r\nin order to make a frontal attack on Hill along the high-road by the\r\nTagus, Wellington warned Craufurd and Spencer to be ready to move in\r\neastward to the assistance of the extreme right wing of the Lines.\r\nIn the afternoon, however, he discovered that the force in front of\r\nSobral (Montbrun) seemed much larger than that in front of Alhandra\r\n(Pierre Soult), and showed more signs of making wide-spreading\r\nreconnaissances. He therefore drew up an alternative scheme, by\r\nwhich, in the event of an attack on Spencer’s front at Zibreira,\r\nCole’s and Campbell’s (the new 6th) divisions were to support the\r\nthreatened point, and even Picton was to come in from the distant\r\nTorres Vedras[502]. No French troops were reported from this last\r\ndirection, and De Grey’s cavalry pickets from Ramalhal (far outside\r\nthe Lines) reported that not the smallest party of the enemy’s horse\r\nhad been seen west of the Serra de Barregudo or the Monte Junta[503].\r\n\r\n  [501] _Dispatches_, vi. 502, to Craufurd.\r\n\r\n  [502] Wellington to Spencer, afternoon of Oct. 11, _Dispatches_,\r\n  vi. 505.\r\n\r\n  [503] Wellington to Craufurd, same day, _Dispatches_, vi. 504.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th Montbrun made a movement which seemed to justify\r\nWellington’s first idea, that Hill was to receive the French attack.\r\nHe moved Taupin’s brigade, the only hostile infantry which had yet\r\nbeen seen, southward from Alemquer to Villafranca on the Tagus. This\r\nwas done, however, only because the whole 8th Corps was coming up on\r\nthis day from Moinho de Cubo by Alemquer to Sobral, which it reached\r\nin the afternoon, replacing Taupin’s small force. Its arrival was\r\nat once reported to Wellington, who saw that his second theory of\r\nthe intention of the enemy, not his first, had been correct, and\r\ntransferred his main attention to the side of Sobral. That village,\r\nby some extraordinary blunder on the part of Sir Brent Spencer, had\r\nbeen evacuated by the pickets of the 1st Division during the night of\r\nthe 11th-12th[504]. They were put back into it, by the special orders\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief, in the early morning, for Wellington\r\nwished to hold it as long as was safe, on account of the fine view\r\nobtainable from its knoll over the routes from Alemquer by which\r\nthe enemy must approach. Hence, when Junot’s advanced guard came up\r\nin the afternoon, there was a collision at Sobral. The troops of\r\nClausel finally succeeded in expelling the British outposts, which\r\nbelonged to Erskine’s and Löwe’s brigade, from the village. The\r\ncasualties were few on both sides--nineteen men only were lost by the\r\nBritish[505]. The retiring pickets did not fall back into the Lines,\r\nbut clung to the other side of the ravine which separates Sobral from\r\nthe lower slopes of Monte Agraça. They were only 300 yards from the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n  [504] Wellington to Chas. Stuart, _Dispatches_, vi. 506.\r\n  D’Urban’s invaluable diary has the note. ‘Oct. 11: ’Tis\r\n  difficult to account for all this, which must be vexatious to\r\n  the Commander-in-Chief, who, aware of the importance of the\r\n  heights in front of Sobral, must have wished to keep them for the\r\n  present.... Oct. 12: In the morning the enemy was no more to be\r\n  seen, and what we should never have given up, we were fortunately\r\n  permitted to re-occupy. But at nightfall the French, with about\r\n  six battalions, retook the height and town of Sobral.’\r\n\r\n  [505] Of the nineteen casualties, nine belonged to the\r\n  newly-landed 71st, four to the German Legion, six to the company\r\n  of the 5/60th attached to Erskine. See Return in Record Office.\r\n\r\nWhile this skirmish was in progress the main body of the French were\r\nat last set in motion from Alcoentre. The 6th Corps advanced this\r\nday (October 12) to Moinho de Cubo and Otta; the 2nd Corps, taking\r\na road more to the east, so as to lean towards the Tagus, arrived\r\nat Carregado. Junot’s corps was encamped behind Sobral, Clausel’s\r\ndivision having its advanced posts (Brigade Ménard) in the village,\r\nwhile Solignac lay two miles to the rear. The weather was still\r\nabominable, and all the movements were accomplished with great\r\nfatigue and delay.\r\n\r\nOn this afternoon the French army suffered the loss of its most\r\nbrilliant and energetic cavalry officer. General Sainte-Croix, while\r\nexploring the Tagus bank, north of Villafranca, in search of deserted\r\nboats, was cut in two by a cannon shot from a British gunboat which\r\nwas watching his cavalry from the estuary. He was held to be the only\r\nofficer, except Colonel Pelet, who had any personal influence with\r\nMasséna[506], and as that influence was always exerted on the side\r\nof daring action, it is probable that the many French diarists who\r\ndeplore his death are right in considering that it may have had some\r\npositive effect on the conduct of the campaign[507].\r\n\r\n  [506] Sainte-Croix had been the Marshal’s chief-of-the-staff\r\n  during the Wagram campaign, and was generally reputed to have\r\n  been responsible for some of the boldest moves made by Masséna’s\r\n  army during that period.\r\n\r\n  [507] That Fririon is correct in dating Sainte-Croix’s death\r\n  on the 12th, and Delagrave and others wrong in placing it on\r\n  the 16th, is proved by an entry in D’Urban’s diary of Oct. 15,\r\n  stating that it had just been discovered that the general killed\r\n  in front of Alhandra was called Sainte-Croix. Clearly then he was\r\n  dead before the 16th.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 12th-13th Wellington had become convinced, and\r\nrightly, that the great mass of Junot’s corps, visible behind Sobral,\r\nconstituted the main danger to his position. He therefore drew in\r\ntroops from his right, even calling down from Torres Vedras Picton,\r\nin whose front no enemy was yet visible. From Monte Agraça to the\r\nPortello redoubts he put in line four British divisions--Spencer,\r\nCole, Picton, and Campbell, along with Pack’s independent Portuguese\r\nbrigade; this last was placed in the great redoubt on Monte Agraça,\r\nwhich dominated Sobral and all the lower hills. In reserve were two\r\nmore divisions--the 5th under Leith, and a temporary Portuguese\r\ndivision consisting of the brigades of Coleman and Alex. Campbell.\r\nAltogether 30,000 men were concentrated on this comparatively short\r\nfront of about four miles, besides the militia and artillery who\r\ngarrisoned the minor forts[508]. Junot, whose corps did not now\r\nmuster more than 12,000 men, did wisely to refrain from making any\r\nserious attack. He was not, however, wholly quiescent: attempting to\r\nextend his troops more to the right, to the west of Sobral, along\r\nthe undulating ground in the direction of the Upper Zizandre, he\r\ngot into touch with the outlying pickets of Cole’s division, which\r\nstood beyond those of Spencer and Picton in the British line. The\r\nfirst attack fell on the light companies of the 7th Fusiliers and the\r\nnewly-arrived Brunswick Oels battalion. When they were driven in,\r\nCole fed his fighting-line with the light companies of Hervey’s [late\r\nCollins’s] Portuguese brigade. Finding his voltigeurs outnumbered,\r\nJunot, in a similar fashion, sent up Gratien’s brigade from his\r\nsecond division to reinforce his advance. Hence there ensued some\r\nsharp skirmishing, which lasted several hours, till Cole drew back\r\nhis outpost line from the lower plateaux north of Sobral to the foot\r\nof his fighting-position, on the heights below the Portello redoubts.\r\nJunot had thus gained a mile of ground, but not ground that was of\r\nany service to him for a regular attack on the Lines, since it was\r\nmerely part of the rolling upland that was dominated by Wellington’s\r\nmain position. The 4th Division lost twenty-five British and a\r\nmuch larger number of Portuguese in this long bicker. Hervey the\r\nPortuguese brigadier was wounded. The French casualties were probably\r\na little the larger[509].\r\n\r\n  [508] For his dispositions for resisting the suspected attack see\r\n  _Dispatches_, vi. pp. 507-9 of Oct. 13. The line running from\r\n  right to left was (1) Pack’s Portuguese in the great redoubt\r\n  facing Sobral, (2) 1st Division between the redoubt and Zibreira,\r\n  (3) Picton touching Spencer’s left, (4) Cole touching Picton’s\r\n  left, (5) Campbell (new 6th Division) on Cole’s left, reaching to\r\n  the Portello redoubts. Each of these divisions had one brigade in\r\n  reserve. A separate general reserve was formed by Leith behind\r\n  the right, and Coleman’s and Alex. Campbell’s Portuguese behind\r\n  the left.\r\n\r\n  [509] I find in the note to Gachot’s excellent editions of\r\n  Delagrave’s _Campagne de Portugal_ that the losses of the\r\n  French on this day were 157 men, those of the allies 139.\r\n  The last statement, one sufficiently probable in itself,\r\n  cannot be verified from any British source that I have found:\r\n  Wellington, annexed to the document on page 511 of vol. vi of\r\n  the _Dispatches_, gives the loss of Cole’s British brigades in\r\n  detail--they amount to twenty-five men only. But he does not\r\n  give details of Hervey’s Portuguese, though he mentions that the\r\n  brigadier was wounded, and that the two regiments (Nos. 11 and\r\n  23 of the Line) distinguished themselves. They may well have\r\n  lost the 124 men mentioned by Gachot, but I have no proof of\r\n  it. Vere’s usually accurate ‘Marches of the 4th Division’ gives\r\n  no figures for this day, nor does D’Urban’s _Diary_. Wellington\r\n  remarks that ‘the attack of this day on General Cole’s pickets\r\n  near Sobral was without much effect.’ It is certain, however,\r\n  that the British lost a little ground in front of the heights.\r\n  Martinien’s _Liste des officiers tués et blessés_, which I so\r\n  often find of use, shows that Junot’s corps lost two officers\r\n  killed and seven wounded. This, at the usual average, would imply\r\n  150-180 casualties.\r\n\r\nOn the same afternoon Reynier, with somewhat over a battalion of\r\ninfantry, made a detailed reconnaissance of Hill’s position in front\r\nof Alhandra. He pressed in close enough to draw the fire of the\r\nnearer redoubts, but halted when he had realized the strength of the\r\nline opposite him, and reported to Masséna that he considered the\r\nright wing of the allied position hopelessly impracticable for an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nNext morning (October 14) the French Commander-in-Chief came up in\r\nperson from the rear. It is astonishing that he had made no earlier\r\nattempt to judge with his own eye of the strength of Wellington’s\r\nline of defence. He arrived at Sobral in time to witness a bitter\r\nskirmish, the most important of all the engagements that took place\r\nduring the crucial days of the campaign of 1810. Spencer’s outposts,\r\nas has been already mentioned, had on the 12th retired only some 200\r\nor 300 yards from Sobral, and had taken up their position on the\r\nother side of the ravine that divides that village from the lower\r\nslopes of the Monte Agraça. Across the high-road the main picket,\r\nfurnished by the 71st regiment, had thrown up a barricade. Junot\r\nconsidered this lodgement, so close to his line, as a thing that\r\nought not to be permitted. Accordingly he brought up his artillery,\r\nwhich had only arrived from the rear on the previous night, to the\r\nfront of Sobral, and, after cannonading the barricade for a short\r\ntime, sent against it the _compagnies d’élite_ of the 19th of the\r\nLine, supported by other troops of Ménard’s brigade. The first rush\r\nof the attack carried the barricade and the line of stone walls on\r\neach side of it. But the whole of the 71st was ready to sustain the\r\npickets, and with a fierce rush swept the assailants back across\r\nthe barricade, down the slope, and into the outer houses of Sobral.\r\nFrom thence, of course, they had to retire, as a whole division was\r\nfronting them; but they resumed their old position without being\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nJunot refused to renew his attack, and Masséna, who had arrived\r\nwhile the skirmish was in progress, did not direct him to go forward\r\nagain. It was clear that there was a very strong force in front of\r\nthe 8th Corps, and that the redoubts visible along the Monte Agraça\r\non the one hand and the Portello heights on the other were of the\r\nmost formidable description. Masséna’s senior aide-de-camp and chief\r\nconfidant, Pelet[510], thus describes the psychological situation:\r\n‘On arriving at Sobral, instead of the “undulating accessible\r\nplateaux” that we had been told to expect, we saw steeply scarped\r\nmountains and deep ravines, a road-passage only a few paces broad,\r\nand on each side walls of rock crowned with everything that could\r\nbe accomplished in the way of field fortifications garnished with\r\nartillery; then at last it was plainly demonstrated to us that we\r\ncould not attack the Lines of Montechique with the 35,000 or 36,000\r\nmen[511] that still remained of the army. For, even if we had\r\nforced some point of the Lines, we should not have had enough men\r\nleft to seize and occupy Lisbon.... It was clear that we must wait\r\nfor reinforcements[512].’ Another eye-witness, Junot’s aide-de-camp\r\nDelagrave, in his _Memoir on the Campaign of 1810-11_, expresses\r\nthe same view in his single sentence, explaining that ‘the prince,\r\nseeing that the enemy was better prepared and stronger than had been\r\nbelieved, put an end to the combat, and on each side the troops\r\ntook up once more their original positions[513].’ The loss in this\r\ncombat--insignificant enough in itself, but decisive in that it\r\nrevealed to Masséna the uselessness of a further advance--was 67 on\r\nthe British side, about 120 on that of the French[514].\r\n\r\n  [510] For his position and character, see p. 209 of this volume.\r\n\r\n  [511] This figure is, of course, a ludicrous exaggeration.\r\n  Masséna had still more than 50,000 men. Even on Jan. 1, 1811,\r\n  after suffering two months more of untold privation, the Army of\r\n  Portugal was still 44,000 strong, plus sick and men detached.\r\n\r\n  [512] Pelet’s _Appendice sur la Guerre d’Espagne_, p. 323 of vol.\r\n  xxi of _Victoires et Conquêtes_.\r\n\r\n  [513] Delagrave, p. 100.\r\n\r\n  [514] Of the sixty-seven British casualties, thirty-eight were\r\n  in the 71st, the rest in the neighbouring brigades of the\r\n  1st Division. Noël--who had charge of the battery at Sobral,\r\n  estimates the French loss at 120--very probably the correct one,\r\n  as Martinien’s lists show one officer killed and six wounded,\r\n  all in Ménard’s brigade. This should mean 120-150 casualties.\r\n  Delagrave gives the higher figure of 200 killed and wounded,\r\n  probably an overstatement.\r\n\r\nAfter putting a stop to the combat of Sobral, Masséna rode away\r\neastward, along the slopes of the upland that faces the Monte Agraça,\r\nand as far as the knoll facing Arruda in the front of the Light\r\nDivision. Here he pressed so near the British front that a single\r\nshot was fired at his escort from the redoubt No. 120 to warn him to\r\ntrespass no further. He saluted the battery by lifting his hat to it,\r\nand went up the hill out of range[515]. Some of his aides-de-camp\r\ncontinued the exploration till they touched Reynier’s vedettes near\r\nVillafranca, but the Marshal himself returned to his head quarters at\r\nAlemquer to think over the situation. There some sort of a council of\r\nwar was held that same night: Junot, it is said, urged the Chief to\r\ntry the effect of a bold dash at the English army arrayed in front\r\nof Sobral. But he was talked down by Ney and Reynier, who argued\r\nthat such an attack would be insane, considering the weakness of\r\ntheir corps and the strength of Wellington’s fortifications. Without\r\ndoubt they were right: even if Masséna had brought his whole three\r\ncorps to bear on Sobral, he had 10,000 men less than at Bussaco,\r\nand Wellington 10,000 men more, leaving the garrisons of the forts\r\nout of the question. The allies had 30,000 bayonets concentrated on\r\nthe threatened point, and could have brought up Hill, Craufurd, and\r\nHamilton’s and Le Cor’s Portuguese--20,000 men more--from the east\r\nend of the Lines, the moment that it was clear that Reynier was no\r\nlonger in front of them. The position, owing to the forts, was far\r\nstronger than Bussaco, and the French cavalry would have been as\r\nuseless on October 15 as it had been on September 27. The report\r\nwhich Foy drew up for Masséna and presented to the Emperor gives the\r\nwhole gist of the matter: ‘The Marshal Prince of Essling has come to\r\nthe conclusion that he would compromise the army of His Majesty if\r\nhe were to attack in force lines so formidable, defended by 30,000\r\nEnglish and 30,000 Portuguese, aided by 50,000 armed peasants[516].’\r\n\r\n  [515] Masséna was clearly seen from the British Lines. Leith Hay,\r\n  a staff-officer of the 5th Division, noted ‘a crowd of officers\r\n  on horseback, dragoons with led horses, and all the cortége of\r\n  a general-in-chief’ (_Narrative_, p. 249), and saw the Marshal\r\n  dismount by the windmill above Sobral. He was watching from\r\n  Pack’s redoubt, on the hill just opposite, through his telescope,\r\n  about 2,000 yards from the French front. It is Jones who, on p.\r\n  40 of his _Lines of Torres Vedras_, gives the anecdote about the\r\n  Marshal’s salute.\r\n\r\n  [516] See Foy’s _Vie Militaire_, Appendix, p. 343.\r\n\r\nAn open assault on the Sobral position was now, indeed, the thing\r\nthat the British most desired. Wellington wrote, with his usual\r\nironical moderation, to his trusted lieutenant, Craufurd, that\r\n‘he thought his arrangements had now made the position tolerably\r\nsecure[517].’ Among these last arrangements, it may be remarked,\r\nwas the drawing back of the 71st and the light companies of the\r\n1st Division from the barricades on the near side of the ravine of\r\nSobral. They were moved a few hundred yards to the rear, nearer\r\nto Zibreira. This was probably intended to encourage the French\r\nto sally out from Sobral up the road, where everything was now in\r\norder to receive them. Their advance was hourly expected; D’Urban,\r\nBeresford’s Chief of the Staff, wrote gleefully on October 15, ‘Each\r\nindividual division has now more than sufficient troops to occupy the\r\nspace allotted to it, and the overplus forms a first reserve for each\r\nrespectively. If the force thus posted beats the attacking enemy, of\r\nwhich there can be little doubt, our telegraphic communications will\r\nbring down Craufurd from Arruda and Hill from Alhandra on to their\r\nflank--and the affair will be complete. There is much appearance that\r\nthe enemy _will_ attack this position with his whole force--Alhandra\r\nis far too strong for him. He cannot well retire, and it is hoped\r\nthat his distress for provisions will compel him to bring matters to\r\na speedy decision[518].’\r\n\r\n  [517] Wellington to Craufurd, _Dispatches_, vi. p. 517.\r\n\r\n  [518] D’Urban’s _Journal_, under Oct. 15.\r\n\r\nBut both the cautious Commander-in-Chief and the eager head of the\r\nPortuguese Staff were mistaken in estimating the position. They\r\nhad judged wrongly the character of Masséna, and his psychological\r\nposition of the moment. He would not attack; indeed, after October\r\n14 he seems never to have had the least intention of doing so. The\r\nlesson of Bussaco had not been lost, and he was no longer prepared\r\nto assail, with a light heart, the Anglo-Portuguese Army posted\r\nready to receive him in a strong position. Probably the energetic\r\nstatement of Ney and Reynier that they dared not risk their men--that\r\nthe troops would be demoralized if ordered to advance for a second\r\nslaughter--also had its effect on the Marshal. But Masséna was proud\r\nand obstinate, and if he could not go forward, he shrank, for the\r\nmoment, from going back. On October 15 began the one phase of the\r\ncampaign which the British, from general down to subaltern, had least\r\nexpected. The French army began to show signs of intending to settle\r\ndown in front of the Lines, as if for a blockade. After a few more\r\nattempts to feel the front of the Lines about Arruda and the valley\r\nof Calandriz, which were so feeble that they did not even drive in\r\nCraufurd’s outposts, the enemy began to fortify the front of his\r\nposition with field-works, and sent away the whole of his cavalry to\r\nthe rear--a sufficient sign that his offensive power was spent.\r\n\r\nMasséna’s first dream of masking the Lines by a close blockade was\r\nabsolutely impracticable, considering the present state of his\r\nsupplies. The troops were already living on the gleanings of the\r\nhastily-evacuated villages of the Lisbon Peninsula, which could not\r\nlast them for long, and would not even have sufficed for a week’s\r\nconsumption if Wellington’s decrees had been properly carried out. If\r\nhe was to feed his army from the thin resources left behind by the\r\nPortuguese, Masséna would soon find it necessary to spread it far\r\nand wide; since, if he kept it concentrated in front of Wellington,\r\nit would soon go to pieces, exposed in bivouacs to the November\r\nrains, and forced to draw its nourishment by marauding from afar. It\r\nseems from the instructions which he gave to Foy at the end of the\r\nsecond week of his stay in front of Lisbon, that the Marshal actually\r\ncontemplated clinging to his present advanced position till he should\r\nreceive reinforcements. He hoped that the 9th Corps would come up to\r\nhis aid from Old Castile, and that Mortier and the 5th Corps would\r\njoin him from Andalusia. But these were mere hypotheses: he was not\r\nin touch with either Drouet or Mortier. Indeed, he had been cut off\r\nfrom all communication with his colleagues since the day that he\r\ncrossed the Mondego. The 9th Corps, as a matter of fact, was only at\r\nValladolid, and showed no signs of moving on. Mortier had retired to\r\nthe mountains in front of Seville, after his successes over the army\r\nof La Romana in September. Almeida was in a state of close blockade\r\nby Silveira’s detachments from beyond the Douro. Ciudad Rodrigo was\r\nin hardly better case, being strictly watched by Julian Sanchez and\r\nhis mounted guerrilleros, so that no one could get to or from it\r\nwithout a very strong escort. Gardanne’s regiment of dragoons, left\r\nbehind by Masséna, was worn out in the effort to keep open the road\r\nbetween Rodrigo and Salamanca[519]. From the Army neither Almeida nor\r\nRodrigo received a word of news from the 18th of September to the\r\n15th of November. So effectually was the road closed, that rumours\r\nwere current of such divers characters as that Masséna had forced\r\nthe English to embark, and that he had been completely foiled, and\r\nwas marching back to Spain via Castello Branco. Paris was hardly\r\nbetter informed: the only news that the Emperor got was that dribbled\r\nout, four or five weeks later, by the English papers[520]. Hence\r\ncame ludicrous notices in the _Moniteur_, of which the worst was\r\none published on November 28, which stated that Coimbra had been\r\noccupied by Masséna without a battle, that the army on October 1\r\nhad only 200 sick and 500 wounded since it had left Almeida, and\r\nthat no general or colonel had been killed or even hurt since the\r\ninvasion began! And this after twelve such officers had fallen at\r\nBussaco. That battle, we may remark, was presented ultimately to\r\nFrench readers as ‘a demonstration executed by the brigades of Simon\r\nand Graindorge in order to mask the great flank-march of the Prince\r\nof Essling. But they had gone beyond their instructions, and brought\r\non a combat in which 200 men had been killed and 1,200 wounded.’\r\nFririon, the historian of the campaign, cannot restrain himself from\r\nadding, ‘This is how history was written at that time; it was by\r\nreports of this lying description that an attempt was made to calm\r\nanxious families. Did no one reflect that, by deceiving them in this\r\nway, the government made enemies of all those who trusted for a time\r\nin the exactitude of the _Bulletins_, and lost their illusion soon\r\nafter, when they learnt the melancholy ends of their sons and their\r\nbrothers[521]?’\r\n\r\n  [519] For the miseries and dangers of life in Rodrigo, see the\r\n  _Memoirs_ of the Duchesse d’Abrantes. Her letter to Junot,\r\n  intercepted by Wellington, tells the same tale: it is to be found\r\n  in D’Urban’s collection of documents.\r\n\r\n  [520] See _Correspondance_, vol. xxi. pp. 262, 280, 338, &c.\r\n\r\n  [521] See Fririon, pp. 57-8.\r\n\r\nThe dearth of news from the front was not Masséna’s own fault. He\r\nhad sent back several aides-de-camp to find their way to Almeida,\r\nbut all had either been captured by the Ordenança or forced to turn\r\nback. The best known of these was the young Mascarenhas, one of the\r\nPortuguese traitors on the Marshal’s staff. He started from Coimbra\r\non October 3, with the Bussaco dispatch, disguised as a shepherd, but\r\nwas detected by a band of Ordenança, and sent as prisoner to Lisbon.\r\nThe Regency had him tried by court-martial, and as he was caught\r\nwithout a uniform, he was condemned as a spy as well as a traitor,\r\nand executed by the garotte in December[522].\r\n\r\n  [522] See above, p. 277.\r\n\r\nThere was a perfect cordon of Portuguese militia and irregulars\r\nround Masséna’s rear in October and November. J. Wilson had come\r\ndown to Espinhal, and had his outposts in Leiria; Trant had returned\r\nto Coimbra. They were in touch, by means of the Estrada Nova and\r\nthe garrison of Abrantes, with the Ordenança of Castello Branco,\r\nand a Spanish detachment of three battalions under Carlos d’España,\r\nwhich La Romana had sent to Villa Velha, at the same time that he\r\ntook his two divisions under La Carrera and Charles O’Donnell within\r\nthe Lines. On the side of the Atlantic the garrison of Peniche had\r\nsent out a force of 300 men to Obidos, under Captain Fenwick, and\r\nthese joined hands with De Gray’s cavalry at Ramalhal, in front of\r\nTorres Vedras. A few French parties which crossed the Monte Junta\r\nto raid towards the sea coast were cut off either by Fenwick or by\r\nthe dragoons. But Masséna never sent any serious detachment in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFor just one month (October 14-November 14) Masséna maintained\r\nhis position in front of the Lines. The 8th Corps had thrown up\r\nsome earthworks on, and to the flanks of, the hill of Sobral, thus\r\nassuming a defensive instead of an offensive position. The 2nd Corps\r\nwent back to Carregado, but left strong detachments in Villafranca.\r\nBy the dispositions of October 16 the 6th Corps remained with\r\nits main body at Otta, far to the rear, and an advanced guard at\r\nAlemquer. Ney was so placed that he could succour either of the other\r\ncorps if they were attacked. A brigade of Loison’s division was\r\npushed forward to the hill opposite Arruda[523]: in face of this last\r\nCraufurd was adorning the front of his line with a luxury of abattis,\r\nentanglements, and pitfalls, which would have made the hillside\r\ninaccessible to even the most alert and vigorous person moving alone.\r\nFormed troops could not have got past the first two or three traps.\r\n\r\n  [523] Ferey’s brigade, which had already faced Craufurd at\r\n  Bussaco.\r\n\r\nBut the most significant part of Masséna’s arrangements was to\r\nbe found in his rear: Montbrun’s cavalry reserve went back to\r\nSantarem; thither also went the reserve artillery on the 17th, and\r\nthe hospitals on the 20th of October. At the same time each of the\r\ncorps was directed to send to Santarem all smiths, carpenters, and\r\nother artificers that could be found in its ranks. They were told to\r\nreport to General Eblé, the officer commanding the artillery, who\r\nhad received from the Marshal a special mission--the construction of\r\nboats and pontoons sufficient to bridge the Tagus or the Zezere. For,\r\nif he were starved out in Estremadura, Masséna had it in his mind\r\nthat he might find it convenient either to cross into the Alemtejo,\r\nor to force a way across the Zezere into the Castello Branco\r\ndistrict, in the hope of opening communication with Spain via Zarza\r\nand Alcantara. Montbrun’s cavalry explored northward and eastward,\r\nseeking for likely spots at which the Tagus might be bridged, and on\r\nthe other side reconnoitring the line of the Zezere, to see how it\r\nwas held. Not a boat could be found on the greater river; at Chamusca\r\na daring party of fifty men swam its broad current, for a dash at\r\nsome barks which were visible on the other side, but all were found\r\nto have had their bottoms carefully knocked out and to be filled\r\nwith sand. Dejean, the officer who explored as far as Punhete on the\r\nZezere, found all the bridges broken, and the garrison of Abrantes\r\nwatching the fords, with strong detachments at Punhete and Martinchel.\r\n\r\nEblé found at Santarem that he had to create a pontoon equipage with\r\nno materials at all to work from. There was raw iron in the bars and\r\nbalconies of houses, and raw timber in their floors and rafters, but\r\nnothing else. His smiths had to start on the weary task of forging\r\nsaws and hammers, his carpenters had to turn housebreakers--in the\r\ntechnical sense--to obtain planks and joists. His task was hard,\r\nand would clearly take many weeks before it could be properly\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile time was all-important to Masséna, for every day the\r\ncountry between Santarem and the Lines grew barer and yet more bare,\r\nas the foragers of the three French corps worked their will upon it.\r\nThe men were already going into hospital by thousands, and dying\r\nthere. Junot’s conscript battalions, unsheltered from the rain in\r\ntheir bleak bivouac above Sobral, suffered most--Ney’s and Reynier’s\r\nmen were (for the most part) housed if not fed. The Army, which had\r\n65,000 men on leaving Almeida, and 55,000 after the loss of Coimbra,\r\nhad dwindled down to 50,000 effective sabres and bayonets by the\r\nmonth of November[524].\r\n\r\n  [524] According to _Fririon_, p. 98, the morning state of Nov. 1\r\n  showed only 46,591 men effective. But the figures of that officer\r\n  are always a little lower than what I have found in the official\r\n  documents.\r\n\r\nWellington was already pondering on the possibility of taking the\r\noffensive. He had received hundreds of deserters during the last\r\nfew weeks[525], and knew by their means of the miserable condition\r\nof the enemy--of the fact that the cavalry had nearly all been sent\r\nto the rear, and of the attempt that was being made to create a\r\nbridge-equipage at Santarem[526]. His dispatches of October 27 and\r\nNovember 3 to Lord Liverpool treat at length of the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of assailing the French in their present position[527].\r\nHe sets forth the strength of his own army--29,000 British troops\r\npresent with the colours, after deducting sick and men detached,\r\n24,000 Portuguese effective, and 5,000 of La Romana’s Spaniards,\r\nmaking a total of 58,615. He refuses to contemplate the use of the\r\nmilitia, infantry or artillery, in the field; considering their\r\nbehaviour at Bussaco and elsewhere, ‘I should deceive myself if I\r\ncould expect, or your Lordship if I should state, that any advantage\r\nwould be derived from their assistance in an offensive operation\r\nagainst the enemy.’ On the other hand, he estimates Masséna’s\r\nfighting force at 55,000 men--a slight miscalculation, for there\r\nwere only 50,000 effective at this moment, and of these 4,000\r\ncavalry and one brigade of infantry were at Santarem and other\r\ndistant places, from which they could not have been withdrawn for a\r\nbattle suddenly forced upon their main corps. Masséna could really\r\nhave put no more than 44,000 men in line within twenty-four hours\r\nof an alarm. Wellington then proceeds to argue that he must make a\r\nfrontal attack, for if he drew a very large force out of the Lines,\r\nin order to assail the enemy’s flank by a wide encircling march,\r\n‘the inevitable consequence of attempting such a manœuvre would be\r\nto open some one or other of the great roads to Lisbon, and to our\r\nshipping, of which the enemy would take immediate advantage to attain\r\nhis object.’ Accordingly ‘we must carry their positions by main\r\nforce, and in the course of the operation I must draw the army out\r\nof their cantonments, and expose men and horses to the inclemencies\r\nof the weather at this time of the year.’ Moreover, if Masséna were\r\ndefeated, it would cause Soult to evacuate Granada, raise the siege\r\nof Cadiz, and come with 50,000 men to aid the army of Portugal.\r\n‘So if I should succeed in forcing Masséna’s positions, it would\r\nbecome a question whether I should be able to maintain my own, in\r\ncase the enemy should march another army into this country.’ Blake\r\nand the garrison of Cadiz, when freed from Soult’s presence, would\r\ncertainly do nothing to help the general cause of the Allies. They\r\nwould neither come to Portugal, nor be able to make a serious advance\r\non Madrid, so as to draw off Soult in that direction. He therefore\r\nconcludes, that ‘When I observe how small the superiority of numbers\r\nis in my favour, and know that the position will be in favour of the\r\nenemy, I am of opinion that I act in conformity with the intentions\r\nof His Majesty’s Government in waiting for the result of what is\r\ngoing on, and in incurring no extraordinary risk.’ What he calls\r\n‘the safe game’ is to keep on the strict defensive, hoping that the\r\nenemy’s distress for provisions, and the operations of the militia\r\nin his rear, may cause him either to make a desperate attack on the\r\nLines--in which he will be repulsed with awful loss--or else to make\r\nsuch large detachments, to clear off the corps of Wilson, Trant, and\r\nthe rest, that it will become easy and safe to attack the remaining\r\narmy in its present position.\r\n\r\n  [525] The first morning note of D’Urban’s diary in November is\r\n  nearly always ‘more deserters arrived.’\r\n\r\n  [526] See Wellington to Lord Liverpool, _Dispatches_, vi. 554.\r\n\r\n  [527] See especially the longer dispatch of Nov. 3, on pp. 582-3\r\n  ibid.\r\n\r\nHere, as when we considered the reasons which determined Wellington\r\nto evacuate the Coimbra country at the end of September, we are\r\nbound to recognize that he adopted an attitude of caution which he\r\nwould not have assumed in 1812 and 1813, when he had thoroughly\r\nproved his army. The temptations to assail Junot’s isolated and\r\nadvanced position at Sobral were enormous. The 8th Corps had been\r\nthrust forward into a re-entering angle of the British lines, in\r\nwhich it could be attacked from the left flank as well as from\r\nthe front. It was wasting away daily from its privations, and had\r\napparently not more than 10,000 bayonets left--the cavalry of the\r\ncorps (Sainte-Croix’s old division) had been sent off to Santarem,\r\nsave one regiment. To sustain Junot the 6th Corps could eventually\r\nbe used, but only one brigade of it (that of Ferey) was in the first\r\nline, and this depleted unit, which had been so thoroughly routed\r\nat Bussaco, had its old enemy, Craufurd’s Light Division, in its\r\nfront. Of the rest of the 6th Corps, one division was at Alemquer,\r\neleven miles behind Sobral, the other at Otta, six miles behind\r\nAlemquer[528]. It would have taken the one four or five hours, the\r\nother nearly the whole of a short November day, to assemble and to\r\ncome up. Reynier could not quit Hill’s front without freeing the\r\nlatter’s two strong divisions for action. Meanwhile Wellington had\r\ndisposable, in Junot’s immediate front, the divisions of Spencer,\r\nCole, Leith, and Alex. Campbell [Picton had been sent back to Torres\r\nVedras], plus the Portuguese brigades of Pack, Coleman, and A.\r\nCampbell, with La Romana’s Spaniards also, if he should choose to\r\nemploy them--this, too, after leaving Craufurd to look after Ferey,\r\nand Hill to keep Reynier in check. It is impossible not to conclude\r\nthat a sudden frontal and flank attack on Sobral with 30,000 men\r\nmust have enveloped and crushed the 8th Corps. Though its position\r\nwas good, its supports were too far off; Ney could not have come up\r\nto Junot’s aid, before he was overwhelmed. Masséna was uneasy about\r\nthis possibility of disaster, and had issued orders on October 29\r\nthat if Junot and Ferey were attacked, they were to fall back on\r\nAlemquer, while Ney was to bring up his reserves to that same place,\r\nand Reynier to abandon his position in front of Alhandra and march\r\non Alemquer also[529]. But the weak point of this arrangement was,\r\nthat if Junot had been attacked at dawn, both in front and flank, by\r\nan overwhelming force, he could never have got back to Alemquer, and\r\nmust have been cut off and battered to pieces close in the rear of\r\nSobral. The English frontal attack--Spencer, Leith, and Pack--would\r\nhave started at a distance of less than a mile from his position:\r\nCole and Campbell on the flank had only two miles to cover. Both\r\ncolumns had a down-hill march before them till the line of rising\r\nground about Sobral was reached. How could the 8th Corps have got\r\naway? Even an orderly retreat, with a fighting rearguard, would have\r\nbeen impossible.\r\n\r\n  [528] Loison, to whom Ferey’s brigade belonged, had gone to the\r\n  rear with his other brigade.\r\n\r\n  [529] The whole dispatch may be found in Fririon, pp. 96-7. That\r\n  officer quite saw the danger of the position: see his comments on\r\n  pp. 99-100.\r\n\r\nBut if Junot’s 10,000 men had been destroyed behind Sobral,\r\nWellington would then have been in the position to push in between\r\nNey and Reynier, whose columns would just have been beginning to\r\nnear Alemquer. He might easily have driven them apart, and have\r\nforced them to retire on Santarem or some such distant point, in\r\norder to complete their junction. Even had they succeeded in joining,\r\nMasséna would have had a demoralized army of little over 30,000 men\r\nremaining. It is certain that he must have refused to fight, and have\r\nstarted on a disastrous retreat either by Castello Branco, or more\r\nlikely by Thomar. For the latter direction would have brought him\r\nto his base at Almeida--the former would have taken him through an\r\nalmost uninhabited country, to a part of Spain, the mid-Tagus, where\r\nno French army was ready to receive or succour him.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, therefore, to doubt that Wellington had a great\r\nopportunity before him. Yet it is easy to see why he refused to take\r\nit. A mere victory of the second class--the thrusting of Junot out of\r\nhis positions, not followed by the complete annihilation of the 8th\r\nCorps--would have done no more for him than he himself stated in the\r\nabove-quoted dispatch of November 3. If Junot got away with the main\r\nbody of his troops, and joined Ney and Reynier, and if their united\r\narmy took up a defensive position at Santarem or elsewhere, Masséna\r\nmight still hang on to Portugal, till Soult brought up to his aid\r\nthe whole Army of Andalusia, or great reinforcements arrived from\r\nCastile. Any chance--a fog, heavy rain, the rashness or stupidity\r\nof some subordinate--might prevent the complete and instantaneous\r\nsuccess of the attack on Sobral. These things being taken into\r\nconsideration, Wellington resolved to lie still in the Lines, and to\r\nlet the weapon of starvation play for some time longer on the French.\r\nHe expected them to retire within a few days from sheer necessity, or\r\nelse to deliver the much desired attack on his impregnable position.\r\n\r\nMasséna had found that the preparation of his bridge equipage at\r\nSantarem would be a long business. He knew that his numbers were\r\nshrinking every day in the most appalling fashion, not only from\r\ndeaths and invaliding, but from desertion. Yet he stood still for\r\na fortnight longer than his adversary had expected, and meanwhile\r\nmade a last desperate appeal for help to the Emperor. He had guessed\r\nthat all his previous attempts to communicate with Spain had failed\r\nbecause his messengers had been sent without a sufficient escort, and\r\nhad fallen by the way. Accordingly, he told off a body of more than\r\n500 men to bear his next letter, and gave the command of them to an\r\nofficer of well-known intelligence and resource--Foy, who had served\r\nin all the three Portuguese campaigns, Junot’s of 1808, Soult’s of\r\n1809, and this last of his own. Moreover, it was known that Napoleon\r\nhad confidence in his ability, though he was an old Republican, and\r\nhad actually been one of the few who had refused to sign the address\r\nwhich was drawn up to ask the First Consul to declare himself Emperor\r\nin 1804. Foy was given a whole battalion of infantry--the 4th of the\r\n47th of the Line--with 120 mounted men. He was told to avoid the main\r\nroads, to cross the Zezere, pass north of Castello Branco, and to try\r\nto reach Spain by way of Sabugal or Penamacor. This was obviously a\r\ndifficult task, since the Ordenança were known to be abroad, even\r\nin this rugged and deserted region. To cover Foy’s start, Montbrun\r\nmarched, with a brigade of dragoons and a couple of battalions of\r\ninfantry, to make a demonstration against Abrantes, and draw the\r\nattention of its garrison from the upper Zezere. Montbrun forced\r\nthe passage of the river at Punhete, after a sharp skirmish, and\r\nestablished his vanguard on the further side. He thus attracted to\r\nhimself all the forces which Lobo, the governor of Abrantes, could\r\nspare outside his walls. Meanwhile (October 31) Foy passed the Zezere\r\nhigher up, at an unguarded ford, and marched by Cardigos and Sobreira\r\nFormosa along the Castello Branco road. But he abandoned it before\r\nreaching that town, and turned north, crossing the Serra de Moradal\r\nby Fundão and Belmonte. From thence he reached Sabugal, and finally\r\nCiudad Rodrigo on November 8. He had been unmolested save by a body\r\nof Ordenança, who cut off some of his stragglers. The passage of\r\nhis column, whose strength was exaggerated by rumour, caused Carlos\r\nd’España to burn the bridge of Villa Velha, under the impression that\r\nFoy intended to seize it, and open up communication southward with\r\nSoult. He and Lobo reported to Wellington that Foy and Montbrun were\r\nthe van of a great force, which was about to overrun and occupy the\r\nCastello Branco country[530]. But Masséna’s messenger had no other\r\nobject than to reach Castile with as great rapidity as possible, and\r\nwithout fighting.\r\n\r\n  [530] Wellington also, on Lobo’s report, thought (_Dispatches_,\r\n  vi. 604) that Foy’s and Montbrun’s object had been to seize the\r\n  bridge of Villa Velha.\r\n\r\nArrived at Rodrigo, Foy gave over his escort to General Gardanne,\r\nwith orders to him to collect all the convalescents of the Army of\r\nPortugal, and to draw out the garrison of Rodrigo and Almeida, if\r\nDrouet was now in condition to take charge of these fortresses. This\r\nshould give him a force of 6,000 men, with which he was ordered to\r\ncut his way to join the main army, to whom he was to bring a convoy\r\nof ammunition, which was running desperately low at the front. How\r\nbadly Gardanne executed his charge we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nFoy meanwhile, with a fresh dragoon escort, rode for Salamanca and\r\nValladolid, at which last place he was disgusted to find Drouet\r\nand the bulk of the 9th Corps, whom he had expected to meet at\r\nRodrigo[531]. He met the general, and passed on to him Masséna’s\r\nrequest that he would collect the whole of his 16,000 men, and march\r\non Almeida, and from thence down the Mondego to Coimbra, after which\r\nhe was to open up communication with the main army by Leiria or\r\nThomar. Drouet, assuming some of the airs of a commander-in-chief,\r\ndid not show the eagerness to carry out these directions which Foy\r\nhad hoped to find.\r\n\r\n  [531] Only part of Claparéde’s division had as yet even reached\r\n  Salamanca. Foy to Masséna, Nov. 8, from Rodrigo.\r\n\r\nFrom Valladolid Foy rode straight through by post, braving guerrilla\r\nbands and swollen rivers, through Burgos and Bayonne to Paris,\r\nwhich he reached on the night of November 21. On the next day he\r\ndelivered his dispatches to the Emperor, and was put through two\r\nhours of sharp cross-questioning by his master. The notes of this\r\nconversation, taken down the same afternoon by the general, are\r\none of the most interesting documents for the study of Napoleon’s\r\npsychology. Striding up and down his study, pouring out strings of\r\nqueries, rapid judgements, rebukes and laudations, even anecdotes and\r\nscreeds of political philosophy, the Emperor presented a wonderful\r\npicture of restless and far-reaching intellectual activity. Foy put\r\nin his excuses and explanations in the gaps of the Emperor’s tirades.\r\n‘Why the devil did Masséna thrust himself into that muddle[532]\r\nat Bussaco? Even in a plain country columns do not break through\r\nlines, unless they are supported by a superior artillery fire.’ ‘And\r\nthe disgrace at Coimbra, where he has let his hospitals be taken\r\nby 1,500 ragged rascals! To lose your hospitals is as disgraceful\r\nas to lose your flags! In a regularly organized country--England,\r\nfor example--Masséna would have gone to the scaffold for that job.\r\nThe English are full of courage and honour: they defend themselves\r\nwell. Masséna and Ney did not know them, but Reynier, whom they had\r\nbeaten twice or thrice [Alexandria and Maida], ought to know them!\r\nWellington has behaved like a clever man: his total desolation of the\r\nkingdom of Portugal is the result of systematic measures splendidly\r\nconcerted. I could not do that myself, for all my power. Why did not\r\nMasséna stop at Coimbra, after Bussaco?’ ‘Because,’ faltered Foy,\r\n‘supposing he had done so, Your Majesty would have reproached him\r\nby saying “If you had only pushed straight on Lisbon the English\r\nwould have embarked.”’ ‘Very possible, indeed,’ replied the Emperor,\r\nbreaking into a broad smile. ‘Well, I wanted to drive them into the\r\nsea: I have failed. All right; then I will have a regular campaign\r\nin Portugal, and use them up. I can wear them down in the nature of\r\nthings, because England cannot compete in mere numbers with me.’ Then\r\nfollowed an excursus into the characters of French generals--Junot,\r\nNey, Soult especially. Then a curious confession that he had made a\r\nmiscalculation in taking up the Spanish war: ‘I thought the system\r\neasier to change than it has proved in that country, with its corrupt\r\nminister, its feeble king, and its shameless, dissolute queen. But\r\nfor all that, I don’t repent of what I did; I had to smash up that\r\nnation: sooner or later they would have done me a bad turn.’\r\n\r\n  [532] échauffourée.\r\n\r\nThen comes the Emperor’s conclusion upon the present state of\r\naffairs. ‘Masséna must take Abrantes--Elvas would be of no good to\r\nus. The only way to get Wellington to make a forward move will be to\r\nforce him to try to raise the siege of Abrantes. As long as Masséna\r\nstays in position opposite Lisbon, nothing is lost; he is still a\r\nterror to the English, and keeps the offensive. If he retreats, I\r\nfear great disaster for him. But why did he not take up some regular\r\nplan of operations? The very day after he reconnoitred the Lisbon\r\nlines, it was clear that he would never attack them. I will send\r\nimmediate orders for the 5th Corps [Mortier] to invade the Alemtejo.\r\nWill they be obeyed? At that distance only those who choose carry out\r\nmy directions. [A hint at Soult’s selfish policy.] I tremble lest\r\nMasséna may call Drouet down to him, and then get his communications\r\ncut again. By communications I mean sure points, at two or three\r\nmarches distance, properly garrisoned and provisioned, where convoys\r\ncan rest and be safe. An army without open communications loses heart\r\nand gets demoralized.... All the hope of the English is in that army\r\nof Wellington’s! If we could destroy it, it would be a terrible blow\r\nto them.’\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, pleased with Foy’s intelligent explanations of the\r\nsituation, created him a general of division, and told him to\r\nrest for a month, and then return to Portugal. He sent for him to\r\nadminister a second catechism on the 24th, and then condescended to\r\nexplain his view of the situation, and his orders for the future.\r\nHe quite approved of Masséna’s resolve to hold out in front of the\r\nLines, and had already given Drouet directions to assemble his corps\r\nat Almeida, and open up communications with the Army of Portugal--in\r\nfact, the order to do so had been sent off as early as November 3,\r\nand its bearer must have crossed Foy somewhere on the road[533].\r\nSoult had also been ordered, two days before Masséna’s appeal\r\ncame to hand, to create a diversion in the direction of Spanish\r\nEstremadura[534]. He was now sent a sharp reproof for having done\r\nnothing, and more especially for having allowed La Romana to slip\r\naway with two divisions to Lisbon unmolested[535]. But it seems clear\r\nthat no orders to concentrate his whole army and invade the Alemtejo\r\nwere sent him, and these were the only measures that could have\r\nhelped Masséna. Napoleon’s _obiter dictum_ that it would be no use to\r\nbesiege and capture Elvas shows a misapprehension of the situation. A\r\nmere demonstration in Spanish Estremadura might call back La Romana,\r\nbut would not help the Army of Portugal to any appreciable extent. It\r\nwas not La Romana’s 8,000 men who formed the strength of the defence\r\nof Lisbon. Wellington could have spared them without harm, and,\r\nindeed, sent them away long before Masséna quitted Portugal.\r\n\r\n  [533] This is the order in _Correspondance_, 17,097. It goes on\r\n  to give Drouet detailed orders as to what he should do ‘aussitôt\r\n  que les Anglais seront rembarqués.’\r\n\r\n  [534] This had been sent off the day before Foy arrived, Nov. 20,\r\n  it is _Correspondance_, 17,146.\r\n\r\n  [535] _Correspondance_, 17,172, dated Nov. 28.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that (as facts were to show ere long) the mere\r\nsending up of Drouet to the front was not nearly sufficient to put\r\nMasséna in a position to incommode Wellington, more especially when\r\nthe 9th Corps was told to drop detachments at short intervals at\r\nevery stage after Almeida. By following these orders, indeed, Drouet\r\nbrought to the main army a mere 6,000 men on December 26, having\r\nleft the rest of his corps beyond the Mondego. His arrival was of\r\nabsolutely no use to the Prince of Essling. The one thing which could\r\nhave saved Masséna was the arrival, not of a small field force such\r\nas Drouet or Mortier commanded, but of a large army, on the Lower\r\nTagus, and on its southern side. Such an army, as the disposition of\r\nthe French troops in Spain then stood, could only have been produced\r\nif Soult had consented to abandon Granada, raise the siege of Cadiz,\r\nand march with the greater part of the Army of Andalusia into the\r\nAlemtejo, masking Badajoz and Elvas, and leaving a division or two\r\nin Seville to keep Blake and the Spanish troops from Cadiz in check.\r\nBut the Duke of Dalmatia could never be induced to abandon two-thirds\r\nof his Andalusian viceroyalty, in order to execute a movement whose\r\nresults, if successful, would mainly redound to the glory of Masséna.\r\nNothing short of a definite and peremptory order from Paris would\r\nhave made him call in Victor and Sebastiani, and evacuate Eastern\r\nand Southern Andalusia. Such an order the Emperor did not send. His\r\ndispatch of Dec. 4 only ordered that a corps of 10,000 men should\r\nadvance to the Tagus in the direction of Villa Velha and Montalvão,\r\nto communicate with Masséna[536]. Soult undertook instead a blow at\r\nBadajoz, in January, with a force of 20,000 men, while leaving Cadiz\r\nstill blockaded and Granada still held. Napoleon, therefore, must\r\ntake the blame of the final failure of the invasion of Portugal.\r\nAs has been shown above, from his own words, he was conscious that\r\nhe was too far from the scene of operation, and that mere ordinary\r\ndirections to his lieutenants might not be carried out with zeal. ‘Je\r\ndonne l’ordre. L’exécutera-t-on? De si loin obéit qui veut[537].’\r\nBut if this were so, it was surely necessary either that he should go\r\nto Spain in person, or else--the more obvious alternative--that he\r\nshould appoint a real Commander-in-Chief in the Peninsula, who should\r\nhave authority to order all the other marshals and generals to obey\r\nhis directions, without malingering or appeals to Paris. Napoleon had\r\ndeliberately created a divided authority beyond the Pyrenees when he\r\nset up his military governments, and instructed Suchet, Kellermann,\r\nand the other governors to report directly to himself, and to pay no\r\nattention to commands emanating from Madrid[538]. King Joseph, as\r\na central source of orders, had been reduced to a nullity by this\r\nill-conceived decree. Even over the troops not included in the new\r\nviceroyalties he had no practical authority. Not he and his chief of\r\nthe staff, but Masséna, ought to have been entrusted with a full and\r\nautocratic power of command over all the armies of Spain, if a true\r\nunity of purpose was to be achieved.\r\n\r\n  [536] Berthier to Soult, Dec. 4, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [537] See above, p. 458.\r\n\r\n  [538] See pp. 201 and 284 above.\r\n\r\nThis necessary arrangement the Emperor utterly refused to carry out:\r\nhe sent rebukes to Drouet for hesitating to obey the orders of the\r\nPrince of Essling, and he jested at the absurd conduct of Ney and\r\nJunot in conducting themselves like independent generals[539]. But\r\nthese officers were in command of troops definitely allotted to the\r\nArmy of Portugal. Over the other generals of Spain he refused to\r\nallow Masséna any control, and he continued to send them his own\r\never-tardy instructions, which had often ceased to be appropriate\r\nlong before the dispatch had reached its destination. If we seek the\r\nreasons of this unwise persistence in his old methods, we find that\r\nthey were two. The first was his secret, but only half-disguised,\r\nintention to annex all the Spanish provinces north of the Ebro to\r\nFrance, an insane resolve which led him to keep Suchet and Macdonald\r\nin Aragon and Catalonia, as well as the governors of Navarre and\r\nBiscay, out of the control of any central authority that he might\r\nset up in Spain. The second was his jealousy of entrusting the vast\r\narmy south of the Ebro, far more than 250,000 men at the moment,\r\nto any single commander. He remembered Soult’s absurd strivings\r\nafter royalty in Portugal; he knew that Masséna, though the best of\r\nsoldiers, was false, selfish, and ambitious; and he refused to hand\r\nover to either of them a full control over the whole of the forces in\r\nthe Peninsula. It was even better, in his estimation, to leave King\r\nJoseph a shadow of power, than to take the risk of giving overmuch\r\nauthority to one of the two able, but not wholly trustworthy,\r\nmarshals to whom he must otherwise have entrusted it.\r\n\r\n  [539] See the above-quoted conversation with Foy, in the latter’s\r\n  _Vie Militaire_, p. 109.\r\n\r\nThe war in Portugal, therefore, went on as a mere section of the\r\ngreat contest in the Peninsula; the other and less important episodes\r\nwere not made wholly subordinate to it. And if this system continued\r\nWellington was free from any real danger. He knew it himself; he\r\nstudied diligently both the political position and the details of the\r\nemplacement of the imperial armies in the Peninsula. He was fortunate\r\nenough to secure whole budgets of French dispatches captured by the\r\nOrdenança[540], and all that he read confirmed him in his conclusion.\r\n‘I calculate,’ he writes on October 27, ‘that a reinforcement of\r\n15,000 men would not now give the enemy so good an army as they had\r\nat Bussaco. He lost 2,000 killed or taken there: Trant took 5,000\r\nat Coimbra: above 1,000 prisoners have gone through this army: many\r\nhave been killed by the peasantry. They cannot have less than 4,000\r\nsick[541], after the march they have made, and the weather to which\r\nthey are exposed. The deserters tell us that almost every one is\r\nsick. From this statement you may judge of the diminution of their\r\nnumbers; and you will see that I have not much reason to apprehend\r\nanything from [Drouet’s] “_quinze beaux bataillons_ which fought\r\nat Essling”[542], and which cannot be here before the middle of\r\nNovember. I do not think I have much to apprehend even if Mortier is\r\nadded to them. However, we shall see how _that_ will be.... All the\r\naccounts which I receive of the distresses of the enemy for want of\r\nprovisions would tend to a belief that their army cannot remain long\r\nin the position in which it is placed, and it is astonishing that\r\nthey have been able to remain here so long as this[543].’ That they\r\nhave succeeded in staying even a fortnight in front of the Lines is,\r\nhe adds, entirely the fault of the Portuguese government, for not\r\ncarrying out thoroughly the work of devastation. But, for the reasons\r\nstated on an earlier page, Wellington was resolved not to take the\r\noffensive, even against a foe whose ranks were beginning to grow\r\nthin. Famine should do the work, and no lives should be wasted.\r\n\r\n  [540] See for example those noted in _Dispatches_, vi. 545, and\r\n  a whole series copied out in D’Urban’s journal in October and\r\n  November, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [541] A most modest estimate, for the returns of sick for the\r\n  second half of October in a document at the _Archives de la\r\n  Guerre_ give a total of 10,897 men in hospital.\r\n\r\n  [542] An allusion to a phrase in one of the captured dispatches.\r\n\r\n  [543] Wellington to Liverpool, October 27, pp. 545 and 555 of\r\n  vol. vi.\r\n\r\nThere remained only one danger: it was just possible that Soult,\r\neven though Masséna had not yet suffered any disaster great enough\r\nto make the evacuation of Eastern Andalusia imperative, might\r\nsend Mortier and some additional divisions of his other corps to\r\nSpanish Estremadura, and make a dash at the Lower Tagus. Masséna’s\r\nboat-building at Santarem, of which every deserter spoke, might\r\nbe intended to give him the materials for a bridge by which he\r\nmight communicate across the Lower Tagus with Soult. Wellington\r\naccordingly resolved to keep a strict watch beyond the Tagus, and\r\nto have a flying force ready, which could hinder the construction\r\nof a bridge or a bridge head. With this object on November 2 he\r\nsent over the Tagus General Fane, with his 1,500 Portuguese horse,\r\na battalion of Caçadores, and a few guns. All the North Alemtejo\r\nOrdenança were called out to watch the river banks, and to lend what\r\nsmall assistance they could to the cavalry. Fane discovered the\r\nFrench dockyard at Santarem, and tried to fire it with rockets on\r\nNovember 13. He failed, but the mere appearance of his little force\r\non the further bank of the Tagus had some good effect, since it\r\nwarned Masséna that an attempt to pass the broad river would not be\r\nunopposed, and therefore made him more chary of attempting it. Fane,\r\nbeing in touch with Abrantes on his right hand and with Lisbon on\r\nhis left, now formed, as it were, a section of the blockading screen\r\nwhich was thrown round the whole French army.\r\n\r\nWellington had miscalculated the time which the French could afford\r\nto spend in front of the Lines, without suffering actual starvation,\r\nby about a fortnight. On November 10 Masséna gave orders for the\r\nevacuation of his whole position, and a general retreat on Santarem,\r\nbecause it had become absolutely impossible to stay any longer on the\r\nground facing Zibreira and Alhandra, unless the whole army was to\r\nperish. The report from the 8th Corps may suffice to give in a few\r\nwords the condition of affairs, ‘General Clausel wishes to observe\r\nthat during the daytime he cannot count on any other troops save\r\nthose actually guarding the outpost line. The majority of the men are\r\nabsent on raids to the rear, to seek for maize and cattle. The last\r\ndetachment which came back to camp had been nine days away. Generals\r\nand soldiers agree in stating that for some time it has only been\r\npossible to collect a little corn with extreme difficulty. For eight\r\ndays the troops have been living on polenta (boiled maize flour)\r\nalone, and of this they have received only half a ration. During\r\nthe last four days the 1st Division has received only one ration of\r\nmeat, which amounted to six ounces of goat’s-flesh. If the corps had\r\nto make a retreat, it would have to abandon its sick and wounded for\r\nwant of carts, which the intendant-generals will not furnish[544].’\r\nThe condition of the 2nd and 6th Corps was only so far better that\r\nthey had to send their foragers a less distance, when seeking for the\r\nscanty store which could still be gleaned from the hidden granaries\r\nof the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n  [544] Fririon’s confidential report to Masséna, night of 8th-9th\r\n  of November.\r\n\r\nBut Masséna had no intention of retiring on Spain when he began to\r\nissue orders for a general movement to the rear. Profoundly sensible\r\nof the difficulties of a November retreat through the mountains,\r\ntrusting that he might block the British army by maintaining a bold\r\nattitude in its front, and still hoping that large reinforcements\r\nmight reach him ere long from Drouet and Mortier, he had resolved\r\nonly to evacuate the Lisbon peninsula, and to retire no further than\r\nto the flat and fertile lands between Santarem and the Zezere. In\r\nthe Plain of Golegão, as it is sometimes called, he hoped to feed\r\nhis army for many weeks more, for the region was still comparatively\r\nfull of resources, since it had only been exploited as yet by the\r\ngarrison of Santarem and the flying columns which had marched to\r\nthe Zezere. It was now his cherished hope that Wellington might\r\nfollow him into the plain-land, abandoning his defensive system,\r\nand consenting to give battle in the open. The English might even\r\nbe induced to attack the French army when it should have taken up a\r\nnew and a strong position. In somewhat rash confidence the Marshal\r\nprofessed himself certain of the result, even with his depleted army\r\nof under 50,000 men, if Wellington would consent to fight. At the\r\nworst, if starved out again or beaten in the field, he would retreat\r\non Spain by Castello Branco, for which purpose he had sent up the\r\ngreater part of his boat-train from Santarem to build a bridge over\r\nthe Zezere. He had also pushed part of Loison’s brigade of infantry\r\nacross that river at Punhete, and was holding with it a point\r\nsuitable for a _tête-du-pont_. A regiment of dragoons was attached to\r\nthis force: it skirmished not unfrequently with parties sent out to\r\nreconnoitre from Abrantes, but with no serious result. For General\r\nLobo, the governor, had no intention of coming out with a large\r\ndetachment, in order to push the French advanced guard back over the\r\nriver. He had been ordered to keep to the defensive, and only sent\r\nout occasional reconnaissances to see whether the enemy were still in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nLoison’s troops were now no longer the only large force which had\r\nquitted the army in front of the Lines. Not only was Montbrun, with\r\nthe main body of the cavalry, watching the roads from the north,\r\nbut six battalions of infantry had been sent up from the 6th Corps\r\non November 8 to occupy Torres Novas and Thomar. If Wellington had\r\nattacked the enemy behind Sobral on any day after that date, he\r\nwould have found Ney short of fourteen battalions[545] out of the\r\nthirty-four which formed his corps. There would have been only 10,000\r\ninfantry ready to support Junot in the direction of Alemquer. But\r\nthis fact, of course, was unknown to the English general, who had\r\nalready made up his mind not to take the offensive. If it had come\r\nto his knowledge, he might have attacked, even at the last moment,\r\nwith an enormous probability of inflicting on the enemy not the mere\r\nrepulse that he disliked to contemplate--on account of its ulterior\r\neffects--but a crushing defeat, which might have hurled them out of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n  [545] Viz. 39th (3 batts.) and 69th (3 batts.) of Marchand’s\r\n  division at Thomar and Torres Novas, with Loison’s 66th (3\r\n  batts.), 82nd (2 batts.), and 26th (3 batts.). It will be\r\n  remembered that Reynier was, at the same time, minus the 4/47th,\r\n  sent as escort with Foy to Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\n\r\nOn November 10 Masséna ordered the hospitals of the 6th and 8th Corps\r\nat Alemquer, and of the 2nd Corps at Azambuja, to be sent off to\r\nSantarem. At the same time the intendants of the commissariat were\r\nordered to direct to the rear the meagre store of provisions which\r\nwas in their possession, loaded on the much depleted transport train\r\nwhich still survived. On the 13th the reserve parks and the artillery\r\ntrain of each corps were ordered to follow. On the 14th, at eight\r\no’clock in the evening, the infantry, many of whom lay in contact\r\nwith the British lines, acted on their marching directions. Ney’s\r\nmain body, which was out of sight of Wellington, was to move first;\r\nthen Junot and Ferey’s brigade, whose movement was most perilous--for\r\nif their departure were discovered while they were on the hither side\r\nof the defile of Alemquer, they ran a great risk of being enveloped\r\nand destroyed. Reynier was to maintain his position at Villafranca\r\nand Carregado, until it was reported to him that Junot and his corps\r\nhad passed Alemquer and reached Moinho de Cubo. For if the 2nd Corps\r\nhad gone off at an early hour, and its departure had been discovered,\r\nHill might have marched from Alhandra on Alemquer quickly enough to\r\nintercept Junot at that point; and if Junot were being pursued at the\r\nmoment by the troops from his immediate front, the whole 8th Corps\r\nmight have been cut off.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 14th, when the movement was commencing, Masséna\r\nwas favoured with the greatest piece of luck which had come to him\r\nsince the explosion of Almeida. A fog began to rise in the small\r\nhours, and had become dense by the early morning. It caused some\r\ndifficulty to the retiring troops, and dragoons had to be placed at\r\nevery cross road to point out the right direction to the infantry\r\ncolumns[546]. But it had the all-important result of permitting the\r\nBritish outposts to see nothing at dawn. The limit visible to them\r\nwas less than 100 yards. It was only at ten o’clock in the morning\r\nof the 15th that the mists were suddenly rolled up by an east wind,\r\nand that the nearer outposts could see that the French sentinels\r\nin front of them had disappeared. The first alarm was given by\r\nCampbell’s 6th Division[547]. The news spread along the whole line\r\nfrom west to east, and reached the Commander-in-Chief, who ascended\r\nthe hill in front of Sobral a few minutes later[548]. The ingenuity\r\nof the enemy in concealing his departure had been great. Ferey’s\r\nbrigade, in front of Arruda, had erected a well-designed line of\r\ndummy sentinels before the Light Division, which were not discovered\r\nto be men of straw, topped with old shakos and bound to poles, till\r\nthe fog rolled off on the 15th[549].\r\n\r\n  [546] Delagrave, p. 123 and note.\r\n\r\n  [547] Londonderry, ii. pp. 51-2.\r\n\r\n  [548] His first dispatch, that to Craufurd, is dated at 10.20.\r\n\r\n  [549] See Leach’s _Diary_, p. 178.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French had accomplished the first stage of their\r\nretreat absolutely unmolested. Ney had retreated as far as Alcoentre;\r\nJunot had passed the defile of Alemquer, and passed through Moinho\r\nde Cubo to Aveira de Cima. Reynier, who had waited till Junot was in\r\nsafety before he withdrew at eight in the morning, reached Cartaxo\r\nbefore the day ended. The first and most difficult stage of the\r\nretreat had been finished without a shot being fired. What would\r\nhave happened had the night of the 14th been clear and starry, and\r\nthe morning sun had shone out on the 15th, so that Junot would have\r\nbeen detected as he was passing Alemquer, and Reynier would have\r\nbeen visible still in line of battle behind Villafranca, the French\r\ndiarists of the campaign prefer not to contemplate. Yet they mostly\r\ncontinued to speak of Wellington as a mediocre general, who had all\r\nthe luck on his side.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 15th the British Commander-in-Chief had to draw\r\nhis deductions from the facts before him. Three things were possible:\r\nMasséna might have been so thoroughly starved out and broken in\r\nspirit, that he might be intending to retire on Spain, either via\r\nThomar and the Mondego, or by his new bridge on the Zezere and the\r\nroute of Castello Branco. Or he might be proposing to cross the Tagus\r\nby means of the boats and pontoons still remaining at Santarem, to\r\nseek unwasted fields in the Alemtejo and a junction with Mortier. Or,\r\nagain, he might merely be abandoning a position that was no longer\r\ntenable, in order to take up a new one--perhaps at Santarem, perhaps\r\nat Thomar, but very possibly at and about Abrantes, whose siege he\r\nmight be contemplating[550].\r\n\r\n  [550] Wellington to Fane, Nov. 15: ‘The enemy retreated last\r\n  night. He intends either to retire across the Zezere into Spain,\r\n  or across the Tagus into Spain, or across the Zezere to attack\r\n  Abrantes. The last is possible, as I last night received an\r\n  account that on the 9th they had a considerable reinforcement\r\n  coming on the frontier at Beira Alta.’\r\n\r\nOn the whole Wellington thought it probable that the last-named plan\r\nwas the one which Masséna intended to adopt. A retreat on Spain\r\nwould not only be difficult and dangerous, but inconsistent with the\r\nMarshal’s obstinate and courageous temper. It was much more likely\r\nthat he would endeavour to hold out in Portugal, and meanwhile to\r\ncover his partial discomfiture by a bold stroke, such as the siege of\r\nAbrantes, which would still give an offensive air to his movements,\r\nand would also throw on the British army the responsibility of\r\nrelieving the fortress. Such a course, it will be remembered, was\r\nwhat Napoleon recommended to Foy[551]. ‘There is still a chance that\r\nthe enemy may take up and try to keep a position at Santarem,’ wrote\r\nWellington to Fane on the night of the 15th, ‘endeavouring to keep\r\nhis rear open, and to get a communication with Ciudad Rodrigo across\r\nthe Zezere.’ But he was inclined to think that Abrantes was Masséna’s\r\ngoal. He therefore directed Fane to transfer his cavalry to the point\r\nopposite Abrantes on the south bank of the Tagus, and requested\r\nCarlos d’España to enter the place and strengthen the garrison. He\r\nintended to pass over Hill’s two divisions to strengthen Fane, and\r\nfor that purpose directed Admiral Berkeley to prepare all the boats\r\nof the fleet to ferry Hill across to Salvaterra, on the south bank\r\nof the Tagus, from whence his force could join Fane, and either\r\nreinforce Abrantes, by means of its bridge of boats, or join in the\r\npursuit of Masséna if he were about (an unlikely chance) to retire on\r\nSpain by way of his bridge over the Zezere[552] and Castello Branco.\r\n\r\n  [551] See p. 457 above.\r\n\r\n  [552] All from the orders issued at 10.30 in the morning ‘from\r\n  the hill in front of Sobral’. _Dispatches_, vi. 623.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all was still uncertain, and it was Wellington’s first task\r\nto find out what roads the enemy had taken in his retreat. He did\r\nnot on the 15th order his whole army to leave the Lines in headlong\r\npursuit. Only Spencer, Craufurd, and Hill were directed to march\r\nthat afternoon. The former, with a cavalry regiment out in his front,\r\noccupied Sobral, and pushed its vanguard forward to Alemquer by the\r\nhigh road. The second left Arruda, climbed the low hills in front of\r\nhim, where Ferey had been encamped for the last month, and felt his\r\nway to Alemquer, by the bad road which his immediate adversary had\r\ntaken eighteen hours before. Hill followed the great _chaussée_ along\r\nthe Tagus bank, by Villafranca and Castanheira, and reached Carregado\r\nbefore dark. He was warned to be in readiness to cross the river, by\r\nmeans of Admiral Berkeley’s boats, at the earliest possible moment,\r\nin case the French should have built a bridge at Santarem to enable\r\nthem to cross into the Alemtejo.[553]\r\n\r\n  [553] All from the orders issued at 10.30 in the morning ‘from\r\n  the hill in front of Sobral’. _Dispatches_, vi. 623.\r\n\r\nThe advancing troops found the French camps, and the villages where\r\nthe more fortunate battalions had been quartered under cover, in the\r\nmost dreadful condition. ‘The Alemquer road was covered with horses,\r\nmules, and asses which had perished from want of forage. We passed\r\nmany French soldiers lying dead by the road-side, whose appearance\r\nindicated that disease and want of food had carried them off. Every\r\nhouse in every town or village was thoroughly ransacked[554].’\r\n‘Alemquer had been entirely sacked, the windows and doors torn down\r\nand burnt, as well as most of the furniture; china, pier-glasses, and\r\nchandeliers all dashed to pieces with the objectless fury of savages.\r\nThey had left many miserable fellows behind, who were too ill to\r\nmarch: these were, of course, put to death by the Portuguese whenever\r\nwe happened to miss finding them out. We found several peasants whom\r\nthe French had murdered and left upon the road, and also several\r\nFrench killed by the Portuguese. It was a dreadful sight to see\r\nso many fine towns and villages sacked, and without a creature in\r\nthem.’[555]\r\n\r\n  [554] Leach’s _Journal_, p. 179.\r\n\r\n  [555] George Simmons’s _Journal_, pp. 121-2.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th none of the enemy had been seen save the dead and the\r\nabandoned sick. The traces of their retreat, however, showed that all\r\nhad gone off by the roads towards Santarem. On the 16th Wellington\r\nmoved more troops out of the Lines, to support Hill, Craufurd, and\r\nSpencer, in the event of the enemy showing fight. Slade’s horse\r\nfollowed Spencer, Pack’s Portuguese followed Craufurd; Picton, Leith,\r\nCole, and Campbell were left in the Lines, which Wellington still\r\ndisliked to leave wholly unguarded while he was not yet certain of\r\nthe ultimate intentions of the French. The advanced guard picked up\r\nabout 300 prisoners this day--partly marauders, partly debilitated\r\nmen who could not keep up with their regiments during a second stage\r\nof hard marching. Next day (November 17) it was evident that the\r\nenemy was being overtaken: Anson’s cavalry brigade, which had reached\r\nthe front on the preceding night, cut up a number of small parties\r\nof the French rearguard--the 16th Light Dragoons alone captured two\r\nofficers and 78 men, not stragglers, but belated pickets and convoy\r\nguards. One of their exploits was long remembered--Sergeant Baxter,\r\nwith five men only, came on an infantry outpost of 50 men, who had\r\nstacked their arms and were cooking. Bursting in upon them, he\r\ncaptured an officer and 41 men, though some of the Frenchmen had got\r\nto their muskets and wounded one of his troopers.[556]\r\n\r\n  [556] For a full description of the doings of the 16th on this\r\n  day, see Tomkinson, pp. 59-60.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 17th the enemy’s rearguard was at last\r\ndiscovered, drawn up on a heath outside the village of Cartaxo. It\r\nconsisted of one of Reynier’s divisions, which Craufurd was preparing\r\nto attack, when the Commander-in-Chief came up, and refused him leave\r\nto begin the combat, because neither Hill nor Spencer was within\r\nsupporting distance of him. Opinions differed as to whether an attack\r\nwould have led to a repulse by superior numbers, or to the capture\r\nof the French division, which had a bridge and a long causeway--a\r\nmost dangerous defile--in its rear[557]. Probably Craufurd was not\r\nin quite sufficient strength to be certain of success: he had but\r\nsix strong battalions[558], a battery, and the 16th Light Dragoons\r\nin his company. The enemy had the eleven weak battalions of Merle’s\r\ndivision, and two regiments of cavalry: probably 1,000 bayonets and\r\n300 sabres in all more than Craufurd could command. But an attack\r\nmade with vigour, when half the French had begun to retire across\r\nthe defile, might have had considerable results. Merle’s division\r\nwas, however, allowed to retire unmolested in the evening, while the\r\nLight Division took up quarters for the night at Cartaxo. Reynier\r\ndrew back the whole of his corps next morning to the environs of\r\nSantarem, which he had been directed to defend. Meanwhile the 8th\r\nCorps had reached Pernes with one division, and Alcanhede with the\r\nother and its cavalry: these were the points at which Junot had been\r\nordered to stay his retreat. The bulk of the 6th Corps was at Thomar,\r\nbut Loison’s division had been kept in the neighbourhood of the\r\nZezere[559], and part of Marchand’s infantry and Ney’s corps-cavalry\r\nwere at Cabaços. The retreat was thus ended, for Masséna was in\r\npossession of the new ground on which he intended to maintain himself\r\nfor the winter, and he was prepared to accept a defensive battle if\r\nWellington should push him any further. His left flank near the Tagus\r\n(Reynier’s corps) was advanced: his right flank (Junot’s corps) much\r\n‘refused.’ Ney was forming the central reserve.\r\n\r\n  [557] Leach thinks, with William Napier (iii. 41), that\r\n  Wellington acted wisely in refusing Craufurd leave to attack (p.\r\n  180). Tomkinson, another eye-witness, thinks that an opportunity\r\n  was missed (pp. 60, 61).\r\n\r\n  [558] Having now received the Brunswick Oels Jägers, the Light\r\n  Division was six battalions strong, not its usual five. Its\r\n  strength about this time was some 4,000 bayonets. Merle’s\r\n  division was about 5,000 strong: it had dwindled to 4,200\r\n  effectives before December was out. Thus the English and Caçadore\r\n  battalions averaged 650 men, the French 450 only, so that the\r\n  strength was not very unequal. But only 2,500 of Craufurd’s\r\n  troops were British.\r\n\r\n  [559] There its main body was now joined by Ferey’s brigade,\r\n  which had been detached for some weeks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for himself the British Commander-in-Chief received, on\r\nthe night of the 17th, confusing intelligence, which led him to the\r\nfalse conclusion that the enemy was still retiring, and was aiming\r\neither for Abrantes or for the borders of Spain. This news was sent\r\nby Fane, who from the other bank of the Tagus had observed French\r\ncolumns and convoys marching eastward from Santarem towards the\r\nZezere[560], and wrongly inferred that the main army was making for\r\nthis direction, and that only a rearguard had been left in Santarem.\r\nHe was also influenced by the fact, reported from Abrantes, that\r\nMasséna had cast a second bridge over the Zezere near Punhete, as if\r\nto give him a quicker chance of passing that river. In consequence\r\nof this news, Wellington directed Hill to cross the Tagus at Vallada\r\nwith his own division, Hamilton’s Portuguese, and the 13th Light\r\nDragoons, in order to strengthen Abrantes if it were assailed, or to\r\nfall on the flank of the French, if they were merely passing that\r\nfortress on their retreat to Spain. Thus he deprived himself of\r\n14,000 men on the right bank of the Tagus, where alone troops were\r\nreally needed. To make up for Hill’s absence, Leith’s and Cole’s\r\ndivisions were called out of the Lines, where they had rested till\r\nthis moment (18th November)[561]. But they were two marches off,\r\nand Wellington had for the moment in his front line only Craufurd,\r\nSpencer, Pack’s Portuguese, and Slade’s and Anson’s cavalry, a force\r\nof some 16,000 men. Reynier was in his immediate front at Santarem,\r\nwith 13,000 men of all arms. Junot’s corps at Alcanhede and Pernes\r\nwas twelve miles away, and about 11,000 strong: the greater part of\r\nhis men could have been brought up in half a day’s march. Ney was too\r\ndistant to come up in less than 24 hours, and then only with half his\r\ncorps, as Loison and one of Marchand’s brigades were far away. But if\r\nWellington had attacked Santarem on the 19th the Duke of Elchingen\r\nwould have appeared next morning.\r\n\r\n  [560] Probably Ferey’s brigade marching to join Loison and trains\r\n  following it, and certainly Reynier’s trains which he had sent\r\n  off towards Golegão. See _Dispatches_, vi. 629.\r\n\r\n  [561] _The Diary of the Marches of the 4th Division_, by its\r\n  Assistant Quarter-Master, Charles Vere, settles the date. For\r\n  Leith’s start on the same morning, see Leith-Hay’s _Narrative_,\r\n  i. p. 269.\r\n\r\nCraufurd was as strongly convinced as his chief that there was\r\nnothing in front of him but a rearguard on the night of the 18th, and\r\nhe even doubted whether the last of the French would not withdraw at\r\nmidnight. It was this that induced him to make the curious personal\r\nexploration mentioned by Napier (iii. 63)[562], when, followed by\r\na single sergeant only, he pushed along the causeway in the small\r\nhours of the morning, ran into the French picket, and escaped as if\r\nby miracle the volley that was fired at him. The picket reported to\r\nReynier that they had been seriously attacked, had killed three of\r\ntheir assailants, and had heard the groans of wounded dragged away\r\nby the survivors. Craufurd and his sergeant retired, thoroughly\r\nconvinced that the causeway had not been evacuated.\r\n\r\n  [562] Napier, however, dates the General’s escapade wrongly.\r\n  It took place on the night of the 18th-19th, where it is duly\r\n  related in the diary of George Simmons (p. 117), and not on the\r\n  21st as Napier implies. I have a copy of Delagrave’s _Campagne\r\n  de Portugal_, which once belonged to Napier; he has written a\r\n  sarcastic note on the bottom of page 111, commenting on the\r\n  ridiculous account of the event which appeared in the French\r\n  narratives. He adds that the sergeant’s name was McCurry, and\r\n  that ‘the sergeant had sense enough to hold his tongue, but\r\n  Craufurd spoke out, and so drew the fire of the enemy’s picket.’\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly fortunate for the British Commander-in-Chief that\r\nhis habitual caution prevented him from making a serious attack\r\non the force at Santarem, under the impression that it was a mere\r\nrearguard, left behind to detain him while the enemy’s main body\r\nwas pushing for Abrantes. Reynier’s position was very formidable.\r\nThe town of Santarem, surrounded by an old mediaeval wall, stands\r\non a lofty height above the Tagus, with a narrow suburb--where the\r\nFrench dockyard had been established--along the lower edge of the\r\nhill. But this was only the third and last line of the defensive\r\nposition. In front of it lay low alluvial ground, inundated by the\r\nrain which had been falling during the last fortnight, and barely\r\npassable save by the _chaussée_ from Lisbon. The plain was cut in\r\ntwo by the Rio Mayor, a deep muddy stream at this time of the year,\r\nand to reach Santarem a narrow bridge over this obstacle had to be\r\npassed. Just where the _chaussée_ leaves the marsh, to climb towards\r\nthe town, was a long knoll, completely commanding the road: on this\r\nReynier had placed a battery with infantry supports. This force must\r\nbe driven in by the British, and the only practicable way to reach it\r\nwas by forcing a passage along the causeway, for the marsh between\r\nthe road and the Tagus turned out, when explored, to be practically\r\ninaccessible to formed troops, though individuals might wade through\r\nit in a few places. Behind the advanced French knoll were the\r\nfoot-hills of the lofty ridge on which Santarem lies. The enemy\r\nwere visible upon it, working hard at the construction of a line of\r\n_abattis_ from the olive-trees which cover its slopes. Behind this,\r\nagain, was the town itself, hastily prepared for defence.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 19th the British advanced guard was on the\r\nedge of the swampy plain; Craufurd’s Light Division occupied the near\r\nend of the long bridge over the Rio Mayor, and skirmished with the\r\nFrench outposts, who refused to retire from the further side. Spencer\r\ncame up more to the left, and further inland, Pack’s Portuguese\r\nreached the upper course of the Rio Mayor. Neither Leith nor Cole had\r\nyet arrived at the front, so that the force available for an attack\r\nwas no more than 16,000 men. Nevertheless, Wellington, still hoping\r\nthat he had only a rearguard in front of him, made dispositions for a\r\ndemonstration against the enemy’s front, which was to be turned into\r\na real attack if he showed want of strength. Craufurd was directed to\r\nadvance across the swamp near the Tagus, if he found it practicable.\r\nPack was to cross the upper Rio Mayor, and turn the hostile right.\r\nSpencer was formed at the entrance of the bridge and causeway,\r\nand ordered to charge up the _chaussée_ at the French centre, and\r\nthe battery commanding the road, so soon as he should see that\r\nthe flanking divisions were making good progress. Fortunately for\r\nWellington the attack was never delivered: more rain during the night\r\nhad made the marsh so waterlogged that Craufurd, who had crossed the\r\nRio Mayor by a narrow wooden bridge near Valle, came to a stand in\r\nthe slush, though a few of his skirmishers pushed far enough forward\r\nto engage the enemy’s pickets on the other side. Pack’s Portuguese\r\non the left flank got across the river with much difficulty, but\r\ntheir guns were absolutely stuck in the mud far to the rear, and the\r\nbrigadier sent back word to Wellington that he should advance no\r\nfurther without special orders. The 1st Division had not yet begun\r\nto move. Thereupon the Commander-in-Chief called back both Craufurd\r\nand Pack, and gave up his plan. It is clear that he had nourished\r\nsome intention of attacking in earnest, for he wrote to Hill that\r\nafternoon: ‘I did not attack Santarem this morning, as the artillery\r\nof the left wing (Pack) had lost its way, and I am rather glad that\r\nI did not attack, as the enemy have there undoubtedly a very strong\r\npost, and we must endeavour to turn it. And if they [the main body]\r\nhave not retired across the Zezere or towards the Alva, they must be\r\ntoo strong for us here.’\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that both Wellington’s and Masséna’s strategy on the\r\n18th and 19th November is exposed to criticism. Why had the British\r\nGeneral only 16,000 men to the front on these days, when he was\r\nrisking a general action with the French? One of two courses must\r\nhave been adopted by the enemy: either he must be marching hard for\r\nthe Zezere, and intending to retire into Spain, or he must be merely\r\nchanging his ground, and proposing to fight at Santarem, or in front\r\nof Abrantes, or elsewhere. In either case it was strange tactics for\r\nWellington to take the field with 16,000 men (deducting Hill on the\r\nother side of the Tagus), while he left Leith and Cole two or three\r\nmarches behind, and still kept the divisions of Picton, Campbell, and\r\nLe Cor, and the unattached Portuguese brigade of Coleman and Alex.\r\nCampbell--20,000 men--unmoved within the Lines. For if the enemy was\r\nflying, there was no need to leave such a force of regulars to guard\r\npositions which the French could not be intending to attack. While\r\nif the other hypothesis was correct, and Masséna, with an army which\r\nWellington still reckoned at 50,000 men, was in a fighting mood,\r\nand ready to give battle if he saw an advantageous opportunity, it\r\nwas still more inexcusable to leave behind 20,000 men, who would be\r\nwanted for the decisive struggle.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the French Marshal was taking a terrible\r\nrisk also. Supposing Wellington had been leading his whole\r\nforce--deducting Hill--for a resolute attack on the Santarem\r\npositions, which was the most probable course for him to adopt, he\r\nmight have had not only the 16,000 men that he had actually brought\r\nforward, but Leith and Cole with 11,000 more, and Picton and the\r\nother 20,000 men left in the Lines, a force, if the cavalry be thrown\r\nin, of full 50,000 sabres and bayonets. If Wellington had left\r\nCraufurd and Pack to block the marshy southern exit from Santarem,\r\nwhich was as difficult for Reynier as for his adversaries, he might\r\nhave thrown 40,000 men into the empty space of twelve miles between\r\nReynier and Junot, have driven away the latter’s 11,000 men, and\r\nsurrounded Reynier’s 13,000 in Santarem. Ney could not have got up\r\nin time to prevent this. The 2nd Corps would either have had to\r\nsurrender, for it had hardly any food, or to cut its way out with\r\ndisastrous losses[563].\r\n\r\n  [563] The emplacement of the Anglo-Portuguese army is given as\r\n  follows by Beresford’s Quarter-Master-General, D’Urban, on the\r\n  night of the 18th-19th, showing its complete dislocation:--\r\n\r\n    Light Division, Pack, and Slade’s and Anson’s cavalry--before\r\n      Santarem.\r\n    1st Division--Cartaxo.\r\n    2nd Division--passing the Tagus at Vallada.\r\n    5th Division--Alemquer.\r\n    4th Division--Sobral.\r\n    6th Division--Ribaldeira (in the Lines).\r\n    3rd Division, and Coleman’s and Alex. Campbell’s\r\n      Portuguese--Torres Vedras.\r\n    Le Cor’s Division--Alhandra (in the Lines).\r\n\r\nReynier saw this perfectly, and was in an agony of mind on the 18th\r\nand 19th. He wrote urgent appeals to Masséna, for permission to\r\nabandon Santarem on the former day, pointing out that if his front\r\nwas practically inaccessible, because of the swamps, his right might\r\nbe turned by the upper Rio Mayor, where he had only a single regiment\r\nin observation, to face what might be an overwhelming strength of\r\nBritish troops, who might be preparing to cut in between him and\r\nJunot. He sent all his train, sick, and wounded to Golegão[564],\r\nand besought leave to follow them. When he received a peremptory\r\nreply, to the effect that he was to hold Santarem to the last, he\r\ncame to the conclusion that he was to be sacrificed in order to\r\nallow the other two corps to escape unmolested. When Pack advanced\r\non the 19th he sent the report that he was turned by 10,000 British\r\ntroops--Pack had but 3,000 Portuguese--and that Clausel with Junot’s\r\nnearest division was too far off to succour him. He prepared to\r\nsuffer a disaster, and to die fighting[565]. He ordered his troops to\r\nsurround Santarem, in rear as well as in front, with a double line of\r\n_abattis_, and continued to strengthen and repair its old walls.\r\n\r\n  [564] It was their march, visible from the other side of the Tagus,\r\n  which helped to deceive Fane as to the general movements of the\r\n  French army.\r\n\r\n  [565] See Delagrave, 128-30, and Gachot’s excellent notes thereon.\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, could exceed Reynier’s relief when Pack and\r\nCraufurd halted, and Spencer did not move at all, after the firing\r\nhad begun upon the 19th. On the next morning the British army\r\nwas still stationary, save that a cavalry reconnaissance, pushed\r\nnorthward from Pack’s position on the upper Rio Mayor, discovered\r\nJunot’s outposts in the direction of Alcanhede and Pernes, and\r\nreported to Wellington that the enemy was in strength, with all arms,\r\nin this direction. Leith’s division came up this morning, raising\r\nthe British force to 21,000 men, but this, as the Commander-in-Chief\r\nnow saw, was not sufficient to enable him to deal with two corps\r\nd’armée, of which one was in an inaccessible position and now\r\nstockaded up to the eyes. He halted, and sent, very tardily, orders\r\nfor Cole to join in haste, and for Campbell’s division to come up\r\nfrom the Lines. But even thus he was too weak to strike. Hill was now\r\nat Almeirim, half way to Abrantes on the other side of the Tagus.\r\nFane had actually entered Abrantes, and sent news that the enemy was\r\nmaking no forward movement from the Zezere. Thus at last Wellington\r\ndiscovered that he must have practically the whole French army in his\r\nfront, while his own forces were in a state of terrible dispersion.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st he wrote a dispatch to Lord Liverpool which shows that\r\nhe had given up all intention of pushing Masséna further. ‘Although\r\nthe enemy have moved large bodies of troops eastward from Santarem,\r\nI have not heard that any large body has crossed the Zezere....\r\nTheir army being collected between Santarem and the Zezere, they are\r\nin a situation to be able to maintain themselves in their strong\r\nposition till the reinforcements, which I know are on the frontier,\r\ncan join them. For this reason, and because I am unwilling to expose\r\nto the inclemencies of the weather a larger body of troops than is\r\nabsolutely necessary to press upon the enemy’s rear, and to support\r\nmy advanced guard, I have kept in reserve a considerable proportion\r\nof the allied army--some of them still in their cantonments in the\r\nLines, our fortified position. I have ordered General Hill to halt\r\nthe head of his corps at Chamusca [on the other side of the Tagus,\r\nfifteen miles south of Abrantes] till the enemy’s movements have\r\nbeen decided.... The rain, which has been very heavy since the 15th,\r\nhas so completely filled the rivulets and destroyed the roads, that\r\nI have hitherto found it impossible to dislodge the enemy from his\r\nposition at Santarem, by movements through the hills on his right\r\nflank. Possibly the bad state of the roads has also been the cause\r\nof his remaining at Santarem so long.... The enemy’s army may be\r\nreinforced, and they may again induce me to think it expedient,\r\nin the existing state of affairs in the Peninsula, to resume my\r\npositions [the Lines]. But I do not believe that they have it in\r\ntheir power to bring such a force against us as to render the contest\r\na matter of doubt[566].’\r\n\r\n  [566] Wellington to Liverpool, Nov. 26, 1810.\r\n\r\nIn a supplementary dispatch, dated the same day, Wellington adds:\r\n‘At first I thought the enemy were off, and I am not quite certain\r\nyet that they are not going.... I am convinced that there is no man\r\nin his senses, who has ever passed a winter in Portugal, who would\r\nnot recommend them to go now, rather than to endeavour to maintain\r\nthemselves upon the Zezere during the winter, or than attack our\r\nposition, whatever may be the strength of their reinforcements.’\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, men in the French camp who advised Masséna to\r\ncontinue his retreat, but he had no intention of taking up a timid\r\npolicy after braving so many passed dangers. He had resolved to\r\nmaintain himself between Santarem and the Zezere, and to call down\r\nDrouet and other reinforcements[567], in the hope that, ere the\r\nwinter was over, the Emperor might find means to strengthen him to\r\na force which, with the co-operation of Soult from Andalusia, would\r\nenable him finally to resume the offensive, and make a second and\r\nmore formidable attack upon the Lines. In adopting this resolve he\r\nwas, though as yet he knew it not, carrying out the instructions\r\nwhich the Emperor was at this very moment (November 22) dictating\r\nto Foy at Paris. But Wellington had not written at random when he\r\nreminded Lord Liverpool of the terrors of a Portuguese winter, and\r\nin the end the Prince of Essling was forced to begin on the 1st of\r\nMarch, with under 40,000 men of his original force, the retreat which\r\nhe might have commenced on November 20 with over 50,000[568].\r\n\r\n  [567] Notably the column of Gardanne, of which we shall speak\r\n  presently.\r\n\r\n  [568] Including sick in each case, and excluding reinforcements\r\n  received later.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for starving out the French, which Wellington had\r\ndevised early in 1810, and begun to execute in September, was now\r\ntransferred to a different area. Masséna had been able to endure\r\nfor a month in front of the Lisbon Lines: the question now was\r\nwhether he would be able to live so long in the land between the\r\nRio Mayor and the Zezere. Wellington could not be sure of his data,\r\nin calculating the day when exhaustion would once more compel the\r\nFrench to shift their ground. It was only certain that the plain of\r\nGolegão, and the Thomar-Torres Novas country, had not been devastated\r\nby the Portuguese government even with the same energy that they\r\nhad displayed in the Lisbon Peninsula. And there, as the British\r\nCommander-in-Chief complained, not half the necessary work had been\r\ndone. Yet something had certainly been accomplished; the population\r\nhad nearly all been withdrawn, the mills destroyed, the corn buried\r\nor sent over the Tagus. Trusting to these facts, and to the rains\r\nand frosts of the oncoming winter, Wellington hoped that Masséna\r\nwould finally be reduced to a disastrous retreat by sheer privation.\r\n‘Though it is certainly astonishing that the enemy have been able to\r\nremain in this country so long, and it is an extraordinary instance\r\nof what a French army can do[569].’\r\n\r\n  [569] _Dispatches_, vii. 59.\r\n\r\nResolved to take no further offensive action, and to let famine do\r\nits work, Wellington, on November 24, gave orders for the army to\r\ndraw back and go into winter quarters, leaving only Craufurd and Pack\r\nin touch with the enemy in front of Santarem, and Spencer in support\r\nof them at Cartaxo. Of the other divisions, Hill remained behind the\r\nTagus at Chamusca and Almeirim, with his own troops and Hamilton’s\r\nPortuguese. Picton and the 3rd Division retained their old post at\r\nTorres Vedras, with Coleman and Alex. Campbell’s Portuguese near\r\nthem. Cole remained at Azambuja, in rear of Spencer. Leith was sent\r\nback to Alcoentre, Campbell’s 6th Division was placed at Alemquer,\r\nbehind Leith. Le Cor’s Portuguese stayed at Alhandra, within the\r\nLines.\r\n\r\n‘The army thus placed,’ writes D’Urban, the Quarter-Master-General,\r\non this day, ‘at once takes care of Abrantes (by means of Hill),\r\nobserves the enemy at Santarem (with Craufurd and Pack), has a\r\ndivision on the higher Rio Mayor road to turn the enemy’s right, if\r\nthis become expedient (Leith’s to wit), and still “appuis” itself\r\non the Lines, its retreat into which is secured by its echelloned\r\nposition. Means are ready to pass General Hill back to the right bank\r\nof the Tagus, with such celerity, that his divisions can be counted\r\nupon for the order of march or battle on this side of the river as\r\ncertainly as if he were already there[570].’\r\n\r\n  [570] D’Urban’s _Diary_, under Nov. 24.\r\n\r\nMasséna, on the other hand, also remained nearly quiescent for many\r\ndays, the only important change which he made in the cantonments\r\nof his army being that he moved in Clausel’s division closer to\r\nSantarem, to fill the dangerous gap between the 2nd and 8th Corps,\r\nwhich had existed on November 18. On the 22nd and 23rd he pushed\r\nforward, against Pack’s Portuguese and Anson’s light cavalry, a\r\nconsiderable force, consisting of Clausel’s whole division and six\r\nsquadrons from the 8th Corps, and General Pierre Soult with two\r\ncavalry regiments and three battalions from the 2nd Corps. After some\r\nlively but bloodless skirmishing, the allied troops retired behind\r\nthe Rio Mayor, evacuating the village of Calares beyond the stream,\r\nand drawing in their cavalry pickets, which had hitherto held some\r\nground on the further bank. This affair confirmed Wellington in his\r\nconclusion that nearly the whole French army was now concentrated on\r\nthe Santarem-Pernes line, and made him more reluctant than ever to\r\ntake the offensive.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Montbrun’s cavalry, supported by small detachments from\r\nthe infantry of Ney’s corps, had pressed somewhat further to the\r\nnorth, in order to occupy a broader tract of land from which the army\r\nmight feed itself, a task that grew harder every day. From his head\r\nquarters at Ourem and from Cabaços, on the Thomar-Coimbra road, he\r\ncontinued to send out strong reconnaissances in every direction, of\r\nwhich some occasionally pushed as far as Leiria on the road towards\r\nCoimbra, and others scoured the left bank of the lower Zezere and\r\nthe Nabao. The limit of their excursions was fixed by the fact that\r\nWilson’s brigade of Portuguese militia still lay at Espinhal, and,\r\nthough it was reduced by desertion and sickness to 1,500 men, was\r\nreported to Montbrun as a serious force, with which he had better not\r\nmeddle. Trant’s troops at Coimbra--a weak militia division--were also\r\nestimated at much over their real strength. It was not till later\r\nthat sheer starvation drove the French further afield, and revealed\r\nto them the weakness of the _cordon_ of inferior troops which hemmed\r\nthem in upon the northern side.\r\n\r\nThe blockade of the French army, therefore, remained still unbroken,\r\nand its communication with the north was as absolutely interrupted\r\nin the end of November as in the beginning of October. One attempt\r\nto break through the screen of Portuguese irregulars had been made\r\nin November, but of its failure Masséna had as yet no knowledge.\r\nWhen Foy reached Rodrigo, on his way to Paris, he had handed\r\nover his escort of one battalion of infantry and 120 horsemen to\r\nGeneral Gardanne, who was ordered to strengthen them with all the\r\nconvalescents of the Army of Portugal, and with the garrisons of\r\nAlmeida and Rodrigo also, if these last had now been relieved by\r\ntroops of Drouet’s 9th Corps. At the head of 6,000 men, as Masséna\r\ncalculated, he could cut his way to join the main army, escorting\r\na great train of munitions, of which both the artillery and the\r\ninfantry at the front were lamentably in need. Gardanne could not\r\ngather in the Almeida garrison, as that place was still blockaded\r\nby Silveira’s Portuguese. But with the two battalions from Rodrigo,\r\nadded to Foy’s late escort, and a mass of convalescents, he had\r\ncollected some 5,000 men by November 20[571], the day on which he\r\nmarched by the Sabugal-Belmonte-Fundão route towards Punhete and\r\nthe lower Zezere. He was cursed with dreadful weather, followed\r\nand harassed by all the Ordenança of the Castello Branco country,\r\nhampered by his heavy convoy, and much troubled by the disorderly\r\nconvalescents, who were largely professional malingerers. But he got\r\nas far as Cardigos on the Sobreira-Formosa road, only fifteen miles\r\nfrom Punhete, where Loison was awaiting him on the Zezere. Here he\r\nwas brought to a stand (November 27) by the flooded and bridgeless\r\nstream of the Codes. No news had reached him from Masséna, while he\r\nwas assured by Portuguese deserters, who probably were sent out to\r\ndeceive him by the governor of Abrantes, that the Marshal had not\r\nonly evacuated his position before the Lines, but was retreating on\r\nSpain via the Mondego. They added that Hill had just reached Abrantes\r\nwith 10,000 men, and was about to march against him. Thereupon\r\nGardanne hastily turned back, reached Penamacor by forced marches\r\non November 29, and from thence retired to Rodrigo, having lost 400\r\nmen and 300 horses by disease and fatigue during his ill-conducted\r\nexpedition. If he had pushed forward fifteen miles further on the\r\n28th, he would have got into touch with Loison, and reached Masséna’s\r\nhead quarters in safety. Wellington, not without reason, professed\r\nhimself unable to comprehend this strange march and countermarch. ‘I\r\ndo not exactly understand this movement[572],’ and ‘if this march\r\nwas ordered by superior authority, and was connected with any other\r\narrangements, it had every appearance of, and was attended by all the\r\nconsequences of, a precipitate and forced retreat[573].’\r\n\r\n  [571] Belmas’s figures (i. 137) given here must be about correct,\r\n  not the 2,000 of Fririon, and _Victoires et Conquêtes_. For the\r\n  two Rodrigo battalions were 1,500 strong, Foy’s escort 600, and\r\n  Gardanne took with him some of his own dragoon regiment, beside the\r\n  convalescents.\r\n\r\n  [572] _Dispatches_, vii. p. 20, to Craufurd.\r\n\r\n  [573] Ibid., p. 36, to Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we leave Masséna and his army, cantoned in the space\r\nbetween the Rio Mayor and the Zezere, still destitute of news from\r\nFrance, and still entirely ignorant whether or no any endeavour\r\nwas being made to relieve them. Of their further doings during the\r\nthree months that ended on March 1, 1811, we shall tell elsewhere.\r\nSuffice it to say that, despite many dangers and risks, Wellington’s\r\nscheme of starvation was played out to the end, and achieved complete\r\nsuccess. Of the privation and losses that the French suffered, and\r\nthe atrocities that they committed, of the difficulties of the\r\nBritish Commander-in-Chief--with an obstinate enemy still in front of\r\nhim, a factious Regency and a half-starved population behind him in\r\nLisbon, and a disquieting prospect that Soult might take a hand in\r\nthe game--the fourth volume of this work will give full details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXII\r\n\r\nEND OF THE YEAR 1810\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN THE NORTH AND EAST OF SPAIN (JULY-DECEMBER 1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile tracing the all-important Campaign of Portugal, down to\r\nthe deadlock in front of Santarem, which began about the 20th of\r\nNovember, 1810, and was to endure till the 1st of March in the\r\nsucceeding year, we have been obliged to leave untouched events,\r\ncivil and military, in many other parts of the Peninsula during the\r\nautumn. Only the Andalusian campaigns have been carried down to\r\nNovember: in Northern Spain we have traced the course of affairs\r\nno further than September[574]: in Eastern Spain no further than\r\nAugust[575]. Moreover, little has been said of the general effect on\r\nthe French occupation caused by the division of supreme authority\r\nwhich Napoleon sanctioned in the spring[576], or of the importance of\r\nthe long-deferred meeting of the Spanish Cortes, which assembled at\r\nCadiz in the autumn. With these points we must deal before proceeding\r\nto narrate the campaigns of 1811.\r\n\r\n  [574] See pp. 270-1.\r\n\r\n  [575] See pp. 200-1 and 315-16.\r\n\r\n  [576] See pp. 312-14.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the military operations, none of which were\r\nparticularly important, must precede the summary of the political\r\nsituation, with regard to King Joseph on the one side and the\r\nCortes on the other. For the acts of the King and the Cortes had an\r\ninfluence extending far beyond the months in which they began, and\r\nwere, indeed, main factors in the Peninsular struggle for years to\r\ncome. But the doings of the armies in Galicia and Asturias on the\r\none flank, in Catalonia and Valencia on the other, can easily be\r\ndismissed in a few pages: they were but preliminaries to the greater\r\noperations in the spring of 1811.\r\n\r\nWe may first turn to the north-west. When Masséna plunged into\r\nPortugal in September 1810, and was lost to the sight of his\r\ncolleagues and subordinates for nearly three months, the situation\r\nleft behind him was as follows:--Leon and Old Castile, as far as the\r\nGalician foot-hills and the Cantabrian sierras, were held down by\r\nSerras and Kellermann with some 12,000 men--a force none too great\r\nfor the task that lay before them. The latter general had charge\r\nof the provinces of Valladolid, Toro, and Palencia, as one of the\r\n‘military governors’ recently appointed by the Emperor. He gave\r\nhimself absurd airs of independent authority, and took little more\r\nheed of the orders of Masséna than of those of King Joseph, for whom\r\nhe showed a supreme contempt. General Serras’s troops were more\r\ndefinitely part of the Army of Portugal. They were in charge of the\r\nprovinces of Zamora, Leon, and Salamanca, thus covering Kellermann’s\r\ngovernment on the outer flank, and taking care of the borders both of\r\nGalicia on the Spanish and of Tras-os-Montes on the Portuguese side.\r\nTo cover this long front Serras had only eleven battalions[577],\r\nand two provisional regiments of dragoons--some 9,000 men. Out of\r\nthis force he had to find garrisons for Astorga, Leon, Benavente,\r\nZamora, and several smaller places. Kellermann, who was intended\r\nto serve as a reserve for Serras, as well as to guard the central\r\ndépôts at Valladolid, had only two regiments of dragoons (part of\r\nhis original division) and three infantry battalions, making 3,000\r\nmen in all[578]. Both of them were directed to keep in close touch\r\nwith Bonnet, who, at the head of his old troops, the four regiments\r\nwhich never came south of the Cantabrian hills till the Salamanca\r\ncampaign[579], kept a precarious hold on Central and Eastern Asturias\r\nwith 9,000 men.\r\n\r\n  [577] Viz. 113th Line (2 batts.), 4th of the Vistula (2 batts.),\r\n  one battalion each of the 12th Léger and 32nd and 58th Line, four\r\n  ‘provisional battalions’ (Nos. 2, 4, 5, 7), and two provisional\r\n  regiments of dragoons. Total on Sept. 15, 9,524 men, of whom 1,000\r\n  were cavalry.\r\n\r\n  [578] Two Swiss battalions, one battalion of the Garde de Paris, and\r\n  the 5th and 17th dragoons. Total, 1,300 cavalry and 1,700 infantry.\r\n\r\n  [579] Line regiments (each of 4 batts.), Nos. 118, 119, 120, 122, and\r\n  a squadron of the 21st Chasseurs, 9,298 men.\r\n\r\nThere were also present in the circumscription of Serras’s and\r\nKellermann’s command the garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo (two battalions)\r\nand Gardanne’s five squadrons of dragoons, which Masséna had left\r\nbehind, in the vain hope that they would keep the line clear between\r\nAlmeida and Salamanca. This force added 2,500 men to the total of the\r\nFrench troops in Leon.\r\n\r\nIf the French were left rather weak in this direction, the same was\r\nnot the case in the region further east. From Burgos to the Bidassoa\r\nthe country-side was full of troops in the latter half of September,\r\nwhen the Army of Portugal had gone westward. In the Government of\r\nBurgos were the two infantry divisions of the Young Guard, under\r\nRoguet and Dumoustier, with their two cavalry regiments, making\r\n11,464 sabres and bayonets. Navarre was occupied by 8,733 men,\r\nBiscay by 8,085. The little province of Santander was held by three\r\nprovisional battalions 3,500 strong. But this permanent garrison,\r\nmaking over 31,000 men, was at the moment supplemented by Drouet’s\r\n9th Corps, for whose arrival at the front Masséna had waited so long\r\nand so vainly. On September 15 its commander, its head quarters, and\r\nClaparéde’s division, were at Vittoria: Couroux’s division and the\r\ncavalry brigade of Fournier were echelloned between Vittoria and\r\nBayonne. The whole corps mustered over 18,000 sabres and bayonets.\r\nFifty thousand men, therefore, adding the permanent garrisons to\r\nthe advancing corps of Drouet, were between Burgos and Bayonne, and\r\nthere were yet a few more troops to come forward from the interior of\r\nFrance, for Caffarelli was bringing up another division, which had\r\nthe official title of the ‘Division of Reserve of the Army of Spain,’\r\nand consisted of four provisional regiments of infantry and two\r\ncavalry regiments, with a strength of 8,000 men[580]. It was ordered\r\nto be at Bayonne by October 20, and formed the nucleus of the force\r\nwhich in the next year was styled the ‘Army of the North’.\r\n\r\n  [580] See _Correspondance_, xxi. 106. On Sept. 13, the date of the\r\n  dispatch creating Caffarelli’s division, one of its regiments was\r\n  forming at Limoges, another at Blois, another at Bordeaux, the fourth\r\n  at Orleans.\r\n\r\nWithout counting this last unit, which was only in process of\r\nformation in September, Napoleon had between the Galician frontier\r\nand Bayonne no less than 72,000 men[581]. What had his enemies to\r\noppose to this formidable host, whose strength was considerably\r\ngreater than that of the force with which Masséna invaded Portugal?\r\nOf regularly organized troops the number of Spaniards and Portuguese\r\nopposed to them was absolutely insignificant. Silveira in the\r\nTras-os-Montes had six regiments of militia and one of the line--this\r\nlast being the 24th, the absconding garrison of Almeida. The whole\r\nmade under 7,000 men, including an incomplete cavalry regiment. Mahy\r\nin Galicia had recruited up the depleted divisions which La Romana\r\nhad left with him in the spring to a strength of 12,000 men, mostly\r\nraw and untrustworthy; for the best regiments had been destroyed at\r\nthe siege of Astorga. The remains of the army of Asturias, which had\r\nsuffered so many defeats at the hands of Bonnet during the spring and\r\nsummer, consisted of about 6,000 men, of whom half, under Barcena\r\nand Losada, were holding the western end of the province, behind\r\nthe Navia river, with head quarters at Castropol, while the rest\r\nlurked in the higher valleys of the Cantabrian Sierra, rendering\r\nBonnet’s communication with Serras in Leon insecure, and sometimes\r\ndescending to the coast, to make a sudden attack on one of the\r\nsmall garrisons which linked the French garrison in Oviedo with\r\nthat at Santander. Of these roving bands the chief leader was the\r\nadventurous Porlier, the _Marquesito_[582], as the Asturians called\r\nhim, who won a well-deserved reputation for his perseverance and\r\nnever-failing courage. The 25,000 men of Silveira, Mahy, and the\r\nAsturian army were the only regular troops opposed to the 75,000\r\nFrench in Northern Spain. How came it, then, that the enemy was held\r\nin check, and never succeeded in pushing on to the support of Masséna\r\nany force save the two divisions of Drouet? The answer is simple: the\r\nFrench garrisons were fixed down to their positions partly because\r\nof Napoleon’s entire lack of naval power, partly because of the\r\nunceasing activity of the guerrilleros, who were far more busy in\r\n1810 than at any preceding time. As to the first-named cause, it may\r\nbe said that the 20,000 French in Asturias, Santander, and Biscay\r\nwere paralysed by the existence of a small Anglo-Spanish squadron\r\nbased on Corunna and Ferrol. As long as this existed, every small\r\nport along the whole northern coast of Spain had to be garrisoned,\r\nunder penalty of a possible descent from the sea, which might cut the\r\nroad from Oviedo to San Sebastian at any one of a hundred points, and\r\nprovide arms and stores for the guerrilla bands of the mountains.\r\nMany such expeditions were carried out with more or less success in\r\n1810. The first and most prosperous of them took place in July, when\r\nPorlier, putting his free corps of some 1,000 men on transports, and\r\nconvoyed by the British commodore Mends, with a couple of frigates,\r\ncame ashore near the important harbour of Santona, drove out the\r\nsmall garrison, and then coasted along in the direction of Biscay,\r\ndestroying shore-batteries and capturing as many as 200 men at one\r\npoint and another. Of the peasantry of the coast, some enlisted in\r\nPorlier’s band, others took to the hills on their own account, when\r\nthey had been furnished with muskets from the ships. The Marquesito\r\nrepeated his raid in August, but this time stopped on shore, and put\r\nhimself at the head of the local insurgents, who made so strong a\r\nhead in the country about Potes and the upper Pisuerga, that Serras\r\nmarched against him with almost the whole of his division[583],\r\nand spent September in hunting him along the sides of the sierras.\r\nBut though aided by troops lent by Bonnet, and by detachments from\r\nBurgos, the French general could never catch the adroit partisan,\r\nwho, when too hard pressed, returned to the central mountains of the\r\nAsturias.\r\n\r\n  [581] Viz. Kellermann, 3,000; Serras, 9,000; Bonnet, 8,000; Young\r\n  Guard, 11,500; Biscay, 8,000; Navarre, 8,500; Santander, 3,500; 9th\r\n  Corps, 18,000; Masséna’s Garrisons, 2,500.\r\n\r\n  [582] As being nephew to the Marquis of La Romana.\r\n\r\n  [583] See pp. 270-1.\r\n\r\nPleased with the exploits of Porlier, the Cadiz Regency resolved\r\nto keep up the game, and sent up to Corunna Colonel Renovales,\r\nthe officer who had for so long made head against Suchet in the\r\nmountains of Aragon[584]. He was authorized to requisition a brigade\r\nfrom Mahy’s army, and the more seaworthy ships from the arsenal of\r\nFerrol. Applications for naval assistance had also been made to the\r\nBritish Admiralty, and Sir Home Popham came, with four frigates and a\r\nbattalion of marines, to assist in a systematic raid along the coasts\r\nof Asturias and Biscay. The joint expedition started from Corunna on\r\nOctober 14, with a landing force of 1,200 Spanish and 800 British\r\nbayonets on board. On the 16th it drew in to land near the important\r\nharbour of Gijon, where Bonnet kept a force of 700 men, who depended\r\nfor their succour on the main body of his division at Oviedo. But the\r\nFrench general chanced to be hunting Porlier further to the east,\r\nand had left the Asturian capital almost ungarrisoned. Hence, when\r\nPorlier unexpectedly appeared before Gijon on the inland side, having\r\neluded his pursuer, and the ships threw the landing force ashore,\r\nthe French battalion had to fly. Several ships, both privateers and\r\nmerchantmen, with a considerable amount of military stores, fell\r\ninto the hands of Porlier and Renovales. This exploit drew down on\r\nthem the whole French force in the Asturias, for Bonnet concentrated\r\nevery man and musket on Gijon. But the Anglo-Spanish squadron, having\r\nthus drawn him westward, sailed in the opposite direction, and,\r\nafter threatening Santona, was about to touch at Vivero, when it was\r\nscattered by a hurricane from the Bay of Biscay. A Spanish frigate\r\nand brig, an English brig, and several gunboats and transports were\r\ndashed on the rocky coast, and lost with all hands. This disaster,\r\nwhich cost 800 lives, compelled Renovales to return to Corunna\r\n(November 2). But the raid had not been useless; it had compelled\r\nBonnet to evacuate many posts, distracted the garrisons of Santander\r\nand Biscay, and even induced Caffarelli to march down to the coast\r\nwith his newly-arrived division, the ‘Reserve of the Army of Spain.’\r\nSerras, too, had drawn up the greater part of his scattered division\r\nto the north-west, thus leaving the borders of Galicia and the\r\nTras-os-Montes hardly watched. This enabled Mahy to send down troops\r\ninto the plain of Leon, and to establish something like a blockade\r\naround Astorga. But all the operations of the Captain-General of\r\nGalicia were feeble and tentative. He passed among his countrymen as\r\nan easy-going man, destitute of energy or initiative[585]. Silveira,\r\nin the Tras-os-Montes, a more active but a more dangerous man to\r\nentrust with troops, took advantage of Serras’s absence to cross the\r\nDouro, invest Almeida, and cut the communication between that place\r\nand Ciudad Rodrigo[586].\r\n\r\n  [584] See pp. 10-11.\r\n\r\n  [585] See for this verdict both Arteche and Toreno.\r\n\r\n  [586] See p. 447.\r\n\r\nSuch was the effect of the sea-power, even when it was used sparingly\r\nand by unskilful hands. The raids along the northern coast had kept\r\nBonnet and the troops in Santander and Biscay fully employed; they\r\nhad distracted Serras, Caffarelli, and even the garrisons of the\r\nprovince of Burgos. They had saved Mahy and Silveira from attack,\r\nand had lighted up a blaze of insurrection in the western hills of\r\nCantabria which, thanks to the energy of Porlier and his colleague\r\nLouga, was never extinguished.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mass of French troops between Burgos and Pampeluna--the\r\n9th Corps, the Young Guard Divisions, and the garrison in\r\nNavarre--had been ‘contained’ by an enemy of a different sort. Here\r\nthe influence of the British naval supremacy was little felt: it\r\nwas due to the energy of Spaniards alone that the 38,000 men under\r\nDrouet, Roguet and Dumoustier, and Reille were prevented during the\r\nmonths of September, October, and November from doing anything to\r\nhelp Masséna. Old Castile, Navarre, and the lands of the Upper Ebro,\r\nwere kept in a constant turmoil by a score of guerrillero chiefs,\r\nof whom the elder Mina was the leading figure. We have already had\r\noccasion to speak of the exploits of his relative, ‘the Student’ as\r\nhe was called, to distinguish him from his uncle, and have noted his\r\nfinal capture by Suchet[587]. Francisco Espoz y Mina had rallied the\r\nrelics of his nephew’s band, and began his long career of raids and\r\ncounter-marches in April 1810. His central place of refuge was the\r\nrough country on the borders of Navarre and Aragon, where he kept his\r\nmain dépôt at the head of the valley of Roncal; but he often ranged\r\nas far afield as Biscay and the provinces of Soria and Burgos. Almost\r\nfrom his first appearance he obtained a mastery over the other chiefs\r\nwho operated on both sides of the Upper Ebro, having won his place by\r\nthe summary process of seizing and shooting one Echeverria, ‘who,’\r\nas he writes, ‘was the terror of the villages of Navarre, which he\r\noppressed and plundered in a thousand ways, till they complained\r\nto me concerning him. I arrested him at Estella on June 13, 1810,\r\ncaused him to be shot with three of his principal accomplices, and\r\nincorporated his band (600 foot and 200 horse) with my own men[588].’\r\nMina was the special enemy of Reille, then commanding in Navarre,\r\nbut he also attracted the attention of Drouet, one of whose divisions\r\nwas entirely absorbed in hunting him during the autumn of 1810.\r\nThis was the main cause of the non-appearance of the 9th Corps at\r\nRodrigo and Salamanca, when Masséna was so anxiously awaiting its\r\narrival. Mina’s lot during this period was no enviable one: he was\r\nbeset on all sides by flying columns, and was often forced to bid his\r\nband disperse and lurk in small parties in the mountains, till the\r\nenemy should have passed on. Sometimes he was lurking, with seven\r\ncompanions only, in a cave or a gorge: at another he would be found\r\nwith 3,000 men, attacking large convoys, or even surprising one of\r\nthe blockhouses with which the French tried to cover his whole sphere\r\nof activity. The Regency, admiring his perseverance, gave him, in\r\nSeptember, the title of ‘Colonel and Commandant-General of all the\r\nGuerrilleros of Navarre.’ He asserts with pride, in his memoir, that\r\nhe was at one and the same time being hunted by Dorsenne, commanding\r\nat Burgos, Reille from Navarre, Caffarelli and his ‘division of\r\nReserve of the Army of Spain,’ by D’Agoult, Governor of Pampeluna,\r\nRoguet, commanding the Young Guard, and Paris, one of Suchet’s\r\nbrigadiers from the Army of Aragon. Yet none of the six generals,\r\nthough they had 18,000 men marching through his special district,\r\nsucceeded in catching him, or destroying any appreciable fraction of\r\nhis band.\r\n\r\n  [587] See p. 286.\r\n\r\n  [588] See Mina’s _Extracto de su Vida_, published in London, during\r\n  his exile, in 1825.\r\n\r\nThere is no exaggeration in this; his services were invaluable during\r\nthe campaign of Portugal, since he was wearing out a French force of\r\nfive times his own strength in fruitless marches, under winter rains,\r\nand over roads that had become all but impassable. The archives of\r\nthe French War Office show lists of officers by the dozen killed or\r\nwounded ‘dans une reconnaissance en Navarre,’ or ‘dans une rencontre\r\navec les bandes de Mina,’ or ‘en combat près de Pampelune,’ during\r\nthe later months of 1810. Wellington owed him no small gratitude,\r\nand expressed it to him in 1813, when he entrusted him with much\r\nresponsible work during the Campaign of the Pyrenees. The suffering\r\ninflicted on the provinces of the Upper Ebro by Mina’s activity\r\nwas of course terrible: the French destroyed every village that\r\nsheltered him or furnished him with recruits, and were wont to shoot\r\nevery prisoner from his band that they caught, till he began to\r\nretaliate by corresponding or greater numbers of executions from the\r\nconsiderable number of prisoners in his hands. In 1811 this barbarous\r\nsystem was in full swing on both sides, but it was put to an end by\r\nmutual agreement in 1812. In addition to the woes that Navarre and\r\nits neighbours suffered under the French martial law, and by the\r\nmonstrous requisitions imposed upon them to feed the mass of troops\r\nforming the flying columns, they had also to maintain the patriotic\r\nbands. Mina declares that he always took rations for his men, but\r\navoided levying money contributions on the peasantry, depending\r\non his booty, the rents of national and ecclesiastical property,\r\non which he laid hands, on fines inflicted on ‘bad Spaniards,’ i.\r\ne. those who had done anything to help his pursuers, and on ‘the\r\ncustom-houses which I established upon the very frontier of France;\r\nfor I laid under contribution even the French custom-house at Irun,\r\non the Bidassoa, which engaged to deliver, and actually paid to my\r\ndelegates, 100 gold ounces (about £320) per month.’ By this strange\r\nsecret agreement private goods passing Irun and the other frontier\r\nposts were guaranteed against capture in the district which Mina’s\r\nbands infested[589].\r\n\r\n  [589] Mina’s _Breve Extracto_, p. 39.\r\n\r\nEastward of Mina’s sphere of activity the guerrilleros were more\r\nnumerous but less powerful. Among the chief of them was Julian\r\nSanchez, who, with a mounted band of 300 to 500 lancers--infantry\r\nwould have been easily caught in the plain of Leon--busied himself\r\nin cutting the communication between Salamanca, Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nZamora, and Valladolid, and was Kellermann’s chief tormentor. He was\r\nin regular communication with Wellington, and sent him many captured\r\ndispatches and useful pieces of information. In Old Castile the\r\npriest Geronimo Merino, generally known as ‘El Cura,’ was the most\r\nfamous and most active among many leaders. It was his band, aided by\r\nthat of Tapia, also a cleric, which on July 10, 1810, fought a most\r\ndaring and desperate action at Almazan, near Soria, with two French\r\nbattalions of marines, who were marching, the one to join Masséna\r\nthe other to join Soult. It cost the enemy no less than 13 officers\r\n_hors de combat_, as the Paris archives show[590], and over 200\r\nmen, though the guerrilleros were finally beaten off. In October he\r\nsurprised and captured an enormous convoy of corn and munitions of\r\nwar, whose loss put the French garrison of Burgos in considerable\r\nstraits for some weeks. He waged with Dorsenne the same horrible\r\ncontest of retaliation in the shooting of prisoners which Mina was\r\nat the same time carrying on with the generals in Navarre. There\r\nwere many other bands in Old Castile, those of Abril, Tenderin,\r\nSaornil, Principe, and others, of whom some are accused by their own\r\ncolleagues of being more harmful to the country-side than to the\r\nFrench, from their reckless and miscellaneous plundering, and their\r\nrefusal to combine for any systematic action[591]. Yet even the worst\r\nof them contributed to distract the activity of the French garrisons,\r\nand to retard the communication of dispatches and the march of\r\nisolated detachments. Under the easy excuse that it was dangerous\r\nto move any small body of men along the high-roads, the French\r\ncommanders of every small town or blockhouse detained for weeks,\r\nand even months, drafts on their way to the south or the west, with\r\nthe result that the number of recruits received at Madrid, Seville,\r\nor Salamanca never bore any proper proportion to the total that had\r\ncrossed the Bidassoa.\r\n\r\n  [590] Martinien’s lists show seven officers hit in the 44th Équipage\r\n  de Marine, which joined Masséna in the next month, and six in the\r\n  Bataillon D’Espagne, which was on its way to Cadiz.\r\n\r\n  [591] See Arteche, ix. 241.\r\n\r\nNorthward from Old Castile, on the skirts of the mountains of\r\nSantander and Biscay, the dominating personality among the\r\nguerrilleros was Louga, who afterwards rose to some distinction as a\r\ncommander of regular troops. His special task was the cutting of the\r\ncommunications between Burgos and Bilbao, and Bilbao and Santander;\r\nbut he often co-operated with Porlier, when that restless partisan\r\nmade one of his descents from the Asturian mountains, either on to\r\nthe coast region or on the southern skirts of the Cantabrian sierras.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there were probably never more than 20,000 guerrilleros\r\nin arms at once, in the whole region between the Sierra de Guadarrama\r\nand the shore of the Bay of Biscay. They never succeeded in beating\r\nany French force more than two or three battalions strong, and were\r\nbeing continually hunted from corner to corner. Yet, despite their\r\nweakness in the open field, their intestine quarrels, their frequent\r\noppression of the country-side, and their ferocity, they rendered\r\ngood service to Spain, and incidentally to Great Britain and to all\r\nEurope, by pinning down to the soil twice their own numbers of good\r\nFrench troops. Any one who has read the dispatches of the commandants\r\nof Napoleon’s ‘military governments,’ or the diaries of the officers\r\nwho served in Reille’s or Dorsenne’s or Caffarelli’s flying columns,\r\nwill recognize a remarkable likeness between the situation of affairs\r\nin Northern Spain during 1810 and 1811 and that in South Africa\r\nduring 1900 and 1901. Lightly moving guerrilla bands, unhampered by a\r\nbase to defend or a train to weigh them down, and well served as to\r\nintelligence by the residents of the country-side, can paralyse the\r\naction of an infinitely larger number of regular troops.\r\n\r\nIn the north-east of Spain, where the French were engaged not with\r\nmere scattered bands of guerrilleros, but with two regular armies,\r\nO’Donnell’s Catalans and Caro’s Valencians, the fortune of war took\r\nno decisive turn during the autumn of 1810, though one dreadful blow\r\nto the Spanish cause--the loss of Tortosa--was to fall in the winter\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nWe left Suchet in August 1810, established in his newly-conquered\r\npositions at Lerida and Mequinenza, master of all the plain-land of\r\nAragon, as well as of a strip of Western Catalonia, and only waiting\r\nfor the co-operation of Macdonald and the 7th Corps to recommence\r\nhis operations[592]. That co-operation, however, was long denied\r\nhim. The Emperor’s last general orders, which had reached Suchet in\r\nJune, briefly prescribed to him that the conquest of the city and\r\nkingdom of Valencia was his final object, but that he must first\r\nbreak the Spanish line by capturing Tortosa, the great fortress\r\nof the Lower Ebro, and Tarragona, the main stronghold of Southern\r\nCatalonia[593]. For both these latter operations he was to count\r\non the aid of Macdonald and the Army of Catalonia[594]. Relying on\r\nthis support, Suchet, after less than a month had elapsed since the\r\ncapture of Mequinenza, had pushed his advanced guard down the Ebro,\r\ntill it was at the very gates of Tortosa. One detachment even passed\r\nthe town, and seized the ferry of Amposta, the only passage of the\r\nEbro near its mouth, actually cutting the great road from Tarragona\r\nto Valencia, and only leaving the bridge of Tortosa itself open,\r\nfor the linking of the operations of Caro and O’Donnell. Meanwhile\r\nSuchet was preparing his siege-train at Mequinenza, and waiting for a\r\nrise in the Ebro, which would commence to become navigable with the\r\narrival of the autumn rains, in order to ship his guns down-stream to\r\ntheir destined goal. He was at the same time making the land route to\r\nTortosa passable, by repairing the old military road from Caspe to\r\nMora and Tivisa, which had been constructed during the wars of the\r\nSpanish Succession, but had long ago fallen into ruin.\r\n\r\n  [592] See pp. 300-9.\r\n\r\n  [593] _Correspondance_ under May 29.\r\n\r\n  [594] _Correspondance_ under Sept. 16.\r\n\r\nSuchet was quite aware that by thrusting a comparatively small\r\nforce--he had only brought up 12,000 men--into the near neighbourhood\r\nof Tortosa, he was risking the danger of being attacked at once by\r\nthe Army of Valencia from the south and O’Donnell’s Catalans from\r\nthe north. But he trusted that Macdonald and the 7th Corps would\r\nkeep the latter--the more formidable enemy--employed, while he had\r\na well-founded contempt for the generalship of Caro, who had always\r\nproved himself the most incompetent and timid of commanders. But\r\nMacdonald arrived late, having been forced to spend the whole summer,\r\nas has been already related[595], in his triple revictualling of\r\nBarcelona, and meanwhile the Valencian army came to the front. Its\r\nleading division, under Bassecourt, threatened Morella, on Suchet’s\r\nflank, early in August, hoping to draw him away to defend this\r\noutpost. But a single brigade under Montmarie sufficed to turn back\r\nthe Valencian detachment, and Suchet kept his positions. O’Donnell\r\nmeanwhile, vainly hoping for solid help from Caro, had joined the\r\ndivision of his army which was kept at Falcet[596], and after\r\nthreatening Suchet’s head quarters at Mora on July 30, so as to\r\ndistract his attention, suddenly turned aside and entered Tortosa\r\nwith 2,500 men. Calling out all the troops available for a sortie,\r\nhe issued from the town on August 3, and beat up the outposts of the\r\ndivision under Laval, which was in observation before his gates.\r\nBut though the Catalans fought fiercely, and drove in the first\r\nFrench line, they were not strong enough to push the enemy away from\r\nTortosa. O’Donnell should have brought a heavier force if he intended\r\nto accomplish his end. Shortly after he returned to Tarragona,\r\nwhither he was called by the movements of Macdonald.\r\n\r\n  [595] See p. 311.\r\n\r\n  [596] See p. 313.\r\n\r\nSome days later than he had covenanted, Caro came up to Vinaros,\r\non the coast-road from Valencia, and to San Mateo on the parallel\r\ninland road, with his whole army, including the force which\r\nBassecourt had been commanding. It consisted of no more than 10,000\r\nill-organized troops of the Line, who had been joined by nearly as\r\nmany unregimented peasants in loose guerrilla bands. The whole mass\r\nwas far from being formidable, as Suchet knew. Wherefore the French\r\ngeneral, cutting down to the smallest possible figure the containing\r\ntroops left before Tortosa, and at his head quarters at Mora, marched\r\nwith eleven battalions and a cavalry regiment--only 6,000 men in\r\nall--to meet the Valencians. He drove their advanced cavalry from\r\nVinaros, and advanced against their positions at Calig and Cervera\r\ndel Maestre. Caro at once ordered a precipitate retreat, and did\r\nnot stop till he had placed thirty miles between himself and the\r\nenemy. His obvious terror and dismay at the approach of the French\r\nroused such anger that he was summoned to give up the command by his\r\nown officers, and obeyed without hesitation[597]. He fled by sea to\r\nMajorca, knowing, it is said, that he would have been torn to pieces\r\nif he had shown his face before the populace at Valencia, over which\r\nhe had exercised a sort of dictatorship for more than a year. Suchet,\r\nunable to catch such an evasive enemy, and regarding the routed army\r\nas a negligible quantity, returned to Mora, where he received the\r\nnews that the long-expected Macdonald was at last about to appear\r\n(August 20).\r\n\r\n  [597] For details see Arteche, ix. 267, Schepeler, iv. 659-60, and\r\n  Suchet’s _Mémoires_, vol. i. p. 193. The dictator’s own brother,\r\n  General Juan Caro, was one of those who deposed him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Tarentum had thrown the third and last of his great\r\nconvoys into Barcelona on the 18th of August, having brought with\r\nhim as its escort the French division of his army, which was now\r\ncommanded by Frère[598], and the Italian divisions of Severoli and\r\nPignatelli. He had left behind him General Baraguay d’Hilliers, in\r\nthe position which Reille had been wont to hold, as the defender of\r\nthe Ampurdam and Northern Catalonia as far as Hostalrich. Eighteen\r\nthousand men were told off for this task, including all the German\r\nbrigades; but after garrisoning Gerona, Rosas, Figueras, and\r\nHostalrich, d’Hilliers had no great field-force left, and found\r\nfull employment in warding off the raids of Manso, Rovira, and\r\nthe other miquelete leaders upon the communication between Gerona\r\nand Perpignan. Nearly 10,000 men had also been left in Barcelona,\r\nincluding many sick, and the three divisions with which Macdonald\r\nmarched to join Suchet did not exceed 16,000 sabres and bayonets,\r\nthough the whole force of the 7th Corps was reckoned at over 50,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n  [598] Vice Souham, wounded at Vich, and Augereau recalled.\r\n\r\nOn August 13 Macdonald forced the Pass of Ordal, after some\r\nskirmishing with the somatenes, and entered the plain of Tarragona.\r\nIt was the news of his approach to the Catalan capital which brought\r\nO’Donnell back in haste from Tortosa. He concentrated the greater\r\npart of his troops, on the hypothesis that the 7th Corps might be\r\nintending to lay siege to the place. He brought down Campoverde’s\r\ndivision from the north to join those of Ibarrola, Sarsfield, and\r\nthe Baron de Eroles, which were already on the spot. It soon became\r\nknown, however, to the Spaniards that Macdonald could not be bent\r\non siege operations, for he was bringing with him neither the\r\nheavy artillery nor the enormous train of provisions that would be\r\nrequired in such a case. He marched past Reus and Valls to Momblanch,\r\nskirmishing all the way with O’Donnell’s detachments, and thence\r\nto Lerida, which he reached on August 29. There he found Suchet\r\nawaiting him for a conference. The orders from Paris, on which both\r\nwere acting, seemed to prescribe that Tortosa and Tarragona should\r\nboth be attacked[599]. But the General and the Marshal agreed that\r\ntheir joint strength was not more than enough for one siege at a\r\ntime. They agreed that the 3rd Corps should undertake the leaguer of\r\nTortosa, and ‘the containing’ of the Valencian army, while the 7th\r\nshould cover these operations by keeping O’Donnell and the Catalans\r\nfully employed. Suchet therefore drew his detachments southward from\r\nLerida and the plains of the Segre, handing over all that tract to\r\nMacdonald. From this fertile region alone could the Marshal have\r\nfed his corps, Central Catalonia being barren, and so overrun by\r\nO’Donnell’s detachments that it was impossible to forage freely\r\nwithin its bounds. Suchet undertook to provide for his own corps\r\nduring the siege of Tortosa by bringing up stores from Saragossa\r\nand the valley of the Ebro, via Mequinenza. Macdonald lent him,\r\nmeanwhile, the weakest of his three divisions, 2,500 Neapolitans\r\nunder Pignatelli, who were to escort the siege-train for Tortosa\r\nalong the Ebro, when the autumn rains made the river navigable from\r\nMequinenza to the sea.\r\n\r\n  [599] See Suchet’s _Mémoires_, i. 196-7, and the dispatch from\r\n  Napoleon’s _Correspondance_ of July 25, 1810.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COINS CURRENT IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL IN 1808-14]\r\n\r\nWhile Suchet was moving southward and making ready for the siege, the\r\nDuke of Tarentum established himself with head quarters at Cervera\r\non the Barcelona-Lerida road, and brigades at Lerida, Agramunt, and\r\nTarrega, all in the plain; he was ready to fall upon O’Donnell’s\r\nflank if the Catalans should make any attempt to succour Tortosa, by\r\nmarching from Tarragona along the roads parallel to the sea coast.\r\nMeanwhile he had completely lost touch both with the garrison of\r\nBarcelona and with Baraguay d’Hilliers in the Ampurdam. This was\r\nthe regular state of things during the Catalan war; for if the\r\nFrench left detachments to guard a line of communication, they were\r\ninvariably cut off by the enemy; while, if they did not, the roads\r\nwere blocked and no information came through. So vigorous were the\r\nsomatenes at this moment, that small parties moving from Tarrega to\r\nCervera,--places only twelve miles apart, and in the middle of the\r\ncantonments of the 7th Corps,--were not unfrequently waylaid and\r\ndestroyed. Macdonald, despite his well-known humanity, was forced to\r\nburn villages, and shoot road-side assassins caught red-handed. He\r\nlay in the position which he had taken up on September 4-6 for the\r\ngreater part of that month and the succeeding October, concentrating\r\nat intervals a part of his forces for an expedition into the hills,\r\nwhen the Catalans pressed him too closely. At the commencement of\r\nhis sojourn in the plains, he sent Severoli with an Italian brigade\r\nto collect provisions in the valley of the Noguera Palleresa. This\r\nraid led to dreadful ravaging of the country-side, but Severoli\r\nreturned with no spoil and many wounded. He had pushed his advance\r\nas far as Talarn, skirmishing the whole way, and driving the\r\nsomatenes before him, but could accomplish nothing save the burning\r\nof poor villages evacuated by their inhabitants. A week later other\r\nexpeditions scoured the mountain sides eastward, with little more\r\nsuccess[600].\r\n\r\n  [600] For details see Vacani, iv. pp. 307-8.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though Macdonald imagined that he was not only protecting\r\nSuchet’s northern flank, but also attracting the attention of\r\nO’Donnell to himself, the enterprising Spanish general had contrived\r\nan unwelcome surprise for him. He knew that he was not strong enough\r\nto fight the 7th Corps in the open field, nor even to face Suchet\r\nby making another attempt to relieve Tortosa--which place, for the\r\nmoment, was in no immediate danger. He therefore resolved to draw\r\nMacdonald from his present position, by a blow at the corner of\r\nCatalonia where the French were weakest.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal considered that Baraguay d’Hilliers was perfectly\r\nsafe in the northern region which he garrisoned, since no regular\r\nSpanish force was now in arms in that direction. O’Donnell resolved\r\nto undeceive him. Leaving the two divisions of Obispo and Eroles\r\nto block the road from Macdonald’s post at Cervera to Barcelona,\r\nwith orders to retire into Tarragona if hard pressed, he ordered a\r\nthird division, that of Campoverde, to prepare for a forced march\r\nto the north. At the same time a force, consisting of the British\r\nfrigate _Cambrian_ and the Spanish frigate _Diana_, convoying a\r\nfew transports with 500 men on board for disembarkation, sailed\r\nfrom Tarragona, for a destination which was kept secret to the last\r\nmoment. The troops were under Doyle, the British commissioner in\r\nCatalonia; Captain Fane of the _Cambrian_ was senior naval officer.\r\n\r\nO’Donnell’s march was perilous: he had to pass close to the front\r\nof the garrisons of Barcelona, Hostalrich, and Gerona, through a\r\nmost difficult and mountainous country, without giving any signs\r\nof his presence; for, if his movement were discovered, Baraguay\r\nd’Hilliers might concentrate his scattered brigades, and crush him\r\nby force of numbers. The march, however, was carried out with\r\ncomplete success, and on September 13 O’Donnell lay with 6,000\r\ninfantry and 400 horse at Vidreras, south of Gerona, while the naval\r\nforce was hovering off Palamos, the nearest point on the coast.\r\nThe rough region between Gerona and the sea was at this moment\r\noccupied by half Rouyer’s division of troops of the Confederation\r\nof the Rhine, under Schwartz--the ever-unlucky general whose name\r\nwas connected with the disasters of Bruch[601] and Manresa[602].\r\nHe had with him four weak battalions of the 5th (Anhalt-Lippe)\r\nand 6th (Schwartzburg-Waldeck-Reuss) regiments, and a squadron of\r\ncuirassiers: a force which, owing to the sickliness of the autumn\r\nseason, did not amount to much more than 1,500 men in all. But he\r\nwas so close to Gerona[603], where lay Rouyer’s other two regiments,\r\nand some French troops, that he was not considered in any danger by\r\nhis superiors. Schwartz’s main duty was to prevent any communication\r\nbetween the somatenes of the inland and the cruisers which were\r\nalways passing up and down the coast. Provoked by a recent raid at\r\nBagur, on September 10, where an English landing-party had stormed\r\none of his coast batteries, and captured the garrison of 50 men,\r\nSchwartz had just strengthened all his posts along the shore. He\r\nhad only 700 men at his head quarters at La Bispal; the rest were\r\ndispersed between Bagur, San Feliu, Palamos, and the connecting post\r\nat Calonje. On the morning of the fourteenth he was stricken with\r\nhorror when his outposts informed him that they had been driven in by\r\nSpanish infantry and cavalry in overwhelming force. He sent orders,\r\ntoo late, for his troops on the coast to concentrate, and prepared\r\nto fall back on Gerona with his whole force. But his messenger had\r\nhardly gone when he was attacked by O’Donnell, who drove him into\r\nthe indefensible castle of La Bispal, which was commanded by a\r\nneighbouring hill and the church tower of the village. After losing\r\nsome men shot down from these points of vantage, Schwartz surrendered\r\nat nightfall, when the Spaniards were preparing to storm his refuge.\r\nHis defence cannot have been very desperate, as he had lost only\r\none officer and four men killed, and three officers and sixteen men\r\nwounded. But this was only part of the disaster which befell the\r\nGerman brigade that day: by a careful timing of the attacks Doyle\r\nand Fane stormed Palamos with the landing-force at the same moment\r\nthat La Bispal was being attacked, while Colonel Fleires, with a\r\ndetachment of O’Donnell’s land troops, surprised San Feliu, and\r\nColonel Aldea with another cut off the companies at Calonje. In\r\nall the Spaniards captured on that day one general, two colonels,\r\nfifty-six officers, and 1,183 rank and file, with seventeen guns.\r\nSchwartz’s brigade was absolutely destroyed; only a few stragglers\r\nreached Gerona, from which no help had been sent, because O’Donnell\r\nhad turned loose all the somatenes of the region to demonstrate\r\nagainst the place[604].\r\n\r\n  [601] See vol. i. p. 311.\r\n\r\n  [602] See this vol. p. 295.\r\n\r\n  [603] Only about eighteen miles distant.\r\n\r\n  [604] The best narrative of Schwartz’s disaster may be found in\r\n  the diary of the Lippe-Bückeburg officer Barkhausen, one of the\r\n  prisoners, pp. 110-15.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for Rouyer and Baraguay d’Hilliers to assemble their\r\nforces, O’Donnell departed from the scene of his exploits without\r\ndelay. He himself, having received a severe wound in the foot,\r\nembarked with the prisoners on board Fane’s ships and returned to\r\nTarragona. Campoverde, with the land-force, retired hastily past\r\nGerona to the mountains of the north, retook Puycerda, beat up the\r\noutposts of the French garrison of Montlouis on the frontier of\r\nCerdagne, and raised some contributions on the other side of the\r\nPyrenees. From thence he descended the Segre, and established himself\r\nat Cardona and Calaf, facing Macdonald’s northern flank.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly had the main body of the 7th Corps lost touch with\r\nthe troops left behind at Gerona and in the Ampurdam, that the news\r\nof the disaster of La Bispal only reached Macdonald, via France and\r\nSaragossa, more than a fortnight after it had happened. It alarmed\r\nhim for the safety of the north, but did not suffice to draw him\r\naway from Suchet, as O’Donnell had hoped. The news that the Spanish\r\nraiding division had disappeared from the neighbourhood of Gerona\r\nencouraged him to remain in his present position, which alone made\r\nthe siege of Tortosa possible. Presently he was informed that a\r\nconsiderable force had appeared in his own sphere of operations--this\r\nbeing the same division of Campoverde which had done all the\r\nmischief in the north. He therefore marched on October 18, with\r\ntwo French and two Italian brigades, to attack this new enemy.\r\nOn the next day he occupied Solsona, where the Junta of Upper\r\nCatalonia had hitherto been sitting. The place was found deserted\r\nby its inhabitants, and was plundered; its great cathedral was\r\nburnt--either by accident or design. On the twenty-first, however,\r\nwhen the Marshal came in front of Cardona, he found the town, the\r\ninaccessible castle above it, and the neighbouring heights, manned\r\nby Campoverde’s division, strengthened by several thousand somatenes\r\nof the district. The Italian general Eugenio marched straight at\r\nthe position, with Salme’s French brigade in support, despising his\r\nenemy, and not waiting for the Commander-in-Chief and the reserves.\r\nHe met with a sharp repulse, for the Spaniards charged his columns\r\njust as they drew near the crest, and hurled them down with loss.\r\nMacdonald refused to throw in all his troops, and contented himself\r\nwith bringing off the routed brigade. He then returned to Solsona\r\nand Cervera, much harassed in his retreat by the somatenes. It is\r\ncurious that he did not press the combat further, as he had a large\r\nsuperiority of numbers over the Catalan division, and had not lost\r\nmuch more than 100 men in the first clash[605]. But the position was\r\nformidable, and the Marshal more than once in this campaign showed\r\nhimself averse to taking risks. Perhaps, also, he may have already\r\nmade up his mind to return to the east and abandon Suchet, since\r\nit was at about this time that more disquieting information from\r\nBaraguay d’Hilliers reached him by way of France.\r\n\r\n  [605] Martinien’s invaluable lists show only three Italian and one\r\n  French officer hurt, which agrees well enough with Vacani’s estimate\r\n  of 80 to 100 _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\nThis new budget of troubles contained two main items. The first was\r\nthat the August supplies thrown into Barcelona were nearly exhausted,\r\nand that the town urgently required revictualling. The second was\r\nthat it was impossible to send on the necessary convoys, because of\r\nthe extreme activity of the somatenes, and the inadequate number\r\nof troops left in Northern Catalonia. One considerable train of\r\nwaggons had been captured and destroyed near La Junquera, on the very\r\nfrontier of France, by the Baron de Eroles, who had now taken up\r\nthe command of the northern insurgents. Another was standing fast\r\nat Gerona for want of sufficient escort, a third had been collected\r\nat Perpignan, but dared not start. So pressing was the need for the\r\nrelief of Barcelona, that Macdonald made up his mind that he must\r\nbreak up from his present cantonments--even at the risk of making the\r\nsiege of Tortosa impossible--and transfer himself to the north-east.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on November 4, he commenced a toilsome march by way of\r\nCalaf, Manresa, and Hostalrich to Gerona, where he arrived in safety\r\non the 10th. Campoverde followed him, for some way, by parallel\r\npaths along the mountains, but never dared to strike, the strength\r\nof the 7th Corps when it marched in a mass being too great for him.\r\nIt is probable that the Marshal would have had more trouble if\r\nO’Donnell had been in the field, but that enterprising general was\r\nnot yet healed of the wound which he had received at La Bispal. It\r\nhad gangrened, and he had been sent to Majorca by his physicians,\r\nwho declared that a complete cessation from military work was the\r\nonly chance of saving his life. The interim command was turned over\r\nin November to the senior Lieutenant-General in Catalonia, Miguel\r\nIranzo, a very poor substitute for the hard-fighting Spanish-Irish\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, having joined Baraguay d’Hilliers, had now an imposing\r\nmass of troops under his hand. Moreover, he got back the services of\r\nhis old divisional generals Souham and Pino, who arrived from sick\r\nleave, and took over charge of the divisions lately in the charge of\r\nFrère and Severoli. A great draft from France and Italy had rejoined\r\nin their company. The Marshal was therefore able to collect the\r\nfractions of the great convoy destined for Barcelona, and to conduct\r\nit to that city after a slow and cautious march on November 25. He\r\nthen changed the battalions in the garrison of Barcelona, where he\r\nleft both Pino and Souham, sent back to the Ampurdam the troops he\r\nhad borrowed from Baraguay d’Hilliers, as escort for the returning\r\nconvoy, and marched for the second time to join Suchet; moving by way\r\nof Momblanch, he got once more into touch with the Army of Aragon at\r\nFalcet, near Mora, on December 12.\r\n\r\nThus the campaign came back, at mid-winter, to the same aspect\r\nthat it had shown in the first days of September. It has been the\r\nwont of military critics to throw the blame for the lost three\r\nmonths on Macdonald[606]. But this seems unfair: it is true that\r\nhe was absent from the post which he had promised to hold, for the\r\nprotection of Suchet’s rear, from November 4 to December 13. But why\r\nhad so little been done to forward the siege of Tortosa during the\r\ntime from September 4 to November 4--two whole months--while the\r\nMarshal was in the covenanted position, and actually carrying out\r\nhis promise to contain the Catalans, and leave Suchet’s hands free\r\nfor the actual prosecution of the projected siege? The commander of\r\nthe Army of Aragon had been given two of the best campaigning months\r\nof the year--September and October--and had no enemy about him save\r\nthe ever-unlucky Valencian army, the local somatenes of the Lower\r\nEbro, and the scattered bands of Villacampa in the hills of Upper\r\nAragon. It was only sixty miles from his base at Mequinenza, where\r\nhis siege-train had been collected months before, to the walls of\r\nTortosa, and he had brought up his field army before that place as\r\nearly as August. No doubt the country between Mequinenza and Tortosa\r\nis rough, and its roads execrable, while water-transport along\r\nthe Ebro was rendered more difficult than usual by a rather dry\r\nautumn, which kept the river low. But twenty-six heavy siege-guns\r\nwere got down to Xerta, only ten miles from Tortosa, as early as\r\nSeptember 5, during a lucky flood, while a considerable number more\r\nwere pushed to the front during the same month, by the land route,\r\nformed by Suchet’s new military road from Caspe to Mora. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that Suchet’s inactivity in September and October can be\r\nexplained neither by laying blame on Macdonald, nor by exaggerating\r\nthe difficulties of transport. If, as he wrote himself, ‘Notre corps\r\nd’armée se trouvait enchaîné sur le bas Ebre, sans pouvoir agir, et\r\nson chef n’avait d’espoir que dans une crue d’eau et dans le secours\r\ndes circonstances[607],’ he was himself responsible for his failure,\r\neither from over-caution or because he had undertaken a task beyond\r\nhis means. The real cause of his two months’ delay was the vigorous\r\naction of the enemy. There was no danger from the disorganized\r\nValencian army, which only made a feeble attempt on November 26-27\r\nto beat up the small force under General Musnier, which lay at\r\nUldecona to cover the blockade of Tortosa from the south; the attack,\r\nled by Bassecourt, was driven off with ease. The real opponents of\r\nSuchet were the irregular forces of the Catalans, and the Aragonese\r\ninsurgents in his rear. The former, though few in numbers, since\r\nMacdonald was attracting their main attention, attacked every convoy\r\nthat tried to float down the gorge of the Ebro, and sometimes with\r\nsuccess. On the 15th of September they captured a whole battalion of\r\nPignatelli’s Neapolitans, which was acting as guard to some boats. On\r\nother occasions they took or destroyed smaller or greater portions\r\nof flotillas carrying guns or stores to Xerta, where the siege park\r\nwas being collected. But Villacampa’s Aragonese gave even greater\r\ntrouble; from his lair in the Sierra de Albaracin that enterprising\r\npartisan made countless descents upon Suchet’s rear, and so molested\r\nthe garrisons of Upper Aragon, that the French general had repeatedly\r\nto send back troops from his main body to clear the roads behind him.\r\nVillacampa was beaten whenever he tried to fight large bodies, even\r\nthough he was aided by a General Carbajal, whom the Regency had sent\r\nfrom Cadiz with money and arms, to stir up a general revolt in the\r\nTeruel-Montalban region. The Polish General Chlopiski, detached in\r\nhaste from the blockade of Tortosa, broke the forces of Carbajal and\r\nVillacampa in two successive engagements at Alventosa, on the borders\r\nof Valencia (October 31), and Fuensanta, near Teruel (November 11).\r\nThe insurrection died down, Villacampa retired into his mountains,\r\nand Chlopiski returned to the main army. But only a few days later\r\nSuchet had to cope with a new danger: Macdonald having taken himself\r\noff to Gerona, the Catalans were at last able to detach regular\r\ntroops to reinforce the somatenes of the Lower Ebro. A brigade under\r\nGeneral Garcia Navarro came up to Falcet, opposite Mora, and formed\r\nthe nucleus of a raiding force, which beset the whole left bank of\r\nthe Ebro, and made its navigation almost impossible. Suchet had\r\nto detach against it seven battalions under Abbé and Habert, who\r\nattacked Navarro’s entrenched camp at Falcet on November 12, and\r\nstormed it. The Spanish general, who showed distinguished personal\r\ncourage, and charged valiantly at the head of his reserves, was taken\r\nprisoner with some 300 men. The somatenes fled to the hills again,\r\nand the regulars retired to Reus, near Tarragona, where they were out\r\nof Suchet’s sphere of operations. It was just after this combat that\r\nthe unfortunate Army of Valencia made the useless diversion of which\r\nwe have already spoken[608]. It, at least, kept Suchet busy for a few\r\ndays. By the time that it was over, the greater part of the remaining\r\nsiege-material was ready at Xerta, the water-carriage down the Ebro\r\nhaving become easy since Garcia Navarro’s defeat. When, therefore,\r\nMacdonald’s arrival at Momblanch was reported at Suchet’s head\r\nquarters, and an adequate covering-force was once more placed between\r\nhim and the Catalan army in the direction of Tarragona, the actual\r\nleaguer of Tortosa could at length begin. It lasted, short though\r\nit was, till the New Year of 1811 had come, and must, therefore, be\r\ndescribed not here but in the fourth volume of this work.\r\n\r\n  [606] See especially Napier, iii. 199.\r\n\r\n  [607] Suchet, _Mémoires_, i. 205.\r\n\r\n  [608] See previous page.\r\n\r\nThus six months had elapsed between the fall of Lerida and the\r\ncommencement of the next stage of the French advance in Eastern\r\nSpain. If it is asked why the delay was so long, the answer is easy:\r\nit was due not, as some have maintained, to Suchet’s slowness or to\r\nMacdonald’s caution, but solely to the splendid activity displayed\r\nby Henry O’Donnell, a general often beaten but never dismayed, and\r\nto the tenacity of the Catalans, who never gave up hope, and were\r\nstill to hold their own, after a hundred disasters, till the tide of\r\nsuccess in the Peninsula at last turned back in 1812-13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nKING JOSEPH AND THE CORTES AT CADIZ: GENERAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt only remains that we should deal shortly with the higher politics\r\nof Spain during the last months of 1810--the troubles of King Joseph,\r\nand the complications caused by the meeting of the Cortes at Cadiz.\r\n\r\nOf the growing friction between the King and the commanders of the\r\n‘military governments’ created by the Emperor in February, we have\r\nalready spoken[609]. Joseph did well to be angry when his dispatches\r\nto Saragossa or Barcelona were deliberately disregarded by his\r\nbrother’s special orders. But things became worse, when he was not\r\nmerely ignored, but openly contemned. A few examples may suffice.\r\nIn the early summer a brigade sent out by Marshal Ney raided the\r\nprovince of Avila, which was not included in any of the military\r\ngovernments, raised requisitions there, and--what was still more\r\ninsulting--seized and carried off the treasure in the offices of the\r\ncivil intendant-general of the province[610]. Joseph wrote to Paris\r\nthat ‘the Emperor cannot be desirous that his own brother--however\r\nunworthy--should be openly humiliated and insulted; that he asked\r\nfor justice, and abstained from any further comment’[611]. Napoleon\r\nreplied by placing Avila in the block of provinces allotted to the\r\nArmy of Portugal, and withdrew it for the time from the King’s\r\nauthority. It was soon after that he created Kellermann’s new\r\n‘military government’ of Valladolid, thus taking another region\r\nfrom under the direct authority of Joseph. Some months later\r\nKellermann asserted the complete independence of his viceroyalty,\r\nby causing the judges of the high-court of Old Castile, which sat\r\nat Valladolid, to take a new oath of allegiance to the Emperor of\r\nthe French, as if they had ceased to be subjects of the kingdom of\r\nSpain[612]. Soult, too, continued, as has been shown before, to cut\r\noff all revenues which the King might have received from Andalusia,\r\nand Joseph’s financial position became even worse than it had been in\r\n1809[613].\r\n\r\n  [609] See pp. 201-2 and 316.\r\n\r\n  [610] See p. 242.\r\n\r\n  [611] Joseph to Napoleon. Ducasse’s _Correspondance du Roi Joseph_,\r\n  vii. 278-9. The Emperor gave Avila back to the King in September, see\r\n  Nap. _Correspondance_, xxi. 126.\r\n\r\n  [612] See Miot de Melito’s Diary, Sept. 8, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [613] Joseph to Napoleon, Aug. 25, 1810. Ducasse, vii. 321, and\r\n  ibid., p. 332 of Sept. 12.\r\n\r\nThe summary of his complaints, containing a declaration that he\r\nwished to surrender his crown to the Emperor, was drawn up as the\r\nautumn drew near; it deserves a record; it is absolutely reasonable,\r\nand confines itself to hard facts. ‘Since Your Majesty withdraws\r\nAndalusia from my sphere of command, and orders that the revenues of\r\nthat province should be devoted exclusively to military expenses, I\r\nhave no choice left but to throw up the game. In the actual state\r\nof affairs in Spain the general who commands each province is a\r\nking therein. The whole revenues of the province will never suffice\r\nto keep him; for what he calls his “absolute necessities” have\r\nnever been formally stated, and as the revenues rise he augments\r\nhis “necessities.” Hence it results that any province under the\r\ncommand of a general is useless for my budget. From Andalusia alone\r\nI hoped to get a certain surplus, after all military expenses had\r\nbeen paid. But its command is given over to a general who would\r\nnever recognize my authority; and with the command, he gets the\r\nadministrative and governmental rights. Thus I have been stripped of\r\nthe only region which could have given me a sufficient maintenance.\r\nI am reduced to Madrid [i.e. New Castile], which yields 800,000\r\nfrancs per mensem, while the indispensable expenses of the central\r\ngovernment amount to 4,000,000 francs per mensem. I have around me\r\nthe wrecks of what was once a great national administration, with\r\na guard, the dépôts and hospital of the army, a garrison, a royal\r\nhousehold, a ministry, a council of state, and the refugees from\r\nthe rebel provinces. This state of affairs could not endure for two\r\nmonths longer, even if my honour, and the consciousness of what is\r\ndue to me, would allow me to remain in this humiliating position.\r\nSince the Army of Andalusia has been taken from me, what am I? The\r\nmanager of the hospitals and magazines of Madrid, the head jailer of\r\nthe central dépôt of prisoners!’ Joseph then states his conditions.\r\nIf he is allowed (1) to have a real control over the whole army;\r\n(2) to send back to France officers, of whatever rank, notoriously\r\nguilty of maladministration; (3) to reassure his Spanish partisans\r\nas to rumours current concerning his own forced abdication and the\r\ndismemberment of the monarchy; (4) to issue what proclamations\r\nhe pleases to his subjects, without being placed under a sort of\r\ncensorship, he will retain his crown, and pledge himself to reduce\r\nall Spain, and ‘make the country as profitable to the interests\r\nof France as it is now detrimental.’ If not, he must consider the\r\nquestion of retiring across the Pyrenees and surrendering his\r\ncrown[614].\r\n\r\n  [614] Joseph to Napoleon, Aug. 9, Ducasse, vii. 307.\r\n\r\nNapoleon could not give any such promises, and for good reasons:\r\nhe rightly distrusted his brother’s military ability, and knew\r\nthat--whatever was the title given to Joseph--men like Soult or\r\nMasséna would disregard his orders. Apparently he considered that a\r\nconflict of authorities in Spain, such as had been existing for the\r\nlast six months, was at least better than the concentration of power\r\nin the hands of one indifferent commander-in-chief. It is doubtful\r\nwhether he did not err in his conclusion. Almost anything was better\r\nthan the existing anarchy, tempered by orders, six weeks late, from\r\nParis. But a second, and a more fatal, objection to granting Joseph’s\r\nconditions was that the ‘rumours current concerning the dismemberment\r\nof the Spanish monarchy’ were absolutely true. Napoleon was at\r\nthis moment at the very height of his wild craze for adding alien\r\nand heterogeneous provinces to the French Empire, in the supposed\r\ninterest of the Continental System. It was in 1810 that he declared\r\nHolland and the Valais, Hamburg and Bremen, Oldenburg and Dalmatia,\r\nintegral parts of his dominions. And Northern Spain was destined to\r\nsuffer the same fate. Mina and Rovira, Eroles and Manso, were to\r\nwake some morning to find themselves French subjects! On October 12\r\nthe Emperor wrote to Berthier: ‘You will inform General Caffarelli,\r\nin strict confidence, that my intention is that Biscay shall be\r\nunited to France. He must not speak of this intention, but he must\r\nact with full knowledge of it. Make the same private communication to\r\nGeneral Reille about Navarre[615].’ Aragon, or at least the portion\r\nof it north of the Ebro, and Catalonia were to suffer the same fate.\r\nAlready justice was administered there in the name of the Emperor,\r\nnot in that of the King of Spain, and a coinage was being struck at\r\nBarcelona which no longer bore the name of ‘Joseph Napoleon King of\r\nSpain and the Indies[616].’\r\n\r\n  [615] _Correspondance_, xxi. p. 213.\r\n\r\n  [616] For a specimen, see the plate of coins in vol. ii, facing p.\r\n  478.\r\n\r\nThe line of argument which Napoleon adopted with regard to this\r\nproposed annexation is very curious. His directions to his Foreign\r\nMinister, Champagny, run as follows[617]: ‘Herewith I send you back\r\nthe Spanish documents with six observations, which are to serve as\r\nthe base for negotiation. But it is important that you should broach\r\nthe matter gently. You must first state clearly what are my opinions\r\non the Convention of Bayonne [viz. that the Emperor regards his\r\nguarantee of the integrity of Spain as out of date and cancelled].\r\nThen speak of Portugal[618], and next of the expense that this\r\ncountry [Spain] costs me. Then let the Spanish envoys have time to\r\nreflect, and only after an interval of some days tell them that I\r\nmust have the left bank of the Ebro, as an indemnity for the money\r\nand all else that Spain has cost me down to this hour. I think that,\r\nas in all negotiations, we must not show ourselves too much in a\r\nhurry.’ The mention of Portugal means that the Emperor contemplated\r\nmaking his brother a present of the Lusitanian realm, where Spain\r\nwas hated only one degree less than France, as a compensation for\r\nCatalonia and the rest. On the same morning that Mina found himself\r\na Frenchman, all the Ordenança of the Beira hills were to discover\r\nthat they were Castilians! Mad disregard of national feeling could go\r\nno further.\r\n\r\n  [617] Napoleon to Champagny, Sept. 9, 1810.\r\n\r\n  [618] I cannot find anywhere any authority for Napier’s strange\r\n  statement (iii. p. 261) that it was Almenara, and not Napoleon, who\r\n  started the idea that Portugal should be exchanged for the Ebro\r\n  Province. The nearest thing to it is that ‘M. d’Almenara déclare\r\n  formellement qu’il ne consente à aucune cession de territoire\r\n  espagnol, que cette compensation [Portugal] ne soit pas stipulée et\r\n  garantie; mais comme il est dans l’intention formelle du roi de ne\r\n  pas consentir à aucun démembrement, même avec une compensation plus\r\n  avantageuse, il n’aurait jamais ratifié un pareil traité.’ Ducasse,\r\n  _Correspondance_, vii. 190.\r\n\r\nA letter to the French ambassador at Madrid explained at much greater\r\nlength the Emperor’s reasons for breaking the oath that he had sworn\r\nto his brother at Bayonne, when he named him King of Spain. ‘When\r\nthe promise was made, His Majesty had supposed that he had rallied\r\nto his cause the majority of the Spanish nation. This has proved not\r\nto be the case: the whole people took arms, the new king had to fly\r\nfrom Madrid, and was only restored by French bayonets. Since then he\r\nhas hardly rallied a recruit to his cause; it is not the King’s own\r\nlevies that have fought the rebels: it is the 400,000 French sent\r\nacross the Pyrenees who have conquered every province. Therefore\r\nall these regions belong not to the King, but to the Emperor, by\r\nplain right of conquest. He intends, for this reason, to regard the\r\nTreaty of Bayonne as null; it has never been ratified by the Spanish\r\nnation. One only chance remains to the King: let him prevail upon\r\nthe newly-assembled Cortes at Cadiz to acknowledge him as their\r\nsovereign, and to break with England. If that can be done, the\r\nEmperor may revert to his first intentions, and ratify the Treaty of\r\nBayonne, except that he must insist on a “rectification of frontiers\r\nsufficient to give him certain indispensable positions”’--presumably\r\nSan Sebastian, Pampeluna, Figueras, Rosas, &c.[619]\r\n\r\n  [619] Napoleon to Laforest, ambassador at Madrid, Nov. 7.\r\n\r\nThe mere first rumour of his brother’s intentions, transmitted\r\nby Almenara and the Duke of Santa-Fé, his ambassadors ordinary\r\nand extraordinary at Paris, drove Joseph to despair. ‘The Spanish\r\nnation,’ he wrote[620], ‘is more compact in its opinions, its\r\nprejudices, its national egotism, than any other people of Europe.\r\nThere are no Catholics and Protestants here, no new and old\r\nSpaniards; and they will all suffer themselves to be hewn in pieces\r\nrather than allow the realm to be dismembered. What would the\r\ninhabitants of the counties round London say if they were menaced\r\nwith being declared no longer English? What would Provençals or\r\nLanguedocians say if they were told that they were to cease to be\r\nFrenchmen? My only chance here is to be authorized to announce that\r\nthe promise that Spain should not be dismembered will be kept. If\r\nthat is granted, and the generals who have misbehaved are recalled\r\nto France, all may be repaired. If not, the only honourable course\r\nfor me is to retire into private life, as my conscience bids me,\r\nand honour demands.’ On November 18, after having received more\r\nformal news of the Emperor’s intentions from his envoys, Joseph\r\ndeclared that the die was cast: he would return to his castle of\r\nMortefontaine, or to any other provincial abode in France that he\r\ncould afford to purchase, as soon as his brother’s resolve was made\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n  [620] Joseph to the Queen of Spain, Oct. 12. Ducasse,\r\n  _Correspondance_, vii. 355.\r\n\r\nYet the crisis never came to a head. The annexation of the Ebro\r\nprovinces was never published, though private assurances of their\r\nimpending fate were laid before the Spanish ministers and the King.\r\nWhat caused the Emperor to hesitate, when all was prepared? The\r\nanswer may be found in his dispatch to Laforest on November 7: ‘I\r\nneed hardly warn you,’ he writes, ‘that these insinuations (the\r\nultimatum to the King) are to be made only on condition that the\r\nFrench army has entered Lisbon, and that the English have taken to\r\ntheir ships.’ And again, ‘The Emperor is acting in sincerity: if\r\nin reality the capture of Lisbon, and an offer from the cabinet of\r\nMadrid, might possibly decide the rebels to treat, His Majesty might\r\nconsent, &c., &c.’ It was the Lines of Torres Vedras which saved King\r\nJoseph from abdication and Spain from dismemberment. The evacuation\r\nof Portugal by Wellington was the indispensable preliminary to\r\nthe carrying out of the great annexation scheme: its completion\r\nwas deferred till the ominous silence of Masséna should be ended\r\nby a triumphant dispatch proclaiming the capture of Lisbon. Since\r\nthat dispatch never came, Napoleon kept postponing his ultimatum.\r\nThen followed the news, delivered at Paris by Foy on November 21,\r\nshowing that Masséna had been brought to a standstill. Even then the\r\nEmperor’s plan was kept back, not abandoned. It was not till the Army\r\nof Portugal had recoiled in despair and disarray to the banks of the\r\nCoa that Napoleon abandoned his cherished scheme, and consented to\r\ntreat with his brother on reasonable terms. But Joseph’s visit to\r\nParis in the spring of 1811 and its consequences belong to another\r\nchapter of this history. It must suffice here to point out that\r\nhe spent all the winter of 1810-11 in a state of mental anguish,\r\nexpecting every day to be forced to publish his abdication[621], and,\r\nmeanwhile, living a life of shifts and worries--selling his last\r\nsilver plate to feed his courtiers[622], and exchanging an endless\r\ncorrespondence of remonstrances and insinuations with Soult and the\r\ncommanders of the ‘military governments’ of the North[623]. Even\r\nfrom the military point of view he did not consider himself safe;\r\nthe Empecinado and other guerrillero chiefs carried their incursions\r\nup to the very gates of Madrid; and La Mancha, from which, by the\r\nEmperor’s orders, much cavalry had been withdrawn for the benefit of\r\nSoult[624], was frequently raided by detachments from Blake’s Army of\r\nMurcia. ‘À chaque instant du jour et de la nuit,’ wrote the unhappy\r\nsovereign, ‘je suis exposé à monter à cheval pour défendre ma vie\r\ncontre les bandes exaspérées des insurgés, qui entourent Madrid:\r\ncette ville est aux avant-postes[625].’\r\n\r\n  [621] See his letters to his wife in December 1810 and January 1811,\r\n  about his brother’s ‘mauvaises dispositions à mon égard.’\r\n\r\n  [622] He writes that at his most splendid State banquets nothing but\r\n  china is now to be seen on his table.\r\n\r\n  [623] The question of the Consuls and Soult (mentioned in an earlier\r\n  chapter) crops up again in Joseph to Berthier, Nov. 28.\r\n\r\n  [624] Napoleon to Berthier, Oct. 4, orders Digeon’s brigade of\r\n  Lahoussaye’s dragoons to cross the Sierra Morena, thus leaving the\r\n  king only four regiments of French cavalry in New Castile.\r\n\r\n  [625] Ducasse, _Correspondance_, vii. p. 361.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the other government which claimed to be the legal\r\nrepresentative of Spanish nationality was even more truly ‘aux\r\navant-postes.’ The Cortes had assembled at Cadiz, where the booming\r\nof the French cannon was perpetually heard, and where an occasional\r\nshell from Villantroys’ celebrated mortars would plump harmlessly\r\ninto the sand of the Peninsula or the outskirts of the town itself.\r\nThe Cortes had opened its sessions on September 24, though less than\r\nhalf its members had assembled. The difficulty of collecting them had\r\nbeen very great, since all had to arrive by sea, and many had to come\r\nfrom regions very remote, such as Asturias, Galicia, or Catalonia.\r\nThe assembly could not be called satisfactory or representative. The\r\nscheme drawn up for its election by the commission that had sat in\r\nthe preceding winter was complicated. There was to be a deputy for\r\nevery 50,000 souls throughout Spain; but the form of selection was\r\nindirect: the villages chose each one primary elector; the primary\r\nelectors met at the chief town of the district to choose a second\r\nbody of secondary electors; the secondary electors chose a final\r\ncommittee for the whole province (_Junta provincial electoral_) and\r\nthese last, aided by the Governor, Archbishop, and Intendant of the\r\nprovince, nominated the deputies. But this complicated system could\r\nonly work in the regions which were in the hands of the patriots.\r\nOnly Valencia, Murcia, Estremadura, the Balearic Isles, and Galicia\r\nwere wholly free at the moment. In Catalonia the capital, Barcelona,\r\nand large tracts of the country were occupied by the French. In the\r\nAsturias three-quarters of the province were held down by Bonnet.\r\nThe two Castiles, Andalusia (excepting Cadiz), Biscay, Navarre,\r\nLeon, and Aragon were entirely or almost entirely in the hands of\r\nthe enemy. The delegates supposed to represent them were either\r\nchosen in hole-and-corner meetings of insurgent juntas lurking in\r\nsome remote fastness, or--where even this semblance of local election\r\nwas not possible--by nomination by the Regency, or in wholly casual\r\nassemblies of the natives of those districts who chanced to be in\r\nCadiz at the time. The representatives of Madrid, for example,\r\nwere chosen in this fashion by the body of exiles from that city\r\nmeeting in the spacious courtyard of a large public building[626].\r\nThe result of this informal and irregular method of choice was that\r\nmany provinces purported to be represented by deputies who had no\r\nreal local influence therein, but had chanced to commend themselves\r\nto the insurgent juntas, or to the persons--in some cases a mere\r\nhandful--who happened to have fled from that particular region to\r\nCadiz. It is said that the very names, and much more the persons, of\r\na good many of the deputies were absolutely unknown to their supposed\r\nconstituents. Most of all was this the case with the members of\r\nthe Cortes who were supposed to represent Spanish America. It had\r\nbeen decreed by the late Central Junta that the colonies formed an\r\nintegral part of the Spanish monarchy, and were therefore entitled to\r\nrepresentation. But the modest number of twenty-six members allotted\r\nto them were elected at Cadiz, by a committee of Americans nominated\r\nby the Regency from those who happened to be resident in that town.\r\nMost of the deputies were out of touch with the people beyond the\r\nseas, of whom they were theoretically the delegates.\r\n\r\n  [626] Argüelles, _Cortes de Cadiz_, p. 160.\r\n\r\nThis fact was specially unfortunate when the first symptoms of\r\ndiscontent and sedition in Buenos Ayres, Mexico, and the Caraccas\r\nhad begun to show themselves. Though few realized it as yet, the\r\ninsurrection of Spanish America was just about to break forth. The\r\nleast foreseen of all the results of Napoleon’s aggressions in Old\r\nSpain was that the colonies, which had been called upon to take their\r\npart in the national war against the French, and had been promised\r\na share in the administration of the empire, should accept the\r\nshow of freedom and equality that was offered in a serious spirit.\r\nThe Americans demanded that they should no longer be treated as\r\nsubjects and tributaries of the mother country, but recognized as\r\npossessing rights and interests of their own, which must be taken\r\ninto consideration when the general governance of the dominions\r\nof Ferdinand VII was in question. And these rights and interests\r\nincluded not only a claim to such self-government as other Spanish\r\nprovinces possessed, but a demand that their commercial and economic\r\nneeds should no longer be subordinated to the convenience of the\r\nmother country. The colonies could not see why the monopoly of all\r\ntheir trade should be left in the hands of the merchants of Old\r\nSpain. They wished to traffic on their own account with Great Britain\r\nand the United States. This claim was one which no inhabitant of Old\r\nSpain could view with equanimity. The monopoly of South American\r\ncommerce had always been believed to be the most essential item in\r\nthe greatness of the realm. It had been preserved almost as strictly\r\nin the eighteenth century as in the seventeenth or sixteenth. The old\r\n_Asiento_, which gave Great Britain a minute share in that commerce,\r\nhad been conceived to be a humiliation and a disgrace to the king who\r\ngranted it. Spain had fought more than once to preserve the American\r\nmonopoly--it is only necessary to allude to the war of ‘Jenkins’s\r\nEar’ to show what she was prepared to face in its defence.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the mother country was in such desperate straits, the\r\nquestions of American self-government and American trade were raised\r\nin the crudest form. Great Britain had provoked the distrust of her\r\nSpanish allies by many of her acts, even when they were done in good\r\nfaith and with no ulterior motive. But the most irritating of all\r\nwas the request, which had been already made more than once in a\r\ntentative fashion, for a measure of free trade with South America.\r\nWellington had recommended that the point should not be pressed,\r\nwhen Spain was in her extremity; but it was inevitable that since\r\nnearly all British subjects, and nearly all Americans, were desirous\r\nto see the old barriers removed, the question should crop up again\r\nand again. The opening of the American trade was the only return\r\nthat Spain could make for the aid that Great Britain had now been\r\ngiving her for more than two years of war. When Canning in 1809 wrote\r\nthat ‘in questions of commerce any proper occasion must be used to\r\nrecommend a more enlarged and liberal policy than has hitherto been\r\nacted upon in Spain,’ it is easy to see what was in his mind. The\r\nministers in power in 1810 were mostly of the same opinion. But to\r\nask for free trade with America in the year when Hidalgo was making\r\nhis first rising in Mexico, and the _cabildos_ on the Rio de la Plata\r\nwere quietly substituting municipal self-government for the ancient\r\nautocratic rule of their viceroys, was to provoke acute suspicion.\r\nIn 1806-7 Great Britain had backed Miranda and other colonial\r\nseparatists, either with the hope of getting a footing for herself\r\nin South America, or at least with that of establishing republics\r\nwhich would grant her all the commercial privileges that she asked.\r\nThe successive Spanish governments of 1808-10 could never convince\r\nthemselves that the scheme had been completely dropped, and mistook\r\nBritish demands for open trade with America for a desire to sever the\r\ndiscontented colonies from their mother country. The most unpopular\r\nact of the Regency of 1810 was their decree of May 7, issued, as\r\nall Spaniards held, in base subservience to their allies, which had\r\ngranted England and Portugal a certain limited right of exchanging\r\ntheir products with the colonies, on paying the heavy customs-due of\r\nten and a half or fifteen and a half per cent[627]. So great was the\r\ncry raised against it in Cadiz that the Regency was cowardly enough\r\nto cancel it on June 22, under the pretext that it had not been\r\nratified in a session at which all its members were present!\r\n\r\n  [627] For details see Schepeler, iii. p. 691. The goods must also be\r\n  carried in Spanish vessels, so the grant was not a very liberal one!\r\n\r\nBut it was not the American question alone which lay as a source of\r\ndanger before the newly-assembled Cortes, nor was it the American\r\ndeputies alone who misrepresented their constituents. Speaking\r\nin general, it may be said that the whole assembly showed a\r\ndisproportionate number of liberals, when the relative numbers of the\r\ndemocratic and the conservative parties throughout Spain were taken\r\ninto consideration. The events of the next ten years were to show\r\nthat the _Serviles_, as their opponents called them, were really in a\r\nmajority in the whole country-side and in many towns. If that had not\r\nbeen so, Ferdinand VII could not have restored autocratic government\r\nwith such ease when the Peninsular War was over. Reactionaries of\r\nthe blackest dye, who would have liked to restore the Inquisition,\r\nand would have put back the press into the shackles which it had\r\nendured before 1807, were probably in a clear majority in the nation.\r\nThe clerical interest was in many ways the mainstay of the War of\r\nIndependence, and the clergy, with very few exceptions, would gladly\r\nhave gone back to the system of the eighteenth century[628]. The\r\nmajority of the old official class sympathized with them, and the\r\npeasantry were almost everywhere under their control. On the other\r\nhand, the liberals, if all shades of them were reckoned together,\r\nhad a clear majority in the Cortes, both because the regions which\r\nwere properly represented in that assembly chanced to be those\r\nin which they were most numerous, and because they had secured a\r\ndisproportionate number of the seats belonging to the lost provinces,\r\nwhich had been filled up by more or less fictitious elections within\r\nthe walls of Cadiz. That town itself was the least conservative place\r\nin Spain, and the refugees who had served as electors because they\r\nhappened to be on the spot, were not drawn from the bulk of the\r\npopulation--were neither priests nor peasants,--but mainly came from\r\nthose sections of the upper and middle classes where liberal opinions\r\nhad made more progress.\r\n\r\n  [628] Liberal clergy of the type of the journalist Blanco-White\r\n  (Leucadio Doblado) were rare exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe Cortes on the whole was a democratic body: Spain, on the whole,\r\nwas reactionary. The number of those who hated Napoleon because they\r\nregarded him as the enemy of the Church, the jailer of the Pope,\r\nand the breaker-up of old laws, was much greater than that of those\r\nwho hated him because he was the embodiment of autocracy, and the\r\nfoe of all free self-government. Intense national pride was common\r\nto both parties, and all could unite against a foe whose aim was\r\nthe dismemberment of Spain. But the union was made difficult by the\r\nfact that men who had imbibed, more or less consciously, some of the\r\n‘Principles of 1789’ had to co-operate with men who looked back on\r\nthe régime of Philip II as a Golden Age. ‘I can see no prospect of\r\nLiberty behind the crowd of priests who everywhere stand foremost to\r\ntake the lead of our patriots. I cannot look for any direct advantage\r\nfrom the feeling which prompts the present resistance to Napoleon,\r\nas it arises chiefly from an inveterate attachment to the religious\r\nsystem whence our present degradation takes source. If the course\r\nof events enables us to attempt a political reform, it will be by\r\ngrafting the feeble shoots of Liberty upon the stock of Catholicism,\r\nan experiment which has hitherto, and must ever, prove abortive’\r\nwrote a desponding Liberal[629]. How could the writer of such words\r\nand his friends work cordially in company with such fanatics as\r\nthe Estremaduran deputy who, in one of the earlier sessions of the\r\nCortes, proposed the astonishing motion that, in spite of all that\r\nhad happened since 1807, ‘the Inquisition remains in full possession\r\nof its ancient authority, and can make free use of all the powers\r\nwhich it has ever enjoyed in the past[630].’ There were others\r\nwho objected to the use of the dangerous word ‘constitution,’ and\r\neven to the phrase _las leyes de España_, as implying an authority\r\nindependent of the crown[631].\r\n\r\n  [629] Doblado’s Letters, p. 392.\r\n\r\n  [630] Motion by one Francisco Maria Riesco, deputy, and formerly\r\n  Inquisitor, at Llerena in Estremadura. Argüelles’s _Las Cortes de\r\n  Cadiz_, p. 209.\r\n\r\n  [631] See below, p. 520.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the form in which the Cortes had been\r\nsummoned was new and experimental, that the elections had been--even\r\naccording to that form--irregular, that no single member was\r\naccustomed to parliamentary usages, that the parties represented in\r\nit held views of the most divergent kinds, the wonder is not that\r\nthe assembly displayed many weaknesses, but that it did no worse.\r\nObservers of a pessimistic frame of mind had feared that it would\r\nbreak up altogether after a few stormy sittings. ‘It was too full,’\r\nwrote the regent Lardizabal, ‘of youths, and of men who yesterday\r\nwere mere adventurers, without any practice in command, knowledge\r\nof business, or experience of the world. Whole provinces were\r\nrepresented by deputies whom they had not chosen, and were expected\r\nto conform to a constitution, and to accept sweeping reforms, made\r\nby men to whom they had given no mandate, faculty, or authority to\r\ntake such changes into consideration. For neither the Regency, nor\r\neven the King, had the legal right to nominate deputies: no one could\r\nchoose them save the provinces or cities which were integral parts of\r\nthe nation, and no one could claim to represent a province save the\r\nmen to whom that same province had given powers, and instructions to\r\nact in conformity with its wishes.’\r\n\r\nThis motley assembly, so many of whose members were of doubtful\r\nlegitimacy, held its opening session on September 24, 1810. The\r\nmeeting-place was not within the walls of Cadiz itself, but in the\r\nlarge suburban town of La Isla, in the centre of the great island\r\nof Leon, which forms the outwork of the city. It was hoped that\r\nthe six miles which separated its sitting-place from Cadiz would\r\nprevent interruption by popular demonstrations, such as had been so\r\npernicious to the French chamber during the Revolution. The Cortes\r\nhad as their home the large but bare theatre of San Fernando, which\r\nhad been roughly fitted up with benches and tribunes. After high\r\nmass had been celebrated by the old Cardinal Bourbon, the only male\r\nmember of the royal family who was not in captivity[632], the Regency\r\ndeclared the session opened, and then withdrew, after a brief speech\r\nby the Senior Regent, the Bishop of Orense, who bade the assembly\r\nconstitute itself in due form and elect its president and secretaries.\r\n\r\n  [632] He was of the same branch as the Countess of Chinchon,\r\n  Godoy’s wife, being son of Luis, youngest child of Philip V, by a\r\n  quasi-morganatic marriage with a lady of the name of Vallabriga.\r\n\r\nThis was done with no delay; the president chosen was a Catalan,\r\nRamón Lazaro de Dou, while the two secretaries were Evaristo Perez de\r\nCastro and Manuel Lujan. Both of them were well known to entertain\r\nLiberal opinions, and their choice marked the predominance of their\r\nparty in the Cortes. Sitting till midnight was long past, the\r\nassembly passed six decrees drawn up by Muñoz Torrero, one of the\r\nfew clerical deputies who held Liberal views, and Manuel Lujan. By\r\nthese the Cortes declared itself in possession of supreme power in\r\nthe State, but resolved that, of the three branches of authority--the\r\nlegislative, the executive, and the judicial--it intended to take\r\nonly the first-named under its own charge, handing over the executive\r\nto the late Regency, and the judicial to the ordinary courts of law.\r\nThe Regency should be responsible to the Cortes for all its acts of\r\nadministration, and liable to be called to account. It was ordered\r\nto make an instant oath of obedience to the assembly, ‘recognizing\r\nthe sovereignty of the nation represented by the deputies of this\r\ngeneral and extraordinary Cortes.’ This Castaños and the other\r\nregents did with an ill grace, all save the Bishop of Orense, who\r\nmisliked the oath, contending that its terms spoke of the nation\r\nas being sovereign in its own right, without consideration of the\r\nKing’s indefeasible majesty[633]. He would not swear, and so vacated\r\nhis place. He did not lose much by his early dismissal, for on\r\nOctober 28 the Cortes abruptly deposed his four colleagues--Castaños,\r\nLardizabal, Saavedra, and Escaño--and replaced them by a new Regency\r\nof three members. These were Joaquim Blake, that most unlucky of\r\ngenerals; Admiral Cisgar, then commanding the Cartagena squadron,\r\nwho passed as an able administrator; and an obscure naval captain,\r\nPedro Agar, of whom little was known save that he was American born,\r\nand might, therefore, theoretically represent the colonies. The\r\nchange in regents was decidedly for the worse as far as character and\r\nability went. Apparently the Cortes were jealous of an administration\r\nwhose power was older than their own, and had not originally been\r\ncreated by them. They wished to have an executive more entirely\r\ndependent on themselves. Some of the Liberals pretended that the\r\nold regents were plotting to hold a sort of ‘Pride’s Purge’ of the\r\nCortes, and to restore themselves to power. But of this no proof\r\nwas ever given[634]. Considering the difficult times which they had\r\npassed through, and their well-intentioned if rather feeble attempt\r\nto serve the state, Castaños and his colleagues deserved a better\r\nfate than arbitrary dismissal, without thanks, and with a tacit\r\naccusation of treason laid to their charge.\r\n\r\n  [633] ‘Que la nación era soberana _con el rey_, desde luego prestaría\r\n  el juramento pedido. Pero si se entendía que la nación era soberana\r\n  _sin el rey_, y soberana de su mismo soberano, nunca se sometería á\r\n  tal doctrina.’ See more of his argument in Toreno, ii. 225.\r\n\r\n  [634] Compare Toreno’s insinuation against the Regent Lardizabal (ii.\r\n  213), to whom he ascribes a definite plot, with Arteche’s defence and\r\n  eulogy of the late Regency, ix. 109-11.\r\n\r\nBetween the time of the first assembly of the Cortes and the change\r\nin the Regency an infinite number of subjects had been dealt with.\r\nThe Liberal majority, led by Agustin Argüelles, had decreed liberty\r\nof the Press in all political discussions, but very illogically\r\nrefused it for discussions on matters of religion. They had abolished\r\nall feudal rights and privileges of nobility. They passed a decree\r\nof amnesty for all rebels in America who should lay down their\r\narms, and proposed many projects for improving the position of the\r\nColonies, few of which, unfortunately, happened to bear any relation\r\nto the chief grievances under which the South Americans conceived\r\nthemselves to be labouring. The insurrection still went on, and,\r\nthough the mother country was placed in such a desperate condition,\r\ntroops were actually withdrawn from the Murcian army to sail with\r\nGeneral Elio, who was directed to restore order at Buenos Ayres and\r\nin the provinces of the Rio de la Plata. Discussions continued,\r\nwith much heat and a considerable amount of eloquence, on many\r\nother points, during the early days of the Junta. The subjects of\r\ndebate were generally constitutional, occasionally financial. It was\r\nworthy to be observed that the two topics on which all the deputies\r\nrallied together were the question of opposition to the French, and\r\nthe question of the defence of their own sovereign rights. Even the\r\nmajority of the _Serviles_ would join with the Liberals whenever any\r\ndoubt was raised with regard to the right of the Cortes to arrogate\r\nto itself the title of Majesty or the attributes of supreme power.\r\nWhen, for example, the Bishop of Orense refused to take the oath of\r\nobedience, several clericals of most reactionary views took part\r\nagainst him; and when a few weeks later the Marqués del Palacio,\r\nnamed as a deputy-regent during the absence of Blake, also displayed\r\nreluctance to swear to the same form on similar grounds, he did not\r\nreceive the report that he had expected from the reactionaries.\r\nIndeed, he was put under arrest for some time, without, as it seems,\r\nany attempt to protect him being made by the _Serviles_. Like the\r\nBishop of Orense, he ended by swallowing his scruples and accepting\r\nthe prescribed formula[635].\r\n\r\n  [635] Toreno, ii. pp. 222-3.\r\n\r\nA similar desire to assert its own absolute supremacy impelled the\r\nCortes to refuse to countenance two dynastic intrigues which came\r\nfrom different quarters. The eldest daughter of Charles IV, Carlotta,\r\nPrincess of the Brazils and wife of the Regent João of Portugal,\r\nwas the nearest of kin to Ferdinand VII who had escaped Napoleon’s\r\nclaws in 1808. She was of opinion that she had a good right to\r\nexpect the Regency during her brother’s captivity at Valençay, and\r\nher agents repeatedly urged her claims, both during the days of the\r\nfirst Regency and after the Cortes had assembled. Sousa-Holstein,\r\nthe Portuguese ambassador, naturally lent them his aid, and she\r\nhad Spanish partisans, though few of them were persons of good\r\nreputation. Yet, by constant persuasion and promises, Carlotta’s\r\nrepresentatives actually succeeded in inducing great numbers of the\r\ndeputies to pledge themselves to push her interests. It is said\r\nthat, at one time or another, a full half of the members had given\r\nthe intriguers encouragement. But to do this, and to make a formal\r\nattempt to pass a decree conferring the Regency on her, were very\r\ndifferent things. When overt action was urged by her agents, or their\r\npartisans in the Cortes, nothing came of the attempt. The assembly\r\nwas naturally unwilling to surrender its own sovereignty, and to\r\nintroduce a court and its intrigues into Cadiz. It must be added\r\nthat João of Portugal had no liking for his wife’s scheme, that\r\nWellington saw its disadvantages[636], and that the great bulk of\r\nthe Spaniards would have resented the whole affair, as a Portuguese\r\nintrigue, if it had ever been laid before the nation as a definite\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n  [636] See Wellington to Henry Wellesley, Nov. 4, 1810:--‘If the\r\n  Princess of the Brazils be the person appointed regent, the Court\r\n  will be inundated with intriguers of all nations, and attended by\r\n  other evils.’\r\n\r\nThe second dynastic scheme which was running its course at this time\r\nwas engineered by another branch of the Spanish royal house. The\r\nrestless and unscrupulous Queen Caroline of Sicily could not forget\r\nthat if Carlotta of Portugal was the nearest relative of the captive\r\nKing, yet her husband Ferdinand was his nearest male kinsman, save\r\nthe princes in Napoleon’s hands. She availed herself of this fact\r\nto urge that one of her children would be a very suitable person to\r\nbe entrusted with power in Spain, and thought of her younger son\r\nPrince Leopold as a possible candidate for the Regency. But since he\r\nhad not the necessary reputation or age, the Queen soon fell back\r\nupon her son-in-law Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, the exiled son\r\nof the infamous Philippe Égalité. He had not only a good military\r\nrecord for his services at Jemappes and elsewhere in the early\r\nBelgian campaigns, but was universally known as a man of ability.\r\nUnfortunately, he had fought on the Republican side in 1792--a thing\r\nhard to forget, and certain to cause suspicion: and his ability was\r\nalways displayed for purposes of self-interest, and savoured of\r\nunscrupulousness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Orleans had already made overtures to the old Regency\r\nin the spring of 1810, and had been promised by them a command on the\r\nborders of Catalonia. They had failed to keep the pledge, and he now\r\nappeared at Cadiz, and wished to present himself before the Cortes\r\nand plead his cause. He took small profit thereby, for the assembly\r\nregarded him and his relatives as suspicious persons, refused to\r\ngive him an audience when he presented himself before its doors, and\r\npolitely but firmly insisted that he should return to Sicily in a\r\nfew days--an order which he was forced to obey. ‘Whether it was that\r\nhe was a Frenchman, though a Bourbon, or whether it was that he had\r\nonce been a Republican, though he had ceased to be one, or whether\r\nit was that he was a prince of the royal house, and therefore\r\ndistasteful to the newly-assembled Cortes, who were secretly inclined\r\nto democratic views, the majority viewed him with disfavour[637].’ On\r\nOctober 3 he set sail for Palermo.\r\n\r\n  [637] See Galiano, quoted by Arteche, ix. 76.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1810 we leave the Cortes still indulging in fiery\r\nconstitutional debates, still busy in asserting its own supreme\r\npower, and curbing many attempts at self-assertion in the new Regency\r\nwhich it had created. With the English government it was not on the\r\nbest of terms: though it decreed the erection of a statue to George\r\nIII as the friend and deliverer of Spain--a monument which (it need\r\nhardly be said) was never erected--it was very slow to seek or\r\nfollow the advice of the allied power. It clamoured for subsidies,\r\nbut refused the opening of the South American trade--the only return\r\nthat could be given for them. Money in hard gold or silver Great\r\nBritain could no longer supply--for the years 1810-11 were those\r\nwhen the paper-issues of the Bank were our sole currency; cash had\r\nalmost disappeared, and could only be procured by offering six pounds\r\nor more in notes for five guineas. But the Spaniards did not want\r\npaper, but gifts or loans in gold or silver. They got no more of\r\nthe precious metals--Great Britain had none to spare, and found it\r\nalmost impossible even to procure dollars to pay Wellington’s army in\r\nPortugal. All that was given after 1809 was arms and munitions of war.\r\n\r\nEnglish observers in the Peninsula were not well pleased with the\r\nfirst months of the rule of the Cortes. ‘The natural course of\r\nall popular assemblies,’ wrote Wellington to his brother, Henry\r\nWellesley, now minister at Cadiz, ‘and of the Spanish Cortes among\r\nothers, is to adopt democratic principles, and to vest all the\r\npowers of the State in their own body. This assembly must take care\r\nthat they do not run in that tempting course, as the wishes of the\r\nnation are decidedly for monarchy. Inclination to any other form of\r\ngovernment would immediately deprive them of the confidence of the\r\npeople, and they would become a worse government, and more impotent,\r\nbecause more numerous, than the old Central Junta.’ A few weeks later\r\nhe doubted whether even a Regency under Carlotta of Portugal, with\r\nall its disadvantages, would not be better than mere democracy[638].\r\n\r\n  [638] Wellington to Henry Wellesley, from Cartaxo, Nov. 21, 1810.\r\n\r\nVaughan, on the spot at Cadiz, gave quite a different view of the\r\nsituation, but one equally unfavourable to the Cortes as a governing\r\npower. ‘It is full of priests, who (united with the Catalans) are\r\nfor preserving the old routine, and adverse to everything that can\r\ngive energy and vigour to the operation of government. Fanaticism\r\nand personal interest direct their opinions.... Be assured that the\r\nCortes is, as at present constituted, anything but revolutionary or\r\nJacobinical.... If there is not soon some new spirit infused into it,\r\nit will become an overgrown Junta, meddling with every paltry detail\r\nof police, and neglecting the safety of the country--and the Regency\r\nwill be content to reign (very badly) over Cadiz and the Isla[639].’\r\n\r\n  [639] Charles Vaughan to Charles Stuart, Feb. 27, 1811.\r\n\r\nThere was much truth in both these verdicts, though Vaughan\r\nunderrated the force of self-interest in driving a popular assembly\r\nto claim all power for itself, while Wellington underrated the\r\ndead-weight of clerical conservatism, which was the restraint upon\r\nthat tendency. Both were right in asserting that, whatever the Cortes\r\nmight be, the mass of the nation had no wish to set out on the path\r\nof Jacobinism. They both perceived the danger that the Cortes might\r\nturn itself into a constitutional debating society, and at the same\r\ntime prevent any really efficient executive from being established.\r\nSuch was its actual fate. Except that Spain now possessed a\r\ngoverning authority which, with all its faults, had infinitely more\r\npretension to claim a legal mandate from the people than any of\r\nits predecessors, the situation was not greatly changed. From the\r\nmilitary point of view, as we shall see in the next volume, the\r\naspect of the Peninsula was in no degree improved. The same blunders\r\nthat had marked the administration of the old Provincial Juntas, of\r\nthe Supreme Central Junta, and of the first Regency, continued to\r\nexhibit themselves under the rule of the Cortes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH FORCES AT THE SIEGE OF GERONA\r\n\r\nThe original garrison under the command of Alvarez consisted of the\r\nfollowing units.

Marchand merely states that he lost 1,300 men.\r\nBut the subjoined list of losses of officers, taken from Martinien’s\r\ninvaluable tables, shows sufficiently well which were the units that\r\nwere hard hit:--\r\n\r\n  1st Division:       _Killed._  _Wounded._\r\n    Brigade Maucune:\r\n      {6th Léger          1           6\r\n      {69th Ligne         2           4\r\n    Brigade Marcognet:\r\n      {39th Ligne         4          12\r\n      {76th Ligne         7          15\r\n                         --          --\r\n                         14          37\r\n  2nd Division:\r\n    Brigade Labassée:\r\n      {25th Léger         3           8\r\n      {27th Ligne         -           2\r\n    59th Ligne            -           3\r\n    Cavalry:\r\n      15th Dragoons       -           2\r\n      15th Chasseurs      1           1\r\n    État-Major            -           2\r\n                         --          --\r\n                          4          18\r\n\r\nTotal 18 killed, 55 wounded.\r\n\r\nAt the average rate of 21 men hit per officer, which prevailed during\r\nthe Peninsular War, this total of 73 officers ought to imply a total\r\nloss of about 1,533 men.

Irlanda went to Del Parque at Ciudad Rodrigo, 2º\r\nde Cataluña went to Cadiz to recruit. There are left Campo Mayor,\r\nCanarias, 3º de Sevilla, Provincial de Sigüenza, Provincial de\r\nGuadix, Cazadores de Valencia y Albuquerque. Probably they formed the\r\ndivision of 6,000 men which the Junta is said to have deducted from\r\nthe army of Estremadura for its own protection, and to have withdrawn\r\nto the borders of Andalusia in September. At any rate we find in\r\nNovember Campo Mayor, Canarias, and Provincial de Guadix serving\r\nagain in the army of Albuquerque.

(5) The regimental annals in the Conde de\r\nClonard’s great history of the Spanish army. Unfortunately this only\r\nserves for the regular regiments, there being no record of the fates\r\nof the militia battalions or the newly-raised volunteer regiments.\r\nI am specially uncertain about the Cavalry and the 6th Division\r\n(Jacomé), which seems to have been composed of those Estremaduran\r\nunits which had not been organized as the ‘Vanguard’ and ‘7th\r\nDivision.’ But it almost certainly had some Andalusian regiments\r\nadded.

On Feb. 5 General Foy brought up in a similar fashion 1,862\r\nconvalescents and drafts: these are counted in the figures of March\r\n15, 1811.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the original 65,050 men who entered Portugal were\r\ntherefore greater by 3,255 casualties than is shown in the table. The\r\nincrease in the number of some regiments (e. g. 47th Line and Ste.\r\nCroix’s Dragoons) between Jan. 1 and March 15 is thus explained. Of\r\nthe original 65,000 only 40,000 remained, not 44,000, on March 15,\r\n1811.\r\n\r\nThere is another ‘return’ in the Archives Nationaux dated Sept. 27\r\nwhere the figures are slightly lower than those given above, the\r\ntotal running to 62,538 effectives present instead of 65,050. The\r\n2,500 men deficient represent the sick, stragglers, etc. between\r\nSept. 15 and Sept. 27. The Second Corps for example returns 896 ‘sick\r\npresent’ in addition to its 16,641 ‘effectives present.’ The 62,538\r\nrepresent therefore the exact fighting-force at Bussaco.\r\n\r\nN.B.--No French return gives the 44th Équipage de Marine, which\r\ncertainly marched with Masséna on Sept. 15.

Il y arrivera par une ou deux colonnes, en se\r\nfaisant précéder par des tirailleurs. Une fois arrivé sur le sommet\r\ndu point qu’il aura décidé d’attaquer, il se formera en colonne\r\nserrée, et descendra par la crête de la montagne sur le chemin de\r\nCoimbre. Le point où il devra s’arrêter est le Couvent de _Bussaco_.\r\nIl aura soin de se former une réserve, pour se soutenir au besoin.\r\nSon artillerie sera disposée de manière à pouvoir contrebattre celle\r\nde l’ennemi, et à lui servir de point d’appui.\r\n\r\nLe 6me Corps attaquera par les deux chemins qui conduisent sur la\r\nroute de Coimbre; une de ses divisions formera sa réserve, et son\r\nartillerie sera placée par différentes positions, pour pouvoir le\r\nsoutenir au besoin. M. le Maréchal Ney disposera ses deux colonnes\r\nd’attaque de manière à donner quand le Général Reynier sera maître\r\ndes hauteurs, et qu’il marchera sur le Couvent de _Bussaco_. Ce sera\r\nà M. le Maréchal Ney à presser son attaque s’il voit que l’ennemi\r\ns’avance pour faire un mouvement sur le Général Reynier, ou pour\r\nfaire un mouvement de retraite (_sic_)[656]. M. le Maréchal est trop\r\npénétré de l’à-propos de son mouvement pour qu’on le lui détermine.\r\nIl se fera précéder par ses tirailleurs. Arrivé sur la crête de la\r\nmontagne il se mettra en bataille pour l’ensemble des mouvements\r\nultérieurs de l’armée.\r\n\r\n  [656] A strange phrase. How could the enemy ‘advance in order to\r\n  make movement of retreat’?\r\n\r\nLe 8me Corps se rassemblera en arrière de Moura à 6 heures du matin.\r\nIl y prendra position, et fera des dispositions pour soutenir au\r\nbesoin les corps d’armée attaquants, et pour marcher lui-même à\r\nl’ennemi.\r\n\r\nSon artillerie sera placée de manière à arrêter l’ennemi s’il faisait\r\nun mouvement en avant.\r\n\r\nLa réserve de Cavalerie sera placée sur la route de Coimbre, en\r\narrière et au centre du 8me Corps.\r\n\r\n    Le Maréchal Prince d’Essling: Signé MASSÉNA.\r\n\r\n  Copie conforme: Le Gén. de division B.

But the casualties must\r\nhave been very few in the mounted arm. Fririon, Masséna’s chief of\r\nthe Staff, says that the prisoners of the second corps came to 15\r\nofficers and 349 rank and file, many of them wounded. If so, the\r\nkilled must have amounted to 15 officers and 211 men.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------++----------------++----------------++-------\r\n                         ||    Killed      ||                ||\r\n                         || or prisoners.  ||    Wounded.    || Total.\r\n                         ||Officers.| Men. ||Officers.| Men. ||\r\n  -----------------------++---------+------++---------+------++-------\r\n                         ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n       6TH CORPS.        ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n                         ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n  MARCHAND’S Division:   ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n    Maucune’s Brigade:   ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n      6th Léger          ||      2  |   70 ||     12  |  281 ||   365\r\n      69th Ligne         ||      2  |   44 ||     18  |  416 ||   480\r\n    Marcognet’s Brigade: ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n      39th Ligne         ||     --  |   19 ||      3  |  213 ||   235\r\n      76th Ligne         ||     --  |    7 ||      3  |   83 ||    93\r\n                         |+---------+------++---------+------++-------\r\n        Divisional Total ||      4  |  140 ||     36  |  993 || 1,173\r\n                         ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n  MERMET’S Division:     ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n    Bardet’s Brigade:    ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n      25th Léger         ||     --  |    3 ||     --  |   20 ||    23\r\n      27th Ligne         ||     --  |   -- ||      1  |   -- ||     1\r\n    Labassée’s Brigade:  ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n      (50th, 59th)       ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n          no losses      ||     --  |   -- ||     --  |   -- ||    --\r\n                         |+---------+------++---------+------++-------\r\n        Divisional Total ||     --  |    3 ||      1  |   20 ||    24\r\n                         ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n  LOISON’S Division:     ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n    Simon’s Brigade:     ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n      26th Ligne         ||      6  |   37 ||     15  |  225 ||   283\r\n      Légion du Midi     ||      1  |   32 ||      5  |  273 ||   311\r\n      Légion Hanovrienne ||      4  |   26 ||      5  |  182 ||   217\r\n    Ferey’s Brigade:     ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n      32nd Léger         ||      2  |   13 ||      3  |   95 ||   113\r\n      66th Ligne         ||      5  |   15 ||     15  |  123 ||   158\r\n      82nd Ligne         ||      3  |   18 ||      4  |  145 ||   170\r\n                         |+---------+------++---------+------++-------\r\n        Divisional Total ||     21  |  141 ||     47  |1,043 || 1,252\r\n                         ||         |      ||         |      ||\r\n    ÉTAT-MAJOR:          ||     --  |   -- ||      7  |   -- ||     7\r\n                         |+---------+------++---------+------++-------\r\n             Grand Total ||     25  |  284 ||     91  |2,056 || 2,456\r\n  -----------------------++---------+------++---------+------++-------\r\n\r\nNo return from the Artillery, part of which was engaged beside Moura,\r\nand must have had a few casualties, like that of the 2nd Corps.\r\n\r\n8TH CORPS. Junot’s corps having been in reserve, we should not have\r\nexpected to find any casualties, but Martinien’s lists show a few\r\nofficers--five in all--hit, in the 28th and 86th Ligne, besides\r\nan aide-de-camp of Clausel wounded. This must mean that the corps\r\ncaught a few stray shells when it was brought up to cover the retreat\r\nof Ney’s routed divisions. It would be a minimum to estimate the\r\nlosses at sixty. Three of Masséna’s _adjoints de l’État-Major_, and\r\nan officer from the Grand Park, are also mentioned as wounded in\r\nMartinien’s lists.\r\n\r\nThe total of the French losses therefore must have been quite 4,600\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing. The return accounts for no prisoners\r\nfrom the 6th Corps.

SPANISH TROOPS WITHIN THE LINES\r\n\r\n  VANGUARD DIVISION OF THE ARMY OF ESTREMADURA (LA CARRERA):\r\n    Principe (2 batts.), 1st and 2nd of Catalonia (1 batt. each),\r\n      Vittoria (1 batt.)--about                                         2,500\r\n      [N.B.-One battalion of Principe, and Volunteers of Gerona,\r\n      belonging to this division, remained behind at Badajoz.]\r\n\r\n  2nd DIVISION (CHARLES O’DONNELL):\r\n    Zamora (2 batts.), Rey (2 batts.), Toledo (2 batts.), Hibernia\r\n      (2 batts.), Princesa (2 batts.), 2nd of Seville (1 batt.)--about  5,500\r\n      [N.B.-Fernando VII, Voluntarios de Navarra, and Tiradores\r\n      de Castilla, belonging to this division, remained behind in\r\n      Estremadura, at Badajoz and elsewhere.]\r\n                                                                       ------\r\n                                                              Total     8,000\r\n                                                                       ------\r\n\r\nThese numbers are probably a little overstated; on Feb. 1 the whole\r\nVanguard, including the battalions left behind, had only 2,687\r\neffectives, and the whole 2nd Division, including the four battalions\r\nleft in Estremadura, only 5,108. It is probable that the wastage of\r\nthe Spanish troops when inside the Lines was not large, and that on\r\nNov. 1 the whole of La Romana’s sixteen battalions did not make 7,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL OF REGULAR TROOPS IN THE LINES\r\n\r\n  BRITISH           34,059\r\n  PORTUGUESE        24,539\r\n  SPANISH            8,000\r\n                    ------\r\n            Total   66,598\r\n                    ------\r\n\r\nAdd Portuguese Militia and embodied Ordenança, 11,092 strong, and the\r\ntotal of organized troops in the Lines makes 77,690.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH AND PORTUGUESE ARTILLERY IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 1810\r\n\r\nTo match the list of the Artillery units in Wellington’s army which\r\nthe late Colonel F. A. Whinyates was so good as to compile for me\r\nfor the year 1809, and which forms Appendix XI of my second volume,\r\nI have compiled, with the invaluable aid of Major John H. Leslie,\r\nR.A., who is responsible for all the British section, the following\r\nappendix to cover the year 1810.\r\n\r\nROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nTwo troops served in the Bussaco campaign, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  A Troop, Captain H. D. Ross, which had arrived in Portugal in\r\n  July 1809. [Present-designation, ‘A Battery,’ R.H.A.]\r\n\r\n  I Troop, Captain R. Bull, which had arrived in August 1809.\r\n  [Present designation, ‘I Battery,’ R.H.A.]\r\n\r\nThere was also present in Lisbon the skeleton of D Troop, Captain G.\r\nLefebvre. [Present designation, ‘V Battery,’ R.H.A.] But this unit\r\nhad suffered from perils of the sea: a transport carrying part of its\r\nofficers and men had been driven ashore on Ireland; and the portion\r\nwhich arrived in March 1810, being incomplete and almost horseless,\r\nwas not sent to the front. It lent some men to the other two R.H.A.\r\nbatteries: the rest were employed in the Lisbon Forts.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL FOOT ARTILLERY[666].\r\n\r\n  [666] The companies of the battalions R.A. were not numbered in\r\n  1810, but only designated by their captains’ names. The numbers\r\n  here given, for purposes of easier identification, are those\r\n  given to these companies when numeration was introduced about\r\n  1822.\r\n\r\nTwo batteries served in the Bussaco campaign, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  6th Company, 7th battalion, Captain G. Thompson, which had\r\n  arrived in March 1809. [Present designation, 18th Battery, R.F.A.]\r\n\r\n  7th Company, 8th battalion, Captain R. Lawson, which had arrived\r\n  in September 1808. [Present designation, 87th Battery, R.F.A.]\r\n\r\nThere were also present in the Peninsula, but not in the Bussaco\r\ncampaign:--\r\n\r\n  1st Company, 4th battalion, Captain J. Hawker [now 72nd Company,\r\n  R.G.A.].\r\n\r\n  10th Company, 8th battalion, Captain P. Meadows [an extinct unit].\r\n\r\nBoth of which arrived at Lisbon in October 1810, and waited in the\r\nTorres Vedras Lines for the retiring army, having come too late for\r\nthe field operations. Also\r\n\r\n  1st Company, 8th battalion, Bt.-Major A. Bredin [now 27th\r\n  Battery, R.F.A.].\r\n\r\n  2nd Company, 1st battalion, 2nd Captain H. Baynes [now 2nd\r\n  Battery, R.F.A.].\r\n\r\n  10th Company, 5th battalion, Captain F. Glubb [now 48th Company,\r\n  R.G.A.].\r\n\r\nAll of which had arrived in 1808-9. But Baynes’s battery had not\r\ntaken the field since Talavera, and Bredin’s and Glubb’s [both\r\nincomplete] had not gone to the front in 1809 or in 1810. They had\r\nall lain within the Lines since the winter of 1809-10.\r\n\r\nIn addition there were five batteries with Graham’s force at Cadiz.\r\n\r\n  8th Company, 5th battalion, Captain H. Owen [now 60th Company,\r\n  R.G.A.].\r\n\r\n  6th Company, 9th battalion, Captain P. J. Hughes [an extinct\r\n  unit].\r\n\r\n  6th Company, 10th battalion, Captain W. Roberts [now 63rd\r\n  Company, R.G.A.].\r\n\r\n  4th Company, 10th battalion, Captain R. H. Birch[667] [now 21st\r\n  Company, R.G.A.].\r\n\r\n  [667] Captain Birch commanded this company from June 1810 to July\r\n  1812, vice Captain Alex. Dickson, employed with the Portuguese\r\n  army.\r\n\r\n5th Company, 10th battalion, Captain W. H. Shenley [now 11th Company,\r\nR.G.A.].\r\n\r\n\r\nKING’S GERMAN LEGION ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n  2nd Company, Captain C. von Rettberg [arrived August 1808].\r\n\r\n  4th Company, Captain A. Cleeves [arrived August 1808].\r\n\r\nBoth present at Bussaco. In the 1809 campaign they had been commanded\r\nrespectively by Captains A. Tieling and H. L. Heise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGUESE ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Artillery force consisted of four regiments of about\r\n1,200 men each, from which batteries were formed from time to time\r\nfor field service, or garrison service indifferently.\r\n\r\nIn the Bussaco campaign there took part the following units, which\r\nwere present at the battle:--\r\n\r\n1st Regiment, two batteries under Major Alex. Dickson, both of\r\n6-pounders, viz. those of Captain Pedro de Rozierres and Captain João\r\nda Cunha Preto.\r\n\r\n2nd Regiment, two batteries under Major V. von Arentschildt, viz.\r\nthose of Captain João Porfirio da Silva and Captain Jacinto P. M.\r\nFreire, both of 3-pounders.\r\n\r\n4th Regiment, one battery commanded by Captain Antonio de Sousa\r\nPassos (6-pounders).\r\n\r\nThere were also at the front, but not engaged at Bussaco, two more\r\nbatteries, which were with Lecor’s division behind the Alva, on the\r\nPonte Murcella position--viz. one of 9-pounders, captainless till\r\nOct. 1, when it came under the command of Captain Wilhelm Braun, and\r\none of 3-pounders. The former joined Dickson’s division on Sept. 28;\r\nthe latter joined Arentschildt’s division.\r\n\r\nTwo more field batteries joined the army at the Lines after its\r\nretreat: that of Captain Francisco Cypriano Pinto (6-pounders) was\r\nallotted to Dickson’s division; the other (no captain, 9-pounders)\r\njoined Arentschildt’s command.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Artillery at Lisbon was utilized as\r\ngarrison-artillery for the Lines, receiving into its ranks an\r\nimmense proportion of half-trained volunteers from the Militia and\r\nOrdenança, so that the whole can hardly be considered as forming\r\npart of the regular army. I have reckoned it into the militia force\r\nin the preceding table. The districts served by this artillery, the\r\ncommanders of the districts, and the number of effective men in each\r\nwere on Nov. 15, 1810:--\r\n\r\n                                                           Militia-\r\n                                               Regulars. volunteers. Total.\r\n  Alhandra Forts--Major João C. Pinto              258        182      440\r\n  Bucellas Forts--Colonel Romão de Arriada         218        847    1,065\r\n  Monte Agraça Forts--Major J. J. da Cruz          150        300      450\r\n  Torres Vedras Forts--Captain F. J. V. Barreiros  150        248      398\r\n  Mafra Forts--Major Caetano P. Xavier             233        305      538\r\n                                                ------     ------   ------\r\n                                                 1,009      1,882     2,891\r\n\r\nAdding these to the 701 men of the nine field batteries we get 3,592\r\nin all, of whom 1,710 were regulars.\r\n\r\nThe officer in command of the whole Portuguese artillery was Marechal\r\nde Campo J. A. da Roza. Colonel Romão de Arriada commanded the 1st\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Regiment of the Portuguese artillery, that of the Oporto\r\ndistrict, furnished only one battery (that of Captain Passos) to\r\nthe army of Wellington, the rest of it being either serving with\r\nSilveira’s army in the north, or with Trant, or doing garrison duty\r\nat Oporto. This regiment had also contributed to the lost garrison of\r\nAlmeida.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Regiment supplied no men to the field army or the garrison\r\nof the Torres Vedras Lines, being absorbed in garrisoning Abrantes,\r\nElvas, Campo Mayor, and the other places on the frontier south of the\r\nTagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abrantes, Duke of, _see_ Junot.\r\n\r\n  Abrantes, Laure,
