subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a\r\n      salutary maxim, if in fact, as well as in narrative, it had ever\r\n      been held sacred. The Oriental philosophy of the Gnostics, the\r\n      dark abyss of predestination and grace, and the strange\r\n      transformation of the Eucharist from the sign to the substance of\r\n      Christ’s body, 1 I have purposely abandoned to the curiosity of\r\n      speculative divines. But I have reviewed, with diligence and\r\n      pleasure, the objects of ecclesiastical history, by which the\r\n      decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected,\r\n      the propagation of Christianity, the constitution of the Catholic\r\n      church, the ruin of Paganism, and the sects that arose from the\r\n      mysterious controversies concerning the Trinity and incarnation.\r\n      At the head of this class, we may justly rank the worship of\r\n      images, so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries;\r\n      since a question of popular superstition produced the revolt of\r\n      Italy, the temporal power of the popes, and the restoration of\r\n      the Roman empire in the West.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ The learned Selden has given the history of\r\n      transubstantiation in a comprehensive and pithy sentence: “This\r\n      opinion is only rhetoric turned into logic,” (his Works, vol.\r\n      iii. p. 2037, in his Table-Talk.)]\r\n\r\n      The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable\r\n      repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may\r\n      be ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to\r\n      the Greeks. The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all\r\n      representations of the Deity; and that precept was firmly\r\n      established in the principles and practice of the chosen people.\r\n      The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the\r\n      foolish idolaters, who bowed before the workmanship of their own\r\n      hands; the images of brass and marble, which, had they been\r\n      endowed with sense and motion, should have started rather from\r\n      the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist. 2\r\n      Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe\r\n      might crown the statues of Christ and St. Paul with the profane\r\n      honors which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras; 3\r\n      but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and\r\n      spiritual; and the first notice of the use of pictures is in the\r\n      censure of the council of Illiberis, three hundred years after\r\n      the Christian aera. Under the successors of Constantine, in the\r\n      peace and luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent\r\n      bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition, for the\r\n      benefit of the multitude; and, after the ruin of Paganism, they\r\n      were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious\r\n      parallel. The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the\r\n      veneration of the cross, and of relics. The saints and martyrs,\r\n      whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right hand of\r\n      God; but the gracious and often supernatural favors, which, in\r\n      the popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an\r\n      unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims, who visited, and\r\n      touched, and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of\r\n      their merits and sufferings. 4 But a memorial, more interesting\r\n      than the skull or the sandals of a departed worthy, is the\r\n      faithful copy of his person and features, delineated by the arts\r\n      of painting or sculpture. In every age, such copies, so congenial\r\n      to human feelings, have been cherished by the zeal of private\r\n      friendship, or public esteem: the images of the Roman emperors\r\n      were adored with civil, and almost religious, honors; a reverence\r\n      less ostentatious, but more sincere, was applied to the statues\r\n      of sages and patriots; and these profane virtues, these splendid\r\n      sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men, who had died\r\n      for their celestial and everlasting country. At first, the\r\n      experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable\r\n      pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to\r\n      awaken the cold, and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen\r\n      proselytes. By a slow though inevitable progression, the honors\r\n      of the original were transferred to the copy: the devout\r\n      Christian prayed before the image of a saint; and the Pagan rites\r\n      of genuflection, luminaries, and incense, again stole into the\r\n      Catholic church. The scruples of reason, or piety, were silenced\r\n      by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the pictures\r\n      which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with a divine\r\n      energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious\r\n      adoration. The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash\r\n      attempt of defining, by forms and colors, the infinite Spirit,\r\n      the eternal Father, who pervades and sustains the universe. 5 But\r\n      the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to\r\n      worship the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the\r\n      human shape, which, on earth, they have condescended to assume.\r\n      The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and\r\n      mortal body; but that body had ascended into heaven: and, had not\r\n      some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples, the\r\n      spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the\r\n      visible relics and representations of the saints. A similar\r\n      indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary: the\r\n      place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption of her soul\r\n      and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks\r\n      and Latins. The use, and even the worship, of images was firmly\r\n      established before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly\r\n      cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics: the\r\n      Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new\r\n      superstition; but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly\r\n      entertained by the rude Barbarians and the Arian clergy of the\r\n      West. The bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or marble, which\r\n      peopled the temples of antiquity, were offensive to the fancy or\r\n      conscience of the Christian Greeks: and a smooth surface of\r\n      colors has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of\r\n      imitation. 6\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ Nec intelligunt homines ineptissimi, quod si sentire\r\n      simulacra et moveri possent, adoratura hominem fuissent a quo\r\n      sunt expolita.

Lactantius is the\r\n      last, as well as the most eloquent, of the Latin apologists.\r\n      Their raillery of idols attacks not only the object, but the form\r\n      and matter.]\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ See Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Augustin, (Basnage,\r\n      Hist. des Eglises Reformees, tom. ii. p. 1313.)

Labb. tom. viii.\r\n      p. 1025, edit. Venet.) Il seroit peut-etre a-propos de ne point\r\n      souffrir d’images de la Trinite ou de la Divinite; les defenseurs\r\n      les plus zeles des images ayant condamne celles-ci, et le concile\r\n      de Trente ne parlant que des images de Jesus Christ et des\r\n      Saints, (Dupin, Bibliot. Eccles. tom. vi. p. 154.)]\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ This general history of images is drawn from the\r\n      xxiid book of the Hist. des Eglises Reformees of Basnage, tom.\r\n      ii. p. 1310-1337. He was a Protestant, but of a manly spirit; and\r\n      on this head the Protestants are so notoriously in the right,\r\n      that they can venture to be impartial. See the perplexity of poor\r\n      Friar Pagi, Critica, tom. i. p. 42.]\r\n\r\n      The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with\r\n      the original; but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the\r\n      genuine features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles:\r\n      the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine 7 was more probably\r\n      that of some temporal savior; the Gnostics and their profane\r\n      monuments were reprobated; and the fancy of the Christian artists\r\n      could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen\r\n      model. In this distress, a bold and dexterous invention assured\r\n      at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the\r\n      worship. A new super structure of fable was raised on the popular\r\n      basis of a Syrian legend, on the correspondence of Christ and\r\n      Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluctantly\r\n      deserted by our modern advocates. The bishop of Caesarea 8\r\n      records the epistle, 9 but he most strangely forgets the picture\r\n      of Christ; 10 the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with\r\n      which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had\r\n      invoked his healing power, and offered the strong city of Edessa\r\n      to protect him against the malice of the Jews. The ignorance of\r\n      the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the\r\n      image in a niche of the wall, from whence, after an oblivion of\r\n      five hundred years, it was released by some prudent bishop, and\r\n      seasonably presented to the devotion of the times. Its first and\r\n      most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the\r\n      arms of Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon revered as a pledge\r\n      of the divine promise, that Edessa should never be taken by a\r\n      foreign enemy. It is true, indeed, that the text of Procopius\r\n      ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valor\r\n      of her citizens, who purchased the absence and repelled the\r\n      assaults of the Persian monarch. He was ignorant, the profane\r\n      historian, of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in\r\n      the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, that the Palladium was\r\n      exposed on the rampart, and that the water which had been\r\n      sprinkled on the holy face, instead of quenching, added new fuel\r\n      to the flames of the besieged. After this important service, the\r\n      image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude; and if\r\n      the Armenians rejected the legend, the more credulous Greeks\r\n      adored the similitude, which was not the work of any mortal\r\n      pencil, but the immediate creation of the divine original. The\r\n      style and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far\r\n      their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry. “How can we\r\n      with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor\r\n      the host of heaven presumes not to behold? He who dwells in\r\n      heaven, condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image;\r\n      He who is seated on the cherubim, visits us this day by a\r\n      picture, which the Father has delineated with his immaculate\r\n      hand, which he has formed in an ineffable manner, and which we\r\n      sanctify by adoring it with fear and love.” Before the end of the\r\n      sixth century, these images, made without hands, (in Greek it is\r\n      a single word, 11 were propagated in the camps and cities of the\r\n      Eastern empire: 12 they were the objects of worship, and the\r\n      instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult,\r\n      their venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the\r\n      courage, or repress the fury, of the Roman legions. Of these\r\n      pictures, the far greater part, the transcripts of a human\r\n      pencil, could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper\r\n      title: but there were some of higher descent, who derived their\r\n      resemblance from an immediate contact with the original, endowed,\r\n      for that purpose, with a miraculous and prolific virtue. The most\r\n      ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the\r\n      image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or Spain, or\r\n      Jerusalem, which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to\r\n      his face, and delivered to a holy matron. The fruitful precedent\r\n      was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and\r\n      martyrs. In the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features\r\n      of the Mother of God 13 were deeply inscribed in a marble column;\r\n      the East and West have been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke;\r\n      and the Evangelist, who was perhaps a physician, has been forced\r\n      to exercise the occupation of a painter, so profane and odious in\r\n      the eyes of the primitive Christians. The Olympian Jove, created\r\n      by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias, might inspire a\r\n      philosophic mind with momentary devotion; but these Catholic\r\n      images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in\r\n      the last degeneracy of taste and genius. 14\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ After removing some rubbish of miracle and\r\n      inconsistency, it may be allowed, that as late as the year 300,\r\n      Paneas in Palestine was decorated with a bronze statue,\r\n      representing a grave personage wrapped in a cloak, with a\r\n      grateful or suppliant female kneeling before him, and that an\r\n      inscription was perhaps inscribed on the pedestal. By the\r\n      Christians, this group was foolishly explained of their founder\r\n      and the poor woman whom he had cured of the bloody flux, (Euseb.\r\n      vii. 18, Philostorg. vii. 3, &c.) M. de Beausobre more reasonably\r\n      conjectures the philosopher Apollonius, or the emperor Vespasian:\r\n      in the latter supposition, the female is a city, a province, or\r\n      perhaps the queen Berenice, (Bibliotheque Germanique, tom. xiii.\r\n      p. 1-92.)]\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ Euseb.

But in the\r\n      beginning of the eighth century, in the full magnitude of the\r\n      abuse, the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension,\r\n      that under the mask of Christianity, they had restored the\r\n      religion of their fathers: they heard, with grief and impatience,\r\n      the name of idolaters; the incessant charge of the Jews and\r\n      Mahometans, 15 who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal\r\n      hatred to graven images and all relative worship. The servitude\r\n      of the Jews might curb their zeal, and depreciate their\r\n      authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned at\r\n      Damascus, and threatened Constantinople, cast into the scale of\r\n      reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory. The cities\r\n      of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had been fortified with the images\r\n      of Christ, his mother, and his saints; and each city presumed on\r\n      the hope or promise of miraculous defence. In a rapid conquest of\r\n      ten years, the Arabs subdued those cities and these images; and,\r\n      in their opinion, the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive\r\n      judgment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and\r\n      inanimate idols. 1511 For a while Edessa had braved the Persian\r\n      assaults; but the chosen city, the spouse of Christ, was involved\r\n      in the common ruin; and his divine resemblance became the slave\r\n      and trophy of the infidels. After a servitude of three hundred\r\n      years, the Palladium was yielded to the devotion of\r\n      Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver,\r\n      the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans, and a perpetual truce\r\n      for the territory of Edessa. 16 In this season of distress and\r\n      dismay, the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence\r\n      of images; and they attempted to prove, that the sin and schism\r\n      of the greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favor,\r\n      and annihilated the virtue, of these precious symbols. But they\r\n      were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational\r\n      Christians, who appealed to the evidence of texts, of facts, and\r\n      of the primitive times, and secretly desired the reformation of\r\n      the church. As the worship of images had never been established\r\n      by any general or positive law, its progress in the Eastern\r\n      empire had been retarded, or accelerated, by the differences of\r\n      men and manners, the local degrees of refinement, and the\r\n      personal characters of the bishops. The splendid devotion was\r\n      fondly cherished by the levity of the capital, and the inventive\r\n      genius of the Byzantine clergy; while the rude and remote\r\n      districts of Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred\r\n      luxury. Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians\r\n      maintained, after their conversion, the simple worship which had\r\n      preceded their separation; and the Armenians, the most warlike\r\n      subjects of Rome, were not reconciled, in the twelfth century, to\r\n      the sight of images. 17 These various denominations of men\r\n      afforded a fund of prejudice and aversion, of small account in\r\n      the villages of Anatolia or Thrace, but which, in the fortune of\r\n      a soldier, a prelate, or a eunuch, might be often connected with\r\n      the powers of the church and state.\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ By Cedrenus, Zonaras, Glycas, and Manasses, the\r\n      origin of the Aconoclcasts is imprinted to the caliph Yezid and\r\n      two Jews, who promised the empire to Leo; and the reproaches of\r\n      these hostile sectaries are turned into an absurd conspiracy for\r\n      restoring the purity of the Christian worship, (see Spanheim,\r\n      Hist.

He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters; but\r\n      his education, his reason, perhaps his intercourse with the Jews\r\n      and Arabs, had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of\r\n      images; and it was held to be the duty of a prince to impose on\r\n      his subjects the dictates of his own conscience. But in the\r\n      outset of an unsettled reign, during ten years of toil and\r\n      danger, Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy, bowed before\r\n      the idols which he despised, and satisfied the Roman pontiff with\r\n      the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal. In the\r\n      reformation of religion, his first steps were moderate and\r\n      cautious: he assembled a great council of senators and bishops,\r\n      and enacted, with their consent, that all the images should be\r\n      removed from the sanctuary and altar to a proper height in the\r\n      churches where they might be visible to the eyes, and\r\n      inaccessible to the superstition, of the people. But it was\r\n      impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse\r\n      impulse of veneration and abhorrence: in their lofty position,\r\n      the sacred images still edified their votaries, and reproached\r\n      the tyrant. He was himself provoked by resistance and invective;\r\n      and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his\r\n      duty, and urged for his imitation the example of the Jewish king,\r\n      who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple.\r\n      By a second edict, he proscribed the existence as well as the use\r\n      of religious pictures; the churches of Constantinople and the\r\n      provinces were cleansed from idolatry; the images of Christ, the\r\n      Virgin, and the saints, were demolished, or a smooth surface of\r\n      plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice. The sect of the\r\n      Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and despotism of six\r\n      emperors, and the East and West were involved in a noisy conflict\r\n      of one hundred and twenty years. It was the design of Leo the\r\n      Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of\r\n      faith, and by the authority of a general council: but the\r\n      convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son\r\n      Constantine; 19 and though it is stigmatized by triumphant\r\n      bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists, their own partial and\r\n      mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety. The\r\n      debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the\r\n      summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of\r\n      Constantinople, and was composed of the respectable number of\r\n      three hundred and thirty-eight bishops of Europe and Anatolia;\r\n      for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the slaves of\r\n      the caliph, and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches of\r\n      Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks. This\r\n      Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh\r\n      general council; yet even this title was a recognition of the six\r\n      preceding assemblies, which had laboriously built the structure\r\n      of the Catholic faith. After a serious deliberation of six\r\n      months, the three hundred and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and\r\n      subscribed a unanimous decree, that all visible symbols of\r\n      Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either blasphemous or\r\n      heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of Christianity\r\n      and a renewal of Paganism; that all such monuments of idolatry\r\n      should be broken or erased; and that those who should refuse to\r\n      deliver the objects of their private superstition, were guilty of\r\n      disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor.\r\n      In their loud and loyal acclamations, they celebrated the merits\r\n      of their temporal redeemer; and to his zeal and justice they\r\n      intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures. At\r\n      Constantinople, as in the former councils, the will of the prince\r\n      was the rule of episcopal faith; but on this occasion, I am\r\n      inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates\r\n      sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and\r\n      fear. In the long night of superstition, the Christians had\r\n      wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel: nor was it\r\n      easy for them to discern the clew, and tread back the mazes, of\r\n      the labyrinth. The worship of images was inseparably blended, at\r\n      least to a pious fancy, with the Cross, the Virgin, the Saints\r\n      and their relics; the holy ground was involved in a cloud of\r\n      miracles and visions; and the nerves of the mind, curiosity and\r\n      scepticism, were benumbed by the habits of obedience and belief.\r\n      Constantine himself is accused of indulging a royal license to\r\n      doubt, or deny, or deride the mysteries of the Catholics, 20 but\r\n      they were deeply inscribed in the public and private creed of his\r\n      bishops; and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a secret\r\n      horror the monuments of popular devotion, which were consecrated\r\n      to the honor of his celestial patrons. In the reformation of the\r\n      sixteenth century, freedom and knowledge had expanded all the\r\n      faculties of man: the thirst of innovation superseded the\r\n      reverence of antiquity; and the vigor of Europe could disdain\r\n      those phantoms which terrified the sickly and servile weakness of\r\n      the Greeks.\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ Our original, but not impartial, monuments of the\r\n      Iconoclasts must be drawn from the Acts of the Councils, tom.\r\n      viii. and ix.

The first hostilities of\r\n      Leo were directed against a lofty Christ on the vestibule, and\r\n      above the gate, of the palace. A ladder had been planted for the\r\n      assault, but it was furiously shaken by a crowd of zealots and\r\n      women: they beheld, with pious transport, the ministers of\r\n      sacrilege tumbling from on high and dashed against the pavement:\r\n      and the honors of the ancient martyrs were prostituted to these\r\n      criminals, who justly suffered for murder and rebellion. 21 The\r\n      execution of the Imperial edicts was resisted by frequent tumults\r\n      in Constantinople and the provinces: the person of Leo was\r\n      endangered, his officers were massacred, and the popular\r\n      enthusiasm was quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and\r\n      military power. Of the Archipelago, or Holy Sea, the numerous\r\n      islands were filled with images and monks: their votaries\r\n      abjured, without scruple, the enemy of Christ, his mother, and\r\n      the saints; they armed a fleet of boats and galleys, displayed\r\n      their consecrated banners, and boldly steered for the harbor of\r\n      Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favorite of God and\r\n      the people. They depended on the succor of a miracle: but their\r\n      miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire; and, after the\r\n      defeat and conflagration of the fleet, the naked islands were\r\n      abandoned to the clemency or justice of the conqueror. The son of\r\n      Leo, in the first year of his reign, had undertaken an expedition\r\n      against the Saracens: during his absence, the capital, the\r\n      palace, and the purple, were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes,\r\n      the ambitious champion of the orthodox faith. The worship of\r\n      images was triumphantly restored: the patriarch renounced his\r\n      dissimulation, or dissembled his sentiments and the righteous\r\n      claims of the usurper was acknowledged, both in the new, and in\r\n      ancient, Rome. Constantine flew for refuge to his paternal\r\n      mountains; but he descended at the head of the bold and\r\n      affectionate Isaurians; and his final victory confounded the arms\r\n      and predictions of the fanatics. His long reign was distracted\r\n      with clamor, sedition, conspiracy, and mutual hatred, and\r\n      sanguinary revenge; the persecution of images was the motive or\r\n      pretence, of his adversaries; and, if they missed a temporal\r\n      diadem, they were rewarded by the Greeks with the crown of\r\n      martyrdom. In every act of open and clandestine treason, the\r\n      emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the monks, the faithful\r\n      slaves of the superstition to which they owed their riches and\r\n      influence. They prayed, they preached, they absolved, they\r\n      inflamed, they conspired; the solitude of Palestine poured forth\r\n      a torrent of invective; and the pen of St. John Damascenus, 22\r\n      the last of the Greek fathers, devoted the tyrant’s head, both in\r\n      this world and the next. 23 2311 I am not at leisure to examine\r\n      how far the monks provoked, nor how much they have exaggerated,\r\n      their real and pretended sufferings, nor how many lost their\r\n      lives or limbs, their eyes or their beards, by the cruelty of the\r\n      emperor. 2312 From the chastisement of individuals, he proceeded\r\n      to the abolition of the order; and, as it was wealthy and\r\n      useless, his resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and\r\n      justified by patriotism. The formidable name and mission of the\r\n      Dragon, 24 his visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence\r\n      of the black nation: the religious communities were dissolved,\r\n      the buildings were converted into magazines, or barracks; the\r\n      lands, movables, and cattle were confiscated; and our modern\r\n      precedents will support the charge, that much wanton or malicious\r\n      havoc was exercised against the relics, and even the books of the\r\n      monasteries. With the habit and profession of monks, the public\r\n      and private worship of images was rigorously proscribed; and it\r\n      should seem, that a solemn abjuration of idolatry was exacted\r\n      from the subjects, or at least from the clergy, of the Eastern\r\n      empire. 25\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ The holy confessor Theophanes approves the\r\n      principle of their rebellion, (p. 339.)

A distant and dangerous station, amidst the Barbarians\r\n      of the West, excited the spirit and freedom of the Latin bishops.\r\n\r\n      Their popular election endeared them to the Romans: the public\r\n      and private indigence was relieved by their ample revenue; and\r\n      the weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to\r\n      consult, both in peace and war, the temporal safety of the city.\r\n      In the school of adversity the priest insensibly imbibed the\r\n      virtues and the ambition of a prince; the same character was\r\n      assumed, the same policy was adopted, by the Italian, the Greek,\r\n      or the Syrian, who ascended the chair of St. Peter; and, after\r\n      the loss of her legions and provinces, the genius and fortune of\r\n      the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome. It is agreed,\r\n      that in the eighth century, their dominion was founded on\r\n      rebellion, and that the rebellion was produced, and justified, by\r\n      the heresy of the Iconoclasts; but the conduct of the second and\r\n      third Gregory, in this memorable contest, is variously\r\n      interpreted by the wishes of their friends and enemies. The\r\n      Byzantine writers unanimously declare, that, after a fruitless\r\n      admonition, they pronounced the separation of the East and West,\r\n      and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue and\r\n      sovereignty of Italy. Their excommunication is still more clearly\r\n      expressed by the Greeks, who beheld the accomplishment of the\r\n      papal triumphs; and as they are more strongly attached to their\r\n      religion than to their country, they praise, instead of blaming,\r\n      the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men. 26 The modern\r\n      champions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the\r\n      precedent: this great and glorious example of the deposition of\r\n      royal heretics is celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and\r\n      Bellarmine; 27 and if they are asked, why the same thunders were\r\n      not hurled against the Neros and Julians of antiquity, they\r\n      reply, that the weakness of the primitive church was the sole\r\n      cause of her patient loyalty. 28 On this occasion the effects of\r\n      love and hatred are the same; and the zealous Protestants, who\r\n      seek to kindle the indignation, and to alarm the fears, of\r\n      princes and magistrates, expatiate on the insolence and treason\r\n      of the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign. 29 They are\r\n      defended only by the moderate Catholics, for the most part, of\r\n      the Gallican church, 30 who respect the saint, without approving\r\n      the sin. These common advocates of the crown and the mitre\r\n      circumscribe the truth of facts by the rule of equity, Scripture,\r\n      and tradition, and appeal to the evidence of the Latins, 31 and\r\n      the lives 32 and epistles of the popes; themselves.\r\n\r\n      26 (return) [ Theophanes.

You now\r\n      accuse the Catholics of idolatry; and, by the accusation, you\r\n      betray your own impiety and ignorance. To this ignorance we are\r\n      compelled to adapt the grossness of our style and arguments: the\r\n      first elements of holy letters are sufficient for your confusion;\r\n      and were you to enter a grammar-school, and avow yourself the\r\n      enemy of our worship, the simple and pious children would be\r\n      provoked to cast their horn-books at your head.” After this\r\n      decent salutation, the pope attempts the usual distinction\r\n      between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images. The\r\n      former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons,\r\n      at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any\r\n      visible likeness. The latter are the genuine forms of Christ, his\r\n      mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd of miracles,\r\n      the innocence and merit of this relative worship. He must indeed\r\n      have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert the\r\n      perpetual use of images, from the apostolic age, and their\r\n      venerable presence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A\r\n      more specious argument is drawn from present possession and\r\n      recent practice the harmony of the Christian world supersedes the\r\n      demand of a general council; and Gregory frankly confesses, than\r\n      such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an orthodox\r\n      prince. To the impudent and inhuman Leo, more guilty than a\r\n      heretic, he recommends peace, silence, and implicit obedience to\r\n      his spiritual guides of Constantinople and Rome. The limits of\r\n      civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the pontiff. To\r\n      the former he appropriates the body; to the latter, the soul: the\r\n      sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate: the more\r\n      formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy;\r\n      and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will\r\n      not spare his offending father: the successor of St. Peter may\r\n      lawfully chastise the kings of the earth. “You assault us, O\r\n      tyrant! with a carnal and military hand: unarmed and naked we can\r\n      only implore the Christ, the prince of the heavenly host, that he\r\n      will send unto you a devil, for the destruction of your body and\r\n      the salvation of your soul. You declare, with foolish arrogance,\r\n      I will despatch my orders to Rome: I will break in pieces the\r\n      image of St. Peter; and Gregory, like his predecessor Martin,\r\n      shall be transported in chains, and in exile, to the foot of the\r\n      Imperial throne. Would to God that I might be permitted to tread\r\n      in the footsteps of the holy Martin! but may the fate of Constans\r\n      serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church! After his\r\n      just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily, the tyrant was cut\r\n      off, in the fullness of his sins, by a domestic servant: the\r\n      saint is still adored by the nations of Scythia, among whom he\r\n      ended his banishment and his life.

The eyes of the\r\n      nations are fixed on our humility; and they revere, as a God upon\r\n      earth, the apostle St. Peter, whose image you threaten to\r\n      destroy. 35 The remote and interior kingdoms of the West present\r\n      their homage to Christ and his vicegerent; and we now prepare to\r\n      visit one of their most powerful monarchs, who desires to receive\r\n      from our hands the sacrament of baptism. 36 The Barbarians have\r\n      submitted to the yoke of the gospel, while you alone are deaf to\r\n      the voice of the shepherd. These pious Barbarians are kindled\r\n      into rage: they thirst to avenge the persecution of the East.\r\n      Abandon your rash and fatal enterprise; reflect, tremble, and\r\n      repent.

(Pagi. A., 89, No. 2. A.D.\r\n      726, No. 15.)]\r\n\r\n      The first assault of Leo against the images of Constantinople had\r\n      been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from Italy and the West,\r\n      who related with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the\r\n      emperor. But on the reception of his proscriptive edict, they\r\n      trembled for their domestic deities: the images of Christ and the\r\n      Virgin, of the angels, martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all\r\n      the churches of Italy; and a strong alternative was proposed to\r\n      the Roman pontiff, the royal favor as the price of his\r\n      compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his\r\n      disobedience. Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate;\r\n      and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor\r\n      displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the\r\n      powers of resistance. Without depending on prayers or miracles,\r\n      he boldly armed against the public enemy, and his pastoral\r\n      letters admonished the Italians of their danger and their duty.\r\n      37 At this signal, Ravenna, Venice, and the cities of the\r\n      Exarchate and Pentapolis, adhered to the cause of religion; their\r\n      military force by sea and land consisted, for the most part, of\r\n      the natives; and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused\r\n      into the mercenary strangers. The Italians swore to live and die\r\n      in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the Roman people\r\n      was devoted to their father, and even the Lombards were ambitious\r\n      to share the merit and advantage of this holy war. The most\r\n      treasonable act, but the most obvious revenge, was the\r\n      destruction of the statues of Leo himself: the most effectual and\r\n      pleasing measure of rebellion, was the withholding the tribute of\r\n      Italy, and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused\r\n      by the imposition of a new capitation. 38 A form of\r\n      administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and\r\n      governors; and so high was the public indignation, that the\r\n      Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to\r\n      conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of\r\n      Constantinople. In that palace, the Roman bishops, the second and\r\n      third Gregory, were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and\r\n      every attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their\r\n      persons, and to strike at their lives. The city was repeatedly\r\n      visited or assaulted by captains of the guards, and dukes and\r\n      exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they landed with foreign\r\n      troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the superstition of\r\n      Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of\r\n      heresy. But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by\r\n      the courage and vigilance of the Romans; the Greeks were\r\n      overthrown and massacred, their leaders suffered an ignominious\r\n      death, and the popes, however inclined to mercy, refused to\r\n      intercede for these guilty victims. At Ravenna, 39 the several\r\n      quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary\r\n      feud; in religious controversy they found a new aliment of\r\n      faction: but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or\r\n      spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent, lost\r\n      his life in a popular sedition. To punish this flagitious deed,\r\n      and restore his dominion in Italy, the emperor sent a fleet and\r\n      army into the Adriatic Gulf. After suffering from the winds and\r\n      waves much loss and delay, the Greeks made their descent in the\r\n      neighborhood of Ravenna: they threatened to depopulate the guilty\r\n      capital, and to imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of\r\n      Justinian the Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the\r\n      choice and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants. The\r\n      women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in\r\n      prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their country;\r\n      the common danger had united the factions, and the event of a\r\n      battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege. In a\r\n      hard-fought day, as the two armies alternately yielded and\r\n      advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard, and Ravenna was\r\n      victorious by the assurance of victory. The strangers retreated\r\n      to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured forth a\r\n      multitude of boats; the waters of the Po were so deeply infected\r\n      with blood, that during six years the public prejudice abstained\r\n      from the fish of the river; and the institution of an annual\r\n      feast perpetuated the worship of images, and the abhorrence of\r\n      the Greek tyrant. Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms, the\r\n      Roman pontiff convened a synod of ninety-three bishops against\r\n      the heresy of the Iconoclasts. With their consent, he pronounced\r\n      a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should\r\n      attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints:\r\n      in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved, 40 but the\r\n      vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that\r\n      the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head. No sooner\r\n      had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and\r\n      the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to have\r\n      relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the\r\n      Byzantine dominion. Their moderate councils delayed and prevented\r\n      the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the Italians not\r\n      to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy. The exarch was\r\n      permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather\r\n      than a master; and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne,\r\n      the government of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the\r\n      successors of Constantine. 41\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ I shall transcribe the important and decisive\r\n      passage of the Liber Pontificalis.

Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two\r\n      annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers\r\n      of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was\r\n      distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a\r\n      well-proportioned scale of property and service. Ignorant of the\r\n      arts of luxury, the primitive Romans had improved the science of\r\n      government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the\r\n      rights of individuals were sacred: one hundred and thirty\r\n      thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band\r\n      of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of\r\n      freedom and ambitious of glory. 43 When the sovereignty of the\r\n      Greek emperors was extinguished, the ruins of Rome presented the\r\n      sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her\r\n      liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object\r\n      of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the\r\n      substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was\r\n      obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they\r\n      were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of\r\n      a commonwealth. Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and\r\n      strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious\r\n      Barbarians. As often as the Franks or Lombards expressed their\r\n      most bitter contempt of a foe, they called him a Roman; “and in\r\n      this name,” says the bishop Liutprand, “we include whatever is\r\n      base, whatever is cowardly, whatever is perfidious, the extremes\r\n      of avarice and luxury, and every vice that can prostitute the\r\n      dignity of human nature.” 44 441 By the necessity of their\r\n      situation, the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model\r\n      of a republican government: they were compelled to elect some\r\n      judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the nobles assembled to\r\n      deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed without the\r\n      union and consent of the multitude. The style of the Roman senate\r\n      and people was revived, 45 but the spirit was fled; and their new\r\n      independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of\r\n      vicentiousness and oppression. The want of laws could only be\r\n      supplied by the influence of religion, and their foreign and\r\n      domestic counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop.\r\n      His alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the kings and\r\n      prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude, and\r\n      oath, accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first\r\n      magistrate or prince of the city. The Christian humility of the\r\n      popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord; and their\r\n      face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient\r\n      coins. 46 Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the\r\n      reverence of a thousand years; and their noblest title is the\r\n      free choice of a people, whom they had redeemed from slavery.\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ I have traced the Roman duchy according to the\r\n      maps, and the maps according to the excellent dissertation of\r\n      father Beretti, (de Chorographia Italiae Medii Aevi, sect. xx. p.\r\n      216-232.)

But this mystic\r\n      circle could have been traced only by the wand of a legislator\r\n      and a sage: this pacific system was incompatible with the zeal\r\n      and ambition of the popes; the Romans were not addicted, like the\r\n      inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent and placid labors of\r\n      agriculture; and the Barbarians of Italy, though softened by the\r\n      climate, were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of\r\n      public and private life. A memorable example of repentance and\r\n      piety was exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards. In arms,\r\n      at the gate of the Vatican, the conqueror listened to the voice\r\n      of Gregory the Second, 48 withdrew his troops, resigned his\r\n      conquests, respectfully visited the church of St. Peter, and\r\n      after performing his devotions, offered his sword and dagger, his\r\n      cuirass and mantle, his silver cross, and his crown of gold, on\r\n      the tomb of the apostle. But this religious fervor was the\r\n      illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of\r\n      interest is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was\r\n      congenial to the Lombards; and both the prince and people were\r\n      irresistibly tempted by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of\r\n      Rome, and the unwarlike profession of her new chief. On the first\r\n      edicts of the emperor, they declared themselves the champions of\r\n      the holy images: Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna, which\r\n      had already assumed that distinctive appellation; the Catholics\r\n      of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance to his civil and\r\n      military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for the first\r\n      time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna. That city and\r\n      fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and\r\n      maritime forces of the Venetians; and those faithful subjects\r\n      obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself, in separating the\r\n      personal guilt of Leo from the general cause of the Roman empire.\r\n      49 The Greeks were less mindful of the service, than the Lombards\r\n      of the injury: the two nations, hostile in their faith, were\r\n      reconciled in a dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and\r\n      the exarch marched to the conquest of Spoleto and Rome: the storm\r\n      evaporated without effect, but the policy of Liutprand alarmed\r\n      Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and truce. His\r\n      successor Astolphus declared himself the equal enemy of the\r\n      emperor and the pope: Ravenna was subdued by force or treachery,\r\n      50 and this final conquest extinguished the series of the\r\n      exarchs, who had reigned with a subordinate power since the time\r\n      of Justinian and the ruin of the Gothic kingdom. Rome was\r\n      summoned to acknowledge the victorious Lombard as her lawful\r\n      sovereign; the annual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the\r\n      ransom of each citizen, and the sword of destruction was\r\n      unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience. The Romans\r\n      hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the threatening\r\n      Barbarians were checked by arms and negotiations, till the popes\r\n      had engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the\r\n      Alps. 51\r\n\r\n      47 (return) [ See West’s Dissertation on the Olympic Games,\r\n      (Pindar. vol. ii. p. 32-36, edition in 12mo.,) and the judicious\r\n      reflections of Polybius (tom. i. l. iv. p. 466, edit Gronov.)]\r\n\r\n      48 (return) [ The speech of Gregory to the Lombard is finely\r\n      composed by Sigonius, (de Regno Italiae, l. iii.

Rerum Ital. tom. iii. pars ii. p. 75, &c.)]\r\n\r\n      In his distress, the first 511 Gregory had implored the aid of\r\n      the hero of the age, of Charles Martel, who governed the French\r\n      monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke; and who, by his\r\n      signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his country, and\r\n      perhaps Europe, from the Mahometan yoke. The ambassadors of the\r\n      pope were received by Charles with decent reverence; but the\r\n      greatness of his occupations, and the shortness of his life,\r\n      prevented his interference in the affairs of Italy, except by a\r\n      friendly and ineffectual mediation. His son Pepin, the heir of\r\n      his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of the\r\n      Roman church; and the zeal of the French prince appears to have\r\n      been prompted by the love of glory and religion. But the danger\r\n      was on the banks of the Tyber, the succor on those of the Seine,\r\n      and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.\r\n      Amidst the tears of the city, Stephen the Third embraced the\r\n      generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of Lombardy\r\n      and France, to deprecate the injustice of his enemy, or to excite\r\n      the pity and indignation of his friend. After soothing the public\r\n      despair by litanies and orations, he undertook this laborious\r\n      journey with the ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek\r\n      emperor. The king of the Lombards was inexorable; but his threats\r\n      could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of the\r\n      Roman pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the\r\n      abbey of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his\r\n      protector; a hand which was never lifted in vain, either in war\r\n      or friendship. Stephen was entertained as the visible successor\r\n      of the apostle; at the next assembly, the field of March or of\r\n      May, his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation,\r\n      and he repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror,\r\n      at the head of a French army, which was led by the king in\r\n      person. The Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an\r\n      ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to\r\n      respect the sanctity, of the Roman church. But no sooner was\r\n      Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms, than he\r\n      forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome was again\r\n      encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing\r\n      the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his complaint and\r\n      request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St. Peter\r\n      himself. 52 The apostle assures his adopted sons, the king, the\r\n      clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is\r\n      still alive in the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the\r\n      voice of the founder and guardian of the Roman church; that the\r\n      Virgin, the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host\r\n      of heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the\r\n      obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown their\r\n      pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be the penalty\r\n      of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his temple, and his\r\n      people, to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards. The\r\n      second expedition of Pepin was not less rapid and fortunate than\r\n      the first: St. Peter was satisfied, Rome was again saved, and\r\n      Astolphus was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the\r\n      scourge of a foreign master. After this double chastisement, the\r\n      Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor and\r\n      decay. But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition;\r\n      and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble, they\r\n      peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of claims,\r\n      evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection,\r\n      and terminated without glory. On either side, their expiring\r\n      monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the\r\n      First, the genius, the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the\r\n      son of Pepin; these heroes of the church and state were united in\r\n      public and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the\r\n      prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest\r\n      colors of equity and moderation. 53 The passes of the Alps, and\r\n      the walls of Pavia, were the only defence of the Lombards; the\r\n      former were surprised, the latter were invested, by the son of\r\n      Pepin; and after a blockade of two years, 531 Desiderius, the\r\n      last of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his\r\n      capital.\r\n\r\n      Under the dominion of a foreign king, but in the possession of\r\n      their national laws, the Lombards became the brethren, rather\r\n      than the subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and\r\n      manners, and language, from the same Germanic origin. 54\r\n\r\n      511 (return) [ Gregory I. had been dead above a century; read\r\n      Gregory III.—M]\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ See this most extraordinary letter in the Codex\r\n      Carolinus, epist iii. p. 92.

In the conquest of Italy, the champions\r\n      of the Roman church obtained a favorable occasion, a specious\r\n      title, the wishes of the people, the prayers and intrigues of the\r\n      clergy. But the most essential gifts of the popes to the\r\n      Carlovingian race were the dignities of king of France, 55 and of\r\n      patrician of Rome. I. Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St. Peter,\r\n      the nations began to resume the practice of seeking, on the banks\r\n      of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their\r\n      fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of\r\n      their government. All the powers of royalty were exercised by\r\n      Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title,\r\n      was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his\r\n      valor; his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father\r\n      had been the savior of Christendom; and the claims of personal\r\n      merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four\r\n      generations. The name and image of royalty was still preserved in\r\n      the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his\r\n      obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition:\r\n      the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the\r\n      constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to\r\n      ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family. The mayor\r\n      and the nobles were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal\r\n      phantom: the blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes;\r\n      and their common ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff, to\r\n      dispel their scruples, or to absolve their promise. The interest\r\n      of Pope Zachary, the successor of the two Gregories, prompted him\r\n      to decide, and to decide in their favor: he pronounced that the\r\n      nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and\r\n      authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a victim\r\n      of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined in\r\n      a monastery for the remainder of his days. An answer so agreeable\r\n      to their wishes was accepted by the Franks as the opinion of a\r\n      casuist, the sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the\r\n      Merovingian race disappeared from the earth; and Pepin was\r\n      exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people, accustomed\r\n      to obey his laws and to march under his standard. His coronation\r\n      was twice performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their\r\n      most faithful servant St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and\r\n      by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third, who, in the monastery\r\n      of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor. The\r\n      royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexterously applied: 56\r\n      the successor of St. Peter assumed the character of a divine\r\n      ambassador: a German chieftain was transformed into the Lord’s\r\n      anointed; and this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained\r\n      by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe. The Franks were\r\n      absolved from their ancient oath; but a dire anathema was\r\n      thundered against them and their posterity, if they should dare\r\n      to renew the same freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except\r\n      in the holy and meritorious race of the Carlovingian princes.\r\n      Without apprehending the future danger, these princes gloried in\r\n      their present security: the secretary of Charlemagne affirms,\r\n      that the French sceptre was transferred by the authority of the\r\n      popes; 57 and in their boldest enterprises, they insist, with\r\n      confidence, on this signal and successful act of temporal\r\n      jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Besides the common historians, three French\r\n      critics, Launoy, (Opera, tom. v. pars ii. l. vii. epist. 9, p.\r\n      477-487,) Pagi, (Critica, A.D. 751, No. 1-6, A.D. 752, No. 1-10,)\r\n      and Natalis Alexander, (Hist.

In the change of manners and language the patricians of Rome\r\n      58 were far removed from the senate of Romulus, or the palace of\r\n      Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic, or the\r\n      fictitious parents of the emperor. After the recovery of Italy\r\n      and Africa by the arms of Justinian, the importance and danger of\r\n      those remote provinces required the presence of a supreme\r\n      magistrate; he was indifferently styled the exarch or the\r\n      patrician; and these governors of Ravenna, who fill their place\r\n      in the chronology of princes, extended their jurisdiction over\r\n      the Roman city. Since the revolt of Italy and the loss of the\r\n      Exarchate, the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice\r\n      of their independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the\r\n      right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate\r\n      and people successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity\r\n      with the honors of patrician of Rome. The leaders of a powerful\r\n      nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate\r\n      office; but the reign of the Greek emperors was suspended; and,\r\n      in the vacancy of the empire, they derived a more glorious\r\n      commission from the pope and the republic. The Roman ambassadors\r\n      presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of St.\r\n      Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner\r\n      which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the\r\n      church and city. 59 In the time of Charles Martel and of Pepin,\r\n      the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the freedom,\r\n      while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patriciate\r\n      represented only the title, the service, the alliance, of these\r\n      distant protectors. The power and policy of Charlemagne\r\n      annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master. In his first visit to\r\n      the capital, he was received with all the honors which had\r\n      formerly been paid to the exarch, the representative of the\r\n      emperor; and these honors obtained some new decorations from the\r\n      joy and gratitude of Pope Adrian the First. 60 No sooner was he\r\n      informed of the sudden approach of the monarch, than he\r\n      despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him, with\r\n      the banner, about thirty miles from the city. At the distance of\r\n      one mile, the Flaminian way was lined with the schools, or\r\n      national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, &c.: the Roman\r\n      youth were under arms; and the children of a more tender age,\r\n      with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises\r\n      of their great deliverer. At the aspect of the holy crosses, and\r\n      ensigns of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the\r\n      procession of his nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the\r\n      stairs, devoutly kissed each step of the threshold of the\r\n      apostles. In the portico, Adrian expected him at the head of his\r\n      clergy: they embraced, as friends and equals; but in their march\r\n      to the altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the\r\n      pope. Nor was the Frank content with these vain and empty\r\n      demonstrations of respect. In the twenty-six years that elapsed\r\n      between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial coronation,\r\n      Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as his\r\n      own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne. The people swore allegiance\r\n      to his person and family: in his name money was coined, and\r\n      justice was administered; and the election of the popes was\r\n      examined and confirmed by his authority. Except an original and\r\n      self-inherent claim of sovereignty, there was not any prerogative\r\n      remaining, which the title of emperor could add to the patrician\r\n      of Rome. 61\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ For the title and powers of patrician of Rome, see\r\n      Ducange, (Gloss.

Some Carlovingian medals, struck at Rome,\r\n      have engaged Le Blanc to write an elaborate, though partial,\r\n      dissertation on their authority at Rome, both as patricians and\r\n      emperors, (Amsterdam, 1692, in 4to.)]\r\n\r\n      The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these\r\n      obligations, and their names are consecrated, as the saviors and\r\n      benefactors of the Roman church. Her ancient patrimony of farms\r\n      and houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal\r\n      dominion of cities and provinces; and the donation of the\r\n      Exarchate was the first-fruits of the conquests of Pepin. 62\r\n      Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey; the keys and the\r\n      hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the French\r\n      ambassador; and, in his master’s name, he presented them before\r\n      the tomb of St. Peter. The ample measure of the Exarchate 63\r\n      might comprise all the provinces of Italy which had obeyed the\r\n      emperor and his vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were\r\n      included in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its\r\n      inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched along\r\n      the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona, and advanced into the\r\n      midland-country as far as the ridges of the Apennine. In this\r\n      transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes have been\r\n      severely condemned. Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest\r\n      should have rejected an earthly kingdom, which it was not easy\r\n      for him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his\r\n      profession. Perhaps a faithful subject, or even a generous enemy,\r\n      would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the\r\n      Barbarian; and if the emperor had intrusted Stephen to solicit in\r\n      his name the restitution of the Exarchate, I will not absolve the\r\n      pope from the reproach of treachery and falsehood. But in the\r\n      rigid interpretation of the laws, every one may accept, without\r\n      injury, whatever his benefactor can bestow without injustice. The\r\n      Greek emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to the\r\n      Exarchate; and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the stronger\r\n      sword of the Carlovingian. It was not in the cause of the\r\n      Iconoclast that Pepin has exposed his person and army in a double\r\n      expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and might lawfully\r\n      alienate, his conquests: and to the importunities of the Greeks\r\n      he piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him\r\n      to resume the gift which he had conferred on the Roman Pontiff\r\n      for the remission of his sins, and the salvation of his soul. The\r\n      splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute dominion,\r\n      and the world beheld for the first time a Christian bishop\r\n      invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice\r\n      of magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of taxes,\r\n      and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna. In the dissolution of\r\n      the Lombard kingdom, the inhabitants of the duchy of Spoleto 64\r\n      sought a refuge from the storm, shaved their heads after the\r\n      Roman fashion, declared themselves the servants and subjects of\r\n      St. Peter, and completed, by this voluntary surrender, the\r\n      present circle of the ecclesiastical state. That mysterious\r\n      circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent, by the verbal or\r\n      written donation of Charlemagne, 65 who, in the first transports\r\n      of his victory, despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of the\r\n      cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the\r\n      Exarchate. But, in the cooler moments of absence and reflection,\r\n      he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the recent greatness\r\n      of his ecclesiastical ally. The execution of his own and his\r\n      father’s promises was respectfully eluded: the king of the Franks\r\n      and Lombards asserted the inalienable rights of the empire; and,\r\n      in his life and death, Ravenna, 66 as well as Rome, was numbered\r\n      in the list of his metropolitan cities. The sovereignty of the\r\n      Exarchate melted away in the hands of the popes; they found in\r\n      the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic rival: 67 the\r\n      nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest; and in the\r\n      disorders of the times, they could only retain the memory of an\r\n      ancient claim, which, in a more prosperous age, they have revived\r\n      and realized.\r\n\r\n      62 (return) [ Mosheim (Institution, Hist.

The Vatican and Lateran were an arsenal and\r\n      manufacture, which, according to the occasion, have produced or\r\n      concealed a various collection of false or genuine, of corrupt or\r\n      suspicious, acts, as they tended to promote the interest of the\r\n      Roman church. Before the end of the eighth century, some\r\n      apostolic scribe, perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the\r\n      decretals, and the donation of Constantine, the two magic pillars\r\n      of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes. This\r\n      memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of\r\n      Adrian the First, who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the\r\n      liberality, and revive the name, of the great Constantine. 68\r\n      According to the legend, the first of the Christian emperors was\r\n      healed of the leprosy, and purified in the waters of baptism, by\r\n      St. Silvester, the Roman bishop; and never was physician more\r\n      gloriously recompensed. His royal proselyte withdrew from the\r\n      seat and patrimony of St. Peter; declared his resolution of\r\n      founding a new capital in the East; and resigned to the popes;\r\n      the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the\r\n      provinces of the West. 69 This fiction was productive of the most\r\n      beneficial effects. The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt\r\n      of usurpation; and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his\r\n      lawful inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debt of\r\n      gratitude; and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no\r\n      more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty\r\n      portion of the ecclesiastical state. The sovereignty of Rome no\r\n      longer depended on the choice of a fickle people; and the\r\n      successors of St. Peter and Constantine were invested with the\r\n      purple and prerogatives of the Caesars. So deep was the ignorance\r\n      and credulity of the times, that the most absurd of fables was\r\n      received, with equal reverence, in Greece and in France, and is\r\n      still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law. 70 The\r\n      emperors, and the Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery,\r\n      that subverted their rights and freedom; and the only opposition\r\n      proceeded from a Sabine monastery, which, in the beginning of the\r\n      twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of the donation\r\n      of Constantine. 71 In the revival of letters and liberty, this\r\n      fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of Laurentius Valla,\r\n      the pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot. 72 His\r\n      contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his\r\n      sacrilegious boldness; yet such is the silent and irresistible\r\n      progress of reason, that, before the end of the next age, the\r\n      fable was rejected by the contempt of historians 73 and poets, 74\r\n      and the tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the Roman\r\n      church. 75 The popes themselves have indulged a smile at the\r\n      credulity of the vulgar; 76 but a false and obsolete title still\r\n      sanctifies their reign; and, by the same fortune which has\r\n      attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles, the edifice has\r\n      subsisted after the foundations have been undermined.\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ Piissimo Constantino magno, per ejus largitatem S.\r\n      R.

The idols (for\r\n      such they were now held) were secretly cherished by the order and\r\n      the sex most prone to devotion; and the fond alliance of the\r\n      monks and females obtained a final victory over the reason and\r\n      authority of man. Leo the Fourth maintained with less rigor the\r\n      religion of his father and grandfather; but his wife, the fair\r\n      and ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians, the\r\n      heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their\r\n      ancestors. During the life of her husband, these sentiments were\r\n      inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could only labor to\r\n      protect and promote some favorite monks whom she drew from their\r\n      caverns, and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East. But\r\n      as soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son, Irene\r\n      more seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the\r\n      first step of her future persecution was a general edict for\r\n      liberty of conscience.\r\n\r\n      In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were exposed\r\n      to the public veneration; a thousand legends were inverted of\r\n      their sufferings and miracles. By the opportunities of death or\r\n      removal, the episcopal seats were judiciously filled; the most\r\n      eager competitors for earthly or celestial favor anticipated and\r\n      flattered the judgment of their sovereign; and the promotion of\r\n      her secretary Tarasius gave Irene the patriarch of\r\n      Constantinople, and the command of the Oriental church. But the\r\n      decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar\r\n      assembly: 78 the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in\r\n      possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the\r\n      bishops was reechoed by the more formidable clamor of the\r\n      soldiers and people of Constantinople. The delay and intrigues of\r\n      a year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the choice\r\n      of Nice for a second orthodox synod, removed these obstacles; and\r\n      the episcopal conscience was again, after the Greek fashion, in\r\n      the hands of the prince. No more than eighteen days were allowed\r\n      for the consummation of this important work: the Iconoclasts\r\n      appeared, not as judges, but as criminals or penitents: the scene\r\n      was decorated by the legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern\r\n      patriarchs, 79 the decrees were framed by the president Taracius,\r\n      and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of three\r\n      hundred and fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced, that the\r\n      worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the\r\n      fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate whether\r\n      that worship be relative or direct; whether the Godhead, and the\r\n      figure of Christ, be entitled to the same mode of adoration. Of\r\n      this second Nicene council the acts are still extant; a curious\r\n      monument of superstition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly. I\r\n      shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative\r\n      merit of image-worship and morality. A monk had concluded a truce\r\n      with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting his\r\n      daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell. His scruples\r\n      prompted him to consult the abbot. “Rather than abstain from\r\n      adoring Christ and his Mother in their holy images, it would be\r\n      better for you,” replied the casuist, “to enter every brothel,\r\n      and visit every prostitute, in the city.” 80 For the honor of\r\n      orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church, it is\r\n      somewhat unfortunate, that the two princes who convened the two\r\n      councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons.\r\n      The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously\r\n      executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her\r\n      adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her\r\n      friends. During the five succeeding reigns, a period of\r\n      thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated\r\n      rage and various success, between the worshippers and the\r\n      breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with\r\n      minute diligence the repetition of the same events. Nicephorus\r\n      allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only\r\n      virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his\r\n      temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition and weakness formed\r\n      the character of Michael the First, but the saints and images\r\n      were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne. In the\r\n      purple, Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an\r\n      Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were\r\n      condemned to a second exile. Their applause would have sanctified\r\n      the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor,\r\n      the second Michael, was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian\r\n      heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties;\r\n      and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him\r\n      into the opposite scale. His moderation was guarded by timidity;\r\n      but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the\r\n      last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the\r\n      times ran strongly against them; and the emperors who stemmed the\r\n      torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred. After\r\n      the death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was\r\n      achieved by a second female, his widow Theodora, whom he left the\r\n      guardian of the empire. Her measures were bold and decisive. The\r\n      fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of\r\n      her deceased husband; the sentence of the Iconoclast patriarch\r\n      was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of two\r\n      hundred lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and the\r\n      festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph\r\n      of the images. A single question yet remained, whether they are\r\n      endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by\r\n      the Greeks of the eleventh century; 81 and as this opinion has\r\n      the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it\r\n      was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative. In the West,\r\n      Pope Adrian the First accepted and announced the decrees of the\r\n      Nicene assembly, which is now revered by the Catholics as the\r\n      seventh in rank of the general councils. Rome and Italy were\r\n      docile to the voice of their father; but the greatest part of the\r\n      Latin Christians were far behind in the race of superstition. The\r\n      churches of France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle\r\n      course between the adoration and the destruction of images, which\r\n      they admitted into their temples, not as objects of worship, but\r\n      as lively and useful memorials of faith and history. An angry\r\n      book of controversy was composed and published in the name of\r\n      Charlemagne: 82 under his authority a synod of three hundred\r\n      bishops was assembled at Frankfort: 83 they blamed the fury of\r\n      the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a more severe censure\r\n      against the superstition of the Greeks, and the decrees of their\r\n      pretended council, which was long despised by the Barbarians of\r\n      the West. 84 Among them the worship of images advanced with a\r\n      silent and insensible progress; but a large atonement is made for\r\n      their hesitation and delay, by the gross idolatry of the ages\r\n      which precede the reformation, and of the countries, both in\r\n      Europe and America, which are still immersed in the gloom of\r\n      superstition.\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ The remaining history of images, from Irene to\r\n      Theodora, is collected, for the Catholics, by Baronius and Pagi,\r\n      (A.D. 780-840.)

They were compelled to choose between the rival\r\n      nations: religion was not the sole motive of their choice; and\r\n      while they dissembled the failings of their friends, they beheld,\r\n      with reluctance and suspicion, the Catholic virtues of their\r\n      foes. The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the\r\n      enmity of the two capitals; and they were alienated from each\r\n      other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In that schism\r\n      the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty:\r\n      their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a\r\n      jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the\r\n      impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The\r\n      Greek emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored\r\n      the Calabrian estates 85 and the Illyrian diocese, 86 which the\r\n      Iconociasts had torn away from the successors of St. Peter; and\r\n      Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence of excommunication\r\n      unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy. 87 The Greeks\r\n      were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted by the\r\n      breath of the reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious;\r\n      but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion,\r\n      from the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of\r\n      Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes;\r\n      but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a\r\n      statesman, to the various practice of France and Italy. In his\r\n      four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he embraced the popes\r\n      in the communion of friendship and piety; knelt before the tomb,\r\n      and consequently before the image, of the apostle; and joined,\r\n      without scruple, in all the prayers and processions of the Roman\r\n      liturgy. Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to\r\n      renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift\r\n      of the Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of\r\n      Rome? The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of\r\n      Charlemagne; and it was only by reviving the Western empire that\r\n      they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment.\r\n      By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims\r\n      of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial town, the\r\n      majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin Christians would be\r\n      united, under a supreme head, in their ancient metropolis; and\r\n      the conquerors of the West would receive their crown from the\r\n      successors of St. Peter. The Roman church would acquire a zealous\r\n      and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the\r\n      Carlovingian power, the bishop might exercise, with honor and\r\n      safety, the government of the city. 88\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ Theophanes (p. 343) specifies those of Sicily and\r\n      Calabria, which yielded an annual rent of three talents and a\r\n      half of gold, (perhaps 7000 L. sterling.)

The people was less numerous, but the times were more\r\n      savage, the prize more important, and the chair of St. Peter was\r\n      fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the\r\n      rank of sovereign. The reign of Adrian the First 89 surpasses the\r\n      measure of past or succeeding ages; 90 the walls of Rome, the\r\n      sacred patrimony, the ruin of the Lombards, and the friendship of\r\n      Charlemagne, were the trophies of his fame: he secretly edified\r\n      the throne of his successors, and displayed in a narrow space the\r\n      virtues of a great prince. His memory was revered; but in the\r\n      next election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was\r\n      preferred to the nephew and the favorite of Adrian, whom he had\r\n      promoted to the first dignities of the church. Their acquiescence\r\n      or repentance disguised, above four years, the blackest intention\r\n      of revenge, till the day of a procession, when a furious band of\r\n      conspirators dispersed the unarmed multitude, and assaulted with\r\n      blows and wounds the sacred person of the pope. But their\r\n      enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed, perhaps by\r\n      their own confusion and remorse. Leo was left for dead on the\r\n      ground: on his revival from the swoon, the effect of his loss of\r\n      blood, he recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event\r\n      was improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and\r\n      tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by the\r\n      knife of the assassins. 91 From his prison he escaped to the\r\n      Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue, Charlemagne\r\n      sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of Paderborn in\r\n      Westphalia accepted, or solicited, a visit from the Roman\r\n      pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps with a commission of counts and\r\n      bishops, the guards of his safety and the judges of his\r\n      innocence; and it was not without reluctance, that the conqueror\r\n      of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing year the personal\r\n      discharge of this pious office. In his fourth and last\r\n      pilgrimage, he was received at Rome with the due honors of king\r\n      and patrician: Leo was permitted to purge himself by oath of the\r\n      crimes imputed to his charge: his enemies were silenced, and the\r\n      sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild\r\n      and insufficient penalty of exile. On the festival of Christmas,\r\n      the last year of the eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the\r\n      church of St. Peter; and, to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had\r\n      exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a\r\n      patrician. 92 After the celebration of the holy mysteries, Leo\r\n      suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, 93 and the dome\r\n      resounded with the acclamations of the people, “Long life and\r\n      victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God the\r\n      great and pacific emperor of the Romans!” The head and body of\r\n      Charlemagne were consecrated by the royal unction: after the\r\n      example of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff:\r\n      his coronation oath represents a promise to maintain the faith\r\n      and privileges of the church; and the first-fruits were paid in\r\n      his rich offerings to the shrine of his apostle. In his familiar\r\n      conversation, the emperor protested the ignorance of the\r\n      intentions of Leo, which he would have disappointed by his\r\n      absence on that memorable day. But the preparations of the\r\n      ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of\r\n      Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had\r\n      acknowledged that the Imperial title was the object of his\r\n      ambition, and a Roman synod had pronounced, that it was the only\r\n      adequate reward of his merit and services. 94\r\n\r\n      89 (return) [ His merits and hopes are summed up in an epitaph of\r\n      thirty-eight-verses, of which Charlemagne declares himself the\r\n      author, (Concil. tom. viii. p. 520.)

Of his moral virtues, chastity is\r\n      not the most conspicuous: 96 but the public happiness could not\r\n      be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines, the\r\n      various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the\r\n      multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church, and the\r\n      long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters, 97 whom\r\n      the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion. 971 I\r\n      shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a\r\n      conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his\r\n      brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, and the\r\n      four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same\r\n      spot, would have something to allege against the justice and\r\n      humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons\r\n      98 was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less\r\n      sanguinary than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives,\r\n      whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper.\r\n      The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind\r\n      and body; and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished\r\n      at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him at\r\n      the most distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war,\r\n      nor summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy\r\n      cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the\r\n      geography of his expeditions. 981 But this activity was a\r\n      national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a\r\n      Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military\r\n      adventures; and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished\r\n      only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose. His\r\n      military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his\r\n      enemies, and his actions. Alexander conquered with the arms of\r\n      Philip, but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed\r\n      him their name, their examples, and the companions of their\r\n      victories. At the head of his veteran and superior armies, he\r\n      oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of\r\n      confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever encounter\r\n      an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The\r\n      science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace;\r\n      but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of\r\n      singular difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy,\r\n      the Saracen trophies of his grandfather. After the Spanish\r\n      expedition, his rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean\r\n      mountains; and the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable,\r\n      and whose valor was useless, might accuse, with their last\r\n      breath, the want of skill or caution of their general. 99 I touch\r\n      with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a\r\n      respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a series, of\r\n      occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses, the\r\n      reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his\r\n      poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the\r\n      laws and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however\r\n      feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate\r\n      evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government;\r\n      100 but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general\r\n      views and the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives\r\n      himself for the benefit of posterity. The union and stability of\r\n      his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated the\r\n      dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons; and\r\n      after his numerous diets, the whole constitution was left to\r\n      fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism. His\r\n      esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to\r\n      intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil\r\n      jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and\r\n      degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the\r\n      imprudence of his father. His laws enforced the imposition of\r\n      tithes, because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the\r\n      default of payment had been the cause of the last scarcity. 101\r\n      The literary merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation\r\n      of schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were\r\n      published in his name, and his familiar connection with the\r\n      subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate\r\n      both the prince and people. His own studies were tardy,\r\n      laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood\r\n      Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation,\r\n      rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor\r\n      strove to acquire the practice of writing, which every peasant\r\n      now learns in his infancy. 102 The grammar and logic, the music\r\n      and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated as the\r\n      handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of the human mind\r\n      must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of\r\n      learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the\r\n      character of Charlemagne. 103 The dignity of his person, 104 the\r\n      length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigor of his\r\n      government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him\r\n      from the royal crowd; and Europe dates a new aera from his\r\n      restoration of the Western empire.\r\n\r\n      95 (return) [ By Mably, (Observations sur l’Histoire de France,)\r\n      Voltaire, (Histoire Generale,) Robertson, (History of Charles\r\n      V.,) and Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, l. xxxi. c. 18.)

The Roman province of Gaul had been\r\n      transformed into the name and monarchy of France; but, in the\r\n      decay of the Merovingian line, its limits were contracted by the\r\n      independence of the Britons and the revolt of Aquitain.\r\n      Charlemagne pursued, and confined, the Britons on the shores of\r\n      the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, whose origin and language\r\n      are so different from the French, was chastised by the imposition\r\n      of tribute, hostages, and peace. After a long and evasive\r\n      contest, the rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by\r\n      the forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their lives.\r\n\r\n      Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious\r\n      governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the\r\n      palace. But a recent discovery 107 has proved that these unhappy\r\n      princes were the last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre\r\n      of Clovis, and younger branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of\r\n      the Merovingian house. Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the\r\n      duchy of Gascogne, to the counties of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at\r\n      the foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the\r\n      beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving their\r\n      Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel the injustice,\r\n      or the favors, of a third dynasty. By the reunion of Aquitain,\r\n      France was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions\r\n      of the Netherlands and Spain, as far as the Rhine. II.\r\n\r\n      The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and\r\n      father of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part\r\n      of Spain, from the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst\r\n      their civil divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his\r\n      protection in the diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook the\r\n      expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction of faith,\r\n      impartially crushed the resistance of the Christians, and\r\n      rewarded the obedience and services of the Mahometans. In his\r\n      absence he instituted the Spanish march, 108 which extended from\r\n      the Pyrenees to the River Ebro: Barcelona was the residence of\r\n      the French governor: he possessed the counties of Rousillon and\r\n      Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were\r\n      subject to his jurisdiction. III. As king of the Lombards, and\r\n      patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of Italy,\r\n      109 a tract of a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of\r\n      Calabria. The duchy of Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had spread, at\r\n      the expense of the Greeks, over the modern kingdom of Naples. But\r\n      Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused to be included in the\r\n      slavery of his country; assumed the independent title of prince;\r\n      and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian monarchy. His defence\r\n      was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and the emperor was\r\n      content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his fortresses,\r\n      and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord. The\r\n      artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of\r\n      father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and Benventum\r\n      insensibly escaped from the French yoke. 110 IV. Charlemagne was\r\n      the first who united Germany under the same sceptre. The name of\r\n      Oriental France is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the\r\n      people of Hesse and Thuringia were recently incorporated with the\r\n      victors, by the conformity of religion and government. The\r\n      Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals\r\n      and confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed\r\n      within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland. The\r\n      Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and manners,\r\n      were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of Tasillo\r\n      justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their\r\n      power was shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that\r\n      important frontier. But the north of Germany, from the Rhine and\r\n      beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till\r\n      after a war of thirty-three years that the Saxons bowed under the\r\n      yoke of Christ and of Charlemagne. The idols and their votaries\r\n      were extirpated: the foundation of eight bishoprics, of Munster,\r\n      Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen, Verden, Hildesheim,\r\n      and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the Weser, the bounds\r\n      of ancient Saxony these episcopal seats were the first schools\r\n      and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity of\r\n      the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the\r\n      parents. Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar\r\n      manners and various denominations, overspread the modern\r\n      dominions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient\r\n      marks of obedience have tempted the French historian to extend\r\n      the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or\r\n      conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but the\r\n      first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly\r\n      ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the\r\n      Avars, or Huns of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had\r\n      inflicted on the nations. Their rings, the wooden fortifications\r\n      which encircled their districts and villages, were broken down by\r\n      the triple effort of a French army, that was poured into their\r\n      country by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and\r\n      along the plain of the Danube. After a bloody conflict of eight\r\n      years, the loss of some French generals was avenged by the\r\n      slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the nation\r\n      submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and\r\n      unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty\r\n      years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches\r\n      of Italy and Gaul. 111 After the reduction of Pannonia, the\r\n      empire of Charlemagne was bounded only by the conflux of the\r\n      Danube with the Teyss and the Save: the provinces of Istria,\r\n      Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy, though unprofitable,\r\n      accession; and it was an effect of his moderation, that he left\r\n      the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the\r\n      Greeks. But these distant possessions added more to the\r\n      reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he\r\n      risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians\r\n      from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of\r\n      communication between the rivers, the Saone and the Meuse, the\r\n      Rhine and the Danube, were faintly attempted. 112 Their execution\r\n      would have vivified the empire; and more cost and labor were\r\n      often wasted in the structure of a cathedral. 1121\r\n\r\n      105 (return) [ See the concise, but correct and original, work of\r\n      D’Anville, (Etats Formes en Europe apres la Chute de l’Empire\r\n      Romain en Occident, Paris, 1771, in 4to.,) whose map includes the\r\n      empire of Charlemagne; the different parts are illustrated, by\r\n      Valesius (Notitia Galliacum) for France, Beretti (Dissertatio\r\n      Chorographica) for Italy, De Marca (Marca Hispanica) for Spain.\r\n      For the middle geography of Germany, I confess myself poor and\r\n      destitute.]\r\n\r\n      106 (return) [ After a brief relation of his wars and conquests,\r\n      (Vit.

The personal and\r\n      political importance of Charlemagne was magnified by the distress\r\n      and division of the rest of Europe. The islands of Great Britain\r\n      and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or\r\n      Scottish origin: and, after the loss of Spain, the Christian and\r\n      Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow\r\n      range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns revered\r\n      the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch, implored the\r\n      honor and support of his alliance, and styled him their common\r\n      parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the West. 113 He\r\n      maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al\r\n      Rashid, 114 whose dominion stretched from Africa to India, and\r\n      accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a water-clock, an elephant,\r\n      and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. It is not easy to conceive\r\n      the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab, who were strangers\r\n      to each other’s person, and language, and religion: but their\r\n      public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their remote\r\n      situation left no room for a competition of interest. Two thirds\r\n      of the Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne, and\r\n      the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the\r\n      inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany. But in the choice\r\n      of his enemies, 1141 we may be reasonably surprised that he so\r\n      often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the\r\n      south. The three-and-thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the\r\n      woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the\r\n      amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from Italy\r\n      and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the Greeks would\r\n      have insured an easy victory; and the holy crusade against the\r\n      Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and\r\n      loudly justified by religion and policy. Perhaps, in his\r\n      expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe, he aspired to save his\r\n      monarchy from the fate of the Roman empire, to disarm the enemies\r\n      of civilized society, and to eradicate the seed of future\r\n      emigrations. But it has been wisely observed, that, in a light of\r\n      precaution, all conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be\r\n      universal, since the increasing circle must be involved in a\r\n      larger sphere of hostility. 115 The subjugation of Germany\r\n      withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or\r\n      islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened\r\n      the torpid courage of their barbarous natives. The fiercest of\r\n      the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian tyrant to their\r\n      brethren of the North; the Ocean and Mediterranean were covered\r\n      with their piratical fleets; and Charlemagne beheld with a sigh\r\n      the destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less than\r\n      seventy years, precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.\r\n\r\n      113 (return) [ See Eginhard, c. 16, and Gaillard, tom. ii. p.\r\n      361-385, who mentions, with a loose reference, the intercourse of\r\n      Charlemagne and Egbert, the emperor’s gift of his own sword, and\r\n      the modest answer of his Saxon disciple.

But\r\n      the association of his son Lewis the Pious asserts the\r\n      independent right of monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems\r\n      on this occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims\r\n      of the clergy. The royal youth was commanded to take the crown\r\n      from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his head,\r\n      as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the nation. 116\r\n      The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the\r\n      subsequent associations of Lothaire and Lewis the Second: the\r\n      Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a\r\n      lineal descent of four generations; and the ambition of the popes\r\n      was reduced to the empty honor of crowning and anointing these\r\n      hereditary princes, who were already invested with their power\r\n      and dominions. The pious Lewis survived his brothers, and\r\n      embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne; but the nations and the\r\n      nobles, his bishops and his children, quickly discerned that this\r\n      mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul; and the\r\n      foundations were undermined to the centre, while the external\r\n      surface was yet fair and entire. After a war, or battle, which\r\n      consumed one hundred thousand Franks, the empire was divided by\r\n      treaty between his three sons, who had violated every filial and\r\n      fraternal duty. The kingdoms of Germany and France were forever\r\n      separated; the provinces of Gaul, between the Rhone and the Alps,\r\n      the Meuse and the Rhine, were assigned, with Italy, to the\r\n      Imperial dignity of Lothaire. In the partition of his share,\r\n      Lorraine and Arles, two recent and transitory kingdoms, were\r\n      bestowed on the younger children; and Lewis the Second, his\r\n      eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the proper and\r\n      sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor. On his death without any\r\n      male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and\r\n      cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of\r\n      judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing\r\n      on the most obsequious, or most liberal, the Imperial office of\r\n      advocate of the Roman church. The dregs of the Carlovingian race\r\n      no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power, and the\r\n      ridiculous epithets of the bard, the stammerer, the fat, and the\r\n      simple, distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of\r\n      kings alike deserving of oblivion. By the failure of the\r\n      collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to Charles\r\n      the Fat, the last emperor of his family: his insanity authorized\r\n      the desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a\r\n      diet, and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose\r\n      contempt his life and liberty had been spared. According to the\r\n      measure of their force, the governors, the bishops, and the\r\n      lords, usurped the fragments of the falling empire; and some\r\n      preference was shown to the female or illegitimate blood of\r\n      Charlemagne. Of the greater part, the title and possession were\r\n      alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate to the contracted\r\n      scale of their dominions. Those who could appear with an army at\r\n      the gates of Rome were crowned emperors in the Vatican; but their\r\n      modesty was more frequently satisfied with the appellation of\r\n      kings of Italy: and the whole term of seventy-four years may be\r\n      deemed a vacancy, from the abdication of Charles the Fat to the\r\n      establishment of Otho the First.\r\n\r\n      116 (return) [ Thegan, the biographer of Lewis, relates this\r\n      coronation: and Baronius has honestly transcribed it, (A.D. 813,\r\n      No. 13, &c.

His father, Henry the Fowler, was\r\n      elected, by the suffrage of the nation, to save and institute the\r\n      kingdom of Germany. Its limits 118 were enlarged on every side by\r\n      his son, the first and greatest of the Othos. A portion of Gaul,\r\n      to the west of the Rhine, along the banks of the Meuse and the\r\n      Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose blood and language\r\n      it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and Tacitus.\r\n\r\n      Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the successors of\r\n      Otho acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of\r\n      Burgundy and Arles. In the North, Christianity was propagated by\r\n      the sword of Otho, the conqueror and apostle of the Slavic\r\n      nations of the Elbe and Oder: the marches of Brandenburgh and\r\n      Sleswick were fortified with German colonies; and the king of\r\n      Denmark, the dukes of Poland and Bohemia, confessed themselves\r\n      his tributary vassals. At the head of a victorious army, he\r\n      passed the Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the\r\n      pope, and forever fixed the Imperial crown in the name and nation\r\n      of Germany. From that memorable aera, two maxims of public\r\n      jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time. I.\r\n      That the prince, who was elected in the German diet, acquired,\r\n      from that instant, the subject kingdoms of Italy and Rome.

The Italians,\r\n      Muratori for instance, are more scrupulous and correct, and only\r\n      reckon the princes who have been crowned at Rome.]\r\n\r\n      The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the East by\r\n      the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting his fathers,\r\n      the Greek emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and\r\n      familiar appellation of brother. 120 Perhaps in his connection\r\n      with Irene he aspired to the name of husband: his embassy to\r\n      Constantinople spoke the language of peace and friendship, and\r\n      might conceal a treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess,\r\n      who had renounced the most sacred duties of a mother. The nature,\r\n      the duration, the probable consequences of such a union between\r\n      two distant and dissonant empires, it is impossible to\r\n      conjecture; but the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us\r\n      to suspect, that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene,\r\n      to charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to\r\n      the strangers of the West. 121 The French ambassadors were the\r\n      spectators, and had nearly been the victims, of the conspiracy of\r\n      Nicephorus, and the national hatred. Constantinople was\r\n      exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of ancient Rome: a\r\n      proverb, “That the Franks were good friends and bad neighbors,”\r\n      was in every one’s mouth; but it was dangerous to provoke a\r\n      neighbor who might be tempted to reiterate, in the church of St.\r\n      Sophia, the ceremony of his Imperial coronation. After a tedious\r\n      journey of circuit and delay, the ambassadors of Nicephorus found\r\n      him in his camp, on the banks of the River Sala; and Charlemagne\r\n      affected to confound their vanity by displaying, in a Franconian\r\n      village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the Byzantine\r\n      palace. 122 The Greeks were successively led through four halls\r\n      of audience: in the first they were ready to fall prostrate\r\n      before a splendid personage in a chair of state, till he informed\r\n      them that he was only a servant, the constable, or master of the\r\n      horse, of the emperor. The same mistake, and the same answer,\r\n      were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine, the\r\n      steward, and the chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually\r\n      heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown\r\n      open, and they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne,\r\n      enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled\r\n      with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs. A treaty of\r\n      peace and alliance was concluded between the two empires, and the\r\n      limits of the East and West were defined by the right of present\r\n      possession. But the Greeks 123 soon forgot this humiliating\r\n      equality, or remembered it only to hate the Barbarians by whom it\r\n      was extorted. During the short union of virtue and power, they\r\n      respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne, with the\r\n      acclamations of basileus, and emperor of the Romans. As soon as\r\n      these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son,\r\n      the Byzantine letters were inscribed, “To the king, or, as he\r\n      styles himself, the emperor of the Franks and Lombards.” When\r\n      both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled Lewis the\r\n      Second of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous\r\n      appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the crowd of Latin\r\n      princes. His reply 124 is expressive of his weakness: he proves,\r\n      with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the\r\n      name of king is synonymous with the Greek word basileus: if, at\r\n      Constantinople, it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial\r\n      sense, he claims from his ancestors, and from the popes, a just\r\n      participation of the honors of the Roman purple. The same\r\n      controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos; and their\r\n      ambassador describes, in lively colors, the insolence of the\r\n      Byzantine court. 125 The Greeks affected to despise the poverty\r\n      and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons; and in their last decline\r\n      refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the title of Roman\r\n      emperors.\r\n\r\n      120 (return) [ Invidiam tamen suscepti nominis (C.

In the Christian aristocracy, the principal members of\r\n      the clergy still formed a senate to assist the administration,\r\n      and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop. Rome was divided into\r\n      twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was governed by a cardinal\r\n      priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common or modest in\r\n      its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple of kings. Their\r\n      number was enlarged by the association of the seven deacons of\r\n      the most considerable hospitals, the seven palatine judges of the\r\n      Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church. This ecclesiastical\r\n      senate was directed by the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman\r\n      province, who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia,\r\n      Porto, Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines,\r\n      than by their weekly service in the Lateran, and their superior\r\n      share in the honors and authority of the apostolic see. On the\r\n      death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor to the\r\n      suffrage of the college of cardinals, 126 and their choice was\r\n      ratified or rejected by the applause or clamor of the Roman\r\n      people. But the election was imperfect; nor could the pontiff be\r\n      legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the church,\r\n      had graciously signified his approbation and consent. The royal\r\n      commissioner examined, on the spot, the form and freedom of the\r\n      proceedings; nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the\r\n      qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath of\r\n      fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had successively\r\n      enriched the patrimony of St. Peter. In the frequent schisms, the\r\n      rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor; and\r\n      in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge, to condemn, and to\r\n      punish, the crimes of a guilty pontiff. Otho the First imposed a\r\n      treaty on the senate and people, who engaged to prefer the\r\n      candidate most acceptable to his majesty: 127 his successors\r\n      anticipated or prevented their choice: they bestowed the Roman\r\n      benefice, like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their\r\n      chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit of a\r\n      Frank or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the interposition\r\n      of foreign power. These acts of prerogative were most speciously\r\n      excused by the vices of a popular election. The competitor who\r\n      had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the passions or\r\n      avarice of the multitude; the Vatican and the Lateran were\r\n      stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises\r\n      of Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in\r\n      a long and disgraceful servitude. The Roman pontiffs, of the\r\n      ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned, and\r\n      murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their indigence, after\r\n      the loss and usurpation of the ecclesiastical patrimonies, that\r\n      they could neither support the state of a prince, nor exercise\r\n      the charity of a priest. 128 The influence of two sister\r\n      prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora, was founded on their wealth\r\n      and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most\r\n      strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and\r\n      their reign 129 may have suggested to the darker ages 130 the\r\n      fable 131 of a female pope. 132 The bastard son, the grandson,\r\n      and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were seated\r\n      in the chair of St. Peter, and it was at the age of nineteen\r\n      years that the second of these became the head of the Latin\r\n      church. 1321 His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion;\r\n      and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges\r\n      that were urged against him in a Roman synod, and in the presence\r\n      of Otho the Great. As John XII. had renounced the dress and\r\n      decencies of his profession, the soldier may not perhaps be\r\n      dishonored by the wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt,\r\n      the flames that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming\r\n      and hunting. His open simony might be the consequence of\r\n      distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus, if\r\n      it be true, could not possibly be serious. But we read, with some\r\n      surprise, that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public\r\n      adultery with the matrons of Rome; that the Lateran palace was\r\n      turned into a school for prostitution, and that his rapes of\r\n      virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting\r\n      the tomb of St. Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be\r\n      violated by his successor. 133 The Protestants have dwelt with\r\n      malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to a\r\n      philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous\r\n      than their virtues. After a long series of scandal, the apostolic\r\n      see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory\r\n      VII. That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two\r\n      projects. I. To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and\r\n      independence of election, and forever to abolish the right or\r\n      usurpation of the emperors and the Roman people. II. To bestow\r\n      and resume the Western empire as a fief or benefice 134 of the\r\n      church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings and\r\n      kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty years, the first\r\n      of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the\r\n      ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with that of\r\n      their chief. But the second attempt, though it was crowned with\r\n      some partial and apparent success, has been vigorously resisted\r\n      by the secular power, and finally extinguished by the improvement\r\n      of human reason.\r\n\r\n      126 (return) [ The origin and progress of the title of cardinal\r\n      may be found in Themassin, (Discipline de l’Eglise, tom. i. p.\r\n      1261-1298,) Muratori, (Antiquitat.

But the Romans were free to choose a master for themselves;\r\n      and the powers which had been delegated to the patrician, were\r\n      irrevocably granted to the French and Saxon emperors of the West.\r\n      The broken records of the times 135 preserve some remembrance of\r\n      their palace, their mint, their tribunal, their edicts, and the\r\n      sword of justice, which, as late as the thirteenth century, was\r\n      derived from Caesar to the praefect of the city. 136 Between the\r\n      arts of the popes and the violence of the people, this supremacy\r\n      was crushed and annihilated. Content with the titles of emperor\r\n      and Augustus, the successors of Charlemagne neglected to assert\r\n      this local jurisdiction. In the hour of prosperity, their\r\n      ambition was diverted by more alluring objects; and in the decay\r\n      and division of the empire, they were oppressed by the defence of\r\n      their hereditary provinces. Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous\r\n      Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character of\r\n      her third husband; and Hugh, king of Burgundy was introduced by\r\n      her faction into the mole of Hadrian or Castle of St. Angelo,\r\n      which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome. Her son\r\n      by the first marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the\r\n      nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful service was\r\n      chastised with a blow by his new father. The blow was productive\r\n      of a revolution. “Romans,” exclaimed the youth, “once you were\r\n      the masters of the world, and these Burgundians the most abject\r\n      of your slaves. They now reign, these voracious and brutal\r\n      savages, and my injury is the commencement of your servitude.”\r\n      137 The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city:\r\n      the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame; Marozia was\r\n      imprisoned by her victorious son, and his brother, Pope John XI.,\r\n      was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions. With the\r\n      title of prince, Alberic possessed above twenty years the\r\n      government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the popular\r\n      prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title, of\r\n      consuls and tribunes. His son and heir Octavian assumed, with the\r\n      pontificate, the name of John XII.: like his predecessor, he was\r\n      provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the\r\n      church and republic; and the services of Otho were rewarded with\r\n      the Imperial dignity. But the Saxon was imperious, the Romans\r\n      were impatient, the festival of the coronation was disturbed by\r\n      the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom, and Otho\r\n      commanded his sword-bearer not to stir from his person, lest he\r\n      should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar. 138\r\n      Before he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised the revolt of\r\n      the people and the ingratitude of John XII. The pope was degraded\r\n      in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass, whipped through\r\n      the city, and cast into a dungeon; thirteen of the most guilty\r\n      were hanged, others were mutilated or banished; and this severe\r\n      process was justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and\r\n      Justinian. The voice of fame has accused the second Otho of a\r\n      perfidious and bloody act, the massacre of the senators, whom he\r\n      had invited to his table under the fair semblance of hospitality\r\n      and friendship. 139 In the minority of his son Otho the Third,\r\n      Rome made a bold attempt to shake off the Saxon yoke, and the\r\n      consul Crescentius was the Brutus of the republic. From the\r\n      condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to the command\r\n      of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created the popes, and\r\n      formed a conspiracy for restoring the authority of the Greek\r\n      emperors. 1391 In the fortress of St. Angelo, he maintained an\r\n      obstinate siege, till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a\r\n      promise of safety: his body was suspended on a gibbet, and his\r\n      head was exposed on the battlements of the castle. By a reverse\r\n      of fortune, Otho, after separating his troops, was besieged three\r\n      days, without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful escape saved\r\n      him from the justice or fury of the Romans. The senator Ptolemy\r\n      was the leader of the people, and the widow of Crescentius\r\n      enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband, by a\r\n      poison which she administered to her Imperial lover. It was the\r\n      design of Otho the Third to abandon the ruder countries of the\r\n      North, to erect his throne in Italy, and to revive the\r\n      institutions of the Roman monarchy. But his successors only once\r\n      in their lives appeared on the banks of the Tyber, to receive\r\n      their crown in the Vatican. 140 Their absence was contemptible,\r\n      their presence odious and formidable. They descended from the\r\n      Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers and\r\n      enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a scene of\r\n      tumult and bloodshed. 141 A faint remembrance of their ancestors\r\n      still tormented the Romans; and they beheld with pious\r\n      indignation the succession of Saxons, Franks, Swabians, and\r\n      Bohemians, who usurped the purple and prerogatives of the\r\n      Caesars.\r\n\r\n      135 (return) [ For the history of the emperors in Rome and Italy,\r\n      see Sigonius, de Regno Italiae, Opp. tom. ii., with the Notes of\r\n      Saxius, and the Annals of Muratori, who might refer more\r\n      distinctly to the authors of his great collection.]\r\n\r\n      136 (return) [ See the Dissertations of Le Blanc at the end of\r\n      his treatise des Monnoyes de France, in which he produces some\r\n      Roman coins of the French emperors.]\r\n\r\n      137 (return) [ Romanorum aliquando servi, scilicet Burgundiones,\r\n      Romanis imperent?....

A torrent of\r\n      Barbarians may pass over the earth, but an extensive empire must\r\n      be supported by a refined system of policy and oppression; in the\r\n      centre, an absolute power, prompt in action and rich in\r\n      resources; a swift and easy communication with the extreme parts;\r\n      fortifications to check the first effort of rebellion; a regular\r\n      administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined army\r\n      to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and despair. Far\r\n      different was the situation of the German Caesars, who were\r\n      ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy. Their patrimonial\r\n      estates were stretched along the Rhine, or scattered in the\r\n      provinces; but this ample domain was alienated by the imprudence\r\n      or distress of successive princes; and their revenue, from minute\r\n      and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the\r\n      maintenance of their household. Their troops were formed by the\r\n      legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed\r\n      the Alps with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and\r\n      disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the\r\n      campaign. Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential\r\n      influence of the climate: the survivors brought back the bones of\r\n      their princes and nobles, 142 and the effects of their own\r\n      intemperance were often imputed to the treachery and malice of\r\n      the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the calamities of the\r\n      Barbarians. This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms\r\n      with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor can the people, or the\r\n      reader, be much interested in the event of the quarrel. But in\r\n      the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Lombards rekindled the\r\n      flame of industry and freedom; and the generous example was at\r\n      length imitated by the republics of Tuscany. 1421 In the Italian\r\n      cities a municipal government had never been totally abolished;\r\n      and their first privileges were granted by the favor and policy\r\n      of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier\r\n      against the independence of the nobles. But their rapid progress,\r\n      the daily extension of their power and pretensions, were founded\r\n      on the numbers and spirit of these rising communities. 143 Each\r\n      city filled the measure of her diocese or district: the\r\n      jurisdiction of the counts and bishops, of the marquises and\r\n      counts, was banished from the land; and the proudest nobles were\r\n      persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary castles, and to\r\n      embrace the more honorable character of freemen and magistrates.\r\n      The legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly;\r\n      but the executive powers were intrusted to three consuls,\r\n      annually chosen from the three orders of captains, valvassors,\r\n      144 and commons, into which the republic was divided. Under the\r\n      protection of equal law, the labors of agriculture and commerce\r\n      were gradually revived; but the martial spirit of the Lombards\r\n      was nourished by the presence of danger; and as often as the bell\r\n      was rung, or the standard 145 erected, the gates of the city\r\n      poured forth a numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their\r\n      own cause was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms. At\r\n      the foot of these popular ramparts, the pride of the Caesars was\r\n      overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed over\r\n      the two Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle age; the\r\n      first, superior perhaps in military prowess; the second, who\r\n      undoubtedly excelled in the softer accomplishments of peace and\r\n      learning.\r\n\r\n      142 (return) [ After boiling away the flesh.

Muratori Antiquitat tom. ii. dis.\r\n      xxvi. p. 489-493.)]\r\n\r\n      Ambitious of restoring the splendor of the purple, Frederic the\r\n      First invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts of a\r\n      statesman, the valor of a soldier, and the cruelty of a tyrant.\r\n      The recent discovery of the Pandects had renewed a science most\r\n      favorable to despotism; and his venal advocates proclaimed the\r\n      emperor the absolute master of the lives and properties of his\r\n      subjects. His royal prerogatives, in a less odious sense, were\r\n      acknowledged in the diet of Roncaglia; and the revenue of Italy\r\n      was fixed at thirty thousand pounds of silver, 146 which were\r\n      multiplied to an indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal\r\n      officers. The obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the\r\n      force of his arms: his captives were delivered to the\r\n      executioner, or shot from his military engines; and. after the\r\n      siege and surrender of Milan, the buildings of that stately\r\n      capital were razed to the ground, three hundred hostages were\r\n      sent into Germany, and the inhabitants were dispersed in four\r\n      villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror. 147 But\r\n      Milan soon rose from her ashes; and the league of Lombardy was\r\n      cemented by distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, Pope\r\n      Alexander the Third, and the Greek emperor: the fabric of\r\n      oppression was overturned in a day; and in the treaty of\r\n      Constance, Frederic subscribed, with some reservations, the\r\n      freedom of four-and-twenty cities. His grandson contended with\r\n      their vigor and maturity; but Frederic the Second 148 was endowed\r\n      with some personal and peculiar advantages. His birth and\r\n      education recommended him to the Italians; and in the implacable\r\n      discord of the two factions, the Ghibelins were attached to the\r\n      emperor, while the Guelfs displayed the banner of liberty and the\r\n      church. The court of Rome had slumbered, when his father Henry\r\n      the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of\r\n      Naples and Sicily; and from these hereditary realms the son\r\n      derived an ample and ready supply of troops and treasure. Yet\r\n      Frederic the Second was finally oppressed by the arms of the\r\n      Lombards and the thunders of the Vatican: his kingdom was given\r\n      to a stranger, and the last of his family was beheaded at Naples\r\n      on a public scaffold. During sixty years, no emperor appeared in\r\n      Italy, and the name was remembered only by the ignominious sale\r\n      of the last relics of sovereignty.\r\n\r\n      146 (return) [ Gunther Ligurinus, l. viii. 584, et seq., apud\r\n      Schmidt, tom. iii. p. 399.]\r\n\r\n      147 (return) [ Solus imperator faciem suam firmavit ut petram,\r\n      (Burcard. de Excidio Mediolani, Script.

The persons of the Germans were free, their conquests\r\n      were their own, and their national character was animated by a\r\n      spirit which scorned the servile jurisprudence of the new or the\r\n      ancient Rome. It would have been a vain and dangerous attempt to\r\n      impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who were impatient of a\r\n      magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful,\r\n      who aspired to command. The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was\r\n      distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the\r\n      counts of the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches\r\n      or frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority as\r\n      it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the first Caesars.\r\n      The Roman governors, who, for the most part, were soldiers of\r\n      fortune, seduced their mercenary legions, assumed the Imperial\r\n      purple, and either failed or succeeded in their revolt, without\r\n      wounding the power and unity of government. If the dukes,\r\n      margraves, and counts of Germany, were less audacious in their\r\n      claims, the consequences of their success were more lasting and\r\n      pernicious to the state. Instead of aiming at the supreme rank,\r\n      they silently labored to establish and appropriate their\r\n      provincial independence. Their ambition was seconded by the\r\n      weight of their estates and vassals, their mutual example and\r\n      support, the common interest of the subordinate nobility, the\r\n      change of princes and families, the minorities of Otho the Third\r\n      and Henry the Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain\r\n      pursuit of the fugitive crowns of Italy and Rome. All the\r\n      attributes of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually\r\n      usurped by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace\r\n      and war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign\r\n      alliance and domestic economy. Whatever had been seized by\r\n      violence, was ratified by favor or distress, was granted as the\r\n      price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service; whatever had\r\n      been granted to one could not, without injury, be denied to his\r\n      successor or equal; and every act of local or temporary\r\n      possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the\r\n      Germanic kingdom. In every province, the visible presence of the\r\n      duke or count was interposed between the throne and the nobles;\r\n      the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief;\r\n      and the standard which he received from his sovereign, was often\r\n      raised against him in the field. The temporal power of the clergy\r\n      was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of the\r\n      Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who blindly depended on their\r\n      moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of Germany were made\r\n      equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and population,\r\n      to the most ample states of the military order. As long as the\r\n      emperors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy\r\n      these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause was\r\n      maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and\r\n      favorites. But in the quarrel of the investitures, they were\r\n      deprived of their influence over the episcopal chapters; the\r\n      freedom of election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced,\r\n      by a solemn mockery, to his first prayers, the recommendation,\r\n      once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church. The\r\n      secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of a\r\n      superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers.\r\n      In the first age of the monarchy, the appointment of the son to\r\n      the duchy or county of his father, was solicited as a favor; it\r\n      was gradually obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the\r\n      lineal succession was often extended to the collateral or female\r\n      branches; the states of the empire (their popular, and at length\r\n      their legal, appellation) were divided and alienated by testament\r\n      and sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a\r\n      private and perpetual inheritance. The emperor could not even be\r\n      enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and extinction: within\r\n      the term of a year, he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief;\r\n      and, in the choice of the candidate, it was his duty to consult\r\n      either the general or the provincial diet.\r\n\r\n      After the death of Frederic the Second, Germany was left a\r\n      monster with a hundred heads. A crowd of princes and prelates\r\n      disputed the ruins of the empire: the lords of innumerable\r\n      castles were less prone to obey, than to imitate, their\r\n      superiors; and, according to the measure of their strength, their\r\n      incessant hostilities received the names of conquest or robbery.\r\n      Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws and\r\n      manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of France and Italy were\r\n      shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But\r\n      the Italian cities and the French vassals were divided and\r\n      destroyed, while the union of the Germans has produced, under the\r\n      name of an empire, a great system of a federative republic. In\r\n      the frequent and at last the perpetual institution of diets, a\r\n      national spirit was kept alive, and the powers of a common\r\n      legislature are still exercised by the three branches or colleges\r\n      of the electors, the princes, and the free and Imperial cities of\r\n      Germany. I. Seven of the most powerful feudatories were permitted\r\n      to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive\r\n      privilege of choosing the Roman emperor; and these electors were\r\n      the king of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of\r\n      Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the three\r\n      archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne. II. The college\r\n      of princes and prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous\r\n      multitude: they reduced to four representative votes the long\r\n      series of independent counts, and excluded the nobles or\r\n      equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in the Polish diets,\r\n      had appeared on horseback in the field of election. III. The\r\n      pride of birth and dominion, of the sword and the mitre, wisely\r\n      adopted the commons as the third branch of the legislature, and,\r\n      in the progress of society, they were introduced about the same\r\n      aera into the national assemblies of France England, and Germany.\r\n\r\n      The Hanseatic League commanded the trade and navigation of the\r\n      north: the confederates of the Rhine secured the peace and\r\n      intercourse of the inland country; the influence of the cities\r\n      has been adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative\r\n      still invalidates the acts of the two superior colleges of\r\n      electors and princes. 149\r\n\r\n      149 (return) [ In the immense labyrinth of the jus publicum of\r\n      Germany, I must either quote one writer or a thousand; and I had\r\n      rather trust to one faithful guide, than transcribe, on credit, a\r\n      multitude of names and passages.

Their\r\n      unworthy successors were the counts of Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of\r\n      Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh: the emperor Henry the Seventh\r\n      procured for his son the crown of Bohemia, and his grandson\r\n      Charles the Fourth was born among a people strange and barbarous\r\n      in the estimation of the Germans themselves. 150 After the\r\n      excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received the gift or\r\n      promise of the vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, in the\r\n      exile and captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the\r\n      earth. The death of his competitors united the electoral college,\r\n      and Charles was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and\r\n      future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was prostituted\r\n      to the Caesars of Germany and Greece. The German emperor was no\r\n      more than the elective and impotent magistrate of an aristocracy\r\n      of princes, who had not left him a village that he might call his\r\n      own. His best prerogative was the right of presiding and\r\n      proposing in the national senate, which was convened at his\r\n      summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the\r\n      adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and\r\n      the richest source of his revenue. The army with which he passed\r\n      the Alps consisted of three hundred horse. In the cathedral of\r\n      St. Ambrose, Charles was crowned with the iron crown, which\r\n      tradition ascribed to the Lombard monarchy; but he was admitted\r\n      only with a peaceful train; the gates of the city were shut upon\r\n      him; and the king of Italy was held a captive by the arms of the\r\n      Visconti, whom he confirmed in the sovereignty of Milan. In the\r\n      Vatican he was again crowned with the golden crown of the empire;\r\n      but, in obedience to a secret treaty, the Roman emperor\r\n      immediately withdrew, without reposing a single night within the\r\n      walls of Rome. The eloquent Petrarch, 151 whose fancy revived the\r\n      visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids the\r\n      ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his contemporaries\r\n      could observe, that the sole exercise of his authority was in the\r\n      lucrative sale of privileges and titles. The gold of Italy\r\n      secured the election of his son; but such was the shameful\r\n      poverty of the Roman emperor, that his person was arrested by a\r\n      butcher in the streets of Worms, and was detained in the public\r\n      inn, as a pledge or hostage for the payment of his expenses.\r\n\r\n      150 (return) [ Yet, personally, Charles IV. must not be\r\n      considered as a Barbarian. After his education at Paris, he\r\n      recovered the use of the Bohemian, his native, idiom; and the\r\n      emperor conversed and wrote with equal facility in French, Latin,\r\n      Italian, and German, (Struvius, p. 615, 616.) Petrarch always\r\n      represents him as a polite and learned prince.]\r\n\r\n      151 (return) [ Besides the German and Italian historians, the\r\n      expedition of Charles IV. is painted in lively and original\r\n      colors in the curious Memoires sur la Vie de Petrarque, tom. iii.\r\n      p. 376-430, by the Abbe de Sade, whose prolixity has never been\r\n      blamed by any reader of taste and curiosity.]\r\n\r\n      From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent majesty\r\n      of the same Charles in the diets of the empire. The golden bull,\r\n      which fixes the Germanic constitution, is promulgated in the\r\n      style of a sovereign and legislator. A hundred princes bowed\r\n      before his throne, and exalted their own dignity by the voluntary\r\n      honors which they yielded to their chief or minister. At the\r\n      royal banquet, the hereditary great officers, the seven electors,\r\n      who in rank and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn\r\n      and domestic service of the palace. The seals of the triple\r\n      kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne,\r\n      and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, and\r\n      Arles. The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function\r\n      with a silver measure of oats, which he emptied on the ground,\r\n      and immediately dismounted to regulate the order of the guests.\r\n      The great steward, the count palatine of the Rhine, place the\r\n      dishes on the table. The great chamberlain, the margrave of\r\n      Brandenburgh, presented, after the repast, the golden ewer and\r\n      basin, to wash. The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was\r\n      represented by the emperor’s brother, the duke of Luxemburgh and\r\n      Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great huntsmen, who\r\n      introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of horns and\r\n      hounds. 152 Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to\r\n      Germany alone: the hereditary monarchs of Europe confessed the\r\n      preeminence of his rank and dignity: he was the first of the\r\n      Christian princes, the temporal head of the great republic of the\r\n      West: 153 to his person the title of majesty was long\r\n      appropriated; and he disputed with the pope the sublime\r\n      prerogative of creating kings and assembling councils. The oracle\r\n      of the civil law, the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner of\r\n      Charles the Fourth; and his school resounded with the doctrine,\r\n      that the Roman emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth,\r\n      from the rising to the setting sun. The contrary opinion was\r\n      condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the\r\n      gospel had pronounced, “And there went forth a decree from Caesar\r\n      Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.” 154\r\n\r\n      152 (return) [ See the whole ceremony in Struvius, p. 629]\r\n\r\n      153 (return) [ The republic of Europe, with the pope and emperor\r\n      at its head, was never represented with more dignity than in the\r\n      council of Constance.

At the head of his victorious\r\n      legions, in his reign over the sea and land, from the Nile and\r\n      Euphrates to the Atlantic Ocean, Augustus professed himself the\r\n      servant of the state and the equal of his fellow-citizens. The\r\n      conqueror of Rome and her provinces assumed a popular and legal\r\n      form of a censor, a consul, and a tribune. His will was the law\r\n      of mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the\r\n      voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their\r\n      master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to\r\n      administer the republic. In his dress, his domestics, 155 his\r\n      titles, in all the offices of social life, Augustus maintained\r\n      the character of a private Roman; and his most artful flatterers\r\n      respected the secret of his absolute and perpetual monarchy.\r\n\r\n      155 (return) [ Six thousand urns have been discovered of the\r\n      slaves and freedmen of Augustus and Livia.

While\r\n      the state was exhausted by the Persian war, and the church was\r\n      distracted by the Nestorian and Monophysite sects, Mahomet, with\r\n      the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other, erected his\r\n      throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome. The genius of\r\n      the Arabian prophet, the manners of his nation, and the spirit of\r\n      his religion, involve the causes of the decline and fall of the\r\n      Eastern empire; and our eyes are curiously intent on one of the\r\n      most memorable revolutions, which have impressed a new and\r\n      lasting character on the nations of the globe. 1\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ As in this and the following chapter I shall display\r\n      much Arabic learning, I must profess my total ignorance of the\r\n      Oriental tongues, and my gratitude to the learned interpreters,\r\n      who have transfused their science into the Latin, French, and\r\n      English languages. Their collections, versions, and histories, I\r\n      shall occasionally notice.]\r\n\r\n      In the vacant space between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Aethiopia,\r\n      the Arabian peninsula 2 may be conceived as a triangle of\r\n      spacious but irregular dimensions. From the northern point of\r\n      Beles 3 on the Euphrates, a line of fifteen hundred miles is\r\n      terminated by the Straits of Bebelmandel and the land of\r\n      frankincense. About half this length may be allowed for the\r\n      middle breadth, from east to west, from Bassora to Suez, from the\r\n      Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. 4 The sides of the triangle are\r\n      gradually enlarged, and the southern basis presents a front of a\r\n      thousand miles to the Indian Ocean. The entire surface of the\r\n      peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or\r\n      France; but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with\r\n      the epithets of the stony and the sandy. Even the wilds of\r\n      Tartary are decked, by the hand of nature, with lofty trees and\r\n      luxuriant herbage; and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of\r\n      comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life. But in\r\n      the dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless level of sand is\r\n      intersected by sharp and naked mountains; and the face of the\r\n      desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and\r\n      intense rays of a tropical sun. Instead of refreshing breezes,\r\n      the winds, particularly from the south-west, diffuse a noxious\r\n      and even deadly vapor; the hillocks of sand which they\r\n      alternately raise and scatter, are compared to the billows of the\r\n      ocean, and whole caravans, whole armies, have been lost and\r\n      buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits of water are an\r\n      object of desire and contest; and such is the scarcity of wood,\r\n      that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element\r\n      of fire. Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers, which fertilize\r\n      the soil, and convey its produce to the adjacent regions: the\r\n      torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty\r\n      earth: the rare and hardy plants, the tamarind or the acacia,\r\n      that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks, are\r\n      nourished by the dews of the night: a scanty supply of rain is\r\n      collected in cisterns and aqueducts: the wells and springs are\r\n      the secret treasure of the desert; and the pilgrim of Mecca, 5\r\n      after many a dry and sultry march, is disgusted by the taste of\r\n      the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt. Such\r\n      is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia. The\r\n      experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial\r\n      enjoyments. A shady grove, a green pasture, a stream of fresh\r\n      water, are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to\r\n      the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to\r\n      themselves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry\r\n      in the cultivation of the palmtree and the vine. The high lands\r\n      that border on the Indian Ocean are distinguished by their\r\n      superior plenty of wood and water; the air is more temperate, the\r\n      fruits are more delicious, the animals and the human race more\r\n      numerous: the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the toil\r\n      of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts of frankincense 6 and\r\n      coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the\r\n      world. If it be compared with the rest of the peninsula, this\r\n      sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the\r\n      happy; and the splendid coloring of fancy and fiction has been\r\n      suggested by contrast, and countenanced by distance. It was for\r\n      this earthly paradise that Nature had reserved her choicest\r\n      favors and her most curious workmanship: the incompatible\r\n      blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the natives:\r\n      the soil was impregnated with gold 7 and gems, and both the land\r\n      and sea were taught to exhale the odors of aromatic sweets. This\r\n      division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, so familiar to\r\n      the Greeks and Latins, is unknown to the Arabians themselves; and\r\n      it is singular enough, that a country, whose language and\r\n      inhabitants have ever been the same, should scarcely retain a\r\n      vestige of its ancient geography. The maritime districts of\r\n      Bahrein and Oman are opposite to the realm of Persia. The kingdom\r\n      of Yemen displays the limits, or at least the situation, of\r\n      Arabia Felix: the name of Neged is extended over the inland\r\n      space; and the birth of Mahomet has illustrated the province of\r\n      Hejaz along the coast of the Red Sea. 8\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ The geographers of Arabia may be divided into three\r\n      classes: 1.

Along the shores of the Persian Gulf, of the ocean, and\r\n      even of the Red Sea, the Icthyophagi, 9 or fish eaters, continued\r\n      to wander in quest of their precarious food. In this primitive\r\n      and abject state, which ill deserves the name of society, the\r\n      human brute, without arts or laws, almost without sense or\r\n      language, is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal\r\n      creation. Generations and ages might roll away in silent\r\n      oblivion, and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying\r\n      his race by the wants and pursuits which confined his existence\r\n      to the narrow margin of the seacoast. But in an early period of\r\n      antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this scene\r\n      of misery; and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a\r\n      people of hunters, they rose at once to the more secure and\r\n      plentiful condition of the pastoral life. The same life is\r\n      uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert; and in the\r\n      portrait of the modern Bedoweens, we may trace the features of\r\n      their ancestors, 10 who, in the age of Moses or Mahomet, dwelt\r\n      under similar tents, and conducted their horses, and camels, and\r\n      sheep, to the same springs and the same pastures. Our toil is\r\n      lessened, and our wealth is increased, by our dominion over the\r\n      useful animals; and the Arabian shepherd had acquired the\r\n      absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious slave.\r\n      11 Arabia, in the opinion of the naturalist, is the genuine and\r\n      original country of the horse; the climate most propitious, not\r\n      indeed to the size, but to the spirit and swiftness, of that\r\n      generous animal. The merit of the Barb, the Spanish, and the\r\n      English breed, is derived from a mixture of Arabian blood: 12 the\r\n      Bedoweens preserve, with superstitious care, the honors and the\r\n      memory of the purest race: the males are sold at a high price,\r\n      but the females are seldom alienated; and the birth of a noble\r\n      foal was esteemed among the tribes, as a subject of joy and\r\n      mutual congratulation. These horses are educated in the tents,\r\n      among the children of the Arabs, with a tender familiarity, which\r\n      trains them in the habits of gentleness and attachment. They are\r\n      accustomed only to walk and to gallop: their sensations are not\r\n      blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the whip: their\r\n      powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit: but no\r\n      sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup, than\r\n      they dart away with the swiftness of the wind; and if their\r\n      friend be dismounted in the rapid career, they instantly stop\r\n      till he has recovered his seat. In the sands of Africa and\r\n      Arabia, the camel is a sacred and precious gift. That strong and\r\n      patient beast of burden can perform, without eating or drinking,\r\n      a journey of several days; and a reservoir of fresh water is\r\n      preserved in a large bag, a fifth stomach of the animal, whose\r\n      body is imprinted with the marks of servitude: the larger breed\r\n      is capable of transporting a weight of a thousand pounds; and the\r\n      dromedary, of a lighter and more active frame, outstrips the\r\n      fleetest courser in the race. Alive or dead, almost every part of\r\n      the camel is serviceable to man: her milk is plentiful and\r\n      nutritious: the young and tender flesh has the taste of veal: 13\r\n      a valuable salt is extracted from the urine: the dung supplies\r\n      the deficiency of fuel; and the long hair, which falls each year\r\n      and is renewed, is coarsely manufactured into the garments, the\r\n      furniture, and the tents of the Bedoweens. In the rainy seasons,\r\n      they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of the desert:\r\n      during the heats of summer and the scarcity of winter, they\r\n      remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of Yemen, or\r\n      the neighborhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the\r\n      dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile, and the\r\n      villages of Syria and Palestine. The life of a wandering Arab is\r\n      a life of danger and distress; and though sometimes, by rapine or\r\n      exchange, he may appropriate the fruits of industry, a private\r\n      citizen in Europe is in the possession of more solid and pleasing\r\n      luxury than the proudest emir, who marches in the field at the\r\n      head of ten thousand horse.\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ Arrian remarks the Icthyophagi of the coast of\r\n      Hejez, (Periplus Maris Erythraei, p. 12,) and beyond Aden, (p.\r\n      15.)

Mahomet himself, who was fond of milk, prefers the cow,\r\n      and does not even mention the camel; but the diet of Mecca and\r\n      Medina was already more luxurious, (Gagnier Vie de Mahomet, tom.\r\n      iii. p. 404.)]\r\n\r\n      Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of\r\n      Scythia and the Arabian tribes; since many of the latter were\r\n      collected into towns, and employed in the labors of trade and\r\n      agriculture. A part of their time and industry was still devoted\r\n      to the management of their cattle: they mingled, in peace and\r\n      war, with their brethren of the desert; and the Bedoweens derived\r\n      from their useful intercourse some supply of their wants, and\r\n      some rudiments of art and knowledge. Among the forty-two cities\r\n      of Arabia, 14 enumerated by Abulfeda, the most ancient and\r\n      populous were situate in the happy Yemen: the towers of Saana, 15\r\n      and the marvellous reservoir of Merab, 16 were constructed by the\r\n      kings of the Homerites; but their profane lustre was eclipsed by\r\n      the prophetic glories of Medina 17 and Mecca, 18 near the Red\r\n      Sea, and at the distance from each other of two hundred and\r\n      seventy miles. The last of these holy places was known to the\r\n      Greeks under the name of Macoraba; and the termination of the\r\n      word is expressive of its greatness, which has not, indeed, in\r\n      the most flourishing period, exceeded the size and populousness\r\n      of Marseilles. Some latent motive, perhaps of superstition, must\r\n      have impelled the founders, in the choice of a most unpromising\r\n      situation. They erected their habitations of mud or stone, in a\r\n      plain about two miles long and one mile broad, at the foot of\r\n      three barren mountains: the soil is a rock; the water even of the\r\n      holy well of Zemzem is bitter or brackish; the pastures are\r\n      remote from the city; and grapes are transported above seventy\r\n      miles from the gardens of Tayef. The fame and spirit of the\r\n      Koreishites, who reigned in Mecca, were conspicuous among the\r\n      Arabian tribes; but their ungrateful soil refused the labors of\r\n      agriculture, and their position was favorable to the enterprises\r\n      of trade. By the seaport of Gedda, at the distance only of forty\r\n      miles, they maintained an easy correspondence with Abyssinia; and\r\n      that Christian kingdom afforded the first refuge to the disciples\r\n      of Mahomet. The treasures of Africa were conveyed over the\r\n      Peninsula to Gerrha or Katif, in the province of Bahrein, a city\r\n      built, as it is said, of rock-salt, by the Chaldaean exiles; 19\r\n      and from thence with the native pearls of the Persian Gulf, they\r\n      were floated on rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates. Mecca is\r\n      placed almost at an equal distance, a month’s journey, between\r\n      Yemen on the right, and Syria on the left hand. The former was\r\n      the winter, the latter the summer, station of her caravans; and\r\n      their seasonable arrival relieved the ships of India from the\r\n      tedious and troublesome navigation of the Red Sea. In the markets\r\n      of Saana and Merab, in the harbors of Oman and Aden, the camels\r\n      of the Koreishites were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics;\r\n      a supply of corn and manufactures was purchased in the fairs of\r\n      Bostra and Damascus; the lucrative exchange diffused plenty and\r\n      riches in the streets of Mecca; and the noblest of her sons\r\n      united the love of arms with the profession of merchandise. 20\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [ Yet Marcian of Heraclea (in Periplo, p. 16, in tom.\r\n      i.

Yet these exceptions are temporary or\r\n      local; the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most\r\n      powerful monarchies: the arms of Sesostris and Cyrus, of Pompey\r\n      and Trajan, could never achieve the conquest of Arabia; the\r\n      present sovereign of the Turks 25 may exercise a shadow of\r\n      jurisdiction, but his pride is reduced to solicit the friendship\r\n      of a people, whom it is dangerous to provoke, and fruitless to\r\n      attack. The obvious causes of their freedom are inscribed on the\r\n      character and country of the Arabs. Many ages before Mahomet, 26\r\n      their intrepid valor had been severely felt by their neighbors in\r\n      offensive and defensive war. The patient and active virtues of a\r\n      soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits and discipline of a\r\n      pastoral life. The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to\r\n      the women of the tribe; but the martial youth, under the banner\r\n      of the emir, is ever on horseback, and in the field, to practise\r\n      the exercise of the bow, the javelin, and the cimeter. The long\r\n      memory of their independence is the firmest pledge of its\r\n      perpetuity and succeeding generations are animated to prove their\r\n      descent, and to maintain their inheritance. Their domestic feuds\r\n      are suspended on the approach of a common enemy; and in their\r\n      last hostilities against the Turks, the caravan of Mecca was\r\n      attacked and pillaged by fourscore thousand of the confederates.\r\n      When they advance to battle, the hope of victory is in the front;\r\n      in the rear, the assurance of a retreat. Their horses and camels,\r\n      who, in eight or ten days, can perform a march of four or five\r\n      hundred miles, disappear before the conqueror; the secret waters\r\n      of the desert elude his search, and his victorious troops are\r\n      consumed with thirst, hunger, and fatigue, in the pursuit of an\r\n      invisible foe, who scorns his efforts, and safely reposes in the\r\n      heart of the burning solitude. The arms and deserts of the\r\n      Bedoweens are not only the safeguards of their own freedom, but\r\n      the barriers also of the happy Arabia, whose inhabitants, remote\r\n      from war, are enervated by the luxury of the soil and climate.\r\n      The legions of Augustus melted away in disease and lassitude; 27\r\n      and it is only by a naval power that the reduction of Yemen has\r\n      been successfully attempted. When Mahomet erected his holy\r\n      standard, 28 that kingdom was a province of the Persian empire;\r\n      yet seven princes of the Homerites still reigned in the\r\n      mountains; and the vicegerent of Chosroes was tempted to forget\r\n      his distant country and his unfortunate master. The historians of\r\n      the age of Justinian represent the state of the independent\r\n      Arabs, who were divided by interest or affection in the long\r\n      quarrel of the East: the tribe of Gassan was allowed to encamp on\r\n      the Syrian territory: the princes of Hira were permitted to form\r\n      a city about forty miles to the southward of the ruins of\r\n      Babylon. Their service in the field was speedy and vigorous; but\r\n      their friendship was venal, their faith inconstant, their enmity\r\n      capricious: it was an easier task to excite than to disarm these\r\n      roving barbarians; and, in the familiar intercourse of war, they\r\n      learned to see, and to despise, the splendid weakness both of\r\n      Rome and of Persia. From Mecca to the Euphrates, the Arabian\r\n      tribes 29 were confounded by the Greeks and Latins, under the\r\n      general appellation of Saracens, 30 a name which every Christian\r\n      mouth has been taught to pronounce with terror and abhorrence.\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ A nameless doctor (Universal Hist. vol. xx. octavo\r\n      edition) has formally demonstrated the truth of Christianity by\r\n      the independence of the Arabs.

In every tribe, superstition, or\r\n      gratitude, or fortune, has exalted a particular family above the\r\n      heads of their equals. The dignities of sheick and emir\r\n      invariably descend in this chosen race; but the order of\r\n      succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or aged\r\n      of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple, though\r\n      important, office of composing disputes by their advice, and\r\n      guiding valor by their example. Even a female of sense and spirit\r\n      has been permitted to command the countrymen of Zenobia. 31 The\r\n      momentary junction of several tribes produces an army: their more\r\n      lasting union constitutes a nation; and the supreme chief, the\r\n      emir of emirs, whose banner is displayed at their head, may\r\n      deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the honors of the kingly name.\r\n\r\n      If the Arabian princes abuse their power, they are quickly\r\n      punished by the desertion of their subjects, who had been\r\n      accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction. Their spirit is\r\n      free, their steps are unconfined, the desert is open, and the\r\n      tribes and families are held together by a mutual and voluntary\r\n      compact. The softer natives of Yemen supported the pomp and\r\n      majesty of a monarch; but if he could not leave his palace\r\n      without endangering his life, 32 the active powers of government\r\n      must have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates. The cities\r\n      of Mecca and Medina present, in the heart of Asia, the form, or\r\n      rather the substance, of a commonwealth. The grandfather of\r\n      Mahomet, and his lineal ancestors, appear in foreign and domestic\r\n      transactions as the princes of their country; but they reigned,\r\n      like Pericles at Athens, or the Medici at Florence, by the\r\n      opinion of their wisdom and integrity; their influence was\r\n      divided with their patrimony; and the sceptre was transferred\r\n      from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the tribe\r\n      of Koreish. On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of the\r\n      people; and, since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded\r\n      to obey, the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient\r\n      Arabs is the clearest evidence of public freedom. 33 But their\r\n      simple freedom was of a very different cast from the nice and\r\n      artificial machinery of the Greek and Roman republics, in which\r\n      each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and\r\n      political rights of the community. In the more simple state of\r\n      the Arabs, the nation is free, because each of her sons disdains\r\n      a base submission to the will of a master. His breast is\r\n      fortified by the austere virtues of courage, patience, and\r\n      sobriety; the love of independence prompts him to exercise the\r\n      habits of self-command; and the fear of dishonor guards him from\r\n      the meaner apprehension of pain, of danger, and of death. The\r\n      gravity and firmness of the mind is conspicuous in his outward\r\n      demeanor; his speech is low, weighty, and concise; he is seldom\r\n      provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of stroking his\r\n      beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of his own\r\n      importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and\r\n      his superiors without awe. 34 The liberty of the Saracens\r\n      survived their conquests: the first caliphs indulged the bold and\r\n      familiar language of their subjects; they ascended the pulpit to\r\n      persuade and edify the congregation; nor was it before the seat\r\n      of empire was removed to the Tigris, that the Abbasides adopted\r\n      the proud and pompous ceremonial of the Persian and Byzantine\r\n      courts.\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ Saraceni... mulieres aiunt in eos regnare,\r\n      (Expositio totius Mundi, p. 3, in Hudson, tom. iii.)

The separation of the Arabs from the rest of mankind\r\n      has accustomed them to confound the ideas of stranger and enemy;\r\n      and the poverty of the land has introduced a maxim of\r\n      jurisprudence, which they believe and practise to the present\r\n      hour. They pretend, that, in the division of the earth, the rich\r\n      and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the\r\n      human family; and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might\r\n      recover, by fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which\r\n      he had been unjustly deprived. According to the remark of Pliny,\r\n      the Arabian tribes are equally addicted to theft and merchandise;\r\n      the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged;\r\n      and their neighbors, since the remote times of Job and Sesostris,\r\n      35 have been the victims of their rapacious spirit. If a Bedoween\r\n      discovers from afar a solitary traveller, he rides furiously\r\n      against him, crying, with a loud voice, “Undress thyself, thy\r\n      aunt (my wife) is without a garment.” A ready submission entitles\r\n      him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor, and his own\r\n      blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in\r\n      legitimate defence. A single robber, or a few associates, are\r\n      branded with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous\r\n      band assume the character of lawful and honorable war. The temper\r\n      of a people thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the\r\n      domestic license of rapine, murder, and revenge. In the\r\n      constitution of Europe, the right of peace and war is now\r\n      confined to a small, and the actual exercise to a much smaller,\r\n      list of respectable potentates; but each Arab, with impunity and\r\n      renown, might point his javelin against the life of his\r\n      countrymen. The union of the nation consisted only in a vague\r\n      resemblance of language and manners; and in each community, the\r\n      jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent. Of the time\r\n      of ignorance which preceded Mahomet, seventeen hundred battles 36\r\n      are recorded by tradition: hostility was imbittered with the\r\n      rancor of civil faction; and the recital, in prose or verse, of\r\n      an obsolete feud, was sufficient to rekindle the same passions\r\n      among the descendants of the hostile tribes. In private life\r\n      every man, at least every family, was the judge and avenger of\r\n      his own cause. The nice sensibility of honor, which weighs the\r\n      insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom on the\r\n      quarrels of the Arabs: the honor of their women, and of their\r\n      beards, is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a\r\n      contemptuous word, can be expiated only by the blood of the\r\n      offender; and such is their patient inveteracy, that they expect\r\n      whole months and years the opportunity of revenge. A fine or\r\n      compensation for murder is familiar to the Barbarians of every\r\n      age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to\r\n      accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own hands the law\r\n      of retaliation. The refined malice of the Arabs refuses even the\r\n      head of the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty\r\n      person, and transfers the penalty to the best and most\r\n      considerable of the race by whom they have been injured. If he\r\n      falls by their hands, they are exposed, in their turn, to the\r\n      danger of reprisals, the interest and principal of the bloody\r\n      debt are accumulated: the individuals of either family lead a\r\n      life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may sometimes\r\n      elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled. 37\r\n      This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been\r\n      moderated, however, by the maxims of honor, which require in\r\n      every private encounter some decent equality of age and strength,\r\n      of numbers and weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of\r\n      four, months, was observed by the Arabs before the time of\r\n      Mahomet, during which their swords were religiously sheathed both\r\n      in foreign and domestic hostility; and this partial truce is more\r\n      strongly expressive of the habits of anarchy and warfare. 38\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ Observe the first chapter of Job, and the long wall\r\n      of 1500 stadia which Sesostris built from Pelusium to Heliopolis,\r\n      (Diodor.

The solitary peninsula is\r\n      encompassed by the most civilized nations of the ancient world;\r\n      the merchant is the friend of mankind; and the annual caravans\r\n      imported the first seeds of knowledge and politeness into the\r\n      cities, and even the camps of the desert. Whatever may be the\r\n      pedigree of the Arabs, their language is derived from the same\r\n      original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, and the Chaldaean\r\n      tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked by their\r\n      peculiar dialects; 39 but each, after their own, allowed a just\r\n      preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca. In Arabia,\r\n      as well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the\r\n      refinement of manners; and her speech could diversify the\r\n      fourscore names of honey, the two hundred of a serpent, the five\r\n      hundred of a lion, the thousand of a sword, at a time when this\r\n      copious dictionary was intrusted to the memory of an illiterate\r\n      people. The monuments of the Homerites were inscribed with an\r\n      obsolete and mysterious character; but the Cufic letters, the\r\n      groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the banks of\r\n      the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at Mecca by a\r\n      stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet. The\r\n      arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric, were unknown to the\r\n      freeborn eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was\r\n      sharp, their fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious,\r\n      40 and their more elaborate compositions were addressed with\r\n      energy and effect to the minds of their hearers. The genius and\r\n      merit of a rising poet was celebrated by the applause of his own\r\n      and the kindred tribes. A solemn banquet was prepared, and a\r\n      chorus of women, striking their tymbals, and displaying the pomp\r\n      of their nuptials, sung in the presence of their sons and\r\n      husbands the felicity of their native tribe; that a champion had\r\n      now appeared to vindicate their rights; that a herald had raised\r\n      his voice to immortalize their renown. The distant or hostile\r\n      tribes resorted to an annual fair, which was abolished by the\r\n      fanaticism of the first Moslems; a national assembly that must\r\n      have contributed to refine and harmonize the Barbarians. Thirty\r\n      days were employed in the exchange, not only of corn and wine,\r\n      but of eloquence and poetry. The prize was disputed by the\r\n      generous emulation of the bards; the victorious performance was\r\n      deposited in the archives of princes and emirs; and we may read\r\n      in our own language, the seven original poems which were\r\n      inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the temple of\r\n      Mecca. 41 The Arabian poets were the historians and moralists of\r\n      the age; and if they sympathized with the prejudices, they\r\n      inspired and crowned the virtues, of their countrymen. The\r\n      indissoluble union of generosity and valor was the darling theme\r\n      of their song; and when they pointed their keenest satire against\r\n      a despicable race, they affirmed, in the bitterness of reproach,\r\n      that the men knew not how to give, nor the women to deny. 42 The\r\n      same hospitality, which was practised by Abraham, and celebrated\r\n      by Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs. The\r\n      ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace, without\r\n      inquiry or hesitation, the stranger who dares to confide in their\r\n      honor and to enter their tent. His treatment is kind and\r\n      respectful: he shares the wealth, or the poverty, of his host;\r\n      and, after a needful repose, he is dismissed on his way, with\r\n      thanks, with blessings, and perhaps with gifts. The heart and\r\n      hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a brother or a\r\n      friend; but the heroic acts that could deserve the public\r\n      applause, must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion\r\n      and experience. A dispute had arisen, who, among the citizens of\r\n      Mecca, was entitled to the prize of generosity; and a successive\r\n      application was made to the three who were deemed most worthy of\r\n      the trial. Abdallah, the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant\r\n      journey, and his foot was in the stirrup when he heard the voice\r\n      of a suppliant, “O son of the uncle of the apostle of God, I am a\r\n      traveller, and in distress!” He instantly dismounted to present\r\n      the pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison, and a purse of\r\n      four thousand pieces of gold, excepting only the sword, either\r\n      for its intrinsic value, or as the gift of an honored kinsman.\r\n      The servant of Kais informed the second suppliant that his master\r\n      was asleep: but he immediately added, “Here is a purse of seven\r\n      thousand pieces of gold, (it is all we have in the house,) and\r\n      here is an order, that will entitle you to a camel and a slave;”\r\n      the master, as soon as he awoke, praised and enfranchised his\r\n      faithful steward, with a gentle reproof, that by respecting his\r\n      slumbers he had stinted his bounty. The third of these heroes,\r\n      the blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was supporting his steps\r\n      on the shoulders of two slaves. “Alas!” he replied, “my coffers\r\n      are empty! but these you may sell; if you refuse, I renounce\r\n      them.” At these words, pushing away the youths, he groped along\r\n      the wall with his staff.\r\n\r\n      The character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue: 43\r\n      he was brave and liberal, an eloquent poet, and a successful\r\n      robber; forty camels were roasted at his hospitable feast; and at\r\n      the prayer of a suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and\r\n      the spoil. The freedom of his countrymen disdained the laws of\r\n      justice; they proudly indulged the spontaneous impulse of pity\r\n      and benevolence.\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ Arrian, in the second century, remarks (in Periplo\r\n      Maris Erythraei, p. 12) the partial or total difference of the\r\n      dialects of the Arabs.

The bright\r\n      luminaries of the sky display the visible image of a Deity: their\r\n      number and distance convey to a philosophic, or even a vulgar,\r\n      eye, the idea of boundless space: the character of eternity is\r\n      marked on these solid globes, that seem incapable of corruption\r\n      or decay: the regularity of their motions may be ascribed to a\r\n      principle of reason or instinct; and their real, or imaginary,\r\n      influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and its\r\n      inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care. The science of\r\n      astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs\r\n      was a clear firmament and a naked plain. In their nocturnal\r\n      marches, they steered by the guidance of the stars: their names,\r\n      and order, and daily station, were familiar to the curiosity and\r\n      devotion of the Bedoween; and he was taught by experience to\r\n      divide, in twenty-eight parts, the zodiac of the moon, and to\r\n      bless the constellations who refreshed, with salutary rains, the\r\n      thirst of the desert. The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be\r\n      extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical powers\r\n      were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the\r\n      resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave,\r\n      that he might serve his master in another life; and the\r\n      invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still\r\n      endowed with consciousness and power. I am ignorant, and I am\r\n      careless, of the blind mythology of the Barbarians; of the local\r\n      deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth, of their sex or\r\n      titles, their attributes or subordination. Each tribe, each\r\n      family, each independent warrior, created and changed the rites\r\n      and the object of his fantastic worship; but the nation, in every\r\n      age, has bowed to the religion, as well as to the language, of\r\n      Mecca. The genuine antiquity of the Caaba ascends beyond the\r\n      Christian aera; in describing the coast of the Red Sea, the Greek\r\n      historian Diodorus 45 has remarked, between the Thamudites and\r\n      the Sabaeans, a famous temple, whose superior sanctity was\r\n      revered by all the Arabians; the linen or silken veil, which is\r\n      annually renewed by the Turkish emperor, was first offered by a\r\n      pious king of the Homerites, who reigned seven hundred years\r\n      before the time of Mahomet. 46 A tent, or a cavern, might suffice\r\n      for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and clay\r\n      has been erected in its place; and the art and power of the\r\n      monarchs of the East have been confined to the simplicity of the\r\n      original model. 47 A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of\r\n      the Caaba; a square chapel, twenty-four cubits long, twenty-three\r\n      broad, and twenty-seven high: a door and a window admit the\r\n      light; the double roof is supported by three pillars of wood; a\r\n      spout (now of gold) discharges the rain-water, and the well\r\n      Zemzen is protected by a dome from accidental pollution. The\r\n      tribe of Koreish, by fraud and force, had acquired the custody of\r\n      the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through four lineal\r\n      descents to the grandfather of Mahomet; and the family of the\r\n      Hashemites, from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and\r\n      sacred in the eyes of their country. 48 The precincts of Mecca\r\n      enjoyed the rights of sanctuary; and, in the last month of each\r\n      year, the city and the temple were crowded with a long train of\r\n      pilgrims, who presented their vows and offerings in the house of\r\n      God. The same rites which are now accomplished by the faithful\r\n      Mussulman, were invented and practised by the superstition of the\r\n      idolaters. At an awful distance they cast away their garments:\r\n      seven times, with hasty steps, they encircled the Caaba, and\r\n      kissed the black stone: seven times they visited and adored the\r\n      adjacent mountains; seven times they threw stones into the valley\r\n      of Mina; and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour,\r\n      by a sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair\r\n      and nails in the consecrated ground. Each tribe either found or\r\n      introduced in the Caaba their domestic worship: the temple was\r\n      adorned, or defiled, with three hundred and sixty idols of men,\r\n      eagles, lions, and antelopes; and most conspicuous was the statue\r\n      of Hebal, of red agate, holding in his hand seven arrows, without\r\n      heads or feathers, the instruments and symbols of profane\r\n      divination. But this statue was a monument of Syrian arts: the\r\n      devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a tablet;\r\n      and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars, in\r\n      imitation of the black stone 49 of Mecca, which is deeply tainted\r\n      with the reproach of an idolatrous origin. From Japan to Peru,\r\n      the use of sacrifice has universally prevailed; and the votary\r\n      has expressed his gratitude, or fear, by destroying or consuming,\r\n      in honor of the gods, the dearest and most precious of their\r\n      gifts. The life of a man 50 is the most precious oblation to\r\n      deprecate a public calamity: the altars of Phoenicia and Egypt,\r\n      of Rome and Carthage, have been polluted with human gore: the\r\n      cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; in the third\r\n      century, a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the\r\n      Dumatians; 51 and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the\r\n      prince of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor\r\n      Justinian. 52 A parent who drags his son to the altar, exhibits\r\n      the most painful and sublime effort of fanaticism: the deed, or\r\n      the intention, was sanctified by the example of saints and\r\n      heroes; and the father of Mahomet himself was devoted by a rash\r\n      vow, and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of a hundred camels.\r\n      In the time of ignorance, the Arabs, like the Jews and Egyptians,\r\n      abstained from the taste of swine’s flesh; 53 they circumcised 54\r\n      their children at the age of puberty: the same customs, without\r\n      the censure or the precept of the Koran, have been silently\r\n      transmitted to their posterity and proselytes. It has been\r\n      sagaciously conjectured, that the artful legislator indulged the\r\n      stubborn prejudices of his countrymen. It is more simple to\r\n      believe that he adhered to the habits and opinions of his youth,\r\n      without foreseeing that a practice congenial to the climate of\r\n      Mecca might become useless or inconvenient on the banks of the\r\n      Danube or the Volga.\r\n\r\n      44 (return) [ Whatever can now be known of the idolatry of the\r\n      ancient Arabians may be found in Pocock, (Specimen, p. 89-136,\r\n      163, 164.)

The religions of the Sabians and\r\n      Magians, of the Jews and Christians, were disseminated from the\r\n      Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. In a remote period of antiquity,\r\n      Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the science of the Chaldaeans\r\n      55 and the arms of the Assyrians. From the observations of two\r\n      thousand years, the priests and astronomers of Babylon 56 deduced\r\n      the eternal laws of nature and providence. They adored the seven\r\n      gods or angels, who directed the course of the seven planets, and\r\n      shed their irresistible influence on the earth. The attributes of\r\n      the seven planets, with the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the\r\n      twenty-four constellations of the northern and southern\r\n      hemisphere, were represented by images and talismans; the seven\r\n      days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities; the\r\n      Sabians prayed thrice each day; and the temple of the moon at\r\n      Haran was the term of their pilgrimage. 57 But the flexible\r\n      genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to\r\n      learn: in the tradition of the creation, the deluge, and the\r\n      patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their Jewish\r\n      captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and\r\n      Enoch; and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the\r\n      last remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John,\r\n      in the territory of Bassora. 58 The altars of Babylon were\r\n      overturned by the Magians; but the injuries of the Sabians were\r\n      revenged by the sword of Alexander; Persia groaned above five\r\n      hundred years under a foreign yoke; and the purest disciples of\r\n      Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of idolatry, and breathed\r\n      with their adversaries the freedom of the desert. 59 Seven\r\n      hundred years before the death of Mahomet, the Jews were settled\r\n      in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy\r\n      Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian. The industrious exiles\r\n      aspired to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the\r\n      cities, and castles in the wilderness, and their Gentile converts\r\n      were confounded with the children of Israel, whom they resembled\r\n      in the outward mark of circumcision. The Christian missionaries\r\n      were still more active and successful: the Catholics asserted\r\n      their universal reign; the sects whom they oppressed,\r\n      successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman empire; the\r\n      Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic opinions\r\n      and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the princes of\r\n      Hira and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite\r\n      and Nestorian bishops. 60 The liberty of choice was presented to\r\n      the tribes: each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private\r\n      religion: and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with\r\n      the sublime theology of saints and philosophers. A fundamental\r\n      article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned\r\n      strangers; the existence of one supreme God who is exalted above\r\n      the powers of heaven and earth, but who has often revealed\r\n      himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets,\r\n      and whose grace or justice has interrupted, by seasonable\r\n      miracles, the order of nature. The most rational of the Arabs\r\n      acknowledged his power, though they neglected his worship; 61 and\r\n      it was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to\r\n      the relics of idolatry. The Jews and Christians were the people\r\n      of the Book; the Bible was already translated into the Arabic\r\n      language, 62 and the volume of the Old Testament was accepted by\r\n      the concord of these implacable enemies. In the story of the\r\n      Hebrew patriarchs, the Arabs were pleased to discover the fathers\r\n      of their nation. They applauded the birth and promises of Ismael;\r\n      revered the faith and virtue of Abraham; traced his pedigree and\r\n      their own to the creation of the first man, and imbibed, with\r\n      equal credulity, the prodigies of the holy text, and the dreams\r\n      and traditions of the Jewish rabbis.\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. ii. p. 142-145) has\r\n      cast on their religion the curious but superficial glance of a\r\n      Greek.

His descent from Ismael was a national privilege\r\n      or fable; but if the first steps of the pedigree 64 are dark and\r\n      doubtful, he could produce many generations of pure and genuine\r\n      nobility: he sprung from the tribe of Koreish and the family of\r\n      Hashem, the most illustrious of the Arabs, the princes of Mecca,\r\n      and the hereditary guardians of the Caaba. The grandfather of\r\n      Mahomet was Abdol Motalleb, the son of Hashem, a wealthy and\r\n      generous citizen, who relieved the distress of famine with the\r\n      supplies of commerce. Mecca, which had been fed by the liberality\r\n      of the father, was saved by the courage of the son. The kingdom\r\n      of Yemen was subject to the Christian princes of Abyssinia; their\r\n      vassal Abrahah was provoked by an insult to avenge the honor of\r\n      the cross; and the holy city was invested by a train of elephants\r\n      and an army of Africans. A treaty was proposed; and, in the first\r\n      audience, the grandfather of Mahomet demanded the restitution of\r\n      his cattle. “And why,” said Abrahah, “do you not rather implore\r\n      my clemency in favor of your temple, which I have threatened to\r\n      destroy?” “Because,” replied the intrepid chief, “the cattle is\r\n      my own; the Caaba belongs to the gods, and they will defend their\r\n      house from injury and sacrilege.” The want of provisions, or the\r\n      valor of the Koreish, compelled the Abyssinians to a disgraceful\r\n      retreat: their discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous\r\n      flight of birds, who showered down stones on the heads of the\r\n      infidels; and the deliverance was long commemorated by the aera\r\n      of the elephant. 65 The glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with\r\n      domestic happiness; his life was prolonged to the age of one\r\n      hundred and ten years; and he became the father of six daughters\r\n      and thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah was the most\r\n      beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and in the first\r\n      night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina, 651 of the\r\n      noble race of the Zahrites, two hundred virgins are said to have\r\n      expired of jealousy and despair. Mahomet, or more properly\r\n      Mohammed, the only son of Abdallah and Amina, was born at Mecca,\r\n      four years after the death of Justinian, and two months after the\r\n      defeat of the Abyssinians, 66 whose victory would have introduced\r\n      into the Caaba the religion of the Christians. In his early\r\n      infancy, he was deprived of his father, his mother, and his\r\n      grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and, in the\r\n      division of the inheritance, the orphan’s share was reduced to\r\n      five camels and an Aethiopian maid-servant. At home and abroad,\r\n      in peace and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles,\r\n      was the guide and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth\r\n      year, he entered into the service of Cadijah, a rich and noble\r\n      widow of Mecca, who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of\r\n      her hand and fortune. The marriage contract, in the simple style\r\n      of antiquity, recites the mutual love of Mahomet and Cadijah;\r\n      describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe of Koreish;\r\n      and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold and twenty\r\n      camels, which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle. 67 By\r\n      this alliance, the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of\r\n      his ancestors; and the judicious matron was content with his\r\n      domestic virtues, till, in the fortieth year of his age, 68 he\r\n      assumed the title of a prophet, and proclaimed the religion of\r\n      the Koran.\r\n\r\n      63 (return) [ In eo conveniunt omnes, ut plebeio vilique genere\r\n      ortum, &c, (Hottinger, Hist.

Orient. p. 204-211) Maracci, (tom. i. p.\r\n      10-14,) and Gagnier, (Vie de Mahomet, tom. i. p. 97-134.)]\r\n\r\n      According to the tradition of his companions, Mahomet 69 was\r\n      distinguished by the beauty of his person, an outward gift which\r\n      is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused.\r\n      Before he spoke, the orator engaged on his side the affections of\r\n      a public or private audience. They applauded his commanding\r\n      presence, his majestic aspect, his piercing eye, his gracious\r\n      smile, his flowing beard, his countenance that painted every\r\n      sensation of the soul, and his gestures that enforced each\r\n      expression of the tongue. In the familiar offices of life he\r\n      scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of\r\n      his country: his respectful attention to the rich and powerful\r\n      was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest\r\n      citizens of Mecca: the frankness of his manner concealed the\r\n      artifice of his views; and the habits of courtesy were imputed to\r\n      personal friendship or universal benevolence. His memory was\r\n      capacious and retentive; his wit easy and social; his imagination\r\n      sublime; his judgment clear, rapid, and decisive. He possessed\r\n      the courage both of thought and action; and, although his designs\r\n      might gradually expand with his success, the first idea which he\r\n      entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original\r\n      and superior genius. The son of Abdallah was educated in the\r\n      bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest dialect of\r\n      Arabia; and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced\r\n      by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence. With these\r\n      powers of eloquence, Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian: his\r\n      youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and\r\n      writing; 70 the common ignorance exempted him from shame or\r\n      reproach, but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence, and\r\n      deprived of those faithful mirrors, which reflect to our mind the\r\n      minds of sages and heroes. Yet the book of nature and of man was\r\n      open to his view; and some fancy has been indulged in the\r\n      political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to\r\n      the Arabian traveller. 71 He compares the nations and the regions\r\n      of the earth; discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman\r\n      monarchies; beholds, with pity and indignation, the degeneracy of\r\n      the times; and resolves to unite under one God and one king the\r\n      invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs. Our more\r\n      accurate inquiry will suggest, that, instead of visiting the\r\n      courts, the camps, the temples, of the East, the two journeys of\r\n      Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and\r\n      Damascus; that he was only thirteen years of age when he\r\n      accompanied the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty compelled\r\n      him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of\r\n      Cadijah. In these hasty and superficial excursions, the eye of\r\n      genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser\r\n      companions; some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful\r\n      soil; but his ignorance of the Syriac language must have checked\r\n      his curiosity; and I cannot perceive, in the life or writings of\r\n      Mahomet, that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of\r\n      the Arabian world. From every region of that solitary world, the\r\n      pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled, by the calls of\r\n      devotion and commerce: in the free concourse of multitudes, a\r\n      simple citizen, in his native tongue, might study the political\r\n      state and character of the tribes, the theory and practice of the\r\n      Jews and Christians. Some useful strangers might be tempted, or\r\n      forced, to implore the rights of hospitality; and the enemies of\r\n      Mahomet have named the Jew, the Persian, and the Syrian monk,\r\n      whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition\r\n      of the Koran. 72 Conversation enriches the understanding, but\r\n      solitude is the school of genius; and the uniformity of a work\r\n      denotes the hand of a single artist. From his earliest youth\r\n      Mahomet was addicted to religious contemplation; each year,\r\n      during the month of Ramadan, he withdrew from the world, and from\r\n      the arms of Cadijah: in the cave of Hera, three miles from Mecca,\r\n      73 he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is\r\n      not in the heavens, but in the mind of the prophet. The faith\r\n      which, under the name of Islam, he preached to his family and\r\n      nation, is compounded of an eternal truth, and a necessary\r\n      fiction, That there is only one God, and that Mahomet is the\r\n      apostle of God.\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ Abulfeda, in Vit. c. lxv. lxvi.

Two short\r\n      trading journeys to the fairs of Syria were surely not sufficient\r\n      to infuse a science so rare among the citizens of Mecca: it was\r\n      not in the cool, deliberate act of treaty, that Mahomet would\r\n      have dropped the mask; nor can any conclusion be drawn from the\r\n      words of disease and delirium. The lettered youth, before he\r\n      aspired to the prophetic character, must have often exercised, in\r\n      private life, the arts of reading and writing; and his first\r\n      converts, of his own family, would have been the first to detect\r\n      and upbraid his scandalous hypocrisy, (White’s Sermons, p. 203,\r\n      204, Notes, p. xxxvi.—xxxviii.) * Note: (Academ. des Inscript. I.\r\n      p. 295) has observed that the text of the seveth Sura implies\r\n      that Mahomet could read, the tradition alone denies it, and,\r\n      according to Dr. Weil, (p. 46,) there is another reading of the\r\n      tradition, that “he could not read well.” Dr. Weil is not quite\r\n      so successful in explaining away Sura xxix.

Yet Mahomet had never read of the cave of\r\n      Egeria, ubi nocturnae Numa constituebat amicae, of the Idaean\r\n      Mount, where Minos conversed with Jove, &c.]\r\n\r\n      It is the boast of the Jewish apologists, that while the learned\r\n      nations of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheism,\r\n      their simple ancestors of Palestine preserved the knowledge and\r\n      worship of the true God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not\r\n      easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtue: his\r\n      metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed; but each page of the\r\n      Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power: the\r\n      unity of his name is inscribed on the first table of the law; and\r\n      his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible image of the\r\n      invisible essence. After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the\r\n      Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the\r\n      spiritual devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of Mahomet\r\n      will not justify his perpetual reproach, that the Jews of Mecca\r\n      or Medina adored Ezra as the son of God. 74 But the children of\r\n      Israel had ceased to be a people; and the religions of the world\r\n      were guilty, at least in the eyes of the prophet, of giving sons,\r\n      or daughters, or companions, to the supreme God. In the rude\r\n      idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manifest and audacious: the\r\n      Sabians are poorly excused by the preeminence of the first\r\n      planet, or intelligence, in their celestial hierarchy; and in the\r\n      Magian system the conflict of the two principles betrays the\r\n      imperfection of the conqueror. The Christians of the seventh\r\n      century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance of Paganism:\r\n      their public and private vows were addressed to the relics and\r\n      images that disgraced the temples of the East: the throne of the\r\n      Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and saints, and\r\n      angels, the objects of popular veneration; and the Collyridian\r\n      heretics, who flourished in the fruitful soil of Arabia, invested\r\n      the Virgin Mary with the name and honors of a goddess. 75 The\r\n      mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the\r\n      principle of the divine unity. In their obvious sense, they\r\n      introduce three equal deities, and transform the man Jesus into\r\n      the substance of the Son of God: 76 an orthodox commentary will\r\n      satisfy only a believing mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had\r\n      torn the veil of the sanctuary; and each of the Oriental sects\r\n      was eager to confess that all, except themselves, deserved the\r\n      reproach of idolatry and polytheism. The creed of Mahomet is free\r\n      from suspicion or ambiguity; and the Koran is a glorious\r\n      testimony to the unity of God. The prophet of Mecca rejected the\r\n      worship of idols and men, of stars and planets, on the rational\r\n      principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever is born\r\n      must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish. 77\r\n      In the Author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm confessed\r\n      and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place,\r\n      without issue or similitude, present to our most secret thoughts,\r\n      existing by the necessity of his own nature, and deriving from\r\n      himself all moral and intellectual perfection. These sublime\r\n      truths, thus announced in the language of the prophet, 78 are\r\n      firmly held by his disciples, and defined with metaphysical\r\n      precision by the interpreters of the Koran. A philosophic theist\r\n      might subscribe the popular creed of the Mahometans; 79 a creed\r\n      too sublime, perhaps, for our present faculties. What object\r\n      remains for the fancy, or even the understanding, when we have\r\n      abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and\r\n      space, of motion and matter, of sensation and reflection? The\r\n      first principle of reason and revolution was confirmed by the\r\n      voice of Mahomet: his proselytes, from India to Morocco, are\r\n      distinguished by the name of Unitarians; and the danger of\r\n      idolatry has been prevented by the interdiction of images. The\r\n      doctrine of eternal decrees and absolute predestination is\r\n      strictly embraced by the Mahometans; and they struggle, with the\r\n      common difficulties, how to reconcile the prescience of God with\r\n      the freedom and responsibility of man; how to explain the\r\n      permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite\r\n      goodness.\r\n\r\n      74 (return) [ Koran, c. 9, p. 153.

To restore the knowledge of the one,\r\n      and the practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim\r\n      of the prophets of every age: the liberality of Mahomet allowed\r\n      to his predecessors the same credit which he claimed for himself;\r\n      and the chain of inspiration was prolonged from the fall of Adam\r\n      to the promulgation of the Koran. 80 During that period, some\r\n      rays of prophetic light had been imparted to one hundred and\r\n      twenty-four thousand of the elect, discriminated by their\r\n      respective measure of virtue and grace; three hundred and\r\n      thirteen apostles were sent with a special commission to recall\r\n      their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four\r\n      volumes have been dictated by the Holy Spirit; and six\r\n      legislators of transcendent brightness have announced to mankind\r\n      the six successive revelations of various rites, but of one\r\n      immutable religion. The authority and station of Adam, Noah,\r\n      Abraham, Moses, Christ, and Mahomet, rise in just gradation above\r\n      each other; but whosoever hates or rejects any one of the\r\n      prophets is numbered with the infidels. The writings of the\r\n      patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies of the\r\n      Greeks and Syrians: 81 the conduct of Adam had not entitled him\r\n      to the gratitude or respect of his children; the seven precepts\r\n      of Noah were observed by an inferior and imperfect class of the\r\n      proselytes of the synagogue; 82 and the memory of Abraham was\r\n      obscurely revered by the Sabians in his native land of Chaldaea:\r\n      of the myriads of prophets, Moses and Christ alone lived and\r\n      reigned; and the remnant of the inspired writings was comprised\r\n      in the books of the Old and the New Testament. The miraculous\r\n      story of Moses is consecrated and embellished in the Koran; 83\r\n      and the captive Jews enjoy the secret revenge of imposing their\r\n      own belief on the nations whose recent creeds they deride. For\r\n      the author of Christianity, the Mahometans are taught by the\r\n      prophet to entertain a high and mysterious reverence. 84 “Verily,\r\n      Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, is the apostle of God, and his\r\n      word, which he conveyed unto Mary, and a Spirit proceeding from\r\n      him; honorable in this world, and in the world to come, and one\r\n      of those who approach near to the presence of God.” 85 The\r\n      wonders of the genuine and apocryphal gospels 86 are profusely\r\n      heaped on his head; and the Latin church has not disdained to\r\n      borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception 87 of his virgin\r\n      mother. Yet Jesus was a mere mortal; and, at the day of judgment,\r\n      his testimony will serve to condemn both the Jews, who reject him\r\n      as a prophet, and the Christians, who adore him as the Son of\r\n      God. The malice of his enemies aspersed his reputation, and\r\n      conspired against his life; but their intention only was guilty;\r\n      a phantom or a criminal was substituted on the cross; and the\r\n      innocent saint was translated to the seventh heaven. 88 During\r\n      six hundred years the gospel was the way of truth and salvation;\r\n      but the Christians insensibly forgot both the laws and example of\r\n      their founder; and Mahomet was instructed by the Gnostics to\r\n      accuse the church, as well as the synagogue, of corrupting the\r\n      integrity of the sacred text. 89 The piety of Moses and of Christ\r\n      rejoiced in the assurance of a future prophet, more illustrious\r\n      than themselves: the evangelical promise of the Paraclete, or\r\n      Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name, and accomplished in the\r\n      person, of Mahomet, 90 the greatest and the last of the apostles\r\n      of God.\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ Reland, de Relig.

The inspiration of the Hebrew\r\n      prophets, of the apostles and evangelists of Christ, might not be\r\n      incompatible with the exercise of their reason and memory; and\r\n      the diversity of their genius is strongly marked in the style and\r\n      composition of the books of the Old and New Testament. But\r\n      Mahomet was content with a character, more humble, yet more\r\n      sublime, of a simple editor; the substance of the Koran, 91\r\n      according to himself or his disciples, is uncreated and eternal;\r\n      subsisting in the essence of the Deity, and inscribed with a pen\r\n      of light on the table of his everlasting decrees. A paper copy,\r\n      in a volume of silk and gems, was brought down to the lowest\r\n      heaven by the angel Gabriel, who, under the Jewish economy, had\r\n      indeed been despatched on the most important errands; and this\r\n      trusty messenger successively revealed the chapters and verses to\r\n      the Arabian prophet. Instead of a perpetual and perfect measure\r\n      of the divine will, the fragments of the Koran were produced at\r\n      the discretion of Mahomet; each revelation is suited to the\r\n      emergencies of his policy or passion; and all contradiction is\r\n      removed by the saving maxim, that any text of Scripture is\r\n      abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage. The word of God,\r\n      and of the apostle, was diligently recorded by his disciples on\r\n      palm-leaves and the shoulder-bones of mutton; and the pages,\r\n      without order or connection, were cast into a domestic chest, in\r\n      the custody of one of his wives. Two years after the death of\r\n      Mahomet, the sacred volume was collected and published by his\r\n      friend and successor Abubeker: the work was revised by the caliph\r\n      Othman, in the thirtieth year of the Hegira; and the various\r\n      editions of the Koran assert the same miraculous privilege of a\r\n      uniform and incorruptible text. In the spirit of enthusiasm or\r\n      vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the merit\r\n      of his book; audaciously challenges both men and angels to\r\n      imitate the beauties of a single page; and presumes to assert\r\n      that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance. 92\r\n      This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian,\r\n      whose mind is attuned to faith and rapture; whose ear is\r\n      delighted by the music of sounds; and whose ignorance is\r\n      incapable of comparing the productions of human genius. 93 The\r\n      harmony and copiousness of style will not reach, in a version,\r\n      the European infidel: he will peruse with impatience the endless\r\n      incoherent rhapsody of fable, and precept, and declamation, which\r\n      seldom excites a sentiment or an idea, which sometimes crawls in\r\n      the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds. The divine\r\n      attributes exalt the fancy of the Arabian missionary; but his\r\n      loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book\r\n      of Job, composed in a remote age, in the same country, and in the\r\n      same language. 94 If the composition of the Koran exceed the\r\n      faculties of a man to what superior intelligence should we\r\n      ascribe the Iliad of Homer, or the Philippics of Demosthenes? In\r\n      all religions, the life of the founder supplies the silence of\r\n      his written revelation: the sayings of Mahomet were so many\r\n      lessons of truth; his actions so many examples of virtue; and the\r\n      public and private memorials were preserved by his wives and\r\n      companions.

As often as he is pressed by the demands of the\r\n      Koreish, he involves himself in the obscure boast of vision and\r\n      prophecy, appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine, and\r\n      shields himself behind the providence of God, who refuses those\r\n      signs and wonders that would depreciate the merit of faith, and\r\n      aggravate the guilt of infidelity But the modest or angry tone of\r\n      his apologies betrays his weakness and vexation; and these\r\n      passages of scandal established, beyond suspicion, the integrity\r\n      of the Koran. 96 The votaries of Mahomet are more assured than\r\n      himself of his miraculous gifts; and their confidence and\r\n      credulity increase as they are farther removed from the time and\r\n      place of his spiritual exploits. They believe or affirm that\r\n      trees went forth to meet him; that he was saluted by stones; that\r\n      water gushed from his fingers; that he fed the hungry, cured the\r\n      sick, and raised the dead; that a beam groaned to him; that a\r\n      camel complained to him; that a shoulder of mutton informed him\r\n      of its being poisoned; and that both animate and inanimate nature\r\n      were equally subject to the apostle of God. 97 His dream of a\r\n      nocturnal journey is seriously described as a real and corporeal\r\n      transaction. A mysterious animal, the Borak, conveyed him from\r\n      the temple of Mecca to that of Jerusalem: with his companion\r\n      Gabriel he successively ascended the seven heavens, and received\r\n      and repaid the salutations of the patriarchs, the prophets, and\r\n      the angels, in their respective mansions. Beyond the seventh\r\n      heaven, Mahomet alone was permitted to proceed; he passed the\r\n      veil of unity, approached within two bow-shots of the throne, and\r\n      felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his shoulder was\r\n      touched by the hand of God. After this familiar, though important\r\n      conversation, he again descended to Jerusalem, remounted the\r\n      Borak, returned to Mecca, and performed in the tenth part of a\r\n      night the journey of many thousand years. 98 According to another\r\n      legend, the apostle confounded in a national assembly the\r\n      malicious challenge of the Koreish. His resistless word split\r\n      asunder the orb of the moon: the obedient planet stooped from her\r\n      station in the sky, accomplished the seven revolutions round the\r\n      Caaba, saluted Mahomet in the Arabian tongue, and, suddenly\r\n      contracting her dimensions, entered at the collar, and issued\r\n      forth through the sleeve, of his shirt. 99 The vulgar are amused\r\n      with these marvellous tales; but the gravest of the Mussulman\r\n      doctors imitate the modesty of their master, and indulge a\r\n      latitude of faith or interpretation. 100 They might speciously\r\n      allege, that in preaching the religion it was needless to violate\r\n      the harmony of nature; that a creed unclouded with mystery may be\r\n      excused from miracles; and that the sword of Mahomet was not less\r\n      potent than the rod of Moses.\r\n\r\n      96 (return) [ See, more remarkably, Koran, c. 2, 6, 12, 13, 17.\r\n      Prideaux (Life of Mahomet, p. 18, 19) has confounded the\r\n      impostor.

The prophet of\r\n      Mecca was tempted by prejudice, or policy, or patriotism, to\r\n      sanctify the rites of the Arabians, and the custom of visiting\r\n      the holy stone of the Caaba. But the precepts of Mahomet himself\r\n      inculcates a more simple and rational piety: prayer, fasting, and\r\n      alms, are the religious duties of a Mussulman; and he is\r\n      encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him half way to God,\r\n      fasting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will\r\n      gain him admittance. 101 I. According to the tradition of the\r\n      nocturnal journey, the apostle, in his personal conference with\r\n      the Deity, was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily\r\n      obligation of fifty prayers. By the advice of Moses, he applied\r\n      for an alleviation of this intolerable burden; the number was\r\n      gradually reduced to five; without any dispensation of business\r\n      or pleasure, or time or place: the devotion of the faithful is\r\n      repeated at daybreak, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening,\r\n      and at the first watch of the night; and in the present decay of\r\n      religious fervor, our travellers are edified by the profound\r\n      humility and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness is\r\n      the key of prayer: the frequent lustration of the hands, the\r\n      face, and the body, which was practised of old by the Arabs, is\r\n      solemnly enjoined by the Koran; and a permission is formally\r\n      granted to supply with sand the scarcity of water. The words and\r\n      attitudes of supplication, as it is performed either sitting, or\r\n      standing, or prostrate on the ground, are prescribed by custom or\r\n      authority; but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent\r\n      ejaculations; the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious\r\n      liturgy; and each Mussulman for his own person is invested with\r\n      the character of a priest. Among the theists, who reject the use\r\n      of images, it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings\r\n      of the fancy, by directing the eye and the thought towards a\r\n      kebla, or visible point of the horizon. The prophet was at first\r\n      inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem; but he\r\n      soon returned to a more natural partiality; and five times every\r\n      day the eyes of the nations at Astracan, at Fez, at Delhi, are\r\n      devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca. Yet every spot for\r\n      the service of God is equally pure: the Mahometans indifferently\r\n      pray in their chamber or in the street. As a distinction from the\r\n      Jews and Christians, the Friday in each week is set apart for the\r\n      useful institution of public worship: the people is assembled in\r\n      the mosch; and the imam, some respectable elder, ascends the\r\n      pulpit, to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon. But the\r\n      Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice; and\r\n      the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on\r\n      the ministers and the slaves of superstition. 1011\r\n\r\n      II. The voluntary 102 penance of the ascetics, the torment and\r\n      glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his\r\n      companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and\r\n      sleep; and firmly declared, that he would suffer no monks in his\r\n      religion. 103 Yet he instituted, in each year, a fast of thirty\r\n      days; and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline\r\n      which purifies the soul and subdues the body, as a salutary\r\n      exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle. During\r\n      the month of Ramadan, from the rising to the setting of the sun,\r\n      the Mussulman abstains from eating, and drinking, and women, and\r\n      baths, and perfumes; from all nourishment that can restore his\r\n      strength, from all pleasure that can gratify his senses. In the\r\n      revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan coincides, by turns,\r\n      with the winter cold and the summer heat; and the patient martyr,\r\n      without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must expect\r\n      the close of a tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine,\r\n      peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits, is converted by\r\n      Mahomet alone into a positive and general law; 104 and a\r\n      considerable portion of the globe has abjured, at his command,\r\n      the use of that salutary, though dangerous, liquor. These painful\r\n      restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the libertine, and eluded\r\n      by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by whom they are enacted,\r\n      cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the\r\n      indulgence of their sensual appetites. III. The charity of the\r\n      Mahometans descends to the animal creation; and the Koran\r\n      repeatedly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and\r\n      indispensable duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortunate.\r\n      Mahomet, perhaps, is the only lawgiver who has defined the\r\n      precise measure of charity: the standard may vary with the degree\r\n      and nature of property, as it consists either in money, in corn\r\n      or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the Mussulman does not\r\n      accomplish the law, unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue; and\r\n      if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth,\r\n      under the idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth. 105\r\n      Benevolence is the foundation of justice, since we are forbid to\r\n      injure those whom we are bound to assist. A prophet may reveal\r\n      the secrets of heaven and of futurity; but in his moral precepts\r\n      he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts.\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ The most authentic account of these precepts,\r\n      pilgrimage, prayer, fasting, alms, and ablutions, is extracted\r\n      from the Persian and Arabian theologians by Maracci, (Prodrom.\r\n      part iv. p. 9-24,) Reland, (in his excellent treatise de\r\n      Religione Mohammedica, Utrecht, 1717, p. 67-123,) and Chardin,\r\n      (Voyages in Perse, tom. iv. p. 47-195.) Marace is a partial\r\n      accuser; but the jeweller, Chardin, had the eyes of a\r\n      philosopher; and Reland, a judicious student, had travelled over\r\n      the East in his closet at Utrecht.

The prophet has not presumed to determine the\r\n      moment of that awful catastrophe, though he darkly announces the\r\n      signs, both in heaven and earth, which will precede the universal\r\n      dissolution, when life shall be destroyed, and the order of\r\n      creation shall be confounded in the primitive chaos.

But the attempt is partial and unavailing; and it is with\r\n      a more philosophic spirit that Mahomet relies on the omnipotence\r\n      of the Creator, whose word can reanimate the breathless clay, and\r\n      collect the innumerable atoms, that no longer retain their form\r\n      or substance. 107 The intermediate state of the soul it is hard\r\n      to decide; and those who most firmly believe her immaterial\r\n      nature, are at a loss to understand how she can think or act\r\n      without the agency of the organs of sense.\r\n\r\n      106 (return) [ See Herodotus (l. ii. c. 123) and our learned\r\n      countryman Sir John Marsham, (Canon.

By his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for\r\n      extending, even to themselves, the hope of salvation, for\r\n      asserting the blackest heresy, that every man who believes in\r\n      God, and accomplishes good works, may expect in the last day a\r\n      favorable sentence. Such rational indifference is ill adapted to\r\n      the character of a fanatic; nor is it probable that a messenger\r\n      from heaven should depreciate the value and necessity of his own\r\n      revelation. In the idiom of the Koran, 108 the belief of God is\r\n      inseparable from that of Mahomet: the good works are those which\r\n      he has enjoined, and the two qualifications imply the profession\r\n      of Islam, to which all nations and all sects are equally invited.\r\n\r\n      Their spiritual blindness, though excused by ignorance and\r\n      crowned with virtue, will be scourged with everlasting torments;\r\n      and the tears which Mahomet shed over the tomb of his mother for\r\n      whom he was forbidden to pray, display a striking contrast of\r\n      humanity and enthusiasm. 109 The doom of the infidels is common:\r\n      the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined by the\r\n      degree of evidence which they have rejected, by the magnitude of\r\n      the errors which they have entertained: the eternal mansions of\r\n      the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the Magians, and\r\n      idolaters, are sunk below each other in the abyss; and the lowest\r\n      hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed\r\n      the mask of religion.

The good and evil of each Mussulman will\r\n      be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance; and a\r\n      singular mode of compensation will be allowed for the payment of\r\n      injuries: the aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good\r\n      actions, for the benefit of the person whom he has wronged; and\r\n      if he should be destitute of any moral property, the weight of\r\n      his sins will be loaded with an adequate share of the demerits of\r\n      the sufferer. According as the shares of guilt or virtue shall\r\n      preponderate, the sentence will be pronounced, and all, without\r\n      distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the\r\n      abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mahomet,\r\n      will gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty\r\n      will fall into the first and mildest of the seven hells. The term\r\n      of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years;\r\n      but the prophet has judiciously promised, that all his disciples,\r\n      whatever may be their sins, shall be saved, by their own faith\r\n      and his intercession from eternal damnation. It is not surprising\r\n      that superstition should act most powerfully on the fears of her\r\n      votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more energy the\r\n      misery than the bliss of a future life. With the two simple\r\n      elements of darkness and fire, we create a sensation of pain,\r\n      which may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of\r\n      endless duration. But the same idea operates with an opposite\r\n      effect on the continuity of pleasure; and too much of our present\r\n      enjoyments is obtained from the relief, or the comparison, of\r\n      evil. It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell\r\n      with rapture on the groves, the fountains, and the rivers of\r\n      paradise; but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a\r\n      liberal taste for harmony and science, conversation and\r\n      friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds, the robes\r\n      of silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gold, rich wines,\r\n      artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of\r\n      sensual and costly luxury, which becomes insipid to the owner,\r\n      even in the short period of this mortal life. Seventy-two Houris,\r\n      or black-eyed girls, of resplendent beauty, blooming youth,\r\n      virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility, will be created for the\r\n      use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will be\r\n      prolonged to a thousand years; and his faculties will be\r\n      increased a hundred fold, to render him worthy of his felicity.\r\n      Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice, the gates of heaven will be\r\n      open to both sexes; but Mahomet has not specified the male\r\n      companions of the female elect, lest he should either alarm the\r\n      jealousy of their former husbands, or disturb their felicity, by\r\n      the suspicion of an everlasting marriage. This image of a carnal\r\n      paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the envy, of the\r\n      monks: they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet; and\r\n      his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures\r\n      and allegories. But the sounder and more consistent party adhere\r\n      without shame, to the literal interpretation of the Koran:\r\n      useless would be the resurrection of the body, unless it were\r\n      restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest\r\n      faculties; and the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is\r\n      requisite to complete the happiness of the double animal, the\r\n      perfect man. Yet the joys of the Mahometan paradise will not be\r\n      confined to the indulgence of luxury and appetite; and the\r\n      prophet has expressly declared that all meaner happiness will be\r\n      forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs, who shall be\r\n      admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision. 110\r\n\r\n      108 (return) [ The candid Reland has demonstrated, that Mahomet\r\n      damns all unbelievers, (de Religion.

Yet Cadijah believed the words,\r\n      and cherished the glory, of her husband; the obsequious and\r\n      affectionate Zeid was tempted by the prospect of freedom; the\r\n      illustrious Ali, the son of Abu Taleb, embraced the sentiments of\r\n      his cousin with the spirit of a youthful hero; and the wealth,\r\n      the moderation, the veracity of Abubeker confirmed the religion\r\n      of the prophet whom he was destined to succeed. By his\r\n      persuasion, ten of the most respectable citizens of Mecca were\r\n      introduced to the private lessons of Islam; they yielded to the\r\n      voice of reason and enthusiasm; they repeated the fundamental\r\n      creed, “There is but one God, and Mahomet is the apostle of God;”\r\n      and their faith, even in this life, was rewarded with riches and\r\n      honors, with the command of armies and the government of\r\n      kingdoms. Three years were silently employed in the conversion of\r\n      fourteen proselytes, the first-fruits of his mission; but in the\r\n      fourth year he assumed the prophetic office, and resolving to\r\n      impart to his family the light of divine truth, he prepared a\r\n      banquet, a lamb, as it is said, and a bowl of milk, for the\r\n      entertainment of forty guests of the race of Hashem. “Friends and\r\n      kinsmen,” said Mahomet to the assembly, “I offer you, and I alone\r\n      can offer, the most precious of gifts, the treasures of this\r\n      world and of the world to come. God has commanded me to call you\r\n      to his service. Who among you will support my burden? Who among\r\n      you will be my companion and my vizier?” 113 No answer was\r\n      returned, till the silence of astonishment, and doubt, and\r\n      contempt, was at length broken by the impatient courage of Ali, a\r\n      youth in the fourteenth year of his age. “O prophet, I am the\r\n      man: whosoever rises against thee, I will dash out his teeth,\r\n      tear out his eyes, break his legs, rip up his belly. O prophet, I\r\n      will be thy vizier over them.” Mahomet accepted his offer with\r\n      transport, and Abu Taled was ironically exhorted to respect the\r\n      superior dignity of his son. In a more serious tone, the father\r\n      of Ali advised his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design.\r\n\r\n      “Spare your remonstrances,” replied the intrepid fanatic to his\r\n      uncle and benefactor; “if they should place the sun on my right\r\n      hand, and the moon on my left, they should not divert me from my\r\n      course.” He persevered ten years in the exercise of his mission;\r\n      and the religion which has overspread the East and the West\r\n      advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls of\r\n      Mecca. Yet Mahomet enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding the\r\n      increase of his infant congregation of Unitarians, who revered\r\n      him as a prophet, and to whom he seasonably dispensed the\r\n      spiritual nourishment of the Koran. The number of proselytes may\r\n      be esteemed by the absence of eighty-three men and eighteen\r\n      women, who retired to Aethiopia in the seventh year of his\r\n      mission; and his party was fortified by the timely conversion of\r\n      his uncle Hamza, and of the fierce and inflexible Omar, who\r\n      signalized in the cause of Islam the same zeal, which he had\r\n      exerted for its destruction. Nor was the charity of Mahomet\r\n      confined to the tribe of Koreish, or the precincts of Mecca: on\r\n      solemn festivals, in the days of pilgrimage, he frequented the\r\n      Caaba, accosted the strangers of every tribe, and urged, both in\r\n      private converse and public discourse, the belief and worship of\r\n      a sole Deity. Conscious of his reason and of his weakness, he\r\n      asserted the liberty of conscience, and disclaimed the use of\r\n      religious violence: 114 but he called the Arabs to repentance,\r\n      and conjured them to remember the ancient idolaters of Ad and\r\n      Thamud, whom the divine justice had swept away from the face of\r\n      the earth. 115\r\n\r\n      111 (return) [ Before I enter on the history of the prophet, it\r\n      is incumbent on me to produce my evidence.

The elders of the city, the uncles of the\r\n      prophet, affected to despise the presumption of an orphan, the\r\n      reformer of his country: the pious orations of Mahomet in the\r\n      Caaba were answered by the clamors of Abu Taleb. “Citizens and\r\n      pilgrims, listen not to the tempter, hearken not to his impious\r\n      novelties. Stand fast in the worship of Al Lata and Al Uzzah.”\r\n      Yet the son of Abdallah was ever dear to the aged chief: and he\r\n      protected the fame and person of his nephew against the assaults\r\n      of the Koreishites, who had long been jealous of the preeminence\r\n      of the family of Hashem. Their malice was colored with the\r\n      pretence of religion: in the age of Job, the crime of impiety was\r\n      punished by the Arabian magistrate; 116 and Mahomet was guilty of\r\n      deserting and denying the national deities. But so loose was the\r\n      policy of Mecca, that the leaders of the Koreish, instead of\r\n      accusing a criminal, were compelled to employ the measures of\r\n      persuasion or violence. They repeatedly addressed Abu Taleb in\r\n      the style of reproach and menace. “Thy nephew reviles our\r\n      religion; he accuses our wise forefathers of ignorance and folly;\r\n      silence him quickly, lest he kindle tumult and discord in the\r\n      city. If he persevere, we shall draw our swords against him and\r\n      his adherents, and thou wilt be responsible for the blood of thy\r\n      fellow-citizens.” The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded\r\n      the violence of religious faction; the most helpless or timid of\r\n      the disciples retired to Aethiopia, and the prophet withdrew\r\n      himself to various places of strength in the town and country. As\r\n      he was still supported by his family, the rest of the tribe of\r\n      Koreish engaged themselves to renounce all intercourse with the\r\n      children of Hashem, neither to buy nor sell, neither to marry not\r\n      to give in marriage, but to pursue them with implacable enmity,\r\n      till they should deliver the person of Mahomet to the justice of\r\n      the gods. The decree was suspended in the Caaba before the eyes\r\n      of the nation; the messengers of the Koreish pursued the\r\n      Mussulman exiles in the heart of Africa: they besieged the\r\n      prophet and his most faithful followers, intercepted their water,\r\n      and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation of\r\n      injuries and insults. A doubtful truce restored the appearances\r\n      of concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the\r\n      power of his enemies, at the moment when he was deprived of his\r\n      domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous\r\n      Cadijah. Abu Sophian, the chief of the branch of Ommiyah,\r\n      succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca. A zealous\r\n      votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the line of Hashem, he\r\n      convened an assembly of the Koreishites and their allies, to\r\n      decide the fate of the apostle. His imprisonment might provoke\r\n      the despair of his enthusiasm; and the exile of an eloquent and\r\n      popular fanatic would diffuse the mischief through the provinces\r\n      of Arabia. His death was resolved; and they agreed that a sword\r\n      from each tribe should be buried in his heart, to divide the\r\n      guilt of his blood, and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites.\r\n      An angel or a spy revealed their conspiracy; and flight was the\r\n      only resource of Mahomet. 117 At the dead of night, accompanied\r\n      by his friend Abubeker, he silently escaped from his house: the\r\n      assassins watched at the door; but they were deceived by the\r\n      figure of Ali, who reposed on the bed, and was covered with the\r\n      green vestment of the apostle. The Koreish respected the piety of\r\n      the heroic youth; but some verses of Ali, which are still extant,\r\n      exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety, his tenderness,\r\n      and his religious confidence. Three days Mahomet and his\r\n      companion were concealed in the cave of Thor, at the distance of\r\n      a league from Mecca; and in the close of each evening, they\r\n      received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of\r\n      intelligence and food. The diligence of the Koreish explored\r\n      every haunt in the neighborhood of the city: they arrived at the\r\n      entrance of the cavern; but the providential deceit of a spider’s\r\n      web and a pigeon’s nest is supposed to convince them that the\r\n      place was solitary and inviolate. “We are only two,” said the\r\n      trembling Abubeker. “There is a third,” replied the prophet; “it\r\n      is God himself.” No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two\r\n      fugitives issued from the rock, and mounted their camels: on the\r\n      road to Medina, they were overtaken by the emissaries of the\r\n      Koreish; they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from\r\n      their hands. In this eventful moment, the lance of an Arab might\r\n      have changed the history of the world. The flight of the prophet\r\n      from Mecca to Medina has fixed the memorable aera of the Hegira,\r\n      118 which, at the end of twelve centuries, still discriminates\r\n      the lunar years of the Mahometan nations. 119\r\n\r\n      116 (return) [ In the time of Job, the crime of impiety was\r\n      punished by the Arabian magistrate, (c. 21, v. 26, 27, 28.)

Some of her noblest\r\n      citizens, in a pilgrimage to the Canaba, were converted by the\r\n      preaching of Mahomet; on their return, they diffused the belief\r\n      of God and his prophet, and the new alliance was ratified by\r\n      their deputies in two secret and nocturnal interviews on a hill\r\n      in the suburbs of Mecca. In the first, ten Charegites and two\r\n      Awsites united in faith and love, protested, in the name of their\r\n      wives, their children, and their absent brethren, that they would\r\n      forever profess the creed, and observe the precepts, of the\r\n      Koran. The second was a political association, the first vital\r\n      spark of the empire of the Saracens. 120 Seventy-three men and\r\n      two women of Medina held a solemn conference with Mahomet, his\r\n      kinsman, and his disciples; and pledged themselves to each other\r\n      by a mutual oath of fidelity. They promised, in the name of the\r\n      city, that if he should be banished, they would receive him as a\r\n      confederate, obey him as a leader, and defend him to the last\r\n      extremity, like their wives and children. “But if you are\r\n      recalled by your country,” they asked with a flattering anxiety,\r\n      “will you not abandon your new allies?” “All things,” replied\r\n      Mahomet with a smile, “are now common between us; your blood is\r\n      as my blood, your ruin as my ruin. We are bound to each other by\r\n      the ties of honor and interest. I am your friend, and the enemy\r\n      of your foes.” “But if we are killed in your service, what,”\r\n      exclaimed the deputies of Medina, “will be our reward?”\r\n      “Paradise,” replied the prophet. “Stretch forth thy hand.” He\r\n      stretched it forth, and they reiterated the oath of allegiance\r\n      and fidelity. Their treaty was ratified by the people, who\r\n      unanimously embraced the profession of Islam; they rejoiced in\r\n      the exile of the apostle, but they trembled for his safety, and\r\n      impatiently expected his arrival. After a perilous and rapid\r\n      journey along the sea-coast, he halted at Koba, two miles from\r\n      the city, and made his public entry into Medina, sixteen days\r\n      after his flight from Mecca. Five hundred of the citizens\r\n      advanced to meet him; he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty\r\n      and devotion; Mahomet was mounted on a she-camel, an umbrella\r\n      shaded his head, and a turban was unfurled before him to supply\r\n      the deficiency of a standard. His bravest disciples, who had been\r\n      scattered by the storm, assembled round his person; and the\r\n      equal, though various, merit of the Moslems was distinguished by\r\n      the names of Mohagerians and Ansars, the fugitives of Mecca, and\r\n      the auxiliaries of Medina. To eradicate the seeds of jealousy,\r\n      Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal followers with the\r\n      rights and obligations of brethren; and when Ali found himself\r\n      without a peer, the prophet tenderly declared, that he would be\r\n      the companion and brother of the noble youth. The expedient was\r\n      crowned with success; the holy fraternity was respected in peace\r\n      and war, and the two parties vied with each other in a generous\r\n      emulation of courage and fidelity. Once only the concord was\r\n      slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel: a patriot of Medina\r\n      arraigned the insolence of the strangers, but the hint of their\r\n      expulsion was heard with abhorrence; and his own son most eagerly\r\n      offered to lay at the apostle’s feet the head of his father.\r\n\r\n      120 (return) [ The triple inauguration of Mahomet is described by\r\n      Abulfeda (p. 30, 33, 40, 86) and Gagnier, (tom. i. p. 342, &c.,\r\n      349, &c., tom. ii. p. 223 &c.)]\r\n\r\n      From his establishment at Medina, Mahomet assumed the exercise of\r\n      the regal and sacerdotal office; and it was impious to appeal\r\n      from a judge whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom. A\r\n      small portion of ground, the patrimony of two orphans, was\r\n      acquired by gift or purchase; 121 on that chosen spot he built a\r\n      house and a mosch, more venerable in their rude simplicity than\r\n      the palaces and temples of the Assyrian caliphs. His seal of\r\n      gold, or silver, was inscribed with the apostolic title; when he\r\n      prayed and preached in the weekly assembly, he leaned against the\r\n      trunk of a palm-tree; and it was long before he indulged himself\r\n      in the use of a chair or pulpit of rough timber. 122 After a\r\n      reign of six years, fifteen hundred Moslems, in arms and in the\r\n      field, renewed their oath of allegiance; and their chief repeated\r\n      the assurance of protection till the death of the last member, or\r\n      the final dissolution of the party. It was in the same camp that\r\n      the deputy of Mecca was astonished by the attention of the\r\n      faithful to the words and looks of the prophet, by the eagerness\r\n      with which they collected his spittle, a hair that dropped on the\r\n      ground, the refuse water of his lustrations, as if they\r\n      participated in some degree of the prophetic virtue. “I have\r\n      seen,” said he, “the Chosroes of Persia and the Caesar of Rome,\r\n      but never did I behold a king among his subjects like Mahomet\r\n      among his companions.” The devout fervor of enthusiasm acts with\r\n      more energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of\r\n      courts.\r\n\r\n      121 (return) [ Prideaux (Life of Mahomet, p. 44) reviles the\r\n      wickedness of the impostor, who despoiled two poor orphans, the\r\n      sons of a carpenter; a reproach which he drew from the Disputatio\r\n      contra Saracenos, composed in Arabic before the year 1130; but\r\n      the honest Gagnier (ad Abulfed. p. 53) has shown that they were\r\n      deceived by the word Al Nagjar, which signifies, in this place,\r\n      not an obscure trade, but a noble tribe of Arabs. The desolate\r\n      state of the ground is described by Abulfeda; and his worthy\r\n      interpreter has proved, from Al Bochari, the offer of a price;\r\n      from Al Jannabi, the fair purchase; and from Ahmeq Ben Joseph,\r\n      the payment of the money by the generous Abubeker On these\r\n      grounds the prophet must be honorably acquitted.]\r\n\r\n      122 (return) [ Al Jannabi (apud Gagnier, tom. ii. p. 246, 324)\r\n      describes the seal and pulpit, as two venerable relics of the\r\n      apostle of God; and the portrait of his court is taken from\r\n      Abulfeda, (c. 44, p. 85.)]\r\n\r\n      In the state of nature, every man has a right to defend, by force\r\n      of arms, his person and his possessions; to repel, or even to\r\n      prevent, the violence of his enemies, and to extend his\r\n      hostilities to a reasonable measure of satisfaction and\r\n      retaliation. In the free society of the Arabs, the duties of\r\n      subject and citizen imposed a feeble restraint; and Mahomet, in\r\n      the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission, had been\r\n      despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen. The\r\n      choice of an independent people had exalted the fugitive of Mecca\r\n      to the rank of a sovereign; and he was invested with the just\r\n      prerogative of forming alliances, and of waging offensive or\r\n      defensive war. The imperfection of human rights was supplied and\r\n      armed by the plenitude of divine power: the prophet of Medina\r\n      assumed, in his new revelations, a fiercer and more sanguinary\r\n      tone, which proves that his former moderation was the effect of\r\n      weakness: 123 the means of persuasion had been tried, the season\r\n      of forbearance was elapsed, and he was now commanded to propagate\r\n      his religion by the sword, to destroy the monuments of idolatry,\r\n      and, without regarding the sanctity of days or months, to pursue\r\n      the unbelieving nations of the earth. The same bloody precepts,\r\n      so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran, are ascribed by the author\r\n      to the Pentateuch and the Gospel. But the mild tenor of the\r\n      evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text, that Jesus did not\r\n      bring peace on the earth, but a sword: his patient and humble\r\n      virtues should not be confounded with the intolerant zeal of\r\n      princes and bishops, who have disgraced the name of his\r\n      disciples. In the prosecution of religious war, Mahomet might\r\n      appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses, of the\r\n      Judges, and the kings of Israel. The military laws of the Hebrews\r\n      are still more rigid than those of the Arabian legislator. 124\r\n      The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews: if a city\r\n      resisted their summons, the males, without distinction, were put\r\n      to the sword: the seven nations of Canaan were devoted to\r\n      destruction; and neither repentance nor conversion, could shield\r\n      them from the inevitable doom, that no creature within their\r\n      precincts should be left alive. 1241 The fair option of\r\n      friendship, or submission, or battle, was proposed to the enemies\r\n      of Mahomet. If they professed the creed of Islam, they were\r\n      admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his\r\n      primitive disciples, and marched under the same banner to extend\r\n      the religion which they had embraced. The clemency of the prophet\r\n      was decided by his interest: yet he seldom trampled on a\r\n      prostrate enemy; and he seems to promise, that on the payment of\r\n      a tribute, the least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be\r\n      indulged in their worship, or at least in their imperfect faith.\r\n      In the first months of his reign he practised the lessons of holy\r\n      warfare, and displayed his white banner before the gates of\r\n      Medina: the martial apostle fought in person at nine battles or\r\n      sieges; 125 and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in ten\r\n      years by himself or his lieutenants. The Arab continued to unite\r\n      the professions of a merchant and a robber; and his petty\r\n      excursions for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly\r\n      prepared his troops for the conquest of Arabia. The distribution\r\n      of the spoil was regulated by a divine law: 126 the whole was\r\n      faithfully collected in one common mass: a fifth of the gold and\r\n      silver, the prisoners and cattle, the movables and immovables,\r\n      was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable uses; the\r\n      remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had\r\n      obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards of the\r\n      slain devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of\r\n      cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the\r\n      horse and to the man. From all sides the roving Arabs were\r\n      allured to the standard of religion and plunder: the apostle\r\n      sanctified the license of embracing the female captives as their\r\n      wives or concubines, and the enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a\r\n      feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for the valiant\r\n      martyrs of the faith. “The sword,” says Mahomet, “is the key of\r\n      heaven and of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a\r\n      night spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting\r\n      or prayer: whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at\r\n      the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion,\r\n      and odoriferous as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be\r\n      supplied by the wings of angels and cherubim.” The intrepid souls\r\n      of the Arabs were fired with enthusiasm: the picture of the\r\n      invisible world was strongly painted on their imagination; and\r\n      the death which they had always despised became an object of hope\r\n      and desire. The Koran inculcates, in the most absolute sense, the\r\n      tenets of fate and predestination, which would extinguish both\r\n      industry and virtue, if the actions of man were governed by his\r\n      speculative belief. Yet their influence in every age has exalted\r\n      the courage of the Saracens and Turks. The first companions of\r\n      Mahomet advanced to battle with a fearless confidence: there is\r\n      no danger where there is no chance: they were ordained to perish\r\n      in their beds; or they were safe and invulnerable amidst the\r\n      darts of the enemy. 127\r\n\r\n      123 (return) [ The viiith and ixth chapters of the Koran are the\r\n      loudest and most vehement; and Maracci (Prodromus, part iv. p.\r\n      59-64) has inveighed with more justice than discretion against\r\n      the double dealing of the impostor.]\r\n\r\n      124 (return) [ The xth and xxth chapters of Deuteronomy, with the\r\n      practical comments of Joshua, David, &c., are read with more awe\r\n      than satisfaction by the pious Christians of the present age.

Abu Sophian\r\n      himself, with only thirty or forty followers, conducted a wealthy\r\n      caravan of a thousand camels; the fortune or dexterity of his\r\n      march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet; but the chief of the\r\n      Koreish was informed that the holy robbers were placed in ambush\r\n      to await his return. He despatched a messenger to his brethren of\r\n      Mecca, and they were roused, by the fear of losing their\r\n      merchandise and their provisions, unless they hastened to his\r\n      relief with the military force of the city. The sacred band of\r\n      Mahomet was formed of three hundred and thirteen Moslems, of whom\r\n      seventy-seven were fugitives, and the rest auxiliaries; they\r\n      mounted by turns a train of seventy camels, (the camels of\r\n      Yathreb were formidable in war;) but such was the poverty of his\r\n      first disciples, that only two could appear on horseback in the\r\n      field. 128 In the fertile and famous vale of Beder, 129 three\r\n      stations from Medina, he was informed by his scouts of the\r\n      caravan that approached on one side; of the Koreish, one hundred\r\n      horse, eight hundred and fifty foot, who advanced on the other.\r\n      After a short debate, he sacrificed the prospect of wealth to the\r\n      pursuit of glory and revenge, and a slight intrenchment was\r\n      formed, to cover his troops, and a stream of fresh water, that\r\n      glided through the valley. “O God,” he exclaimed, as the numbers\r\n      of the Koreish descended from the hills, “O God, if these are\r\n      destroyed, by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth?—Courage,\r\n      my children; close your ranks; discharge your arrows, and the day\r\n      is your own.” At these words he placed himself, with Abubeker, on\r\n      a throne or pulpit, 130 and instantly demanded the succor of\r\n      Gabriel and three thousand angels. His eye was fixed on the field\r\n      of battle: the Mussulmans fainted and were pressed: in that\r\n      decisive moment the prophet started from his throne, mounted his\r\n      horse, and cast a handful of sand into the air: “Let their faces\r\n      be covered with confusion.” Both armies heard the thunder of his\r\n      voice: their fancy beheld the angelic warriors: 131 the Koreish\r\n      trembled and fled: seventy of the bravest were slain; and seventy\r\n      captives adorned the first victory of the faithful. The dead\r\n      bodies of the Koreish were despoiled and insulted: two of the\r\n      most obnoxious prisoners were punished with death; and the ransom\r\n      of the others, four thousand drams of silver, compensated in some\r\n      degree the escape of the caravan. But it was in vain that the\r\n      camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and\r\n      along the Euphrates: they were overtaken by the diligence of the\r\n      Mussulmans; and wealthy must have been the prize, if twenty\r\n      thousand drams could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle.\r\n      The resentment of the public and private loss stimulated Abu\r\n      Sophian to collect a body of three thousand men, seven hundred of\r\n      whom were armed with cuirasses, and two hundred were mounted on\r\n      horseback; three thousand camels attended his march; and his wife\r\n      Henda, with fifteen matrons of Mecca, incessantly sounded their\r\n      timbrels to animate the troops, and to magnify the greatness of\r\n      Hobal, the most popular deity of the Caaba. The standard of God\r\n      and Mahomet was upheld by nine hundred and fifty believers: the\r\n      disproportion of numbers was not more alarming than in the field\r\n      of Beder; and their presumption of victory prevailed against the\r\n      divine and human sense of the apostle. The second battle was\r\n      fought on Mount Ohud, six miles to the north of Medina; 132 the\r\n      Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent; and the right wing of\r\n      cavalry was led by Caled, the fiercest and most successful of the\r\n      Arabian warriors. The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on\r\n      the declivity of the hill; and their rear was guarded by a\r\n      detachment of fifty archers. The weight of their charge impelled\r\n      and broke the centre of the idolaters: but in the pursuit they\r\n      lost the advantage of their ground: the archers deserted their\r\n      station: the Mussulmans were tempted by the spoil, disobeyed\r\n      their general, and disordered their ranks. The intrepid Caled,\r\n      wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear, exclaimed, with a\r\n      loud voice, that Mahomet was slain. He was indeed wounded in the\r\n      face with a javelin: two of his teeth were shattered with a\r\n      stone; yet, in the midst of tumult and dismay, he reproached the\r\n      infidels with the murder of a prophet; and blessed the friendly\r\n      hand that stanched his blood, and conveyed him to a place of\r\n      safety. Seventy martyrs died for the sins of the people; they\r\n      fell, said the apostle, in pairs, each brother embracing his\r\n      lifeless companion; 133 their bodies were mangled by the inhuman\r\n      females of Mecca; and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails\r\n      of Hamza, the uncle of Mahomet. They might applaud their\r\n      superstition, and satiate their fury; but the Mussulmans soon\r\n      rallied in the field, and the Koreish wanted strength or courage\r\n      to undertake the siege of Medina. It was attacked the ensuing\r\n      year by an army of ten thousand enemies; and this third\r\n      expedition is variously named from the nations, which marched\r\n      under the banner of Abu Sophian, from the ditch which was drawn\r\n      before the city, and a camp of three thousand Mussulmans. The\r\n      prudence of Mahomet declined a general engagement: the valor of\r\n      Ali was signalized in single combat; and the war was protracted\r\n      twenty days, till the final separation of the confederates. A\r\n      tempest of wind, rain, and hail, overturned their tents: their\r\n      private quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary; and the\r\n      Koreish, deserted by their allies, no longer hoped to subvert the\r\n      throne, or to check the conquests, of their invincible exile. 134\r\n\r\n      128 (return) [ Al Jannabi (apud Gagnier, tom. ii. p. 9) allows\r\n      him seventy or eighty horse; and on two other occasions, prior to\r\n      the battle of Ohud, he enlists a body of thirty (p. 10) and of\r\n      500 (p. 66) troopers.

Their obstinacy converted his friendship into\r\n      implacable hatred, with which he pursued that unfortunate people\r\n      to the last moment of his life; and in the double character of an\r\n      apostle and a conqueror, his persecution was extended to both\r\n      worlds. 135 The Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the protection of\r\n      the city; he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult, and\r\n      summoned them to embrace his religion, or contend with him in\r\n      battle. “Alas!” replied the trembling Jews, “we are ignorant of\r\n      the use of arms, but we persevere in the faith and worship of our\r\n      fathers; why wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just\r\n      defence?” The unequal conflict was terminated in fifteen days;\r\n      and it was with extreme reluctance that Mahomet yielded to the\r\n      importunity of his allies, and consented to spare the lives of\r\n      the captives. But their riches were confiscated, their arms\r\n      became more effectual in the hands of the Mussulmans; and a\r\n      wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven, with their\r\n      wives and children, to implore a refuge on the confines of Syria.\r\n      The Nadhirites were more guilty, since they conspired, in a\r\n      friendly interview, to assassinate the prophet. He besieged their\r\n      castle, three miles from Medina; but their resolute defence\r\n      obtained an honorable capitulation; and the garrison, sounding\r\n      their trumpets and beating their drums, was permitted to depart\r\n      with the honors of war. The Jews had excited and joined the war\r\n      of the Koreish: no sooner had the nations retired from the ditch,\r\n      than Mahomet, without laying aside his armor, marched on the same\r\n      day to extirpate the hostile race of the children of Koraidha.\r\n      After a resistance of twenty-five days, they surrendered at\r\n      discretion. They trusted to the intercession of their old allies\r\n      of Medina; they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates\r\n      the feelings of humanity. A venerable elder, to whose judgment\r\n      they appealed, pronounced the sentence of their death; seven\r\n      hundred Jews were dragged in chains to the market-place of the\r\n      city; they descended alive into the grave prepared for their\r\n      execution and burial; and the apostle beheld with an inflexible\r\n      eye the slaughter of his helpless enemies. Their sheep and camels\r\n      were inherited by the Mussulmans: three hundred cuirasses, five\r\n      hundred pikes, a thousand lances, composed the most useful\r\n      portion of the spoil. Six days’ journey to the north-east of\r\n      Medina, the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of\r\n      the Jewish power in Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the\r\n      desert, was covered with plantations and cattle, and protected by\r\n      eight castles, some of which were esteemed of impregnable\r\n      strength. The forces of Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse\r\n      and fourteen hundred foot: in the succession of eight regular and\r\n      painful sieges they were exposed to danger, and fatigue, and\r\n      hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event. The\r\n      apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of Ali, on\r\n      whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps we may\r\n      believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven to\r\n      the chest by his irresistible cimeter; but we cannot praise the\r\n      modesty of romance, which represents him as tearing from its\r\n      hinges the gate of a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler\r\n      in his left hand. 136 After the reduction of the castles, the\r\n      town of Chaibar submitted to the yoke. The chief of the tribe was\r\n      tortured, in the presence of Mahomet, to force a confession of\r\n      his hidden treasure: the industry of the shepherds and husbandmen\r\n      was rewarded with a precarious toleration: they were permitted,\r\n      so long as it should please the conqueror, to improve their\r\n      patrimony, in equal shares, for his emolument and their own.\r\n      Under the reign of Omar, the Jews of Chaibar were transported to\r\n      Syria; and the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master;\r\n      that one and the true religion should be professed in his native\r\n      land of Arabia. 137\r\n\r\n      135 (return) [ The wars of Mahomet against the Jewish tribes of\r\n      Kainoka, the Nadhirites, Koraidha, and Chaibar, are related by\r\n      Abulfeda (p. 61, 71, 77, 87, &c.) and Gagnier, (tom. ii. p.\r\n      61-65, 107-112, 139-148, 268-294.)]\r\n\r\n      136 (return) [ Abu Rafe, the servant of Mahomet, is said to\r\n      affirm that he himself, and seven other men, afterwards tried,\r\n      without success, to move the same gate from the ground,\r\n      (Abulfeda, p. 90.) Abu Rafe was an eye-witness, but who will be\r\n      witness for Abu Rafe?]\r\n\r\n      137 (return) [ The banishment of the Jews is attested by Elmacin\r\n      (Hist. Saracen, p. 9) and the great Al Zabari, (Gagnier, tom. ii.\r\n      p. 285.) Yet Niebuhr (Description de l’Arabie, p. 324) believes\r\n      that the Jewish religion, and Karaite sect, are still professed\r\n      by the tribe of Chaibar; and that, in the plunder of the\r\n      caravans, the disciples of Moses are the confederates of those of\r\n      Mahomet.]\r\n\r\n      Five times each day the eyes of Mahomet were turned towards\r\n      Mecca, 138 and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful\r\n      motives to revisit, as a conqueror, the city and the temple from\r\n      whence he had been driven as an exile. The Caaba was present to\r\n      his waking and sleeping fancy: an idle dream was translated into\r\n      vision and prophecy; he unfurled the holy banner; and a rash\r\n      promise of success too hastily dropped from the lips of the\r\n      apostle. His march from Medina to Mecca displayed the peaceful\r\n      and solemn pomp of a pilgrimage: seventy camels, chosen and\r\n      bedecked for sacrifice, preceded the van; the sacred territory\r\n      was respected; and the captives were dismissed without ransom to\r\n      proclaim his clemency and devotion. But no sooner did Mahomet\r\n      descend into the plain, within a day’s journey of the city, than\r\n      he exclaimed, “They have clothed themselves with the skins of\r\n      tigers:” the numbers and resolution of the Koreish opposed his\r\n      progress; and the roving Arabs of the desert might desert or\r\n      betray a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil.\r\n      The intrepid fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician: he\r\n      waived in the treaty his title of apostle of God; concluded with\r\n      the Koreish and their allies a truce of ten years; engaged to\r\n      restore the fugitives of Mecca who should embrace his religion;\r\n      and stipulated only, for the ensuing year, the humble privilege\r\n      of entering the city as a friend, and of remaining three days to\r\n      accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage. A cloud of shame and\r\n      sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans, and their\r\n      disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who\r\n      had so often appealed to the evidence of success. The faith and\r\n      hope of the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca:\r\n      their swords were sheathed; 1381 seven times in the footsteps of\r\n      the apostle they encompassed the Caaba: the Koreish had retired\r\n      to the hills, and Mahomet, after the customary sacrifice,\r\n      evacuated the city on the fourth day. The people was edified by\r\n      his devotion; the hostile chiefs were awed, or divided, or\r\n      seduced; and both Kaled and Amrou, the future conquerors of Syria\r\n      and Egypt, most seasonably deserted the sinking cause of\r\n      idolatry. The power of Mahomet was increased by the submission of\r\n      the Arabian tribes; ten thousand soldiers were assembled for the\r\n      conquest of Mecca; and the idolaters, the weaker party, were\r\n      easily convicted of violating the truce. Enthusiasm and\r\n      discipline impelled the march, and preserved the secret till the\r\n      blaze of ten thousand fires proclaimed to the astonished Koreish\r\n      the design, the approach, and the irresistible force of the\r\n      enemy. The haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city,\r\n      admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in\r\n      review; observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a mighty\r\n      kingdom, and confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was\r\n      the apostle of the true God. The return of Marius and Scylla was\r\n      stained with the blood of the Romans: the revenge of Mahomet was\r\n      stimulated by religious zeal, and his injured followers were\r\n      eager to execute or to prevent the order of a massacre. Instead\r\n      of indulging their passions and his own, 139 the victorious exile\r\n      forgave the guilt, and united the factions, of Mecca. His troops,\r\n      in three divisions, marched into the city: eight-and-twenty of\r\n      the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled; eleven men and\r\n      six women were proscribed by the sentence of Mahomet; but he\r\n      blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the most\r\n      obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency\r\n      or contempt. The chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his\r\n      feet. “What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have\r\n      wronged?” “We confide in the generosity of our kinsman.” “And you\r\n      shall not confide in vain: begone! you are safe, you are free”\r\n      The people of Mecca deserved their pardon by the profession of\r\n      Islam; and after an exile of seven years, the fugitive missionary\r\n      was enthroned as the prince and prophet of his native country.\r\n      140 But the three hundred and sixty idols of the Caaba were\r\n      ignominiously broken: the house of God was purified and adorned:\r\n      as an example to future times, the apostle again fulfilled the\r\n      duties of a pilgrim; and a perpetual law was enacted that no\r\n      unbeliever should dare to set his foot on the territory of the\r\n      holy city. 141\r\n\r\n      138 (return) [ The successive steps of the reduction of Mecca are\r\n      related by Abulfeda (p. 84-87, 97-100, 102-111) and Gagnier,\r\n      (tom. ii. p. 202-245, 309-322, tom. iii. p. 1-58,) Elmacin,\r\n      (Hist.

The Christians are received without\r\n      scruple into the ports of Mocha, and even of Gedda; and it is\r\n      only the city and precincts of Mecca that are inaccessible to the\r\n      profane, (Niebuhr, Description de l’Arabie, p. 308, 309, Voyage\r\n      en Arabie, tom. i. p. 205, 248, &c.)]\r\n\r\n      The conquest of Mecca determined the faith and obedience of the\r\n      Arabian tribes; 142 who, according to the vicissitudes of\r\n      fortune, had obeyed, or disregarded, the eloquence or the arms of\r\n      the prophet. Indifference for rites and opinions still marks the\r\n      character of the Bedoweens; and they might accept, as loosely as\r\n      they hold, the doctrine of the Koran. Yet an obstinate remnant\r\n      still adhered to the religion and liberty of their ancestors, and\r\n      the war of Honain derived a proper appellation from the idols,\r\n      whom Mahomet had vowed to destroy, and whom the confederates of\r\n      Tayef had sworn to defend. 143 Four thousand Pagans advanced with\r\n      secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror: they pitied and\r\n      despised the supine negligence of the Koreish, but they depended\r\n      on the wishes, and perhaps the aid, of a people who had so lately\r\n      renounced their gods, and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy.\r\n      The banners of Medina and Mecca were displayed by the prophet; a\r\n      crowd of Bedoweens increased the strength or numbers of the army,\r\n      and twelve thousand Mussulmans entertained a rash and sinful\r\n      presumption of their invincible strength. They descended without\r\n      precaution into the valley of Honain: the heights had been\r\n      occupied by the archers and slingers of the confederates; their\r\n      numbers were oppressed, their discipline was confounded, their\r\n      courage was appalled, and the Koreish smiled at their impending\r\n      destruction. The prophet, on his white mule, was encompassed by\r\n      the enemies: he attempted to rush against their spears in search\r\n      of a glorious death: ten of his faithful companions interposed\r\n      their weapons and their breasts; three of these fell dead at his\r\n      feet: “O my brethren,” he repeatedly cried, with sorrow and\r\n      indignation, “I am the son of Abdallah, I am the apostle of\r\n      truth! O man, stand fast in the faith! O God, send down thy\r\n      succor!” His uncle Abbas, who, like the heroes of Homer, excelled\r\n      in the loudness of his voice, made the valley resound with the\r\n      recital of the gifts and promises of God: the flying Moslems\r\n      returned from all sides to the holy standard; and Mahomet\r\n      observed with pleasure that the furnace was again rekindled: his\r\n      conduct and example restored the battle, and he animated his\r\n      victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors\r\n      of their shame. From the field of Honain, he marched without\r\n      delay to the siege of Tayef, sixty miles to the south-east of\r\n      Mecca, a fortress of strength, whose fertile lands produce the\r\n      fruits of Syria in the midst of the Arabian desert. A friendly\r\n      tribe, instructed (I know not how) in the art of sieges, supplied\r\n      him with a train of battering-rams and military engines, with a\r\n      body of five hundred artificers. But it was in vain that he\r\n      offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef; that he violated his own\r\n      laws by the extirpation of the fruit-trees; that the ground was\r\n      opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the\r\n      troops. After a siege of twenty-days, the prophet sounded a\r\n      retreat; but he retreated with a song of devout triumph, and\r\n      affected to pray for the repentance and safety of the unbelieving\r\n      city. The spoils of this fortunate expedition amounted to six\r\n      thousand captives, twenty-four thousand camels, forty thousand\r\n      sheep, and four thousand ounces of silver: a tribe who had fought\r\n      at Hoinan redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice of their\r\n      idols; but Mahomet compensated the loss, by resigning to the\r\n      soldiers his fifth of the plunder, and wished, for their sake,\r\n      that he possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in\r\n      the province of Tehama. Instead of chastising the disaffection of\r\n      the Koreish, he endeavored to cut out their tongues, (his own\r\n      expression,) and to secure their attachment by a superior measure\r\n      of liberality: Abu Sophian alone was presented with three hundred\r\n      camels and twenty ounces of silver; and Mecca was sincerely\r\n      converted to the profitable religion of the Koran.\r\n\r\n      142 (return) [ Abulfeda, p. 112-115.

To your guard I intrust my life and fortunes.\r\n      You are the companions of my exile, of my kingdom, of my\r\n      paradise.” He was followed by the deputies of Tayef, who dreaded\r\n      the repetition of a siege. “Grant us, O apostle of God! a truce\r\n      of three years, with the toleration of our ancient worship.” “Not\r\n      a month, not an hour.” “Excuse us at least from the obligation of\r\n      prayer.” “Without prayer religion is of no avail.” They submitted\r\n      in silence: their temples were demolished, and the same sentence\r\n      of destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia. His\r\n      lieutenants, on the shores of the Red Sea, the Ocean, and the\r\n      Gulf of Persia, were saluted by the acclamations of a faithful\r\n      people; and the ambassadors, who knelt before the throne of\r\n      Medina, were as numerous (says the Arabian proverb) as the dates\r\n      that fall from the maturity of a palm-tree. The nation submitted\r\n      to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet: the opprobrious name of\r\n      tribute was abolished: the spontaneous or reluctant oblations of\r\n      arms and tithes were applied to the service of religion; and one\r\n      hundred and fourteen thousand Moslems accompanied the last\r\n      pilgrimage of the apostle. 144\r\n\r\n      144 (return) [ The last conquests and pilgrimage of Mahomet are\r\n      contained in Abulfeda, (p. 121, 133,) Gagnier, (tom. iii. p.\r\n      119-219,) Elmacin, (p. 10, 11,) Abulpharagius, (p. 103.)

The three leaders\r\n      were slain in the battle of Muta, 146 the first military action,\r\n      which tried the valor of the Moslems against a foreign enemy.\r\n      Zeid fell, like a soldier, in the foremost ranks: the death of\r\n      Jaafar was heroic and memorable: he lost his right hand: he\r\n      shifted the standard to his left: the left was severed from his\r\n      body: he embraced the standard with his bleeding stumps, till he\r\n      was transfixed to the ground with fifty honorable wounds. 1461\r\n      “Advance,” cried Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant place,\r\n      “advance with confidence: either victory or paradise is our own.”\r\n      The lance of a Roman decided the alternative; but the falling\r\n      standard was rescued by Caled, the proselyte of Mecca: nine\r\n      swords were broken in his hand; and his valor withstood and\r\n      repulsed the superior numbers of the Christians. In the nocturnal\r\n      council of the camp he was chosen to command: his skilful\r\n      evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the victory or the\r\n      retreat of the Saracens; and Caled is renowned among his brethren\r\n      and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of God.\r\n      In the pulpit, Mahomet described, with prophetic rapture, the\r\n      crowns of the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the\r\n      feelings of human nature: he was surprised as he wept over the\r\n      daughter of Zeid: “What do I see?” said the astonished votary.\r\n      “You see,” replied the apostle, “a friend who is deploring the\r\n      loss of his most faithful friend.” After the conquest of Mecca,\r\n      the sovereign of Arabia affected to prevent the hostile\r\n      preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly proclaimed war against\r\n      the Romans, without attempting to disguise the hardships and\r\n      dangers of the enterprise. 147 The Moslems were discouraged: they\r\n      alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions; the season\r\n      of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: “Hell is much\r\n      hotter,” said the indignant prophet. He disdained to compel their\r\n      service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an\r\n      excommunication of fifty days. Their desertion enhanced the merit\r\n      of Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted\r\n      their lives and fortunes; and Mahomet displayed his banner at the\r\n      head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Painful\r\n      indeed was the distress of the march: lassitude and thirst were\r\n      aggravated by the scorching and pestilential winds of the desert:\r\n      ten men rode by turns on one camel; and they were reduced to the\r\n      shameful necessity of drinking the water from the belly of that\r\n      useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days’ journey from Medina and\r\n      Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of Tabuc.\r\n      Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war: he\r\n      declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was\r\n      more probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the\r\n      East. But the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror\r\n      of his name; and the prophet received the submission of the\r\n      tribes and cities, from the Euphrates to Ailah, at the head of\r\n      the Red Sea. To his Christian subjects, Mahomet readily granted\r\n      the security of their persons, the freedom of their trade, the\r\n      property of their goods, and the toleration of their worship. 148\r\n      The weakness of their Arabian brethren had restrained them from\r\n      opposing his ambition; the disciples of Jesus were endeared to\r\n      the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest of a conqueror to\r\n      propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful religion of the\r\n      earth.\r\n\r\n      145 (return) [ Compare the bigoted Al Jannabi (apud Gagnier, tom.\r\n      ii. p. 232-255) with the no less bigoted Greeks, Theophanes, (p.\r\n      276-227,) Zonaras (tom. ii. l. xiv. p. 86,) and Cedrenus, (p.\r\n      421.)]\r\n\r\n      146 (return) [ For the battle of Muta, and its consequences, see\r\n      Abulfeda (p 100-102) and Gagnier, (tom. ii. p. 327-343.).]\r\n\r\n      1461 (return) [ To console the afflicted relatives of his kinsman\r\n      Jauffer, he (Mahomet) represented that, in Paradise, in exchange\r\n      for the arms which he had lost, he had been furnished with a pair\r\n      of wings, resplendent with the blushing glories of the ruby, and\r\n      with which he was become the inseparable companion of the\r\n      archangal Gabriel, in his volitations through the regions of\r\n      eternal bliss.

His\r\n      epileptic fits, an absurd calumny of the Greeks, would be an\r\n      object of pity rather than abhorrence; 149 but he seriously\r\n      believed that he was poisoned at Chaibar by the revenge of a\r\n      Jewish female. 150 During four years, the health of the prophet\r\n      declined; his infirmities increased; but his mortal disease was a\r\n      fever of fourteen days, which deprived him by intervals of the\r\n      use of reason. As soon as he was conscious of his danger, he\r\n      edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or penitence.\r\n      “If there be any man,” said the apostle from the pulpit, “whom I\r\n      have unjustly scourged, I submit my own back to the lash of\r\n      retaliation. Have I aspersed the reputation of a Mussulman? let\r\n      him proclaim my thoughts in the face of the congregation. Has any\r\n      one been despoiled of his goods? the little that I possess shall\r\n      compensate the principal and the interest of the debt.” “Yes,”\r\n      replied a voice from the crowd, “I am entitled to three drams of\r\n      silver.” Mahomet heard the complaint, satisfied the demand, and\r\n      thanked his creditor for accusing him in this world rather than\r\n      at the day of judgment. He beheld with temperate firmness the\r\n      approach of death; enfranchised his slaves (seventeen men, as\r\n      they are named, and eleven women;) minutely directed the order of\r\n      his funeral, and moderated the lamentations of his weeping\r\n      friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace. Till the\r\n      third day before his death, he regularly performed the function\r\n      of public prayer: the choice of Abubeker to supply his place,\r\n      appeared to mark that ancient and faithful friend as his\r\n      successor in the sacerdotal and regal office; but he prudently\r\n      declined the risk and envy of a more explicit nomination. At a\r\n      moment when his faculties were visibly impaired, he called for\r\n      pen and ink to write, or, more properly, to dictate, a divine\r\n      book, the sum and accomplishment of all his revelations: a\r\n      dispute arose in the chamber, whether he should be allowed to\r\n      supersede the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was forced\r\n      to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples. If the\r\n      slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives\r\n      and companions, he maintained, in the bosom of his family, and to\r\n      the last moments of his life, the dignity 1501 of an apostle, and\r\n      the faith of an enthusiast; described the visits of Gabriel, who\r\n      bade an everlasting farewell to the earth, and expressed his\r\n      lively confidence, not only of the mercy, but of the favor, of\r\n      the Supreme Being. In a familiar discourse he had mentioned his\r\n      special prerogative, that the angel of death was not allowed to\r\n      take his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of\r\n      the prophet. The request was granted; and Mahomet immediately\r\n      fell into the agony of his dissolution: his head was reclined on\r\n      the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of all his wives; he fainted\r\n      with the violence of pain; recovering his spirits, he raised his\r\n      eyes towards the roof of the house, and, with a steady look,\r\n      though a faltering voice, uttered the last broken, though\r\n      articulate, words: “O God!..... pardon my sins....... Yes, ......\r\n      I come,...... among my fellow-citizens on high;” and thus\r\n      peaceably expired on a carpet spread upon the floor. An\r\n      expedition for the conquest of Syria was stopped by this mournful\r\n      event; the army halted at the gates of Medina; the chiefs were\r\n      assembled round their dying master. The city, more especially the\r\n      house, of the prophet, was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent\r\n      despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray of hope and\r\n      consolation. “How can he be dead, our witness, our intercessor,\r\n      our mediator, with God? By God he is not dead: like Moses and\r\n      Jesus, he is wrapped in a holy trance, and speedily will he\r\n      return to his faithful people.” The evidence of sense was\r\n      disregarded; and Omar, unsheathing his cimeter, threatened to\r\n      strike off the heads of the infidels, who should dare to affirm\r\n      that the prophet was no more. The tumult was appeased by the\r\n      weight and moderation of Abubeker. “Is it Mahomet,” said he to\r\n      Omar and the multitude, “or the God of Mahomet, whom you worship?\r\n      The God of Mahomet liveth forever; but the apostle was a mortal\r\n      like ourselves, and according to his own prediction, he has\r\n      experienced the common fate of mortality.” He was piously\r\n      interred by the hands of his nearest kinsman, on the same spot on\r\n      which he expired: 151 Medina has been sanctified by the death and\r\n      burial of Mahomet; and the innumerable pilgrims of Mecca often\r\n      turn aside from the way, to bow, in voluntary devotion, 152\r\n      before the simple tomb of the prophet. 153\r\n\r\n      149 (return) [ The epilepsy, or falling-sickness, of Mahomet is\r\n      asserted by Theophanes, Zonaras, and the rest of the Greeks; and\r\n      is greedily swallowed by the gross bigotry of Hottinger, (Hist.\r\n      Orient. p. 10, 11,) Prideaux, (Life of Mahomet, p. 12,) and\r\n      Maracci, (tom. ii.

Had I been intimately\r\n      conversant with the son of Abdallah, the task would still be\r\n      difficult, and the success uncertain: at the distance of twelve\r\n      centuries, I darkly contemplate his shade through a cloud of\r\n      religious incense; and could I truly delineate the portrait of an\r\n      hour, the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply to the\r\n      solitary of Mount Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the\r\n      conqueror of Arabia. The author of a mighty revolution appears to\r\n      have been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition: so\r\n      soon as marriage had raised him above the pressure of want, he\r\n      avoided the paths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of\r\n      forty he lived with innocence, and would have died without a\r\n      name. The unity of God is an idea most congenial to nature and\r\n      reason; and a slight conversation with the Jews and Christians\r\n      would teach him to despise and detest the idolatry of Mecca. It\r\n      was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart the doctrine of\r\n      salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of sin and\r\n      error. The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object,\r\n      would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the\r\n      warm suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt\r\n      as the inspirations of Heaven; the labor of thought would expire\r\n      in rapture and vision; and the inward sensation, the invisible\r\n      monitor, would be described with the form and attributes of an\r\n      angel of God. 154 From enthusiasm to imposture, the step is\r\n      perilous and slippery: the daemon of Socrates 155 affords a\r\n      memorable instance, how a wise man may deceive himself, how a\r\n      good man may deceive others, how the conscience may slumber in a\r\n      mixed and middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud.\r\n      Charity may believe that the original motives of Mahomet were\r\n      those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human missionary is\r\n      incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his\r\n      claims despise his arguments, and persecute his life; he might\r\n      forgive his personal adversaries, he may lawfully hate the\r\n      enemies of God; the stern passions of pride and revenge were\r\n      kindled in the bosom of Mahomet, and he sighed, like the prophet\r\n      of Nineveh, for the destruction of the rebels whom he had\r\n      condemned. The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina,\r\n      transformed the citizen into a prince, the humble preacher into\r\n      the leader of armies; but his sword was consecrated by the\r\n      example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts a sinful\r\n      world with pestilence and earthquakes, might inspire for their\r\n      conversion or chastisement the valor of his servants. In the\r\n      exercise of political government, he was compelled to abate of\r\n      the stern rigor of fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the\r\n      prejudices and passions of his followers, and to employ even the\r\n      vices of mankind as the instruments of their salvation. The use\r\n      of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty and injustice, were often\r\n      subservient to the propagation of the faith; and Mahomet\r\n      commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters\r\n      who had escaped from the field of battle. By the repetition of\r\n      such acts, the character of Mahomet must have been gradually\r\n      stained; and the influence of such pernicious habits would be\r\n      poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social\r\n      virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a\r\n      prophet among his sectaries and friends. Of his last years,\r\n      ambition was the ruling passion; and a politician will suspect,\r\n      that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!) at the\r\n      enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his proselytes. 156\r\n      A philosopher will observe, that their credulity and his success\r\n      would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine\r\n      mission, that his interest and religion were inseparably\r\n      connected, and that his conscience would be soothed by the\r\n      persuasion, that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the\r\n      obligation of positive and moral laws. If he retained any vestige\r\n      of his native innocence, the sins of Mahomet may be allowed as an\r\n      evidence of his sincerity. In the support of truth, the arts of\r\n      fraud and fiction may be deemed less criminal; and he would have\r\n      started at the foulness of the means, had he not been satisfied\r\n      of the importance and justice of the end. Even in a conqueror or\r\n      a priest, I can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity;\r\n      and the decree of Mahomet, that, in the sale of captives, the\r\n      mothers should never be separated from their children, may\r\n      suspend, or moderate, the censure of the historian. 157\r\n\r\n      154 (return) [ The Christians, rashly enough, have assigned to\r\n      Mahomet a tame pigeon, that seemed to descend from heaven and\r\n      whisper in his ear.

Disdaining\r\n      the penance and merit of a hermit, he observed, without effort or\r\n      vanity, the abstemious diet of an Arab and a soldier. On solemn\r\n      occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and hospitable\r\n      plenty; but in his domestic life, many weeks would elapse without\r\n      a fire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet. The\r\n      interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example; his hunger was\r\n      appeased with a sparing allowance of barley-bread: he delighted\r\n      in the taste of milk and honey; but his ordinary food consisted\r\n      of dates and water. Perfumes and women were the two sensual\r\n      enjoyments which his nature required, and his religion did not\r\n      forbid; and Mahomet affirmed, that the fervor of his devotion was\r\n      increased by these innocent pleasures. The heat of the climate\r\n      inflames the blood of the Arabs; and their libidinous complexion\r\n      has been noticed by the writers of antiquity. 159 Their\r\n      incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the\r\n      Koran: their incestuous alliances were blamed; the boundless\r\n      license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate wives or\r\n      concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably\r\n      determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged, adultery was\r\n      condemned as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex,\r\n      was punished with a hundred stripes. 160 Such were the calm and\r\n      rational precepts of the legislator: but in his private conduct,\r\n      Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of\r\n      a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which\r\n      he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve,\r\n      was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative\r\n      excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather\r\n      than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans. If we remember the seven\r\n      hundred wives and three hundred concubines of the wise Solomon,\r\n      we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian, who espoused no more\r\n      than seventeen or fifteen wives; eleven are enumerated who\r\n      occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of\r\n      the apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favor of his conjugal\r\n      society. What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting\r\n      only Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker. She was doubtless a\r\n      virgin, since Mahomet consummated his nuptials (such is the\r\n      premature ripeness of the climate) when she was only nine years\r\n      of age. The youth, the beauty, the spirit of Ayesha, gave her a\r\n      superior ascendant: she was beloved and trusted by the prophet;\r\n      and, after his death, the daughter of Abubeker was long revered\r\n      as the mother of the faithful. Her behavior had been ambiguous\r\n      and indiscreet: in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left\r\n      behind; and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a\r\n      man. The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy; but a divine\r\n      revelation assured him of her innocence: he chastised her\r\n      accusers, and published a law of domestic peace, that no woman\r\n      should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in\r\n      the act of adultery. 161 In his adventures with Zeineb, the wife\r\n      of Zeid, and with Mary, an Egyptian captive, the amorous prophet\r\n      forgot the interest of his reputation. At the house of Zeid, his\r\n      freedman and adopted son, he beheld, in a loose undress, the\r\n      beauty of Zeineb, and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion\r\n      and desire. The servile, or grateful, freedman understood the\r\n      hint, and yielded without hesitation to the love of his\r\n      benefactor. But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and\r\n      scandal, the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the\r\n      deed, to annul the adoption, and gently to reprove the apostle\r\n      for distrusting the indulgence of his God. One of his wives,\r\n      Hafna, the daughter of Omar, surprised him on her own bed, in the\r\n      embraces of his Egyptian captive: she promised secrecy and\r\n      forgiveness, he swore that he would renounce the possession of\r\n      Mary. Both parties forgot their engagements; and Gabriel again\r\n      descended with a chapter of the Koran, to absolve him from his\r\n      oath, and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and\r\n      concubines, without listening to the clamors of his wives. In a\r\n      solitary retreat of thirty days, he labored, alone with Mary, to\r\n      fulfil the commands of the angel. When his love and revenge were\r\n      satiated, he summoned to his presence his eleven wives,\r\n      reproached their disobedience and indiscretion, and threatened\r\n      them with a sentence of divorce, both in this world and in the\r\n      next; a dreadful sentence, since those who had ascended the bed\r\n      of the prophet were forever excluded from the hope of a second\r\n      marriage. Perhaps the incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by\r\n      the tradition of his natural or preternatural gifts; 162 he\r\n      united the manly virtue of thirty of the children of Adam: and\r\n      the apostle might rival the thirteenth labor 163 of the Grecian\r\n      Hercules. 164 A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn from\r\n      his fidelity to Cadijah. During the twenty-four years of their\r\n      marriage, her youthful husband abstained from the right of\r\n      polygamy, and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was\r\n      never insulted by the society of a rival. After her death, he\r\n      placed her in the rank of the four perfect women, with the sister\r\n      of Moses, the mother of Jesus, and Fatima, the best beloved of\r\n      his daughters. “Was she not old?” said Ayesha, with the insolence\r\n      of a blooming beauty; “has not God given you a better in her\r\n      place?” “No, by God,” said Mahomet, with an effusion of honest\r\n      gratitude, “there never can be a better! She believed in me when\r\n      men despised me; she relieved my wants, when I was poor and\r\n      persecuted by the world.” 165\r\n\r\n      158 (return) [ For the domestic life of Mahomet, consult Gagnier,\r\n      and the corresponding chapters of Abulfeda; for his diet, (tom.\r\n      iii. p. 285-288;) his children, (p. 189, 289;) his wives, (p.\r\n      290-303;) his marriage with Zeineb, (tom. ii. p. 152-160;) his\r\n      amour with Mary, (p. 303-309;) the false accusation of Ayesha,\r\n      (p. 186-199.)

Yet we should weigh with caution\r\n      the traditions of the hostile sects; a stream which becomes still\r\n      more muddy as it flows farther from the source.

The son of Abu Taleb was, in his own\r\n      right, the chief of the family of Hashem, and the hereditary\r\n      prince or guardian of the city and temple of Mecca. The light of\r\n      prophecy was extinct; but the husband of Fatima might expect the\r\n      inheritance and blessing of her father: the Arabs had sometimes\r\n      been patient of a female reign; and the two grandsons of the\r\n      prophet had often been fondled in his lap, and shown in his\r\n      pulpit as the hope of his age, and the chief of the youth of\r\n      paradise. The first of the true believers might aspire to march\r\n      before them in this world and in the next; and if some were of a\r\n      graver and more rigid cast, the zeal and virtue of Ali were never\r\n      outstripped by any recent proselyte. He united the qualifications\r\n      of a poet, a soldier, and a saint: his wisdom still breathes in a\r\n      collection of moral and religious sayings; 167 and every\r\n      antagonist, in the combats of the tongue or of the sword, was\r\n      subdued by his eloquence and valor. From the first hour of his\r\n      mission to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle was never\r\n      forsaken by a generous friend, whom he delighted to name his\r\n      brother, his vicegerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second\r\n      Moses. The son of Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for\r\n      neglecting to secure his interest by a solemn declaration of his\r\n      right, which would have silenced all competition, and sealed his\r\n      succession by the decrees of Heaven. But the unsuspecting hero\r\n      confided in himself: the jealousy of empire, and perhaps the fear\r\n      of opposition, might suspend the resolutions of Mahomet; and the\r\n      bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha, the daughter\r\n      of Abubeker, and the enemy of Ali. 1671\r\n\r\n      167 (return) [ Ockley (at the end of his second volume) has given\r\n      an English version of 169 sentences, which he ascribes, with some\r\n      hesitation, to Ali, the son of Abu Taleb.

The\r\n      glory of Ali is the constant burden of their strain. He was\r\n      destined, and, according to some accounts, designated, for the\r\n      caliphate by the prophet; but while the others were fiercely\r\n      pushing their own interests, Ali was watching the remains of\r\n      Mahomet with pious fidelity. His disinterested magnanimity, on\r\n      each separate occasion, declined the sceptre, and gave the noble\r\n      example of obedience to the appointed caliph. He is described, in\r\n      retirement, on the throne, and in the field of battle, as\r\n      transcendently pious, magnanimous, valiant, and humane. He lost\r\n      his empire through his excess of virtue and love for the faithful\r\n      his life through his confidence in God, and submission to the\r\n      decrees of fate. Compare the curious account of this apathy in\r\n      Price, chapter ii. It is to be regretted, I must add, that Major\r\n      Price has contented himself with quoting the names of the Persian\r\n      works which he follows, without any account of their character,\r\n      age, and authority.—M.]\r\n\r\n      The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the\r\n      people; and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on\r\n      the choice of his successor. The hereditary claim and lofty\r\n      spirit of Ali were offensive to an aristocracy of elders,\r\n      desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and\r\n      frequent election: the Koreish could never be reconciled to the\r\n      proud preeminence of the line of Hashem; the ancient discord of\r\n      the tribes was rekindled, the fugitives of Mecca and the\r\n      auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits; and the\r\n      rash proposal of choosing two independent caliphs would have\r\n      crushed in their infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens.\r\n      The tumult was appeased by the disinterested resolution of Omar,\r\n      who, suddenly renouncing his own pretensions, stretched forth his\r\n      hand, and declared himself the first subject of the mild and\r\n      venerable Abubeker. 1672 The urgency of the moment, and the\r\n      acquiescence of the people, might excuse this illegal and\r\n      precipitate measure; but Omar himself confessed from the pulpit,\r\n      that if any Mulsulman should hereafter presume to anticipate the\r\n      suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and the elected would\r\n      be worthy of death. 168 After the simple inauguration of\r\n      Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of\r\n      Arabia: the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and\r\n      their chief, in his own house, maintained, above six months, a\r\n      sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats\r\n      of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the\r\n      daughter of the apostle. The death of Fatima, and the decline of\r\n      his party, subdued the indignant spirit of Ali: he condescended\r\n      to salute the commander of the faithful, accepted his excuse of\r\n      the necessity of preventing their common enemies, and wisely\r\n      rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the\r\n      Arabians. After a reign of two years, the aged caliph was\r\n      summoned by the angel of death. In his testament, with the tacit\r\n      approbation of his companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the\r\n      firm and intrepid virtue of Omar. “I have no occasion,” said the\r\n      modest candidate, “for the place.” “But the place has occasion\r\n      for you,” replied Abubeker; who expired with a fervent prayer,\r\n      that the God of Mahomet would ratify his choice, and direct the\r\n      Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience. The prayer was\r\n      not ineffectual, since Ali himself, in a life of privacy and\r\n      prayer, professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his\r\n      rival; who comforted him for the loss of empire, by the most\r\n      flattering marks of confidence and esteem. In the twelfth year of\r\n      his reign, Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an\r\n      assassin: he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his\r\n      son and of Ali, refused to load his conscience with the sins of\r\n      his successor, and devolved on six of the most respectable\r\n      companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the\r\n      faithful. On this occasion, Ali was again blamed by his friends\r\n      169 for submitting his right to the judgment of men, for\r\n      recognizing their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six\r\n      electors. He might have obtained their suffrage, had he deigned\r\n      to promise a strict and servile conformity, not only to the Koran\r\n      and tradition, but likewise to the determinations of two seniors.\r\n      170 With these limitations, Othman, the secretary of Mahomet,\r\n      accepted the government; nor was it till after the third caliph,\r\n      twenty-four years after the death of the prophet, that Ali was\r\n      invested, by the popular choice, with the regal and sacerdotal\r\n      office. The manners of the Arabians retained their primitive\r\n      simplicity, and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity\r\n      of this world. At the hour of prayer, he repaired to the mosch of\r\n      Medina, clothed in a thin cotton gown, a coarse turban on his\r\n      head, his slippers in one hand, and his bow in the other, instead\r\n      of a walking-staff. The companions of the prophet, and the chiefs\r\n      of the tribes, saluted their new sovereign, and gave him their\r\n      right hands as a sign of fealty and allegiance.\r\n\r\n      1672 (return) [ Abubeker, the father of the virgin Ayesha.

But they assign the last and most\r\n      humble place to the husband of Fatima, in the persuasion that the\r\n      order of succession was determined by the decrees of sanctity.\r\n      173 An historian who balances the four caliphs with a hand\r\n      unshaken by superstition, will calmly pronounce that their\r\n      manners were alike pure and exemplary; that their zeal was\r\n      fervent, and probably sincere; and that, in the midst of riches\r\n      and power, their lives were devoted to the practice of moral and\r\n      religious duties. But the public virtues of Abubeker and Omar,\r\n      the prudence of the first, the severity of the second, maintained\r\n      the peace and prosperity of their reigns. The feeble temper and\r\n      declining age of Othman were incapable of sustaining the weight\r\n      of conquest and empire. He chose, and he was deceived; he\r\n      trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of the faithful\r\n      became useless or hostile to his government, and his lavish\r\n      bounty was productive only of ingratitude and discontent. The\r\n      spirit of discord went forth in the provinces: their deputies\r\n      assembled at Medina; and the Charegites, the desperate fanatics\r\n      who disclaimed the yoke of subordination and reason, were\r\n      confounded among the free-born Arabs, who demanded the redress of\r\n      their wrongs and the punishment of their oppressors. From Cufa,\r\n      from Bassora, from Egypt, from the tribes of the desert, they\r\n      rose in arms, encamped about a league from Medina, and despatched\r\n      a haughty mandate to their sovereign, requiring him to execute\r\n      justice, or to descend from the throne. His repentance began to\r\n      disarm and disperse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled\r\n      by the arts of his enemies; and the forgery of a perfidious\r\n      secretary was contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate\r\n      his fall. The caliph had lost the only guard of his predecessors,\r\n      the esteem and confidence of the Moslems: during a siege of six\r\n      weeks his water and provisions were intercepted, and the feeble\r\n      gates of the palace were protected only by the scruples of the\r\n      more timorous rebels. Forsaken by those who had abused his\r\n      simplicity, the hopeless and venerable caliph expected the\r\n      approach of death: the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of\r\n      the assassins; and Othman, with the Koran in his lap, was pierced\r\n      with a multitude of wounds. 1731 A tumultuous anarchy of five\r\n      days was appeased by the inauguration of Ali: his refusal would\r\n      have provoked a general massacre. In this painful situation he\r\n      supported the becoming pride of the chief of the Hashemites;\r\n      declared that he had rather serve than reign; rebuked the\r\n      presumption of the strangers; and required the formal, if not the\r\n      voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation. He has never been\r\n      accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia\r\n      indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr. The\r\n      quarrel between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early\r\n      mediation of Ali; and Hassan, the eldest of his sons, was\r\n      insulted and wounded in the defence of the caliph. Yet it is\r\n      doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere\r\n      in his opposition to the rebels; and it is certain that he\r\n      enjoyed the benefit of their crime. The temptation was indeed of\r\n      such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate\r\n      virtue. The ambitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren\r\n      sceptre of Arabia; the Saracens had been victorious in the East\r\n      and West; and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and Egypt\r\n      were the patrimony of the commander of the faithful.\r\n\r\n      171 (return) [ The schism of the Persians is explained by all our\r\n      travellers of the last century, especially in the iid and ivth\r\n      volumes of their master, Chardin.

They escaped from Medina to Mecca, and from\r\n      thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt; and usurped\r\n      the government of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly\r\n      solicited as the reward of their services. The mask of patriotism\r\n      is allowed to cover the most glaring inconsistencies; and the\r\n      enemies, perhaps the assassins, of Othman now demanded vengeance\r\n      for his blood. They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha,\r\n      the widow of the prophet, who cherished, to the last hour of her\r\n      life, an implacable hatred against the husband and the posterity\r\n      of Fatima. The most reasonable Moslems were scandalized, that the\r\n      mother of the faithful should expose in a camp her person and\r\n      character; 1733 but the superstitious crowd was confident that\r\n      her presence would sanctify the justice, and assure the success,\r\n      of their cause. At the head of twenty thousand of his loyal\r\n      Arabs, and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of Cufa, the caliph\r\n      encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the rebels under\r\n      the walls of Bassora. 1734 Their leaders, Telha and Zobeir, 1735\r\n      were slain in the first battle that stained with civil blood the\r\n      arms of the Moslems. 1736 After passing through the ranks to\r\n      animate the troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers\r\n      of the field. In the heat of the action, seventy men, who held\r\n      the bridle of her camel, were successively killed or wounded; and\r\n      the cage or litter, in which she sat, was stuck with javelins and\r\n      darts like the quills of a porcupine. The venerable captive\r\n      sustained with firmness the reproaches of the conqueror, and was\r\n      speedily dismissed to her proper station at the tomb of Mahomet,\r\n      with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow\r\n      of the apostle. 1737 After this victory, which was styled the Day\r\n      of the Camel, Ali marched against a more formidable adversary;\r\n      against Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, who had assumed the\r\n      title of caliph, and whose claim was supported by the forces of\r\n      Syria and the interest of the house of Ommiyah. From the passage\r\n      of Thapsacus, the plain of Siffin 174 extends along the western\r\n      bank of the Euphrates. On this spacious and level theatre, the\r\n      two competitors waged a desultory war of one hundred and ten\r\n      days. In the course of ninety actions or skirmishes, the loss of\r\n      Ali was estimated at twenty-five, that of Moawiyah at forty-five,\r\n      thousand soldiers; and the list of the slain was dignified with\r\n      the names of five-and-twenty veterans who had fought at Beder\r\n      under the standard of Mahomet. In this sanguinary contest the\r\n      lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valor and\r\n      humanity. 1741 His troops were strictly enjoined to await the\r\n      first onset of the enemy, to spare their flying brethren, and to\r\n      respect the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female\r\n      captives. He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems\r\n      by a single combat; but his trembling rival declined the\r\n      challenge as a sentence of inevitable death. The ranks of the\r\n      Syrians were broken by the charge of a hero who was mounted on a\r\n      piebald horse, and wielded with irresistible force his ponderous\r\n      and two-edged sword. As often as he smote a rebel, he shouted the\r\n      Allah Acbar, “God is victorious!” and in the tumult of a\r\n      nocturnal battle, he was heard to repeat four hundred times that\r\n      tremendous exclamation. The prince of Damascus already meditated\r\n      his flight; but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp\r\n      of Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops. Their\r\n      conscience was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the\r\n      Koran which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost lances; and Ali was\r\n      compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an insidious\r\n      compromise. He retreated with sorrow and indignation to Cufa; his\r\n      party was discouraged; the distant provinces of Persia, of Yemen,\r\n      and of Egypt, were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival; and\r\n      the stroke of fanaticism, which was aimed against the three\r\n      chiefs of the nation, was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet. In\r\n      the temple of Mecca, three Charegites or enthusiasts discoursed\r\n      of the disorders of the church and state: they soon agreed, that\r\n      the deaths of Ali, of Moawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the\r\n      viceroy of Egypt, would restore the peace and unity of religion.\r\n      Each of the assassins chose his victim, poisoned his dagger,\r\n      devoted his life, and secretly repaired to the scene of action.\r\n      Their resolution was equally desperate: but the first mistook the\r\n      person of Amrou, and stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat;\r\n      the prince of Damascus was dangerously hurt by the second; the\r\n      lawful caliph, in the mosch of Cufa, received a mortal wound from\r\n      the hand of the third. He expired in the sixty-third year of his\r\n      age, and mercifully recommended to his children, that they would\r\n      despatch the murderer by a single stroke. 1742 The sepulchre of\r\n      Ali 175 was concealed from the tyrants of the house of Ommiyah;\r\n      176 but in the fourth age of the Hegira, a tomb, a temple, a\r\n      city, arose near the ruins of Cufa. 177 Many thousands of the\r\n      Shiites repose in holy ground at the feet of the vicar of God;\r\n      and the desert is vivified by the numerous and annual visits of\r\n      the Persians, who esteem their devotion not less meritorious than\r\n      the pilgrimage of Mecca.\r\n\r\n      1732 (return) [ Ali had determined to supersede all the\r\n      lieutenants in the different provinces.

After\r\n      some debate, Moawiyah determined to avail himself of the\r\n      advantage of his situation, and to reject the demand of Ali.

The opposition of Abu Sophian had\r\n      been fierce and obstinate; his conversion was tardy and\r\n      reluctant; his new faith was fortified by necessity and interest;\r\n      he served, he fought, perhaps he believed; and the sins of the\r\n      time of ignorance were expiated by the recent merits of the\r\n      family of Ommiyah. Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, and of the\r\n      cruel Henda, was dignified, in his early youth, with the office\r\n      or title of secretary of the prophet: the judgment of Omar\r\n      intrusted him with the government of Syria; and he administered\r\n      that important province above forty years, either in a\r\n      subordinate or supreme rank. Without renouncing the fame of valor\r\n      and liberality, he affected the reputation of humanity and\r\n      moderation: a grateful people was attached to their benefactor;\r\n      and the victorious Moslems were enriched with the spoils of\r\n      Cyprus and Rhodes. The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of\r\n      Othman was the engine and pretence of his ambition. The bloody\r\n      shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damascus: the\r\n      emir deplored the fate of his injured kinsman; and sixty thousand\r\n      Syrians were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity and\r\n      revenge. Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt, himself an army, was the\r\n      first who saluted the new monarch, and divulged the dangerous\r\n      secret, that the Arabian caliphs might be created elsewhere than\r\n      in the city of the prophet. 178 The policy of Moawiyah eluded the\r\n      valor of his rival; and, after the death of Ali, he negotiated\r\n      the abdication of his son Hassan, whose mind was either above or\r\n      below the government of the world, and who retired without a sigh\r\n      from the palace of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his\r\n      grandfather. The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally\r\n      crowned by the important change of an elective to an hereditary\r\n      kingdom. Some murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the\r\n      reluctance of the Arabs, and four citizens of Medina refused the\r\n      oath of fidelity; but the designs of Moawiyah were conducted with\r\n      vigor and address; and his son Yezid, a feeble and dissolute\r\n      youth, was proclaimed as the commander of the faithful and the\r\n      successor of the apostle of God.\r\n\r\n      178 (return) [ I borrow, on this occasion, the strong sense and\r\n      expression of Tacitus, (Hist. i. 4: ) Evulgato imperii arcano\r\n      posse imperatorem alni quam Romae fieri.]\r\n\r\n      A familiar story is related of the benevolence of one of the sons\r\n      of Ali. In serving at table, a slave had inadvertently dropped a\r\n      dish of scalding broth on his master: the heedless wretch fell\r\n      prostrate, to deprecate his punishment, and repeated a verse of\r\n      the Koran: “Paradise is for those who command their anger: “—“I\r\n      am not angry: “—“and for those who pardon offences: “—“I pardon\r\n      your offence: “—“and for those who return good for evil: “—”I\r\n      give you your liberty and four hundred pieces of silver.” With an\r\n      equal measure of piety, Hosein, the younger brother of Hassan,\r\n      inherited a remnant of his father’s spirit, and served with honor\r\n      against the Christians in the siege of Constantinople. The\r\n      primogeniture of the line of Hashem, and the holy character of\r\n      grandson of the apostle, had centred in his person, and he was at\r\n      liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid, the tyrant of\r\n      Damascus, whose vices he despised, and whose title he had never\r\n      deigned to acknowledge. A list was secretly transmitted from Cufa\r\n      to Medina, of one hundred and forty thousand Moslems, who\r\n      professed their attachment to his cause, and who were eager to\r\n      draw their swords so soon as he should appear on the banks of the\r\n      Euphrates. Against the advice of his wisest friends, he resolved\r\n      to trust his person and family in the hands of a perfidious\r\n      people. He traversed the desert of Arabia with a timorous retinue\r\n      of women and children; but as he approached the confines of Irak\r\n      he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country,\r\n      and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party. His\r\n      fears were just: Obeidollah, the governor of Cufa, had\r\n      extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection; and Hosein, in\r\n      the plain of Kerbela, was encompassed by a body of five thousand\r\n      horse, who intercepted his communication with the city and the\r\n      river. He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert,\r\n      that had defied the power of Caesar and Chosroes, and confided in\r\n      the fidelity of the tribe of Tai, which would have armed ten\r\n      thousand warriors in his defence.\r\n\r\n      In a conference with the chief of the enemy, he proposed the\r\n      option of three honorable conditions: that he should be allowed\r\n      to return to Medina, or be stationed in a frontier garrison\r\n      against the Turks, or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid.\r\n      But the commands of the caliph, or his lieutenant, were stern and\r\n      absolute; and Hosein was informed that he must either submit as a\r\n      captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful, or\r\n      expect the consequences of his rebellion. “Do you think,” replied\r\n      he, “to terrify me with death?” And, during the short respite of\r\n      a night, 1781 he prepared with calm and solemn resignation to\r\n      encounter his fate. He checked the lamentations of his sister\r\n      Fatima, who deplored the impending ruin of his house. “Our\r\n      trust,” said Hosein, “is in God alone. All things, both in heaven\r\n      and earth, must perish and return to their Creator. My brother,\r\n      my father, my mother, were better than me, and every Mussulman\r\n      has an example in the prophet.” He pressed his friends to consult\r\n      their safety by a timely flight: they unanimously refused to\r\n      desert or survive their beloved master: and their courage was\r\n      fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise. On\r\n      the morning of the fatal day, he mounted on horseback, with his\r\n      sword in one hand and the Koran in the other: his generous band\r\n      of martyrs consisted only of thirty-two horse and forty foot; but\r\n      their flanks and rear were secured by the tent-ropes, and by a\r\n      deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots, according\r\n      to the practice of the Arabs. The enemy advanced with reluctance,\r\n      and one of their chiefs deserted, with thirty followers, to claim\r\n      the partnership of inevitable death. In every close onset, or\r\n      single combat, the despair of the Fatimites was invincible; but\r\n      the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a\r\n      cloud of arrows, and the horses and men were successively slain;\r\n      a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer; and the\r\n      battle at length expired by the death of the last companions of\r\n      Hosein. Alone, weary, and wounded, he seated himself at the door\r\n      of his tent. As he tasted a drop of water, he was pierced in the\r\n      mouth with a dart; and his son and nephew, two beautiful youths,\r\n      were killed in his arms. He lifted his hands to heaven; they were\r\n      full of blood; and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and\r\n      the dead. In a transport of despair his sister issued from the\r\n      tent, and adjured the general of the Cufians, that he would not\r\n      suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes: a tear trickled\r\n      down his venerable beard; and the boldest of his soldiers fell\r\n      back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them.\r\n      The remorseless Shamer, a name detested by the faithful,\r\n      reproached their cowardice; and the grandson of Mahomet was slain\r\n      with three-and-thirty strokes of lances and swords. After they\r\n      had trampled on his body, they carried his head to the castle of\r\n      Cufa, and the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a\r\n      cane: “Alas,” exclaimed an aged Mussulman, “on these lips have I\r\n      seen the lips of the apostle of God!” In a distant age and\r\n      climate, the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the\r\n      sympathy of the coldest reader. 179 1791 On the annual festival\r\n      of his martyrdom, in the devout pilgrimage to his sepulchre, his\r\n      Persian votaries abandon their souls to the religious frenzy of\r\n      sorrow and indignation. 180\r\n\r\n      1781 (return) [ According to Major Price’s authorities a much\r\n      longer time elapsed (p. 198 &c.)—M.]\r\n\r\n      179 (return) [ I have abridged the interesting narrative of\r\n      Ockley, (tom. ii. p. 170-231.)

His family,\r\n      after his defenders were all slain, perished in succession before\r\n      his eyes. They had been cut off from the water, and suffered all\r\n      the agonies of thirst. His eldest son, Ally Akbar, after ten\r\n      different assaults on the enemy, in each of which he slew two or\r\n      three, complained bitterly of his sufferings from heat and\r\n      thirst. “His father arose, and introducing his own tongue within\r\n      the parched lips of his favorite child, thus endeavored to\r\n      alleviate his sufferings by the only means of which his enemies\r\n      had not yet been able to deprive him.” Ally was slain and cut to\r\n      pieces in his sight: this wrung from him his first and only cry;\r\n      then it was that his sister Zeyneb rushed from the tent. The\r\n      rest, including his nephew, fell in succession. Hosein’s horse\r\n      was wounded—he fell to the ground. The hour of prayer, between\r\n      noon and sunset, had arrived; the Imaun began the religious\r\n      duties:—as Hosein prayed, he heard the cries of his infant child\r\n      Abdallah, only twelve months old. The child was, at his desire,\r\n      placed on his bosom: as he wept over it, it was transfixed by an\r\n      arrow. Hosein dragged himself to the Euphrates: as he slaked his\r\n      burning thirst, his mouth was pierced by an arrow: he drank his\r\n      own blood. Wounded in four-and-thirty places, he still gallantly\r\n      resisted. A soldier named Zeraiah gave the fatal wound: his head\r\n      was cut off by Ziliousheng.

The two sepulchres\r\n      are in the hands of the Turks, who tolerate and tax the devotion\r\n      of the Persian heretics. The festival of the death of Hosein is\r\n      amply described by Sir John Chardin, a traveller whom I have\r\n      often praised.]\r\n\r\n      When the sisters and children of Ali were brought in chains to\r\n      the throne of Damascus, the caliph was advised to extirpate the\r\n      enmity of a popular and hostile race, whom he had injured beyond\r\n      the hope of reconciliation. But Yezid preferred the councils of\r\n      mercy; and the mourning family was honorably dismissed to mingle\r\n      their tears with their kindred at Medina. The glory of martyrdom\r\n      superseded the right of primogeniture; and the twelve imams, 181\r\n      or pontiffs, of the Persian creed, are Ali, Hassan, Hosein, and\r\n      the lineal descendants of Hosein to the ninth generation. Without\r\n      arms, or treasures, or subjects, they successively enjoyed the\r\n      veneration of the people, and provoked the jealousy of the\r\n      reigning caliphs: their tombs, at Mecca or Medina, on the banks\r\n      of the Euphrates, or in the province of Chorasan, are still\r\n      visited by the devotion of their sect. Their names were often the\r\n      pretence of sedition and civil war; but these royal saints\r\n      despised the pomp of the world: submitted to the will of God and\r\n      the injustice of man; and devoted their innocent lives to the\r\n      study and practice of religion. The twelfth and last of the\r\n      Imams, conspicuous by the title of Mahadi, or the Guide,\r\n      surpassed the solitude and sanctity of his predecessors. He\r\n      concealed himself in a cavern near Bagdad: the time and place of\r\n      his death are unknown; and his votaries pretend that he still\r\n      lives, and will appear before the day of judgment to overthrow\r\n      the tyranny of Dejal, or the Antichrist. 182 In the lapse of two\r\n      or three centuries, the posterity of Abbas, the uncle of Mahomet,\r\n      had multiplied to the number of thirty-three thousand: 183 the\r\n      race of Ali might be equally prolific: the meanest individual was\r\n      above the first and greatest of princes; and the most eminent\r\n      were supposed to excel the perfection of angels. But their\r\n      adverse fortune, and the wide extent of the Mussulman empire,\r\n      allowed an ample scope for every bold and artful imposture, who\r\n      claimed affinity with the holy seed: the sceptre of the\r\n      Almohades, in Spain and Africa; of the Fatimites, in Egypt and\r\n      Syria; 184 of the Sultans of Yemen; and of the Sophis of Persia;\r\n      185 has been consecrated by this vague and ambiguous title. Under\r\n      their reigns it might be dangerous to dispute the legitimacy of\r\n      their birth; and one of the Fatimite caliphs silenced an\r\n      indiscreet question by drawing his cimeter: “This,” said Moez,\r\n      “is my pedigree; and these,” casting a handful of gold to his\r\n      soldiers,—“and these are my kindred and my children.” In the\r\n      various conditions of princes, or doctors, or nobles, or\r\n      merchants, or beggars, a swarm of the genuine or fictitious\r\n      descendants of Mahomet and Ali is honored with the appellation of\r\n      sheiks, or sherifs, or emirs. In the Ottoman empire they are\r\n      distinguished by a green turban; receive a stipend from the\r\n      treasury; are judged only by their chief; and, however debased by\r\n      fortune or character, still assert the proud preeminence of their\r\n      birth. A family of three hundred persons, the pure and orthodox\r\n      branch of the caliph Hassan, is preserved without taint or\r\n      suspicion in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and still\r\n      retains, after the revolutions of twelve centuries, the custody\r\n      of the temple, and the sovereignty of their native land. The fame\r\n      and merit of Mahomet would ennoble a plebeian race, and the\r\n      ancient blood of the Koreish transcends the recent majesty of the\r\n      kings of the earth. 186\r\n\r\n      181 (return) [ The general article of Imam, in D’Herbelot’s\r\n      Bibliotheque, will indicate the succession; and the lives of the\r\n      twelve are given under their respective names.]\r\n\r\n      182 (return) [ The name of Antichrist may seem ridiculous, but\r\n      the Mahometans have liberally borrowed the fables of every\r\n      religion, (Sale’s Preliminary Discourse, p. 80, 82.)

It is much to be lamented, that the Danish\r\n      traveller was unable to purchase the chronicles of Arabia.]\r\n\r\n      The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our applause; but his\r\n      success has, perhaps, too strongly attracted our admiration. Are\r\n      we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the\r\n      doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the heresies\r\n      of the church, the same seduction has been tried and repeated\r\n      from the time of the apostles to that of the reformers. Does it\r\n      seem incredible that a private citizen should grasp the sword and\r\n      the sceptre, subdue his native country, and erect a monarchy by\r\n      his victorious arms? In the moving picture of the dynasties of\r\n      the East, a hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser\r\n      origin, surmounted more formidable obstacles, and filled a larger\r\n      scope of empire and conquest. Mahomet was alike instructed to\r\n      preach and to fight; and the union of these opposite qualities,\r\n      while it enhanced his merit, contributed to his success: the\r\n      operation of force and persuasion, of enthusiasm and fear,\r\n      continually acted on each other, till every barrier yielded to\r\n      their irresistible power. His voice invited the Arabs to freedom\r\n      and victory, to arms and rapine, to the indulgence of their\r\n      darling passions in this world and the other: the restraints\r\n      which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of the\r\n      prophet, and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the\r\n      only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity\r\n      and perfections of God. It is not the propagation, but the\r\n      permanency, of his religion, that deserves our wonder: the same\r\n      pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and\r\n      Medina, is preserved, after the revolutions of twelve centuries,\r\n      by the Indian, the African, and the Turkish proselytes of the\r\n      Koran. If the Christian apostles, St. Peter or St. Paul, could\r\n      return to the Vatican, they might possibly inquire the name of\r\n      the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that\r\n      magnificent temple: at Oxford or Geneva, they would experience\r\n      less surprise; but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse\r\n      the catechism of the church, and to study the orthodox\r\n      commentators on their own writings and the words of their Master.\r\n      But the Turkish dome of St. Sophia, with an increase of splendor\r\n      and size, represents the humble tabernacle erected at Medina by\r\n      the hands of Mahomet. The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the\r\n      temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to\r\n      a level with the senses and imagination of man. “I believe in one\r\n      God, and Mahomet the apostle of God,” is the simple and\r\n      invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the\r\n      Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honors of\r\n      the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue;\r\n      and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his\r\n      disciples within the bounds of reason and religion. The votaries\r\n      of Ali have, indeed, consecrated the memory of their hero, his\r\n      wife, and his children; and some of the Persian doctors pretend\r\n      that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams;\r\n      but their superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites;\r\n      and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning against the\r\n      worship of saints and martyrs. The metaphysical questions on the\r\n      attributes of God, and the liberty of man, have been agitated in\r\n      the schools of the Mahometans, as well as in those of the\r\n      Christians; but among the former they have never engaged the\r\n      passions of the people, or disturbed the tranquillity of the\r\n      state. The cause of this important difference may be found in the\r\n      separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters. It\r\n      was the interest of the caliphs, the successors of the prophet\r\n      and commanders of the faithful, to repress and discourage all\r\n      religious innovations: the order, the discipline, the temporal\r\n      and spiritual ambition of the clergy, are unknown to the Moslems;\r\n      and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and\r\n      the oracles of their faith. From the Atlantic to the Ganges, the\r\n      Koran is acknowledged as the fundamental code, not only of\r\n      theology, but of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and the laws\r\n      which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are\r\n      guarded by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of\r\n      God. This religious servitude is attended with some practical\r\n      disadvantage; the illiterate legislator had been often misled by\r\n      his own prejudices and those of his country; and the institutions\r\n      of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the wealth and\r\n      numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these occasions, the\r\n      Cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and\r\n      substitutes a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the\r\n      principles of equity, and the manners and policy of the times.\r\n\r\n      His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is\r\n      the last consideration in the character of Mahomet. The most\r\n      bitter or most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will\r\n      surely allow that he assumed a false commission to inculcate a\r\n      salutary doctrine, less perfect only than their own. He piously\r\n      supposed, as the basis of his religion, the truth and sanctity of\r\n      their prior revolutions, the virtues and miracles of their\r\n      founders. The idols of Arabia were broken before the throne of\r\n      God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer, and\r\n      fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and\r\n      his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the\r\n      images most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation.\r\n      Mahomet was, perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and\r\n      political system for the use of his countrymen: but he breathed\r\n      among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship;\r\n      recommended the practice of the social virtues; and checked, by\r\n      his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge, and the oppression\r\n      of widows and orphans. The hostile tribes were united in faith\r\n      and obedience, and the valor which had been idly spent in\r\n      domestic quarrels was vigorously directed against a foreign\r\n      enemy. Had the impulse been less powerful, Arabia, free at home\r\n      and formidable abroad, might have flourished under a succession\r\n      of her native monarchs. Her sovereignty was lost by the extent\r\n      and rapidity of conquest. The colonies of the nation were\r\n      scattered over the East and West, and their blood was mingled\r\n      with the blood of their converts and captives. After the reign of\r\n      three caliphs, the throne was transported from Medina to the\r\n      valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris; the holy cities\r\n      were violated by impious war; Arabia was ruled by the rod of a\r\n      subject, perhaps of a stranger; and the Bedoweens of the desert,\r\n      awakening from their dream of dominion, resumed their old and\r\n      solitary independence. 187\r\n\r\n      187 (return) [ The writers of the Modern Universal History (vols.\r\n      i. and ii.) have compiled, in 850 folio pages, the life of\r\n      Mahomet and the annals of the caliphs.

A small and faithful band of his primitive disciples\r\n      had listened to his eloquence, and shared his distress; had fled\r\n      with the apostle from the persecution of Mecca, or had received\r\n      the fugitive in the walls of Medina. The increasing myriads, who\r\n      acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet, had been\r\n      compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity. The\r\n      polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and\r\n      invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the\r\n      yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator. The habits of faith\r\n      and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the\r\n      new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of\r\n      Moses, or the rites and mysteries of the Catholic church; or the\r\n      idols, the sacrifices, the joyous festivals, of their Pagan\r\n      ancestors. The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the\r\n      Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and\r\n      subordination; and the Barbarians were impatient of the mildest\r\n      and most salutary laws that curbed their passions, or violated\r\n      their customs. They submitted with reluctance to the religious\r\n      precepts of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the\r\n      Ramadan, and the daily repetition of five prayers; and the alms\r\n      and tithes, which were collected for the treasury of Medina,\r\n      could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a\r\n      perpetual and ignominious tribute. The example of Mahomet had\r\n      excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture, and several of his\r\n      rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy the authority,\r\n      of the living prophet. At the head of the fugitives and\r\n      auxiliaries, the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca,\r\n      Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored\r\n      the idols of the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a\r\n      seasonable reproof. “Ye men of Mecca, will ye be the last to\r\n      embrace, and the first to abandon, the religion of Islam?” After\r\n      exhorting the Moslems to confide in the aid of God and his\r\n      apostle, Abubeker resolved, by a vigorous attack, to prevent the\r\n      junction of the rebels. The women and children were safely lodged\r\n      in the cavities of the mountains: the warriors, marching under\r\n      eleven banners, diffused the terror of their arms; and the\r\n      appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the loyalty\r\n      of the faithful. The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble\r\n      repentance, the duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and,\r\n      after some examples of success and severity, the most daring\r\n      apostates fell prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of\r\n      Caled. In the fertile province of Yemanah, 1 between the Red Sea\r\n      and the Gulf of Persia, in a city not inferior to Medina itself,\r\n      a powerful chief (his name was Moseilama) had assumed the\r\n      character of a prophet, and the tribe of Hanifa listened to his\r\n      voice. A female prophetess 1111 was attracted by his reputation;\r\n      the decencies of words and actions were spurned by these\r\n      favorites of Heaven; 2 and they employed several days in mystic\r\n      and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his Koran, or book,\r\n      is yet extant; 3 and in the pride of his mission, Moseilama\r\n      condescended to offer a partition of the earth. The proposal was\r\n      answered by Mahomet with contempt; but the rapid progress of the\r\n      impostor awakened the fears of his successor: forty thousand\r\n      Moslems were assembled under the standard of Caled; and the\r\n      existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive\r\n      battle. 3111 In the first action they were repulsed by the loss\r\n      of twelve hundred men; but the skill and perseverance of their\r\n      general prevailed; their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of\r\n      ten thousand infidels; and Moseilama himself was pierced by an\r\n      Aethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded\r\n      the uncle of Mahomet. The various rebels of Arabia without a\r\n      chief or a cause, were speedily suppressed by the power and\r\n      discipline of the rising monarchy; and the whole nation again\r\n      professed, and more steadfastly held, the religion of the Koran.\r\n      The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exercise for\r\n      the restless spirit of the Saracens: their valor was united in\r\n      the prosecution of a holy war; and their enthusiasm was equally\r\n      confirmed by opposition and victory.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ See the description of the city and country of Al\r\n      Yamanah, in Abulfeda, Descript.

The courage of Abubeker, 4 Omar, 5\r\n      and Othman, 6 had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars\r\n      of the prophet; and the personal assurance of paradise must have\r\n      taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present\r\n      world. But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age;\r\n      and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most\r\n      important duties of a sovereign. Except the presence of Omar at\r\n      the siege of Jerusalem, their longest expeditions were the\r\n      frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca; and they calmly\r\n      received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before\r\n      the sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of\r\n      their lives was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of\r\n      their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of\r\n      the earth. When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph, he\r\n      enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict account of his\r\n      private patrimony, that it might be evident whether he were\r\n      enriched or impoverished by the service of the state. He thought\r\n      himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold, with the\r\n      sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave; but\r\n      on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his own\r\n      and the public money, first to the most worthy, and then to the\r\n      most indigent, of the Moslems. The remains of his wealth, a\r\n      coarse garment, and five pieces of gold, were delivered to his\r\n      successor, who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to\r\n      equal such an admirable model. Yet the abstinence and humility of\r\n      Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker: his food\r\n      consisted of barley bread or dates; his drink was water; he\r\n      preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places;\r\n      and the Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror,\r\n      found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of\r\n      Medina. Oeeconomy is the source of liberality, and the increase\r\n      of the revenue enabled Omar to establish a just and perpetual\r\n      reward for the past and present services of the faithful.\r\n      Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to Abbas, the uncle of\r\n      the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of twenty-five\r\n      thousand drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand were allotted\r\n      to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder;\r\n      and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was\r\n      distinguished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One\r\n      thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the\r\n      first battles against the Greeks and Persians; and the decreasing\r\n      pay, as low as fifty pieces of silver, was adapted to the\r\n      respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar. Under his\r\n      reign, and that of his predecessor, the conquerors of the East\r\n      were the trusty servants of God and the people; the mass of the\r\n      public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war;\r\n      a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline\r\n      of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the\r\n      despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal\r\n      maxims of a republican government. The heroic courage of Ali, 7\r\n      the consummate prudence of Moawiyah, 8 excited the emulation of\r\n      their subjects; and the talents which had been exercised in the\r\n      school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate\r\n      the faith and dominion of the prophet. In the sloth and vanity of\r\n      the palace of Damascus, the succeeding princes of the house of\r\n      Ommiyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen\r\n      and of saints. 9 Yet the spoils of unknown nations were\r\n      continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the uniform\r\n      ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of\r\n      the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs. A large\r\n      deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies. The\r\n      birth of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate\r\n      and disorderly period of the Persians, the Romans, and the\r\n      Barbarians of Europe: the empires of Trajan, or even of\r\n      Constantine or Charlemagne, would have repelled the assault of\r\n      the naked Saracens, and the torrent of fanaticism might have been\r\n      obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.\r\n\r\n      311 (return) [ In Arabic, “successors.” V.

These timid maxims of\r\n      policy were disdained by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the\r\n      Arabian caliphs. With the same vigor and success they invaded the\r\n      successors of Augustus and those of Artaxerxes; and the rival\r\n      monarchies at the same instant became the prey of an enemy whom\r\n      they had been so long accustomed to despise. In the ten years of\r\n      the administration of Omar, the Saracens reduced to his obedience\r\n      thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thousand\r\n      churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen\r\n      hundred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet.

In the first year of the first caliph, his lieutenant Caled,\r\n      the Sword of God, and the scourge of the infidels, advanced to\r\n      the banks of the Euphrates, and reduced the cities of Anbar and\r\n      Hira. Westward of the ruins of Babylon, a tribe of sedentary\r\n      Arabs had fixed themselves on the verge of the desert; and Hira\r\n      was the seat of a race of kings who had embraced the Christian\r\n      religion, and reigned above six hundred years under the shadow of\r\n      the throne of Persia. 16 The last of the Mondars 1611 was\r\n      defeated and slain by Caled; his son was sent a captive to\r\n      Medina; his nobles bowed before the successor of the prophet; the\r\n      people was tempted by the example and success of their\r\n      countrymen; and the caliph accepted as the first-fruits of\r\n      foreign conquest an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of\r\n      gold. The conquerors, and even their historians, were astonished\r\n      by the dawn of their future greatness: “In the same year,” says\r\n      Elmacin, “Caled fought many signal battles: an immense multitude\r\n      of the infidels was slaughtered; and spoils infinite and\r\n      innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems.” 17 But the\r\n      invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war: the\r\n      invasion of the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or\r\n      less prudent commanders: the Saracens were repulsed with loss in\r\n      the passage of the Euphrates; and, though they chastised the\r\n      insolent pursuit of the Magians, their remaining forces still\r\n      hovered in the desert of Babylon. 1711\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Pocock will explain the chronology, (Specimen Hist.\r\n      Arabum, p. 66-74,) and D’Anville the geography, (l’Euphrate, et\r\n      le Tigre, p. 125,) of the dynasty of the Almondars.

By the unanimous sentence of the\r\n      priests and nobles, their queen Arzema was deposed; the sixth of\r\n      the transient usurpers, who had arisen and vanished in three or\r\n      four years since the death of Chosroes, and the retreat of\r\n      Heraclius. Her tiara was placed on the head of Yezdegerd, the\r\n      grandson of Chosroes; and the same aera, which coincides with an\r\n      astronomical period, 18 has recorded the fall of the Sassanian\r\n      dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster. 19 The youth and\r\n      inexperience of the prince (he was only fifteen years of age)\r\n      declined a perilous encounter: the royal standard was delivered\r\n      into the hands of his general Rustam; and a remnant of thirty\r\n      thousand regular troops was swelled in truth, or in opinion, to\r\n      one hundred and twenty thousand subjects, or allies, of the great\r\n      king. The Moslems, whose numbers were reenforced from twelve to\r\n      thirty thousand, had pitched their camp in the plains of Cadesia:\r\n      20 and their line, though it consisted of fewer men, could\r\n      produce more soldiers, than the unwieldy host of the infidels. I\r\n      shall here observe, what I must often repeat, that the charge of\r\n      the Arabs was not, like that of the Greeks and Romans, the effort\r\n      of a firm and compact infantry: their military force was chiefly\r\n      formed of cavalry and archers; and the engagement, which was\r\n      often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying\r\n      skirmishes, might be protracted without any decisive event to the\r\n      continuance of several days. The periods of the battle of Cadesia\r\n      were distinguished by their peculiar appellations. The first,\r\n      from the well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian\r\n      brethren, was denominated the day of succor. The day of\r\n      concussion might express the disorder of one, or perhaps of both,\r\n      of the contending armies. The third, a nocturnal tumult, received\r\n      the whimsical name of the night of barking, from the discordant\r\n      clamors, which were compared to the inarticulate sounds of the\r\n      fiercest animals. The morning of the succeeding day 2011\r\n      determined the fate of Persia; and a seasonable whirlwind drove a\r\n      cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers. The clangor\r\n      of arms was reechoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far unlike the\r\n      ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool and\r\n      tranquil shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of\r\n      mules that were laden with gold and silver. On the sound of\r\n      danger he started from his couch; but his flight was overtaken by\r\n      a valiant Arab, who caught him by the foot, struck off his head,\r\n      hoisted it on a lance, and instantly returning to the field of\r\n      battle, carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest ranks of\r\n      the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss of seven thousand five\r\n      hundred men; 2012 and the battle of Cadesia is justly described\r\n      by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. 21 The standard of\r\n      the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field—a leathern\r\n      apron of a blacksmith, who in ancient times had arisen the\r\n      deliverer of Persia; but this badge of heroic poverty was\r\n      disguised, and almost concealed, by a profusion of precious gems.\r\n      22 After this victory, the wealthy province of Irak, or Assyria,\r\n      submitted to the caliph, and his conquests were firmly\r\n      established by the speedy foundation of Bassora, 23 a place which\r\n      ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians. As the\r\n      distance of fourscore miles from the Gulf, the Euphrates and\r\n      Tigris unite in a broad and direct current, which is aptly styled\r\n      the river of the Arabs. In the midway, between the junction and\r\n      the mouth of these famous streams, the new settlement was planted\r\n      on the western bank: the first colony was composed of eight\r\n      hundred Moslems; but the influence of the situation soon reared a\r\n      flourishing and populous capital. The air, though excessively\r\n      hot, is pure and healthy: the meadows are filled with palm-trees\r\n      and cattle; and one of the adjacent valleys has been celebrated\r\n      among the four paradises or gardens of Asia.

But the flying Persians\r\n      were overcome by the belief, that the last day of their religion\r\n      and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were abandoned by\r\n      treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his family\r\n      and treasures, escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills.\r\n\r\n      In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of\r\n      Omar, passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken\r\n      by assault; and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a\r\n      keener edge to the sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with\r\n      religious transport, “This is the white palace of Chosroes; this\r\n      is the promise of the apostle of God!” The naked robbers of the\r\n      desert were suddenly enriched beyond the measure of their hope or\r\n      knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new treasure secreted with\r\n      art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and silver, the\r\n      various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says\r\n      Abulfeda) the estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian\r\n      defines the untold and almost infinite mass, by the fabulous\r\n      computation of three thousands of thousands of thousands of\r\n      pieces of gold. 24 Some minute though curious facts represent the\r\n      contrast of riches and ignorance. From the remote islands of the\r\n      Indian Ocean a large provision of camphire 25 had been imported,\r\n      which is employed with a mixture of wax to illuminate the palaces\r\n      of the East. Strangers to the name and properties of that\r\n      odoriferous gum, the Saracens, mistaking it for salt, mingled the\r\n      camphire in their bread, and were astonished at the bitterness of\r\n      the taste. One of the apartments of the palace was decorated with\r\n      a carpet of silk, sixty cubits in length, and as many in breadth:\r\n      a paradise or garden was depictured on the ground: the flowers,\r\n      fruits, and shrubs, were imitated by the figures of the gold\r\n      embroidery, and the colors of the precious stones; and the ample\r\n      square was encircled by a variegated and verdant border. 251 The\r\n      Arabian general persuaded his soldiers to relinquish their claim,\r\n      in the reasonable hope that the eyes of the caliph would be\r\n      delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature and industry.\r\n      Regardless of the merit of art, and the pomp of royalty, the\r\n      rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren of Medina: the\r\n      picture was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value of the\r\n      materials, that the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty\r\n      thousand drams. A mule that carried away the tiara and cuirass,\r\n      the belt and bracelets of Chosroes, was overtaken by the\r\n      pursuers; the gorgeous trophy was presented to the commander of\r\n      the faithful; and the gravest of the companions condescended to\r\n      smile when they beheld the white beard, the hairy arms, and\r\n      uncouth figure of the veteran, who was invested with the spoils\r\n      of the Great King. 26 The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by its\r\n      desertion and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and\r\n      situation of the place, and Omar was advised by his general to\r\n      remove the seat of government to the western side of the\r\n      Euphrates. In every age, the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian\r\n      cities has been easy and rapid: the country is destitute of stone\r\n      and timber; and the most solid structures 27 are composed of\r\n      bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement of the native\r\n      bitumen. The name of Cufa 28 describes a habitation of reeds and\r\n      earth; but the importance of the new capital was supported by the\r\n      numbers, wealth, and spirit, of a colony of veterans; and their\r\n      licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were\r\n      apprehensive of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand\r\n      swords: “Ye men of Cufa,” said Ali, who solicited their aid, “you\r\n      have been always conspicuous by your valor. You conquered the\r\n      Persian king, and scattered his forces, till you had taken\r\n      possession of his inheritance.” This mighty conquest was achieved\r\n      by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend. After the loss of the\r\n      former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed his shame and\r\n      despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus had\r\n      descended with his equal and valiant companions. The courage of\r\n      the nation survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the\r\n      south of Ecbatana or Hamadan, one hundred and fifty thousand\r\n      Persians made a third and final stand for their religion and\r\n      country; and the decisive battle of Nehavend was styled by the\r\n      Arabs the victory of victories. If it be true that the flying\r\n      general of the Persians was stopped and overtaken in a crowd of\r\n      mules and camels laden with honey, the incident, however slight\r\n      and singular, will denote the luxurious impediments of an\r\n      Oriental army. 29\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ Mente vix potest numerove comprehendi quanta spolia\r\n      nostris cesserint.

By the reduction of\r\n      Hamadan and Ispahan, of Caswin, Tauris, and Rei, they gradually\r\n      approached the shores of the Caspian Sea: and the orators of\r\n      Mecca might applaud the success and spirit of the faithful, who\r\n      had already lost sight of the northern bear, and had almost\r\n      transcended the bounds of the habitable world. 30 Again, turning\r\n      towards the West and the Roman empire, they repassed the Tigris\r\n      over the bridge of Mosul, and, in the captive provinces of\r\n      Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced their victorious brethren of\r\n      the Syrian army. From the palace of Madayn their Eastern progress\r\n      was not less rapid or extensive. They advanced along the Tigris\r\n      and the Gulf; penetrated through the passes of the mountains into\r\n      the valley of Estachar or Persepolis, and profaned the last\r\n      sanctuary of the Magian empire. The grandson of Chosroes was\r\n      nearly surprised among the falling columns and mutilated figures;\r\n      a sad emblem of the past and present fortune of Persia: 31 he\r\n      fled with accelerated haste over the desert of Kirman, implored\r\n      the aid of the warlike Segestans, and sought an humble refuge on\r\n      the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power. But a victorious army\r\n      is insensible of fatigue: the Arabs divided their forces in the\r\n      pursuit of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the\r\n      government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that\r\n      large and populous country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians.\r\n      The condition was accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard\r\n      of Mahomet was planted on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balch;\r\n      and the successful leader neither halted nor reposed till his\r\n      foaming cavalry had tasted the waters of the Oxus. In the public\r\n      anarchy, the independent governors of the cities and castles\r\n      obtained their separate capitulations: the terms were granted or\r\n      imposed by the esteem, the prudence, or the compassion, of the\r\n      victors; and a simple profession of faith established the\r\n      distinction between a brother and a slave. After a noble defence,\r\n      Harmozan, the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled\r\n      to surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the\r\n      caliph; and their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian\r\n      manners. In the presence, and by the command, of Omar, the gay\r\n      Barbarian was despoiled of his silken robes embroidered with\r\n      gold, and of his tiara bedecked with rubies and emeralds: “Are\r\n      you now sensible,” said the conqueror to his naked captive—“are\r\n      you now sensible of the judgment of God, and of the different\r\n      rewards of infidelity and obedience?” “Alas!” replied Harmozan,\r\n      “I feel them too deeply. In the days of our common ignorance, we\r\n      fought with the weapons of the flesh, and my nation was superior.\r\n      God was then neuter: since he has espoused your quarrel, you have\r\n      subverted our kingdom and religion.” Oppressed by this painful\r\n      dialogue, the Persian complained of intolerable thirst, but\r\n      discovered some apprehension lest he should be killed whilst he\r\n      was drinking a cup of water. “Be of good courage,” said the\r\n      caliph; “your life is safe till you have drunk this water:” the\r\n      crafty satrap accepted the assurance, and instantly dashed the\r\n      vase against the ground. Omar would have avenged the deceit, but\r\n      his companions represented the sanctity of an oath; and the\r\n      speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a free\r\n      pardon, but even to a stipend of two thousand pieces of gold. The\r\n      administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of the\r\n      people, the cattle, and the fruits of the earth; 32 and this\r\n      monument, which attests the vigilance of the caliphs, might have\r\n      instructed the philosophers of every age. 33\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ It is in such a style of ignorance and wonder that\r\n      the Athenian orator describes the Arctic conquests of Alexander,\r\n      who never advanced beyond the shores of the Caspian.

He was hospitably entertained by Takhan, prince of Fargana,\r\n      35 a fertile province on the Jaxartes: the king of Samarcand,\r\n      with the Turkish tribes of Sogdiana and Scythia, were moved by\r\n      the lamentations and promises of the fallen monarch; and he\r\n      solicited, by a suppliant embassy, the more solid and powerful\r\n      friendship of the emperor of China. 36 The virtuous Taitsong, 37\r\n      the first of the dynasty of the Tang may be justly compared with\r\n      the Antonines of Rome: his people enjoyed the blessings of\r\n      prosperity and peace; and his dominion was acknowledged by\r\n      forty-four hordes of the Barbarians of Tartary. His last\r\n      garrisons of Cashgar and Khoten maintained a frequent intercourse\r\n      with their neighbors of the Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony of\r\n      Persians had introduced into China the astronomy of the Magi; and\r\n      Taitsong might be alarmed by the rapid progress and dangerous\r\n      vicinity of the Arabs. The influence, and perhaps the supplies,\r\n      of China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd and the zeal of the\r\n      worshippers of fire; and he returned with an army of Turks to\r\n      conquer the inheritance of his fathers. The fortunate Moslems,\r\n      without unsheathing their swords, were the spectators of his ruin\r\n      and death. The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his servant,\r\n      insulted by the seditious inhabitants of Merou, and oppressed,\r\n      defeated, and pursued by his Barbarian allies. He reached the\r\n      banks of a river, and offered his rings and bracelets for an\r\n      instant passage in a miller’s boat. Ignorant or insensible of\r\n      royal distress, the rustic replied, that four drams of silver\r\n      were the daily profit of his mill, and that he would not suspend\r\n      his work unless the loss were repaid. In this moment of\r\n      hesitation and delay, the last of the Sassanian kings was\r\n      overtaken and slaughtered by the Turkish cavalry, in the\r\n      nineteenth year of his unhappy reign. 38 3811 His son Firuz, an\r\n      humble client of the Chinese emperor, accepted the station of\r\n      captain of his guards; and the Magian worship was long preserved\r\n      by a colony of loyal exiles in the province of Bucharia. 3812 His\r\n      grandson inherited the regal name; but after a faint and\r\n      fruitless enterprise, he returned to China, and ended his days in\r\n      the palace of Sigan. The male line of the Sassanides was extinct;\r\n      but the female captives, the daughters of Persia, were given to\r\n      the conquerors in servitude, or marriage; and the race of the\r\n      caliphs and imams was ennobled by the blood of their royal\r\n      mothers. 39\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ The most authentic accounts of the two rivers, the\r\n      Sihon (Jaxartes) and the Gihon, (Oxus,) may be found in Sherif al\r\n      Edrisi (Geograph.

While one of his\r\n      colleagues displayed the first Mahometan banner on the banks of\r\n      the Indus, the spacious regions between the Oxus, the Jaxartes,\r\n      and the Caspian Sea, were reduced by the arms of Catibah to the\r\n      obedience of the prophet and of the caliph. 42 A tribute of two\r\n      millions of pieces of gold was imposed on the infidels; their\r\n      idols were burnt or broken; the Mussulman chief pronounced a\r\n      sermon in the new mosch of Carizme; after several battles, the\r\n      Turkish hordes were driven back to the desert; and the emperors\r\n      of China solicited the friendship of the victorious Arabs.

No sooner had Abubeker restored the unity of faith and\r\n      government, than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian\r\n      tribes. “In the name of the most merciful God, to the rest of the\r\n      true believers. Health and happiness, and the mercy and blessing\r\n      of God, be upon you. I praise the most high God, and I pray for\r\n      his prophet Mahomet. This is to acquaint you, that I intend to\r\n      send the true believers into Syria 44 to take it out of the hands\r\n      of the infidels. And I would have you know, that the fighting for\r\n      religion is an act of obedience to God.” His messengers returned\r\n      with the tidings of pious and martial ardor which they had\r\n      kindled in every province; and the camp of Medina was\r\n      successively filled with the intrepid bands of the Saracens, who\r\n      panted for action, complained of the heat of the season and the\r\n      scarcity of provisions, and accused with impatient murmurs the\r\n      delays of the caliph. As soon as their numbers were complete,\r\n      Abubeker ascended the hill, reviewed the men, the horses, and the\r\n      arms, and poured forth a fervent prayer for the success of their\r\n      undertaking. In person, and on foot, he accompanied the first\r\n      day’s march; and when the blushing leaders attempted to dismount,\r\n      the caliph removed their scruples by a declaration, that those\r\n      who rode, and those who walked, in the service of religion, were\r\n      equally meritorious. His instructions 45 to the chiefs of the\r\n      Syrian army were inspired by the warlike fanaticism which\r\n      advances to seize, and affects to despise, the objects of earthly\r\n      ambition. “Remember,” said the successor of the prophet, “that\r\n      you are always in the presence of God, on the verge of death, in\r\n      the assurance of judgment, and the hope of paradise. Avoid\r\n      injustice and oppression; consult with your brethren, and study\r\n      to preserve the love and confidence of your troops. When you\r\n      fight the battles of the Lord, acquit yourselves like men,\r\n      without turning your backs; but let not your victory be stained\r\n      with the blood of women or children. Destroy no palm-trees, nor\r\n      burn any fields of corn. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any\r\n      mischief to cattle, only such as you kill to eat. When you make\r\n      any covenant or article, stand to it, and be as good as your\r\n      word. As you go on, you will find some religious persons who live\r\n      retired in monasteries, and propose to themselves to serve God\r\n      that way: let them alone, and neither kill them nor destroy their\r\n      monasteries: 46 And you will find another sort of people, that\r\n      belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have shaven crowns; 47 be\r\n      sure you cleave their skulls, and give them no quarter till they\r\n      either turn Mahometans or pay tribute.” All profane or frivolous\r\n      conversation, all dangerous recollection of ancient quarrels, was\r\n      severely prohibited among the Arabs: in the tumult of a camp, the\r\n      exercises of religion were assiduously practised; and the\r\n      intervals of action were employed in prayer, meditation, and the\r\n      study of the Koran. The abuse, or even the use, of wine was\r\n      chastised by fourscore strokes on the soles of the feet, and in\r\n      the fervor of their primitive zeal, many secret sinners revealed\r\n      their fault, and solicited their punishment. After some\r\n      hesitation, the command of the Syrian army was delegated to Abu\r\n      Obeidah, one of the fugitives of Mecca, and companions of\r\n      Mahomet; whose zeal and devotion was assuaged, without being\r\n      abated, by the singular mildness and benevolence of his temper.\r\n      But in all the emergencies of war, the soldiers demanded the\r\n      superior genius of Caled; and whoever might be the choice of the\r\n      prince, the Sword of God was both in fact and fame the foremost\r\n      leader of the Saracens. He obeyed without reluctance; 4711 he was\r\n      consulted without jealousy; and such was the spirit of the man,\r\n      or rather of the times, that Caled professed his readiness to\r\n      serve under the banner of the faith, though it were in the hands\r\n      of a child or an enemy. Glory, and riches, and dominion, were\r\n      indeed promised to the victorious Mussulman; but he was carefully\r\n      instructed, that if the goods of this life were his only\r\n      incitement, they likewise would be his only reward.\r\n\r\n      44 (return) [ A separate history of the conquest of Syria has\r\n      been composed by Al Wakidi, cadi of Bagdad, who was born A.D.\r\n      748, and died A.D. 822; he likewise wrote the conquest of Egypt,\r\n      of Diarbekir, &c.

The country\r\n      was enriched by the various benefits of trade; by the vigilance\r\n      of the emperors it was covered with a line of forts; and the\r\n      populous cities of Gerasa, Philadelphia, and Bosra, were secure,\r\n      at least from a surprise, by the solid structure of their walls.\r\n      The last of these cities was the eighteenth station from Medina:\r\n      the road was familiar to the caravans of Hejaz and Irak, who\r\n      annually visited this plenteous market of the province and the\r\n      desert: the perpetual jealousy of the Arabs had trained the\r\n      inhabitants to arms; and twelve thousand horse could sally from\r\n      the gates of Bosra, an appellation which signifies, in the Syriac\r\n      language, a strong tower of defence. Encouraged by their first\r\n      success against the open towns and flying parties of the borders,\r\n      a detachment of four thousand Moslems presumed to summon and\r\n      attack the fortress of Bosra. They were oppressed by the numbers\r\n      of the Syrians; they were saved by the presence of Caled, with\r\n      fifteen hundred horse: he blamed the enterprise, restored the\r\n      battle, and rescued his friend, the venerable Serjabil, who had\r\n      vainly invoked the unity of God and the promises of the apostle.\r\n      After a short repose, the Moslems performed their ablutions with\r\n      sand instead of water; and the morning prayer was recited by\r\n      Caled before they mounted on horseback. Confident in their\r\n      strength, the people of Bosra threw open their gates, drew their\r\n      forces into the plain, and swore to die in the defence of their\r\n      religion. But a religion of peace was incapable of withstanding\r\n      the fanatic cry of “Fight, fight! Paradise, paradise!” that\r\n      reechoed in the ranks of the Saracens; and the uproar of the\r\n      town, the ringing of bells, and the exclamations of the priests\r\n      and monks increased the dismay and disorder of the Christians.\r\n      With the loss of two hundred and thirty men, the Arabs remained\r\n      masters of the field; and the ramparts of Bosra, in expectation\r\n      of human or divine aid, were crowded with holy crosses and\r\n      consecrated banners. The governor Romanus had recommended an\r\n      early submission: despised by the people, and degraded from his\r\n      office, he still retained the desire and opportunity of revenge.\r\n      In a nocturnal interview, he informed the enemy of a\r\n      subterraneous passage from his house under the wall of the city;\r\n      the son of the caliph, with a hundred volunteers, were committed\r\n      to the faith of this new ally, and their successful intrepidity\r\n      gave an easy entrance to their companions. After Caled had\r\n      imposed the terms of servitude and tribute, the apostate or\r\n      convert avowed in the assembly of the people his meritorious\r\n      treason: “I renounce your society,” said Romanus, “both in this\r\n      world and the world to come. And I deny him that was crucified,\r\n      and whosoever worships him. And I choose God for my Lord, Islam\r\n      for my faith, Mecca for my temple, the Moslems for my brethren,\r\n      and Mahomet for my prophet; who was sent to lead us into the\r\n      right way, and to exalt the true religion in spite of those who\r\n      join partners with God.”\r\n\r\n      The conquest of Bosra, four days’ journey from Damascus,\r\n      encouraged the Arabs to besiege the ancient capital of Syria. At\r\n      some distance from the walls, they encamped among the groves and\r\n      fountains of that delicious territory, and the usual option of\r\n      the Mahometan faith, of tribute or of war, was proposed to the\r\n      resolute citizens, who had been lately strengthened by a\r\n      reenforcement of five thousand Greeks. In the decline, as in the\r\n      infancy, of the military art, a hostile defiance was frequently\r\n      offered and accepted by the generals themselves: many a lance was\r\n      shivered in the plain of Damascus, and the personal prowess of\r\n      Caled was signalized in the first sally of the besieged. After an\r\n      obstinate combat, he had overthrown and made prisoner one of the\r\n      Christian leaders, a stout and worthy antagonist. He instantly\r\n      mounted a fresh horse, the gift of the governor of Palmyra, and\r\n      pushed forwards to the front of the battle. “Repose yourself for\r\n      a moment,” said his friend Derar, “and permit me to supply your\r\n      place: you are fatigued with fighting with this dog.” “O Dear!”\r\n      replied the indefatigable Saracen, “we shall rest in the world to\r\n      come. He that labors to-day shall rest to-morrow.” With the same\r\n      unabated ardor, Caled answered, encountered, and vanquished a\r\n      second champion; and the heads of his two captives who refused to\r\n      abandon their religion were indignantly hurled into the midst of\r\n      the city. The event of some general and partial actions reduced\r\n      the Damascenes to a closer defence: but a messenger, whom they\r\n      dropped from the walls, returned with the promise of speedy and\r\n      powerful succor, and their tumultuous joy conveyed the\r\n      intelligence to the camp of the Arabs. After some debate, it was\r\n      resolved by the generals to raise, or rather to suspend, the\r\n      siege of Damascus, till they had given battle to the forces of\r\n      the emperor. In the retreat, Caled would have chosen the more\r\n      perilous station of the rear-guard; he modestly yielded to the\r\n      wishes of Abu Obeidah. But in the hour of danger he flew to the\r\n      rescue of his companion, who was rudely pressed by a sally of six\r\n      thousand horse and ten thousand foot, and few among the\r\n      Christians could relate at Damascus the circumstances of their\r\n      defeat. The importance of the contest required the junction of\r\n      the Saracens, who were dispersed on the frontiers of Syria and\r\n      Palestine; and I shall transcribe one of the circular mandates\r\n      which was addressed to Amrou, the future conqueror of Egypt. “In\r\n      the name of the most merciful God: from Caled to Amrou, health\r\n      and happiness. Know that thy brethren the Moslems design to march\r\n      to Aiznadin, where there is an army of seventy thousand Greeks,\r\n      who purpose to come against us, _that they may extinguish the\r\n      light of God with their mouths; but God preserveth his light in\r\n      spite of the infidels_. As soon therefore as this letter of mine\r\n      shall be delivered to thy hands, come with those that are with\r\n      thee to Aiznadin, where thou shalt find us if it please the most\r\n      high God.” The summons was cheerfully obeyed, and the forty-five\r\n      thousand Moslems, who met on the same day, on the same spot\r\n      ascribed to the blessing of Providence the effects of their\r\n      activity and zeal.\r\n\r\n      About four years after the triumph of the Persian war, the repose\r\n      of Heraclius and the empire was again disturbed by a new enemy,\r\n      the power of whose religion was more strongly felt, than it was\r\n      clearly understood, by the Christians of the East. In his palace\r\n      of Constantinople or Antioch, he was awakened by the invasion of\r\n      Syria, the loss of Bosra, and the danger of Damascus. An army of\r\n      seventy thousand veterans, or new levies, was assembled at Hems\r\n      or Emesa, under the command of his general Werdan: and these\r\n      troops consisting chiefly of cavalry, might be indifferently\r\n      styled either Syrians, or Greeks, or Romans: _Syrians_, from the\r\n      place of their birth or warfare; _Greeks_ from the religion and\r\n      language of their sovereign; and _Romans_, from the proud\r\n      appellation which was still profaned by the successors of\r\n      Constantine. On the plain of Aiznadin, as Werdan rode on a white\r\n      mule decorated with gold chains, and surrounded with ensigns and\r\n      standards, he was surprised by the near approach of a fierce and\r\n      naked warrior, who had undertaken to view the state of the enemy.\r\n      The adventurous valor of Derar was inspired, and has perhaps been\r\n      adorned, by the enthusiasm of his age and country. The hatred of\r\n      the Christians, the love of spoil, and the contempt of danger,\r\n      were the ruling passions of the audacious Saracen; and the\r\n      prospect of instant death could never shake his religious\r\n      confidence, or ruffle the calmness of his resolution, or even\r\n      suspend the frank and martial pleasantry of his humor. In the\r\n      most hopeless enterprises, he was bold, and prudent, and\r\n      fortunate: after innumerable hazards, after being thrice a\r\n      prisoner in the hands of the infidels, he still survived to\r\n      relate the achievements, and to enjoy the rewards, of the Syrian\r\n      conquest. On this occasion, his single lance maintained a flying\r\n      fight against thirty Romans, who were detached by Werdan; and,\r\n      after killing or unhorsing seventeen of their number, Derar\r\n      returned in safety to his applauding brethren. When his rashness\r\n      was mildly censured by the general, he excused himself with the\r\n      simplicity of a soldier. “Nay,” said Derar, “I did not begin\r\n      first: but they came out to take me, and I was afraid that God\r\n      should see me turn my back: and indeed I fought in good earnest,\r\n      and without doubt God assisted me against them; and had I not\r\n      been apprehensive of disobeying your orders, I should not have\r\n      come away as I did; and I perceive already that they will fall\r\n      into our hands.” In the presence of both armies, a venerable\r\n      Greek advanced from the ranks with a liberal offer of peace; and\r\n      the departure of the Saracens would have been purchased by a gift\r\n      to each soldier, of a turban, a robe, and a piece of gold; ten\r\n      robes and a hundred pieces to their leader; one hundred robes and\r\n      a thousand pieces to the caliph. A smile of indignation expressed\r\n      the refusal of Caled. “Ye Christian dogs, you know your option;\r\n      the Koran, the tribute, or the sword. We are a people whose\r\n      delight is in war, rather than in peace: and we despise your\r\n      pitiful alms, since we shall be speedily masters of your wealth,\r\n      your families, and your persons.” Notwithstanding this apparent\r\n      disdain, he was deeply conscious of the public danger: those who\r\n      had been in Persia, and had seen the armies of Chosroes confessed\r\n      that they never beheld a more formidable array. From the\r\n      superiority of the enemy, the artful Saracen derived a fresh\r\n      incentive of courage: “You see before you,” said he, “the united\r\n      force of the Romans; you cannot hope to escape, but you may\r\n      conquer Syria in a single day. The event depends on your\r\n      discipline and patience. Reserve yourselves till the evening. It\r\n      was in the evening that the Prophet was accustomed to vanquish.”\r\n      During two successive engagements, his temperate firmness\r\n      sustained the darts of the enemy, and the murmurs of his troops.\r\n      At length, when the spirits and quivers of the adverse line were\r\n      almost exhausted, Caled gave the signal of onset and victory. The\r\n      remains of the Imperial army fled to Antioch, or Cæsarea, or\r\n      Damascus; and the death of four hundred and seventy Moslems was\r\n      compensated by the opinion that they had sent to hell above fifty\r\n      thousand of the infidels. The spoil was inestimable; many banners\r\n      and crosses of gold and silver, precious stones, silver and gold\r\n      chains, and innumerable suits of the richest armor and apparel.\r\n      The general distribution was postponed till Damascus should be\r\n      taken; but the seasonable supply of arms became the instrument of\r\n      new victories. The glorious intelligence was transmitted to the\r\n      throne of the caliph; and the Arabian tribes, the coldest or most\r\n      hostile to the prophet’s mission, were eager and importunate to\r\n      share the harvest of Syria.\r\n\r\n      The sad tidings were carried to Damascus by the speed of grief\r\n      and terror; and the inhabitants beheld from their walls the\r\n      return of the heroes of Aiznadin. Amrou led the van at the head\r\n      of nine thousand horse: the bands of the Saracens succeeded each\r\n      other in formidable review; and the rear was closed by Caled in\r\n      person, with the standard of the black eagle. To the activity of\r\n      Derar he intrusted the commission of patrolling round the city\r\n      with two thousand horse, of scouring the plain, and of\r\n      intercepting all succor or intelligence. The rest of the Arabian\r\n      chiefs were fixed in their respective stations before the seven\r\n      gates of Damascus; and the siege was renewed with fresh vigor and\r\n      confidence. The art, the labor, the military engines, of the\r\n      Greeks and Romans are seldom to be found in the simple, though\r\n      successful, operations of the Saracens: it was sufficient for\r\n      them to invest a city with arms, rather than with trenches; to\r\n      repel the allies of the besieged; to attempt a stratagem or an\r\n      assault; or to expect the progress of famine and discontent.\r\n      Damascus would have acquiesced in the trial of Aiznadin, as a\r\n      final and peremptory sentence between the emperor and the caliph;\r\n      her courage was rekindled by the example and authority of Thomas,\r\n      a noble Greek, illustrious in a private condition by the alliance\r\n      of Heraclius. The tumult and illumination of the night proclaimed\r\n      the design of the morning sally; and the Christian hero, who\r\n      affected to despise the enthusiasm of the Arabs, employed the\r\n      resource of a similar superstition. At the principal gate, in the\r\n      sight of both armies, a lofty crucifix was erected; the bishop,\r\n      with his clergy, accompanied the march, and laid the volume of\r\n      the New Testament before the image of Jesus; and the contending\r\n      parties were scandalized or edified by a prayer that the Son of\r\n      God would defend his servants and vindicate his truth. The battle\r\n      raged with incessant fury; and the dexterity of Thomas, an\r\n      incomparable archer, was fatal to the boldest Saracens, till\r\n      their death was revenged by a female heroine. The wife of Aban,\r\n      who had followed him to the holy war, embraced her expiring\r\n      husband. “Happy,” said she, “happy art thou, my dear: thou art\r\n      gone to thy Lord, who first joined us together, and then parted\r\n      us asunder. I will revenge thy death, and endeavor to the utmost\r\n      of my power to come to the place where thou art, because I love\r\n      thee. Henceforth shall no man ever touch me more, for I have\r\n      dedicated myself to the service of God.” Without a groan, without\r\n      a tear, she washed the corpse of her husband, and buried him with\r\n      the usual rites. Then grasping the manly weapons, which in her\r\n      native land she was accustomed to wield, the intrepid widow of\r\n      Aban sought the place where his murderer fought in the thickest\r\n      of the battle. Her first arrow pierced the hand of his\r\n      standard-bearer; her second wounded Thomas in the eye; and the\r\n      fainting Christians no longer beheld their ensign or their\r\n      leader. Yet the generous champion of Damascus refused to withdraw\r\n      to his palace: his wound was dressed on the rampart; the fight\r\n      was continued till the evening; and the Syrians rested on their\r\n      arms. In the silence of the night, the signal was given by a\r\n      stroke on the great bell; the gates were thrown open, and each\r\n      gate discharged an impetuous column on the sleeping camp of the\r\n      Saracens. Caled was the first in arms: at the head of four\r\n      hundred horse he flew to the post of danger, and the tears\r\n      trickled down his iron cheeks, as he uttered a fervent\r\n      ejaculation; “O God, who never sleepest, look upon they servants,\r\n      and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies.” The\r\n      valor and victory of Thomas were arrested by the presence of the\r\n      _Sword of God_; with the knowledge of the peril, the Moslems\r\n      recovered their ranks, and charged the assailants in the flank\r\n      and rear. After the loss of thousands, the Christian general\r\n      retreated with a sigh of despair, and the pursuit of the Saracens\r\n      was checked by the military engines of the rampart.\r\n\r\n      After a siege of seventy days, the patience, and perhaps the\r\n      provisions, of the Damascenes were exhausted; and the bravest of\r\n      their chiefs submitted to the hard dictates of necessity. In the\r\n      occurrences of peace and war, they had been taught to dread the\r\n      fierceness of Caled, and to revere the mild virtues of Abu\r\n      Obeidah. At the hour of midnight, one hundred chosen deputies of\r\n      the clergy and people were introduced to the tent of that\r\n      venerable commander. He received and dismissed them with\r\n      courtesy. They returned with a written agreement, on the faith of\r\n      a companion of Mahomet, that all hostilities should cease; that\r\n      the voluntary emigrants might depart in safety, with as much as\r\n      they could carry away of their effects; and that the tributary\r\n      subjects of the caliph should enjoy their lands and houses, with\r\n      the use and possession of seven churches. On these terms, the\r\n      most respectable hostages, and the gate nearest to his camp, were\r\n      delivered into his hands: his soldiers imitated the moderation of\r\n      their chief; and he enjoyed the submissive gratitude of a people\r\n      whom he had rescued from destruction. But the success of the\r\n      treaty had relaxed their vigilance, and in the same moment the\r\n      opposite quarter of the city was betrayed and taken by assault. A\r\n      party of a hundred Arabs had opened the eastern gate to a more\r\n      inexorable foe. “No quarter,” cried the rapacious and sanguinary\r\n      Caled, “no quarter to the enemies of the Lord:” his trumpets\r\n      sounded, and a torrent of Christian blood was poured down the\r\n      streets of Damascus. When he reached the church of St. Mary, he\r\n      was astonished and provoked by the peaceful aspect of his\r\n      companions; their swords were in the scabbard, and they were\r\n      surrounded by a multitude of priests and monks. Abu Obeidah\r\n      saluted the general: “God,” said he, “has delivered the city into\r\n      my hands by way of surrender, and has saved the believers the\r\n      trouble of fighting.” “And am I not,” replied the indignant\r\n      Caled, “am I not the lieutenant of the commander of the faithful?\r\n      Have I not taken the city by storm? The unbelievers shall perish\r\n      by the sword. Fall on.” The hungry and cruel Arabs would have\r\n      obeyed the welcome command; and Damascus was lost, if the\r\n      benevolence of Abu Obeidah had not been supported by a decent and\r\n      dignified firmness. Throwing himself between the trembling\r\n      citizens and the most eager of the Barbarians, he adjured them,\r\n      by the holy name of God, to respect his promise, to suspend their\r\n      fury, and to wait the determination of their chiefs. The chiefs\r\n      retired into the church of St. Mary; and after a vehement debate,\r\n      Caled submitted in some measure to the reason and authority of\r\n      his colleague; who urged the sanctity of a covenant, the\r\n      advantage as well as the honor which the Moslems would derive\r\n      from the punctual performance of their word, and the obstinate\r\n      resistance which they must encounter from the distrust and\r\n      despair of the rest of the Syrian cities. It was agreed that the\r\n      sword should be sheathed, that the part of Damascus which had\r\n      surrendered to Abu Obeidah, should be immediately entitled to the\r\n      benefit of his capitulation, and that the final decision should\r\n      be referred to the justice and wisdom of the caliph. A large\r\n      majority of the people accepted the terms of toleration and\r\n      tribute; and Damascus is still peopled by twenty thousand\r\n      Christians. But the valiant Thomas, and the free-born patriots\r\n      who had fought under his banner, embraced the alternative of\r\n      poverty and exile. In the adjacent meadow, a numerous encampment\r\n      was formed of priests and laymen, of soldiers and citizens, of\r\n      women and children: they collected, with haste and terror, their\r\n      most precious movables; and abandoned, with loud lamentations, or\r\n      silent anguish, their native homes, and the pleasant banks of the\r\n      Pharpar. The inflexible soul of Caled was not touched by the\r\n      spectacle of their distress: he disputed with the Damascenes the\r\n      property of a magazine of corn; endeavored to exclude the\r\n      garrison from the benefit of the treaty; consented, with\r\n      reluctance, that each of the fugitives should arm himself with a\r\n      sword, or a lance, or a bow; and sternly declared, that, after a\r\n      respite of three days, they might be pursued and treated as the\r\n      enemies of the Moslems.\r\n\r\n      The passion of a Syrian youth completed the ruin of the exiles of\r\n      Damascus. A nobleman of the city, of the name of Jonas, was\r\n      betrothed to a wealthy maiden; but her parents delayed the\r\n      consummation of his nuptials, and their daughter was persuaded to\r\n      escape with the man whom she had chosen. They corrupted the\r\n      nightly watchmen of the gate Keisan; the lover, who led the way,\r\n      was encompassed by a squadron of Arabs; but his exclamation in\r\n      the Greek tongue, “The bird is taken,” admonished his mistress to\r\n      hasten her return. In the presence of Caled, and of death, the\r\n      unfortunate Jonas professed his belief in one God and his apostle\r\n      Mahomet; and continued, till the season of his martyrdom, to\r\n      discharge the duties of a brave and sincere Mussulman. When the\r\n      city was taken, he flew to the monastery, where Eudocia had taken\r\n      refuge; but the lover was forgotten; the apostate was scorned;\r\n      she preferred her religion to her country; and the justice of\r\n      Caled, though deaf to mercy, refused to detain by force a male or\r\n      female inhabitant of Damascus. Four days was the general confined\r\n      to the city by the obligation of the treaty, and the urgent cares\r\n      of his new conquest. His appetite for blood and rapine would have\r\n      been extinguished by the hopeless computation of time and\r\n      distance; but he listened to the importunities of Jonas, who\r\n      assured him that the weary fugitives might yet be overtaken. At\r\n      the head of four thousand horse, in the disguise of Christian\r\n      Arabs, Caled undertook the pursuit. They halted only for the\r\n      moments of prayer; and their guide had a perfect knowledge of the\r\n      country. For a long way the footsteps of the Damascenes were\r\n      plain and conspicuous: they vanished on a sudden; but the\r\n      Saracens were comforted by the assurance that the caravan had\r\n      turned aside into the mountains, and must speedily fall into\r\n      their hands. In traversing the ridges of the Libanus, they\r\n      endured intolerable hardships, and the sinking spirits of the\r\n      veteran fanatics were supported and cheered by the unconquerable\r\n      ardor of a lover. From a peasant of the country, they were\r\n      informed that the emperor had sent orders to the colony of exiles\r\n      to pursue without delay the road of the sea-coast, and of\r\n      Constantinople, apprehensive, perhaps, that the soldiers and\r\n      people of Antioch might be discouraged by the sight and the story\r\n      of their sufferings. The Saracens were conducted through the\r\n      territories of Gabala and Laodicea, at a cautious distance from\r\n      the walls of the cities; the rain was incessant, the night was\r\n      dark, a single mountain separated them from the Roman army; and\r\n      Caled, ever anxious for the safety of his brethren, whispered an\r\n      ominous dream in the ear of his companion. With the dawn of day,\r\n      the prospect again cleared, and they saw before them, in a\r\n      pleasant valley, the tents of Damascus. After a short interval of\r\n      repose and prayer, Caled divided his cavalry into four squadrons,\r\n      committing the first to his faithful Derar, and reserving the\r\n      last for himself. They successively rushed on the promiscuous\r\n      multitude, insufficiently provided with arms, and already\r\n      vanquished by sorrow and fatigue. Except a captive, who was\r\n      pardoned and dismissed, the Arabs enjoyed the satisfaction of\r\n      believing that not a Christian of either sex escaped the edge of\r\n      their cimeters. The gold and silver of Damascus was scattered\r\n      over the camp, and a royal wardrobe of three hundred load of silk\r\n      might clothe an army of naked Barbarians. In the tumult of the\r\n      battle, Jonas sought and found the object of his pursuit: but her\r\n      resentment was inflamed by the last act of his perfidy; and as\r\n      Eudocia struggled in his hateful embraces, she struck a dagger to\r\n      her heart. Another female, the widow of Thomas, and the real or\r\n      supposed daughter of Heraclius, was spared and released without a\r\n      ransom; but the generosity of Caled was the effect of his\r\n      contempt; and the haughty Saracen insulted, by a message of\r\n      defiance, the throne of the Cæsars. Caled had penetrated above a\r\n      hundred and fifty miles into the heart of the Roman province: he\r\n      returned to Damascus with the same secrecy and speed On the\r\n      accession of Omar, the _Sword of God_ was removed from the\r\n      command; but the caliph, who blamed the rashness, was compelled\r\n      to applaud the vigor and conduct, of the enterprise.\r\n\r\n      Another expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally\r\n      display their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the\r\n      present world. They were informed that the produce and\r\n      manufactures of the country were annually collected in the fair\r\n      of Abyla, 64 about thirty miles from the city; that the cell of a\r\n      devout hermit was visited at the same time by a multitude of\r\n      pilgrims; and that the festival of trade and superstition would\r\n      be ennobled by the nuptials of the daughter of the governor of\r\n      Tripoli. Abdallah, the son of Jaafar, a glorious and holy martyr,\r\n      undertook, with a banner of five hundred horse, the pious and\r\n      profitable commission of despoiling the infidels. As he\r\n      approached the fair of Abyla, he was astonished by the report of\r\n      this mighty concourse of Jews and Christians, Greeks, and\r\n      Armenians, of natives of Syria and of strangers of Egypt, to the\r\n      number of ten thousand, besides a guard of five thousand horse\r\n      that attended the person of the bride. The Saracens paused: “For\r\n      my own part,” said Abdallah, “I dare not go back: our foes are\r\n      many, our danger is great, but our reward is splendid and secure,\r\n      either in this life or in the life to come. Let every man,\r\n      according to his inclination, advance or retire.” Not a Mussulman\r\n      deserted his standard. “Lead the way,” said Abdallah to his\r\n      Christian guide, “and you shall see what the companions of the\r\n      prophet can perform.” They charged in five squadrons; but after\r\n      the first advantage of the surprise, they were encompassed and\r\n      almost overwhelmed by the multitude of their enemies; and their\r\n      valiant band is fancifully compared to a white spot in the skin\r\n      of a black camel. 65 About the hour of sunset, when their weapons\r\n      dropped from their hands, when they panted on the verge of\r\n      eternity, they discovered an approaching cloud of dust; they\r\n      heard the welcome sound of the tecbir, 66 and they soon perceived\r\n      the standard of Caled, who flew to their relief with the utmost\r\n      speed of his cavalry. The Christians were broken by his attack,\r\n      and slaughtered in their flight, as far as the river of Tripoli.\r\n      They left behind them the various riches of the fair; the\r\n      merchandises that were exposed for sale, the money that was\r\n      brought for purchase, the gay decorations of the nuptials, and\r\n      the governor’s daughter, with forty of her female attendants.\r\n\r\n      The fruits, provisions, and furniture, the money, plate, and\r\n      jewels, were diligently laden on the backs of horses, asses, and\r\n      mules; and the holy robbers returned in triumph to Damascus. The\r\n      hermit, after a short and angry controversy with Caled, declined\r\n      the crown of martyrdom, and was left alive in the solitary scene\r\n      of blood and devastation.\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Dair Abil Kodos.

From the age of David to that of\r\n      Heraclius, the country was overspread with ancient and\r\n      flourishing cities: the inhabitants were numerous and wealthy;\r\n      and, after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition, after\r\n      the recent calamities of the Persian war, Syria could still\r\n      attract and reward the rapacious tribes of the desert. A plain,\r\n      of ten days’ journey, from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch, is\r\n      watered, on the western side, by the winding course of the\r\n      Orontes. The hills of Libanus and Anti-Libanus are planted from\r\n      north to south, between the Orontes and the Mediterranean; and\r\n      the epithet of hollow (Coelesyria) was applied to a long and\r\n      fruitful valley, which is confined in the same direction, by the\r\n      two ridges of snowy mountains. 69 Among the cities, which are\r\n      enumerated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and\r\n      conquest of Syria, we may distinguish Emesa or Hems, Heliopolis\r\n      or Baalbec, the former as the metropolis of the plain, the latter\r\n      as the capital of the valley. Under the last of the Caesars, they\r\n      were strong and populous; the turrets glittered from afar: an\r\n      ample space was covered with public and private buildings; and\r\n      the citizens were illustrious by their spirit, or at least by\r\n      their pride; by their riches, or at least by their luxury. In the\r\n      days of Paganism, both Emesa and Heliopolis were addicted to the\r\n      worship of Baal, or the sun; but the decline of their\r\n      superstition and splendor has been marked by a singular variety\r\n      of fortune. Not a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa, which\r\n      was equalled in poetic style to the summits of Mount Libanus, 70\r\n      while the ruins of Baalbec, invisible to the writers of\r\n      antiquity, excite the curiosity and wonder of the European\r\n      traveller. 71 The measure of the temple is two hundred feet in\r\n      length, and one hundred in breadth: the front is adorned with a\r\n      double portico of eight columns; fourteen may be counted on\r\n      either side; and each column, forty-five feet in height, is\r\n      composed of three massy blocks of stone or marble. The\r\n      proportions and ornaments of the Corinthian order express the\r\n      architecture of the Greeks: but as Baalbec has never been the\r\n      seat of a monarch, we are at a loss to conceive how the expense\r\n      of these magnificent structures could be supplied by private or\r\n      municipal liberality. 72 From the conquest of Damascus the\r\n      Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa: but I shall decline\r\n      the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been already\r\n      shown on a larger scale. In the prosecution of the war, their\r\n      policy was not less effectual than their sword. By short and\r\n      separate truces they dissolved the union of the enemy; accustomed\r\n      the Syrians to compare their friendship with their enmity;\r\n      familiarized the idea of their language, religion, and manners;\r\n      and exhausted, by clandestine purchase, the magazines and\r\n      arsenals of the cities which they returned to besiege. They\r\n      aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy, or the more obstinate;\r\n      and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold, five\r\n      thousand ounces of silver, two thousand robes of silk, and as\r\n      many figs and olives as would load five thousand asses. But the\r\n      terms of truce or capitulation were faithfully observed; and the\r\n      lieutenant of the caliph, who had promised not to enter the walls\r\n      of the captive Baalbec, remained tranquil and immovable in his\r\n      tent till the jarring factions solicited the interposition of a\r\n      foreign master. The conquest of the plain and valley of Syria was\r\n      achieved in less than two years. Yet the commander of the\r\n      faithful reproved the slowness of their progress; and the\r\n      Saracens, bewailing their fault with tears of rage and\r\n      repentance, called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to\r\n      fight the battles of the Lord. In a recent action, under the\r\n      walls of Emesa, an Arabian youth, the cousin of Caled, was heard\r\n      aloud to exclaim, “Methinks I see the black-eyed girls looking\r\n      upon me; one of whom, should she appear in this world, all\r\n      mankind would die for love of her. And I see in the hand of one\r\n      of them a handkerchief of green silk, and a cap of precious\r\n      stones, and she beckons me, and calls out, Come hither quickly,\r\n      for I love thee.” With these words, charging the Christians, he\r\n      made havoc wherever he went, till, observed at length by the\r\n      governor of Hems, he was struck through with a javelin.\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ In the Geography of Abulfeda, the description of\r\n      Syria, his native country, is the most interesting and authentic\r\n      portion.

From the provinces of Europe and Asia, fourscore\r\n      thousand soldiers were transported by sea and land to Antioch and\r\n      Caesarea: the light troops of the army consisted of sixty\r\n      thousand Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan. Under the banner\r\n      of Jabalah, the last of their princes, they marched in the van;\r\n      and it was a maxim of the Greeks, that for the purpose of cutting\r\n      diamond, a diamond was the most effectual. Heraclius withheld his\r\n      person from the dangers of the field; but his presumption, or\r\n      perhaps his despondency, suggested a peremptory order, that the\r\n      fate of the province and the war should be decided by a single\r\n      battle. The Syrians were attached to the standard of Rome and of\r\n      the cross: but the noble, the citizen, the peasant, were\r\n      exasperated by the injustice and cruelty of a licentious host,\r\n      who oppressed them as subjects, and despised them as strangers\r\n      and aliens. 73 A report of these mighty preparations was conveyed\r\n      to the Saracens in their camp of Emesa, and the chiefs, though\r\n      resolved to fight, assembled a council: the faith of Abu Obeidah\r\n      would have expected on the same spot the glory of martyrdom; the\r\n      wisdom of Caled advised an honorable retreat to the skirts of\r\n      Palestine and Arabia, where they might await the succors of their\r\n      friends, and the attack of the unbelievers. A speedy messenger\r\n      soon returned from the throne of Medina, with the blessings of\r\n      Omar and Ali, the prayers of the widows of the prophet, and a\r\n      reenforcement of eight thousand Moslems. In their way they\r\n      overturned a detachment of Greeks, and when they joined at Yermuk\r\n      the camp of their brethren, they found the pleasing intelligence,\r\n      that Caled had already defeated and scattered the Christian Arabs\r\n      of the tribe of Gassan. In the neighborhood of Bosra, the springs\r\n      of Mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of Decapolis,\r\n      or ten cities; and the Hieromax, a name which has been corrupted\r\n      to Yermuk, is lost, after a short course, in the Lake of\r\n      Tiberias. 74 The banks of this obscure stream were illustrated by\r\n      a long and bloody encounter. 7411 On this momentous occasion, the\r\n      public voice, and the modesty of Abu Obeidah, restored the\r\n      command to the most deserving of the Moslems. Caled assumed his\r\n      station in the front, his colleague was posted in the rear, that\r\n      the disorder of the fugitive might be checked by his venerable\r\n      aspect, and the sight of the yellow banner which Mahomet had\r\n      displayed before the walls of Chaibar. The last line was occupied\r\n      by the sister of Derar, with the Arabian women who had enlisted\r\n      in this holy war, who were accustomed to wield the bow and the\r\n      lance, and who in a moment of captivity had defended, against the\r\n      uncircumcised ravishers, their chastity and religion. 75 The\r\n      exhortation of the generals was brief and forcible: “Paradise is\r\n      before you, the devil and hell-fire in your rear.” Yet such was\r\n      the weight of the Roman cavalry, that the right wing of the Arabs\r\n      was broken and separated from the main body. Thrice did they\r\n      retreat in disorder, and thrice were they driven back to the\r\n      charge by the reproaches and blows of the women. In the intervals\r\n      of action, Abu Obeidah visited the tents of his brethren,\r\n      prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers of two\r\n      different hours, bound up their wounds with his own hands, and\r\n      administered the comfortable reflection, that the infidels\r\n      partook of their sufferings without partaking of their reward.\r\n      Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field\r\n      of battle; and the skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven\r\n      hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that meritorious\r\n      service. The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it was\r\n      the hardest and most doubtful of the days which they had seen.\r\n      But it was likewise the most decisive: many thousands of the\r\n      Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were\r\n      slaughtered, after the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many,\r\n      by mistaking the ford, were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk;\r\n      and however the loss may be magnified, 76 the Christian writers\r\n      confess and bewail the bloody punishment of their sins. 77\r\n      Manuel, the Roman general, was either killed at Damascus, or took\r\n      refuge in the monastery of Mount Sinai. An exile in the Byzantine\r\n      court, Jabalah lamented the manners of Arabia, and his unlucky\r\n      preference of the Christian cause. 78 He had once inclined to the\r\n      profession of Islam; but in the pilgrimage of Mecca, Jabalah was\r\n      provoked to strike one of his brethren, and fled with amazement\r\n      from the stern and equal justice of the caliph. These victorious\r\n      Saracens enjoyed at Damascus a month of pleasure and repose: the\r\n      spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah: an equal\r\n      share was allotted to a soldier and to his horse, and a double\r\n      portion was reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed.\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ I have read somewhere in Tacitus, or Grotius,\r\n      Subjectos habent tanquam suos, viles tanquam alienos.

They\r\n      consulted the caliph whether they should march to Caesarea or\r\n      Jerusalem; and the advice of Ali determined the immediate siege\r\n      of the latter. To a profane eye, Jerusalem was the first or\r\n      second capital of Palestine; but after Mecca and Medina, it was\r\n      revered and visited by the devout Moslems, as the temple of the\r\n      Holy Land which had been sanctified by the revelation of Moses,\r\n      of Jesus, and of Mahomet himself. The son of Abu Sophian was sent\r\n      with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise\r\n      or treaty; but on the eleventh day, the town was invested by the\r\n      whole force of Abu Obeidah.

Nor will I ever stir from you, if it\r\n      please God, till I have destroyed those that fight for you, and\r\n      made slaves of your children.” But the city was defended on every\r\n      side by deep valleys and steep ascents; since the invasion of\r\n      Syria, the walls and towers had been anxiously restored; the\r\n      bravest of the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest\r\n      place of refuge; and in the defence of the sepulchre of Christ,\r\n      the natives and strangers might feel some sparks of the\r\n      enthusiasm, which so fiercely glowed in the bosoms of the\r\n      Saracens. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months; not a day\r\n      was lost without some action of sally or assault; the military\r\n      engines incessantly played from the ramparts; and the inclemency\r\n      of the winter was still more painful and destructive to the\r\n      Arabs. The Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of\r\n      the besiegers. The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls,\r\n      and by the voice of an interpreter demanded a conference. 7911\r\n      After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph\r\n      from his impious enterprise, he proposed, in the name of the\r\n      people, a fair capitulation, with this extraordinary clause, that\r\n      the articles of security should be ratified by the authority and\r\n      presence of Omar himself. The question was debated in the council\r\n      of Medina; the sanctity of the place, and the advice of Ali,\r\n      persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and\r\n      enemies; and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious\r\n      than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression. The conqueror\r\n      of Persia and Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried,\r\n      besides his person, a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish,\r\n      and a leathern bottle of water. Wherever he halted, the company,\r\n      without distinction, was invited to partake of his homely fare,\r\n      and the repast was consecrated by the prayer and exhortation of\r\n      the commander of the faithful. 80 But in this expedition or\r\n      pilgrimage, his power was exercised in the administration of\r\n      justice: he reformed the licentious polygamy of the Arabs,\r\n      relieved the tributaries from extortion and cruelty, and\r\n      chastised the luxury of the Saracens, by despoiling them of their\r\n      rich silks, and dragging them on their faces in the dirt. When he\r\n      came within sight of Jerusalem, the caliph cried with a loud\r\n      voice, “God is victorious. O Lord, give us an easy conquest!”\r\n      and, pitching his tent of coarse hair, calmly seated himself on\r\n      the ground. After signing the capitulation, he entered the city\r\n      without fear or precaution; and courteously discoursed with the\r\n      patriarch concerning its religious antiquities. 81 Sophronius\r\n      bowed before his new master, and secretly muttered, in the words\r\n      of Daniel, “The abomination of desolation is in the holy place.”\r\n      82 At the hour of prayer they stood together in the church of the\r\n      resurrection; but the caliph refused to perform his devotions,\r\n      and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church of\r\n      Constantine. To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and\r\n      honorable motive. “Had I yielded,” said Omar, “to your request,\r\n      the Moslems of a future age would have infringed the treaty under\r\n      color of imitating my example.” By his command the ground of the\r\n      temple of Solomon was prepared for the foundation of a mosch; 83\r\n      and, during a residence of ten days, he regulated the present and\r\n      future state of his Syrian conquests. Medina might be jealous,\r\n      lest the caliph should be detained by the sanctity of Jerusalem\r\n      or the beauty of Damascus; her apprehensions were dispelled by\r\n      his prompt and voluntary return to the tomb of the apostle. 84\r\n\r\n      7911 (return) [ See the explanation of this in Price, with the\r\n      prophecy which was hereby fulfilled, p 85.—M]\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ The singular journey and equipage of Omar are\r\n      described (besides Ockley, vol. i. p. 250) by Murtadi,\r\n      (Merveilles de l’Egypte, p. 200-202.)]\r\n\r\n      81 (return) [ The Arabs boast of an old prophecy preserved at\r\n      Jerusalem, and describing the name, the religion, and the person\r\n      of Omar, the future conqueror.

The latter of\r\n      these, the Beraea of the Greeks, was not yet illustrious as the\r\n      capital of a province or a kingdom; and the inhabitants, by\r\n      anticipating their submission and pleading their poverty,\r\n      obtained a moderate composition for their lives and religion. But\r\n      the castle of Aleppo, 85 distinct from the city, stood erect on a\r\n      lofty artificial mound; the sides were sharpened to a precipice,\r\n      and faced with free-stone; and the breadth of the ditch might be\r\n      filled with water from the neighboring springs. After the loss of\r\n      three thousand men, the garrison was still equal to the defence;\r\n      and Youkinna, their valiant and hereditary chief, had murdered\r\n      his brother, a holy monk, for daring to pronounce the name of\r\n      peace. In a siege of four or five months, the hardest of the\r\n      Syrian war, great numbers of the Saracens were killed and\r\n      wounded: their removal to the distance of a mile could not seduce\r\n      the vigilance of Youkinna; nor could the Christians be terrified\r\n      by the execution of three hundred captives, whom they beheaded\r\n      before the castle wall. The silence, and at length the\r\n      complaints, of Abu Obeidah informed the caliph that their hope\r\n      and patience were consumed at the foot of this impregnable\r\n      fortress. “I am variously affected,” replied Omar, “by the\r\n      difference of your success; but I charge you by no means to raise\r\n      the siege of the castle. Your retreat would diminish the\r\n      reputation of our arms, and encourage the infidels to fall upon\r\n      you on all sides. Remain before Aleppo till God shall determine\r\n      the event, and forage with your horse round the adjacent\r\n      country.” The exhortation of the commander of the faithful was\r\n      fortified by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of\r\n      Arabia, who arrived in the camp on horses or camels. Among these\r\n      was Dames, of a servile birth, but of gigantic size and intrepid\r\n      resolution. The forty-seventh day of his service he proposed,\r\n      with only thirty men, to make an attempt on the castle. The\r\n      experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer; and Abu\r\n      Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin\r\n      of Dames, since he himself, could he relinquish the public care,\r\n      would cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave. His design\r\n      was covered by the appearance of a retreat; and the camp of the\r\n      Saracens was pitched about a league from Aleppo. The thirty\r\n      adventurers lay in ambush at the foot of the hill; and Dames at\r\n      length succeeded in his inquiries, though he was provoked by the\r\n      ignorance of his Greek captives. “God curse these dogs,” said the\r\n      illiterate Arab; “what a strange barbarous language they speak!”\r\n      At the darkest hour of the night, he scaled the most accessible\r\n      height, which he had diligently surveyed, a place where the\r\n      stones were less entire, or the slope less perpendicular, or the\r\n      guard less vigilant. Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on\r\n      each other’s shoulders, and the weight of the column was\r\n      sustained on the broad and sinewy back of the gigantic slave. The\r\n      foremost in this painful ascent could grasp and climb the lowest\r\n      part of the battlements; they silently stabbed and cast down the\r\n      sentinels; and the thirty brethren, repeating a pious\r\n      ejaculation, “O apostle of God, help and deliver us!” were\r\n      successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans. With\r\n      bold and cautious footsteps, Dames explored the palace of the\r\n      governor, who celebrated, in riotous merriment, the festival of\r\n      his deliverance. From thence, returning to his companions, he\r\n      assaulted on the inside the entrance of the castle. They\r\n      overpowered the guard, unbolted the gate, let down the\r\n      drawbridge, and defended the narrow pass, till the arrival of\r\n      Caled, with the dawn of day, relieved their danger and assured\r\n      their conquest. Youkinna, a formidable foe, became an active and\r\n      useful proselyte; and the general of the Saracens expressed his\r\n      regard for the most humble merit, by detaining the army at Aleppo\r\n      till Dames was cured of his honorable wounds. The capital of\r\n      Syria was still covered by the castle of Aazaz and the iron\r\n      bridge of the Orontes. After the loss of those important posts,\r\n      and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies, the luxury of\r\n      Antioch 86 trembled and obeyed. Her safety was ransomed with\r\n      three hundred thousand pieces of gold; but the throne of the\r\n      successors of Alexander, the seat of the Roman government of the\r\n      East, which had been decorated by Caesar with the titles of free,\r\n      and holy, and inviolate was degraded under the yoke of the\r\n      caliphs to the secondary rank of a provincial town. 87\r\n\r\n      85 (return) [ The Persian historian of Timur (tom. iii. l. v. c.\r\n      21, p. 300) describes the castle of Aleppo as founded on a rock\r\n      one hundred cubits in height; a proof, says the French\r\n      translator, that he had never visited the place. It is now in the\r\n      midst of the city, of no strength with a single gate; the circuit\r\n      is about 500 or 600 paces, and the ditch half full of stagnant\r\n      water, (Voyages de Tavernier, tom. i. p. 149 Pocock, vol. ii.\r\n      part i. p. 150.)

When the successors of Mahomet\r\n      unsheathed the sword of war and religion, he was astonished at\r\n      the boundless prospect of toil and danger; his nature was\r\n      indolent, nor could the infirm and frigid age of the emperor be\r\n      kindled to a second effort. The sense of shame, and the\r\n      importunities of the Syrians, prevented the hasty departure from\r\n      the scene of action; but the hero was no more; and the loss of\r\n      Damascus and Jerusalem, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk,\r\n      may be imputed in some degree to the absence or misconduct of the\r\n      sovereign. Instead of defending the sepulchre of Christ, he\r\n      involved the church and state in a metaphysical controversy for\r\n      the unity of his will; and while Heraclius crowned the offspring\r\n      of his second nuptials, he was tamely stripped of the most\r\n      valuable part of their inheritance. In the cathedral of Antioch,\r\n      in the presence of the bishops, at the foot of the crucifix, he\r\n      bewailed the sins of the prince and people; but his confession\r\n      instructed the world, that it was vain, and perhaps impious, to\r\n      resist the judgment of God. The Saracens were invincible in fact,\r\n      since they were invincible in opinion; and the desertion of\r\n      Youkinna, his false repentance and repeated perfidy, might\r\n      justify the suspicion of the emperor, that he was encompassed by\r\n      traitors and apostates, who conspired to betray his person and\r\n      their country to the enemies of Christ. In the hour of adversity,\r\n      his superstition was agitated by the omens and dreams of a\r\n      falling crown; and after bidding an eternal farewell to Syria, he\r\n      secretly embarked with a few attendants, and absolved the faith\r\n      of his subjects. 88 Constantine, his eldest son, had been\r\n      stationed with forty thousand men at Caesarea, the civil\r\n      metropolis of the three provinces of Palestine. But his private\r\n      interest recalled him to the Byzantine court; and, after the\r\n      flight of his father, he felt himself an unequal champion to the\r\n      united force of the caliph. His vanguard was boldly attacked by\r\n      three hundred Arabs and a thousand black slaves, who, in the\r\n      depth of winter, had climbed the snowy mountains of Libanus, and\r\n      who were speedily followed by the victorious squadrons of Caled\r\n      himself. From the north and south the troops of Antioch and\r\n      Jerusalem advanced along the sea-shore till their banners were\r\n      joined under the walls of the Phoenician cities: Tripoli and Tyre\r\n      were betrayed; and a fleet of fifty transports, which entered\r\n      without distrust the captive harbors, brought a seasonable supply\r\n      of arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens. Their labors\r\n      were terminated by the unexpected surrender of Caesarea: the\r\n      Roman prince had embarked in the night; 89 and the defenceless\r\n      citizens solicited their pardon with an offering of two hundred\r\n      thousand pieces of gold. The remainder of the province, Ramlah,\r\n      Ptolemais or Acre, Sichem or Neapolis, Gaza, Ascalon, Berytus,\r\n      Sidon, Gabala, Laodicea, Apamea, Hierapolis, no longer presumed\r\n      to dispute the will of the conqueror; and Syria bowed under the\r\n      sceptre of the caliphs seven hundred years after Pompey had\r\n      despoiled the last of the Macedonian kings. 90\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ See Ockley, (vol. i. p. 308, 312,) who laughs at\r\n      the credulity of his author.

They died with the reputation and the\r\n      cheerfulness of martyrs; and the simplicity of their faith may be\r\n      expressed in the words of an Arabian youth, when he embraced, for\r\n      the last time, his sister and mother: “It is not,” said he, “the\r\n      delicacies of Syria, or the fading delights of this world, that\r\n      have prompted me to devote my life in the cause of religion. But\r\n      I seek the favor of God and his apostle; and I have heard, from\r\n      one of the companions of the prophet, that the spirits of the\r\n      martyrs will be lodged in the crops of green birds, who shall\r\n      taste the fruits, and drink of the rivers, of paradise. Farewell,\r\n      we shall meet again among the groves and fountains which God has\r\n      provided for his elect.” The faithful captives might exercise a\r\n      passive and more arduous resolution; and a cousin of Mahomet is\r\n      celebrated for refusing, after an abstinence of three days, the\r\n      wine and pork, the only nourishment that was allowed by the\r\n      malice of the infidels. The frailty of some weaker brethren\r\n      exasperated the implacable spirit of fanaticism; and the father\r\n      of Amer deplored, in pathetic strains, the apostasy and damnation\r\n      of a son, who had renounced the promises of God, and the\r\n      intercession of the prophet, to occupy, with the priests and\r\n      deacons, the lowest mansions of hell. The more fortunate Arabs,\r\n      who survived the war and persevered in the faith, were restrained\r\n      by their abstemious leader from the abuse of prosperity. After a\r\n      refreshment of three days, Abu Obeidah withdrew his troops from\r\n      the pernicious contagion of the luxury of Antioch, and assured\r\n      the caliph that their religion and virtue could only be preserved\r\n      by the hard discipline of poverty and labor. But the virtue of\r\n      Omar, however rigorous to himself, was kind and liberal to his\r\n      brethren. After a just tribute of praise and thanksgiving, he\r\n      dropped a tear of compassion; and sitting down on the ground,\r\n      wrote an answer, in which he mildly censured the severity of his\r\n      lieutenant: “God,” said the successor of the prophet, “has not\r\n      forbidden the use of the good things of this worl to faithful\r\n      men, and such as have performed good works. Therefore you ought\r\n      to have given them leave to rest themselves, and partake freely\r\n      of those good things which the country affordeth. If any of the\r\n      Saracens have no family in Arabia, they may marry in Syria; and\r\n      whosoever of them wants any female slaves, he may purchase as\r\n      many as he hath occasion for.” The conquerors prepared to use, or\r\n      to abuse, this gracious permission; but the year of their triumph\r\n      was marked by a mortality of men and cattle; and twenty-five\r\n      thousand Saracens were snatched away from the possession of\r\n      Syria. The death of Abu Obeidah might be lamented by the\r\n      Christians; but his brethren recollected that he was one of the\r\n      ten elect whom the prophet had named as the heirs of paradise. 91\r\n      Caled survived his brethren about three years: and the tomb of\r\n      the Sword of God is shown in the neighborhood of Emesa. His\r\n      valor, which founded in Arabia and Syria the empire of the\r\n      caliphs, was fortified by the opinion of a special providence;\r\n      and as long as he wore a cap, which had been blessed by Mahomet,\r\n      he deemed himself invulnerable amidst the darts of the infidels.\r\n      9111\r\n\r\n      91 (return) [ Abulfeda, Annal.

But the Saracens\r\n      despise a superfluity of fame; and their historians scarcely\r\n      condescend to mention the subordinate conquests which are lost in\r\n      the splendor and rapidity of their victorious career.\r\n\r\n      To the north of Syria, they passed Mount Taurus, and reduced to\r\n      their obedience the province of Cilicia, with its capital Tarsus,\r\n      the ancient monument of the Assyrian kings. Beyond a second ridge\r\n      of the same mountains, they spread the flame of war, rather than\r\n      the light of religion, as far as the shores of the Euxine, and\r\n      the neighborhood of Constantinople. To the east they advanced to\r\n      the banks and sources of the Euphrates and Tigris: 92 the long\r\n      disputed barrier of Rome and Persia was forever confounded; the\r\n      walls of Edessa and Amida, of Dara and Nisibis, which had\r\n      resisted the arms and engines of Sapor or Nushirvan, were\r\n      levelled in the dust; and the holy city of Abgarus might vainly\r\n      produce the epistle or the image of Christ to an unbelieving\r\n      conqueror. To the west the Syrian kingdom is bounded by the sea:\r\n      and the ruin of Aradus, a small island or peninsula on the coast,\r\n      was postponed during ten years. But the hills of Libanus abounded\r\n      in timber; the trade of Phoenicia was populous in mariners; and a\r\n      fleet of seventeen hundred barks was equipped and manned by the\r\n      natives of the desert. The Imperial navy of the Romans fled\r\n      before them from the Pamphylian rocks to the Hellespont; but the\r\n      spirit of the emperor, a grandson of Heraclius, had been subdued\r\n      before the combat by a dream and a pun. 93 The Saracens rode\r\n      masters of the sea; and the islands of Cyprus, Rhodes, and the\r\n      Cyclades, were successively exposed to their rapacious visits.\r\n      Three hundred years before the Christian aera, the memorable\r\n      though fruitless siege of Rhodes 94 by Demetrius had furnished\r\n      that maritime republic with the materials and the subject of a\r\n      trophy. A gigantic statue of Apollo, or the sun, seventy cubits\r\n      in height, was erected at the entrance of the harbor, a monument\r\n      of the freedom and the arts of Greece. After standing fifty-six\r\n      years, the colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake;\r\n      but the massy trunk, and huge fragments, lay scattered eight\r\n      centuries on the ground, and are often described as one of the\r\n      wonders of the ancient world. They were collected by the\r\n      diligence of the Saracens, and sold to a Jewish merchant of\r\n      Edessa, who is said to have laden nine hundred camels with the\r\n      weight of the brass metal; an enormous weight, though we should\r\n      include the hundred colossal figures, 95 and the three thousand\r\n      statues, which adorned the prosperity of the city of the sun.\r\n\r\n      92 (return) [ Al Wakidi had likewise written a history of the\r\n      conquest of Diarbekir, or Mesopotamia, (Ockley, at the end of the\r\n      iid vol.,) which our interpreters do not appear to have seen.

The conquest of Egypt may be explained by the character of\r\n      the victorious Saracen, one of the first of his nation, in an age\r\n      when the meanest of the brethren was exalted above his nature by\r\n      the spirit of enthusiasm. The birth of Amrou was at once base and\r\n      illustrious; his mother, a notorious prostitute, was unable to\r\n      decide among five of the Koreish; but the proof of resemblance\r\n      adjudged the child to Aasi, the oldest of her lovers. 96 The\r\n      youth of Amrou was impelled by the passions and prejudices of his\r\n      kindred: his poetic genius was exercised in satirical verses\r\n      against the person and doctrine of Mahomet; his dexterity was\r\n      employed by the reigning faction to pursue the religious exiles\r\n      who had taken refuge in the court of the Aethiopian king. 97 Yet\r\n      he returned from this embassy a secret proselyte; his reason or\r\n      his interest determined him to renounce the worship of idols; he\r\n      escaped from Mecca with his friend Caled; and the prophet of\r\n      Medina enjoyed at the same moment the satisfaction of embracing\r\n      the two firmest champions of his cause. The impatience of Amrou\r\n      to lead the armies of the faithful was checked by the reproof of\r\n      Omar, who advised him not to seek power and dominion, since he\r\n      who is a subject to-day, may be a prince to-morrow. Yet his merit\r\n      was not overlooked by the two first successors of Mahomet; they\r\n      were indebted to his arms for the conquest of Palestine; and in\r\n      all the battles and sieges of Syria, he united with the temper of\r\n      a chief the valor of an adventurous soldier. In a visit to\r\n      Medina, the caliph expressed a wish to survey the sword which had\r\n      cut down so many Christian warriors; the son of Aasi unsheathed a\r\n      short and ordinary cimeter; and as he perceived the surprise of\r\n      Omar, “Alas,” said the modest Saracen, “the sword itself, without\r\n      the arm of its master, is neither sharper nor more weighty than\r\n      the sword of Pharezdak the poet.” 98 After the conquest of Egypt,\r\n      he was recalled by the jealousy of the caliph Othman; but in the\r\n      subsequent troubles, the ambition of a soldier, a statesman, and\r\n      an orator, emerged from a private station. His powerful support,\r\n      both in council and in the field, established the throne of the\r\n      Ommiades; the administration and revenue of Egypt were restored\r\n      by the gratitude of Moawiyah to a faithful friend who had raised\r\n      himself above the rank of a subject; and Amrou ended his days in\r\n      the palace and city which he had founded on the banks of the\r\n      Nile. His dying speech to his children is celebrated by the\r\n      Arabians as a model of eloquence and wisdom: he deplored the\r\n      errors of his youth but if the penitent was still infected by the\r\n      vanity of a poet, he might exaggerate the venom and mischief of\r\n      his impious compositions. 99\r\n\r\n      96 (return) [ We learn this anecdote from a spirited old woman,\r\n      who reviled to their faces, the caliph and his friend.

Yet the resemblance is\r\n      still more in the situation, than in the characters, of the men.]\r\n\r\n      From his camp in Palestine, Amrou had surprised or anticipated\r\n      the caliph’s leave for the invasion of Egypt. 100 The magnanimous\r\n      Omar trusted in his God and his sword, which had shaken the\r\n      thrones of Chosroes and Caesar: but when he compared the slender\r\n      force of the Moslems with the greatness of the enterprise, he\r\n      condemned his own rashness, and listened to his timid companions.\r\n      The pride and the greatness of Pharaoh were familiar to the\r\n      readers of the Koran; and a tenfold repetition of prodigies had\r\n      been scarcely sufficient to effect, not the victory, but the\r\n      flight, of six hundred thousand of the children of Israel: the\r\n      cities of Egypt were many and populous; their architecture was\r\n      strong and solid; the Nile, with its numerous branches, was alone\r\n      an insuperable barrier; and the granary of the Imperial city\r\n      would be obstinately defended by the Roman powers. In this\r\n      perplexity, the commander of the faithful resigned himself to the\r\n      decision of chance, or, in his opinion, of Providence. At the\r\n      head of only four thousand Arabs, the intrepid Amrou had marched\r\n      away from his station of Gaza when he was overtaken by the\r\n      messenger of Omar. “If you are still in Syria,” said the\r\n      ambiguous mandate, “retreat without delay; but if, at the receipt\r\n      of this epistle, you have already reached the frontiers of Egypt,\r\n      advance with confidence, and depend on the succor of God and of\r\n      your brethren.” The experience, perhaps the secret intelligence,\r\n      of Amrou had taught him to suspect the mutability of courts; and\r\n      he continued his march till his tents were unquestionably pitched\r\n      on Egyptian ground. He there assembled his officers, broke the\r\n      seal, perused the epistle, gravely inquired the name and\r\n      situation of the place, and declared his ready obedience to the\r\n      commands of the caliph. After a siege of thirty days, he took\r\n      possession of Farmah or Pelusium; and that key of Egypt, as it\r\n      has been justly named, unlocked the entrance of the country as\r\n      far as the ruins of Heliopolis and the neighborhood of the modern\r\n      Cairo.\r\n\r\n      100 (return) [ Al Wakidi had likewise composed a separate history\r\n      of the conquest of Egypt, which Mr. Ockley could never procure;\r\n      and his own inquiries (vol. i. 344-362) have added very little to\r\n      the original text of Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 296-323,\r\n      vers. Pocock,) the Melchite patriarch of Alexandria, who lived\r\n      three hundred years after the revolution.]\r\n\r\n      On the Western side of the Nile, at a small distance to the east\r\n      of the Pyramids, at a small distance to the south of the Delta,\r\n      Memphis, one hundred and fifty furlongs in circumference,\r\n      displayed the magnificence of ancient kings. Under the reign of\r\n      the Ptolemies and Caesars, the seat of government was removed to\r\n      the sea-coast; the ancient capital was eclipsed by the arts and\r\n      opulence of Alexandria; the palaces, and at length the temples,\r\n      were reduced to a desolate and ruinous condition: yet, in the age\r\n      of Augustus, and even in that of Constantine, Memphis was still\r\n      numbered among the greatest and most populous of the provincial\r\n      cities. 101 The banks of the Nile, in this place of the breadth\r\n      of three thousand feet, were united by two bridges of sixty and\r\n      of thirty boats, connected in the middle stream by the small\r\n      island of Rouda, which was covered with gardens and habitations.\r\n      102 The eastern extremity of the bridge was terminated by the\r\n      town of Babylon and the camp of a Roman legion, which protected\r\n      the passage of the river and the second capital of Egypt. This\r\n      important fortress, which might fairly be described as a part of\r\n      Memphis or Misrah, was invested by the arms of the lieutenant of\r\n      Omar: a reenforcement of four thousand Saracens soon arrived in\r\n      his camp; and the military engines, which battered the walls, may\r\n      be imputed to the art and labor of his Syrian allies. Yet the\r\n      siege was protracted to seven months; and the rash invaders were\r\n      encompassed and threatened by the inundation of the Nile. 103\r\n      Their last assault was bold and successful: they passed the\r\n      ditch, which had been fortified with iron spikes, applied their\r\n      scaling ladders, entered the fortress with the shout of “God is\r\n      victorious!” and drove the remnant of the Greeks to their boats\r\n      and the Isle of Rouda. The spot was afterwards recommended to the\r\n      conqueror by the easy communication with the gulf and the\r\n      peninsula of Arabia; the remains of Memphis were deserted; the\r\n      tents of the Arabs were converted into permanent habitations; and\r\n      the first mosch was blessed by the presence of fourscore\r\n      companions of Mahomet. 104 A new city arose in their camp, on the\r\n      eastward bank of the Nile; and the contiguous quarters of Babylon\r\n      and Fostat are confounded in their present decay by the\r\n      appellation of old Misrah, or Cairo, of which they form an\r\n      extensive suburb. But the name of Cairo, the town of victory,\r\n      more strictly belongs to the modern capital, which was founded in\r\n      the tenth century by the Fatimite caliphs. 105 It has gradually\r\n      receded from the river; but the continuity of buildings may be\r\n      traced by an attentive eye from the monuments of Sesostris to\r\n      those of Saladin. 106\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ Strabo, an accurate and attentive spectator,\r\n      observes of Heliopolis, (Geograph. l. xvii. p. 1158;) but of\r\n      Memphis he notices, however, the mixture of inhabitants, and the\r\n      ruin of the palaces.

The rapid conquest of\r\n      Alexander was assisted by the superstition and revolt of the\r\n      natives: they abhorred their Persian oppressors, the disciples of\r\n      the Magi, who had burnt the temples of Egypt, and feasted with\r\n      sacrilegious appetite on the flesh of the god Apis. 107 After a\r\n      period of ten centuries, the same revolution was renewed by a\r\n      similar cause; and in the support of an incomprehensible creed,\r\n      the zeal of the Coptic Christians was equally ardent. I have\r\n      already explained the origin and progress of the Monophysite\r\n      controversy, and the persecution of the emperors, which converted\r\n      a sect into a nation, and alienated Egypt from their religion and\r\n      government. The Saracens were received as the deliverers of the\r\n      Jacobite church; and a secret and effectual treaty was opened\r\n      during the siege of Memphis between a victorious army and a\r\n      people of slaves. A rich and noble Egyptian, of the name of\r\n      Mokawkas, had dissembled his faith to obtain the administration\r\n      of his province: in the disorders of the Persian war he aspired\r\n      to independence: the embassy of Mahomet ranked him among princes;\r\n      but he declined, with rich gifts and ambiguous compliments, the\r\n      proposal of a new religion. 108 The abuse of his trust exposed\r\n      him to the resentment of Heraclius: his submission was delayed by\r\n      arrogance and fear; and his conscience was prompted by interest\r\n      to throw himself on the favor of the nation and the support of\r\n      the Saracens. In his first conference with Amrou, he heard\r\n      without indignation the usual option of the Koran, the tribute,\r\n      or the sword. “The Greeks,” replied Mokawkas, “are determined to\r\n      abide the determination of the sword; but with the Greeks I\r\n      desire no communion, either in this world or in the next, and I\r\n      abjure forever the Byzantine tyrant, his synod of Chalcedon, and\r\n      his Melchite slaves. For myself and my brethren, we are resolved\r\n      to live and die in the profession of the gospel and unity of\r\n      Christ. It is impossible for us to embrace the revelations of\r\n      your prophet; but we are desirous of peace, and cheerfully submit\r\n      to pay tribute and obedience to his temporal successors.” The\r\n      tribute was ascertained at two pieces of gold for the head of\r\n      every Christian; but old men, monks, women, and children, of both\r\n      sexes, under sixteen years of age, were exempted from this\r\n      personal assessment: the Copts above and below Memphis swore\r\n      allegiance to the caliph, and promised a hospitable entertainment\r\n      of three days to every Mussulman who should travel through their\r\n      country. By this charter of security, the ecclesiastical and\r\n      civil tyranny of the Melchites was destroyed: 109 the anathemas\r\n      of St. Cyril were thundered from every pulpit; and the sacred\r\n      edifices, with the patrimony of the church, were restored to the\r\n      national communion of the Jacobites, who enjoyed without\r\n      moderation the moment of triumph and revenge. At the pressing\r\n      summons of Amrou, their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his\r\n      desert; and after the first interview, the courteous Arab\r\n      affected to declare that he had never conversed with a Christian\r\n      priest of more innocent manners and a more venerable aspect. 110\r\n      In the march from Memphis to Alexandria, the lieutenant of Omar\r\n      intrusted his safety to the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians:\r\n      the roads and bridges were diligently repaired; and in every step\r\n      of his progress, he could depend on a constant supply of\r\n      provisions and intelligence. The Greeks of Egypt, whose numbers\r\n      could scarcely equal a tenth of the natives, were overwhelmed by\r\n      the universal defection: they had ever been hated, they were no\r\n      longer feared: the magistrate fled from his tribunal, the bishop\r\n      from his altar; and the distant garrisons were surprised or\r\n      starved by the surrounding multitudes. Had not the Nile afforded\r\n      a safe and ready conveyance to the sea, not an individual could\r\n      have escaped, who by birth, or language, or office, or religion,\r\n      was connected with their odious name.\r\n\r\n      107 (return) [ See Herodotus, l. iii. c. 27, 28, 29.

In their annals\r\n      of conquest, the siege of Alexandria 111 is perhaps the most\r\n      arduous and important enterprise. The first trading city in the\r\n      world was abundantly replenished with the means of subsistence\r\n      and defence. Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest of\r\n      human rights, religion and property; and the enmity of the\r\n      natives seemed to exclude them from the common benefit of peace\r\n      and toleration. The sea was continually open; and if Heraclius\r\n      had been awake to the public distress, fresh armies of Romans and\r\n      Barbarians might have been poured into the harbor to save the\r\n      second capital of the empire. A circumference of ten miles would\r\n      have scattered the forces of the Greeks, and favored the\r\n      stratagems of an active enemy; but the two sides of an oblong\r\n      square were covered by the sea and the Lake Maraeotis, and each\r\n      of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs.\r\n      The efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of\r\n      the attempt and the value of the prize. From the throne of\r\n      Medina, the eyes of Omar were fixed on the camp and city: his\r\n      voice excited to arms the Arabian tribes and the veterans of\r\n      Syria; and the merit of a holy war was recommended by the\r\n      peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious for the ruin or\r\n      expulsion of their tyrants, the faithful natives devoted their\r\n      labors to the service of Amrou: some sparks of martial spirit\r\n      were perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies; and the\r\n      sanguine hopes of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church\r\n      of St. John of Alexandria. Eutychius the patriarch observes, that\r\n      the Saracens fought with the courage of lions: they repulsed the\r\n      frequent and almost daily sallies of the besieged, and soon\r\n      assaulted in their turn the walls and towers of the city. In\r\n      every attack, the sword, the banner of Amrou, glittered in the\r\n      van of the Moslems. On a memorable day, he was betrayed by his\r\n      imprudent valor: his followers who had entered the citadel were\r\n      driven back; and the general, with a friend and slave, remained a\r\n      prisoner in the hands of the Christians. When Amrou was conducted\r\n      before the praefect, he remembered his dignity, and forgot his\r\n      situation: a lofty demeanor, and resolute language, revealed the\r\n      lieutenant of the caliph, and the battle-axe of a soldier was\r\n      already raised to strike off the head of the audacious captive.\r\n      His life was saved by the readiness of his slave, who instantly\r\n      gave his master a blow on the face, and commanded him, with an\r\n      angry tone, to be silent in the presence of his superiors. The\r\n      credulous Greek was deceived: he listened to the offer of a\r\n      treaty, and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more\r\n      respectable embassy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp\r\n      announced the return of their general, and insulted the folly of\r\n      the infidels. At length, after a siege of fourteen months, 112\r\n      and the loss of three-and-twenty thousand men, the Saracens\r\n      prevailed: the Greeks embarked their dispirited and diminished\r\n      numbers, and the standard of Mahomet was planted on the walls of\r\n      the capital of Egypt. “I have taken,” said Amrou to the caliph,\r\n      “the great city of the West. It is impossible for me to enumerate\r\n      the variety of its riches and beauty; and I shall content myself\r\n      with observing, that it contains four thousand palaces, four\r\n      thousand baths, four hundred theatres or places of amusement,\r\n      twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food, and forty\r\n      thousand tributary Jews. The town has been subdued by force of\r\n      arms, without treaty or capitulation, and the Moslems are\r\n      impatient to seize the fruits of their victory.” 113 The\r\n      commander of the faithful rejected with firmness the idea of\r\n      pillage, and directed his lieutenant to reserve the wealth and\r\n      revenue of Alexandria for the public service and the propagation\r\n      of the faith: the inhabitants were numbered; a tribute was\r\n      imposed, the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites were curbed,\r\n      and the Melchites who submitted to the Arabian yoke were indulged\r\n      in the obscure but tranquil exercise of their worship. The\r\n      intelligence of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted\r\n      the declining health of the emperor; and Heraclius died of a\r\n      dropsy about seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria. 114 Under\r\n      the minority of his grandson, the clamors of a people, deprived\r\n      of their daily sustenance, compelled the Byzantine court to\r\n      undertake the recovery of the capital of Egypt. In the space of\r\n      four years, the harbor and fortifications of Alexandria were\r\n      twice occupied by a fleet and army of Romans. They were twice\r\n      expelled by the valor of Amrou, who was recalled by the domestic\r\n      peril from the distant wars of Tripoli and Nubia. But the\r\n      facility of the attempt, the repetition of the insult, and the\r\n      obstinacy of the resistance, provoked him to swear, that if a\r\n      third time he drove the infidels into the sea, he would render\r\n      Alexandria as accessible on all sides as the house of a\r\n      prostitute. Faithful to his promise, he dismantled several parts\r\n      of the walls and towers; but the people was spared in the\r\n      chastisement of the city, and the mosch of Mercy was erected on\r\n      the spot where the victorious general had stopped the fury of his\r\n      troops.\r\n\r\n      111 (return) [ The local description of Alexandria is perfectly\r\n      ascertained by the master hand of the first of geographers,\r\n      (D’Anville, Memoire sur l’Egypte, p. 52-63;) but we may borrow\r\n      the eyes of the modern travellers, more especially of Thevenot,\r\n      (Voyage au Levant, part i. p. 381-395,) Pocock, (vol. i. p.\r\n      2-13,) and Niebuhr, (Voyage en Arabie, tom. i. p. 34-43.)

The spirit of Amrou was more\r\n      curious and liberal than that of his brethren, and in his leisure\r\n      hours, the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of\r\n      John, the last disciple of Ammonius, and who derived the surname\r\n      of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and\r\n      philosophy. 115 Emboldened by this familiar intercourse,\r\n      Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in his\r\n      opinion, contemptible in that of the Barbarians—the royal\r\n      library, which alone, among the spoils of Alexandria, had not\r\n      been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror.\r\n\r\n      Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his\r\n      rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without\r\n      the consent of the caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was\r\n      inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic. “If these writings of the\r\n      Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless, and need not\r\n      be preserved: if they disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to\r\n      be destroyed.” The sentence was executed with blind obedience:\r\n      the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four\r\n      thousand baths of the city; and such was their incredible\r\n      multitude, that six months were barely sufficient for the\r\n      consumption of this precious fuel. Since the Dynasties of\r\n      Abulpharagius 116 have been given to the world in a Latin\r\n      version, the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every\r\n      scholar, with pious indignation, has deplored the irreparable\r\n      shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and the genius, of\r\n      antiquity. For my own part, I am strongly tempted to deny both\r\n      the fact and the consequences. 1161 The fact is indeed\r\n      marvellous. “Read and wonder!” says the historian himself: and\r\n      the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six\r\n      hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the\r\n      silence of two annalist of a more early date, both Christians,\r\n      both natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the\r\n      patriarch Eutychius, has amply described the conquest of\r\n      Alexandria. 117 The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the\r\n      sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they\r\n      expressly declare, that the religious books of the Jews and\r\n      Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, should never\r\n      be committed to the flames; and that the works of profane\r\n      science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be\r\n      lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. 118 A more\r\n      destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first\r\n      successors of Mahomet; yet in this instance, the conflagration\r\n      would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials. I\r\n      should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library,\r\n      the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own\r\n      defence, 119 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who\r\n      studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry. 120 But if we\r\n      gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of\r\n      Theodosius, we shall learn from a chain of contemporary\r\n      witnesses, that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no\r\n      longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred thousand\r\n      volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and\r\n      magnificence of the Ptolemies. 121 Perhaps the church and seat of\r\n      the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books; but\r\n      if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were\r\n      indeed consumed in the public baths, 122 a philosopher may allow,\r\n      with a smile, that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of\r\n      mankind. I sincerely regret the more valuable libraries which\r\n      have been involved in the ruin of the Roman empire; but when I\r\n      seriously compute the lapse of ages, the waste of ignorance, and\r\n      the calamities of war, our treasures, rather than our losses, are\r\n      the objects of my surprise. Many curious and interesting facts\r\n      are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of Rome have\r\n      been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are\r\n      deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and\r\n      dramatic poetry of the Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember,\r\n      that the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic\r\n      works to which the suffrage of antiquity 123 had adjudged the\r\n      first place of genius and glory: the teachers of ancient\r\n      knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and compared the\r\n      writings of their predecessors; 124 nor can it fairly be presumed\r\n      that any important truth, any useful discovery in art or nature,\r\n      has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages.\r\n\r\n      115 (return) [ Many treatises of this lover of labor are still\r\n      extant, but for readers of the present age, the printed and\r\n      unpublished are nearly in the same predicament.

In the recent tumult of conquest and\r\n      deliverance, the tongue of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs\r\n      were most adverse to the tranquillity of the province. To the\r\n      former, Amrou declared, that faction and falsehood would be\r\n      doubly chastised; by the punishment of the accusers, whom he\r\n      should detest as his personal enemies, and by the promotion of\r\n      their innocent brethren, whom their envy had labored to injure\r\n      and supplant. He excited the latter by the motives of religion\r\n      and honor to sustain the dignity of their character, to endear\r\n      themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the\r\n      caliph, to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their\r\n      faith, and to content themselves with the legitimate and splendid\r\n      rewards of their victory. In the management of the revenue, he\r\n      disapproved the simple but oppressive mode of a capitation, and\r\n      preferred with reason a proportion of taxes deducted on every\r\n      branch from the clear profits of agriculture and commerce. A\r\n      third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual repairs\r\n      of the dikes and canals, so essential to the public welfare.\r\n      Under his administration, the fertility of Egypt supplied the\r\n      dearth of Arabia; and a string of camels, laden with corn and\r\n      provisions, covered almost without an interval the long road from\r\n      Memphis to Medina. 126 But the genius of Amrou soon renewed the\r\n      maritime communication which had been attempted or achieved by\r\n      the Pharaohs the Ptolemies, or the Caesars; and a canal, at least\r\n      eighty miles in length, was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea.\r\n      1261 This inland navigation, which would have joined the\r\n      Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, was soon discontinued as\r\n      useless and dangerous: the throne was removed from Medina to\r\n      Damascus, and the Grecian fleets might have explored a passage to\r\n      the holy cities of Arabia. 127\r\n\r\n      125 (return) [ This curious and authentic intelligence of Murtadi\r\n      (p. 284-289) has not been discovered either by Mr. Ockley, or by\r\n      the self-sufficient compilers of the Modern Universal History.]\r\n\r\n      126 (return) [ Eutychius, Annal. tom. ii. p. 320.

Even the supine Turks have agitated\r\n      the old project of joining the two seas. (Memoires du Baron de\r\n      Tott, tom. iv.)]\r\n\r\n      Of his new conquest, the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge\r\n      from the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran. He requested\r\n      that his lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of\r\n      Pharaoh and the Amalekites; and the answer of Amrou exhibits a\r\n      lively and not unfaithful picture of that singular country. 128\r\n      “O commander of the faithful, Egypt is a compound of black earth\r\n      and green plants, between a pulverized mountain and a red sand.\r\n      The distance from Syene to the sea is a month’s journey for a\r\n      horseman. Along the valley descends a river, on which the\r\n      blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and\r\n      morning, and which rises and falls with the revolutions of the\r\n      sun and moon. When the annual dispensation of Providence unlocks\r\n      the springs and fountains that nourish the earth, the Nile rolls\r\n      his swelling and sounding waters through the realm of Egypt: the\r\n      fields are overspread by the salutary flood; and the villages\r\n      communicate with each other in their painted barks. The retreat\r\n      of the inundation deposits a fertilizing mud for the reception of\r\n      the various seeds: the crowds of husbandmen who blacken the land\r\n      may be compared to a swarm of industrious ants; and their native\r\n      indolence is quickened by the lash of the task-master, and the\r\n      promise of the flowers and fruits of a plentiful increase. Their\r\n      hope is seldom deceived; but the riches which they extract from\r\n      the wheat, the barley, and the rice, the legumes, the\r\n      fruit-trees, and the cattle, are unequally shared between those\r\n      who labor and those who possess. According to the vicissitudes of\r\n      the seasons, the face of the country is adorned with a silver\r\n      wave, a verdant emerald, and the deep yellow of a golden\r\n      harvest.” 129 Yet this beneficial order is sometimes interrupted;\r\n      and the long delay and sudden swell of the river in the first\r\n      year of the conquest might afford some color to an edifying\r\n      fable. It is said, that the annual sacrifice of a virgin 130 had\r\n      been interdicted by the piety of Omar; and that the Nile lay\r\n      sullen and inactive in his shallow bed, till the mandate of the\r\n      caliph was cast into the obedient stream, which rose in a single\r\n      night to the height of sixteen cubits. The admiration of the\r\n      Arabs for their new conquest encouraged the license of their\r\n      romantic spirit. We may read, in the gravest authors, that Egypt\r\n      was crowded with twenty thousand cities or villages: 131 that,\r\n      exclusive of the Greeks and Arabs, the Copts alone were found, on\r\n      the assessment, six millions of tributary subjects, 132 or twenty\r\n      millions of either sex, and of every age: that three hundred\r\n      millions of gold or silver were annually paid to the treasury of\r\n      the caliphs. 133 Our reason must be startled by these extravagant\r\n      assertions; and they will become more palpable, if we assume the\r\n      compass and measure the extent of habitable ground: a valley from\r\n      the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve miles, and the\r\n      triangle of the Delta, a flat surface of two thousand one hundred\r\n      square leagues, compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of\r\n      France. 134 A more accurate research will justify a more\r\n      reasonable estimate. The three hundred millions, created by the\r\n      error of a scribe, are reduced to the decent revenue of four\r\n      millions three hundred thousand pieces of gold, of which nine\r\n      hundred thousand were consumed by the pay of the soldiers. 135\r\n      Two authentic lists, of the present and of the twelfth century,\r\n      are circumscribed within the respectable number of two thousand\r\n      seven hundred villages and towns. 136 After a long residence at\r\n      Cairo, a French consul has ventured to assign about four millions\r\n      of Mahometans, Christians, and Jews, for the ample, though not\r\n      incredible, scope of the population of Egypt. 137\r\n\r\n      128 (return) [ A small volume, des Merveilles, &c., de l’Egypte,\r\n      composed in the xiiith century by Murtadi of Cairo, and\r\n      translated from an Arabic Ms. of Cardinal Mazarin, was published\r\n      by Pierre Vatier, Paris, 1666.

The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean,\r\n      138 was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman.\r\n\r\n      The pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and\r\n      the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from\r\n      Medina, with the gifts and the blessing of the commander of the\r\n      faithful. They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty\r\n      thousand of their countrymen; and the conduct of the war was\r\n      intrusted to Abdallah, 139 the son of Said and the foster-brother\r\n      of the caliph, who had lately supplanted the conqueror and\r\n      lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favor of the prince, and the merit\r\n      of his favorite, could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy.\r\n      The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had\r\n      recommended him to the important office of transcribing the\r\n      sheets of the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text,\r\n      derided the errors which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape\r\n      the justice, and expose the ignorance, of the apostle. After the\r\n      conquest of Mecca, he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet; his\r\n      tears, and the entreaties of Othman, extorted a reluctant pardon;\r\n      but the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated, to allow\r\n      time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood\r\n      of the apostate. With apparent fidelity and effective merit, he\r\n      served the religion which it was no longer his interest to\r\n      desert: his birth and talents gave him an honorable rank among\r\n      the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned\r\n      as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia. At the head\r\n      of forty thousand Moslems, he advanced from Egypt into the\r\n      unknown countries of the West. The sands of Barca might be\r\n      impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by their\r\n      faithful camels; and the natives of the desert beheld without\r\n      terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate. After a\r\n      painful march, they pitched their tents before the walls of\r\n      Tripoli, 140 a maritime city in which the name, the wealth, and\r\n      the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred, and which\r\n      now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary. A\r\n      reenforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the\r\n      sea-shore; but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first\r\n      assaults; and the Saracens were tempted by the approach of the\r\n      praefect Gregory 141 to relinquish the labors of the siege for\r\n      the perils and the hopes of a decisive action. If his standard\r\n      was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men, the regular\r\n      bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and\r\n      disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors, who formed the strength,\r\n      or rather the numbers, of his host. He rejected with indignation\r\n      the option of the Koran or the tribute; and during several days\r\n      the two armies were fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to\r\n      the hour of noon, when their fatigue and the excessive heat\r\n      compelled them to seek shelter and refreshment in their\r\n      respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid of incomparable\r\n      beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side: from her\r\n      earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to draw the\r\n      bow, and to wield the cimeter; and the richness of her arms and\r\n      apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle. Her\r\n      hand, with a hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the\r\n      head of the Arabian general, and the youths of Africa were\r\n      excited by the prospect of the glorious prize. At the pressing\r\n      solicitation of his brethren, Abdallah withdrew his person from\r\n      the field; but the Saracens were discouraged by the retreat of\r\n      their leader, and the repetition of these equal or unsuccessful\r\n      conflicts.\r\n\r\n      138 (return) [ My conquest of Africa is drawn from two French\r\n      interpreters of Arabic literature, Cardonne (Hist. de l’Afrique\r\n      et de l’Espagne sous la Domination des Arabes, tom. i. p. 8-55)\r\n      and Otter, (Hist. de l’Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxi. p.\r\n      111-125, and 136.)

He brands the praefect with the name: he\r\n      had probably assumed the purple, (Chronograph. p. 285.)]\r\n\r\n      A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of Ali, and\r\n      the father of a caliph, had signalized his valor in Egypt, and\r\n      Zobeir 142 was the first who planted the scaling-ladder against\r\n      the walls of Babylon. In the African war he was detached from the\r\n      standard of Abdallah. On the news of the battle, Zobeir, with\r\n      twelve companions, cut his way through the camp of the Greeks,\r\n      and pressed forwards, without tasting either food or repose, to\r\n      partake of the dangers of his brethren. He cast his eyes round\r\n      the field: “Where,” said he, “is our general?” “In his tent.” “Is\r\n      the tent a station for the general of the Moslems?” Abdallah\r\n      represented with a blush the importance of his own life, and the\r\n      temptation that was held forth by the Roman praefect. “Retort,”\r\n      said Zobeir, “on the infidels their ungenerous attempt. Proclaim\r\n      through the ranks that the head of Gregory shall be repaid with\r\n      his captive daughter, and the equal sum of one hundred thousand\r\n      pieces of gold.” To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the\r\n      lieutenant of the caliph intrusted the execution of his own\r\n      stratagem, which inclined the long-disputed balance in favor of\r\n      the Saracens. Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency\r\n      of numbers, a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents,\r\n      while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with the\r\n      enemy till the sun was high in the heavens. On both sides they\r\n      retired with fainting steps: their horses were unbridled, their\r\n      armor was laid aside, and the hostile nations prepared, or seemed\r\n      to prepare, for the refreshment of the evening, and the encounter\r\n      of the ensuing day. On a sudden the charge was sounded; the\r\n      Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors;\r\n      and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised,\r\n      assaulted, overturned, by new squadrons of the faithful, who, to\r\n      the eye of fanaticism, might appear as a band of angels\r\n      descending from the sky. The praefect himself was slain by the\r\n      hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who sought revenge and death, was\r\n      surrounded and made prisoner; and the fugitives involved in their\r\n      disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the\r\n      sabres and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred\r\n      and fifty miles to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is\r\n      watered by a running stream, and shaded by a grove of\r\n      juniper-trees; and, in the ruins of a triumpha arch, a portico,\r\n      and three temples of the Corinthian order, curiosity may yet\r\n      admire the magnificence of the Romans. 143 After the fall of this\r\n      opulent city, the provincials and Barbarians implored on all\r\n      sides the mercy of the conqueror. His vanity or his zeal might be\r\n      flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his\r\n      losses, his fatigues, and the progress of an epidemical disease,\r\n      prevented a solid establishment; and the Saracens, after a\r\n      campaign of fifteen months, retreated to the confines of Egypt,\r\n      with the captives and the wealth of their African expedition. The\r\n      caliph’s fifth was granted to a favorite, on the nominal payment\r\n      of five hundred thousand pieces of gold; 144 but the state was\r\n      doubly injured by this fallacious transaction, if each\r\n      foot-soldier had shared one thousand, and each horseman three\r\n      thousand, pieces, in the real division of the plunder. The author\r\n      of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most\r\n      precious reward of the victory: from his silence it might be\r\n      presumed that he had fallen in the battle, till the tears and\r\n      exclamations of the praefect’s daughter at the sight of Zobeir\r\n      revealed the valor and modesty of that gallant soldier. The\r\n      unfortunate virgin was offered, and almost rejected as a slave,\r\n      by her father’s murderer, who coolly declared that his sword was\r\n      consecrated to the service of religion; and that he labored for a\r\n      recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty, or the riches\r\n      of this transitory life. A reward congenial to his temper was the\r\n      honorable commission of announcing to the caliph Othman the\r\n      success of his arms. The companions the chiefs, and the people,\r\n      were assembled in the mosch of Medina, to hear the interesting\r\n      narrative of Zobeir; and as the orator forgot nothing except the\r\n      merit of his own counsels and actions, the name of Abdallah was\r\n      joined by the Arabians with the heroic names of Caled and Amrou.\r\n      145\r\n\r\n      142 (return) [ See in Ockley (Hist. of the Saracens, vol. ii. p.\r\n      45) the death of Zobeir, which was honored with the tears of Ali,\r\n      against whom he had rebelled.

D. 665-689.] The western conquests of the Saracens were\r\n      suspended near twenty years, till their dissensions were composed\r\n      by the establishment of the house of Ommiyah; and the caliph\r\n      Moawiyah was invited by the cries of the Africans themselves. The\r\n      successors of Heraclius had been informed of the tribute which\r\n      they had been compelled to stipulate with the Arabs; but instead\r\n      of being moved to pity and relieve their distress, they imposed,\r\n      as an equivalent or a fine, a second tribute of a similar amount.\r\n      The ears of the zantine ministers were shut against the\r\n      complaints of their poverty and ruin their despair was reduced to\r\n      prefer the dominion of a single master; and the extortions of the\r\n      patriarch of Carthage, who was invested with civil and military\r\n      power, provoked the sectaries, and even the Catholics, of the\r\n      Roman province to abjure the religion as well as the authority of\r\n      their tyrants. The first lieutenant of Moawiyah acquired a just\r\n      renown, subdued an important city, defeated an army of thirty\r\n      thousand Greeks, swept away fourscore thousand captives, and\r\n      enriched with their spoils the bold adventurers of Syria and\r\n      Egypt.146 But the title of conqueror of Africa is more justly due\r\n      to his successor Akbah. He marched from Damascus at the head of\r\n      ten thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the genuine force of the\r\n      Moslems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many\r\n      thousand Barbarians. It would be difficult, nor is it necessary,\r\n      to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah. The interior\r\n      regions have been peopled by the Orientals with fictitious armies\r\n      and imaginary citadels. In the warlike province of Zab or\r\n      Numidia, fourscore thousand of the natives might assemble in\r\n      arms; but the number of three hundred and sixty towns is\r\n      incompatible with the ignorance or decay of husbandry;147 and a\r\n      circumference of three leagues will not be justified by the ruins\r\n      of Erbe or Lambesa, the ancient metropolis of that inland\r\n      country. As we approach the seacoast, the well-known titles of\r\n      Bugia,148 and Tangier149 define the more certain limits of the\r\n      Saracen victories. A remnant of trade still adheres to the\r\n      commodious harbour of Bugia, which, in a more prosperous age, is\r\n      said to have contained about twenty thousand houses; and the\r\n      plenty of iron which is dug from the adjacent mountains might\r\n      have supplied a braver people with the instruments of defence.\r\n      The remote position and venerable antiquity of Tingi, or Tangier,\r\n      have been decorated by the Greek and Arabian fables; but the\r\n      figurative expressions of the latter, that the walls were\r\n      constructed of brass, and that the roofs were covered with gold\r\n      and silver, may be interpreted as the emblems of strength and\r\n      opulence.\r\n\r\n      146 (return) [ Theophanes (in Chronograph. p. 293.) inserts the\r\n      vague rumours that might reach Constantinople, of the western\r\n      conquests of the Arabs; and I learn from Paul Warnefrid, deacon\r\n      of Aquileia (de Gestis Langobard. 1. v. c. 13), that at this time\r\n      they sent a fleet from Alexandria into the Sicilian and African\r\n      seas.]\r\n\r\n      147 (return) [ See Novairi (apud Otter, p. 118), Leo Africanus\r\n      (fol. 81, verso), who reckoned only cinque citta e infinite\r\n      casal, Marmol (Description de l’Afrique, tom. iii. p. 33,) and\r\n      Shaw (Travels, p. 57, 65-68)]\r\n\r\n      148 (return) [ Leo African. fol. 58, verso, 59, recto.

The river Suz\r\n      descends from the western sides of mount Atlas, fertilizes, like\r\n      the Nile, the adjacent soil, and falls into the sea at a moderate\r\n      distance from the Canary, or adjacent islands. Its banks were\r\n      inhabited by the last of the Moors, a race of savages, without\r\n      laws, or discipline, or religion: they were astonished by the\r\n      strange and irresistible terrors of the Oriental arms; and as\r\n      they possessed neither gold nor silver, the richest spoil was the\r\n      beauty of the female captives, some of whom were afterward sold\r\n      for a thousand pieces of gold. The career, though not the zeal,\r\n      of Akbah was checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean. He\r\n      spurred his horse into the waves, and raising his eyes to heaven,\r\n      exclaimed with the tone of a fanatic: “Great God! if my course\r\n      were not stopped by this sea, I would still go on, to the unknown\r\n      kingdoms of the West, preaching the unity of thy holy name, and\r\n      putting to the sword the rebellious nations who worship another\r\n      gods than thee.” 153 Yet this Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for\r\n      new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the\r\n      universal defection of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled\r\n      from the shores of the Atlantic, and the surrounding multitudes\r\n      left him only the resource of an honourable death. The last scene\r\n      was dignified by an example of national virtue. An ambitious\r\n      chief, who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt,\r\n      was led about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general.\r\n      The insurgents had trusted to his discontent and revenge; he\r\n      disdained their offers and revealed their designs. In the hour of\r\n      danger, the grateful Akbah unlocked his fetters, and advised him\r\n      to retire; he chose to die under the banner of his rival.\r\n      Embracing as friends and martyrs, they unsheathed their\r\n      scimeters, broke their scabbards, and maintained an obstinate\r\n      combat, till they fell by each other’s side on the last of their\r\n      slaughtered countrymen. The third general or governor of Africa,\r\n      Zuheir, avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor. He\r\n      vanquished the natives in many battles; he was overthrown by a\r\n      powerful army, which Constantinople had sent to the relief of\r\n      Carthage.\r\n\r\n      150 (return) [ Regio ignobilis, et vix quicquam illustre sortita,\r\n      parvis oppidis habitatur, parva flumina emittit, solo quam viris\r\n      meleor et segnitie gentis obscura.

The\r\n      prudence of Akbah had proposed to found an Arabian colony in the\r\n      heart of Africa; a citadel that might curb the levity of the\r\n      Barbarians, a place of refuge to secure, against the accidents of\r\n      war, the wealth and the families of the Saracens. With this view,\r\n      and under the modest title of the station of a caravan, he\r\n      planted this colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira. In its\r\n      present decay, Cairoan154 still holds the second rank in the\r\n      kingdom of Tunis, from which it is distant about fifty miles to\r\n      the south;155 its inland situation, twelve miles westward of the\r\n      sea, has protected the city from the Greek and Sicilian fleets.\r\n      When the wild beasts and serpents were extirpated, when the\r\n      forest, or rather wilderness, was cleared, the vestiges of a\r\n      Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain: the vegetable food\r\n      of Cairoan is brought from afar; and the scarcity of springs\r\n      constrains the inhabitants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs\r\n      a precarious supply of rain water. These obstacles were subdued\r\n      by the industry of Akbah; he traced a circumference of three\r\n      thousand and six hundred paces, which he encompassed with a brick\r\n      wall; in the space of five years, the governor’s palace was\r\n      surrounded with a sufficient number of private habitations; a\r\n      spacious mosque was supported by five hundred columns of granite,\r\n      porphyry, and Numidian marble; and Cairoan became the seat of\r\n      learning as well as of empire. But these were the glories of a\r\n      later age; the new colony was shaken by the successive defeats of\r\n      Akbah and Zuheir, and the western expeditions were again\r\n      interrupted by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy. The son\r\n      of the valiant Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years, a siege\r\n      of seven months against the house of Ommiyah. Abdallah was said\r\n      to unite the fierceness of the lion with the subtlety of the fox;\r\n      but if he inherited the courage, he was devoid of the generosity,\r\n      of his father.156\r\n\r\n      [A. D. 692-698.] The return of domestic peace allowed the caliph\r\n      Abdalmalek to resume the conquest of Africa; the standard was\r\n      delivered to Hassan governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that\r\n      kingdom, with an army of forty thousand men, was consecrated to\r\n      the important service. In the vicissitudes of war, the interior\r\n      provinces had been alternately won and lost by the Saracens. But\r\n      the seacoast still remained in the hands of the Greeks; the\r\n      predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and fortifications\r\n      of Carthage; and the number of its defenders was recruited by the\r\n      fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli. The arms of Hassan were bolder\r\n      and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of\r\n      Africa; and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the\r\n      suspicion, that he anticipated, by a sudden assault, the more\r\n      tedious operations of a regular siege. But the joy of the\r\n      conquerors was soon disturbed by the appearance of the Christian\r\n      succours. The praefect and patrician John, a general of\r\n      experience and renown, embarked at Constantinople the forces of\r\n      the Eastern empire;157 they were joined by the ships and soldiers\r\n      of Sicily, and a powerful reinforcement of Goths158 was obtained\r\n      from the fears and religion of the Spanish monarch.\r\n\r\n      154 (return) [ The foundation of Cairoan is mentioned by Ockley\r\n      (Hist. of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 129, 130); and the situation,\r\n      mosque, &c. of the city are described by Leo Africanus (fol. 75),\r\n      Marmol (tom. ii. p. 532), and Shaw (p. 115).]\r\n\r\n      155 (return) [ A portentous, though frequent mistake, has been\r\n      the confounding, from a slight similitude of name, the Cyrene of\r\n      the Greeks, and the Cairoan of the Arabs, two cities which are\r\n      separated by an interval of a thousand miles along the seacoast.\r\n      The great Thuanus has not escaped this fault, the less excusable\r\n      as it is connected with a formal and elaborate description of\r\n      Africa (Historiar. l. vii. c. 2, in tom. i. p. 240, edit.\r\n      Buckley).]\r\n\r\n      156 (return) [ Besides the Arabic Chronicles of Abulfeda,\r\n      Elmacin, and Abulpharagius, under the lxxiiid year of the Hegira,\r\n      we may consult nd’Herbelot (Bibliot.

But Africa was irrecoverably lost: the zeal and\r\n      resentment of the commander of the faithful159 prepared in the\r\n      ensuing spring a more numerous armament by sea and land; and the\r\n      patrician in his turn was compelled to evacuate the post and\r\n      fortifications of Carthage. A second battle was fought in the\r\n      neighbourhood of Utica; and the Greeks and Goths were again\r\n      defeated; and their timely embarkation saved them from the sword\r\n      of Hassan, who had invested the slight and insufficient rampart\r\n      of their camp. Whatever yet remained of Carthage was delivered to\r\n      the flames, and the colony of Dido160 and Cesar lay desolate\r\n      above two hundred years, till a part, perhaps a twentieth, of the\r\n      old circumference was repeopled by the first of the Fatimite\r\n      caliphs. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the second\r\n      capital of the West was represented by a mosque, a college\r\n      without students, twenty-five or thirty shops, and the huts of\r\n      five hundred peasants, who, in their abject poverty, displayed\r\n      the arrogance of the Punic senators. Even that paltry village was\r\n      swept away by the Spaniards whom Charles the Fifth had stationed\r\n      in the fortress of the Goletta.

In the interior provinces the\r\n      Moors or Berbers,162 so feeble under the first Cesars, so\r\n      formidable to the Byzantine princes, maintained a disorderly\r\n      resistance to the religion and power of the successors of\r\n      Mahomet. Under the standard of their queen Cahina, the\r\n      independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline;\r\n      and as the Moors respected in their females the character of a\r\n      prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar\r\n      to their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the\r\n      defence of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single\r\n      day; and the Arabian chief, overwhelmed by the torrent, retired\r\n      to the confines of Egypt, and expected, five years, the promised\r\n      succours of the caliph. After the retreat of the Saracens, the\r\n      victorious prophetess assembled the Moorish chiefs, and\r\n      recommended a measure of strange and savage policy. “Our cities,”\r\n      said she, “and the gold and silver which they contain,\r\n      perpetually attract the arms of the Arabs. These vile metals are\r\n      not the objects of OUR ambition; we content ourselves with the\r\n      simple productions of the earth.

From Tangier\r\n      to Tripoli the buildings, or at least the fortifications, were\r\n      demolished, the fruit-trees were cut down, the means of\r\n      subsistence were extirpated, a fertile and populous garden was\r\n      changed into a desert, and the historians of a more recent period\r\n      could discern the frequent traces of the prosperity and\r\n      devastation of their ancestors.\r\n\r\n      159 (return) [ This commander is styled by Nicephorus, ———— a\r\n      vague though not improper definition of the caliph.

In the time of Homer, when the Greeks and\r\n      Asiatics might probably use a common idiom, the imitative sound\r\n      of Barbar was applied to the ruder tribes, whose pronunciation\r\n      was most harsh, whose grammar was most defective. 2. From the\r\n      time, at least, of Herodotus, it was extended to all the nations\r\n      who were strangers to the language and manners of the Greeks. 3.\r\n      In the age, of Plautus, the Romans submitted to the insult\r\n      (Pompeius Festus, l. ii. p. 48, edit. Dacier), and freely gave\r\n      themselves the name of Barbarians. They insensibly claimed an\r\n      exemption for Italy, and her subject provinces; and at length\r\n      removed the disgraceful appellation to the savage or hostile\r\n      nations beyond the pale of the empire. 4. In every sense, it was\r\n      due to the Moors; the familiar word was borrowed from the Latin\r\n      Provincials by the Arabian conquerors, and has justly settled as\r\n      a local denomination (Barbary) along the northern coast of\r\n      Africa.]\r\n\r\n      Such is the tale of the modern Arabians. Yet I strongly suspect\r\n      that their ignorance of antiquity, the love of the marvellous,\r\n      and the fashion of extolling the philosophy of Barbarians, has\r\n      induced them to describe, as one voluntary act, the calamities of\r\n      three hundred years since the first fury of the Donatists and\r\n      Vandals. In the progress of the revolt, Cahina had most probably\r\n      contributed her share of destruction; and the alarm of universal\r\n      ruin might terrify and alienate the cities that had reluctantly\r\n      yielded to her unworthy yoke. They no longer hoped, perhaps they\r\n      no longer wished, the return of their Byzantine sovereigns: their\r\n      present servitude was not alleviated by the benefits of order and\r\n      justice; and the most zealous Catholic must prefer the imperfect\r\n      truths of the Koran to the blind and rude idolatry of the Moors.\r\n      The general of the Saracens was again received as the saviour of\r\n      the province; the friends of civil society conspired against the\r\n      savages of the land; and the royal prophetess was slain in the\r\n      first battle which overturned the baseless fabric of her\r\n      superstition and empire. The same spirit revived under the\r\n      successor of Hassan; it was finally quelled by the activity of\r\n      Musa and his two sons; but the number of the rebels may be\r\n      presumed from that of three hundred thousand captives; sixty\r\n      thousand of whom, the caliph’s fifth, were sold for the profit of\r\n      thee public treasury. Thirty thousand of the Barbarian youth were\r\n      enlisted in the troops; and the pious labours of Musa to\r\n      inculcate the knowledge and practice of the Koran, accustomed the\r\n      Africans to obey the apostle of God and the commander of the\r\n      faithful. In their climate and government, their diet and\r\n      habitation, the wandering Moors resembled the Bedoweens of the\r\n      desert. With the religion, they were proud to adopt the language,\r\n      name, and origin of Arabs: the blood of the strangers and natives\r\n      was insensibly mingled; and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic\r\n      the same nation might seem to be diffused over the sandy plains\r\n      of Asia and Africa. Yet I will not deny that fifty thousand tents\r\n      of pure Arabians might be transported over the Nile, and\r\n      scattered through the Lybian desert: and I am not ignorant that\r\n      five of the Moorish tribes still retain their barbarous idiom,\r\n      with the appellation and character of white Africans.163\r\n\r\n      [A. D. 709.] V. In the progress of conquest from the north and\r\n      south, the Goths and the Saracens encountered each other on the\r\n      confines of Europe and Africa. In the opinion of the latter, the\r\n      difference of religion is a reasonable ground of enmity and\r\n      warfare.164 As early as the time of Othman165 their piratical\r\n      squadrons had ravaged the coast of Andalusia;166 nor had they\r\n      forgotten the relief of Carthage by the Gothic succours. In that\r\n      age, as well as in the present, the kings of Spain were possessed\r\n      of the fortress of Ceuta; one of the columns of Hercules, which\r\n      is divided by a narrow strait from the opposite pillar or point\r\n      of Europe. A small portion of Mauritania was still wanting to the\r\n      African conquest; but Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed\r\n      from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and courage of count\r\n      Julian, the general of the Goths. From his disappointment and\r\n      perplexity, Musa was relieved by an unexpected message of the\r\n      Christian chief, who offered his place, his person, and his\r\n      sword, to the successors of Mahomet, and solicited the\r\n      disgraceful honour of introducing their arms into the heart of\r\n      Spain.167\r\n\r\n      163 (return) [ The first book of Leo Africanus, and the\r\n      observations of Dr. Shaw (p. 220. 223. 227. 247, &c.) will throw\r\n      some light on the roving tribes of Barbary, of Arabian or Moorish\r\n      descent.

The passions of princes have often been licentious and\r\n      destructive; but this well-known tale, romantic in itself, is\r\n      indifferently supported by external evidence; and the history of\r\n      Spain will suggest some motives of interest and policy more\r\n      congenial to the breast of a veteran statesman.169 After the\r\n      decease or deposition of Witiza, his two sons were supplanted by\r\n      the ambition of Roderic, a noble Goth, whose father, the duke or\r\n      governor of a province, had fallen a victim to the preceding\r\n      tyranny. The monarchy was still elective; but the sons of Witiza,\r\n      educated on the steps of the throne, were impatient of a private\r\n      station. Their resentment was the more dangerous, as it was\r\n      varnished with the dissimulation of courts: their followers were\r\n      excited by the remembrance of favours and the promise of a\r\n      revolution: and their uncle Oppas, archbishop of Toledo and\r\n      Seville, was the first person in the church, and the second in\r\n      the state. It is probable that Julian was involved in the\r\n      disgrace of the unsuccessful faction, that he had little to hope\r\n      and much to fear from the new reign; and that the imprudent king\r\n      could not forget or forgive the injuries which Roderic and his\r\n      family had sustained. The merit and influence of the count\r\n      rendered him a useful or formidable subject: his estates were\r\n      ample, his followers bold and numerous, and it was too fatally\r\n      shown that, by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, he held\r\n      in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy. Too feeble,\r\n      however, to meet his sovereign in arms, he sought the aid of a\r\n      foreign power; and his rash invitation of the Moors and Arabs\r\n      produced the calamities of eight hundred years. In his epistles,\r\n      or in a personal interview, he revealed the wealth and nakedness\r\n      of his country; the weakness of an unpopular prince; the\r\n      degeneracy of an effeminate people. The Goths were no longer the\r\n      victorious Barbarians, who had humbled the pride of Rome,\r\n      despoiled the queen of nations, and penetrated from the Danube to\r\n      the Atlantic ocean. Secluded from the world by the Pyrenean\r\n      mountains, the successors of Alaric had slumbered in a long\r\n      peace: the walls of the city were mouldered into dust: the youth\r\n      had abandoned the exercise of arms; and the presumption of their\r\n      ancient renown would expose them in a field of battle to the\r\n      first assault of the invaders. The ambitious Saracen was fired by\r\n      the ease and importance of the attempt; but the execution was\r\n      delayed till he had consulted the commander of the faithful; and\r\n      his messenger returned with the permission of Walid to annex the\r\n      unknown kingdoms of the West to the religion and throne of the\r\n      caliphs.

D. 710.] Before Musa would trust an army of the faithful to\r\n      the traitors and infidels of a foreign land, he made a less\r\n      dangerous trial of their strength and veracity. One hundred Arabs\r\n      and four hundred Africans, passed over, in four vessels, from\r\n      Tangier or Ceuta; the place of their descent on the opposite\r\n      shore of the strait, is marked by the name of Tarif their chief;\r\n      and the date of this memorable event171 is fixed to the month of\r\n      Ramandan, of the ninety-first year of the Hegira, to the month of\r\n      July, seven hundred and forty-eight years from the Spanish era of\r\n      Cesar,172 seven hundred and ten after the birth of Christ. From\r\n      their first station, they marched eighteen miles through a hilly\r\n      country to the castle and town of Julian;173 on which (it is\r\n      still called Algezire) they bestowed the name of the Green\r\n      Island, from a verdant cape that advances into the sea. Their\r\n      hospitable entertainment, the Christians who joined their\r\n      standard, their inroad into a fertile and unguarded province, the\r\n      richness of their spoil and the safety of their return, announced\r\n      to their brethren the most favourable omens of victory. In the\r\n      ensuing spring, five thousand veterans and volunteers were\r\n      embarked under the command of Tarik, a dauntless and skilful\r\n      soldier, who surpassed the expectation of his chief; and the\r\n      necessary transports were provided by the industry of their too\r\n      faithful ally. The Saracens landed174 at the pillar or point of\r\n      Europe; the corrupt and familiar appellation of Gibraltar (Gebel\r\n      el Tarik) describes the mountain of Tarik; and the intrenchments\r\n      of his camp were the first outline of those fortifications,\r\n      which, in the hands of our countrymen, have resisted the art and\r\n      power of the house of Bourbon. The adjacent governors informed\r\n      the court of Toledo of the descent and progress of the Arabs; and\r\n      the defeat of his lieutenant Edeco, who had been commanded to\r\n      seize and bind the presumptuous strangers, admonished Roderic of\r\n      the magnitude of the danger. At the royal summons, the dukes and\r\n      counts, the bishops and nobles of the Gothic monarchy assembled\r\n      at the head of their followers; and the title of king of the\r\n      Romans, which is employed by an Arabic historian, may be excused\r\n      by the close affinity of language, religion, and manners, between\r\n      the nations of Spain. His army consisted of ninety or a hundred\r\n      thousand men: a formidable power, if their fidelity and\r\n      discipline had been adequate to their numbers. The troops of\r\n      Tarik had been augmented to twelve thousand Saracens; but the\r\n      Christian malcontents were attracted by the influence of Julian,\r\n      and a crowd of Africans most greedily tasted the temporal\r\n      blessings of the Koran. In the neighbourhood of Cadiz, the town\r\n      of Xeres175 has been illustrated by the encounter which\r\n      determined the fate of the kingdom; the stream of the Guadalete,\r\n      which falls into the bay, divided the two camps, and marked the\r\n      advancing and retreating skirmishes of three successive and\r\n      bloody days.\r\n\r\n      171 (return) [ A mistake of Roderic of Toledo, in comparing the\r\n      lunar years of the Hegira with the Julian years of the Era, has\r\n      determined Baronius, Mariana, and the crowd of Spanish\r\n      historians, to place the first invasion in the year 713, and the\r\n      battle of Xeres in November, 714. This anachronism of three years\r\n      has been detected by the more correct industry of modern\r\n      chronologists, above all, of Pagi (Critics, tom. iii. p. 164.\r\n      171-174), who have restored the genuine state of the revolution.\r\n      At the present time, an Arabian scholar, like Cardonne, who\r\n      adopts the ancient error (tom. i. p. 75), is inexcusably ignorant\r\n      or careless.]\r\n\r\n      172 (return) [ The Era of Cesar, which in Spain was in legal and\r\n      popular use till the xivth century, begins thirty-eight years\r\n      before the birth of Christ.

Nonii Hispania, c. 13, p. 54-56, a work of correct and\r\n      concise knowledge; d’Anville, Etats de l’Europe &c p 154).]\r\n\r\n      On the fourth day, the two armies joined a more serious and\r\n      decisive issue; but Alaric would have blushed at the sight of his\r\n      unworthy successor, sustaining on his head a diadem of pearls,\r\n      encumbered with a flowing robe of gold and silken embroidery, and\r\n      reclining on a litter, or car of ivory, drawn by two white mules.\r\n      Notwithstanding the valour of the Saracens, they fainted under\r\n      the weight of multitudes, and the plain of Xeres was overspread\r\n      with sixteen thousand of their dead bodies. “My brethren,” said\r\n      Tarik to his surviving companions, “the enemy is before you, the\r\n      sea is behind; whither would ye fly? Follow your general I am\r\n      resolved either to lose my life, or to trample on the prostrate\r\n      king of the Romans.” Besides the resource of despair, he confided\r\n      in the secret correspondence and nocturnal interviews of count\r\n      Julian, with the sons and the brother of Witiza. The two princes\r\n      and the archbishop of Toledo occupied the most important post;\r\n      their well-timed defection broke the ranks of the Christians;\r\n      each warrior was prompted by fear or suspicion to consult his\r\n      personal safety; and the remains of the Gothic army were\r\n      scattered or destroyed to the flight and pursuit of the three\r\n      following days. Amidst the general disorder, Roderic started from\r\n      his car, and mounted Orelia, the fleetest of his Horses; but he\r\n      escaped from a soldier’s death to perish more ignobly in the\r\n      waters of the Boetis or Guadalquiver. His diadem, his robes, and\r\n      his courser, were found on the bank; but as the body of the\r\n      Gothic prince was lost in the waves, the pride and ignorance of\r\n      the caliph must have been gratified with some meaner head, which\r\n      was exposed in triumph before the palace of Damascus. “And such,”\r\n      continues a valiant historian of the Arabs, “is the fate of those\r\n      kings who withdraw themselves from a field of battle.” 176\r\n\r\n      [A. D. 711.] Count Julian had plunged so deep into guilt and\r\n      infamy, that his only hope was in the ruin of his country. After\r\n      the battle of Xeres he recommended the most effectual measures to\r\n      the victorious Saracens. “The king of the Goths is slain; their\r\n      princes are fled before you, the army is routed, the nation is\r\n      astonished. Secure with sufficient detachments the cities of\r\n      Boetica; but in person and without delay, march to the royal city\r\n      of Toledo, and allow not the distracted Christians either time or\r\n      tranquillity for the election of a new monarch.” Tarik listened\r\n      to his advice. A Roman captive and proselyte, who had been\r\n      enfranchised by the caliph himself, assaulted Cordova with seven\r\n      hundred horse: he swam the river, surprised the town, and drove\r\n      the Christians into the great church, where they defended\r\n      themselves above three months. Another detachment reduced the\r\n      seacoast of Boetica, which in the last period of the Moorish\r\n      power has comprised in a narrow space the populous kingdom of\r\n      Grenada. The march of Tarik from the Boetis to the Tagus,177 was\r\n      directed through the Sierra Morena, that separates Andalusia and\r\n      Castille, till he appeared in arms under the walls of Toledo.178\r\n      The most zealous of the Catholics had escaped with the relics of\r\n      their saints; and if the gates were shut, it was only till the\r\n      victor had subscribed a fair and reasonable capitulation. The\r\n      voluntary exiles were allowed to depart with their effects; seven\r\n      churches were appropriated to the Christian worship; the\r\n      archbishop and his clergy were at liberty to exercise their\r\n      functions, the monks to practise or neglect their penance; and\r\n      the Goths and Romans were left in all civil or criminal cases to\r\n      the subordinate jurisdiction of their own laws and magistrates.\r\n      But if the justice of Tarik protected the Christians, his\r\n      gratitude and policy rewarded the Jews, to whose secret or open\r\n      aid he was indebted for his most important acquisitions.\r\n      Persecuted by the kings and synods of Spain, who had often\r\n      pressed the alternative of banishment or baptism, that outcast\r\n      nation embraced the moment of revenge: the comparison of their\r\n      past and present state was the pledge of their fidelity; and the\r\n      alliance between the disciples of Moses and those of Mahomet, was\r\n      maintained till the final era of their common expulsion.\r\n\r\n      176 (return) [ Id sane infortunii regibus pedem ex acie\r\n      referentibus saepe contingit.

The failure of land compelled him to retreat: and he was\r\n      recalled to Toledo, to excuse his presumption of subduing a\r\n      kingdom in the absence of his general. Spain, which in a more\r\n      savage and disorderly state, had resisted, two hundred years, the\r\n      arms of the Romans, was overrun in a few months by those of the\r\n      Saracens; and such was the eagerness of submission and treaty,\r\n      that the governor of Cordova is recorded as the only chief who\r\n      fell, without conditions, a prisoner into their hands. The cause\r\n      of the Goths had been irrevocably judged in the field of Xeres;\r\n      and in the national dismay, each part of the monarchy declined a\r\n      contest with the antagonist who had vanquished the united\r\n      strength of the whole.181 That strength had been wasted by two\r\n      successive seasons of famine and pestilence; and the governors,\r\n      who were impatient to surrender, might exaggerate the difficulty\r\n      of collecting the provisions of a siege. To disarm the\r\n      Christians, superstition likewise contributed her terrors: and\r\n      the subtle Arab encouraged the report of dreams, omens, and\r\n      prophecies, and of the portraits of the destined conquerors of\r\n      Spain, that were discovered on the breaking open an apartment of\r\n      the royal palace. Yet a spark of the vital flame was still alive;\r\n      some invincible fugitives preferred a life of poverty and freedom\r\n      in the Asturian valleys; the hardy mountaineers repulsed the\r\n      slaves of the caliph; and the sword of Pelagius has been\r\n      transformed into the sceptre of the Catholic kings.182\r\n\r\n      179 (return) [ In the Historia Arabum (c. 9, p. 17, ad calcem\r\n      Elmacin), Roderic of Toledo describes the emerald tables, and\r\n      inserts the name of Medinat Ahneyda in Arabic words and letters.\r\n      He appears to be conversant with the Mahometan writers; but I\r\n      cannot agree with M. de Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 350)\r\n      that he had read and transcribed Novairi; because he was dead a\r\n      hundred years before Novairi composed his history.

At the head\r\n      of ten thousand Arabs and eight thousand Africans, he passed over\r\n      in person from Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions\r\n      were the noblest of the Koreish; his eldest son was left in the\r\n      command of Africa; the three younger brethren were of an age and\r\n      spirit to second the boldest enterprises of their father. At his\r\n      landing in Algezire, he was respectfully entertained by Count\r\n      Julian, who stifled his inward remorse, and testified, both in\r\n      words and actions, that the victory of the Arabs had not impaired\r\n      his attachment to their cause. Some enemies yet remained for the\r\n      sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths had compared\r\n      their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities from\r\n      which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as\r\n      impregnable; and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications\r\n      of Seville and Merida. They were successively besieged and\r\n      reduced by the labor of Musa, who transported his camp from the\r\n      Boetis to the Anas, from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When\r\n      he beheld the works of Roman magnificence, the bridge, the\r\n      aqueducts, the triumphal arches, and the theatre, of the ancient\r\n      metropolis of Lusitania, “I should imagine,” said he to his four\r\n      companions, “that the human race must have united their art and\r\n      power in the foundation of this city: happy is the man who shall\r\n      become its master!” He aspired to that happiness, but the\r\n      Emeritans sustained on this occasion the honor of their descent\r\n      from the veteran legionaries of Augustus 183 Disdaining the\r\n      confinement of their walls, they gave battle to the Arabs on the\r\n      plain; but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry, or a\r\n      ruin, chastised their indiscretion, and intercepted their return.\r\n\r\n      The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of\r\n      the rampart; but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long;\r\n      and the castle of the martyrs was a perpetual testimony of the\r\n      losses of the Moslems. The constancy of the besieged was at\r\n      length subdued by famine and despair; and the prudent victor\r\n      disguised his impatience under the names of clemency and esteem.\r\n      The alternative of exile or tribute was allowed; the churches\r\n      were divided between the two religions; and the wealth of those\r\n      who had fallen in the siege, or retired to Gallicia, was\r\n      confiscated as the reward of the faithful. In the midway between\r\n      Merida and Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent\r\n      of the caliph, and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic\r\n      kings. Their first interview was cold and formal: a rigid account\r\n      was exacted of the treasures of Spain: the character of Tarik was\r\n      exposed to suspicion and obloquy; and the hero was imprisoned,\r\n      reviled, and ignominiously scourged by the hand, or the command,\r\n      of Musa. Yet so strict was the discipline, so pure the zeal, or\r\n      so tame the spirit, of the primitive Moslems, that, after this\r\n      public indignity, Tarik could serve and be trusted in the\r\n      reduction of the Tarragonest province. A mosch was erected at\r\n      Saragossa, by the liberality of the Koreish: the port of\r\n      Barcelona was opened to the vessels of Syria; and the Goths were\r\n      pursued beyond the Pyrenaean mountains into their Gallic province\r\n      of Septimania or Languedoc. 184 In the church of St. Mary at\r\n      Carcassone, Musa found, but it is improbable that he left, seven\r\n      equestrian statues of massy silver; and from his term or column\r\n      of Narbonne, he returned on his footsteps to the Gallician and\r\n      Lusitanian shores of the ocean. During the absence of the father,\r\n      his son Abdelaziz chastised the insurgents of Seville, and\r\n      reduced, from Malaga to Valentia, the sea-coast of the\r\n      Mediterranean: his original treaty with the discreet and valiant\r\n      Theodemir 185 will represent the manners and policy of the times.\r\n      “The conditions of peace agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz, the\r\n      son of Musa, the son of Nassir, and Theodemir prince of the\r\n      Goths. In the name of the most merciful God, Abdelaziz makes\r\n      peace on these conditions: that Theodemir shall not be disturbed\r\n      in his principality; nor any injury be offered to the life or\r\n      property, the wives and children, the religion and temples, of\r\n      the Christians: that Theodemir shall freely deliver his seven\r\n      1851 cities, Orihuela, Valentola, Alicanti Mola, Vacasora,\r\n      Bigerra, (now Bejar,) Ora, (or Opta,) and Lorca: that he shall\r\n      not assist or entertain the enemies of the caliph, but shall\r\n      faithfully communicate his knowledge of their hostile designs:\r\n      that himself, and each of the Gothic nobles, shall annually pay\r\n      one piece of gold, four measures of wheat, as many of barley,\r\n      with a certain proportion of honey, oil, and vinegar; and that\r\n      each of their vassals shall be taxed at one moiety of the said\r\n      imposition.

Yet if\r\n      we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths, or its recovery by\r\n      the kings of Castile and Arragon, we must applaud the moderation\r\n      and discipline of the Arabian conquerors.\r\n\r\n      183 (return) [ The honorable relics of the Cantabrian war (Dion\r\n      Cassius, l. liii p. 720) were planted in this metropolis of\r\n      Lusitania, perhaps of Spain, (submittit cui tota suos Hispania\r\n      fasces.)

The tax of the churches is fixed at twenty-five pounds\r\n      of gold; of the monasteries, fifty; of the cathedrals, one\r\n      hundred; the Christians are judged by their count, but in capital\r\n      cases he must consult the alcaide.

But in the love of action and\r\n      glory, his breast was still fired with the ardor of youth; and\r\n      the possession of Spain was considered only as the first step to\r\n      the monarchy of Europe. With a powerful armament by sea and land,\r\n      he was preparing to repass the Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul\r\n      and Italy the declining kingdoms of the Franks and Lombards, and\r\n      to preach the unity of God on the altar of the Vatican. From\r\n      thence, subduing the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed to follow\r\n      the course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine Sea, to\r\n      overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, and\r\n      returning from Europe to Asia, to unite his new acquisitions with\r\n      Antioch and the provinces of Syria. 188 But his vast enterprise,\r\n      perhaps of easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar\r\n      minds; and the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his\r\n      dependence and servitude. The friends of Tarik had effectually\r\n      stated his services and wrongs: at the court of Damascus, the\r\n      proceedings of Musa were blamed, his intentions were suspected,\r\n      and his delay in complying with the first invitation was\r\n      chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. An intrepid\r\n      messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia, and\r\n      in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the\r\n      bridle of his horse. His own loyalty, or that of his troops,\r\n      inculcated the duty of obedience: and his disgrace was alleviated\r\n      by the recall of his rival, and the permission of investing with\r\n      his two governments his two sons, Abdallah and Abdelaziz. His\r\n      long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus displayed the spoils of\r\n      Africa and the treasures of Spain: four hundred Gothic nobles,\r\n      with gold coronets and girdles, were distinguished in his train;\r\n      and the number of male and female captives, selected for their\r\n      birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at thirty,\r\n      thousand persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine, he\r\n      was apprised of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a\r\n      private message from Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir;\r\n      who wished to reserve for his own reign the spectacle of victory.\r\n\r\n      Had Walid recovered, the delay of Musa would have been criminal:\r\n      he pursued his march, and found an enemy on the throne. In his\r\n      trial before a partial judge against a popular antagonist, he was\r\n      convicted of vanity and falsehood; and a fine of two hundred\r\n      thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty or proved\r\n      his rapaciousness. The unworthy treatment of Tarik was revenged\r\n      by a similar indignity; and the veteran commander, after a public\r\n      whipping, stood a whole day in the sun before the palace gate,\r\n      till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious name of a\r\n      pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph might have been\r\n      satiated with the ruin of Musa; but his fears demanded the\r\n      extirpation of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death\r\n      was intimated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of\r\n      the throne both in Africa and Spain; and the forms, if not the\r\n      substance, of justice were superseded in this bloody execution.\r\n      In the mosch or palace of Cordova, Abdelaziz was slain by the\r\n      swords of the conspirators; they accused their governor of\r\n      claiming the honors of royalty; and his scandalous marriage with\r\n      Egilona, the widow of Roderic, offended the prejudices both of\r\n      the Christians and Moslems. By a refinement of cruelty, the head\r\n      of the son was presented to the father, with an insulting\r\n      question, whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel? “I\r\n      know his features,” he exclaimed with indignation: “I assert his\r\n      innocence; and I imprecate the same, a juster fate, against the\r\n      authors of his death.” The age and despair of Musa raised him\r\n      above the power of kings; and he expired at Mecca of the anguish\r\n      of a broken heart. His rival was more favorably treated: his\r\n      services were forgiven; and Tarik was permitted to mingle with\r\n      the crowd of slaves. 189 I am ignorant whether Count Julian was\r\n      rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed, though not from\r\n      the hands of the Saracens; but the tale of their ingratitude to\r\n      the sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unquestionable\r\n      evidence. The two royal youths were reinstated in the private\r\n      patrimony of their father; but on the decease of Eba, the elder,\r\n      his daughter was unjustly despoiled of her portion by the\r\n      violence of her uncle Sigebut. The Gothic maid pleaded her cause\r\n      before the caliph Hashem, and obtained the restitution of her\r\n      inheritance; but she was given in marriage to a noble Arabian,\r\n      and their two sons, Isaac and Ibrahim, were received in Spain\r\n      with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches.\r\n\r\n      188 (return) [ This design, which is attested by several Arabian\r\n      historians, (Cardonne, tom. i. p. 95, 96,) may be compared with\r\n      that of Mithridates, to march from the Crimaea to Rome; or with\r\n      that of Caesar, to conquer the East, and return home by the\r\n      North; and all three are perhaps surpassed by the real and\r\n      successful enterprise of Hannibal.]\r\n\r\n      189 (return) [ I much regret our loss, or my ignorance, of two\r\n      Arabic works of the viiith century, a Life of Musa, and a poem on\r\n      the exploits of Tarik. Of these authentic pieces, the former was\r\n      composed by a grandson of Musa, who had escaped from the massacre\r\n      of his kindred; the latter, by the vizier of the first\r\n      Abdalrahman, caliph of Spain, who might have conversed with some\r\n      of the veterans of the conqueror, (Bibliot. Arabico-Hispana, tom.\r\n      ii. p. 36, 139.)]\r\n\r\n      A province is assimilated to the victorious state by the\r\n      introduction of strangers and the imitative spirit of the\r\n      natives; and Spain, which had been successively tinctured with\r\n      Punic, and Roman, and Gothic blood, imbibed, in a few\r\n      generations, the name and manners of the Arabs. The first\r\n      conquerors, and the twenty successive lieutenants of the caliphs,\r\n      were attended by a numerous train of civil and military\r\n      followers, who preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home: the\r\n      private and public interest was promoted by the establishment of\r\n      faithful colonies; and the cities of Spain were proud to\r\n      commemorate the tribe or country of their Eastern progenitors.\r\n      The victorious though motley bands of Tarik and Musa asserted, by\r\n      the name of Spaniards, their original claim of conquest; yet they\r\n      allowed their brethren of Egypt to share their establishments of\r\n      Murcia and Lisbon. The royal legion of Damascus was planted at\r\n      Cordova; that of Emesa at Seville; that of Kinnisrin or Chalcis\r\n      at Jaen; that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina Sidonia. The\r\n      natives of Yemen and Persia were scattered round Toledo and the\r\n      inland country, and the fertile seats of Grenada were bestowed on\r\n      ten thousand horsemen of Syria and Irak, the children of the\r\n      purest and most noble of the Arabian tribes. 190 A spirit of\r\n      emulation, sometimes beneficial, more frequently dangerous, was\r\n      nourished by these hereditary factions. Ten years after the\r\n      conquest, a map of the province was presented to the caliph: the\r\n      seas, the rivers, and the harbors, the inhabitants and cities,\r\n      the climate, the soil, and the mineral productions of the earth.\r\n      191 In the space of two centuries, the gifts of nature were\r\n      improved by the agriculture, 192 the manufactures, and the\r\n      commerce, of an industrious people; and the effects of their\r\n      diligence have been magnified by the idleness of their fancy. The\r\n      first of the Ommiades who reigned in Spain solicited the support\r\n      of the Christians; and in his edict of peace and protection, he\r\n      contents himself with a modest imposition of ten thousand ounces\r\n      of gold, ten thousand pounds of silver, ten thousand horses, as\r\n      many mules, one thousand cuirasses, with an equal number of\r\n      helmets and lances. 193 The most powerful of his successors\r\n      derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of twelve\r\n      millions and forty-five thousand dinars or pieces of gold, about\r\n      six millions of sterling money; 194 a sum which, in the tenth\r\n      century, most probably surpassed the united revenues of the\r\n      Christians monarchs. His royal seat of Cordova contained six\r\n      hundred moschs, nine hundred baths, and two hundred thousand\r\n      houses; he gave laws to eighty cities of the first, to three\r\n      hundred of the second and third order; and the fertile banks of\r\n      the Guadalquivir were adorned with twelve thousand villages and\r\n      hamlets. The Arabs might exaggerate the truth, but they created\r\n      and they describe the most prosperous aera of the riches, the\r\n      cultivation, and the populousness of Spain. 195\r\n\r\n      190 (return) [ Bibliot.

Arabia was the temple and\r\n      patrimony of the God of Mahomet; but he beheld with less jealousy\r\n      and affection the nations of the earth. The polytheists and\r\n      idolaters, who were ignorant of his name, might be lawfully\r\n      extirpated by his votaries; 196 but a wise policy supplied the\r\n      obligation of justice; and after some acts of intolerant zeal,\r\n      the Mahometan conquerors of Hindostan have spared the pagodas of\r\n      that devout and populous country. The disciples of Abraham, of\r\n      Moses, and of Jesus, were solemnly invited to accept the more\r\n      perfect revelation of Mahomet; but if they preferred the payment\r\n      of a moderate tribute, they were entitled to the freedom of\r\n      conscience and religious worship. 197 In a field of battle the\r\n      forfeit lives of the prisoners were redeemed by the profession of\r\n      Islam; the females were bound to embrace the religion of their\r\n      masters, and a race of sincere proselytes was gradually\r\n      multiplied by the education of the infant captives. But the\r\n      millions of African and Asiatic converts, who swelled the native\r\n      band of the faithful Arabs, must have been allured, rather than\r\n      constrained, to declare their belief in one God and the apostle\r\n      of God. By the repetition of a sentence and the loss of a\r\n      foreskin, the subject or the slave, the captive or the criminal,\r\n      arose in a moment the free and equal companion of the victorious\r\n      Moslems. Every sin was expiated, every engagement was dissolved:\r\n      the vow of celibacy was superseded by the indulgence of nature;\r\n      the active spirits who slept in the cloister were awakened by the\r\n      trumpet of the Saracens; and in the convulsion of the world,\r\n      every member of a new society ascended to the natural level of\r\n      his capacity and courage. The minds of the multitude were tempted\r\n      by the invisible as well as temporal blessings of the Arabian\r\n      prophet; and charity will hope that many of his proselytes\r\n      entertained a serious conviction of the truth and sanctity of his\r\n      revelation. In the eyes of an inquisitive polytheist, it must\r\n      appear worthy of the human and the divine nature. More pure than\r\n      the system of Zoroaster, more liberal than the law of Moses, the\r\n      religion of Mahomet might seem less inconsistent with reason than\r\n      the creed of mystery and superstition, which, in the seventh\r\n      century, disgraced the simplicity of the gospel.\r\n\r\n      196 (return) [ The Harbii, as they are styled, qui tolerari\r\n      nequeunt, are, 1.

Orient. p. 107, 108.)]\r\n\r\n      In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa, the national\r\n      religion has been eradicated by the Mahometan faith. The\r\n      ambiguous theology of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the\r\n      East; but the profane writings of Zoroaster 198 might, under the\r\n      reverend name of Abraham, be dexterously connected with the chain\r\n      of divine revelation. Their evil principle, the daemon Ahriman,\r\n      might be represented as the rival, or as the creature, of the God\r\n      of light. The temples of Persia were devoid of images; but the\r\n      worship of the sun and of fire might be stigmatized as a gross\r\n      and criminal idolatry. 199 The milder sentiment was consecrated\r\n      by the practice of Mahomet 200 and the prudence of the caliphs;\r\n      the Magians or Ghebers were ranked with the Jews and Christians\r\n      among the people of the written law; 201 and as late as the third\r\n      century of the Hegira, the city of Herat will afford a lively\r\n      contrast of private zeal and public toleration. 202 Under the\r\n      payment of an annual tribute, the Mahometan law secured to the\r\n      Ghebers of Herat their civil and religious liberties: but the\r\n      recent and humble mosch was overshadowed by the antique splendor\r\n      of the adjoining temple of fire. A fanatic Imam deplored, in his\r\n      sermons, the scandalous neighborhood, and accused the weakness or\r\n      indifference of the faithful. Excited by his voice, the people\r\n      assembled in tumult; the two houses of prayer were consumed by\r\n      the flames, but the vacant ground was immediately occupied by the\r\n      foundations of a new mosch. The injured Magi appealed to the\r\n      sovereign of Chorasan; he promised justice and relief; when,\r\n      behold! four thousand citizens of Herat, of a grave character and\r\n      mature age, unanimously swore that the idolatrous fane had never\r\n      existed; the inquisition was silenced and their conscience was\r\n      satisfied (says the historian Mirchond 203 with this holy and\r\n      meritorious perjury. 204 But the greatest part of the temples of\r\n      Persia were ruined by the insensible and general desertion of\r\n      their votaries.\r\n\r\n      It was insensible, since it is not accompanied with any memorial\r\n      of time or place, of persecution or resistance. It was general,\r\n      since the whole realm, from Shiraz to Samarcand, imbibed the\r\n      faith of the Koran; and the preservation of the native tongue\r\n      reveals the descent of the Mahometans of Persia. 205 In the\r\n      mountains and deserts, an obstinate race of unbelievers adhered\r\n      to the superstition of their fathers; and a faint tradition of\r\n      the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of Kirman,\r\n      along the banks of the Indus, among the exiles of Surat, and in\r\n      the colony which, in the last century, was planted by Shaw Abbas\r\n      at the gates of Ispahan. The chief pontiff has retired to Mount\r\n      Elbourz, eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd: the perpetual\r\n      fire (if it continues to burn) is inaccessible to the profane;\r\n      but his residence is the school, the oracle, and the pilgrimage\r\n      of the Ghebers, whose hard and uniform features attest the\r\n      unmingled purity of their blood. Under the jurisdiction of their\r\n      elders, eighty thousand families maintain an innocent and\r\n      industrious life: their subsistence is derived from some curious\r\n      manufactures and mechanic trades; and they cultivate the earth\r\n      with the fervor of a religious duty.

The arts, which had been taught by Carthage\r\n      and Rome, were involved in a cloud of ignorance; the doctrine of\r\n      Cyprian and Augustin was no longer studied. Five hundred\r\n      episcopal churches were overturned by the hostile fury of the\r\n      Donatists, the Vandals, and the Moors. The zeal and numbers of\r\n      the clergy declined; and the people, without discipline, or\r\n      knowledge, or hope, submissively sunk under the yoke of the\r\n      Arabian prophet. Within fifty years after the expulsion of the\r\n      Greeks, a lieutenant of Africa informed the caliph that the\r\n      tribute of the infidels was abolished by their conversion; 207\r\n      and, though he sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion, his\r\n      specious pretence was drawn from the rapid and extensive progress\r\n      of the Mahometan faith. In the next age, an extraordinary mission\r\n      of five bishops was detached from Alexandria to Cairoan. They\r\n      were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch to cherish and revive the\r\n      dying embers of Christianity: 208 but the interposition of a\r\n      foreign prelate, a stranger to the Latins, an enemy to the\r\n      Catholics, supposes the decay and dissolution of the African\r\n      hierarchy. It was no longer the time when the successor of St.\r\n      Cyprian, at the head of a numerous synod, could maintain an equal\r\n      contest with the ambition of the Roman pontiff. In the eleventh\r\n      century, the unfortunate priest who was seated on the ruins of\r\n      Carthage implored the arms and the protection of the Vatican; and\r\n      he bitterly complains that his naked body had been scourged by\r\n      the Saracens, and that his authority was disputed by the four\r\n      suffragans, the tottering pillars of his throne. Two epistles of\r\n      Gregory the Seventh 209 are destined to soothe the distress of\r\n      the Catholics and the pride of a Moorish prince. The pope assures\r\n      the sultan that they both worship the same God, and may hope to\r\n      meet in the bosom of Abraham; but the complaint that three\r\n      bishops could no longer be found to consecrate a brother,\r\n      announces the speedy and inevitable ruin of the episcopal order.\r\n      The Christians of Africa and Spain had long since submitted to\r\n      the practice of circumcision and the legal abstinence from wine\r\n      and pork; and the name of Mozarabes 210 (adoptive Arabs) was\r\n      applied to their civil or religious conformity. 211 About the\r\n      middle of the twelfth century, the worship of Christ and the\r\n      succession of pastors were abolished along the coast of Barbary,\r\n      and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville, of Valencia and\r\n      Grenada. 212 The throne of the Almohades, or Unitarians, was\r\n      founded on the blindest fanaticism, and their extraordinary rigor\r\n      might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and\r\n      intolerant zeal of the princes of Sicily and Castille, of Arragon\r\n      and Portugal. The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived\r\n      by the papal missionaries; and, on the landing of Charles the\r\n      Fifth, some families of Latin Christians were encouraged to rear\r\n      their heads at Tunis and Algiers.

During the first age of the\r\n      conquest, they suspected the loyalty of the Catholics, whose name\r\n      of Melchites betrayed their secret attachment to the Greek\r\n      emperor, while the Nestorians and Jacobites, his inveterate\r\n      enemies, approved themselves the sincere and voluntary friends of\r\n      the Mahometan government. 214 Yet this partial jealousy was\r\n      healed by time and submission; the churches of Egypt were shared\r\n      with the Catholics; 215 and all the Oriental sects were included\r\n      in the common benefits of toleration. The rank, the immunities,\r\n      the domestic jurisdiction of the patriarchs, the bishops, and the\r\n      clergy, were protected by the civil magistrate: the learning of\r\n      individuals recommended them to the employments of secretaries\r\n      and physicians: they were enriched by the lucrative collection of\r\n      the revenue; and their merit was sometimes raised to the command\r\n      of cities and provinces. A caliph of the house of Abbas was heard\r\n      to declare that the Christians were most worthy of trust in the\r\n      administration of Persia. “The Moslems,” said he, “will abuse\r\n      their present fortune; the Magians regret their fallen greatness;\r\n      and the Jews are impatient for their approaching deliverance.”\r\n      216 But the slaves of despotism are exposed to the alternatives\r\n      of favor and disgrace. The captive churches of the East have been\r\n      afflicted in every age by the avarice or bigotry of their rulers;\r\n      and the ordinary and legal restraints must be offensive to the\r\n      pride, or the zeal, of the Christians. 217 About two hundred\r\n      years after Mahomet, they were separated from their\r\n      fellow-subjects by a turban or girdle of a less honorable color;\r\n      instead of horses or mules. they were condemned to ride on asses,\r\n      in the attitude of women. Their public and private building were\r\n      measured by a diminutive standard; in the streets or the baths it\r\n      is their duty to give way or bow down before the meanest of the\r\n      people; and their testimony is rejected, if it may tend to the\r\n      prejudice of a true believer. The pomp of processions, the sound\r\n      of bells or of psalmody, is interdicted in their worship; a\r\n      decent reverence for the national faith is imposed on their\r\n      sermons and conversations; and the sacrilegious attempt to enter\r\n      a mosch, or to seduce a Mussulman, will not be suffered to escape\r\n      with impunity. In a time, however, of tranquillity and justice,\r\n      the Christians have never been compelled to renounce the Gospel,\r\n      or to embrace the Koran; but the punishment of death is inflicted\r\n      upon the apostates who have professed and deserted the law of\r\n      Mahomet. The martyrs of Cordova provoked the sentence of the\r\n      cadhi, by the public confession of their inconstancy, or their\r\n      passionate invectives against the person and religion of the\r\n      prophet. 218\r\n\r\n      214 (return) [ Absit (said the Catholic to the vizier of Bagdad)\r\n      ut pari loco habeas Nestorianos, quorum praeter Arabas nullus\r\n      alius rex est, et Graecos quorum reges amovendo Arabibus bello\r\n      non desistunt, &c.

The authority of the companions of Mahomet\r\n      expired with their lives; and the chiefs or emirs of the Arabian\r\n      tribes left behind, in the desert, the spirit of equality and\r\n      independence. The regal and sacerdotal characters were united in\r\n      the successors of Mahomet; and if the Koran was the rule of their\r\n      actions, they were the supreme judges and interpreters of that\r\n      divine book. They reigned by the right of conquest over the\r\n      nations of the East, to whom the name of liberty was unknown, and\r\n      who were accustomed to applaud in their tyrants the acts of\r\n      violence and severity that were exercised at their own expense.\r\n      Under the last of the Ommiades, the Arabian empire extended two\r\n      hundred days’ journey from east to west, from the confines of\r\n      Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.

The deserts of Scythia and Sarmatia\r\n      might be guarded by their extent, their climate, their poverty,\r\n      and the courage of the northern shepherds; China was remote and\r\n      inaccessible; but the greatest part of the temperate zone was\r\n      subject to the Mahometan conquerors, the Greeks were exhausted by\r\n      the calamities of war and the loss of their fairest provinces,\r\n      and the Barbarians of Europe might justly tremble at the\r\n      precipitate fall of the Gothic monarchy. In this inquiry I shall\r\n      unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our\r\n      neighbors of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the\r\n      Koran; that protected the majesty of Rome, and delayed the\r\n      servitude of Constantinople; that invigorated the defence of the\r\n      Christians, and scattered among their enemies the seeds of\r\n      division and decay.\r\n\r\n      Forty-six years after the flight of Mahomet from Mecca, his\r\n      disciples appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople. 1\r\n      They were animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the\r\n      prophet, that, to the first army which besieged the city of the\r\n      Caesars, their sins were forgiven: the long series of Roman\r\n      triumphs would be meritoriously transferred to the conquerors of\r\n      New Rome; and the wealth of nations was deposited in this\r\n      well-chosen seat of royalty and commerce. No sooner had the\r\n      caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established his throne,\r\n      than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood, by the\r\n      success and glory of this holy expedition; 2 his preparations by\r\n      sea and land were adequate to the importance of the object; his\r\n      standard was intrusted to Sophian, a veteran warrior, but the\r\n      troops were encouraged by the example and presence of Yezid, the\r\n      son and presumptive heir of the commander of the faithful. The\r\n      Greeks had little to hope, nor had their enemies any reason of\r\n      fear, from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor, who\r\n      disgraced the name of Constantine, and imitated only the\r\n      inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius. Without delay or\r\n      opposition, the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the\r\n      unguarded channel of the Hellespont, which even now, under the\r\n      feeble and disorderly government of the Turks, is maintained as\r\n      the natural bulwark of the capital. 3 The Arabian fleet cast\r\n      anchor, and the troops were disembarked near the palace of\r\n      Hebdomon, seven miles from the city. During many days, from the\r\n      dawn of light to the evening, the line of assault was extended\r\n      from the golden gate to the eastern promontory and the foremost\r\n      warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the succeeding\r\n      columns. But the besiegers had formed an insufficient estimate of\r\n      the strength and resources of Constantinople. The solid and lofty\r\n      walls were guarded by numbers and discipline: the spirit of the\r\n      Romans was rekindled by the last danger of their religion and\r\n      empire: the fugitives from the conquered provinces more\r\n      successfully renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria; and\r\n      the Saracens were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects\r\n      of artificial fire. This firm and effectual resistance diverted\r\n      their arms to the more easy attempt of plundering the European\r\n      and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis; and, after keeping the sea\r\n      from the month of April to that of September, on the approach of\r\n      winter they retreated fourscore miles from the capital, to the\r\n      Isle of Cyzicus, in which they had established their magazine of\r\n      spoil and provisions. So patient was their perseverance, or so\r\n      languid were their operations, that they repeated in the six\r\n      following summers the same attack and retreat, with a gradual\r\n      abatement of hope and vigor, till the mischances of shipwreck and\r\n      disease, of the sword and of fire, compelled them to relinquish\r\n      the fruitless enterprise. They might bewail the loss, or\r\n      commemorate the martyrdom, of thirty thousand Moslems, who fell\r\n      in the siege of Constantinople; and the solemn funeral of Abu\r\n      Ayub, or Job, excited the curiosity of the Christians themselves.\r\n\r\n      That venerable Arab, one of the last of the companions of\r\n      Mahomet, was numbered among the ansars, or auxiliaries, of\r\n      Medina, who sheltered the head of the flying prophet. In his\r\n      youth he fought, at Beder and Ohud, under the holy standard: in\r\n      his mature age he was the friend and follower of Ali; and the\r\n      last remnant of his strength and life was consumed in a distant\r\n      and dangerous war against the enemies of the Koran. His memory\r\n      was revered; but the place of his burial was neglected and\r\n      unknown, during a period of seven hundred and eighty years, till\r\n      the conquest of Constantinople by Mahomet the Second. A\r\n      seasonable vision (for such are the manufacture of every\r\n      religion) revealed the holy spot at the foot of the walls and the\r\n      bottom of the harbor; and the mosch of Ayub has been deservedly\r\n      chosen for the simple and martial inauguration of the Turkish\r\n      sultans. 4\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Theophanes places the seven years of the siege of\r\n      Constantinople in the year of our Christian aera, 673 (of the\r\n      Alexandrian 665, Sept. 1,) and the peace of the Saracens, four\r\n      years afterwards; a glaring inconsistency! which Petavius, Goar,\r\n      and Pagi, (Critica, tom. iv. p. 63, 64,) have struggled to\r\n      remove.

The Greek ambassador was favorably\r\n      received at Damascus, a general council of the emirs or Koreish:\r\n      a peace, or truce, of thirty years was ratified between the two\r\n      empires; and the stipulation of an annual tribute, fifty horses\r\n      of a noble breed, fifty slaves, and three thousand pieces of\r\n      gold, degraded the majesty of the commander of the faithful. 5\r\n      The aged caliph was desirous of possessing his dominions, and\r\n      ending his days in tranquillity and repose: while the Moors and\r\n      Indians trembled at his name, his palace and city of Damascus was\r\n      insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount Libanus, the\r\n      firmest barrier of the empire, till they were disarmed and\r\n      transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. 6 After the\r\n      revolt of Arabia and Persia, the house of Ommiyah was reduced to\r\n      the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt: their distress and fear enforced\r\n      their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians; and\r\n      the tribute was increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand\r\n      pieces of gold, for each of the three hundred and sixty-five days\r\n      of the solar year. But as soon as the empire was again united by\r\n      the arms and policy of Abdalmalek, he disclaimed a badge of\r\n      servitude not less injurious to his conscience than to his pride;\r\n      he discontinued the payment of the tribute; and the resentment of\r\n      the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad tyranny of the\r\n      second Justinian, the just rebellion of his subjects, and the\r\n      frequent change of his antagonists and successors. 7 Till the\r\n      reign of Abdalmalek, the Saracens had been content with the free\r\n      possession of the Persian and Roman treasures, in the coins of\r\n      Chosroes and Caesar. By the command of that caliph, a national\r\n      mint was established, both for silver and gold, and the\r\n      inscription of the Dinar, though it might be censured by some\r\n      timorous casuists, proclaimed the unity of the God of Mahomet. 8\r\n      Under the reign of the caliph Walid, the Greek language and\r\n      characters were excluded from the accounts of the public revenue.\r\n      9 If this change was productive of the invention or familiar use\r\n      of our present numerals, the Arabic or Indian ciphers, as they\r\n      are commonly styled, a regulation of office has promoted the most\r\n      important discoveries of arithmetic, algebra, and the\r\n      mathematical sciences. 10\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ Theophanes, though a Greek, deserves credit for\r\n      these tributes, (Chronograph. p. 295, 296, 300, 301,) which are\r\n      confirmed, with some variation, by the Arabic History of\r\n      Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 128, vers.

H. 76, A.D.\r\n      695, five or six years later than the Greek historians, has\r\n      compared the weight of the best or common gold dinar to the\r\n      drachm or dirhem of Egypt, (p. 77,) which may be equal to two\r\n      pennies (48 grains) of our Troy weight, (Hooper’s Inquiry into\r\n      Ancient Measures, p. 24-36,) and equivalent to eight shillings of\r\n      our sterling money. From the same Elmacin and the Arabian\r\n      physicians, some dinars as high as two dirhems, as low as half a\r\n      dirhem, may be deduced. The piece of silver was the dirhem, both\r\n      in value and weight; but an old, though fair coin, struck at\r\n      Waset, A. H. 88, and preserved in the Bodleian library, wants\r\n      four grains of the Cairo standard, (see the Modern Universal\r\n      History, tom. i. p. 548 of the French translation.) * Note: Up to\r\n      this time the Arabs had used the Roman or the Persian coins or\r\n      had minted others which resembled them. Nevertheless, it has been\r\n      admitted of late years, that the Arabians, before this epoch, had\r\n      caused coin to be minted, on which, preserving the Roman or the\r\n      Persian dies, they added Arabian names or inscriptions. Some of\r\n      these exist in different collections. We learn from Makrizi, an\r\n      Arabian author of great learning and judgment, that in the year\r\n      18 of the Hegira, under the caliphate of Omar, the Arabs had\r\n      coined money of this description. The same author informs us that\r\n      the caliph Abdalmalek caused coins to be struck representing\r\n      himself with a sword by his side. These types, so contrary to the\r\n      notions of the Arabs, were disapproved by the most influential\r\n      persons of the time, and the caliph substituted for them, after\r\n      the year 76 of the Hegira, the Mahometan coins with which we are\r\n      acquainted.

They\r\n      were used by the Greek and Latin arithmeticians long before the\r\n      age of Boethius. After the extinction of science in the West,\r\n      they were adopted by the Arabic versions from the original Mss.,\r\n      and restored to the Latins about the xith century. * Note:\r\n      Compare, on the Introduction of the Arabic numerals, Hallam’s\r\n      Introduction to the Literature of Europe, p. 150, note, and the\r\n      authors quoted therein.—M.]\r\n\r\n      Whilst the caliph Walid sat idle on the throne of Damascus,\r\n      whilst his lieutenants achieved the conquest of Transoxiana and\r\n      Spain, a third army of Saracens overspread the provinces of Asia\r\n      Minor, and approached the borders of the Byzantine capital. But\r\n      the attempt and disgrace of the second siege was reserved for his\r\n      brother Soliman, whose ambition appears to have been quickened by\r\n      a more active and martial spirit. In the revolutions of the Greek\r\n      empire, after the tyrant Justinian had been punished and avenged,\r\n      an humble secretary, Anastasius or Artemius, was promoted by\r\n      chance or merit to the vacant purple. He was alarmed by the sound\r\n      of war; and his ambassador returned from Damascus with the\r\n      tremendous news, that the Saracens were preparing an armament by\r\n      sea and land, such as would transcend the experience of the past,\r\n      or the belief of the present age. The precautions of Anastasius\r\n      were not unworthy of his station, or of the impending danger. He\r\n      issued a peremptory mandate, that all persons who were not\r\n      provided with the means of subsistence for a three years’ siege\r\n      should evacuate the city: the public granaries and arsenals were\r\n      abundantly replenished; the walls were restored and strengthened;\r\n      and the engines for casting stones, or darts, or fire, were\r\n      stationed along the ramparts, or in the brigantines of war, of\r\n      which an additional number was hastily constructed. To prevent is\r\n      safer, as well as more honorable, than to repel, an attack; and a\r\n      design was meditated, above the usual spirit of the Greeks, of\r\n      burning the naval stores of the enemy, the cypress timber that\r\n      had been hewn in Mount Libanus, and was piled along the sea-shore\r\n      of Phoenicia, for the service of the Egyptian fleet. This\r\n      generous enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of\r\n      the troops, who, in the new language of the empire, were styled\r\n      of the Obsequian Theme. 11 They murdered their chief, deserted\r\n      their standard in the Isle of Rhodes, dispersed themselves over\r\n      the adjacent continent, and deserved pardon or reward by\r\n      investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue. The\r\n      name of Theodosius might recommend him to the senate and people;\r\n      but, after some months, he sunk into a cloister, and resigned, to\r\n      the firmer hand of Leo the Isaurian, the urgent defence of the\r\n      capital and empire. The most formidable of the Saracens,\r\n      Moslemah, the brother of the caliph, was advancing at the head of\r\n      one hundred and twenty thousand Arabs and Persians, the greater\r\n      part mounted on horses or camels; and the successful sieges of\r\n      Tyana, Amorium, and Pergamus, were of sufficient duration to\r\n      exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes. At the\r\n      well-known passage of Abydus, on the Hellespont, the Mahometan\r\n      arms were transported, for the first time, 1111 from Asia to\r\n      Europe. From thence, wheeling round the Thracian cities of the\r\n      Propontis, Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land side,\r\n      surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart, prepared and\r\n      planted his engines of assault, and declared, by words and\r\n      actions, a patient resolution of expecting the return of\r\n      seed-time and harvest, should the obstinacy of the besieged prove\r\n      equal to his own. 1112 The Greeks would gladly have ransomed\r\n      their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment of a piece of\r\n      gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the liberal\r\n      offer was rejected with disdain, and the presumption of Moslemah\r\n      was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the\r\n      natives of Egypt and Syria. They are said to have amounted to\r\n      eighteen hundred ships: the number betrays their inconsiderable\r\n      size; and of the twenty stout and capacious vessels, whose\r\n      magnitude impeded their progress, each was manned with no more\r\n      than one hundred heavy-armed soldiers. This huge armada proceeded\r\n      on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, towards the mouth of the\r\n      Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was overshadowed, in the\r\n      language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and the same fatal\r\n      night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault\r\n      by sea and land. To allure the confidence of the enemy, the\r\n      emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the\r\n      entrance of the harbor; but while they hesitated whether they\r\n      should seize the opportunity, or apprehend the snare, the\r\n      ministers of destruction were at hand. The fire-ships of the\r\n      Greeks were launched against them; the Arabs, their arms, and\r\n      vessels, were involved in the same flames; the disorderly\r\n      fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the\r\n      waves; and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet, that had\r\n      threatened to extirpate the Roman name. A still more fatal and\r\n      irreparable loss was that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an\r\n      indigestion, 12 in his camp near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria,\r\n      as he was preparing to lead against Constantinople the remaining\r\n      forces of the East. The brother of Moslemah was succeeded by a\r\n      kinsman and an enemy; and the throne of an active and able prince\r\n      was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot.\r\n      1211 While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind\r\n      conscience, the siege was continued through the winter by the\r\n      neglect, rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar. 13 The\r\n      winter proved uncommonly rigorous: above a hundred days the\r\n      ground was covered with deep snow, and the natives of the sultry\r\n      climes of Egypt and Arabia lay torpid and almost lifeless in\r\n      their frozen camp. They revived on the return of spring; a second\r\n      effort had been made in their favor; and their distress was\r\n      relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets, laden with corn,\r\n      and arms, and soldiers; the first from Alexandria, of four\r\n      hundred transports and galleys; the second of three hundred and\r\n      sixty vessels from the ports of Africa. But the Greek fires were\r\n      again kindled; and if the destruction was less complete, it was\r\n      owing to the experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at\r\n      a safe distance, or to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners, who\r\n      deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians. The\r\n      trade and navigation of the capital were restored; and the\r\n      produce of the fisheries supplied the wants, and even the luxury,\r\n      of the inhabitants. But the calamities of famine and disease were\r\n      soon felt by the troops of Moslemah, and as the former was\r\n      miserably assuaged, so the latter was dreadfully propagated, by\r\n      the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract\r\n      from the most unclean or unnatural food. The spirit of conquest,\r\n      and even of enthusiasm, was extinct: the Saracens could no longer\r\n      struggle, beyond their lines, either single or in small parties,\r\n      without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the\r\n      Thracian peasants.\r\n\r\n      An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the Danube by the gifts\r\n      and promises of Leo; and these savage auxiliaries made some\r\n      atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the empire,\r\n      by the defeat and slaughter of twenty-two thousand Asiatics. A\r\n      report was dexterously scattered, that the Franks, the unknown\r\n      nations of the Latin world, were arming by sea and land in the\r\n      defence of the Christian cause, and their formidable aid was\r\n      expected with far different sensations in the camp and city. At\r\n      length, after a siege of thirteen months, 14 the hopeless\r\n      Moslemah received from the caliph the welcome permission of\r\n      retreat. 1411 The march of the Arabian cavalry over the\r\n      Hellespont and through the provinces of Asia, was executed\r\n      without delay or molestation; but an army of their brethren had\r\n      been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia, and the remains of\r\n      the fleet were so repeatedly damaged by tempest and fire, that\r\n      only five galleys entered the port of Alexandria to relate the\r\n      tale of their various and almost incredible disasters. 15\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ In the division of the Themes, or provinces\r\n      described by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, (de Thematibus, l. i.\r\n      p. 9, 10,) the Obsequium, a Latin appellation of the army and\r\n      palace, was the fourth in the public order.

The\r\n      historian who presumes to analyze this extraordinary composition\r\n      should suspect his own ignorance and that of his Byzantine\r\n      guides, so prone to the marvellous, so careless, and, in this\r\n      instance, so jealous of the truth. From their obscure, and\r\n      perhaps fallacious, hints it should seem that the principal\r\n      ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha, 18 or liquid\r\n      bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil, 19 which\r\n      springs from the earth, and catches fire as soon as it comes in\r\n      contact with the air. The naphtha was mingled, I know not by what\r\n      methods or in what proportions, with sulphur and with the pitch\r\n      that is extracted from evergreen firs. 20 From this mixture,\r\n      which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion, proceeded a\r\n      fierce and obstinate flame, which not only rose in perpendicular\r\n      ascent, but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or\r\n      lateral progress; instead of being extinguished, it was nourished\r\n      and quickened by the element of water; and sand, urine, or\r\n      vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this\r\n      powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the Greeks the\r\n      liquid, or the maritime, fire. For the annoyance of the enemy, it\r\n      was employed with equal effect, by sea and land, in battles or in\r\n      sieges. It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers,\r\n      or launched in red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in\r\n      arrows and javelins, twisted round with flax and tow, which had\r\n      deeply imbibed the inflammable oil; sometimes it was deposited in\r\n      fire-ships, the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge,\r\n      and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which\r\n      were planted on the prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped into\r\n      the mouths of savage monsters, that seemed to vomit a stream of\r\n      liquid and consuming fire. This important art was preserved at\r\n      Constantinople, as the palladium of the state: the galleys and\r\n      artillery might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome; but\r\n      the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most\r\n      jealous scruple, and the terror of the enemies was increased and\r\n      prolonged by their ignorance and surprise. In the treaties of the\r\n      administration of the empire, the royal author 21 suggests the\r\n      answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet\r\n      curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians. They should\r\n      be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been revealed by\r\n      an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines, with a\r\n      sacred injunction, that this gift of Heaven, this peculiar\r\n      blessing of the Romans, should never be communicated to any\r\n      foreign nation; that the prince and the subject were alike bound\r\n      to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties\r\n      of treason and sacrilege; and that the impious attempt would\r\n      provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance of the God of the\r\n      Christians. By these precautions, the secret was confined, above\r\n      four hundred years, to the Romans of the East; and at the end of\r\n      the eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom every sea and every art\r\n      were familiar, suffered the effects, without understanding the\r\n      composition, of the Greek fire. It was at length either\r\n      discovered or stolen by the Mahometans; and, in the holy wars of\r\n      Syria and Egypt, they retorted an invention, contrived against\r\n      themselves, on the heads of the Christians. A knight, who\r\n      despised the swords and lances of the Saracens, relates, with\r\n      heartfelt sincerity, his own fears, and those of his companions,\r\n      at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine that discharged\r\n      a torrent of the Greek fire, the feu Gregeois, as it is styled by\r\n      the more early of the French writers. It came flying through the\r\n      air, says Joinville, 22 like a winged long-tailed dragon, about\r\n      the thickness of a hogshead, with the report of thunder and the\r\n      velocity of lightning; and the darkness of the night was\r\n      dispelled by this deadly illumination. The use of the Greek, or,\r\n      as it might now be called, of the Saracen fire, was continued to\r\n      the middle of the fourteenth century, 23 when the scientific or\r\n      casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, effected a new\r\n      revolution in the art of war and the history of mankind. 24\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Our sure and indefatigable guide in the middle ages\r\n      and Byzantine history, Charles du Fresne du Cange, has treated in\r\n      several places of the Greek fire, and his collections leave few\r\n      gleanings behind.

The descendants\r\n      of Clovis had lost the inheritance of his martial and ferocious\r\n      spirit; and their misfortune or demerit has affixed the epithet\r\n      of lazy to the last kings of the Merovingian race. 26 They\r\n      ascended the throne without power, and sunk into the grave\r\n      without a name. A country palace, in the neighborhood of\r\n      Compiegne 27 was allotted for their residence or prison: but each\r\n      year, in the month of March or May, they were conducted in a\r\n      wagon drawn by oxen to the assembly of the Franks, to give\r\n      audience to foreign ambassadors, and to ratify the acts of the\r\n      mayor of the palace. That domestic officer was become the\r\n      minister of the nation and the master of the prince. A public\r\n      employment was converted into the patrimony of a private family:\r\n      the elder Pepin left a king of mature years under the\r\n      guardianship of his own widow and her child; and these feeble\r\n      regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his\r\n      bastards. A government, half savage and half corrupt, was almost\r\n      dissolved; and the tributary dukes, and provincial counts, and\r\n      the territorial lords, were tempted to despise the weakness of\r\n      the monarch, and to imitate the ambition of the mayor. Among\r\n      these independent chiefs, one of the boldest and most successful\r\n      was Eudes, duke of Aquitain, who in the southern provinces of\r\n      Gaul usurped the authority, and even the title of king. The\r\n      Goths, the Gascons, and the Franks, assembled under the standard\r\n      of this Christian hero: he repelled the first invasion of the\r\n      Saracens; and Zama, lieutenant of the caliph, lost his army and\r\n      his life under the walls of Thoulouse. The ambition of his\r\n      successors was stimulated by revenge; they repassed the Pyrenees\r\n      with the means and the resolution of conquest. The advantageous\r\n      situation which had recommended Narbonne 28 as the first Roman\r\n      colony, was again chosen by the Moslems: they claimed the\r\n      province of Septimania or Languedoc as a just dependence of the\r\n      Spanish monarchy: the vineyards of Gascony and the city of\r\n      Bourdeaux were possessed by the sovereign of Damascus and\r\n      Samarcand; and the south of France, from the mouth of the Garonne\r\n      to that of the Rhone, assumed the manners and religion of Arabia.\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ For the invasion of France and the defeat of the\r\n      Arabs by Charles Martel, see the Historia Arabum (c. 11, 12, 13,\r\n      14) of Roderic Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo, who had before him\r\n      the Christian chronicle of Isidore Pacensis, and the Mahometan\r\n      history of Novairi.

Narbonne was a Celtic town of the first eminence,\r\n      and one of the most northern places of the known world,\r\n      (D’Anville, Notice de l’Ancienne Gaule, p. 473.)]\r\n\r\n      But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalraman,\r\n      or Abderame, who had been restored by the caliph Hashem to the\r\n      wishes of the soldiers and people of Spain. That veteran and\r\n      daring commander adjudged to the obedience of the prophet\r\n      whatever yet remained of France or of Europe; and prepared to\r\n      execute the sentence, at the head of a formidable host, in the\r\n      full confidence of surmounting all opposition either of nature or\r\n      of man. His first care was to suppress a domestic rebel, who\r\n      commanded the most important passes of the Pyrenees: Manuza, a\r\n      Moorish chief, had accepted the alliance of the duke of Aquitain;\r\n      and Eudes, from a motive of private or public interest, devoted\r\n      his beauteous daughter to the embraces of the African\r\n      misbeliever. But the strongest fortresses of Cerdagne were\r\n      invested by a superior force; the rebel was overtaken and slain\r\n      in the mountains; and his widow was sent a captive to Damascus,\r\n      to gratify the desires, or more probably the vanity, of the\r\n      commander of the faithful. From the Pyrenees, Abderame proceeded\r\n      without delay to the passage of the Rhone and the siege of Arles.\r\n\r\n      An army of Christians attempted the relief of the city: the tombs\r\n      of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century; and\r\n      many thousands of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid\r\n      stream into the Mediterranean Sea. The arms of Abderame were not\r\n      less successful on the side of the ocean. He passed without\r\n      opposition the Garonne and Dordogne, which unite their waters in\r\n      the Gulf of Bourdeaux; but he found, beyond those rivers, the\r\n      camp of the intrepid Eudes, who had formed a second army and\r\n      sustained a second defeat, so fatal to the Christians, that,\r\n      according to their sad confession, God alone could reckon the\r\n      number of the slain. The victorious Saracen overran the provinces\r\n      of Aquitain, whose Gallic names are disguised, rather than lost,\r\n      in the modern appellations of Perigord, Saintonge, and Poitou:\r\n      his standards were planted on the walls, or at least before the\r\n      gates, of Tours and of Sens; and his detachments overspread the\r\n      kingdom of Burgundy as far as the well-known cities of Lyons and\r\n      Besançon. The memory of these devastations (for Abderame did not\r\n      spare the country or the people) was long preserved by tradition;\r\n      and the invasion of France by the Moors or Mahometans affords the\r\n      groundwork of those fables, which have been so wildly disfigured\r\n      in the romances of chivalry, and so elegantly adorned by the\r\n      Italian muse. In the decline of society and art, the deserted\r\n      cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens; their\r\n      richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries, which\r\n      they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames: and\r\n      the tutelar saints, both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours,\r\n      forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own\r\n      sepulchres. 29 A victorious line of march had been prolonged\r\n      above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of\r\n      the Loire; the repetition of an equal space would have carried\r\n      the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of\r\n      Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or\r\n      Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a\r\n      naval combat into the mouth of the Thames.

He sustains\r\n      the part of a lively and eloquent advocate; and sometimes rises\r\n      to the merit of an historian and philosopher.]\r\n\r\n      From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and\r\n      fortune of one man. Charles, the illegitimate son of the elder\r\n      Pepin, was content with the titles of mayor or duke of the\r\n      Franks; but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings.\r\n      In a laborious administration of twenty-four years, he restored\r\n      and supported the dignity of the throne, and the rebels of\r\n      Germany and Gaul were successively crushed by the activity of a\r\n      warrior, who, in the same campaign, could display his banner on\r\n      the Elbe, the Rhone, and the shores of the ocean. In the public\r\n      danger he was summoned by the voice of his country; and his\r\n      rival, the duke of Aquitain, was reduced to appear among the\r\n      fugitives and suppliants. “Alas!” exclaimed the Franks, “what a\r\n      misfortune! what an indignity! We have long heard of the name and\r\n      conquests of the Arabs: we were apprehensive of their attack from\r\n      the East; they have now conquered Spain, and invade our country\r\n      on the side of the West. Yet their numbers, and (since they have\r\n      no buckler) their arms, are inferior to our own.” “If you follow\r\n      my advice,” replied the prudent mayor of the palace, “you will\r\n      not interrupt their march, nor precipitate your attack. They are\r\n      like a torrent, which it is dangerous to stem in its career. The\r\n      thirst of riches, and the consciousness of success, redouble\r\n      their valor, and valor is of more avail than arms or numbers. Be\r\n      patient till they have loaded themselves with the encumbrance of\r\n      wealth. The possession of wealth will divide their councils and\r\n      assure your victory.” This subtile policy is perhaps a refinement\r\n      of the Arabian writers; and the situation of Charles will suggest\r\n      a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination—the secret\r\n      desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the\r\n      rebel duke of Aquitain. It is yet more probable, that the delays\r\n      of Charles were inevitable and reluctant. A standing army was\r\n      unknown under the first and second race; more than half the\r\n      kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens: according to their\r\n      respective situation, the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were\r\n      to conscious or too careless of the impending danger; and the\r\n      voluntary aids of the Gepidae and Germans were separated by a\r\n      long interval from the standard of the Christian general. No\r\n      sooner had he collected his forces, than he sought and found the\r\n      enemy in the centre of France, between Tours and Poitiers. His\r\n      well-conducted march was covered with a range of hills, and\r\n      Abderame appears to have been surprised by his unexpected\r\n      presence. The nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe, advanced with\r\n      equal ardor to an encounter which would change the history of the\r\n      world. In the six first days of desultory combat, the horsemen\r\n      and archers of the East maintained their advantage: but in the\r\n      closer onset of the seventh day, the Orientals were oppressed by\r\n      the strength and stature of the Germans, who, with stout hearts\r\n      and iron hands, 31 asserted the civil and religious freedom of\r\n      their posterity. The epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has\r\n      been added to the name of Charles, is expressive of his weighty\r\n      and irresistible strokes: the valor of Eudes was excited by\r\n      resentment and emulation; and their companions, in the eye of\r\n      history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry.\r\n      After a bloody field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens,\r\n      in the close of the evening, retired to their camp. In the\r\n      disorder and despair of the night, the various tribes of Yemen\r\n      and Damascus, of Africa and Spain, were provoked to turn their\r\n      arms against each other: the remains of their host were suddenly\r\n      dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and\r\n      separate retreat. At the dawn of the day, the stillness of a\r\n      hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians: on the\r\n      report of their spies, they ventured to explore the riches of the\r\n      vacant tents; but if we except some celebrated relics, a small\r\n      portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful\r\n      owners. The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic\r\n      world, and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three\r\n      hundred and fifty, or three hundred and seventy-five, thousand of\r\n      the Mahometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles, 32\r\n      while no more than fifteen hundred Christians were slain in the\r\n      field of Tours. But this incredible tale is sufficiently\r\n      disproved by the caution of the French general, who apprehended\r\n      the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German\r\n      allies to their native forests.\r\n\r\n      The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and\r\n      blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the\r\n      ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the\r\n      victory of the Franks was complete and final; Aquitain was\r\n      recovered by the arms of Eudes; the Arabs never resumed the\r\n      conquest of Gaul, and they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees\r\n      by Charles Martel and his valiant race. 33 It might have been\r\n      expected that the savior of Christendom would have been\r\n      canonized, or at least applauded, by the gratitude of the clergy,\r\n      who are indebted to his sword for their present existence. But in\r\n      the public distress, the mayor of the palace had been compelled\r\n      to apply the riches, or at least the revenues, of the bishops and\r\n      abbots, to the relief of the state and the reward of the\r\n      soldiers. His merits were forgotten, his sacrilege alone was\r\n      remembered, and, in an epistle to a Carlovingian prince, a Gallic\r\n      synod presumes to declare that his ancestor was damned; that on\r\n      the opening of his tomb, the spectators were affrighted by a\r\n      smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon; and that a saint\r\n      of the times was indulged with a pleasant vision of the soul and\r\n      body of Charles Martel, burning, to all eternity, in the abyss of\r\n      hell. 34\r\n\r\n      31 (return) [ Gens Austriae membrorum pre-eminentia valida, et\r\n      gens Germana corde et corpore praestantissima, quasi in ictu\r\n      oculi, manu ferrea, et pectore arduo, Arabes extinxerunt,\r\n      (Roderic.

Except among the Syrians, the caliphs\r\n      of the house of Ommiyah had never been the objects of the public\r\n      favor. The life of Mahomet recorded their perseverance in\r\n      idolatry and rebellion: their conversion had been reluctant,\r\n      their elevation irregular and factious, and their throne was\r\n      cemented with the most holy and noble blood of Arabia. The best\r\n      of their race, the pious Omar, was dissatisfied with his own\r\n      title: their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a\r\n      departure from the order of succession; and the eyes and wishes\r\n      of the faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem, and the\r\n      kindred of the apostle of God. Of these the Fatimites were either\r\n      rash or pusillanimous; but the descendants of Abbas cherished,\r\n      with courage and discretion, the hopes of their rising fortunes.\r\n      From an obscure residence in Syria, they secretly despatched\r\n      their agents and missionaries, who preached in the Eastern\r\n      provinces their hereditary indefeasible right; and Mohammed, the\r\n      son of Ali, the son of Abdallah, the son of Abbas, the uncle of\r\n      the prophet, gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan, and\r\n      accepted their free gift of four hundred thousand pieces of gold.\r\n      After the death of Mohammed, the oath of allegiance was\r\n      administered in the name of his son Ibrahim to a numerous band of\r\n      votaries, who expected only a signal and a leader; and the\r\n      governor of Chorasan continued to deplore his fruitless\r\n      admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus,\r\n      till he himself, with all his adherents, was driven from the city\r\n      and palace of Meru, by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem. 35 That\r\n      maker of kings, the author, as he is named, of the call of the\r\n      Abbassides, was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit\r\n      with the usual gratitude of courts. A mean, perhaps a foreign,\r\n      extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem.\r\n      Jealous of his wives, liberal of his wealth, prodigal of his own\r\n      blood and of that of others, he could boast with pleasure, and\r\n      possibly with truth, that he had destroyed six hundred thousand\r\n      of his enemies; and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and\r\n      countenance, that he was never seen to smile except on a day of\r\n      battle. In the visible separation of parties, the green was\r\n      consecrated to the Fatimites; the Ommiades were distinguished by\r\n      the white; and the black, as the most adverse, was naturally\r\n      adopted by the Abbassides. Their turbans and garments were\r\n      stained with that gloomy color: two black standards, on pike\r\n      staves nine cubits long, were borne aloft in the van of Abu\r\n      Moslem; and their allegorical names of the night and the shadow\r\n      obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual\r\n      succession of the line of Hashem. From the Indus to the\r\n      Euphrates, the East was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and\r\n      the black factions: the Abbassides were most frequently\r\n      victorious; but their public success was clouded by the personal\r\n      misfortune of their chief. The court of Damascus, awakening from\r\n      a long slumber, resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca,\r\n      which Ibrahim had undertaken with a splendid retinue, to\r\n      recommend himself at once to the favor of the prophet and of the\r\n      people. A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and\r\n      arrested his person; and the unhappy Ibrahim, snatched away from\r\n      the promise of untasted royalty, expired in iron fetters in the\r\n      dungeons of Haran. His two younger brothers, Saffah 3511 and\r\n      Almansor, eluded the search of the tyrant, and lay concealed at\r\n      Cufa, till the zeal of the people and the approach of his Eastern\r\n      friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient\r\n      public. On Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the colors of the\r\n      sect, Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp to the\r\n      mosch: ascending the pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful\r\n      successor of Mahomet; and after his departure, his kinsmen bound\r\n      a willing people by an oath of fidelity. But it was on the banks\r\n      of the Zab, and not in the mosch of Cufa, that this important\r\n      controversy was determined. Every advantage appeared to be on the\r\n      side of the white faction: the authority of established\r\n      government; an army of a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers,\r\n      against a sixth part of that number; and the presence and merit\r\n      of the caliph Mervan, the fourteenth and last of the house of\r\n      Ommiyah. Before his accession to the throne, he had deserved, by\r\n      his Georgian warfare, the honorable epithet of the ass of\r\n      Mesopotamia; 36 and he might have been ranked amongst the\r\n      greatest princes, had not, says Abulfeda, the eternal order\r\n      decreed that moment for the ruin of his family; a decree against\r\n      which all human fortitude and prudence must struggle in vain. The\r\n      orders of Mervan were mistaken, or disobeyed: the return of his\r\n      horse, from which he had dismounted on a necessary occasion,\r\n      impressed the belief of his death; and the enthusiasm of the\r\n      black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, the uncle of his\r\n      competitor. After an irretrievab defeat, the caliph escaped to\r\n      Mosul; but the colors of the Abbassides were displayed from the\r\n      rampart; he suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy look\r\n      on his palace of Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the\r\n      fortifications of Damascus, and, without halting in Palestine,\r\n      pitched his last and fatal camp at Busir, on the banks of the\r\n      Nile. 37 His speed was urged by the incessant diligence of\r\n      Abdallah, who in every step of the pursuit acquired strength and\r\n      reputation: the remains of the white faction were finally\r\n      vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which terminated the life and\r\n      anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps to the\r\n      unfortunate than to the victorious chief. The merciless\r\n      inquisition of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches\r\n      of the hostile race: their bones were scattered, their memory was\r\n      accursed, and the martyrdom of Hossein was abundantly revenged on\r\n      the posterity of his tyrants. Fourscore of the Ommiades, who had\r\n      yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes, were invited to a\r\n      banquet at Damascus. The laws of hospitality were violated by a\r\n      promiscuous massacre: the board was spread over their fallen\r\n      bodies; and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the\r\n      music of their dying groans. By the event of the civil war, the\r\n      dynasty of the Abbassides was firmly established; but the\r\n      Christians only could triumph in the mutual hatred and common\r\n      loss of the disciples of Mahomet. 38\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ The steed and the saddle which had carried any of\r\n      his wives were instantly killed or burnt, lest they should\r\n      afterwards be mounted by a male.

In the\r\n      proscription of the Ommiades, a royal youth of the name of\r\n      Abdalrahman alone escaped the rage of his enemies, who hunted the\r\n      wandering exile from the banks of the Euphrates to the valleys of\r\n      Mount Atlas. His presence in the neighborhood of Spain revived\r\n      the zeal of the white faction. The name and cause of the\r\n      Abbassides had been first vindicated by the Persians: the West\r\n      had been pure from civil arms; and the servants of the abdicated\r\n      family still held, by a precarious tenure, the inheritance of\r\n      their lands and the offices of government. Strongly prompted by\r\n      gratitude, indignation, and fear, they invited the grandson of\r\n      the caliph Hashem to ascend the throne of his ancestors; and, in\r\n      his desperate condition, the extremes of rashness and prudence\r\n      were almost the same. The acclamations of the people saluted his\r\n      landing on the coast of Andalusia: and, after a successful\r\n      struggle, Abdalrahman established the throne of Cordova, and was\r\n      the father of the Ommiades of Spain, who reigned above two\r\n      hundred and fifty years from the Atlantic to the Pyrenees. 39 He\r\n      slew in battle a lieutenant of the Abbassides, who had invaded\r\n      his dominions with a fleet and army: the head of Ala, in salt and\r\n      camphire, was suspended by a daring messenger before the palace\r\n      of Mecca; and the caliph Almansor rejoiced in his safety, that he\r\n      was removed by seas and lands from such a formidable adversary.\r\n      Their mutual designs or declarations of offensive war evaporated\r\n      without effect; but instead of opening a door to the conquest of\r\n      Europe, Spain was dissevered from the trunk of the monarchy,\r\n      engaged in perpetual hostility with the East, and inclined to\r\n      peace and friendship with the Christian sovereigns of\r\n      Constantinople and France. The example of the Ommiades was\r\n      imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali, the Edrissites\r\n      of Mauritania, and the more powerful fatimites of Africa and\r\n      Egypt. In the tenth century, the chair of Mahomet was disputed by\r\n      three caliphs or commanders of the faithful, who reigned at\r\n      Bagdad, Cairoan, and Cordova, excommunicating each other, and\r\n      agreed only in a principle of discord, that a sectary is more\r\n      odious and criminal than an unbeliever. 40\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ For the revolution of Spain, consult Roderic of\r\n      Toledo, (c. xviii. p. 34, &c.,) the Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana,\r\n      (tom. ii. p. 30, 198,) and Cardonne, (Hist. de l’Afrique et de\r\n      l’Espagne, tom. i. p. 180-197, 205, 272, 323, &c.)]\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ I shall not stop to refute the strange errors and\r\n      fancies of Sir William Temple (his Works, vol. iii. p. 371-374,\r\n      octavo edition) and Voltaire (Histoire Generale, c. xxviii. tom.\r\n      ii. p. 124, 125, edition de Lausanne) concerning the division of\r\n      the Saracen empire.

Damascus was disgraced by the choice, and\r\n      polluted with the blood, of the Ommiades; and, after some\r\n      hesitation, Almansor, the brother and successor of Saffah, laid\r\n      the foundations of Bagdad, 41 the Imperial seat of his posterity\r\n      during a reign of five hundred years. 42 The chosen spot is on\r\n      the eastern bank of the Tigris, about fifteen miles above the\r\n      ruins of Modain: the double wall was of a circular form; and such\r\n      was the rapid increase of a capital, now dwindled to a provincial\r\n      town, that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended by\r\n      eight hundred thousand men and sixty thousand women of Bagdad and\r\n      the adjacent villages. In this city of peace, 43 amidst the\r\n      riches of the East, the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence\r\n      and frugality of the first caliphs, and aspired to emulate the\r\n      magnificence of the Persian kings. After his wars and buildings,\r\n      Almansor left behind him in gold and silver about thirty millions\r\n      sterling: 44 and this treasure was exhausted in a few years by\r\n      the vices or virtues of his children. His son Mahadi, in a single\r\n      pilgrimage to Mecca, expended six millions of dinars of gold. A\r\n      pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of\r\n      cisterns and caravanseras, which he distributed along a measured\r\n      road of seven hundred miles; but his train of camels, laden with\r\n      snow, could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia, and to\r\n      refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet. 45 The\r\n      courtiers would surely praise the liberality of his grandson\r\n      Almamon, who gave away four fifths of the income of a province, a\r\n      sum of two millions four hundred thousand gold dinars, before he\r\n      drew his foot from the stirrup. At the nuptials of the same\r\n      prince, a thousand pearls of the largest size were showered on\r\n      the head of the bride, 46 and a lottery of lands and houses\r\n      displayed the capricious bounty of fortune. The glories of the\r\n      court were brightened, rather than impaired, in the decline of\r\n      the empire, and a Greek ambassador might admire, or pity, the\r\n      magnificence of the feeble Moctader. “The caliph’s whole army,”\r\n      says the historian Abulfeda, “both horse and foot, was under\r\n      arms, which together made a body of one hundred and sixty\r\n      thousand men. His state officers, the favorite slaves, stood near\r\n      him in splendid apparel, their belts glittering with gold and\r\n      gems. Near them were seven thousand eunuchs, four thousand of\r\n      them white, the remainder black. The porters or door-keepers were\r\n      in number seven hundred. Barges and boats, with the most superb\r\n      decorations, were seen swimming upon the Tigris. Nor was the\r\n      palace itself less splendid, in which were hung up thirty-eight\r\n      thousand pieces of tapestry, twelve thousand five hundred of\r\n      which were of silk embroidered with gold. The carpets on the\r\n      floor were twenty-two thousand. A hundred lions were brought out,\r\n      with a keeper to each lion. 47 Among the other spectacles of rare\r\n      and stupendous luxury was a tree of gold and silver spreading\r\n      into eighteen large branches, on which, and on the lesser boughs,\r\n      sat a variety of birds made of the same precious metals, as well\r\n      as the leaves of the tree. While the machinery affected\r\n      spontaneous motions, the several birds warbled their natural\r\n      harmony. Through this scene of magnificence, the Greek ambassador\r\n      was led by the vizier to the foot of the caliph’s throne.” 48 In\r\n      the West, the Ommiades of Spain supported, with equal pomp, the\r\n      title of commander of the faithful. Three miles from Cordova, in\r\n      honor of his favorite sultana, the third and greatest of the\r\n      Abdalrahmans constructed the city, palace, and gardens of Zehra.\r\n      Twenty-five years, and above three millions sterling, were\r\n      employed by the founder: his liberal taste invited the artists of\r\n      Constantinople, the most skilful sculptors and architects of the\r\n      age; and the buildings were sustained or adorned by twelve\r\n      hundred columns of Spanish and African, of Greek and Italian\r\n      marble. The hall of audience was incrusted with gold and pearls,\r\n      and a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the curious\r\n      and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds. In a lofty pavilion\r\n      of the gardens, one of these basins and fountains, so delightful\r\n      in a sultry climate, was replenished not with water, but with the\r\n      purest quicksilver. The seraglio of Abdalrahman, his wives,\r\n      concubines, and black eunuchs, amounted to six thousand three\r\n      hundred persons: and he was attended to the field by a guard of\r\n      twelve thousand horse, whose belts and cimeters were studded with\r\n      gold. 49\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ The geographer D’Anville, (l’Euphrate et le Tigre,\r\n      p. 121-123,) and the Orientalist D’Herbelot, (Bibliotheque, p.\r\n      167, 168,) may suffice for the knowledge of Bagdad.

It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience\r\n      of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps excited\r\n      our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial\r\n      which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. “I have now\r\n      reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my\r\n      subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies.\r\n      Riches and honors, power and pleasure, have waited on my call,\r\n      nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my\r\n      felicity.

Temporal and spiritual conquest\r\n      had been the sole occupation of the first successors of Mahomet;\r\n      and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life, the\r\n      whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work. The\r\n      Abbassides were impoverished by the multitude of their wants, and\r\n      their contempt of oeconomy. Instead of pursuing the great object\r\n      of ambition, their leisure, their affections, the powers of their\r\n      mind, were diverted by pomp and pleasure: the rewards of valor\r\n      were embezzled by women and eunuchs, and the royal camp was\r\n      encumbered by the luxury of the palace. A similar temper was\r\n      diffused among the subjects of the caliph. Their stern enthusiasm\r\n      was softened by time and prosperity. they sought riches in the\r\n      occupations of industry, fame in the pursuits of literature, and\r\n      happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life. War was no longer\r\n      the passion of the Saracens; and the increase of pay, the\r\n      repetition of donatives, were insufficient to allure the\r\n      posterity of those voluntary champions who had crowded to the\r\n      standard of Abubeker and Omar for the hopes of spoil and of\r\n      paradise.\r\n\r\n      50 (return) [ Cardonne, tom. i. p. 329, 330.

A people continually exposed\r\n      to the dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of\r\n      medicine, or rather of surgery; but the starving physicians of\r\n      Arabia murmured a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived\r\n      them of the greatest part of their practice. 51 After their civil\r\n      and domestic wars, the subjects of the Abbassides, awakening from\r\n      this mental lethargy, found leisure and felt curiosity for the\r\n      acquisition of profane science. This spirit was first encouraged\r\n      by the caliph Almansor, who, besides his knowledge of the\r\n      Mahometan law, had applied himself with success to the study of\r\n      astronomy. But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon, the seventh\r\n      of the Abbassides, he completed the designs of his grandfather,\r\n      and invited the muses from their ancient seats. His ambassadors\r\n      at Constantinople, his agents in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt,\r\n      collected the volumes of Grecian science; at his command they\r\n      were translated by the most skilful interpreters into the Arabic\r\n      language: his subjects were exhorted assiduously to peruse these\r\n      instructive writings; and the successor of Mahomet assisted with\r\n      pleasure and modesty at the assemblies and disputations of the\r\n      learned. “He was not ignorant,” says Abulpharagius, “that they\r\n      are the elect of God, his best and most useful servants, whose\r\n      lives are devoted to the improvement of their rational faculties.\r\n      The mean ambition of the Chinese or the Turks may glory in the\r\n      industry of their hands or the indulgence of their brutal\r\n      appetites. Yet these dexterous artists must view, with hopeless\r\n      emulation, the hexagons and pyramids of the cells of a beehive:\r\n      52 these fortitudinous heroes are awed by the superior fierceness\r\n      of the lions and tigers; and in their amorous enjoyments they are\r\n      much inferior to the vigor of the grossest and most sordid\r\n      quadrupeds. The teachers of wisdom are the true luminaries and\r\n      legislators of a world, which, without their aid, would again\r\n      sink in ignorance and barbarism.” 53 The zeal and curiosity of\r\n      Almamon were imitated by succeeding princes of the line of Abbas:\r\n      their rivals, the Fatimites of Africa and the Ommiades of Spain,\r\n      were the patrons of the learned, as well as the commanders of the\r\n      faithful; the same royal prerogative was claimed by their\r\n      independent emirs of the provinces; and their emulation diffused\r\n      the taste and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara\r\n      to Fez and Cordova. The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of\r\n      two hundred thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a\r\n      college at Bagdad, which he endowed with an annual revenue of\r\n      fifteen thousand dinars. The fruits of instruction were\r\n      communicated, perhaps at different times, to six thousand\r\n      disciples of every degree, from the son of the noble to that of\r\n      the mechanic: a sufficient allowance was provided for the\r\n      indigent scholars; and the merit or industry of the professors\r\n      was repaid with adequate stipends. In every city the productions\r\n      of Arabic literature were copied and collected by the curiosity\r\n      of the studious and the vanity of the rich. A private doctor\r\n      refused the invitation of the sultan of Bochara, because the\r\n      carriage of his books would have required four hundred camels.\r\n      The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one hundred\r\n      thousand manuscripts, elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound,\r\n      which were lent, without jealousy or avarice, to the students of\r\n      Cairo. Yet this collection must appear moderate, if we can\r\n      believe that the Ommiades of Spain had formed a library of six\r\n      hundred thousand volumes, forty-four of which were employed in\r\n      the mere catalogue. Their capital, Cordova, with the adjacent\r\n      towns of Malaga, Almeria, and Murcia, had given birth to more\r\n      than three hundred writers, and above seventy public libraries\r\n      were opened in the cities of the Andalusian kingdom. The age of\r\n      Arabian learning continued about five hundred years, till the\r\n      great eruption of the Moguls, and was coeval with the darkest and\r\n      most slothful period of European annals; but since the sun of\r\n      science has arisen in the West, it should seem that the Oriental\r\n      studies have languished and declined. 54\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ The Guliston (p. 29) relates the conversation of\r\n      Mahomet and a physician, (Epistol.

The works of\r\n      speculation or science may be reduced to the four classes of\r\n      philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and physic. The sages of\r\n      Greece were translated and illustrated in the Arabic language,\r\n      and some treatises, now lost in the original, have been recovered\r\n      in the versions of the East, 56 which possessed and studied the\r\n      writings of Aristotle and Plato, of Euclid and Apollonius, of\r\n      Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen. 57 Among the ideal systems which\r\n      have varied with the fashion of the times, the Arabians adopted\r\n      the philosophy of the Stagirite, alike intelligible or alike\r\n      obscure for the readers of every age. Plato wrote for the\r\n      Athenians, and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with\r\n      the language and religion of Greece. After the fall of that\r\n      religion, the Peripatetics, emerging from their obscurity,\r\n      prevailed in the controversies of the Oriental sects, and their\r\n      founder was long afterwards restored by the Mahometans of Spain\r\n      to the Latin schools. 58 The physics, both of the Academy and the\r\n      Lycaeum, as they are built, not on observation, but on argument,\r\n      have retarded the progress of real knowledge. The metaphysics of\r\n      infinite, or finite, spirit, have too often been enlisted in the\r\n      service of superstition. But the human faculties are fortified by\r\n      the art and practice of dialectics; the ten predicaments of\r\n      Aristotle collect and methodize our ideas, 59 and his syllogism\r\n      is the keenest weapon of dispute. It was dexterously wielded in\r\n      the schools of the Saracens, but as it is more effectual for the\r\n      detection of error than for the investigation of truth, it is not\r\n      surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should\r\n      still revolve in the same circle of logical argument. The\r\n      mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege, that, in\r\n      the course of ages, they may always advance, and can never\r\n      recede. But the ancient geometry, if I am not misinformed, was\r\n      resumed in the same state by the Italians of the fifteenth\r\n      century; and whatever may be the origin of the name, the science\r\n      of algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest\r\n      testimony of the Arabs themselves. 60 They cultivated with more\r\n      success the sublime science of astronomy, which elevates the mind\r\n      of man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence.\r\n      The costly instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph\r\n      Almamon, and the land of the Chaldaeans still afforded the same\r\n      spacious level, the same unclouded horizon. In the plains of\r\n      Sinaar, and a second time in those of Cufa, his mathematicians\r\n      accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth,\r\n      and determined at twenty-four thousand miles the entire\r\n      circumference of our globe. 61 From the reign of the Abbassides\r\n      to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane, the stars, without the\r\n      aid of glasses, were diligently observed; and the astronomical\r\n      tables of Bagdad, Spain, and Samarcand, 62 correct some minute\r\n      errors, without daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy,\r\n      without advancing a step towards the discovery of the solar\r\n      system. In the Eastern courts, the truths of science could be\r\n      recommended only by ignorance and folly, and the astronomer would\r\n      have been disregarded, had he not debased his wisdom or honesty\r\n      by the vain predictions of astrology. 63 But in the science of\r\n      medicine, the Arabians have been deservedly applauded. The names\r\n      of Mesua and Geber, of Razis and Avicenna, are ranked with the\r\n      Grecian masters; in the city of Bagdad, eight hundred and sixty\r\n      physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession:\r\n      64 in Spain, the life of the Catholic princes was intrusted to\r\n      the skill of the Saracens, 65 and the school of Salerno, their\r\n      legitimate offspring, revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of\r\n      the healing art. 66 The success of each professor must have been\r\n      influenced by personal and accidental causes; but we may form a\r\n      less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy, 67\r\n      botany, 68 and chemistry, 69 the threefold basis of their theory\r\n      and practice. A superstitious reverence for the dead confined\r\n      both the Greeks and the Arabians to the dissection of apes and\r\n      quadrupeds; the more solid and visible parts were known in the\r\n      time of Galen, and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was\r\n      reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists.\r\n      Botany is an active science, and the discoveries of the torrid\r\n      zone might enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand\r\n      plants. Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the\r\n      temples and monasteries of Egypt; much useful experience had been\r\n      acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures; but the\r\n      science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the\r\n      industry of the Saracens. They first invented and named the\r\n      alembic for the purposes of distillation, analyzed the substances\r\n      of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and\r\n      affinities of alcalis and acids, and converted the poisonous\r\n      minerals into soft and salutary medicines. But the most eager\r\n      search of Arabian chemistry was the transmutation of metals, and\r\n      the elixir of immortal health: the reason and the fortunes of\r\n      thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of alchemy, and the\r\n      consummation of the great work was promoted by the worthy aid of\r\n      mystery, fable, and superstition.\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ The Arabic catalogue of the Escurial will give a\r\n      just idea of the proportion of the classes.

The Greek interpreters\r\n      were chosen among their Christian subjects; they formed their\r\n      translations, sometimes on the original text, more frequently\r\n      perhaps on a Syriac version; and in the crowd of astronomers and\r\n      physicians, there is no example of a poet, an orator, or even an\r\n      historian, being taught to speak the language of the Saracens. 70\r\n      The mythology of Homer would have provoked the abhorrence of\r\n      those stern fanatics: they possessed in lazy ignorance the\r\n      colonies of the Macedonians, and the provinces of Carthage and\r\n      Rome: the heroes of Plutarch and Livy were buried in oblivion;\r\n      and the history of the world before Mahomet was reduced to a\r\n      short legend of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the Persian\r\n      kings. Our education in the Greek and Latin schools may have\r\n      fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive taste; and I am not\r\n      forward to condemn the literature and judgment of nations, of\r\n      whose language I am ignorant. Yet I know that the classics have\r\n      much to teach, and I believe that the Orientals have much to\r\n      learn; the temperate dignity of style, the graceful proportions\r\n      of art, the forms of visible and intellectual beauty, the just\r\n      delineation of character and passion, the rhetoric of narrative\r\n      and argument, the regular fabric of epic and dramatic poetry. 71\r\n      The influence of truth and reason is of a less ambiguous\r\n      complexion. The philosophers of Athens and Rome enjoyed the\r\n      blessings, and asserted the rights, of civil and religious\r\n      freedom. Their moral and political writings might have gradually\r\n      unlocked the fetters of Eastern despotism, diffused a liberal\r\n      spirit of inquiry and toleration, and encouraged the Arabian\r\n      sages to suspect that their caliph was a tyrant, and their\r\n      prophet an impostor. 72 The instinct of superstition was alarmed\r\n      by the introduction even of the abstract sciences; and the more\r\n      rigid doctors of the law condemned the rash and pernicious\r\n      curiosity of Almamon. 73 To the thirst of martyrdom, the vision\r\n      of paradise, and the belief of predestination, we must ascribe\r\n      the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people. And the sword\r\n      of the Saracens became less formidable when their youth was drawn\r\n      away from the camp to the college, when the armies of the\r\n      faithful presumed to read and to reflect. Yet the foolish vanity\r\n      of the Greeks was jealous of their studies, and reluctantly\r\n      imparted the sacred fire to the Barbarians of the East. 74\r\n\r\n      70 (return) [ Abulpharagius (Dynast. p. 26, 148) mentions a\r\n      Syriac version of Homer’s two poems, by Theophilus, a Christian\r\n      Maronite of Mount Libanus, who professed astronomy at Roha or\r\n      Edessa towards the end of the viiith century.

This absurd scruple is expressed almost in\r\n      the same words by the continuator of Theophanes, (Scriptores post\r\n      Theophanem, p. 118.)]\r\n\r\n      In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides, the Greeks\r\n      had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging\r\n      their limits. But a severe retribution was exacted by Mohadi, the\r\n      third caliph of the new dynasty, who seized, in his turn, the\r\n      favorable opportunity, while a woman and a child, Irene and\r\n      Constantine, were seated on the Byzantine throne. An army of\r\n      ninety-five thousand Persians and Arabs was sent from the Tigris\r\n      to the Thracian Bosphorus, under the command of Harun, 75 or\r\n      Aaron, the second son of the commander of the faithful. His\r\n      encampment on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis, or Scutari,\r\n      informed Irene, in her palace of Constantinople, of the loss of\r\n      her troops and provinces. With the consent or connivance of their\r\n      sovereign, her ministers subscribed an ignominious peace; and the\r\n      exchange of some royal gifts could not disguise the annual\r\n      tribute of seventy thousand dinars of gold, which was imposed on\r\n      the Roman empire. The Saracens had too rashly advanced into the\r\n      midst of a distant and hostile land: their retreat was solicited\r\n      by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful markets; and not\r\n      a Greek had courage to whisper, that their weary forces might be\r\n      surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a\r\n      slippery mountain and the River Sangarius. Five years after this\r\n      expedition, Harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder\r\n      brother; the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race,\r\n      illustrious in the West, as the ally of Charlemagne, and familiar\r\n      to the most childish readers, as the perpetual hero of the\r\n      Arabian tales. His title to the name of Al Rashid (the Just) is\r\n      sullied by the extirpation of the generous, perhaps the innocent,\r\n      Barmecides; yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow\r\n      who had been pillaged by his troops, and who dared, in a passage\r\n      of the Koran, to threaten the inattentive despot with the\r\n      judgment of God and posterity. His court was adorned with luxury\r\n      and science; but, in a reign of three-and-twenty years, Harun\r\n      repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt; nine\r\n      times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca; eight times he\r\n      invaded the territories of the Romans; and as often as they\r\n      declined the payment of the tribute, they were taught to feel\r\n      that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of\r\n      submission. But when the unnatural mother of Constantine was\r\n      deposed and banished, her successor, Nicephorus, resolved to\r\n      obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace. The epistle of\r\n      the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the\r\n      game of chess, which had already spread from Persia to Greece.\r\n      “The queen (he spoke of Irene) considered you as a rook, and\r\n      herself as a pawn. That pusillanimous female submitted to pay a\r\n      tribute, the double of which she ought to have exacted from the\r\n      Barbarians. Restore therefore the fruits of your injustice, or\r\n      abide the determination of the sword.” At these words the\r\n      ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the\r\n      throne. The caliph smiled at the menace, and drawing his cimeter,\r\n      samsamah, a weapon of historic or fabulous renown, he cut asunder\r\n      the feeble arms of the Greeks, without turning the edge, or\r\n      endangering the temper, of his blade. He then dictated an epistle\r\n      of tremendous brevity: “In the name of the most merciful God,\r\n      Harun al Rashid, commander of the faithful, to Nicephorus, the\r\n      Roman dog. I have read thy letter, O thou son of an unbelieving\r\n      mother. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt behold, my reply.” It was\r\n      written in characters of blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia;\r\n      and the warlike celerity of the Arabs could only be checked by\r\n      the arts of deceit and the show of repentance.\r\n\r\n      The triumphant caliph retired, after the fatigues of the\r\n      campaign, to his favorite palace of Racca on the Euphrates: 76\r\n      but the distance of five hundred miles, and the inclemency of the\r\n      season, encouraged his adversary to violate the peace. Nicephorus\r\n      was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the commander of\r\n      the faithful, who repassed, in the depth of winter, the snows of\r\n      Mount Taurus: his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted;\r\n      and the perfidious Greek escaped with three wounds from a field\r\n      of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects. Yet the\r\n      emperor was ashamed of submission, and the caliph was resolved on\r\n      victory. One hundred and thirty-five thousand regular soldiers\r\n      received pay, and were inscribed in the military roll; and above\r\n      three hundred thousand persons of every denomination marched\r\n      under the black standard of the Abbassides. They swept the\r\n      surface of Asia Minor far beyond Tyana and Ancyra, and invested\r\n      the Pontic Heraclea, 77 once a flourishing state, now a paltry\r\n      town; at that time capable of sustaining, in her antique walls, a\r\n      month’s siege against the forces of the East. The ruin was\r\n      complete, the spoil was ample; but if Harun had been conversant\r\n      with Grecian story, he would have regretted the statue of\r\n      Hercules, whose attributes, the club, the bow, the quiver, and\r\n      the lion’s hide, were sculptured in massy gold. The progress of\r\n      desolation by sea and land, from the Euxine to the Isle of\r\n      Cyprus, compelled the emperor Nicephorus to retract his haughty\r\n      defiance. In the new treaty, the ruins of Heraclea were left\r\n      forever as a lesson and a trophy; and the coin of the tribute was\r\n      marked with the image and superscription of Harun and his three\r\n      sons. 78 Yet this plurality of lords might contribute to remove\r\n      the dishonor of the Roman name. After the death of their father,\r\n      the heirs of the caliph were involved in civil discord, and the\r\n      conqueror, the liberal Almamon, was sufficiently engaged in the\r\n      restoration of domestic peace and the introduction of foreign\r\n      science.\r\n\r\n      75 (return) [ See the reign and character of Harun Al Rashid, in\r\n      the Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 431-433, under his proper title;\r\n      and in the relative articles to which M.

As the\r\n      subjects and sectaries of the white party, they might lawfully\r\n      invade the dominions of the black caliphs. A rebellious faction\r\n      introduced them into Alexandria; 81 they cut in pieces both\r\n      friends and foes, pillaged the churches and the moschs, sold\r\n      above six thousand Christian captives, and maintained their\r\n      station in the capital of Egypt, till they were oppressed by the\r\n      forces and the presence of Almamon himself. From the mouth of the\r\n      Nile to the Hellespont, the islands and sea-coasts both of the\r\n      Greeks and Moslems were exposed to their depredations; they saw,\r\n      they envied, they tasted the fertility of Crete, and soon\r\n      returned with forty galleys to a more serious attack. The\r\n      Andalusians wandered over the land fearless and unmolested; but\r\n      when they descended with their plunder to the sea-shore, their\r\n      vessels were in flames, and their chief, Abu Caab, confessed\r\n      himself the author of the mischief.

Here is your true country; repose from your toils, and\r\n      forget the barren place of your nativity.” “And our wives and\r\n      children?” “Your beauteous captives will supply the place of your\r\n      wives, and in their embraces you will soon become the fathers of\r\n      a new progeny.” The first habitation was their camp, with a ditch\r\n      and rampart, in the Bay of Suda; but an apostate monk led them to\r\n      a more desirable position in the eastern parts; and the name of\r\n      Candax, their fortress and colony, has been extended to the whole\r\n      island, under the corrupt and modern appellation of Candia. The\r\n      hundred cities of the age of Minos were diminished to thirty; and\r\n      of these, only one, most probably Cydonia, had courage to retain\r\n      the substance of freedom and the profession of Christianity. The\r\n      Saracens of Crete soon repaired the loss of their navy; and the\r\n      timbers of Mount Ida were launched into the main. During a\r\n      hostile period of one hundred and thirty-eight years, the princes\r\n      of Constantinople attacked these licentious corsairs with\r\n      fruitless curses and ineffectual arms.\r\n\r\n      79 (return) [ The authors from whom I have learned the most of\r\n      the ancient and modern state of Crete, are Belon, (Observations,\r\n      &c., c. 3-20, Paris, 1555,) Tournefort, (Voyage du Levant, tom.\r\n      i. lettre ii. et iii.,) and Meursius, (Creta, in his works, tom.\r\n      iii. p. 343-544.)

An amorous youth, who had stolen a nun from her cloister,\r\n      was sentenced by the emperor to the amputation of his tongue.\r\n      Euphemius appealed to the reason and policy of the Saracens of\r\n      Africa; and soon returned with the Imperial purple, a fleet of\r\n      one hundred ships, and an army of seven hundred horse and ten\r\n      thousand foot. They landed at Mazara near the ruins of the\r\n      ancient Selinus; but after some partial victories, Syracuse 83\r\n      was delivered by the Greeks, the apostate was slain before her\r\n      walls, and his African friends were reduced to the necessity of\r\n      feeding on the flesh of their own horses. In their turn they were\r\n      relieved by a powerful reenforcement of their brethren of\r\n      Andalusia; the largest and western part of the island was\r\n      gradually reduced, and the commodious harbor of Palermo was\r\n      chosen for the seat of the naval and military power of the\r\n      Saracens. Syracuse preserved about fifty years the faith which\r\n      she had sworn to Christ and to Caesar. In the last and fatal\r\n      siege, her citizens displayed some remnant of the spirit which\r\n      had formerly resisted the powers of Athens and Carthage. They\r\n      stood above twenty days against the battering-rams and\r\n      catapultoe, the mines and tortoises of the besiegers; and the\r\n      place might have been relieved, if the mariners of the Imperial\r\n      fleet had not been detained at Constantinople in building a\r\n      church to the Virgin Mary. The deacon Theodosius, with the bishop\r\n      and clergy, was dragged in chains from the altar to Palermo, cast\r\n      into a subterraneous dungeon, and exposed to the hourly peril of\r\n      death or apostasy. His pathetic, and not inelegant, complaint may\r\n      be read as the epitaph of his country. 84 From the Roman conquest\r\n      to this final calamity, Syracuse, now dwindled to the primitive\r\n      Isle of Ortygea, had insensibly declined. Yet the relics were\r\n      still precious; the plate of the cathedral weighed five thousand\r\n      pounds of silver; the entire spoil was computed at one million of\r\n      pieces of gold, (about four hundred thousand pounds sterling,)\r\n      and the captives must outnumber the seventeen thousand\r\n      Christians, who were transported from the sack of Tauromenium\r\n      into African servitude. In Sicily, the religion and language of\r\n      the Greeks were eradicated; and such was the docility of the\r\n      rising generation, that fifteen thousand boys were circumcised\r\n      and clothed on the same day with the son of the Fatimite caliph.\r\n      The Arabian squadrons issued from the harbors of Palermo,\r\n      Biserta, and Tunis; a hundred and fifty towns of Calabria and\r\n      Campania were attacked and pillaged; nor could the suburbs of\r\n      Rome be defended by the name of the Caesars and apostles. Had the\r\n      Mahometans been united, Italy must have fallen an easy and\r\n      glorious accession to the empire of the prophet. But the caliphs\r\n      of Bagdad had lost their authority in the West; the Aglabites and\r\n      Fatimites usurped the provinces of Africa, their emirs of Sicily\r\n      aspired to independence; and the design of conquest and dominion\r\n      was degraded to a repetition of predatory inroads. 85\r\n\r\n      82 (return) [ Theophanes, l. ii. p. 51.

A fleet of Saracens from the\r\n      African coast presumed to enter the mouth of the Tyber, and to\r\n      approach a city which even yet, in her fallen state, was revered\r\n      as the metropolis of the Christian world. The gates and ramparts\r\n      were guarded by a trembling people; but the tombs and temples of\r\n      St. Peter and St. Paul were left exposed in the suburbs of the\r\n      Vatican and of the Ostian way. Their invisible sanctity had\r\n      protected them against the Goths, the Vandals, and the Lombards;\r\n      but the Arabs disdained both the gospel and the legend; and their\r\n      rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the precepts of the\r\n      Koran. The Christian idols were stripped of their costly\r\n      offerings; a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St.\r\n      Peter; and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire, their\r\n      deliverance must be imputed to the haste, rather than the\r\n      scruples, of the Saracens. In their course along the Appian way,\r\n      they pillaged Fundi and besieged Gayeta; but they had turned\r\n      aside from the walls of Rome, and by their divisions, the Capitol\r\n      was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca. The same danger\r\n      still impended on the heads of the Roman people; and their\r\n      domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir.\r\n      They claimed the protection of their Latin sovereign; but the\r\n      Carlovingian standard was overthrown by a detachment of the\r\n      Barbarians: they meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors;\r\n      but the attempt was treasonable, and the succor remote and\r\n      precarious. 86 Their distress appeared to receive some\r\n      aggravation from the death of their spiritual and temporal chief;\r\n      but the pressing emergency superseded the forms and intrigues of\r\n      an election; and the unanimous choice of Pope Leo the Fourth 87\r\n      was the safety of the church and city. This pontiff was born a\r\n      Roman; the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in\r\n      his breast; and, amidst the ruins of his country, he stood erect,\r\n      like one of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads\r\n      above the fragments of the Roman forum. The first days of his\r\n      reign were consecrated to the purification and removal of relics,\r\n      to prayers and processions, and to all the solemn offices of\r\n      religion, which served at least to heal the imagination, and\r\n      restore the hopes, of the multitude. The public defence had been\r\n      long neglected, not from the presumption of peace, but from the\r\n      distress and poverty of the times. As far as the scantiness of\r\n      his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow, the\r\n      ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo; fifteen\r\n      towers, in the most accessible stations, were built or renewed;\r\n      two of these commanded on either side of the Tyber; and an iron\r\n      chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent of a\r\n      hostile navy. The Romans were assured of a short respite by the\r\n      welcome news, that the siege of Gayeta had been raised, and that\r\n      a part of the enemy, with their sacrilegious plunder, had\r\n      perished in the waves.\r\n\r\n      86 (return) [ One of the most eminent Romans (Gratianus, magister\r\n      militum et Romani palatii superista) was accused of declaring,\r\n      Quia Franci nihil nobis boni faciunt, neque adjutorium praebent,\r\n      sed magis quae nostra sunt violenter tollunt.

Generale, tom. ii. c. 38, p. 124)\r\n      appears to be remarkably struck with the character of Pope Leo\r\n      IV. I have borrowed his general expression, but the sight of the\r\n      forum has furnished me with a more distinct and lively image.]\r\n\r\n      But the storm, which had been delayed, soon burst upon them with\r\n      redoubled violence. The Aglabite, 88 who reigned in Africa, had\r\n      inherited from his father a treasure and an army: a fleet of\r\n      Arabs and Moors, after a short refreshment in the harbors of\r\n      Sardinia, cast anchor before the mouth of the Tyber, sixteen\r\n      miles from the city: and their discipline and numbers appeared to\r\n      threaten, not a transient inroad, but a serious design of\r\n      conquest and dominion. But the vigilance of Leo had formed an\r\n      alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire, the free and\r\n      maritime states of Gayeta, Naples, and Amalfi; and in the hour of\r\n      danger, their galleys appeared in the port of Ostia under the\r\n      command of Caesarius, the son of the Neapolitan duke, a noble and\r\n      valiant youth, who had already vanquished the fleets of the\r\n      Saracens. With his principal companions, Caesarius was invited to\r\n      the Lateran palace, and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire\r\n      their errand, and to accept with joy and surprise their\r\n      providential succor. The city bands, in arms, attended their\r\n      father to Ostia, where he reviewed and blessed his generous\r\n      deliverers. They kissed his feet, received the communion with\r\n      martial devotion, and listened to the prayer of Leo, that the\r\n      same God who had supported St. Peter and St. Paul on the waves of\r\n      the sea, would strengthen the hands of his champions against the\r\n      adversaries of his holy name. After a similar prayer, and with\r\n      equal resolution, the Moslems advanced to the attack of the\r\n      Christian galleys, which preserved their advantageous station\r\n      along the coast. The victory inclined to the side of the allies,\r\n      when it was less gloriously decided in their favor by a sudden\r\n      tempest, which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest\r\n      mariners. The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbor,\r\n      while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the\r\n      rocks and islands of a hostile shore. Those who escaped from\r\n      shipwreck and hunger neither found, nor deserved, mercy at the\r\n      hands of their implacable pursuers. The sword and the gibbet\r\n      reduced the dangerous multitude of captives; and the remainder\r\n      was more usefully employed, to restore the sacred edifices which\r\n      they had attempted to subvert. The pontiff, at the head of the\r\n      citizens and allies, paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of\r\n      the apostles; and, among the spoils of this naval victory,\r\n      thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended\r\n      round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee. The reign of Leo the\r\n      Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the Roman\r\n      state. The churches were renewed and embellished: near four\r\n      thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses\r\n      of St. Peter; and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of\r\n      gold of the weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds, embossed\r\n      with the portraits of the pope and emperor, and encircled with a\r\n      string of pearls. Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory\r\n      on the character of Leo than the paternal care with which he\r\n      rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria; and transported the\r\n      wandering inhabitants of Centumcellae to his new foundation of\r\n      Leopolis, twelve miles from the sea-shore. 89 By his liberality,\r\n      a colony of Corsicans, with their wives and children, was planted\r\n      in the station of Porto, at the mouth of the Tyber: the falling\r\n      city was restored for their use, the fields and vineyards were\r\n      divided among the new settlers: their first efforts were assisted\r\n      by a gift of horses and cattle; and the hardy exiles, who\r\n      breathed revenge against the Saracens, swore to live and die\r\n      under the standard of St. Peter. The nations of the West and\r\n      North who visited the threshold of the apostles had gradually\r\n      formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican, and their\r\n      various habitations were distinguished, in the language of the\r\n      times, as the schools of the Greeks and Goths, of the Lombards\r\n      and Saxons. But this venerable spot was still open to\r\n      sacrilegious insult: the design of enclosing it with walls and\r\n      towers exhausted all that authority could command, or charity\r\n      would supply: and the pious labor of four years was animated in\r\n      every season, and at every hour, by the presence of the\r\n      indefatigable pontiff. The love of fame, a generous but worldly\r\n      passion, may be detected in the name of the Leonine city, which\r\n      he bestowed on the Vatican; yet the pride of the dedication was\r\n      tempered with Christian penance and humility. The boundary was\r\n      trod by the bishop and his clergy, barefoot, in sackcloth and\r\n      ashes; the songs of triumph were modulated to psalms and\r\n      litanies; the walls were besprinkled with holy water; and the\r\n      ceremony was concluded with a prayer, that, under the guardian\r\n      care of the apostles and the angelic host, both the old and the\r\n      new Rome might ever be preserved pure, prosperous, and\r\n      impregnable. 90\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ De Guignes, Hist.

Paris;) and if a great part consist of\r\n      superstitious trifles, we must blame or command his hero, who was\r\n      much oftener in a church than in a camp.]\r\n\r\n      The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Stammerer, was one of\r\n      the most active and high-spirited princes who reigned at\r\n      Constantinople during the middle age. In offensive or defensive\r\n      war, he marched in person five times against the Saracens,\r\n      formidable in his attack, esteemed by the enemy in his losses and\r\n      defeats. In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into\r\n      Syria, and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra; the casual\r\n      birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father Harun was\r\n      attended in peace or war by the most favored of his wives and\r\n      concubines. The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that\r\n      moment the arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede in\r\n      favor of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree\r\n      of filial affection. These solicitations determined the emperor\r\n      to wound his pride in so sensible a part. Sozopetra was levelled\r\n      with the ground, the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated\r\n      with ignominious cruelty, and a thousand female captives were\r\n      forced away from the adjacent territory. Among these a matron of\r\n      the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of despair, the name of\r\n      Motassem; and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honor of her\r\n      kinsman to avenge his indignity, and to answer her appeal. Under\r\n      the reign of the two elder brothers, the inheritance of the\r\n      youngest had been confined to Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and\r\n      Circassia; this frontier station had exercised his military\r\n      talents; and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary,\r\n      91 the most meritorious are the eight battles which he gained or\r\n      fought against the enemies of the Koran. In this personal\r\n      quarrel, the troops of Irak, Syria, and Egypt, were recruited\r\n      from the tribes of Arabia and the Turkish hordes; his cavalry\r\n      might be numerous, though we should deduct some myriads from the\r\n      hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables; and the\r\n      expense of the armament was computed at four millions sterling,\r\n      or one hundred thousand pounds of gold. From Tarsus, the place of\r\n      assembly, the Saracens advanced in three divisions along the high\r\n      road of Constantinople: Motassem himself commanded the centre,\r\n      and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas, who, in the trial of\r\n      the first adventures, might succeed with the more glory, or fail\r\n      with the least reproach. In the revenge of his injury, the caliph\r\n      prepared to retaliate a similar affront. The father of Theophilus\r\n      was a native of Amorium 92 in Phrygia: the original seat of the\r\n      Imperial house had been adorned with privileges and monuments;\r\n      and, whatever might be the indifference of the people,\r\n      Constantinople itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of\r\n      the sovereign and his court. The name of Amorium was inscribed on\r\n      the shields of the Saracens; and their three armies were again\r\n      united under the walls of the devoted city. It had been proposed\r\n      by the wisest counsellors, to evacuate Amorium, to remove the\r\n      inhabitants, and to abandon the empty structures to the vain\r\n      resentment of the Barbarians. The emperor embraced the more\r\n      generous resolution of defending, in a siege and battle, the\r\n      country of his ancestors. When the armies drew near, the front of\r\n      the Mahometan line appeared to a Roman eye more closely planted\r\n      with spears and javelins; but the event of the action was not\r\n      glorious on either side to the national troops. The Arabs were\r\n      broken, but it was by the swords of thirty thousand Persians, who\r\n      had obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine empire. The\r\n      Greeks were repulsed and vanquished, but it was by the arrows of\r\n      the Turkish cavalry; and had not their bowstrings been damped and\r\n      relaxed by the evening rain, very few of the Christians could\r\n      have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle. They\r\n      breathed at Dorylaeum, at the distance of three days; and\r\n      Theophilus, reviewing his trembling squadrons, forgave the common\r\n      flight both of the prince and people. After this discovery of his\r\n      weakness, he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the\r\n      inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and\r\n      promises; and detained the Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses\r\n      of his great revenge. They had nearly been the witnesses of his\r\n      shame. The vigorous assaults of fifty-five days were encountered\r\n      by a faithful governor, a veteran garrison, and a desperate\r\n      people; and the Saracens must have raised the siege, if a\r\n      domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall,\r\n      a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a\r\n      bull. The vow of Motassem was accomplished with unrelenting\r\n      rigor: tired, rather than satiated, with destruction, he returned\r\n      to his new palace of Samara, in the neighborhood of Bagdad, while\r\n      the unfortunate 93 Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid\r\n      of his Western rival the emperor of the Franks. Yet in the siege\r\n      of Amorium about seventy thousand Moslems had perished: their\r\n      loss had been revenged by the slaughter of thirty thousand\r\n      Christians, and the sufferings of an equal number of captives,\r\n      who were treated as the most atrocious criminals. Mutual\r\n      necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of\r\n      prisoners: 94 but in the national and religious conflict of the\r\n      two empires, peace was without confidence, and war without mercy.\r\n      Quarter was seldom given in the field; those who escaped the edge\r\n      of the sword were condemned to hopeless servitude, or exquisite\r\n      torture; and a Catholic emperor relates, with visible\r\n      satisfaction, the execution of the Saracens of Crete, who were\r\n      flayed alive, or plunged into caldrons of boiling oil. 95 To a\r\n      point of honor Motassem had sacrificed a flourishing city, two\r\n      hundred thousand lives, and the property of millions. The same\r\n      caliph descended from his horse, and dirtied his robe, to relieve\r\n      the distress of a decrepit old man, who, with his laden ass, had\r\n      tumbled into a ditch.

When the Arabian conquerors had spread\r\n      themselves over the East, and were mingled with the servile\r\n      crowds of Persia, Syria, and Egypt, they insensibly lost the\r\n      freeborn and martial virtues of the desert. The courage of the\r\n      South is the artificial fruit of discipline and prejudice; the\r\n      active power of enthusiasm had decayed, and the mercenary forces\r\n      of the caliphs were recruited in those climates of the North, of\r\n      which valor is the hardy and spontaneous production. Of the Turks\r\n      97 who dwelt beyond the Oxus and Jaxartes, the robust youths,\r\n      either taken in war or purchased in trade, were educated in the\r\n      exercises of the field, and the profession of the Mahometan\r\n      faith. The Turkish guards stood in arms round the throne of their\r\n      benefactor, and their chiefs usurped the dominion of the palace\r\n      and the provinces. Motassem, the first author of this dangerous\r\n      example, introduced into the capital above fifty thousand Turks:\r\n      their licentious conduct provoked the public indignation, and the\r\n      quarrels of the soldiers and people induced the caliph to retire\r\n      from Bagdad, and establish his own residence and the camp of his\r\n      Barbarian favorites at Samara on the Tigris, about twelve leagues\r\n      above the city of Peace. 98 His son Motawakkel was a jealous and\r\n      cruel tyrant: odious to his subjects, he cast himself on the\r\n      fidelity of the strangers, and these strangers, ambitious and\r\n      apprehensive, were tempted by the rich promise of a revolution.\r\n      At the instigation, or at least in the cause of his son, they\r\n      burst into his apartment at the hour of supper, and the caliph\r\n      was cut into seven pieces by the same swords which he had\r\n      recently distributed among the guards of his life and throne. To\r\n      this throne, yet streaming with a father’s blood, Montasser was\r\n      triumphantly led; but in a reign of six months, he found only the\r\n      pangs of a guilty conscience. If he wept at the sight of an old\r\n      tapestry which represented the crime and punishment of the son of\r\n      Chosroes, if his days were abridged by grief and remorse, we may\r\n      allow some pity to a parricide, who exclaimed, in the bitterness\r\n      of death, that he had lost both this world and the world to come.\r\n      After this act of treason, the ensigns of royalty, the garment\r\n      and walking-staff of Mahomet, were given and torn away by the\r\n      foreign mercenaries, who in four years created, deposed, and\r\n      murdered, three commanders of the faithful. As often as the Turks\r\n      were inflamed by fear, or rage, or avarice, these caliphs were\r\n      dragged by the feet, exposed naked to the scorching sun, beaten\r\n      with iron clubs, and compelled to purchase, by the abdication of\r\n      their dignity, a short reprieve of inevitable fate. 99 At length,\r\n      however, the fury of the tempest was spent or diverted: the\r\n      Abbassides returned to the less turbulent residence of Bagdad;\r\n      the insolence of the Turks was curbed with a firmer and more\r\n      skilful hand, and their numbers were divided and destroyed in\r\n      foreign warfare. But the nations of the East had been taught to\r\n      trample on the successors of the prophet; and the blessings of\r\n      domestic peace were obtained by the relaxation of strength and\r\n      discipline.

How carefully soever the book of prophecy had been\r\n      sealed by the apostle of Mecca, the wishes, and (if we may\r\n      profane the word) even the reason, of fanaticism might believe\r\n      that, after the successive missions of Adam, Noah, Abraham,\r\n      Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet, the same God, in the fulness of time,\r\n      would reveal a still more perfect and permanent law. In the two\r\n      hundred and seventy-seventh year of the Hegira, and in the\r\n      neighborhood of Cufa, an Arabian preacher, of the name of\r\n      Carmath, assumed the lofty and incomprehensible style of the\r\n      Guide, the Director, the Demonstration, the Word, the Holy Ghost,\r\n      the Camel, the Herald of the Messiah, who had conversed with him\r\n      in a human shape, and the representative of Mohammed the son of\r\n      Ali, of St. John the Baptist, and of the angel Gabriel. In his\r\n      mystic volume, the precepts of the Koran were refined to a more\r\n      spiritual sense: he relaxed the duties of ablution, fasting, and\r\n      pilgrimage; allowed the indiscriminate use of wine and forbidden\r\n      food; and nourished the fervor of his disciples by the daily\r\n      repetition of fifty prayers. The idleness and ferment of the\r\n      rustic crowd awakened the attention of the magistrates of Cufa; a\r\n      timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect; and the\r\n      name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been\r\n      withdrawn from the world. His twelve apostles dispersed\r\n      themselves among the Bedoweens, “a race of men,” says Abulfeda,\r\n      “equally devoid of reason and of religion;” and the success of\r\n      their preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution.\r\n      The Carmathians were ripe for rebellion, since they disclaimed\r\n      the title of the house of Abbas, and abhorred the worldly pomp of\r\n      the caliphs of Bagdad. They were susceptible of discipline, since\r\n      they vowed a blind and absolute submission to their Imam, who was\r\n      called to the prophetic office by the voice of God and the\r\n      people. Instead of the legal tithes, he claimed the fifth of\r\n      their substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no more\r\n      than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were united and\r\n      concealed by an oath of secrecy. After a bloody conflict, they\r\n      prevailed in the province of Bahrein, along the Persian Gulf: far\r\n      and wide, the tribes of the desert were subject to the sceptre,\r\n      or rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher; and\r\n      these rebellious imams could muster in the field a hundred and\r\n      seven thousand fanatics. The mercenaries of the caliph were\r\n      dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor\r\n      accepted quarter; and the difference between, them in fortitude\r\n      and patience, is expressive of the change which three centuries\r\n      of prosperity had effected in the character of the Arabians. Such\r\n      troops were discomfited in every action; the cities of Racca and\r\n      Baalbec, of Cufa and Bassora, were taken and pillaged; Bagdad was\r\n      filled with consternation; and the caliph trembled behind the\r\n      veils of his palace. In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris, Abu\r\n      Taher advanced to the gates of the capital with no more than five\r\n      hundred horse. By the special order of Moctader, the bridges had\r\n      been broken down, and the person or head of the rebel was\r\n      expected every hour by the commander of the faithful. His\r\n      lieutenant, from a motive of fear or pity, apprised Abu Taher of\r\n      his danger, and recommended a speedy escape. “Your master,” said\r\n      the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger, “is at the head of\r\n      thirty thousand soldiers: three such men as these are wanting in\r\n      his host:” at the same instant, turning to three of his\r\n      companions, he commanded the first to plunge a dagger into his\r\n      breast, the second to leap into the Tigris, and the third to cast\r\n      himself headlong down a precipice. They obeyed without a murmur.\r\n\r\n      “Relate,” continued the imam, “what you have seen: before the\r\n      evening your general shall be chained among my dogs.” Before the\r\n      evening, the camp was surprised, and the menace was executed. The\r\n      rapine of the Carmathians was sanctified by their aversion to the\r\n      worship of Mecca: they robbed a caravan of pilgrims, and twenty\r\n      thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning sands to a\r\n      death of hunger and thirst. Another year they suffered the\r\n      pilgrims to proceed without interruption; but, in the festival of\r\n      devotion, Abu Taher stormed the holy city, and trampled on the\r\n      most venerable relics of the Mahometan faith. Thirty thousand\r\n      citizens and strangers were put to the sword; the sacred\r\n      precincts were polluted by the burial of three thousand dead\r\n      bodies; the well of Zemzem overflowed with blood; the golden\r\n      spout was forced from its place; the veil of the Caaba was\r\n      divided among these impious sectaries; and the black stone, the\r\n      first monument of the nation, was borne away in triumph to their\r\n      capital. After this deed of sacrilege and cruelty, they continued\r\n      to infest the confines of Irak, Syria, and Egypt: but the vital\r\n      principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root. Their scruples,\r\n      or their avarice, again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca, and\r\n      restored the black stone of the Caaba; and it is needless to\r\n      inquire into what factions they were broken, or by whose swords\r\n      they were finally extirpated. The sect of the Carmathians may be\r\n      considered as the second visible cause of the decline and fall of\r\n      the empire of the caliphs. 101\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ For the sect of the Carmathians, consult Elmacin,\r\n      (Hist.

The caliph Almamon might proudly assert, that\r\n      it was easier for him to rule the East and the West, than to\r\n      manage a chess-board of two feet square: 102 yet I suspect that\r\n      in both those games he was guilty of many fatal mistakes; and I\r\n      perceive, that in the distant provinces the authority of the\r\n      first and most powerful of the Abbassides was already impaired.\r\n      The analogy of despotism invests the representative with the full\r\n      majesty of the prince; the division and balance of powers might\r\n      relax the habits of obedience, might encourage the passive\r\n      subject to inquire into the origin and administration of civil\r\n      government. He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to\r\n      reign; but the elevation of a private man, of a peasant, perhaps,\r\n      or a slave, affords a strong presumption of his courage and\r\n      capacity. The viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the\r\n      property and inheritance of his precarious trust; the nations\r\n      must rejoice in the presence of their sovereign; and the command\r\n      of armies and treasures are at once the object and the instrument\r\n      of his ambition. A change was scarcely visible as long as the\r\n      lieutenants of the caliph were content with their vicarious\r\n      title; while they solicited for themselves or their sons a\r\n      renewal of the Imperial grant, and still maintained on the coin\r\n      and in the public prayers the name and prerogative of the\r\n      commander of the faithful. But in the long and hereditary\r\n      exercise of power, they assumed the pride and attributes of\r\n      royalty; the alternative of peace or war, of reward or\r\n      punishment, depended solely on their will; and the revenues of\r\n      their government were reserved for local services or private\r\n      magnificence. Instead of a regular supply of men and money, the\r\n      successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious\r\n      gift of an elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of silk hangings,\r\n      or some pounds of musk and amber. 103\r\n\r\n      102 (return) [ Hyde, Syntagma Dissertat. tom. ii. p. 57, in Hist.\r\n      Shahiludii.]\r\n\r\n      103 (return) [ The dynasties of the Arabian empire may be studied\r\n      in the Annals of Elmacin, Abulpharagius, and Abulfeda, under the\r\n      proper years, in the dictionary of D’Herbelot, under the proper\r\n      names. The tables of M. de Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i.)\r\n      exhibit a general chronology of the East, interspersed with some\r\n      historical anecdotes; but his attachment to national blood has\r\n      sometimes confounded the order of time and place.]\r\n\r\n      After the revolt of Spain from the temporal and spiritual\r\n      supremacy of the Abbassides, the first symptoms of disobedience\r\n      broke forth in the province of Africa. Ibrahim, the son of Aglab,\r\n      the lieutenant of the vigilant and rigid Harun, bequeathed to the\r\n      dynasty of the Aglabites the inheritance of his name and power.\r\n      The indolence or policy of the caliphs dissembled the injury and\r\n      loss, and pursued only with poison the founder of the Edrisites,\r\n      104 who erected the kingdom and city of Fez on the shores of the\r\n      Western ocean. 105 In the East, the first dynasty was that of the\r\n      Taherites; 106 the posterity of the valiant Taher, who, in the\r\n      civil wars of the sons of Harun, had served with too much zeal\r\n      and success the cause of Almamon, the younger brother. He was\r\n      sent into honorable exile, to command on the banks of the Oxus;\r\n      and the independence of his successors, who reigned in Chorasan\r\n      till the fourth generation, was palliated by their modest and\r\n      respectful demeanor, the happiness of their subjects and the\r\n      security of their frontier. They were supplanted by one of those\r\n      adventures so frequent in the annals of the East, who left his\r\n      trade of a brazier (from whence the name of Soffarides) for the\r\n      profession of a robber. In a nocturnal visit to the treasure of\r\n      the prince of Sistan, Jacob, the son of Leith, stumbled over a\r\n      lump of salt, which he unwarily tasted with his tongue. Salt,\r\n      among the Orientals, is the symbol of hospitality, and the pious\r\n      robber immediately retired without spoil or damage. The discovery\r\n      of this honorable behavior recommended Jacob to pardon and trust;\r\n      he led an army at first for his benefactor, at last for himself,\r\n      subdued Persia, and threatened the residence of the Abbassides.\r\n      On his march towards Bagdad, the conqueror was arrested by a\r\n      fever. He gave audience in bed to the ambassador of the caliph;\r\n      and beside him on a table were exposed a naked cimeter, a crust\r\n      of brown bread, and a bunch of onions. “If I die,” said he, “your\r\n      master is delivered from his fears. If I live, this must\r\n      determine between us. If I am vanquished, I can return without\r\n      reluctance to the homely fare of my youth.” From the height where\r\n      he stood, the descent would not have been so soft or harmless: a\r\n      timely death secured his own repose and that of the caliph, who\r\n      paid with the most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother\r\n      Amrou to the palaces of Shiraz and Ispahan. The Abbassides were\r\n      too feeble to contend, too proud to forgive: they invited the\r\n      powerful dynasty of the Samanides, who passed the Oxus with ten\r\n      thousand horse so poor, that their stirrups were of wood: so\r\n      brave, that they vanquished the Soffarian army, eight times more\r\n      numerous than their own. The captive Amrou was sent in chains, a\r\n      grateful offering to the court of Bagdad; and as the victor was\r\n      content with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan, the\r\n      realms of Persia returned for a while to the allegiance of the\r\n      caliphs. The provinces of Syria and Egypt were twice dismembered\r\n      by their Turkish slaves of the race of Toulon and Ilkshid. 107\r\n      These Barbarians, in religion and manners the countrymen of\r\n      Mahomet, emerged from the bloody factions of the palace to a\r\n      provincial command and an independent throne: their names became\r\n      famous and formidable in their time; but the founders of these\r\n      two potent dynasties confessed, either in words or actions, the\r\n      vanity of ambition. The first on his death-bed implored the mercy\r\n      of God to a sinner, ignorant of the limits of his own power: the\r\n      second, in the midst of four hundred thousand soldiers and eight\r\n      thousand slaves, concealed from every human eye the chamber where\r\n      he attempted to sleep. Their sons were educated in the vices of\r\n      kings; and both Egypt and Syria were recovered and possessed by\r\n      the Abbassides during an interval of thirty years. In the decline\r\n      of their empire, Mesopotamia, with the important cities of Mosul\r\n      and Aleppo, was occupied by the Arabian princes of the tribe of\r\n      Hamadan. The poets of their court could repeat without a blush,\r\n      that nature had formed their countenances for beauty, their\r\n      tongues for eloquence, and their hands for liberality and valor:\r\n      but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the\r\n      Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery, murder, and parricide.\r\n\r\n      At the same fatal period, the Persian kingdom was again usurped\r\n      by the dynasty of the Bowides, by the sword of three brothers,\r\n      who, under various names, were styled the support and columns of\r\n      the state, and who, from the Caspian Sea to the ocean, would\r\n      suffer no tyrants but themselves. Under their reign, the language\r\n      and genius of Persia revived, and the Arabs, three hundred and\r\n      four years after the death of Mahomet, were deprived of the\r\n      sceptre of the East.\r\n\r\n      104 (return) [ The Aglabites and Edrisites are the professed\r\n      subject of M. de Cardonne, (Hist. de l’Afrique et de l’Espagne\r\n      sous la Domination des Arabes, tom. ii. p. 1-63.)]\r\n\r\n      105 (return) [ To escape the reproach of error, I must criticize\r\n      the inaccuracies of M. de Guignes (tom. i. p. 359) concerning the\r\n      Edrisites. 1.

After him, the lords of the\r\n      Eastern world were reduced to the most abject misery, and exposed\r\n      to the blows and insults of a servile condition. The revolt of\r\n      the provinces circumscribed their dominions within the walls of\r\n      Bagdad: but that capital still contained an innumerable\r\n      multitude, vain of their past fortune, discontented with their\r\n      present state, and oppressed by the demands of a treasury which\r\n      had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tribute of\r\n      nations. Their idleness was exercised by faction and controversy.\r\n      Under the mask of piety, the rigid followers of Hanbal 109\r\n      invaded the pleasures of domestic life, burst into the houses of\r\n      plebeians and princes, the wine, broke the instruments, beat the\r\n      musicians, and dishonored, with infamous suspicions, the\r\n      associates of every handsome youth. In each profession, which\r\n      allowed room for two persons, the one was a votary, the other an\r\n      antagonist, of Ali; and the Abbassides were awakened by the\r\n      clamorous grief of the sectaries, who denied their title, and\r\n      cursed their progenitors. A turbulent people could only be\r\n      repressed by a military force; but who could satisfy the avarice\r\n      or assert the discipline of the mercenaries themselves? The\r\n      African and the Turkish guards drew their swords against each\r\n      other, and the chief commanders, the emirs al Omra, 110\r\n      imprisoned or deposed their sovereigns, and violated the\r\n      sanctuary of the mosch and harem. If the caliphs escaped to the\r\n      camp or court of any neighboring prince, their deliverance was a\r\n      change of servitude, till they were prompted by despair to invite\r\n      the Bowides, the sultans of Persia, who silenced the factions of\r\n      Bagdad by their irresistible arms. The civil and military powers\r\n      were assumed by Moezaldowlat, the second of the three brothers,\r\n      and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds sterling was assigned by\r\n      his generosity for the private expense of the commander of the\r\n      faithful. But on the fortieth day, at the audience of the\r\n      ambassadors of Chorasan, and in the presence of a trembling\r\n      multitude, the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon,\r\n      by the command of the stranger, and the rude hands of his\r\n      Dilamites. His palace was pillaged, his eyes were put out, and\r\n      the mean ambition of the Abbassides aspired to the vacant station\r\n      of danger and disgrace. In the school of adversity, the luxurious\r\n      caliphs resumed the grave and abstemious virtues of the primitive\r\n      times. Despoiled of their armor and silken robes, they fasted,\r\n      they prayed, they studied the Koran and the tradition of the\r\n      Sonnites: they performed, with zeal and knowledge, the functions\r\n      of their ecclesiastical character. The respect of nations still\r\n      waited on the successors of the apostle, the oracles of the law\r\n      and conscience of the faithful; and the weakness or division of\r\n      their tyrants sometimes restored the Abbassides to the\r\n      sovereignty of Bagdad. But their misfortunes had been imbittered\r\n      by the triumph of the Fatimites, the real or spurious progeny of\r\n      Ali. Arising from the extremity of Africa, these successful\r\n      rivals extinguished, in Egypt and Syria, both the spiritual and\r\n      temporal authority of the Abbassides; and the monarch of the Nile\r\n      insulted the humble pontiff on the banks of the Tigris.\r\n\r\n      108 (return) [ Hic est ultimus chalifah qui multum atque saepius\r\n      pro concione peroraret....

But when the Eastern world was convulsed and broken, the\r\n      Greeks were roused from their lethargy by the hopes of conquest\r\n      and revenge. The Byzantine empire, since the accession of the\r\n      Basilian race, had reposed in peace and dignity; and they might\r\n      encounter with their entire strength the front of some petty\r\n      emir, whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national\r\n      foes of the Mahometan faith. The lofty titles of the morning\r\n      star, and the death of the Saracens, 111 were applied in the\r\n      public acclamations to Nicephorus Phocas, a prince as renowned in\r\n      the camp, as he was unpopular in the city. In the subordinate\r\n      station of great domestic, or general of the East, he reduced the\r\n      Island of Crete, and extirpated the nest of pirates who had so\r\n      long defied, with impunity, the majesty of the empire. 112 His\r\n      military genius was displayed in the conduct and success of the\r\n      enterprise, which had so often failed with loss and dishonor. The\r\n      Saracens were confounded by the landing of his troops on safe and\r\n      level bridges, which he cast from the vessels to the shore. Seven\r\n      months were consumed in the siege of Candia; the despair of the\r\n      native Cretans was stimulated by the frequent aid of their\r\n      brethren of Africa and Spain; and after the massy wall and double\r\n      ditch had been stormed by the Greeks a hopeless conflict was\r\n      still maintained in the streets and houses of the city. 1121 The\r\n      whole island was subdued in the capital, and a submissive people\r\n      accepted, without resistance, the baptism of the conqueror. 113\r\n      Constantinople applauded the long-forgotten pomp of a triumph;\r\n      but the Imperial diadem was the sole reward that could repay the\r\n      services, or satisfy the ambition, of Nicephorus.\r\n\r\n      111 (return) [ Liutprand, whose choleric temper was imbittered by\r\n      his uneasy situation, suggests the names of reproach and contempt\r\n      more applicable to Nicephorus than the vain titles of the Greeks,\r\n      Ecce venit stella matutina, surgit Eous, reverberat obtutu solis\r\n      radios, pallida Saracenorum mors, Nicephorus.]\r\n\r\n      112 (return) [ Notwithstanding the insinuation of Zonaras, &c.,\r\n      (tom. ii. l. xvi. p. 197,) it is an undoubted fact, that Crete\r\n      was completely and finally subdued by Nicephorus Phocas, (Pagi,\r\n      Critica, tom. iii. p. 873-875.

They reigned as the guardians and colleagues\r\n      of her infant sons; and the twelve years of their military\r\n      command form the most splendid period of the Byzantine annals.\r\n      The subjects and confederates, whom they led to war, appeared, at\r\n      least in the eyes of an enemy, two hundred thousand strong; and\r\n      of these about thirty thousand were armed with cuirasses: 114 a\r\n      train of four thousand mules attended their march; and their\r\n      evening camp was regularly fortified with an enclosure of iron\r\n      spikes. A series of bloody and undecisive combats is nothing more\r\n      than an anticipation of what would have been effected in a few\r\n      years by the course of nature; but I shall briefly prosecute the\r\n      conquests of the two emperors from the hills of Cappadocia to the\r\n      desert of Bagdad. The sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, in\r\n      Cilicia, first exercised the skill and perseverance of their\r\n      troops, on whom, at this moment, I shall not hesitate to bestow\r\n      the name of Romans. In the double city of Mopsuestia, which is\r\n      divided by the River Sarus, two hundred thousand Moslems were\r\n      predestined to death or slavery, 115 a surprising degree of\r\n      population, which must at least include the inhabitants of the\r\n      dependent districts. They were surrounded and taken by assault;\r\n      but Tarsus was reduced by the slow progress of famine; and no\r\n      sooner had the Saracens yielded on honorable terms than they were\r\n      mortified by the distant and unprofitable view of the naval\r\n      succors of Egypt. They were dismissed with a safe-conduct to the\r\n      confines of Syria: a part of the old Christians had quietly lived\r\n      under their dominion; and the vacant habitations were replenished\r\n      by a new colony. But the mosch was converted into a stable; the\r\n      pulpit was delivered to the flames; many rich crosses of gold and\r\n      gems, the spoils of Asiatic churches, were made a grateful\r\n      offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor; and he\r\n      transported the gates of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, which were fixed\r\n      in the walls of Constantinople, an eternal monument of his\r\n      victory. After they had forced and secured the narrow passes of\r\n      Mount Amanus, the two Roman princes repeatedly carried their arms\r\n      into the heart of Syria. Yet, instead of assaulting the walls of\r\n      Antioch, the humanity or superstition of Nicephorus appeared to\r\n      respect the ancient metropolis of the East: he contented himself\r\n      with drawing round the city a line of circumvallation; left a\r\n      stationary army; and instructed his lieutenant to expect, without\r\n      impatience, the return of spring. But in the depth of winter, in\r\n      a dark and rainy night, an adventurous subaltern, with three\r\n      hundred soldiers, approached the rampart, applied his\r\n      scaling-ladders, occupied two adjacent towers, stood firm against\r\n      the pressure of multitudes, and bravely maintained his post till\r\n      he was relieved by the tardy, though effectual, support of his\r\n      reluctant chief. The first tumult of slaughter and rapine\r\n      subsided; the reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored; and the\r\n      efforts of a hundred thousand Saracens, of the armies of Syria\r\n      and the fleets of Africa, were consumed without effect before the\r\n      walls of Antioch. The royal city of Aleppo was subject to\r\n      Seifeddowlat, of the dynasty of Hamadan, who clouded his past\r\n      glory by the precipitate retreat which abandoned his kingdom and\r\n      capital to the Roman invaders. In his stately palace, that stood\r\n      without the walls of Aleppo, they joyfully seized a\r\n      well-furnished magazine of arms, a stable of fourteen hundred\r\n      mules, and three hundred bags of silver and gold. But the walls\r\n      of the city withstood the strokes of their battering-rams: and\r\n      the besiegers pitched their tents on the neighboring mountain of\r\n      Jaushan. Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen\r\n      and mercenaries; the guard of the gates and ramparts was\r\n      deserted; and while they furiously charged each other in the\r\n      market-place, they were surprised and destroyed by the sword of a\r\n      common enemy. The male sex was exterminated by the sword; ten\r\n      thousand youths were led into captivity; the weight of the\r\n      precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the beasts of\r\n      burden; the superfluous remainder was burnt; and, after a\r\n      licentious possession of ten days, the Romans marched away from\r\n      the naked and bleeding city. In their Syrian inroads they\r\n      commanded the husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they\r\n      themselves, in the ensuing season, might reap the benefit; more\r\n      than a hundred cities were reduced to obedience; and eighteen\r\n      pulpits of the principal moschs were committed to the flames to\r\n      expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of Mahomet. The classic\r\n      names of Hierapolis, Apamea, and Emesa, revive for a moment in\r\n      the list of conquest: the emperor Zimisces encamped in the\r\n      paradise of Damascus, and accepted the ransom of a submissive\r\n      people; and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnable\r\n      fortress of Tripoli, on the sea-coast of Phoenicia. Since the\r\n      days of Heraclius, the Euphrates, below the passage of Mount\r\n      Taurus, had been impervious, and almost invisible, to the Greeks.\r\n\r\n      The river yielded a free passage to the victorious Zimisces; and\r\n      the historian may imitate the speed with which he overran the\r\n      once famous cities of Samosata, Edessa, Martyropolis, Amida, 116\r\n      and Nisibis, the ancient limit of the empire in the neighborhood\r\n      of the Tigris. His ardor was quickened by the desire of grasping\r\n      the virgin treasures of Ecbatana, 117 a well-known name, under\r\n      which the Byzantine writer has concealed the capital of the\r\n      Abbassides. The consternation of the fugitives had already\r\n      diffused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of Bagdad\r\n      had already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of\r\n      domestic tyrants. The prayers of the people, and the stern\r\n      demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the caliph to\r\n      provide for the defence of the city. The helpless Mothi replied,\r\n      that his arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn\r\n      from his hands, and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which\r\n      he was unable to support. The emir was inexorable; the furniture\r\n      of the palace was sold; and the paltry price of forty thousand\r\n      pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury. But the\r\n      apprehensions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the\r\n      Greeks: thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia; and\r\n      the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with Oriental spoils,\r\n      returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his triumph, the\r\n      silk, the aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and\r\n      silver. Yet the powers of the East had been bent, not broken, by\r\n      this transient hurricane. After the departure of the Greeks, the\r\n      fugitive princes returned to their capitals; the subjects\r\n      disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; the Moslems\r\n      again purified their temples, and overturned the idols of the\r\n      saints and martyrs; the Nestorians and Jacobites preferred a\r\n      Saracen to an orthodox master; and the numbers and spirit of the\r\n      Melchites were inadequate to the support of the church and state.\r\n\r\n      Of these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of Cilicia\r\n      and the Isle of Cyprus, was alone restored, a permanent and\r\n      useful accession to the Roman empire. 118\r\n\r\n      114 (return) [ Elmacin, Hist.

We open with curiosity and respect the royal\r\n      volumes of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, 1 which he composed at a\r\n      mature age for the instruction of his son, and which promise to\r\n      unfold the state of the eastern empire, both in peace and war,\r\n      both at home and abroad. In the first of these works he minutely\r\n      describes the pompous ceremonies of the church and palace of\r\n      Constantinople, according to his own practice, and that of his\r\n      predecessors. 2 In the second, he attempts an accurate survey of\r\n      the provinces, the themes, as they were then denominated, both of\r\n      Europe and Asia. 3 The system of Roman tactics, the discipline\r\n      and order of the troops, and the military operations by land and\r\n      sea, are explained in the third of these didactic collections,\r\n      which may be ascribed to Constantine or his father Leo. 4 In the\r\n      fourth, of the administration of the empire, he reveals the\r\n      secrets of the Byzantine policy, in friendly or hostile\r\n      intercourse with the nations of the earth. The literary labors of\r\n      the age, the practical systems of law, agriculture, and history,\r\n      might redound to the benefit of the subject and the honor of the\r\n      Macedonian princes. The sixty books of the Basilics, 5 the code\r\n      and pandects of civil jurisprudence, were gradually framed in the\r\n      three first reigns of that prosperous dynasty. The art of\r\n      agriculture had amused the leisure, and exercised the pens, of\r\n      the best and wisest of the ancients; and their chosen precepts\r\n      are comprised in the twenty books of the Geoponics 6 of\r\n      Constantine. At his command, the historical examples of vice and\r\n      virtue were methodized in fifty-three books, 7 and every citizen\r\n      might apply, to his contemporaries or himself, the lesson or the\r\n      warning of past times. From the august character of a legislator,\r\n      the sovereign of the East descends to the more humble office of a\r\n      teacher and a scribe; and if his successors and subjects were\r\n      regardless of his paternal cares, we may inherit and enjoy the\r\n      everlasting legacy.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ The epithet of Porphyrogenitus, born in the purple,\r\n      is elegantly defined by Claudian:— Ardua privatos nescit fortuna\r\n      Penates; Et regnum cum luce dedit.

Vindel. 1603) and\r\n      de Virtutibus et Vitiis, (by Henry Valesius, or de Valois, Paris,\r\n      1634.)]\r\n\r\n      A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift, and the\r\n      gratitude of posterity: in the possession of these Imperial\r\n      treasures we may still deplore our poverty and ignorance; and the\r\n      fading glories of their authors will be obliterated by\r\n      indifference or contempt. The Basilics will sink to a broken\r\n      copy, a partial and mutilated version, in the Greek language, of\r\n      the laws of Justinian; but the sense of the old civilians is\r\n      often superseded by the influence of bigotry: and the absolute\r\n      prohibition of divorce, concubinage, and interest for money,\r\n      enslaves the freedom of trade and the happiness of private life.\r\n      In the historical book, a subject of Constantine might admire the\r\n      inimitable virtues of Greece and Rome: he might learn to what a\r\n      pitch of energy and elevation the human character had formerly\r\n      aspired. But a contrary effect must have been produced by a new\r\n      edition of the lives of the saints, which the great logothete, or\r\n      chancellor of the empire, was directed to prepare; and the dark\r\n      fund of superstition was enriched by the fabulous and florid\r\n      legends of Simon the Metaphrast. 8 The merits and miracles of the\r\n      whole calendar are of less account in the eyes of a sage, than\r\n      the toil of a single husbandman, who multiplies the gifts of the\r\n      Creator, and supplies the food of his brethren. Yet the royal\r\n      authors of the Geoponics were more seriously employed in\r\n      expounding the precepts of the destroying art, which had been\r\n      taught since the days of Xenophon, 9 as the art of heroes and\r\n      kings. But the Tactics of Leo and Constantine are mingled with\r\n      the baser alloy of the age in which they lived. It was destitute\r\n      of original genius; they implicitly transcribe the rules and\r\n      maxims which had been confirmed by victories. It was unskilled in\r\n      the propriety of style and method; they blindly confound the most\r\n      distant and discordant institutions, the phalanx of Sparta and\r\n      that of Macedon, the legions of Cato and Trajan, of Augustus and\r\n      Theodosius. Even the use, or at least the importance, of these\r\n      military rudiments may be fairly questioned: their general theory\r\n      is dictated by reason; but the merit, as well as difficulty,\r\n      consists in the application. The discipline of a soldier is\r\n      formed by exercise rather than by study: the talents of a\r\n      commander are appropriated to those calm, though rapid, minds,\r\n      which nature produces to decide the fate of armies and nations:\r\n      the former is the habit of a life, the latter the glance of a\r\n      moment; and the battles won by lessons of tactics may be numbered\r\n      with the epic poems created from the rules of criticism. The book\r\n      of ceremonies is a recital, tedious yet imperfect, of the\r\n      despicable pageantry which had infected the church and state\r\n      since the gradual decay of the purity of the one and the power of\r\n      the other. A review of the themes or provinces might promise such\r\n      authentic and useful information, as the curiosity of government\r\n      only can obtain, instead of traditionary fables on the origin of\r\n      the cities, and malicious epigrams on the vices of their\r\n      inhabitants. 10 Such information the historian would have been\r\n      pleased to record; nor should his silence be condemned if the\r\n      most interesting objects, the population of the capital and\r\n      provinces, the amount of the taxes and revenues, the numbers of\r\n      subjects and strangers who served under the Imperial standard,\r\n      have been unnoticed by Leo the philosopher, and his son\r\n      Constantine. His treatise of the public administration is stained\r\n      with the same blemishes; yet it is discriminated by peculiar\r\n      merit; the antiquities of the nations may be doubtful or\r\n      fabulous; but the geography and manners of the Barbaric world are\r\n      delineated with curious accuracy. Of these nations, the Franks\r\n      alone were qualified to observe in their turn, and to describe,\r\n      the metropolis of the East. The ambassador of the great Otho, a\r\n      bishop of Cremona, has painted the state of Constantinople about\r\n      the middle of the tenth century: his style is glowing, his\r\n      narrative lively, his observation keen; and even the prejudices\r\n      and passions of Liutprand are stamped with an original character\r\n      of freedom and genius. 11 From this scanty fund of foreign and\r\n      domestic materials, I shall investigate the form and substance of\r\n      the Byzantine empire; the provinces and wealth, the civil\r\n      government and military force, the character and literature, of\r\n      the Greeks in a period of six hundred years, from the reign of\r\n      Heraclius to his successful invasion of the Franks or Latins.\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ The life and writings of Simon Metaphrastes are\r\n      described by Hankius, (de Scriptoribus Byzant. p. 418-460.) This\r\n      biographer of the saints indulged himself in a loose paraphrase\r\n      of the sense or nonsense of more ancient acts. His Greek rhetoric\r\n      is again paraphrased in the Latin version of Surius, and scarcely\r\n      a thread can be now visible of the original texture.]\r\n\r\n      9 (return) [ According to the first book of the Cyropaedia,\r\n      professors of tactics, a small part of the science of war, were\r\n      already instituted in Persia, by which Greece must be understood.\r\n      A good edition of all the Scriptores Tactici would be a task not\r\n      unworthy of a scholar.

But as the Paris wits are seldom read in the Anthology, I\r\n      should be curious to learn, through what channel it was conveyed\r\n      for their imitation, (Constantin.

The\r\n      weakness of Constantinople was concealed by extent of dominion:\r\n      her limits were inviolate, or at least entire; and the kingdom of\r\n      Justinian was enlarged by the splendid acquisition of Africa and\r\n      Italy. But the possession of these new conquests was transient\r\n      and precarious; and almost a moiety of the Eastern empire was\r\n      torn away by the arms of the Saracens. Syria and Egypt were\r\n      oppressed by the Arabian caliphs; and, after the reduction of\r\n      Africa, their lieutenants invaded and subdued the Roman province\r\n      which had been changed into the Gothic monarchy of Spain. The\r\n      islands of the Mediterranean were not inaccessible to their naval\r\n      powers; and it was from their extreme stations, the harbors of\r\n      Crete and the fortresses of Cilicia, that the faithful or rebel\r\n      emirs insulted the majesty of the throne and capital. The\r\n      remaining provinces, under the obedience of the emperors, were\r\n      cast into a new mould; and the jurisdiction of the presidents,\r\n      the consulars, and the counts were superseded by the institution\r\n      of the themes, 12 or military governments, which prevailed under\r\n      the successors of Heraclius, and are described by the pen of the\r\n      royal author. Of the twenty-nine themes, twelve in Europe and\r\n      seventeen in Asia, the origin is obscure, the etymology doubtful\r\n      or capricious: the limits were arbitrary and fluctuating; but\r\n      some particular names, that sound the most strangely to our ear,\r\n      were derived from the character and attributes of the troops that\r\n      were maintained at the expense, and for the guard, of the\r\n      respective divisions. The vanity of the Greek princes most\r\n      eagerly grasped the shadow of conquest and the memory of lost\r\n      dominion. A new Mesopotamia was created on the western side of\r\n      the Euphrates: the appellation and praetor of Sicily were\r\n      transferred to a narrow slip of Calabria; and a fragment of the\r\n      duchy of Beneventum was promoted to the style and title of the\r\n      theme of Lombardy. In the decline of the Arabian empire, the\r\n      successors of Constantine might indulge their pride in more solid\r\n      advantages. The victories of Nicephorus, John Zimisces, and Basil\r\n      the Second, revived the fame, and enlarged the boundaries, of the\r\n      Roman name: the province of Cilicia, the metropolis of Antioch,\r\n      the islands of Crete and Cyprus, were restored to the allegiance\r\n      of Christ and Caesar: one third of Italy was annexed to the\r\n      throne of Constantinople: the kingdom of Bulgaria was destroyed;\r\n      and the last sovereigns of the Macedonian dynasty extended their\r\n      sway from the sources of the Tigris to the neighborhood of Rome.\r\n      In the eleventh century, the prospect was again clouded by new\r\n      enemies and new misfortunes: the relics of Italy were swept away\r\n      by the Norman adventures; and almost all the Asiatic branches\r\n      were dissevered from the Roman trunk by the Turkish conquerors.\r\n      After these losses, the emperors of the Comnenian family\r\n      continued to reign from the Danube to Peloponnesus, and from\r\n      Belgrade to Nice, Trebizond, and the winding stream of the\r\n      Meander. The spacious provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece,\r\n      were obedient to their sceptre; the possession of Cyprus, Rhodes,\r\n      and Crete, was accompanied by the fifty islands of the Aegean or\r\n      Holy Sea; 13 and the remnant of their empire transcends the\r\n      measure of the largest of the European kingdoms.\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ See Constantine de Thematibus, in Banduri, tom. i.\r\n      p. 1-30.

Analyse de la Carte de la\r\n      Greece, p. 60.) The numbers of monks or caloyers in all the\r\n      islands and the adjacent mountain of Athos, (Observations de\r\n      Belon, fol. 32, verso,) monte santo, might justify the epithet of\r\n      holy, a slight alteration from the original, imposed by the\r\n      Dorians, who, in their dialect, gave the figurative name of\r\n      goats, to the bounding waves, (Vossius, apud Cellarium, Geograph.\r\n      Antiq. tom. i. p. 829.)]\r\n\r\n      The same princes might assert, with dignity and truth, that of\r\n      all the monarchs of Christendom they possessed the greatest city,\r\n      14 the most ample revenue, the most flourishing and populous\r\n      state. With the decline and fall of the empire, the cities of the\r\n      West had decayed and fallen; nor could the ruins of Rome, or the\r\n      mud walls, wooden hovels, and narrow precincts of Paris and\r\n      London, prepare the Latin stranger to contemplate the situation\r\n      and extent of Constantinople, her stately palaces and churches,\r\n      and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people. Her treasures\r\n      might attract, but her virgin strength had repelled, and still\r\n      promised to repel, the audacious invasion of the Persian and\r\n      Bulgarian, the Arab and the Russian. The provinces were less\r\n      fortunate and impregnable; and few districts, few cities, could\r\n      be discovered which had not been violated by some fierce\r\n      Barbarian, impatient to despoil, because he was hopeless to\r\n      possess. From the age of Justinian the Eastern empire was sinking\r\n      below its former level; the powers of destruction were more\r\n      active than those of improvement; and the calamities of war were\r\n      imbittered by the more permanent evils of civil and\r\n      ecclesiastical tyranny. The captive who had escaped from the\r\n      Barbarians was often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of\r\n      his sovereign: the Greek superstition relaxed the mind by prayer,\r\n      and emaciated the body by fasting; and the multitude of convents\r\n      and festivals diverted many hands and many days from the temporal\r\n      service of mankind. Yet the subjects of the Byzantine empire were\r\n      still the most dexterous and diligent of nations; their country\r\n      was blessed by nature with every advantage of soil, climate, and\r\n      situation; and, in the support and restoration of the arts, their\r\n      patient and peaceful temper was more useful than the warlike\r\n      spirit and feudal anarchy of Europe. The provinces that still\r\n      adhered to the empire were repeopled and enriched by the\r\n      misfortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost. From the yoke\r\n      of the caliphs, the Catholics of Syria, Egypt, and Africa retired\r\n      to the allegiance of their prince, to the society of their\r\n      brethren: the movable wealth, which eludes the search of\r\n      oppression, accompanied and alleviated their exile, and\r\n      Constantinople received into her bosom the fugitive trade of\r\n      Alexandria and Tyre. The chiefs of Armenia and Scythia, who fled\r\n      from hostile or religious persecution, were hospitably\r\n      entertained: their followers were encouraged to build new cities\r\n      and to cultivate waste lands; and many spots, both in Europe and\r\n      Asia, preserved the name, the manners, or at least the memory, of\r\n      these national colonies. Even the tribes of Barbarians, who had\r\n      seated themselves in arms on the territory of the empire, were\r\n      gradually reclaimed to the laws of the church and state; and as\r\n      long as they were separated from the Greeks, their posterity\r\n      supplied a race of faithful and obedient soldiers. Did we possess\r\n      sufficient materials to survey the twenty-nine themes of the\r\n      Byzantine monarchy, our curiosity might be satisfied with a\r\n      chosen example: it is fortunate enough that the clearest light\r\n      should be thrown on the most interesting province, and the name\r\n      of Peloponnesus will awaken the attention of the classic reader.\r\n\r\n      14 (return) [ According to the Jewish traveller who had visited\r\n      Europe and Asia, Constantinople was equalled only by Bagdad, the\r\n      great city of the Ismaelites, (Voyage de Benjamin de Tudele, par\r\n      Baratier, tom. l. c. v. p. 46.)]\r\n\r\n      As early as the eighth century, in the troubled reign of the\r\n      Iconoclasts, Greece, and even Peloponnesus, 15 were overrun by\r\n      some Sclavonian bands who outstripped the royal standard of\r\n      Bulgaria. The strangers of old, Cadmus, and Danaus, and Pelops,\r\n      had planted in that fruitful soil the seeds of policy and\r\n      learning; but the savages of the north eradicated what yet\r\n      remained of their sickly and withered roots. In this irruption,\r\n      the country and the inhabitants were transformed; the Grecian\r\n      blood was contaminated; and the proudest nobles of Peloponnesus\r\n      were branded with the names of foreigners and slaves. By the\r\n      diligence of succeeding princes, the land was in some measure\r\n      purified from the Barbarians; and the humble remnant was bound by\r\n      an oath of obedience, tribute, and military service, which they\r\n      often renewed and often violated. The siege of Patras was formed\r\n      by a singular concurrence of the Sclavonians of Peloponnesus and\r\n      the Saracens of Africa. In their last distress, a pious fiction\r\n      of the approach of the praetor of Corinth revived the courage of\r\n      the citizens. Their sally was bold and successful; the strangers\r\n      embarked, the rebels submitted, and the glory of the day was\r\n      ascribed to a phantom or a stranger, who fought in the foremost\r\n      ranks under the character of St. Andrew the Apostle. The shrine\r\n      which contained his relics was decorated with the trophies of\r\n      victory, and the captive race was forever devoted to the service\r\n      and vassalage of the metropolitan church of Patras. By the revolt\r\n      of two Sclavonian tribes, in the neighborhood of Helos and\r\n      Lacedaemon, the peace of the peninsula was often disturbed. They\r\n      sometimes insulted the weakness, and sometimes resisted the\r\n      oppression, of the Byzantine government, till at length the\r\n      approach of their hostile brethren extorted a golden bull to\r\n      define the rites and obligations of the Ezzerites and Milengi,\r\n      whose annual tribute was defined at twelve hundred pieces of\r\n      gold. From these strangers the Imperial geographer has accurately\r\n      distinguished a domestic, and perhaps original, race, who, in\r\n      some degree, might derive their blood from the much-injured\r\n      Helots. The liberality of the Romans, and especially of Augustus,\r\n      had enfranchised the maritime cities from the dominion of Sparta;\r\n      and the continuance of the same benefit ennobled them with the\r\n      title of Eleuthero, or Free-Laconians. 16 In the time of\r\n      Constantine Porphyrogenitus, they had acquired the name of\r\n      Mainotes, under which they dishonor the claim of liberty by the\r\n      inhuman pillage of all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores.\r\n      Their territory, barren of corn, but fruitful of olives, extended\r\n      to the Cape of Malea: they accepted a chief or prince from the\r\n      Byzantine praetor, and a light tribute of four hundred pieces of\r\n      gold was the badge of their immunity, rather than of their\r\n      dependence. The freemen of Laconia assumed the character of\r\n      Romans, and long adhered to the religion of the Greeks. By the\r\n      zeal of the emperor Basil, they were baptized in the faith of\r\n      Christ: but the altars of Venus and Neptune had been crowned by\r\n      these rustic votaries five hundred years after they were\r\n      proscribed in the Roman world. In the theme of Peloponnesus, 17\r\n      forty cities were still numbered, and the declining state of\r\n      Sparta, Argos, and Corinth, may be suspended in the tenth\r\n      century, at an equal distance, perhaps, between their antique\r\n      splendor and their present desolation. The duty of military\r\n      service, either in person or by substitute, was imposed on the\r\n      lands or benefices of the province; a sum of five pieces of gold\r\n      was assessed on each of the substantial tenants; and the same\r\n      capitation was shared among several heads of inferior value. On\r\n      the proclamation of an Italian war, the Peloponnesians excused\r\n      themselves by a voluntary oblation of one hundred pounds of gold,\r\n      (four thousand pounds sterling,) and a thousand horses with their\r\n      arms and trappings. The churches and monasteries furnished their\r\n      contingent; a sacrilegious profit was extorted from the sale of\r\n      ecclesiastical honors; and the indigent bishop of Leucadia 18 was\r\n      made responsible for a pension of one hundred pieces of gold. 19\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ Says Constantine, (Thematibus, l. ii. c. vi. p.\r\n      25,) in a style as barbarous as the idea, which he confirms, as\r\n      usual, by a foolish epigram.

This\r\n      denomination may be fairly applied or extended to the\r\n      manufacturers of linen, woollen, and more especially of silk: the\r\n      two former of which had flourished in Greece since the days of\r\n      Homer; and the last was introduced perhaps as early as the reign\r\n      of Justinian. These arts, which were exercised at Corinth,\r\n      Thebes, and Argos, afforded food and occupation to a numerous\r\n      people: the men, women, and children were distributed according\r\n      to their age and strength; and, if many of these were domestic\r\n      slaves, their masters, who directed the work and enjoyed the\r\n      profit, were of a free and honorable condition. The gifts which a\r\n      rich and generous matron of Peloponnesus presented to the emperor\r\n      Basil, her adopted son, were doubtless fabricated in the Grecian\r\n      looms. Danielis bestowed a carpet of fine wool, of a pattern\r\n      which imitated the spots of a peacock’s tail, of a magnitude to\r\n      overspread the floor of a new church, erected in the triple name\r\n      of Christ, of Michael the archangel, and of the prophet Elijah.\r\n      She gave six hundred pieces of silk and linen, of various use and\r\n      denomination: the silk was painted with the Tyrian dye, and\r\n      adorned by the labors of the needle; and the linen was so\r\n      exquisitely fine, that an entire piece might be rolled in the\r\n      hollow of a cane. 20 In his description of the Greek\r\n      manufactures, an historian of Sicily discriminates their price,\r\n      according to the weight and quality of the silk, the closeness of\r\n      the texture, the beauty of the colors, and the taste and\r\n      materials of the embroidery. A single, or even a double or treble\r\n      thread was thought sufficient for ordinary sale; but the union of\r\n      six threads composed a piece of stronger and more costly\r\n      workmanship. Among the colors, he celebrates, with affectation of\r\n      eloquence, the fiery blaze of the scarlet, and the softer lustre\r\n      of the green. The embroidery was raised either in silk or gold:\r\n      the more simple ornament of stripes or circles was surpassed by\r\n      the nicer imitation of flowers: the vestments that were\r\n      fabricated for the palace or the altar often glittered with\r\n      precious stones; and the figures were delineated in strings of\r\n      Oriental pearls. 21 Till the twelfth century, Greece alone, of\r\n      all the countries of Christendom, was possessed of the insect who\r\n      is taught by nature, and of the workmen who are instructed by\r\n      art, to prepare this elegant luxury. But the secret had been\r\n      stolen by the dexterity and diligence of the Arabs: the caliphs\r\n      of the East and West scorned to borrow from the unbelievers their\r\n      furniture and apparel; and two cities of Spain, Almeria and\r\n      Lisbon, were famous for the manufacture, the use, and, perhaps,\r\n      the exportation, of silk. It was first introduced into Sicily by\r\n      the Normans; and this emigration of trade distinguishes the\r\n      victory of Roger from the uniform and fruitless hostilities of\r\n      every age. After the sack of Corinth, Athens, and Thebes, his\r\n      lieutenant embarked with a captive train of weavers and\r\n      artificers of both sexes, a trophy glorious to their master, and\r\n      disgraceful to the Greek emperor. 22 The king of Sicily was not\r\n      insensible of the value of the present; and, in the restitution\r\n      of the prisoners, he excepted only the male and female\r\n      manufacturers of Thebes and Corinth, who labor, says the\r\n      Byzantine historian, under a barbarous lord, like the old\r\n      Eretrians in the service of Darius. 23 A stately edifice, in the\r\n      palace of Palermo, was erected for the use of this industrious\r\n      colony; 24 and the art was propagated by their children and\r\n      disciples to satisfy the increasing demand of the western world.\r\n      The decay of the looms of Sicily may be ascribed to the troubles\r\n      of the island, and the competition of the Italian cities. In the\r\n      year thirteen hundred and fourteen, Lucca alone, among her sister\r\n      republics, enjoyed the lucrative monopoly. 25 A domestic\r\n      revolution dispersed the manufacturers to Florence, Bologna,\r\n      Venice, Milan, and even the countries beyond the Alps; and\r\n      thirteen years after this event the statutes of Modena enjoin the\r\n      planting of mulberry-trees, and regulate the duties on raw silk.\r\n      26 The northern climates are less propitious to the education of\r\n      the silkworm; but the industry of France and England 27 is\r\n      supplied and enriched by the productions of Italy and China.\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ See Constantine, (in Vit.

From every\r\n      province of Europe and Asia the rivulets of gold and silver\r\n      discharged into the Imperial reservoir a copious and perennial\r\n      stream. The separation of the branches from the trunk increased\r\n      the relative magnitude of Constantinople; and the maxims of\r\n      despotism contracted the state to the capital, the capital to the\r\n      palace, and the palace to the royal person. A Jewish traveller,\r\n      who visited the East in the twelfth century, is lost in his\r\n      admiration of the Byzantine riches. “It is here,” says Benjamin\r\n      of Tudela, “in the queen of cities, that the tributes of the\r\n      Greek empire are annually deposited and the lofty towers are\r\n      filled with precious magazines of silk, purple, and gold. It is\r\n      said, that Constantinople pays each day to her sovereign twenty\r\n      thousand pieces of gold; which are levied on the shops, taverns,\r\n      and markets, on the merchants of Persia and Egypt, of Russia and\r\n      Hungary, of Italy and Spain, who frequent the capital by sea and\r\n      land.” 28 In all pecuniary matters, the authority of a Jew is\r\n      doubtless respectable; but as the three hundred and sixty-five\r\n      days would produce a yearly income exceeding seven millions\r\n      sterling, I am tempted to retrench at least the numerous\r\n      festivals of the Greek calendar. The mass of treasure that was\r\n      saved by Theodora and Basil the Second will suggest a splendid,\r\n      though indefinite, idea of their supplies and resources. The\r\n      mother of Michael, before she retired to a cloister, attempted to\r\n      check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful son, by a free\r\n      and faithful account of the wealth which he inherited; one\r\n      hundred and nine thousand pounds of gold, and three hundred\r\n      thousand of silver, the fruits of her own economy and that of her\r\n      deceased husband. 29 The avarice of Basil is not less renowned\r\n      than his valor and fortune: his victorious armies were paid and\r\n      rewarded without breaking into the mass of two hundred thousand\r\n      pounds of gold, (about eight millions sterling,) which he had\r\n      buried in the subterraneous vaults of the palace. 30 Such\r\n      accumulation of treasure is rejected by the theory and practice\r\n      of modern policy; and we are more apt to compute the national\r\n      riches by the use and abuse of the public credit. Yet the maxims\r\n      of antiquity are still embraced by a monarch formidable to his\r\n      enemies; by a republic respectable to her allies; and both have\r\n      attained their respective ends of military power and domestic\r\n      tranquillity.\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ Voyage de Benjamin de Tudele, tom. i. c. 5, p.\r\n      44-52.

The princes\r\n      of Constantinople were far removed from the simplicity of nature;\r\n      yet, with the revolving seasons, they were led by taste or\r\n      fashion to withdraw to a purer air, from the smoke and tumult of\r\n      the capital. They enjoyed, or affected to enjoy, the rustic\r\n      festival of the vintage: their leisure was amused by the exercise\r\n      of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing, and in the\r\n      summer heats, they were shaded from the sun, and refreshed by the\r\n      cooling breezes from the sea. The coasts and islands of Asia and\r\n      Europe were covered with their magnificent villas; but, instead\r\n      of the modest art which secretly strives to hide itself and to\r\n      decorate the scenery of nature, the marble structure of their\r\n      gardens served only to expose the riches of the lord, and the\r\n      labors of the architect. The successive casualties of inheritance\r\n      and forfeiture had rendered the sovereign proprietor of many\r\n      stately houses in the city and suburbs, of which twelve were\r\n      appropriated to the ministers of state; but the great palace, 31\r\n      the centre of the Imperial residence, was fixed during eleven\r\n      centuries to the same position, between the hippodrome, the\r\n      cathedral of St. Sophia, and the gardens, which descended by many\r\n      a terrace to the shores of the Propontis. The primitive edifice\r\n      of the first Constantine was a copy, or rival, of ancient Rome;\r\n      the gradual improvements of his successors aspired to emulate the\r\n      wonders of the old world, 32 and in the tenth century, the\r\n      Byzantine palace excited the admiration, at least of the Latins,\r\n      by an unquestionable preeminence of strength, size, and\r\n      magnificence. 33 But the toil and treasure of so many ages had\r\n      produced a vast and irregular pile: each separate building was\r\n      marked with the character of the times and of the founder; and\r\n      the want of space might excuse the reigning monarch, who\r\n      demolished, perhaps with secret satisfaction, the works of his\r\n      predecessors. The economy of the emperor Theophilus allowed a\r\n      more free and ample scope for his domestic luxury and splendor. A\r\n      favorite ambassador, who had astonished the Abbassides themselves\r\n      by his pride and liberality, presented on his return the model of\r\n      a palace, which the caliph of Bagdad had recently constructed on\r\n      the banks of the Tigris. The model was instantly copied and\r\n      surpassed: the new buildings of Theophilus 34 were accompanied\r\n      with gardens, and with five churches, one of which was\r\n      conspicuous for size and beauty: it was crowned with three domes,\r\n      the roof of gilt brass reposed on columns of Italian marble, and\r\n      the walls were incrusted with marbles of various colors. In the\r\n      face of the church, a semicircular portico, of the figure and\r\n      name of the Greek sigma, was supported by fifteen columns of\r\n      Phrygian marble, and the subterraneous vaults were of a similar\r\n      construction. The square before the sigma was decorated with a\r\n      fountain, and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed\r\n      with plates of silver. In the beginning of each season, the\r\n      basin, instead of water, was replenished with the most exquisite\r\n      fruits, which were abandoned to the populace for the\r\n      entertainment of the prince. He enjoyed this tumultuous spectacle\r\n      from a throne resplendent with gold and gems, which was raised by\r\n      a marble staircase to the height of a lofty terrace. Below the\r\n      throne were seated the officers of his guards, the magistrates,\r\n      the chiefs of the factions of the circus; the inferior steps were\r\n      occupied by the people, and the place below was covered with\r\n      troops of dancers, singers, and pantomimes. The square was\r\n      surrounded by the hall of justice, the arsenal, and the various\r\n      offices of business and pleasure; and the purple chamber was\r\n      named from the annual distribution of robes of scarlet and purple\r\n      by the hand of the empress herself. The long series of the\r\n      apartments was adapted to the seasons, and decorated with marble\r\n      and porphyry, with painting, sculpture, and mosaics, with a\r\n      profusion of gold, silver, and precious stones. His fanciful\r\n      magnificence employed the skill and patience of such artists as\r\n      the times could afford: but the taste of Athens would have\r\n      despised their frivolous and costly labors; a golden tree, with\r\n      its leaves and branches, which sheltered a multitude of birds\r\n      warbling their artificial notes, and two lions of massy gold, and\r\n      of natural size, who looked and roared like their brethren of the\r\n      forest. The successors of Theophilus, of the Basilian and\r\n      Comnenian dynasties, were not less ambitious of leaving some\r\n      memorial of their residence; and the portion of the palace most\r\n      splendid and august was dignified with the title of the golden\r\n      triclinium. 35 With becoming modesty, the rich and noble Greeks\r\n      aspired to imitate their sovereign, and when they passed through\r\n      the streets on horseback, in their robes of silk and embroidery,\r\n      they were mistaken by the children for kings. 36 A matron of\r\n      Peloponnesus, 37 who had cherished the infant fortunes of Basil\r\n      the Macedonian, was excited by tenderness or vanity to visit the\r\n      greatness of her adopted son. In a journey of five hundred miles\r\n      from Patras to Constantinople, her age or indolence declined the\r\n      fatigue of a horse or carriage: the soft litter or bed of\r\n      Danielis was transported on the shoulders of ten robust slaves;\r\n      and as they were relieved at easy distances, a band of three\r\n      hundred were selected for the performance of this service. She\r\n      was entertained in the Byzantine palace with filial reverence,\r\n      and the honors of a queen; and whatever might be the origin of\r\n      her wealth, her gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity. I\r\n      have already described the fine and curious manufactures of\r\n      Peloponnesus, of linen, silk, and woollen; but the most\r\n      acceptable of her presents consisted in three hundred beautiful\r\n      youths, of whom one hundred were eunuchs; 38 “for she was not\r\n      ignorant,” says the historian, “that the air of the palace is\r\n      more congenial to such insects, than a shepherd’s dairy to the\r\n      flies of the summer.” During her lifetime, she bestowed the\r\n      greater part of her estates in Peloponnesus, and her testament\r\n      instituted Leo, the son of Basil, her universal heir. After the\r\n      payment of the legacies, fourscore villas or farms were added to\r\n      the Imperial domain; and three thousand slaves of Danielis were\r\n      enfranchised by their new lord, and transplanted as a colony to\r\n      the Italian coast. From this example of a private matron, we may\r\n      estimate the wealth and magnificence of the emperors.

Above a thousand years, from Vespasian to Alexius\r\n      Comnenus, 39 the Caesar was the second person, or at least the\r\n      second degree, after the supreme title of Augustus was more\r\n      freely communicated to the sons and brothers of the reigning\r\n      monarch. To elude without violating his promise to a powerful\r\n      associate, the husband of his sister, and, without giving himself\r\n      an equal, to reward the piety of his brother Isaac, the crafty\r\n      Alexius interposed a new and supereminent dignity. The happy\r\n      flexibility of the Greek tongue allowed him to compound the names\r\n      of Augustus and Emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator,) and the union\r\n      produces the sonorous title of Sebastocrator. He was exalted\r\n      above the Caesar on the first step of the throne: the public\r\n      acclamations repeated his name; and he was only distinguished\r\n      from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments of the head and\r\n      feet. The emperor alone could assume the purple or red buskins,\r\n      and the close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion of the\r\n      Persian kings. 40 It was a high pyramidal cap of cloth or silk,\r\n      almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels: the crown\r\n      was formed by a horizontal circle and two arches of gold: at the\r\n      summit, the point of their intersection, was placed a globe or\r\n      cross, and two strings or lappets of pearl depended on either\r\n      cheek. Instead of red, the buskins of the Sebastocrator and\r\n      Caesar were green; and on their open coronets or crowns, the\r\n      precious gems were more sparingly distributed. Beside and below\r\n      the Caesar the fancy of Alexius created the Panhypersebastos and\r\n      the Protosebastos, whose sound and signification will satisfy a\r\n      Grecian ear. They imply a superiority and a priority above the\r\n      simple name of Augustus; and this sacred and primitive title of\r\n      the Roman prince was degraded to the kinsmen and servants of the\r\n      Byzantine court. The daughter of Alexius applauds, with fond\r\n      complacency, this artful gradation of hopes and honors; but the\r\n      science of words is accessible to the meanest capacity; and this\r\n      vain dictionary was easily enriched by the pride of his\r\n      successors. To their favorite sons or brothers, they imparted the\r\n      more lofty appellation of Lord or Despot, which was illustrated\r\n      with new ornaments, and prerogatives, and placed immediately\r\n      after the person of the emperor himself. The five titles of, 1.\r\n      Despot; 2. Sebastocrator; 3. Caesar; 4. Panhypersebastos; and, 5.\r\n      Protosebastos; were usually confined to the princes of his blood:\r\n      they were the emanations of his majesty; but as they exercised no\r\n      regular functions, their existence was useless, and their\r\n      authority precarious.\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ See the Alexiad (l. iii. p. 78, 79) of Anna\r\n      Comnena, who, except in filial piety, may be compared to\r\n      Mademoiselle de Montpensier.

The titles alone can differ; and in\r\n      the revolution of ages, the counts and praefects, the praetor and\r\n      quaestor, insensibly descended, while their servants rose above\r\n      their heads to the first honors of the state. 1. In a monarchy,\r\n      which refers every object to the person of the prince, the care\r\n      and ceremonies of the palace form the most respectable\r\n      department. The Curopalata, 41 so illustrious in the age of\r\n      Justinian, was supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primitive\r\n      functions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe. From\r\n      thence his jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of\r\n      pomp and luxury; and he presided with his silver wand at the\r\n      public and private audience. 2. In the ancient system of\r\n      Constantine, the name of Logothete, or accountant, was applied to\r\n      the receivers of the finances: the principal officers were\r\n      distinguished as the Logothetes of the domain, of the posts, the\r\n      army, the private and public treasure; and the great Logothete,\r\n      the supreme guardian of the laws and revenues, is compared with\r\n      the chancellor of the Latin monarchies. 42 His discerning eye\r\n      pervaded the civil administration; and he was assisted, in due\r\n      subordination, by the eparch or praefect of the city, the first\r\n      secretary, and the keepers of the privy seal, the archives, and\r\n      the red or purple ink which was reserved for the sacred signature\r\n      of the emperor alone. 43 The introductor and interpreter of\r\n      foreign ambassadors were the great Chiauss 44 and the Dragoman,\r\n      45 two names of Turkish origin, and which are still familiar to\r\n      the Sublime Porte. 3. From the humble style and service of\r\n      guards, the Domestics insensibly rose to the station of generals;\r\n      the military themes of the East and West, the legions of Europe\r\n      and Asia, were often divided, till the great Domestic was finally\r\n      invested with the universal and absolute command of the land\r\n      forces. The Protostrator, in his original functions, was the\r\n      assistant of the emperor when he mounted on horseback: he\r\n      gradually became the lieutenant of the great Domestic in the\r\n      field; and his jurisdiction extended over the stables, the\r\n      cavalry, and the royal train of hunting and hawking. The\r\n      Stratopedarch was the great judge of the camp: the Protospathaire\r\n      commanded the guards; the Constable, 46 the great Aeteriarch, and\r\n      the Acolyth, were the separate chiefs of the Franks, the\r\n      Barbarians, and the Varangi, or English, the mercenary strangers,\r\n      who, at the decay of the national spirit, formed the nerve of the\r\n      Byzantine armies. 4. The naval powers were under the command of\r\n      the great Duke; in his absence they obeyed the great Drungaire of\r\n      the fleet; and, in his place, the Emir, or Admiral, a name of\r\n      Saracen extraction, 47 but which has been naturalized in all the\r\n      modern languages of Europe. Of these officers, and of many more\r\n      whom it would be useless to enumerate, the civil and military\r\n      hierarchy was framed. Their honors and emoluments, their dress\r\n      and titles, their mutual salutations and respective preeminence,\r\n      were balanced with more exquisite labor than would have fixed the\r\n      constitution of a free people; and the code was almost perfect\r\n      when this baseless fabric, the monument of pride and servitude,\r\n      was forever buried in the ruins of the empire. 48\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ Par exstans curis, solo diademate dispar, Ordine\r\n      pro rerum vocitatus Cura-Palati, says the African Corippus, (de\r\n      Laudibus Justini, l. i. 136,) and in the same century (the vith)\r\n      Cassiodorus represents him, who, virga aurea decoratus, inter\r\n      numerosa obsequia primus ante pedes regis incederet (Variar. vii.\r\n      5.)

The mode of adoration, 49 of falling prostrate on the\r\n      ground, and kissing the feet of the emperor, was borrowed by\r\n      Diocletian from Persian servitude; but it was continued and\r\n      aggravated till the last age of the Greek monarchy. Excepting\r\n      only on Sundays, when it was waived, from a motive of religious\r\n      pride, this humiliating reverence was exacted from all who\r\n      entered the royal presence, from the princes invested with the\r\n      diadem and purple, and from the ambassadors who represented their\r\n      independent sovereigns, the caliphs of Asia, Egypt, or Spain, the\r\n      kings of France and Italy, and the Latin emperors of ancient\r\n      Rome. In his transactions of business, Liutprand, bishop of\r\n      Cremona, 50 asserted the free spirit of a Frank and the dignity\r\n      of his master Otho. Yet his sincerity cannot disguise the\r\n      abasement of his first audience. When he approached the throne,\r\n      the birds of the golden tree began to warble their notes, which\r\n      were accompanied by the roarings of the two lions of gold. With\r\n      his two companions Liutprand was compelled to bow and to fall\r\n      prostrate; and thrice to touch the ground with his forehead. He\r\n      arose, but in the short interval, the throne had been hoisted\r\n      from the floor to the ceiling, the Imperial figure appeared in\r\n      new and more gorgeous apparel, and the interview was concluded in\r\n      haughty and majestic silence. In this honest and curious\r\n      narrative, the Bishop of Cremona represents the ceremonies of the\r\n      Byzantine court, which are still practised in the Sublime Porte,\r\n      and which were preserved in the last age by the dukes of Muscovy\r\n      or Russia. After a long journey by sea and land, from Venice to\r\n      Constantinople, the ambassador halted at the golden gate, till he\r\n      was conducted by the formal officers to the hospitable palace\r\n      prepared for his reception; but this palace was a prison, and his\r\n      jealous keepers prohibited all social intercourse either with\r\n      strangers or natives. At his first audience, he offered the gifts\r\n      of his master, slaves, and golden vases, and costly armor. The\r\n      ostentatious payment of the officers and troops displayed before\r\n      his eyes the riches of the empire: he was entertained at a royal\r\n      banquet, 51 in which the ambassadors of the nations were\r\n      marshalled by the esteem or contempt of the Greeks: from his own\r\n      table, the emperor, as the most signal favor, sent the plates\r\n      which he had tasted; and his favorites were dismissed with a robe\r\n      of honor. 52 In the morning and evening of each day, his civil\r\n      and military servants attended their duty in the palace; their\r\n      labors were repaid by the sight, perhaps by the smile, of their\r\n      lord; his commands were signified by a nod or a sign: but all\r\n      earthly greatness stood silent and submissive in his presence. In\r\n      his regular or extraordinary processions through the capital, he\r\n      unveiled his person to the public view: the rites of policy were\r\n      connected with those of religion, and his visits to the principal\r\n      churches were regulated by the festivals of the Greek calendar.\r\n      On the eve of these processions, the gracious or devout intention\r\n      of the monarch was proclaimed by the heralds. The streets were\r\n      cleared and purified; the pavement was strewed with flowers; the\r\n      most precious furniture, the gold and silver plate, and silken\r\n      hangings, were displayed from the windows and balconies, and a\r\n      severe discipline restrained and silenced the tumult of the\r\n      populace. The march was opened by the military officers at the\r\n      head of their troops: they were followed in long order by the\r\n      magistrates and ministers of the civil government: the person of\r\n      the emperor was guarded by his eunuchs and domestics, and at the\r\n      church door he was solemnly received by the patriarch and his\r\n      clergy. The task of applause was not abandoned to the rude and\r\n      spontaneous voices of the crowd. The most convenient stations\r\n      were occupied by the bands of the blue and green factions of the\r\n      circus; and their furious conflicts, which had shaken the\r\n      capital, were insensibly sunk to an emulation of servitude. From\r\n      either side they echoed in responsive melody the praises of the\r\n      emperor; their poets and musicians directed the choir, and long\r\n      life 53 and victory were the burden of every song. The same\r\n      acclamations were performed at the audience, the banquet, and the\r\n      church; and as an evidence of boundless sway, they were repeated\r\n      in the Latin, 54 Gothic, Persian, French, and even English\r\n      language, 55 by the mercenaries who sustained the real or\r\n      fictitious character of those nations. By the pen of Constantine\r\n      Porphyrogenitus, this science of form and flattery has been\r\n      reduced into a pompous and trifling volume, 56 which the vanity\r\n      of succeeding times might enrich with an ample supplement. Yet\r\n      the calmer reflection of a prince would surely suggest that the\r\n      same acclamations were applied to every character and every\r\n      reign: and if he had risen from a private rank, he might\r\n      remember, that his own voice had been the loudest and most eager\r\n      in applause, at the very moment when he envied the fortune, or\r\n      conspired against the life, of his predecessor. 57\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ The respectful salutation of carrying the hand to\r\n      the mouth, ad os, is the root of the Latin word adoro, adorare.\r\n      See our learned Selden, (vol. iii. p. 143-145, 942,) in his\r\n      Titles of Honor.

Such had ever been the opinion\r\n      and practice of the sage Romans: their jurisprudence proscribed\r\n      the marriage of a citizen and a stranger: in the days of freedom\r\n      and virtue, a senator would have scorned to match his daughter\r\n      with a king: the glory of Mark Antony was sullied by an Egyptian\r\n      wife: 59 and the emperor Titus was compelled, by popular censure,\r\n      to dismiss with reluctance the reluctant Berenice. 60 This\r\n      perpetual interdict was ratified by the fabulous sanction of the\r\n      great Constantine. The ambassadors of the nations, more\r\n      especially of the unbelieving nations, were solemnly admonished,\r\n      that such strange alliances had been condemned by the founder of\r\n      the church and city. The irrevocable law was inscribed on the\r\n      altar of St. Sophia; and the impious prince who should stain the\r\n      majesty of the purple was excluded from the civil and\r\n      ecclesiastical communion of the Romans. If the ambassadors were\r\n      instructed by any false brethren in the Byzantine history, they\r\n      might produce three memorable examples of the violation of this\r\n      imaginary law: the marriage of Leo, or rather of his father\r\n      Constantine the Fourth, with the daughter of the king of the\r\n      Chozars, the nuptials of the granddaughter of Romanus with a\r\n      Bulgarian prince, and the union of Bertha of France or Italy with\r\n      young Romanus, the son of Constantine Porphyrogenitus himself. To\r\n      these objections three answers were prepared, which solved the\r\n      difficulty and established the law. I.\r\n\r\n      The deed and the guilt of Constantine Copronymus were\r\n      acknowledged. The Isaurian heretic, who sullied the baptismal\r\n      font, and declared war against the holy images, had indeed\r\n      embraced a Barbarian wife. By this impious alliance he\r\n      accomplished the measure of his crimes, and was devoted to the\r\n      just censure of the church and of posterity. II. Romanus could\r\n      not be alleged as a legitimate emperor; he was a plebeian\r\n      usurper, ignorant of the laws, and regardless of the honor, of\r\n      the monarchy. His son Christopher, the father of the bride, was\r\n      the third in rank in the college of princes, at once the subject\r\n      and the accomplice of a rebellious parent. The Bulgarians were\r\n      sincere and devout Christians; and the safety of the empire, with\r\n      the redemption of many thousand captives, depended on this\r\n      preposterous alliance. Yet no consideration could dispense from\r\n      the law of Constantine: the clergy, the senate, and the people,\r\n      disapproved the conduct of Romanus; and he was reproached, both\r\n      in his life and death, as the author of the public disgrace. III.\r\n      For the marriage of his own son with the daughter of Hugo, king\r\n      of Italy, a more honorable defence is contrived by the wise\r\n      Porphyrogenitus. Constantine, the great and holy, esteemed the\r\n      fidelity and valor of the Franks; 61 and his prophetic spirit\r\n      beheld the vision of their future greatness. They alone were\r\n      excepted from the general prohibition: Hugo, king of France, was\r\n      the lineal descendant of Charlemagne; 62 and his daughter Bertha\r\n      inherited the prerogatives of her family and nation. The voice of\r\n      truth and malice insensibly betrayed the fraud or error of the\r\n      Imperial court. The patrimonial estate of Hugo was reduced from\r\n      the monarchy of France to the simple county of Arles; though it\r\n      was not denied, that, in the confusion of the times, he had\r\n      usurped the sovereignty of Provence, and invaded the kingdom of\r\n      Italy. His father was a private noble; and if Bertha derived her\r\n      female descent from the Carlovingian line, every step was\r\n      polluted with illegitimacy or vice. The grandmother of Hugo was\r\n      the famous Valdrada, the concubine, rather than the wife, of the\r\n      second Lothair; whose adultery, divorce, and second nuptials, had\r\n      provoked against him the thunders of the Vatican. His mother, as\r\n      she was styled, the great Bertha, was successively the wife of\r\n      the count of Arles and of the marquis of Tuscany: France and\r\n      Italy were scandalized by her gallantries; and, till the age of\r\n      threescore, her lovers, of every degree, were the zealous\r\n      servants of her ambition. The example of maternal incontinence\r\n      was copied by the king of Italy; and the three favorite\r\n      concubines of Hugo were decorated with the classic names of\r\n      Venus, Juno, and Semele. 63 The daughter of Venus was granted to\r\n      the solicitations of the Byzantine court: her name of Bertha was\r\n      changed to that of Eudoxia; and she was wedded, or rather\r\n      betrothed, to young Romanus, the future heir of the empire of the\r\n      East. The consummation of this foreign alliance was suspended by\r\n      the tender age of the two parties; and, at the end of five years,\r\n      the union was dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse. The\r\n      second wife of the emperor Romanus was a maiden of plebeian, but\r\n      of Roman, birth; and their two daughters, Theophano and Anne,\r\n      were given in marriage to the princes of the earth. The eldest\r\n      was bestowed, as the pledge of peace, on the eldest son of the\r\n      great Otho, who had solicited this alliance with arms and\r\n      embassies. It might legally be questioned how far a Saxon was\r\n      entitled to the privilege of the French nation; but every scruple\r\n      was silenced by the fame and piety of a hero who had restored the\r\n      empire of the West. After the death of her father-in-law and\r\n      husband, Theophano governed Rome, Italy, and Germany, during the\r\n      minority of her son, the third Otho; and the Latins have praised\r\n      the virtues of an empress, who sacrificed to a superior duty the\r\n      remembrance of her country. 64 In the nuptials of her sister\r\n      Anne, every prejudice was lost, and every consideration of\r\n      dignity was superseded, by the stronger argument of necessity and\r\n      fear. A Pagan of the North, Wolodomir, great prince of Russia,\r\n      aspired to a daughter of the Roman purple; and his claim was\r\n      enforced by the threats of war, the promise of conversion, and\r\n      the offer of a powerful succor against a domestic rebel. A victim\r\n      of her religion and country, the Grecian princess was torn from\r\n      the palace of her fathers, and condemned to a savage reign, and a\r\n      hopeless exile on the banks of the Borysthenes, or in the\r\n      neighborhood of the Polar circle. 65 Yet the marriage of Anne was\r\n      fortunate and fruitful: the daughter of her grandson Joroslaus\r\n      was recommended by her Imperial descent; and the king of France,\r\n      Henry I., sought a wife on the last borders of Europe and\r\n      Christendom. 66\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ The xiiith chapter, de Administratione Imperii, may\r\n      be explained and rectified by the Familiae Byzantinae of\r\n      Ducange.]\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [ Sequiturque nefas Aegyptia conjux, (Virgil, Aeneid,\r\n      viii. 688.)

An embassy of bishops was sent into\r\n      Russia, and the father gratanter filiam cum multis donis misit.\r\n      This event happened in the year 1051. See the passages of the\r\n      original chronicles in Bouquet’s Historians of France, (tom. xi.\r\n      p. 29, 159, 161, 319, 384, 481.)

But the lives and fortunes of\r\n      millions hung on his arbitrary will; and the firmest minds,\r\n      superior to the allurements of pomp and luxury, may be seduced by\r\n      the more active pleasure of commanding their equals. The\r\n      legislative and executive powers were centred in the person of\r\n      the monarch, and the last remains of the authority of the senate\r\n      were finally eradicated by Leo the philosopher. 67 A lethargy of\r\n      servitude had benumbed the minds of the Greeks: in the wildest\r\n      tumults of rebellion they never aspired to the idea of a free\r\n      constitution; and the private character of the prince was the\r\n      only source and measure of their public happiness. Superstition\r\n      rivetted their chains; in the church of St. Sophia he was\r\n      solemnly crowned by the patriarch; at the foot of the altar, they\r\n      pledged their passive and unconditional obedience to his\r\n      government and family. On his side he engaged to abstain as much\r\n      as possible from the capital punishments of death and mutilation;\r\n      his orthodox creed was subscribed with his own hand, and he\r\n      promised to obey the decrees of the seven synods, and the canons\r\n      of the holy church. 68 But the assurance of mercy was loose and\r\n      indefinite: he swore, not to his people, but to an invisible\r\n      judge; and except in the inexpiable guilt of heresy, the\r\n      ministers of heaven were always prepared to preach the\r\n      indefeasible right, and to absolve the venial transgressions, of\r\n      their sovereign. The Greek ecclesiastics were themselves the\r\n      subjects of the civil magistrate: at the nod of a tyrant, the\r\n      bishops were created, or transferred, or deposed, or punished\r\n      with an ignominious death: whatever might be their wealth or\r\n      influence, they could never succeed like the Latin clergy in the\r\n      establishment of an independent republic; and the patriarch of\r\n      Constantinople condemned, what he secretly envied, the temporal\r\n      greatness of his Roman brother. Yet the exercise of boundless\r\n      despotism is happily checked by the laws of nature and necessity.\r\n      In proportion to his wisdom and virtue, the master of an empire\r\n      is confined to the path of his sacred and laborious duty. In\r\n      proportion to his vice and folly, he drops the sceptre too\r\n      weighty for his hands; and the motions of the royal image are\r\n      ruled by the imperceptible thread of some minister or favorite,\r\n      who undertakes for his private interest to exercise the task of\r\n      the public oppression. In some fatal moment, the most absolute\r\n      monarch may dread the reason or the caprice of a nation of\r\n      slaves; and experience has proved, that whatever is gained in the\r\n      extent, is lost in the safety and solidity, of regal power.\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ A constitution of Leo the Philosopher (lxxviii.) ne\r\n      senatus consulta amplius fiant, speaks the language of naked\r\n      despotism.]\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ Codinus (de Officiis, c. xvii. p. 120, 121) gives\r\n      an idea of this oath so strong to the church, so weak to the\r\n      people.]\r\n\r\n      Whatever titles a despot may assume, whatever claims he may\r\n      assert, it is on the sword that he must ultimately depend to\r\n      guard him against his foreign and domestic enemies. From the age\r\n      of Charlemagne to that of the Crusades, the world (for I overlook\r\n      the remote monarchy of China) was occupied and disputed by the\r\n      three great empires or nations of the Greeks, the Saracens, and\r\n      the Franks. Their military strength may be ascertained by a\r\n      comparison of their courage, their arts and riches, and their\r\n      obedience to a supreme head, who might call into action all the\r\n      energies of the state. The Greeks, far inferior to their rivals\r\n      in the first, were superior to the Franks, and at least equal to\r\n      the Saracens, in the second and third of these warlike\r\n      qualifications.\r\n\r\n      The wealth of the Greeks enabled them to purchase the service of\r\n      the poorer nations, and to maintain a naval power for the\r\n      protection of their coasts and the annoyance of their enemies. 69\r\n      A commerce of mutual benefit exchanged the gold of Constantinople\r\n      for the blood of Sclavonians and Turks, the Bulgarians and\r\n      Russians: their valor contributed to the victories of Nicephorus\r\n      and Zimisces; and if a hostile people pressed too closely on the\r\n      frontier, they were recalled to the defence of their country, and\r\n      the desire of peace, by the well-managed attack of a more distant\r\n      tribe. 70 The command of the Mediterranean, from the mouth of the\r\n      Tanais to the columns of Hercules, was always claimed, and often\r\n      possessed, by the successors of Constantine. Their capital was\r\n      filled with naval stores and dexterous artificers: the situation\r\n      of Greece and Asia, the long coasts, deep gulfs, and numerous\r\n      islands, accustomed their subjects to the exercise of navigation;\r\n      and the trade of Venice and Amalfi supplied a nursery of seamen\r\n      to the Imperial fleet. 71 Since the time of the Peloponnesian and\r\n      Punic wars, the sphere of action had not been enlarged; and the\r\n      science of naval architecture appears to have declined. The art\r\n      of constructing those stupendous machines which displayed three,\r\n      or six, or ten, ranges of oars, rising above, or falling behind,\r\n      each other, was unknown to the ship-builders of Constantinople,\r\n      as well as to the mechanicians of modern days. 72 The Dromones,\r\n      73 or light galleys of the Byzantine empire, were content with\r\n      two tier of oars; each tier was composed of five-and-twenty\r\n      benches; and two rowers were seated on each bench, who plied\r\n      their oars on either side of the vessel. To these we must add the\r\n      captain or centurion, who, in time of action, stood erect with\r\n      his armor-bearer on the poop, two steersmen at the helm, and two\r\n      officers at the prow, the one to manage the anchor, the other to\r\n      point and play against the enemy the tube of liquid fire. The\r\n      whole crew, as in the infancy of the art, performed the double\r\n      service of mariners and soldiers; they were provided with\r\n      defensive and offensive arms, with bows and arrows, which they\r\n      used from the upper deck, with long pikes, which they pushed\r\n      through the portholes of the lower tier. Sometimes, indeed, the\r\n      ships of war were of a larger and more solid construction; and\r\n      the labors of combat and navigation were more regularly divided\r\n      between seventy soldiers and two hundred and thirty mariners. But\r\n      for the most part they were of the light and manageable size; and\r\n      as the Cape of Malea in Peloponnesus was still clothed with its\r\n      ancient terrors, an Imperial fleet was transported five miles\r\n      over land across the Isthmus of Corinth. 74 The principles of\r\n      maritime tactics had not undergone any change since the time of\r\n      Thucydides: a squadron of galleys still advanced in a crescent,\r\n      charged to the front, and strove to impel their sharp beaks\r\n      against the feeble sides of their antagonists. A machine for\r\n      casting stones and darts was built of strong timbers, in the\r\n      midst of the deck; and the operation of boarding was effected by\r\n      a crane that hoisted baskets of armed men. The language of\r\n      signals, so clear and copious in the naval grammar of the\r\n      moderns, was imperfectly expressed by the various positions and\r\n      colors of a commanding flag. In the darkness of the night, the\r\n      same orders to chase, to attack, to halt, to retreat, to break,\r\n      to form, were conveyed by the lights of the leading galley. By\r\n      land, the fire-signals were repeated from one mountain to\r\n      another; a chain of eight stations commanded a space of five\r\n      hundred miles; and Constantinople in a few hours was apprised of\r\n      the hostile motions of the Saracens of Tarsus. 75 Some estimate\r\n      may be formed of the power of the Greek emperors, by the curious\r\n      and minute detail of the armament which was prepared for the\r\n      reduction of Crete. A fleet of one hundred and twelve galleys,\r\n      and seventy-five vessels of the Pamphylian style, was equipped in\r\n      the capital, the islands of the Aegean Sea, and the seaports of\r\n      Asia, Macedonia, and Greece. It carried thirty-four thousand\r\n      mariners, seven thousand three hundred and forty soldiers, seven\r\n      hundred Russians, and five thousand and eighty-seven Mardaites,\r\n      whose fathers had been transplanted from the mountains of\r\n      Libanus. Their pay, most probably of a month, was computed at\r\n      thirty-four centenaries of gold, about one hundred and thirty-six\r\n      thousand pounds sterling. Our fancy is bewildered by the endless\r\n      recapitulation of arms and engines, of clothes and linen, of\r\n      bread for the men and forage for the horses, and of stores and\r\n      utensils of every description, inadequate to the conquest of a\r\n      petty island, but amply sufficient for the establishment of a\r\n      flourishing colony. 76\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ If we listen to the threats of Nicephorus to the\r\n      ambassador of Otho, Nec est in mari domino tuo classium numerus.\r\n      Navigantium fortitudo mihi soli inest, qui eum classibus\r\n      aggrediar, bello maritimas ejus civitates demoliar; et quae\r\n      fluminibus sunt vicina redigam in favillam.

To these liquid\r\n      combustibles the city and empire of Constantine owed their\r\n      deliverance; and they were employed in sieges and sea-fights with\r\n      terrible effect. But they were either less improved, or less\r\n      susceptible of improvement: the engines of antiquity, the\r\n      catapultae, balistae, and battering-rams, were still of most\r\n      frequent and powerful use in the attack and defence of\r\n      fortifications; nor was the decision of battles reduced to the\r\n      quick and heavy fire of a line of infantry, whom it were\r\n      fruitless to protect with armor against a similar fire of their\r\n      enemies. Steel and iron were still the common instruments of\r\n      destruction and safety; and the helmets, cuirasses, and shields,\r\n      of the tenth century did not, either in form or substance,\r\n      essentially differ from those which had covered the companions of\r\n      Alexander or Achilles. 77 But instead of accustoming the modern\r\n      Greeks, like the legionaries of old, to the constant and easy use\r\n      of this salutary weight, their armor was laid aside in light\r\n      chariots, which followed the march, till, on the approach of an\r\n      enemy, they resumed with haste and reluctance the unusual\r\n      encumbrance. Their offensive weapons consisted of swords,\r\n      battle-axes, and spears; but the Macedonian pike was shortened a\r\n      fourth of its length, and reduced to the more convenient measure\r\n      of twelve cubits or feet. The sharpness of the Scythian and\r\n      Arabian arrows had been severely felt; and the emperors lament\r\n      the decay of archery as a cause of the public misfortunes, and\r\n      recommend, as an advice and a command, that the military youth,\r\n      till the age of forty, should assiduously practise the exercise\r\n      of the bow. 78 The bands, or regiments, were usually three\r\n      hundred strong; and, as a medium between the extremes of four and\r\n      sixteen, the foot soldiers of Leo and Constantine were formed\r\n      eight deep; but the cavalry charged in four ranks, from the\r\n      reasonable consideration, that the weight of the front could not\r\n      be increased by any pressure of the hindmost horses. If the ranks\r\n      of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled, this cautious\r\n      array betrayed a secret distrust of the courage of the troops,\r\n      whose numbers might swell the appearance of the line, but of whom\r\n      only a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords\r\n      of the Barbarians. The order of battle must have varied according\r\n      to the ground, the object, and the adversary; but their ordinary\r\n      disposition, in two lines and a reserve, presented a succession\r\n      of hopes and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as\r\n      the judgment of the Greeks. 79 In case of a repulse, the first\r\n      line fell back into the intervals of the second; and the reserve,\r\n      breaking into two divisions, wheeled round the flanks to improve\r\n      the victory or cover the retreat. Whatever authority could enact\r\n      was accomplished, at least in theory, by the camps and marches,\r\n      the exercises and evolutions, the edicts and books, of the\r\n      Byzantine monarch. 80 Whatever art could produce from the forge,\r\n      the loom, or the laboratory, was abundantly supplied by the\r\n      riches of the prince, and the industry of his numerous workmen.\r\n      But neither authority nor art could frame the most important\r\n      machine, the soldier himself; and if the ceremonies of\r\n      Constantine always suppose the safe and triumphal return of the\r\n      emperor, 81 his tactics seldom soar above the means of escaping a\r\n      defeat, and procrastinating the war. 82 Notwithstanding some\r\n      transient success, the Greeks were sunk in their own esteem and\r\n      that of their neighbors. A cold hand and a loquacious tongue was\r\n      the vulgar description of the nation: the author of the tactics\r\n      was besieged in his capital; and the last of the Barbarians, who\r\n      trembled at the name of the Saracens, or Franks, could proudly\r\n      exhibit the medals of gold and silver which they had extorted\r\n      from the feeble sovereign of Constantinople. What spirit their\r\n      government and character denied, might have been inspired in some\r\n      degree by the influence of religion; but the religion of the\r\n      Greeks could only teach them to suffer and to yield. The emperor\r\n      Nicephorus, who restored for a moment the discipline and glory of\r\n      the Roman name, was desirous of bestowing the honors of martyrdom\r\n      on the Christians who lost their lives in a holy war against the\r\n      infidels. But this political law was defeated by the opposition\r\n      of the patriarch, the bishops, and the principal senators; and\r\n      they strenuously urged the canons of St. Basil, that all who were\r\n      polluted by the bloody trade of a soldier should be separated,\r\n      during three years, from the communion of the faithful. 83\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ See the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters, and, in\r\n      the Tactics of Leo, with the corresponding passages in those of\r\n      Constantine.]\r\n\r\n      78 (return) [ (Leo, Tactic. p. 581 Constantin. p 1216.)

Yet\r\n      their martial creed still represented the Deity as the author of\r\n      war: 85 the vital though latent spark of fanaticism still glowed\r\n      in the heart of their religion, and among the Saracens, who dwelt\r\n      on the Christian borders, it was frequently rekindled to a lively\r\n      and active flame. Their regular force was formed of the valiant\r\n      slaves who had been educated to guard the person and accompany\r\n      the standard of their lord: but the Mussulman people of Syria and\r\n      Cilicia, of Africa and Spain, was awakened by the trumpet which\r\n      proclaimed a holy war against the infidels. The rich were\r\n      ambitious of death or victory in the cause of God; the poor were\r\n      allured by the hopes of plunder; and the old, the infirm, and the\r\n      women, assumed their share of meritorious service by sending\r\n      their substitutes, with arms and horses, into the field. These\r\n      offensive and defensive arms were similar in strength and temper\r\n      to those of the Romans, whom they far excelled in the management\r\n      of the horse and the bow: the massy silver of their belts, their\r\n      bridles, and their swords, displayed the magnificence of a\r\n      prosperous nation; and except some black archers of the South,\r\n      the Arabs disdained the naked bravery of their ancestors. Instead\r\n      of wagons, they were attended by a long train of camels, mules,\r\n      and asses: the multitude of these animals, whom they bedecked\r\n      with flags and streamers, appeared to swell the pomp and\r\n      magnitude of their host; and the horses of the enemy were often\r\n      disordered by the uncouth figure and odious smell of the camels\r\n      of the East. Invincible by their patience of thirst and heat,\r\n      their spirits were frozen by a winter’s cold, and the\r\n      consciousness of their propensity to sleep exacted the most\r\n      rigorous precautions against the surprises of the night. Their\r\n      order of battle was a long square of two deep and solid lines;\r\n      the first of archers, the second of cavalry. In their engagements\r\n      by sea and land, they sustained with patient firmness the fury of\r\n      the attack, and seldom advanced to the charge till they could\r\n      discern and oppress the lassitude of their foes. But if they were\r\n      repulsed and broken, they knew not how to rally or renew the\r\n      combat; and their dismay was heightened by the superstitious\r\n      prejudice, that God had declared himself on the side of their\r\n      enemies. The decline and fall of the caliphs countenanced this\r\n      fearful opinion; nor were there wanting, among the Mahometans and\r\n      Christians, some obscure prophecies 86 which prognosticated their\r\n      alternate defeats. The unity of the Arabian empire was dissolved,\r\n      but the independent fragments were equal to populous and powerful\r\n      kingdoms; and in their naval and military armaments, an emir of\r\n      Aleppo or Tunis might command no despicable fund of skill, and\r\n      industry, and treasure. In their transactions of peace and war\r\n      with the Saracens, the princes of Constantinople too often felt\r\n      that these Barbarians had nothing barbarous in their discipline;\r\n      and that if they were destitute of original genius, they had been\r\n      endowed with a quick spirit of curiosity and imitation. The model\r\n      was indeed more perfect than the copy; their ships, and engines,\r\n      and fortifications, were of a less skilful construction; and they\r\n      confess, without shame, that the same God who has given a tongue\r\n      to the Arabians, had more nicely fashioned the hands of the\r\n      Chinese, and the heads of the Greeks. 87\r\n\r\n      84 (return) [ The xviith chapter of the tactics of the different\r\n      nations is the most historical and useful of the whole collection\r\n      of Leo.

The vast body had\r\n      been inspired and united by the soul of Charlemagne; but the\r\n      division and degeneracy of his race soon annihilated the Imperial\r\n      power, which would have rivalled the Caesars of Byzantium, and\r\n      revenged the indignities of the Christian name. The enemies no\r\n      longer feared, nor could the subjects any longer trust, the\r\n      application of a public revenue, the labors of trade and\r\n      manufactures in the military service, the mutual aid of provinces\r\n      and armies, and the naval squadrons which were regularly\r\n      stationed from the mouth of the Elbe to that of the Tyber. In the\r\n      beginning of the tenth century, the family of Charlemagne had\r\n      almost disappeared; his monarchy was broken into many hostile and\r\n      independent states; the regal title was assumed by the most\r\n      ambitious chiefs; their revolt was imitated in a long\r\n      subordination of anarchy and discord, and the nobles of every\r\n      province disobeyed their sovereign, oppressed their vassals, and\r\n      exercised perpetual hostilities against their equals and\r\n      neighbors. Their private wars, which overturned the fabric of\r\n      government, fomented the martial spirit of the nation. In the\r\n      system of modern Europe, the power of the sword is possessed, at\r\n      least in fact, by five or six mighty potentates; their operations\r\n      are conducted on a distant frontier, by an order of men who\r\n      devote their lives to the study and practice of the military art:\r\n      the rest of the country and community enjoys in the midst of war\r\n      the tranquillity of peace, and is only made sensible of the\r\n      change by the aggravation or decrease of the public taxes. In the\r\n      disorders of the tenth and eleventh centuries, every peasant was\r\n      a soldier, and every village a fortification; each wood or valley\r\n      was a scene of murder and rapine; and the lords of each castle\r\n      were compelled to assume the character of princes and warriors.\r\n      To their own courage and policy they boldly trusted for the\r\n      safety of their family, the protection of their lands, and the\r\n      revenge of their injuries; and, like the conquerors of a larger\r\n      size, they were too apt to transgress the privilege of defensive\r\n      war. The powers of the mind and body were hardened by the\r\n      presence of danger and necessity of resolution: the same spirit\r\n      refused to desert a friend and to forgive an enemy; and, instead\r\n      of sleeping under the guardian care of a magistrate, they proudly\r\n      disdained the authority of the laws. In the days of feudal\r\n      anarchy, the instruments of agriculture and art were converted\r\n      into the weapons of bloodshed: the peaceful occupations of civil\r\n      and ecclesiastical society were abolished or corrupted; and the\r\n      bishop who exchanged his mitre for a helmet, was more forcibly\r\n      urged by the manners of the times than by the obligation of his\r\n      tenure. 89\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ Ex Francis, quo nomine tam Latinos quam Teutones\r\n      comprehendit, ludum habuit, (Liutprand in Legat ad Imp.\r\n      Nicephorum, p. 483, 484.)

A general law of Charlemagne exempted\r\n      the bishops from personal service; but the opposite practice,\r\n      which prevailed from the ixth to the xvth century, is\r\n      countenanced by the example or silence of saints and doctors....\r\n      You justify your cowardice by the holy canons, says Ratherius of\r\n      Verona; the canons likewise forbid you to whore, and yet—]\r\n\r\n      The love of freedom and of arms was felt, with conscious pride,\r\n      by the Franks themselves, and is observed by the Greeks with some\r\n      degree of amazement and terror. “The Franks,” says the emperor\r\n      Constantine, “are bold and valiant to the verge of temerity; and\r\n      their dauntless spirit is supported by the contempt of danger and\r\n      death. In the field and in close onset, they press to the front,\r\n      and rush headlong against the enemy, without deigning to compute\r\n      either his numbers or their own. Their ranks are formed by the\r\n      firm connections of consanguinity and friendship; and their\r\n      martial deeds are prompted by the desire of saving or revenging\r\n      their dearest companions. In their eyes, a retreat is a shameful\r\n      flight; and flight is indelible infamy.” 90 A nation endowed with\r\n      such high and intrepid spirit, must have been secure of victory\r\n      if these advantages had not been counter-balanced by many weighty\r\n      defects. The decay of their naval power left the Greeks and\r\n      Saracens in possession of the sea, for every purpose of annoyance\r\n      and supply. In the age which preceded the institution of\r\n      knighthood, the Franks were rude and unskilful in the service of\r\n      cavalry; 91 and in all perilous emergencies, their warriors were\r\n      so conscious of their ignorance, that they chose to dismount from\r\n      their horses and fight on foot. Unpractised in the use of pikes,\r\n      or of missile weapons, they were encumbered by the length of\r\n      their swords, the weight of their armor, the magnitude of their\r\n      shields, and, if I may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks, by\r\n      their unwieldy intemperance. Their independent spirit disdained\r\n      the yoke of subordination, and abandoned the standard of their\r\n      chief, if he attempted to keep the field beyond the term of their\r\n      stipulation or service. On all sides they were open to the snares\r\n      of an enemy less brave but more artful than themselves. They\r\n      might be bribed, for the Barbarians were venal; or surprised in\r\n      the night, for they neglected the precautions of a close\r\n      encampment or vigilant sentinels. The fatigues of a summer’s\r\n      campaign exhausted their strength and patience, and they sunk in\r\n      despair if their voracious appetite was disappointed of a\r\n      plentiful supply of wine and of food. This general character of\r\n      the Franks was marked with some national and local shades, which\r\n      I should ascribe to accident rather than to climate, but which\r\n      were visible both to natives and to foreigners. An ambassador of\r\n      the great Otho declared, in the palace of Constantinople, that\r\n      the Saxons could dispute with swords better than with pens, and\r\n      that they preferred inevitable death to the dishonor of turning\r\n      their backs to an enemy. 92 It was the glory of the nobles of\r\n      France, that, in their humble dwellings, war and rapine were the\r\n      only pleasure, the sole occupation, of their lives. They affected\r\n      to deride the palaces, the banquets, the polished manner of the\r\n      Italians, who in the estimate of the Greeks themselves had\r\n      degenerated from the liberty and valor of the ancient Lombards.\r\n      93\r\n\r\n      90 (return) [ In the xviiith chapter of his Tactics, the emperor\r\n      Leo has fairly stated the military vices and virtues of the\r\n      Franks (whom Meursius ridiculously translates by Galli) and the\r\n      Lombards or Langobards.

In the\r\n      division of the East and West, an ideal unity was scrupulously\r\n      observed, and in their titles, laws, and statutes, the successors\r\n      of Arcadius and Honorius announced themselves as the inseparable\r\n      colleagues of the same office, as the joint sovereigns of the\r\n      Roman world and city, which were bounded by the same limits.\r\n      After the fall of the Western monarchy, the majesty of the purple\r\n      resided solely in the princes of Constantinople; and of these,\r\n      Justinian was the first who, after a divorce of sixty years,\r\n      regained the dominion of ancient Rome, and asserted, by the right\r\n      of conquest, the august title of Emperor of the Romans. 94 A\r\n      motive of vanity or discontent solicited one of his successors,\r\n      Constans the Second, to abandon the Thracian Bosphorus, and to\r\n      restore the pristine honors of the Tyber: an extravagant project,\r\n      (exclaims the malicious Byzantine,) as if he had despoiled a\r\n      beautiful and blooming virgin, to enrich, or rather to expose,\r\n      the deformity of a wrinkled and decrepit matron. 95 But the sword\r\n      of the Lombards opposed his settlement in Italy: he entered Rome\r\n      not as a conqueror, but as a fugitive, and, after a visit of\r\n      twelve days, he pillaged, and forever deserted, the ancient\r\n      capital of the world. 96 The final revolt and separation of Italy\r\n      was accomplished about two centuries after the conquests of\r\n      Justinian, and from his reign we may date the gradual oblivion of\r\n      the Latin tongue. That legislator had composed his Institutes,\r\n      his Code, and his Pandects, in a language which he celebrates as\r\n      the proper and public style of the Roman government, the\r\n      consecrated idiom of the palace and senate of Constantinople, of\r\n      the campus and tribunals of the East. 97 But this foreign dialect\r\n      was unknown to the people and soldiers of the Asiatic provinces,\r\n      it was imperfectly understood by the greater part of the\r\n      interpreters of the laws and the ministers of the state. After a\r\n      short conflict, nature and habit prevailed over the obsolete\r\n      institutions of human power: for the general benefit of his\r\n      subjects, Justinian promulgated his novels in the two languages:\r\n      the several parts of his voluminous jurisprudence were\r\n      successively translated; 98 the original was forgotten, the\r\n      version was studied, and the Greek, whose intrinsic merit\r\n      deserved indeed the preference, obtained a legal, as well as\r\n      popular establishment in the Byzantine monarchy. The birth and\r\n      residence of succeeding princes estranged them from the Roman\r\n      idiom: Tiberius by the Arabs, 99 and Maurice by the Italians, 100\r\n      are distinguished as the first of the Greek Caesars, as the\r\n      founders of a new dynasty and empire: the silent revolution was\r\n      accomplished before the death of Heraclius; and the ruins of the\r\n      Latin speech were darkly preserved in the terms of jurisprudence\r\n      and the acclamations of the palace. After the restoration of the\r\n      Western empire by Charlemagne and the Othos, the names of Franks\r\n      and Latins acquired an equal signification and extent; and these\r\n      haughty Barbarians asserted, with some justice, their superior\r\n      claim to the language and dominion of Rome. They insulted the\r\n      alien of the East who had renounced the dress and idiom of\r\n      Romans; and their reasonable practice will justify the frequent\r\n      appellation of Greeks. 101 But this contemptuous appellation was\r\n      indignantly rejected by the prince and people to whom it was\r\n      applied. Whatsoever changes had been introduced by the lapse of\r\n      ages, they alleged a lineal and unbroken succession from Augustus\r\n      and Constantine; and, in the lowest period of degeneracy and\r\n      decay, the name of Romans adhered to the last fragments of the\r\n      empire of Constantinople. 102\r\n\r\n      94 (return) [ Justinian, says the historian Agathias, (l. v. p.\r\n      157,).

Most strange and incredible!]\r\n\r\n      105 (return) [ The words of Zonaras, and of Cedrenus, are strong\r\n      words, perhaps not ill suited to those reigns.]\r\n\r\n      In the ninth century we trace the first dawnings of the\r\n      restoration of science. 106 After the fanaticism of the Arabs had\r\n      subsided, the caliphs aspired to conquer the arts, rather than\r\n      the provinces, of the empire: their liberal curiosity rekindled\r\n      the emulation of the Greeks, brushed away the dust from their\r\n      ancient libraries, and taught them to know and reward the\r\n      philosophers, whose labors had been hitherto repaid by the\r\n      pleasure of study and the pursuit of truth. The Caesar Bardas,\r\n      the uncle of Michael the Third, was the generous protector of\r\n      letters, a title which alone has preserved his memory and excused\r\n      his ambition. A particle of the treasures of his nephew was\r\n      sometimes diverted from the indulgence of vice and folly; a\r\n      school was opened in the palace of Magnaura; and the presence of\r\n      Bardas excited the emulation of the masters and students. At\r\n      their head was the philosopher Leo, archbishop of Thessalonica:\r\n      his profound skill in astronomy and the mathematics was admired\r\n      by the strangers of the East; and this occult science was\r\n      magnified by vulgar credulity, which modestly supposes that all\r\n      knowledge superior to its own must be the effect of inspiration\r\n      or magic. At the pressing entreaty of the Caesar, his friend, the\r\n      celebrated Photius, 107 renounced the freedom of a secular and\r\n      studious life, ascended the patriarchal throne, and was\r\n      alternately excommunicated and absolved by the synods of the East\r\n      and West. By the confession even of priestly hatred, no art or\r\n      science, except poetry, was foreign to this universal scholar,\r\n      who was deep in thought, indefatigable in reading, and eloquent\r\n      in diction. Whilst he exercised the office of protospathaire or\r\n      captain of the guards, Photius was sent ambassador to the caliph\r\n      of Bagdad. 108 The tedious hours of exile, perhaps of\r\n      confinement, were beguiled by the hasty composition of his\r\n      Library, a living monument of erudition and criticism. Two\r\n      hundred and fourscore writers, historians, orators, philosophers,\r\n      theologians, are reviewed without any regular method: he abridges\r\n      their narrative or doctrine, appreciates their style and\r\n      character, and judges even the fathers of the church with a\r\n      discreet freedom, which often breaks through the superstition of\r\n      the times. The emperor Basil, who lamented the defects of his own\r\n      education, intrusted to the care of Photius his son and\r\n      successor, Leo the philosopher; and the reign of that prince and\r\n      of his son Constantine Porphyrogenitus forms one of the most\r\n      prosperous aeras of the Byzantine literature. By their\r\n      munificence the treasures of antiquity were deposited in the\r\n      Imperial library; by their pens, or those of their associates,\r\n      they were imparted in such extracts and abridgments as might\r\n      amuse the curiosity, without oppressing the indolence, of the\r\n      public. Besides the Basilics, or code of laws, the arts of\r\n      husbandry and war, of feeding or destroying the human species,\r\n      were propagated with equal diligence; and the history of Greece\r\n      and Rome was digested into fifty-three heads or titles, of which\r\n      two only (of embassies, and of virtues and vices) have escaped\r\n      the injuries of time. In every station, the reader might\r\n      contemplate the image of the past world, apply the lesson or\r\n      warning of each page, and learn to admire, perhaps to imitate,\r\n      the examples of a brighter period. I shall not expatiate on the\r\n      works of the Byzantine Greeks, who, by the assiduous study of the\r\n      ancients, have deserved, in some measure, the remembrance and\r\n      gratitude of the moderns. The scholars of the present age may\r\n      still enjoy the benefit of the philosophical commonplace book of\r\n      Stobaeus, the grammatical and historical lexicon of Suidas, the\r\n      Chiliads of Tzetzes, which comprise six hundred narratives in\r\n      twelve thousand verses, and the commentaries on Homer of\r\n      Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica, who, from his horn of\r\n      plenty, has poured the names and authorities of four hundred\r\n      writers. From these originals, and from the numerous tribe of\r\n      scholiasts and critics, 109 some estimate may be formed of the\r\n      literary wealth of the twelfth century: Constantinople was\r\n      enlightened by the genius of Homer and Demosthenes, of Aristotle\r\n      and Plato: and in the enjoyment or neglect of our present riches,\r\n      we must envy the generation that could still peruse the history\r\n      of Theopompus, the orations of Hyperides, the comedies of\r\n      Menander, 110 and the odes of Alcaeus and Sappho. The frequent\r\n      labor of illustration attests not only the existence, but the\r\n      popularity, of the Grecian classics: the general knowledge of the\r\n      age may be deduced from the example of two learned females, the\r\n      empress Eudocia, and the princess Anna Comnena, who cultivated,\r\n      in the purple, the arts of rhetoric and philosophy. 111 The\r\n      vulgar dialect of the city was gross and barbarous: a more\r\n      correct and elaborate style distinguished the discourse, or at\r\n      least the compositions, of the church and palace, which sometimes\r\n      affected to copy the purity of the Attic models.\r\n\r\n      106 (return) [ See Zonaras (l. xvi. p. 160, 161) and Cedrenus,\r\n      (p. 549, 550.)

The poets and\r\n      orators were long imprisoned in the barbarous dialects of our\r\n      Western ancestors, devoid of harmony or grace; and their genius,\r\n      without precept or example, was abandoned to the rule and native\r\n      powers of their judgment and fancy. But the Greeks of\r\n      Constantinople, after purging away the impurities of their vulgar\r\n      speech, acquired the free use of their ancient language, the most\r\n      happy composition of human art, and a familiar knowledge of the\r\n      sublime masters who had pleased or instructed the first of\r\n      nations. But these advantages only tend to aggravate the reproach\r\n      and shame of a degenerate people. They held in their lifeless\r\n      hands the riches of their fathers, without inheriting the spirit\r\n      which had created and improved that sacred patrimony: they read,\r\n      they praised, they compiled, but their languid souls seemed alike\r\n      incapable of thought and action. In the revolution of ten\r\n      centuries, not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity\r\n      or promote the happiness of mankind. Not a single idea has been\r\n      added to the speculative systems of antiquity, and a succession\r\n      of patient disciples became in their turn the dogmatic teachers\r\n      of the next servile generation. Not a single composition of\r\n      history, philosophy, or literature, has been saved from oblivion\r\n      by the intrinsic beauties of style or sentiment, of original\r\n      fancy, or even of successful imitation. In prose, the least\r\n      offensive of the Byzantine writers are absolved from censure by\r\n      their naked and unpresuming simplicity: but the orators, most\r\n      eloquent 112 in their own conceit, are the farthest removed from\r\n      the models whom they affect to emulate. In every page our taste\r\n      and reason are wounded by the choice of gigantic and obsolete\r\n      words, a stiff and intricate phraseology, the discord of images,\r\n      the childish play of false or unseasonable ornament, and the\r\n      painful attempt to elevate themselves, to astonish the reader,\r\n      and to involve a trivial meaning in the smoke of obscurity and\r\n      exaggeration. Their prose is soaring to the vicious affectation\r\n      of poetry: their poetry is sinking below the flatness and\r\n      insipidity of prose. The tragic, epic, and lyric muses, were\r\n      silent and inglorious: the bards of Constantinople seldom rose\r\n      above a riddle or epigram, a panegyric or tale; they forgot even\r\n      the rules of prosody; and with the melody of Homer yet sounding\r\n      in their ears, they confound all measure of feet and syllables in\r\n      the impotent strains which have received the name of political or\r\n      city verses. 113 The minds of the Greek were bound in the fetters\r\n      of a base and imperious superstition which extends her dominion\r\n      round the circle of profane science. Their understandings were\r\n      bewildered in metaphysical controversy: in the belief of visions\r\n      and miracles, they had lost all principles of moral evidence, and\r\n      their taste was vitiated by the homilies of the monks, an absurd\r\n      medley of declamation and Scripture. Even these contemptible\r\n      studies were no longer dignified by the abuse of superior\r\n      talents: the leaders of the Greek church were humbly content to\r\n      admire and copy the oracles of antiquity, nor did the schools of\r\n      pulpit produce any rivals of the fame of Athanasius and\r\n      Chrysostom. 114\r\n\r\n      112 (return) [ To censure the Byzantine taste.

The cities of ancient Greece\r\n      were cast in the happy mixture of union and independence, which\r\n      is repeated on a larger scale, but in a looser form, by the\r\n      nations of modern Europe; the union of language, religion, and\r\n      manners, which renders them the spectators and judges of each\r\n      other’s merit; 115 the independence of government and interest,\r\n      which asserts their separate freedom, and excites them to strive\r\n      for preeminence in the career of glory. The situation of the\r\n      Romans was less favorable; yet in the early ages of the republic,\r\n      which fixed the national character, a similar emulation was\r\n      kindled among the states of Latium and Italy; and in the arts and\r\n      sciences, they aspired to equal or surpass their Grecian masters.\r\n      The empire of the Caesars undoubtedly checked the activity and\r\n      progress of the human mind; its magnitude might indeed allow some\r\n      scope for domestic competition; but when it was gradually\r\n      reduced, at first to the East and at last to Greece and\r\n      Constantinople, the Byzantine subjects were degraded to an abject\r\n      and languid temper, the natural effect of their solitary and\r\n      insulated state. From the North they were oppressed by nameless\r\n      tribes of Barbarians, to whom they scarcely imparted the\r\n      appellation of men. The language and religion of the more\r\n      polished Arabs were an insurmountable bar to all social\r\n      intercourse. The conquerors of Europe were their brethren in the\r\n      Christian faith; but the speech of the Franks or Latins was\r\n      unknown, their manners were rude, and they were rarely connected,\r\n      in peace or war, with the successors of Heraclius. Alone in the\r\n      universe, the self-satisfied pride of the Greeks was not\r\n      disturbed by the comparison of foreign merit; and it is no wonder\r\n      if they fainted in the race, since they had neither competitors\r\n      to urge their speed, nor judges to crown their victory. The\r\n      nations of Europe and Asia were mingled by the expeditions to the\r\n      Holy Land; and it is under the Comnenian dynasty that a faint\r\n      emulation of knowledge and military virtue was rekindled in the\r\n      Byzantine empire.\r\n\r\n      115 (return) [Hume’s Essays, vol. i. p. 125]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.—Part I.\r\n\r\n     Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.—Their Persecution By The\r\n     Greek Emperors.—Revolt In Armenia &c.—Transplantation Into\r\n     Thrace.—Propagation In The West.—The Seeds, Character, And\r\n     Consequences Of The Reformation.\r\n\r\n      In the profession of Christianity, the variety of national\r\n      characters may be clearly distinguished. The natives of Syria and\r\n      Egypt abandoned their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion:\r\n      Rome again aspired to the dominion of the world; and the wit of\r\n      the lively and loquacious Greeks was consumed in the disputes of\r\n      metaphysical theology. The incomprehensible mysteries of the\r\n      Trinity and Incarnation, instead of commanding their silent\r\n      submission, were agitated in vehement and subtile controversies,\r\n      which enlarged their faith at the expense, perhaps, of their\r\n      charity and reason. From the council of Nice to the end of the\r\n      seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was invaded by\r\n      these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the decline\r\n      and fall of the empire, that the historian has too often been\r\n      compelled to attend the synods, to explore the creeds, and to\r\n      enumerate the sects, of this busy period of ecclesiastical\r\n      annals. From the beginning of the eighth century to the last ages\r\n      of the Byzantine empire, the sound of controversy was seldom\r\n      heard: curiosity was exhausted, zeal was fatigued, and, in the\r\n      decrees of six councils, the articles of the Catholic faith had\r\n      been irrevocably defined. The spirit of dispute, however vain and\r\n      pernicious, requires some energy and exercise of the mental\r\n      faculties; and the prostrate Greeks were content to fast, to\r\n      pray, and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his\r\n      clergy. During a long dream of superstition, the Virgin and the\r\n      Saints, their visions and miracles, their relics and images, were\r\n      preached by the monks, and worshipped by the people; and the\r\n      appellation of people might be extended, without injustice, to\r\n      the first ranks of civil society. At an unseasonable moment, the\r\n      Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their\r\n      subjects: under their influence reason might obtain some\r\n      proselytes, a far greater number was swayed by interest or fear;\r\n      but the Eastern world embraced or deplored their visible deities,\r\n      and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of\r\n      orthodoxy. In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical\r\n      rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the pleasure,\r\n      of persecution. The Pagans had disappeared; the Jews were silent\r\n      and obscure; the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote\r\n      hostilities against a national enemy; and the sects of Egypt and\r\n      Syria enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian\r\n      caliphs. About the middle of the seventh century, a branch of\r\n      Manichaeans was selected as the victims of spiritual tyranny;\r\n      their patience was at length exasperated to despair and\r\n      rebellion; and their exile has scattered over the West the seeds\r\n      of reformation. These important events will justify some inquiry\r\n      into the doctrine and story of the Paulicians; 1 and, as they\r\n      cannot plead for themselves, our candid criticism will magnify\r\n      the good, and abate or suspect the evil, that is reported by\r\n      their adversaries.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ The errors and virtues of the Paulicians are\r\n      weighed, with his usual judgment and candor, by the learned\r\n      Mosheim, (Hist.

Instead of emulating\r\n      or surpassing the wealth, learning, and numbers of the Catholics,\r\n      their obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East\r\n      and West, and confined to the villages and mountains along the\r\n      borders of the Euphrates. Some vestige of the Marcionites may be\r\n      detected in the fifth century; 2 but the numerous sects were\r\n      finally lost in the odious name of the Manichaeans; and these\r\n      heretics, who presumed to reconcile the doctrines of Zoroaster\r\n      and Christ, were pursued by the two religions with equal and\r\n      unrelenting hatred. Under the grandson of Heraclius, in the\r\n      neighborhood of Samosata, more famous for the birth of Lucian\r\n      than for the title of a Syrian kingdom, a reformer arose,\r\n      esteemed by the Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth. In\r\n      his humble dwelling of Mananalis, Constantine entertained a\r\n      deacon, who returned from Syrian captivity, and received the\r\n      inestimable gift of the New Testament, which was already\r\n      concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek, and\r\n      perhaps of the Gnostic, clergy. 3 These books became the measure\r\n      of his studies and the rule of his faith; and the Catholics, who\r\n      dispute his interpretation, acknowledge that his text was genuine\r\n      and sincere. But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to\r\n      the writings and character of St. Paul: the name of the\r\n      Paulicians is derived by their enemies from some unknown and\r\n      domestic teacher; but I am confident that they gloried in their\r\n      affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles. His disciples, Titus,\r\n      Timothy, Sylvanus, Tychicus, were represented by Constantine and\r\n      his fellow-laborers: the names of the apostolic churches were\r\n      applied to the congregations which they assembled in Armenia and\r\n      Cappadocia; and this innocent allegory revived the example and\r\n      memory of the first ages. In the Gospel, and the Epistles of St.\r\n      Paul, his faithful follower investigated the Creed of primitive\r\n      Christianity; and, whatever might be the success, a Protestant\r\n      reader will applaud the spirit, of the inquiry. But if the\r\n      Scriptures of the Paulicians were pure, they were not perfect.\r\n      Their founders rejected the two Epistles of St. Peter, 4 the\r\n      apostle of the circumcision, whose dispute with their favorite\r\n      for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven. 5\r\n      They agreed with their Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt\r\n      for the Old Testament, the books of Moses and the prophets, which\r\n      have been consecrated by the decrees of the Catholic church. With\r\n      equal boldness, and doubtless with more reason, Constantine, the\r\n      new Sylvanus, disclaimed the visions, which, in so many bulky and\r\n      splendid volumes, had been published by the Oriental sects; 6 the\r\n      fabulous productions of the Hebrew patriarchs and the sages of\r\n      the East; the spurious gospels, epistles, and acts, which in the\r\n      first age had overwhelmed the orthodox code; the theology of\r\n      Manes, and the authors of the kindred heresies; and the thirty\r\n      generations, or aeons, which had been created by the fruitful\r\n      fancy of Valentine. The Paulicians sincerely condemned the memory\r\n      and opinions of the Manichaean sect, and complained of the\r\n      injustice which impressed that invidious name on the simple\r\n      votaries of St. Paul and of Christ.\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ In the time of Theodoret, the diocese of Cyrrhus, in\r\n      Syria, contained eight hundred villages.

They likewise overlooked\r\n      the Apocalypse, (Petr.

Even in Africa, St. Austin\r\n      could describe the Manichaean books, tam multi, tam grandes, tam\r\n      pretiosi codices, (contra Faust. xiii. 14;) but he adds, without\r\n      pity, Incendite omnes illas membranas: and his advice had been\r\n      rigorously followed.]\r\n\r\n      Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links had been broken by the\r\n      Paulician reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they\r\n      reduced the number of masters, at whose voice profane reason must\r\n      bow to mystery and miracle. The early separation of the Gnostics\r\n      had preceded the establishment of the Catholic worship; and\r\n      against the gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they\r\n      were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion, as by the silence\r\n      of St. Paul and the evangelists. The objects which had been\r\n      transformed by the magic of superstition, appeared to the eyes of\r\n      the Paulicians in their genuine and naked colors. An image made\r\n      without hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist, to\r\n      whose skill alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their\r\n      merit or value. The miraculous relics were a heap of bones and\r\n      ashes, destitute of life or virtue, or of any relation, perhaps,\r\n      with the person to whom they were ascribed. The true and\r\n      vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber, the body\r\n      and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine, the gifts\r\n      of nature and the symbols of grace. The mother of God was\r\n      degraded from her celestial honors and immaculate virginity; and\r\n      the saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the\r\n      laborious office of mediation in heaven, and ministry upon earth.\r\n      In the practice, or at least in the theory, of the sacraments,\r\n      the Paulicians were inclined to abolish all visible objects of\r\n      worship, and the words of the gospel were, in their judgment, the\r\n      baptism and communion of the faithful. They indulged a convenient\r\n      latitude for the interpretation of Scripture: and as often as\r\n      they were pressed by the literal sense, they could escape to the\r\n      intricate mazes of figure and allegory. Their utmost diligence\r\n      must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the\r\n      Old and the New Testament; since they adored the latter as the\r\n      oracles of God, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and\r\n      absurd invention of men or daemons. We cannot be surprised, that\r\n      they should have found in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the\r\n      Trinity: but, instead of confessing the human nature and\r\n      substantial sufferings of Christ, they amused their fancy with a\r\n      celestial body that passed through the virgin like water through\r\n      a pipe; with a fantastic crucifixion, that eluded the vain and\r\n      important malice of the Jews. A creed thus simple and spiritual\r\n      was not adapted to the genius of the times; 7 and the rational\r\n      Christian, who might have been contented with the light yoke and\r\n      easy burden of Jesus and his apostles, was justly offended, that\r\n      the Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God, the first\r\n      article of natural and revealed religion. Their belief and their\r\n      trust was in the Father, of Christ, of the human soul, and of the\r\n      invisible world.\r\n\r\n      But they likewise held the eternity of matter; a stubborn and\r\n      rebellious substance, the origin of a second principle of an\r\n      active being, who has created this visible world, and exercises\r\n      his temporal reign till the final consummation of death and sin.\r\n      8 The appearances of moral and physical evil had established the\r\n      two principles in the ancient philosophy and religion of the\r\n      East; from whence this doctrine was transfused to the various\r\n      swarms of the Gnostics. A thousand shades may be devised in the\r\n      nature and character of Ahriman, from a rival god to a\r\n      subordinate daemon, from passion and frailty to pure and perfect\r\n      malevolence: but, in spite of our efforts, the goodness, and the\r\n      power, of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the\r\n      line; and every step that approaches the one must recede in equal\r\n      proportion from the other. 9\r\n\r\n      7 (return) [ The six capital errors of the Paulicians are defined\r\n      by Peter (p. 756,) with much prejudice and passion.]\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ Primum illorum axioma est, duo rerum esse principia;\r\n      Deum malum et Deum bonum, aliumque hujus mundi conditorem et\r\n      princi pem, et alium futuri aevi, (Petr.

Hist.\r\n      Eccles. and de Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum, sec. i. ii.\r\n      iii.,) have labored to explore and discriminate the various\r\n      systems of the Gnostics on the subject of the two principles.]\r\n\r\n      The apostolic labors of Constantine Sylvanus soon multiplied the\r\n      number of his disciples, the secret recompense of spiritual\r\n      ambition. The remnant of the Gnostic sects, and especially the\r\n      Manichaeans of Armenia, were united under his standard; many\r\n      Catholics were converted or seduced by his arguments; and he\r\n      preached with success in the regions of Pontus 10 and Cappadocia,\r\n      which had long since imbibed the religion of Zoroaster. The\r\n      Paulician teachers were distinguished only by their Scriptural\r\n      names, by the modest title of Fellow-pilgrims, by the austerity\r\n      of their lives, their zeal or knowledge, and the credit of some\r\n      extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit. But they were incapable\r\n      of desiring, or at least of obtaining, the wealth and honors of\r\n      the Catholic prelacy; such anti-Christian pride they bitterly\r\n      censured; and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned\r\n      as an institution of the Jewish synagogue. The new sect was\r\n      loosely spread over the provinces of Asia Minor to the westward\r\n      of the Euphrates; six of their principal congregations\r\n      represented the churches to which St. Paul had addressed his\r\n      epistles; and their founder chose his residence in the\r\n      neighborhood of Colonia, 11 in the same district of Pontus which\r\n      had been celebrated by the altars of Bellona 12 and the miracles\r\n      of Gregory. 13 After a mission of twenty-seven years, Sylvanus,\r\n      who had retired from the tolerating government of the Arabs, fell\r\n      a sacrifice to Roman persecution. The laws of the pious emperors,\r\n      which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics,\r\n      proscribed without mercy or disguise the tenets, the books, and\r\n      the persons of the Montanists and Manichaeans: the books were\r\n      delivered to the flames; and all who should presume to secrete\r\n      such writings, or to profess such opinions, were devoted to an\r\n      ignominious death. 14 A Greek minister, armed with legal and\r\n      military powers, appeared at Colonia to strike the shepherd, and\r\n      to reclaim, if possible, the lost sheep. By a refinement of\r\n      cruelty, Simeon placed the unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of\r\n      his disciples, who were commanded, as the price of their pardon\r\n      and the proof of their repentance, to massacre their spiritual\r\n      father. They turned aside from the impious office; the stones\r\n      dropped from their filial hands, and of the whole number, only\r\n      one executioner could be found, a new David, as he is styled by\r\n      the Catholics, who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy. This\r\n      apostate (Justin was his name) again deceived and betrayed his\r\n      unsuspecting brethren, and a new conformity to the acts of St.\r\n      Paul may be found in the conversion of Simeon: like the apostle,\r\n      he embraced the doctrine which he had been sent to persecute,\r\n      renounced his honors and fortunes, and required among the\r\n      Paulicians the fame of a missionary and a martyr. They were not\r\n      ambitious of martyrdom, 15 but in a calamitous period of one\r\n      hundred and fifty years, their patience sustained whatever zeal\r\n      could inflict; and power was insufficient to eradicate the\r\n      obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason. From the blood and\r\n      ashes of the first victims, a succession of teachers and\r\n      congregations repeatedly arose: amidst their foreign hostilities,\r\n      they found leisure for domestic quarrels: they preached, they\r\n      disputed, they suffered; and the virtues, the apparent virtues,\r\n      of Sergius, in a pilgrimage of thirty-three years, are\r\n      reluctantly confessed by the orthodox historians. 16 The native\r\n      cruelty of Justinian the Second was stimulated by a pious cause;\r\n      and he vainly hoped to extinguish, in a single conflagration, the\r\n      name and memory of the Paulicians. By their primitive simplicity,\r\n      their abhorrence of popular superstition, the Iconoclast princes\r\n      might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines; but they\r\n      themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks, and they\r\n      chose to be the tyrants, lest they should be accused as the\r\n      accomplices, of the Manichaeans. Such a reproach has sullied the\r\n      clemency of Nicephorus, who relaxed in their favor the severity\r\n      of the penal statutes, nor will his character sustain the honor\r\n      of a more liberal motive. The feeble Michael the First, the rigid\r\n      Leo the Armenian, were foremost in the race of persecution; but\r\n      the prize must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion\r\n      of Theodora, who restored the images to the Oriental church. Her\r\n      inquisitors explored the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia,\r\n      and the flatterers of the empress have affirmed that, in a short\r\n      reign, one hundred thousand Paulicians were extirpated by the\r\n      sword, the gibbet, or the flames. Her guilt or merit has perhaps\r\n      been stretched beyond the measure of truth: but if the account be\r\n      allowed, it must be presumed that many simple Iconoclasts were\r\n      punished under a more odious name; and that some who were driven\r\n      from the church, unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of heresy.\r\n\r\n      10 (return) [ The countries between the Euphrates and the Halys\r\n      were possessed above 350 years by the Medes (Herodot. l. i. c.\r\n      103) and Persians; and the kings of Pontus were of the royal race\r\n      of the Achaemenides, (Sallust.

In a holy cause\r\n      they are no longer susceptible of fear or remorse: the justice of\r\n      their arms hardens them against the feelings of humanity; and\r\n      they revenge their fathers’ wrongs on the children of their\r\n      tyrants. Such have been the Hussites of Bohemia and the\r\n      Calvinists of France, and such, in the ninth century, were the\r\n      Paulicians of Armenia and the adjacent provinces. 17 They were\r\n      first awakened to the massacre of a governor and bishop, who\r\n      exercised the Imperial mandate of converting or destroying the\r\n      heretics; and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus protected\r\n      their independence and revenge. A more dangerous and consuming\r\n      flame was kindled by the persecution of Theodora, and the revolt\r\n      of Carbeas, a valiant Paulician, who commanded the guards of the\r\n      general of the East. His father had been impaled by the Catholic\r\n      inquisitors; and religion, or at least nature, might justify his\r\n      desertion and revenge. Five thousand of his brethren were united\r\n      by the same motives; they renounced the allegiance of\r\n      anti-Christian Rome; a Saracen emir introduced Carbeas to the\r\n      caliph; and the commander of the faithful extended his sceptre to\r\n      the implacable enemy of the Greeks. In the mountains between\r\n      Siwas and Trebizond he founded or fortified the city of Tephrice,\r\n      18 which is still occupied by a fierce or licentious people, and\r\n      the neighboring hills were covered with the Paulician fugitives,\r\n      who now reconciled the use of the Bible and the sword. During\r\n      more than thirty years, Asia was afflicted by the calamities of\r\n      foreign and domestic war; in their hostile inroads, the disciples\r\n      of St. Paul were joined with those of Mahomet; and the peaceful\r\n      Christians, the aged parent and tender virgin, who were delivered\r\n      into barbarous servitude, might justly accuse the intolerant\r\n      spirit of their sovereign. So urgent was the mischief, so\r\n      intolerable the shame, that even the dissolute Michael, the son\r\n      of Theodora, was compelled to march in person against the\r\n      Paulicians: he was defeated under the walls of Samosata; and the\r\n      Roman emperor fled before the heretics whom his mother had\r\n      condemned to the flames. The Saracens fought under the same\r\n      banners, but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas; and the captive\r\n      generals, with more than a hundred tribunes, were either released\r\n      by his avarice, or tortured by his fanaticism. The valor and\r\n      ambition of Chrysocheir, 19 his successor, embraced a wider\r\n      circle of rapine and revenge. In alliance with his faithful\r\n      Moslems, he boldly penetrated into the heart of Asia; the troops\r\n      of the frontier and the palace were repeatedly overthrown; the\r\n      edicts of persecution were answered by the pillage of Nice and\r\n      Nicomedia, of Ancyra and Ephesus; nor could the apostle St. John\r\n      protect from violation his city and sepulchre. The cathedral of\r\n      Ephesus was turned into a stable for mules and horses; and the\r\n      Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their contempt and\r\n      abhorrence of images and relics. It is not unpleasing to observe\r\n      the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which had\r\n      disdained the prayers of an injured people. The emperor Basil,\r\n      the Macedonian, was reduced to sue for peace, to offer a ransom\r\n      for the captives, and to request, in the language of moderation\r\n      and charity, that Chrysocheir would spare his fellow-Christians,\r\n      and content himself with a royal donative of gold and silver and\r\n      silk garments. “If the emperor,” replied the insolent fanatic,\r\n      “be desirous of peace, let him abdicate the East, and reign\r\n      without molestation in the West. If he refuse, the servants of\r\n      the Lord will precipitate him from the throne.” The reluctant\r\n      Basil suspended the treaty, accepted the defiance, and led his\r\n      army into the land of heresy, which he wasted with fire and\r\n      sword. The open country of the Paulicians was exposed to the same\r\n      calamities which they had inflicted; but when he had explored the\r\n      strength of Tephrice, the multitude of the Barbarians, and the\r\n      ample magazines of arms and provisions, he desisted with a sigh\r\n      from the hopeless siege. On his return to Constantinople, he\r\n      labored, by the foundation of convents and churches, to secure\r\n      the aid of his celestial patrons, of Michael the archangel and\r\n      the prophet Elijah; and it was his daily prayer that he might\r\n      live to transpierce, with three arrows, the head of his impious\r\n      adversary. Beyond his expectations, the wish was accomplished:\r\n      after a successful inroad, Chrysocheir was surprised and slain in\r\n      his retreat; and the rebel’s head was triumphantly presented at\r\n      the foot of the throne. On the reception of this welcome trophy,\r\n      Basil instantly called for his bow, discharged three arrows with\r\n      unerring aim, and accepted the applause of the court, who hailed\r\n      the victory of the royal archer. With Chrysocheir, the glory of\r\n      the Paulicians faded and withered: 20 on the second expedition of\r\n      the emperor, the impregnable Tephrice, was deserted by the\r\n      heretics, who sued for mercy or escaped to the borders. The city\r\n      was ruined, but the spirit of independence survived in the\r\n      mountains: the Paulicians defended, above a century, their\r\n      religion and liberty, infested the Roman limits, and maintained\r\n      their perpetual alliance with the enemies of the empire and the\r\n      gospel.\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ Petrus Siculus, (p. 763, 764,) the continuator of\r\n      Theophanes, (l. iv. c. 4, p. 103, 104,) Cedrenus, (p. 541, 542,\r\n      545,) and Zonaras, (tom. ii. l. xvi. p. 156,) describe the revolt\r\n      and exploits of Carbeas and his Paulicians.]\r\n\r\n      18 (return) [ Otter (Voyage en Turquie et en Perse, tom. ii.) is\r\n      probably the only Frank who has visited the independent\r\n      Barbarians of Tephrice now Divrigni, from whom he fortunately\r\n      escaped in the train of a Turkish officer.]\r\n\r\n      19 (return) [ In the history of Chrysocheir, Genesius (Chron. p.\r\n      67-70, edit.

As a favor, or punishment, he transplanted them from\r\n      the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople and Thrace; and by\r\n      this emigration their doctrine was introduced and diffused in\r\n      Europe. 21 If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled\r\n      with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep\r\n      root in a foreign soil. The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the\r\n      storms of persecution, maintained a secret correspondence with\r\n      their Armenian brethren, and gave aid and comfort to their\r\n      preachers, who solicited, not without success, the infant faith\r\n      of the Bulgarians. 22 In the tenth century, they were restored\r\n      and multiplied by a more powerful colony, which John Zimisces 23\r\n      transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of Mount\r\n      Haemus. The Oriental clergy who would have preferred the\r\n      destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the\r\n      Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their\r\n      valor: their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with\r\n      mischief; but, on the side of the Danube, against the Barbarians\r\n      of Scythia, their service might be useful, and their loss would\r\n      be desirable. Their exile in a distant land was softened by a\r\n      free toleration: the Paulicians held the city of Philippopolis\r\n      and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were their subjects; the\r\n      Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a line of\r\n      villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native\r\n      Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy.\r\n      As long as they were awed by power and treated with moderation,\r\n      their voluntary bands were distinguished in the armies of the\r\n      empire; and the courage of these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever\r\n      thirsty of human blood, is noticed with astonishment, and almost\r\n      with reproach, by the pusillanimous Greeks. The same spirit\r\n      rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they were easily\r\n      provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were often\r\n      violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy.\r\n      In the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred\r\n      Manichaeans deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus, 24 and\r\n      retired to their native homes. He dissembled till the moment of\r\n      revenge; invited the chiefs to a friendly conference; and\r\n      punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment, confiscation,\r\n      and baptism. In an interval of peace, the emperor undertook the\r\n      pious office of reconciling them to the church and state: his\r\n      winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the thirteenth\r\n      apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed whole\r\n      days and nights in theological controversy. His arguments were\r\n      fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honors and rewards\r\n      which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new city,\r\n      surrounded with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified\r\n      with his own name, was founded by Alexius for the residence of\r\n      his vulgar converts. The important station of Philippopolis was\r\n      wrested from their hands; the contumacious leaders were secured\r\n      in a dungeon, or banished from their country; and their lives\r\n      were spared by the prudence, rather than the mercy, of an\r\n      emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt\r\n      alive before the church of St. Sophia. 25 But the proud hope of\r\n      eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by\r\n      the invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased to dissemble or\r\n      refused to obey. After the departure and death of Alexius, they\r\n      soon resumed their civil and religious laws. In the beginning of\r\n      the thirteenth century, their pope or primate (a manifest\r\n      corruption) resided on the confines of Bulgaria, Croatia, and\r\n      Dalmatia, and governed, by his vicars, the filial congregations\r\n      of Italy and France. 26 From that aera, a minute scrutiny might\r\n      prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition. At the end of the\r\n      last age, the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount\r\n      Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently\r\n      tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government. The\r\n      modern Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin; and their\r\n      religion is disgraced by the worship of the cross, and the\r\n      practice of bloody sacrifice, which some captives have imported\r\n      from the wilds of Tartary. 27\r\n\r\n      21 (return) [ Copronymus transported his heretics; and thus says\r\n      Cedrenus, (p. 463,) who has copied the annals of Theophanes.]\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Petrus Siculus, who resided nine months at Tephrice\r\n      (A.D. 870) for the ransom of captives, (p. 764,) was informed of\r\n      their intended mission, and addressed his preservative, the\r\n      Historia Manichaeorum to the new archbishop of the Bulgarians,\r\n      (p. 754.)]\r\n\r\n      23 (return) [ The colony of Paulicians and Jacobites transplanted\r\n      by John Zimisces (A.D. 970) from Armenia to Thrace, is mentioned\r\n      by Zonaras (tom. ii. l. xvii. p. 209) and Anna Comnena, (Alexiad,\r\n      l. xiv. p. 450, &c.)]\r\n\r\n      24 (return) [ The Alexiad of Anna Comnena (l. v. p. 131, l. vi.\r\n      p. 154, 155, l. xiv. p. 450-457, with the Annotations of Ducange)\r\n      records the transactions of her apostolic father with the\r\n      Manichaeans, whose abominable heresy she was desirous of\r\n      refuting.]\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ Basil, a monk, and the author of the Bogomiles, a\r\n      sect of Gnostics, who soon vanished, (Anna Comnena, Alexiad, l.\r\n      xv. p. 486-494 Mosheim, Hist.

The\r\n      favor and success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth\r\n      centuries must be imputed to the strong, though secret,\r\n      discontent which armed the most pious Christians against the\r\n      church of Rome. Her avarice was oppressive, her despotism odious;\r\n      less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the worship of saints\r\n      and images, her innovations were more rapid and scandalous: she\r\n      had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of\r\n      transubstantiation: the lives of the Latin clergy were more\r\n      corrupt, and the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of\r\n      the apostles, if they were compared with the lordly prelates, who\r\n      wielded by turns the crosier, the sceptre, and the sword. Three\r\n      different roads might introduce the Paulicians into the heart of\r\n      Europe. After the conversion of Hungary, the pilgrims who visited\r\n      Jerusalem might safely follow the course of the Danube: in their\r\n      journey and return they passed through Philippopolis; and the\r\n      sectaries, disguising their name and heresy, might accompany the\r\n      French or German caravans to their respective countries. The\r\n      trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the Adriatic,\r\n      and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of\r\n      every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard, the\r\n      Paulicians were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy\r\n      and Sicily: in peace and war, they freely conversed with\r\n      strangers and natives, and their opinions were silently\r\n      propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms beyond the Alps. 28\r\n      It was soon discovered, that many thousand Catholics of every\r\n      rank, and of either sex, had embraced the Manichaean heresy; and\r\n      the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the first\r\n      act and signal of persecution. The Bulgarians, 29 a name so\r\n      innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread\r\n      their branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred\r\n      of idolatry and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal\r\n      and presbyterian government; their various sects were\r\n      discriminated by some fainter or darker shades of theology; but\r\n      they generally agreed in the two principles, the contempt of the\r\n      Old Testament and the denial of the body of Christ, either on the\r\n      cross or in the eucharist. A confession of simple worship and\r\n      blameless manners is extorted from their enemies; and so high was\r\n      their standard of perfection, that the increasing congregations\r\n      were divided into two classes of disciples, of those who\r\n      practised, and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the\r\n      Albigeois, 30 in the southern provinces of France, that the\r\n      Paulicians were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes\r\n      of martyrdom and revenge which had been displayed in the\r\n      neighborhood of the Euphrates, were repeated in the thirteenth\r\n      century on the banks of the Rhone. The laws of the Eastern\r\n      emperors were revived by Frederic the Second. The insurgents of\r\n      Tephrice were represented by the barons and cities of Languedoc:\r\n      Pope Innocent III. surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora. It\r\n      was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of\r\n      the Crusades, and the cruelty of her priests was far excelled by\r\n      the founders of the Inquisition; 31 an office more adapted to\r\n      confirm, than to refute, the belief of an evil principle. The\r\n      visible assemblies of the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were\r\n      extirpated by fire and sword; and the bleeding remnant escaped by\r\n      flight, concealment, or Catholic conformity. But the invincible\r\n      spirit which they had kindled still lived and breathed in the\r\n      Western world. In the state, in the church, and even in the\r\n      cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of\r\n      St. Paul; who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the\r\n      Bible as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the\r\n      visions of the Gnostic theology. 3111 The struggles of Wickliff\r\n      in England, of Huss in Bohemia, were premature and ineffectual;\r\n      but the names of Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin, are pronounced\r\n      with gratitude as the deliverers of nations.\r\n\r\n      28 (return) [ The introduction of the Paulicians into Italy and\r\n      France is amply discussed by Muratori (Antiquitat.

After a fair\r\n      discussion, we shall rather be surprised by the timidity, than\r\n      scandalized by the freedom, of our first reformers. 32 With the\r\n      Jews, they adopted the belief and defence of all the Hebrew\r\n      Scriptures, with all their prodigies, from the garden of Eden to\r\n      the visions of the prophet Daniel; and they were bound, like the\r\n      Catholics, to justify against the Jews the abolition of a divine\r\n      law. In the great mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation the\r\n      reformers were severely orthodox: they freely adopted the\r\n      theology of the four, or the six first councils; and with the\r\n      Athanasian creed, they pronounced the eternal damnation of all\r\n      who did not believe the Catholic faith. Transubstantiation, the\r\n      invisible change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of\r\n      Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument and\r\n      pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their\r\n      senses, of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first\r\n      Protestants were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the\r\n      words of Jesus in the institution of the sacrament. Luther\r\n      maintained a corporeal, and Calvin a real, presence of Christ in\r\n      the eucharist; and the opinion of Zuinglius, that it is no more\r\n      than a spiritual communion, a simple memorial, has slowly\r\n      prevailed in the reformed churches. 33 But the loss of one\r\n      mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doctrines of\r\n      original sin, redemption, faith, grace, and predestination, which\r\n      have been strained from the epistles of St. Paul. These subtile\r\n      questions had most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and\r\n      schoolmen; but the final improvement and popular use may be\r\n      attributed to the first reformers, who enforced them as the\r\n      absolute and essential terms of salvation. Hitherto the weight of\r\n      supernatural belief inclines against the Protestants; and many a\r\n      sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer is God, than that\r\n      God is a cruel and capricious tyrant.\r\n\r\n      32 (return) [ The opinions and proceedings of the reformers are\r\n      exposed in the second part of the general history of Mosheim; but\r\n      the balance, which he has held with so clear an eye, and so\r\n      steady a hand, begins to incline in favor of his Lutheran\r\n      brethren.]\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Under Edward VI. our reformation was more bold and\r\n      perfect, but in the fundamental articles of the church of\r\n      England, a strong and explicit declaration against the real\r\n      presence was obliterated in the original copy, to please the\r\n      people or the Lutherans, or Queen Elizabeth, (Burnet’s History of\r\n      the Reformation, vol. ii. p. 82, 128, 302.)]\r\n\r\n      Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and\r\n      important; and the philosopher must own his obligations to these\r\n      fearless enthusiasts. 34 I. By their hands the lofty fabric of\r\n      superstition, from the abuse of indulgences to the intercesson of\r\n      the Virgin, has been levelled with the ground. Myriads of both\r\n      sexes of the monastic profession were restored to the liberty and\r\n      labors of social life. A hierarchy of saints and angels, of\r\n      imperfect and subordinate deities, were stripped of their\r\n      temporal power, and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial\r\n      happiness; their images and relics were banished from the church;\r\n      and the credulity of the people was no longer nourished with the\r\n      daily repetition of miracles and visions. The imitation of\r\n      Paganism was supplied by a pure and spiritual worship of prayer\r\n      and thanksgiving, the most worthy of man, the least unworthy of\r\n      the Deity. It only remains to observe, whether such sublime\r\n      simplicity be consistent with popular devotion; whether the\r\n      vulgar, in the absence of all visible objects, will not be\r\n      inflamed by enthusiasm, or insensibly subside in languor and\r\n      indifference. II. The chain of authority was broken, which\r\n      restrains the bigot from thinking as he pleases, and the slave\r\n      from speaking as he thinks: the popes, fathers, and councils,\r\n      were no longer the supreme and infallible judges of the world;\r\n      and each Christian was taught to acknowledge no law but the\r\n      Scriptures, no interpreter but his own conscience. This freedom,\r\n      however, was the consequence, rather than the design, of the\r\n      Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding\r\n      the tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal\r\n      rigor their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of\r\n      the magistrate to punish heretics with death. The pious or\r\n      personal animosity of Calvin proscribed in Servetus 35 the guilt\r\n      of his own rebellion; 36 and the flames of Smithfield, in which\r\n      he was afterwards consumed, had been kindled for the Anabaptists\r\n      by the zeal of Cranmer. 37 The nature of the tiger wa s the same,\r\n      but he was gradually deprived of his teeth and fangs. A spiritual\r\n      and temporal kingdom was possessed by the Roman pontiff; the\r\n      Protestant doctors were subjects of an humble rank, without\r\n      revenue or jurisdiction. His decrees were consecrated by the\r\n      antiquity of the Catholic church: their arguments and disputes\r\n      were submitted to the people; and their appeal to private\r\n      judgment was accepted beyond their wishes, by curiosity and\r\n      enthusiasm. Since the days of Luther and Calvin, a secret\r\n      reformation has been silently working in the bosom of the\r\n      reformed churches; many weeds of prejudice were eradicated; and\r\n      the disciples of Erasmus 38 diffused a spirit of freedom and\r\n      moderation. The liberty of conscience has been claimed as a\r\n      common benefit, an inalienable right: 39 the free governments of\r\n      Holland 40 and England 41 introduced the practice of toleration;\r\n      and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by the\r\n      prudence and humanity of the times. In the exercise, the mind has\r\n      understood the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows\r\n      that might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly\r\n      reason. The volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs:\r\n      the doctrine of a Protestant church is far removed from the\r\n      knowledge or belief of its private members; and the forms of\r\n      orthodoxy, the articles of faith, are subscribed with a sigh, or\r\n      a smile, by the modern clergy. Yet the friends of Christianity\r\n      are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scepticism.\r\n      The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the web of\r\n      mystery is unravelled by the Arminians, Arians, and Socinians,\r\n      whose number must not be computed from their separate\r\n      congregations; and the pillars of Revelation are shaken by those\r\n      men who preserve the name without the substance of religion, who\r\n      indulge the license without the temper of philosophy. 42 4211\r\n\r\n      34 (return) [ “Had it not been for such men as Luther and\r\n      myself,” said the fanatic Whiston to Halley the philosopher, “you\r\n      would now be kneeling before an image of St. Winifred.”]\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ The article of Servet in the Dictionnaire Critique\r\n      of Chauffepie is the best account which I have seen of this\r\n      shameful transaction.

The zeal of Calvin\r\n      seems to have been envenomed by personal malice, and perhaps\r\n      envy. He accused his adversary before their common enemies, the\r\n      judges of Vienna, and betrayed, for his destruction, the sacred\r\n      trust of a private correspondence. 2. The deed of cruelty was not\r\n      varnished by the pretence of danger to the church or state. In\r\n      his passage through Geneva, Servetus was a harmless stranger, who\r\n      neither preached, nor printed, nor made proselytes. 3. A Catholic\r\n      inquisition yields the same obedience which he requires, but\r\n      Calvin violated the golden rule of doing as he would be done by;\r\n      a rule which I read in a moral treatise of Isocrates (in Nicocle,\r\n      tom. i. p. 93, edit.

Their progress was favored by the caliphs, their\r\n      unknown and accidental auxiliaries: the Roman legions were\r\n      occupied in Asia; and after the loss of Syria, Egypt, and Africa,\r\n      the Caesars were twice reduced to the danger and disgrace of\r\n      defending their capital against the Saracens. If, in the account\r\n      of this interesting people, I have deviated from the strict and\r\n      original line of my undertaking, the merit of the subject will\r\n      hide my transgression, or solicit my excuse. In the East, in the\r\n      West, in war, in religion, in science, in their prosperity, and\r\n      in their decay, the Arabians press themselves on our curiosity:\r\n      the first overthrow of the church and empire of the Greeks may be\r\n      imputed to their arms; and the disciples of Mahomet still hold\r\n      the civil and religious sceptre of the Oriental world. But the\r\n      same labor would be unworthily bestowed on the swarms of savages,\r\n      who, between the seventh and the twelfth century, descended from\r\n      the plains of Scythia, in transient inroad or perpetual\r\n      emigration. 1 Their names are uncouth, their origins doubtful,\r\n      their actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their valor\r\n      brutal, and the uniformity of their public and private lives was\r\n      neither softened by innocence nor refined by policy. The majesty\r\n      of the Byzantine throne repelled and survived their disorderly\r\n      attacks; the greater part of these Barbarians has disappeared\r\n      without leaving any memorial of their existence, and the\r\n      despicable remnant continues, and may long continue, to groan\r\n      under the dominion of a foreign tyrant. From the antiquities of,\r\n      I. Bulgarians, II. Hungarians, and, III. Russians, I shall\r\n      content myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be\r\n      remembered. The conquests of the, IV. Normans, and the monarchy\r\n      of the, V. Turks, will naturally terminate in the memorable\r\n      Crusades to the Holy Land, and the double fall of the city and\r\n      empire of Constantine.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ All the passages of the Byzantine history which\r\n      relate to the Barbarians are compiled, methodized, and\r\n      transcribed, in a Latin version, by the laborious John Gotthelf\r\n      Stritter, in his “Memoriae Populorum, ad Danubium, Pontum\r\n      Euxinum, Paludem Maeotidem, Caucasum, Mare Caspium, et inde Magis\r\n      ad Septemtriones incolentium.” Petropoli, 1771-1779; in four\r\n      tomes, or six volumes, in 4to. But the fashion has not enhanced\r\n      the price of these raw materials.]\r\n\r\n      I. In his march to Italy, Theodoric 2 the Ostrogoth had trampled\r\n      on the arms of the Bulgarians. After this defeat, the name and\r\n      the nation are lost during a century and a half; and it may be\r\n      suspected that the same or a similar appellation was revived by\r\n      strange colonies from the Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga.\r\n      A king of the ancient Bulgaria, 3 bequeathed to his five sons a\r\n      last lesson of moderation and concord. It was received as youth\r\n      has ever received the counsels of age and experience: the five\r\n      princes buried their father; divided his subjects and cattle;\r\n      forgot his advice; separated from each other; and wandered in\r\n      quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart\r\n      of Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna. 4 But\r\n      the stream of emigration was directed or impelled towards the\r\n      capital. The modern Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the\r\n      Danube, was stamped with the name and image which it has retained\r\n      to the present hour: the new conquerors successively acquired, by\r\n      war or treaty, the Roman provinces of Dardania, Thessaly, and the\r\n      two Epirus; 5 the ecclesiastical supremacy was translated from\r\n      the native city of Justinian; and, in their prosperous age, the\r\n      obscure town of Lychnidus, or Achrida, was honored with the\r\n      throne of a king and a patriarch. 6 The unquestionable evidence\r\n      of language attests the descent of the Bulgarians from the\r\n      original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly Slavonian,\r\n      race; 7 and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians, Rascians,\r\n      Croatians, Walachians, 8 &c., followed either the standard or the\r\n      example of the leading tribe. From the Euxine to the Adriatic, in\r\n      the state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the\r\n      Greek empire, they overspread the land; and the national\r\n      appellation of the slaves 9 has been degraded by chance or malice\r\n      from the signification of glory to that of servitude. 10 Among\r\n      these colonies, the Chrobatians, 11 or Croats, who now attend the\r\n      motions of an Austrian army, are the descendants of a mighty\r\n      people, the conquerors and sovereigns of Dalmatia. The maritime\r\n      cities, and of these the infant republic of Ragusa, implored the\r\n      aid and instructions of the Byzantine court: they were advised by\r\n      the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small acknowledgment of their\r\n      fidelity to the Roman empire, and to appease, by an annual\r\n      tribute, the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians. The kingdom\r\n      of Crotia was shared by eleven Zoupans, or feudatory lords; and\r\n      their united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and one\r\n      hundred thousand foot. A long sea-coast, indented with capacious\r\n      harbors, covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of\r\n      the Italian shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to\r\n      the practice of navigation. The boats or brigantines of the\r\n      Croats were constructed after the fashion of the old Liburnians:\r\n      one hundred and eighty vessels may excite the idea of a\r\n      respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at the allowance of\r\n      ten, or twenty, or forty, men for each of these ships of war.\r\n      They were gradually converted to the more honorable service of\r\n      commerce; yet the Sclavonian pirates were still frequent and\r\n      dangerous; and it was not before the close of the tenth century\r\n      that the freedom and sovereignty of the Gulf were effectually\r\n      vindicated by the Venetian republic. 12 The ancestors of these\r\n      Dalmatian kings were equally removed from the use and abuse of\r\n      navigation: they dwelt in the White Croatia, in the inland\r\n      regions of Silesia and Little Poland, thirty days’ journey,\r\n      according to the Greek computation, from the sea of darkness.\r\n\r\n      2 (return) [ Hist. vol. iv. p. 11.]\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ Theophanes, p. 296-299.

In the ninth and tenth centuries, they\r\n      reigned to the south of the Danube; but the more powerful nations\r\n      that had followed their emigration repelled all return to the\r\n      north and all progress to the west. Yet in the obscure catalogue\r\n      of their exploits, they might boast an honor which had hitherto\r\n      been appropriated to the Goths: that of slaying in battle one of\r\n      the successors of Augustus and Constantine. The emperor\r\n      Nicephorus had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his life in\r\n      the Sclavonian, war. In his first operations he advanced with\r\n      boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the\r\n      royal court, which was probably no more than an edifice and\r\n      village of timber. But while he searched the spoil and refused\r\n      all offers of treaty, his enemies collected their spirits and\r\n      their forces: the passes of retreat were insuperably barred; and\r\n      the trembling Nicephorus was heard to exclaim, “Alas, alas!\r\n      unless we could assume the wings of birds, we cannot hope to\r\n      escape.” Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of\r\n      despair; but, on the morning of the third, the Bulgarians\r\n      surprised the camp, and the Roman prince, with the great officers\r\n      of the empire, were slaughtered in their tents. The body of\r\n      Valens had been saved from insult; but the head of Nicephorus was\r\n      exposed on a spear, and his skull, enchased with gold, was often\r\n      replenished in the feasts of victory. The Greeks bewailed the\r\n      dishonor of the throne; but they acknowledged the just punishment\r\n      of avarice and cruelty. This savage cup was deeply tinctured with\r\n      the manners of the Scythian wilderness; but they were softened\r\n      before the end of the same century by a peaceful intercourse with\r\n      the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, and the\r\n      introduction of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria\r\n      were educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople; and\r\n      Simeon, 14 a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the\r\n      rhetoric of Demosthenes and the logic of Aristotle. He\r\n      relinquished the profession of a monk for that of a king and\r\n      warrior; and in his reign of more than forty years, Bulgaria\r\n      assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth. The\r\n      Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation\r\n      from indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and\r\n      sacrilege. They purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon,\r\n      in a second battle, redeemed the loss of the first, at a time\r\n      when it was esteemed a victory to elude the arms of that\r\n      formidable nation. The Servians were overthrown, made captive and\r\n      dispersed; and those who visited the country before their\r\n      restoration could discover no more than fifty vagrants, without\r\n      women or children, who extorted a precarious subsistence from the\r\n      chase. On classic ground, on the banks of Achelous, the greeks\r\n      were defeated; their horn was broken by the strength of the\r\n      Barbaric Hercules. 15 He formed the siege of Constantinople; and,\r\n      in a personal conference with the emperor, Simeon imposed the\r\n      conditions of peace. They met with the most jealous precautions:\r\n      the royal gallery was drawn close to an artificial and\r\n      well-fortified platform; and the majesty of the purple was\r\n      emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian. “Are you a Christian?”\r\n      said the humble Romanus: “it is your duty to abstain from the\r\n      blood of your fellow-Christians. Has the thirst of riches seduced\r\n      you from the blessings of peace? Sheathe your sword, open your\r\n      hand, and I will satiate the utmost measure of your desires.” The\r\n      reconciliation was sealed by a domestic alliance; the freedom of\r\n      trade was granted or restored; the first honors of the court were\r\n      secured to the friends of Bulgaria, above the ambassadors of\r\n      enemies or strangers; 16 and her princes were dignified with the\r\n      high and invidious title of Basileus, or emperor. But this\r\n      friendship was soon disturbed: after the death of Simeon, the\r\n      nations were again in arms; his feeble successors were divided\r\n      and extinguished; and, in the beginning of the eleventh century,\r\n      the second Basil, who was born in the purple, deserved the\r\n      appellation of conqueror of the Bulgarians. His avarice was in\r\n      some measure gratified by a treasure of four hundred thousand\r\n      pounds sterling, (ten thousand pounds’ weight of gold,) which he\r\n      found in the palace of Lychnidus. His cruelty inflicted a cool\r\n      and exquisite vengeance on fifteen thousand captives who had been\r\n      guilty of the defence of their country. They were deprived of\r\n      sight; but to one of each hundred a single eye was left, that he\r\n      might conduct his blind century to the presence of their king.\r\n      Their king is said to have expired of grief and horror; the\r\n      nation was awed by this terrible example; the Bulgarians were\r\n      swept away from their settlements, and circumscribed within a\r\n      narrow province; the surviving chiefs bequeathed to their\r\n      children the advice of patience and the duty of revenge.\r\n\r\n      13 (return) [ The first kingdom of the Bulgarians may be found,\r\n      under the proper dates, in the Annals of Cedrenus and Zonaras.\r\n      The Byzantine materials are collected by Stritter, (Memoriae\r\n      Populorum, tom. ii. pars ii. p. 441-647;) and the series of their\r\n      kings is disposed and settled by Ducange, (Fam.

When the black swarm of Hungarians first hung over Europe,\r\n      above nine hundred years after the Christian aera, they were\r\n      mistaken by fear and superstition for the Gog and Magog of the\r\n      Scriptures, the signs and forerunners of the end of the world. 17\r\n      Since the introduction of letters, they have explored their own\r\n      antiquities with a strong and laudable impulse of patriotic\r\n      curiosity. 18 Their rational criticism can no longer be amused\r\n      with a vain pedigree of Attila and the Huns; but they complain\r\n      that their primitive records have perished in the Tartar war;\r\n      that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since\r\n      forgotten; and that the fragments of a rude chronicle 19 must be\r\n      painfully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign\r\n      intelligence of the imperial geographer. 20 Magiar is the\r\n      national and oriental denomination of the Hungarians; but, among\r\n      the tribes of Scythia, they are distinguished by the Greeks under\r\n      the proper and peculiar name of Turks, as the descendants of that\r\n      mighty people who had conquered and reigned from China to the\r\n      Volga. The Pannonian colony preserved a correspondence of trade\r\n      and amity with the eastern Turks on the confines of Persia and\r\n      after a separation of three hundred and fifty years, the\r\n      missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their\r\n      ancient country near the banks of the Volga. They were hospitably\r\n      entertained by a people of Pagans and Savages who still bore the\r\n      name of Hungarians; conversed in their native tongue, recollected\r\n      a tradition of their long-lost brethren, and listened with\r\n      amazement to the marvellous tale of their new kingdom and\r\n      religion. The zeal of conversion was animated by the interest of\r\n      consanguinity; and one of the greatest of their princes had\r\n      formed the generous, though fruitless, design of replenishing the\r\n      solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony from the heart of\r\n      Tartary. 21 From this primitive country they were driven to the\r\n      West by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight of the more\r\n      distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and\r\n      conquerors. 2111 Reason or fortune directed their course towards\r\n      the frontiers of the Roman empire: they halted in the usual\r\n      stations along the banks of the great rivers; and in the\r\n      territories of Moscow, Kiow, and Moldavia, some vestiges have\r\n      been discovered of their temporary residence. In this long and\r\n      various peregrination, they could not always escape the dominion\r\n      of the stronger; and the purity of their blood was improved or\r\n      sullied by the mixture of a foreign race: from a motive of\r\n      compulsion, or choice, several tribes of the Chazars were\r\n      associated to the standard of their ancient vassals; introduced\r\n      the use of a second language; and obtained by their superior\r\n      renown the most honorable place in the front of battle. The\r\n      military force of the Turks and their allies marched in seven\r\n      equal and artificial divisions; each division was formed of\r\n      thirty thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven warriors, and the\r\n      proportion of women, children, and servants, supposes and\r\n      requires at least a million of emigrants. Their public counsels\r\n      were directed by seven vayvods, or hereditary chiefs; but the\r\n      experience of discord and weakness recommended the more simple\r\n      and vigorous administration of a single person. The sceptre,\r\n      which had been declined by the modest Lebedias, was granted to\r\n      the birth or merit of Almus and his son Arpad, and the authority\r\n      of the supreme khan of the Chazars confirmed the engagement of\r\n      the prince and people; of the people to obey his commands, of the\r\n      prince to consult their happiness and glory.\r\n\r\n      17 (return) [ A bishop of Wurtzburgh submitted his opinion to a\r\n      reverend abbot; but he more gravely decided, that Gog and Magog\r\n      were the spiritual persecutors of the church; since Gog signifies\r\n      the root, the pride of the Heresiarchs, and Magog what comes from\r\n      the root, the propagation of their sects.

But he adds, that the two nations of Bulgarians and\r\n      Hungarians were superior to their brethren, and similar to each\r\n      other in the improvements, however rude, of their discipline and\r\n      government: their visible likeness determines Leo to confound his\r\n      friends and enemies in one common description; and the picture\r\n      may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries of\r\n      the tenth century. Except the merit and fame of military prowess,\r\n      all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to\r\n      these Barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the\r\n      consciousness of numbers and freedom. The tents of the Hungarians\r\n      were of leather, their garments of fur; they shaved their hair,\r\n      and scarified their faces: in speech they were slow, in action\r\n      prompt, in treaty perfidious; and they shared the common reproach\r\n      of Barbarians, too ignorant to conceive the importance of truth,\r\n      too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their most solemn\r\n      engagements. Their simplicity has been praised; yet they\r\n      abstained only from the luxury they had never known; whatever\r\n      they saw they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their\r\n      sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. By the\r\n      definition of a pastoral nation, I have recalled a long\r\n      description of the economy, the warfare, and the government that\r\n      prevail in that state of society; I may add, that to fishing, as\r\n      well as to the chase, the Hungarians were indebted for a part of\r\n      their subsistence; and since they seldom cultivated the ground,\r\n      they must, at least in their new settlements, have sometimes\r\n      practised a slight and unskilful husbandry. In their emigrations,\r\n      perhaps in their expeditions, the host was accompanied by\r\n      thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of\r\n      formidable dust, and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of\r\n      milk and animal food. A plentiful command of forage was the first\r\n      care of the general, and if the flocks and herds were secure of\r\n      their pastures, the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger\r\n      and fatigue. The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the\r\n      country exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise, had not a\r\n      still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry,\r\n      perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the\r\n      enemy. After some experience of the Roman tactics, they adopted\r\n      the use of the sword and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and\r\n      the iron breastplate of his steed: but their native and deadly\r\n      weapon was the Tartar bow: from the earliest infancy their\r\n      children and servants were exercised in the double science of\r\n      archery and horsemanship; their arm was strong; their aim was\r\n      sure; and in the most rapid career, they were taught to throw\r\n      themselves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows into the\r\n      air. In open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit,\r\n      they were equally formidable; an appearance of order was\r\n      maintained in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven\r\n      forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding crowds. They\r\n      pursued, headlong and rash, with loosened reins and horrific\r\n      outcries; but, if they fled, with real or dissembled fear, the\r\n      ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the same\r\n      habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution. In the abuse of\r\n      victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the wounds of\r\n      the Saracen and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more\r\n      rarely bestowed: both sexes if accused is equally inaccessible to\r\n      pity, and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the\r\n      popular tale, that they drank the blood, and feasted on the\r\n      hearts of the slain. Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those\r\n      principles of justice and humanity, which nature has implanted in\r\n      every bosom. The license of public and private injuries was\r\n      restrained by laws and punishments; and in the security of an\r\n      open camp, theft is the most tempting and most dangerous offence.\r\n      Among the Barbarians there were many, whose spontaneous virtue\r\n      supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who performed\r\n      the duties, and sympathized with the affections, of social life.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ Leo has observed, that the government of the Turks\r\n      was monarchical, and that their punishments were rigorous,\r\n      (Tactic. p. 896) Rhegino (in Chron. A.D. 889) mentions theft as a\r\n      capital crime, and his jurisprudence is confirmed by the original\r\n      code of St. Stephen, (A.D. 1016.) If a slave were guilty, he was\r\n      chastised, for the first time, with the loss of his nose, or a\r\n      fine of five heifers; for the second, with the loss of his ears,\r\n      or a similar fine; for the third, with death; which the freeman\r\n      did not incur till the fourth offence, as his first penalty was\r\n      the loss of liberty, (Katona, Hist. Regum Hungar tom. i. p. 231,\r\n      232.)]\r\n\r\n      After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the Turkish hordes\r\n      approached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires.\r\n      Their first conquests and final settlements extended on either\r\n      side of the Danube above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the\r\n      measure of the Roman province of Pannonia, or the modern kingdom\r\n      of Hungary. 30 That ample and fertile land was loosely occupied\r\n      by the Moravians, a Sclavonian name and tribe, which were driven\r\n      by the invaders into the compass of a narrow province.\r\n      Charlemagne had stretched a vague and nominal empire as far as\r\n      the edge of Transylvania; but, after the failure of his\r\n      legitimate line, the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedience and\r\n      tribute to the monarchs of Oriental France. The bastard Arnulph\r\n      was provoked to invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed through\r\n      the real or figurative wall, which his indiscretion had thrown\r\n      open; and the king of Germany has been justly reproached as a\r\n      traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical society of the\r\n      Christians. During the life of Arnulph, the Hungarians were\r\n      checked by gratitude or fear; but in the infancy of his son Lewis\r\n      they discovered and invaded Bavaria; and such was their Scythian\r\n      speed, that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped\r\n      and consumed. In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians\r\n      maintained their advantage till the seventh hour of the day, they\r\n      were deceived and vanquished by the flying stratagems of the\r\n      Turkish cavalry. The conflagration spread over the provinces of\r\n      Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the Hungarians 31 promoted\r\n      the reign of anarchy, by forcing the stoutest barons to\r\n      discipline their vassals and fortify their castles. The origin of\r\n      walled towns is ascribed to this calamitous period; nor could any\r\n      distance be secure against an enemy, who, almost at the same\r\n      instant, laid in ashes the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall, and\r\n      the city of Bremen, on the shores of the northern ocean. Above\r\n      thirty years the Germanic empire, or kingdom, was subject to the\r\n      ignominy of tribute; and resistance was disarmed by the menace,\r\n      the serious and effectual menace of dragging the women and\r\n      children into captivity, and of slaughtering the males above the\r\n      age of ten years. I have neither power nor inclination to follow\r\n      the Hungarians beyond the Rhine; but I must observe with\r\n      surprise, that the southern provinces of France were blasted by\r\n      the tempest, and that Spain, behind her Pyrenees, was astonished\r\n      at the approach of these formidable strangers. 32 The vicinity of\r\n      Italy had tempted their early inroads; but from their camp on the\r\n      Brenta, they beheld with some terror the apparent strength and\r\n      populousness of the new discovered country. They requested leave\r\n      to retire; their request was proudly rejected by the Italian\r\n      king; and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the\r\n      forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness. Among the cities of the\r\n      West, the royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor; and\r\n      the preeminence of Rome itself was only derived from the relics\r\n      of the apostles. The Hungarians appeared; Pavia was in flames;\r\n      forty-three churches were consumed; and, after the massacre of\r\n      the people, they spared about two hundred wretches who had\r\n      gathered some bushels of gold and silver (a vague exaggeration)\r\n      from the smoking ruins of their country. In these annual\r\n      excursions from the Alps to the neighborhood of Rome and Capua,\r\n      the churches, that yet escaped, resounded with a fearful litany:\r\n      “O, save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians!” But\r\n      the saints were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled\r\n      forwards, till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria. 33\r\n      A composition was offered and accepted for the head of each\r\n      Italian subject; and ten bushels of silver were poured forth in\r\n      the Turkish camp. But falsehood is the natural antagonist of\r\n      violence; and the robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of\r\n      the assessment and the standard of the metal. On the side of the\r\n      East, the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the\r\n      equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade an alliance\r\n      with the Pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier of the\r\n      Byzantine empire. The barrier was overturned; the emperor of\r\n      Constantinople beheld the waving banners of the Turks; and one of\r\n      their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battle-axe into the\r\n      golden gate. The arts and treasures of the Greeks diverted the\r\n      assault; but the Hungarians might boast, in their retreat, that\r\n      they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria and the\r\n      majesty of the Caesars. 34 The remote and rapid operations of the\r\n      same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the\r\n      Turks; but their courage is most deserving of praise, since a\r\n      light troop of three or four hundred horse would often attempt\r\n      and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica\r\n      and Constantinople. At this disastrous aera of the ninth and\r\n      tenth centuries, Europe was afflicted by a triple scourge from\r\n      the North, the East, and the South: the Norman, the Hungarian,\r\n      and the Saracen, sometimes trod the same ground of desolation;\r\n      and these savage foes might have been compared by Homer to the\r\n      two lions growling over the carcass of a mangled stag. 35\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ See Katona, Hist.

They were invited by\r\n      domestic faction; the gates of Germany were treacherously\r\n      unlocked; and they spread, far beyond the Rhine and the Meuse,\r\n      into the heart of Flanders. But the vigor and prudence of Otho\r\n      dispelled the conspiracy; the princes were made sensible that\r\n      unless they were true to each other, their religion and country\r\n      were irrecoverably lost; and the national powers were reviewed in\r\n      the plains of Augsburgh. They marched and fought in eight\r\n      legions, according to the division of provinces and tribes; the\r\n      first, second, and third, were composed of Bavarians; the fourth,\r\n      of Franconians; the fifth, of Saxons, under the immediate command\r\n      of the monarch; the sixth and seventh consisted of Swabians; and\r\n      the eighth legion, of a thousand Bohemians, closed the rear of\r\n      the host. The resources of discipline and valor were fortified by\r\n      the arts of superstition, which, on this occasion, may deserve\r\n      the epithets of generous and salutary. The soldiers were purified\r\n      with a fast; the camp was blessed with the relics of saints and\r\n      martyrs; and the Christian hero girded on his side the sword of\r\n      Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and\r\n      waved the banner of St. Maurice, the praefect of the Thebaean\r\n      legion. But his firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance,\r\n      38 whose point was fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which\r\n      his father had extorted from the king of Burgundy, by the threats\r\n      of war, and the gift of a province. The Hungarians were expected\r\n      in the front; they secretly passed the Lech, a river of Bavaria\r\n      that falls into the Danube; turned the rear of the Christian\r\n      army; plundered the baggage, and disordered the legion of Bohemia\r\n      and Swabia. The battle was restored by the Franconians, whose\r\n      duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an arrow as he rested\r\n      from his fatigues: the Saxons fought under the eyes of their\r\n      king; and his victory surpassed, in merit and importance, the\r\n      triumphs of the last two hundred years. The loss of the\r\n      Hungarians was still greater in the flight than in the action;\r\n      they were encompassed by the rivers of Bavaria; and their past\r\n      cruelties excluded them from the hope of mercy. Three captive\r\n      princes were hanged at Ratisbon, the multitude of prisoners was\r\n      slain or mutilated, and the fugitives, who presumed to appear in\r\n      the face of their country, were condemned to everlasting poverty\r\n      and disgrace. 39 Yet the spirit of the nation was humbled, and\r\n      the most accessible passes of Hungary were fortified with a ditch\r\n      and rampart. Adversity suggested the counsels of moderation and\r\n      peace: the robbers of the West acquiesced in a sedentary life;\r\n      and the next generation was taught, by a discerning prince, that\r\n      far more might be gained by multiplying and exchanging the\r\n      produce of a fruitful soil. The native race, the Turkish or\r\n      Fennic blood, was mingled with new colonies of Scythian or\r\n      Sclavonian origin; 40 many thousands of robust and industrious\r\n      captives had been imported from all the countries of Europe; 41\r\n      and after the marriage of Geisa with a Bavarian princess, he\r\n      bestowed honors and estates on the nobles of Germany. 42 The son\r\n      of Geisa was invested with the regal title, and the house of\r\n      Arpad reigned three hundred years in the kingdom of Hungary. But\r\n      the freeborn Barbarians were not dazzled by the lustre of the\r\n      diadem, and the people asserted their indefeasible right of\r\n      choosing, deposing, and punishing the hereditary servant of the\r\n      state.\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ They are amply and critically discussed by Katona,\r\n      (Hist.

Critic. Ducum. p,\r\n      667-681.)]\r\n\r\n      III. The name of Russians 43 was first divulged, in the ninth\r\n      century, by an embassy of Theophilus, emperor of the East, to the\r\n      emperor of the West, Lewis, the son of Charlemagne. The Greeks\r\n      were accompanied by the envoys of the great duke, or chagan, or\r\n      czar, of the Russians. In their journey to Constantinople, they\r\n      had traversed many hostile nations; and they hoped to escape the\r\n      dangers of their return, by requesting the French monarch to\r\n      transport them by sea to their native country. A closer\r\n      examination detected their origin: they were the brethren of the\r\n      Swedes and Normans, whose name was already odious and formidable\r\n      in France; and it might justly be apprehended, that these Russian\r\n      strangers were not the messengers of peace, but the emissaries of\r\n      war. They were detained, while the Greeks were dismissed; and\r\n      Lewis expected a more satisfactory account, that he might obey\r\n      the laws of hospitality or prudence, according to the interest of\r\n      both empires. 44 This Scandinavian origin of the people, or at\r\n      least the princes, of Russia, may be confirmed and illustrated by\r\n      the national annals 45 and the general history of the North. The\r\n      Normans, who had so long been concealed by a veil of impenetrable\r\n      darkness, suddenly burst forth in the spirit of naval and\r\n      military enterprise. The vast, and, as it is said, the populous\r\n      regions of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, were crowded with\r\n      independent chieftains and desperate adventurers, who sighed in\r\n      the laziness of peace, and smiled in the agonies of death. Piracy\r\n      was the exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue, of the\r\n      Scandinavian youth. Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow\r\n      limits, they started from the banquet, grasped their arms,\r\n      sounded their horn, ascended their vessels, and explored every\r\n      coast that promised either spoil or settlement. The Baltic was\r\n      the first scene of their naval achievements they visited the\r\n      eastern shores, the silent residence of Fennic and Sclavonic\r\n      tribes, and the primitive Russians of the Lake Ladoga paid a\r\n      tribute, the skins of white squirrels, to these strangers, whom\r\n      they saluted with the title of Varangians 46 or Corsairs. Their\r\n      superiority in arms, discipline, and renown, commanded the fear\r\n      and reverence of the natives. In their wars against the more\r\n      inland savages, the Varangians condescended to serve as friends\r\n      and auxiliaries, and gradually, by choice or conquest, obtained\r\n      the dominion of a people whom they were qualified to protect.\r\n      Their tyranny was expelled, their valor was again recalled, till\r\n      at length Ruric, a Scandinavian chief, became the father of a\r\n      dynasty which reigned above seven hundred years. His brothers\r\n      extended his influence: the example of service and usurpation was\r\n      imitated by his companions in the southern provinces of Russia;\r\n      and their establishments, by the usual methods of war and\r\n      assassination, were cemented into the fabric of a powerful\r\n      monarchy.\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ Among the Greeks, this national appellation has a\r\n      singular form, as an undeclinable word, of which many fanciful\r\n      etymologies have been suggested.

The names of the first\r\n      founders of the Russian monarchy are Scandinavian or Norman.\r\n      Their language (according to Const. Porphyrog. de Administrat.\r\n      Imper. c. 9) differed essentially from the Sclavonian. The author\r\n      of the Annals of St. Bertin, who first names the Russians (Rhos)\r\n      in the year 839 of his Annals, assigns them Sweden for their\r\n      country.

They had seated him on the throne; his\r\n      riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands; but they\r\n      listened to his pleasing advice, that they should seek, not a\r\n      more grateful, but a more wealthy, master; that they should\r\n      embark for Greece, where, instead of the skins of squirrels, silk\r\n      and gold would be the recompense of their service. At the same\r\n      time, the Russian prince admonished his Byzantine ally to\r\n      disperse and employ, to recompense and restrain, these impetuous\r\n      children of the North. Contemporary writers have recorded the\r\n      introduction, name, and character, of the Varangians: each day\r\n      they rose in confidence and esteem; the whole body was assembled\r\n      at Constantinople to perform the duty of guards; and their\r\n      strength was recruited by a numerous band of their countrymen\r\n      from the Island of Thule. On this occasion, the vague appellation\r\n      of Thule is applied to England; and the new Varangians were a\r\n      colony of English and Danes who fled from the yoke of the Norman\r\n      conqueror. The habits of pilgrimage and piracy had approximated\r\n      the countries of the earth; these exiles were entertained in the\r\n      Byzantine court; and they preserved, till the last age of the\r\n      empire, the inheritance of spotless loyalty, and the use of the\r\n      Danish or English tongue. With their broad and double-edged\r\n      battle-axes on their shoulders, they attended the Greek emperor\r\n      to the temple, the senate, and the hippodrome; he slept and\r\n      feasted under their trusty guard; and the keys of the palace, the\r\n      treasury, and the capital, were held by the firm and faithful\r\n      hands of the Varangians. 48\r\n\r\n      47 (return) [ Yet, as late as the year 1018, Kiow and Russia were\r\n      still guarded ex fugitivorum servorum robore, confluentium et\r\n      maxime Danorum.

Their northern reign ascended above the\r\n      sixtieth degree of latitude over the Hyperborean regions, which\r\n      fancy had peopled with monsters, or clouded with eternal\r\n      darkness. To the south they followed the course of the\r\n      Borysthenes, and approached with that river the neighborhood of\r\n      the Euxine Sea. The tribes that dwelt, or wandered, in this ample\r\n      circuit were obedient to the same conqueror, and insensibly\r\n      blended into the same nation. The language of Russia is a dialect\r\n      of the Sclavonian; but in the tenth century, these two modes of\r\n      speech were different from each other; and, as the Sclavonian\r\n      prevailed in the South, it may be presumed that the original\r\n      Russians of the North, the primitive subjects of the Varangian\r\n      chief, were a portion of the Fennic race. With the emigration,\r\n      union, or dissolution, of the wandering tribes, the loose and\r\n      indefinite picture of the Scythian desert has continually\r\n      shifted. But the most ancient map of Russia affords some places\r\n      which still retain their name and position; and the two capitals,\r\n      Novogorod 50 and Kiow, 51 are coeval with the first age of the\r\n      monarchy. Novogorod had not yet deserved the epithet of great,\r\n      nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League, which diffused the\r\n      streams of opulence and the principles of freedom. Kiow could not\r\n      yet boast of three hundred churches, an innumerable people, and a\r\n      degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with\r\n      Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the\r\n      Caesars. In their origin, the two cities were no more than camps\r\n      or fairs, the most convenient stations in which the Barbarians\r\n      might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade. Yet\r\n      even these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of\r\n      society; a new breed of cattle was imported from the southern\r\n      provinces; and the spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the\r\n      sea and land, from the Baltic to the Euxine, from the mouth of\r\n      the Oder to the port of Constantinople. In the days of idolatry\r\n      and barbarism, the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and\r\n      enriched by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free mart of\r\n      purchase and exchange. 52 From this harbor, at the entrance of\r\n      the Oder, the corsair, or merchant, sailed in forty-three days to\r\n      the eastern shores of the Baltic, the most distant nations were\r\n      intermingled, and the holy groves of Curland are said to have\r\n      been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold. 53 Between the sea\r\n      and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered; in the summer,\r\n      through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable river; in the winter\r\n      season, over the hard and level surface of boundless snows. From\r\n      the neighborhood of that city, the Russians descended the streams\r\n      that fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a single tree,\r\n      were laden with slaves of every age, furs of every species, the\r\n      spoil of their beehives, and the hides of their cattle; and the\r\n      whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the\r\n      magazines of Kiow. The month of June was the ordinary season of\r\n      the departure of the fleet: the timber of the canoes was framed\r\n      into the oars and benches of more solid and capacious boats; and\r\n      they proceeded without obstacle down the Borysthenes, as far as\r\n      the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks, which traverse the bed,\r\n      and precipitate the waters, of the river. At the more shallow\r\n      falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the deeper\r\n      cataracts were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their\r\n      vessels and their slaves six miles over land, were exposed in\r\n      this toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert. 54 At the\r\n      first island below the falls, the Russians celebrated the\r\n      festival of their escape: at a second, near the mouth of the\r\n      river, they repaired their shattered vessels for the longer and\r\n      more perilous voyage of the Black Sea. If they steered along the\r\n      coast, the Danube was accessible; with a fair wind they could\r\n      reach in thirty-six or forty hours the opposite shores of\r\n      Anatolia; and Constantinople admitted the annual visit of the\r\n      strangers of the North. They returned at the stated season with a\r\n      rich cargo of corn, wine, and oil, the manufactures of Greece,\r\n      and the spices of India. Some of their countrymen resided in the\r\n      capital and provinces; and the national treaties protected the\r\n      persons, effects, and privileges, of the Russian merchant. 55\r\n\r\n      49 (return) [ The original record of the geography and trade of\r\n      Russia is produced by the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus,\r\n      (de Administrat.

In a period of one\r\n      hundred and ninety years, the Russians made four attempts to\r\n      plunder the treasures of Constantinople: the event was various,\r\n      but the motive, the means, and the object, were the same in these\r\n      naval expeditions. 56 The Russian traders had seen the\r\n      magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars. A\r\n      marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires of\r\n      their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which\r\n      their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they\r\n      were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the\r\n      Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure,\r\n      and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt\r\n      in the northern isles of the ocean. 57 The image of their naval\r\n      armaments was revived in the last century, in the fleets of the\r\n      Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to navigate the same\r\n      seas for a similar purpose. 58 The Greek appellation of monoxyla,\r\n      or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of their\r\n      vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or\r\n      willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and\r\n      continued on either side with planks, till it attained the length\r\n      of sixty, and the height of about twelve, feet. These boats were\r\n      built without a deck, but with two rudders and a mast; to move\r\n      with sails and oars; and to contain from forty to seventy men,\r\n      with their arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish. The\r\n      first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred boats; but\r\n      when the national force was exerted, they might arm against\r\n      Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet\r\n      was not much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was\r\n      magnified in the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real\r\n      proportion of its strength and numbers. Had the Greek emperors\r\n      been endowed with foresight to discern, and vigor to prevent,\r\n      perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime force the mouth of\r\n      the Borysthenes. Their indolence abandoned the coast of Anatolia\r\n      to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after an interval of\r\n      six hundred years, again infested the Euxine; but as long as the\r\n      capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province\r\n      escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian. The\r\n      storm which had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond, at\r\n      length burst on the Bosphorus of Thrace; a strait of fifteen\r\n      miles, in which the rude vessels of the Russians might have been\r\n      stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary. In their first\r\n      enterprise 59 under the princes of Kiow, they passed without\r\n      opposition, and occupied the port of Constantinople in the\r\n      absence of the emperor Michael, the son of Theophilus. Through a\r\n      crowd of perils, he landed at the palace-stairs, and immediately\r\n      repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary. 60 By the advice of the\r\n      patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from the\r\n      sanctuary and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which\r\n      determined the retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to\r\n      the mother of God. 61 The silence of the Greeks may inspire some\r\n      doubt of the truth, or at least of the importance, of the second\r\n      attempt by Oleg, the guardian of the sons of Ruric. 62 A strong\r\n      barrier of arms and fortifications defended the Bosphorus: they\r\n      were eluded by the usual expedient of drawing the boats over the\r\n      isthmus; and this simple operation is described in the national\r\n      chronicles, as if the Russian fleet had sailed over dry land with\r\n      a brisk and favorable gale. The leader of the third armament,\r\n      Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a moment of weakness and\r\n      decay, when the naval powers of the empire were employed against\r\n      the Saracens. But if courage be not wanting, the instruments of\r\n      defence are seldom deficient. Fifteen broken and decayed galleys\r\n      were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the single\r\n      tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow, the sides and\r\n      stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid\r\n      combustible. The engineers were dexterous; the weather was\r\n      propitious; many thousand Russians, who chose rather to be\r\n      drowned than burnt, leaped into the sea; and those who escaped to\r\n      the Thracian shore were inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and\r\n      soldiers. Yet one third of the canoes escaped into shallow water;\r\n      and the next spring Igor was again prepared to retrieve his\r\n      disgrace and claim his revenge. 63 After a long peace, Jaroslaus,\r\n      the great grandson of Igor, resumed the same project of a naval\r\n      invasion. A fleet, under the command of his son, was repulsed at\r\n      the entrance of the Bosphorus by the same artificial flames. But\r\n      in the rashness of pursuit, the vanguard of the Greeks was\r\n      encompassed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men; their\r\n      provision of fire was probably exhausted; and twenty-four galleys\r\n      were either taken, sunk, or destroyed. 64\r\n\r\n      56 (return) [ The wars of the Russians and Greeks in the ixth,\r\n      xth, and xith centuries, are related in the Byzantine annals,\r\n      especially those of Zonaras and Cedrenus; and all their\r\n      testimonies are collected in the Russica of Stritter, tom. ii.\r\n      pars ii. p. 939-1044.]\r\n\r\n      57 (return) [ Cedrenus in Compend. p. 758]\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ See Beauplan, (Description de l’Ukraine, p. 54-61:\r\n      ) his descriptions are lively, his plans accurate, and except the\r\n      circumstances of fire-arms, we may read old Russians for modern\r\n      Cosacks.]\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [ It is to be lamented, that Bayer has only given a\r\n      Dissertation de Russorum prima Expeditione Constantinopolitana,\r\n      (Comment.

In these naval\r\n      hostilities, every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks;\r\n      their savage enemy afforded no mercy: his poverty promised no\r\n      spoil; his impenetrable retreat deprived the conqueror of the\r\n      hopes of revenge; and the pride or weakness of empire indulged an\r\n      opinion, that no honor could be gained or lost in the intercourse\r\n      with Barbarians. At first their demands were high and\r\n      inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner of\r\n      the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest\r\n      and glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the\r\n      hoary sages. “Be content,” they said, “with the liberal offers of\r\n      Caesar; is it not far better to obtain without a combat the\r\n      possession of gold, silver, silks, and all the objects of our\r\n      desires? Are we sure of victory? Can we conclude a treaty with\r\n      the sea? We do not tread on the land; we float on the abyss of\r\n      water, and a common death hangs over our heads.” 65 The memory of\r\n      these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend from the polar circle\r\n      left deep impression of terror on the Imperial city. By the\r\n      vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an\r\n      equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed\r\n      with a prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should\r\n      become masters of Constantinople. 66 In our own time, a Russian\r\n      armament, instead of sailing from the Borysthenes, has\r\n      circumnavigated the continent of Europe; and the Turkish capital\r\n      has been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of\r\n      war, each of which, with its naval science and thundering\r\n      artillery, could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes, such as\r\n      those of their ancestors. Perhaps the present generation may yet\r\n      behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare\r\n      prediction, of which the style is unambiguous and the date\r\n      unquestionable.\r\n\r\n      65 (return) [ Nestor, apud Leveque, Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p.\r\n      87.]\r\n\r\n      66 (return) [ This brazen statue, which had been brought from\r\n      Antioch, and was melted down by the Latins, was supposed to\r\n      represent either Joshua or Bellerophon, an odd dilemma.

Yet their growing towns, however slight and\r\n      imperfect, presented a shelter to the subject, and a barrier to\r\n      the enemy: the monarchy of Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed\r\n      the dominion of the North; and the nations from the Volga to the\r\n      Danube were subdued or repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus, 67 the\r\n      son of Igor, the son of Oleg, the son of Ruric. The vigor of his\r\n      mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and\r\n      savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swatoslaus usually slept on\r\n      the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse\r\n      and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, 68 his meat (it was\r\n      often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The\r\n      exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it\r\n      may be presumed, that no soldier was permitted to transcend the\r\n      luxury of his chief. By an embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek\r\n      emperor, he was moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria; and\r\n      a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to\r\n      defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the expedition. An\r\n      army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked; they\r\n      sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was\r\n      effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the\r\n      swords of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the\r\n      Bulgarian horse. The vanquished king sunk into the grave; his\r\n      children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as Mount\r\n      Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders. But\r\n      instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his\r\n      engagements, the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance\r\n      than to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success,\r\n      the seat of empire in that early period might have been\r\n      transferred to a more temperate and fruitful climate. Swatoslaus\r\n      enjoyed and acknowledged the advantages of his new position, in\r\n      which he could unite, by exchange or rapine, the various\r\n      productions of the earth. By an easy navigation he might draw\r\n      from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and hydromed:\r\n      Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils of the\r\n      West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign\r\n      luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of\r\n      Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of\r\n      victory; and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust,\r\n      assumed the purple, and promised to share with his new allies the\r\n      treasures of the Eastern world. From the banks of the Danube the\r\n      Russian prince pursued his march as far as Adrianople; a formal\r\n      summons to evacuate the Roman province was dismissed with\r\n      contempt; and Swatoslaus fiercely replied, that Constantinople\r\n      might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ The life of Swatoslaus, or Sviatoslaf, or\r\n      Sphendosthlabus, is extracted from the Russian Chronicles by M.\r\n      Levesque, (Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p. 94-107.)]\r\n\r\n      68 (return) [ This resemblance may be clearly seen in the ninth\r\n      book of the Iliad, (205-221,) in the minute detail of the cookery\r\n      of Achilles.

The first victory of his lieutenants\r\n      deprived the Russians of their foreign allies, twenty thousand of\r\n      whom were either destroyed by the sword, or provoked to revolt,\r\n      or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, but seventy thousand\r\n      Barbarians were still in arms; and the legions that had been\r\n      recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the\r\n      return of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike\r\n      prince, who declared himself the friend and avenger of the\r\n      injured Bulgaria. The passes of Mount Haemus had been left\r\n      unguarded; they were instantly occupied; the Roman vanguard was\r\n      formed of the immortals, (a proud imitation of the Persian\r\n      style;) the emperor led the main body of ten thousand five\r\n      hundred foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow and\r\n      cautious array, with the baggage and military engines. The first\r\n      exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or\r\n      Peristhlaba, 70 in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were\r\n      scaled; eight thousand five hundred Russians were put to the\r\n      sword; and the sons of the Bulgarian king were rescued from an\r\n      ignominious prison, and invested with a nominal diadem. After\r\n      these repeated losses, Swatoslaus retired to the strong post of\r\n      Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was pursued by an enemy\r\n      who alternately employed the arms of celerity and delay. The\r\n      Byzantine galleys ascended the river, the legions completed a\r\n      line of circumvallation; and the Russian prince was encompassed,\r\n      assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and\r\n      city. Many deeds of valor were performed; several desperate\r\n      sallies were attempted; nor was it till after a siege of\r\n      sixty-five days that Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune.\r\n      The liberal terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the\r\n      victor, who respected the valor, and apprehended the despair, of\r\n      an unconquered mind. The great duke of Russia bound himself, by\r\n      solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe\r\n      passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade and\r\n      navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to\r\n      each of his soldiers; and the allowance of twenty-two thousand\r\n      measures attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians.\r\n      After a painful voyage, they again reached the mouth of the\r\n      Borysthenes; but their provisions were exhausted; the season was\r\n      unfavorable; they passed the winter on the ice; and, before they\r\n      could prosecute their march, Swatoslaus was surprised and\r\n      oppressed by the neighboring tribes with whom the Greeks\r\n      entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence. 71 Far\r\n      different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his\r\n      capital like Camillus or Marius, the saviors of ancient Rome. But\r\n      the merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to\r\n      the mother of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the\r\n      divine infant in her arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned\r\n      with the spoils of war, and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty.\r\n      Zimisces made his public entry on horseback; the diadem on his\r\n      head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and Constantinople was\r\n      astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign. 72\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ This singular epithet is derived from the Armenian\r\n      language.

His triumph was transient and premature. In the\r\n      various fortune of their piratical adventures, some Russian\r\n      chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the waters of\r\n      baptism; and a Greek bishop, with the name of metropolitan, might\r\n      administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow, to a\r\n      congregation of slaves and natives. But the seed of the gospel\r\n      was sown on a barren soil: many were the apostates, the converts\r\n      were few; and the baptism of Olga may be fixed as the aera of\r\n      Russian Christianity. 74 A female, perhaps of the basest origin,\r\n      who could revenge the death, and assume the sceptre, of her\r\n      husband Igor, must have been endowed with those active virtues\r\n      which command the fear and obedience of Barbarians. In a moment\r\n      of foreign and domestic peace, she sailed from Kiow to\r\n      Constantinople; and the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus has\r\n      described, with minute diligence, the ceremonial of her reception\r\n      in his capital and palace. The steps, the titles, the\r\n      salutations, the banquet, the presents, were exquisitely adjusted\r\n      to gratify the vanity of the stranger, with due reverence to the\r\n      superior majesty of the purple. 75 In the sacrament of baptism,\r\n      she received the venerable name of the empress Helena; and her\r\n      conversion might be preceded or followed by her uncle, two\r\n      interpreters, sixteen damsels of a higher, and eighteen of a\r\n      lower rank, twenty-two domestics or ministers, and forty-four\r\n      Russian merchants, who composed the retinue of the great princess\r\n      Olga. After her return to Kiow and Novogorod, she firmly\r\n      persisted in her new religion; but her labors in the propagation\r\n      of the gospel were not crowned with success; and both her family\r\n      and nation adhered with obstinacy or indifference to the gods of\r\n      their fathers. Her son Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn\r\n      and ridicule of his companions; and her grandson Wolodomir\r\n      devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and decorate the monuments\r\n      of ancient worship. The savage deities of the North were still\r\n      propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of the victim, a\r\n      citizen was preferred to a stranger, a Christian to an idolater;\r\n      and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal knife,\r\n      was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult.\r\n      Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had made a deep,\r\n      though secret, impression in the minds of the prince and people:\r\n      the Greek missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to\r\n      baptize: and the ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the\r\n      idolatry of the woods with the elegant superstition of\r\n      Constantinople. They had gazed with admiration on the dome of St.\r\n      Sophia: the lively pictures of saints and martyrs, the riches of\r\n      the altar, the number and vestments of the priests, the pomp and\r\n      order of the ceremonies; they were edified by the alternate\r\n      succession of devout silence and harmonious song; nor was it\r\n      difficult to persuade them, that a choir of angels descended each\r\n      day from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians. 76 But\r\n      the conversion of Wolodomir was determined, or hastened, by his\r\n      desire of a Roman bride. At the same time, and in the city of\r\n      Cherson, the rites of baptism and marriage were celebrated by the\r\n      Christian pontiff: the city he restored to the emperor Basil, the\r\n      brother of his spouse; but the brazen gates were transported, as\r\n      it is said, to Novogorod, and erected before the first church as\r\n      a trophy of his victory and faith. 77 At his despotic command,\r\n      Peround, the god of thunder, whom he had so long adored, was\r\n      dragged through the streets of Kiow; and twelve sturdy Barbarians\r\n      battered with clubs the misshapen image, which was indignantly\r\n      cast into the waters of the Borysthenes. The edict of Wolodomir\r\n      had proclaimed, that all who should refuse the rites of baptism\r\n      would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince; and the\r\n      rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient\r\n      Russians, who acquiesced in the truth and excellence of a\r\n      doctrine which had been embraced by the great duke and his\r\n      boyars. In the next generation, the relics of Paganism were\r\n      finally extirpated; but as the two brothers of Wolodomir had died\r\n      without baptism, their bones were taken from the grave, and\r\n      sanctified by an irregular and posthumous sacrament.\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ Phot.

A laudable ambition excited the monks both of Germany and\r\n      Greece, to visit the tents and huts of the Barbarians: poverty,\r\n      hardships, and dangers, were the lot of the first missionaries;\r\n      their courage was active and patient; their motive pure and\r\n      meritorious; their present reward consisted in the testimony of\r\n      their conscience and the respect of a grateful people; but the\r\n      fruitful harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the\r\n      proud and wealthy prelates of succeeding times. The first\r\n      conversions were free and spontaneous: a holy life and an\r\n      eloquent tongue were the only arms of the missionaries; but the\r\n      domestic fables of the Pagans were silenced by the miracles and\r\n      visions of the strangers; and the favorable temper of the chiefs\r\n      was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest. The\r\n      leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and\r\n      saints, 79 held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith\r\n      on their subjects and neighbors; the coast of the Baltic, from\r\n      Holstein to the Gulf of Finland, was invaded under the standard\r\n      of the cross; and the reign of idolatry was closed by the\r\n      conversion of Lithuania in the fourteenth century. Yet truth and\r\n      candor must acknowledge, that the conversion of the North\r\n      imparted many temporal benefits both to the old and the new\r\n      Christians. The rage of war, inherent to the human species, could\r\n      not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace; and\r\n      the ambition of Catholic princes has renewed in every age the\r\n      calamities of hostile contention. But the admission of the\r\n      Barbarians into the pale of civil and ecclesiastical society\r\n      delivered Europe from the depredations, by sea and land, of the\r\n      Normans, the Hungarians, and the Russians, who learned to spare\r\n      their brethren and cultivate their possessions. 80 The\r\n      establishment of law and order was promoted by the influence of\r\n      the clergy; and the rudiments of art and science were introduced\r\n      into the savage countries of the globe. The liberal piety of the\r\n      Russian princes engaged in their service the most skilful of the\r\n      Greeks, to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: the\r\n      dome and the paintings of St. Sophia were rudely copied in the\r\n      churches of Kiow and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were\r\n      translated into the Sclavonic idiom; and three hundred noble\r\n      youths were invited or compelled to attend the lessons of the\r\n      college of Jaroslaus. It should appear that Russia might have\r\n      derived an early and rapid improvement from her peculiar\r\n      connection with the church and state of Constantinople, which at\r\n      that age so justly despised the ignorance of the Latins. But the\r\n      Byzantine nation was servile, solitary, and verging to a hasty\r\n      decline: after the fall of Kiow, the navigation of the\r\n      Borysthenes was forgotten; the great princes of Wolodomir and\r\n      Moscow were separated from the sea and Christendom; and the\r\n      divided monarchy was oppressed by the ignominy and blindness of\r\n      Tartar servitude. 81 The Sclavonic and Scandinavian kingdoms,\r\n      which had been converted by the Latin missionaries, were exposed,\r\n      it is true, to the spiritual jurisdiction and temporal claims of\r\n      the popes; 82 but they were united in language and religious\r\n      worship, with each other, and with Rome; they imbibed the free\r\n      and generous spirit of the European republic, and gradually\r\n      shared the light of knowledge which arose on the western world.\r\n\r\n      78 (return) [ Consult the Latin text, or English version, of\r\n      Mosheim’s excellent History of the Church, under the first head\r\n      or section of each of these centuries.]\r\n\r\n      79 (return) [ In the year 1000, the ambassadors of St. Stephen\r\n      received from Pope Silvester the title of King of Hungary, with a\r\n      diadem of Greek workmanship.

The division of this flourishing state produced\r\n      the rival principalities of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua; and\r\n      the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited\r\n      the Saracens to the ruin of their common inheritance. During a\r\n      calamitous period of two hundred years, Italy was exposed to a\r\n      repetition of wounds, which the invaders were not capable of\r\n      healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest. Their\r\n      frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of\r\n      Palermo, and were entertained with too much indulgence by the\r\n      Christians of Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared on\r\n      the African coast; and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes\r\n      tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect. In\r\n      the revolution of human events, a new ambuscade was concealed in\r\n      the Caudine Forks, the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second\r\n      time with the blood of the Africans, and the sovereign of Rome\r\n      again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and Tarentum. A\r\n      colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari, which commands the\r\n      entrance of the Adriatic Gulf; and their impartial depredations\r\n      provoked the resentment, and conciliated the union of the two\r\n      emperors. An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the\r\n      Macedonian, the first of his race, and Lewis the great-grandson\r\n      of Charlemagne; 3 and each party supplied the deficiencies of his\r\n      associate. It would have been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch\r\n      to transport his stationary troops of Asia to an Italian\r\n      campaign; and the Latin arms would have been insufficient if his\r\n      superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf. The\r\n      fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks, and\r\n      by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of\r\n      four years, the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis,\r\n      who commanded in person the operations of the siege. This\r\n      important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the East\r\n      and West; but their recent amity was soon imbittered by the\r\n      mutual complaints of jealousy and pride. The Greeks assumed as\r\n      their own the merit of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph;\r\n      extolled the greatness of their powers, and affected to deride\r\n      the intemperance and sloth of the handful of Barbarians who\r\n      appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince. His reply\r\n      is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: “We\r\n      confess the magnitude of your preparation,” says the\r\n      great-grandson of Charlemagne. “Your armies were indeed as\r\n      numerous as a cloud of summer locusts, who darken the day, flap\r\n      their wings, and, after a short flight, tumble weary and\r\n      breathless to the ground. Like them, ye sunk after a feeble\r\n      effort; ye were vanquished by your own cowardice; and withdrew\r\n      from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian\r\n      subjects of the Sclavonian coast. We were few in number, and why\r\n      were we few? Because, after a tedious expectation of your\r\n      arrival, I had dismissed my host, and retained only a chosen band\r\n      of warriors to continue the blockade of the city. If they\r\n      indulged their hospitable feasts in the face of danger and death,\r\n      did these feasts abate the vigor of their enterprise? Is it by\r\n      your fasting that the walls of Bari have been overturned? Did not\r\n      these valiant Franks, diminished as they were by languor and\r\n      fatigue, intercept and vanish the three most powerful emirs of\r\n      the Saracens? and did not their defeat precipitate the fall of\r\n      the city? Bari is now fallen; Tarentum trembles; Calabria will be\r\n      delivered; and, if we command the sea, the Island of Sicily may\r\n      be rescued from the hands of the infidels.

Eccles. A.D. 871, No. 51-71,) from the\r\n      Vatican Ms. of Erchempert, or rather of the anonymous historian\r\n      of Salerno.] These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the\r\n      death of Lewis, and the decay of the Carlovingian house; and\r\n      whoever might deserve the honor, the Greek emperors, Basil, and\r\n      his son Leo, secured the advantage, of the reduction of Bari. The\r\n      Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to\r\n      acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from Mount\r\n      Garganus to the Bay of Salerno, leaves the far greater part of\r\n      the kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire.\r\n      Beyond that line, the dukes or republics of Amalfi 5 and Naples,\r\n      who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced in\r\n      the neighborhood of their lawful sovereign; and Amalfi was\r\n      enriched by supplying Europe with the produce and manufactures of\r\n      Asia. But the Lombard princes of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, 6\r\n      were reluctantly torn from the communion of the Latin world, and\r\n      too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute. The city\r\n      of Bari rose to dignity and wealth, as the metropolis of the new\r\n      theme or province of Lombardy: the title of patrician, and\r\n      afterwards the singular name of Catapan, 7 was assigned to the\r\n      supreme governor; and the policy both of the church and state was\r\n      modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople.\r\n      As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy,\r\n      their efforts were feeble and adverse; and the Greeks resisted or\r\n      eluded the forces of Germany, which descended from the Alps under\r\n      the Imperial standard of the Othos. The first and greatest of\r\n      those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the siege of\r\n      Bari: the second, after the loss of his stoutest bishops and\r\n      barons, escaped with honor from the bloody field of Crotona. On\r\n      that day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by the\r\n      valor of the Saracens. 8 These corsairs had indeed been driven by\r\n      the Byzantine fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but\r\n      a sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or\r\n      resentment, and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty\r\n      thousand Moslems to the aid of his Christian ally. The successors\r\n      of Basil amused themselves with the belief, that the conquest of\r\n      Lombardy had been achieved, and was still preserved by the\r\n      justice of their laws, the virtues of their ministers, and the\r\n      gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and\r\n      oppression. A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into\r\n      the palace of Constantinople; and the illusions of flattery were\r\n      dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman\r\n      adventurers.\r\n\r\n      5 (return) [ See an excellent Dissertation de Republica\r\n      Amalphitana, in the Appendix (p. 1-42) of Henry Brencman’s\r\n      Historia Pandectarum, (Trajecti ad Rhenum, 1722, in 4to.)]\r\n\r\n      6 (return) [ Your master, says Nicephorus, has given aid and\r\n      protection prinminibus Capuano et Beneventano, servis meis, quos\r\n      oppugnare dispono....

At the former period,\r\n      the coast of Great Greece (as it was then styled) was planted\r\n      with free and opulent cities: these cities were peopled with\r\n      soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the military strength of\r\n      Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to that of a\r\n      powerful kingdom. At the second aera, these once flourishing\r\n      provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny,\r\n      and depopulated by Barbarian war; nor can we severely accuse the\r\n      exaggeration of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district\r\n      was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth\r\n      after the general deluge. 9 Among the hostilities of the Arabs,\r\n      the Franks, and the Greeks, in the southern Italy, I shall select\r\n      two or three anecdotes expressive of their national manners. 1.\r\n      It was the amusement of the Saracens to profane, as well as to\r\n      pillage, the monasteries and churches. At the siege of Salerno, a\r\n      Mussulman chief spread his couch on the communion-table, and on\r\n      that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a Christian\r\n      nun. As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the roof was\r\n      accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the\r\n      death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ,\r\n      which was at length awakened to the defence of his faithful\r\n      spouse. 10 2. The Saracens besieged the cities of Beneventum and\r\n      Capua: after a vain appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the\r\n      Lombards implored the clemency and aid of the Greek emperor. 11 A\r\n      fearless citizen dropped from the walls, passed the\r\n      intrenchments, accomplished his commission, and fell into the\r\n      hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the welcome\r\n      news. They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive\r\n      his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honors should\r\n      be the reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be\r\n      punished with immediate death. He affected to yield, but as soon\r\n      as he was conducted within hearing of the Christians on the\r\n      rampart, “Friends and brethren,” he cried with a loud voice, “be\r\n      bold and patient, maintain the city; your sovereign is informed\r\n      of your distress, and your deliverers are at hand. I know my\r\n      doom, and commit my wife and children to your gratitude.” The\r\n      rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence; and the self-devoted\r\n      patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears. He deserves to\r\n      live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the\r\n      same story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts\r\n      on the reality of this generous deed. 12 3. The recital of a\r\n      third incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war.\r\n      Theobald, marquis of Camerino and Spoleto, 13 supported the\r\n      rebels of Beneventum; and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible\r\n      in that age with the character of a hero. His captives of the\r\n      Greek nation or party were castrated without mercy, and the\r\n      outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished to present\r\n      the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious ornaments\r\n      of the Byzantine court. The garrison of a castle had been\r\n      defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the\r\n      customary operation. But the sacrifice was disturbed by the\r\n      intrusion of a frantic female, who, with bleeding cheeks\r\n      dishevelled hair, and importunate clamors, compelled the marquis\r\n      to listen to her complaint. “Is it thus,” she cried, “ye\r\n      magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war against women, against women\r\n      who have never injured ye, and whose only arms are the distaff\r\n      and the loom?” Theobald denied the charge, and protested that,\r\n      since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war. “And how,”\r\n      she furiously exclaimed, “can you attack us more directly, how\r\n      can you wound us in a more vital part, than by robbing our\r\n      husbands of what we most dearly cherish, the source of our joys,\r\n      and the hope of our posterity? The plunder of our flocks and\r\n      herds I have endured without a murmur, but this fatal injury,\r\n      this irreparable loss, subdues my patience, and calls aloud on\r\n      the justice of heaven and earth.” A general laugh applauded her\r\n      eloquence; the savage Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by\r\n      her ridiculous, yet rational despair; and with the deliverance of\r\n      the captives, she obtained the restitution of her effects. As she\r\n      returned in triumph to the castle, she was overtaken by a\r\n      messenger, to inquire, in the name of Theobald, what punishment\r\n      should be inflicted on her husband, were he again taken in arms.\r\n      “Should such,” she answered without hesitation, “be his guilt and\r\n      misfortune, he has eyes, and a nose, and hands, and feet. These\r\n      are his own, and these he may deserve to forfeit by his personal\r\n      offences.

After a long\r\n      indulgence of rapine and slaughter, a fair and ample territory\r\n      was accepted, occupied, and named, by the Normans of France: they\r\n      renounced their gods for the God of the Christians; 16 and the\r\n      dukes of Normandy acknowledged themselves the vassals of the\r\n      successors of Charlemagne and Capet. The savage fierceness which\r\n      they had brought from the snowy mountains of Norway was refined,\r\n      without being corrupted, in a warmer climate; the companions of\r\n      Rollo insensibly mingled with the natives; they imbibed the\r\n      manners, language, 17 and gallantry, of the French nation; and in\r\n      a martial age, the Normans might claim the palm of valor and\r\n      glorious achievements. Of the fashionable superstitions, they\r\n      embraced with ardor the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the Holy\r\n      Land. 171 In this active devotion, the minds and bodies were\r\n      invigorated by exercise: danger was the incentive, novelty the\r\n      recompense; and the prospect of the world was decorated by\r\n      wonder, credulity, and ambitious hope. They confederated for\r\n      their mutual defence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been\r\n      allured by the garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm\r\n      of a warrior. In one of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount\r\n      Garganus in Apulia, which had been sanctified by the apparition\r\n      of the archangel Michael, 18 they were accosted by a stranger in\r\n      the Greek habit, but who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a\r\n      fugitive, and a mortal foe of the Greek empire. His name was\r\n      Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after an unsuccessful revolt,\r\n      was compelled to seek new allies and avengers of his country. The\r\n      bold appearance of the Normans revived his hopes and solicited\r\n      his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and still more\r\n      to the promises, of the patriot. The assurance of wealth\r\n      demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the\r\n      inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed\r\n      by effeminate tyrants. On their return to Normandy, they kindled\r\n      a spark of enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely\r\n      associated for the deliverance of Apulia. They passed the Alps by\r\n      separate roads, and in the disguise of pilgrims; but in the\r\n      neighborhood of Rome they were saluted by the chief of Bari, who\r\n      supplied the more indigent with arms and horses, and instantly\r\n      led them to the field of action. In the first conflict, their\r\n      valor prevailed; but in the second engagement they were\r\n      overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks,\r\n      and indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy. 1811 The\r\n      unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of\r\n      Germany: his Norman followers, excluded from their native and\r\n      their promised land, wandered among the hills and valleys of\r\n      Italy, and earned their daily subsistence by the sword. To that\r\n      formidable sword the princes of Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and\r\n      Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic quarrels; the\r\n      superior spirit and discipline of the Normans gave victory to the\r\n      side which they espoused; and their cautious policy observed the\r\n      balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state\r\n      should render their aid less important, and their service less\r\n      profitable. Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of\r\n      the marshes of Campania: but they were soon endowed by the\r\n      liberality of the duke of Naples with a more plentiful and\r\n      permanent seat. Eight miles from his residence, as a bulwark\r\n      against Capua, the town of Aversa was built and fortified for\r\n      their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and fruits, the\r\n      meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The report of their\r\n      success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers:\r\n      the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope;\r\n      and the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of\r\n      ease and ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa\r\n      afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the\r\n      province, to every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or\r\n      justice of his superiors; and these foreign associates were\r\n      quickly assimilated in manners and language to the Gallic colony.\r\n      The first leader of the Normans was Count Rainulf; and, in the\r\n      origin of society, preeminence of rank is the reward and the\r\n      proof of superior merit. 19 1911\r\n\r\n      15 (return) [ The original monuments of the Normans in Italy are\r\n      collected in the vth volume of Muratori; and among these we may\r\n      distinguish the poems of William Appulus (p. 245-278) and the\r\n      history of Galfridus (Jeffrey) Malaterra, (p. 537-607.)

They had been masters of it a few years when\r\n      Pandulf IV., prince of Capua, found means to take Naples by\r\n      surprise.

It was then that he confirmed the Normans in\r\n      the possession of Aversa and its territory, which he raised into\r\n      a count’s fief, and granted the investiture to Rainulf. Hist. des\r\n      Rep. Ital. tom. i. p. 267]\r\n\r\n      Since the conquest of Sicily by the Arabs, the Grecian emperors\r\n      had been anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their\r\n      efforts, however strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and\r\n      the sea. Their costly armaments, after a gleam of success, added\r\n      new pages of calamity and disgrace to the Byzantine annals:\r\n      twenty thousand of their best troops were lost in a single\r\n      expedition; and the victorious Moslems derided the policy of a\r\n      nation which intrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of their\r\n      women, but with the command of their men 20 After a reign of two\r\n      hundred years, the Saracens were ruined by their divisions. 21\r\n      The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the\r\n      people rose against the emir; the cities were usurped by the\r\n      chiefs; each meaner rebel was independent in his village or\r\n      castle; and the weaker of two rival brothers implored the\r\n      friendship of the Christians. In every service of danger the\r\n      Normans were prompt and useful; and five hundred knights, or\r\n      warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent and\r\n      interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces,\r\n      governor of Lombardy. Before their landing, the brothers were\r\n      reconciled; the union of Sicily and Africa was restored; and the\r\n      island was guarded to the water’s edge. The Normans led the van\r\n      and the Arabs of Messina felt the valor of an untried foe. In a\r\n      second action the emir of Syracuse was unhorsed and transpierced\r\n      by the iron arm of William of Hauteville. In a third engagement,\r\n      his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty thousand\r\n      Saracens, and left the Greeks no more than the labor of the\r\n      pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the\r\n      historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans. It\r\n      is, however, true, that they essentially promoted the success of\r\n      Maniaces, who reduced thirteen cities, and the greater part of\r\n      Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor. But his military fame\r\n      was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny. In the division of the\r\n      spoils, the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and\r\n      neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious\r\n      treatment. They complained by the mouth of their interpreter:\r\n      their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter was scourged;\r\n      the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment belonged to\r\n      those whose sentiments he had delivered. Yet they dissembled till\r\n      they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the Italian\r\n      continent: their brethren of Aversa sympathized in their\r\n      indignation, and the province of Apulia was invaded as the\r\n      forfeit of the debt. 22 Above twenty years after the first\r\n      emigration, the Normans took the field with no more than seven\r\n      hundred horse and five hundred foot; and after the recall of the\r\n      Byzantine legions 23 from the Sicilian war, their numbers are\r\n      magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men. Their herald\r\n      proposed the option of battle or retreat; “of battle,” was the\r\n      unanimous cry of the Normans; and one of their stoutest warriors,\r\n      with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the\r\n      Greek messenger. He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult\r\n      was concealed from the Imperial troops; but in two successive\r\n      battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their\r\n      adversaries. In the plains of Cannae, the Asiatics fled before\r\n      the adventurers of France; the duke of Lombardy was made\r\n      prisoner; the Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion; and the four\r\n      places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were alone\r\n      saved in the shipwreck of the Grecian fortunes. From this aera we\r\n      may date the establishment of the Norman power, which soon\r\n      eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa. Twelve counts 24 were\r\n      chosen by the popular suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were\r\n      the motives of their choice. The tributes of their peculiar\r\n      districts were appropriated to their use; and each count erected\r\n      a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his\r\n      vassals. In the centre of the province, the common habitation of\r\n      Melphi was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the\r\n      republic; a house and separate quarter was allotted to each of\r\n      the twelve counts: and the national concerns were regulated by\r\n      this military senate. The first of his peers, their president and\r\n      general, was entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was\r\n      conferred on William of the iron arm, who, in the language of the\r\n      age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an angel\r\n      in council. 25 The manners of his countrymen are fairly\r\n      delineated by a contemporary and national historian. 26 “The\r\n      Normans,” says Malaterra, “are a cunning and revengeful people;\r\n      eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their hereditary\r\n      qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are curbed\r\n      by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness of\r\n      nature and passion. Their princes affect the praises of popular\r\n      munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blond the\r\n      extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst\r\n      of wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and\r\n      hope whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress,\r\n      the exercises of hunting and hawking 27 are the delight of the\r\n      Normans; but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with\r\n      incredible patience the inclemency of every climate, and the toil\r\n      and absence of a military life.” 28\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ Liutprand, in Legatione, p. 485.

But the firmest title of these adventurers was\r\n      the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were\r\n      neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was\r\n      mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with\r\n      hatred and resentment. Every object of desire, a horse, a woman,\r\n      a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the\r\n      strangers; 29 and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by\r\n      the more specious names of ambition and glory. The twelve counts\r\n      were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their\r\n      domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the\r\n      virtues of William were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his\r\n      brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valor,\r\n      than to restrain the violence, of his peers. Under the reign of\r\n      Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of\r\n      the Byzantine court, attempted to relieve Italy from this\r\n      adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; 30\r\n      and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with\r\n      the most lofty titles 31 and the most ample commission. The\r\n      memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he\r\n      had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt\r\n      of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury. It\r\n      was the design of Constantine to transplant the warlike colony\r\n      from the Italian provinces to the Persian war; and the son of\r\n      Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of\r\n      Greece, as the first-fruits of the Imperial bounty. But his arts\r\n      were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia:\r\n      his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they\r\n      unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their\r\n      hopes for the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune. After the\r\n      means of persuasion had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to\r\n      destroy: the Latin powers were solicited against the common\r\n      enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the\r\n      two emperors of the East and West. The throne of St. Peter was\r\n      occupied by Leo the Ninth, a simple saint, 32 of a temper most\r\n      apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable\r\n      character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures\r\n      least compatible with the practice of religion. His humanity was\r\n      affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured\r\n      people: the impious Normans had interrupted the payment of\r\n      tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed\r\n      against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures\r\n      of the church. As a German of noble birth and royal kindred, Leo\r\n      had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor Henry\r\n      the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal\r\n      transported him from Apulia to Saxony, from the Elbe to the\r\n      Tyber. During these hostile preparations, Argyrus indulged\r\n      himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of\r\n      Normans became the victims of public or private revenge; and the\r\n      valiant Drogo was murdered in a church. But his spirit survived\r\n      in his brother Humphrey, the third count of Apulia. The assassins\r\n      were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was\r\n      driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the walls of\r\n      Bari, and to await the tardy succor of his allies.\r\n\r\n      29 (return) [ The biographer of St. Leo IX. pours his holy venom\r\n      on the Normans.

The\r\n      public and private history of that pope is diligently treated by\r\n      M. de St. Marc. (Abrege, tom. ii. p. 140-210, and p. 25-95,\r\n      second column.)]\r\n\r\n      But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war; the\r\n      mind of Henry was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of\r\n      repassing the Alps with a German army, was accompanied only by a\r\n      guard of seven hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine.\r\n      In his long progress from Mantua to Beneventum, a vile and\r\n      promiscuous multitude of Italians was enlisted under the holy\r\n      standard: 33 the priest and the robber slept in the same tent;\r\n      the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the\r\n      martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of\r\n      march, of encampment, and of combat. The Normans of Apulia could\r\n      muster in the field no more than three thousand horse, with a\r\n      handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted\r\n      their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of\r\n      fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe. On the\r\n      hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or\r\n      reluctance before their spiritual father. But the pope was\r\n      inexorable; his lofty Germans affected to deride the diminutive\r\n      stature of their adversaries; and the Normans were informed that\r\n      death or exile was their only alternative. Flight they disdained,\r\n      and, as many of them had been three days without tasting food,\r\n      they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honorable death.\r\n      They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and\r\n      charged in three divisions the army of the pope. On the left, and\r\n      in the centre, Richard count of Aversa, and Robert the famous\r\n      Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the Italian\r\n      multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without\r\n      shame. A harder trial was reserved for the valor of Count\r\n      Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing. The Germans 34\r\n      have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse\r\n      and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable\r\n      phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armor, could resist the\r\n      weight of their long and two-handed swords. After a severe\r\n      conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from\r\n      the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes,\r\n      and the satisfaction of revenge. The gates of Civitella were shut\r\n      against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious\r\n      conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the\r\n      absolution of their sinful victory. The soldiers beheld in their\r\n      enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose\r\n      the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected\r\n      by the popular superstition. In the calm of retirement, the\r\n      well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of Christian blood, which\r\n      must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the\r\n      author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the\r\n      indecency of his military character was universally condemned. 35\r\n      With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a\r\n      beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as\r\n      the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of\r\n      the Normans. By whatever hands they had been usurped, the\r\n      provinces of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the donation of\r\n      Constantine and the patrimony of St. Peter: the grant and the\r\n      acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the\r\n      adventurers. They promised to support each other with spiritual\r\n      and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of twelve pence was\r\n      afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this\r\n      memorable transaction, the kingdom of Naples has remained above\r\n      seven hundred years a fief of the Holy See. 36\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ See the expedition of Leo XI. against the Normans.\r\n      See William Appulus (l. ii. p. 259-261) and Jeffrey Malaterra (l.\r\n      i. c. 13, 14, 15, p. 253.)

Yet he vainly\r\n      strives to reconcile the duties of patriot and Catholic, adopts\r\n      an empty distinction of “Ecclesia Romana non dedit, sed accepit,”\r\n      and shrinks from an honest but dangerous confession of the\r\n      truth.]\r\n\r\n      The pedigree of Robert of Guiscard 37 is variously deduced from\r\n      the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the\r\n      pride and ignorance of a Grecian princess; 38 from the dukes, by\r\n      the ignorance and flattery of the Italian subjects. 39 His\r\n      genuine descent may be ascribed to the second or middle order of\r\n      private nobility. 40 He sprang from a race of valvassors or\r\n      bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy:\r\n      the castle of Hauteville was their honorable seat: his father\r\n      Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and\r\n      his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or knights.\r\n      Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the\r\n      father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the impartial\r\n      tenderness of his second wife. But a narrow patrimony was\r\n      insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw\r\n      around the neighborhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and\r\n      resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance. Two\r\n      only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father’s\r\n      age: their ten brothers, as they successfully attained the vigor\r\n      of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined\r\n      the Apulian camp of the Normans. The elder were prompted by\r\n      native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren,\r\n      and the three first in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey,\r\n      deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the\r\n      new republic. Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the\r\n      second marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has\r\n      endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a\r\n      statesman. His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army:\r\n      his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and\r\n      gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the\r\n      patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form.\r\n      His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and\r\n      beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with\r\n      fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress\r\n      obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder\r\n      ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of\r\n      the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once,\r\n      and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his\r\n      sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he\r\n      was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day\r\n      he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the\r\n      warriors of the two armies. 41 His boundless ambition was founded\r\n      on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of\r\n      greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and\r\n      seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible\r\n      of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined\r\n      only by his present advantage. The surname of Guiscard 42 was\r\n      applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often\r\n      confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and\r\n      Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning\r\n      of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were\r\n      disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest\r\n      fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers;\r\n      and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he\r\n      affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion\r\n      of his country. He grasped with a rapacious, that he might\r\n      distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had\r\n      taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not\r\n      below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow\r\n      and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret\r\n      treasure. According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with\r\n      only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even\r\n      this allowance appears too bountiful: the sixth son of Tancred of\r\n      Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military\r\n      band was levied among the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and\r\n      countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they\r\n      guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring\r\n      youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in\r\n      his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives, it is not\r\n      easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise a\r\n      castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the\r\n      adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors\r\n      which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body. The\r\n      volunteers of Normandy adhered to his standard; and, under his\r\n      command, the peasants of Calabria assumed the name and character\r\n      of Normans.\r\n\r\n      37 (return) [ The birth, character, and first actions of Robert\r\n      Guiscard, may be found in Jeffrey Malaterra, (l. i. c. 3, 4, 11,\r\n      16, 17, 18, 38, 39, 40,) William Appulus, (l. ii. p. 260-262,)\r\n      William Gemeticensis, or of Jumieges, (l. xi. c. 30, p. 663, 664,\r\n      edit.

It is no bad translation of the surname and\r\n      character of Robert.]\r\n\r\n      As the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune, he awakened\r\n      the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient\r\n      quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.\r\n      After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded\r\n      them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by\r\n      the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and Guiscard was\r\n      exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of Apulia and general of\r\n      the republic. With an increase of authority and of force, he\r\n      resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that\r\n      should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.\r\n\r\n      By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal\r\n      excommunication; but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded\r\n      that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their\r\n      mutual prejudice; that the Normans were the faithful champions of\r\n      the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince\r\n      than the caprice of an aristocracy. A synod of one hundred\r\n      bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an\r\n      important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees\r\n      of the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy conferred on\r\n      Robert and his posterity the ducal title, 43 with the investiture\r\n      of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in Italy and Sicily,\r\n      which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the\r\n      unbelieving Saracens. 44 This apostolic sanction might justify\r\n      his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could\r\n      not be transferred without their consent; and Guiscard dissembled\r\n      his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by\r\n      the conquest of Consenza and Reggio. In the hour of triumph, he\r\n      assembled his troops, and solicited the Normans to confirm by\r\n      their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: the soldiers\r\n      hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the\r\n      counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with\r\n      hollow smiles and secret indignation. After this inauguration,\r\n      Robert styled himself, “By the grace of God and St. Peter, duke\r\n      of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;” and it was the\r\n      labor of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty\r\n      appellations. Such sardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem\r\n      unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the\r\n      nation; but the Normans were few in number; their resources were\r\n      scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious. The bravest\r\n      designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of\r\n      his parliament of barons: the twelve counts of popular election\r\n      conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious\r\n      uncle, the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge. By his\r\n      policy and vigor, Guiscard discovered their plots, suppressed\r\n      their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile:\r\n      but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national\r\n      strength, were unprofitably consumed. After the defeat of his\r\n      foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken\r\n      forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the\r\n      sea-coast. They excelled in the arts of fortification and\r\n      defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the\r\n      field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts\r\n      of persevering courage. The resistance of Salerno was maintained\r\n      above eight months; the siege or blockade of Bari lasted near\r\n      four years. In these actions the Norman duke was the foremost in\r\n      every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient. As he\r\n      pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart\r\n      shattered one of his military engines; and by a splinter he was\r\n      wounded in the breast. Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a\r\n      miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched\r\n      with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the\r\n      inclemency of the winter and the spears of the enemy. 45\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ The acquisition of the ducal title by Robert\r\n      Guiscard is a nice and obscure business.

Three districts only were\r\n      exempted from the common law of subjection; the first forever,\r\n      the two last till the middle of the succeeding century. The city\r\n      and immediate territory of Benevento had been transferred, by\r\n      gift or exchange, from the German emperor to the Roman pontiff;\r\n      and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of\r\n      St. Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.\r\n      Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held the state of Capua;\r\n      and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace\r\n      of their fathers.

But the savage and the sage must\r\n      alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are\r\n      inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be\r\n      more frequent in the ruder ages of society. The treasures of\r\n      Grecian medicine had been communicated to the Arabian colonies of\r\n      Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and\r\n      war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at\r\n      Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and\r\n      the women beautiful. 49 A school, the first that arose in the\r\n      darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the\r\n      conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary\r\n      and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most\r\n      eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the\r\n      physicians of Salerno. They were protected by the Norman\r\n      conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the\r\n      merit and value of a philosopher. After a pilgrimage of\r\n      thirty-nine years, Constantine, an African Christian, returned\r\n      from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the\r\n      Arabians; and Salerno was enriched by the practice, the lessons,\r\n      and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna. The school of medicine\r\n      has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are\r\n      abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the Leonine\r\n      verses, or Latin rhymes, of the twelfth century. 50 II. Seven\r\n      miles to the west of Salerno, and thirty to the south of Naples,\r\n      the obscure town of Amalphi displayed the power and rewards of\r\n      industry. The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but\r\n      the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants first assumed\r\n      the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures\r\n      and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the\r\n      source of their opulence and freedom. The government was popular,\r\n      under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek\r\n      emperor. Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of\r\n      Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold,\r\n      silver, and the objects of precious luxury. The mariners who\r\n      swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of\r\n      navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which\r\n      has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good\r\n      fortune. Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to\r\n      the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their\r\n      settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and\r\n      Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies. 51\r\n      After three hundred years of prosperity, Amalphi was oppressed by\r\n      the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but\r\n      the poverty of one thousand 5111 fisherman is yet dignified by\r\n      the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal\r\n      merchants.\r\n\r\n      46 (return) [ The conquests of Robert Guiscard and Roger I., the\r\n      exemption of Benevento and the xii provinces of the kingdom, are\r\n      fairly exposed by Giannone in the second volume of his Istoria\r\n      Civile, l. ix. x. xi and l. xvii. p. 460-470.

He accepted\r\n      the welcome summons; hastened to the Apulian camp; and deserved\r\n      at first the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder\r\n      brother. Their valor and ambition were equal; but the youth, the\r\n      beauty, the elegant manners, of Roger engaged the disinterested\r\n      love of the soldiers and people. So scanty was his allowance for\r\n      himself and forty followers, that he descended from conquest to\r\n      robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were\r\n      the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his\r\n      special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable\r\n      at Melphi. 52 His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from\r\n      these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy\r\n      war; and the invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zeal and\r\n      policy of his brother Guiscard. After the retreat of the Greeks,\r\n      the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had\r\n      retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of\r\n      the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the Eastern\r\n      empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.\r\n      53 In the first attempt, Roger braved, in an open boat, the real\r\n      and fabulous dangers of Scylla and Charybdis; landed with only\r\n      sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the Saracens to the\r\n      gates of Messina and safely returned with the spoils of the\r\n      adjacent country. In the fortress of Trani, his active and\r\n      patient courage were equally conspicuous. In his old age he\r\n      related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege,\r\n      himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single\r\n      cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his\r\n      horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens;\r\n      but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated\r\n      with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be\r\n      left in the hands of the miscreants. In the siege of Trani, three\r\n      hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.\r\n      In the field of Ceramio, fifty thousand horse and foot were\r\n      overthrown by one hundred and thirty-six Christian soldiers,\r\n      without reckoning St. George, who fought on horseback in the\r\n      foremost ranks. The captive banners, with four camels, were\r\n      reserved for the successor of St. Peter; and had these barbaric\r\n      spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they\r\n      might have revived the memory of the Punic triumphs. These\r\n      insufficient numbers of the Normans most probably denote their\r\n      knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of\r\n      whom was attended by five or six followers in the field; 54 yet,\r\n      with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair\r\n      allowance on the side of valor, arms, and reputation, the\r\n      discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to\r\n      the alternative of a miracle or a fable. The Arabs of Sicily\r\n      derived a frequent and powerful succor from their countrymen of\r\n      Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the Norman cavalry was assisted\r\n      by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of\r\n      the two brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible\r\n      emulation. After a war of thirty years, 55 Roger, with the title\r\n      of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most\r\n      fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration\r\n      displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his\r\n      age and education. The Moslems were maintained in the free\r\n      enjoyment of their religion and property: 56 a philosopher and\r\n      physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the\r\n      conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the seven\r\n      climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent\r\n      perusal, preferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the\r\n      Grecian Ptolemy. 57 A remnant of Christian natives had promoted\r\n      the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of\r\n      the cross. The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the\r\n      Roman pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities;\r\n      and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches\r\n      and monasteries. Yet the Catholic hero asserted the rights of the\r\n      civil magistrate. Instead of resigning the investiture of\r\n      benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal\r\n      claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by\r\n      the singular bull, which declares the princes of Sicily\r\n      hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See. 58\r\n\r\n      52 (return) [ Latrocinio armigerorum suorum in multis\r\n      sustentabatur, quod quidem ad ejus ignominiam non dicimus; sed\r\n      ipso ita praecipiente adhuc viliora et reprehensibiliora dicturi\r\n      sumus ut pluribus patescat, quam laboriose et cum quanta angustia\r\n      a profunda paupertate ad summum culmen divitiarum vel honoris\r\n      attigerit.

The second wife\r\n      of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the\r\n      Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger;\r\n      their five daughters were given in honorable nuptials, 60 and one\r\n      of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a\r\n      beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael. 61 But\r\n      the throne of Constantinople was shaken by a revolution: the\r\n      Imperial family of Ducas was confined to the palace or the\r\n      cloister; and Robert deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his\r\n      daughter and the expulsion of his ally. A Greek, who styled\r\n      himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and\r\n      related the adventures of his fall and flight. That unfortunate\r\n      friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp\r\n      and titles of Imperial dignity: in his triumphal progress through\r\n      Apulia and Calabria, Michael 62 was saluted with the tears and\r\n      acclamations of the people; and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted\r\n      the bishops to preach, and the Catholics to fight, in the pious\r\n      work of his restoration. His conversations with Robert were\r\n      frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified\r\n      by the valor of the Normans and the treasures of the East. Yet\r\n      this Michael, by the confession of the Greeks and Latins, was a\r\n      pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or\r\n      a domestic who had served in the palace. The fraud had been\r\n      contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this\r\n      pretender had given a decent color to his arms, he would sink, at\r\n      the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity. But\r\n      victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of\r\n      the Greeks; and the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to\r\n      their credulity: the Norman veterans wished to enjoy the harvest\r\n      of their toils, and the unwarlike Italians trembled at the known\r\n      and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition. In his new\r\n      levies, Robert exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the\r\n      terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of\r\n      violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were\r\n      pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting\r\n      prince. After two years’ incessant preparations the land and\r\n      naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme\r\n      promontory, of Italy; and Robert was accompanied by his wife, who\r\n      fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of\r\n      the emperor Michael. Thirteen hundred knights 63 of Norman race\r\n      or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be\r\n      swelled to thirty thousand 64 followers of every denomination.\r\n      The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers,\r\n      covered with raw hides, were embarked on board one hundred and\r\n      fifty vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of\r\n      Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the\r\n      republic of Ragusa.\r\n\r\n      59 (return) [ In the first expedition of Robert against the\r\n      Greeks, I follow Anna Comnena, (the ist, iiid, ivth, and vth\r\n      books of the Alexiad,) William Appulus, (l. ivth and vth, p.\r\n      270-275,) and Jeffrey Malaterra, (l. iii. c. 13, 14, 24-29, 39.)\r\n      Their information is contemporary and authentic, but none of them\r\n      were eye-witnesses of the war.]\r\n\r\n      60 (return) [ One of them was married to Hugh, the son of Azzo,\r\n      or Axo, a marquis of Lombardy, rich, powerful, and noble,\r\n      (Gulielm.

The space between Brundusium and\r\n      Durazzo, the Roman passage, is no more than one hundred miles; 65\r\n      at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; 66 and\r\n      this narrow distance had suggested to Pyrrhus and Pompey the\r\n      sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge. Before the general\r\n      embarkation, the Norman duke despatched Bohemond with fifteen\r\n      galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the\r\n      opposite coast, and to secure a harbor in the neighborhood of\r\n      Vallona for the landing of the troops. They passed and landed\r\n      without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment\r\n      displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.\r\n      The islands of Epirus and the maritime towns were subdued by the\r\n      arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from Corfu\r\n      (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo. That\r\n      city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient\r\n      renown, and recent fortifications, by George Palaeologus, a\r\n      patrician, victorious in the Oriental wars, and a numerous\r\n      garrison of Albanians and Macedonians, who, in every age, have\r\n      maintained the character of soldiers. In the prosecution of his\r\n      enterprise, the courage of Guiscard was assailed by every form of\r\n      danger and mischance. In the most propitious season of the year,\r\n      as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow\r\n      unexpectedly arose: the Adriatic was swelled by the raging blast\r\n      of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the\r\n      Acroceraunian rocks. 67 The sails, the masts, and the oars, were\r\n      shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the\r\n      fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest\r\n      part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged. The ducal\r\n      galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and Robert halted\r\n      seven days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his\r\n      loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers. The\r\n      Normans were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had\r\n      explored the ocean from Greenland to Mount Atlas, and who smiled\r\n      at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean. They had wept during\r\n      the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the\r\n      Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of\r\n      the Byzantine court. The first day’s action was not\r\n      disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, 68 who led the\r\n      naval powers of his father. All night the galleys of the republic\r\n      lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory\r\n      of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their\r\n      evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their\r\n      javelins, and the borrowed aid of the Greek fire. The Apulian and\r\n      Ragusian vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their\r\n      cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the\r\n      town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the Norman\r\n      duke. A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as\r\n      the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and\r\n      maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and\r\n      provision. That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential\r\n      disease; five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death;\r\n      and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial)\r\n      amounted to ten thousand persons. Under these calamities, the\r\n      mind of Guiscard alone was firm and invincible; and while he\r\n      collected new forces from Apulia and Sicily, he battered, or\r\n      scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo. But his industry and\r\n      valor were encountered by equal valor and more perfect industry.\r\n      A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain five hundred\r\n      soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart:\r\n      but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an\r\n      enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed\r\n      by artificial flames.\r\n\r\n      65 (return) [ The Itinerary of Jerusalem (p. 609, edit.\r\n      Wesseling) gives a true and reasonable space of a thousand stadia\r\n      or one hundred miles which is strangely doubled by Strabo (l. vi.\r\n      p. 433) and Pliny, (Hist.

(Duncanga ad\r\n      Alexiad. p. 283.)]\r\n\r\n      While the Roman empire was attacked by the Turks in the East,\r\n      east, and the Normans in the West, the aged successor of Michael\r\n      surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious\r\n      captain, and the founder of the Comnenian dynasty. The princess\r\n      Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected\r\n      style, that even Hercules was unequal to a double combat; and, on\r\n      this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which\r\n      allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.\r\n      On his accession, Alexius found the camp without soldiers, and\r\n      the treasury without money; yet such were the vigor and activity\r\n      of his measures, that in six months he assembled an army of\r\n      seventy thousand men, 69 and performed a march of five hundred\r\n      miles. His troops were levied in Europe and Asia, from\r\n      Peloponnesus to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the\r\n      silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards;\r\n      and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes,\r\n      some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the\r\n      purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of\r\n      affluence and dignity. Their youthful ardor might animate the\r\n      multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of\r\n      subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their\r\n      importunate clamors for speedy and decisive action disconcerted\r\n      the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved\r\n      the besieging army. The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad\r\n      comparison of the past and present limits of the Roman world: the\r\n      raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the\r\n      garrisons of Anatolia, or Asia Minor, had been purchased by the\r\n      evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the\r\n      Turks. The strength of the Greek army consisted in the\r\n      Varangians, the Scandinavian guards, whose numbers were recently\r\n      augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British\r\n      Island of Thule. Under the yoke of the Norman conqueror, the\r\n      Danes and English were oppressed and united; a band of\r\n      adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea\r\n      was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they\r\n      visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and\r\n      revenge. They were entertained in the service of the Greek\r\n      emperor; and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic\r\n      shore: but Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his\r\n      person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the\r\n      inheritance of their faith and valor. 70 The name of a Norman\r\n      invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with\r\n      alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in Epirus\r\n      the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings. The\r\n      Varangians were supported by some companies of Franks or Latins;\r\n      and the rebels, who had fled to Constantinople from the tyranny\r\n      of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their\r\n      revenge. In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the\r\n      impure aid of the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and\r\n      Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of\r\n      martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valor. 71 The\r\n      treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand\r\n      Turks; and the arrows of the Scythian horse were opposed to the\r\n      lances of the Norman cavalry. On the report and distant prospect\r\n      of these formidable numbers, Robert assembled a council of his\r\n      principal officers. “You behold,” said he, “your danger: it is\r\n      urgent and inevitable. The hills are covered with arms and\r\n      standards; and the emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars\r\n      and triumphs. Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am\r\n      ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.” The vote and\r\n      acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that\r\n      perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke\r\n      thus continued: “Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and\r\n      deprive cowardice of the means of escape. Let us burn our vessels\r\n      and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the\r\n      place of our nativity and our burial.” The resolution was\r\n      unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his\r\n      lines, Guiscard awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of\r\n      the enemy. His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing\r\n      extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious,\r\n      perhaps, that on the same ground Caesar and Pompey had formerly\r\n      disputed the empire of the world. 72\r\n\r\n      69 (return) [ Muratori (Annali d’ Italia, tom. ix. p. 136, 137)\r\n      observes, that some authors (Petrus Diacon.

Guichard) did not live to analyze these\r\n      operations, as he has done the campaigns of Africa and Spain.]\r\n\r\n      Against the advice of his wisest captains, Alexius resolved to\r\n      risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of\r\n      Durazzo to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally\r\n      from the town. He marched in two columns to surprise the Normans\r\n      before daybreak on two different sides: his light cavalry was\r\n      scattered over the plain; the archers formed the second line; and\r\n      the Varangians claimed the honors of the vanguard. In the first\r\n      onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody\r\n      impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to\r\n      fifteen thousand men. The Lombards and Calabrians ignominiously\r\n      turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but\r\n      the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the\r\n      garrison, and the coast was lined with the Venetian galleys, who\r\n      played their engines among the disorderly throng. On the verge of\r\n      ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.\r\n      Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the Greeks as a warlike\r\n      Amazon, a second Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less\r\n      terrible in arms, than the Athenian goddess: 73 though wounded by\r\n      an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation\r\n      and example, to rally the flying troops. 74 Her female voice was\r\n      seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the Norman duke,\r\n      as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: “Whither,” he\r\n      cried aloud, “whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and\r\n      death is less grievous than servitude.” The moment was decisive:\r\n      as the Varangians advanced before the line, they discovered the\r\n      nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight\r\n      hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their\r\n      lances, and the Greeks bore the furious and irresistible shock of\r\n      the French cavalry. 75 Alexius was not deficient in the duties of\r\n      a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of\r\n      the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his\r\n      subjects, and despaired of his fortune. The princess Anne, who\r\n      drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the\r\n      strength and swiftness of her father’s horse, and his vigorous\r\n      struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance,\r\n      which had shivered the Imperial helmet. His desperate valor broke\r\n      through a squadron of Franks who opposed his flight; and after\r\n      wandering two days and as many nights in the mountains, he found\r\n      some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of\r\n      Lychnidus. The victorious Robert reproached the tardy and feeble\r\n      pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize:\r\n      but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards\r\n      of the field, the wealth and luxury of the Byzantine camp, and\r\n      the glory of defeating an army five times more numerous than his\r\n      own. A multitude of Italians had been the victims of their own\r\n      fears; but only thirty of his knights were slain in this\r\n      memorable day. In the Roman host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and\r\n      English, amounted to five or six thousand: 76 the plain of\r\n      Durazzo was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of\r\n      the impostor Michael was more honorable than his life.\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ It is very properly translated by the President\r\n      Cousin, (Hist. de Constantinople, tom. iv. p. 131, in 12mo.,) qui\r\n      combattoit comme une Pallas, quoiqu’elle ne fut pas aussi savante\r\n      que celle d’Athenes.

After their defeat, they still persevered\r\n      in the defence of Durazzo; and a Venetian commander supplied the\r\n      place of George Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away\r\n      from his station. The tents of the besiegers were converted into\r\n      barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer\r\n      to the defiance of the garrison, Robert insinuated, that his\r\n      patience was at least equal to their obstinacy. 77 Perhaps he\r\n      already trusted to his secret correspondence with a Venetian\r\n      noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage. At\r\n      the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the\r\n      walls; the light Calabrians ascended in silence; and the Greeks\r\n      were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror. Yet they\r\n      defended the streets three days against an enemy already master\r\n      of the rampart; and near seven months elapsed between the first\r\n      investment and the final surrender of the place. From Durazzo,\r\n      the Norman duke advanced into the heart of Epirus or Albania;\r\n      traversed the first mountains of Thessaly; surprised three\r\n      hundred English in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica;\r\n      and made Constantinople tremble. A more pressing duty suspended\r\n      the prosecution of his ambitious designs. By shipwreck,\r\n      pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a third of the\r\n      original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he\r\n      was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers\r\n      which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities\r\n      and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach\r\n      or invasion of Henry king of Germany. Highly presuming that his\r\n      person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea\r\n      in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under\r\n      the command of his son and the Norman counts, exhorting Bohemond\r\n      to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the\r\n      authority of their leader. The son of Guiscard trod in the\r\n      footsteps of his father; and the two destroyers are compared, by\r\n      the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom\r\n      devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former. 78 After\r\n      winning two battles against the emperor, he descended into the\r\n      plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of\r\n      Achilles, 79 which contained the treasure and magazines of the\r\n      Byzantine camp. Yet a just praise must not be refused to the\r\n      fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the\r\n      calamities of the times. In the poverty of the state, he presumed\r\n      to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the\r\n      desertion of the Manichaeans was supplied by some tribes of\r\n      Moldavia: a reenforcement of seven thousand Turks replaced and\r\n      revenged the loss of their brethren; and the Greek soldiers were\r\n      exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of\r\n      ambuscades and evolutions. Alexius had been taught by experience,\r\n      that the formidable cavalry of the Franks on foot was unfit for\r\n      action, and almost incapable of motion; 80 his archers were\r\n      directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man;\r\n      and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground\r\n      on which he might expect an attack. In the neighborhood of\r\n      Larissa the events of war were protracted and balanced. The\r\n      courage of Bohemond was always conspicuous, and often successful;\r\n      but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city\r\n      was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted\r\n      his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service\r\n      of the emperor. Alexius returned to Constantinople with the\r\n      advantage, rather than the honor, of victory. After evacuating\r\n      the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of\r\n      Guiscard embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who\r\n      esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.\r\n\r\n      77 (return) [ The Romans had changed the inauspicious name of\r\n      Epidamnus to Dyrrachium, (Plin. iii. 26;) and the vulgar\r\n      corruption of Duracium (see Malaterra) bore some affinity to\r\n      hardness.

The epistle of the Greek monarch 81 to his brother is\r\n      filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most\r\n      lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and\r\n      private tie. He congratulates Henry on his success in a just and\r\n      pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is\r\n      disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the Norman Robert. The\r\n      lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age—a radiated\r\n      crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a\r\n      case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase\r\n      of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of\r\n      Mecca, and one hundred pieces of purple. To these he added a more\r\n      solid present, of one hundred and forty-four thousand Byzantines\r\n      of gold, with a further assurance of two hundred and sixteen\r\n      thousand, so soon as Henry should have entered in arms the\r\n      Apulian territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against\r\n      the common enemy. The German, 82 who was already in Lombardy at\r\n      the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers,\r\n      and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound\r\n      of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name,\r\n      in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the\r\n      Grecian bribe. Henry was the severe adversary of the Normans, the\r\n      allies and vassals of Gregory the Seventh, his implacable foe.\r\n      The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently\r\n      kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: 83 the\r\n      king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a\r\n      rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.\r\n      After the defeat and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended\r\n      into Italy, to assume the Imperial crown, and to drive from the\r\n      Vatican the tyrant of the church. 84 But the Roman people adhered\r\n      to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by\r\n      supplies of men and money from Apulia; and the city was thrice\r\n      ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany. In the fourth year\r\n      he corrupted, as it is said, with Byzantine gold, the nobles of\r\n      Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war. The\r\n      gates, the bridges, and fifty hostages, were delivered into his\r\n      hands: the anti-pope, Clement the Third, was consecrated in the\r\n      Lateran: the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the\r\n      Vatican; and the emperor Henry fixed his residence in the\r\n      Capitol, as the lawful successor of Augustus and Charlemagne. The\r\n      ruins of the Septizonium were still defended by the nephew of\r\n      Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.\r\n      Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his\r\n      Norman vassal. Their friendship had been interrupted by some\r\n      reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing\r\n      occasion, Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his oath, by\r\n      his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and\r\n      his enmity to the two emperors. Unfurling the holy banner, he\r\n      resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the\r\n      most numerous of his armies, six thousand horse, and thirty\r\n      thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from\r\n      Salerno to Rome was animated by the public applause and the\r\n      promise of the divine favor. Henry, invincible in sixty-six\r\n      battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable\r\n      affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the\r\n      Romans to persevere in their allegiance; and hastily retreated\r\n      three days before the entrance of the Normans. In less than three\r\n      years, the son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of\r\n      delivering the pope, and of compelling the two emperors, of the\r\n      East and West, to fly before his victorious arms. 85 But the\r\n      triumph of Robert was clouded by the calamities of Rome. By the\r\n      aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or\r\n      scaled; but the Imperial faction was still powerful and active;\r\n      on the third day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a\r\n      hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the\r\n      signal of fire and pillage. 86 The Saracens of Sicily, the\r\n      subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this\r\n      fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the\r\n      Christians: many thousands of the citizens, in the sight, and by\r\n      the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation,\r\n      captivity, or death; and a spacious quarter of the city, from the\r\n      Lateran to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted\r\n      to perpetual solitude. 87 From a city, where he was now hated,\r\n      and might be no longer feared, Gregory retired to end his days in\r\n      the palace of Salerno. The artful pontiff might flatter the\r\n      vanity of Guiscard with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown;\r\n      but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the\r\n      ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most\r\n      faithful princes of Germany.\r\n\r\n      81 (return) [ The epistle itself (Alexias, l. iii. p. 93, 94, 95)\r\n      well deserves to be read.

The zeal or gratitude of Gregory had\r\n      promised to his valor the kingdoms of Greece and Asia; 88 his\r\n      troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager\r\n      for action. Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared\r\n      by Anna to a swarm of bees; 89 yet the utmost and moderate limits\r\n      of the powers of Guiscard have been already defined; they were\r\n      contained on this second occasion in one hundred and twenty\r\n      vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbor of\r\n      Brundusium 90 was preferred to the open road of Otranto. Alexius,\r\n      apprehensive of a second attack, had assiduously labored to\r\n      restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the\r\n      republic of Venice an important succor of thirty-six transports,\r\n      fourteen galleys, and nine galiots or ships of extra-ordinary\r\n      strength and magnitude. Their services were liberally paid by the\r\n      license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and\r\n      houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St. Mark,\r\n      the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their\r\n      rivals at Amalphi. By the union of the Greeks and Venetians, the\r\n      Adriatic was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect,\r\n      or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter\r\n      of a mist, opened a free passage; and the Norman troops were\r\n      safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus. With twenty strong and\r\n      well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought\r\n      the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he\r\n      trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and two sons,\r\n      to the event of a naval combat. The dominion of the sea was\r\n      disputed in three engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in\r\n      the two former, the skill and numbers of the allies were\r\n      superior; but in the third, the Normans obtained a final and\r\n      complete victory. 91 The light brigantines of the Greeks were\r\n      scattered in ignominious flight: the nine castles of the\r\n      Venetians maintained a more obstinate conflict; seven were sunk,\r\n      two were taken; two thousand five hundred captives implored in\r\n      vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of Alexius\r\n      deplores the loss of thirteen thousand of his subjects or allies.\r\n      The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of\r\n      Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he\r\n      calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new\r\n      methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the\r\n      advantages of the enemy. The winter season suspended his\r\n      progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the\r\n      conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills\r\n      of Epirus, he turned his arms against Greece and the islands,\r\n      where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and\r\n      sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigor and\r\n      effect. But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally\r\n      blasted by an epidemical disease: Robert himself, in the\r\n      seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion\r\n      of poison was imputed, by public rumor, to his wife, or to the\r\n      Greek emperor. 92 This premature death might allow a boundless\r\n      scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event\r\n      sufficiently declares, that the Norman greatness was founded on\r\n      his life. 93 Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious\r\n      army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and\r\n      Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his\r\n      deliverance. The galley which transported the remains of Guiscard\r\n      was ship-wrecked on the Italian shore; but the duke’s body was\r\n      recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of\r\n      Venusia, 94 a place more illustrious for the birth of Horace 95\r\n      than for the burial of the Norman heroes. Roger, his second son\r\n      and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke\r\n      of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the\r\n      valiant Bohemond to the inheritance of his sword.\r\n\r\n      The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the\r\n      first crusade against the infidels of the East opened a more\r\n      splendid field of glory and conquest. 96\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ The royalty of Robert, either promised or bestowed\r\n      by the pope, (Anna, l. i. p. 32,) is sufficiently confirmed by\r\n      the Apulian, (l. iv. p. 270.) —Romani regni sibi promisisse\r\n      coronam Papa ferebatur.

The male line of Robert\r\n      Guiscard was extinguished, both in Apulia and at Antioch, in the\r\n      second generation; but his younger brother became the father of a\r\n      line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with\r\n      the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the first Roger. 97\r\n      The heir of that Norman adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at\r\n      the age of only four years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of\r\n      the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for\r\n      a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion. Had\r\n      Roger been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and\r\n      grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a\r\n      wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of\r\n      the Greek colonies, 98 the opulence and power of Sicily alone\r\n      might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and\r\n      desolated by the sword of war. But the ambition of the great\r\n      count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by\r\n      the vulgar means of violence and artifice. He sought to obtain\r\n      the undivided possession of Palermo, of which one moiety had been\r\n      ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his Calabrian\r\n      limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently\r\n      watched the declining health of his cousin William of Apulia, the\r\n      grandson of Robert. On the first intelligence of his premature\r\n      death, Roger sailed from Palermo with seven galleys, cast anchor\r\n      in the Bay of Salerno, received, after ten days’ negotiation, an\r\n      oath of fidelity from the Norman capital, commanded the\r\n      submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from\r\n      the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the\r\n      friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal. The sacred spot of\r\n      Benevento was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St. Peter;\r\n      but the reduction of Capua and Naples completed the design of his\r\n      uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the Norman conquests\r\n      was possessed by the victorious Roger. A conscious superiority of\r\n      power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of\r\n      count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a third perhaps of the\r\n      continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom 99 which\r\n      would only yield to the monarchies of France and England. The\r\n      chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at Palermo might\r\n      doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them;\r\n      but the example of a Greek tyrant or a Saracen emir was\r\n      insufficient to justify his regal character; and the nine kings\r\n      of the Latin world 100 might disclaim their new associate, unless\r\n      he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff. The\r\n      pride of Anacletus was pleased to confer a title, which the pride\r\n      of the Norman had stooped to solicit; 101 but his own legitimacy\r\n      was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and\r\n      while Anacletus sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was\r\n      acknowledged by the nations of Europe. The infant monarchy of\r\n      Roger was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of\r\n      an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of Lothaire the Second of\r\n      Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa,\r\n      and the zeal of St. Bernard, were united for the ruin of the\r\n      Sicilian robber. After a gallant resistance, the Norman prince\r\n      was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of Apulia was\r\n      invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held one end\r\n      of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted\r\n      their right, and suspended their quarrel. But such jealous\r\n      friendship was of short and precarious duration: the German\r\n      armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: 102 the Apulian\r\n      duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who\r\n      seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his\r\n      predecessor Leo the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff\r\n      became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their\r\n      reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who\r\n      now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.\r\n\r\n      97 (return) [ The reign of Roger, and the Norman kings of Sicily,\r\n      fills books of the Istoria Civile of Giannone, (tom. ii. l.\r\n      xi.-xiv. p. 136-340,) and is spread over the ixth and xth volumes\r\n      of the Italian Annals of Muratori.

The recent injuries of Sicily might\r\n      provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the\r\n      Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject\r\n      streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval\r\n      trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength\r\n      they contended with the decline of an African power. When the\r\n      Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded\r\n      the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a\r\n      gift of his royal mantle, and forty Arabian horses, his palace\r\n      with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms\r\n      of Tunis and Algiers. The Zeirides, 103 the descendants of\r\n      Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant\r\n      benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and\r\n      after running the little course of an Oriental dynasty, were now\r\n      fainting in their own weakness. On the side of the land, they\r\n      were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco,\r\n      while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the Greeks and\r\n      Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had\r\n      extorted a ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold. By the\r\n      first arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been\r\n      since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was\r\n      inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily. Tripoli, 104 a strong\r\n      and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the\r\n      slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be\r\n      justified by the frequent practice of the Moslems themselves. The\r\n      capital of the Zeirides was named Africa from the country, and\r\n      Mahadia 105 from the Arabian founder: it is strongly built on a\r\n      neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbor is not\r\n      compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain. Mahadia was\r\n      besieged by George the Sicilian admiral, with a fleet of one\r\n      hundred and fifty galleys, amply provided with men and the\r\n      instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the Moorish\r\n      governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and\r\n      irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the Moslem\r\n      inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the\r\n      rapacious Franks. In successive expeditions, the king of Sicily\r\n      or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia,\r\n      Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; 106 the fortresses were\r\n      garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held\r\n      Africa in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the\r\n      sword of Roger. 107 After his death, that sword was broken; and\r\n      these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost,\r\n      under the troubled reign of his successor. 108 The triumphs of\r\n      Scipio and Belisarius have proved, that the African continent is\r\n      neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and\r\n      powers of Christendom have repeatedly failed in their armaments\r\n      against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and\r\n      long servitude of Spain.\r\n\r\n      103 (return) [ See De Guignes, Hist.

The policy of Roger solicited a public\r\n      and private union with the Greek princes, whose alliance would\r\n      dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter\r\n      of the Comnenian family, and the first steps of the treaty seemed\r\n      to promise a favorable event. But the contemptuous treatment of\r\n      his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and\r\n      the insolence of the Byzantine court was expiated, according to\r\n      the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people. 109\r\n      With the fleet of seventy galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily,\r\n      appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were\r\n      delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had\r\n      yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a\r\n      tribute. In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of\r\n      commerce, the Normans spread themselves by sea, and over the\r\n      provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and\r\n      Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty. Of the wrongs of\r\n      Athens, no memorial remains. The ancient walls, which\r\n      encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were\r\n      scaled by the Latin Christians; but their sole use of the gospel\r\n      was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted\r\n      any relic of their inheritance or industry. On the approach of\r\n      the Normans, the lower town of Corinth was evacuated; the Greeks\r\n      retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence,\r\n      abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an\r\n      impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by\r\n      any advantages of art or nature. As soon as the besiegers had\r\n      surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill,\r\n      their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own\r\n      victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from\r\n      the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint. The\r\n      silk weavers of both sexes, whom George transported to Sicily,\r\n      composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing\r\n      the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice\r\n      of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom\r\n      were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable of using. The\r\n      progress of this naval armament was marked by two conspicuous\r\n      events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the\r\n      Byzantine capital. In his return by sea from an unfortunate\r\n      crusade, Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks, who\r\n      basely violated the laws of honor and religion. The fortunate\r\n      encounter of the Norman fleet delivered the royal captive; and\r\n      after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily,\r\n      Louis continued his journey to Rome and Paris. 110 In the absence\r\n      of the emperor, Constantinople and the Hellespont were left\r\n      without defence and without the suspicion of danger. The clergy\r\n      and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel)\r\n      were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line\r\n      of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the Imperial\r\n      city. The forces of the Sicilian admiral were inadequate to the\r\n      siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but\r\n      George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek arrogance, and of\r\n      marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West. He landed\r\n      some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and\r\n      pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which\r\n      he discharged against the palace of the Caesars. 111 This playful\r\n      outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded\r\n      moment, Manuel affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and\r\n      the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge. The\r\n      Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and\r\n      those of Venice; but I know not by what favorable allowance of\r\n      transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our\r\n      fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of fifteen\r\n      hundred vessels, which is proposed by a Byzantine historian.\r\n      These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his\r\n      homeward voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys, which were\r\n      separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, Corfu implored\r\n      the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a\r\n      soldier, of the Norman prince, be found, unless as a captive,\r\n      within the limits of the Eastern empire. The prosperity and the\r\n      health of Roger were already in a declining state: while he\r\n      listened in his palace of Palermo to the messengers of victory or\r\n      defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was\r\n      celebrated by the Greeks and Latins as the Alexander or the\r\n      Hercules of the age.\r\n\r\n      109 (return) [ The silence of the Sicilian historians, who end\r\n      too soon, or begin too late, must be supplied by Otho of\r\n      Frisingen, a German, (de Gestis Frederici I. l. i. c. 33, in\r\n      Muratori, Script. tom. vi. p. 668,) the Venetian Andrew Dandulus,\r\n      (Id. tom. xii. p. 282, 283) and the Greek writers Cinnamus (l.\r\n      iii. c. 2-5) and Nicetas, (in Manuel. l. iii. c. 1-6.)]\r\n\r\n      110 (return) [ To this imperfect capture and speedy rescue I\r\n      apply Cinnamus, l. ii. c. 19, p. 49.

It was the right and duty,\r\n      it might be the interest and glory, of Manuel to restore the\r\n      ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of Italy\r\n      and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of\r\n      a Norman vassal. 112 The natives of Calabria were still attached\r\n      to the Greek language and worship, which had been inexorably\r\n      proscribed by the Latin clergy: after the loss of her dukes,\r\n      Apulia was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily;\r\n      the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death\r\n      had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his\r\n      subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the\r\n      seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of Roger himself invited the\r\n      enemies of his family and nation. The majesty of the purple, and\r\n      a series of Hungarian and Turkish wars, prevented Manuel from\r\n      embarking his person in the Italian expedition. To the brave and\r\n      noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the Greek monarch intrusted a\r\n      fleet and army: the siege of Bari was his first exploit; and, in\r\n      every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of\r\n      victory. Salerno, and some places along the western coast,\r\n      maintained their fidelity to the Norman king; but he lost in two\r\n      campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and\r\n      the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was\r\n      content with the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of\r\n      Apulia and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all\r\n      the walls of the palace. The prejudices of the Latins were\r\n      gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of\r\n      the German Caesars; 113 but the successor of Constantine soon\r\n      renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible\r\n      dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the\r\n      Barbarians beyond the Alps. By the artful speeches, liberal\r\n      gifts, and unbounded promises, of their Eastern ally, the free\r\n      cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle\r\n      against the despotism of Frederic Barbarossa: the walls of Milan\r\n      were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says\r\n      the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose\r\n      attachment to the Greeks was fortified by the jealous enmity of\r\n      the Venetians. 114 The situation and trade of Ancona rendered it\r\n      an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice\r\n      besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice\r\n      repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by\r\n      the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots,\r\n      the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and\r\n      honors of the Byzantine court. 115 The pride of Manuel disdained\r\n      and rejected a Barbarian colleague; his ambition was excited by\r\n      the hope of stripping the purple from the German usurpers, and of\r\n      establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of\r\n      sole emperor of the Romans. With this view, he solicited the\r\n      alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome. Several of the\r\n      nobles embraced the cause of the Greek monarch; the splendid\r\n      nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of\r\n      that powerful family, 116 and his royal standard or image was\r\n      entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis. 117\r\n      During the quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the Third, the\r\n      pope twice received in the Vatican the ambassadors of\r\n      Constantinople. They flattered his piety by the long-promised\r\n      union of the two churches, tempted the avarice of his venal\r\n      court, and exhorted the Roman pontiff to seize the just\r\n      provocation, the favorable moment, to humble the savage insolence\r\n      of the Alemanni and to acknowledge the true representative of\r\n      Constantine and Augustus. 118\r\n\r\n      112 (return) [ For the invasion of Italy, which is almost\r\n      overlooked by Nicetas see the more polite history of Cinnamus,\r\n      (l. iv. c. 1-15, p. 78-101,) who introduces a diffuse narrative\r\n      by a lofty profession, iii. 5.]\r\n\r\n      113 (return) [ The Latin, Otho, (de Gestis Frederici I. l. ii. c.\r\n      30, p. 734,) attests the forgery; the Greek, Cinnamus, (l. iv. c.\r\n      1, p. 78,) claims a promise of restitution from Conrad and\r\n      Frederic.

His second embassy was accompanied cum\r\n      immensa multitudine pecuniarum.]\r\n\r\n      But these Italian conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped\r\n      from the hand of the Greek emperor. His first demands were eluded\r\n      by the prudence of Alexander the Third, who paused on this deep\r\n      and momentous revolution; 119 nor could the pope be seduced by a\r\n      personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the\r\n      Latin name. After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more\r\n      peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors,\r\n      excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final\r\n      separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of\r\n      Constantinople and Rome. 120 The free cities of Lombardy no\r\n      longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without\r\n      preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity\r\n      of Venice. 121 By his own avarice, or the complaints of his\r\n      subjects, the Greek emperor was provoked to arrest the persons,\r\n      and confiscate the effects, of the Venetian merchants. This\r\n      violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial\r\n      people: one hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many\r\n      days; they swept the coasts of Dalmatia and Greece: but after\r\n      some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement,\r\n      inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a\r\n      complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved\r\n      for the succeeding generation. The lieutenant of Manuel had\r\n      informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any\r\n      domestic revolt of Apulia and Calabria; but that his forces were\r\n      inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.\r\n      His prophecy was soon verified: the death of Palaeologus devolved\r\n      the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike\r\n      defective in military talents; the Greeks were oppressed by land\r\n      and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the\r\n      Normans and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the\r\n      person or dominions of their conqueror. 122 Yet the king of\r\n      Sicily esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had\r\n      landed a second army on the Italian shore; he respectfully\r\n      addressed the new Justinian; solicited a peace or truce of thirty\r\n      years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged\r\n      himself the military vassal of the Roman empire. 123 The\r\n      Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without\r\n      expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a Norman\r\n      army; and the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any\r\n      hostilities between Sicily and Constantinople. About the end of\r\n      that period, the throne of Manuel was usurped by an inhuman\r\n      tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and\r\n      mankind: the sword of William the Second, the grandson of Roger,\r\n      was drawn by a fugitive of the Comnenian race; and the subjects\r\n      of Andronicus might salute the strangers as friends, since they\r\n      detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies. The Latin\r\n      historians 124 expatiate on the rapid progress of the four counts\r\n      who invaded Romania with a fleet and army, and reduced many\r\n      castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily. The\r\n      Greeks 125 accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious\r\n      cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the\r\n      second city of the empire. The former deplore the fate of those\r\n      invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the\r\n      arts of a vanquished foe. The latter applaud, in songs of\r\n      triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of\r\n      Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the\r\n      walls of Durazzo. A revolution which punished the crimes of\r\n      Andronicus, had united against the Franks the zeal and courage of\r\n      the successful insurgents: ten thousand were slain in battle, and\r\n      Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or\r\n      vengeance in the treatment of four thousand captives. Such was\r\n      the event of the last contest between the Greeks and Normans:\r\n      before the expiration of twenty years, the rival nations were\r\n      lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of\r\n      Constantine did not long survive to insult the fall of the\r\n      Sicilian monarchy.\r\n\r\n      119 (return) [ Nimis alta et perplexa sunt, (Vit.

When he was roused to arms by\r\n      danger and shame, the first William did not degenerate from the\r\n      valor of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were\r\n      dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the\r\n      monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for\r\n      those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and\r\n      conspired against the life, of his benefactor. From the Arabian\r\n      conquest, Sicily had imbibed a deep tincture of Oriental manners;\r\n      the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a\r\n      Christian people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of\r\n      the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the\r\n      religion of Mahomet. An eloquent historian of the times 126 has\r\n      delineated the misfortunes of his country: 127 the ambition and\r\n      fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his\r\n      assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself;\r\n      the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the\r\n      various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo,\r\n      the island, and the continent, during the reign of William the\r\n      First, and the minority of his son. The youth, innocence, and\r\n      beauty of William the Second, 128 endeared him to the nation: the\r\n      factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the\r\n      manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, Sicily\r\n      enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose\r\n      value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread\r\n      of futurity. The legitimate male posterity of Tancred of\r\n      Hauteville was extinct in the person of the second William; but\r\n      his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful\r\n      prince of the age; and Henry the Sixth, the son of Frederic\r\n      Barbarossa, descended from the Alps to claim the Imperial crown\r\n      and the inheritance of his wife. Against the unanimous wish of a\r\n      free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and\r\n      I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian\r\n      Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the\r\n      feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.\r\n      “Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in\r\n      the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners,\r\n      of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the\r\n      Barbarians with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage\r\n      allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.\r\n      Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent\r\n      cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with\r\n      fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by\r\n      intemperance and lust. I see the massacre or captivity of our\r\n      citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons. 129 In this\r\n      extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the Sicilians act?\r\n      By the unanimous election of a king of valor and experience,\r\n      Sicily and Calabria might yet be preserved; 130 for in the levity\r\n      of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose\r\n      neither confidence nor hope. 131 Should Calabria be lost, the\r\n      lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of\r\n      Messina, 132 might guard the passage against a foreign invader.\r\n      If the savage Germans coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if\r\n      they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by\r\n      the fires of Mount Aetna, 133 what resource will be left for the\r\n      interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should\r\n      never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? 134\r\n      Catana has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient\r\n      virtue of Syracuse expires in poverty and solitude; 135 but\r\n      Palermo is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls\r\n      enclose the active multitudes of Christians and Saracens. If the\r\n      two nations, under one king, can unite for their common safety,\r\n      they may rush on the Barbarians with invincible arms. But if the\r\n      Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire\r\n      and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and\r\n      sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double\r\n      attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil,\r\n      must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.” 136\r\n      We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his\r\n      religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were\r\n      still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.\r\n\r\n      126 (return) [ The Historia Sicula of Hugo Falcandus, which\r\n      properly extends from 1154 to 1169, is inserted in the viiith\r\n      volume of Muratori’s Collection, (tom. vii. p. 259-344,) and\r\n      preceded by a eloquent preface or epistle, (p. 251-258, de\r\n      Calamitatibus Siciliae.) Falcandus has been styled the Tacitus of\r\n      Sicily; and, after a just, but immense, abatement, from the ist\r\n      to the xiith century, from a senator to a monk, I would not strip\r\n      him of his title: his narrative is rapid and perspicuous, his\r\n      style bold and elegant, his observation keen; he had studied\r\n      mankind, and feels like a man.

Yet Falcandus has all the feelings of\r\n      a Sicilian; and the title of Alumnus (which he bestows on\r\n      himself) appears to indicate that he was born, or at least\r\n      educated, in the island.]\r\n\r\n      128 (return) [ Falcand. p. 303.

During\r\n      four years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on\r\n      the farthest verge of the Apulian frontier, against the powers of\r\n      Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of Constantia\r\n      herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most\r\n      liberal measure of policy or reason. After his decease, the\r\n      kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and\r\n      Henry pursued his victorious march from Capua to Palermo. The\r\n      political balance of Italy was destroyed by his success; and if\r\n      the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real\r\n      interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven\r\n      to prevent the dangerous union of the German empire with the\r\n      kingdom of Sicily. But the subtle policy, for which the Vatican\r\n      has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion\r\n      blind and inactive; and if it were true that Celestine the Third\r\n      had kicked away the Imperial crown from the head of the prostrate\r\n      Henry, 137 such an act of impotent pride could serve only to\r\n      cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy. The Genoese, who\r\n      enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened\r\n      to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure:\r\n      138 their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the\r\n      harbor of Palermo; and the first act of his government was to\r\n      abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these\r\n      imprudent allies. The last hope of Falcandus was defeated by the\r\n      discord of the Christians and Mahometans: they fought in the\r\n      capital; several thousands of the latter were slain; but their\r\n      surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above\r\n      thirty years the peace of the island. By the policy of Frederic\r\n      the Second, sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to Nocera\r\n      in Apulia. In their wars against the Roman church, the emperor\r\n      and his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the\r\n      service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony\r\n      maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till\r\n      they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by\r\n      the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou. 139 All the\r\n      calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed\r\n      by the cruelty and avarice of the German conqueror. He violated\r\n      the royal sepulchres, 1391 and explored the secret treasures of\r\n      the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and\r\n      jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but one\r\n      hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of\r\n      Sicily. 140 The young king, his mother and sisters, and the\r\n      nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses\r\n      of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumor of rebellion, the\r\n      captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of\r\n      posterity. Constantia herself was touched with sympathy for the\r\n      miseries of her country; and the heiress of the Norman line might\r\n      struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony\r\n      of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age\r\n      under the name of Frederic the Second. Ten years after this\r\n      revolution, the French monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy\r\n      of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been\r\n      transmitted, by a granddaughter of William the Conqueror, to the\r\n      house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised\r\n      so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia,\r\n      Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude,\r\n      among the vanquished nations.\r\n\r\n      137 (return) [ The testimony of an Englishman, of Roger de\r\n      Hoveden, (p. 689,) will lightly weigh against the silence of\r\n      German and Italian history, (Muratori, Annali d’ Italia, tom. x.\r\n      p. 156.)

Their\r\n      Scythian empire of the sixth century was long since dissolved;\r\n      but the name was still famous among the Greeks and Orientals; and\r\n      the fragments of the nation, each a powerful and independent\r\n      people, were scattered over the desert from China to the Oxus and\r\n      the Danube: the colony of Hungarians was admitted into the\r\n      republic of Europe, and the thrones of Asia were occupied by\r\n      slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction. While Apulia and\r\n      Sicily were subdued by the Norman lance, a swarm of these\r\n      northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia; their\r\n      princes of the race of Seljuk erected a splendid and solid empire\r\n      from Samarcand to the confines of Greece and Egypt; and the Turks\r\n      have maintained their dominion in Asia Minor, till the victorious\r\n      crescent has been planted on the dome of St. Sophia.\r\n\r\n      One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud,\r\n      1 the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia,\r\n      one thousand years after the birth of Christ. His father\r\n      Sebectagi was the slave of the slave of the slave of the\r\n      commander of the faithful. But in this descent of servitude, the\r\n      first degree was merely titular, since it was filled by the\r\n      sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan, who still paid a nominal\r\n      allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad. The second rank was that of a\r\n      minister of state, a lieutenant of the Samanides, 2 who broke, by\r\n      his revolt, the bonds of political slavery. But the third step\r\n      was a state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that\r\n      rebel; from which Sebectagi, by his courage and dexterity,\r\n      ascended to the supreme command of the city and provinces of\r\n      Gazna, 3 as the son-in-law and successor of his grateful master.\r\n\r\n      The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected, and\r\n      at last overthrown, by their servants; and, in the public\r\n      disorders, the fortune of Mahmud continually increased. From him\r\n      the title of Sultan 4 was first invented; and his kingdom was\r\n      enlarged from Transoxiana to the neighborhood of Ispahan, from\r\n      the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of the Indus. But the\r\n      principal source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he\r\n      waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan. In this foreign narrative\r\n      I may not consume a page; and a volume would scarcely suffice to\r\n      recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions.\r\n      Never was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the\r\n      seasons, the height of the mountains, the breadth of the rivers,\r\n      the barrenness of the desert, the multitudes of the enemy, or the\r\n      formidable array of their elephants of war. 5 The sultan of Gazna\r\n      surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander: after a march\r\n      of three months, over the hills of Cashmir and Thibet, he reached\r\n      the famous city of Kinnoge, 6 on the Upper Ganges; and, in a\r\n      naval combat on one of the branches of the Indus, he fought and\r\n      vanquished four thousand boats of the natives. Delhi, Lahor, and\r\n      Multan, were compelled to open their gates: the fertile kingdom\r\n      of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay; and his\r\n      avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden\r\n      and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean. On the payment of a\r\n      tribute, the rajahs preserved their dominions; the people, their\r\n      lives and fortunes; but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous\r\n      Mussulman was cruel and inexorable: many hundred temples, or\r\n      pagodas, were levelled with the ground; many thousand idols were\r\n      demolished; and the servants of the prophet were stimulated and\r\n      rewarded by the precious materials of which they were composed.\r\n      The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the promontory of Guzarat, in\r\n      the neighborhood of Diu, one of the last remaining possessions of\r\n      the Portuguese. 7 It was endowed with the revenue of two thousand\r\n      villages; two thousand Brahmins were consecrated to the service\r\n      of the Deity, whom they washed each morning and evening in water\r\n      from the distant Ganges: the subordinate ministers consisted of\r\n      three hundred musicians, three hundred barbers, and five hundred\r\n      dancing girls, conspicuous for their birth or beauty. Three sides\r\n      of the temple were protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was\r\n      fortified by a natural or artificial precipice; and the city and\r\n      adjacent country were peopled by a nation of fanatics. They\r\n      confessed the sins and the punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi; but\r\n      if the impious stranger should presume to approach their holy\r\n      precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed by a blast of the\r\n      divine vengeance. By this challenge, the faith of Mahmud was\r\n      animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian\r\n      deity. Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the\r\n      spear of the Moslems; the walls were scaled; the sanctuary was\r\n      profaned; and the conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the\r\n      head of the idol. The trembling Brahmins are said to have offered\r\n      ten millions 711 sterling for his ransom; and it was urged by the\r\n      wisest counsellors, that the destruction of a stone image would\r\n      not change the hearts of the Gentoos; and that such a sum might\r\n      be dedicated to the relief of the true believers. “Your reasons,”\r\n      replied the sultan, “are specious and strong; but never in the\r\n      eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant of idols.”\r\n      712 He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and rubies,\r\n      concealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree\r\n      the devout prodigality of the Brahmins. The fragments of the idol\r\n      were distributed to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina. Bagdad listened to\r\n      the edifying tale; and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the\r\n      title of guardian of the fortune and faith of Mahomet.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ I am indebted for his character and history to\r\n      D’Herbelot, (Bibliotheque Orientale, Mahmud, p. 533-537,) M.

The name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in\r\n      the East: his subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and\r\n      peace; his vices were concealed by the veil of religion; and two\r\n      familiar examples will testify his justice and magnanimity.\r\n\r\n      I. As he sat in the Divan, an unhappy subject bowed before the\r\n      throne to accuse the insolence of a Turkish soldier who had\r\n      driven him from his house and bed. “Suspend your clamors,” said\r\n      Mahmud; “inform me of his next visit, and ourself in person will\r\n      judge and punish the offender.” The sultan followed his guide,\r\n      invested the house with his guards, and extinguishing the\r\n      torches, pronounced the death of the criminal, who had been\r\n      seized in the act of rapine and adultery. After the execution of\r\n      his sentence, the lights were rekindled, Mahmud fell prostrate in\r\n      prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some homely fare,\r\n      which he devoured with the voraciousness of hunger. The poor man,\r\n      whose injury he had avenged, was unable to suppress his\r\n      astonishment and curiosity; and the courteous monarch\r\n      condescended to explain the motives of this singular behavior. “I\r\n      had reason to suspect that none, except one of my sons, could\r\n      dare to perpetrate such an outrage; and I extinguished the\r\n      lights, that my justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer\r\n      was a thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender; and so\r\n      painful was my anxiety, that I had passed three days without food\r\n      since the first moment of your complaint.”\r\n\r\n      II. The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty of\r\n      the Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia: he was\r\n      disarmed by an epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his\r\n      invasion till the manhood of her son. 8 “During the life of my\r\n      husband,” said the artful regent, “I was ever apprehensive of\r\n      your ambition: he was a prince and a soldier worthy of your arms.\r\n      He is now no more; his sceptre has passed to a woman and a child,\r\n      and you dare not attack their infancy and weakness. How\r\n      inglorious would be your conquest, how shameful your defeat! and\r\n      yet the event of war is in the hand of the Almighty.” Avarice was\r\n      the only defect that tarnished the illustrious character of\r\n      Mahmud; and never has that passion been more richly satiated. 811\r\n      The Orientals exceed the measure of credibility in the account of\r\n      millions of gold and silver, such as the avidity of man has never\r\n      accumulated; in the magnitude of pearls, diamonds, and rubies,\r\n      such as have never been produced by the workmanship of nature. 9\r\n      Yet the soil of Hindostan is impregnated with precious minerals:\r\n      her trade, in every age, has attracted the gold and silver of the\r\n      world; and her virgin spoils were rifled by the first of the\r\n      Mahometan conquerors. His behavior, in the last days of his life,\r\n      evinces the vanity of these possessions, so laboriously won, so\r\n      dangerously held, and so inevitably lost. He surveyed the vast\r\n      and various chambers of the treasury of Gazna, burst into tears,\r\n      and again closed the doors, without bestowing any portion of the\r\n      wealth which he could no longer hope to preserve. The following\r\n      day he reviewed the state of his military force; one hundred\r\n      thousand foot, fifty-five thousand horse, and thirteen hundred\r\n      elephants of battle. 10 He again wept the instability of human\r\n      greatness; and his grief was imbittered by the hostile progress\r\n      of the Turkmans, whom he had introduced into the heart of his\r\n      Persian kingdom.\r\n\r\n      8 (return) [ D’Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 527.

In the midst of civilized nations, they\r\n      preserve the manners of the Scythian desert, remove their\r\n      encampments with a change of seasons, and feed their cattle among\r\n      the ruins of palaces and temples. Their flocks and herds are\r\n      their only riches; their tents, either black or white, according\r\n      to the color of the banner, are covered with felt, and of a\r\n      circular form; their winter apparel is a sheep-skin; a robe of\r\n      cloth or cotton their summer garment: the features of the men are\r\n      harsh and ferocious; the countenance of their women is soft and\r\n      pleasing. Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise\r\n      of arms; they fight on horseback; and their courage is displayed\r\n      in frequent contests with each other and with their neighbors.\r\n      For the license of pasture they pay a slight tribute to the\r\n      sovereign of the land; but the domestic jurisdiction is in the\r\n      hands of the chiefs and elders. The first emigration of the\r\n      Eastern Turkmans, the most ancient of the race, may be ascribed\r\n      to the tenth century of the Christian aera. 12 In the decline of\r\n      the caliphs, and the weakness of their lieutenants, the barrier\r\n      of the Jaxartes was often violated; in each invasion, after the\r\n      victory or retreat of their countrymen, some wandering tribe,\r\n      embracing the Mahometan faith, obtained a free encampment in the\r\n      spacious plains and pleasant climate of Transoxiana and Carizme.\r\n      The Turkish slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged these\r\n      emigrations which recruited their armies, awed their subjects and\r\n      rivals, and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of\r\n      Turkestan; and this policy was abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide\r\n      beyond the example of former times. He was admonished of his\r\n      error by the chief of the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in the\r\n      territory of Bochara. The sultan had inquired what supply of men\r\n      he could furnish for military service. “If you send,” replied\r\n      Ismael, “one of these arrows into our camp, fifty thousand of\r\n      your servants will mount on horseback.”—“And if that number,”\r\n      continued Mahmud, “should not be sufficient?”—“Send this second\r\n      arrow to the horde of Balik, and you will find fifty thousand\r\n      more.”—“But,” said the Gaznevide, dissembling his anxiety, “if I\r\n      should stand in need of the whole force of your kindred\r\n      tribes?”—“Despatch my bow,” was the last reply of Ismael, “and as\r\n      it is circulated around, the summons will be obeyed by two\r\n      hundred thousand horse.” The apprehension of such formidable\r\n      friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most obnoxious tribes\r\n      into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be separated from\r\n      their brethren of the River Oxus, and enclosed on all sides by\r\n      the walls of obedient cities. But the face of the country was an\r\n      object of temptation rather than terror; and the vigor of\r\n      government was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of\r\n      Gazna. The shepherds were converted into robbers; the bands of\r\n      robbers were collected into an army of conquerors: as far as\r\n      Ispahan and the Tigris, Persia was afflicted by their predatory\r\n      inroads; and the Turkmans were not ashamed or afraid to measure\r\n      their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns of Asia.\r\n      Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud, had too long neglected\r\n      the advice of his wisest Omrahs. “Your enemies,” they repeatedly\r\n      urged, “were in their origin a swarm of ants; they are now little\r\n      snakes; and, unless they be instantly crushed, they will acquire\r\n      the venom and magnitude of serpents.” After some alternatives of\r\n      truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his\r\n      lieutenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans,\r\n      who attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular\r\n      onset. “Massoud,” says the Persian historian, 13 “plunged singly\r\n      to oppose the torrent of gleaming arms, exhibiting such acts of\r\n      gigantic force and valor as never king had before displayed. A\r\n      few of his friends, roused by his words and actions, and that\r\n      innate honor which inspires the brave, seconded their lord so\r\n      well, that wheresoever he turned his fatal sword, the enemies\r\n      were mowed down, or retreated before him. But now, when victory\r\n      seemed to blow on his standard, misfortune was active behind it;\r\n      for when he looked round, be beheld almost his whole army,\r\n      excepting that body he commanded in person, devouring the paths\r\n      of flight.” The Gaznevide was abandoned by the cowardice or\r\n      treachery of some generals of Turkish race; and this memorable\r\n      day of Zendecan 14 founded in Persia the dynasty of the shepherd\r\n      kings. 15\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ See a just and natural picture of these pastoral\r\n      manners, in the history of William archbishop of Tyre, (l. i. c.\r\n      vii. in the Gesta Dei per Francos, p. 633, 634,) and a valuable\r\n      note by the editor of the Histoire Genealogique des Tatars, p.\r\n      535-538.]\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ The first emigration of the Turkmans, and doubtful\r\n      origin of the Seljukians, may be traced in the laborious History\r\n      of the Huns, by M.

A number of arrows were successively inscribed with\r\n      the name of a tribe, a family, and a candidate; they were drawn\r\n      from the bundle by the hand of a child; and the important prize\r\n      was obtained by Togrul Beg, the son of Michael the son of Seljuk,\r\n      whose surname was immortalized in the greatness of his posterity.\r\n      The sultan Mahmud, who valued himself on his skill in national\r\n      genealogy, professed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk; yet\r\n      the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and\r\n      renown. 17 For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince,\r\n      Seljuk was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his\r\n      friends and vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the\r\n      neighborhood of Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and\r\n      acquired the crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels.\r\n      His age, of a hundred and seven years, surpassed the life of his\r\n      son, and Seljuk adopted the care of his two grandsons, Togrul and\r\n      Jaafar; the eldest of whom, at the age of forty-five, was\r\n      invested with the title of Sultan, in the royal city of Nishabur.\r\n      The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues of\r\n      the successful candidate. It would be superfluous to praise the\r\n      valor of a Turk; and the ambition of Togrul 18 was equal to his\r\n      valor. By his arms, the Gasnevides were expelled from the eastern\r\n      kingdoms of Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of the\r\n      Indus, in search of a softer and more wealthy conquest. In the\r\n      West he annihilated the dynasty of the Bowides; and the sceptre\r\n      of Irak passed from the Persian to the Turkish nation. The\r\n      princes who had felt, or who feared, the Seljukian arrows, bowed\r\n      their heads in the dust; by the conquest of Aderbijan, or Media,\r\n      he approached the Roman confines; and the shepherd presumed to\r\n      despatch an ambassador, or herald, to demand the tribute and\r\n      obedience of the emperor of Constantinople. 19 In his own\r\n      dominions, Togrul was the father of his soldiers and people; by a\r\n      firm and equal administration, Persia was relieved from the evils\r\n      of anarchy; and the same hands which had been imbrued in blood\r\n      became the guardians of justice and the public peace. The more\r\n      rustic, perhaps the wisest, portion of the Turkmans 20 continued\r\n      to dwell in the tents of their ancestors; and, from the Oxus to\r\n      the Euphrates, these military colonies were protected and\r\n      propagated by their native princes. But the Turks of the court\r\n      and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure: they\r\n      imitated the dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the\r\n      royal palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order and\r\n      magnificence of a great monarchy. The most deserving of the\r\n      Arabians and Persians were promoted to the honors of the state;\r\n      and the whole body of the Turkish nation embraced, with fervor\r\n      and sincerity, the religion of Mahomet. The northern swarms of\r\n      Barbarians, who overspread both Europe and Asia, have been\r\n      irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar\r\n      conduct. Among the Moslems, as among the Christians, their vague\r\n      and local traditions have yielded to the reason and authority of\r\n      the prevailing system, to the fame of antiquity, and the consent\r\n      of nations. But the triumph of the Koran is more pure and\r\n      meritorious, as it was not assisted by any visible splendor of\r\n      worship which might allure the Pagans by some resemblance of\r\n      idolatry. The first of the Seljukian sultans was conspicuous by\r\n      his zeal and faith: each day he repeated the five prayers which\r\n      are enjoined to the true believers; of each week, the two first\r\n      days were consecrated by an extraordinary fast; and in every city\r\n      a mosch was completed, before Togrul presumed to lay the\r\n      foundations of a palace. 21\r\n\r\n      16 (return) [ Willerm.

But that sublime\r\n      character was still disputed by the caliphs of Bagdad and Egypt,\r\n      and each of the rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the\r\n      judgment of the strong, though illiterate Barbarians. Mahmud the\r\n      Gaznevide had declared himself in favor of the line of Abbas; and\r\n      had treated with indignity the robe of honor which was presented\r\n      by the Fatimite ambassador. Yet the ungrateful Hashemite had\r\n      changed with the change of fortune; he applauded the victory of\r\n      Zendecan, and named the Seljukian sultan his temporal vicegerent\r\n      over the Moslem world. As Togrul executed and enlarged this\r\n      important trust, he was called to the deliverance of the caliph\r\n      Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new kingdom to\r\n      his arms. 22 In the palace of Bagdad, the commander of the\r\n      faithful still slumbered, a venerable phantom. His servant or\r\n      master, the prince of the Bowides, could no longer protect him\r\n      from the insolence of meaner tyrants; and the Euphrates and\r\n      Tigris were oppressed by the revolt of the Turkish and Arabian\r\n      emirs. The presence of a conqueror was implored as a blessing;\r\n      and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were excused as the\r\n      sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the health\r\n      of the republic. At the head of an irresistible force, the sultan\r\n      of Persia marched from Hamadan: the proud were crushed, the\r\n      prostrate were spared; the prince of the Bowides disappeared; the\r\n      heads of the most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of\r\n      Togrul; and he inflicted a lesson of obedience on the people of\r\n      Mosul and Bagdad. After the chastisement of the guilty, and the\r\n      restoration of peace, the royal shepherd accepted the reward of\r\n      his labors; and a solemn comedy represented the triumph of\r\n      religious prejudice over Barbarian power. 23 The Turkish sultan\r\n      embarked on the Tigris, landed at the gate of Racca, and made his\r\n      public entry on horseback. At the palace-gate he respectfully\r\n      dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded by his emirs without\r\n      arms. The caliph was seated behind his black veil: the black\r\n      garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders, and he\r\n      held in his hand the staff of the apostle of God. The conqueror\r\n      of the East kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest\r\n      posture, and was led towards the throne by the vizier and\r\n      interpreter. After Togrul had seated himself on another throne,\r\n      his commission was publicly read, which declared him the temporal\r\n      lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet. He was successively\r\n      invested with seven robes of honor, and presented with seven\r\n      slaves, the natives of the seven climates of the Arabian empire.\r\n      His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; two crowns 231 were\r\n      placed on his head; two cimeters were girded to his side, as the\r\n      symbols of a double reign over the East and West. After this\r\n      inauguration, the sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a\r\n      second time; but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the\r\n      faithful, and his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds\r\n      and the applause of the Moslems. In a second visit to Bagdad, the\r\n      Seljukian prince again rescued the caliph from his enemies and\r\n      devoutly, on foot, led the bridle of his mule from the prison to\r\n      the palace. Their alliance was cemented by the marriage of\r\n      Togrul’s sister with the successor of the prophet. Without\r\n      reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his harem; but\r\n      Cayem proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained to\r\n      mingle the blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian\r\n      shepherd; and protracted the negotiation many months, till the\r\n      gradual diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was\r\n      still in the hands of a master. The royal nuptials were followed\r\n      by the death of Togrul himself; 24 as he left no children, his\r\n      nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title and prerogatives of\r\n      sultan; and his name, after that of the caliph, was pronounced in\r\n      the public prayers of the Moslems. Yet in this revolution, the\r\n      Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and power. On the\r\n      throne of Asia, the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of the\r\n      domestic administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the\r\n      faithful were relieved from the ignominious vexations to which\r\n      they had been exposed by the presence and poverty of the Persian\r\n      dynasty.\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ Consult the Bibliotheque Orientale, in the articles\r\n      of the Abbassides, Caher, and Caiem, and the Annals of Elmacin\r\n      and Abulpharagius.]\r\n\r\n      23 (return) [ For this curious ceremony, I am indebted to M.

Yet\r\n      the arms of Togrul did not make any deep or lasting impression on\r\n      the Greek empire. The torrent rolled away from the open country;\r\n      the sultan retired without glory or success from the siege of an\r\n      Armenian city; the obscure hostilities were continued or\r\n      suspended with a vicissitude of events; and the bravery of the\r\n      Macedonian legions renewed the fame of the conqueror of Asia. 26\r\n      The name of Alp Arslan, the valiant lion, is expressive of the\r\n      popular idea of the perfection of man; and the successor of\r\n      Togrul displayed the fierceness and generosity of the royal\r\n      animal. He passed the Euphrates at the head of the Turkish\r\n      cavalry, and entered Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia, to\r\n      which he had been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple\r\n      of St. Basil. The solid structure resisted the destroyer: but he\r\n      carried away the doors of the shrine incrusted with gold and\r\n      pearls, and profaned the relics of the tutelar saint, whose\r\n      mortal frailties were now covered by the venerable rust of\r\n      antiquity. The final conquest of Armenia and Georgia was achieved\r\n      by Alp Arslan. In Armenia, the title of a kingdom, and the spirit\r\n      of a nation, were annihilated: the artificial fortifications were\r\n      yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople; by strangers\r\n      without faith, veterans without pay or arms, and recruits without\r\n      experience or discipline. The loss of this important frontier was\r\n      the news of a day; and the Catholics were neither surprised nor\r\n      displeased, that a people so deeply infected with the Nestorian\r\n      and Eutychian errors had been delivered by Christ and his mother\r\n      into the hands of the infidels. 27 The woods and valleys of Mount\r\n      Caucasus were more strenuously defended by the native Georgians\r\n      28 or Iberians; but the Turkish sultan and his son Malek were\r\n      indefatigable in this holy war: their captives were compelled to\r\n      promise a spiritual, as well as temporal, obedience; and, instead\r\n      of their collars and bracelets, an iron horseshoe, a badge of\r\n      ignominy, was imposed on the infidels who still adhered to the\r\n      worship of their fathers. The change, however, was not sincere or\r\n      universal; and, through ages of servitude, the Georgians have\r\n      maintained the succession of their princes and bishops. But a\r\n      race of men, whom nature has cast in her most perfect mould, is\r\n      degraded by poverty, ignorance, and vice; their profession, and\r\n      still more their practice, of Christianity is an empty name; and\r\n      if they have emerged from heresy, it is only because they are too\r\n      illiterate to remember a metaphysical creed. 29\r\n\r\n      25 (return) [ For these wars of the Turks and Romans, see in\r\n      general the Byzantine histories of Zonaras and Cedrenus,\r\n      Scylitzes the continuator of Cedrenus, and Nicephorus Bryennius\r\n      Caesar.

His alarming progress compelled\r\n      her to give herself and her sceptre to the hand of a soldier; and\r\n      Romanus Diogenes was invested with the Imperial purple. His\r\n      patriotism, and perhaps his pride, urged him from Constantinople\r\n      within two months after his accession; and the next campaign he\r\n      most scandalously took the field during the holy festival of\r\n      Easter. In the palace, Diogenes was no more than the husband of\r\n      Eudocia: in the camp, he was the emperor of the Romans, and he\r\n      sustained that character with feeble resources and invincible\r\n      courage. By his spirit and success the soldiers were taught to\r\n      act, the subjects to hope, and the enemies to fear. The Turks had\r\n      penetrated into the heart of Phrygia; but the sultan himself had\r\n      resigned to his emirs the prosecution of the war; and their\r\n      numerous detachments were scattered over Asia in the security of\r\n      conquest. Laden with spoil, and careless of discipline, they were\r\n      separately surprised and defeated by the Greeks: the activity of\r\n      the emperor seemed to multiply his presence: and while they heard\r\n      of his expedition to Antioch, the enemy felt his sword on the\r\n      hills of Trebizond. In three laborious campaigns, the Turks were\r\n      driven beyond the Euphrates; in the fourth and last, Romanus\r\n      undertook the deliverance of Armenia.

The imprudence of the emperor had separated his forces\r\n      after the reduction of Malazkerd. It was in vain that he\r\n      attempted to recall the mercenary Franks: they refused to obey\r\n      his summons; he disdained to await their return: the desertion of\r\n      the Uzi filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion; and against\r\n      the most salutary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and\r\n      decisive action. Had he listened to the fair proposals of the\r\n      sultan, Romanus might have secured a retreat, perhaps a peace;\r\n      but in these overtures he supposed the fear or weakness of the\r\n      enemy, and his answer was conceived in the tone of insult and\r\n      defiance. “If the Barbarian wishes for peace, let him evacuate\r\n      the ground which he occupies for the encampment of the Romans,\r\n      and surrender his city and palace of Rei as a pledge of his\r\n      sincerity.” Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand, but he\r\n      wept the death of so many faithful Moslems; and, after a devout\r\n      prayer, proclaimed a free permission to all who were desirous of\r\n      retiring from the field. With his own hands he tied up his\r\n      horse’s tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and\r\n      cimeter, clothed himself in a white garment, perfumed his body\r\n      with musk, and declared that if he were vanquished, that spot\r\n      should be the place of his burial. 34 The sultan himself had\r\n      affected to cast away his missile weapons: but his hopes of\r\n      victory were placed in the arrows of the Turkish cavalry, whose\r\n      squadrons were loosely distributed in the form of a crescent.\r\n      Instead of the successive lines and reserves of the Grecian\r\n      tactics, Romulus led his army in a single and solid phalanx, and\r\n      pressed with vigor and impatience the artful and yielding\r\n      resistance of the Barbarians. In this desultory and fruitless\r\n      combat he spent the greater part of a summer’s day, till prudence\r\n      and fatigue compelled him to return to his camp. But a retreat is\r\n      always perilous in the face of an active foe; and no sooner had\r\n      the standard been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken\r\n      by the base cowardice, or the baser jealousy, of Andronicus, a\r\n      rival prince, who disgraced his birth and the purple of the\r\n      Caesars. 35 The Turkish squadrons poured a cloud of arrows on\r\n      this moment of confusion and lassitude; and the horns of their\r\n      formidable crescent were closed in the rear of the Greeks. In the\r\n      destruction of the army and pillage of the camp, it would be\r\n      needless to mention the number of the slain or captives. The\r\n      Byzantine writers deplore the loss of an inestimable pearl: they\r\n      forgot to mention, that in this fatal day the Asiatic provinces\r\n      of Rome were irretrievably sacrificed.\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Elmacin (p. 343, 344) assigns this probable number,\r\n      which is reduced by Abulpharagius to 15,000, (p. 227,) and by\r\n      D’Herbelot (p. 102) to 12,000 horse.

Yet he owns his enmity to Romanus.\r\n      Scylitzes speaks more explicitly of his treason.]\r\n\r\n      As long as a hope survived, Romanus attempted to rally and save\r\n      the relics of his army. When the centre, the Imperial station,\r\n      was left naked on all sides, and encompassed by the victorious\r\n      Turks, he still, with desperate courage, maintained the fight\r\n      till the close of day, at the head of the brave and faithful\r\n      subjects who adhered to his standard. They fell around him; his\r\n      horse was slain; the emperor was wounded; yet he stood alone and\r\n      intrepid, till he was oppressed and bound by the strength of\r\n      multitudes. The glory of this illustrious prize was disputed by a\r\n      slave and a soldier; a slave who had seen him on the throne of\r\n      Constantinople, and a soldier whose extreme deformity had been\r\n      excused on the promise of some signal service.\r\n\r\n      Despoiled of his arms, his jewels, and his purple, Romanus spent\r\n      a dreary and perilous night on the field of battle, amidst a\r\n      disorderly crowd of the meaner Barbarians. In the morning the\r\n      royal captive was presented to Alp Arslan, who doubted of his\r\n      fortune, till the identity of the person was ascertained by the\r\n      report of his ambassadors, and by the more pathetic evidence of\r\n      Basilacius, who embraced with tears the feet of his unhappy\r\n      sovereign. The successor of Constantine, in a plebeian habit, was\r\n      led into the Turkish divan, and commanded to kiss the ground\r\n      before the lord of Asia. He reluctantly obeyed; and Alp Arslan,\r\n      starting from his throne, is said to have planted his foot on the\r\n      neck of the Roman emperor. 36 But the fact is doubtful; and if,\r\n      in this moment of insolence, the sultan complied with the\r\n      national custom, the rest of his conduct has extorted the praise\r\n      of his bigoted foes, and may afford a lesson to the most\r\n      civilized ages. He instantly raised the royal captive from the\r\n      ground; and thrice clasping his hand with tender sympathy,\r\n      assured him, that his life and dignity should be inviolate in the\r\n      hands of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his\r\n      equals and the vicissitudes of fortune. From the divan, Romanus\r\n      was conducted to an adjacent tent, where he was served with pomp\r\n      and reverence by the officers of the sultan, who, twice each day,\r\n      seated him in the place of honor at his own table. In a free and\r\n      familiar conversation of eight days, not a word, not a look, of\r\n      insult escaped from the conqueror; but he severely censured the\r\n      unworthy subjects who had deserted their valiant prince in the\r\n      hour of danger, and gently admonished his antagonist of some\r\n      errors which he had committed in the management of the war. In\r\n      the preliminaries of negotiation, Alp Arslan asked him what\r\n      treatment he expected to receive, and the calm indifference of\r\n      the emperor displays the freedom of his mind. “If you are cruel,”\r\n      said he, “you will take my life; if you listen to pride, you will\r\n      drag me at your chariot-wheels; if you consult your interest, you\r\n      will accept a ransom, and restore me to my country.” “And what,”\r\n      continued the sultan, “would have been your own behavior, had\r\n      fortune smiled on your arms?” The reply of the Greek betrays a\r\n      sentiment, which prudence, and even gratitude, should have taught\r\n      him to suppress. “Had I vanquished,” he fiercely said, “I would\r\n      have inflicted on thy body many a stripe.” The Turkish conqueror\r\n      smiled at the insolence of his captive; observed that the\r\n      Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and forgiveness of\r\n      injuries; and nobly declared, that he would not imitate an\r\n      example which he condemned. After mature deliberation, Alp Arslan\r\n      dictated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million,\r\n      361 an annual tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces\r\n      of gold, 37 the marriage of the royal children, and the\r\n      deliverance of all the Moslems, who were in the power of the\r\n      Greeks. Romanus, with a sigh, subscribed this treaty, so\r\n      disgraceful to the majesty of the empire; he was immediately\r\n      invested with a Turkish robe of honor; his nobles and patricians\r\n      were restored to their sovereign; and the sultan, after a\r\n      courteous embrace, dismissed him with rich presents and a\r\n      military guard. No sooner did he reach the confines of the\r\n      empire, than he was informed that the palace and provinces had\r\n      disclaimed their allegiance to a captive: a sum of two hundred\r\n      thousand pieces was painfully collected; and the fallen monarch\r\n      transmitted this part of his ransom, with a sad confession of his\r\n      impotence and disgrace. The generosity, or perhaps the ambition,\r\n      of the sultan, prepared to espouse the cause of his ally; but his\r\n      designs were prevented by the defeat, imprisonment, and death, of\r\n      Romanus Diogenes. 38\r\n\r\n      36 (return) [ This circumstance, which we read and doubt in\r\n      Scylitzes and Constantine Manasses, is more prudently omitted by\r\n      Nicephorus and Zonaras.]\r\n\r\n      361 (return) [ Elmacin gives 1,500,000.

The fairest\r\n      part of Asia was subject to his laws: twelve hundred princes, or\r\n      the sons of princes, stood before his throne; and two hundred\r\n      thousand soldiers marched under his banners. The sultan disdained\r\n      to pursue the fugitive Greeks; but he meditated the more glorious\r\n      conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of the house of Seljuk.\r\n      He moved from Bagdad to the banks of the Oxus; a bridge was\r\n      thrown over the river; and twenty days were consumed in the\r\n      passage of his troops. But the progress of the great king was\r\n      retarded by the governor of Berzem; and Joseph the Carizmian\r\n      presumed to defend his fortress against the powers of the East.\r\n      When he was produced a captive in the royal tent, the sultan,\r\n      instead of praising his valor, severely reproached his obstinate\r\n      folly: and the insolent replies of the rebel provoked a sentence,\r\n      that he should be fastened to four stakes, and left to expire in\r\n      that painful situation. At this command, the desperate Carizmian,\r\n      drawing a dagger, rushed headlong towards the throne: the guards\r\n      raised their battle-axes; their zeal was checked by Alp Arslan,\r\n      the most skilful archer of the age: he drew his bow, but his foot\r\n      slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received in his breast\r\n      the dagger of Joseph, who was instantly cut in pieces.\r\n\r\n      The wound was mortal; and the Turkish prince bequeathed a dying\r\n      admonition to the pride of kings. “In my youth,” said Alp Arslan,\r\n      “I was advised by a sage to humble myself before God; to distrust\r\n      my own strength; and never to despise the most contemptible foe.\r\n      I have neglected these lessons; and my neglect has been\r\n      deservedly punished. Yesterday, as from an eminence I beheld the\r\n      numbers, the discipline, and the spirit, of my armies, the earth\r\n      seemed to tremble under my feet; and I said in my heart, Surely\r\n      thou art the king of the world, the greatest and most invincible\r\n      of warriors. These armies are no longer mine; and, in the\r\n      confidence of my personal strength, I now fall by the hand of an\r\n      assassin.” 39 Alp Arslan possessed the virtues of a Turk and a\r\n      Mussulman; his voice and stature commanded the reverence of\r\n      mankind; his face was shaded with long whiskers; and his ample\r\n      turban was fashioned in the shape of a crown. The remains of the\r\n      sultan were deposited in the tomb of the Seljukian dynasty; and\r\n      the passenger might read and meditate this useful inscription: 40\r\n      “O ye who have seen the glory of Alp Arslan exalted to the\r\n      heavens, repair to Maru, and you will behold it buried in the\r\n      dust.” The annihilation of the inscription, and the tomb itself,\r\n      more forcibly proclaims the instability of human greatness.\r\n\r\n      39 (return) [ This interesting death is told by D’Herbelot, (p.\r\n      103, 104,) and M. De Guignes, (tom. iii. p. 212, 213.) from their\r\n      Oriental writers; but neither of them have transfused the spirit\r\n      of Elmacin, (Hist. Saracen p. 344, 345.)]\r\n\r\n      40 (return) [ A critic of high renown, (the late Dr. Johnson,)\r\n      who has severely scrutinized the epitaphs of Pope, might cavil in\r\n      this sublime inscription at the words “repair to Maru,” since the\r\n      reader must already be at Maru before he could peruse the\r\n      inscription.]\r\n\r\n      During the life of Alp Arslan, his eldest son had been\r\n      acknowledged as the future sultan of the Turks. On his father’s\r\n      death the inheritance was disputed by an uncle, a cousin, and a\r\n      brother: they drew their cimeters, and assembled their followers;\r\n      and the triple victory of Malek Shah 41 established his own\r\n      reputation and the right of primogeniture. In every age, and more\r\n      especially in Asia, the thirst of power has inspired the same\r\n      passions, and occasioned the same disorders; but, from the long\r\n      series of civil war, it would not be easy to extract a sentiment\r\n      more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of the\r\n      Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle, he performed his\r\n      devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As the\r\n      sultan rose from the ground, he asked his vizier Nizam, who had\r\n      knelt beside him, what had been the object of his secret\r\n      petition: “That your arms may be crowned with victory,” was the\r\n      prudent, and most probably the sincere, answer of the minister.\r\n      “For my part,” replied the generous Malek, “I implored the Lord\r\n      of Hosts that he would take from me my life and crown, if my\r\n      brother be more worthy than myself to reign over the Moslems.”\r\n      The favorable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph; and\r\n      for the first time, the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful\r\n      was communicated to a Barbarian. But this Barbarian, by his\r\n      personal merit, and the extent of his empire, was the greatest\r\n      prince of his age. After the settlement of Persia and Syria, he\r\n      marched at the head of innumerable armies to achieve the conquest\r\n      of Turkestan, which had been undertaken by his father. In his\r\n      passage of the Oxus, the boatmen, who had been employed in\r\n      transporting some troops, complained, that their payment was\r\n      assigned on the revenues of Antioch. The sultan frowned at this\r\n      preposterous choice; but he miled at the artful flattery of his\r\n      vizier. “It was not to postpone their reward, that I selected\r\n      those remote places, but to leave a memorial to posterity, that,\r\n      under your reign, Antioch and the Oxus were subject to the same\r\n      sovereign.” But this description of his limits was unjust and\r\n      parsimonious: beyond the Oxus, he reduced to his obedience the\r\n      cities of Bochara, Carizme, and Samarcand, and crushed each\r\n      rebellious slave, or independent savage, who dared to resist.\r\n      Malek passed the Sihon or Jaxartes, the last boundary of Persian\r\n      civilization: the hordes of Turkestan yielded to his supremacy:\r\n      his name was inserted on the coins, and in the prayers of\r\n      Cashgar, a Tartar kingdom on the extreme borders of China. From\r\n      the Chinese frontier, he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or\r\n      feudatory sway to the west and south, as far as the mountains of\r\n      Georgia, the neighborhood of Constantinople, the holy city of\r\n      Jerusalem, and the spicy groves of Arabia Felix. Instead of\r\n      resigning himself to the luxury of his harem, the shepherd king,\r\n      both in peace and war, was in action and in the field. By the\r\n      perpetual motion of the royal camp, each province was\r\n      successively blessed with his presence; and he is said to have\r\n      perambulated twelve times the wide extent of his dominions, which\r\n      surpassed the Asiatic reign of Cyrus and the caliphs. Of these\r\n      expeditions, the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage of\r\n      Mecca: the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by\r\n      his arms; the citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the\r\n      profusion of his alms; and the desert was cheered by the places\r\n      of relief and refreshment, which he instituted for the use of his\r\n      brethren. Hunting was the pleasure, and even the passion, of the\r\n      sultan, and his train consisted of forty-seven thousand horses;\r\n      but after the massacre of a Turkish chase, for each piece of\r\n      game, he bestowed a piece of gold on the poor, a slight\r\n      atonement, at the expense of the people, for the cost and\r\n      mischief of the amusement of kings. In the peaceful prosperity of\r\n      his reign, the cities of Asia were adorned with palaces and\r\n      hospitals with moschs and colleges; few departed from his Divan\r\n      without reward, and none without justice. The language and\r\n      literature of Persia revived under the house of Seljuk; 42 and if\r\n      Malek emulated the liberality of a Turk less potent than himself,\r\n      43 his palace might resound with the songs of a hundred poets.\r\n      The sultan bestowed a more serious and learned care on the\r\n      reformation of the calendar, which was effected by a general\r\n      assembly of the astronomers of the East. By a law of the prophet,\r\n      the Moslems are confined to the irregular course of the lunar\r\n      months; in Persia, since the age of Zoroaster, the revolution of\r\n      the sun has been known and celebrated as an annual festival; 44\r\n      but after the fall of the Magian empire, the intercalation had\r\n      been neglected; the fractions of minutes and hours were\r\n      multiplied into days; and the date of the springs was removed\r\n      from the sign of Aries to that of Pisces. The reign of Malek was\r\n      illustrated by the Gelalaean aera; and all errors, either past or\r\n      future, were corrected by a computation of time, which surpasses\r\n      the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian, style.\r\n      45\r\n\r\n      41 (return) [ The Bibliotheque Orientale has given the text of\r\n      the reign of Malek, (p. 542, 543, 544, 654, 655;) and the\r\n      Histoire Generale des Huns (tom. iii. p. 214-224) has added the\r\n      usual measure of repetition emendation, and supplement.

An ample share of\r\n      their wisdom and virtue is due to a Persian vizier, who ruled the\r\n      empire under the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son. Nizam, one of\r\n      the most illustrious ministers of the East, was honored by the\r\n      caliph as an oracle of religion and science; he was trusted by\r\n      the sultan as the faithful vicegerent of his power and justice.\r\n      After an administration of thirty years, the fame of the vizier,\r\n      his wealth, and even his services, were transformed into crimes.\r\n      He was overthrown by the insidious arts of a woman and a rival;\r\n      and his fall was hastened by a rash declaration, that his cap and\r\n      ink-horn, the badges of his office, were connected by the divine\r\n      decree with the throne and diadem of the sultan. At the age of\r\n      ninety-three years, the venerable statesman was dismissed by his\r\n      master, accused by his enemies, and murdered by a fanatic: 451\r\n      the last words of Nizam attested his innocence, and the remainder\r\n      of Malek’s life was short and inglorious. From Ispahan, the scene\r\n      of this disgraceful transaction, the sultan moved to Bagdad, with\r\n      the design of transplanting the caliph, and of fixing his own\r\n      residence in the capital of the Moslem world. The feeble\r\n      successor of Mahomet obtained a respite of ten days; and before\r\n      the expiration of the term, the Barbarian was summoned by the\r\n      angel of death. His ambassadors at Constantinople had asked in\r\n      marriage a Roman princess; but the proposal was decently eluded;\r\n      and the daughter of Alexius, who might herself have been the\r\n      victim, expresses her abhorrence of his unnatural conjunction. 46\r\n      The daughter of the sultan was bestowed on the caliph Moctadi,\r\n      with the imperious condition, that, renouncing the society of his\r\n      wives and concubines, he should forever confine himself to this\r\n      honorable alliance.\r\n\r\n      451 (return) [ He was the first great victim of his enemy, Hassan\r\n      Sabek, founder of the Assassins.

The three younger\r\n      dynasties were those of Kerman, of Syria, and of Roum: the first\r\n      of these commanded an extensive, though obscure, 47 dominion on\r\n      the shores of the Indian Ocean: 48 the second expelled the\r\n      Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus; and the third, our\r\n      peculiar care, invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. The\r\n      generous policy of Malek contributed to their elevation: he\r\n      allowed the princes of his blood, even those whom he had\r\n      vanquished in the field, to seek new kingdoms worthy of their\r\n      ambition; nor was he displeased that they should draw away the\r\n      more ardent spirits, who might have disturbed the tranquillity of\r\n      his reign. As the supreme head of his family and nation, the\r\n      great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute of his\r\n      royal brethren: the thrones of Kerman and Nice, of Aleppo and\r\n      Damascus; the Atabeks, and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia,\r\n      erected their standards under the shadow of his sceptre: 49 and\r\n      the hordes of Turkmans overspread the plains of the Western Asia.\r\n\r\n      After the death of Malek, the bands of union and subordination\r\n      were relaxed and finally dissolved: the indulgence of the house\r\n      of Seljuk invested their slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms;\r\n      and, in the Oriental style, a crowd of princes arose from the\r\n      dust of their feet. 50\r\n\r\n      461 (return) [ See Von Hammer, Osmanische Geschichte, vol. i. p.\r\n      16.

His five sons,\r\n      strong in arms, ambitious of power, and eager for revenge,\r\n      unsheathed their cimeters against the son of Alp Arslan. The two\r\n      armies expected the signal when the caliph, forgetful of the\r\n      majesty which secluded him from vulgar eyes, interposed his\r\n      venerable mediation. “Instead of shedding the blood of your\r\n      brethren, your brethren both in descent and faith, unite your\r\n      forces in a holy war against the Greeks, the enemies of God and\r\n      his apostle.” They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced his\r\n      rebellious kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted\r\n      the royal standard, which gave him the free conquest and\r\n      hereditary command of the provinces of the Roman empire, from\r\n      Arzeroum to Constantinople, and the unknown regions of the West.\r\n      51 Accompanied by his four brothers, he passed the Euphrates; the\r\n      Turkish camp was soon seated in the neighborhood of Kutaieh in\r\n      Phrygia; and his flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as\r\n      the Hellespont and the Black Sea. Since the decline of the\r\n      empire, the peninsula of Asia Minor had been exposed to the\r\n      transient, though destructive, inroads of the Persians and\r\n      Saracens; but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved for\r\n      the Turkish sultan; and his arms were introduced by the Greeks,\r\n      who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country. Since the\r\n      captivity of Romanus, six years the feeble son of Eudocia had\r\n      trembled under the weight of the Imperial crown, till the\r\n      provinces of the East and West were lost in the same month by a\r\n      double rebellion: of either chief Nicephorus was the common name;\r\n      but the surnames of Bryennius and Botoniates distinguish the\r\n      European and Asiatic candidates. Their reasons, or rather their\r\n      promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after some hesitation,\r\n      Soliman declared himself in favor of Botoniates, opened a free\r\n      passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and\r\n      joined the banner of the Crescent to that of the Cross. After his\r\n      ally had ascended the throne of Constantinople, the sultan was\r\n      hospitably entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari;\r\n      and a body of two thousand Turks was transported into Europe, to\r\n      whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted for the\r\n      defeat and captivity of his rival, Bryennius. But the conquest of\r\n      Europe was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia:\r\n      Constantinople was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the\r\n      provinces beyond the Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the regular\r\n      progress of the Turks, who fortified the passes of the rivers and\r\n      mountains, left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion. Another\r\n      candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Melissenus, in his\r\n      purple robes and red buskins, attended the motions of the Turkish\r\n      camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a\r\n      Roman prince, who immediately surrendered them into the hands of\r\n      the Barbarians. These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of\r\n      peace with the emperor Alexius: his fear of Robert compelled him\r\n      to seek the friendship of Soliman; and it was not till after the\r\n      sultan’s death that he extended as far as Nicomedia, about sixty\r\n      miles from Constantinople, the eastern boundary of the Roman\r\n      world. Trebizond alone, defended on either side by the sea and\r\n      mountains, preserved at the extremity of the Euxine the ancient\r\n      character of a Greek colony, and the future destiny of a\r\n      Christian empire.\r\n\r\n      501 (return) [ Wilken considers Cutulmish not a Turkish name.\r\n      Geschicht Kreuz-zuge, vol. i. p. 9.—M.]\r\n\r\n      51 (return) [ On the conquest of Asia Minor, M.

By the propagation of\r\n      the Moslem faith, Soliman deserved the name of Gazi, a holy\r\n      champion; and his new kingdoms, of the Romans, or of Roum, was\r\n      added to the tables of Oriental geography. It is described as\r\n      extending from the Euphrates to Constantinople, from the Black\r\n      Sea to the confines of Syria; pregnant with mines of silver and\r\n      iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn and wine, and\r\n      productive of cattle and excellent horses. 52 The wealth of\r\n      Lydia, the arts of the Greeks, the splendor of the Augustan age,\r\n      existed only in books and ruins, which were equally obscure in\r\n      the eyes of the Scythian conquerors. Yet, in the present decay,\r\n      Anatolia still contains some wealthy and populous cities; and,\r\n      under the Byzantine empire, they were far more flourishing in\r\n      numbers, size, and opulence. By the choice of the sultan, Nice,\r\n      the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for his palace and\r\n      fortress: the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum was planted\r\n      one hundred miles from Constantinople; and the divinity of Christ\r\n      was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been\r\n      pronounced by the first general synod of the Catholics. The unity\r\n      of God, and the mission of Mahomet, were preached in the moschs;\r\n      the Arabian learning was taught in the schools; the Cadhis judged\r\n      according to the law of the Koran; the Turkish manners and\r\n      language prevailed in the cities; and Turkman camps were\r\n      scattered over the plains and mountains of Anatolia. On the hard\r\n      conditions of tribute and servitude, the Greek Christians might\r\n      enjoy the exercise of their religion; but their most holy\r\n      churches were profaned; their priests and bishops were insulted;\r\n      53 they were compelled to suffer the triumph of the Pagans, and\r\n      the apostasy of their brethren; many thousand children were\r\n      marked by the knife of circumcision; and many thousand captives\r\n      were devoted to the service or the pleasures of their masters. 54\r\n      After the loss of Asia, Antioch still maintained her primitive\r\n      allegiance to Christ and Caesar; but the solitary province was\r\n      separated from all Roman aid, and surrounded on all sides by the\r\n      Mahometan powers. The despair of Philaretus the governor prepared\r\n      the sacrifice of his religion and loyalty, had not his guilt been\r\n      prevented by his son, who hastened to the Nicene palace, and\r\n      offered to deliver this valuable prize into the hands of Soliman.\r\n      The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in twelve nights\r\n      (for he reposed in the day) performed a march of six hundred\r\n      miles. Antioch was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of his\r\n      enterprise; and the dependent cities, as far as Laodicea and the\r\n      confines of Aleppo, 55 obeyed the example of the metropolis. From\r\n      Laodicea to the Thracian Bosphorus, or arm of St. George, the\r\n      conquests and reign of Soliman extended thirty days’ journey in\r\n      length, and in breadth about ten or fifteen, between the rocks of\r\n      Lycia and the Black Sea. 56 The Turkish ignorance of navigation\r\n      protected, for a while, the inglorious safety of the emperor; but\r\n      no sooner had a fleet of two hundred ships been constructed by\r\n      the hands of the captive Greeks, than Alexius trembled behind the\r\n      walls of his capital.

In\r\n      their capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants had stipulated the\r\n      assurance of their religion and property; but the articles were\r\n      interpreted by a master against whom it was dangerous to dispute;\r\n      and in the four hundred years of the reign of the caliphs, the\r\n      political climate of Jerusalem was exposed to the vicissitudes of\r\n      storm and sunshine. 59 By the increase of proselytes and\r\n      population, the Mahometans might excuse the usurpation of three\r\n      fourths of the city: but a peculiar quarter was resolved for the\r\n      patriarch with his clergy and people; a tribute of two pieces of\r\n      gold was the price of protection; and the sepulchre of Christ,\r\n      with the church of the Resurrection, was still left in the hands\r\n      of his votaries. Of these votaries, the most numerous and\r\n      respectable portion were strangers to Jerusalem: the pilgrimages\r\n      to the Holy Land had been stimulated, rather than suppressed, by\r\n      the conquest of the Arabs; and the enthusiasm which had always\r\n      prompted these perilous journeys, was nourished by the congenial\r\n      passions of grief and indignation. A crowd of pilgrims from the\r\n      East and West continued to visit the holy sepulchre, and the\r\n      adjacent sanctuaries, more especially at the festival of Easter;\r\n      and the Greeks and Latins, the Nestorians and Jacobites, the\r\n      Copts and Abyssinians, the Armenians and Georgians, maintained\r\n      the chapels, the clergy, and the poor of their respective\r\n      communions. The harmony of prayer in so many various tongues, the\r\n      worship of so many nations in the common temple of their\r\n      religion, might have afforded a spectacle of edification and\r\n      peace; but the zeal of the Christian sects was imbittered by\r\n      hatred and revenge; and in the kingdom of a suffering Messiah,\r\n      who had pardoned his enemies, they aspired to command and\r\n      persecute their spiritual brethren. The preeminence was asserted\r\n      by the spirit and numbers of the Franks; and the greatness of\r\n      Charlemagne 60 protected both the Latin pilgrims and the\r\n      Catholics of the East. The poverty of Carthage, Alexandria, and\r\n      Jerusalem, was relieved by the alms of that pious emperor; and\r\n      many monasteries of Palestine were founded or restored by his\r\n      liberal devotion. Harun Alrashid, the greatest of the Abbassides,\r\n      esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy of genius\r\n      and power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent\r\n      intercourse of gifts and embassies; and the caliph, without\r\n      resigning the substantial dominion, presented the emperor with\r\n      the keys of the holy sepulchre, and perhaps of the city of\r\n      Jerusalem. In the decline of the Carlovingian monarchy, the\r\n      republic of Amalphi promoted the interest of trade and religion\r\n      in the East. Her vessels transported the Latin pilgrims to the\r\n      coasts of Egypt and Palestine, and deserved, by their useful\r\n      imports, the favor and alliance of the Fatimite caliphs: 61 an\r\n      annual fair was instituted on Mount Calvary: and the Italian\r\n      merchants founded the convent and hospital of St. John of\r\n      Jerusalem, the cradle of the monastic and military order, which\r\n      has since reigned in the isles of Rhodes and of Malta. Had the\r\n      Christian pilgrims been content to revere the tomb of a prophet,\r\n      the disciples of Mahomet, instead of blaming, would have\r\n      imitated, their piety: but these rigid Unitarians were\r\n      scandalized by a worship which represents the birth, death, and\r\n      resurrection, of a God; the Catholic images were branded with the\r\n      name of idols; and the Moslems smiled with indignation 62 at the\r\n      miraculous flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the\r\n      holy sepulchre. 63 This pious fraud, first devised in the ninth\r\n      century, 64 was devoutly cherished by the Latin crusaders, and is\r\n      annually repeated by the clergy of the Greek, Armenian, and\r\n      Coptic sects, 65 who impose on the credulous spectators 66 for\r\n      their own benefit, and that of their tyrants. In every age, a\r\n      principle of toleration has been fortified by a sense of\r\n      interest: and the revenue of the prince and his emir was\r\n      increased each year, by the expense and tribute of so many\r\n      thousand strangers.\r\n\r\n      58 (return) [ Our best fund for the history of Jerusalem from\r\n      Heraclius to the crusades is contained in two large and original\r\n      passages of William archbishop of Tyre, (l. i. c. 1-10, l. xviii.\r\n      c. 5, 6,) the principal author of the Gesta Dei per Francos.

A sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the\r\n      importance of Christian trade; and the emirs of Palestine were\r\n      less remote from the justice and power of the throne. But the\r\n      third of these Fatimite caliphs was the famous Hakem, 67 a\r\n      frantic youth, who was delivered by his impiety and despotism\r\n      from the fear either of God or man; and whose reign was a wild\r\n      mixture of vice and folly. Regardless of the most ancient customs\r\n      of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute confinement; the\r\n      restraint excited the clamors of both sexes; their clamors\r\n      provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the\r\n      flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a\r\n      bloody conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a zealous\r\n      Mussulman, the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges:\r\n      twelve hundred and ninety copies of the Koran were transcribed at\r\n      his expense in letters of gold; and his edict extirpated the\r\n      vineyards of the Upper Egypt. But his vanity was soon flattered\r\n      by the hope of introducing a new religion; he aspired above the\r\n      fame of a prophet, and styled himself the visible image of the\r\n      Most High God, who, after nine apparitions on earth, was at\r\n      length manifest in his royal person. At the name of Hakem, the\r\n      lord of the living and the dead, every knee was bent in religious\r\n      adoration: his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo:\r\n      sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession of faith; and\r\n      at the present hour, a free and warlike people, the Druses of\r\n      Mount Libanus, are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman\r\n      and tyrant. 68 In his divine character, Hakem hated the Jews and\r\n      Christians, as the servants of his rivals; while some remains of\r\n      prejudice or prudence still pleaded in favor of the law of\r\n      Mahomet. Both in Egypt and Palestine, his cruel and wanton\r\n      persecution made some martyrs and many apostles: the common\r\n      rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally\r\n      disregarded; and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of\r\n      strangers and natives. The temple of the Christian world, the\r\n      church of the Resurrection, was demolished to its foundations;\r\n      the luminous prodigy of Easter was interrupted, and much profane\r\n      labor was exhausted to destroy the cave in the rock which\r\n      properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At the report of this\r\n      sacrilege, the nations of Europe were astonished and afflicted:\r\n      but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they\r\n      contented themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the\r\n      secret advisers of the impious Barbarian. 69 Yet the calamities\r\n      of Jerusalem were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy\r\n      or repentance of Hakem himself; and the royal mandate was sealed\r\n      for the restitution of the churches, when the tyrant was\r\n      assassinated by the emissaries of his sister. The succeeding\r\n      caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and policy: a free\r\n      toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the emperor\r\n      of Constantinople, the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins; and,\r\n      after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase\r\n      of appetite to the spiritual feast. 70 In the sea-voyage of\r\n      Palestine, the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare:\r\n      but the conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between\r\n      Germany and Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of\r\n      his kingdom, relieved and conducted his itinerant brethren; 71\r\n      and from Belgrade to Antioch, they traversed fifteen hundred\r\n      miles of a Christian empire. Among the Franks, the zeal of\r\n      pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times: and the\r\n      roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of every\r\n      rank, who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they\r\n      should have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and\r\n      prelates abandoned the care of their dominions; and the numbers\r\n      of these pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which\r\n      marched in the ensuing age under the banner of the cross. About\r\n      thirty years before the first crusade, the arch bishop of Mentz,\r\n      with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, undertook\r\n      this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan; and the\r\n      multitude of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons.\r\n      At Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the\r\n      emperor; but the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault\r\n      of the wild Arabs: they drew their swords with scrupulous\r\n      reluctance, and sustained siege in the village of Capernaum, till\r\n      they were rescued by the venal protection of the Fatimite emir.\r\n      After visiting the holy places, they embarked for Italy, but only\r\n      a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety in their native land.\r\n\r\n      Ingulphus, a secretary of William the Conqueror, was a companion\r\n      of this pilgrimage: he observes that they sailed from Normandy,\r\n      thirty stout and well-appointed horsemen; but that they repassed\r\n      the Alps, twenty miserable palmers, with the staff in their hand,\r\n      and the wallet at their back. 72\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ See D’Herbelot, (Bibliot.

Silvestre de Sacy.”\r\n      Deux tomes, Paris, 1838. The learned author has prefixed a life\r\n      of Hakem Biamr-Allah, which enables us to correct several errors\r\n      in the account of Gibbon. These errors chiefly arose from his\r\n      want of knowledge or of attention to the chronology of Hakem’s\r\n      life. Hakem succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the year of the\r\n      Hegira 386. He did not assume his divinity till 408. His life was\r\n      indeed “a wild mixture of vice and folly,” to which may be added,\r\n      of the most sanguinary cruelty. During his reign, 18,000 persons\r\n      were victims of his ferocity. Yet such is the god, observes M. de\r\n      Sacy, whom the Druses have worshipped for 800 years! (See p.\r\n      ccccxxix.) All his wildest and most extravagant actions were\r\n      interpreted by his followers as having a mystic and allegoric\r\n      meaning, alluding to the destruction of other religions and the\r\n      propagation of his own. It does not seem to have been the\r\n      “vanity” of Hakem which induced him to introduce a new religion.\r\n      The curious point in the new faith is that Hamza, the son of Ali,\r\n      the real founder of the Unitarian religion, (such is its boastful\r\n      title,) was content to take a secondary part. While Hakem was\r\n      God, the one Supreme, the Imam Hamza was his Intelligence. It was\r\n      not in his “divine character” that Hakem “hated the Jews and\r\n      Christians,” but in that of a Mahometan bigot, which he displayed\r\n      in the earlier years of his reign. His barbarous persecution, and\r\n      the burning of the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem,\r\n      belong entirely to that period; and his assumption of divinity\r\n      was followed by an edict of toleration to Jews and Christians.\r\n      The Mahometans, whose religion he then treated with hostility and\r\n      contempt, being far the most numerous, were his most dangerous\r\n      enemies, and therefore the objects of his most inveterate hatred.\r\n      It is another singular fact, that the religion of Hakem was by no\r\n      means confined to Egypt and Syria. M. de Sacy quotes a letter\r\n      addressed to the chief of the sect in India; and there is\r\n      likewise a letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine, son of\r\n      Armanous, (Romanus,) and the clergy of the empire. (Constantine\r\n      VIII., M. de Sacy supposes, but this is irreconcilable with\r\n      chronology; it must mean Constantine XI., Monomachus.) The\r\n      assassination of Hakem is, of course, disbelieved by his\r\n      sectaries. M. de Sacy seems to consider the fact obscure and\r\n      doubtful. According to his followers he disappeared, but is\r\n      hereafter to return. At his return the resurrection is to take\r\n      place; the triumph of Unitarianism, and the final discomfiture of\r\n      all other religions. The temple of Mecca is especially devoted to\r\n      destruction. It is remarkable that one of the signs of this final\r\n      consummation, and of the reappearance of Hakem, is that\r\n      Christianity shall be gaining a manifest predominance over\r\n      Mahometanism. As for the religion of the Druses, I cannot agree\r\n      with Gibbon that it does not “deserve” to be better known; and am\r\n      grateful to M. de Sacy, notwithstanding the prolixity and\r\n      occasional repetition in his two large volumes, for the full\r\n      examination of the most extraordinary religious aberration which\r\n      ever extensively affected the mind of man.

In his retreat he indulged the license of slaughter and\r\n      rapine: the judge and notaries of Jerusalem were invited to his\r\n      camp; and their execution was followed by the massacre of three\r\n      thousand citizens. The cruelty or the defeat of Atsiz was soon\r\n      punished by the sultan Toucush, the brother of Malek Shah, who,\r\n      with a higher title and more formidable powers, asserted the\r\n      dominion of Syria and Palestine. The house of Seljuk reigned\r\n      about twenty years in Jerusalem; 74 but the hereditary command of\r\n      the holy city and territory was intrusted or abandoned to the\r\n      emir Ortok, the chief of a tribe of Turkmans, whose children,\r\n      after their expulsion from Palestine, formed two dynasties on the\r\n      borders of Armenia and Assyria. 75 The Oriental Christians and\r\n      the Latin pilgrims deplored a revolution, which, instead of the\r\n      regular government and old alliance of the caliphs, imposed on\r\n      their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the North. 76 In\r\n      his court and camp the great sultan had adopted in some degree\r\n      the arts and manners of Persia; but the body of the Turkish\r\n      nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes, still breathed\r\n      the fierceness of the desert. From Nice to Jerusalem, the western\r\n      countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and domestic hostility;\r\n      and the shepherds of Palestine, who held a precarious sway on a\r\n      doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor capacity to await the\r\n      slow profits of commercial and religious freedom. The pilgrims,\r\n      who, through innumerable perils, had reached the gates of\r\n      Jerusalem, were the victims of private rapine or public\r\n      oppression, and often sunk under the pressure of famine and\r\n      disease, before they were permitted to salute the holy sepulchre.\r\n      A spirit of native barbarism, or recent zeal, prompted the\r\n      Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect: the patriarch was\r\n      dragged by the hair along the pavement, and cast into a dungeon,\r\n      to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the divine\r\n      worship in the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by\r\n      the savage rudeness of its masters. The pathetic tale excited the\r\n      millions of the West to march under the standard of the cross to\r\n      the relief of the Holy Land; and yet how trifling is the sum of\r\n      these accumulated evils, if compared with the single act of the\r\n      sacrilege of Hakem, which had been so patiently endured by the\r\n      Latin Christians! A slighter provocation inflamed the more\r\n      irascible temper of their descendants: a new spirit had arisen of\r\n      religious chivalry and papal dominion; a nerve was touched of\r\n      exquisite feeling; and the sensation vibrated to the heart of\r\n      Europe.\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ See Elmacin (Hist.

His\r\n      resentment and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the\r\n      oppression of the Christian name; he mingled his tears with those\r\n      of the patriarch, and earnestly inquired, if no hopes of relief\r\n      could be entertained from the Greek emperors of the East. The\r\n      patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the successors of\r\n      Constantine. “I will rouse,” exclaimed the hermit, “the martial\r\n      nations of Europe in your cause;” and Europe was obedient to the\r\n      call of the hermit. The astonished patriarch dismissed him with\r\n      epistles of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at\r\n      Bari, than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff.\r\n      His stature was small, his appearance contemptible; but his eye\r\n      was keen and lively; and he possessed that vehemence of speech,\r\n      which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of the soul. 2 He was\r\n      born of a gentleman’s family, (for we must now adopt a modern\r\n      idiom,) and his military service was under the neighboring counts\r\n      of Boulogne, the heroes of the first crusade. But he soon\r\n      relinquished the sword and the world; and if it be true, that his\r\n      wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw, with\r\n      the less reluctance, from her bed to a convent, and at length to\r\n      a hermitage. 211 In this austere solitude, his body was\r\n      emaciated, his fancy was inflamed; whatever he wished, he\r\n      believed; whatever he believed, he saw in dreams and revelations.\r\n      From Jerusalem the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic; but\r\n      as he excelled in the popular madness of the times, Pope Urban\r\n      the Second received him as a prophet, applauded his glorious\r\n      design, promised to support it in a general council, and\r\n      encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land.\r\n      Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous\r\n      missionary traversed. with speed and success, the provinces of\r\n      Italy and France. His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and\r\n      fervent, and the alms which he received with one hand, he\r\n      distributed with the other: his head was bare, his feet naked,\r\n      his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse garment; he bore and\r\n      displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass on which he rode was\r\n      sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of the man of God.\r\n      He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the streets,\r\n      and the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the\r\n      palace and the cottage; and the people (for all was people) was\r\n      impetuously moved by his call to repentance and arms. When he\r\n      painted the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine,\r\n      every heart was melted to compassion; every breast glowed with\r\n      indignation, when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend\r\n      their brethren, and rescue their Savior: his ignorance of art and\r\n      language was compensated by sighs, and tears, and ejaculations;\r\n      and Peter supplied the deficiency of reason by loud and frequent\r\n      appeals to Christ and his mother, to the saints and angels of\r\n      paradise, with whom he had personally conversed. 212 The most\r\n      perfect orator of Athens might have envied the success of his\r\n      eloquence; the rustic enthusiast inspired the passions which he\r\n      felt, and Christendom expected with impatience the counsels and\r\n      decrees of the supreme pontiff.\r\n\r\n      1 (return) [ Whimsical enough is the origin of the name of\r\n      Picards, and from thence of Picardie, which does not date later\r\n      than A.D. 1200.

He undertook the conquest of the\r\n      East, whilst the larger portion of Rome was possessed and\r\n      fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna, who contended with\r\n      Urban for the name and honors of the pontificate. He attempted to\r\n      unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes were\r\n      separated from the church, and the people from their princes, by\r\n      the excommunication which himself and his predecessors had\r\n      thundered against the emperor and the king of France. Philip the\r\n      First, of France, supported with patience the censures which he\r\n      had provoked by his scandalous life and adulterous marriage.\r\n      Henry the Fourth, of Germany, asserted the right of investitures,\r\n      the prerogative of confirming his bishops by the delivery of the\r\n      ring and crosier. But the emperor’s party was crushed in Italy by\r\n      the arms of the Normans and the Countess Mathilda; and the long\r\n      quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt of his son\r\n      Conrad and the shame of his wife, 5 who, in the synods of\r\n      Constance and Placentia, confessed the manifold prostitutions to\r\n      which she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honor\r\n      and his own. 6 So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was\r\n      his influence, that the council which he summoned at Placentia 7\r\n      was composed of two hundred bishops of Italy, France, Burgandy,\r\n      Swabia, and Bavaria. Four thousand of the clergy, and thirty\r\n      thousand of the laity, attended this important meeting; and, as\r\n      the most spacious cathedral would have been inadequate to the\r\n      multitude, the session of seven days was held in a plain adjacent\r\n      to the city. The ambassadors of the Greek emperor, Alexius\r\n      Comnenus, were introduced to plead the distress of their\r\n      sovereign, and the danger of Constantinople, which was divided\r\n      only by a narrow sea from the victorious Turks, the common\r\n      enemies of the Christian name. In their suppliant address they\r\n      flattered the pride of the Latin princes; and, appealing at once\r\n      to their policy and religion, exhorted them to repel the\r\n      Barbarians on the confines of Asia, rather than to expect them in\r\n      the heart of Europe. At the sad tale of the misery and perils of\r\n      their Eastern brethren, the assembly burst into tears; the most\r\n      eager champions declared their readiness to march; and the Greek\r\n      ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and\r\n      powerful succor. The relief of Constantinople was included in the\r\n      larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem;\r\n      but the prudent Urban adjourned the final decision to a second\r\n      synod, which he proposed to celebrate in some city of France in\r\n      the autumn of the same year. The short delay would propagate the\r\n      flame of enthusiasm; and his firmest hope was in a nation of\r\n      soldiers 8 still proud of the preeminence of their name, and\r\n      ambitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne, 9 who, in the\r\n      popular romance of Turpin, 10 had achieved the conquest of the\r\n      Holy Land. A latent motive of affection or vanity might influence\r\n      the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of France, a monk of\r\n      Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended the throne\r\n      of St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and province;\r\n      nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to\r\n      revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious\r\n      scenes of our youth.\r\n\r\n      3 (return) [ Ultra quinquaginta millia, si me possunt in\r\n      expeditione pro duce et pontifice habere, armata manu volunt in\r\n      inimicos Dei insurgere et ad sepulchrum Domini ipso ducente\r\n      pervenire, (Gregor. vii. epist. ii. 31, in tom. xii. 322,\r\n      concil.)]\r\n\r\n      4 (return) [ See the original lives of Urban II. by Pandulphus\r\n      Pisanus and Bernardus Guido, in Muratori, Rer.

Latin Medii Aevi, edit.\r\n      Mansi, tom. iv. p. 161.)]\r\n\r\n      It may occasion some surprise that the Roman pontiff should\r\n      erect, in the heart of France, the tribunal from whence he hurled\r\n      his anathemas against the king; but our surprise will vanish so\r\n      soon as we form a just estimate of a king of France of the\r\n      eleventh century. 11 Philip the First was the great-grandson of\r\n      Hugh Capet, the founder of the present race, who, in the decline\r\n      of Charlemagne’s posterity, added the regal title to his\r\n      patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans. In this narrow compass,\r\n      he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the rest of\r\n      France, Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the\r\n      feudal lords of about sixty dukes and counts, of independent and\r\n      hereditary power, 12 who disdained the control of laws and legal\r\n      assemblies, and whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged\r\n      by the disobedience of their inferior vassals. At Clermont, in\r\n      the territories of the count of Auvergne, 13 the pope might brave\r\n      with impunity the resentment of Philip; and the council which he\r\n      convened in that city was not less numerous or respectable than\r\n      the synod of Placentia. 14 Besides his court and council of Roman\r\n      cardinals, he was supported by thirteen archbishops and two\r\n      hundred and twenty-five bishops: the number of mitred prelates\r\n      was computed at four hundred; and the fathers of the church were\r\n      blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the age.\r\n      From the adjacent kingdoms, a martial train of lords and knights\r\n      of power and renown attended the council, 15 in high expectation\r\n      of its resolves; and such was the ardor of zeal and curiosity,\r\n      that the city was filled, and many thousands, in the month of\r\n      November, erected their tents or huts in the open field. A\r\n      session of eight days produced some useful or edifying canons for\r\n      the reformation of manners; a severe censure was pronounced\r\n      against the license of private war; the Truce of God 16 was\r\n      confirmed, a suspension of hostilities during four days of the\r\n      week; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the\r\n      church; and a protection of three years was extended to\r\n      husbandmen and merchants, the defenceless victims of military\r\n      rapine. But a law, however venerable be the sanction, cannot\r\n      suddenly transform the temper of the times; and the benevolent\r\n      efforts of Urban deserve the less praise, since he labored to\r\n      appease some domestic quarrels that he might spread the flames of\r\n      war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the synod of\r\n      Placentia, the rumor of his great design had gone forth among the\r\n      nations: the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese\r\n      the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land; and when\r\n      the pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market-place of\r\n      Clermont, his eloquence was addressed to a well-prepared and\r\n      impatient audience. His topics were obvious, his exhortation was\r\n      vehement, his success inevitable. The orator was interrupted by\r\n      the shout of thousands, who with one voice, and in their rustic\r\n      idiom, exclaimed aloud, “God wills it, God wills it.” 17 “It is\r\n      indeed the will of God,” replied the pope; “and let this\r\n      memorable word, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be\r\n      forever adopted as your cry of battle, to animate the devotion\r\n      and courage of the champions of Christ. His cross is the symbol\r\n      of your salvation; wear it, a red, a bloody cross, as an external\r\n      mark, on your breasts or shoulders, as a pledge of your sacred\r\n      and irrevocable engagement.” The proposal was joyfully accepted;\r\n      great numbers, both of the clergy and laity, impressed on their\r\n      garments the sign of the cross, 18 and solicited the pope to\r\n      march at their head. This dangerous honor was declined by the\r\n      more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged the schism of the\r\n      church, and the duties of his pastoral office, recommending to\r\n      the faithful, who were disqualified by sex or profession, by age\r\n      or infirmity, to aid, with their prayers and alms, the personal\r\n      service of their robust brethren. The name and powers of his\r\n      legate he devolved on Adhemar bishop of Puy, the first who had\r\n      received the cross at his hands. The foremost of the temporal\r\n      chiefs was Raymond count of Thoulouse, whose ambassadors in the\r\n      council excused the absence, and pledged the honor, of their\r\n      master. After the confession and absolution of their sins, the\r\n      champions of the cross were dismissed with a superfluous\r\n      admonition to invite their countrymen and friends; and their\r\n      departure for the Holy Land was fixed to the festival of the\r\n      Assumption, the fifteenth of August, of the ensuing year. 19\r\n\r\n      11 (return) [ See Etat de la France, by the Count de\r\n      Boulainvilliers, tom. i. p. 180-182, and the second volume of the\r\n      Observations sur l’Histoire de France, by the Abbe de Mably.]\r\n\r\n      12 (return) [ In the provinces to the south of the Loire, the\r\n      first Capetians were scarcely allowed a feudal supremacy.

Michaud and\r\n      Wilken.—M.]\r\n\r\n      So familiar, and as it were so natural to man, is the practice of\r\n      violence, that our indulgence allows the slightest provocation,\r\n      the most disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national\r\n      hostility. But the name and nature of a holy war demands a more\r\n      rigorous scrutiny; nor can we hastily believe, that the servants\r\n      of the Prince of Peace would unsheathe the sword of destruction,\r\n      unless the motive were pure, the quarrel legitimate, and the\r\n      necessity inevitable. The policy of an action may be determined\r\n      from the tardy lessons of experience; but, before we act, our\r\n      conscience should be satisfied of the justice and propriety of\r\n      our enterprise. In the age of the crusades, the Christians, both\r\n      of the East and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and\r\n      merit; their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of\r\n      Scripture and rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of\r\n      natural and religious defence, their peculiar title to the Holy\r\n      Land, and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes. 20\r\n\r\n      I. The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and\r\n      spiritual allies: it depends on the existence of danger; and that\r\n      danger must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the\r\n      malice, and the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has\r\n      been imputed to the Mahometans, the duty of extirpating all other\r\n      religions by the sword. This charge of ignorance and bigotry is\r\n      refuted by the Koran, by the history of the Mussulman conquerors,\r\n      and by their public and legal toleration of the Christian\r\n      worship. But it cannot be denied, that the Oriental churches are\r\n      depressed under their iron yoke; that, in peace and war, they\r\n      assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal empire; and\r\n      that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations are\r\n      continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty. In\r\n      the eleventh century, the victorious arms of the Turks presented\r\n      a real and urgent apprehension of these losses. They had subdued,\r\n      in less than thirty years, the kingdoms of Asia, as far as\r\n      Jerusalem and the Hellespont; and the Greek empire tottered on\r\n      the verge of destruction. Besides an honest sympathy for their\r\n      brethren, the Latins had a right and interest in the support of\r\n      Constantinople, the most important barrier of the West; and the\r\n      privilege of defence must reach to prevent, as well as to repel,\r\n      an impending assault. But this salutary purpose might have been\r\n      accomplished by a moderate succor; and our calmer reason must\r\n      disclaim the innumerable hosts, and remote operations, which\r\n      overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe. 2011\r\n\r\n      20 (return) [ If the reader will turn to the first scene of the\r\n      First Part of Henry the Fourth, he will see in the text of\r\n      Shakespeare the natural feelings of enthusiasm; and in the notes\r\n      of Dr. Johnson the workings of a bigoted, though vigorous mind,\r\n      greedy of every pretence to hate and persecute those who dissent\r\n      from his creed.]\r\n\r\n      2011 (return) [ The manner in which the war was conducted surely\r\n      has little relation to the abstract question of the justice or\r\n      injustice of the war.

The question is, whether the\r\n      liberties and religion of Europe were in danger from the\r\n      aggressions of Mahometanism? If so, it is difficult to limit the\r\n      right, though it may be proper to question the wisdom, of\r\n      overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole\r\n      continent, and repelling, if possible, the invading conqueror\r\n      into his native deserts.

Vainly would it be alleged that the\r\n      preeminence of Jerusalem, and the sanctity of Palestine, have\r\n      been abolished with the Mosaic law; that the God of the\r\n      Christians is not a local deity, and that the recovery of Bethlem\r\n      or Calvary, his cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the\r\n      violation of the moral precepts of the gospel. Such arguments\r\n      glance aside from the leaden shield of superstition; and the\r\n      religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacred\r\n      ground of mystery and miracle.\r\n\r\n      III. But the holy wars which have been waged in every climate of\r\n      the globe, from Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to Hindostan,\r\n      require the support of some more general and flexible tenet. It\r\n      has been often supposed, and sometimes affirmed, that a\r\n      difference of religion is a worthy cause of hostility; that\r\n      obstinate unbelievers may be slain or subdued by the champions of\r\n      the cross; and that grace is the sole fountain of dominion as\r\n      well as of mercy. 2012 Above four hundred years before the first\r\n      crusade, the eastern and western provinces of the Roman empire\r\n      had been acquired about the same time, and in the same manner, by\r\n      the Barbarians of Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had\r\n      legitimated the conquest of the Christian Franks; but in the eyes\r\n      of their subjects and neighbors, the Mahometan princes were still\r\n      tyrants and usurpers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might\r\n      be lawfully driven from their unlawful possession. 21\r\n\r\n      2012 (return) [ “God,” says the abbot Guibert, “invented the\r\n      crusades as a new way for the laity to atone for their sins and\r\n      to merit salvation.” This extraordinary and characteristic\r\n      passage must be given entire. “Deus nostro tempore praelia sancta\r\n      instituit, ut ordo equestris et vulgus oberrans qui vetustae\r\n      Paganitatis exemplo in mutuas versabatur caedes, novum reperirent\r\n      salutis promerendae genus, ut nec funditus electa, ut fieri\r\n      assolet, monastica conversatione, seu religiosa qualibet\r\n      professione saeculum relinquere congerentur; sed sub consueta\r\n      licentia et habitu ex suo ipsorum officio Dei aliquantenus\r\n      gratiam consequerentur.” Guib.

In the primitive church, a\r\n      voluntary and open confession prepared the work of atonement. In\r\n      the middle ages, the bishops and priests interrogated the\r\n      criminal; compelled him to account for his thoughts, words, and\r\n      actions; and prescribed the terms of his reconciliation with God.\r\n      But as this discretionary power might alternately be abused by\r\n      indulgence and tyranny, a rule of discipline was framed, to\r\n      inform and regulate the spiritual judges. This mode of\r\n      legislation was invented by the Greeks; their penitentials 23\r\n      were translated, or imitated, in the Latin church; and, in the\r\n      time of Charlemagne, the clergy of every diocese were provided\r\n      with a code, which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of\r\n      the vulgar. In this dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments,\r\n      each case was supposed, each difference was remarked, by the\r\n      experience or penetration of the monks; some sins are enumerated\r\n      which innocence could not have suspected, and others which reason\r\n      cannot believe; and the more ordinary offences of fornication and\r\n      adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of rapine and murder, were\r\n      expiated by a penance, which, according to the various\r\n      circumstances, was prolonged from forty days to seven years.\r\n      During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the\r\n      criminal was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and\r\n      prayers: the disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and\r\n      remorse; and he humbly abstained from all the business and\r\n      pleasure of social life. But the rigid execution of these laws\r\n      would have depopulated the palace, the camp, and the city; the\r\n      Barbarians of the West believed and trembled; but nature often\r\n      rebelled against principle; and the magistrate labored without\r\n      effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. A literal\r\n      accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the guilt of\r\n      adultery was multiplied by daily repetition; that of homicide\r\n      might involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was\r\n      separately numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a\r\n      modest sinner might easily incur a debt of three hundred years.\r\n      His insolvency was relieved by a commutation, or indulgence: a\r\n      year of penance was appreciated at twenty-six solidi 24 of\r\n      silver, about four pounds sterling, for the rich; at three\r\n      solidi, or nine shillings, for the indigent: and these alms were\r\n      soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived, from\r\n      the redemption of sins, an inexhaustible source of opulence and\r\n      dominion. A debt of three hundred years, or twelve hundred\r\n      pounds, was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the\r\n      scarcity of gold and silver was supplied by the alienation of\r\n      land; and the princely donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are\r\n      expressly given for the remedy of their soul. It is a maxim of\r\n      the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay with his purse, must pay\r\n      with his body; and the practice of flagellation was adopted by\r\n      the monks, a cheap, though painful equivalent. By a fantastic\r\n      arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at three thousand lashes;\r\n      25 and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit, St.\r\n      Dominic of the iron Cuirass, 26 that in six days he could\r\n      discharge an entire century, by a whipping of three hundred\r\n      thousand stripes. His example was followed by many penitents of\r\n      both sexes; and, as a vicarious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy\r\n      disciplinarian might expiate on his own back the sins of his\r\n      benefactors. 27 These compensations of the purse and the person\r\n      introduced, in the eleventh century, a more honorable mode of\r\n      satisfaction. The merit of military service against the Saracens\r\n      of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors of Urban\r\n      the Second. In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed a\r\n      plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of\r\n      the cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt\r\n      for all that might be due of canonical penance. 28 The cold\r\n      philosophy of modern times is incapable of feeling the impression\r\n      that was made on a sinful and fanatic world. At the voice of\r\n      their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide, arose by\r\n      thousands to redeem their souls, by repeating on the infidels the\r\n      same deeds which they had exercised against their Christian\r\n      brethren; and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by\r\n      offenders of every rank and denomination. None were pure; none\r\n      were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and those who were\r\n      the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the\r\n      best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their\r\n      pious courage. If they fell, the spirit of the Latin clergy did\r\n      not hesitate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; 29\r\n      and should they survive, they could expect without impatience the\r\n      delay and increase of their heavenly reward. They offered their\r\n      blood to the Son of God, who had laid down his life for their\r\n      salvation: they took up the cross, and entered with confidence\r\n      into the way of the Lord. His providence would watch over their\r\n      safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous power would smooth the\r\n      difficulties of their holy enterprise. The cloud and pillar of\r\n      Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the promised land.\r\n      Might not the Christians more reasonably hope that the rivers\r\n      would open for their passage; that the walls of their strongest\r\n      cities would fall at the sound of their trumpets; and that the\r\n      sun would be arrested in his mid career, to allow them time for\r\n      the destruction of the infidels?\r\n\r\n      22 (return) [ The penance, indulgences, &c., of the middle ages\r\n      are amply discussed by Muratori, (Antiquitat.

But I am equally persuaded, that in many\r\n      it was not the sole, that in some it was not the leading,\r\n      principle of action. The use and abuse of religion are feeble to\r\n      stem, they are strong and irresistible to impel, the stream of\r\n      national manners. Against the private wars of the Barbarians,\r\n      their bloody tournaments, licentious love, and judicial duels,\r\n      the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more\r\n      easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to\r\n      drive into the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to\r\n      sanctify the patience of slaves and cowards, or to assume the\r\n      merit of the humanity and benevolence of modern Christians. War\r\n      and exercise were the reigning passions of the Franks or Latins;\r\n      they were enjoined, as a penance, to gratify those passions, to\r\n      visit distant lands, and to draw their swords against the nation\r\n      of the East. Their victory, or even their attempt, would\r\n      immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and\r\n      the purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid\r\n      prospect of military glory. In the petty quarrels of Europe, they\r\n      shed the blood of their friends and countrymen, for the\r\n      acquisition perhaps of a castle or a village. They could march\r\n      with alacrity against the distant and hostile nations who were\r\n      devoted to their arms; their fancy already grasped the golden\r\n      sceptres of Asia; and the conquest of Apulia and Sicily by the\r\n      Normans might exalt to royalty the hopes of the most private\r\n      adventurer. Christendom, in her rudest state, must have yielded\r\n      to the climate and cultivation of the Mahometan countries; and\r\n      their natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the\r\n      tales of pilgrims, and the gifts of an imperfect commerce. The\r\n      vulgar, both the great and small, were taught to believe every\r\n      wonder, of lands flowing with milk and honey, of mines and\r\n      treasures, of gold and diamonds, of palaces of marble and jasper,\r\n      and of odoriferous groves of cinnamon and frankincense. In this\r\n      earthly paradise, each warrior depended on his sword to carve a\r\n      plenteous and honorable establishment, which he measured only by\r\n      the extent of his wishes. 30 Their vassals and soldiers trusted\r\n      their fortunes to God and their master: the spoils of a Turkish\r\n      emir might enrich the meanest follower of the camp; and the\r\n      flavor of the wines, the beauty of the Grecian women, 31 were\r\n      temptations more adapted to the nature, than to the profession,\r\n      of the champions of the cross. The love of freedom was a powerful\r\n      incitement to the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or\r\n      ecclesiastical tyranny. Under this holy sign, the peasants and\r\n      burghers, who were attached to the servitude of the glebe, might\r\n      escape from a haughty lord, and transplant themselves and their\r\n      families to a land of liberty. The monk might release himself\r\n      from the discipline of his convent: the debtor might suspend the\r\n      accumulation of usury, and the pursuit of his creditors; and\r\n      outlaws and malefactors of every cast might continue to brave the\r\n      laws and elude the punishment of their crimes. 32\r\n\r\n      30 (return) [ The same hopes were displayed in the letters of the\r\n      adventurers ad animandos qui in Francia residerant.

The pope was their\r\n      perpetual guardian (Ducange, tom. ii. p. 651, 652.)]\r\n\r\n      These motives were potent and numerous: when we have singly\r\n      computed their weight on the mind of each individual, we must add\r\n      the infinite series, the multiplying powers, of example and\r\n      fashion. The first proselytes became the warmest and most\r\n      effectual missionaries of the cross: among their friends and\r\n      countrymen they preached the duty, the merit, and the recompense,\r\n      of their holy vow; and the most reluctant hearers were insensibly\r\n      drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and authority. The\r\n      martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion of\r\n      cowardice; the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre\r\n      of Christ was embraced by the old and infirm, by women and\r\n      children, who consulted rather their zeal than their strength;\r\n      and those who in the evening had derided the folly of their\r\n      companions, were the most eager, the ensuing day, to tread in\r\n      their footsteps. The ignorance, which magnified the hopes,\r\n      diminished the perils, of the enterprise. Since the Turkish\r\n      conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated; the chiefs\r\n      themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way and\r\n      the state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the\r\n      people, that, at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the\r\n      limits of their knowledge, they were ready to ask whether that\r\n      was not the Jerusalem, the term and object of their labors. Yet\r\n      the more prudent of the crusaders, who were not sure that they\r\n      should be fed from heaven with a shower of quails or manna,\r\n      provided themselves with those precious metals, which, in every\r\n      country, are the representatives of every commodity. To defray,\r\n      according to their rank, the expenses of the road, princes\r\n      alienated their provinces, nobles their lands and castles,\r\n      peasants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry. The value\r\n      of property was depreciated by the eager competition of\r\n      multitudes; while the price of arms and horses was raised to an\r\n      exorbitant height by the wants and impatience of the buyers. 33\r\n      Those who remained at home, with sense and money, were enriched\r\n      by the epidemical disease: the sovereigns acquired at a cheap\r\n      rate the domains of their vassals; and the ecclesiastical\r\n      purchasers completed the payment by the assurance of their\r\n      prayers. The cross, which was commonly sewed on the garment, in\r\n      cloth or silk, was inscribed by some zealots on their skin: a hot\r\n      iron, or indelible liquor, was applied to perpetuate the mark;\r\n      and a crafty monk, who showed the miraculous impression on his\r\n      breast was repaid with the popular veneration and the richest\r\n      benefices of Palestine. 34\r\n\r\n      33 (return) [ Guibert (p. 481) paints in lively colors this\r\n      general emotion.

Early in the spring, from the confines of France and\r\n      Lorraine, above sixty thousand of the populace of both sexes\r\n      flocked round the first missionary of the crusade, and pressed\r\n      him with clamorous importunity to lead them to the holy\r\n      sepulchre. The hermit, assuming the character, without the\r\n      talents or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the\r\n      forward impulse of his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and\r\n      Danube. Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate,\r\n      and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, a valiant though needy\r\n      soldier, conducted a van guard of pilgrims, whose condition may\r\n      be determined from the proportion of eight horsemen to fifteen\r\n      thousand foot. The example and footsteps of Peter were closely\r\n      pursued by another fanatic, the monk Godescal, whose sermons had\r\n      swept away fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the villages\r\n      of Germany. Their rear was again pressed by a herd of two hundred\r\n      thousand, the most stupid and savage refuse of the people, who\r\n      mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine,\r\n      prostitution, and drunkenness. Some counts and gentlemen, at the\r\n      head of three thousand horse, attended the motions of the\r\n      multitude to partake in the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may\r\n      we credit such folly?) were a goose and a goat, who were carried\r\n      in the front, and to whom these worthy Christians ascribed an\r\n      infusion of the divine spirit. 35 Of these, and of other bands of\r\n      enthusiasts, the first and most easy warfare was against the\r\n      Jews, the murderers of the Son of God. In the trading cities of\r\n      the Moselle and the Rhine, their colonies were numerous and rich;\r\n      and they enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor and the\r\n      bishops, the free exercise of their religion. 36 At Verdun,\r\n      Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many thousands of that unhappy\r\n      people were pillaged and massacred: 37 nor had they felt a more\r\n      bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian. A remnant was\r\n      saved by the firmness of their bishops, who accepted a feigned\r\n      and transient conversion; but the more obstinate Jews opposed\r\n      their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the Christians, barricadoed\r\n      their houses, and precipitating themselves, their families, and\r\n      their wealth, into the rivers or the flames, disappointed the\r\n      malice, or at least the avarice, of their implacable foes.\r\n\r\n      35 (return) [ Fuit et aliud scelus detestabile in hac\r\n      congregatione pedestris populi stulti et vesanae levitatis,\r\n      anserem quendam divino spiritu asserebant afflatum, et capellam\r\n      non minus eodem repletam, et has sibi duces secundae viae\r\n      fecerant, &c., (Albert.

The soil is fruitful, and intersected with rivers;\r\n      but it was then covered with morasses and forests, which spread\r\n      to a boundless extent, whenever man has ceased to exercise his\r\n      dominion over the earth. Both nations had imbibed the rudiments\r\n      of Christianity; the Hungarians were ruled by their native\r\n      princes; the Bulgarians by a lieutenant of the Greek emperor;\r\n      but, on the slightest provocation, their ferocious nature was\r\n      rekindled, and ample provocation was afforded by the disorders of\r\n      the first pilgrims Agriculture must have been unskilful and\r\n      languid among a people, whose cities were built of reeds and\r\n      timber, which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of\r\n      hunters and shepherds. A scanty supply of provisions was rudely\r\n      demanded, forcibly seized, and greedily consumed; and on the\r\n      first quarrel, the crusaders gave a loose to indignation and\r\n      revenge. But their ignorance of the country, of war, and of\r\n      discipline, exposed them to every snare. The Greek praefect of\r\n      Bulgaria commanded a regular force; 381 at the trumpet of the\r\n      Hungarian king, the eighth or the tenth of his martial subjects\r\n      bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was\r\n      insidious, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was\r\n      unrelenting and bloody. 39 About a third of the naked fugitives\r\n      (and the hermit Peter was of the number) escaped to the Thracian\r\n      mountains; and the emperor, who respected the pilgrimage and\r\n      succor of the Latins, conducted them by secure and easy journeys\r\n      to Constantinople, and advised them to await the arrival of their\r\n      brethren. For a while they remembered their faults and losses;\r\n      but no sooner were they revived by the hospitable entertainment,\r\n      than their venom was again inflamed; they stung their benefactor,\r\n      and neither gardens, nor palaces, nor churches, were safe from\r\n      their depredations. For his own safety, Alexius allured them to\r\n      pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; but their blind\r\n      impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had\r\n      assigned, and to rush headlong against the Turks, who occupied\r\n      the road to Jerusalem. The hermit, conscious of his shame, had\r\n      withdrawn from the camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant,\r\n      Walter the Penniless, who was worthy of a better command,\r\n      attempted without success to introduce some order and prudence\r\n      among the herd of savages.

The emperor Henry the Fourth was not disposed\r\n      to obey the summons of the pope: Philip the First of France was\r\n      occupied by his pleasures; William Rufus of England by a recent\r\n      conquest; the kin`gs of Spain were engaged in a domestic war\r\n      against the Moors; and the northern monarchs of Scotland,\r\n      Denmark, 42 Sweden, and Poland, were yet strangers to the\r\n      passions and interests of the South. The religious ardor was more\r\n      strongly felt by the princes of the second order, who held an\r\n      important place in the feudal system. Their situation will\r\n      naturally cast under four distinct heads the review of their\r\n      names and characters; but I may escape some needless repetition,\r\n      by observing at once, that courage and the exercise of arms are\r\n      the common attribute of these Christian adventurers. I. The first\r\n      rank both in war and council is justly due to Godfrey of\r\n      Bouillon; and happy would it have been for the crusaders, if they\r\n      had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of that accomplished\r\n      hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from whom he was\r\n      descended in the female line. His father was of the noble race of\r\n      the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine,\r\n      43 was the inheritance of his mother; and by the emperor’s bounty\r\n      he was himself invested with that ducal title, which has been\r\n      improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the\r\n      Ardennes. 44 In the service of Henry the Fourth, he bore the\r\n      great standard of the empire, and pierced with his lance the\r\n      breast of Rodolph, the rebel king: Godfrey was the first who\r\n      ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow, perhaps\r\n      his remorse for bearing arms against the pope, confirmed an early\r\n      resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as a pilgrim, but\r\n      a deliverer. His valor was matured by prudence and moderation;\r\n      his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult of a\r\n      camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent.\r\n      Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his\r\n      enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom\r\n      by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged\r\n      by his rivals. Godfrey of Bouillon 45 was accompanied by his two\r\n      brothers, by Eustace the elder, who had succeeded to the county\r\n      of Boulogne, and by the younger, Baldwin, a character of more\r\n      ambiguous virtue. The duke of Lorraine, was alike celebrated on\r\n      either side of the Rhine: from his birth and education, he was\r\n      equally conversant with the French and Teutonic languages: the\r\n      barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine, assembled their vassals;\r\n      and the confederate force that marched under his banner was\r\n      composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten thousand horse.\r\n      II. In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the king’s\r\n      presence, about two months after the council of Clermont, Hugh,\r\n      count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes who\r\n      assumed the cross. But the appellation of the Great was applied,\r\n      not so much to his merit or possessions, (though neither were\r\n      contemptible,) as to the royal birth of the brother of the king\r\n      of France. 46 Robert, duke of Normandy, was the eldest son of\r\n      William the Conqueror; but on his father’s death he was deprived\r\n      of the kingdom of England, by his own indolence and the activity\r\n      of his brother Rufus. The worth of Robert was degraded by an\r\n      excessive levity and easiness of temper: his cheerfulness seduced\r\n      him to the indulgence of pleasure; his profuse liberality\r\n      impoverished the prince and people; his indiscriminate clemency\r\n      multiplied the number of offenders; and the amiable qualities of\r\n      a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign. For\r\n      the trifling sum of ten thousand marks, he mortgaged Normandy\r\n      during his absence to the English usurper; 47 but his engagement\r\n      and behavior in the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of\r\n      manners, and restored him in some degree to the public esteem.\r\n      Another Robert was count of Flanders, a royal province, which, in\r\n      this century, gave three queens to the thrones of France,\r\n      England, and Denmark: he was surnamed the Sword and Lance of the\r\n      Christians; but in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot\r\n      the duties of a general. Stephen, count of Chartres, of Blois,\r\n      and of Troyes, was one of the richest princes of the age; and the\r\n      number of his castles has been compared to the three hundred and\r\n      sixty-five days of the year. His mind was improved by literature;\r\n      and, in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent Stephen 48 was\r\n      chosen to discharge the office of their president. These four\r\n      were the principal leaders of the French, the Normans, and the\r\n      pilgrims of the British isles: but the list of the barons who\r\n      were possessed of three or four towns would exceed, says a\r\n      contemporary, the catalogue of the Trojan war. 49 III. In the\r\n      south of France, the command was assumed by Adhemar bishop of\r\n      Puy, the pope egate, and by Raymond count of St. Giles and\r\n      Thoulouse who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne and\r\n      marquis of Provence. The former was a respectable prelate, alike\r\n      qualified for this world and the next. The latter was a veteran\r\n      warrior, who had fought against the Saracens of Spain, and who\r\n      consecrated his declining age, not only to the deliverance, but\r\n      to the perpetual service, of the holy sepulchre. His experience\r\n      and riches gave him a strong ascendant in the Christian camp,\r\n      whose distress he was often able, and sometimes willing, to\r\n      relieve. But it was easier for him to extort the praise of the\r\n      Infidels, than to preserve the love of his subjects and\r\n      associates. His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper\r\n      haughty, envious, and obstinate; and, though he resigned an ample\r\n      patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, in the public opinion,\r\n      was not exempt from avarice and ambition. 50 A mercantile, rather\r\n      than a martial, spirit prevailed among his provincials, 51 a\r\n      common name, which included the natives of Auvergne and\r\n      Languedoc, 52 the vassals of the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles.\r\n      From the adjacent frontier of Spain he drew a band of hardy\r\n      adventurers; as he marched through Lombardy, a crowd of Italians\r\n      flocked to his standard, and his united force consisted of one\r\n      hundred thousand horse and foot. If Raymond was the first to\r\n      enlist and the last to depart, the delay may be excused by the\r\n      greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting\r\n      farewell. IV. The name of Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard,\r\n      was already famous by his double victory over the Greek emperor;\r\n      but his father’s will had reduced him to the principality of\r\n      Tarentum, and the remembrance of his Eastern trophies, till he\r\n      was awakened by the rumor and passage of the French pilgrims. It\r\n      is in the person of this Norman chief that we may seek for the\r\n      coolest policy and ambition, with a small allay of religious\r\n      fanaticism. His conduct may justify a belief that he had secretly\r\n      directed the design of the pope, which he affected to second with\r\n      astonishment and zeal: at the siege of Amalphi, his example and\r\n      discourse inflamed the passions of a confederate army; he\r\n      instantly tore his garment to supply crosses for the numerous\r\n      candidates, and prepared to visit Constantinople and Asia at the\r\n      head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Several\r\n      princes of the Norman race accompanied this veteran general; and\r\n      his cousin Tancred 53 was the partner, rather than the servant,\r\n      of the war.\r\n\r\n      In the accomplished character of Tancred we discover all the\r\n      virtues of a perfect knight, 54 the true spirit of chivalry,\r\n      which inspired the generous sentiments and social offices of man\r\n      far better than the base philosophy, or the baser religion, of\r\n      the times.\r\n\r\n      42 (return) [ The author of the Esprit des Croisades has doubted,\r\n      and might have disbelieved, the crusade and tragic death of\r\n      Prince Sueno, with 1500 or 15,000 Danes, who was cut off by\r\n      Sultan Soliman in Cappadocia, but who still lives in the poem of\r\n      Tasso, (tom. iv. p. 111-115.)]\r\n\r\n      43 (return) [ The fragments of the kingdoms of Lotharingia, or\r\n      Lorraine, were broken into the two duchies of the Moselle and of\r\n      the Meuse: the first has preserved its name, which in the latter\r\n      has been changed into that of Brabant, (Vales.

The dignity of their birth was preserved\r\n      by pure and equal alliances; their sons alone, who could produce\r\n      four quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach,\r\n      might legally pretend to the honor of knighthood; but a valiant\r\n      plebeian was sometimes enriched and ennobled by the sword, and\r\n      became the father of a new race. A single knight could impart,\r\n      according to his judgment, the character which he received; and\r\n      the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this\r\n      personal distinction than from the lustre of their diadem. This\r\n      ceremony, of which some traces may be found in Tacitus and the\r\n      woods of Germany, 56 was in its origin simple and profane; the\r\n      candidate, after some previous trial, was invested with the sword\r\n      and spurs; and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight\r\n      blow, as an emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for\r\n      him to endure. But superstition mingled in every public and\r\n      private action of life: in the holy wars, it sanctified the\r\n      profession of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in\r\n      its rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The\r\n      bath and white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the\r\n      regeneration of baptism: his sword, which he offered on the\r\n      altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion: his solemn\r\n      reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created a\r\n      knight in the name of God, of St. George, and of St. Michael the\r\n      archangel. He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession;\r\n      and education, example, and the public opinion, were the\r\n      inviolable guardians of his oath. As the champion of God and the\r\n      ladies, (I blush to unite such discordant names,) he devoted\r\n      himself to speak the truth; to maintain the right; to protect the\r\n      distressed; to practise courtesy, a virtue less familiar to the\r\n      ancients; to pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of\r\n      ease and safety; and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the\r\n      honor of his character. The abuse of the same spirit provoked the\r\n      illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry and peace; to\r\n      esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own injuries;\r\n      and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military\r\n      discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the\r\n      temper of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith,\r\n      justice, and humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often\r\n      observed. The asperity of national prejudice was softened; and\r\n      the community of religion and arms spread a similar color and\r\n      generous emulation over the face of Christendom. Abroad in\r\n      enterprise and pilgrimage, at home in martial exercise, the\r\n      warriors of every country were perpetually associated; and\r\n      impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic\r\n      games of classic antiquity. 57 Instead of the naked spectacles\r\n      which corrupted the manners of the Greeks, and banished from the\r\n      stadium the virgins and matrons, the pompous decoration of the\r\n      lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and high-born\r\n      beauty, from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his\r\n      dexterity and courage. The skill and strength that were exerted\r\n      in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to\r\n      the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments, as they were\r\n      invented in France, and eagerly adopted both in the East and\r\n      West, presented a lively image of the business of the field. The\r\n      single combats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass, or\r\n      castle, were rehearsed as in actual service; and the contest,\r\n      both in real and mimic war, was decided by the superior\r\n      management of the horse and lance. The lance was the proper and\r\n      peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was of a large and heavy\r\n      breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the approaching\r\n      danger, was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode a\r\n      pad or palfrey of a more easy pace. His helmet and sword, his\r\n      greaves and buckler, it would be superfluous to describe; but I\r\n      may remark, that, at the period of the crusades, the armor was\r\n      less ponderous than in later times; and that, instead of a massy\r\n      cuirass, his breast was defended by a hauberk or coat of mail.\r\n      When their long lances were fixed in the rest, the warriors\r\n      furiously spurred their horses against the foe; and the light\r\n      cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand against the\r\n      direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each knight was\r\n      attended to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal\r\n      birth and similar hopes; he was followed by his archers and men\r\n      at arms, and four, or five, or six soldiers were computed as the\r\n      furniture of a complete lance. In the expeditions to the\r\n      neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land, the duties of the feudal\r\n      tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary service of the knights\r\n      and their followers were either prompted by zeal or attachment,\r\n      or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers of each\r\n      squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the fame, of\r\n      each independent chieftain. They were distinguished by his\r\n      banner, his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most\r\n      ancient families of Europe must seek in these achievements the\r\n      origin and proof of their nobility. In this rapid portrait of\r\n      chivalry I have been urged to anticipate on the story of the\r\n      crusades, at once an effect and a cause, of this memorable\r\n      institution. 58\r\n\r\n      55 (return) [ Of the words gentilis, gentilhomme, gentleman, two\r\n      etymologies are produced: 1.

As soon as they were\r\n      relieved by the absence of the plebeian multitude, they\r\n      encouraged each other, by interviews and messages, to accomplish\r\n      their vow, and hasten their departure. Their wives and sisters\r\n      were desirous of partaking the danger and merit of the\r\n      pilgrimage: their portable treasures were conveyed in bars of\r\n      silver and gold; and the princes and barons were attended by\r\n      their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to\r\n      supply their table. The difficulty of procuring subsistence for\r\n      so many myriads of men and horses engaged them to separate their\r\n      forces: their choice or situation determined the road; and it was\r\n      agreed to meet in the neighborhood of Constantinople, and from\r\n      thence to begin their operations against the Turks. From the\r\n      banks of the Meuse and the Moselle, Godfrey of Bouillon followed\r\n      the direct way of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as\r\n      he exercised the sole command every step afforded some proof of\r\n      his prudence and virtue. On the confines of Hungary he was\r\n      stopped three weeks by a Christian people, to whom the name, or\r\n      at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odious. The\r\n      Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had received\r\n      from the first pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the right\r\n      of defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend a\r\n      severe revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was\r\n      engaged in the same cause. But, after weighing the motives and\r\n      the events, the virtuous duke was content to pity the crimes and\r\n      misfortunes of his worthless brethren; and his twelve deputies,\r\n      the messengers of peace, requested in his name a free passage and\r\n      an equal market. To remove their suspicions, Godfrey trusted\r\n      himself, and afterwards his brother, to the faith of Carloman,\r\n      581 king of Hungary, who treated them with a simple but\r\n      hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their\r\n      common gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death,\r\n      restrained the animosity and license of the Latin soldiers. From\r\n      Austria to Belgrade, they traversed the plains of Hungary,\r\n      without enduring or offering an injury; and the proximity of\r\n      Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his numerous cavalry,\r\n      was a precaution not less useful for their safety than for his\r\n      own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had they\r\n      passed the river, than the king of Hungary restored the hostages,\r\n      and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the\r\n      success of their enterprise. With the same conduct and\r\n      discipline, Godfrey pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the\r\n      frontiers of Thrace; and might congratulate himself that he had\r\n      almost reached the first term of his pilgrimage, without drawing\r\n      his sword against a Christian adversary. After an easy and\r\n      pleasant journey through Lombardy, from Turin to Aquileia,\r\n      Raymond and his provincials marched forty days through the savage\r\n      country of Dalmatia 59 and Sclavonia. The weather was a perpetual\r\n      fog; the land was mountainous and desolate; the natives were\r\n      either fugitive or hostile: loose in their religion and\r\n      government, they refused to furnish provisions or guides;\r\n      murdered the stragglers; and exercised by night and day the\r\n      vigilance of the count, who derived more security from the\r\n      punishment of some captive robbers than from his interview and\r\n      treaty with the prince of Scodra. 60 His march between Durazzo\r\n      and Constantinople was harassed, without being stopped, by the\r\n      peasants and soldiers of the Greek emperor; and the same faint\r\n      and ambiguous hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs,\r\n      who passed the Adriatic from the coast of Italy. Bohemond had\r\n      arms and vessels, and foresight and discipline; and his name was\r\n      not forgotten in the provinces of Epirus and Thessaly. Whatever\r\n      obstacles he encountered were surmounted by his military conduct\r\n      and the valor of Tancred; and if the Norman prince affected to\r\n      spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers with the full plunder of\r\n      an heretical castle. 61 The nobles of France pressed forwards\r\n      with the vain and thoughtless ardor of which their nation has\r\n      been sometimes accused. From the Alps to Apulia the march of Hugh\r\n      the Great, of the two Roberts, and of Stephen of Chartres,\r\n      through a wealthy country, and amidst the applauding Catholics,\r\n      was a devout or triumphant progress: they kissed the feet of the\r\n      Roman pontiff; and the golden standard of St. Peter was delivered\r\n      to the brother of the French monarch. 62 But in this visit of\r\n      piety and pleasure, they neglected to secure the season, and the\r\n      means of their embarkation: the winter was insensibly lost: their\r\n      troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns of Italy. They\r\n      separately accomplished their passage, regardless of safety or\r\n      dignity; and within nine months from the feast of the Assumption,\r\n      the day appointed by Urban, all the Latin princes had reached\r\n      Constantinople. But the count of Vermandois was produced as a\r\n      captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; and\r\n      his person, against the law of nations, was detained by the\r\n      lieutenants of Alexius. Yet the arrival of Hugh had been\r\n      announced by four-and-twenty knights in golden armor, who\r\n      commanded the emperor to revere the general of the Latin\r\n      Christians, the brother of the king of kings. 63 631\r\n\r\n      581 (return) [ Carloman (or Calmany) demanded the brother of\r\n      Godfrey as hostage but Count Baldwin refused the humiliating\r\n      submission.

Such was the\r\n      fortune, or at least the apprehension of the Greek emperor\r\n      Alexius Comnenus, whose name has already appeared in this\r\n      history, and whose conduct is so differently represented by his\r\n      daughter Anne, 64 and by the Latin writers. 65 In the council of\r\n      Placentia, his ambassadors had solicited a moderate succor,\r\n      perhaps of ten thousand soldiers, but he was astonished by the\r\n      approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations. The\r\n      emperor fluctuated between hope and fear, between timidity and\r\n      courage; but in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom, I\r\n      cannot believe, I cannot discern, that he maliciously conspired\r\n      against the life or honor of the French heroes. The promiscuous\r\n      multitudes of Peter the Hermit were savage beasts, alike\r\n      destitute of humanity and reason: nor was it possible for Alexius\r\n      to prevent or deplore their destruction. The troops of Godfrey\r\n      and his peers were less contemptible, but not less suspicious, to\r\n      the Greek emperor. Their motives might be pure and pious: but he\r\n      was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond,\r\n      651 and his ignorance of the Transalpine chiefs: the courage of\r\n      the French was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the\r\n      luxury and wealth of Greece, and elated by the view and opinion\r\n      of their invincible strength: and Jerusalem might be forgotten in\r\n      the prospect of Constantinople. After a long march and painful\r\n      abstinence, the troops of Godfrey encamped in the plains of\r\n      Thrace; they heard with indignation, that their brother, the\r\n      count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the Greeks; and their\r\n      reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some freedom of\r\n      retaliation and rapine. They were appeased by the submission of\r\n      Alexius: he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused,\r\n      in the midst of winter, to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters\r\n      were assigned among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that\r\n      narrow sea. But an incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds\r\n      of the two nations, who despised each other as slaves and\r\n      Barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, and suspicion\r\n      was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice is blind, hunger\r\n      is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault\r\n      the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the\r\n      waters. 66 Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net,\r\n      overspread the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of\r\n      Constantinople were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined\r\n      with archers; and, after a doubtful conflict, both parties\r\n      listened to the voice of peace and religion. The gifts and\r\n      promises of the emperor insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of\r\n      the western strangers; as a Christian warrior, he rekindled their\r\n      zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which he\r\n      engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of\r\n      spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful\r\n      camp in Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus, than the\r\n      Greek vessels were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The\r\n      same policy was repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were\r\n      swayed by the example, and weakened by the departure, of their\r\n      foremost companions. By his skill and diligence, Alexius\r\n      prevented the union of any two of the confederate armies at the\r\n      same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before the\r\n      feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast\r\n      of Europe.\r\n\r\n      64 (return) [ Anna Comnena was born the 1st of December, A.D.\r\n      1083, indiction vii., (Alexiad. l. vi. p. 166, 167.)

The fair provinces from Nice to Antioch were the\r\n      recent patrimony of the Roman emperor; and his ancient and\r\n      perpetual claim still embraced the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt.\r\n      In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged, or affected, the ambitious\r\n      hope of leading his new allies to subvert the thrones of the\r\n      East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded him\r\n      from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and\r\n      lawless Barbarians. His prudence, or his pride, was content with\r\n      extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and fidelity,\r\n      and a solemn promise, that they\r\n\r\n      would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests as the\r\n      humble and loyal vassals of the Roman empire. Their independent\r\n      spirit was fired at the mention of this foreign and voluntary\r\n      servitude: they successively yielded to the dexterous application\r\n      of gifts and flattery; and the first proselytes became the most\r\n      eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply the companions of\r\n      their shame. The pride of Hugh of Vermandois was soothed by the\r\n      honors of his captivity; and in the brother of the French king,\r\n      the example of submission was prevalent and weighty.

He had firmly\r\n      resisted the temptations of Bohemond and Raymond, who urged the\r\n      attack and conquest of Constantinople. Alexius esteemed his\r\n      virtues, deservedly named him the champion of the empire, and\r\n      dignified his homage with the filial name and the rights of\r\n      adoption. 67 The hateful Bohemond was received as a true and\r\n      ancient ally; and if the emperor reminded him of former\r\n      hostilities, it was only to praise the valor that he had\r\n      displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of\r\n      Durazzo and Larissa. The son of Guiscard was lodged and\r\n      entertained, and served with Imperial pomp: one day, as he passed\r\n      through the gallery of the palace, a door was carelessly left\r\n      open to expose a pile of gold and silver, of silk and gems, of\r\n      curious and costly furniture, that was heaped, in seeming\r\n      disorder, from the floor to the roof of the chamber. “What\r\n      conquests,” exclaimed the ambitious miser, “might not be achieved\r\n      by the possession of such a treasure!”—“It is your own,” replied\r\n      a Greek attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and\r\n      Bohemond, after some hesitation, condescended to accept this\r\n      magnificent present. The Norman was flattered by the assurance of\r\n      an independent principality; and Alexius eluded, rather than\r\n      denied, his daring demand of the office of great domestic, or\r\n      general of the East. The two Roberts, the son of the conqueror of\r\n      England, and the kinsmen of three queens, 68 bowed in their turn\r\n      before the Byzantine throne. A private letter of Stephen of\r\n      Chartres attests his admiration of the emperor, the most\r\n      excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to believe that he\r\n      was a favorite, and promised to educate and establish his\r\n      youngest son. In his southern province, the count of St. Giles\r\n      and Thoulouse faintly recognized the supremacy of the king of\r\n      France, a prince of a foreign nation and language. At the head of\r\n      a hundred thousand men, he declared that he was the soldier and\r\n      servant of Christ alone, and that the Greek might be satisfied\r\n      with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship. His obstinate\r\n      resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission;\r\n      and he shone, says the princess Anne, among the Barbarians, as\r\n      the sun amidst the stars of heaven. His disgust of the noise and\r\n      insolence of the French, his suspicions of the designs of\r\n      Bohemond, the emperor imparted to his faithful Raymond; and that\r\n      aged statesman might clearly discern, that however false in\r\n      friendship, he was sincere in his enmity. 69 The spirit of\r\n      chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred; and none\r\n      could deem themselves dishonored by the imitation of that gallant\r\n      knight. He disdained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch;\r\n      assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician; escaped to Asia\r\n      in the habit of a private soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the\r\n      authority of Bohemond, and the interest of the Christian cause.\r\n      The best and most ostensible reason was the impossibility of\r\n      passing the sea and accomplishing their vow, without the license\r\n      and the vessels of Alexius; but they cherished a secret hope,\r\n      that as soon as they trod the continent of Asia, their swords\r\n      would obliterate their shame, and dissolve the engagement, which\r\n      on his side might not be very faithfully performed. The ceremony\r\n      of their homage was grateful to a people who had long since\r\n      considered pride as the substitute of power. High on his throne,\r\n      the emperor sat mute and immovable: his majesty was adored by the\r\n      Latin princes; and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his\r\n      knees, an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to\r\n      confess and unable to deny. 70\r\n\r\n      67 (return) [ There are two sorts of adoption, the one by arms,\r\n      the other by introducing the son between the shirt and skin of\r\n      his father.

Yet, since the heroes knelt\r\n      to salute the emperor, as he sat motionless on his throne, it is\r\n      clear that they must have kissed either his feet or knees. It is\r\n      only singular, that Anna should not have amply supplied the\r\n      silence or ambiguity of the Latins.

The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to\r\n      exclaim, in his barbarous idiom, “Who is this rustic, that keeps\r\n      his seat, while so many valiant captains are standing round him?”\r\n      The emperor maintained his silence, dissembled his indignation,\r\n      and questioned his interpreter concerning the meaning of the\r\n      words, which he partly suspected from the universal language of\r\n      gesture and countenance. Before the departure of the pilgrims, he\r\n      endeavored to learn the name and condition of the audacious\r\n      baron. “I am a Frenchman,” replied Robert, “of the purest and\r\n      most ancient nobility of my country. All that I know is, that\r\n      there is a church in my neighborhood, 72 the resort of those who\r\n      are desirous of approving their valor in single combat. Till an\r\n      enemy appears, they address their prayers to God and his saints.\r\n      That church I have frequently visited. But never have I found an\r\n      antagonist who dared to accept my defiance.” Alexius dismissed\r\n      the challenger with some prudent advice for his conduct in the\r\n      Turkish warfare; and history repeats with pleasure this lively\r\n      example of the manners of his age and country.\r\n\r\n      71 (return) [ He called himself (see Alexias, l. x. p. 301.)

The principal force of the crusaders consisted in their\r\n      cavalry; and when that force was mustered in the plains of\r\n      Bithynia, the knights and their martial attendants on horseback\r\n      amounted to one hundred thousand fighting men, completely armed\r\n      with the helmet and coat of mail. The value of these soldiers\r\n      deserved a strict and authentic account; and the flower of\r\n      European chivalry might furnish, in a first effort, this\r\n      formidable body of heavy horse. A part of the infantry might be\r\n      enrolled for the service of scouts, pioneers, and archers; but\r\n      the promiscuous crowd were lost in their own disorder; and we\r\n      depend not on the eyes and knowledge, but on the belief and\r\n      fancy, of a chaplain of Count Baldwin, 74 in the estimate of six\r\n      hundred thousand pilgrims able to bear arms, besides the priests\r\n      and monks, the women and children of the Latin camp. The reader\r\n      starts; and before he is recovered from his surprise, I shall\r\n      add, on the same testimony, that if all who took the cross had\r\n      accomplished their vow, above six millions would have migrated\r\n      from Europe to Asia. Under this oppression of faith, I derive\r\n      some relief from a more sagacious and thinking writer, 75 who,\r\n      after the same review of the cavalry, accuses the credulity of\r\n      the priest of Chartres, and even doubts whether the Cisalpine\r\n      regions (in the geography of a Frenchman) were sufficient to\r\n      produce and pour forth such incredible multitudes. The coolest\r\n      scepticism will remember, that of these religious volunteers\r\n      great numbers never beheld Constantinople and Nice. Of enthusiasm\r\n      the influence is irregular and transient: many were detained at\r\n      home by reason or cowardice, by poverty or weakness; and many\r\n      were repulsed by the obstacles of the way, the more insuperable\r\n      as they were unforeseen, to these ignorant fanatics. The savage\r\n      countries of Hungary and Bulgaria were whitened with their bones:\r\n      their vanguard was cut in pieces by the Turkish sultan; and the\r\n      loss of the first adventure, by the sword, or climate, or\r\n      fatigue, has already been stated at three hundred thousand men.\r\n      Yet the myriads that survived, that marched, that pressed\r\n      forwards on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment\r\n      to themselves and to the Greeks. The copious energy of her\r\n      language sinks under the efforts of the princess Anne: 76 the\r\n      images of locusts, of leaves and flowers, of the sands of the\r\n      sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly represent what she had\r\n      seen and heard; and the daughter of Alexius exclaims, that Europe\r\n      was loosened from its foundations, and hurled against Asia. The\r\n      ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labor under the same doubt of\r\n      a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am inclined to believe,\r\n      that a larger number has never been contained within the lines of\r\n      a single camp, than at the siege of Nice, the first operation of\r\n      the Latin princes. Their motives, their characters, and their\r\n      arms, have been already displayed. Of their troops the most\r\n      numerous portion were natives of France: the Low Countries, the\r\n      banks of the Rhine, and Apulia, sent a powerful reenforcement:\r\n      some bands of adventurers were drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and\r\n      England; 77 and from the distant bogs and mountains of Ireland or\r\n      Scotland 78 issued some naked and savage fanatics, ferocious at\r\n      home but unwarlike abroad. Had not superstition condemned the\r\n      sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest\r\n      Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage, the useless crowd, with\r\n      mouths but without hands, might have been stationed in the Greek\r\n      empire, till their companions had opened and secured the way of\r\n      the Lord. A small remnant of the pilgrims, who passed the\r\n      Bosphorus, was permitted to visit the holy sepulchre. Their\r\n      northern constitution was scorched by the rays, and infected by\r\n      the vapors, of a Syrian sun. They consumed, with heedless\r\n      prodigality, their stores of water and provision: their numbers\r\n      exhausted the inland country: the sea was remote, the Greeks were\r\n      unfriendly, and the Christians of every sect fled before the\r\n      voracious and cruel rapine of their brethren. In the dire\r\n      necessity of famine, they sometimes roasted and devoured the\r\n      flesh of their infant or adult captives. Among the Turks and\r\n      Saracens, the idolaters of Europe were rendered more odious by\r\n      the name and reputation of Cannibals; the spies, who introduced\r\n      themselves into the kitchen of Bohemond, were shown several human\r\n      bodies turning on the spit: and the artful Norman encouraged a\r\n      report, which increased at the same time the abhorrence and the\r\n      terror of the infidels. 79\r\n\r\n      73 (return) [ There is some diversity on the numbers of his army;\r\n      but no authority can be compared with that of Ptolemy, who states\r\n      it at five thousand horse and thirty thousand foot, (see Usher’s\r\n      Annales, p 152.)]\r\n\r\n      74 (return) [ Fulcher.

From their first station in the neighborhood of\r\n      Nicomedia, they advanced in successive divisions; passed the\r\n      contracted limit of the Greek empire; opened a road through the\r\n      hills, and commenced, by the siege of his capital, their pious\r\n      warfare against the Turkish sultan. His kingdom of Roum extended\r\n      from the Hellespont to the confines of Syria, and barred the\r\n      pilgrimage of Jerusalem, his name was Kilidge-Arslan, or Soliman,\r\n      80 of the race of Seljuk, and son of the first conqueror; and in\r\n      the defence of a land which the Turks considered as their own, he\r\n      deserved the praise of his enemies, by whom alone he is known to\r\n      posterity. Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent, he\r\n      deposited his family and treasure in Nice; retired to the\r\n      mountains with fifty thousand horse; and twice descended to\r\n      assault the camps or quarters of the Christian besiegers, which\r\n      formed an imperfect circle of above six miles. The lofty and\r\n      solid walls of Nice were covered by a deep ditch, and flanked by\r\n      three hundred and seventy towers; and on the verge of\r\n      Christendom, the Moslems were trained in arms, and inflamed by\r\n      religion. Before this city, the French princes occupied their\r\n      stations, and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or\r\n      subordination: emulation prompted their valor; but their valor\r\n      was sullied by cruelty, and their emulation degenerated into envy\r\n      and civil discord. In the siege of Nice, the arts and engines of\r\n      antiquity were employed by the Latins; the mine and the\r\n      battering-ram, the tortoise, and the belfrey or movable turret,\r\n      artificial fire, and the catapult and balist, the sling, and the\r\n      crossbow for the casting of stones and darts. 81 In the space of\r\n      seven weeks much labor and blood were expended, and some\r\n      progress, especially by Count Raymond, was made on the side of\r\n      the besiegers. But the Turks could protract their resistance and\r\n      secure their escape, as long as they were masters of the Lake 82\r\n      Ascanius, which stretches several miles to the westward of the\r\n      city. The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and\r\n      industry of Alexius; a great number of boats was transported on\r\n      sledges from the sea to the lake; they were filled with the most\r\n      dexterous of his archers; the flight of the sultana was\r\n      intercepted; Nice was invested by land and water; and a Greek\r\n      emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master’s\r\n      protection, and to save themselves, by a timely surrender, from\r\n      the rage of the savages of Europe. In the moment of victory, or\r\n      at least of hope, the crusaders, thirsting for blood and plunder,\r\n      were awed by the Imperial banner that streamed from the citadel;\r\n      821 and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this important\r\n      conquest. The murmurs of the chiefs were stifled by honor or\r\n      interest; and after a halt of nine days, they directed their\r\n      march towards Phrygia under the guidance of a Greek general, whom\r\n      they suspected of a secret connivance with the sultan. The\r\n      consort and the principal servants of Soliman had been honorably\r\n      restored without ransom; and the emperor’s generosity to the\r\n      miscreants 83 was interpreted as treason to the Christian cause.\r\n\r\n      80 (return) [ His Mussulman appellation of Soliman is used by the\r\n      Latins, and his character is highly embellished by Tasso.

A similar prejudice still\r\n      lurks in the minds of many who think themselves Christians.]\r\n\r\n      Soliman was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his\r\n      capital: he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange\r\n      invasion of the Western Barbarians; the Turkish emirs obeyed the\r\n      call of loyalty or religion; the Turkman hordes encamped round\r\n      his standard; and his whole force is loosely stated by the\r\n      Christians at two hundred, or even three hundred and sixty\r\n      thousand horse. Yet he patiently waited till they had left behind\r\n      them the sea and the Greek frontier; and hovering on the flanks,\r\n      observed their careless and confident progress in two columns\r\n      beyond the view of each other. Some miles before they could reach\r\n      Dorylaeum in Phrygia, the left, and least numerous, division was\r\n      surprised, and attacked, and almost oppressed, by the Turkish\r\n      cavalry. 84 The heat of the weather, the clouds of arrows, and\r\n      the barbarous onset, overwhelmed the crusaders; they lost their\r\n      order and confidence, and the fainting fight was sustained by the\r\n      personal valor, rather than by the military conduct, of Bohemond,\r\n      Tancred, and Robert of Normandy. They were revived by the welcome\r\n      banners of Duke Godfrey, who flew to their succor, with the count\r\n      of Vermandois, and sixty thousand horse; and was followed by\r\n      Raymond of Tholouse, the bishop of Puy, and the remainder of the\r\n      sacred army. Without a moment’s pause, they formed in new order,\r\n      and advanced to a second battle. They were received with equal\r\n      resolution; and, in their common disdain for the unwarlike people\r\n      of Greece and Asia, it was confessed on both sides, that the\r\n      Turks and the Franks were the only nations entitled to the\r\n      appellation of soldiers. 85 Their encounter was varied, and\r\n      balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline; of the direct\r\n      charge, and wheeling evolutions; of the couched lance, and the\r\n      brandished javelin; of a weighty broadsword, and a crooked sabre;\r\n      of cumbrous armor, and thin flowing robes; and of the long Tartar\r\n      bow, and the arbalist or crossbow, a deadly weapon, yet unknown\r\n      to the Orientals. 86 As long as the horses were fresh, and the\r\n      quivers full, Soliman maintained the advantage of the day; and\r\n      four thousand Christians were pierced by the Turkish arrows. In\r\n      the evening, swiftness yielded to strength: on either side, the\r\n      numbers were equal or at least as great as any ground could hold,\r\n      or any generals could manage; but in turning the hills, the last\r\n      division of Raymond and his provincials was led, perhaps without\r\n      design on the rear of an exhausted enemy; and the long contest\r\n      was determined. Besides a nameless and unaccounted multitude,\r\n      three thousand Pagan knights were slain in the battle and\r\n      pursuit; the camp of Soliman was pillaged; and in the variety of\r\n      precious spoil, the curiosity of the Latins was amused with\r\n      foreign arms and apparel, and the new aspect of dromedaries and\r\n      camels. The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty\r\n      retreat of the sultan: reserving ten thousand guards of the\r\n      relics of his army, Soliman evacuated the kingdom of Roum, and\r\n      hastened to implore the aid, and kindle the resentment, of his\r\n      Eastern brethren. In a march of five hundred miles, the crusaders\r\n      traversed the Lesser Asia, through a wasted land and deserted\r\n      towns, without finding either a friend or an enemy. The\r\n      geographer 87 may trace the position of Dorylaeum, Antioch of\r\n      Pisidia, Iconium, Archelais, and Germanicia, and may compare\r\n      those classic appellations with the modern names of Eskishehr the\r\n      old city, Akshehr the white city, Cogni, Erekli, and Marash. As\r\n      the pilgrims passed over a desert, where a draught of water is\r\n      exchanged for silver, they were tormented by intolerable thirst;\r\n      and on the banks of the first rivulet, their haste and\r\n      intemperance were still more pernicious to the disorderly throng.\r\n      They climbed with toil and danger the steep and slippery sides of\r\n      Mount Taurus; many of the soldiers cast away their arms to secure\r\n      their footsteps; and had not terror preceded their van, the long\r\n      and trembling file might have been driven down the precipice by a\r\n      handful of resolute enemies. Two of their most respectable\r\n      chiefs, the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, were\r\n      carried in litters: Raymond was raised, as it is said by miracle,\r\n      from a hopeless malady; and Godfrey had been torn by a bear, as\r\n      he pursued that rough and perilous chase in the mountains of\r\n      Pisidia.\r\n\r\n      84 (return) [ Baronius has produced a very doubtful letter to his\r\n      brother Roger, (A.D. 1098, No. 15.)

They overran in a rapid career the hills and sea-coast\r\n      of Cilicia, from Cogni to the Syrian gates: the Norman standard\r\n      was first planted on the walls of Tarsus and Malmistra; but the\r\n      proud injustice of Baldwin at length provoked the patient and\r\n      generous Italian; and they turned their consecrated swords\r\n      against each other in a private and profane quarrel. Honor was\r\n      the motive, and fame the reward, of Tancred; but fortune smiled\r\n      on the more selfish enterprise of his rival. 88 He was called to\r\n      the assistance of a Greek or Armenian tyrant, who had been\r\n      suffered under the Turkish yoke to reign over the Christians of\r\n      Edessa. Baldwin accepted the character of his son and champion:\r\n      but no sooner was he introduced into the city, than he inflamed\r\n      the people to the massacre of his father, occupied the throne and\r\n      treasure, extended his conquests over the hills of Armenia and\r\n      the plain of Mesopotamia, and founded the first principality of\r\n      the Franks or Latins, which subsisted fifty-four years beyond the\r\n      Euphrates. 89\r\n\r\n      88 (return) [ This detached conquest of Edessa is best\r\n      represented by Fulcherius Carnotensis, or of Chartres, (in the\r\n      collections of Bongarsius Duchesne, and Martenne,) the valiant\r\n      chaplain of Count Baldwin (Esprit des Croisades, tom. i. p. 13,\r\n      14.)

The capital of Syria was protected by the River Orontes; and\r\n      the iron bridge, 891 of nine arches, derives its name from the\r\n      massy gates of the two towers which are constructed at either\r\n      end. They were opened by the sword of the duke of Normandy: his\r\n      victory gave entrance to three hundred thousand crusaders, an\r\n      account which may allow some scope for losses and desertion, but\r\n      which clearly detects much exaggeration in the review of Nice. In\r\n      the description of Antioch, 90 it is not easy to define a middle\r\n      term between her ancient magnificence, under the successors of\r\n      Alexander and Augustus, and the modern aspect of Turkish\r\n      desolation. The Tetrapolis, or four cities, if they retained\r\n      their name and position, must have left a large vacuity in a\r\n      circumference of twelve miles; and that measure, as well as the\r\n      number of four hundred towers, are not perfectly consistent with\r\n      the five gates, so often mentioned in the history of the siege.\r\n      Yet Antioch must have still flourished as a great and populous\r\n      capital. At the head of the Turkish emirs, Baghisian, a veteran\r\n      chief, commanded in the place: his garrison was composed of six\r\n      or seven thousand horse, and fifteen or twenty thousand foot: one\r\n      hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen by the sword;\r\n      and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks,\r\n      Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than fourteen years\r\n      the slaves of the house of Seljuk. From the remains of a solid\r\n      and stately wall, it appears to have arisen to the height of\r\n      threescore feet in the valleys; and wherever less art and labor\r\n      had been applied, the ground was supposed to be defended by the\r\n      river, the morass, and the mountains. Notwithstanding these\r\n      fortifications, the city had been repeatedly taken by the\r\n      Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the Turks; so large a\r\n      circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack; and in\r\n      a siege that was formed about the middle of October, the vigor of\r\n      the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt.\r\n      Whatever strength and valor could perform in the field was\r\n      abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross: in the\r\n      frequent occasions of sallies, of forage, of the attack and\r\n      defence of convoys, they were often victorious; and we can only\r\n      complain, that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the\r\n      scale of probability and truth. The sword of Godfrey 91 divided a\r\n      Turk from the shoulder to the haunch; and one half of the infidel\r\n      fell to the ground, while the other was transported by his horse\r\n      to the city gate. As Robert of Normandy rode against his\r\n      antagonist, “I devote thy head,” he piously exclaimed, “to the\r\n      daemons of hell;” and that head was instantly cloven to the\r\n      breast by the resistless stroke of his descending falchion. But\r\n      the reality or the report of such gigantic prowess 92 must have\r\n      taught the Moslems to keep within their walls: and against those\r\n      walls of earth or stone, the sword and the lance were unavailing\r\n      weapons. In the slow and successive labors of a siege, the\r\n      crusaders were supine and ignorant, without skill to contrive, or\r\n      money to purchase, or industry to use, the artificial engines and\r\n      implements of assault. In the conquest of Nice, they had been\r\n      powerfully assisted by the wealth and knowledge of the Greek\r\n      emperor: his absence was poorly supplied by some Genoese and\r\n      Pisan vessels, that were attracted by religion or trade to the\r\n      coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the return precarious,\r\n      and the communication difficult and dangerous. Indolence or\r\n      weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the entire\r\n      circuit; and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the\r\n      wants and recruited the garrison of the city. At the end of seven\r\n      months, after the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by\r\n      famine, desertion and fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was\r\n      imperceptible, and their success remote, if the Latin Ulysses,\r\n      the artful and ambitious Bohemond, had not employed the arms of\r\n      cunning and deceit. The Christians of Antioch were numerous and\r\n      discontented: Phirouz, a Syrian renegado, had acquired the favor\r\n      of the emir and the command of three towers; and the merit of his\r\n      repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself, the\r\n      foul design of perfidy and treason. A secret correspondence, for\r\n      their mutual interest, was soon established between Phirouz and\r\n      the prince of Tarento; and Bohemond declared in the council of\r\n      the chiefs, that he could deliver the city into their hands. 921\r\n      But he claimed the sovereignty of Antioch as the reward of his\r\n      service; and the proposal which had been rejected by the envy,\r\n      was at length extorted from the distress, of his equals. The\r\n      nocturnal surprise was executed by the French and Norman princes,\r\n      who ascended in person the scaling-ladders that were thrown from\r\n      the walls: their new proselyte, after the murder of his too\r\n      scrupulous brother, embraced and introduced the servants of\r\n      Christ; the army rushed through the gates; and the Moslems soon\r\n      found, that although mercy was hopeless, resistance was impotent.\r\n\r\n      But the citadel still refused to surrender; and the victims\r\n      themselves were speedily encompassed and besieged by the\r\n      innumerable forces of Kerboga, prince of Mosul, who, with\r\n      twenty-eight Turkish emirs, advanced to the deliverance of\r\n      Antioch. Five-and-twenty days the Christians spent on the verge\r\n      of destruction; and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and the\r\n      sultan left them only the choice of servitude or death. 93 In\r\n      this extremity they collected the relics of their strength,\r\n      sallied from the town, and in a single memorable day, annihilated\r\n      or dispersed the host of Turks and Arabians, which they might\r\n      safely report to have consisted of six hundred thousand men. 94\r\n      Their supernatural allies I shall proceed to consider: the human\r\n      causes of the victory of Antioch were the fearless despair of the\r\n      Franks; and the surprise, the discord, perhaps the errors, of\r\n      their unskilful and presumptuous adversaries. The battle is\r\n      described with as much disorder as it was fought; but we may\r\n      observe the tent of Kerboga, a movable and spacious palace,\r\n      enriched with the luxury of Asia, and capable of holding above\r\n      two thousand persons; we may distinguish his three thousand\r\n      guards, who were cased, the horse as well as the men, in complete\r\n      steel.\r\n\r\n      891 (return) [ This bridge was over the Ifrin, not the Orontes,\r\n      at a distance of three leagues from Antioch.

A\r\n      speculative reasoner might suppose, that their faith had a strong\r\n      and serious influence on their practice; and that the soldiers of\r\n      the cross, the deliverers of the holy sepulchre, prepared\r\n      themselves by a sober and virtuous life for the daily\r\n      contemplation of martyrdom. Experience blows away this charitable\r\n      illusion; and seldom does the history of profane war display such\r\n      scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under\r\n      the walls of Antioch. The grove of Daphne no longer flourished;\r\n      but the Syrian air was still impregnated with the same vices; the\r\n      Christians were seduced by every temptation 95 that nature either\r\n      prompts or reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised;\r\n      and sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those\r\n      scandalous disorders, not less pernicious to military discipline,\r\n      than repugnant to evangelic purity. In the first days of the\r\n      siege and the possession of Antioch, the Franks consumed with\r\n      wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence of\r\n      weeks and months: the desolate country no longer yielded a\r\n      supply; and from that country they were at length excluded by the\r\n      arms of the besieging Turks. Disease, the faithful companion of\r\n      want, was envenomed by the rains of the winter, the summer heats,\r\n      unwholesome food, and the close imprisonment of multitudes. The\r\n      pictures of famine and pestilence are always the same, and always\r\n      disgustful; and our imagination may suggest the nature of their\r\n      sufferings and their resources. The remains of treasure or spoil\r\n      were eagerly lavished in the purchase of the vilest nourishment;\r\n      and dreadful must have been the calamities of the poor, since,\r\n      after paying three marks of silver for a goat and fifteen for a\r\n      lean camel, 96 the count of Flanders was reduced to beg a dinner,\r\n      and Duke Godfrey to borrow a horse. Sixty thousand horse had been\r\n      reviewed in the camp: before the end of the siege they were\r\n      diminished to two thousand, and scarcely two hundred fit for\r\n      service could be mustered on the day of battle. Weakness of body\r\n      and terror of mind extinguished the ardent enthusiasm of the\r\n      pilgrims; and every motive of honor and religion was subdued by\r\n      the desire of life. 97 Among the chiefs, three heroes may be\r\n      found without fear or reproach: Godfrey of Bouillon was supported\r\n      by his magnanimous piety; Bohemond by ambition and interest; and\r\n      Tancred declared, in the true spirit of chivalry, that as long as\r\n      he was at the head of forty knights, he would never relinquish\r\n      the enterprise of Palestine. But the count of Tholouse and\r\n      Provence was suspected of a voluntary indisposition; the duke of\r\n      Normandy was recalled from the sea-shore by the censures of the\r\n      church: Hugh the Great, though he led the vanguard of the battle,\r\n      embraced an ambiguous opportunity of returning to France and\r\n      Stephen, count of Chartres, basely deserted the standard which he\r\n      bore, and the council in which he presided. The soldiers were\r\n      discouraged by the flight of William, viscount of Melun, surnamed\r\n      the Carpenter, from the weighty strokes of his axe; and the\r\n      saints were scandalized by the fall 971 of Peter the Hermit, who,\r\n      after arming Europe against Asia, attempted to escape from the\r\n      penance of a necessary fast. Of the multitude of recreant\r\n      warriors, the names (says an historian) are blotted from the book\r\n      of life; and the opprobrious epithet of the rope-dancers was\r\n      applied to the deserters who dropped in the night from the walls\r\n      of Antioch. The emperor Alexius, 98 who seemed to advance to the\r\n      succor of the Latins, was dismayed by the assurance of their\r\n      hopeless condition. They expected their fate in silent despair;\r\n      oaths and punishments were tried without effect; and to rouse the\r\n      soldiers to the defence of the walls, it was found necessary to\r\n      set fire to their quarters.\r\n\r\n      95 (return) [ See the tragic and scandalous fate of an archdeacon\r\n      of royal birth, who was slain by the Turks as he reposed in an\r\n      orchard, playing at dice with a Syrian concubine.]\r\n\r\n      96 (return) [ The value of an ox rose from five solidi, (fifteen\r\n      shillings,) at Christmas to two marks, (four pounds,) and\r\n      afterwards much higher; a kid or lamb, from one shilling to\r\n      eighteen of our present money: in the second famine, a loaf of\r\n      bread, or the head of an animal, sold for a piece of gold.

In such a\r\n      cause, and in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles,\r\n      were frequent and familiar. In the distress of Antioch, they were\r\n      repeated with unusual energy and success: St. Ambrose had assured\r\n      a pious ecclesiastic, that two years of trial must precede the\r\n      season of deliverance and grace; the deserters were stopped by\r\n      the presence and reproaches of Christ himself; the dead had\r\n      promised to arise and combat with their brethren; the Virgin had\r\n      obtained the pardon of their sins; and their confidence was\r\n      revived by a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid discovery\r\n      of the Holy Lance. The policy of their chiefs has on this\r\n      occasion been admired, and might surely be excused; but a pious\r\n      fraud is seldom produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons;\r\n      and a voluntary impostor might depend on the support of the wise\r\n      and the credulity of the people. Of the diocese of Marseilles,\r\n      there was a priest of low cunning and loose manners, and his name\r\n      was Peter Bartholemy. He presented himself at the door of the\r\n      council-chamber, to disclose an apparition of St. Andrew, which\r\n      had been thrice reiterated in his sleep with a dreadful menace,\r\n      if he presumed to suppress the commands of Heaven. “At Antioch,”\r\n      said the apostle, “in the church of my brother St. Peter, near\r\n      the high altar, is concealed the steel head of the lance that\r\n      pierced the side of our Redeemer. In three days that instrument\r\n      of eternal, and now of temporal, salvation, will be manifested to\r\n      his disciples. Search, and ye shall find: bear it aloft in\r\n      battle; and that mystic weapon shall penetrate the souls of the\r\n      miscreants.” The pope’s legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to\r\n      listen with coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly\r\n      accepted by Count Raymond, whom his faithful subject, in the name\r\n      of the apostle, had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance.\r\n      The experiment was resolved; and on the third day after a due\r\n      preparation of prayer and fasting, the priest of Marseilles\r\n      introduced twelve trusty spectators, among whom were the count\r\n      and his chaplain; and the church doors were barred against the\r\n      impetuous multitude. The ground was opened in the appointed\r\n      place; but the workmen, who relieved each other, dug to the depth\r\n      of twelve feet without discovering the object of their search. In\r\n      the evening, when Count Raymond had withdrawn to his post, and\r\n      the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy, in his shirt,\r\n      and without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the\r\n      darkness of the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and\r\n      deposit the head of a Saracen lance; and the first sound, the\r\n      first gleam, of the steel was saluted with a devout rapture. The\r\n      holy lance was drawn from its recess, wrapped in a veil of silk\r\n      and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders; their\r\n      anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope,\r\n      and the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm\r\n      of valor. Whatever had been the arts, and whatever might be the\r\n      sentiments of the chiefs, they skilfully improved this fortunate\r\n      revolution by every aid that discipline and devotion could\r\n      afford. The soldiers were dismissed to their quarters with an\r\n      injunction to fortify their minds and bodies for the approaching\r\n      conflict, freely to bestow their last pittance on themselves and\r\n      their horses, and to expect with the dawn of day the signal of\r\n      victory. On the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul, the gates of\r\n      Antioch were thrown open: a martial psalm, “Let the Lord arise,\r\n      and let his enemies be scattered!” was chanted by a procession of\r\n      priests and monks; the battle array was marshalled in twelve\r\n      divisions, in honor of the twelve apostles; and the holy lance,\r\n      in the absence of Raymond, was intrusted to the hands of his\r\n      chaplain. The influence of his relic or trophy, was felt by the\r\n      servants, and perhaps by the enemies, of Christ; 99 and its\r\n      potent energy was heightened by an accident, a stratagem, or a\r\n      rumor, of a miraculous complexion. Three knights, in white\r\n      garments and resplendent arms, either issued, or seemed to issue,\r\n      from the hills: the voice of Adhemar, the pope’s legate,\r\n      proclaimed them as the martyrs St. George, St. Theodore, and St.\r\n      Maurice: the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or\r\n      scrutiny; and the welcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the\r\n      imagination of a fanatic army. 991 In the season of danger and\r\n      triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy of Marseilles was\r\n      unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary service was\r\n      accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal arms which the\r\n      count of Tholouse derived from the custody of the holy lance,\r\n      provoked the envy, and awakened the reason, of his rivals. A\r\n      Norman clerk presumed to sift, with a philosophic spirit, the\r\n      truth of the legend, the circumstances of the discovery, and the\r\n      character of the prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed their\r\n      deliverance to the merits and intercession of Christ alone. For a\r\n      while, the Provincials defended their national palladium with\r\n      clamors and arms and new visions condemned to death and hell the\r\n      profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the truth and merit\r\n      of the discovery. The prevalence of incredulity compelled the\r\n      author to submit his life and veracity to the judgment of God. A\r\n      pile of dry fagots, four feet high and fourteen long, was erected\r\n      in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt fiercely to the\r\n      elevation of thirty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve inches\r\n      was left for the perilous trial. The unfortunate priest of\r\n      Marseilles traversed the fire with dexterity and speed; but the\r\n      thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat; he expired\r\n      the next day; 992 and the logic of believing minds will pay some\r\n      regard to his dying protestations of innocence and truth. Some\r\n      efforts were made by the Provincials to substitute a cross, a\r\n      ring, or a tabernacle, in the place of the holy lance, which soon\r\n      vanished in contempt and oblivion. 100 Yet the revelation of\r\n      Antioch is gravely asserted by succeeding historians: and such is\r\n      the progress of credulity, that miracles most doubtful on the\r\n      spot, and at the moment, will be received with implicit faith at\r\n      a convenient distance of time and space.\r\n\r\n      99 (return) [ The Mahometan Aboulmahasen (apud De Guignes, tom.\r\n      ii. p. ii. p. 95) is more correct in his account of the holy\r\n      lance than the Christians, Anna Comnena and Abulpharagius: the\r\n      Greek princess confounds it with the nail of the cross, (l. xi.\r\n      p. 326;) the Jacobite primate, with St. Peter’s staff, (p. 242.)]\r\n\r\n      991 (return) [ The real cause of this victory appears to have\r\n      been the feud in Kerboga’s army Wilken, vol. ii. p. 40.—M.]\r\n\r\n      992 (return) [ The twelfth day after.

The rest of the herd are loud and\r\n      strenuous.]\r\n\r\n      The prudence or fortune of the Franks had delayed their invasion\r\n      till the decline of the Turkish empire. 101 Under the manly\r\n      government of the three first sultans, the kingdoms of Asia were\r\n      united in peace and justice; and the innumerable armies which\r\n      they led in person were equal in courage, and superior in\r\n      discipline, to the Barbarians of the West. But at the time of the\r\n      crusade, the inheritance of Malek Shaw was disputed by his four\r\n      sons; their private ambition was insensible of the public danger;\r\n      and, in the vicissitudes of their fortune, the royal vassals were\r\n      ignorant, or regardless, of the true object of their allegiance.\r\n      The twenty-eight emirs who marched with the standard or Kerboga\r\n      were his rivals or enemies: their hasty levies were drawn from\r\n      the towns and tents of Mesopotamia and Syria; and the Turkish\r\n      veterans were employed or consumed in the civil wars beyond the\r\n      Tigris. The caliph of Egypt embraced this opportunity of weakness\r\n      and discord to recover his ancient possessions; and his sultan\r\n      Aphdal besieged Jerusalem and Tyre, expelled the children of\r\n      Ortok, and restored in Palestine the civil and ecclesiastical\r\n      authority of the Fatimites. 102 They heard with astonishment of\r\n      the vast armies of Christians that had passed from Europe to\r\n      Asia, and rejoiced in the sieges and battles which broke the\r\n      power of the Turks, the adversaries of their sect and monarchy.\r\n      But the same Christians were the enemies of the prophet; and from\r\n      the overthrow of Nice and Antioch, the motive of their\r\n      enterprise, which was gradually understood, would urge them\r\n      forwards to the banks of the Jordan, or perhaps of the Nile.\r\n\r\n      An intercourse of epistles and embassies, which rose and fell\r\n      with the events of war, was maintained between the throne of\r\n      Cairo and the camp of the Latins; and their adverse pride was the\r\n      result of ignorance and enthusiasm. The ministers of Egypt\r\n      declared in a haughty, or insinuated in a milder, tone, that\r\n      their sovereign, the true and lawful commander of the faithful,\r\n      had rescued Jerusalem from the Turkish yoke; and that the\r\n      pilgrims, if they would divide their numbers, and lay aside their\r\n      arms, should find a safe and hospitable reception at the\r\n      sepulchre of Jesus. In the belief of their lost condition, the\r\n      caliph Mostali despised their arms and imprisoned their deputies:\r\n      the conquest and victory of Antioch prompted him to solicit those\r\n      formidable champions with gifts of horses and silk robes, of\r\n      vases, and purses of gold and silver; and in his estimate of\r\n      their merit or power, the first place was assigned to Bohemond,\r\n      and the second to Godfrey. In either fortune, the answer of the\r\n      crusaders was firm and uniform: they disdained to inquire into\r\n      the private claims or possessions of the followers of Mahomet;\r\n      whatsoever was his name or nation, the usurper of Jerusalem was\r\n      their enemy; and instead of prescribing the mode and terms of\r\n      their pilgrimage, it was only by a timely surrender of the city\r\n      and province, their sacred right, that he could deserve their\r\n      alliance, or deprecate their impending and irresistible attack.\r\n      103\r\n\r\n      101 (return) [ See M.

The zeal and courage of the crusaders were\r\n      chilled in the moment of victory; and instead of marching to\r\n      improve the consternation, they hastily dispersed to enjoy the\r\n      luxury, of Syria. The causes of this strange delay may be found\r\n      in the want of strength and subordination. In the painful and\r\n      various service of Antioch, the cavalry was annihilated; many\r\n      thousands of every rank had been lost by famine, sickness, and\r\n      desertion: the same abuse of plenty had been productive of a\r\n      third famine; and the alternative of intemperance and distress\r\n      had generated a pestilence, which swept away above fifty thousand\r\n      of the pilgrims. Few were able to command, and none were willing\r\n      to obey; the domestic feuds, which had been stifled by common\r\n      fear, were again renewed in acts, or at least in sentiments, of\r\n      hostility; the fortune of Baldwin and Bohemond excited the envy\r\n      of their companions; the bravest knights were enlisted for the\r\n      defence of their new principalities; and Count Raymond exhausted\r\n      his troops and treasures in an idle expedition into the heart of\r\n      Syria. 1031 The winter was consumed in discord and disorder; a\r\n      sense of honor and religion was rekindled in the spring; and the\r\n      private soldiers, less susceptible of ambition and jealousy,\r\n      awakened with angry clamors the indolence of their chiefs. In the\r\n      month of May, the relics of this mighty host proceeded from\r\n      Antioch to Laodicea: about forty thousand Latins, of whom no more\r\n      than fifteen hundred horse, and twenty thousand foot, were\r\n      capable of immediate service. Their easy march was continued\r\n      between Mount Libanus and the sea-shore: their wants were\r\n      liberally supplied by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa; and\r\n      they drew large contributions from the emirs of Tripoli, Tyre,\r\n      Sidon, Acre, and Caesarea, who granted a free passage, and\r\n      promised to follow the example of Jerusalem. From Caesarea they\r\n      advanced into the midland country; their clerks recognized the\r\n      sacred geography of Lydda, Ramla, Emmaus, and Bethlem, 1032 and\r\n      as soon as they descried the holy city, the crusaders forgot\r\n      their toils and claimed their reward. 104\r\n\r\n      1031 (return) [ This is not quite correct: he took Marra on his\r\n      road.

It was not till after a long\r\n      and obstinate contest that Babylon and Rome could prevail against\r\n      the obstinacy of the people, the craggy ground that might\r\n      supersede the necessity of fortifications, and the walls and\r\n      towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain. 105\r\n      These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades. The\r\n      bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored:\r\n      the Jews, their nation, and worship, were forever banished; but\r\n      nature is less changeable than man, and the site of Jerusalem,\r\n      though somewhat softened and somewhat removed, was still strong\r\n      against the assaults of an enemy. By the experience of a recent\r\n      siege, and a three years’ possession, the Saracens of Egypt had\r\n      been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy, the defects\r\n      of a place, which religion as well as honor forbade them to\r\n      resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph’s lieutenant, was\r\n      intrusted with the defence: his policy strove to restrain the\r\n      native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and that of the\r\n      holy sepulchre; to animate the Moslems by the assurance of\r\n      temporal and eternal rewards. His garrison is said to have\r\n      consisted of forty thousand Turks and Arabians; and if he could\r\n      muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed\r\n      that the besieged were more numerous than the besieging army. 106\r\n      Had the diminished strength and numbers of the Latins allowed\r\n      them to grasp the whole circumference of four thousand yards,\r\n      (about two English miles and a half, 107 to what useful purpose\r\n      should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom and\r\n      torrent of Cedron, 108 or approach the precipices of the south\r\n      and east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear?\r\n      Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and\r\n      western sides of the city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his\r\n      standard on the first swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far\r\n      as St. Stephen’s gate, the line of attack was continued by\r\n      Tancred and the two Roberts; and Count Raymond established his\r\n      quarters from the citadel to the foot of Mount Sion, which was no\r\n      longer included within the precincts of the city. On the fifth\r\n      day, the crusaders made a general assault, in the fanatic hope of\r\n      battering down the walls without engines, and of scaling them\r\n      without ladders. By the dint of brutal force, they burst the\r\n      first barrier; but they were driven back with shame and slaughter\r\n      to the camp: the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by\r\n      the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and\r\n      labor were found to be the only means of victory. The time of the\r\n      siege was indeed fulfilled in forty days, but they were forty\r\n      days of calamity and anguish. A repetition of the old complaint\r\n      of famine may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or\r\n      disorderly appetite of the Franks; but the stony soil of\r\n      Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; the scanty springs and\r\n      hasty torrents were dry in the summer season; nor was the thirst\r\n      of the besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the artificial\r\n      supply of cisterns and aqueducts. The circumjacent country is\r\n      equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building, but\r\n      some large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders: a\r\n      wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove of Tasso, 109 was cut down:\r\n      the necessary timber was transported to the camp by the vigor and\r\n      dexterity of Tancred; and the engines were framed by some Genoese\r\n      artists, who had fortunately landed in the harbor of Jaffa. Two\r\n      movable turrets were constructed at the expense, and in the\r\n      stations, of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, and\r\n      rolled forwards with devout labor, not to the most accessible,\r\n      but to the most neglected, parts of the fortification. Raymond’s\r\n      Tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged, but his\r\n      colleague was more vigilant and successful; 1091 the enemies were\r\n      driven by his archers from the rampart; the draw-bridge was let\r\n      down; and on a Friday, at three in the afternoon, the day and\r\n      hour of the passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the\r\n      walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every side by the\r\n      emulation of valor; and about four hundred and sixty years after\r\n      the conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the\r\n      Mahometan yoke. In the pillage of public and private wealth, the\r\n      adventurers had agreed to respect the exclusive property of the\r\n      first occupant; and the spoils of the great mosque, seventy lamps\r\n      and massy vases of gold and silver, rewarded the diligence, and\r\n      displayed the generosity, of Tancred. A bloody sacrifice was\r\n      offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians:\r\n      resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could mollify,\r\n      their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three days in a\r\n      promiscuous massacre; 110 and the infection of the dead bodies\r\n      produced an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems\r\n      had been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt\r\n      in their synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of\r\n      captives, whom interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare. Of\r\n      these savage heroes of the cross, Tancred alone betrayed some\r\n      sentiments of compassion; yet we may praise the more selfish\r\n      lenity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe-conduct to\r\n      the garrison of the citadel. 111 The holy sepulchre was now free;\r\n      and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow.\r\n      Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and in an humble\r\n      posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud\r\n      anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the\r\n      Savior of the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence\r\n      the monument of their redemption. This union of the fiercest and\r\n      most tender passions has been variously considered by two\r\n      philosophers; by the one, 112 as easy and natural; by the other,\r\n      113 as absurd and incredible. Perhaps it is too rigorously\r\n      applied to the same persons and the same hour; the example of the\r\n      virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety of his companions; while they\r\n      cleansed their bodies, they purified their minds; nor shall I\r\n      believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the\r\n      foremost in the procession to the holy sepulchre.\r\n\r\n      105 (return) [ See the masterly description of Tacitus, (Hist. v.\r\n      11, 12, 13,) who supposes that the Jewish lawgivers had provided\r\n      for a perpetual state of hostility against the rest of mankind. *\r\n      Note: This is an exaggerated inference from the words of Tacitus,\r\n      who speaks of the founders of the city, not the lawgivers.\r\n      Praeviderant conditores, ex diversitate morum, crebra bella; inde\r\n      cuncta quamvis adversus loagum obsidium.—M.]\r\n\r\n      106 (return) [ The lively scepticism of Voltaire is balanced with\r\n      sense and erudition by the French author of the Esprit des\r\n      Croisades, (tom. iv. p. 386-388,) who observes, that, according\r\n      to the Arabians, the inhabitants of Jerusalem must have exceeded\r\n      200,000; that in the siege of Titus, Josephus collects 1,300,000\r\n      Jews; that they are stated by Tacitus himself at 600,000; and\r\n      that the largest defalcation, that his accepimus can justify,\r\n      will still leave them more numerous than the Roman army.]\r\n\r\n      107 (return) [ Maundrell, who diligently perambulated the walls,\r\n      found a circuit of 4630 paces, or 4167 English yards, (p. 109,\r\n      110: ) from an authentic plan, D’Anville concludes a measure\r\n      nearly similar, of 1960 French toises, (p. 23-29,) in his scarce\r\n      and valuable tract.

Hugh the\r\n      Great, and Stephen of Chartres, had retired with some loss of\r\n      reputation, which they strove to regain by a second crusade and\r\n      an honorable death. Baldwin was established at Edessa, and\r\n      Bohemond at Antioch; and two Roberts, the duke of Normandy 114\r\n      and the count of Flanders, preferred their fair inheritance in\r\n      the West to a doubtful competition or a barren sceptre. The\r\n      jealousy and ambition of Raymond were condemned by his own\r\n      followers, and the free, the just, the unanimous voice of the\r\n      army proclaimed Godfrey of Bouillon the first and most worthy of\r\n      the champions of Christendom. His magnanimity accepted a trust as\r\n      full of danger as of glory; but in a city where his Savior had\r\n      been crowned with thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name\r\n      and ensigns of royalty; and the founder of the kingdom of\r\n      Jerusalem contented himself with the modest title of Defender and\r\n      Baron of the Holy Sepulchre. His government of a single year, 115\r\n      too short for the public happiness, was interrupted in the first\r\n      fortnight by a summons to the field, by the approach of the\r\n      vizier or sultan of Egypt, who had been too slow to prevent, but\r\n      who was impatient to avenge, the loss of Jerusalem. His total\r\n      overthrow in the battle of Ascalon sealed the establishment of\r\n      the Latins in Syria, and signalized the valor of the French\r\n      princes who in this action bade a long farewell to the holy wars.\r\n\r\n      Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of\r\n      numbers, though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot\r\n      1151 on the side of the Fatimites; but, except three thousand\r\n      Ethiopians or Blacks, who were armed with flails or scourges of\r\n      iron, the Barbarians of the South fled on the first onset, and\r\n      afforded a pleasing comparison between the active valor of the\r\n      Turks and the sloth and effeminacy of the natives of Egypt. After\r\n      suspending before the holy sepulchre the sword and standard of\r\n      the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title) embraced his\r\n      departing companions, and could retain only with the gallant\r\n      Tancred three hundred knights, and two thousand foot-soldiers for\r\n      the defence of Palestine. His sovereignty was soon attacked by a\r\n      new enemy, the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward.\r\n      Adhemar, bishop of Puy, who excelled both in council and action,\r\n      had been swept away in the last plague at Antioch: the remaining\r\n      ecclesiastics preserved only the pride and avarice of their\r\n      character; and their seditious clamors had required that the\r\n      choice of a bishop should precede that of a king. The revenue and\r\n      jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the Latin\r\n      clergy: the exclusion of the Greeks and Syrians was justified by\r\n      the reproach of heresy or schism; 116 and, under the iron yoke of\r\n      their deliverers, the Oriental Christians regretted the\r\n      tolerating government of the Arabian caliphs. Daimbert,\r\n      archbishop of Pisa, had long been trained in the secret policy of\r\n      Rome: he brought a fleet at his countrymen to the succor of the\r\n      Holy Land, and was installed, without a competitor, the spiritual\r\n      and temporal head of the church. 1161 The new patriarch 117\r\n      immediately grasped the sceptre which had been acquired by the\r\n      toil and blood of the victorious pilgrims; and both Godfrey and\r\n      Bohemond submitted to receive at his hands the investiture of\r\n      their feudal possessions. Nor was this sufficient; Daimbert\r\n      claimed the immediate property of Jerusalem and Jaffa; instead of\r\n      a firm and generous refusal, the hero negotiated with the priest;\r\n      a quarter of either city was ceded to the church; and the modest\r\n      bishop was satisfied with an eventual reversion of the rest, on\r\n      the death of Godfrey without children, or on the future\r\n      acquisition of a new seat at Cairo or Damascus.\r\n\r\n      114 (return) [ The English ascribe to Robert of Normandy, and the\r\n      Provincials to Raymond of Tholouse, the glory of refusing the\r\n      crown; but the honest voice of tradition has preserved the memory\r\n      of the ambition and revenge (Villehardouin, No. 136) of the count\r\n      of St. Giles.

By the arms of Godfrey himself, and of the two\r\n      Baldwins, his brother and cousin, who succeeded to the throne,\r\n      the Latins breathed with more ease and safety; and at length they\r\n      equalled, in the extent of their dominions, though not in the\r\n      millions of their subjects, the ancient princes of Judah and\r\n      Israel. 119 After the reduction of the maritime cities of\r\n      Laodicea, Tripoli, Tyre, and Ascalon, 120 which were powerfully\r\n      assisted by the fleets of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and even of\r\n      Flanders and Norway, 121 the range of sea-coast from Scanderoon\r\n      to the borders of Egypt was possessed by the Christian pilgrims.\r\n      If the prince of Antioch disclaimed his supremacy, the counts of\r\n      Edessa and Tripoli owned themselves the vassals of the king of\r\n      Jerusalem: the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrates; and the four\r\n      cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo, were the only relics\r\n      of the Mahometan conquests in Syria. 122 The laws and language,\r\n      the manners and titles, of the French nation and Latin church,\r\n      were introduced into these transmarine colonies. According to the\r\n      feudal jurisprudence, the principal states and subordinate\r\n      baronies descended in the line of male and female succession: 123\r\n      but the children of the first conquerors, 124 a motley and\r\n      degenerate race, were dissolved by the luxury of the climate; the\r\n      arrival of new crusaders from Europe was a doubtful hope and a\r\n      casual event. The service of the feudal tenures 125 was performed\r\n      by six hundred and sixty-six knights, who might expect the aid of\r\n      two hundred more under the banner of the count of Tripoli; and\r\n      each knight was attended to the field by four squires or archers\r\n      on horseback. 126 Five thousand and seventy sergeants, most\r\n      probably foot-soldiers, were supplied by the churches and cities;\r\n      and the whole legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed\r\n      eleven thousand men, a slender defence against the surrounding\r\n      myriads of Saracens and Turks. 127 But the firmest bulwark of\r\n      Jerusalem was founded on the knights of the Hospital of St. John,\r\n      128 and of the temple of Solomon; 129 on the strange association\r\n      of a monastic and military life, which fanaticism might suggest,\r\n      but which policy must approve. The flower of the nobility of\r\n      Europe aspired to wear the cross, and to profess the vows, of\r\n      these respectable orders; their spirit and discipline were\r\n      immortal; and the speedy donation of twenty-eight thousand farms,\r\n      or manors, 130 enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry\r\n      and infantry for the defence of Palestine. The austerity of the\r\n      convent soon evaporated in the exercise of arms; the world was\r\n      scandalized by the pride, avarice, and corruption of these\r\n      Christian soldiers; their claims of immunity and jurisdiction\r\n      disturbed the harmony of the church and state; and the public\r\n      peace was endangered by their jealous emulation. But in their\r\n      most dissolute period, the knights of their hospital and temple\r\n      maintained their fearless and fanatic character: they neglected\r\n      to live, but they were prepared to die, in the service of Christ;\r\n      and the spirit of chivalry, the parent and offspring of the\r\n      crusades, has been transplanted by this institution from the holy\r\n      sepulchre to the Isle of Malta. 131\r\n\r\n      118 (return) [ Willerm.

They boldly affirmed his\r\n      innocence and his wrongs; demanded the restitution of his liberty\r\n      or his lands; suspended, after a fruitless demand, their own\r\n      service; rescued their brother from prison; and employed every\r\n      weapon in his defence, without offering direct violence to the\r\n      person of their lord, which was ever sacred in their eyes. 138 In\r\n      their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the advocates of the\r\n      court were subtle and copious; but the use of argument and\r\n      evidence was often superseded by judicial combat; and the Assise\r\n      of Jerusalem admits in many cases this barbarous institution,\r\n      which has been slowly abolished by the laws and manners of\r\n      Europe.\r\n\r\n      137 (return) [ The cautious John D’Ibelin argues, rather than\r\n      affirms, that Tripoli is the fourth barony, and expresses some\r\n      doubt concerning the right or pretension of the constable and\r\n      marshal, (c. 323.)]\r\n\r\n      138 (return) [ Entre seignor et homme ne n’a que la foi;.... mais\r\n      tant que l’homme doit a son seignor reverence en toutes choses,\r\n      (c. 206.) Tous les hommes dudit royaume sont par ladite Assise\r\n      tenus les uns as autres.... et en celle maniere que le seignor\r\n      mette main ou face mettre au cors ou au fie d’aucun d’yaus sans\r\n      esgard et sans connoissans de court, que tous les autres doivent\r\n      venir devant le seignor, &c., (212.) The form of their\r\n      remonstrances is conceived with the noble simplicity of freedom.]\r\n\r\n      The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which\r\n      affected the life, or limb, or honor, of any person; and in all\r\n      civil transactions, of or above the value of one mark of silver.\r\n      It appears that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of\r\n      the accuser, who, except in a charge of treason, avenged his\r\n      personal injury, or the death of those persons whom he had a\r\n      right to represent; but wherever, from the nature of the charge,\r\n      testimony could be obtained, it was necessary for him to produce\r\n      witnesses of the fact. In civil cases, the combat was not allowed\r\n      as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant; but he\r\n      was obliged to produce witnesses who had, or assumed to have,\r\n      knowledge of the fact. The combat was then the privilege of the\r\n      defendant; because he charged the witness with an attempt by\r\n      perjury to take away his right. He came therefore to be in the\r\n      same situation as the appellant in criminal cases. It was not\r\n      then as a mode of proof that the combat was received, nor as\r\n      making negative evidence, (according to the supposition of\r\n      Montesquieu; 139 but in every case the right to offer battle was\r\n      founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of an injury;\r\n      and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle, and\r\n      with the same spirit, as a private duel. Champions were only\r\n      allowed to women, and to men maimed or past the age of sixty. The\r\n      consequence of a defeat was death to the person accused, or to\r\n      the champion or witness, as well as to the accuser himself: but\r\n      in civil cases, the demandant was punished with infamy and the\r\n      loss of his suit, while his witness and champion suffered\r\n      ignominious death. In many cases it was in the option of the\r\n      judge to award or to refuse the combat: but two are specified, in\r\n      which it was the inevitable result of the challenge; if a\r\n      faithful vassal gave the lie to his compeer, who unjustly claimed\r\n      any portion of their lord’s demesnes; or if an unsuccessful\r\n      suitor presumed to impeach the judgment and veracity of the\r\n      court. He might impeach them, but the terms were severe and\r\n      perilous: in the same day he successively fought all the members\r\n      of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a single defeat\r\n      was followed by death and infamy; and where none could hope for\r\n      victory, it is highly probable that none would adventure the\r\n      trial. In the Assise of Jerusalem, the legal subtlety of the\r\n      count of Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude, than to\r\n      facilitate, the judicial combat, which he derives from a\r\n      principle of honor rather than of superstition. 140\r\n\r\n      139 (return) [ See l’Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. In the forty\r\n      years since its publication, no work has been more read and\r\n      criticized; and the spirit of inquiry which it has excited is not\r\n      the least of our obligations to the author.]\r\n\r\n      140 (return) [ For the intelligence of this obscure and obsolete\r\n      jurisprudence (c. 80-111) I am deeply indebted to the friendship\r\n      of a learned lord, who, with an accurate and discerning eye, has\r\n      surveyed the philosophic history of law. By his studies,\r\n      posterity might be enriched: the merit of the orator and the\r\n      judge can be felt only by his contemporaries.]\r\n\r\n      Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke\r\n      of feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is\r\n      one of the most powerful; and if those of Palestine are coeval\r\n      with the first crusade, they may be ranked with the most ancient\r\n      of the Latin world. Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their\r\n      lords under the banner of the cross; and it was the policy of the\r\n      French princes to tempt their stay by the assurance of the rights\r\n      and privileges of freemen. It is expressly declared in the Assise\r\n      of Jerusalem, that after instituting, for his knights and barons,\r\n      the court of peers, in which he presided himself, Godfrey of\r\n      Bouillon established a second tribunal, in which his person was\r\n      represented by his viscount. The jurisdiction of this inferior\r\n      court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom; and it was\r\n      composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy\r\n      citizens, who were sworn to judge, according to the laws of the\r\n      actions and fortunes of their equals. 141 In the conquest and\r\n      settlement of new cities, the example of Jerusalem was imitated\r\n      by the kings and their great vassals; and above thirty similar\r\n      corporations were founded before the loss of the Holy Land.\r\n      Another class of subjects, the Syrians, 142 or Oriental\r\n      Christians, were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and\r\n      protected by the toleration of the state. Godfrey listened to\r\n      their reasonable prayer, that they might be judged by their own\r\n      national laws. A third court was instituted for their use, of\r\n      limited and domestic jurisdiction: the sworn members were\r\n      Syrians, in blood, language, and religion; but the office of the\r\n      president (in Arabic, of the rais) was sometimes exercised by the\r\n      viscount of the city. At an immeasurable distance below the\r\n      nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers, the Assise of Jerusalem\r\n      condescends to mention the villains and slaves, the peasants of\r\n      the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally\r\n      considered as the objects of property. The relief or protection\r\n      of these unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the\r\n      legislator; but he diligently provides for the recovery, though\r\n      not indeed for the punishment, of the fugitives. Like hounds, or\r\n      hawks, who had strayed from the lawful owner, they might be lost\r\n      and claimed: the slave and falcon were of the same value; but\r\n      three slaves, or twelve oxen, were accumulated to equal the price\r\n      of the war-horse; and a sum of three hundred pieces of gold was\r\n      fixed, in the age of chivalry, as the equivalent of the more\r\n      noble animal. 143\r\n\r\n      141 (return) [ Louis le Gros, who is considered as the father of\r\n      this institution in France, did not begin his reign till nine\r\n      years (A.D. 1108) after Godfrey of Bouillon, (Assises, c. 2,\r\n      324.) For its origin and effects, see the judicious remarks of\r\n      Dr. Robertson, (History of Charles V. vol. i. p. 30-36, 251-265,\r\n      quarto edition.)]\r\n\r\n      142 (return) [ Every reader conversant with the historians of the\r\n      crusades will understand by the peuple des Suriens, the Oriental\r\n      Christians, Melchites, Jacobites, or Nestorians, who had all\r\n      adopted the use of the Arabic language, (vol. iv. p. 593.)]\r\n\r\n      143 (return) [ See the Assises de Jerusalem, (310, 311, 312.)\r\n      These laws were enacted as late as the year 1350, in the kingdom\r\n      of Cyprus.
