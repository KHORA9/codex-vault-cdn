He himself, however, remained behind, and\r\nhaving been initiated into the mysteries of Bardism, formed an intimate\r\nacquaintance with Owen, Cian, Llywarch Hen, and Taliesin, all likewise\r\ndisciples of the Awen.  By the rules of his order a Bard was not\r\npermitted ordinarily to bear arms, {0b} and though the exceptional case,\r\nin which he might act differently, may be said to have arisen from \"the\r\nlawlessness and depredation\" {0c} of the Saxons, Aneurin does not appear\r\nto have been present at Cattraeth in any other capacity than that of a\r\nherald Bard.  Besides the absence of any intimation to the contrary, we\r\nthink the passages where he compares Owen to himself, and where he makes\r\nproposals at the conference, and above all where he attributes his safety\r\nto his \"gwenwawd,\" conclusive on the subject.  His heraldic character\r\nwould be recognised by all nations, according to the universal law of\r\nwarfare, whereas it is very improbable that any poetic effusion which he\r\nmight have delivered, could have influence upon a people whose language\r\ndiffered so materially from his own.\r\n\r\nThe Gododin was evidently composed when the various occurrences that it\r\nrecords were as yet fresh in the author's mind and recollection.  It is\r\ndivided into stanzas, which, though they now amount to only ninety-seven,\r\nare supposed to have originally corresponded in point of number with the\r\nchieftains that went to Cattraeth.  This is strongly intimated in the\r\ndeclaration subjoined to Gorchan Cynvelyn, and cited in the notes at page\r\n86, and thence would we infer that the Gorchanau themselves are portions\r\nof the Gododin, having for their object the commemoration of the persons\r\nwhose names they bear.  Of course all of them, with the exception of the\r\nshort one of Adebon, contain passages that have been transposed from\r\nother stanzas, which may account for their disproportionate lengths.\r\nThis is especially the case with Gorchan Maelderw, the latter, and by far\r\nthe greater portion whereof, is in the Carnhuanawc MS. detached from the\r\nformer, and separately entitled \"Fragments of the Gododin and other\r\npieces of the sixth century.\"  That they were \"incantations,\" cannot be\r\nadmitted; and if the word \"gorchan,\" or \"gwarchan\" mean here anything\r\nexcept simply \"a canon, or fundamental part of song,\" we should be\r\ninclined to consider it as synonymous with \"gwarthan,\" and to suppose\r\nthat the poems in question referred to the camps of Adebon, Maelderw, and\r\nCynvelyn:--\r\n\r\n    \"Gwarchan Cynvelyn ar Ododin.\" {0d}\r\n\r\nAccording to the tenor of the Cynvelyn statement, every stanza would\r\nbring before us a fresh hero.  This principle we have not overlooked in\r\nthe discrimination and arrangements of proper names, though owing to\r\nevident omissions and interpolations, an irregularity in this respect\r\noccasionally and of necessity occurs.\r\n\r\nAneurin, like a true poet of nature, abstains from all artful\r\nintroduction or invocation, and launches at once into his subject.  His\r\neye follows the gorgeously and distinctively armed chiefs, as they move\r\nat the head of their respective companies, and perform deeds of valour on\r\nthe bloody field.  He delights to enhance by contrast their domestic and\r\nwarlike habits, and frequently recurs to the pang of sorrow, which the\r\nabsence of the warriors must have caused to their friends and relatives\r\nat home, and reflects with much genuine feeling upon the disastrous\r\nconsequences, that the loss of the battle would entail upon these and\r\ntheir dear native land.  And though he sets forth his subject in the\r\nornamental language of poetry, yet he is careful not to transgress the\r\nbounds of truth.  This is strikingly instanced in the manner in which he\r\nnames no less than four witnesses as vouchers for the correctness of his\r\ndescription of Caradawg.  Herein he produces one of the \"three agreements\r\nthat ought to be in a song,\" viz. an agreement \"between truth and the\r\nmarvellous.\" {0e}\r\n\r\nHe also gives \"relish to his song,\" {0f} by adopting \"a diversity of\r\nstructure in the metre;\" for the lyric comes in occasionally to relieve\r\nthe solemnity of the heroic, whilst at the same time the latter is\r\nfrequently capable of being divided into a shorter verse, a plan which\r\nhas been observed in one of the MSS. used on the present occasion; e. g.\r\nthe twelfth stanza is thus arranged,--\r\n\r\n    Gwyr a aeth Gattraeth gan ddydd\r\n          Neus goreu } gywilydd\r\n          O gadeu }\r\n          Wy gwnaethant } gelorwydd\r\n          Yn geugant }\r\n       A llafn aur llawn anawdd ym bedydd\r\n       Goreu yw hyn cyn cystlwn carennydd\r\n          Ennaint creu } oe henydd\r\n          Ac angeu }\r\n          Rhag byddin } pan fu ddydd\r\n          Wawdodyn }\r\n       Neus goreu dan bwylliad neirthiad gwychydd.\r\n\r\nBut though Aneurin survived the battle of Cattraeth to celebrate the\r\nmemory of his less fortunate countrymen in this noble composition, he\r\nalso ultimately met with a violent death.  The Triads relate that he was\r\nkilled by the blow of an axe, inflicted upon his head by Eiddin son of\r\nEinigan, which event was in consequence branded as one of \"the three\r\naccursed deeds of the Isle of Britain.\" {0g}\r\n\r\nHis memory, however, lived in the Gododin, and the estimation in which\r\nthe poem was held by his successors has earned for him the title of\r\n\"medeyrn beirdd,\" the king of Bards.  Davydd Benvras 1190-1240, prays for\r\nthat genius which would enable him\r\n\r\n    \"To sing praises as Aneurin of yore,\r\n    The day he sang the Gododin.\" {0h}\r\n\r\nRisserdyn 1290-1340 in an Ode to Hywel ab Gruffydd speaks of\r\n\r\n    \"A tongue with the eloquence of Aneurin of splendid song.\" {0i}\r\n\r\nAnd Sevnyn 1320-1378 asserts that\r\n\r\n    \"The praise of Aneurin is proclaimed by thousands.\" {0j}\r\n\r\nSuch is the language in which the mediaeval Bards were accustomed to talk\r\nof the author of the Gododin.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the present translation is a MS. on vellum apparently of\r\nabout the year 1200.  In that MS. the lines are all written out to the\r\nmargin, without any regard to the measure.  Capital letters are never\r\nintroduced but at the beginning of paragraphs, where they are ornamented\r\nand coloured alternately red and green.  At page 20 Gwilym Tew and Rhys\r\nNanmor {0k} are mentioned as the owners of the Book, but the names are\r\nwritten in a hand, and with letters more modern than the MS.  It at one\r\ntime belonged to Mr. Jones the Historian of Brecknockshire, and came\r\nlatterly into the possession of the late Rev. T. Price, with whose\r\nExecutrix, Mrs. E. Powell of Abergavenny, it now remains.  The author of\r\nthe Celtic Researches took a transcript of it, which he communicated to\r\nthe Rev. W. J. Rees, of Cascob, who had previously copied the said\r\ntranscript by the permission of the Rev. E. Davies.  Mr. Rees's copy was\r\nafterwards collated by Dr. Meyer with Mr. Davies's transcript, and the\r\nonly inaccuracy which had crept in was by him carefully corrected.  Dr.\r\nMeyer again transcribed Mr. Rees's copy for the use of the present work,\r\nand that version in its turn has been collated by Mr. Rees, during the\r\nprogress of the work through the press, with the transcript in his\r\npossession.  To these two gentlemen the translator is under deep\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nAlso to Mr. Owen Williams of Waunfawr, for the loan of three other\r\nmanuscript copies of the Gododin.  Two of them occur in the same book,\r\nwhich purports to have been a transcript made by the Rev. David Ellis,\r\nthe first part, A.D. 1775 of an old book, the second part, June 7, 1777,\r\nof a book supposed to have been written by Sion Brwynog about the year\r\n1550.  In these versions the stanzas are not divided.  The third version\r\nappears in a book containing a variety of poems and articles in prose, of\r\nwhich, however, the writer or copyist is not known, though one \"Davydd\r\nThomas\" is mentioned in a poor modern hand as being the owner.  Our poem\r\nis therein headed \"Y Gododin.  Aneurin ae cant.  Gyda nodau y Parchedig\r\nEvan Evans.\"  These \"nodau\" are marginal notes, and evidently the\r\ndifferent readings of another version.\r\n\r\nThe different copies or versions used are distinguished as follow;--\r\n\r\nMyvyrian        1   E. Evans      5\r\nD. Ellis        2   P. Panton     6\r\nDitto           3   E. Davies     7\r\nD. Thomas       4   Dr. Meyer     8\r\n\r\nNos 1 and 6 are those which are printed in the Archaiology of Wales, vol.\r\ni.  All words that differ in form or meaning, though not in orthography,\r\nfrom those of No. 7, are duly arranged at the foot of the page {0l}, from\r\nwhich it will be seen that 1, 2, 3, 5, generally agree one with the\r\nother, whilst 4 and 6 also for the most part go together.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, moreover, that though we have taken No. 7 as our\r\ntext, we have not servilely confined ourself to it, but that wherever any\r\nof the other versions have been considered preferable, we have\r\nunhesitatingly adopted them.  The different meanings, however, are\r\ngenerally inserted in the notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country situate between the Humber and the Clyde in North Britain\r\nwas, for the most part, originally occupied by the Cymry, who here, as\r\nwell as in the west, displayed no mean valour in opposition to the Roman\r\narms.  The latter certainly prevailed; nevertheless it is to be noticed\r\nthat they did not finally destroy, nor indeed to any material extent\r\nalter the national features of Prydyn.  This is evident from the manner\r\nin which the conquerors thought fit to incorporate into their own\r\ngeographical vocabulary many of the local names, which they found already\r\nin use; and above all from the purely ancestral character which the\r\nnative chieftains exhibited on emerging from the Roman ruins in the fifth\r\ncentury.  Indeed to permit the defeated princes, under certain\r\nrestrictions, to enjoy their former rights and jurisdictions, was\r\nperfectly in accordance with the usual policy of the Romans, as we may\r\nlearn from the testimony of Tacitus, who remarks, in reference to the\r\nBritish king Cogidunus, that they granted to him certain states according\r\nto ancient custom, and the reason assigned is that they might have even\r\nkings as instruments of slavery. {1a}  The homage of the subjugated\r\nprovinces seems to have consisted principally in the payment of a tribute\r\nof money, and the furnishing of soldiers for foreign service.\r\n\r\nSuch, no doubt, was the position of Cunedda Wledig, who \"began to reign\r\nabout A.D. 328, and died in 389\"; {1b} and who, according to the Historia\r\nBritonum attributed to Nennius, \"venerat de parte sinistrali, id est, de\r\nregione quae vocatur Manau Guotodin,\" {1c} the heights of Gododin, and\r\nthe same apparently with the territory of the Ottadeni.\r\n\r\nIn the Myvyrian Archaiology, v. 1, p. 71, is printed an Elegy on Cunedda,\r\nthe work of one who had actually partaken of his royal munificence, who\r\nhad received from him \"milch cows, horses, wine, oil, and a host of\r\nslaves.\"  The writer with respect to the martial prowess of his patron,\r\nobserves,\r\n\r\n    \"Trembling with fear of Cunedda,\r\n    Will be Caer Weir and Caer Liwelydd.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again,\r\n\r\n    \"A hundred times ere his shield was shattered in battle,\r\n    Bryneich obeyed his commands in the conflict.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern names of the localities, mentioned in these extracts, are\r\nrespectively Warwick, Carlisle {2a} and Bernicia.  The two latter are in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the Ottadeni; the former, being further\r\nremoved, would indicate the direction and extent of his arms.\r\n\r\nFrom other sources we learn that Cunedda was the son of Edeyrn ab Padarn\r\nPeisrudd, by Gwawl, daughter of Coel Godebog, and that he was entitled,\r\nin right of his mother, to certain territories in Wales.  When these were\r\ninvaded by the Gwyddyl, his sons, twelve in number, left their northern\r\nhome for the purpose of recovering the same, in which they were\r\nsuccessful, though the enemy was not finally extirpated until the battle\r\nat Cerrig y Gwyddyl, in the succeeding generation.  It is asserted by\r\nsome that Cunedda accompanied his sons in this expedition, and that it\r\nwas undertaken as much through inability to retain possession of their\r\nmore immediate dominions, as from the desire of acquiring or regaining\r\nother lands.  However, though the sons settled in Wales and on its\r\nborders, it is more accordant with the drift of the Poem, already cited,\r\nto suppose that Cunedda himself died in the North.  Nevertheless, it is\r\nundoubted that the native chieftains began to suffer in that part of the\r\nisland from barbarian incursions even before the departure of the Romans.\r\nThus Ammianus Marcellinus, with reference to the year 364, bears\r\ntestimony, that \"the Picts and Saxons and Scots and Attacots harassed the\r\nBritons with continual oppressions.\" {2b}\r\n\r\nThe final abandonment of the island by the Romans occurred, according to\r\nZosimus, about A.D. 408 or 409, at which time the native princes arose to\r\nthe full enjoyment of feudal dignity and power.  In the North, among\r\nothers, we find Pabo Post Prydain, a descendant of Coel Godebog in the\r\n4th degree, and Cynvarch Oer, a member of another branch of the same\r\nfamily; both of whom, however, were compelled by the inroads of the\r\npredatory hordes, to leave their territories and seek refuge in Wales,\r\nthough it would appear that Urien, son of the latter, succeeded\r\nsubsequently in recovering his paternal dominion.\r\n\r\nThe struggle continued, and the enemies had gradually extended themselves\r\nalong the coasts, when in 547 they received an important reinforcement by\r\nthe arrival of Ida with forty ships.  Gododin, Deivyr, and Bryneich,\r\nbeing situated on the eastern shore, would be especially exposed to the\r\nravages of these marauders.  Indeed it does not appear that Gododin ever\r\nrecovered its pristine independence after the death of Cunedda, at least\r\nwe do not hear that any of his sons subsequently asserted their claims to\r\nit, or had anything to do with the administration of its government: they\r\nall seem to have ended their days in their western dominions.  Deivyr and\r\nBryneich, however, were more fortunate, for we find that they were ruled\r\nas late as the 6th century by British monarchs, among whom are named\r\nGall, Diffedell, and Disgyrnin, the sons of Disgyvyndawd; {3a} though\r\nthere is reason to believe that at that time they were in treacherous\r\nalliance with the Saxons.  A Triad positively affirms, that \"there were\r\nnone of the Lloegrwys who did not coalesce with the Saxons, save such as\r\nwere found in Cornwall, and in the Commot of Carnoban in Deivyr and\r\nBryneich.\" {3b}  And it is a remarkable fact, as corroborative of this\r\nstatement, that the Cymry ever after, as may be seen in the works of the\r\nBards, applied the term Bryneich to such of their kindred as joined with\r\nthe enemies of their country.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that, at the period of our Poem, the people of the three\r\nprovinces in question were open enemies of the Cymry, as appears from\r\nstanzas iii, v, and ix.  When we see there how the Bard commends one hero\r\nfor not yielding to the army of Gododin, and celebrates the praise of\r\nanother who committed an immense slaughter amongst the men of Deivyr and\r\nBryneich, and threatens, in the case of a third party, that if they were\r\nsuspected of leaning to the Bernician interest, he would himself raise\r\nhis hand against them, we can come to no other conclusion than that those\r\ncountries were arrayed against the Cymry when the battle of Cattraeth\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nIda had to encounter a powerful opponent in the person of Urien, king of\r\nRheged, a district in or near which Cattraeth lay, as we infer from two\r\npoems of Taliesin.  Thus, one entitled \"Gwaith Gwenystrad,\" commences\r\nwith the words,\r\n\r\n    \"Extol the men of Cattraeth, who, with the dawn,\r\n    Went with their victorious leader\r\n    Urien, a renowned elder.\" {3c}\r\n\r\nIn the other, called \"Yspail Taliesin,\" Urien is styled \"Glyw Cattraeth,\"\r\nthe ruler of Cattraeth. {4a}  At the same time he is generally spoken of\r\nunder the title of Rheged's chief.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the hostile forces in the battle of Gwenystrad is not\r\nnamed, but in the battle of Argoed Llwyvein we find him to be Flamddwyn\r\nor the Torch bearer, a name by which the Britons delighted to designate\r\nthe formidable Ida.  Flamddwyn's army on this occasion consisted of four\r\nlegions, which reached from Argoed to Arvynydd, and against them were\r\narrayed the men of Goddeu and Rheged, under the command of Ceneu ab Coel,\r\nand Owain, and \"Urien the prince.\"\r\n\r\nArgoed, bordering on Deivyr and Bryneich, was ruled by Llywarch Hen, who\r\nafter his abdication and flight into Powys, pathetically records the\r\nloyal attachment of his former subjects,--\r\n\r\n    \"The men of Argoed have ever supported me.\" {4b}\r\n\r\nThe Historia Britonum enumerates three other kings, who with Urien fought\r\nagainst the Saxons in the North, viz., Rhydderch, Gwallawg, and Morgant,\r\nthough the latter, under the impulse of envy, procured the assassination\r\nof Urien, in the Isle of Lindisfarne.\r\n\r\nAfter the Saxons had finally established themselves on the eastern coast,\r\nin the forementioned countries, an immense rampart, extending nearly from\r\nthe Solway to the Frith of Forth, was erected, either with the view of\r\nchecking their further progress westward, or else by mutual consent of\r\nthe two nations, as a mere line of demarcation between their respective\r\ndominions.  This wall cannot have an earlier date, for it runs through\r\nthe middle of the country originally occupied by the Gadeni, and could\r\nnot of course have been constructed as a boundary by them; nor can it be\r\nreferred to a more recent period, as there could be no reason for forming\r\nsuch a fence after the Saxons had intruded upon the whole country which\r\nit divides.  This was the famous CATRAIL, which we presume to be\r\nidentical with CATTRAETH, where the disastrous battle of that name, as\r\nsung by Aneurin, was fought.\r\n\r\nCatrail means literally \"the war fence\" (cad-rhail), but on the\r\nsupposition that it is synonymous with Cattraeth, the rhyme in the\r\nGododin would determine the latter to be the correct term, or that by\r\nwhich Aneurin distinguished the line.  The meaning of Cattraeth would be\r\neither \"the war tract\" (cad-traeth), or \"the legal war fence\"\r\n(cad-rhaith); the latter of which would give some countenance to the idea\r\nthat it was formed by mutual agreement.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of the Catrail, which may be traced from the vicinity of\r\nGalashiels to Peel-fell, is upwards of forty five miles.  The most entire\r\nparts of it show that it was originally a broad and deep fosse; having on\r\neach side a rampart, which was formed of the natural soil, that was\r\nthrown from the ditch, intermixed with some stones.  Its dimensions vary\r\nin different places, which may be owing to its remains being more or less\r\nperfect.  In those parts where it is pretty entire, the fosse is twenty\r\nseven, twenty six, and twenty five feet broad.  But in those places where\r\nthe rampart has been most demolished the fosse only measures twenty two\r\nand a half feet, twenty and eighteen, and in one place only sixteen feet\r\nwide.  As the ramparts sloped on the inside, it is obvious that in\r\nproportion as they were demolished, the width of the fosse within would\r\nbe diminished.  In some of the most entire parts the ramparts are from\r\nsix to seven, and even nine or ten feet high, and from eight to ten and\r\ntwelve feet thick.  They are, no doubt, less now than they were\r\noriginally, owing to the effects of time and tillage. {5a}\r\n\r\nSuch is the Catrail, and were it identical with Cattraeth, we should\r\nnaturally expect to meet with some allusions to a work of that\r\ndescription in the body of the Poem.  Nor are we herein disappointed, for\r\nthe expressions \"ffosawd,\" {5b} \"clawdd,\" {5c} \"ffin,\" {5d} \"cladd\r\nclodvawr,\" {5e} \"goglawdd,\" {5f} \"clawdd gwernin,\" {5g} and \"gorffin\r\nGododin,\" {5h} are undoubtedly such allusions, though we readily admit\r\nthat some of them may, and probably do, refer to the ordinary circular\r\nforts of the Britons, of whom there are several along the line.  It may\r\nbe added here that Taliesin in his description of the battle of\r\nGwenystrad, where the men of Cattraeth fought under Urien, speaks of a\r\n\"govwr\" or an intrenchment, that was \"assailed by the laborious toil of\r\nwarriors.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus satisfied ourselves as to the nature and locality of\r\nCattraeth; the general subject of the Poem becomes apparent.  It was a\r\nbattle fought at the barrier in question between the Cymry and the\r\nSaxons, the most extended in its design and operations on the part of the\r\nformer, as it proved to them the most disastrous in its results, of all\r\nthat had hitherto taken place between the two people in that part of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe details of this bloody encounter, as we gather them from the Poem,\r\nwere as follow: At the call of Mynyddawg, lord of Eiddin, whose dominions\r\nlay peculiarly exposed, both by sea and land, to the attack of the enemy,\r\nthe native chieftains of Prydyn, aided by many of their relatives and\r\nfriends from Gwynedd and Cernyw, entered into a mutual alliance in behalf\r\nof their common country. {6a}  In one place the daughter of Eudav {6b} is\r\njoined with Mynyddawg, as one upon whose errand the expedition was\r\nundertaken, but whether she was his wife, or ruled over a territory\r\nadjacent to, or equally threatened with his own, does not appear.  The\r\ntroops under their respective leaders arrived at Eiddin, where they were\r\nsumptuously entertained by Mynyddawg, {6c} and where they established\r\ntheir head quarters.  The generals named in the Poem amount in number to\r\nabout ninety, but this was not the third part of the whole, which\r\nconsisted of \"three hundred and sixty three chieftains wearing the golden\r\ntorques.\" {6d}  The aggregate number of men that followed these\r\nillustrious leaders is not told, but if an average may be formed from\r\nwhat we know respecting a few cases, it will appear to have been immense.\r\nMynyddawg's retinue consisted of \"three hundred;\" {6e} there were \"five\r\nbattalions of five hundred men each,\" \"three levies of three hundred\r\neach;\" \"three bold knights\" had each \"three hundred of equal quality;\"\r\n{6f} thus averaging about four hundred for each commander, which,\r\nmultiplied by three hundred and sixty three, would exhibit an\r\noverwhelming army of a hundred and forty five thousand, and two hundred\r\nmen!  Yet the Poet describes the numerical advantages possessed by the\r\nenemy as greatly superior.\r\n\r\nThese forces, being all placed on the western side of the dyke, would\r\napproach the land of their enemies as they marched to the field of\r\nbattle, hence the reason why Aneurin uses the expressions \"Gwyr a aeth\r\nGattraeth,\" and \"Gwyr a aeth Gododin,\" as synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe enemies, as before observed, were the Saxons, aided on this occasion\r\nby many of the Lloegrians, namely, such of the natives as had submitted\r\nto their sway in the provinces they had already conquered.  They\r\nconcentrated their forces in Gododin, and marched westward in the\r\ndirection of the great fence, where the Britons were awaiting them.\r\nAneurin has not thought fit to record the names of any of their generals,\r\nwith the single exception of Dyvnwal Vrych, {7a} who, to entitle him to\r\nthat distinction, must have figured prominently on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe engagement commenced on a Tuesday, and continued for a whole week,\r\nthe last four days being the most bloody. {7b}  For some time both\r\nparties fought gallantly, and with almost equal success; fortune perhaps\r\nupon the whole appearing to favour the Cymry, who not only slew a vast\r\nnumber of their adversaries, but partially succeeded in recovering their\r\nlost dominions. {7c}  At this critical juncture a dwarfish herald arrived\r\nat the fence, proposing on the part of the Saxons a truce or compact,\r\nwhich, however, was indignantly rejected by the natives, and the action\r\nrenewed. {7d}  The scales now rapidly turned.  In one part of the field\r\nsuch a terrible carnage ensued, that there was but one man left to scare\r\naway the birds of prey, which hovered over the carcases of the slain.\r\n{7e}  In another, where our Bard was stationed, a portion of the allied\r\narmy, owing to the absence of its general, became panic stricken. {7f}\r\nAneurin was taken prisoner, hurried off to a cave or dungeon, and loaded\r\nwith chains. {7g}  At length a conference was submitted to, which was\r\nheld at a place called Llanveithin, at which Aneurin, who had been\r\nforcibly liberated by one of the sons of Llywarch Hen, insisted upon the\r\nrestoration of part of Gododin, or the alternative of continuing the\r\nfight.  The Saxon herald met the proposal by killing the British Bard\r\nOwain, who was of course unarmed. {7h}  Such a violation of privilege\r\nexcited then the whole energies of the Cymry, who rose as one man, and\r\ngave the entire scene a more bloody character than it had yet presented.\r\n\r\nVictory, however, at length proclaimed in favour of the usurpers, and so\r\ndecisively, that out of the three hundred and sixty three chieftains that\r\nwent to the field of Cattraeth, three only returned alive, Cynon, and\r\nCadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant, besides Aneurin himself. {7i}  The\r\nnumber of common soldiers that fell must be conjectured.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the battle commenced on a Tuesday; it would appear from\r\ntwo passages, namely, where the meeting of reapers in the hall of Eiddin,\r\n{7j} and the employment of Gwynwydd in protecting the corn on the\r\nhighlands, {8a} are spoken of, that the time of year in which it occurred\r\nwas the harvest.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, so easy to determine the exact year when all this\r\nhappened.  Neither Arthur nor Urien are mentioned as being present, and\r\nthough the stanzas containing their names may have been lost, it must be\r\nadmitted that in the case of such distinguished warriors reason will not\r\nwarrant the supposition: the fair inference would be that they were dead\r\nat the time.  This view is, moreover, supported by readings of the\r\nGododin, where certain heroes are compared to the said chiefs\r\nrespectively, \"of Arthur,\" \"un Urien,\" which would hardly have been done\r\nhad these latter been alive.  The death of Arthur is placed in the year\r\n542; Owain, who died at Cattraeth, slew Ida, A.D. 560, and Urien is said\r\nto have been assassinated about 567; the battle under consideration must\r\nhave happened subsequently, probably about the year usually assigned it,\r\nviz., 570.  This was in the reign of Rhun, a descendant in the 4th degree\r\nof Cunedda Wledig, King of Gododin!\r\n\r\nThe vulgar opinion is that the Britons lost the battle in consequence of\r\nhaving marched to the field in a state of intoxication; and it must be\r\nadmitted that there are many passages in the Poem, which, simply\r\nconsidered, would seem to favour that view.  Nevertheless, granting that\r\nthe 363 chieftains had indulged too freely in their favourite beverage,\r\nit is hardly credible that the bulk of the army, on which mainly depended\r\nthe destiny of the battle, had the same opportunity of rendering\r\nthemselves equally incapacitated, or, if we suppose that all had become\r\nso, that they did not recover their sobriety in seven days!  The fact\r\nappears to be, that Aneurin in the instances alluded to, intends merely\r\nto contrast the social and festive habits of his countrymen at home with\r\ntheir lives of toil and privation in war, after a practise common to the\r\nBards, not only of that age, but subsequently.  Or it may be that the\r\nbanquet, at which the British leaders were undoubtedly entertained in the\r\nhall of Eiddin, was looked upon as the sure prelude to war, and that in\r\nthat sense the mead and wine were to them as poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nY GODODIN\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGredyf gwr oed gwas\r\nGwrhyt am dias\r\nMeirch mwth myngvras\r\nA dan vordwyt megyrwas\r\nYsgwyt ysgauyn

in the din of war;\r\nFleet, thick-maned chargers {79b}\r\nWere ridden {79c} by the illustrious hero;\r\nA shield, light and broad,\r\nHung on the flank of his swift and slender steed;\r\nHis sword was blue and gleaming,\r\nHis spurs were of gold, {80a} his raiment was woollen. {80b}\r\nIt will not be my part\r\nTo speak of thee reproachfully,\r\nA more choice act of mine will be\r\nTo celebrate thy praise in song;\r\nThou hast gone to a bloody bier,\r\nSooner than to a nuptial feast; {80c}\r\nThou hast become a meal for ravens,\r\nEre thou didst reach the front of conflict. {80d}\r\nAlas, Owain! my beloved friend;\r\nIt is not meet that he should be devoured by ravens! {81a}\r\nThere is swelling sorrow {82a} in the plain,\r\nWhere fell in death the only son of Marro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdorned with his wreath, leader of rustic warriors, {82b} whenever he\r\ncame\r\nBy his troop unattended, {83a} before maidens would he serve the mead;\r\nBut the front of his shield would be pierced, {83b} if ever he heard\r\nThe shout of war; no quarter would he give to those whom he pursued;\r\nNor would he retreat from the combat until blood flowed;\r\nAnd he cut down like rushes {83c} the men who would not yield.\r\nThe Gododin relates, that on the coast of Mordei, {84a}\r\nBefore the tents of Madog, when he returned,\r\nBut one man in a hundred with him came. {84b}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdorned with his wreath, the chief of toil, his country's rod {84c} of\r\npower,\r\nDarted like an eagle {84d} to our harbours, {84e} when allured\r\nTo the compact {85a} that had been formed; his ensign was beloved, {85b}\r\nMore nobly was his emblazoned resolution {85c} performed, for he\r\nretreated not,\r\nWith a shrinking mind, {85d} before the host of Gododin.\r\nManawyd, {85e} with confidence and strength thou pressest upon the\r\ntumultuous fight,\r\nNor dost thou regard {86a} either spear or shield;\r\nNo habitation rich in dainties can be found,\r\nThat has been kept out of the reach of thy warriors' charge. {86b}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdorned with a wreath was the leader, {87a} the wolf {87b} of the holme,\r\nAmber beads {87c} in ringlets encircled his temples; {87d}\r\nPrecious was the amber, worth a banquet of wine. {87e}\r\nHe repelled the violence of men, as they glided along;\r\nFor Venedotia and the North would have come to his share,\r\nBy the advice of the son of Ysgyran, {88a}\r\nThe hero of the broken shield. {88b}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdorned with his wreath was the leader, and armed in the noisy conflict;\r\nChief object of observation {88c} was the hero, and powerful in the gory\r\nfield,\r\nChief fighter {88d} in the advanced division, in front of the hosts;\r\nFive battalions {89a} fell before his blades;\r\nEven of the men of Deivyr and Bryneich, {89b} uttering groans,\r\nTwenty hundred perished in one short hour;\r\nSooner did he feed the wolf {90a} with his carcase, than go to the\r\nnuptial feast; {90b}\r\nHe sooner became the raven's prey, than approached the altar; {90c}\r\nHe had not raised the spear ere his blood streamed to the ground; {90d}\r\nThis was the price of mead in the hall, amidst the throng;\r\nHyveidd Hir {90e} shall be celebrated whilst there remains a minstrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Gododin, and Gognaw laughed, {91a}\r\nBut bitter were they in the battle, {91b} when they stood arranged\r\naccording to their several banners;\r\nFew were the years of peace which they had enjoyed;\r\nThe son of Botgad caused a throbbing by the energy of his hand;\r\nThey should have gone to churches to do penance,\r\nThe old and the young, the bold and the mighty; {91c}\r\nThe inevitable strife of death was about to pierce them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Gododin, Gwanar {92a} laughed,\r\nAs his jewelled army {92b} went down {92c} to the terrific toil.\r\nThou slayest them with blades, when there is not much chattering;\r\nThou, powerful supporter of the living law, producest the silence of\r\ndeath. {92d}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Cattraeth, loquacious was the host;\r\nBlue {93a} mead was their liquor, and it proved their poison; {93b}\r\nIn marshalled array they cut through the engines of war; {93c}\r\nAnd after the joyful cry, silence {93d} ensued!\r\nThey should have gone to churches to perform penance;\r\nThe inevitable strife of death was about to pierce them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Cattraeth, filled with mead and drunk,\r\nCompact and vigorous; {94a} I should wrong them were I to neglect their\r\nfame;\r\nAround the mighty, red, and murky blades,\r\nObstinately and fiercely the dogs of war {94b} would fight;\r\nIf I had judged you to be of the tribe of Bryneich, {94c}\r\nNot the phantom of a man would I have left alive. {94d}\r\nI lost a friend, myself being unhurt,\r\nAs he openly withstood the terror of the parental chief;\r\nMagnanimously did he refuse the dowry of his father-in-law; {94e}\r\nSuch was the son of Cian {95a} from the stone of Gwyngwn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Cattraeth with the dawn;\r\nTheir peace was disturbed by those who feared them;\r\nA hundred thousand with three hundred {95b} engaged in mutual overthrow;\r\nDrenched in gore, they marked the fall of the lances; {96a}\r\nThe post of war {96b} was most manfully and with gallantry maintained,\r\nBefore the retinue of Mynyddawg the Courteous. {96c}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Cattraeth with the dawn;\r\nFeelingly did their relatives {96d} regret their absence;\r\nMead they drank, yellow, sweet, ensnaring;\r\nThat year is the point to which many {96e} a minstrel turns;\r\nRedder were their swords than their plumes, {97a}\r\nTheir blades were white as lime, {97b} and into four parts were their\r\nhelmets cloven, {97c}\r\nEven those of {97d} the retinue of Mynyddawg the Courteous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes marched to Cattraeth with the day;\r\nWas not the most celebrated of battles disgraced? {97e}\r\nThey put to death {98a} Gelorwydd\r\nWith blades. The gem of Baptism {98b}was thus widely taunted;--\r\n\"Better that you should, ere you join your kindred,\r\nHave a gory unction {98c} and death far from your native homes,\r\nAt the hand of the host of Gododin, when the day arrives.\"\r\nIs not a hero's power best when tempered with discretion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hero {98d} marched to Cattraeth with the day;\r\nTruly {99a} he quaffed the white mead on serene nights; {99b}\r\nMiserable, though success had been predicted, {99c}\r\nProved his mission, which he undertook through soaring ambition; {99d}\r\nThere hastened not to Cattraeth\r\nA chief, with such a magnificent design of enterprize\r\nBlazoned on his standard;\r\nNever was there such a host\r\nFrom the fort of Eiddin, {99e}\r\nThat would scatter abroad the mounted ravagers.\r\nTudvwlch Hir, {100a} deprived of {100b} his land and towns,\r\nSlaughtered the Saxons for seven days; {100c}\r\nHis valour should have protected him in freedom; {100d}\r\nHis memory is cherished by his fair {100e} associates;\r\nWhen Tudvwlch arrived, the supporter of the land, {100f}\r\nThe post of the son of Kilydd {100g} became a plain of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes {100h} marched to Cattraeth with the dawn,\r\nBut none of them received protection from their shields,\r\nTo blood they resorted, being assembled in gleaming armour; {101a}\r\nIn the van was, loud as thunder, the din of targets. {101b}\r\nThe envious, the fickle, and the base,\r\nWould he tear and pierce with halberts;\r\nFrom an elevated position {101c} he slew, with a blade,\r\nIn iron affliction, {101d} their steel-clad commander; {101e}\r\nHe subdued the Mordei that owed him homage; {101f}\r\nBefore Erthai {102a} even an army groaned. {102b}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the tale shall be told of the battle of Cattraeth,\r\nThe people will utter sighs; {102c} long has been their grief on account\r\nof the warriors' absence;\r\nThere will be a dominion without a sovereign, {102d} and a smoking land.\r\nThe sons of Godebog, an upright clan,\r\nBore the furrower {102e} on a long bier.\r\nMiserable {103a} was the fate, though just the necessity,\r\nDecreed for Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch the Tall; {103b}\r\nTogether they drank the bright mead by the light {103c} of torches,\r\n{103d}\r\nThough pleasant to the taste, it proved a lasting foe. {103e}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore, above the splendid fort of Eching {103f} he shewed a frowning\r\naspect; {103g}\r\nWhilst young and forward men composed his retinue;\r\nBefore, on the Bludwe, {104a} would the horn cheer his heart, {104b}\r\nMaking all the Mordei full of joy; {104c}\r\nBefore, his beverage would be braggett;\r\nBefore, he displayed the grandeur of gold and rich purple;\r\nBefore, pampered steeds would bear him safe away,\r\nEven Gwarthlev, who deserved a comely name; {104d}\r\nBefore, the victorious chief would turn aside the ebbing tide;\r\nHis command was ever to go forward, {105a} loth was he to skulk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the early leader,\r\nThe sun, is about to ascend,\r\nSovereign of the revolving {105b} lights, {105c}\r\nIn the heaven of Britain's isle. {105d}\r\nDireful was the flight before the shaking\r\nOf the shield of the pursuing victor; {105e}\r\nBright {105f} was the horn\r\nIn the hall of Eiddin; {105g}\r\nWith pomp was he bidden {105h}\r\nTo the feast of intoxicating mead;\r\nHe drank the beverage of wine,\r\nAt the meeting of reapers; {106a}\r\nHe drank transparent wine,\r\nWith a battle-daring purpose. {106b}\r\nThe reapers sang of war,\r\nWar with the shining wing; {106c}\r\nThe minstrels sang of war,\r\nOf harnessed {106d} war,\r\nOf winged war.\r\nNo shield was unexpanded {107a}\r\nIn the conflict of spears;\r\nOf equal age they fell {107b}\r\nIn the struggle of battle.\r\nUnshaken in the tumult,\r\nWithout dishonour {107c} did he retaliate on the foe;\r\nBuried {107d} was whoever he willed,\r\nEre the grave of the gigantic {107e} Gwrveling\r\nItself became a green sward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complement {107f} of the surrounding country {107g}\r\nWere, three forward chiefs of the Novantae; {107h}\r\nFive battalions of five hundred men each; {108a}\r\nThree levies {108b} of three hundred each;\r\nThree hundred knights of battle {108c}\r\nFrom Eiddin, arrayed in golden armour;\r\nThree loricated hosts,\r\nWith three kings wearing the golden torques; {108d}\r\nThree bold knights,\r\nWith three hundred of equal quality;\r\nThree of the same order, mutually jealous,\r\nBitterly would they chase the foe,\r\nThree dreadful in the toil;\r\nThey would kill a lion flat as lead. {108e}\r\nThere was in the war a collection of gold. {108f}\r\nThree sovereigns of the people\r\nCame from amongst the Brython, {109a}\r\nCynrig and Cynon {109b}\r\nAnd Cynrain {109c} from Aeron, {109d}\r\nTo greet {110a} the ashen lances {110b}\r\nOf the men who dropped from Deivyr. {110c}\r\nCame there from the Brython,\r\nA better man than Cynon,\r\nWho proved a serpent to his sullen foes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI drank of the wine and the mead of the Mordei;\r\nGreat was the quantity of spears,\r\nIn the assembly of the warriors;\r\nHe {110d} was solemnising a banquet for the eagle.\r\nWhen Cydywal {110e} hurried forth to battle, he raised\r\nThe shout with the green dawn, and dealt out tribulation, {110f}\r\nAnd splintered shields about the ground he left,\r\nAnd darts of awful tearing did he hew down;\r\nIn the battle, the foremost in the van he wounded.\r\nThe son of Syvno, {111a} the astronomer, knew,\r\nThat he who sold his life,\r\nIn the face of warning,\r\nWith sharpened blades would slaughter,\r\nBut would himself be slain by spears and crosses. {111b}\r\nAccording to the compact, {111c} he meditated a convenient attack,\r\nAnd would boast {111d} of a pile of carcases\r\nOf gallant men of toil,\r\nWhom in the upper part of Gwynedd {111e} he pierced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI drank of the wine and the mead of the Mordei,\r\nAnd because I drank, I fell by the edge of a gleaming sword, {112a}\r\nNot without desiring a hero's prowess; {112b}\r\nAnd when all fell, thou didst also fall. {112c}\r\nThus when the issue comes, it were well not to have sinned.\r\nPresent, in his thrusting course, showed a bold and mighty arm. {112d}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heroes who marched to Cattraeth were renowned,\r\nWine and mead out of golden goblets was their beverage,\r\nThat year was to them one of exalted solemnity,\r\nThree hundred and sixty-three chieftains, wearing the golden torques;\r\n{113a}\r\nOf those who hurried forth after the excess of revelling,\r\nBut three escaped by valour from the funeral fosse, {113b}\r\nThe two war-dogs {114a} of Aeron, and Cynon the dauntless, {114b}\r\nAnd myself, from the spilling of blood, the reward of my candid song.\r\n{114c}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend in real distress, we should have been by none disturbed,\r\nHad not the white-bannered commander {115a} led forth his army;\r\nWe should not {115b} have been separated in the hall from the banquet of\r\nmead,\r\nHad he not laid waste our convenient groves; {115c}\r\nHe crept into the martial field, he crept into our families. {115d}\r\nThe Gododin relates how that, after the fight in the fosse,\r\nWhen we had no dwellings, {116a} none were more destitute. {116b}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nScattered, broken, motionless is the weapon, {116c}\r\nThat used to penetrate through the great horde, {116d} the numerous\r\n{117a} horde of the Lloegrians. {117b}\r\nShields were strewn on the sea coast, {117c} shields in the battle of\r\nlances;\r\nMen were reduced to ashes, {117d}\r\nAnd women rendered widows,\r\nBefore his death. {117e}\r\nO Graid, son of Hoewgi, {117f}\r\nWith thy spears\r\nDidst thou cause an effusion of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was the hero, with both his shoulders covered, {118a}\r\nBy a variegated shield, and possessing the swiftness of a warlike steed;\r\nThere was a noise in the mount of slaughter, {118b} there was fire,\r\n{118c}\r\nImpetuous were the lances, there was a sunny gleam, {118d}\r\nThere was food for ravens, the raven there did triumph, {118e}\r\nAnd before he would let them go free,\r\nWith the morning dew, like the eagle in his glad course,\r\nHe scattered them on either side, and like a billow overwhelmed them in\r\nfront.\r\nThe Bards of the world judge those to be men of valour,\r\nWhose counsels are not divulged to slaves. {119a}\r\nThe spears in the hands of the warriors were causing devastation;\r\nAnd ere was interred under {119b} the swan-white steed, {119c}\r\nOne who had been energetic in his commands,\r\nHis gore had thoroughly washed his armour: {119d}\r\nSuch was Buddvan, {119e} the son of Bleiddvan the Bold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt were wrong not to record his magnificent feat;\r\nHe would not leave an open gap, through cowardice; {120a}\r\nThe benefit of Britain's minstrels never quitted his court\r\nUpon the calends of January; {120b} according to his design, {120c}\r\nHis land should not be ploughed, though it might become wild;\r\nHe was a mighty dragon of indignant disposition;\r\nA commander in the bloody field, {120d} after the feast of wine,\r\nWas Gwenabwy {121a} the son of Gwen, {121b} in the strife of Cattraeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue it was, as the songs relate, {121c}\r\nNo one's steeds {121d} overtook Marchleu;\r\nThe lances {121e} hurled by the commanding earl,\r\nIn his prancing career, {121f} strewed a thick path;\r\nAs he had been reared for slaughter by the aid of my mother, {121g}\r\nFurious was the stroke of his sword whilst lending support to others;\r\n{121h}\r\nAshen shafts were scattered from the grasp of his hand, {122a}\r\nAbove the narrow summit {122b} of the solemn pile, {122c}\r\nThe place where one caused the smoke to ascend; {122d}\r\nHe would slaughter with the blade, whilst his arms were full of furze;\r\n{122e}\r\nAs when a reaping comes in the interval of fine weather, {122f}\r\nWould Marchleu {123a} make the blood to flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLower down {123b} was sent from the southern region, {123c}\r\nOne whose conduct {123d} resembled the flowing sea;

{168e}\r\nTheir grasp satisfied the hunger {168f} of the eagles of Clwyd, {168g}\r\nAnd prepared food for the birds of prey.\r\nOf those who went to Cattraeth, wearers of the golden chain,\r\nUpon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,\r\nThere came not honourably {169a} in behalf {169b} of the Brython,\r\nTo Gododin, a hero from afar who was better than Cynon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent to sing of so many men of skill, {169c}\r\nWho in their halls {169d} once led a merry life: {169e}\r\nAmbitious {169f} and bold, all round the world would Eidol {169g} seek\r\nfor melody;\r\nBut notwithstanding gold, and fine steeds, and intoxicating mead,\r\nOnly one man of these, who loved the world, returned,\r\nCynddilig of Aeron, one of the Novantian heroes. {169h}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent to sing of the gay and illustrious tribes,\r\nThat went upon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,\r\nAnd the daughter {170a} of Eudav the Tall, of a faultless gait, {170b}\r\nApparelled in her purple robes, thoroughly and truly splendid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers {171a} celebrated the praise of the Holy One,\r\nAnd in their {171b} presence was kindled a fire that raged on high.\r\nOn Tuesday they put on their dark-brown garments; {171c}\r\nOn Wednesday they purified their enamelled armour;\r\nOn Thursday their destruction was certain;\r\nOn Friday was brought carnage all around;\r\nOn Saturday their joint labour was useless;\r\nOn Sunday their blades assumed a ruddy hue;\r\nOn Monday was seen a pool knee deep of blood. {171d}\r\nThe Gododin relates that after the toil,\r\nBefore the tents of Madog, when he returned,\r\nOnly one man in a hundred with him came. {172a}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the early dawn of morn, {172b}\r\nThere was a battle at the fall of the river, {172c} in front of the\r\ncourse; {172d}\r\nThe pass and the knoll were pervaded with fire; {172e}\r\nLike a boar didst thou {172f} lead to the mount;\r\nThe wealth {172g} of the hill, and the place,\r\nAnd the dark brown hawks {173a} were stained with gore. {173b}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuickly rising, in a moment of time, {173c}\r\nAfter kindling a fire at the confluence, {173d} in front of the fence,\r\n{173e}\r\nAfter leading his men in close array,\r\nIn front of a hundred he pierces the foremost. {173f}\r\nSad it was that you should have made a pool of blood,\r\nAs if you but drank mead in the midst of laughter; {174a}\r\nBut it was brave of you to slay the little man, {174b}\r\nWith the fierce and impetuous stroke of the sword;\r\nFor like the unrestrained ocean {174c} had the foe {174d} put to death\r\nA man, who would otherwise have been in rank his equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe fell headlong down the precipice, {174e}\r\nAnd the bushes {174f} supported not his noble {174g} head;\r\nIt was a violation of privilege to kill him on the breach, {175a}\r\nIt was a primary law that Owain should ascend upon the course, {175b}\r\nAnd extend before the onset the branch of peace, {175c}\r\nAnd that he should pursue the study of meet {175d} and learned strains.\r\nExcellent man, the assuager of tumult and battle,\r\nWhose very grasp dreaded a sword, {175e}\r\nAnd who bore in his hand an empty corslet. {175f}\r\nO sovereign, dispense rewards\r\nOut of his earthly shrine. {176a}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEidol, with frigid blood and pale complexion,\r\nSpreading carnage, when the maid was supreme in judgment;

{177c}\r\nStout youth, the freshness of his form was stained with blood,\r\nHis accoutrements resounded, his chargers made a clang; {177d}\r\nHis cheeks {177e} are covered with armour,\r\nAnd thus, image of death, he scatters desolation in the toil;\r\nIn the first onset his lances penetrate the targets, {177f}\r\nAnd a track of surrounding light is made by the aim of the darting of his\r\nspears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe saints {178a} exert their courage, {178b} for the destruction of thy\r\nretreat, {178c}\r\nAnd the cellar, {178d} which contained, and where was brewed {178e}\r\nThe mead, that sweet ensnarer.\r\nWith the dawn does Gwrys {178f} make the battle clash;\r\nFair gift, {178g}--marshal of the Lloegrian tribes;

{179a}\r\nThough thou hast kindled the land {179b} before thy fall,\r\nAt the extreme boundary {179c} of Gododin will be thy grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvolved in vapours was the man {179d} accustomed to armies,\r\nHigh minded, bitter handed leader of the forces; {179e}\r\nHe was expert, and ardent, and stately,\r\nThough at the social banquet he was not harsh. {180a}\r\nThey {180b} removed and possessed his valuable treasures,\r\nAnd not the image of a thing for the benefit of the region was left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are called!  The sea and the borders are in conflict; {180c}\r\nSpears are mutually darting, spears all equally destructive;\r\nImpelled are sharp weapons of iron, {180d} gashing is the blade, {180e}\r\nAnd with a clang the sock {180f} descends upon the pate;\r\nA successful warrior was Fflamddwr {180g} against the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe supported martial steeds and harness of war;\r\nDrenched with gore, on the red-stained field of Cattraeth,\r\nThe foremost shaft in the host is held by the consumer of forts, {181a}\r\nThe brave {181b} dog of battle, upon the towering hill.\r\nWe are called to the gleaming {181c} post of assault,\r\nBy the beckoning hand {181d} of Heiddyn, {181e} the ironclad chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sovereign, who is celebrated in the Gododin, {181f}\r\nThe sovereign, for whom our eye-lids {182a} weep,\r\nFrom the raging flame of Eiddyn {182b} turned not aside; {182c}\r\nHe stationed men of firmness in command, {182d}\r\nAnd the thick covering guard {182e} he placed in the van,\r\nAnd vigorously he descended upon the scattered foe;\r\nIn that he had revelled, he likewise sustained the main weight;\r\nOf the retinue of Mynyddawg, none escaped,\r\nSave one man by slow steps, thoroughly weakened, and tottering every way.\r\n{182f}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving sustained a loss, {182g} Moried bore no shield,\r\nBut traversed the strand {183a} to set the ground on fire;\r\nFirmly he grasped in his hand a blue blade,\r\nAnd a shaft ponderous as the chief priest's {183b} crozier;\r\nHe rode a grey stately {183c} headed charger,\r\nAnd beneath his blade there was a dreadful fall of slaughter;\r\nWhen overpowered {183d} he fled not from the battle,--\r\nEven he who poured out to us the famous mead, that sweet ensnarer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI beheld the array from the highland of Adowyn, {183e}\r\nAnd the sacrifice brought down to the omen fire; {183f}\r\nI saw what was usual, a continual running towards the town, {184a}\r\nAnd the men of Nwython inflicting sharp wounds;\r\nI saw warriors in complete order approaching with a shout,\r\nAnd the head of Dyvnwal Vrych {184b} by ravens {184c} devoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessed Conqueror, of temper mild, the strength {184d} of his people,\r\nWith his blue streamers displayed towards the sea-roving foes. {185a}\r\nBrave is he on the waters, most numerous his host;\r\nManly his bosom, loud his shout in the charge of arms.\r\nUsual was it for him {185b} to make a descent before nine armaments,\r\n{185c}\r\nWith propulsive strokes, {185d} in the face of blood and of the country.\r\nI love thy victorious throne, which teemed with harmonious strains.\r\nO Cynddilig of Aeron, {185e} thou lion's whelp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could wish to have been the first to shed my blood in Cattraeth,\r\nAs the price {186a} of the mead and beverage of wine in the hall;\r\nI could wish to have been hurt by the blade of the sword,\r\nEre he was slain on the green plain of Uphin. {186b}\r\nI loved the son of renown, who sustained the bloody fight, {186c}\r\nAnd made his sword descend upon the violent.\r\nCan a tale of valour be related before Gododin,\r\nIn which the son of Ceidiaw {186d} has not his fame as a man of war?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSad it is for me, after all our toil,\r\nTo suffer the pang of death through indiscretion;\r\nAnd doubly grievous and sad for me to see\r\nOur men falling headlong to the ground, {187a}\r\nBreathing the lengthened sigh, and covered with reproaches.\r\nAfter the strenuous warriors have extended their country's bounds,\r\nRhuvawn {187b} and Gwgawn, {187c} Gwiawn and Gwlyged, {187d}\r\nMen at their post most gallant, valiant in difficulties,\r\nMay their souls, now that their conflict is ended, {187e}\r\nBe received into the heavenly region, the abode of tranquillity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTres repelled the foe through {188a} a pool of gore,\r\nAnd slaughtered like a hero such as asked no quarter, {188b}\r\nWith a sling and a spear; {188c}--he flung off his glass goblet\r\nContaining the mead, {188d} and in defence of his sovereignty overthrew\r\nan army;\r\nHis counsel always prevailed, and the multitude would not speak before\r\nhim, {188e}\r\nWhilst those that were cowards were not left alive,\r\nBefore the onset of his battle-axes, {188f} and his sharpened sword,\r\n{188g}\r\nAnd where his blue banner was seen to wave. {188h}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a reinforcement of {189a} troops,\r\nA supply of penetrating weapons,\r\nAnd a host of men in the vanguard,\r\nPresenting a menacing front;\r\nIn the days of strenuous exertion,\r\nIn the eager conflict,\r\nThey displayed their valour.\r\nAfter the intoxication,\r\nWhen they drank the mead,\r\nNot one was spared.\r\nThough Gorwylam\r\nWas awhile successful,\r\nWhen the retort was made, it broke the charge\r\nOf the horses and men, by fate decreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the host of Pryder {189b} arrives,\r\nI anxiously count {190a} the bands,\r\nEleven complete battalions;\r\nThere is now a precipitate flight {190b}\r\nAlong the road of lamentation.\r\nAffectionately have I deplored, {190c}\r\nDearly have I loved,\r\nThe illustrious dweller of the wood, {190d}\r\nAnd the men of Argoed, {190e}\r\nAccustomed, in the open plain, {191a}\r\nTo marshal their troops.\r\nFor the benefit of the chiefs, the lord of the war {191b}\r\nLaid upon rough {191c} boards,\r\nMidst a deluge of grief,\r\nThe viands for the banquet,\r\nWhere they caroused together;--he conducted us to a bright {191d} fire,\r\nAnd to a carpet of white and fresh {191e} hide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeraint, {191f} from the South, did raise a shout,\r\nAnd on the white water {192a} was his buckler pierced. {192b}\r\nLord of the spear, a gentle lord!\r\nThe praise of mountain and sea\r\nWill he render our youth, even thou, Geraint, wilt render them,\r\nWho hast been a generous commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstantaneously is his fame wafted on high;\r\nHis anchors {192c} from the scene of action {192d} cannot be restrained.\r\nUnflinching eagle {192e} of the forward heroes,\r\nHe bore the toil, and brilliant was his zeal;\r\nThe fleetest coursers he outstripped in war,\r\nBut was quite a lamb {193a} when the wine from the goblet flowed.\r\nEre he reached the grassy tomb, and his cheeks became pale in death,\r\n{193b}\r\nHe presided over the banquet of mead, and honoured it with the generous\r\nhorn. {193c}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuin {193d} he brought upon every fair region, {193e}\r\nAnd a fettering valour he displayed;

but now undisturbed\r\nIn regard to fame and gain, he reposes in the grave,\r\nNamely, Garthwys Hir, {196a} from the land of Rhuvoniawg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garment of Tinogad, {196b} which was of divers colours,\r\nMade of the speckled skins of young wolves,\r\nHis jerks and starts and juggling motion,\r\nI fain would lampoon, they were lampooned by his eight slaves. {196c}\r\nWhen thy father went out to hunt,\r\nWith his pole upon his shoulder, and his provisions in his hand,\r\nHe would call to his dogs that were of equal size,\r\nCatch it, catch it--seize it, seize it--bring it, bring it;\r\nHe would kill a fish in his coracle,\r\nEven as a princely lion in his fury {197a} kills his prey;\r\nWhen thy father climbed up the mountain,\r\nHe brought back the head {197b} of a roebuck, {197c} the head of a wild\r\nboar, the head of a stag,\r\nThe head of a grey moor hen from the hill,\r\nThe head of a fish from the falls of the Derwent; {197d}\r\nAs many as thy father could reach with his flesh piercer,\r\nOf wild boars, lions, and foxes, {197e}\r\nIt was certain death to them all, {197f} unless they proved too nimble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere he to narrow {198a} my dominions through extortion, {198b}\r\nThe arrival of no enemy would prove to me more formidable. {198c}\r\nThe man has not been nursed who could be more festive in the hall\r\nThan he, or steadier in the field of battle.\r\nOn the ford of Penclwyd {198d} Pennant were his steeds;\r\nFar spread was his fame, compact was his armour;\r\nAnd ere the long grass covered him beneath the sod,\r\nHe, the only son of Morarch, {198e} poured out the horns of mead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw the array from the highland of Adoen,\r\nCarrying the sacrifice to the omen fire; {199a}\r\nI saw the two, {199b} who from their station quickly and heavily fell;\r\nBy the commands of Nwython, greatly were they afflicted.\r\nI saw the warriors, who had made the great breach, approaching with the\r\ndawn, {199c}\r\nAnd the head of Dyvnwal Vrych by ravens devoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGododin, in respect of thee will I demand, {199d}\r\nIn the presence {199e} of a hundred that are named {199f} with deeds of\r\nvalour,\r\nAnd of Gwarthan the son of Dwywau, {200a} of gallant bravery,\r\nLet Tre Essyd be ours in one entire dale. {200b}\r\nSince the stabbing of the delight of the bulwark of battle,\r\nSince Aneurin was under ground, {200c}\r\nMy voice has not been divorced from Gododin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEcho speaks of the formidable {200d} and dragon-like {200e} weapons,\r\nAnd of the fair game, {200f} which was played in front of the unclaimed\r\ncourse of Gododin.\r\nProfusely did he bring a supply {200g} of wine into the tents, for the\r\nbenefit of the natives, {200h}\r\nIn the season of the storm, as long as it trickled from the vessels,\r\nAnd the army, a well nourished host, continued to drop in.\r\nA splendid troop of warriors, successful against a hundred men,\r\nIs led from Dindovydd in Dyvneint. {201a}\r\nBefore Doleu {201b} in battle, worn out were the shields, and battered\r\nthe helmets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe brought ruin upon every fair region, {201c}\r\nAnd a fettering valour he displayed;\r\nThe front of his shield was pierced;\r\nCaso Hir, arrayed in pomp, {201d}\r\nProtected Rhuvoniawg.\r\nA second time were they wounded, {201e} and crushed\r\nBy his warlike steeds, and gore-stained were their coffins. {201f}\r\nAlways immoveable, always liberal of aid,\r\nWould be his gallant nobles, when roused to anger.\r\nSevere in the conflict, with blades he slaughtered;\r\nAnd agonising news from the war he brought,\r\nWhich he wove into a hundred songs for the calends of January.\r\nAdan {202a} the son of Urvei there did pierce,\r\nAdan pierced the haughty boar,\r\nEven he who was like Urien, {202b} a maid, and a hero.\r\nAnd as the youth was thus endowed with the properties of a king,\r\nLord of Gwynedd, and of the blood of Cilydd, {202c} he proved our\r\ndeliverer;\r\nEre the turf was laid upon the face of the generous dead,\r\nWisely did he seek the field, with praise and high sounding fame:\r\nThe grave of Gorthyn Hir {202d} is seen {202e} from the highlands of\r\nRhuvoniawg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn account of the piercing of the skilful and most learned man, {203a}\r\nOn account of the fair corpse, which fell prostrate upon the ground,\r\nThrice six officers judged the atrocious deed {203b} at the hour of\r\nmattins,\r\nAnd Morien lifted up again his ancient lance,\r\nAnd, roaring, stretched out {203c} death\r\nTowards the warriors, the Gwyddyl, {203d} and the Prydyn; {203e}\r\nWhilst towards the lovely, slender, blood-stained body of Gwen,\r\nSighed Gwenabwy, the only son of Gwen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn account of the afflicting {203f} of the skilful and most learned man\r\nGrievously and deeply, when he fell prostrate upon the ground,\r\nThe banner was pompously {204a} unfurled, and borne by a man in the\r\nflank; {204b}\r\nA tumultuous scene was beheld {204c} in Eiddin, and on the battle field.\r\nThe grasp of his hand performed deeds of valour\r\nUpon the Cynt, {204d} the Gwyddyl, and the Prydyn.\r\nHe who meddles with the mane of a wolf, without a club\r\nIn his hand, will have it gorgeously emblazoned on his robe.\r\nFain would I sing,--\"would that Morien had not died.\"\r\nI sigh for Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen. {204e}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{0a}  Perhaps Cawlwyd is a compound of Caw Clwyd, that is, the Clyde of\r\nCaw.\r\n\r\n{0b}  Institutional Triads.\r\n\r\n{0c}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{0d}  Myvyrian Archaiology, vol. i. page 60.\r\n\r\n{0e}  Bardic Triads.\r\n\r\n{0f}  Bardic Triads.\r\n\r\n{0g}  Triad 48, third series.\r\n\r\n{0h}  Myv.

Taliesin in his Elegy on Owain son of Urien, describes him as\r\n\r\n    \"Gwr gwiw uch ei amliw seirch\r\n    A roddei feirch\r\n    I eirchiaid.\"\r\n\r\n    A worthy hero seated on variegated trappings,\r\n    Who would give steeds to those that asked him.--Myv. Arch. vol. i. p.\r\n    59.\r\n\r\n_Thick mane_ was regarded as one of the good points of a horse; thus\r\nTaliesin,--\r\n\r\n       \"Atuyn march myngvras mangre.\"\r\n\r\n    Beautiful in a tangle is a thick-maned horse.--Ib. p, 28.\r\n\r\n{79c}  Lit. \"Were under the thigh of;\" an expression frequently employed\r\nby the early bards to denote the act of riding.  See \"Elegy upon Geraint\r\nab Erbin,\" by Llywarch Hen.\r\n\r\n{80a}  One of the sons of Llywarch Hen is similarly represented as a\r\nyouth,--\r\n\r\n    \"That wore the golden spurs,\"--Owen's Ll. Hen, p. 131.\r\n\r\nIn the days of chivalry, of which the era of the Gododin may fairly be\r\nconsidered as the commencement, the privilege of decorating arms, and the\r\naccoutrements of horses with gold, was exclusively confined to knights,\r\nand their families; squires being only permitted the use of silver for\r\nthe purpose.  (St. Palaye, 1. 247, 284.)\r\n\r\n{80b}  \"Pan,\" pannus--down, fur, ermine, or fulled cloth.\r\n\r\n{80c}  This is not literally true of Owain ab Urien, for he was married\r\nto a daughter of Culvynawyd Prydain.\r\n\r\n{80d}  \"Argyvrein,\" might perhaps come from _argyvrau_, paraphernalia; a\r\nportion or dowry.\r\n\"Ymogel ddwyn gwraig atat yn enw ei _hargyvrau_.\"\r\n\r\n    Beware of taking to thyself a wife for the sake of her portion.\r\n    (Cato Gymraeg.)\r\n\r\nIn that case, the passage should be rendered,--\r\n\r\n    Ere thou didst obtain thy nuptial dowry;\r\n\r\nwhich reading would be supported by the allusion to the nuptial feast in\r\nthe preceding passage.  Nevertheless the term \"argynrein,\" occurring in\r\nthree other copies, would certainly point to the signification given in\r\nthe text; \"argyvrein\" being capable of the same meaning, whilst\r\n\"argynrein\" has no reference whatever to the nuptial dowry.\r\n\r\n{81a}  The manner in which the person here commemorated is associated\r\nwith the ravens, leads us to suspect that he was none other than Owain ab\r\nUrien, who is traditionally reported to have had an army of ravens in his\r\nservice, by which, however, we are probably to understand an army of men\r\nwith those birds emblazoned on their standard, even as his descendants\r\nstill bear them in their coats of arms.  Not only do the Welsh Romances\r\nand Bards of the middle ages allude to these ravens, but even Taliesin\r\nand Llywarch Hen, seem pointedly to connect them with Urien or his son.\r\nThus the former in an Ode on the battle of Argoed Llwyvaen, (Myv. Arch.\r\nvol. i. p. 53) in which Owain commanded the Cumbrian forces, under his\r\nfather against Ida, says,--\r\n\r\n    \"A rhag gwaith Argoed Llwyfain\r\n    Bu llawer celain\r\n    Rhuddei frain rhag rhyfel gwyr.\"\r\n\r\n    Because of the battle of Argoed Llwyvain,\r\n    There happened many a dead carcase,\r\n    And the ravens were coloured with the war of men.\r\n\r\nAnd Llywarch Hen in his \"Elegy on Urien Rheged\" has the following\r\nexpressions;--\r\n\r\n    \"Pen a borthav ar vy nhu; Pen Urien,\r\n    Llary, llyw ei lu;\r\n    Ac ar ei vron wen vran ddu.\r\n\r\n    Pen a borthav mywn vy nghrys; pen Urien,\r\n    Llary llywiai lys:\r\n    Ac ar ei vron wen vran ai hys.\"\r\n\r\n    I bear by my side a head; the head of Urien,\r\n    The mild leader of his army;\r\n    And on his white bosom the sable raven is perched.\r\n\r\n    I bear in my shirt a head; the head of Urien,\r\n    That governed a court with mildness;\r\n    And on his white bosom the sable raven doth glut.  (Owen's Ll. Hen.\r\n    p. 24.)\r\n\r\nThis supposition would considerably enhance the point and beauty of the\r\npassage in the text; for a sad or unbecoming thing, indeed, (\"cwl,\" _a\r\nfault_) would it be that one who fought by the aid of ravens should\r\nhimself be eventually devoured by them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a tradition prevails, that Owain the son of Urien was actually\r\nengaged in the battle of Cattraeth.  Thus Lewis Glyn Cothi, a poet of the\r\nfifteenth century, observes;--\r\n\r\n    \"Bwriodd Owain ab Urien\r\n    Y tri thwr yn Nghattraeth hen.\r\n    Ovnodd Arthur val goddaith\r\n    Owain, ei vrain a'i fon vraith.\"  (I. 140.)\r\n\r\n    Owain son of Urien overthrew\r\n    The three towers of Cattraeth of old;\r\n    Arthur dreaded, as the flames,\r\n    Owain, his ravens, and his parti-coloured staff.\r\n\r\nBut to the view which would identify our hero with the son of Urien there\r\nis this objection, that the poem describes the former as the son of Marro\r\nor Marco; nor can the difficulty be got over, without supposing that this\r\nwas another name of Urien.  Or if that be inadmissible, the line, in\r\nwhich Owain's name occurs, may be translated,--\r\n\r\n    Alas, the beloved friend of Owain;\r\n\r\nan alteration, which will do no great violence to the allusion about the\r\nravens.\r\n\r\n{82a}  Al. \"March,\" as if addressing the horse of the slain;--\r\n\r\n    O steed, in what spot\r\n    Was slaughtered, &c.\r\n\r\n{82b}  \"Cynhaiawc,\" (cyn-taiawg.)  Adopting this version for the sake of\r\nvariety, and under the impression that all the different readings of this\r\npoem are not the mere result of orthographical accident, but that the\r\nforms of obscure or illegible words were sometimes determined by\r\ntradition, we must believe that the _taiogion_, who composed the army of\r\nMadog, were simply his own tenants or dependants.\r\n\r\n{83a}  \"Diffun,\" (di-ffun.)  _Ffun_ is any thing united together, and is\r\nused at line 803 for a band of men.  Some read \"diffyn,\" (protection or\r\ndefence) and in that case the sense of the passage would seem to be,\r\n\r\nHe brought protection to women, and mead he distributed.\r\n\r\nThe former reading is preferred, inasmuch as it exhibits in a more\r\nnatural and consistent manner the twofold character of Madog, as a\r\nsoldier and a courtier, which appears to be the object of the Bard to\r\ndelineate.  Our inference on this point is moreover supported by more\r\nobvious passages of that description, which occur again in the Poem, such\r\nas,--\r\n\r\n    \"Ragorei veirch racvuan\r\n    En trin lletvegin gwin o bann.\"\r\n\r\n    He surpassed the fleetest steeds\r\n    In war, but was a tame animal when he poured the wine from the\r\n    goblet.\r\n\r\nThe epithet \"cynhaiawc,\" assuming it to be the proper term, would also,\r\nby reason of its contrasting effect, considerably enhance the value of\r\nour hero's domestic and social courtesy.\r\n\r\n{83b}  \"Twll tal y rodawr.\"  Dr. Owen Pughe translates this \"the front\r\nopening of his chariot;\" \"twll ar ysgwyd,\" however, in the lxxxvii\r\nstanza, evidently refers to a shield, and this sense is, moreover,\r\nsupported by \"tyllant tal ysgwydawr,\" in Taliesin's Ode on Gwallawg, as\r\nwell as \"rac twll y gylchwy,\" used by Cynddelw.  The meaning therefore\r\nappears to be that wherever the battle raged, there would the chief be\r\nfound, so boldly and _directly_ fighting as to have the very boss of his\r\nshield perforated by the spears of his enemy.\r\n\r\n{83c}  \"Brwyn.\"  From the practice which the Welsh Bards commonly had of\r\nadapting their descriptive similes to the names, armorial bearings, or\r\nsome other peculiarities of their heroes, we may infer that the\r\nchieftain, who is celebrated in this stanza, is none other than Madog ab\r\nBrwyn.  Indeed one copy reads \"mab brwyn,\" the son of Brwyn, rather than\r\n_mal_ brwyn, as above.  He is distinguished in the Triads with Ceugant\r\nBeilliog and Rhuvon, under the appellation of the \"three golden corpses,\"\r\nbecause their weight in gold was given by their families to have their\r\nbodies delivered up by the enemy.  (Myv. Arch. vol. ii. p. 69.)  Madog ab\r\nBrwyn was the grandson of Cunedda Wledig, lord of Gododin.\r\n\r\n{84a}  A maritime region in the north, as we infer, not only from the\r\nworks of Aneurin, but also from those of Taliesin and Merddin.\r\n\r\n{84b}  The rest having been slain.\r\n\r\n{84c}  \"Erwyt\" (erwyd) a pole, or a staff to mete with, and, like the\r\n_gwialen_, an emblem of authority.  \"I will--mete out the valley of\r\nSuccoth.\"  (Psalm lx. 6.)  A similar expression occurs in Llywarch Hen's\r\nPoems with reference to Urien Rheged, viz.\r\n\r\n       \"Oedd cledyr cywlad rhwydd.\"\r\n\r\nwhich W. Owen has translated,--\r\n\r\n    \"That was the prompt defender of his neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\n{84d}  Llywarch Hen says in like manner of his own son Gwen,--\r\n\r\n       \"Rhythr eryr yn ebyr oeddyd.\"\r\n\r\n    In the assault like the eagle at the fall of rivers thou wert.\r\n\r\nThe eagle was probably the armorial badge of the hero of this stanza.\r\n\r\n{84e}  Al. \"y lyr,\" to our shore.  We have here an instance of the\r\nkindred signification of some of the different readings found in the\r\nPoem.  Both words are used in juxtaposition in the following extracts;--\r\n\r\n    \"Gwelais ar vorwyn--\r\n    Lliw golau tonau taenverw gwenyg\r\n    Llanw _ebyr_ ar _llyr_, lle ni mawr-drig.\"  (Cynddelw.)\r\n\r\n    I beheld on a maiden\r\n    The bright hue of the spreading ebullition of the breakers of the\r\n    waves,\r\n    Of the flood of the effluxes of rivers, on the strand, where it\r\n    tarries not long.\r\n\r\n    \"Oedd ei var--\r\n    Megys twrv _ebyr_ yn _llyr_ llawn.\"  (Cynddelw.)\r\n\r\n    His rage\r\n    Was like the tumult of the mouths of rivers with a full margin.\r\n\r\n    \"Calan hyddvrev, tymp dydd yn edwi,\r\n    Cynhwrv yn _ebyr_, _llyr_ yn llenwi.\"  (Ll P. Moch.)\r\n\r\n    The beginning of October, the period of the falling off of day,\r\n    There is tumult in the mouths of rivers, filling up the shore.\r\n\r\n{85a}  \"I ammod.\"  This was probably a confederation entered into by the\r\ndifferent princes, for the purpose of uniting their forces against the\r\ncommon enemy; a supposition corroborated by the word \"cywlad,\" just used.\r\nThe poet might, however, have intended a play upon the word \"ammod,\"\r\nbecause of its great resemblance in sound to \"ammwyd,\" a _bait_, to which\r\nthe eagle was allured, \"llithywyt\" (llithiwyd) a strictly sporting term.\r\n\r\n{85b}  \"A garwyd,\" al. \"a gatwyt\" \"was preserved, or protected.\"\r\n\r\n{85c}  The connection between \"arvaeth,\" and the bannerial device is very\r\nobvious at lines 110, 111.\r\n\r\n    \"Mor ehelaeth\r\n    E aruaeth uch arwyt.\"\r\n\r\n    With such a magnificent\r\n    Design of enterprize blazoned on his standard.\r\n\r\n{85d}  \"O dechwyt,\" i.e. _tech wyd_.\r\n\r\n{85e}  We have adopted \"Manawyd\" as a proper name, under the impression\r\nthat the different stanzas of the Gododin, albeit regular links of the\r\nsame general subject, are nevertheless in a manner each complete in\r\nitself, and therefore that it would be more natural, where the drift of\r\nthe paragraph allowed, or seemed to have that tendency, to look out for\r\nthe names of the chiefs, who may be thus distinctly introduced; according\r\nto the tenor of the following declaration which is appended to \"Gorchan\r\nCynvelyn.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. page 61.)\r\n\r\n    \"Canu un Canuauc a dal pob Awdyl o'r Gododin heruyd breint yngcerd\r\n    amrysson.  Tri chanu a thriugeint a thrychant a dal pob un or\r\n    Gorchaneu . . . Achaws yu am goffau yn y Gorchaneu rivedi Guyr a\r\n    aethant y Gatraeth nog y dyle gur vyned i ymlad heb arveu; Ny dyle\r\n    Bard myned i amrysson heb y gerd honno.\"\r\n\r\n    Every Ode of the Gododin is equivalent to a single song, according to\r\n    the privilege of poetical competition.  Each of the incantations is\r\n    equal to three hundred and sixty-three songs, because the number of\r\n    the men who went to Cattraeth is commemorated in the Incantations,\r\n    and as no man should go to battle without arms, so no Bard ought to\r\n    contend without that Poem.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the Vellum MS. as transcribed by Davies, this does not\r\nform a distinct stanza, but is a continuation of the preceding one.\r\nNevertheless in other copies a detached position is given to it, which\r\nseems required also by the opening sentence, and particularly by the\r\nrhyme.\r\n\r\nWe find, moreover, that Manawyd was anciently used as a proper name, for\r\nnot to mention Manawydan and Culvynawyd, we have Manawyd in one of\r\nTaliesin's Poems as undoubtedly the name of a person.\r\n\r\n    \"Ys gwyr Manawyd a Phryderi.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 67.)\r\n\r\nThe name of Pryderi occurs further on in our Poem.\r\n\r\nManawyd is mentioned likewise in the Dialogue between Arthur, Cai, and\r\nGlewlwyd,--\r\n\r\n    \"Neus duc Manavid eis tull o Trywrid\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 167.)\r\n\r\nDr. O. Pughe translates the line in the Gododin thus--\r\n\r\n    \"There was a confident impelling forward of the shaft of the\r\n    variegated standard.\"\r\n\r\n{86a}  \"Ny nodi,\" (ni nodi) _thou dost not mark_, thou art blind to the\r\narms of the enemy both defensive and offensive.  \"Nodi,\" may also have\r\nreference to \"nod\" in the third line of the stanza.\r\n\r\n{86b}  Al. \"Protected against the assault of the battle of Manau;\" i.e.\r\nMannau Gododin, or according to others, Mannau in which A.D. 582 Aidan\r\nmac Gavran was victorious.  (See Ritson's Annals of Caledonia, Vol. ii.\r\np. 35.)\r\n\r\n{87a}  One reason for not regarding \"Caeawc\" as a proper name, may be\r\ndiscovered in the manner in which the expression \"cawawc cynhorawc\" is\r\nused in an anonymous poem of an early date, apud Myv. Arch. vol. i. page\r\n180.  The author, though he evidently borrowed it from the Gododin, as\r\nindeed his allusion to Cattraeth a few lines before would likewise imply,\r\nemploys it merely as an epithet.\r\n\r\n{87b}  An allusion probably to his armorial bearings.  Another reading\r\ngives \"bled e maran,\" on the open strand.\r\n\r\n{87c}  \"This singular fact of the ancient Britons wearing amber beads, is\r\nconfirmed by many beads of amber having been found in the barrows on\r\nSalisbury plain, which have been recently dug.  I understand that in\r\nseveral of these graves, pieces of amber like beads have been met with;\r\nand in one as many beads were found as would have made a wreath.\"  (S.\r\nTurner's Vind. 208, 209.)\r\n\r\n{87d}  \"Am ran.\"  \"Tri argau gwaed: gwaed hyd _ran_, a gwaed hyd gwll, a\r\ngwaed hyd lawr; sev yw hynny, gwaed hyd _wyneb_, gwaed hyd ddillad, a\r\ngwaed a reto hyd lawr.\"  (Law Triads, Myv. Arch, vol. iii. p. 342.)\r\nHence \"amrant,\" the eyelid.\r\n\r\n{87e}  Lit. \"the place of wine,\" otherwise \"a horn of wine,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Ef a'm rhoddes medd a gwin o wydrin _ban_.\r\n\r\n    He gave me mead and wine from the transparent horn.  (Taliesin.)\r\n\r\nAl. \"gwrnvann,\" the place of the urn.  In that case the line might be\r\nthus translated,--\r\n\r\n    Precious was the amber, but its price was the grave.\r\n\r\n{88a}  The hero of this stanza we take to be the \"son of Ysgyran\"\r\nhimself.  He disdained the eager advance of the enemy; for such was his\r\nwill, that he had only to declare it, to make Venedotia and the North\r\nacknowledge his power, and submit to his jurisdiction; or, it may be, to\r\nmarch unanimously to his side.  Supposing \"gwyar,\" however, to be the\r\ncorrect reading, we might render the line thus,--\r\n\r\n    He repelled violence, and gore trickled to the ground.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the identity of the person commemorated with the son of Ysgyran\r\nwould become more evident by the addition of a comma after \"gyssul,\"\r\nthus,--\r\n\r\n    \"Ket dyffei wyned a gogled e rann\r\n    O gussyl,--mah Ysgyrran.\"\r\n\r\nWho Ysgyran, or Cyran (the _ys_ being a mere prefix) was, we have no\r\nmeans of knowing, as the name does not occur any where in history.\r\n\r\n{88b}  Al. \"The maimed shield-bearer,\" (ysgwydwr.)\r\n\r\n{88c}  \"Cyn-nod,\" the principal mark or butt; the most conspicuous, owing\r\nto his being in advance of his men, and perhaps on account of his stature\r\nalso, if \"eg gawr,\" or \"yggawr\" mean _giantlike_.\r\n\r\n{88d}  \"Cyn-ran;\" the foremost share, or participation of an action.\r\n\r\n{89a}  \"Pymwnt,\" (i.e. pum mwnt; \"deg myrdd yn y mwnt,\") five hundred\r\nthousand, which, multiplied by five, would give us 2,500,000 as the\r\nnumber of men who composed the above battalions.\r\n\r\n{89b}  Deivyr and Bryneich, (_Deira and Bernicia_) are situated on the\r\neastern coast of the island, the river Humber, as we learn from the\r\nTriads, (Myv. Arch. vol. ii. p. 68) flowing through a portion thereof.\r\nIn a document which has been published in the Iolo MSS. Argoed\r\nDerwennydd, (Derwent wood probably) and the river Trenn or Trent, are\r\nmentioned as the extreme boundaries of the region.  The triads moreover\r\nspeak of the three sons of Dysgyvedawg, (or Dysgyvyndawd) viz. Gall,\r\nDifedel, and Ysgavnell, under the appellation of the \"three monarchs of\r\nDeivyr and Bryneich,\" (Ibid. p. 64) about the period, as it would appear,\r\nof our Poem.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the above passage in the Gododin, as well as from those\r\nlines, (78, 79.)\r\n\r\n    \"Ar deulu brenneych beych barnasswn\r\n    Dilyw dyn en vyw nys adawsswn.\"\r\n\r\n    If I had judged you to be of the tribe of Bryneich,\r\n    Not the phantom of a man would I have left alive;\r\n\r\nthat the people of those countries were not at the time in question on\r\nfriendly terms with the neighbouring Britons; which circumstance is\r\nfurther apparent from the contemporary testimony of Llywarch Hen, who\r\nspeaks of Urien as having conquered the land of Bryneich;\r\n\r\n    \"Neus gorug o dir Brynaich.\"\r\n\r\nThis, it is true, might have a reference to the Saxon tribes, who had\r\nsucceeded at an early period, in establishing themselves along the coast\r\nin that part of the island, yet the disparaging manner in which the grave\r\nof Disgyrnin Disgyfedawt, evidently the father of the \"three monarchs,\"\r\nis spoken of in the Englynion y Beddau, inclines us strongly to the\r\nbelief that it was the Aborigines themselves who were thus guilty of\r\ntreason to the common weal.\r\n\r\n    \"Cigleu don drom dra thywawd,\r\n    Am vedd Dysgyrnyn Dysgyveddawd,\r\n    Aches trwm angwres pechawd.\"\r\n\r\n    Hear the sullen wave beyond the strand,\r\n    Round the grave of Dysgyrnyn Dysgyveddawd,\r\n    Heavy the burning impulse raised by sin.\r\n\r\n                                               (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 78.)\r\n\r\n{90a}  An allusion to the name of our hero's father, (Bleiddan) and\r\nprobably to his own standard.\r\n\r\n{90b}  \"Neithyawr.\"  Al. \"than go to the altar.\"\r\n\r\n{90c}  Al. \"elawr\" a _bier_, \"than obtained a bier.\"  He was devoured by\r\nthe birds of prey ere he could be removed for interment.\r\n\r\n{90d}  Or, \"Ere he received his nuptial dowry, his blood streamed down.\"\r\n\r\n{90e}  Hyveidd Hir was the son of Bleiddan Sant, of Glamorgan, (the\r\ncelebrated Lupus.)  According to the Triads he was one of the three alien\r\nkings, upon whom dominion was conferred for their mighty deeds, and for\r\ntheir praiseworthy and gracious qualities.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri eilldeyrn ynys Prydain: Gwrgai vab Gwrien yn y Gogledd, a\r\n    Chadavael vab Cynvedw yng Ngwynedd, a Hyveidd Hir vab Bleiddan Sant\r\n    ym Morganwg: sev y rhodded Teyrnedd iddynt am eu campau a'u\r\n    cynneddvau clodvorion a rhadvorion.\"  (Triad, 26, third series.)\r\n\r\nTaliesin, in his Ode to Urien, speaks of Hyveidd in conjunction with\r\nGododin;--\r\n\r\n    \"Hyveidd a Gododin a lleu towys.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 57.)\r\n\r\nHis name also occurs in another poem, by the same Bard, \"to Gwallawg ap\r\nLleenawg;\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Haearnddur a Hyfeidd a Gwallawg\r\n    Ac Owein Mon Maelgynig ddefawd\r\n    A wnaw peithwyr gorweiddiawg.\"\r\n\r\n    Haearnddur and Hyveidd and Gwallawg,\r\n    And Owain of Mon, of Maelgynian manner,\r\n    Would prostrate the ravagers.  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 64.)\r\n\r\nThe epithet \"Hir,\" (_long_ or _tall_) applied to Hyveidd, countenances\r\nthe view of his being conspicuous on account of his size.\r\n\r\n{91a}  Gognaw must have been the son of Botgad.  The name, as well as\r\nthat of the preceding hero, occurs in an Ode which Taliesin addressed to\r\nGwallawg ab Lleenawg.\r\n\r\n    \"Gognaw ei brawd digones.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be not a proper name in this stanza, it may be rendered\r\neither \"with laughter and sprightliness,\" or \"they were a laughing\r\nenergy.\"\r\n\r\n{91b}  Al. \"As with blades they dealt mutual blows.\"\r\n\r\n{91c}  \"A llaw,\" _a hand_; metaphorically _power_.  Al. \"a allaw,\" _who\r\nis able_.\r\n\r\n{92a}  The same consideration which induced us to regard \"Manawyd\" as a\r\nproper name in a former stanza, has caused us to leave \"Gwanar\"\r\nuntranslated in this place.  It is not improbable, however, from the\r\nshortness of this sonnet, that the line containing the name of its hero\r\nmay have been lost.  In that case we should translate \"chwerthin wanar,\"\r\n\"their leader laughed.\"  That Gwanar was occasionally used as a proper\r\nname by the ancient Britons, appears from Triad xl. (first series) where\r\nwe find one of the sons of Lliaws ab Nwyvre so called.  He flourished\r\nhowever before the date of the Gododin, and cannot on that account be\r\nidentified with the Gwanar of the text.  Taliesin uses the word in his\r\n\"Mic Dinbych,\" apparently as a proper name;--\r\n\r\n    \"Clod wasgar a Gwanar ydd ymddullyn.\"\r\n\r\n{92b}  Or \"gem of a regiment;\" his choice regiment.\r\n\r\n{92c}  Al. \"digynny,\" _went up_.\r\n\r\n{92d}  The Bard in the two last lines seems to be addressing Death, or\r\nFate, which he designates as \"the strong pillar of the living law,\" or\r\nthe law of nature, just as the Latins called it \"dura necessitas,\"\r\n\"mortis dura lex,\" \"fatalis Parcarum lex,\" &c.  The expressions \"heb vawr\r\ndrydar,\" and \"arwar,\" indicative of the effects of death, are introduced\r\nby way of contrast to the noisy mirth which characterised the warriors'\r\nmarch to the field of battle.  \"Arwar\" signifies literally a _quiescent\r\nstate_, or _state of general rest_; _pacification_; and as such is a very\r\nproper term to denote the character of death.\r\n\r\n    \"O _arwar_ daiar down i gyd dyddbrawd.\"  (Ll. P. Moch.)\r\n\r\n    From the silent state of earth we shall all come at the judgment day.\r\n\r\n{93a}  As the word \"glas,\" though primarily signifying _blue_, has also a\r\nvery general sense, and may mean merely _pale_ or _fresh_, yet as we find\r\ndecided colours attributed to mead elsewhere in the poem, such as\r\n\"melyn,\" (yellow) and \"gwyn\" (white) we have thought proper to retain the\r\nliteral acceptation in this place, as a poetical variety, however\r\ninapplicable to the beverage in question it may seem.\r\n\r\n{93b}  \"Impia sub dulci melle venena latent.\"\r\n\r\n{93c}  The name of the chieftain, who commanded this particular troop, is\r\nnot mentioned, unless (which is not very probable) we take \"Trychant\" in\r\nthe third line as a proper name, and translate thus,--\r\n\r\n    \"Trychant marshals his men, armed with the weapons of war.\"\r\n\r\nOr, are we to understand by \"trwy beiryant,\" that he marshalled his men\r\nby means of some instrument or machinery?\r\n\r\n{93d}  I.e. the silence of death.\r\n\r\n{94a}  \"Fyryf frwythlawn,\" i.e. \"_fyrv_ frwythlawn;\" the sense of \"_furv_\r\nfrwythlawn\" would seem to be \"in vigorous order.\"\r\n\r\n{94b}  The followers of the son of Cian (_a little dog_) are evidently\r\ncalled \"aergwn,\" (_dogs of war_) in allusion to his patronymic, as well\r\nas to the name of his residence, \"maen gwyngwn,\" (_the stone of the white\r\ndogs_.)  Probably also the figure of a dog was charged on their banner.\r\n\r\n{94c}  The Bernicians, as we have already noticed, were at this time\r\nopposed to the British patriots.  The Cymry carried a traditional hatred\r\nof that people with them into Wales, and applied the term _Bryneich_ to\r\nsuch of their kindred as allied themselves to the enemies of their\r\ncountry, as is abundantly manifest in the works of the mediaeval\r\nBards.--See STEPHEN'S Literature of the Kymry, p. 265.)\r\n\r\n{94d}  Or, \"Like a deluge, I would not have left a man alive.\"\r\n\r\n{94e}  It is very probable that the son of Cian had married a daughter of\r\none of the chiefs of Bryneich, which would thus account for the Bard's\r\nlurking apprehension at first, that he might be induced to barter his\r\nallegiance for the dowry to be expected with his wife.  His fears however\r\nwere groundless; for such were the purity and patriotism of our youthful\r\nhero, that he even refused the dowry when it was offered to him, and\r\nbraved his father-in-law's anger withal.\r\n\r\n{95a}  In Gorchan Maelderw we read of--\r\n\r\n    \"The only son of Cian from Trabannawg.\"\r\n\r\nCian was a Bard, and is mentioned as such by Nennius in the following\r\npassage,--\r\n\r\n    \"Item Talhaern Talanguen in Poemate claruit, et Nuevin et Taliessin,\r\n    et Bluchbar, et Cian qui vocatur Gueinchguant (_Cian who is called\r\n    Gwyngwn_) simul uno tempore in poemate Britannico claruerunt.\"\r\n\r\nTaliesin likewise represents him in that character in a Poem entitled,\r\n\"Angar Cyvyndawd.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 34.)\r\n\r\n    \"Cian pan ddarvu\r\n    Lliaws gyvolu.\"\r\n\r\n    When Cian sang the praise of many.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of his being thus a poet, and classed with Aneurin\r\n(Nuevin) would account for the intimacy which subsisted between the\r\nlatter and his son.\r\n\r\nCian is said to have been the servant of Peris, and to them conjointly is\r\nLlangian in Caernarvonshire dedicated.  Cian is commemorated on the 11th\r\nof December.--See Rees's Welsh Saints, p. 302.\r\n\r\n{95b}  It is probable that _three hundred_ was the number which composed\r\nthe retinue of Mynyddawg, and that a _hundred thousand_, a large round\r\nfigure, is chosen to denote the preponderance of the enemy's forces that\r\nwere arrayed in opposition.  This view seems more in unison with reason,\r\nas well as with the grammatical construction of the passage, (\"emdaflawr\"\r\nbeing a middle verb) than the supposition that the \"milcant a thrychant\"\r\nformed the total of the army of the Cymry.\r\n\r\n{96a}  Or, \"They served as butts for the falling lances.\"\r\n\r\n{96b}  \"Gorsaf;\" \"Gorsav arv,\" _a magazine of arms_.  \"Brwydr orsavawl,\"\r\na pitched battle.\r\n\r\n{96c}  \"Mynyddawg Mwynvawr.\"  The Triads call him \"Mynyddawg Eiddin,\"\r\n_Edin_, hence _Edinburgh_, which probably corresponds with his original\r\nplace of residence, or at any rate may be considered as being situate\r\nwithin the limits of his ancient dominions.  \"The retinue of Mynyddawg\r\nEiddin at Cattraeth\" is represented as one of \"the three honourable\r\nretinues of the Isle of Britain,\" because the men who composed it had\r\njoined their chieftain's standard of their own accord, and marched at\r\ntheir own expense, claiming neither pay nor reward for their service,\r\nfrom king or country.\r\n\r\n    \"Tair gosgordd addwyn Ynys Prydain; Gosgordd Belyn vab Cynvelyn yng\r\n    nghadvel Caradawg ab Bran; a gosgordd Mynyddawg Eiddin yng\r\n    Nghattraeth; a Gosgordd Drywon ab Nudd Hael yn Rhodwydd Arderydd yn y\r\n    Gogledd; sev ydd elai bawb yn y rhai hynny ar eu traul eu hunain heb\r\n    aros govyn, ac heb erchi na thal nag anrheg y gan wlad na chan Deyrn;\r\n    ac achaws hynny au gelwid hwy y tair gosgordd addwyn.\"  (Triad 79,\r\n    third series.)\r\n\r\n{96d}  \"Hanyanawr,\" their natural relatives; \"hangenawr,\" those who stood\r\nin need of them, their families and friends.  The line may likewise be\r\nrendered,--\r\n\r\n    \"Esteemed for their age and disposition.\"\r\n\r\n{96e}  Al. \"llawen,\" _merry_; \"the merry minstrel.\"\r\n\r\n{97a}  These plumes must accordingly have been themselves red.  That\r\nmilitary men at this period did wear feathers of particular colours as\r\ndistinctive badges, is further evident from the testimony of Llywarch\r\nHen, who describes himself as having worn \"yellow plumes.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Gwedy meirch hywedd, a chochwedd ddillad,\r\n    A phluawr melyn,\r\n    Main vy nghoes, nid oes ym dremyn!\"  (Elegy on Cynddylan.)\r\n\r\n    After the sleek tractable steeds, and garments of ruddy hue,\r\n    And the waving yellow plumes,\r\n    Slender is my leg, my piercing look is gone.\"\r\n\r\nIn some copies we read \"phurawr\" (purawr) _what purifies_.\r\n\r\n{97b}  Their weapons were red and white from the effects of _blood_ and\r\n_gore_.\r\n\r\n{97c}  Mr. Davies and Dr. Pughe seem to have preferred the expression\r\n\"_pedryolet_ bennawr,\" which they construed into _four pointed helmets_:\r\n\"pedryollt,\" _split into four parts_, would appear, however, to be much\r\nmore accordant with the descriptive tenor of the passage.\r\n\r\n{97d}  As in the two preceding lines is contained a compliment to\r\nmilitary valour, the evident drift of the poem requires that it should be\r\napplied to the British party; hence \"rac\" in this place must be\r\nunderstood to mean that the toiling warriors were _from_ or _of_ the\r\nretinue of Mynyddawg rather than from those who confronted him.\r\n\r\n{97e}  Disgraced by the blasphemous taunts and treachery of the enemy.\r\n\r\n{98a}  \"Ceugant yw angeu,\" (adage.)  The line might be rendered,--\r\n\r\n    \"Without end they multiplied the wooden biers;\"\r\n\r\nAn expression similar to that made use of by Llywarch Hen, in reference\r\nto the battle of Llongborth:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ac elorawr mwy no maint.\r\n    And biers innumerable.  (Elegy upon Geraint ab Erbin.)\r\n\r\n\"Ceugant,\" translated _without end_, is properly a Druidic term,\r\nsignifying the circle of eternity.\r\n\r\n    \"Cylch y ceugant, ac nis gall namyn Duw eu dreiglaw.\"\r\n\r\n    The circle of infinitude, none but God can pervade it.  (Barddas.)\r\n\r\n    \"Tri phren rhydd yn forest y brenhin; pren crib eglwys; a phren\r\n    peleidyr a elont yn rhaid y brenhin; a _phren elawr_.\"  (Welsh Laws.)\r\n\r\n{98b}  He is described as of \"Baptism\" in contradistinction to the\r\ninfidel Saxons.\r\n\r\n{98c}  A reference to the last unction.  See St. James, v. 14.\r\n\r\n{98d}  I.e. Tudvwlch Hir, the hero of this particular stanza.\r\n\r\n{99a}  \"Ne.\"  The statement at line 138 would determine the affirmative\r\ncharacter of this word.\r\n\r\n{99b}  \"Veinoethyd,\" (_meinoethydd_;) not \"in the celebration of May\r\nEve,\" which is Davies's rendering, as we clearly infer from the\r\nconjunction of the word with \"meinddydd,\" (confessedly a _serene day_) in\r\nKadeir Taliesin and Gwawd y Lludd Mawr.  (See Myv. Arch. v. i. pp. 37,\r\n74.)\r\n\r\n{99c}  \"Gynatcan.\"  Al. \"gyvatcan,\" (_cyvadgan_) a proverb.  \"Though his\r\nsuccess was proverbial.\"\r\n\r\n{99d}  Or, \"Through ambition he was a soarer.\"  The person here\r\ncommemorated was of an ambitious turn of mind, and bore armorial ensigns\r\nof a corresponding character, which were looked upon, in a manner, as\r\nprophetic of his successful career as a warrior, but the result of this\r\nbattle miserably belied such a promise.\r\n\r\n    \"Prenial yw i bawb ei drachwres.\"\r\n\r\n    The path of glory leads but to the grave.--(Taliesin.)\r\n\r\n{99e}  Where Edinburgh now stands; and which was probably the head\r\nquarters of Mynyddawg, (see line 89 note.)  In a poem printed in Davies's\r\nMythology of the Druids, p. 574, and supposed to have been written by\r\nAneurin, Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch are represented as feasting with Mynyddawg.\r\n\r\n    \"Gan Vynydawc\r\n    Bu adveiliawc\r\n    Eu gwirodau.\"\r\n\r\n    Destructive were their wassails with Mynyddawg.\r\n\r\n{100a}  In the Poem alluded to, Tudvwlch Hir is described as a _man of\r\ndignity_, \"breein,\" and as having in conjunction with Cyvwlch made\r\nbreaches in the bastions of forts,--\r\n\r\n    \"A oreu vwlch ar vann caerau.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gorchan Maelderw in like manner speaks of him as,--\r\n\r\n    \"Tudvwlch the oppressor of war, the destroyer of forts.\"\r\n\r\n{100b}  \"Ech,\" [Greek text].\r\n\r\n{100c}  Lit. \"until the seventh day;\"--an expression intended probably to\r\ndenote the space of a week.  The operations of each day are specified\r\nfurther on in the Poem.  In like manner we are presented in \"Gwawd Lludd\r\ny Mawr,\" (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 74) with an enumeration of certain\r\nmartial deeds that were performed on each day during an entire week.\r\n\r\n{100d}  Lit. \"Should have made him a free man,\" or \"should have continued\r\nhim,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{100e}  Al. \"ugain,\" _a score_,\r\n\r\n{100f}  Al. the powerful supporter--\"drut nerthyd.\"\r\n\r\n{100g}  Kilydd is mentioned in the Mabinogi of \"Kilhwch and Olwen,\" where\r\nhe is represented as the son of Prince Kelyddon.\r\n\r\n{100h}  \"Gwyr;\" al. the hero, \"gwr.\"\r\n\r\n{101a}  Lit. \"the gleamers assembled.\"  The 1, 2, 3, and 6, versions,\r\n\"cyn hynt treiawr,\" might be translated \"ere the return of the ebbing\r\ntide,\" and the meaning of the whole would seem to be, that the men,\r\nhaving marched to the field of battle at dawn, experienced a bloody\r\nengagement before the evening; the space of time between tide and tide\r\nbeing equal to the length of a day.\r\n\r\n{101b}  \"Like the thunder of heaven was the clashing of the\r\nshields.\"--(Gorch. Mael.)\r\n\r\n{101c}  \"Od uch lle.\"  Al. \"Od uch lled,\" _above the plain_.\r\n\r\n{101d}  Mark the antithesis \"gwr llawr\"--\"arbennawr,\" and\r\n\"cethrawr\"--\"llavnawr.\"\r\n\r\n{101e}  \"En gystud heyrn;\" an allusion to the instrument which caused his\r\ndeath.  \"Ferreus somnus.\"\r\n\r\n{101f}  It is clear from this statement that Erthai was the lawful lord\r\nof the Mordei.  He had been deprived of his dominions for a time,\r\nprobably through the usurpation of the \"steel-clad commander,\" but at\r\nlength succeeded in recovering them.  Who Erthai was we know not;\r\nLlywarch Hen had a son, whose name bore some resemblance to the word: he\r\nis mentioned in the following triplet;--\r\n\r\n    \"The best three men in their country,\r\n    For protecting their habitation,\r\n    Eithyr and _Erthyr_ and Argad.\"  (Elegy on Old Age.)\r\n\r\n{102a}  Al. \"Erthgi,\" which is obviously the same as \"Arthgi,\" a\r\n_bear-dog_.  The rhythmical run of the line seems, however, to point to\r\nthe other as the proper word.\r\n\r\n{102b}  \"Erthychei;\" there is here evidently an allusion to the name of\r\nthe hero, (that is, supposing the name adopted in the translation to be\r\nthe right one) which consideration induces us to prefer it to the other\r\nreading, viz. \"erthrychei.\"  \"With the latter word, however, we should\r\ntranslate the passage as follows;--\r\n\r\n    \"In the front Erthai would mangle an army.\"\r\n\r\n{102c}  Al. \"dychurant,\" _will be afflicted_.\r\n\r\n{102d}  Probably Edeyrn may have been the hero of this stanza, and that a\r\nplay upon the word is intended in the expression \"edyrn diedyrn.\"  Edyrn\r\nthe kingdom will remain, but Edyrn the king is gone.\r\n\r\n{102e}  \"Gowyssawr,\" the furrower of battle: the designation of a\r\nwarrior.\r\n\r\n    \"Wyr i Vleddyn arv leiddiad\r\n    A oedd draw yn _cwysaw cad_.\"  (Hywel Cilan.)\r\n\r\n    A grandson of Bleddyn with the weapon of slaughter,\r\n    Was yonder furrowing the battle.\r\n\r\nAl. \"lynwyssawr,\" \"the plague;\" or \"the pool maker,\" in reference to the\r\neffusion of blood which he caused on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nAs just observed, this individual may have been Edeyrn, the son of Nudd\r\nab Beli ab Rhun ab Maelgwn ab Caswallon Lawhir ab Einiawn Yrth ab Cunedda\r\nab Edeyrn ab Padarn Beisrudd by Gwawl daughter of COEL GODEBOG, who would\r\nbe removed from the field of battle by his own clan.\r\n\r\n{103a}  \"Bu truan,\" just as in line 107.\r\n\r\n{103b}  The names of both these persons, as we have already seen, occur\r\ntogether in a Poem attributed to Aneurin, and printed in Davies's\r\nMythology of the Druids.  The latter, moreover, appears in the Tale of\r\n\"Kilhwch and Olwen,\" where a daughter of his is likewise mentioned by the\r\nname of Eheubryd.  Cyvwlch is there stated to have been one of the three\r\ngrandsons of Cleddyv Divwlch, the other two being Bwlch and Sevwich.\r\n\"Their three shields are three gleaming glitterers.  Their three spears\r\nare three pointed piercers.  Their three swords are three griding\r\ngashers, Glas, Glesig, and Clersag.\" (page 291.)\r\n\r\n{103c}  \"Leu,\" the root of \"goleu,\" \"lleuad,\" &c.  The other reading\r\n\"liw,\" is equally proper, even as we still say \"liw dydd,\" \"liw nos,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{103d}  Lit. \"rush-light.\"\r\n\r\n{103e}  Lit. \"its enmity lasted long.\"  The latter portion of this\r\nstanza, which refers to Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch, seems to have been\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\n{103f}  Qu. \"Icenorum arx?\"\r\n\r\n{103g}  \"Ewgei,\" _e wgei_ from \"gwg,\" _a frown_.  Al. \"negei,\" _he shewed\r\nresistance_, from \"nag,\" a _denial_.  So in \"Englynion y Beddau;\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Y Beddau hir yn Ngwanas\r\n    Ni chavas ae dioes\r\n    Pwy vynt hwy, pwy eu _neges_.\"\r\n\r\ni.e. \"who will own, or who will deny them.\"\r\n\r\n{104a}  Can this mean _blood_ or _bloody field_?  It is certain that\r\nMeigant (600-630) uses the word in that sense;--\r\n\r\n    \"_Plwde_ y danav hyd ymhen vy nghlun.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 160)\r\n\r\n    Under me was blood to the top of my knee.\r\n\r\n{104b}  \"Digalonnit,\" the other reading \"dygollovit,\" (dygoll ovid) would\r\nsignify that the horn _banished his sorrow_.\r\n\r\n{104c}  Al. \"Even on the foam-bordered Mordei.\"\r\n\r\n{104d}  Which \"Gwarthlev,\" ( the voice of reproach) was not.  Davies\r\nmakes \"eno bryt,\" into a proper name, and construes the sentence thus;--\r\n\r\n\"Whilst Gwarthlev and Enovryd were pouring forth the liquor.\"\r\n\r\n{105a}  \"Arch.\"  Al. \"arth en llwrw.\"  \"He was an impetuous bear.\"  There\r\nmay be here a faint allusion to the name Gwarthlev, nor is it unlikely\r\nthat his ensign bore the figure of a bear.\r\n\r\n{105b}  \"Gwd,\" (gwdd) _that turns round_.\r\n\r\n{105c}  \"Gyfgein,\" (cyvgein) _co-light_.\r\n\r\n{105d}  A peculiarity observable in Welsh documents is, that they\r\nfrequently consign general circumstances to the island of Britain in\r\nparticular.  This may be exemplified by the account which is given of the\r\ndeluge in Triad 13.  (Third Series;)--\r\n\r\n    \"The three awful events of the _Isle of Britain_; first, the bursting\r\n    of the lake of waters, and the overwhelming of the face of all lands;\r\n    so that all mankind were drowned, excepting Dwyvan and Dwyvach, who\r\n    escaped in a naked vessel, and of them the Isle of Britain was\r\n    repeopled,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{105e}  Gwrveling.\r\n\r\n{105f}  Al. \"ungentle.\"\r\n\r\n{105g}  Vide supra, lines 89, 113.\r\n\r\n{105h}  As there is nothing to rhyme with \"ryodres,\" probably there is a\r\nline left out here.\r\n\r\n{106a}  It would appear from this that the feast was given in celebration\r\nof the time of harvest.  That the Britons, like the Jews, exhibited signs\r\nof great joy at that season, may be inferred from the following Triads of\r\nDyvnwal Moelmud.  (Myv. Arch. vol. iii. p. 283.)\r\n\r\n    \"Tair clud udcorn sydd; dygynnull gwlad gan riaint a phencenedloedd,\r\n    _corn cynhauav_, a chorn cad a rhyvel rhag gormes gorwlad ac estron.\"\r\n\r\n    There are three trumpet progressions; the assembly of a country\r\n    according to heads of families and chiefs of tribes, the horn of\r\n    harvest, and the horn of war and of battle against the oppression of\r\n    neighbours and aliens.\r\n\r\n    \"Tair clud addwyn y sydd; beirdd yn darogan heddwch, _cyrch\r\n    cynhauav_, a phriodas.\"\r\n\r\n    There are three happy progressions; bards announcing peace, a meeting\r\n    in harvest time, and a marriage.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri corn cynghlud y sydd; _corn cynhauav_, corn dadlau, a chorn\r\n    goly-chwyd.\"\r\n\r\n    There are three horns for mutual progression; the horn of harvest,\r\n    the horn of contention, and the horn for religious adoration.\r\n\r\n{106b}  \"Arvel,\" which is required on account of the rhyme.\r\n\r\n{106c}  Bright shields, which are here likened to wings.\r\n\r\n    \"Y gylchwy dan y gymwy bu adenawc.\"  Line 361\r\n\r\n    His round shield was with fire winged for slaughter.\r\n\r\n{106d}  An allusion to the trappings of the horses.\r\n\r\n{107a}  \"Diryf.\"  \"Rhyv;\" that enlarges or swells out; \"diryv,\" without\r\nenlargement.

This view\r\nof it might in like manner apply to the statement made at line 49.\r\n\r\n{108b}  \"Trychwn,\" i.e. tri cwn (a head) a regiment commanded by one\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n{108c}  Al. \"Thrice six,\" &c.

That as many as\r\n300 commanders should issue from Eiddin, can only be explained on the\r\nsupposition that, because of its proximity to Cattraeth, it formed the\r\nprincipal station of the allied forces.\r\n\r\n{108d}  Lit. \"golden kings wearing chains.\"  The manner in which the\r\ngreater and lesser numbers are placed in juxtaposition (lines 184-187)\r\nmakes it very probable that the latter designate the commanders of the\r\ntroops there mentioned.  And we may well suppose that the statement from\r\nline 188 to line 191 is a mere continuation of the character of the\r\n\"three bold knights.\"\r\n\r\n{108e}  _Lead_, being heavy, answers to \"trwm\" in the preceding line.\r\n\r\n{108f}  A reference to the armour of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n{109a}  Or \"who were Brython.\"  The Brython were the third \"social tribe\r\nof the Isle of Britain,\" who \"came from the land of Llydaw, and were\r\ndescended from the primitive tribe of the Cymry,\" (Triad 5, third\r\nseries.)  Being the third principal tribe that settled in Britain, it is\r\nprobable that their original inheritance was Alban, one of the \"three\r\nprincipal provinces of the Isle of Britain,\" (See Triad 2) which they\r\nmust have occupied prior to the time of Prydain the son of Aedd Mawr.\r\nDunbarton is Dun Bretton, i.e. Dinas y Brython.\r\n\r\n{109b}  Cynon was the son of Clydno Eiddin, and one of the three\r\ncounselling warriors of Arthur.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri chyngoriad varchawg llys Arthur; Cynon ab Clydno Eiddin, Arawn\r\n    ab Cynvarch, a Llywarch Hen ab Elidyr Lydanwyn.\"  (Triad 86, first\r\n    series.)\r\n\r\nHe was also one of the \"three ardent lovers,\" on account of his passion\r\nfor Morvydd, daughter of Urien Rheged.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri serchawg Ynys Prydain; Caswallawn mab Beli am Flur merch Fugnach\r\n    Gorr, a Thrystan mab Tallwch am Essyllt gwreig March Meirchiawn ei\r\n    ewythr, a Chynon ab Clydno Eiddun am Forwydd verch Urien.\"  (Tr. 53.)\r\n\r\nCynon ab Clydno Eiddin was educated at the college of Llancarvan, and is\r\nsaid to have answered one of the seven questions proposed by Cattwg\r\nDdoeth, the President, as follows,--\r\n\r\n    \"Pa gamp decav ar ddyn?\r\n    Atteb.  Cyweirdeb.\"  (Cynan ab Clydno Eiddin ai dywawd.)\r\n\r\n    What is man's fairest quality?\r\n    Answer.  Sincerity.\r\n\r\nHis grave is recorded in the Englynion y Beddau.  (Myv. Arch. vol i. p.\r\n79.)\r\n\r\n{109c}  We adopt this as a proper name, because it makes up the number\r\nthree.  A person of that name is mentioned in the following stanza;--\r\n\r\n    \"A glywaist ti chwedl Cynrain,\r\n    Pen cyngor Ynys Prydain,\r\n    Gwell ydyw cadw nag olrhain.\"\r\n\r\n    Hast thou heard the saying of Cynrain,\r\n    The chief counsellor of the Island of Britain?\r\n    Better to keep than to pursue.  (Iolo MSS. pp. 251, 651.)\r\n\r\nThe word has however been construed \"chief spearmen,\" and \"of the stock\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n{109d}  There is a place so called in Cardiganshire.\r\n\r\n{110a}  Al. \"gogyverth,\" to oppose.\r\n\r\n{110b}  \"Yn hon,\" from _on_ an ash, and by metonymy, a spear.  Or, as\r\n\"hon\" means what is present to the sight, we may construe the passage\r\nthus,--\r\n\r\n    \"To greet openly,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{110c}  \"Deivyr diverogion,\" the droppers of Deivyr; not \"the men who\r\ndropped _into_ Deira,\" as Davies has it.  Deivyr and Bryneich were now\r\nopposed to the British patriots.  See lines 50, 78.\r\n\r\n{110d}  Namely Cydywal, a chieftain of Gwynedd, now stationed in the\r\nregion of Mordei; considering the disaster that ensued, it appeared\r\nwhilst he presided over the banquet in his own camp, as if he were merely\r\npreparing a feast for the birds of prey.\r\n\r\n{110e}  His history is unknown.\r\n\r\n{110f}  \"Cyn y,\" i.e. _cyni_.\r\n\r\n{111a}  Nothing is known of this diviner.\r\n\r\n{111b}  The \"croes\" was probably a kind of cross bow.  Taliesin in\r\n\"Gwaith Gwenystrad\" says of the slain warriors,--\r\n\r\n    \"Llaw ynghroes\"--\r\n\r\nWhich has been translated by Ieuan Vardd,\r\n\r\n    \"Their hands were on the crucifix [cross.]\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p.\r\n    52.)\r\n\r\nAl. \"Athrwys,\" (ath-rhwys) \"very vigorously.\"\r\n\r\n{111c}  This appears to have been the compact entered into by the\r\ndifferent tribes of the Britons, for the purpose of withstanding the\r\nusurpation of the common foe.  See line 32.\r\n\r\n{111d}  \"Ermygei,\" which might also, and perhaps more literally, be\r\nrendered _he paid respect to_.  The other reading \"dirmygei,\" would mean\r\n_he spurned_, or _dishonoured_.\r\n\r\n{111e}  \"Blaen Gwynedd,\" the borders of North Wales, whither the Saxon\r\nencroachment had already extended.\r\n\r\n{112a}  \"Fawd ut,\" i.e. ffawddyd, from ffawdd, radiation, splendour.  We\r\nmay also render the sentence as follows,--\r\n\r\n    \"I fell by the radiant rampart, (ffin)\"\r\n\r\nthe epithet _radiant_ having a reference to the arms of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n{112b}  Or, as a moral reflection,--\r\n\r\n    \"A hero's prowess is not without ambition.\"\r\n\r\nThere are various readings of the word which is here translated\r\n_prowess_, e.g. cobnet, colwed, eofned, but all of them are capable of\r\nthat construction, thus \"cobnet\" comes from _cobiaw_, to thump, \"colwed,\"\r\nfrom _col_ a sting, or a prop, whilst \"eofned\" literally means\r\nfearlessness.\r\n\r\n{112c}  In Maelderw's stanzas thus,--\r\n\r\n    \"When all went up, thou didst go down.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place,--\r\n\r\n    \"When all were extended, thou didst also fall.\"\r\n\r\n{112d}  The line in Gorchan Maelderw, Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 62, has been\r\ntranslated by Dr. W. O. Pughe,\r\n\r\n    \"Present, ere he spoke, was carried with the arms.\"  (Dict. _Voce_\r\n    Breichiawl.)\r\n\r\nThat in the other Gorchan of Maelderw, page 85, may be rendered,\r\n\r\n    Present narrates that he was carried with the arms.\r\n\r\n{113a}  Lit. \"Three heroes and three score and three hundred, wearing the\r\ngolden torques.\"\r\n\r\n{113b}  If \"ffosawd\" ever bears the meaning assigned to it by Dr. Pughe,\r\nit must have derived it from the practise of fighting in the _fosse_ of a\r\ncamp, (which would be peculiarly _gashing_) for on his own showing the\r\nword has no other etymon than that of \"ffos,\" a _ditch_, a _trench_.\r\nFrom the same root Merddin gives it the sense of burial--defossio.\r\n\r\n       \"A hyt vraut yth goffaaf\r\n    Dy _ffossaut_ trallaut trymmaf.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 149.)\r\n\r\n    Until doom will I remember\r\n    Thy interment, which was a most heavy affliction.\r\n\r\nLikewise Taliesin;--\r\n\r\n    \"Hyd ydd aeth ef\r\n    Ercwlf mur _ffosawd_\r\n    As arnut tywawd.\"  (Myv. Arch. i. p. 69.)\r\n\r\n    Until he, Ercwlf,\r\n    Descended into the fosse of the rampart,\r\n    And was covered with sand.\r\n\r\n{114a}  Their names are given in \"Gwarchan Cynvelyn.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol.\r\ni. page 60.  Davies's Mythology, page 622.)\r\n\r\n    Three warriors and three score and three hundred,\r\n    To the conflict of Cattraeth went forth;\r\n    Of those who hastened from the mead of the cup-bearers,\r\n    Three only returned,\r\n    Cynon and Cadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant,\r\n    And I myself from the shedding of blood.--\r\n\r\n{114b}  The grave of Cynon is thus recorded;--\r\n\r\n    \"Bet gur gwaud urtin\r\n    In uchel titin in isel gwelitin\r\n    Bet Cynon mab Clytno Idin.\"\r\n\r\n    The grave of a warrior of high renown\r\n    Is in a lofty region--but a lowly bed;\r\n    The grave of Cynon the son of Clydno Eiddin.\r\n\r\nAnd in another stanza;\r\n\r\n    \"Piau y bet y dann y brin\r\n    Bet gur gwrt yng Kiuiscin\r\n    Bet Kinon mab Clytno Idin.\"\r\n\r\n    Whose is the grave beneath the hill?\r\n    It is the grave of a warrior valiant in the conflict,--\r\n    The grave of Cynon the son of Clydno Eiddin.  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p.\r\n    79.)\r\n\r\nA saying of Cadreith has been preserved in the Englynion y Clywed.\r\n\r\n    \"A glyweisti a gant Cadreith\r\n    Fab Porthawr filwr areith\r\n    Ni char Dofydd diobeith.\"  (Myv. Arch. i. 175.)\r\n\r\n    Hast thou heard what Cadreith sang,\r\n    The son of Porthawr, with the warlike speech?\r\n    God loves not the despairer.\r\n\r\n{114c}  \"Gwenwawd.\"  It might be translated \"flattering song,\" but\r\n_candid_ or _sacred_ seems more consonant with the character of a Bard,\r\nwhose motto was \"Y gwir yn erbyn y byd.\"  We may presume that Aneurin on\r\nthis occasion displayed his heraldic badge, which, according to the law\r\nof nations, would immediately cause a cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\n    \"Tair braint Beirdd ynys Prydain; Trwyddedogaeth lle'r elont; nas\r\n    dycer arv noeth yn eu herbyn: a gair eu gair hwy ar bawb.\"\r\n\r\n    The three primary privileges of the Bards of the Isle of Britain;\r\n    maintenance wherever they go; that no naked weapon be borne in their\r\n    presence; and their word be preferred to that of all others.\r\n    (Institutional Triads.  See also Myv. Arch. vol. iii.  Laws of\r\n    Dyvnwal Moelmud.)\r\n\r\n    \"Sed me per hostes Mercurius celer\r\n    Denso paventem sustulit aere.  (Horace Carm. lib. ii. Ode 7.)\r\n\r\n{115a}  \"Gwyn dragon;\" probably Hengist, who bore, as his arms, a _white\r\nprancing horse_ upon a red field.  There is here accordingly an allusion\r\nto the first arrival of the Saxons, which was the cause to the Britons of\r\nall their national calamities for many a long year after.\r\n\r\nAl. \"Had it not been for the two hundred (al. ten hundred) men of the\r\nwhite-bannered commander.\"\r\n\r\n{115b}  Or, \"we were not--until.\" &c.\r\n\r\n{115c}  Lit. \"thorn bushes.\"  For an illustration of the advantage which\r\nthe natives would derive from their woods and thickets in times of war,\r\nthe reader is referred to a story told of Caradoc in the Iolo MSS. pp.\r\n185, 597. which on account of its length we cannot transfer into our\r\npages.\r\n\r\n{115d}  Or more sententiously, as Davies has it,\r\n\r\n    \"Base is he in the field, who is base to his own relatives.\"\r\n\r\nThe construction adopted in the text, might allude to the marriage of\r\nRowena with Vortigern.\r\n\r\n{116a}  \"Llwyeu,\" from \"llwyv,\" a _frame_, a _platform_, a _loft_.  Or it\r\nmay be \"llwyv,\" an _elm tree_, in reference to the devastation of the\r\ngroves just mentioned.  The elm was very common in the island at the\r\nperiod under consideration.  Taliesin celebrates a battle entitled\r\n\"Gwaith Argoed Llwyvein,\" which means \"the battle of the forest of elms.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A rhag gwaith Argoed Llwyvain\r\n    Bu llawer celain.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 53.)\r\n\r\nAl. \"When we were deprived of our sharpened weapons.\"\r\n\r\n{116b}  Thus in Gorchan Maelderw,--\r\n\r\n    \"There trod not, in Gododin, on the surface of the fosse,\r\n    When deprived of his sharpened weapon, none more destitute.\"\r\n\r\n{116c}  One reading has \"the weapon of death,\" another, \"the death-formed\r\nweapon, is broken and motionless.\"\r\n\r\n{116d}  If we give an affirmative meaning to the words \"angkynnull\r\nagkymandull agkysgoget,\" the couplet might be thus rendered,--\r\n\r\n    \"They assembled in arms, and in complete array they moved along,\r\n    And rolled through the mighty horde.\"\r\n\r\nIt is observable that Carnhuanawc adopted this affirmative form in a\r\nsimilar passage with which \"Gorchan Tudvwlch\" opens, thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Arv ynghynnull,\r\n    Yn nghymandull,\r\n       Twrv yn agwedd;\r\n    Y rhag meiwedd,\r\n    Y rhag mawredd,\r\n       Y rhag madiedd.\"\r\n\r\n    They assemble in arms,\r\n    The forces are marshalled,\r\n       Tumult approaches:\r\n    In the van are the warlike,\r\n    In the van are the noble,\r\n       In the van are the good.\r\n\r\nAnd he moreover traces a similarity between this style and that of\r\nTacitus, wherein the latter describes the effects of Galgacus's address\r\nupon his British followers;--\r\n\r\n    \"Jamque agmina, et armorum fulgores, audentissimi, cujusque procursu,\r\n    simul instruebantur acies.\"  (See Hanes Cymru, p. 96.)\r\n\r\n{117a}  Al. \"llawr,\" \"and _prostrate_ the horde of the Lloegrians.\"\r\n\r\n{117b}  The Lloegrians were the second \"social tribe\" that settled in\r\nBritain.  Their province was that of Lloegyr, by which the Welsh still\r\ndesignate England, (Triads v. ii. first series) though there is reason to\r\nbelieve that it was originally of much smaller extent.  The Lloegrians\r\nfor the most part coalesced with the Saxons, (Triad vii. third series)\r\nand grievously harassed the Cymry in the sixth century.\r\n\r\n    \"Cynddylan, cae di y rhiw,\r\n    Er yddaw Lloegyrwys heddiw;\r\n    Amgeledd am un nid gwiw!\"  (Llywarch Hen.)\r\n\r\n    Cynddylan, guard thou the cliff,\r\n    Against any Lloegrians that may come this day;\r\n    Concern for one should not avail.\r\n\r\n{117c}  \"Ygcynuor,\" i.e. \"yn cynvor.\"  Al. \"cynnor,\" _the entrance_.  Al.\r\n\"ynghynwr,\" _in the turmoil_.\r\n\r\n{117d}  This probably refers to the enemy, who, being pagans, burnt their\r\ndead.  The fact might have been suggested to the poet's mind, by the name\r\nof his hero \"Graid,\" which signifies _heat_.\r\n\r\n{117e}  Viz. that of Graid.\r\n\r\n{117f}  The rhyme determines this form, which occurs in 1.  In Gorchan\r\nMaelderw, we have, instead of Graid the son of Hoewgi, \"Braint the son of\r\nBleiddgi.\"\r\n\r\n{118a}  \"Orwydan,\" from Gorwydd.  Another way of translating these lines\r\nwould be--\r\n\r\n    \"There was the hero of the two shielded wings,\r\n    The one with the variegated front; the other of like quality with\r\n    Prydwen;\r\n\r\nwhich was the name of Arthur's shield;--\r\n\r\n    \"Tarian a gymmerai Arthur ar ei Ysgwydd, yr hon a elwid Prydwen.\"\r\n\r\n    A shield did Arthur take upon his shoulder, which was called Prydwen.\r\n    (Gr. ab Arthur.)\r\n\r\nThe supposition that Arthur's shield had already acquired a notable\r\nrenown is indirectly corroborated by an alleged contemporary poem,\r\n\"Preiddiau Annwn.\"  (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 45) in which his ship of the\r\nsame name is clearly invested with a similarly extravagant character,--\r\n\r\n    \"Tri lloneid Prydwen ydd aetham ni ar for.\"\r\n\r\n{118b}  Al. \"in the midst of arms.\"\r\n\r\n{118c}  Perhaps scintillations from the clash of arms.\r\n\r\n{118d}  Occasioned by the brightness of the arms.  Al. \"Clouded was the\r\ndawn, and the sun,\" Al. \"there was misery.\"\r\n\r\n{118e}  \"_Bud_ e vran,\" an allusion to the name of _Bud_van.\r\n\r\n{119a}  An old Adage says,--\r\n\r\n    \"Nac addev dy rin i was.\"\r\n\r\n    Reveal not thy secrets to a servant.\r\n\r\n{119b}  Perhaps buried on the field of battle, where the horses would\r\ntrample on his grave; or the expression might allude to the mode of his\r\nbeing conveyed by horses to his last resting place.\r\n\r\n{119c}  \"Eleirch,\" lit. _swans_, but the expression \"meirch eilw\r\neleirch,\" (horses of the colour of swans) in the Maelderw version, seems\r\nto favour the translation we have given above.\r\n\r\n{119d}  Or, \"the trappings\" of his charger.\r\n\r\n{119e}  His history is not known.\r\n\r\n{120a}  That is, he would not cowardly desert his post, and thus leave an\r\nopening in the rank.\r\n\r\n{120b}  During the Christmas festivities, which lasted for twelve days:\r\n\r\n    \"Llon ceiliog a thwylluan\r\n    Au _deuddeng-nydd_ yn hoean\"--Engl. y Misoedd.\r\n\r\nOn those occasions Bards and minstrels were frequent guests at the halls\r\nof the nobility, and their company contributed not a little to the\r\ngeneral entertainment.  The air \"Nos Galan,\" we may fairly presume, was a\r\nfavourite at those festivities.\r\n\r\n{120c}  The word \"arvaeth\" in this poem seems to have a reference\r\nthroughout to \"arwydd,\" or _ensign_.  Thus we may suppose that Gwenabwy\r\nbore the _Dragon_ for his arms, which device conveyed the idea of\r\ndevastation, rather than that of cultivation.\r\n\r\n{120d}  The Bard, according to his general custom, is here contrasting\r\nthe two aspects of his hero's character, the domestic and the martial.\r\n\r\n{121a}  A person of the name of Gwenabwy is mentioned in the Hoiannau of\r\nMerddin.--Myv. Arch. v. i. p. 137.\r\n\r\n{121b}  Llywarch Hen had a son of the name of Gwen: see his Elegy on Old\r\nAge, where he speaks in rapturous terms of the youth's valour.\r\n\r\n    \"Pedwar meib ar ugaint a'm bu,\r\n    Eurdorchawg, tywysawg llu;\r\n    Oedd Gwen goreu o naddu,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    Four and twenty sons I have had,\r\n    Wearing the golden chain, leaders of armies;\r\n    Gwen was the best of them.\r\n\r\n{121c}  \"Mai y _mead y gathleu_.\"  There seems to be a playful allusion\r\nin these words to _mewian_ and _cath_, the mewing of a cat.\r\n\r\n{121d}  \"Meirch,\" suggested by the name \"Marchleu.\"\r\n\r\n{121e}  Al. \"Maenor,\" stones.\r\n\r\n{121f}  Or \"by the commander on his prancing charger.\"  \"Llemenig,\" might\r\nbe a proper name, for we find that one of \"the three free guests of the\r\ncourt of Arthur,\" was so called.  Nevertheless, as it would in that\r\ncharacter appear somewhat out of place here, we have chosen the\r\netymological sense in preference.\r\n\r\n{121g}  \"Vym am,\" i.e. vy mam, as it occurs, though with the addition of\r\nam vyrn, in 6.\r\n\r\n{121h}  The Bard would here pay an indirect compliment to his own\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\n{122a}  \"Bedryolet.\"  Al. \"Spears of quartered ash were scattered from\r\nhis hand.\"\r\n\r\n{122b}  \"Veinnyell.\"  Al. \"veingel,\" qu. narrow shelter?\r\n\r\n{122c}  Mygedorth is mentioned by Llywarch Hen,--\r\n\r\n    \"Yn Llongborth gwelais i vygedorth\r\n    A gwyr yn godde ammorth\r\n    A gorvod gwedi gorborth.\"\r\n\r\n    In Llongborth I beheld a solemn pile,\r\n    And men suffering privation,\r\n    And in a state of subjection after excess of fruition\r\n\r\nIt is likewise alluded to in the Triads,--\r\n\r\n    \"Cornan, march meibion Elifer Gosgorddfawr, a ddwg arnaw Gwrgi,\r\n    Peredur, Dunawd Fyr, a Chynfelyn Drwsgl, i edrych ar fygedorth\r\n    Gwenddoleu yn Arderydd.\"\r\n\r\n    Cornan, the horse of the sons of Elifer with the great retinue,\r\n    carried Gwrgi, Peredur, Dunawd Fyr, and Cynfelyn the stumbler, to see\r\n    the funeral pile of Gwenddoleu in Arderydd.\r\n\r\n    \"Falsely was it said by Tudlew,\r\n    That no one's steeds would be overtaken by Marchleu;\r\n    As he was reared to bring support to all around,\r\n    Powerful was the stroke of his sword upon the adversary;\r\n    Eagerly ascended the ashen spear from the grasp of his hand,\r\n    From the narrow summit of the awful pile.\"  _Gorch. Mael_.\r\n\r\n{122d}  \"Vygu,\" or \"the place where he would suffocate some one.\"\r\n\r\n{122e}  Or, \"he would cut (lladd, mow) with a blade armfuls of furze.\"\r\nThe furze was for the purpose of supplying the pile.\r\n\r\n{122f}  When the weather is unsettled in harvest time, the reapers\r\ndisplay greater energy and activity during the intervals of sunshine;\r\nhence the point of the simile.\r\n\r\n{123a}  Nothing more is known of this chieftain.\r\n\r\n{123b}  Or \"Isaac,\" as a proper name.\r\n\r\n{123c}  \"O barth deheu.\"  \"Deheu,\" literally means _the right_, and as\r\nthe mid-day sun is to the right of a person looking eastward, the word is\r\nalso taken to signify the south; hence we say \"deheudir\" for South Wales.\r\nThe \"parth deheu\" in this place must accordingly mean some district south\r\nof the scene of action, such as Wales, where Gwyddno and his family\r\nresided, would be.\r\n\r\n{123d}  \"Devodeu,\" manners, customs.\r\n\r\n{123e}  That is, the ebb and influx of the tide represented the contrary\r\naspects of his character, the mild and the impetuous, which are\r\nrespectively described in the succeeding lines.\r\n\r\n{123f}  Al. \"_from_ the point of Maddeu.\"\r\n\r\n{123g}  If we take this \"clawdd\" to be the Catrail, we must look for\r\nOffer and Maddeu towards the extremity most remote from head quarters,\r\ni.e. the fort of Eiddin, (Edinburgh) and it is rather remarkable that,\r\nwhilst the Catrail is generally supposed to terminate southward at the\r\nPeel-fell, some eminent antiquaries have fixed its furthest point at\r\nCastle _Over_, where there is a British fort, and others have thought\r\nthat they could trace it in the _Maiden-way_ near the Roman wall, though\r\nit must be confessed that these supposed continuations are by a third\r\nparty regarded as Roman roads.  The similarity between the words Offer\r\nand Over is very obvious.  Baxter identifies _Over_ with _Oliclavis_,\r\nwhich is naught else but _ol y clawdd_ the extremity of the rampart.\r\n\r\n{124a}  Al. \"There was no young offspring that he cut not to pieces, no\r\naged man that he did not scatter about.\"\r\n\r\n{124b}  \"Murgreit.\"  The title is ascribed by Taliesin to the Deity.\r\n\r\n    \"Trindawd tragywydd\r\n    A oreu elvydd,\r\n    A gwedi elvydd,\r\n    Addav yn gelvydd;\r\n    A gwedi Adda,\r\n    Y goreu Eva;\r\n    Yr Israel bendigaid\r\n    A oreu _Murgraia_.\"\r\n\r\n    The eternal Trinity\r\n    Made the elements;\r\n    And after the elements\r\n    Adam wonderfully;\r\n    And after Adam\r\n    He made Eve;\r\n    The blessed Israel\r\n    The _mighty Spirit_ made.

A character mentioned in the Mabinogion, goes by the name\r\nof Gwyddneu ab Llwydau.\r\n\r\n{124d}  Mr. Davies thinks that this warrior was the son of Cunedda, who\r\ngave his name to Ceredigion.  As Cunedda, however, flourished in the\r\nearly part of the fifth century, the martial age of his son Ceredig would\r\nnot well coincide with the date of this poem.  There was another Caredig,\r\nwho succeeded Maelgwn Gwynedd as king of the Britons, about A.D. 590.\r\n\r\n{125a}  \"Lletvegin;\" lit. a _domestic animal_.  We have another example\r\nhere of the Bard's favourite practice of contrasting the different\r\nqualities of the person whom he celebrates.\r\n\r\n{125b}  Or \"When the appointed time of his departure is at hand,\" q.d.,\r\n\"gar cyrdd,\" from \"cerdd\" a _walk_.  The adopted reading, however, is\r\nvery strongly corroborated by passages in other poems, where \"cyrdd\" is\r\nunmistakeably used as the plural of \"cerdd,\" a _song_, e.g.--\r\n\r\n    \"Cyrdd a cherddorion\r\n    A chathleu englynion.\"\r\n\r\n    Songs and minstrels,\r\n    And Angel's melodies.  (Taliesin.)\r\n\r\n    \"Ys cad ffyrdd, ys _car cyrdd_ cyflef.\"\r\n\r\n    \"He is the roads of battle, he is the friend of harmonious songs.\"\r\n    (Cynddelw.)\r\n\r\n    \"Llary deyrn cedyrn yn cadw gwesti _cyrdd_,\r\n    _Cerddorion_ gyflochi.\"\r\n\r\n    A mild prince of mighty men keeping festivals of songs,\r\n    And equally protecting the minstrels.  (Llygad Gwr.)\r\n\r\n    \"Arddelw cain ffyrdd _cyrdd cyflef_,\r\n    Urddedig wledig wlad nef.\"\r\n\r\n    Claim the splendid paths of harmonious songs,\r\n    Consecrated governor of the kingdom of heaven.  (Bleddyn Vardd.)\r\n\r\n{125c}  A favourite saying of a person of that name has been preserved in\r\nthe following triplet;\r\n\r\n    \"A glywaist ti chwedl Ceredig\r\n    Brenin doeth detholedig?\r\n    Pawb a'i droed ar syrthiedig.\"\r\n\r\n    Hast thou heard the saying of Ceredig,\r\n    A wise and select king?\r\n    Every one has his foot on the fallen.  (Iolo MSS. pp. 259, 664.)\r\n\r\n{126a}  The other reading \"ceiniad\" would mean a _minstrel_, which, on\r\nthe supposition that the chieftain of the present is the same with that\r\nof the preceding stanza, would further support the textual construction\r\nwhich we have given there to \"car cyrdd,\" viz. _the friend of song_.\r\n\r\n{126b}  Al. \"gowan,\" gashing.\r\n\r\n{126c}  Al. \"Crwydyr,\" perambulated.\r\n\r\n{126d}  \"Cystudd daear,\" _buried_; \"cystudd haiarn,\" _killed_.  See line\r\n128.\r\n\r\n{126e}  Caradawg Vreichvras, chief elder (pen hynaiv) of Gelliwig in\r\nCornwall.  (Triad lxiv. first series.)  According to the Triads he was\r\none of the battle knights of the Isle of Britain, and in the Englyn\r\nattributed to Arthur he is styled \"Pillar of Cymru.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Tri chadvarchawg Teyrn ynys Prydain: Caradawc Vreiehvras, a Llyr\r\n    Lluyddawg, a Mael ab Menwaed o Arllechwedd; ac Arthur a gant iddynt\r\n    hynn o Englyn,\r\n\r\n    Sev ynt vy nhri chadvarchawg\r\n    Mael hir a Llyr Lluyddawg,\r\n    A cholovn Cymru Caradawg.\"  (Triad 29.)\r\n\r\nCaradawg's horse Lluagor is recorded as one of the three battle horses of\r\nthe Island.  (Trioedd y Meirch, Myv. Arch. vol. ii. p. 20.)\r\n\r\n{127a}  This simile has evidently some connection with the story told of\r\nCaradawg, that owing to his well founded confidence in his wife's virtue,\r\nhe was able to carve a certain Boar's head, an adventure in which his\r\ncompeers failed.  It is remarkable also that the Boar's head, in some\r\nform or other, appears as the armorial bearing of all of his name.  See\r\nthe \"Dream of Rhonabwy.\"--Note. Al. \"red boar.\"\r\n\r\n{127b}  This statement may have two meanings, the one real, as indicative\r\nof what did actually take place, namely, that the dogs came out of the\r\nneighbouring woods to feed upon the corpses which had fallen by the band\r\nof Caradawg; the other allegorical, as referring to himself in his\r\ncharacter of a boar or a bull, the wild dogs being his enemies, who thus\r\nhunted and baited him.\r\n\r\n{127c}  We may infer from this admission that the Bard's statements,\r\nthough poetically adorned, are, as to the main facts, framed with a\r\nstrict regard to truth.  Thus no less than four vouchers for the\r\ncorrectness of his description of Caradawg's valour are presented to our\r\nnotice by name.\r\n\r\n{127d}  Gwriad was the son of Gwrien, one of the three princes of vassal\r\norigin.  (See line 56: notes.)  Gwynn might have been either Gwyn\r\nGodyvron or Gwyn ab Nudd; both alluded to in the Mabinogi of Kilhwch and\r\nOlwen.\r\n\r\n{127e}  Lit. its _mangling_ or _hewing_.\r\n\r\n{127f}  We should have been tempted to construe the line thus,--\r\n\r\n    \"From the broken hill of _encounter_,\"\r\n\r\nMaking \"kynn caffat\" into one word \"cynghaffad,\" had we not been\r\nprecluded by the peculiar metre which version third presents throughout,\r\nand which accordingly requires \"cyn\" in this place to rhyme with\r\n\"fryn.\"--\r\n\r\n    \"O fryn } caffad.\"\r\n    Hydwn cyn }\r\n\r\nPossibly \"Hydwn\" may be identified with _Hdddinam_ or _Hadingtoun_, in\r\nthe province of Valentia.\r\n\r\n{128a}  Al. \"vron,\" the presence.  Caradawg's father was Llyr Merini, a\r\nprince of Cornwall.\r\n\r\n{128b}  Al. \"eurawc,\" covered with gold.\r\n\r\n{128c}  Caradawg Vreichvras, just mentioned.\r\n\r\n{128d}  These two were doubtless sons of Llywarch Hen, mentioned together\r\nin the following stanza;--\r\n\r\n    \"Na Phyll, na Madawg, ni byddynt hiroedlawg,\r\n    Or ddevawd y gelwynt;\r\n    'Rhoddyn!'--'na roddyn!'--cyngrair byth nis erchynt!\"\r\n\r\n    Nor Pyll, nor Madawg, would be long lived,\r\n    If according to custom there was a calling--\r\n    \"Surrender!\"  \"They would not surrender!\" quarters they ever scorned.\r\n    (Elegy on Old Age, &c.)\r\n\r\n{129a}  Two persons named Gwgan and Gwion occur together in a Triad, as\r\nhaving been sentinels in the battle of Bangor, A.D. 603.  As that event,\r\nhowever, happened subsequently to the battle of Cattraeth, where the\r\nheroes of the stanza were killed, the parties could not be the same.\r\nThere was another Gwgawn, designated Llawgadarn, who is ranked with\r\nGwrnerth and Eidiol in a Triad of the three strong men of Britain.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri gyrddion ynys Prydain: Gwrnerth Ergydlym, a laddes yr arth mwyav\r\n    ac a welwyd erioed a saeth wellten; a Gwgawn Llawgadarn, a dreiglis\r\n    maen maenarch o'r glynn i benn y mynydd, ac nid oedd llai na thrugain\r\n    ych ai tynnai; ac Eidiol Gadarn, a laddes o'r Saeson ym mrad\r\n    Caersallawg chwechant a thrigain a chogail gerdin o fachlud haul hyd\r\n    yn nhywyll.\"  (Triad lx. third series.)\r\n\r\nFavourite expressions of both Gwgan and Gwiawn are recorded in Chwedlau'r\r\nDoethion.  (Iolo MSS. pp. 251, 651.)\r\n\r\n    \"A glywaist ti chwedl Gwgan,\r\n    Gwedi dianc o'r ffwdan?\r\n    Addaw mawr a rhodd fechan.\"\r\n\r\n    Hast thou heard the saying of Gwgan,\r\n    After escaping from the turmoil?\r\n    Great promise and a small gift.\r\n\r\n    \"A glywaist ti chwedl Gwiawn,\r\n    Dremynwr, golwg uniawn?\r\n    Duw cadarn a farn pob iawn.\"\r\n\r\n    Hast thou heard the saying of Gwiawn,\r\n    The observer of accurate sight?\r\n    The mighty God will determine every right.\r\n\r\n{129b}  See proceeding stanza.  Gwion and Gwyn are mentioned together as\r\nthe sons of Cyndrwyn by Llywarch Hen.  See his Elegy on Cynddylan.\r\n\r\n{129c}  The son of Evrog, and one of the knights of the court of Arthur,\r\nwho found the Greal.--\r\n\r\n    \"Tri marchawg llys Arthur a gawsant y Greal.

The \"horn of Gwlgawd Gododin\"\r\nis mentioned in the Tale of \"Kilhwch and Olwen,\" p. 283.\r\n\r\n{131b}  Or in reference to the banquet itself,--\"notable were its\r\neffects, and it was the price which bought the battle of Cattraeth,\" i.e.\r\nbought, or brought about its disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\n{131c}  That is, contributed his life towards a victory.\r\n\r\n{131d}  Or _giantlike_; a reference to his stature, implied in the title\r\n\"Hir,\" (tall) which was attached to his name.  See stanza V. note.\r\n\r\n{131e}  Lit. \"With the strength of steeds.\"\r\n\r\n{131f}  \"Ar gychwyn,\" poised, ready to fly.\r\n\r\n{132a}  Rhuvawn is celebrated in a Triad as one of the three blessed\r\nkings of the Isle of Britain.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri gwyndeyrn ynys Prydain; Rhun ab Maelgwn, Owain ab Urien, a\r\n    Rhuawn Bevr ab Dewrath Wledig.\"  (Triad xxv. third series.)\r\n\r\nIn another Triad he is recorded as one of the three imperious ones of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri trahawc ynys Prydein; Gwibei drahawc a Sawyl ben uchel a Ruuawn\r\n    Peuyr drahawc.\"  (Triad xxxiv. second series.)\r\n\r\nOther versions, however, of the same Triad, give Rhun mab Einiawn in the\r\nroom of Rhuvawn Pebyr.\r\n\r\nHe is also styled one of the three golden corpses of the Isle of Britain,\r\nbecause, when he was slain, his body was redeemed for its weight in gold.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri eurgelein ynys Prydain: Madawc mab Brwyn; Ceugant Beilliawc; a\r\n    Rhuawn Bevr, ab Gwyddnaw Garanhir; sev yu gelwid felly achaws rhoddi\r\n    eu pwys yn aur am danynt o ddwylaw au lladdes.\"  (Tr. lxxvii. third\r\n    series.)\r\n\r\nHis grave is alluded to by Hywel the son of Owain Gwynedd, about A.D.\r\n1160, in these lines;--\r\n\r\n    \"Tonn wenn orewyn a orwlych bet\r\n    Gwytua ruuawn bebyr ben teyrnet.\"  (Myv. Arch v. i. p. 277.)\r\n\r\n    The white wave, mantled with foam, bedews the grave,\r\n    The resting place of Rhuvawn Pebyr, chief of kings.\r\n\r\n{132b}  There may be some slight allusion here to the circumstance\r\nmentioned in the last Triad.\r\n\r\n{132c}  Coelvain; the stones of omen, an honorary reward.  In this stanza\r\nRhuvawn is celebrated as pious, valiant, and hospitable.\r\n\r\n{132d}  The hall (neuadd) might have been the camp itself, or it might\r\nhave been the general's tent, answering to the Roman praetorium.  Along\r\nthe extent of the Catrail there are several forts of the British people,\r\nwhich were built either on the contiguous hills, or on the neighbouring\r\nheights.  A field in the neighbourhood of Dolgelley, which exhibits clear\r\nvestiges of an ancient encampment, goes by the name of \"_Neuadd Goch_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Neuadd pob diddos.\"\r\n\r\n    Every shelter is a hall.  (Adage.)\r\n\r\n{133a}  Or, \"so great, so immense was the slaughter.\"  Another reading;\r\n\"So great, a sea of radiance was the slaughter,\" \"mor o wawr,\" in\r\nreference to the brightness of the weapons.\r\n\r\n{133b}  Morien Manawc is mentioned in the \"Dream of Rhonabwy\", as one of\r\nthe counsellors of Arthur, (p. 416.)  His grave is pointed out in the\r\nfollowing lines;--(Myv. Arch. vol. i. page 79.)\r\n\r\n    \"E Beteu ae cut gwitwal\r\n    Ny llesseint heb ymtial\r\n    Gwrien Morien a Morial.\r\n\r\n    The graves that have their mounds together,\r\n    Are theirs, who fell not unavenged,\r\n    Gwrien, Morien, and Morial.\r\n\r\nHis memory was much cherished by the mediaeval Bards, who not\r\nunfrequently compare their patrons to him.  Thus Risserdyn (1290, 1340)\r\nsays that Hywel ap Gruffydd had \"vreich Moryen,\" the arm of Morien; and\r\nhis contemporary Madawg Dwygraig eulogises Gruffydd ap Madawg as being\r\n\"ail Morien,\" a second Morien.\r\n\r\n{133c}  \"Medut,\" from \"meddu,\" to possess, or it may signify \"_drunk_,\"\r\nfrom \"meddw.\"  The kindling of the fire seems to have been for the\r\npurpose of annoying the enemy.  Perhaps the allusion to fires, which\r\noccurs so frequently in the Poem, may, in some measure, explain the burnt\r\nand calcined features of many of our old camps.\r\n\r\n{133d}  Cynon was probably the general of this camp, under whom Morien\r\nfought.\r\n\r\n{133e}  \"Welei.\"  Al. _make_.\r\n\r\n{133f}  Meaning _himself_.  Another reading of the latter part of the\r\nline would be \"with his brass armour shattered.\"\r\n\r\n{133g}  I.e. the camp occupied by the enemy, as the next line clearly\r\nindicates.\r\n\r\n{134a}  \"Noc ac escyc,\" from \"ysgog,\" to stir.  Al. \"Noe ac Eseye,\" as if\r\nthey were the names of some Saxon officers, who hurled the stone.  In\r\nthis case we should render it,\r\n\r\n    \"Noe and Eseye hurled a massive stone from the wall of the fort,\r\n    And never,\" &c.\r\n\r\nas if he were crushed beneath it.  Adopting the former reading, however,\r\nwe must observe the point of the words \"ysgyg\" and \"ysgogit,\" the one\r\nindicative of his undaunted courage, the other of his motionless state in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n    \"Marw yw--\r\n    Nid ysgyg er meddyg mwy.\"--Dr. S. Cent.\r\n\r\n    He is dead; he will stir no more for all the doctor's art.\r\n\r\n{134b}  Cyhadvan, cyd advan, a co-retreat.\r\n\r\n{134c}  Al. Teithan.\r\n\r\n{134d}  Or \"tumultuous,\" annovawc, from _an_ not and _dov_, tame, gentle,\r\nAl. \"anvonawc,\" sent, ordered.\r\n\r\n{134e}  See a description of his warlike character in the thirtieth\r\nstanza.\r\n\r\n{134f}  That is, Morien himself, who bore the epithet Mynawg or Manawg,\r\n(_high-minded_.)  See preceding stanza, note two.\r\n\r\n{134g}  \"Yn trwm,\" as a person \"seirchiawc saphwyawc--(and perhaps)\r\nelydnan,\" would necessarily be.  The bundles of combustible materials,\r\nwhich he also carried, would add to the weight of his armour, and tend to\r\nretard his movements.  Or, \"yn trwm\" may refer to the battle, as being a\r\n_pressure_, or a _sad_ affair.\r\n\r\n{135a}  Qu. Pedrawg, whose son Bedwyr was one of the three crowned chiefs\r\nof battle?\r\n\r\n{135b}  \"Varchawc\" may be coupled with \"fowys,\" indicating that the enemy\r\nfled on horseback.\r\n\r\n{135c}  \"Cylchwy,\" means a circular inclosure as well as a shield, and in\r\nthat sense it can be taken here, as showing that Morien surrounded the\r\ncamp with fire.\r\n\r\n{135d}  \"Gwyth;\" another reading gives \"gwych,\" which would have the same\r\nmeaning as \"gowychydd,\" line 296.\r\n\r\n{135e}  Whether we read \"ceinion\" or \"gleinion,\" we should have the same\r\nmeaning, viz.--\"of the saints,\" the Britons being thus distinguished from\r\nthe pagan Saxons.  Thus Llywarch Hen says of Geraint that he was\r\n\r\n    \"Gelyn i Sais, car i saint.\"\r\n\r\n    The Saxon's foe, the friend of Saints.\r\n\r\n{136a}  \"Lleithig,\" a _throne_, or _the dais of the hall_; in the latter\r\nsense it would have reference to a banquet, and perhaps \"tal\" would mean\r\nthe front or principal seat where Cynon sat.  When, however, the battle\r\ncommenced, the chieftain quitted the convivial board, and displayed the\r\nvalour of a distinguished soldier.\r\n\r\n{136b}  His first thrust being so effectual.  Al. \"were not recognised,\"\r\nhaving been so greatly mutilated.\r\n\r\n{136c}  Al. \"in the day of gallantry.\"\r\n\r\n{136d}  I.e. Elphin son of Gwyddno ab Gorvynion ab Dyvnwal Hen king of\r\nGwent.  In the early part of his life he was the patron of Taliesin, whom\r\nhe found when an infant in a leathern bag, exposed on a stake of his\r\nfather's wear.  \"When Elphin was afterwards imprisoned in the castle of\r\nDyganwy by Maelgwn Gwynedd, Taliesin by the influence of his song\r\nprocured his release.  There is a poem in the Myvyrian Archaiology,\r\nentitled the \"Consolation of Elphin,\" said to have been written by the\r\nchief of Bards.\r\n\r\nOr, more likely, because of his connection with the North, he was one of\r\nthe sons of Urien Rheged, mentioned by Llywarch Hen in the following\r\ntriplet,--\r\n\r\n    \"Pwylrai Wallawg, marchawg trin,\r\n    Er echwydd gwneuthur dyvin,\r\n    Yn erbyn cyvrysedd Elphin.\"\r\n\r\n    Gwallawg, the knight of tumult, would violently rave,\r\n    With a mind determined to try the sharpest edge,\r\n    Against the conflict of Elphin.\r\n\r\n{137a}  Probably the Epidii, in Cantyre and Argyleshire.  Al. \"Hud a\r\nphyd,\" \"The valour of the forward Elphin had recourse to wiles and\r\nstratagems.\"\r\n\r\n{138a}  Morien is probably alluded to here again, whose especial\r\ndepartment seems to have been the superintendence of the martial fire.\r\n\"Mur greit,\" to which we have given the same meaning as to \"Murgreit,\"\r\n(line 292) might, however, in connection with the rest of the verse be\r\ndifferently translated; thus \"The furze was kindled on the rampart by the\r\nardent bull of conflict,\" or \"The furze was kindled by the ardent\r\nbulwark, the bull of conflict.\"  The latter construction seems to be\r\nfavoured by a stanza in \"Cyvoesi Merddin,\" (Myvyrian Archaiology, vol. i.\r\np. 148) where Morien is styled \"mur trin,\" \"the bulwark of conflict.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Marw Morgeneu marw kyvrennin\r\n    Marw Moryen mur trin\r\n    Trymmav oed am dy adoed di Vyrdin.\"\r\n\r\n    Morgeneu dead, Kyvrenin dead,\r\n    Morien the bulwark of conflict dead;\r\n    Most sad the lingering that thou art left, O Merddin.\r\n\r\n{138b}  The meaning seems to be, that the enemies directed their attack\r\nto the part which abounded most with riches, or where the treasures were\r\ncollected, or it may refer to the banquet; \"alavvedd,\" signifying the\r\n_flowing mead_.\r\n\r\n{138c}  \"Llaes;\" al. \"lliaws,\" _numerous_.\r\n\r\n{138d}  Beli son of Benlli, a famous warrior in North Wales.  Allusion is\r\nmade to his burying place in Englynion y Beddau;--\r\n\r\n    \"Pieu y bedd yn y maes mawr,\r\n    Balch ei law ar ei lavnawr?\r\n    Bedd Beli vab Benlli gawr.\"\r\n\r\n    Who owns the grave in the great plain,\r\n    Proud his hand upon his spear?\r\n    The grave of Beli son of Benlli Gawr.

Thus e.g. a man might\r\nlegally beat his wife \"am ddymuno mevl ar varv ei gwr\"--for wishing\r\ndisgrace on the beard of her husband.  Such a treatment appears to have\r\nbeen offered to Gwydion, which made his attendant determined upon\r\navenging his cause.\r\n\r\n{140d}  \"Awyr eryr,\" a title given to him in reference to the sublime\r\ncharacter of his profession.  Gwydien, or Gwydion, was one of the three\r\nblessed astronomers of the Isle of Britain,\r\n\r\n    \"Tri gwyn Seronyddion ynys Prydain.  Idris Gawr, a Gwydion mab Don, a\r\n    Gwyn ab Nudd; a chan vaint eu gwybodau am y ser a'u hanianau a'i\r\n    hansoddau y darogenynt a chwenychid ei wybod hyd yn nydd brawd.\"\r\n    (Triad lxxxix. third series.)\r\n\r\nTwo stanzas entitled \"Cad Goddau,\" published in the Myv. Arch. vol. i. p.\r\n167, are ascribed to him.  He is reported to have been buried in Morva\r\nDinllev.  See Englynion y Beddau, (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 78.)\r\n\r\n{141a}  Gwyddwg seems to have been in the service of Gwydien.\r\n\r\n{141b}  Al. \"protect him with his spear,\" (wayw.)  The other reading\r\n(waen) is preferred on account of the rhyme.\r\n\r\n{141c}  \"Murdyn;\" it may be \"mur dyn,\" (_the bulwark of men_) as\r\ndescriptive of the character of Morien, who is elsewhere styled \"mur\r\ntrin,\" see line 382, note.\r\n\r\n{141d}  We meet in British history with several instances of female\r\nheroism; the following Triad records the names of three viragos in\r\nparticular;--\r\n\r\n    \"Tri gwrvorwyn ynys Prydain; Llewei verch Seithwedd Saidi; a Mederai\r\n    Badellvawr, a Rhorei vawr verch Usber Galed.\"  (Triad 96, third\r\n    series.)\r\n\r\nThe Englynion Beddau y Milwyr point out the graves of others,--\r\n\r\n    \"Y beteu yn y morva ys bychan ae haelwy\r\n    Y mae Sanant Syberv vun y mae Run ryvel achwy\r\n    Y mae Carwen verch Kennin y mae lledin a llywy.\"  (Myv. Arch. i. 82.)\r\n\r\n    The graves on the shore, on which but little generosity has been\r\n    bestowed,\r\n    Are those of Sanant the courteous maid, of Rhun foremost in the war,\r\n    Of Carwen daughter of Cennyn, of Lledyn and Llywy.\r\n\r\n{141e}  His character has been described before in stanza xxv.\r\n\r\n{142a}  The servant in question, for \"unben\" does not exclusively mean a\r\nmonarch, but it is applied also as a complimentary appellation like the\r\nmodern Sir, \"Ha unben! Duw a'ch noddo.\"  \"O Sir! God protect you.\"\r\n(Kilhwch and Olwen.)\r\n\r\n{142b}  Al. \"heb benn,\" a headless wolf.\r\n\r\n{142c}  It would appear as if the servant retaliated in kind upon the\r\nslayer of his mistress, who was either a wolf in disposition, or bore it\r\nas a badge; and that such a deed entitled him to bear a coat charged with\r\nfigures emblematic thereof.\r\n\r\n{142d}  \"Ysgrwydiat.\"  Al. \"Gold mailed warriors slept in death,\r\n(cysgrwyddiad) on the city walls.\"\r\n\r\n{142e}  \"Cred,\" of faith, as distinguished from the unbelieving Saxons.\r\n\r\n{142f}  \"Aerflawdd,\" nimble for slaughter.  \"There was a tribute of\r\ncarnage, nor were they long engaged in the tumult of battle.\"\r\n\r\n                                                             _Gorch Mael_.\r\n\r\n{143a}  Another version gives \"the birds of battle;\" but both doubtless\r\nrefer to the birds of prey which roved to the scene of battle, prepared\r\nto perch upon the carcases of the dead.  There is something extremely\r\nnatural and affecting in the conduct of the \"feeble man,\" as here\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n{143b}  Or, \"of fair observation:\" probably the very individual who\r\nwarded off the birds.  The Gorchan Maelderw would indicate that Syll was\r\nan incorrect transcript of _pelloid_ or _pellwyd_, which word would\r\nsupply the blank after _brwydryat_, and make the line rhyme with the\r\npreceding.  The passage would then be, \"and drove away the roving birds.\r\nTruly, Mirain,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{143c}  A river so called, which cannot now be identified, as there are\r\nseveral in the South of Scotland, which would admit of this Welsh form;\r\nsuch as, the Leith, the Lugar, &c.  Perhaps it is the same with Aber\r\nLleu, where Urien Rheged was assassinated, and Aber Llyw mentioned in the\r\n\"Elegy on Old Age\" by Llywarch Hen.\r\n\r\n{143d}  \"In the day of conflict.\"  _Gorch. Mael_.\r\n\r\n{144a}  Al. \"look.\"\r\n\r\n{144b}  \"Gwyr nod;\" this expression has two significations, it means both\r\n\"men of note\" and \"slaves.\"  The lines that follow seem to restrict it\r\nhere to the latter sense.\r\n\r\n{144c}  The word Din indicates it to have been a camp or a fort.\r\n\r\n{144d}  \"We may suppose this to refer to the property that was collected\r\nwithin the camp on the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\n{144e}  \"Dinas,\" a fortified town.  In these lines we have a graphic\r\npicture of the panic stricken state of that portion of the army in which\r\nAneurin happened to be at this particular time; and it is a fitting\r\nprelude to the account of his incarceration which he gives in the\r\nsucceeding stanza but one.  But whilst the bard exposes his own\r\nincapacity, he pays an indirect compliment to the skill and courage of\r\nGwynwydd; such a state of affairs, he seems to say, was owing to the\r\nabsence of that hero on the heights.\r\n\r\n{144f}  Meaning, perhaps, that had he himself been present, this\r\ncowardice would not have been manifested.  We may, however, render the\r\nline thus,--\"Vines are not named when they are not found,\" and regard it\r\nas a proverb intended to illustrate the truth of the foregoing\r\nstatements, viz. that no mention would have been made of such things had\r\nthey not really existed.  Truth was a necessary element of Welsh Poetry.\r\n\r\n{145a}  \"Ceny,\" i.e. cyni.  Llywarch Hen has introduced a stanza into his\r\n\"Elegy on Old Age,\" very similar in some of its expressions;\r\n\r\n    \"Adwen leverydd cyni\r\n    Vran; pan disgynai yn nghyvyrdy\r\n    Pen gwr, pan gwin a ddyly.\"\r\n\r\n{145b}  \"Talben,\" a fixed charge, or a tax.  A very natural reflection\r\nfrom the head of a family!\r\n\r\n{145c}  \"Gorddin;\" what impels or drives forward; what is posterior,\r\nultimate, or following; the rear.  (Dr. Pughe's Dict.)  It would appear\r\nfrom this that the captive was pushed along towards his prison by some\r\nperson from behind.\r\n\r\n{145d}  I.e. this treatment I despise, it is beneath my notice, I will\r\nregard it as a particle of dust under my feet.  There was a maxim in\r\nreference to a really felt trouble which said;--\r\n\r\n    \"Nid a gwaew yn ronyn.\"\r\n\r\n    Pain will not become a particle.\r\n\r\n{145e}  How true to nature this disclaimer of any peevish and revengeful\r\nfeelings when the power of fully exercising them was taken away!  And yet\r\nhis conduct, as implied in \"gorddin,\" at the same time belied such a\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n{145f}  Lit. \"my knee.\"  The prisoner here very naturally gives vent to\r\nhis feelings in reference to the racking pain which was inflicted upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n{146a}  \"_Bundat_,\" from _pwn_.  In the original the line is imperfect,\r\nthe particular part of his person that was thus pained being left\r\nunmentioned.\r\n\r\n{146b}  He here summons back his courage, and bursts into expressions of\r\ndefiance as to the irresistible freedom of his _awen_, declaring that he\r\nwould still in his dismal prison celebrate the praise of his countrymen,\r\nto the disparagement of his enemies at the battle of Cattraeth.\r\n\r\n{146c}  Lit. \"make,\" \"compose;\" [Greek word].\r\n\r\n{146d}  Perhaps this may mean no more than that Taliesin's mind was akin\r\nto his own.\r\n\r\n{146e}  The dawn of the following morning; or, it may, be the day of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n{146f}  Or we may put \"goroledd gogledd\" in apposition with \"gwr,\" and\r\nconstrue it thus,--\r\n\r\n    \"The hero, the joy of the North, effected it,\"\r\n\r\ni.e. my deliverance.  Llywarch Hen and his sons came from the North.\r\n\r\n{147a}  Lit. \"There does not walk upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\n{147b}  \"Dihafarch drud,\" the same epithets are applied to Llywarch in\r\nthe following Englyn y Clywed.--\r\n\r\n    \"A glyweisti a gant Llywarch,\r\n    Oedd henwr drud dihavarch;\r\n    Onid cyvarwydd cyvarch.\"\r\n\r\n    Didst thou hear what Llywarch sang,\r\n    The intrepid and bold old man?\r\n    Greet kindly though there be no acquaintance.\r\n\r\n{147c}  He would not submit to arbitration, which would imply an\r\ninability to assert their rights by force of arms.\r\n\r\n{147d}  Senyllt was the son of Cedig ab Dyvnwal Hen, and father of Nudd\r\nHael.  The word means seneschal, and perhaps Senyllt acted in that\r\ncharacter, and had derived his name from thence.  The term in the\r\netymological sense would be applied to Gwen.\r\n\r\n{148a}  Al. \"He bestowed his sword upon the,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{148b}  Al. \"lynwyssawr;\" \"he was a plague;\" or \"with his arm he made\r\npools of blood.\"\r\n\r\n{148c}  \"Seil,\" lit. \"foundation.\"\r\n\r\n{148d}  This seems to countenance the idea suggested in the note to line\r\n346, that the _Neuadd_ was none other than the camp itself.\r\n\r\n{148e}  \"Keingyell,\" ceingel; a hank of thread.\r\n\r\n{148f}  This was probably his sword which flashed.\r\n\r\n{148g}  Llywarch Hen's son, see note to line 272.  He was slain \"ar ryd\r\nvorlas,\" on the ford of Morlas, which, as far as its etymology is\r\nconcerned, would very well answer to the scene of the battle of\r\nCattraeth.\r\n\r\n{148h}  There is much poetic force in this line.\r\n\r\n{149a}  Perhaps _Luce_ Bay, near _Leuco_pibia.\r\n\r\n{149b}  Llywarch Hen, in his Elegy on Urien Rheged, speaks thus,--\r\n\r\n    \"Yn Aber _Lleu_ lladd Urien.\"\r\n\r\n    In Aber _Lleu_ Urien was slain.\r\n\r\n{149c}  Probably on the river _Lid_, or Liddel, on the northern borders\r\nof Cumberland.\r\n\r\n{149d}  It is not unlikely that the \"cangen Caerwys,\" formed a part of\r\nthe great fleet of Geraint, who is styled in Brut Tysilio, \"Geraint\r\nCaerwys.\"\r\n\r\n{149e}  A poetical definition of a storm in winter.\r\n\r\n{149f}  \"Rhiallu\" means also the power of a sovereign, but as it is not\r\nlikely that Aneurin would acknowledge the regal claims of the enemy, we\r\nhave thought it more consistent with the general design of the poem to\r\nadopt a construction, which shows the advantages possessed by the enemy\r\nover the natives in point of numerical strength.\r\n\r\n    \"Deg myrdd yn y rhiallu, deg rhiallu yn y vynta, a deg mynta yn y\r\n    gatyrva.\"\r\n\r\n    Ten myriads in the riallu ten times the riallu, in the mynta, ten\r\n    mynta in the catyrva.\r\n\r\n{150a}  \"Dyvu wyt,\" dyvnwydd; or according to Gorch. Mael. dyvwn, i.e.\r\nDevon, the country of Geraint ab Erbin,--\"Gwr dewr o goettir Dyvnaint.\"\r\n(Llywarch Hen.)\r\n\r\n{150b}  \"Yd wodyn,\" from _gwoddew_, purpose or design.  Al. \"foddyn,\" did\r\nthey drown.\r\n\r\n{150c}  Qu. _Carban_tium in the province of Valentia?\r\n\r\n{150d}  Dyvynawl Vrych, or Donald Brec, who is said in the Scotch\r\nChronicles to have been slain in the battle of Vraithe Cairvin, (qu. Carw\r\nvan?) by Owain king of the Britons.  He is introduced to our notice again\r\nin the Gododin.\r\n\r\n{150e}  Or, _a bolt_.\r\n\r\n{150f}  Pwyll in some of the pedigrees of Gwynvardd Dyved is said to be\r\nthe son of Argoel, or Aircol Law Hir, son of Pyr y Dwyrain; but Mr.\r\nDavies in the \"Rites and Mythology of the Druids,\" states that he was the\r\nson of Meirig, son of Aircol, son of Pyr, which is rather confirmed by\r\nsome other MS. Pedigrees.  In Taliesin's \"Preiddeu Annwn,\" he is\r\nmentioned, with his son Pryderi, as having joined Arthur in some perilous\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\n    \"Bu cywair carchar Gwair ynghaer Sidi\r\n    Trwy ebostol Pwyll a Phryderi.\" &c.\r\n\r\n    Arranged was the prison of Gwair in Caer Sidi\r\n    By the ministration of Pwyll and Pryderi. &c.  (Myv. Arch. i. 45.)\r\n\r\nPwyll is the hero of one of the Mabinogion.\r\n\r\n{151a}  Brwys; \"of fine growth,\" \"large.\"\r\n\r\n{151b}  Llywarch Hen speaks of a person of this name.\r\n\r\n    \"Tywarchen Ercal ar ar dywal\r\n    Wyr, o edwedd Morial;\r\n    A gwedy Rhys mae rhysonial.\"  (Elegy on Cynddylan.)\r\n\r\n    The sod of Ercal is on the ashes of fierce\r\n    Men, of the progeny of Morial;\r\n    And after Rhys there is great murmuring of woe.\r\n\r\n{151c}  Al. \"from the place where he was once overtaken.\"\r\n\r\n{151d}  This stanza evidently contains a reproof to one of the British\r\nchiefs, who turned coward on the field of battle.  The circumstances\r\nmentioned in the two first lines, that his shield was pierced behind him,\r\n\"ar grymal carnwyd,\" (on the crupper of his horse) would indicate that he\r\nwas then in the act of fleeing, holding his shield in such a position, as\r\nbest to protect his back from the darts of his pursuers.  Of this the\r\nBard remarks \"ni mad,\" it was not honourable, \"non bene.\"\r\n\r\n{152a}  Lit. \"placed his thigh on.\"  Llywarch Hen gives quite a different\r\naccount of his own son Pyll;--\r\n\r\n    \"Mad ddodes ei vorddwyd dros obell\r\n    Ei orwydd, o wng ac o bell.\"  (On Old Age.)\r\n\r\n    Gracefully he placed his thigh over the saddle\r\n    Of his steed, on the near and farther side.\r\n\r\n{152b}  We may suppose that the Bard looks upon the dark hue of his\r\naccoutrements as ominous of a mournful and dishonourable result.\r\n\r\n{152c}  A sarcastic irony addressed to the coward himself, who probably\r\nhad boasted of some heroic deeds that he would perform.  Where are they?\r\nAnd where is this brave warrior?  Not distinguishing himself on the field\r\nof battle; not entering cities in triumph; but in a cell gnawing the\r\nshoulder of a buck.\r\n\r\n{152d}  \"Gell.\"  This word has a reference to \"gell,\" _dark_, and it may\r\nbe that Aneurin regarded the one as typical of the other; that he thought\r\nthe man who appeared in dark armour would eventually be found in a dark\r\ncellar.  It is not clear whether this person secreted himself, or whether\r\nhe was placed by his enemies in the \"cell\" here mentioned.  If the\r\nformer, we may regard his eating the venison as a further proof of his\r\nunwarlike character; if the latter, \"cnoi angell bwch\" may be considered\r\nas something tantamount to living upon bread and water in our days.\r\n\r\n{152e}  Al. \"hwch,\" a sow.\r\n\r\n{152f}  Al. \"May triumph be far from his hand.\"\r\n\r\n{153a}  See line 468.  It may be inferred from this place that the person\r\njust spoken of had abandoned Gwen, which shows his character in still\r\nblacker colours.\r\n\r\n{153b}  See line 404.  O shame upon the nameless knight, to flee where a\r\nwoman fought!\r\n\r\n{153c}  \"Dibennor;\" this word may signify either the rabble who were not\r\ninvested with military accoutrements, or such as had no regular\r\ncommander, or the infantry as distinguished from the cavalry mentioned in\r\nthe succeeding line.  Though so many were ready to attack the Saxons, the\r\ncircumstance could not inspire our hero(!) with any corresponding amount\r\nof patriotic feelings.\r\n\r\n{153d}  \"It is well that Adonwy came, that Adonwy came to the defence of\r\nthose that were left;\r\nBradwen fought, slaughtered, and burned;\r\nThou didst not guard either the extremity or the entrance\r\nOf the towering town; thy helmet did I not behold from the sea,\r\nFrom the rampart of the sea, O thou knight worse than a slave.\"\r\n\r\n                                                            _Gorch. Mael_.\r\n\r\n{154a}  This stanza refers to a conference, to which the Cymry were at\r\nlength fain to submit.\r\n\r\n{154b}  _Trimuntium_, belonging to the Selgovae, in Valentia.  Al. \"The\r\ndales beyond the ridges that were cultivated.\"\r\n\r\n{154c}  \"Gwas,\" which means also youth.  It is probable that the\r\nmessenger or herald of the Saxons is here meant, who being of an\r\navaricious mind made exorbitant demands, was \"heb ymwyd,\" could not keep\r\nhis \"gwyd,\" his inclinations or desires, within his own breast.  Nor was\r\nAneurin on the other hand willing that his countrymen should make\r\nconcessions; rather than that, he calls upon them to put forth their\r\nstrength once more, and assert their rights on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n{154d}  Aneurin, addressing his country.\r\n\r\n{154e}  Al. \"Plentiful.\"\r\n\r\n{154f}  Llancarvan in Glamorganshire was anciently called by this name.\r\nAl. \"tan veithin;\" qu. tan eithin, gorze fire?\r\n\r\n{154g}  \"Luthvin,\" (glwth vin.)  Al. \"the edge of his sword gleamed.\"\r\n\r\n{154h}  The Saxon herald.\r\n\r\n{154i}  \"Gnaws gwan,\" him, who was necessarily in a weak or defenceless\r\nstate, namely the British herald.\r\n\r\n{154j}  By the \"bulwark of toil\" is probably understood Morien.\r\n\r\n{155a}  Being like him a Bard.\r\n\r\n{155b}  \"Cynrennin.\"  Al. \"expert.\"  The conference having been so\r\negregiously violated by the assassination of the British herald, is\r\nimmediately broken up, and the advice of Aneurin eagerly followed.\r\n\r\n{155c}  Their loquacity and haste had been greatly excited by liquor.\r\n\r\n{155d}  See Notes to stanza xxxviii.\r\n\r\n{155e}  The treacherous herald before mentioned.\r\n\r\n{156a}  Another way of construing these two lines would be,--\r\n\r\n    \"Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be heard of;\r\n    The bright wave murmured along on its pilgrimage;\"\r\n\r\nin reference to the British heroes.\r\n\r\n{156b}  According to version 4,--\r\n\r\n    \"Where they had collected together the most melodious deer.\"\r\n\r\nThe deer were collected within the encampment for the purpose of\r\nsupplying the army with food, or so as to be out of the reach of the\r\nenemy.  The locality was probably that of Ban Carw, the Deer Bank.\r\n\r\n{156c}  Dyvynawl Brych.\r\n\r\n{156d}  I.e. no pacific insignia.\r\n\r\n{156e}  A moral reflection suggested by the perfidy of the Saxons at the\r\nconference of Llanveithin.\r\n\r\n{156f}  Morial is recorded in one of the Englynion y Beddau, (see line\r\n348, note 2) as one who fell not unavenged.  His name occurs in one of\r\nLlywarch Hen's poems, (see line 495. note 2.)  Meugant gives an account\r\nof the expedition of one Morial to Caer Lwydgoed (Lincoln) from whence he\r\nbrought a booty of 1500 bullocks.\r\n\r\n{156g}  Or, \"mutually sharing\" the toils of war.\r\n\r\n{157a}  These two lines may be translated in reference to the Saxon\r\nherald;\r\n\r\n    \"The stranger with the crimson robe pursued,\r\n    And slaughtered with axes and blades.\"\r\n\r\n{157b}  \"Cywrein.\"  Al. \"The warriors arose, met together, and with one\r\naccord,\" &c.\r\n\r\n{157c}  Or, \"made the assault.\"\r\n\r\n{157d}  Or, simply, \"women.\"\r\n\r\n{157e}  \"Gwich,\" a shriek; Al. \"acted bravely.\"  Al. \"were greatly\r\nexasperated;\" or perhaps for \"gwyth\" we should read _gweddw_, \"their\r\nwives they made widows.\"  Gruffydd ap yr Ynad Coch in his Elegy upon\r\nLlywelyn, (Myv. Arch. i. 396) makes use of similar sentiments, in the\r\nfollowing lines,--\r\n\r\n    Llawer deigr hylithr yn hwylaw ar rudd\r\n    Llawer ystlys rhudd a rhwyg arnaw\r\n    Llawer gwaed am draed wedi ymdreiddiaw\r\n    Llawer gweddw a gwaedd y amdanaw\r\n    Llawer meddwl trwm yn tomrwyaw.\r\n    Llawer mam heb dad gwedi ei adaw\r\n    Llawer hendref fraith gwedi llwybrgodaith\r\n    A llawer diffaith drwy anrhaith draw\r\n    Llawer llef druan fal ban fu'r Gamlan.\r\n\r\n    Many a slippery tear sails down the cheek,\r\n    Many a wounded side is red with gore,\r\n    Many a foot is bathed in blood,\r\n    Many a widow raises the mournful shriek,\r\n    Many a mind is heavily troubled,\r\n    Many a son is left without a father,\r\n    Many an old grey town is deserted,\r\n    Many are ruined by yonder deed of war,\r\n    Many a cry of misery arises as erst on Camlan field.\r\n\r\n{158a}  Al. \"Nor was there a hero (lew from glew)\" &c.  Al. \"Nor was\r\nthere a lion so generous, in the presence of a lion of the greatest\r\ncourse;\" the latter description referring to some other chief of renown.\r\n\r\n{158b}  Or the _cry_, \"dias;\" being either the shout of battle, or the\r\nvoice of distress.\r\n\r\n{158c}  \"Angor,\" from _ang_ and _gor_; lit. a _staying round_, which\r\nindicates the city in question to have been of a circular form.  Probably\r\nit was one of the forts which are so commonly seen on our hills.\r\n\r\n{158d}  That is, either the place where Bards were entertained, or where\r\nthe deer were protected.  See line 535.\r\n\r\n{159a}  \"Gwryd,\" _manliness_, as displayed in war.\r\n\r\n{159b}  I.e. Cynon.\r\n\r\n{159c}  Or, \"wide.\"\r\n\r\n{159d}  A similar expression has been used before (line 512) \"nac eithaf\r\nna chynor.\"  A \"clod heb or heb eithaf,\" simply means immortal praise.\r\n\r\n{159e}  The distinguishing feature of this stanza is its prosopopaeia, or\r\nits change of things into persons, as in the case of Hwrreith, Buddugre,\r\nand Rheiddyn, which are translated respectively Spoliation, Victory, and\r\nthe Lance.\r\n\r\n{159f}  Eidol or Eidiol Gadarn is recorded as one of the three strong men\r\nof Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons\r\nwith a billet of wood.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri Gyrddion Ynys Prydain; Gwrnerth Ergydlym, a laddes yr arth mwyaf\r\n    ac a welwyd erioed a saeth wellten; a Gwgawn Lawgadarn, a dreiglis\r\n    maen Maenarch or glynn i ben y mynydd, ac nid oedd llai na thrugain\r\n    ych ai tynnai; ac Eidiol Gadarn, a laddes o'r Saeson ym mrad\r\n    Caersallawg chwechant a thrugain a chogail gerdin o fachlud haul yd\r\n    yn nhywyll.\"  (Triad 60. third series.)\r\n\r\nThe time here specified \"from sunset until dark,\" will not be found to\r\ntally at all with the commencement of the fight at Cattraeth, which is\r\nsaid to have been \"with the day,\" and \"with the dawn;\" this circumstance\r\nis fatal to Davies's theory.\r\n\r\nThe first lines of this stanza may be translated in divers ways, such\r\nas,--\r\n\r\n    \"With a feast of wine and a banquet of mead, endowed\r\n    By Cynlaith, mother of Hwrraith, was the energetic Eidol.\"\r\n\r\nAlso,--\r\n\r\n    \"With a feast of wine and a banquet of mead,\r\n    Did his brave (_hwrraith_ from _hwrdd_) mother\r\n    Cynlaith, enrich\r\n    The energetic Eidol.\"\r\n\r\nAgain,--\r\n\r\n    \"With a feast of wine and a banquet of mead,\r\n    Did his mother Hwrraith\r\n    At the first fall of the dew (_cyn llaith_) enrich\r\n    The energetic Eidol.\"\r\n\r\n{160a}  The hill on which the vanguard was stationed.\r\n\r\n{160b}  Waiting their prey.\r\n\r\n{160c}  \"Cynydaw\" (cnydiaw) to yield a crop.  Cynydaw means also to rise;\r\nand we may thus construe the passage,--\r\n\r\n    \"The foremost spearmen spring up around him.\"\r\n\r\nAnother reading gives \"cwydaw\" to fall, in allusion to the slaughter of\r\nthe men; adopting this expression, it would seem that \"arnaw\" was more\r\napplicable to \"racvre,\" the mount of the van.\r\n\r\n{160d}  \"Glas heid,\" (glas haidd) green barley.  It is rather singular\r\nthat the words, without the slightest alteration, will admit of another\r\nsimile equally beautiful and appropriate, viz.--_glas haid_, a blue swarm\r\nof flies.  The word _glas_ may be indicative of the prevailing colour of\r\nthe dress or armour of the men,\r\n\r\n    \"As from the rocky cliff the shepherd sees\r\n    Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,\r\n    Rolling, and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,\r\n    With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;\r\n    Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,\r\n    And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.\"  (Pope's Homer, b. ii.\r\n    l. 111.)\r\n\r\n{161a}  \"Hedin;\" this word seems of kindred nature with haidd (barley)\r\nand is here translated accordingly; (hedeg, to shoot out, or to ear, as\r\ncorn.)  Another version gives \"hediw,\" (_heddyw_, today.)\r\n\r\n{161b}  It is still very common in Wales to call the cause or origin of\r\nany thing by the name of mam: thus, for instance, we say \"mam y drwg\" of\r\nthe chief instigator of mischief.  What we are to understand by the\r\n\"mother of the lance\" it is not very easy to determine; it might have\r\nbeen courage or the sense of wrong, or quarrel, or any other cause which\r\nexcited the Britons to fight.\r\n\r\n{161c}  Al. \"They marched and chanted, clad in coat of mail.\"\r\n\r\n{162a}  \"Vawr dru,\" &c.  Al. \"miserable hero.\"\r\n\r\n{162b}  This confirms the view we have taken of the \"milcant a thrychant\"\r\nat line 86.\r\n\r\n{162c}  \"Gloew dull;\" in bright array.  It may refer also to the viands.\r\n\r\n{162d}  \"Mai;\" Taliesin, in like manner, says of Urien, that he was,--\r\n\r\n    \"Un yn darwedd\r\n    Gwin a mal a medd.\"\r\n\r\n    One who was generous of wine, and bounty, and mead.\r\n\r\n\"Mal,\" properly speaking, seems to have been a certain tribute, as above.\r\nThus we read in Welsh legends;--\r\n\r\n    \"He gave his domain of Clynog to God and to Beuno for ever, without\r\n    either contribution or tax (heb na mal nac ardreth.\")  (Buch. Beuno.)\r\n\r\nAgain,--\r\n\r\n    \"There is neither contribution nor tax, (na mal na threth) which we\r\n    ought to pay.\"  (H. Car. Mag.  Mabinogion.)\r\n\r\nThe word in the text may signify gifts or presents; or it may mean\r\n_meal_, (mal, what is ground) in allusion to the more substantial portion\r\nof the feast.\r\n\r\n{163a}  Lit. \"I am being ruined.\"\r\n\r\n{163b}  Mynyddawg himself.\r\n\r\n{163c}  Al. \"From amongst.\"\r\n\r\n{163d}  That is, free and precipitate in his course, as a ball flies\r\nthrough the air.  This simile seems to have been borrowed from a popular\r\ngame among the Britons called _pelre_, which consisted in the beating of\r\na ball backwards and forwards, and is alluded to by Taliesin in the\r\nfollowing lines;\r\n\r\n    \"Ceiniadon moch clywid eu govalon:\r\n    Marchawglu mor daer am Gaer Llion;\r\n    A dial Idwal ar Aranwynion\r\n    A gware pelre a phen Saeson.\"  (Myv. Arch. i. p. 73.)\r\n\r\n    Songsters, soon would their cares be heard;\r\n    An army of horsemen so harassing round Caer Llion;\r\n    And the revenge of Idwal on the Aranwynians;\r\n    And the playing of ball-buffetting with Saxon heads.\r\n\r\nAl. \"mab Pel;\" Present the son of Pel.\r\n\r\n{163e}  \"Hud:\" has this word any reference to \"_hud_wg,\" a racket for\r\nball playing?\r\n\r\n{164a}  \"Ystryng;\" from _ys_ and _tryng_ or _trengu_.\r\n\r\n{164b}  \"Adan;\" that is _a dan_, will go under.  Lit. \"under the\r\nred-stained warriors go the steeds,\" &c.  \"Ymdan march,\" is a well known\r\nphrase for mounting a horse.\r\n\r\n{164c}  The same, it may be, with Angar, one of the sons of Caw of Cwm\r\nCawlwyd, and brother of Aneurin.  A saying of his occurs in the\r\nChwedlau'r Doethion.  (Iolo MSS. pp. 256, 554.)\r\n\r\n    \"A glyweist ti chwedl Angar\r\n    Mab Caw, Catfilwr clodgar?\r\n    Bid tonn calon gan alar.\"\r\n\r\n    Hast thou heard the saying of Angar,\r\n    Son of Caw the celebrated warrior?\r\n    The heart will break with grief.\r\n\r\n{164d}  \"Raen,\" from _rha_, which is also the root of _rhain_, spears.\r\n\r\n{164e}  This passage, in another form, occurs three times in the Maelderw\r\nversion and may be translated as follows;\r\n\r\n    \"Angor, thou scatterer of the brave,\r\n    Serpent, piercing pike,\r\n    And immovable stone in the front of the army.\"\r\n\r\n{164f}  Al. \"Oppressor, dressed in thy shining white robes.\"\r\n\r\n{165a}  \"Gwaenawr.\"  Al. \"The spears.\"  Al. \"The stones.\"\r\n\r\n{165b}  That is, the fosse of the Catrail, or that which surrounded one\r\nof the camps.\r\n\r\n{165c}  See lines 386, 524, 534.  Al. \"like ploughing the furrow.\"\r\n\r\n{165d}  The Bard in this stanza evidently plays upon the names of three\r\nof the British heroes, showing how appropriately they represented their\r\nrespective characters; _Cywir_, _enwir_; _Merin_, _mur_; _Madien_, _mad_.\r\nPerhaps it would be better to transpose the two first, and read the line\r\nas it occurs in one stanza of the Gorchan Maelderw;\r\n\r\n    \"Enwir ith elwir oth gywir weithred.\"\r\n    Enwir art thou named from thy righteous deed;\r\n\r\nfor in \"Kilhwch and Olwen\" we meet with a person bearing the name of\r\nGweir Gwrhyd _Ennwir_, who is said to have been an uncle of Arthur, his\r\nmother's brother.\r\n\r\n{165e}  \"Bulwark of every tribe.\"  Al. \"of every language.\"  _Gorch.\r\nMaelderw_.\r\n\r\n{165f}  Merin the son of Merini ab Seithenyn, king of the plain of\r\nGwyddno, whose land was overflowed by the sea.  He is said to have been\r\nthe founder of the church of Llanverin, or Llanvetherin, Monmouthshire.\r\nIn the Gorchan Maelderw Merin is called the son of Madieith.\r\n\r\n{166a}  Al. \"Gwynedd.\"\r\n\r\n{166b}  I.e. the drinking horn.  \"Dial;\" _Gorch. Mael_. \"to take\r\nvengeance for the contribution of mead.\"  Owain Cyveiliog alludes to this\r\ncircumstance in his Poem on the Hirlas Horn;--\r\n\r\n    \"Kigleu am dal met myned dreig Kattraeth.\"  (Myv. Arch. i. 266.)\r\n\r\nThat this author was acquainted with the Gododin appears further from the\r\nfollowing,\r\n\r\n    \"Nid ym hyn dihyll nam hen deheu;\"\r\n\r\nwhere he evidently refers to line 290 of our Poem.\r\n\r\n{166c}  \"Cyvyringet,\" those who met together between the two armies; from\r\ncyvrwng, cyd-rhwng.\r\n\r\n{166d}  \"Cibno ced,\" seems to have been the cup of drink presented to\r\nbards and minstrels by their entertainers.  (See line 345.)  Not even the\r\nspeech inspiring influence of this cup, could elicit an adequate\r\ndescription of the slaughter which ensued at Cattraeth.\r\n\r\n{167a}  Or, \"the gallantry of the glorious knight of conflict.\"\r\n\r\n{167b}  Lit. \"Ruddy reaping.\"  Al. \"Ruddy reaper, thou pantest for war.\"\r\n\r\n{167c}  Al. \"Thou man of Gwynedd.\"\r\n\r\n{167d}  Lit. \"Thou unmanest;\" di-mwng.\r\n\r\n{167e}  \"Llain.\"  Al. \"lance.\"\r\n\r\n{167f}  The expression \"until blood flows\" is not in the original.\r\n\r\n{167g}  That glass vessels were used by the Britons in the sixth century\r\nis further proved by the testimony of Llywarch Hen, who speaks of\r\n\r\n    \"Gwyr ni giliynt rhag ovn gwayw,\r\n    Ac yved gwin o wydr gloyw.\"  (Elegy upon Geraint)\r\n\r\n    Men who would not flinch from the dread of the spear,\r\n    And the quaffing of wine out of the bright glass.\r\n\r\n{168a}  \"Ariant,\" money contributed towards any thing; thus \"ariant\r\ncwynos,\" supper money, was paid by the gentry and freeholders towards the\r\nmaintenance of the officers of the court; \"ariant gwastrodion,\" money of\r\nthe equerries, was paid by the king's tenants in villainage once a year,\r\nto furnish provender for his horses; \"ariant am y vedd\" would likewise be\r\na contribution paid towards a banquet of mead.  Gwaednerth made his\r\nenemies, as it were, pay him this tribute with the gold of their armour.\r\n\r\n{168b}  His history is unknown.\r\n\r\n{168c}  Or, \"retinue.\"\r\n\r\n{168d}  \"Dyrraith;\" law of fate; death,\r\n\r\n{168e}  Probably Ayr in Scotland, rather than Aeron in Wales.\r\n\r\n{168f}  Lit. \"the head.\"\r\n\r\n{168g}  I.e. the Clyde.  Al. \"The brown eagles.\"  Llywarch Hen speaks of\r\n\"the brown eagles\" (eryron llwyd) and of \"the eagle with the brown beak,\"\r\n(eryr pengarn llwyd.)\r\n\r\n{169a}  Lit. \"Without reproach.\"\r\n\r\n{169b}  Or, \"From the region.\"\r\n\r\n{169c}  Al. \"Men of privilege.\"\r\n\r\n{169d}  \"Llogell;\" a receptacle, a depository, a closet.  It might here\r\nrefer more particularly to the room which contained the viands.\r\n\"Llogail\" would be a wattled room.\r\n\r\n{169e}  The frequent repetition of the word \"byd\" in this stanza is\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\n{169f}  Lit. \"not without ambition.\"\r\n\r\n{169g}  Eidol is specified by name as being the most indefatigable in his\r\npursuit after mirth.  A person of that name and character is mentioned in\r\na poem attributed to Cuhelyn.  See Myv. Arch. i. 164.\r\n\r\n{169h}  Or, \"the grandson of Enovant.\"  Al. \"One out of a hundred,\"\r\nCynddilig might have been the son of Cor Cnud, whose grave is recorded in\r\nthe Englynion y Beddau.  (Myv. Arch. i. 11.)\r\n\r\n    \"Kian a ud diffaith cnud.\r\n    Draw o tuch pen bet alltud\r\n    Bet Cindilic mab Corknud.\"\r\n\r\nOr the son of Nwython, mentioned in the Bruts, (Myv. Arch. ii. 321) and\r\nGenealogy of the Saints.  (Iolo MSS. 137.)  Or else he might have been\r\nthe son of Llywarch Hen,--\r\n\r\n    \"Och Cynddilig, na buost wraig!\"\r\n    Oh, Cynddilig, why wert thou not a woman!\r\n\r\n                                                       (Elegy on Old Age.)\r\n\r\nThe mention made of Aeron in the foregoing stanza naturally led the Bard\r\nto speak in this of a chieftain connected therewith.\r\n\r\n{170a}  Were it not for the anachronism we should be induced to regard\r\nthis lady as none other than Elen the daughter of Eudav, prince of Erging\r\nand Euas, and wife of Macsen Wledig; heroine also of a Romance entitled\r\n\"The Dream of Macsen Wledig.\"  As Macsen, however, is known to have been\r\nput to death as early as the year 388, Elen's life could not possibly\r\nhave been so protracted as to enable her to take a part in the battle of\r\nCattraeth.\r\n\r\n{170b}  \"Dieis.\"  Al. \"her thrusts were penetrating.\"\r\n\r\n{171a}  \"Meiwyr,\" men of the field.  Al. \"Meinir,\" the slender maid,\r\nwhich might refer to the daughter of Eudav.\r\n\r\n{171b}  The Gorchan Maelderw clearly indicates that the fire was kindled\r\nin the presence of the army, and not for religious purposes before the\r\nDeity.\r\n\r\n{171c}  This stanza explains the expression used in line 116.  Seven\r\ndays, then, we may suppose, formed the whole space of time during which\r\nthe events related in the Gododin occurred.  The action of Homer's Iliad\r\noccupied nearly fifty days.\r\n\r\n{171d}  The daily operations are somewhat differently stated in the\r\nfragments of the Gododin, which are appended to \"Gorchan Maelderw.\"\r\nThere they are as follows,--\r\n\r\n    \"On Tuesday they put on their splendid robes;\r\n    On Wednesday bitter was their assembly;\r\n    On Thursday messengers formed contracts;\r\n    On Friday there was slaughter;\r\n    On Saturday they dealt mutual blows;\r\n    On Sunday they were pierced by ruddy weapons;\r\n    On Monday a pool of blood knee deep was seen.\"\r\n\r\n{172a}  See lines 27, &c.  It would appear as if the three lines at the\r\nend of the stanza were appended to it by some compiler, merely on account\r\nof their uniformity of rhyme.\r\n\r\n{172b}  Lit, \"At the early arising morn,\" or \"quickly rising in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n{172c}  \"Aber;\" the junction of rivers; the fall of a lesser river into a\r\ngreater, or into the sea.  By metaphor, a port or harbour.\r\n\r\n{172d}  Or more definitely,--\"Occurred the battle of Aber in front of the\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n{172e}  Or \"a breach was made, and the knoll was pervaded with fire.\"\r\n\r\n{172f}  The stanza is imperfect, which accounts for the omission of the\r\nhero's name.  From the Gorchan Maelderw we would infer that he was Gwair\r\none of the three \"taleithiawg cad,\" or coronetted chiefs of battle.\r\n(Myv. Arch. ii. 12.)\r\n\r\n{172g}  Probably, the valuables collected within the encampment on the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n{173a}  This word may be taken either in its literal sense, as alluding\r\nto the birds of prey that devoured the dead bodies, or else\r\nmetaphorically as denoting the warriors themselves.  In the latter sense\r\nCasnodyn uses it in the following passage;\r\n\r\n    \"Cynan--\r\n    Eryr tymyr gwyr, gweilch disaesneg.\"\r\n\r\nCynan, the eagle of the land of men, who are heroes with no English.\r\n\r\nIn this sense \"gwrwnde\" would necessarily allude to the colour of the\r\nmen's habiliments.\r\n\r\n{173b}  The stanza is thus varied in Gorchan Maelderw,\r\n\r\n    \"At the early dawn of morn they marched\r\n    To conflict, headed by the king in front of the course;\r\n    Gwair was greeted by the fluid gore\r\n    In the van of the battle;\r\n    He was a beloved friend.\r\n    In the day of distress\r\n    The wealth of the mountain, the place,\r\n    And the forward beam of war, wore a murky hue.\"  (_Gorch. Mael_.)\r\n\r\n{173c}  \"Eilin;\" in a second; another reading has \"meitin,\" a word of\r\nsimilar import, signifying a space of time.\r\n\r\n{173d}  \"Aber;\" ut supra.\r\n\r\n{173e}  The Catrail, or else the vallum of our hero's camp.\r\n\r\n{173f}  That is, single handed he faces a hundred men of the enemy.\r\n\r\n{174a}  That you should have committed such a slaughter with the same\r\ncoolness and indifference, as if you were merely revelling over your\r\nmead.\r\n\r\n{174b}  \"Dynin,\" the dwarf, who had killed the British herald, contrary\r\nto the law of war.  Al, \" * * * with the edge and stroke of the sword,\r\nthe fierce warrior.\"\r\n\r\n    \"It was such a thrust to the little man.\"  (Gorch. Mael.)\r\n\r\n{174c}  \"Mor ddiachor;\" it may be also translated \"how unrestrainedly.\"\r\nThe Gorchan Maelderw has it \"mor diachar,\" _how unamiably_, which seems\r\nto be required by the rhythmical run of the passage;\r\n\r\n    \"Oed mor diachar\r\n    Yt wanei escar.\"\r\n\r\n{174d}  It is not quite clear whether this person be the same with the\r\none mentioned in stanza lli. or whether another event, of a similar\r\ncharacter with that described therein, be not here introduced.  We are\r\ninclined, however, to consider both passages as referring to the same act\r\nof treachery.\r\n\r\n{174e}  Probably from the top of the rampart.\r\n\r\n{174f}  \"Cynyt,\" (cynnud) fire wood.  The bushes growing out of the sides\r\nof the vallum checked not his fall.  Al. \"Cywydd,\" his song; though this\r\nword derived from _cy_ and _gwydd_, may likewise have the same meaning as\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n{174g}  \"Cywrenhin,\" (cywreinin) accurate, elaborate; well formed,\r\nhandsome.  If it may be taken actively, the meaning in this place would\r\nbe skilful or talented, which epithet would apply well to him as a bard.\r\n\r\n{175a}  It will be recollected that the \"gorgeous pilgrim,\" (line 534)\r\nbroke down the encampment; on the supposition, then, that he was\r\nidentical with the \"foe\" mentioned in the last stanza, we may imagine him\r\nencountering Owain with his badge of truce at the very breach he was\r\nmaking, and that he then and there put him to death.  It is not\r\nimpossible, however, but that Owain was another herald who renewed the\r\noffer of peace, after the death of the \"delight of the bulwark of toil,\"\r\nand that both were dishonourably slain by the same perfidious messenger.\r\n\r\n{175b}  That is, he was entitled in right of his office, as herald, to\r\nevery protection and safety, whilst engaged in proposing terms of peace.\r\n\r\n{175c}  Lit. \"The best branch.\"  \"The wand denotes privilege.\"  See Iolo\r\nMSS. p. 634.\r\n\r\n{175d}  Lit. \"due.\"\r\n\r\n{175e}  \"Three things are forbidden to a bard; immorality, to satirize,\r\nand to _bear arms_.\"  (Institutional Triads.)\r\n\r\n{175f}  Quasi dicat, \"did not wear one.\"\r\n\r\n{176a}  That is, avenge his death.  There is a reference here to the\r\ncustom of distributing gifts out of a coffer, suggested by the similarity\r\nbetween the expressions \"pridd prenial,\" the earthly shrine or coffin,\r\nand \"prid prenial,\" the price chest.\r\n\r\n{176b}  \"Barn ben\" might have the sense of _adjudged to lose her head_,\r\ncapitis damnata; in which case the passage would be translated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"It was a violation of privilege to sentence a woman to death.\"\r\n\r\nThe other construction is, however, more especially countenanced by a\r\nsimilar expression in \"Gwasgargerdd Vyrddin\" where the meaning is\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n    \"Pan dyvo y brych cadarn\r\n    Hyt yn Rhyt Pengarn\r\n    Lliwaut gwyr treuliaut Karn\r\n    Pendevic Prydein yno _pen Barn_;\"  (Myv. Arch. i. 132.)\r\n\r\nAnd on that account is preferred here.  There is reason to think that the\r\nLady in question is the daughter of Eudav, already mentioned, upon whose\r\nmessage, as well as that of Mynyddawg, \"the gay and the illustrious\r\ntribes,\" proceeded to Cattraeth.  It is observable, as confirmatory of\r\nthis view, that Eidol was introduced into our notice before in the stanza\r\nimmediately preceding that in which she is celebrated.\r\n\r\n{176c}  \"Iaen,\" like ice.\r\n\r\n{177a}  \"Rhy,\" excessively.\r\n\r\n{177b}  \"Gwlad _gordd_,\" \"_gwrdd_ werydd.\"  In the Triads Eidol is called\r\none of the three _gyrddion_ of the Isle of Britain.  (Triad, 60.)\r\n\r\n{177c}  The agricultural character of the usual employments of the early\r\nBritons in times of peace, is clearly inferred from the frequent use of\r\nthe word \"medel,\" in reference to their soldiery.\r\n\r\n{177d}  Or, \"He sounded for steeds, he sounded for harness.\"\r\n\r\n{177e}  \"_Am_ grudd;\" his cheeks all _around_.\r\n\r\n{177f}  Or, \"the ribs.\"\r\n\r\n{178a}  The Cymry were thus styled to distinguish them from the Saxons,\r\nwho were pagans.  See supra, line 365.\r\n\r\n{178b}  \"Amnant,\" from \"avn,\" boldness, courage.\r\n\r\n{178c}  \"Cell;\" a cell, a closet, a grove.  Perhaps it here means a\r\n_house_, or _habitation_ in general.\r\n\r\n{178d}  Lit. the room, or chamber.\r\n\r\n{178e}  \"Yt vyddei dyrllyddei;\" where was, where was brewed; or, \"where\r\nit was wont to brew.\"\r\n\r\n{178f}  A person of the name of \"Gwres the son of Rheged,\" is mentioned\r\nin the \"Dream of Rhonabwy,\" in conjunction with Owain ab Urien.  Gwrys\r\nseems to have been a Venedotian chief.\r\n\r\n{178g}  The Welsh poets frequently represent a man of worth, as a _ced_,\r\nor a gift.\r\n\r\n{178h}  As the Lloegrians have been shown before to be clearly amongst\r\nthe enemies of the British chiefs, (see line 547) the meaning of this\r\nsentence is, that the hero under consideration was the conqueror, or the\r\nmaster of the Lloegrians; and that he thus marshalled them against their\r\nwill.  In like manner Einion ab Gwalchmai describes Llywelyn as,--\r\n\r\n    \"Llywelyn llew glwys, Loegrwys lugyrn.\"\r\n\r\n    Llywelyn the amiable lion, the torch of the Lloegrians.\r\n\r\n{178i}  \"Attawr;\" al. \"allawr,\" the altar.

On the part of the Britons\r\nthe fire department seems to have been presided over by Morien; and\r\nindeed the title \"Mynawc,\" which we have here translated high-minded, and\r\nwhich is elsewhere connected with the name of Morien, would induce us to\r\ninfer that the Bard, in the above stanza, is presenting us once more with\r\na prospect of that hero surrounded by his own blazing engines.\r\n\r\n{179e}  \"Lluyddawg.\"  Al. \"The successful (llwyddawg) bitter-handed,\r\nhigh-minded chief;\" who may have been Llyr lluyddawg.

Doubtless a weapon resembling it,\r\nand bearing the same name.  Al. \"Syrthyn,\" \"They fell headlong with a\r\nclang.\"\r\n\r\n{180g}  We have adopted this as a proper name from its similarity to\r\nFflewddur Fflam, the name of one of the three sovereigns of Arthur's\r\ncourt, who preferred remaining with him as knights, although they had\r\nterritories and dominions of their own.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri unben Llys Arthur; Goronwy ab Echel Forddwydtwll, a Chadraith ab\r\n    Porthor Godo; a Fleidur Fflam mab Godo; sef oeddent yn Dywysogion yn\r\n    Berchennogion Gwlad a Chyfoeth, a gwell oedd ganddynt no hynny aros\r\n    yn Farchogion yn Llys Arthur, gan y bernid hynny yn bennaf ar bob\r\n    anrhydedd a bonheddigeiddrwydd, a ellid wrth ygair y Tri Chyfiawn\r\n    Farchawg.\"  (Triad, 114, third series.)\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be not a proper name, the line might be rendered,--\r\n\r\n    \"A successful warrior, flaming in steel, before the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n{181a}  \"Dinus;\" from \"din,\" a fort, and \"ysu,\" to consume.\r\n\r\n{181b}  \"Gwych.\"  Al. \"the angry.\"\r\n\r\n{181c}  Or, \"the honourable.\"\r\n\r\n{181d}  \"Echadaf,\" i.e. \"ech,\" [Greek word] ex, and \"adav,\" a hand.\r\n\r\n{181e}  A person of this name is ranked in the Triads as one of the three\r\n\"trwyddedawg hanvodawg,\" or free guests of the court of Arthur.

Al. \"penufuddawr\" having an\r\nobedient head--rein-obeying.\r\n\r\n{183d}  Al. \"The mounted spearman.\"\r\n\r\n{183e}  Another reading gives \"Odren\" but the one adopted above suits the\r\nrhyme better.\r\n\r\n{183f}  There is a reference here to some pagan ceremonies to which the\r\nSaxons had recourse, for the purpose either of propitiating their gods,\r\nor of receiving omens at their altars.\r\n\r\n{184a}  A body of British soldiers under the command of Nwython son of\r\nGildas, and nephew of Aneurin, seem to have taken advantage of the\r\npeculiar position of the enemy, who were now probably unarmed, and to\r\nhave attacked them, which caused the latter, as usual, to seek refuge by\r\nflight in one of the neighbouring forts.  That we are right in adopting\r\nNwython as a proper name would appear, moreover, from two different\r\npassages in the fragments of the Gododin subjoined to Gorchan Maelderw,\r\nwhere \"the son of Nwython,\" is distinctly mentioned as one of the heroes\r\nthat fell at Cattraeth.\r\n\r\n{184b}  Donald Brec, or as he is called in Latin, Dovenal Varius, king of\r\nthe Scots, who was slain by Owain, king of the Strathclyde Britons in the\r\nbattle of Vraithe Cairvin, otherwise Calatros, which in sound somewhat\r\nresembles Galltraeth, or Cattraeth.  It is true that the Scottish\r\nchronicles assign a much later date to that event, than the era of the\r\nGododin, nevertheless as they themselves are very inconsistent with one\r\nanother on that point, giving the different dates of 629, 642, 678 and\r\n686, it is clear that no implicit deference is due to their chronological\r\nauthority, and that we may, therefore, reasonably acquiesce in the view\r\nwhich identifies Dyvnwal Vrych, with Donald Brec, seeing the striking\r\nsimilarity which one name bears to the other.\r\n\r\n{184c}  Supposing the person who killed Donald to be the same with Owain,\r\nson of Urien, there may be here an allusion to his men as well as to the\r\nbirds of prey.  See line 18 note one.\r\n\r\n{184d}  Lit. \"The bone;\" even as it is popularly said at this day that a\r\nman who gives great support to another is his back bone.\r\n\r\n    \"Caletach wrth elyn nog asgwrn.\"\r\n\r\n    Harder to an enemy than a bone.

He is also joined with Cynvar\r\nand Urien, under the title of the three \"tarw cad\" or bulls of battle, on\r\naccount of their impetuosity in rushing upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n{187a}  \"Pen o draed;\" from head to foot.  Not, as Davies translates it,\r\n\"from the highest to the lowest,\" as is evident from a similar phrase in\r\nCynddelw, (Myv. Arch. vol. i. p. 220.)\r\n\r\n    \"Yd kwytynt pennawr penn o draed;\"\r\n\r\nwhere the word \"pennawr\" refers to one particular rank, if not to an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n{187b}  See line 344.\r\n\r\n{187c}  See line 324.\r\n\r\n{187d}  See line 335.\r\n\r\n{187e}  Lit. \"after their conflict.\"\r\n\r\n{188a}  \"Tra;\" \"whilst the gory pool continued to fill.\"\r\n\r\n{188b}  \"Erchyn;\" al. \"echyn,\" \"and slew them like a hero; they were not\r\nsaved.\"\r\n\r\n{188c}  Or, \"he darted with the spear,\" or, \"they were prostrated with\r\nthe spear.\"\r\n\r\n{188d}  \"A medd,\" with the mead.

(Triad, 101.)\r\n\r\nIn the Tale of Math Mathonwy, he is said to have been buried at Maen\r\nTyriawg, near Ffestiniog.  We may therefore presume that the Englynion y\r\nBeddau refer to the other in the following passage;\r\n\r\n    \"Yn Abergenoli y mae Bet Pryderi\r\n    Yn y terau tormeu tir.\"\r\n\r\n    In Abergenoli is the grave of Pryderi,\r\n    Where the waves beat against the shore.\r\n\r\nA saying of Pryderi has been thus recorded;--\r\n\r\n    \"Hast thou heard the saying of Pryderi,\r\n    The wisest person in counselling?\r\n    There is no wisdom like silence.\"  (Iolo MSS. p. 661.)\r\n\r\n{190a}  \"Pryderaf,\" I am anxious about; a word suggested by the name of\r\nthe chief.\r\n\r\n{190b}  A result brought about by the arrival of Pryderi's troops.\r\n\r\n{190c}  \"Have I been afflicted.\"\r\n\r\n{190d}  \"Celaig;\" from _cel_, the root also of Celtiaid and Celyddon.\r\n\r\n{190e}  There were two territories of this name, Argoed Derwennydd,\r\n(Derwent wood apparently) and Argoed Calchvynydd, \"between the river Tren\r\nand the river Tain, that is the river of London.\"  (Iolo MSS. p. 476.)\r\nOne of them, the former probably, was the patrimony of Llywarch Hen.\r\n\r\n    \"Cyn bum cain vaglawg, bum cyfes eiriawg,\r\n    Ceinvygir ni eres;\r\n    Gwyr Argoed eirioed a'm porthes.\"  (Elegy on Old Age.)\r\n\r\n    Before I appeared with crutches, I was eloquent in my complaint,\r\n    It will be extolled, what is not wonderful--\r\n    The men of Argoed have ever supported me!\r\n\r\n{191a}  \"Gwal.\"  \"The Cymmry appropriated this name to regions that were\r\ncultivated and had fixed inhabitancy, as opposed to the wilds, or the\r\nunsettled residences of the Celtiaid, Celyddon, Gwyddyl, Gwyddelod,\r\nYsgotiaid, and Ysgodogion; which are terms descriptive of such tribes as\r\nlived by hunting and tending their flocks.\"  (Dr. Pughe, sub. voce.)\r\nBoth descriptions of persons are thus included in the Bard's affectionate\r\nregret.  Al. \"accustomed at the rampart.\"\r\n\r\n{191b}  \"Pwys;\" pressure or weight.  Or perhaps \"arlwydd pwys\" means \"the\r\nlegitimate lord,\" in opposition to usurpers, just as a wedded wife is\r\nstyled \"gwraig bwys,\" as distinguished from a concubine.\r\n\r\n{191c}  \"Dilyvn;\" or perhaps \"dylyvn,\" smooth.\r\n\r\n{191d}  Al. \"rekindled.\"\r\n\r\n{191e}  \"Gosgroyw,\" rather fresh.\r\n\r\n{191f}  Geraint, the son of Erbin, was prince of Dyvnaint, (Devon) and\r\none of the three owners of fleets of the Isle of Britain, each fleet\r\nconsisting of 120 ships, and each ship being manned by 120 persons.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri Llynghesawg ynys Prydain; Geraint mab Erbin; Gwenwynwyn mab Nav;\r\n    a March mab Meirchion; a chweugain llong gan bob un o'r\r\n    Llynghesogion, a chweugain llongwyr ymhob llong.\"  (Triad 68, Third\r\n    series.)\r\n\r\nLlywarch Hen wrote an Elegy upon Geraint, in which the place of his death\r\nis thus mentioned;--\r\n\r\n    \"Yn Llongborth y llas Geraint,\r\n    Gwr dewr o goettir Dyvnaint,\r\n    Wyntwy yn lladd gyd a's lleddaint.\"\r\n\r\n    At Llongborth was Geraint slain,\r\n    A strenuous warrior from the woodland of Dyvnaint,\r\n    Slaughtering his foes as he fell.\r\n\r\nGeraint ab Erbin was the grandfather of Aneurin, but as he died in king\r\nArthur's time, A.D. 530, we can hardly identify him with the Geraint of\r\nthe text, who probably was a son, or some other relation, that had\r\ninherited his fleet.\r\n\r\n{192a}  \"Llwch gwyn,\" probably \"Vanduara,\" _Gwyn Dwr_, or White Water,\r\nwhich seems to have been one of the old designations of a river in\r\nRenfrewshire.  (See _Caledonia Romana_, p. 143.)  Adar y y llwch gwyn,\r\nthe birds of the white lake, is a mythological epithet for vultures.\r\nTheir history is recorded in the Iolo MSS. p. 600.\r\n\r\n{192b}  Al. \"There was a white badge on his shield.\"\r\n\r\n{192c}  Lit. \"his anchor.\"\r\n\r\n{192d}  \"Cyman,\" \"cydvan,\" (i.e. cyd man) the place of gathering.  Al.\r\n\"his broken anchor.\"\r\n\r\n{192e}  It is not improbable that the eagle was charged on Geraint's\r\nstandard, for it is also frequently alluded to in Llywarch Hen's\r\nElegy--e.g.\r\n\r\n    \"Oedd re redaint dan vorddwyd Geraint,\r\n    Garhirion, grawn odew,\r\n    Rhuddion, rhuthr eryron glew.\"\r\n\r\n    Under the thigh of Geraint were fleet runners,\r\n    With long hams, fattened with corn;\r\n    They were red ones; their assault was like the bold eagles.\r\n\r\n{193a}  \"Lledvegin,\" an animal partly reared in a domestic way.  We have\r\nchosen the lamb as being one of the animals most commonly reared in this\r\nmanner.  Nevertheless, a previous wildness, with reference to the\r\nmilitary aspect of his character, might be intended to be conveyed in\r\nthis epithet.\r\n\r\n    \"_Lledvegyn_ is a kine, or what shall be tamed in a house; namely,\r\n    such as a fawn, or a fox, or a wild beast similar to those.\"  (Welsh\r\n    Laws.)\r\n\r\n{193b}  \"Rhan,\" see lines 40 and 732.\r\n\r\n{193c}  Or, \"He presided over the feast, pouring from the horn the\r\nsplendid mead.\"  So Cynddelw,--\r\n\r\n    \"Baran lew llew lloegyr oual\r\n    Lleduegin gwin gwyrt uual.\"  (Myv.

He succeeded to the sovereignty of North Wales, A.D. 443, and\r\nis said to have died in 517.  There was a Cas son of Seidi, who was one\r\nof the heroes of Arthur's Court.\r\n\r\n{194b}  A hundred in the middle part of North Wales, so called from\r\nRhuvon son of Cunedda Wledig, whose inheritance it was.\r\n\r\n{194c}  Probably the enemy.\r\n\r\n{194d}  Or, \"the shout was raised.\"\r\n\r\n{194e}  Cadvorion, i.e. cad-vawrion; or, it may be, more literally,\r\ncad-vorion, \"martial ants,\" in reference to their activity.\r\n\r\n{194f}  Lit. \"warning.\"\r\n\r\n{195a}  Lit. \"prepared.\"\r\n\r\n{195b}  The popular air \"Nos Galan\" is supposed to have been a relic of\r\nthe musical entertainments of this season.\r\n\r\n{195c}  A chieftain of Mona, the land that enjoyed \"the valour of Ervei;\"\r\nsee his Elegy by Taliesin apud Myv.

Mael.)\r\n\r\n{195d}  That is, in domestic life he was as refined as a lady, modest as\r\na virgin, whilst in war he was brave and high minded.\r\n\r\n{195e}  The word \"teyrn\" reminds us of a line which countenances the\r\ntheory we suggested relative to the expression \"edyrn diedyrn,\" in stanza\r\nxv. but which we omitted to mention in its proper place.  It occurs in\r\nthe \"Elegy on Cunedda.\"  (Myv. Arch. i. p. 71) as follows;--\r\n\r\n    \"Rhag mab _edern_ cyn _edyrn_ anaelew.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Before the son of Edeyrn ere his kingdom became fearful.\"\r\n\r\n{196a}  This warrior was probably of the family of Urien Rheged, for a\r\ngrandson of his, the celebrated Kentigern, was called Cyndeyrn Garthwys.\r\nArthwys son of Ceneu ab Coel was too early for the battle of Cattraeth.\r\n\r\n{196b}  Tinogad was the son of Cynan Garwyn, and was celebrated for his\r\nswift steed, named Cethin.\r\n\r\n    \"Tri marchlwyth ynys Prydain--ar ail marchlwyth aduc Cornann March\r\n    meibion Eliffer gosgortuawr, a duc Gwrgi a Pheredur arnaw, ac nys\r\n    gordiuedawd neb namyn Dinogat vab Kynan Garwyn yar y Kethin kyvlym ac\r\n    aruidiawt ac aglot a gauas yr hynny hyd hediw.\"  (Triad 11, second\r\n    series.)\r\n\r\n{196c}  The possession of slaves, whether of native origin, or derived\r\nfrom the custom of the Romans, prevailed to some extent among the Britons\r\nof the fifth and sixth century, and seems to have denoted a certain\r\ndegree of power on the part of the owners.  Taliesin the Druid boasts\r\nthat he had received \"a host of slaves,\" (torof keith) from his royal\r\npatron Cunedda Wledig.  (Myv.

Hunting the roebuck is recognised in\r\nthe Welsh Laws; and is called one of the three cry hunts (helva ddolev.)\r\n\r\n    \"Mi adaen iwrch er nas daliwyv.\"  (Adage.)\r\n    I know a roebuck, though I may not catch him.\r\n\r\n{197d}  \"Derwenydd;\" Derventio, the river Derwent in Cumberland.\r\n\r\n{197e}  \"Llewyn a llwyvein.\"  It is difficult to ascertain the particular\r\nanimals which these terms respectively represent.  The former might\r\ndenote a young lion, a white lion, or any beast in general to whose\r\neating faculties the word _llewa_ would be applicable.  The latter might\r\nsignify any animal whose haunts were the elm forests, or whose property\r\nwas to _llyvu_ or to lick, as does a dog.  The fox being named llwynog\r\nfrom _llwyn_ a forest, and the forests in the North being chiefly of elm,\r\nit is not unlikely but that the said animal was frequently called\r\n_llwyvain_ in that part of the country when the Bard wrote, though it is\r\nnot known now by that name.  It is remarkable that both terms also\r\nsignify certain kinds of wood.  The former the herb orach, the latter the\r\nelm.\r\n\r\n{197f}  Al. \"None would escape.\"\r\n\r\n{198a}  \"Angcyvrwng;\" lit. \"were he to place me without an intervening\r\nspace,\" that is, were he to straiten me on every side.\r\n\r\n{198b}  When any thing is taken away or used, or when any thing is done,\r\nthe owner not knowing it, or without asking his leave, it is called\r\n_Anghyvarch_.  \"Anghyvarchwyr,\" extortioners.  W. Salesbury, 1 Cor. v.\r\n\r\n{198c}  Lit. \"There would not come, there would not be to me, one more\r\nformidable.\"\r\n\r\n{198d}  The head of the river Clyde in Scotland.\r\n\r\n{198e}  \"Veruarch.\"  Morach Morvran is often mentioned by the poets on\r\naccount of his celebrated banquet.\r\n\r\n    \"Cygleu yn Maelawr gawr vawr vuan,\r\n    A garw ddisgyr gwyr a gwyth erwan;\r\n    Ac ymgynnull, am drull, am dramwyan,\r\n    Mal y bu yn Mangor am ongyr dan;\r\n    Pan wnaeth dau deyrn uch cyrn cyvrdan,\r\n    Pan vu gyveddach Morach Morvran.\"\r\n\r\n    In Maelor the great, the hastening shout was heard,\r\n    And the dreadful shrieks of men with gashing wounds in pain;\r\n    And together thronging to seek a cure, round and round they strayed,\r\n    As it was in Bangor for the fire of the brunt of spears;\r\n    When over horns two princes caused discord,\r\n    While in the banquet of Morach Morvran.  (Owain Cyveiliog.)\r\n\r\n{199a}  This stanza evidently refers to the same transaction as that\r\nwhich is recorded in the lxxxth, though the details are somewhat\r\ndifferently described.\r\n\r\n{199b}  One of these, we may presume, was Dyvnwal Vrych.\r\n\r\n{199c}  The whole line may be thus translated;\r\n\r\n    \"I saw the men, who with the dawn, dug the deep pit.\"  Al. \"I saw at\r\n    dawn a great breach made in the wall at Adoen.\"\r\n\r\n{199d}  See stanza lii.\r\n\r\n{199e}  \"Yngwydd.\"\r\n\r\n{199f}  \"Yr enwyd.\"\r\n\r\n{200a}  Gwarthan the son of Dunawd by Dwywe his wife, \"who was slain by\r\nthe pagan Saxons in their wars in the north.\"  (Iolo MSS. p. 556.)\r\n\r\n{200b}  Or, \"let it be forcibly seized in one entire region.\"\r\n\r\n{200c}  An allusion to his incarceration, see lines 440, 445.\r\n\r\n{200d}  Gardith; i.e. garw deith (or teithi.)\r\n\r\n{200e}  Tithragon; i.e. teith-dragon.\r\n\r\n{200f}  A pitched battle.\r\n\r\n    \"Gwr yn gware a Lloegyrwys.\"  (Cynddelw.)\r\n    A man playing with the Lloegrians.\r\n\r\n{200g}  Or, \"did he bring and supply.\"\r\n\r\n{200h}  \"Tymyr;\" native place.\r\n\r\n{201a}  \"Dyvnuyt;\" see also stanza, xlviii.\r\n\r\n{201b}  One of the officers appointed to the command of Geraint's fleet.\r\n\r\n{201c}  This stanza, with the exception of a few words, is the same with\r\nthe lxxxix.\r\n\r\n{201d}  Or \"valiantly.\"\r\n\r\n{201e}  \"Gwelydeint,\" from \"gwelyd,\" a wound; or \"gwelyddeint,\" they took\r\nrepose in the grave.\r\n\r\n{201f}  Al. \"with the gory trappings,\" as in the other stanza.\r\n\r\n{202a}  Al. \"a dau,\" the two sons, and two haughty boars.\r\n\r\n{202b}  Al. \"riein,\" a lady.\r\n\r\n{202c}  Cilydd was the son of Celyddon Wledig, and father of Cilhwch who\r\nis the hero of an ancient dramatic tale of a singular character.\r\n\r\n{202d}  In a former stanza he is called Garthwys Hir.\r\n\r\n{202e}  \"Nod;\" is a conspicuous mark.\r\n\r\n{203a}  See stanza xl.\r\n\r\n{203b}  \"Dyli,\" condition or impulse.\r\n\r\n{203c}  \"Vracden;\" from \"brag,\" a sprouting out, and \"ten,\" stretched.\r\n\r\n{203d}  The Irish.\r\n\r\n{203e}  The inhabitants of Scotland.\r\n\r\n    \"Hon a oresgyn\r\n    Holl Loegr a Phrydyn.\"  (Taliesin.)\r\n\r\n    She will conquer\r\n    All England and Scotland.\r\n\r\n{203f}  \"Giniaw,\" from \"cyni,\" affliction.\r\n\r\n{204a}  \"Cemp,\" i.e. \"camp,\" a feat, surpassingly.\r\n\r\n{204b}  Or, \"at his side.\"\r\n\r\n{204c}  Al. \"Arreith;\" i.e. \"a rhaith;\" \"the sentence of the law was that\r\nthey should search;\" or \"the jury searched.\"  Al. \"in various directions\r\nthey searched.\"\r\n\r\n{204d}  Probably the Cantii or people of Kent.\r\n\r\n{204e}  If the stanza, however, is not properly completed here, we may\r\nassign the sigh to Gwenabwy himself, in reference probably to his father,\r\nas in the preceding stanza.",
