They and their\r\nfathers before them have grown up with, lived with, made and developed\r\nthe English pottery trade. The pot-bank and the shard ruck are, to them,\r\nas familiar, and as full of old associations, as the cowshed to the\r\ncountryman or the nets along the links to the fishing population. To them\r\nany history of the development of their industry will be welcome.\r\n\r\nBut potting is such a specialized industry, so confined to and associated\r\nwith North Staffordshire, that it is possible to study very clearly in\r\nthe case of this industry the cause of its localization, and its gradual\r\nchange from a home to a factory business. The rise of capitalism, the\r\nattempts at revolt on the part of the workers, the increase of machinery\r\nand steam power, all these can be studied very closely in the potting\r\nindustry, just because the history of the district is the history of\r\npotting and of the inhabitants’ whole lives. So that I venture to hope\r\nthat many students of history and of sociology will find such a trade\r\nhistory as this of some value in their researches.\r\n\r\nThe collector, too, may I hope find his special studies assisted by the\r\nidentification and linking together of the relationships of the old\r\nmaster-potters, of their inventions, and factory sites and dates.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago Simeon Shaw wrote a book of this nature. It had its\r\nmerits, but since then research among ancient documents, systematic\r\ncollection and excavation, the publications of the William Salt\r\nArchæological Society, and, above all, the modern work of such men as\r\nWilliam Burton and Professor Church, have made it possible to restate far\r\nmore exactly what happened, and when, to potting in North Staffordshire.\r\nMr Burton’s “History and Description of English Earthenware” and his\r\nvarious works on porcelain have been drawn upon very largely in the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\nBoth to him and to Professor Church, M. Solon and to many others,\r\nwho have given me so much personal assistance in this work, I desire\r\nto express my gratitude. I can only regret that my own contribution\r\nto original research on the subject has been confined to the Tunstall\r\nCourt Rolls, kindly lent me by Mr Sneyd, and to the MSS of my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood, now in the museum of the\r\nWedgwood firm at Etruria. Lastly I would express my indebtedness to my\r\nbrother Frank Wedgwood, who has read through the proofs and made many\r\ncorrections, such as would occur to one whose whole life has been devoted\r\nto the practice of the art of potting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Slip decorated Staffordshire ware. c. 1660                     _Page_ 14\r\n\r\n  Earliest known piece of Staffordshire salt glaze ware, 1701           32\r\n\r\n  Red china teapot, probably by Elers. c. 1760                          36\r\n\r\n  Sample of later date, with moulded spout                              36\r\n\r\n  Samples of solid agate ware, made by Wedgwood or Weildon. c. 1760     36\r\n\r\n  Salt glaze teapot, drab body, supposed to be by Thomas Wedgwood,\r\n    died 1737                                                           54\r\n\r\n  Burslem in 1750 (map)                                                 60\r\n\r\n  Scratched blue salt glaze cup, dated 1750                             68\r\n\r\n  Enamelled salt glaze jug, probably by Baddeley of Shelton, dated\r\n                                                           1760         70\r\n\r\n  Staffordshire figures decorated with Weildon glaze, probably by\r\n    Wedgwood, c. 1760                                                   79\r\n\r\n  Etruria Works                                                         83\r\n\r\n  J.

W. T. Copeland, M.P.                                            178\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE CREATION OF THE POTTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no country is there a district so utterly associated with one trade as\r\nis the North Staffordshire Potteries. One even speaks of the Potteries\r\nin the singular as of a pure place-name. If you spoke in Timbuctoo or\r\nCalifornia of the Potteries, none could doubt that you were thinking of\r\nNorth Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nThe reason is not that the district is or ever was given over entirely\r\nto pot-banks. Potting was incidental, a pastime in the middle of\r\nagriculture; as potting grew, so coal and iron mining grew too. The\r\ndistrict is less confined to potting than Walsall to saddlery or\r\nSheffield to knives. Even a thirteenth century reference to Walsall will\r\nexpose harness; it is difficult to trace pots in the Potteries before\r\n1650; you find only bloom-smithies and sea-coal mines. Potting is neither\r\nso ancient here, nor so exclusive as to have made the name. The real\r\nreason of the place-name, the Potteries, is that no man who valued time\r\ncould say Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke and Longton, whenever he\r\nwanted to refer to one place—the place where men made pots—and few people\r\noutside the five towns ever wanted to speak of them separately, or could\r\neven distinguish one from others.\r\n\r\nThe first reference to “the Potteries” will be found in the latter half\r\nof the eighteenth century; before that time it was hardly necessary to\r\nrefer to them at all.\r\n\r\nThe area where pots were made in North Staffordshire has always been\r\npeculiarly local and circumscribed. It extends, and extended, in a line\r\nfrom Golden Hill to Meir Lane End. Occasionally, at times, we hear of\r\nPot-works at Red—or Ridge—Street, at Bagnal or at Bucknall, outside this\r\nnarrow area. They only receded finally from Chesterton during the last\r\ncentury. But, generally speaking, Staffordshire potters have persisted\r\nalways in making pots just where their fathers made them before, in the\r\nhilly land between the Foulhay Brook and the sources of the Trent.\r\n\r\nThere was no need in old times for the people who made pots to\r\nspecialize in one district. The art of potting is as old and as\r\nuniversal as the art of cooking. In old times it was as simple. Like\r\nmost modern trades it was practised at first, and anywhere, as a\r\nbranch of housekeeping. Every family made what pots they required for\r\ntheir kitchen, and one can see such rude earthenware utensils among\r\nthe miscellanea of any excavation. And like most modern trades the\r\ndevelopment from the housekeeping to the manufacturing stage meant\r\nspecialization in particular districts.\r\n\r\nBut why should potting have settled in the Potteries?\r\n\r\nSo long as all that was wanted was clay and firewood, almost any place\r\nwould do. In England, it was about the year 1600 that the time arrived\r\nwhen brushwood became rare and costly; clay and coal were then found\r\nto be the necessaries of a “potteries.” North Staffordshire had both.\r\nBurslem, and it is Burslem alone which one need consider in this problem\r\nof the first cause, had something more than clay and coal. The land was\r\nsplit up into a great number of small copyhold owners, and immediately\r\nafter 1600 the copyholds were enfranchised. There were no demesne\r\nlands. The people were independent, both of big farmers and of great\r\nlandlords. There was security of tenure, and every opportunity for\r\ninitiative—initiative which could not then take the shape of intensive\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nSo we find in Burslem and Tunstall at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury clay, coal and the opportunity. By the end of that century\r\nthe next requisite was to hand—skilled workmen. By the end of the\r\nnext century the last requisite of trade was in place—the cheap water\r\ntransport of the Trent and Mersey Canal.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the safest way to test the presence in early\r\ndays of particular trades or forms of employment is to study any local\r\nlists of the surnames of common people of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. We find our first such list for the Manor of Tunstall (which\r\nincluded Burslem) in 1299.[1] Not a single name that one can associate\r\nwith potting is to be found. A similar list for Audley of the same date\r\nshows a Robert le Pottere, Thomas Potinger and Richard le Throware.\r\nProbably most similar lists for that date would provide some such\r\nsolitary reference to so common a trade, and I do not jump from this to\r\nthe conclusion that Audley was the real mother of the Potteries. There\r\nare Subsidy Rolls giving Tunstall taxpayers in 1327 and 1333; still no\r\n_Potter_ is to be found. We have also now available a varied selection of\r\nthe Tunstall Court Rolls. The earliest, 1326, has nothing that one can\r\ntwist into a reference to potting; but then we can collect in subsequent\r\nyears the following:—\r\n\r\n    1348. William the Pottere gives 6_d._ for licence to make\r\n    earthern pots (_facere ollas terreas_).\r\n\r\n    1353. Thomas the Throgher is amerced for a default at\r\n    Chatterley.\r\n\r\n    1363. John Pottere is presented for an affray in Borewaslym\r\n    (Burslem).\r\n\r\n    1369. Robert le Potter gives 12_d._ for licence to get earth\r\n    for making pots until the following Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n    1372. Thomas le Thrower takes up land in Thursfield.\r\n\r\n    1405. Robert Potter is recently dead in Burslem.\r\n\r\n    1448. Richard Adams and William his brother are amerced for\r\n    digging clay (_argillium_) in the common road between Sneyd and\r\n    Burslem.\r\n\r\nIn several of the leases of land by copy of Court Roll of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth century the right to dig marl or clay (_argillium_ or\r\n_luteum_) is conceded, but I suspect it was usual even then to use such\r\nmarl as manure. The filling in of pits or lakes (_laca_) in the roads is\r\nalso a constant cause of trouble in these Rolls, but they may have been\r\ndue to honest wear and tear and not to the temptations of a cheap raw\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned however that we have hardly one quarter of these\r\nearly Tunstall Court Rolls, and must not assume that these few casual\r\nnotices of clay or pots is exhaustive. We now skip a century and pass to:—\r\n\r\n    1549. The jurors present Richard Denyell for that he dug mud\r\n    called clay (_fodit luteum vocatum cley_) in the King’s way at\r\n    Bronehillslane (Brownhills), and in Burselem.\r\n\r\n    1604. Penalty laid (i.e. _sub pœna_). It is ordained by the\r\n    jury that any person who digs “_argillum vocatum_ clay” in a\r\n    certain way called Wall Lane, which shall be prejudicial to\r\n    the passage by that way, or if he do not fill up the same well\r\n    and sufficiently, shall forfeit to the lord 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nSo far still no mention of potting. Various leisured people began now to\r\ndescribe England, relating what they saw and heard. Many of them dealt\r\nwith Staffordshire, but they notice no special and curious feature about\r\nthe North Staffordshire moorlands. Leyland in 1537, Camden in 1586,\r\nErdeswick in 1590, say nothing of a “Potteries.” Speed’s list of the\r\nShire products in 1625 omits pottery.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that some of the impetus for the local manufacture\r\nmay have come from the dissolution of the monasteries. There is reason\r\nto believe, judging from the remains at the Cistercian Abbey of Hulton,\r\nthat the monks there made such encaustic tiles as are to this day called\r\nCistercian. Now Hulton Abbey and the Abbey’s grange of Rushton both lie\r\nin Burslem parish. Some rudimentary practice in the art and mystery of\r\npotting may well have come from the seven[2] scattering brethren of this\r\ndissolved monastery, and may account in part for the development which\r\nwas to come.\r\n\r\nFor now we begin to find potters thick on the ground in Burslem.\r\n\r\nIn legal documents the practice grew of adding after any man’s name, his\r\ntrade; leases, depositions, wills, all show this. After 1600 one would\r\ncertainly expect to find some trade description, and at last, in 1616, we\r\nfind our first “potters.”\r\n\r\n1616. Richard Middleton demises to Thomas Danyell of Burselem senior,\r\npotter, a pasture called Brownehills and another pasture called The\r\nHill in Burslem containing 3 acres, with right to dig claye, “ffillinge\r\nupe the pitts after him,” for 21 years at a rent of 4s. He demises also\r\nto John Leigh 3 acres in Withiemore, with liberty to dig clay in the\r\nWithiemore when need be. (_Tunstall Court Rolls._)\r\n\r\nNext year, 1617, William Adams of Burslem describes himself in his Will\r\nas “potter”; and among the depositions of witnesses in the Chancery suit\r\nof “Mainwaring _v._ Shaw” of 1640, one of the witnesses, Ralph Simpson of\r\nBurslem, aged 80, is described as “potter.” Thereafter every reference\r\nto Burslem or Tunstall is replete with “potters” or “earth-potters,”\r\nand men trained to the trade were acquiring the skill necessary for the\r\nlocalization of the coming industry.\r\n\r\nThe men were ready. The clay and coal are found together cropping out\r\nin the country of the Staffordshire Potteries. The clay, though not now\r\nused for earthenware, is, and always has been, suitable for the saggars\r\nin which the ware is packed while being fired, and for the fire-bricks\r\nof the kiln in which the ware is baked. The coals were so cheap that,\r\nin 1680, they cost apparently only 16d. a ton at the pit’s mouth, and\r\nalthough such coal had to be carried usually on horseback, yet it never\r\nhad to be carried more than two miles to reach the pot ovens.\r\n\r\nOne other raw material was wanted—lead. It was the most expensive, almost\r\nthe only part of the master potter’s equipment that required capital.\r\nThe ore was got at Lawton Park, six miles to the north. The capital\r\nstock-in-trade of the early potter is shown by the Will of John Colclough\r\n_alias_ Rowley, of Burslem, who died in 1656, leaving “to Thomas\r\nWedgwood of the Churchyard of Burslem ... all my pottinge boards and all\r\nother necessary implements and materialls belonginge to the trade of\r\npottinge (lead and lead orre onely excepted).” This same Thomas Wedgwood\r\nwas great-grandfather of Josiah Wedgwood, and he, as well as two of his\r\nbrothers, Aaron and Moses, also describe themselves in their Wills as\r\n“Potters.”\r\n\r\nBurslem was by 1670 full of potters; making no doubt butter-pots or\r\nthe commonest of ware.[3] A little further off, in the valley of\r\nTinkersclough, Thomas Toft was actually attempting decoration. The Toft\r\ndishes are well known. They are signed with the name, Thomas Toft or\r\nRalph Toft, written in liquid slip clay upon the plate. They are made\r\nof red, buff or yellow clay, and other coloured slip-clays are dribbled\r\nover them through a quill, so as to make pictures of Charles II, or Queen\r\nAnne, or a pelican picking its breast to feed its young. Then the whole\r\nis dusted over with powdered lead ore, and fired till the lead fuses into\r\nthe plate and forms a rich yellowish glaze.\r\n\r\nSome of these productions, of what has come to be called the Toft school,\r\nare dated. There is a candlestick, very elaborate, dated 1649, and\r\nclaimed for Staffordshire. Shaw mentions two dishes marked, one “Thos.\r\nSans,” and the other “Thos. Toft,” each dated 1650.[4] M. Solon had seen\r\na slip dish, in a cottage in Hanley, bearing this inscription scratched\r\non its back, “Thomas Toft, Tinkers Clough, I made it 166-.”[5] A dish\r\nwith the picture of a soldier bearing a sword in each hand, and inscribed\r\nin slip “Ralph Toft, 1677” is also mentioned by M. Solon.[6] Another,\r\nmarked Ralph Toft, and bearing the image of a very wasp-waisted lady is\r\nin the Salford Museum, dated “1676.”[7]\r\n\r\nOther makers of this school were Thomas and William Sans, Ralph Simson\r\nand William Taylor. They made two-handled drinking mugs called “tygs”\r\nwith similar decoration; and small model cradles made in clay and\r\nslip—presents for young married couples, according to their local custom.\r\nPuzzle Jugs were another “freak” production, speaking the humour of the\r\ntime. The jug was so contrived with multiple spouts and hidden passages\r\nas to spill however one tried to drink from it. A sample of these puzzle\r\njugs in stoneware bears the inscription “John Wedgwood 1691.”[8] This\r\nman was the eldest son of the Thomas Wedgwood previously mentioned, and\r\ndid not pot himself. I think this jug was made for him by his nephew,\r\nRichard Wedgwood, to whom he both leased the Overhouse Works and married\r\nhis daughter and heiress. Several pieces are marked with the name “Joseph\r\nGlass,” who is known to have been a potter in Hanley in 1710-15.\r\n\r\nAll these early master potters were handy men of many trades. They\r\nmade their pots in sheds at the “backsides” of their dwelling houses,\r\nalongside the cow-shed. They dug their own clay, often in front of their\r\nown front doors. The Wedgwoods at least owned and dug their own coal,\r\nwherewith to fire the oven. It was a peasant industry, carried on by the\r\nfamily, among the pigs and fowls; and when they were not making show\r\npieces for presentation they made butter-pots, in which farmers might\r\nmarket their butter at Uttoxeter—at least so says Dr Plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA PEASANT INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Plot seems to have visited the Potteries in 1677. In 1686 he published\r\nhis “Natural History of Staffordshire.” Although he obviously takes the\r\nmost lively interest in the dances of witches, and that strange chemical\r\nprocess called “striking with galls,” yet he was also a keen observer,\r\nand found time to set down the earliest account—and at the same time\r\nan intelligent account—of the North Staffordshire potting industry. A\r\ncontemporary account of this early date must obviously be of the greatest\r\nimportance, and it is here given in full.\r\n\r\n“As for tobacco-pipe clays, they are found all over the County ...\r\nwhereof they make pipes at Armitage and Lichfield ... also at Darlaston,\r\nbut of late disused, because of better and cheaper found in Monway field\r\nbetwixt Wednesbury and Willingsworth, which make excellent pipes. And\r\nCharles Rigg, of Newcastle, makes very good pipes of three sorts of\r\nclay; a white, and a blew, which he has from between Shelton and Handley\r\nGreen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slip decorated Staffordshire ware. _c._ 1660. In the\r\nStoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\n“The most preferable clay of any is that of Amblecot, of a dark blewish\r\ncolor, whereoff they make the best pots for the glass-houses of any in\r\nEngland; ... Other potters clays for the more common wares, there are\r\n... at Horseley Heath, Tipton and in Monway field ... of these they make\r\ndiverse sorts of vessells at Wednesbury, which they paint with slip made\r\nof a reddish sort of earth gotten at Tipton.\r\n\r\n“But the greatest pottery they have in this County is carried on at\r\nBurslem, near Newcastle-under-Lyme, where for making their severall sorts\r\nof pots they have as many different sorts of clays, which they dig round\r\nabout the towne, all within half a miles distance, the best being found\r\nnearest the coale; and are distinguished by their colours and uses as\r\nfolloweth:—\r\n\r\n    1. Bottle clay, of a bright whitish streaked yellow colour.\r\n\r\n    2. Hard-fire clay of a duller whitish colour, and fuller\r\n    interspersed with a dark yellow, which they use for their\r\n    black wares, being mixed with the\r\n\r\n    3. Red blending clay, which is of a dirty red colour.\r\n\r\n    4. White-clay, so called, it seems though of a blewish colour,\r\n    and used for making a yellow-coloured ware, because yellow is\r\n    the lightest colour they make any ware of.[9]\r\n\r\nall which they call _throwing clays_, because they are of a closer\r\ntexture, and will work on the wheel;\r\n\r\n“Which none of the three other clays, they call _slips_, will any of them\r\ndoe, being of looser and more friable natures; these mixed with water\r\nthey make into a consistence thinner than a syrup, so that being put into\r\na bucket it will run out through a quill; this they call Slip, and is the\r\nsubstance wherewith they paint their wares; whereof the\r\n\r\n    1-sort is called the Orange slip, which before it is worked, is\r\n    of a greyish colour mixt with orange balls, and gives the ware\r\n    when annealed an orange colour.\r\n\r\n    2. The White slip, this before it is workt, is of a dark\r\n    blewish colour, yet makes the ware yellow, which being the\r\n    lightest colour they make any of, they call it (as they did the\r\n    clay above) the white slip.\r\n\r\n    3. The Red slip, made of a dirty reddish clay, which gives\r\n    wares a black colour.\r\n\r\nneither of which clays or slips must have any gravel or sand in them;\r\nupon this account before it be brought to the wheel they prepare the clay\r\nby steeping it in water in a square pit, till it be of a due consistence;\r\nthen they bring it to their beating board, where with a long spatula they\r\nbeat it till it be well mixed; then being first made into great squarish\r\nrolls, it is brought to the wageing board, where it is slit into flat\r\nthin pieces with a wire, and the least stones or gravel pickt out of\r\nit; This being done, they wage it, i.e. knead or mould it like bread,\r\nand make it into round balls proportionable to their work, and then tis\r\nbrought to the wheel, and formed as the workman sees good.\r\n\r\n“When the potter has wrought the clay either into hollow or flat ware,\r\nthey are set abroad to dry in fair weather, but by the fire in foule,\r\nturning them as they see occasion, which they call whaving: when they\r\nare dry they stouk them, i.e. put ears and handles to such vessels as\r\nrequire them: These also, being dry, they then slip or paint them with\r\ntheir several sorts of slip, according as they design their work,—when\r\nthe first slip is dry, laying on the others at their leasure, the\r\norange slip making the ground, and the white and red the paint; which\r\ntwo colours they break with a wire brush, much after the manner they do\r\nwhen they marble paper, and then cloud them with a pensil when they are\r\npretty dry. After the vessels are painted they lead them, with that sort\r\nof lead ore they call smithum, which is the smallest ore of all, beaten\r\ninto dust, finely sifted and strewed upon them; which gives them the\r\ngloss, but not the colour;[10] all the colours being chiefly given by the\r\nvariety of slips, except the motley colour, which is procured by blending\r\nthe lead with manganese, by the workmen called ‘magnus.’[11] But when\r\nthey have a mind to show the utmost of their skill in giving their wares\r\na fairer gloss than ordinary, they lead them then with lead calcined\r\ninto powder, which they also sift fine and strew upon them as before,\r\nwhich not only gives them a higher gloss, but goes much further too in\r\ntheir work, than lead ore would have done.\r\n\r\n“After this is done they are carried to the oven, which is ordinarily\r\nabove 8 foot high, and about 6 foot wide, of a round copped forme, where\r\nthey are placed one upon another from the bottom to the top: if they be\r\nordinary wares such as cylindrical butter pots &c. that are not leaded,\r\nthey are exposed to the naked fire, and so is all their flatware though\r\nit be leaded, haveing only parting-shards, i.e. thin bits of old pots put\r\nbetween them, to keep them from sticking together. But if they be leaded\r\nhollow-wares, they do not expose them to the naked fire, but put them\r\nin shragers, that is, in coarse metall’d pots, made of marle (not clay)\r\nof divers formes, according as their wares require, in which they put\r\ncommonly three pieces of clay called Bobbs for the ware to stand on, to\r\nkeep it from sticking to the shragers; as they put them in the shragers\r\nto keep them from sticking to one another (which they would certainly\r\notherwise doe by reason of the leading) and to preserve them from the\r\nvehemence of the fire, which else would melt them downe, or at least\r\nwarp them. In 24 hours an oven of pots will be burnt, then they let the\r\nfire goe out by degrees which in 10 hours more will be perfectly done,\r\nand then they draw them for sale, which is chiefly to the poor cratemen,\r\nwho carry them at their backs all over the whole Countrey, to whome they\r\nreckon them by the piece, i.e. Quart, in hollow ware, so that 6 pottle,\r\nor 3 gallon bottles make a dozen, and so more or less to a dozen, as they\r\nare of greater or lesser content; The flat wares are also reckon’d by\r\npieces and dozens, but not (as the hollow) according to their content,\r\nbut their different bredths.”[12]\r\n\r\nAgain, in discussing the great dairy produce market at Uttoxeter, at\r\nwhich the Cheesemongers of London had thought it worth while to set up a\r\n“factorage,” Plot says:—“the factors many mercat days (in the season) lay\r\nout no less than £500 a day, in these two commodities [butter and cheese]\r\nonly. The butter they buy by the pot, of a long cylindrical form, made\r\nat Burslem in this County of a certain size, so as not to weigh above 6\r\nlbs. at most, and yet to contain at least 14 lbs. of butter, according\r\nto an Act of Parliament made about 14-16 years agoe, for regulating the\r\nabuses of this trade in the make of the pots and false packing of the\r\nbutter.”[13]\r\n\r\nLater on, too, he describes how the lead ores are “dug in a yellowish\r\nstone, with cawk and spar, on the side of Lawton Park;[14] where the\r\nworkmen distinguisht it into three sorts, viz. round ore, small ore, and\r\nsmithum.” He describes how the ores are cleaned; “which done, it is sold\r\nto the potters at Burslem for 6 or 7 pounds per tun, who have occasion\r\nfor most that is found here for glaseing their pots.”\r\n\r\nFor a contemporary inventory of a nascent industry Plot’s account is\r\nextraordinarily full and accurate. It is so important and so unique, that\r\nno apology need be made for quoting it at length.\r\n\r\nThe pot-oven described by Plot would be surrounded by a wall of clods of\r\nturf to keep in the heat, or by a “hovel” with walls of broken saggars,\r\nroofed with boughs and clods of earth. Each pot-works consisted of a\r\nhovel such as this, some thatched open sheds for drying the ware, and an\r\nopen tank or sun-pan in which the clay mixed with water was evaporated.\r\nThese sun-pans or sun-kilns were 12 to 20 feet long and wide and about\r\n18 inches deep. One portion partitioned off, and deeper and lined with\r\nflag-stones, was used for mixing. Here the clay was “blunged” by a man\r\nwith a long pole or paddle, and thoroughly mixed with the water. The\r\nmixture was then poured through a sieve from the blunging vat into the\r\nsun-pan.\r\n\r\nA pot-works of almost exactly this description is to be seen to-day at\r\nGarshall Green near Stone, for making flower pots; even here, however, a\r\npugmill has taken the place of the blunging pole.\r\n\r\nIt was a very raw industry in 1677. What led to the artistic development\r\nof pottery in England as a whole was the trading contact with the\r\nadvancing civilization of Holland and Germany. The English were learning\r\nall through the reigns of Elizabeth and the Stuarts to adapt pottery\r\nto drinking and eating purposes; and the London and Bristol potters\r\nwere learning to copy the tin-enamelled dishes from Delft, and the\r\nstoneware drinking mugs from the Rhine. The ideas which Holland and\r\nGermany had passed on to London, found their way at last to North\r\nStaffordshire. In that narrow area were to be found the requisites needed\r\nfor a manufacture;—the clays to make, the coals to fire, the men with\r\nexperience. All that was still needed was the artist and experimental\r\nchemist. It might even be said that the artists were already there and in\r\na sense they were.\r\n\r\nProbably the commonest production of the North Staffordshire Potteries\r\nin 1677, after the redoubtable butter-pots, was the marbled ware that\r\nPlot mentions. This method of decoration consists of laying on lines or\r\nsplashes of the different coloured slips, and then combing or sponging\r\nthem together. This marbled ware remained popular for a hundred years,\r\nand was the legitimate precursor of the solid agate wares of Whieldon and\r\nWedgwood.\r\n\r\nA later historian, Simeon Shaw, writing in 1828, tells us on the\r\nauthority of tradition that, besides makers of the butter-pots, and the\r\nmottled and marbled ware, and the slip-decorated ware, there was in 1685\r\na potter, Thomas Miles of Shelton, who was even then making from a local\r\nclay, mixed with white sand from Baddeley Edge, something which he calls\r\n“stone-ware.”[15] Certain it is, as will be shown later, that Aaron\r\nWedgwood and his sons Thomas and Richard and also Matthew Garner were\r\nmaking brown stoneware and red teapots in Burslem in 1693. Stoneware,\r\nas we understand it, is so hard and dense that it requires no glaze to\r\nmake it impervious to water, because it can be fired at such a high\r\ntemperature as to partially fuse the body of the ware. This stoneware,\r\nafterwards glazed with salt, was to be the most distinctive product of\r\nNorth Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nThese peasant potters “fired” and “drew out” one oven a week. They drew\r\nthe cold oven on Monday; refilled it with new ware about Thursday, and\r\nfired it on Friday, giving it a last stoking up on Saturday morning,\r\nafter which it cooled till Monday again. The ordinary ware was at this\r\ntime only fired once, and only fired to a moderate temperature, just\r\nsufficient to melt the dusted lead ore and fuse it into a glaze on the\r\nsurface of the ware, thus making it impervious to water. Though the\r\nnative potters were even then trying to improve their craft from the\r\nGerman or Dutch potters employed in London, yet, as M. Solon has shown,\r\nthey owed very little to the science or knowledge of the world, even the\r\nlimited knowledge of that period. The colouring properties of Copper\r\nOxide were known and employed throughout England at this period, yet\r\nthere is no trace on the wares of the North Staffordshire potters till\r\nthe eighteenth century is well advanced of the distinctive blue given by\r\nthis invaluable colouring material.\r\n\r\nThe ware produced was sold to the travelling packmen, and, at great\r\ncost, distributed on horseback throughout the country. Everything was\r\ncoarse and elementary. There were no turning lathes to give neatness\r\nto the thrown article; there was no white body or ground upon which to\r\nenamel colours; there were no moulds for any but the smallest ornamental\r\n“spriggs”; no enamel paints; and there was practically no means of\r\ngetting to a market.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the Staffordshire potting trade in the year 1693,\r\nwhen those mysterious foreigners, John Philip Elers and David Elers,\r\nappeared upon the scene, like Cortez among the Mexicans, and broke up for\r\never the placid uneventful course of the old peasant industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nELERS AND ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brothers Elers are supposed to have come from Amsterdam in the train\r\nof the Prince of Orange. Jewitt has studied their pedigree and says they\r\nwere originally of a noble family of Saxony—their father an ambassador,\r\ntheir grandfather an admiral! However that may be, the first notice we\r\nhave of them is in a note in the Philosophical Transactions of 1693 by Dr\r\nMartin Lister. He says: “I have this to add, that this clay Haematites,\r\nis as good, if not better, than that which is brought from the East\r\nIndies. Witness the teapots now to be sold at the potters in the Poultry\r\nin Cheapside, which not only for art, but for beautiful colour too,\r\nare far beyond any we have from China; these are made from the English\r\nHaematites in Staffordshire, as I take it, by two Dutchmen incomparable\r\nartists.”[16] We too may call them incomparable artists if we compare\r\nthis evidence with Plot’s account of fifteen years before, or their\r\nteapots sold at a guinea a time,[17] with the almost barbaric puzzle-jars\r\nof the native potter.\r\n\r\nIt has hitherto been assumed from this statement of Dr Lister’s that\r\nthe Elers were _in_ Staffordshire in 1693. It does not follow from the\r\nextract that the teapots were made in Staffordshire, only that the clay\r\ncame from thence. In the same year, 1693, they were sued by Dwight of\r\nFulham for copying his red teapots, and in the suit they are described\r\nas “of Fulham.” Moreover Dr Martin Lister, writing again in 1698 in his\r\n“Account of a Journey to Paris in the Year 1698,” says, after speaking of\r\nthe porcelain made at St Cloud, “As for the red ware of China, that has\r\nbeen and is done in England.... But we are in this particular beholden to\r\ntwo Dutchmen who wrought in Staffordshire, as I have been told, and were\r\nnot long since in Hammersmith.”[18] This, it will be seen, confirms the\r\nsupposition that they first made their teapots and stoneware in Fulham or\r\nHammersmith.\r\n\r\nThe important Chancery Suit, discovered by Prof. Church, in which Dwight\r\nsued his copyists at Fulham, Nottingham and Burslem is as follows:\r\n\r\nJune 20, 1693. The complaint of John Dwight of Fulham in the County of\r\nMiddlesex, gentleman, showing that the complainant having ... invented\r\nand set up at Fulham several new manufactures of earthenwares called\r\nWhite Gorges, marbled porcelaine vessells, statues and figures and fine\r\nstone gorges and vessells never before made in England or elsewhere, and\r\nalsoe discovered the mystery of opacous red and dark coloured porcelaine\r\nand china ... obtained lettres patent dated June 12, 1684 ... he and his\r\nservants have for several years past used ... said invention ... and\r\nsold them.... But having formerly hired one John Chandler of Fulham ...\r\nand employed him in the making ... thereupon John Elers and David Elers,\r\nboth of Fulham (who are forreigners and by trade silversmiths) together\r\nwith James Morley of Nottingham and also Aaron Wedgwood Thomas Wedgwood\r\nand Richard Wedgwood of Berslem in the County of Stafford and Matthew\r\nGarner ... did insinuate themselves into the acquaintance of the said\r\nJohn Chandler and ... inticed him to instruct them ... and to desert the\r\ncomplainant’s service to enter into partnership together with them to\r\nmake and sell the said wares ... but far inferior to them.... And the\r\nsaid confederates, “the better to colour their said unjust and injurious\r\npractises,” pretend that the earthenwares made and sold by them are in no\r\nway like those invented by the complainant but differ from them in form\r\nand figure and have several additions and improvements ... whereas the\r\ntruth is they are made in imitation of the complainants wares ... prays\r\nthat writs of _subpena_ be directed to John Chandler, John Elers, David\r\nElers, Aaron Wedgwood, Thomas Wedgwood, Richard Wedgwood and Matthew\r\nGarner and James Morley.\r\n\r\nThe answer, dated June 8, 1694, of the man with the Staffordshire name\r\nof Garner to this Bill of Complaint, shows that he was apprenticed about\r\n1680 for eight years to one Thomas Harper of Southwark, potmaker, and he\r\nsays that, afterwards, he invented a way of making earthen brown pans\r\nand mugs, which art he still practises. The answer of David Elers to the\r\nsame Bill, dated July 28, 1693, states that he learnt at Cologne the\r\nmanufacture of “earthenware commonly called Cologne or Stone wares,”\r\nand that about three years ago he and his brother began to make brown\r\nmugs and red teapots “within this kingdom of England,” and employed John\r\nChandler. He says that neither he nor his brother nor Morley nor any of\r\nthe other defendants knew John Chandler while he was in the employ of\r\nDwight. He denies that James Morley was ever a partner with him or his\r\nbrother, or that Chandler was more than a hired labourer. He complains\r\nthat he and his brother ought not to be deprived of their living.\r\n\r\nAn order was made on August 10, 1693, for a trial of the action against\r\nMorley and the Elers for the making of a brown mug and two red teapots\r\nin imitation of china. Before the trial came on in November the Elers\r\ncame to terms with Dwight, and Morley put off his case by claiming that\r\nhe only made brown mugs and not the red teapots. On December 15, 1693,\r\nthe three Wedgwoods were ordered to be added to the Bill as defendants,\r\nand on May 5, 1694, Matthew Garner was added also. On May 19, 1694, the\r\nWedgwoods “for delay have craved a _dedimus_ to answer in the country,”\r\nand yet in the meantime proceed to make and vend the several wares,\r\nagainst which continuance the plaintiff Dwight obtained an injunction\r\n“until they shall directly answer to the complaint and the Court shall\r\nmake other order to the contrary against them their workmen servants and\r\nagents.” On June 21, 1694, a similar injunction was obtained against\r\nMatthew Garner; and on July 26, 1695, against Morley. Garner in his turn\r\nwanted his witnesses examined in the country, and the cases against\r\nhim and Morley and one Luke Talbott dragged on till July, 1696, though\r\nnothing more is to be found of the suit against the Wedgwoods. Probably\r\nthey too compromised on the basis of each paying their own costs, for\r\nthe last notice there is of these suits is one dated July 1, 1696, which\r\nshows Dwight suing his solicitor for excessive costs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earliest known piece of Staffordshire salt glaze ware,\r\n1701. From the Stoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\nThis suit, given by Professor Church in the “Burlington Magazine”\r\n(February, 1908) upsets a good many preconceptions, and throws\r\nconsiderable light on the stage at which the development of the potting\r\ncraft had arrived in 1693. In the first place Garner, a Staffordshire\r\nlad to judge from his name, is apprenticed to a London potter. This shows\r\ncommunication between London and Staffordshire, and a clear desire to\r\nimprove a potting trade in Staffordshire by contact with more civilized\r\nmethods. Then the injunction obtained against Aaron Wedgwood and his\r\nsons, “Doctor” Thomas and Richard “of the Overhouse,” shows that they\r\nwere making in 1693 the red teapots, known to collectors as Elers and\r\nDwight, and the brown stoneware which, glazed with salt, was later the\r\ncharacteristic work of Dr Thomas Wedgwood. We must, therefore, call these\r\nWedgwoods and Matthew Garner the first known Staffordshire makers of\r\nstoneware, and as Garner was out of his apprenticeship in 1688, and Elers\r\nstarted in Fulham in 1690, we can give the date 1690 as the starting\r\npoint of the stoneware glazed with salt in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nIf there was a definite partnership between the Elers and the Wedgwoods\r\nI expect it was confined to the supply of red Staffordshire clay to the\r\nfactory at Fulham. It may well be that, as a result of this very action,\r\nthe Elers determined to shift their workshops and put them up in the\r\nplace whence hitherto they had got their clay, and where the unfortunate\r\nleakage that had perhaps betrayed Dwight’s secrets could, in their case,\r\nbe more easily prevented. Be the cause what it may, between 1693 and 1698\r\nJohn Philip Elers, the elder brother, was established in a secluded farm\r\nin Bradwell Wood under Red Street. It should be noticed that at this\r\ntime, and for half a century afterwards, Red Street was important as a\r\npotting village. Messrs Mayer & Moss of Red Street were, about 1740,\r\namong the most considerable potters of their day.\r\n\r\nHere, at Bradwell, the Elers put up their workshops and small kiln, while\r\nthey lived at another old house, Dimsdale Hall, which is still standing\r\nabout a mile to the south. Shaw[19] had a legend about an elaborate\r\nunderground speaking-tube, fixed from Bradwell to Dimsdale, through which\r\nnotice might be given to the works of the approach of strangers. And it\r\nis a curious tribute to the value of such legends that, within the last\r\nfew years, white earthenware voice-pipes have actually been dug up on\r\nthe site of the Bradwell factory. They did not, of course, really extend\r\nfrom Bradwell to Dimsdale, but they went from one part of the factory to\r\nanother, and were probably devised to secure secrecy rather than modern\r\neconomy. These pipes are now to be seen in the Hanley Museum, and the\r\ncurious thing is that one of them is glazed with salt. This, besides\r\nconfirming the legend of the voice-pipes, is the only certain living\r\nwitness that the Elers used salt glaze.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the two brothers going to Staffordshire, but the\r\nrecently accepted view is that John Philip Elers alone worked at\r\nBradwell, while David remained in London at the shop in the Poultry,\r\nwhere he sold his brother’s teapots at from 12s. to 24s. apiece.[20]\r\n\r\nThe first pottery ware made at Bradwell was the same as Dwight’s “red\r\nporcelaine.” On the land at Bradwell Farm was the seam of red clay\r\nwhich formed the foundation of the ware, giving when fired a dense hard\r\nred stoneware of fine texture.[21] There are in the South Kensington\r\nMuseum two pieces of “red porcelain” credited by Burton to Elers\r\nand illustrated in his book. They are in marked contrast to the slip\r\ndecorated and marbled Staffordshire ware of the same time. They have\r\nbeen turned in the lathe after throwing, and thus made thin and light.\r\nThe clay body is homogeneous and smooth, showing greater care in the\r\npreparation of the body. The ornamentation is delicate and artistic, and\r\nhas been made by sealing a soft piece of the clay on to the ware with a\r\nmetal seal pressed over the soft clay. There is no glaze, but a high fire\r\nhas produced a ware so hard as to be almost forged solid. These things\r\nshow the hand of the ex-silversmith in size and shape and finish. The\r\nBurslem imitators—Garner and the Wedgwoods—never made things like these.\r\nElers, though he may have stolen Dwight’s secrets, went ahead and showed\r\nthe possibilities of potting. He is said also to have produced black ware\r\nof a similar character by mixing oxide of manganese—the “magnus” of Dr\r\nPlot—with the clay body, and, though no known pieces of black Elers ware\r\ncan now be certainly identified, it is this black ware that his copyists\r\nchiefly developed.[22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Red china teapot, probably by Elers. _c._ 1700.\r\n\r\n2. Sample of later date, with moulded spout. Stoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samples of solid agate ware made by Wedgwood or Whieldon.\r\n_c._ 1760.\r\n\r\nFrom the Stoke-on-Trent Museums (see p. 74).]\r\n\r\nFor Nemesis overtook John Philip Elers, and in spite of all his\r\nsecrecy, perhaps because of it, he was copied. Two potters, Twyford and\r\nAstbury,[23] one of whom at least had already made pots after local\r\nmethods in Shelton, set themselves independently to acquire the arts of\r\nthe Dutchman. To lull the suspicions of Elers, Twyford shammed stupidity,\r\nand Astbury, who was younger, passed himself off as an idiot. Recommended\r\nby these strange qualifications, they asked and obtained employment and,\r\nin time, the knowledge they desired. They went back to Shelton with their\r\nacquired arts, and, in a few years, the most intelligent potters of North\r\nStaffordshire knew how to make civilized pottery. But by 1710 John Philip\r\nElers was tired of his exile and of the treatment he had received. The\r\ntrue porcelain which should detect poison was still unattained, and\r\nhis “red porcelain” and his black ware were become by somewhat sharp\r\npractice a staple product of the district. So he shook off the clay of\r\nStaffordshire from his feet and rejoined his brother in London.\r\n\r\nYears later Josiah Wedgwood, who had every reason to know the history\r\nof the potteries from hearsay, legend and family tradition, gave an\r\naccount to his partner Bentley of what John Philip Elers had done. The\r\nson, Paul Elers, had asked Wedgwood to make a medallion of his father’s\r\nhead, surrounded by the motto: “Plasticis Britannicae Inventor.” Josiah\r\nWedgwood—looking back on the long array of his ancestors, all potters\r\nborn and bred in Burslem before ever Elers put his hand to the thrower’s\r\nwheel—says the motto “conveys a falsehood,” and that John Philip Elers\r\nmerely _improved_ the Art. “The reason,” he writes in 1777, “for Mr Elers\r\nfixing upon Staffordshire to try his experiments, seems to be that the\r\nPottery was carried on there in a much larger way, and in a more improved\r\nstate, than in any other part of Great Britain.” “The improvements Mr\r\nElers made in our manufactory were precisely these. Glazing our common\r\nclays with salt, which produced Pot d’Grey or Stone Ware.... I make no\r\ndoubt but glazing with salt, by casting it among the ware while it is\r\nred hot, came to us from Germany, but whether Mr Elers was the person\r\nto whom we are indebted for the improvement I do not know.... The next\r\nimprovement introduced by Mr Elers was the refining our common red clay\r\nby sifting, and make it into Tea and Coffee ware in imitation of the\r\nChinese red Porcelain, by casting it in plaster moulds, and turning it\r\nupon the outside upon lathes, and ornamenting it with the tea-branch in\r\nrelief.”[24]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say why Wedgwood attributed “casting in plaster\r\nmoulds” to Elers, for all the evidence goes to show that the process\r\nknown technically as “casting” only came in with the introduction of\r\nalabaster “blocks” and pitcher moulds after 1730. As to the far more\r\nimportant and debatable point—the introduction of the process of glazing\r\nwith salt—this evidence of Wedgwood’s is perhaps the most reliable that\r\nwe can get.\r\n\r\nAs the invention of salt glazing not only made, at one stroke, a new\r\nmanufacture possible, but one that was peculiar to North Staffordshire,\r\nit may be as well to examine more closely the evidence as to its\r\ndiscoverer and its discovery.\r\n\r\nThe idea that salt glazing was accidentally discovered at Bagnal by\r\nsome strong brine solution boiling away in an earthen pot which became\r\nautomatically glazed[25] may be dismissed at once for the simple reason\r\nthat it could not happen as described. It may be urged too in Elers’\r\nfavour that, long before this, salt glazing was practised in Germany.\r\nAgain, Aikin in his “History of Manchester,” written in 1794, gives an\r\nelaborate account of the novelty as practised by Elers. He writes: “It\r\nwas in the memory of some old persons with whom a friend of ours was well\r\nacquainted that the inhabitants of Burslem flocked with astonishment to\r\nsee the immense volumes of smoke which arose from the Dutchmen’s ovens on\r\ncasting in the salt; a circumstance which sufficiently shows the novelty\r\nof this practice in Staffordshire Potteries.”[26] Probably this part\r\nof Dr Aikin’s work was written by Alex. Chisholm, secretary to Josiah\r\nWedgwood.\r\n\r\nAt least the same story was told to Josiah Wedgwood in 1765 by an old\r\nworkman named Steel, aged 84, who could remember the Dutchmen at work\r\nat Bradwell, and who joined those who ran to the place amazed at this\r\nunusual mode of firing. No doubt this is what was in Wedgwood’s mind when\r\nhe wrote to Bentley in 1777, as quoted above.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we have the evidence of Simeon Shaw,[27] first that\r\nWilliam Adams and Thomas Miles produced salt glaze in 1680 (a very\r\ndoubtful supposition in view of the Chancery suit recently discovered),\r\nand then that “Mr. John Mountford, 27 years since (i.e. in 1801), took\r\ndown the remains of the (Elers’) oven, and he states that the height was\r\nabout 7 feet, but not like the salt-glaze ovens.” And again: “E. Wood and\r\nJ. Riley both separately measured the inside diameter of the remains,\r\nat about 5 feet; while other ovens, of the same date, in Burslem, were\r\n10 or 12 feet. The oven itself had 5 mouths, but neither holes over the\r\ninside flues nor bags, to receive the salt, had any been used by them.”\r\n“The foundations,” he adds, “were very distinctly to be seen in 1808,\r\nthough now covered by an enlargement of the barn.”\r\n\r\nAlso there is the fact that no salt glaze ware that could be conclusively\r\nshown to be Elers’ has ever been excavated on the site of his factory,\r\nexcept the white voice-pipes previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration—the impossibility of saying\r\ndefinitely who the makers of early pieces of salt glaze were; the\r\npossibility of Elers having made his salt-glaze in a different oven\r\nand on a different site to that seen and excavated; the fact that in\r\n1710-1715 Staffordshire potters were making stoneware, and that Plot does\r\nnot mention it in 1677—none but Garner and the Wedgwoods were sued for\r\nmaking even stoneware in 1693—we may assume that the Elers did, in actual\r\nfact, introduce the salt glaze into North Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nThe red and black bodies made by Elers are still in fashion, but even\r\nmore valuable than the doubtful invention of the particular ware was\r\nhis careful method of refining and mixing the clay body, and the exact\r\nturning of the pieces to extreme thinness and precision of outline. On\r\nthe excellence of his work, rather than on inventions which were not\r\nreally new, his fame deserves to rest. He may not, for example, have been\r\nthe first to introduce the method of sealing on the clay ornaments, but\r\nthe ornaments themselves were for the first time in really good taste. It\r\nwas this refined taste and precision of execution—and the proof that it\r\npaid financially—which taught the Staffordshire potters the most valuable\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, when Queen Anne and tea drinking came in, North\r\nStaffordshire had not only the clay and the coal, but also the tradesmen\r\nto make the ware required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE SALT-GLAZE POTTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe successors of Elers—Robert Astbury, Joshua Twyford, and especially\r\nDr Thomas Wedgwood—built up the reputation of the salt-glazed stoneware,\r\nwhich for fifty years was the glory of North Staffordshire; and, in the\r\nimprovements they effected, the first two atoned for anything that to the\r\nmodern mind was irregular in the manner by which they got their start.\r\n\r\nIt was to Dr Thomas Wedgwood (1655-1717), and his son Thomas (1695-1737),\r\nwho made stoneware at “Ruffleys” in Burslem, that local tradition\r\nascribes most of the improvements in salt-glazed wares. Mr Burton writes\r\nof the younger Dr Thomas: “It has never been suggested that Dr Thomas\r\nWedgwood, like Twyford or Astbury, learned anything directly from Elers,\r\nbut as he was a man of intelligence and commercial aptitude, as well as\r\none of the best practical potters of the day, he would naturally adopt\r\nsuch new ideas as were brought in his way. Judging by the fragments of\r\ndrab salt-glazed stonewares that have been found on the site of his old\r\nworks in the centre of the town of Burslem, collectors are in the habit\r\nof attributing to him, with some show of justice, the finest pieces of\r\nthis type.”[28][29]\r\n\r\nThe secret of the salt-glaze process consists in firing the ware,\r\nspecially composed of clay mixed with some siliceous sand or flint, to a\r\ntemperature higher than ordinary earthenware will stand, and then, when\r\nred hot, shovelling common salt on to it through the top of the furnace.\r\nThe salt fumes, passing through large holes in the saggars, cover the\r\nware with a fine coat of colourless soda glaze. This glaze can always be\r\ndistinguished from lead glazes by its peculiar pock-marked roughness,\r\nwhich indeed makes it somewhat unsuitable for plates or dishes for\r\nordinary use; and, although for fifty years salt glaze did more than hold\r\nits own in public estimation, improvements in the old earthenware finally\r\ndrove it out. By the end of the eighteenth century salt glazing had\r\nceased to be practised.\r\n\r\nWithout Astbury,[30] who is said to have died in 1743, aged 65,[31] it\r\nis doubtful whether even salt glazing could have been a really great\r\nsuccess. He it was that obtained a body white enough to show off the\r\ntransparent salt glaze to the best advantage. Dr Thomas Wedgwood had only\r\nthe drab body to work on—a far less effective medium.\r\n\r\nWith the object of whitening the clay body, Astbury began to import the\r\nwhite clays of Devonshire.[32] At first he used them only as a wash or\r\ndip to whiten the surface of the ware, just as the tin-enamel had been\r\nused to conceal and coat the coarse body of the Delft ware. Then he\r\ndeveloped the use of the white sands of Baddeley Edge and Mow Cop to\r\nharden the body; and, in 1720, according to tradition, he made the really\r\nvital discovery of the value of calcined flint stones for both these\r\npurposes—to whiten and to harden the clay body from which the stone ware\r\nwas made. Josiah Wedgwood, writing in 1777, attributed this discovery to\r\na potter of Shelton called Heath instead of to Astbury,[33] but whoever\r\nit was that first noticed the whiteness of burnt flints, it was Astbury\r\nwho first determined the value of the new material and the manner of\r\nusing it. This discovery marks the first stage in the production of\r\ncream-coloured earthenware as well as in the production of the perfect\r\nsalt glaze.[34]\r\n\r\nAstbury and his son Thomas made red and black ware also, after the\r\npattern of Elers, but with this difference, the ornamentation of\r\nAstbury’s red or black ware is generally done in white clay,[35] instead\r\nof in the same colour as the body; and this is one sign by which\r\ncollectors distinguish these two makers. Robert (or John) Astbury was\r\nsucceeded by his son Thomas, who had started potting at Lane Delf in\r\n1725. Their name does not occur among the potters of the latter half of\r\nthe eighteenth century, but Margaret, Thomas Astbury’s daughter, married\r\nRobert Garner, a master potter of Longton, who attained a considerable\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nJoshua Twyford (1640-1729), like Astbury, had his factory in Shelton;\r\none stood on either side of the mound where the church now is. Twyford\r\nis best known for his stoneware, chiefly red and black in the style of\r\nElers, but he is also supposed to have made salt-glazed ware.\r\n\r\nA particularly full account of the potters of 1710-15, especially of\r\nthose in Burslem, is preserved in a document drawn up by Josiah Wedgwood\r\nin 1765. He gives both the weekly cost-account of a typical pot factory\r\nof this period; and also a list of the potters’ names and the kind of\r\nware they produced. The document is in his own handwriting, and it\r\nappears from a letter of Wedgwood’s to Lord Auckland in 1792 that he\r\nobtained the information given in this document by “having examined\r\nsome of the oldest men in the pottery here, near thirty years ago, who\r\nknew personally the masters in the pottery, and very nearly the value of\r\nthe goods they got up, fifty years before that.” ... “From these data,”\r\nhe goes on to say, “I can pretty nearly ascertain the annual value of\r\nthe goods made here at that time; which was something under £10,000 a\r\nyear.”[36] He then proceeds to guess at the annual value of the trade\r\nin 1792, which he says may be between £200,000 and £300,000. I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that his estimate was purposely on the low side, for the\r\nmanufacturers of this date always lived in fear of special taxation. In\r\n1821 the export trade alone was worth £423,399 a year,[37] and in 1822\r\n£489,732.\r\n\r\nThe document runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Men necessary to make an oven of Black and Mottled, per week, and other\r\n  expences—\r\n\r\n                                                    £ s. d.\r\n  6 men, 3 at 4s. a week, and 3 at 6s.              1 10 0\r\n  4 boys at 1s. 3d.                                    5 0\r\n  1 cwt. 2 qrs.

Only two houses (meaning potteries) at\r\n  Stoke; Wards, and Poulsonson’s.”[39]\r\n\r\nIf this list is to be regarded as satisfactory evidence, and it must be\r\nremembered that it only professes to be a report of the fifty-year-old\r\nrecollections of old men, then it would appear that Burslem was still\r\nthe narrow home of the Potteries. It shows us the master potter of that\r\nday, employing 11 hands at wages not exceeding 6s. a week, working\r\nhimself, and out of his single oven-full a week making a profit of 10s.\r\nAs represented it is still a peasant industry. But the scope and range of\r\nthe pottery produced has increased since Dr Plot described “the greatest\r\npottery they have in this County.” The butter-pots; the cloudy, mottled,\r\nspeckled and black; probably the red dishes and pans; these all existed\r\nin Plot’s time; but what is the “moulded” ware made by Cartlich and\r\nThomas Taylor and by Dr Thomas Wedgwood, jun., in the middle of Burslem?\r\nThe stone ware too is new since Plot’s time. The five biggest factories\r\nall make this stoneware, Dr Thomas Wedgwood, sen., Moses Marsh, Aaron\r\nShaw, Moses Shaw, Sam. Edge and Richard Wedgwood, the brother of Dr\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this was the new salt-glazed stoneware. The brown stoneware\r\nascribed in the list to Dr Thomas Wedgwood coincides exactly with the\r\ndrab salt-glazed teapot by him now in the South Kensington Museum. It is\r\nsupposed to have been made by mixing the lightest burning local clay with\r\nthe fine white sand from Baddeley Edge or Mow Cop.[40]\r\n\r\nThe list gives no potworks at all at the Longton end of the district,\r\nyet then or shortly afterwards Delft ware was probably made at the place\r\ncalled Lane Delf, now part of Fenton. Shaw says that in 1710 Thomas\r\nHeath of Lane Delf was making a strange kind of pottery, and he proceeds\r\nto describe a particular dish in such a way as to show that it was\r\nreally Delft ware.[41] There is no trace of Delft ware having been made\r\nanywhere else in the Potteries, or indeed at any subsequent time at Lane\r\nDelf itself, so that we may fairly ascribe to this solitary experiment of\r\nThomas Heath’s the name of the locality.[42]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Salt glaze teapot, drab body, supposed to be by Thomas\r\nWedgwood, died 1737. From the Stoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\nAt this Longton end, soon after 1710, there was also made white ware\r\nof a greenish type, called Crouch Ware. It was made from clay found in\r\nDerbyshire that bore this name, and survived as a fairly white ware till\r\nAstbury drove it out with his whiter body. In 1725 Thomas Astbury, the\r\nyounger, set up his new factory in Fenton, and from this date we may say\r\nthat the whole of the present Pottery area was engaged in the production\r\nof Earthenware.[43]\r\n\r\nIn fact all that was wanted to convert the peasant pottery of North\r\nStaffordshire into a great business was the stimulus given by the\r\nrefined hand of Elers, and the new demand in the new clubs and coffee\r\nhouses. When once improvements in manufacture began, invention followed\r\ninvention; and though the records during the second quarter of the\r\neighteenth century are full of entries of patents, registered for the\r\nperformance of every possible and impossible pottery process, yet most of\r\nthe improvements—especially the vital changes in body and glaze made by\r\nAstbury and Booth—became public property unchecked by patent law.\r\n\r\nFirst there was Astbury’s new white body, made with a fixed mixture of\r\npowdered flint and Devon clay, imported on horseback from the sea-port of\r\nChester. Twenty years earlier the idea of bringing clay from Devon would\r\nhave been regarded as madness, and, even in 1720, carts could not get\r\nto Burslem, and the clay must have been brought inland on pack saddles.\r\nBut the invention of the calcined flint body meant also the invention\r\nof that terrible disease known as “potter’s asthma” or “potter’s rot,”\r\nwhich used to cause an even greater mortality than lead poisoning. When\r\nwhite flints were first used they were ground and powdered in the dry\r\nstate, in an atmosphere of flint dust, in underground cellars, so that\r\nthe secret of this valuable new preparation should not leak out.[44]\r\nThis state of things was soon partially remedied, for between 1726 and\r\n1732 several patents were taken out—by Gallimore, Bourne, and finally by\r\nBenson—for grinding the flint stones in water.[45] Benson’s final process\r\nhas survived to this day as the universal form of flint mill. A vertical\r\nshaft with four radiating arms revolves in a circular horizontal pan. The\r\npan, with a hard stone bottom of chert, is filled with water, and similar\r\nchert blocks, pushed round by the arms, grind the flints down to a cream.\r\nFlint grinding became an industry, and in the well-watered valleys of\r\nNorth Staffordshire, wherever there was both water-power and flint, these\r\nflint mills sprung up and flourished. Though most of them are now closed\r\ndown through the progress of railways and steam, there are some still to\r\nbe seen working in the Moddershall valley, whence the creamy slip is sent\r\nin by water-cart to Longton.\r\n\r\nAbout this same time a workman named Alsager perfected the potter’s\r\nthrowing wheel as we know it at this day.[46] And now that potters were\r\nusing these mixed ingredients, Devon clay, ground flint syrup, and native\r\nclay in special and patented proportions, the old method of evaporating\r\nthe slip under the sun in an open pan had to go. It is said to have\r\nbeen Ralph Shaw, a most litigious personage, who began specially to mix\r\nclays in a liquid form in a fire-heated trough—locked, of course, that\r\nno neighbour might discover the “mystery.”[47] This same Ralph Shaw, of\r\nBurslem, took out a patent in 1732, professing—as was almost common form\r\nin those days—to make earthenware like Chinese Porcelain. It was to be\r\nwhite within, and white when required without. It was made in reality by\r\ndipping the ordinary ware in a white clay dip—just the process Astbury\r\nhad invented some twenty years before. But there was this that was new to\r\nNorth Staffordshire; Shaw scratched away the white dip on the outside of\r\nthe jug so that the blue ground became visible. He produced indeed what\r\nthe mediæval Italians called “graffiato” ware, and very beautiful much of\r\nit is.[48]\r\n\r\nShaw, however, tried to prevent anybody using the white slip at all,\r\nand became such a nuisance to his neighbours that they united in 1736\r\nto take up the case of John Mitchell, of Burslem Hill Top, who was\r\nprosecuted by Shaw for infringing his patent.[49] Great was the rejoicing\r\nin the Potteries when the Judge at Stafford declared, or is reported to\r\nhave declared:—“Gooa whomm, potters, an’ mak what soourts o’ pots yoa\r\nleykin.” “An,” says our narrator, “when they coom ’nto’ Boslum, aw th’\r\nbells i’ Hoositon (Wolstanton), and Stoke, and th’ tahin, wurn ringin’\r\nloike hey go’ mad, aw th’ dey.” Ralph Shaw is said to have been so\r\ndisgusted at the result that he emigrated to Paris, where he made pots\r\nfor many years.[50]\r\n\r\nRalph Shaw’s ware was known as “bit-stone ware.” The “bit-stones” were\r\nput between two pieces of ware when they were fired in the saggars\r\nin order to keep them from sticking to each other. They were the\r\nmore necessary in that Shaw’s ware was dipped in a light slip. The\r\n“bit-stones” have long since been replaced by “spurs” and “stilts” and\r\nother small earthenware objects, the special manufacture of which is now\r\na great industry by itself. The single stilt and spur factory of Thos.\r\nArrowsmith in Burslem employs now 230 hands on this manufacture alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURSLEM IN 1750\r\n\r\nScale 100 yards to the inch\r\n\r\nBased on a plan by Enoch Wood]\r\n\r\nIf the old potters had had to rely only on the thrower’s wheel for their\r\nshapes, no improvement in whiteness of ware, or in the salt glaze, would\r\nhave availed much to increase the demand for earthenware. The development\r\nof the various use of moulds became of the greatest importance. The six\r\nworkmen required at such a potworks, as is shown on the 1710 list, would\r\nbe—slipmaker, thrower, turner, “stouker,” to put on handles and spouts,\r\nfireman and warehouseman. A good workman, such as the master, could\r\nthrow, turn and stouk. But the fresh developments of the salt-glazed\r\nstoneware arising from the use of moulds converted potting into a\r\nspecialized industry.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Elers used metal seals to press his ornamental\r\n“spriggs” on to his teapots. Such metal moulds could only be used for\r\nsmall articles or ornaments, for the mould stuck to the clay, and had to\r\nbe carefully oiled. Both for the “sprigging on” of ornaments, and for the\r\nshaping of ware, a new form of mould was wanted. At first the alabaster\r\nof Derbyshire supplied the want. It was carved into shaped blocks, and\r\nfrom the blocks were made “pitcher,” or porous clay moulds, which could\r\nbe replaced when worn out from the blocks, and could be used in various\r\nways for the manufacture of ware: for sprigging, pressing, or “casting.”\r\nThen—a last step—about 1745, Ralph Daniel, of Cobridge, brought from\r\nFrance the secret of plaster of Paris moulds which replaced both pitcher\r\nand alabaster.[51]\r\n\r\nUnder competition, the Staffordshire potters were getting critical. The\r\nwhite salt-glazed ware was competing with Chinese porcelain, and had to\r\nbe made as thin and light and transparent as possible. The ware made by\r\npressing the clay into the moulds sufficed for plates, basins and any\r\nlead-glazed ware, but it came out much too heavy for complicated shapes\r\nsuch as sauce-boats, teapots and vases, etc. To get these shapes Elers\r\nwould have had them thrown and turned down in the lathe: they would all\r\nhave been round. The process known as “casting” in a mould produced a\r\nfiner result, and gave infinite scope for variation. In casting, the\r\nclay is run in a liquid form into a porous mould. After standing a few\r\nminutes, the slip is run out again, leaving behind a clay shell. This\r\n“cast” shell, taken out when dry, may be as fine and as varied in shape\r\nas the skill of the potter and the heat of his furnace will permit.\r\n\r\nThe process of casting came into use about 1730, and the carving of these\r\nmoulds (in alabaster first, from which the “pitcher” mould could be\r\nmade), became the most critical operation of all the potter’s work. This\r\nwork required all the skill and artistic instinct of the carver and of\r\nthe designer. Block-cutters, as they were called, became famous. The best\r\nknown were the two brothers, Aaron and Ralph Wood of Burslem. Aaron Wood\r\n(1717-85) was bound apprentice in 1731 to Dr Thomas Wedgwood, some of\r\nwhose best models he is supposed to have made.[52] He afterwards worked\r\nfor J. Mitchell, of Burslem,[53] and for Wheildon of Fenton, acquiring\r\nsuch a reputation that he was allowed to work in a locked room, that his\r\nart might thereby be kept secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE FACTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industry was entering on a new phase. The introduction of moulds had\r\nrequired specialized block-cutters, flat and hollow-ware pressers and\r\ncasters. And the specializing in the mixtures of the clay body lead to\r\nfurther changes. Till 1740 the same clay body served for both salt glaze\r\nand lead glaze, but about this time manufacturers began to specialize in\r\neither salt _or_ lead glaze, and to use different bodies and mixtures to\r\nsuit the varied glazes.\r\n\r\nAnd, just as they had to arrange to import clays, so they had also to\r\narrange to export their wares. A London agent, a Liverpool agent, perhaps\r\na Birmingham agent became necessary. This sort of business could no\r\nlonger be carried on by a master potter on sixteen shillings a week. The\r\nmaster potter became a capitalist. No business could be successfully\r\ncarried on with a turnover of one ovenful a week. The first attempt\r\nto increase the output was made by either one Shrigley, of Burslem\r\nHadderidge,[54] or by John Mitchell of the Hill Top.[55] As no potter, so\r\ngoes the story, had ever had more than one oven, their inventive faculty\r\nwent no farther than to construct a larger oven than usual. The pioneer,\r\nwhoever he was, built a new one so large that it collapsed, to the great\r\njoy of his conservative rivals. Soon afterwards, however, the Baddeleys,\r\nsaid to have been the sons of a Moddershall flint-grinder, put up behind\r\ntheir factory at Shelton a row of no fewer than four ovens; and about\r\n1743, Thomas and John Wedgwood, known as “of the Big House,” built a\r\ntiled factory with five ovens.[56]\r\n\r\nThe family of Baddeley continued as master potters in Shelton into\r\nthe nineteenth century. They were, with the exception of Wedgwood and\r\npossibly Warburton, the largest exporters of earthenware of their\r\nday.[57] Their cream colour was good, but their renown with later\r\ngenerations is due to their basket-pattern salt glaze, often perforated.\r\nJohn Baddeley died in 1772, but the family carried on the making of\r\nenamelled and plain salt glaze to a later date than other manufacturers,\r\ncertainly after 1780, and good salt glaze of late date is usually\r\nascribed to the Baddeleys of Shelton.[58] The Wedgwoods of the Big\r\nHouse made the white salt glaze of a somewhat earlier description—the\r\ncast hexagonal cups and teapots in plain white—and with such financial\r\nsuccess, that they built for themselves in 1750 a “Big House” in Burslem,\r\nwhich stands to this day at the corner of the Market Place looking south\r\ndown the new Waterloo Road.[59] It is now the Conservative Club. Thomas\r\nwas an expert thrower to begin with, and John the best oven fireman in\r\nthe town.[60] They retired from business in 1765 with a large fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in 1750 no fewer than sixty factories were making salt\r\nglaze in the Potteries, and every Saturday, for five hours at the time\r\nof firing up, the whole country was black with the smoke of the burning\r\nsalt—so black, it is said, that people groped their way through the\r\nstreets of Burslem. But meanwhile Enoch Booth at Tunstall had invented\r\nthe fluid lead-glaze destined in time to turn plain earthenware into\r\n“cream-colour”; Josiah Wedgwood at Burslem was already devising new\r\nmixtures which should convert “cream-colour” into “Queen’s Ware”; and\r\nin Hot Lane, near by, John Warburton was starting that enamelling\r\nwork which, applied to the Queen’s Ware, was to make it the standard\r\nearthenware of the whole world. These three potters were to alter\r\nentirely the course of the industry, and make salt glaze a thing of the\r\npast, for museums and collections. Unfortunately they did not abolish the\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nEnoch Booth had married Ann, daughter of Thomas Child of Tunstall. It\r\nwas on his father-in-law’s land that, about 1745, he started the first\r\nconsiderable earthenware factory in Tunstall. Booth was the legitimate\r\nsuccessor of Astbury. He took the earthenware body, white as Astbury\r\nhad left it, and, instead of using it for salt glaze, he worked out the\r\nmost suitable lead glaze, and the best way of applying it to the piece.\r\nInstead of dusting it over the ware in the dangerous dry condition, he\r\nground the lead ore up with flint and clay and water. Into this fluid\r\nglaze the ware was dipped. Not only did this give a uniform glossy coat\r\non each piece of ware, but different pieces were all glazed alike.\r\nBooth had the ware dipped after it had been fired, while it was in the\r\nporous or “biscuit” condition but sufficiently firm to be handled. A\r\nsecond firing to fuse on the glaze was given to the ware after dipping.\r\nThese two firings, in the biscuit oven and in the “glost” oven, are the\r\nordinary processes of manufacture to this day. Shaw gives 1750 as the\r\ndate of this important improvement;[61] it is possible that fluid glazes\r\nwere used before this and by others, but it was the combination of fluid\r\nglaze and double firing that is important, and this with some certainty\r\nwe may put down to Enoch Booth and the year 1750.\r\n\r\nBooth’s original factory at Tunstall was probably the “Old Bank” at the\r\ncorner of Cross Street and Well Street, but he extended his works at an\r\nearly date over the whole of the area now bounded by Well Street, Market\r\nSquare, High Street and Calver Street, where he built the Phœnix Works.\r\nSometime before 1781[62] he had been succeeded by Anthony Keeling who had\r\nmarried his daughter Ann. Anthony Keeling built Calver House in 1793,\r\nbut his trade suffered in the French wars, and in 1810 he retired from\r\nbusiness and went to Liverpool where he died in 1816.[63] The Phœnix\r\nWorks were carried on by Thomas Goodfellow till they were pulled down\r\nabout 1860.\r\n\r\nWare, besides being thrown, moulded or cast, and coated with the\r\ntransparent glaze of salt or lead, requires decoration. This decoration\r\ncould be given by coloured clay slips, after the manner of the old Toft\r\ndishes, or after the manner of Ralph Shaw’s “graffiato” ware, or as what\r\nis called “scratched blue.” But decoration could also be given by means\r\nof enamelling paints. Paints that is which are mixed with glass, and, on\r\nbeing heated, fuse into the glaze and become fast. This enamelling was\r\nin the early days a special trade and no part of the potter’s business.\r\nThe shopkeeper might, if he liked, employ somebody called an enameller\r\nto enamel his particular cups and saucers. The enameller used a small\r\n“muffle” stove where the ware could be heated sufficiently to fuse the\r\nglaze and paint together, while at the same time it was kept away from\r\ndirect contact with flames or smoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scratched blue salt glaze cup, dated 1750. From the\r\nStoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\nThe best enamellers were to be found in London, engaged in enamelling the\r\nporcelain of Bow and Chelsea; but it soon became obvious that enamellers\r\nwere wanted in the Staffordshire potteries also. It was again two\r\nDutchmen who initiated into this art the native potters of Staffordshire.\r\nThey probably knew the Warburtons and set up their enamelling ovens\r\nnear them in Hot Lane.[64] Here they worked and attempted to keep their\r\nart secret, with the usual result of attracting special attention.\r\nTheir stoves, their mixtures and their temperatures soon became public\r\nproperty, and a regular enamelling industry was soon established round\r\nHot Lane. It is said to have been Ralph Daniel, the man who had brought\r\nthe secret of plaster of Paris moulds from Paris, who did most to develop\r\nenamelling.[65] He imported workmen from London, Bristol and Liverpool,\r\nand soon after 1750 the enamelling of earthenware and salt glaze became\r\na Staffordshire industry. Among enamellers too should be mentioned a\r\nShelton potter, Walter Edwards, who was chemist and enameller as well as\r\npotter. He had as partner the Rev. John Middleton, curate of Hanley from\r\n1737-1802, but Edwards, unlike the curate, died young in 1753, leaving a\r\nbook full of receipts for glazes and enamels. The difficulty always was\r\nto get metallic oxides which would stand heat.\r\n\r\nFrom an artistic point of view they had much better have left their\r\nsalt glaze plain white, or drab, or uniformly tinted by a slip dip. The\r\nsalt-glaze body compared with Chinese porcelain; their painting did not\r\ncompare with Chinese painting, or only compared in an unfortunate sense\r\nfor Staffordshire. Earthenware, being made for use, had less decoration,\r\nand what it got was less gaudy and more suited for serviceable articles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enamelled salt glaze jug, probably by Baddeley of Shelton,\r\ndated 1760. From the Stoke-on-Trent Museums. The jug was a presentation\r\npiece from the Rev. J. Middleton, who was a partner with the above\r\nBaddeley.]\r\n\r\nThere was however one very successful, or at least artistically\r\nsuccessful, manner of colouring the salt glaze. It was practised by\r\nWilliam Littler and Aaron Wedgwood (1717-1763), two brothers-in-law who\r\nabout 1740 were making salt-glaze pottery at Brownhills. Taking a hint\r\nfrom Astbury, they dipped their ware in a bath of carefully lawned\r\nslip, so as to gave it a smooth surface before firing. In this slip they\r\nproceeded to put cobalt, which gave a beautiful uniform blue to the\r\nwhole piece, and this smooth blue body, under the salt glaze, acquired\r\na tint of great brilliance. On the strength of Shaw’s account of this\r\nprocess,[66] many writers have mistakenly attributed to William Littler\r\nand Aaron Wedgwood the first introduction of liquid glazes, but it is\r\nquite clear, as Mr Burton has pointed out, that this was no leaded blue\r\nglaze, but a blue slip subsequently glazed with salt.[67]\r\n\r\nTheir success with the salt glaze induced Littler and Wedgwood to make\r\nthe first attempt to produce real porcelain in Staffordshire. The\r\nproper distinction between earthenware and porcelain is the complete\r\nvitrification of the body in the case of porcelain, as opposed to the\r\nvitrifying and glazing of the surface only in the case of earthenware.\r\n\r\nThe Bow porcelain factory had started in 1744, Chelsea in 1745, Worcester\r\nin 1751. In 1752 Littler and Wedgwood left their Brownhills factory and\r\nremoved to Longton Hall. Here they began to make the well-known Longton\r\nHall porcelain. Perhaps Wedgwood or Littler had worked at Chelsea.\r\nHowever that may be, the porcelain manufactured was of the Chelsea\r\ntype. The body was largely made of ground glass, while china clay,\r\nthe basis of true porcelain, was not used at all. The characteristic\r\nfeature of this Longton Hall porcelain is the bright under-glaze blue\r\nthat previously adorned Littler’s salt-glaze ware. This Longton Hall\r\nfactory only continued till 1758.[68] Owing to the lack of demand for\r\nthis kind of ware, they lost all their money in the venture and finally\r\ndiscontinued it. The stock-in-trade is said to have been bought up by\r\nDuesbury, who transferred it to the Derby porcelain factory, started in\r\n1756.[69] It was not till the discovery of China Clay and China Stone and\r\nof their fusing properties in 1768 that porcelain was again attempted\r\nin Staffordshire. Through his daughter Ann this Aaron Wedgwood was\r\nthe grandfather of William Clowes, known as the “founder” of Primitive\r\nMethodism.\r\n\r\nWhile the manufacture of salt glaze was flourishing, more especially\r\nat the northern end of the district, the old soft-fired earthenware,\r\nmottled, black and cloudy, was still being made, and the old slip\r\ndecorated ware had not entirely vanished. But the only famous potter in\r\nwhat might be called the old Staffordshire style was Thomas Whieldon.\r\n\r\nThomas Whieldon began making pots at Little Fenton about 1740. He was a\r\nbetter educated class of man than the ordinary potter. He potted well;\r\nenjoyed trials and experiments for their own sake; and, through his\r\nconnection with both Wedgwood and Spode, he may be said to have had the\r\nsame influence on the taste and education of the Staffordshire potters\r\nthat Elers had unintentionally half a century before. If we are to\r\nbelieve Shaw, writing in 1828, he began in a very humble way. He says:\r\n“In 1740 Mr Thomas Whieldon’s manufactory at Little Fenton consisted of a\r\nsmall range of low buildings, all thatched. His early productions were\r\nknife hafts for the Sheffield cuttlers; and snuffboxes for the Birmingham\r\nhardwaremen, to finish with hoops, hinges and springs; which he himself\r\nusually carried in a basket to the tradesmen; and being much like agate\r\nthey were greatly in request.”[70]\r\n\r\nPlot mentions how the old potters used to marble their ware by combing\r\ntogether the different coloured slips, just as the paper on the inside of\r\nbook-bindings is now marbled. Whieldon carried on this imitation work,\r\nand made it artistic and important. Instead, however, of marbling the\r\nslip or the glaze, he marbled his clay body in the solid. Flat “bats” of\r\nclay of different colours—coloured either naturally or else artificially\r\nwith manganese, cobalt or copper—were laid on each other, and pressed\r\nand sliced again and again; care being taken to preserve the same run of\r\nthe grain. In this way a streaked body was produced, which, when pressed\r\ninto moulds, retained the curious markings of agate or marble. This was\r\nWhieldon’s “solid agate,” with which the new trade in snuff boxes and\r\nknife handles was supplied.[71]\r\n\r\nHe made toys, too, and chimney ornaments of this same new material, or\r\nelse glazed with brilliant coloured glazes in splashes of irregular\r\ncolour. He made larger goods also—teapots, dishes and vases in solid\r\nagate. All these were pressed in moulds; and for moulder or block-cutter\r\nhe had, from about 1746 onwards, the celebrated Aaron Wood. The\r\ncream-coloured body, with Enoch Booth’s transparent lead glaze, afforded\r\nWhieldon another material on which to work. He took the colourless fluid\r\nglaze and turned it madder brown with manganese, or yellow with iron\r\noxide, or green with copper, or blue with cobalt. Then he mixed them\r\nto give every shade of coloured glaze, and laid these glazes on the\r\nware to give infinite variety. In this way he produced those beautiful\r\ntortoiseshell wares for which he is most renowned. His agate ware is\r\nsolid; his tortoiseshell ware is a glaze.[72]\r\n\r\nHe had acquired fame as a skilful potter before Josiah Wedgwood joined\r\nhim in 1754, and probably produced already both the solid agate and the\r\ntortoiseshell. In his last popular production—the melon, cauliflower,\r\nand pineapple wares, with their brilliant green glaze—it is probable that\r\nWedgwood’s incessant experiments played a decisive part.\r\n\r\nBesides having Wedgwood as a partner, he had in his employ such examples\r\nof the new race of potters as Josiah Spode, Robert Garner, J. Barker, and\r\nWm. Greatbach. Jewitt[73] has preserved for us some of the hiring books\r\nand accounts of Thomas Whieldon, in which the names and pay of three of\r\nthese four apprentices occur, and which, as they are unique evidence of\r\nwages, are here given:\r\n\r\n  1749\r\n\r\n  Jany  27  Hired Jno Austin for placeing white &c. per week    5 6\r\n            Pd his whole earnest[74]                            3 0\r\n\r\n  Feby  14  Then hired Thos.

It will be seen that there has been practically\r\nno increase in wages since the early days of the century. One wonders\r\nwhere Wedgwood and Spode obtained the capital wherewith to start their\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\nJosiah Wedgwood was Whieldon’s partner from 1754 to 1759. One of the\r\nstipulations of the partnership is said to have been that Wedgwood\r\nmight keep his experiments to himself. It is certain that he did\r\nexperiment extensively, and we may attribute to him the green glaze and\r\nsuccessful patterns of the “cauliflower” and “pineapple” wares.[77] It\r\nwould be a mistake to depreciate these patterns as being unsuitable\r\nand vulgar imitations of nature. The natural shapes were adapted and\r\nconventionalized in a thoroughly artistic way, as anyone who looks at\r\nWhieldon’s or Wedgwood’s samples of this ware preserved in the South\r\nKensington Museum can see at a glance. Slavish imitations there were\r\nlater, but that was not Whieldon’s way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Staffordshire figures decorated with Whieldon glaze,\r\nprobably by Wedgwood. _c._ 1760. Stoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\nTaste changed, however, and Whieldon’s wares became unfashionable. It is\r\nonly of quite recent years that the agate and marble, perfected later\r\nby Wedgwood, or the quaint cottage chimney ornaments and tortoiseshell\r\nware of Whieldon, Wedgwood and Ralph Wood, have come to be valued as\r\na native and genuine Staffordshire art. When Whieldon found that his\r\nmarket had left him he made no attempt to follow in the wake of his\r\npupils, and about 1780 retired from business. His factory was just south\r\nof the present railway station at Stoke, and he built and lived in the\r\nhouse which still looks down upon the Trent and the railway. In 1786 he\r\nserved as High Sheriff for the county. He died in 1798, and is buried at\r\nStoke. His widow died in 1828, and one of his sons, Edward, was for many\r\nyears Rector of Burslem, and lived at Hales Hall, near Cheadle. But his\r\ndescendants are now no longer to be found in the potteries.\r\n\r\nWe know of two other manufacturers who made agate and tortoiseshell\r\nware—Daniel Bird, called “the flint potter” because of his experiments\r\nwith different proportions of flint in the clay body,[78] and John and\r\nThomas Alders of Cliff Bank. There were probably many others. These two\r\nmade buttons and knife handles very largely. Both worked at the Stoke end\r\nof the Potteries.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the fresh epoch in the History of Potting which opens\r\nwith the work of Wedgwood, it will be as well to recount the end of the\r\nsalt-glaze industry. It was a risky manufacture. The ware was thin, and\r\nmany accidents happened in firing. Therefore the ware was costly; and\r\nonly small pieces could be so glazed. The fluid lead glazes used by\r\nthe skilful potters of the latter half of the century gave a surface\r\nsmoother and more suitable for food. The demand for ornamental salt glaze\r\nwas small, and the enormous demand for useful ware sent all the best\r\npotters into the useful trade; while in the ornamental lines Wedgwood’s\r\nGreek and Etruscan shapes entirely ruled the market. All these causes\r\nconspired to ruin the salt glaze, and by 1770 it had fallen into general\r\ndisuse. The last considerable makers of salt glaze were the Baddeleys\r\nand Christopher and Charles Whitehead of the Old Hall, Hanley.[79] No\r\nsingle maker of salt glaze occurs on the 1787 lists. It was a fine ware,\r\ncharacteristic of and peculiar to Staffordshire, and when one considers\r\nthe difficulties under which its production was carried on, a tribute of\r\npraise is due to those potters who so quickly developed it to its highest\r\nstate of perfection.\r\n\r\nShaw had an account, from the lips of an old man of eighty-three, born\r\nin 1720, showing the conditions under which this old-world industry was\r\ncarried on.[80] And before we come to the modern life with its canals\r\nand steam and complete “factory system,” it is worth while to give this\r\nrecollection of potting in 1750.\r\n\r\n“Ralph Leigh was employed by John Taylor of the Hill Top, to look after\r\nhis horses, and was the first man whose wages were raised from 10d. to\r\n12d. a day. With four or six horses he went twice to Whitfield, or\r\nthrice to Norton, in a day for coals; of which each horse brought 2½ cwt.\r\non its back; along lanes extremely dirty. At the pit, coals then cost\r\n7d. the draught, whether 2, 2½, or 3 cwt., for the colliers guessed at\r\nthe quantity. The charge for carrying each load from Norton to Burslem\r\nwas 3d., a penny a mile.[81] During a long time he carried crates of\r\npottery to Winsford, and brought back ball clay. Each horse carried a\r\ncrate on a pack saddle, and a small panier on each side was used to hold\r\ntwo or three balls of clay, weighing 60 or 70 lbs. Each horse was muzzled\r\nto prevent it biting the hedges, and the roads were narrow and bad and\r\nwithout toll gates. Afterwards with a cart and four horses he went to\r\nWinsford and delivered his crates the same day; and on the second day\r\nbrought back a ton of Chester clay to Burslem. He was allowed four days\r\nto take crates to Bridgenorth, and bring back shop goods for Newcastle.\r\nHe went with crates to Willington Ferry, and returned with flint,\r\nplaister stone and shop goods. He has gone to Liverpool and also as far\r\nas Exeter, before there were regular carriers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETRURIA WORKS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWEDGWOOD AND THE CREAM COLOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions under which the salt glaze of Staffordshire\r\nand the agate of Staffordshire were produced and perfected; and having\r\ntraced these manufactures to their climax, it now remains to describe\r\nthe rise of cream-coloured earthenware—the cream colour, which under\r\nWedgwood became universal and perfected as we know it to-day. But it\r\nwould be a mistake to attribute all good cream colour to Wedgwood. Just\r\nas all red teapots get put down to Elers; or as salt glaze is divided\r\nbetween Dr Thomas Wedgwood and Astbury according to character; and just\r\nas all another class of ware with irregular splashes of coloured glaze is\r\ncalled “Whieldon,” so much that Wedgwood never put his hand to has got\r\ndubbed with his name, to the exclusion of contemporaries as enterprising,\r\nsuch as Warburton and Turner, and to the neglect of predecessors who,\r\nlike Astbury and Booth, had already done very much to make Wedgwood’s\r\ndevelopment of the cream colour possible.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary earthenware cream-colour body was composed of ball clay\r\nfrom Dorsetshire, calcined flint, and the lighter burning local clays.\r\nAfter the discovery of china clay and china stone in Cornwall about\r\n1770, these two bodies both came to be added to the standard mixture,\r\nand the local clays were gradually dropped.[82] The glaze invented by\r\nJohn Greatbach while at Etruria, and called “Greatbach’s China Glaze,”\r\nfinally completed the development of the cream colour.[83] In practice\r\nthe results depended so largely upon the exact composition of body and\r\nglaze, the exact temperature of firing in biscuit and glost ovens, and\r\nthe subsequent decoration, that different potters achieved different\r\nresults from their cream ware, and very different reputations. Josiah\r\nWedgwood, with whom we must now deal, with his so-called Queen’s Ware,\r\nachieved undisputed pre-eminence, and became the greatest agent in the\r\nworld-wide distribution of the cream-coloured earthenware of North\r\nStaffordshire.[84]\r\n\r\nJosiah Wedgwood, thirteenth child of Thomas Wedgwood, master potter of\r\nthe Churchyard works in Burslem, was baptized in Burslem church on July\r\n12, 1730. He was a son, grandson and great-grandson of potters. His\r\nbrothers, his cousins and his uncles made pots, and many had left an\r\nenduring reputation behind them. Josiah too was apprenticed to the trade\r\nin 1744 in his eldest brother’s works by the Churchyard side at Burslem.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 he went into partnership with John Harrison, a tradesman of\r\nNewcastle, and they took the factory of the Alders’ at Cliff Bank, Stoke.\r\nHere they turned out the agate knife-blades and buttons that Alders had\r\nproduced before. In two years Wedgwood was able to leave this partnership\r\nand join with Whieldon, the best potter of the day. For five years at\r\nleast these two men were in partnership. Whieldon supplied the skill and\r\ntraditional knowledge, and Wedgwood the extraordinary energy which was\r\nhis chief characteristic. His experiments were incessant, and the fine\r\ngreen glaze seen on his cauliflower ware, his first real success, was his\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truly and affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nJ.

(_c._1626-1677)\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able to afford a factory of his own, he went back to\r\nBurslem, and in 1759 he hired, from his uncles John and Thomas Wedgwood\r\nof the Big House, a factory known as the Ivy House Works. Here, or at\r\nthe “Brick House” Works which he hired in 1762,[85] he made cauliflower,\r\ncream colour, and, later, black basalt ware. There worked for him at the\r\nIvy House Works a first cousin, Thomas Wedgwood, who afterwards became\r\nhis partner in the production of “useful” ware.\r\n\r\nA great number of the letters of Josiah Wedgwood have survived, and they\r\nshow the chief cause of his success to have been his restless passion\r\nfor experiment and novelty, coupled with an almost American love for the\r\nextension of business—particularly profitable business. He was first a\r\nskilful potter, secondly a pushing man of business, and only thirdly,\r\nperhaps, a great artist. When he broke with his stick some imperfect\r\nvase, saying, “That won’t do for Josiah Wedgwood,” it was not because\r\nthe delinquent vase offended his taste, but because it might damage\r\nhis reputation and the sale of his wares. He wanted perfection, and he\r\ngot perfection; but he wanted it to sell, as a business proposition.\r\nAnd when we find him wondering whether he can keep up the price of his\r\ncommon cream plates to four shillings a dozen, while the other potters\r\nhave brought their price for the same plates down to two shillings a\r\ndozen,[86] then we catch a glimpse of how well it paid.\r\n\r\nThe cream-coloured Queen’s Ware was the chief product of Wedgwood’s early\r\ntimes in Burslem. It was at first decorated, when required, by the widow\r\nWarburton, of Hot Lane. But the invention of the cheap method of printing\r\ndesigns on to the glazed ware, made in 1755 by Saddler and Green of\r\nLiverpool, provided an excellent substitute for enamelling on the more\r\nuseful ware. Wedgwood used to send his ware to Liverpool to be printed,\r\nand was often there himself, importing clay, or looking after the export\r\ntrade to America, then, as now, the most important branch of the export\r\ntrade. It was on one of these visits to Liverpool that he first met his\r\nlife-long friend, Thomas Bentley, a dissenting radical merchant of the\r\nClapham school, who became his partner in 1768.[87]\r\n\r\nWedgwood had moved entirely into the Brick House Works, afterwards called\r\nthe Bell Works, early in 1763, but in 1766 he bought the Ridge House\r\nestate of about 150 acres in Shelton, where he proceeded to build his\r\nnew “Etruria”—factory, dwelling house and village. The Etruria works\r\nwere opened for the production of the black basalt and other ornamental\r\nware in 1769, and here ever since his descendants have carried on the\r\nsame work. The factory at Burslem continued to produce the useful cream\r\ncolour, and in this branch of the business, his cousin Thomas Wedgwood\r\nwas his partner from 1766 till his death in 1788. In 1773, however,\r\nWedgwood, finally closed down the Burslem works, and transferred the last\r\nof the “useful” work to join the rest at Etruria.[88]\r\n\r\nWedgwood was now becoming famous. In 1765 he opened his first London\r\nwarehouse under the charge of his brother John. After John Wedgwood’s\r\ndeath in 1766,[89] he finally induced Bentley to take permanent charge\r\nof the London office and showrooms, which became a sort of fashionable\r\nlounge.\r\n\r\nBut that which chiefly brought Wedgwood before the public was his\r\ndetermination to secure better transport facilities to and from the\r\nPotteries. In 1762 he and others were busy pressing for a new turnpike\r\nroad[90] from Cliff Bank, on the Newcastle and Uttoxeter turnpike,\r\nthrough Burslem to the “Red Bull” at Lawton, on the London, Newcastle\r\nand Liverpool road.[91] The petition sent up on this occasion gives a\r\ndescription of the state of the industry which is worth quoting. The\r\npetition says:—\r\n\r\n“In Burslem and its neighbourhood are near 500 separate potteries for\r\nmaking various kinds of stone and earthenware, which find constant\r\nemployment and support for near 7000 people. The ware of these potteries\r\nis exported in vast quantities from London, Bristol, Liverpool, Hull\r\netc., to our several colonies in America and the West Indies, as well\r\nas to almost every port in Europe. Great quantities of flint stones are\r\nused in making some of the ware, which are brought by sea from various\r\nparts of the coast to Liverpool and Hull; and the clay for making the\r\nwhite ware is brought from Devonshire and Cornwall chiefly to Liverpool,\r\nthe materials from whence are brought by water up the rivers Mersey\r\nand Weaver to Winsford in Cheshire; those from Hull up the Trent to\r\nWillington; and from Winsford and Willington the whole are brought by\r\nland carriage to Burslem. The ware, when made, is conveyed to Liverpool\r\nand Hull in the same manner.\r\n\r\n“Many thousand tons of shipping ... are employed in carrying materials\r\nfor the Burslem ware; and as much salt is consumed in glazing one species\r\nof it as pays annually near £5000 duty to Government. Add to these\r\nconsiderations the prodigeous quantity of coal used in the Potteries ...\r\nand it will appear that ... those who are supported by the pot trade,\r\namount to a great many thousand people; ... and the trade flourishes so\r\nmuch as to have increased two-thirds within the last 14 years.”[92]\r\n\r\nThe determined opposition of the Newcastle tradesmen and inn-keepers,\r\nafraid of loss of traffic, prevented the full scheme being carried out.\r\nThe Bill, as passed in 1763, provided for the turnpike from Lawton as far\r\nas Burslem only.\r\n\r\nA Newcastle and Leek turnpike through the future Etruria and Cobridge\r\nfollowed. On February 1, 1765, we find Josiah Wedgwood writing to his\r\nbrother John in London, “we have another turnpike broke out amongst us\r\nhere betwixt Leek and Newcastle, and they have, _vi et armis_, mounted\r\nme upon my hobby-horse again.... He carried me yesterday to Leek, from\r\nwhence I am just returned much satisfied with our reception there.\r\nTomorrow I wait upon Sir Nigel (Gresley) to beg his concurrence, and\r\non Monday must attend a meeting to settle the petition etc. at Mony\r\nAsh at yr frd Isaac Whieldons. We pray to have the Utoxeter and Burslem\r\nturnpike joined [i.e. Cliff Bank, Shelton, Cobridge and Burslem], and to\r\nhave the road made turnpike from Buxton and Bakewell to Leek, and from\r\nLeek to Newcastle. Whether or not our good friends at Newcastle will\r\ngive us battle on this occasion we do not know, if they do there will be\r\nsome probability of my having a commⁿ and seeing the great City again.\r\n£2000 is wanting for this road. My uncles Thos. and John (of the Big\r\nHouse) have, I am quite serious, at the first asking subscribed ... _five\r\nhundred pounds_. I have done the like intending 2 or 300 of it for you,\r\nand if you choose any more you must let me know in time.”[93]\r\n\r\nWhat these roads were like one can gather from Arthur Young’s travels.\r\nHe describes the road from Knutsford to Newcastle as “in general a paved\r\ncauseway, as narrow as can be conceived, and cut into perpetual holes,\r\nsome of them two feet deep; a more dreadful road cannot be imagined....\r\nLet me persuade all travellers to avoid this terrible country....”[94]\r\n\r\nYet even these roads and lanes seem to have been moving with the times,\r\nfor we hear, in 1763, of one Daniel Morris introducing wagons and carts\r\nfor the first time, and acting as carrier.[95] “Pot-wagons” now took\r\ncrates of ware to Bewdley on the Severn and to Willington Ferry on the\r\nTrent. The general rate of transport was 9s. per ton for 10 miles. To the\r\nport of Liverpool the rate was 28s. per ton, but flint and clay up from\r\nLiverpool cost only 15s. a ton.[96] To Willington the charge was 35s. a\r\nton; and the transit down the river to Hull was almost as expensive.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bridgewater was at this time developing his estates in\r\nCheshire by means of the great Bridgewater Canal. In 1761 it was open\r\nfrom Manchester to Worsley, and James Brindley, “the schemer,” was\r\nengaged in extending it to tide-water below Warrington. Brindley was\r\nalready well known in the Potteries. He was born in the High Peak\r\nin 1716, and after serving his apprenticeship as a mill-wright at\r\nMacclesfield, and designing many improvements in spinning factories and\r\nmine drainage, he settled more or less in the Potteries. In or about 1758\r\nhe put up a windmill for grinding calcined flint on an estate called the\r\nJenkins, near Burslem, belonging to John Wedgwood of the Big House; and\r\nmany other pieces of engineering for the convenience of potters were\r\ninvented by him. But in 1759 he commenced, under the Duke of Bridgewater,\r\nthose 365 miles of canal which made his name famous.[97]\r\n\r\nActing under the orders of Lord Gower and Lord Anson, Brindley had, in\r\n1758, made a preliminary survey for a canal to connect the Trent and\r\nMersey. The success of the Bridgewater canal caused this project to be\r\nrevived in 1764, and an association was formed to obtain Parliamentary\r\npowers. In December of that year a meeting was held at Lichfield\r\nbetween Lord Gower and others, at which they discussed the conflicting\r\ninterests of the proprietors, the landlords, the manufacturers and the\r\npublic.[98] The scheme was dropped for that session, but all through 1765\r\nWedgwood, who saw the prime importance of this new method of transport,\r\nwas engaging support, combating the opposition of rival interests,\r\nand getting Bentley to issue pamphlet after pamphlet showing all its\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nAt last, on May 14, 1766, the Bill received the Royal Assent. On June\r\n3, a meeting of the proprietors was held, presided over by Lord Gower.\r\nThere were present Lord Grey, Mr Bagot, Mr Anson, Mr Gilbert, Mr Smith\r\nof Fenton, Mr Sam. Robinson and others. A committee was formed and the\r\nfollowing officers appointed:\r\n\r\n  “James Brindley, Surveyor General,    £200 per ann.\r\n  Hugh Henshall, Clerk of the works,    £150    ”\r\n  T. Sparrow, Clerk to the proprietors, £100    ”\r\n  Jos. Wedgwood, Treasurer,             £000    ”\r\n\r\nout of which he bears his own expenses, and it was ordered that the work\r\nbe begun on immediately, both sides of Harecastle and at Wilden.”[99]\r\n\r\nThe first sod was cut by Wedgwood on July 26 at Brownhills, between\r\nBurslem and Tunstall, before a great concourse of people, and we are\r\ntold that an ox was roasted whole for the populace.[100]\r\n\r\nThe Trent and Mersey canal is 93 miles long, with 75 locks, and rises at\r\nthe Harecastle tunnel to a height of 326 feet above the Mersey. It is 20\r\nfeet broad at the top, 16 feet at the bottom, and 4 feet 6 inches deep,\r\nand it cost £300,000.[101] It is carried on aqueducts over the Dove,\r\nTrent and Dane, and there are five tunnels. It was pushed on by Brindley\r\nwith great energy till his death, and completed at last in 1777 by Hugh\r\nHenshall, his son-in-law, together with a branch to the Severn from Great\r\nHaywood. Brindley died at Turnhurst in Wolstanton on Sept. 27, 1772.\r\nIn 1786 we read that freight for general goods on the canal was 1¼d.\r\nper ton per mile, or less than one-seventh what freight cost before the\r\ncanal was cut.[102] At the same time the £200 shares in the canal were\r\nstanding at £600-£700 apiece.[103] It was carrying over 1,350,000 tons of\r\ngoods and minerals a year in 1849, when it was bought out by the railway\r\ncompany for £1,170,000.\r\n\r\nA fresh development of the potting industry took place even while this\r\ncanal was building. China clay and china stone were discovered by\r\nCookworthy in Cornwall. This was in 1768, and Cookworthy took out a\r\npatent for the use of these materials. He never succeeded in producing\r\nporcelain on a commercial scale, and in 1773 sold his patent rights to\r\nRichard Champion.[104] Mr Champion was one of the chief supporters in\r\nBristol of Edmund Burke, member for that city, and conceived in 1775 the\r\nidea of getting with his aid a Bill passed through Parliament to extend\r\nthe patent which he had bought from Cookworthy for a further seven years.\r\nBut china clay and china stone had during these last few years been\r\nproved of value not only for making china, but also as a constituent\r\nof the clay body used for making the cream-coloured earthenware of\r\nStaffordshire. It had been imported and used by Wedgwood, Turner of Lane\r\nEnd, the Warburtons and others, and an extension of Cookworthy’s patent,\r\ngiving to Champion of Bristol the monopoly for seven more years of the\r\nright to use this material, whether for making china or earthenware,\r\nwas naturally resisted by the earth potters of Staffordshire. In this\r\nopposition Wedgwood and Turner took a leading part; and their action has\r\nbeen criticized by many who thought they saw in Champion the struggling\r\ninventor penalized by pushing capitalists. From another and as reasonable\r\na point of view Champion was a speculator who tried to use political\r\ninfluence to increase the value of a monopoly that he had bought on a\r\ndifferent basis. As Mr Burton says, “It certainly seems that the fullest\r\njustice was done when Champion was allowed an extension of the patent for\r\nthe use of china clay and china stone _in porcelain_, the only substance\r\never produced by Cookworthy or Champion, and the other potters were\r\nallowed to use the same materials in earthenware bodies.”[105]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM TURNER, MASTER POTTER\r\n\r\nFl.: 1780]\r\n\r\nYet for the part he played in this business John Turner was afterwards\r\nmade to suffer and in this manner. On Lord Gower’s estates he discovered\r\na clay which made a singularly hard white body, but the agent for the\r\nEarl, remembering, it is said, the action Turner had taken against\r\nChampion, told him he might look for his clays elsewhere, and refused to\r\nlet him work the clay.\r\n\r\nThe use of china clay and china stone, and the new glaze called\r\n“Greatbach’s china glaze,” completed the perfection of the cream-coloured\r\nearthenware, and Wedgwood drifted more and more away from the agate and\r\ncauliflower ware of his youth to the new body—the Queen’s Ware.[106]\r\nCream colour for the table—printed, enamelled or plain—became ever more\r\nimportant. In 1770 he received an order for an enormous dinner service\r\nfrom the Empress of Russia. Each piece was to have enamelled on it\r\na different view of some English gentleman’s seat. To complete this\r\nextraordinary order artists and enamellers were collected from the whole\r\ncountry, and set to work at Chelsea under Bentley’s guidance. The results\r\ndo not seem very attractive. A picture of a gentleman’s seat, generally\r\nin black or drab on a cream-coloured plate, is only interesting. A good\r\nborder pattern is the most suitable decoration for a dinner plate.\r\n\r\nHaving got his staff of enamellers together, Wedgwood decided to do his\r\nown enamelling in future instead of sending his ware to the Warburtons\r\nto be enamelled.[107] The sober border decorations of his tea and dinner\r\nware, which is to some tastes the very best part of his work, were done\r\nat Chelsea by these artists. His most successful patterns are mere\r\nenamelled borders, perfectly enamelled on perfectly potted plates.\r\n\r\nBut this was “useful” ware, and all the time he was aiming at the\r\ndevelopment of his ornamental ware along classical lines. The black\r\nbasalt—plain; the black basalt—decorated with encaustic red paintings\r\nunglazed, after the manner of the Etruscans; the jasper vases and\r\nplaques; all are attempts to reproduce the survivals of Greece and Rome.\r\nThis neo-classic style, if not original, was at least a change from the\r\nendless rococo of Dresden, and the shepherdesses of Chelsea and Sèvres;\r\nand, compared with the “art china” productions of the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century, the copies of even decadent Rome seem to be the acme\r\nof good taste. One is also tempted to regret that in them the whole art\r\nof the potter is devoted to the most exact reproduction of bronze, of\r\nParian marble, of natural cameos, or even of the glassy Barberini Vase.\r\nThe reproduction is splendid, and probably nothing would have shocked\r\nWedgwood more than to think that posterity could prefer his lavender tea\r\nservice, or the vine pattern on his Queen’s Ware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HACKWOOD, THE MODELLER]\r\n\r\nIt is however undoubtedly on his jasper that his fame with succeeding\r\ngenerations has been based:—the white classical figures, designed by\r\nFlaxman or by Hackwood, embossed on a blue or black ground. The discovery\r\nof the jasper body, with its admixture of barium sulphate, gave him a\r\nperfectly white hard stoneware body, which would take a high fire, and\r\nbecome semi-vitrified without glazing. The body could be stained light or\r\ndark blue, pink, green or black, by the addition of suitable oxides, and\r\nthen formed the ground of his jasper ware; while the white body, pressed\r\ninto small plaster moulds, taken out and then “sprigged on,” formed the\r\nornamental embossments. This jasper ware could be used, and is still\r\nfound, as panels in Adam fireplaces, with Flaxman’s “Dancing Hours” or\r\n“Medusa Head” clean cut on the blue plaque; as cameo medallions, bearing\r\nthe heads of personages of state, for show cabinets; or as vases under\r\na glass case, such as the Portland Vase, completed in 1790. And it is\r\nthis jasper ware that is called to mind when “Old Wedgwood” is spoken\r\nof by amateurs. A proper description is impossible here of these Jasper\r\nor Black Basalt vases, statues or plaques, in which he received the\r\ninvaluable assistance of Flaxman as a modeller, and the advice of every\r\ngentleman of the period who prided himself upon his taste. Description\r\nof manufacture and details of patterns must alike be left to special\r\nmonographs, such as that of Prof. Church.\r\n\r\nTo complete a bald account of Wedgwood’s career as a potter we must add\r\nthe following notes. Between the years 1759 and 1769 he perfected the\r\ncream colour, between 1766 and 1769 the black Etruscan ware was brought\r\nto its highest perfection; the jasper body and glaze was undergoing\r\ndevelopment from 1773 to 1777, and the jasper dip from 1780 to 1786. His\r\nmechanical bent showed itself in a persistent and successful effort to\r\ndevelop the turning lathe so as to give a ribbed surface to the ware.\r\nThis he called “engine turning,” and it is a device which has been\r\nlargely employed ever since on decorative pieces. In 1783 he invented\r\na neat pyrometre for registering the heat of ovens, and was elected in\r\nconsequence a Fellow of the Royal Society. His great partner Bentley died\r\nin 1780, and for a few years Wedgwood carried on his works alone; but in\r\n1790 he took into partnership his three sons John, Josiah and Thomas, and\r\nhis sister’s son Thomas Byerley. The style and title of the Firm which\r\nhad been “Wedgwood and Bentley” from 1768-80, “Wedgwood” from 1780-90,\r\nnow became for a short time “Wedgwood, Sons and Byerley.” In 1793 his\r\nsons John and Thomas, having no aptitude for the systematic work of a\r\nmaster-potter, and being rich enough to be idle, retired from the firm,\r\nand conveyed their shares to the younger Josiah. Till Thomas Byerley’s\r\ndeath in 1810, the firm was known as “Wedgwood, Son and Byerley.”[108]\r\n\r\nJosiah Wedgwood himself died on January 3, 1795. He bequeathed to his\r\nsecond son Josiah his share in the factory and an estate of 363 acres\r\nin Stoke and Hanley, and to his other children a fortune of about\r\n£160,000.[109] Mr Burton sums up the result of his work as follows: “His\r\ninfluence was so powerful, and his personality so dominant, that all\r\nother English potters worked on the principles he had laid down, and thus\r\na fresh impulse and a new direction was given to the pottery of England\r\nand of the civilized world. He is the only potter of whom it may truly\r\nbe said that the whole subsequent course of pottery manufacture has been\r\ninfluenced by his individuality, skill and taste.”[110]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF HANLEY IN 1800]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWedgwood’s financial success with his Jasper and Black Etruscan ware, a\r\nsuccess hitherto quite unique in the experience of the Potteries, led\r\nevery potter of any capacity to attempt the same lines. They cannot be\r\nblamed for trying to imitate what was demanded by the fashionable market.\r\nThe whole progress of the industry had been based upon the copying\r\nof successful processes, and Wedgwood did not patent his patterns or\r\nmethods, even could he have done so.\r\n\r\nAll over the Potteries they followed in his steps, content to reap\r\nwith little trouble the advantages of his past labours—reproducing\r\nhis patterns and avoiding all dangerous novelty. Invention died and\r\nthe wares, tamely and ignorantly copied by inartistic workmen, sank\r\nartistically throughout the next half century. The copyist, imitator or\r\nrival, who annoyed Wedgwood most in his lifetime was Humphrey Palmer\r\nof Hanley. Most of the Palmer and Neale ware we now know of seems\r\noriginal enough—and good enough—but from 1769-1776 Wedgwood regards him\r\nas a copyist of the most objectionable description.[111] It must be\r\nsaid however that he always stamped his imitations with his own name\r\nand not Wedgwood’s; a precaution which is not always observed at this\r\npresent day, even with a patent law to enforce a man’s right to his own\r\ntrade-mark. It is noticeable too that when Wedgwood did, in 1771, patent\r\nthe method of painting with an encaustic red on the Black Etruscan ware,\r\nPalmer produced the same results and forced him to share the patent\r\nrights.[112] Palmer however got into financial difficulties, in 1776, and\r\nhis business was taken over by his brother-in-law Henry Neale. Neale,\r\nin conjunction later on with David Wilson, continued the same style of\r\nornamental ware, and so excellent are some of his granitic ornamental\r\npieces now in museums that he must take rank as a rival rather than as\r\nan imitator of Wedgwood. Both Neale and Palmer had married daughters of\r\nthat Thomas Heath who tried to make Delft ware at Lane End early in the\r\ncentury. Another daughter is said to have married Mr Pratt, a potter of\r\nLane Delf, whose descendants have ever since continued to make pottery\r\non what may be the very spot where Thomas Heath made his original Delft\r\nware.[113]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vase by John Turner of Lane End. _d._ 1786. From the\r\nStoke-on-Trent Museums.]\r\n\r\nJohn Turner, of Lane End, was another competitor of Wedgwood. He was\r\nalmost as confirmed an experimenter, and produced a jasper ware very\r\nclose on Wedgwood’s heels. He was born in 1738,[114] and started his own\r\nworks at Lane End in 1762, and his chief productions were the fashionable\r\ncream colour and a cane-coloured stoneware. He was one of the first\r\nto appreciate the value of the newly discovered china stone for the\r\ncream-coloured body, and he therefore took an active part in opposing\r\nthe extension of Cookworthy’s patent. Afterwards, in 1775, he joined\r\nWedgwood in leasing some of the Cornish clay mines. A discovery of a\r\ngood local clay at Green Dock, close by Longton Cemetery, led to his most\r\ncharacteristic production—the cane-coloured stoneware, ornamented with\r\nembossed decoration in the same colour. The material was also found very\r\nsuitable for busts and statuettes. It is recorded that he could, in this\r\nmaterial, make a most life-like representation of pie-crust, and that\r\nonce, as a _tour de force_, he reproduced exactly an entire banquet with\r\neverything, from the roast beef to the custards, realistically translated\r\ninto stoneware. It will be understood from this that there was room for a\r\nrevival of taste in pottery. Turner’s jasper is quite different to that\r\nof Wedgwood, or of those who made it when the secret of the mixture had\r\nbecome known. Its ground is an unfortunate slaty blue, which does not\r\nimprove the appearance of the ware, and the designs of the bas-reliefs\r\nare rococo, which is worse than neo-classical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS MINTON\r\n\r\nc. 1765-1836]\r\n\r\nJohn Turner died in 1786, and was succeeded by his two sons, John and\r\nWilliam, who continued to produce black basalt as well as this strange\r\njasper. Their business was ruined by the French wars, and in 1803 they\r\nwere compelled to close down. John Turner, jun., became manager to Thomas\r\nMinton, then starting his historic factory in Stoke.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Turner went to Lane End in 1762. “About 1750,” says\r\nShaw, but probably some years later, “Mr John Barker, with his brother\r\nand Mr Robert Garner, commenced the manufacture of shining black and\r\nwhite stoneware salt glaze at the Row Houses, near the Foley, Fenton,\r\nwhere afterwards they made tolerable cream colour. They realized a good\r\nproperty here; and Mr R. Garner erected a separate manufactory and the\r\nbest house of the time in Lane End, near the old Turnpike Gate.”[115]\r\nThis was after 1762, for among the Wedgwood MSS. is an account of that\r\ndate from Messrs Robert Garner and J. Barker jointly for brown china\r\ntea-pots and pineapple jars supplied to Wedgwood at Burslem,[116]\r\ndoubtless to complete an order. Roger Woods too is said to have built\r\nin 1756 a factory, afterwards known as Sampson Bridgwoods, by the brook\r\nat the Lower Market Place in Longton. And about the same time Thomas\r\nand Joseph Johnson started making good salt glaze just opposite Lane End\r\nchurch.[117]\r\n\r\nIn this manner potting spread to the Longton end of the Potteries. In\r\n1756 there are said to have only been 100 houses in Longton and Lane\r\nEnd, and even by 1773 an old estate map of the Heathcotes’ shows but 180\r\nhouses, or a population of less than 1,000.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1770 we obtain a familiar glimpse of the working of the\r\nfactory system. Some of the master-potters in that year tried, for the\r\nfirst time on record, to form a ring to keep up prices. The bond runs as\r\nfollows: “We whose hands are hereunto subscribed do bind ourselves ...\r\nin £50 ... not to sell ... under the within specified prices, as witness\r\nour hands: John Platt, John Lowe, John Taylor, John Cobb, Robt. Bucknall,\r\nJohn Daniel, Thos. Daniel jun., Richd. Adams, Saml. Chatterley, Thos.\r\nLowe, John Allen, Wm. Parrott, Jacob Warburton, Warburton and Stone, Jos.\r\nSmith, Joshua Heath, John Bourn, Jos. Stephens, Wm. Smith, Jos. Simpson,\r\nJohn Weatherby, J. and Rd. Mare, Nic. Pool, John Yates, Chas. Hassells,\r\nAnn Warburton and son, Thos. Warburton, Wm. Meir.” A list of prices\r\nfor dishes, tureens, saucers, etc., is given; and manufacturers of the\r\npresent day will be interested to see the first attempt at checking those\r\n“rebates” which have successfully broken down this and all subsequent\r\nattempts to keep prices artificially high. “To allow no more than 5\r\nper cent for breakage, and 5 per cent for ready money.” Then follows a\r\nsentence which misled Shaw and made him think that these potters made\r\nsalt-glaze stoneware: “To sell to the manufacturers of earthenware at\r\nthe above prices, and to allow no more than 7½ per cent, beside discount\r\nfor breakage and prompt payment.”[118] It was the custom of many,\r\nparticularly the larger manufacturers, to buy ware from other makers,\r\neither to decorate, or, more usually, to complete orders in lines which\r\nthey did not happen to have in hand; (orders were far more all-embracing\r\nin those days). Thus we find William Greatbach starting a works at Lower\r\nLane in 1762 under an agreement with Wedgwood to be paid by him fixed\r\nprices for his ware.[119] In any case Shaw is obviously wrong in calling\r\nthese men salt-glaze potters, for makers of salt glaze did not usually\r\napply it to the baking dishes and chamber pots whose prices were under\r\ndiscussion; and it is only in common and standard lines that prices can\r\never be regulated by a ring. Makers of ornamental salt glaze would have\r\nbeen the last people to combine, and the only ones known to have been\r\nmaking salt glaze at this time, Christopher Whitehead and the Baddeleys,\r\ndo not appear on this list of Shaw’s at all.\r\n\r\nThe most notable potters on this list of 1770 were the Warburtons and\r\nthe Daniels of Cobridge. When the art of enamelling became localized\r\nat Hot Lane about 1750, John and Ann Warburton were among the most\r\nsuccessful. They were potters of old standing, for a Warburton appears\r\nas a master-potter in the Burslem district in 1710-15. They did most\r\nof the enamelling for Wedgwood in his early days, and their son, Jacob\r\nWarburton (1740-1826), became a potter of great repute, above all on the\r\nContinent where his business was very extensive.[120] He spent many\r\nyears travelling abroad and was a strange man among the rough potters\r\nof that day—a Roman Catholic, a great linguist, a famous skater; and\r\nfor some reason he was always known as Captain Warburton. He was an\r\nintimate friend of Wedgwood, and in 1771 acted as his arbitrator in his\r\ncase against Palmer.[121] When Enoch Booth invented the fluid glaze, the\r\nWarburtons were among the first to take it up, and their cream-coloured\r\nware, enamelled with all their exceptional artistic skill, is often\r\nconfounded with Wedgwood’s best productions.\r\n\r\nBut to Jacob Warburton the Potteries are chiefly indebted for the\r\nrevival of Littler’s attempt to introduce the manufacture of hard paste\r\nporcelain into Staffordshire. It will be remembered that Richard Champion\r\nof Bristol had in 1775 obtained an extension of his monopoly of the use\r\nof china clay and china stone in the manufacture of porcelain. In spite\r\nof this monopoly he met with but little success in Bristol, and in 1781\r\nhe sold his patent to a company in Staffordshire—the first instance\r\nrecorded of a potting company. Of this company Jacob Warburton was the\r\nmoving spirit. After John Turner, of Lane End, and Anthony Keeling,\r\nof the Phœnix Works in Tunstall, had withdrawn from the scheme, the\r\ncompany—consisting then of Warburton, Sam. Hollins (the red china potter\r\nof Shelton) and two financiers—settled their manufactory at Shelton New\r\nHall.[122] Their porcelain is always spoken of as “New Hall China,” but\r\nit was of little importance or artistic merit. John Daniel, son of that\r\nRichard Daniel who had introduced plaster of Paris moulds from France,\r\nwas appointed manager and became a partner some years before his death\r\nin 1821.[123] Jacob Warburton himself died at Rushton in the old Abbey\r\nGrange in 1826, but even before that time the manufacture of hard paste\r\nporcelain at the New Hall had ceased.[124]\r\n\r\nAnother enameller who attained success by perfecting the cream-coloured\r\nware was Elijah Mayer. He is said to have been originally foreign agent\r\nfor the Chatterleys, and as late as 1787 he appears as an enameller pure\r\nand simple, though already in business on his own account. Soon after\r\nthis date his factory at Hanley began turning out not only cream colour,\r\nadmirably enamelled in the sober artistic style of Wedgwood’s best\r\nQueen’s Ware, but also black basalt, which is every bit as good and has\r\nas good a reputation as the best that was turned out at Etruria.[125]\r\n\r\nOther very early makers of porcelain were Messrs Baddeley and Fletcher.\r\nFor some time after 1763 they attempted, with William Littler as manager,\r\nto make glassy porcelain similar to that of Longton Hall. Mr Fletcher was\r\nthe father of Sir Thomas Fletcher, M.P. for Newcastle, and ancestor of\r\nthe Fletcher-Bougheys, Baronets of Aqualate. Mr John Baddeley the elder\r\nwas the father of Ralph and John Baddeley, who carried on the works and\r\nmade an early success with blue printed earthenware.[126]\r\n\r\nThe Chatterleys of Shelton were another very successful potting family\r\nof this date. Dr Samuel Chatterley made the ordinary black Egyptian\r\nteapots, but Charles Chatterley went in for the newer cream colour\r\nand secured a large foreign connexion. His brother Ephraim became his\r\npartner, and ultimately carried on the business alone till 1793, when\r\nhe handed it over to his nephews, James and Charles Whitehead, sons of\r\nChristopher Whitehead of the Old Hall Factory.[127] Ephraim Chatterley\r\nlived at what is now Chatterley House, and had the singular distinction\r\nof being, in 1784, the first of a long and honourable series of “mock\r\nmayors” of Hanley.[128] Though Hanley and Shelton were united in 1812,\r\nyet it was not till 1856 that they became incorporated as a borough, and\r\nobtained their first genuine Mayor, John Ridgway of Cauldon Place.\r\n\r\nThe list of potters of 1787, which has already been quoted from, occurs\r\nin a rare “Survey of Staffordshire” made by Wm. Tunnicliffe. The Survey\r\nconsists of little but an itinerary of the main roads, and lists of the\r\nmanufacturers in each town. As we have to rely so much on the fallible\r\nrecollections of Shaw, this piece of contemporary evidence is worth\r\nquoting in full.\r\n\r\n    “Survey of the Counties of Stafford, Chester and Lancaster,\r\n    compiled and published at Namptwich in 1787 by Wm. Tunnicliffe,\r\n    land surveyor, of Yarlet near Stone; and a Directory of the\r\n    principal merchants and manufacturers.”\r\n\r\n    In the Potteries they give:—\r\n\r\n    Burslem.\r\n      (a) Wm.

Josiah and Thomas Wedgwood potted at\r\nEtruria, not Fenton; John Turner, shown at Fenton, should probably be\r\nthe Turner of Lane End; the Josiah “Wood” of Burslem is almost certainly\r\nJosiah Wedgwood, who owned at that time the old Churchyard Works, in\r\nwhich he had been born. (They were sold in 1795 to Thomas Green, and\r\non his bankruptcy in 1811 passed to John Moseley). Again, both S. and\r\nJ. Cartlich, and Wm. Adams, who certainly potted at Golden Hill and\r\nGreengates respectively, are included with other Tunstall potters in the\r\nBurslem list.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM ADAMS\r\n\r\n1777-1805]\r\n\r\nThis William Adams of Greengates (1745-1805)[129] achieved a great\r\nreputation for his Jasper and Black Basalt ware. He was a cadet of\r\nthe Adams family, a family which is almost as much identified with\r\nthe potting industry as is the family of Wedgwood. Four generations\r\nhad potted at Burslem “Brickhouse” in succession to Thomas Adams who\r\ndied a “potter” in 1629, and at the end of the eighteenth century the\r\nrepresentative of this branch of the family, another William Adams, was a\r\nmaster-potter at Cobridge, and could lay some claim to the introduction\r\nof under-glaze blue printing into Staffordshire. The life of Adams of\r\nGreengates is given in “William Adams—an old English Potter,” Ed. by\r\nWm. Turner, F.S.S. Born in 1745, he was apprenticed to Josiah Wedgwood,\r\nand became his most adept pupil. He commenced manufacturing on his\r\nown account at Greengates about 1787, and the jasper he turned out is\r\ndifficult to distinguish from that of Wedgwood. No doubt he had full\r\nparticulars of body and firing, but other potters had that information\r\nand yet failed to produce the same class of ware.[130] This William Adams\r\ndied in 1805, and his son wasted his property and sold the Greengates\r\nworks about 1820 to John Meir.[131] Of recent years, however, the\r\nGreengates works have been repurchased by the senior branch of the Adams\r\nfamily, and it is now managed in conjunction with their old Greenfield\r\nworks adjoining.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in 1787 the mail coaches to London began to run daily.\r\nThe best days of coach travel were yet to come, but even these early\r\ncoaches kept up a steady seven miles an hour. Their time table is given\r\nas follows: London (“Swan with Two Necks”) 9 p.m., St Albans 11 p.m.,\r\nCoventry 9 a.m., Lichfield 1 p.m., Stone 5 p.m., Newcastle (149 miles) 7\r\np.m., Warrington 2 a.m., Carlisle 2 p.m.[132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN WOOD OF BROWNHILLS\r\n\r\n1746-1797]\r\n\r\nThree other potters on the 1787 list deserve special mention: John, Ralph\r\nand Enoch Wood. They all came of one still celebrated potting family.\r\nRalph Wood, miller, of Burslem, was their common ancestor. His eldest\r\nson, Ralph, was a modeller of distinction, and about 1754 started a works\r\nat Burslem, where he, and his son Ralph after him, made those quaint\r\nStaffordshire figures now in such demand. They are usually decorated\r\nwith coloured tortoiseshell glaze, applied with a brush, and have a\r\nsingularly decorative effect. Ralph Wood, the first figure maker of the\r\nname, married the sister of that Aaron Wedgwood who had once made china\r\nat Longton Hall. He died in 1772, and was succeeded in his work by his\r\nsons John and Ralph.[133] John Wood soon left his brother, and began, in\r\n1782,[134] to pot at Brownhills. Ralph kept to figures, and adopted the\r\nenamel process of decoration for some of his busts and figures. Other\r\nmakers who were prolific in this style of figure decoration were John\r\nWalton of Burslem (1800-40), Robert Garner of Lane End, _c._ 1786, son of\r\nthat Robert Garner of the Foley Works who married Margaret Astbury, Ralph\r\nSalt of Hanley (1812-46), Lakin and Poole of Hanley (1770-94).[135]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the eldest son, John Wood, was making ordinary earthenware at\r\nBrownhills. This John Wood was murdered in 1797 by Dr Oliver of Burslem,\r\na rejected suitor of his daughter.[136] His son married the heiress of\r\nJohn Wedgwood of Bignal End, with whom he acquired a large fortune.[137]\r\nHe removed the factory from Brownhills to Tunstall, where he erected the\r\nWoodlands Works in 1831-5.[138] A third John Wedg Wood of Brownhills\r\ncarried on these pot works in Tunstall in partnership with Mr Edward\r\nChallenor. He died in 1857, and was succeeded at the Woodlands Works by\r\nhis brother Edmund Thomas Wedg Wood. This factory was in 1887 sold to Mr\r\nW. H. Grindley.[139]\r\n\r\nRalph Wood, the miller, had another son—that Aaron Wood who made for\r\nhimself so great a reputation as a block cutter when block moulds were\r\nfirst introduced and the salt glaze was at the height of its glory. Aaron\r\nWood worked for Dr Thomas Wedgwood, Thomas Mitchell of the Hill Top\r\nWorks, Burslem, and for Whieldon of Fenton. His eldest son, William, was\r\napprenticed to Josiah Wedgwood in 1762, and worked with him, first at\r\nthe Burslem “useful” works, and afterwards at Etruria, all his life long.\r\nMost of the Queen’s Ware articles made by Wedgwood are said to be from\r\nblock moulds of his carving.[140]\r\n\r\nBut it was the youngest son of Aaron Wood, Enoch by name, to whom potters\r\nof all time are most indebted, for he was the first collector of pottery.\r\nAnd he collected it to illustrate specially what his family and district\r\nhad done, and how the industry had progressed. His splendid collection\r\nwas never catalogued, and as it was divided into four parts at his death\r\nand scattered,[141] it is of less value than it ought to have been; but,\r\nwithout it, this or any account of the North Staffordshire Potters’ work\r\nmust have been a shadow indeed.\r\n\r\nEnoch Wood (1759-1840) was apprenticed to Palmer of Hanley and remained\r\nthere some time as a modeller. In 1783 he commenced business at\r\nFountain Place, Burslem, so called from the fountain or pump which he\r\nerected there for his factory and work people.[142] He was at first\r\nin partnership with his cousin Ralph Wood, who made the Staffordshire\r\nfigures. About 1790 he was joined by James Caldwell of Lindley Wood,\r\nand the firm became “Wood and Caldwell.” He bought Mr Caldwell out in\r\n1819, and thenceforth conducted business as “Enoch Wood and Sons.” He\r\nhad 12 children and died in 1840 at Fountain Place, the patriarch of\r\nthe Potteries. His most famous work probably was the well-known bust of\r\nJohn Wesley, made in 1781 when Wesley was stopping at his house during\r\none of his preaching tours in the Potteries. His factory turned out the\r\nusual cream colour, black basalt and jasper,[143] but soon after his\r\ndeath the firm got into financial difficulties and closed down. His third\r\nson, Edward, was fortunate in being associated with a clever Italian,\r\nCount Kuntz, in the development of Italian borax, introduced into the\r\nPotteries first in 1828 as a flux for the glaze. In this new business\r\nthey realized a fortune, and Edward Wood’s descendants are now settled at\r\nBrowhead in Cumberland. But the borax works in Newcastle are carried on\r\nas “H. Coghill and Son” by Douglas and Archibald Coghill.\r\n\r\n  Aaron Wedgwood, Brother of Thomas and John of the Big House, Burslem.\r\n   |  (1695-_c._ 1725)\r\n   |\r\n   +-Mary Wedgwood (1715-1756) = -----------------------------------------+\r\n                                                                          |\r\n  Ralph Wood, Miller of Burslem, (1677-1753) = Elizabeth.                 |\r\n   |                                                                      |\r\n   +-Ralph Wood, Master Potter of Burslem (Figure maker).

But the eighteenth century was the age of\r\nmechanical invention, and the hand artists were continually being\r\nsuperseded by mechanical processes. Saddler and Green, for instance,\r\ninvented the method of printing designs on top of the glaze, so that\r\nthe artist had only to fill in the outline with colours. But there was\r\nsomething hard and crude about the effect of the on-glaze printing, which\r\nprevented it ever really competing with the best hand-painted ware. The\r\nunder-glaze printing, particularly the under-glaze blue printing, was a\r\nmore difficult competitor for the artist to meet; for the glaze gave a\r\nrich soft tone to the colouring matter underneath it which was partly\r\nabsorbed in the biscuit ware. And if this blue printing, with which the\r\nwillow pattern will be always associated, drove out the girl artists\r\nfrom their pleasant work on the pot-banks, yet the new decoration caused\r\nan enormous expansion in the demand for cream-coloured earthenware. From\r\n1790 onwards “blue printed” seems to have superseded every other sort of\r\nearthenware. It was the first opportunity common folk had had of getting\r\na decorative plate to eat off; and it made the fortunes of the Spodes,\r\nthe Adamses, the Bournes, the Mintons, the Ridgways, and many another\r\nmaster of the good old days. As a mechanical process under-glaze printing\r\nwas an unqualified success, and in course of time the artists too\r\nrediscovered their work in decorating that porcelain which, on the tables\r\nof the rich, replaced the now vulgarized earthenware. The last ten years\r\nof the eighteenth century were devoted to blue printed, but with the new\r\ncentury came that development of Staffordshire porcelain with which run\r\nthe names of Spode, Minton and Davenport.\r\n\r\nThe first Josiah Spode made no porcelain. He set the fashion in “blue\r\nprinted,” and his blue printed is probably the best of its kind ever\r\nmade. Born in 1733, Spode was apprenticed to Whieldon, and after leaving\r\nhim about 1759 he worked for Banks of Stoke.[144] It is said of him\r\nthat he dearly loved to play the fiddle, and he would go out any evening\r\nto play at public-houses for his friends. So that “ready and willing as\r\nSpode’s fiddle” became a proverb in the Potteries.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 he leased Banks’ works in the centre of Stoke, and began making\r\nprinted cream colour. This was the old “on-glaze,” or “black” printed\r\nware, used to guide the enameller rather than as a decoration by itself.\r\nCobalt was a cheap paint, and the designs were filled in with blue. This\r\nwas becoming the common ware, and invention was busy to simplify the\r\nprocess. Attempts were made by William Adams of Cobridge and, about 1777,\r\nby John Baddeley of Shelton to print in blue upon the biscuit ware before\r\nthe ware was glazed, but without any commercial success.[145] It was\r\nTurner of Worcester who first found a satisfactory way of transferring an\r\noily-coloured pattern from a copper plate to a sheet of transfer paper,\r\nand then from the paper to the biscuit ware. He too designed the willow\r\npattern which seems likely to characterize “blue printed” for all time.\r\nThis was in 1780, and in 1783 Spode got two men from the Caughley china\r\nworks, near Worcester, and they taught him to print in blue under the\r\nglaze on earthenware, as they did on china at Worcester. The invention\r\nspread with enormous rapidity and Spode made his fortune. He died in\r\n1797,[146] leaving his son Josiah Spode II to carry on his business.\r\n\r\nThe second Spode married in 1779 the eldest daughter of John Barker,\r\nmaster potter of the Row Houses, Fenton. He had been a dealer in\r\nearthenware, glass and china in London. William Copeland, a native of\r\nStoke, had been his traveller and assistant in London. On his father’s\r\ndeath young Spode made Copeland his partner and put him in charge of the\r\nLondon office. Even in his father’s lifetime Spode had begun decorating\r\ntheir ware with the Japan reds and blues and heavy gilding that was\r\nafterwards the distinguishing mark of Spode and Copeland porcelain; and\r\nin 1800 they began to make their bone-paste porcelain.[147]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSIAH SPODE\r\n\r\n1754-1827]\r\n\r\nPorcelain is a transparent vitreous body which fuses on being fired, and\r\ndoes not require any glaze. The early porcelain had been made largely\r\nof glass; Cookworthy’s porcelain, and that made at Shelton New Hall,\r\nrelied solely on china clay and china stone from Cornwall. None of these\r\nbodies were certain, and they failed to become commercial successes. But\r\nwhen the New Hall Company ceased, the manufacture of their hard-paste\r\nporcelain in England ceased too, and an entirely new porcelain body was\r\ndestined to take its place. It was not until Spode introduced bone into\r\nthe body that the cheap china we know to-day could be produced.[148]\r\n\r\nThe modern soft-paste bone porcelain consists of nearly equal portions\r\nof china clay, china stone and bone ash, fired to a temperature of\r\nabout 1250 C. and then glazed with a feldspar and china-clay glaze\r\nand refired.[149] The chief porcelain factories at this time were at\r\nWorcester and Derby, but they were soon outdistanced and beaten by the\r\nbetter conducted factories of Spode, Minton and Davenport, who managed to\r\ncentre the china trade in North Staffordshire, just as the earthenware\r\ntrade had been localized there in the previous century.\r\n\r\nTo modern taste all the china of the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, with its florid colouring and lavish gilding, seems to warrant\r\nlittle success or praise. In their own day however the success of the\r\nSpodes was very great. The second Spode died in 1827; William Copeland\r\nhad died in the previous year, and in 1833 a third Josiah Spode died\r\nalso. From the executors of the last Spode the whole factory was bought\r\nby William Taylor Copeland, M.P., the second of the name, Alderman of the\r\nCity of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERBERT MINTON\r\n\r\n1793-1858]\r\n\r\nMintons have long been the historic rivals of Copeland, late Spode. Their\r\nfactories are almost side by side in Stoke, lying along the Newcastle\r\ncanal, which was cut in 1795. Just across the Trent, too, lay Whieldon’s\r\nold works at Little Fenton. Wedgwood, in his list of the potters of\r\n1715, says that there were then only two factories in Stoke—Ward’s and\r\nPoulson’s. He meant probably that the factories carried on when he\r\nwrote in 1785 by Ward and Poulson were in existence in 1715. However\r\nthat may be, in 1793 Thomas Minton, financed by a Mr Pownall, joined\r\nJoseph Poulson, a practical potter already at work, and began to make\r\n“blue-printed” ware at Stoke.[150] A few years later they began to make\r\nporcelain. In 1802 the firm was “Minton, Poulson & Co.,” and by 1817 it\r\nhad become “Thomas Minton & Sons.” This first Minton died in 1836, and it\r\nwas his son, Herbert Minton (1793-1858), that brought the Minton china to\r\nits highest perfection, and started the manufacture of encaustic and dust\r\ntiles.\r\n\r\nA word should be said here on the methods of gilding—so marked a feature\r\nof both Spode and Minton china. Originally, when gilding was put on\r\nthe ware, it was laid on in the form of gold-leaf, and attached with\r\nprinters’ size. This sort of gilding does not usually wear well, and it\r\nwas only in his very late years that Wedgwood began to burn gold into\r\nthe ware.[151] About 1790, the method of painting on the gold with\r\nmercury, and burnishing it afterwards, was introduced from the Continent,\r\nand a new decoration was super-imposed upon the already overladen ware.\r\nIt is only within the last decade that a form of liquid gold has been\r\ndiscovered which requires no burnishing, and yet is fairly durable.\r\n\r\nAnother form of decoration in which gold was employed was lustre ware. Mr\r\nBurton thinks the application of a gold lustre to Staffordshire pottery\r\nwas introduced first about 1792 at Etruria, and was used on Wedgwood’s\r\n“Pearl” dessert ware, made in the form of shells. If this lustre, or\r\nsilver lustre, is laid on thickly, it converts the earthenware in\r\nappearance into gold or silver plate—an inartistic transformation. When,\r\nhowever, the lustre is thinly applied, the glaze of the ware is _stained_\r\nto a purplish-pink colour, on which the metallic lustre sparkles like\r\nshot silk. The newly discovered metal platinum was used to produce the\r\nsimilar silver lustre, and during the period 1792-1810 many fine pieces\r\nwere produced by the Wedgwoods (and by, among others, John Aynsley of\r\nLongton), covered with either the gold or silver plating or lustre.[152]\r\n\r\nOther Stoke potters at the end of the eighteenth century were the Booths\r\nof Cliff Bank, and Thomas Woolfe. Their factories are both shown on\r\nthe map of the Potteries in 1802 which is here inserted. Hugh Booth\r\n(1732-89)[153] made a considerable fortune, and was succeeded by his\r\nbrother and nephews, Ephraim, Hugh and Joseph Booth. Thomas Woolfe (died\r\n1818)[154] contests with the elder Spode[155] the credit of being the\r\nfirst to employ steam power in their factories, to drive the flint and\r\nglaze mills. Both Aikin and Shaw agree in dating this innovation about\r\n1793. Woolfe’s son-in-law, Robert Hamilton, joined the firm for a time,\r\nbut before 1817 the factories of both Woolfe and the Booths had passed\r\ninto the hands of William Adams (1772-1829), the successful progenitor of\r\nthe present potting family of Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMETHODISM AND THE CAPITALISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet another Staffordshire family founded on “blue-printed” ware is that\r\nof Ridgway. Ralph Ridgway was a master-potter at Chell, who failed in\r\nbusiness in 1766, and departed with his family to Swansea, where the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain was just commencing.[156] His younger son,\r\nJob (1759-1813), returned to the Potteries in 1781, and divided his\r\ntime between acting as a Wesleyan missionary and work as a journeyman\r\npotter in Hanley.[157] There for some time he also manufactured lawn for\r\nthe sieves used in sifting the clay slip, but this he gave up, on the\r\nstrange ground that it led to bribery and drunkenness, and returned to\r\nhis potter’s bench. At last, in 1792, he and his brother George started\r\na factory of their own in Shelton, at the bottom of Albion Street, said\r\nto have been formerly that of Warner Edwards.[158] It has been the “Bell\r\nWorks,” from the Blue Bell Inn which stood opposite. Of course they made\r\n“blue printed,” and prospered. In 1802 Job left his brother, and built\r\nthe well-known house and works at Cauldon Place on the Cauldon canal,\r\nnow occupied by the porcelain works of Brown, Westhead, Moore & Co.[159]\r\nAt Cauldon Place the firm, “Job Ridgway & Sons,” began in 1808 to make\r\nchina. Here, too, Job died in 1813, and was succeeded by his son John\r\nRidgway, under whom the Cauldon Place china achieved so great renown. His\r\nother son William went back to the Bell Works, and, adding factory to\r\nfactory, soon became by far the most important potter in Hanley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOB RIDGWAY\r\n\r\n1759-1813\r\n\r\n_Photo by H. J. Gover & Co., Hanley_]\r\n\r\nJob Ridgway married the sister of Elijah Meyer, and made the fortune of\r\nhis family. But his potting was not so interesting as his religious zeal,\r\nso typical of the sentiments of the Potteries at this time; and as the\r\nMethodist revival of the last quarter of the eighteenth century had a\r\nprofound effect upon the habits of the pottery people, and permanently\r\nchanged their affections from cock-fighting to psalm singing, it is\r\nworth while, even in a history of potting, to mention this side also of\r\nthe work of Job Ridgway. He was “converted” while working at Leeds in\r\n1781. When he came to his brother’s house in Hanley, there were only\r\ntwenty-five Methodists in Hanley. He formed a congregation and opened\r\ntheir first chapel in 1784. No sooner was Methodism firmly established\r\nthan he quarrelled with these confining bonds also, and, in 1797, he did\r\nmore than any other layman to establish the Methodist New Connexion.[160]\r\nBethesda Chapel was built in the following year, and by 1802 Burslem and\r\nLane End also had chapels of this new itinerant society. By 1843 there\r\nwere five chapels of this denomination in Hanley alone. If you worked for\r\nJob Ridgway, you had to attend his chapel also.\r\n\r\n  Ralph Ridgway, Master Potter of Chell.\r\n   |\r\n   +-George Ridgway, Master Potter of the Bell Works, Shelton.\r\n   |   (_c._1758-1823)\r\n   |\r\n   +-Job Ridgway, Master Potter of the Bell Works, and of Cauldon Place,\r\n      |  Shelton.

The\r\nbrothers John and George Rogers, for instance, built their factory at\r\nDale Hall near Burslem about 1780. John Rogers built too, about 1800,\r\nthe house called “Watlands” in Wolstanton, the home of many potters, and\r\nlived there till his death in 1816. His son Spencer Rogers succeeded to\r\nthe firm, which continued to flourish for over half a century as “John\r\nRogers and Sons.”[161] Mr Samuel Ford now owns these works.\r\n\r\nJoseph Machin of Burslem was the progenitor of the Machins of the Hole\r\nHouse Works, afterwards, in 1843, “Machin and Potts” of the Waterloo\r\nWorks. This firm were the first successful manufacturers of porcelain in\r\nBurslem and they invented too the present method of printing the transfer\r\npapers from revolving steel cylinders, thereby greatly accelerating the\r\nwork of producing these transfers and printing the ware.\r\n\r\nThe Goodwins of Cobridge had no fewer than four factories in the\r\nneighbourhood as late as 1843;[162] and the firm of John Glass & Sons\r\nappears to have existed in Hanley ever since the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury and the days of slip dishes and “tygs.” William Baddeley, with\r\nhis works at Eastwood on the banks of the Cauldon canal, was chiefly\r\nnoted for his large flint-grinding mills. Miles Mason, of Lane Delf, and\r\nhis son Charles J. Mason had their factory where the Stoke and Hanley\r\ntram-lines now branch. In 1813 the elder Mason introduced the patent\r\n“ironstone” china, which became very popular and was the precursor of the\r\n“granite” trade of later days.[163] The senior partner in the firm of\r\nBourne and Baker of Fenton made a fortune, built the church at Fenton,\r\nand bought the Hilderstone Hall estate, where his descendants now live.\r\n\r\nIn Longton the firm of Charles Harvey is notable, since the proprietor\r\nbecame, about 1820, the first banker at the Longton end. Mrs Mary\r\nCyples represents a family of potteresses whose factory is perpetuated\r\nin Cyples Lane. Messrs Cheetham and Wooley invented a hard white stone\r\nbody resembling porcelain, very useful for relief decoration,[164] and\r\nflourished in Commerce Street for more than half a century. The Locketts\r\nare one of the few firms which have lasted over a hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe potting industry, like all others, suffered stagnation during the\r\nFrench wars. Till 1810 however the growing American trade compensated to\r\na certain extent for the loss of the continental market. But in 1810 the\r\nOrders in Council stopped both the continental and American trade. These\r\nOrders were rescinded in 1812, but the continental trade languished till\r\n1814, and had to be rediscovered and re-established as an entirely new\r\nbusiness when peace came.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the Continent was reopened to English china and earthenware\r\none particular firm came to the front and took the greater part of the\r\nornamental trade. This was the firm of John Davenport & Sons. John\r\nDavenport came of a small yeoman family settled near Leek, and he\r\nstarted in 1785, first as a workman and later as a partner, with Thomas\r\nWoolfe of Stoke. In 1794 he commenced making china on his own account at\r\nLongport.[165]\r\n\r\nThe first factory built on the canal at Longport was, appropriately\r\nenough, put up in 1773 by John Brindley, the younger brother of the\r\nengineer. Edward Bourne and Robert Williamson followed, and in 1795\r\nWalter Daniel put up a fine house and factory at Newport near by. All\r\nthese factories became, early in the nineteenth century, the property\r\nof the great firm of Davenport, attached to the “Unicorn Bank.” John\r\nDavenport had built the “Unicorn Bank” in 1794 for the manufacture of\r\nchina. In 1797 they started the chemical preparation of litharge and\r\nwhite lead; and in 1801 was added the manufacture of flint glass.[166]\r\n\r\nDavenport china and stained glass attained a very high reputation, and\r\nfor many years the Davenports represented the type of the most successful\r\npotters of the age. They are said in 1836 to have produced earthenware\r\nand china alone to the value of nearly £100,000 and to have employed 1400\r\nworkpeople.[167] They had branch establishments at London, Liverpool,\r\nHamburg and Lübeck. They enjoyed Royal favour and acquired princely\r\nfortunes. The first John Davenport bought Westwood near Cheddleton in\r\n1813. He was a major of volunteers at the time of the French scare in\r\n1803, and Conservative M.P. for Stoke-on-Trent from 1832 to 1841. His\r\nsons, John, Henry and William carried on the business and established\r\nthemselves, John at Foxley, Co. Hereford, and William at Maer. William\r\nDavenport was Master of the North Staffordshire Foxhounds. The third\r\ngeneration also went into politics, and Henry T. Davenport, after failing\r\nto secure a seat at Newcastle and at Stoke in 1874, became, from 1880-6,\r\nmember for the northern division of the county. As they lost touch\r\nwith their works, however, the affairs of the Davenport firm gradually\r\nsuffered. In 1868 they sold Westwood; in 1885 Maer; and in 1887 the\r\n“Unicorn Bank” was closed down and sold to Mr Thomas Hughes, who died in\r\n1901.\r\n\r\nThe Davenports were the only manufacturers of glass of any importance in\r\nNorth Staffordshire, and no attempt is now made to rival the productions\r\nin this line of the southern part of the county.\r\n\r\n  Jonathan Davenport of Leek.

It is not surprising, therefore, to find that\r\nin 1805 Wedgwoods also commenced the manufacture of porcelain, and to\r\nfind them repeating on china dinner and tea services the patterns which\r\nhad been so successful on the Queen’s Ware. Josiah Wedgwood II bought\r\nMaer in 1803 (where he was succeeded by Davenport), and began again to\r\nattend to business. Though the new china and the jasper and black basalt\r\nwith reliefs in Egyptian red turned out under his regime fully maintained\r\nthe reputation of the firm—as witness the medallions of the admirals and\r\nthe Egyptian basalt so typical of the second period[168]—yet they never\r\nrecovered the undisputed position they had held in the ornamental trade\r\nof the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSIAH WEDGWOOD II\r\n\r\n1769-1843]\r\n\r\nBy 1819 or 1820[169] indeed they ceased to try and compete in the china\r\ntrade, and it was not till 1872 that Wedgwoods again produced the\r\nporcelain for which they are now so famous. In 1828 even their London\r\nshowrooms were closed down, and Josiah Wedgwood II committed the\r\nunpardonable vandalism of selling off the stock, patterns, and moulds\r\nthere stored. The collections in the Mayer Museum at Liverpool and the\r\ncollection now in the possession of Sir W. H. Lever were formed out of\r\npurchases made at this sale. After contesting Newcastle vainly in the\r\ninterests of “reform” in 1831, Wedgwood was returned as first radical\r\nmember for Stoke-on-Trent in the reformed Parliament of 1832, and died\r\nat Maer in 1843. From 1823 he had had the assistance of his eldest son\r\nJosiah, but from 1827 onwards the works were managed almost entirely by\r\nhis third son, Francis Wedgwood. The firm, which had been called “Josiah\r\nWedgwood” after Byerley’s death in 1810 and “Josiah Wedgwood & Son” until\r\n1827, was thenceforth known as “Josiah Wedgwood & Sons,” which title it\r\nretains at the present day.\r\n\r\nPedigree of the Later Wedgwoods:\r\n\r\n  Josiah Wedgwood, Master Potter of Etruria.

Indeed\r\nthe preparation of the clay body was now carried out so carefully that\r\nmagnets were used to attract any particle of iron that might be ground up\r\nwith the flint; and the old process of evaporation which converted the\r\nslip into the solid clay body gave way about 1860 to the clay press now\r\nused to squeeze out the water from the clay. Samuel Allen, lathe maker of\r\nDale Hall, is the sole representative to be found in 1818 of the makers\r\nof potters’ machinery, now so important a branch of manufacture. But\r\nthe “jiggers,” which exactly reproduce plates by the thousand, and the\r\n“jollies,” for the mechanical moulding and pressing of hollow ware, were\r\nthe creation of a much later age. Even now these machine tools may be\r\nsaid to be in their infancy though they are developing under the hands of\r\nskilled engineers such as Messrs Boulton of Burslem.\r\n\r\nA subsidiary manufacture which does not appear on the 1818 list at all\r\nis that of borax. Borax, or as it was originally called “tincal,” had\r\nbeen first introduced about 1796 when it was brought from Thibet. In that\r\nyear Ralph Wedgwood (see p. 87), who spent his life inventing things,\r\nand was then a master-potter at Ferrybridge in Yorkshire,[171] took out\r\na patent for “making glass upon new principles” by using this tincal.\r\nBy Hickling’s patent of 1799 it was also applied to the enamelling of\r\nmetal vessels, and it appears again in the leadless glaze of Mr. Rose\r\nof Coalport in 1820.[172] All this time, however, the price was almost\r\nprohibitive of the commercial use of borax. In 1815 it cost 3s. to 4s. a\r\nlb., and it was only on the development of the Etruscan borax deposits in\r\n1828 that it came into general use as a flux for the glazes, partially\r\ndisplacing the lead oxides. As the borax—as well as the soda used in the\r\nglaze—is soluble in water, glazes containing these have to be “fritted”\r\nor vitrified before being ground with the other components into a slip\r\nfor dipping the ware. This melting or fritting, besides making the glaze\r\ninsoluble in water and suitable for dipping, will, if the lead be fritted\r\nwith the other components and not just ground in afterwards, make the\r\nlead more or less innocuous. Unfortunately, however, the fritted lead\r\nrequires more exact firing to produce a good glaze, and can hardly\r\ncompete commercially at present. Glazes can be made without any lead at\r\nall by using borax alone as a flux, but the surface is always full of\r\nimperfections and less glossy than that given by a leaded glaze.\r\n\r\nThe first important manufactory of borax in the Potteries was that of\r\nWood, Kuntz & Co.,[173] a firm in which the sons of Enoch Wood were\r\ninterested. Because the risk of lead poisoning is always present in the\r\npreparation and uses of the lead glazes, attempts have been made for\r\n100 years to produce a good glaze free from lead—or rather free from\r\nunfritted lead—soluble in hydrochloric acid. Josiah Wedgwood produced\r\nsuch a glaze, but it gave a rough surface wherewith it was useless in\r\nthose days to try to compete. The Society of Arts awarded its gold medal\r\nin 1823 to Job Meigh of Hanley for his invention of a leadless glaze. But\r\nMeigh’s leadless glaze was only to be applied to coarse red pottery.[174]\r\nOf recent years Mr. Furnival and Mr. William Burton have done most to\r\nmake safe glazes commercially practicable. There is no doubt but that\r\nby the use of borax a safe glaze, free from lead, can be made; it will\r\nnot be mechanically perfect perhaps, but artistically it need not be\r\nconsidered inferior to the heavy smooth lead glaze.\r\n\r\nAbout 1826 an even more dangerous lead process was introduced by Henry\r\nDaniel, who began in that year to make stoneware “china” in Shelton.\r\nThis was the process of “ground laying” and “colour dusting,” in which\r\nthe enamel paints are dusted in a dry state over a sticky oily surface\r\nto which they adhere. The leaded particles of paint dust are easily\r\nbreathed into the lungs and caused a heavy mortality. The ærograph,\r\ninvented in 1890, which lays the ground mechanically, reduced the risks\r\nof this process, and more recently the Home Office regulations regarding\r\nventilation, mufflers, etc., have helped in the same direction.\r\n\r\nAmong the Tunstall potters on the list of 1818 occur the names of\r\nBenjamin Adams and Jesse Breeze. Benjamin Adams was the son and successor\r\nof that William Adams who made jasper at Greengates and died in 1805.\r\nWithin a year or two of 1818 he had to sell his factory, which was\r\nbought by John Meir, another Tunstall potter.[175] John Breeze had\r\nbought the house and factory built by Theophilus Smith in 1793 and\r\ncalled Smithfield. Smith had, in 1800, committed suicide in prison after\r\nfailing three times to murder his wife’s lover.[176] His tragic end\r\ncaused the name of his house to be changed to Greenfield; and in 1827\r\nJesse, son of this John Breeze of Greenfield, having no sons, married\r\none of his daughters to William Adams, son of the successful potter of\r\nStoke, and bequeathed his factory to him. In this way another branch of\r\nthe Adams family returned to Tunstall. From 1827 to the present day the\r\nAdams family from father to son have continued to make earthenware at\r\nGreenfield. They have recently bought up Greengates also, and joined the\r\ntwo old Adams’ factories together. The firm has had a somewhat chequered\r\ncareer, but under the management of the present brothers and partners,\r\nWilliam and Percy W. L. Adams, it has resumed its high reputation as one\r\nof the largest exporters of useful and ornamental ware.\r\n\r\n  William Adams (brother of Thomas Adams, Master Potter of the Brickhouse,\r\n   |  Burslem), Master Potter of Burslem. d. 1617.\r\n   |\r\n   +-John Adams of Sneyd Green.

Before 1800, steam had been introduced\r\nto drive the flint mills; the glaze-grinding mills, the pumps and lawn\r\nsifters came next. But lathes and throwers’ wheels were still driven\r\nby hand, and so were the “jiggers”—revolving moulds on which flat bats\r\nof clay were “flat-pressed” to make plates and saucers. A tramway was\r\nlaid about 1815 from Longton and Fenton to the canal wharf at Stoke; but\r\ntransport along both tramway and canal was still drawn by horses. With\r\nthe opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway, however, in 1830,\r\na new era began in transport, as important as the first canal for the\r\npotting industry.\r\n\r\nLand transport had, of course, become thoroughly organized and cheapened,\r\nand coaches, carrier carts and wagon transport had kept increasing in\r\nspeed and numbers. In the 1818 Directory, for instance, we find that\r\nno less than eleven coaches passed through the district each way every\r\nday. Every afternoon the “Light Post Coach,” from Liverpool to Burton\r\nand London, ran through the Potteries from the “Red Bull” at Lawton to\r\nLane End; and two hours later the “Prince Coburg” from Liverpool passed\r\nthrough, branching off from the other route at Stoke, and going through\r\nTrent Vale, Stone and Lichfield to London. The “Regulator” too, on three\r\ndays of the week, ran through the Potteries by the same route on its\r\njourney from Liverpool to Birmingham. In addition to these coaches three\r\nothers ran from Liverpool to London, and one from Manchester to London,\r\npassing through Newcastle, as did also one from Liverpool and two from\r\nManchester on their way to Birmingham. You could travel from Newcastle at\r\n6 a.m. to the “Swan with Two Necks,” in Fetter Lane, in fifteen hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, however, the Bill for the Grand Junction Railway, from\r\nBirmingham to Manchester, was passed, and by the completion of this\r\nrailway in 1837, Whitmore, the nearest station, five miles from the\r\nPotteries, was brought within seven hours of London by four trains a day.\r\n\r\nCoal gas had been introduced in 1826 into Burslem, and by 1840 the\r\nbeginnings of a water supply were visible. At this period, just before\r\nmodern sanitation, locomotion, economies and “civilization” took root,\r\nJohn Ward, in his “Stoke-on-Trent,” gives us a table showing the\r\ndimensions of the trade. It runs as follows:[177]\r\n\r\n  A Table, showing the amount of conveyance of Goods and\r\n  Merchandise to and from the Boro’ of Stoke-upon-Trent, by the\r\n  navigation from the Trent to the Mersey, for one year ending\r\n  30th June 1836.\r\n\r\n  INWARD TRADE.—\r\n\r\n                                                           Tons\r\n\r\n  _From Liverpool_\r\n\r\n  Clay and Stone from Devon, Dorset and Cornwall          70,000\r\n  Flint Stone from Gravesend and Newhaven                 30,000\r\n  Borax, Boracic Acid, Cobalt, Colours, Bone Ash, etc.     4,000\r\n  Timber                                                   9,000\r\n  Corn, Grain and Flour                                    7,000\r\n  Groceries and Colonial Produce                           6,500\r\n  Butter, Bacon and other provisions                       1,500\r\n  Wine, Spirits, Ale and Porter                              800\r\n  Miscellaneous Goods                                      1,000\r\n                                                          ------  129,800\r\n\r\n  _From South Staffordshire_\r\n\r\n  Iron, Steel and Copper                                   7,060\r\n  Stourbridge Bricks                                       1,200\r\n                                                          ------    8,260\r\n\r\n  _From London_\r\n\r\n  Mercery, Haberdashery, from London and the West            500\r\n  Groceries, &c.                                           1,500\r\n  Miscellaneous                                            1,050\r\n                                                          ------    3,050\r\n\r\n  _From Manchester_\r\n\r\n  Cotton, Silk and Woollen Goods                           1,200\r\n  Window Glass and Lead                                      300\r\n  Malt, &c.                                                  500\r\n  Miscellaneous Goods from the North                         500\r\n                                                          ------    2,500\r\n                                                                  -------\r\n            Total Imports                                         143,610\r\n\r\n  OUTWARD TRADE.—\r\n\r\n  _To Liverpool_\r\n\r\n  Earthenware and China, for America, Ireland, Scotland\r\n    and foreign Countries                                 51,000\r\n  Bricks and Tiles for same countries                     10,000\r\n                                                          ------   61,000\r\n  _To Manchester_\r\n\r\n  Earthenware and China                                    3,500\r\n  Bricks and Tiles                                        30,000\r\n  Coal, to Manchester and Stockport                       25,000\r\n  Miscellaneous Goods                                      1,000\r\n                                                          ------   59,500\r\n\r\n  _To South Staffordshire_\r\n\r\n  Ironstone                                               15,000\r\n                                                          ------   15,000\r\n\r\n  _To Birmingham and the West_\r\n\r\n  Earthenware and China                                    6,000\r\n                                                          ------    6,000\r\n\r\n  _To London and the South_\r\n\r\n  Earthenware and China                                   12,000\r\n  Coals, Cannel and Slack                                 30,000\r\n                                                          ------   42,000\r\n\r\n  _To Chester and North Wales_\r\n\r\n  Earthenware and China                                             1,000\r\n                                                                  -------\r\n            Total Exports                                         184,500\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the Stourbridge bricks were already in request\r\nfor the pot-ovens, and that the total weight of ware exported out of the\r\ndistrict amounted to 72,500 tons, of which nearly three-quarters went\r\nabroad.

Already in 1792 we read of troops being sent, to Wolverhampton\r\nof all places, to keep order during a strike in the Potteries of\r\nStaffordshire.[178] While in 1813 a Chamber of Commerce was formed and\r\nattempted to fix a uniform increased price for earthenware. A price list\r\nwas in fact drawn up for the commoner sorts of ware, and remained in\r\nforce for twenty years or more, though it was regularly evaded by special\r\nrebates and discounts.[179]\r\n\r\nThe first Trade Union is heard of in 1824. It was formed immediately on\r\nthe passage of the combination laws, and the men struck for a rise at\r\nMartinmas 1825. The men were utterly beaten and their union destroyed.\r\nLittle capital was required to start a pot-factory in those days, and the\r\nstrikers tried to employ themselves in an early example of a co-operative\r\nfactory. They were however before their time and the experiment only\r\nhastened their defeat.[180]\r\n\r\nThe best days for the Trade Unions came in 1833, when Robert Owen, the\r\nsocialist, visited the Potteries and brought them all the enthusiasm\r\nof a great cause. A new union was founded, and was welcomed by many of\r\nthe best employers as a lever to raise prices as well as wages. Chas.\r\nJ. Mason, who was then supplying the world with his “ironstone” china,\r\nformed a Masters’ Association to work with the men’s union; and wages\r\nwere raised. The dissentient masters refused to grant the rise, and a\r\nfour months’ strike began at Martinmas 1834, and ended in a victory for\r\nthe men.[181]\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1833-5 wages are said to have increased by 25 per\r\ncent.[182] But in March 1836 the masters united in a Pottery Chamber of\r\nCommerce and preparations were made for war. Before however an account\r\nis given of what is still known as “the great strike,” the two customs\r\nof the trade must be described, against which, then and for years\r\nthereafter, the men struggled in vain.\r\n\r\nBy the “Annual Hiring” Agreement men were engaged only at Martinmas (Nov.\r\n11). They were bound to serve all the following year to make ware at\r\nfixed prices, and if they broke their agreement they could be, and were,\r\nimprisoned. It was entirely a one-sided bargain. An employer could keep a\r\nman tied to a situation which gave him but one day’s work a week, yet if\r\nthe man left he might be prosecuted. Even if not prosecuted, nobody could\r\nengage him without a written discharge. The system was similar to the\r\nNative Pass Laws of South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of male workers were flat or hollow-ware pressers and\r\nthrowers. These men were paid by piece, and only for those pieces which\r\nwere good. By a strange trade custom, however, they were not paid for\r\nthose pieces which left their hands in good condition, but only for those\r\nthat ultimately came good from the oven. In other words, they suffered\r\nfor other people’s breakages and carelessness. The men could get no proof\r\nthat the ware was bad at all. They had no appeal. Some masters were\r\neven said to refuse to pay for what they themselves afterwards sold as\r\n“seconds.”\r\n\r\nAgainst these customs the men decided to strike. They demanded the right\r\nto give a month’s notice to leave and to be paid for all ware which came\r\n“good-from-hand.” The masters replied that they “could not allow the\r\nold usages of the trade to be broken up,” and they drew up a new clause\r\nto be added to the annual agreements in future. By this new clause the\r\nagreement was to be suspended if work at a factory ceased, but only\r\ntill work was resumed again. In fact the men were to be suspended from\r\nwork and wages but not from servitude. If they found work during the\r\n“suspension” they were to throw it up as soon as their old master wanted\r\nthem back.[183]\r\n\r\nAs soon as notice of the new agreement was given to the men, the workmen\r\nat fourteen factories came out. This was on Sept. 1, 1836. When Martinmas\r\ncame round sixty-four more of the biggest factories were laid idle, and\r\nseven-ninths of the trade stopped. It is doubtful whether the whole\r\nhistory of Trade Unionism records a more desperate fight than the one\r\nthat followed. Strike pay never exceeded 6s. for married men and 4s. for\r\nsingle men, but the funds became exhausted. Help came—£7,000 of it—from\r\nSheffield and Manchester, and that too vanished. Twenty thousand potters\r\nwere out of work, and so were the retail tradesmen and all allied trades.\r\nThe men began to dribble back at Christmas, for it was a very hard\r\nwinter and the savings were all gone. Then several hundred devoted men,\r\ntaking the remains of their clothes and household furniture, marched\r\nin procession to the pawn-shops and paid over all the money they could\r\nraise into the common fund. This example inspired the last 10,000 to hold\r\nout three weeks longer, and at least got terms for the men. A conference\r\nwas presided over by Mr Twemlow of Betley on January 20, 1837, and the\r\nmasters agreed to guarantee four days’ work a week, and to break in the\r\npresence of the man all ware for which they refused to pay him, on the\r\nground that it came “bad from oven.”[184]\r\n\r\nBut even these concessions were futile for the union was broken. The men\r\ntook what they could get. Gradually all the old wrongs crept back again\r\ninto the trade customs, and even the wage-prices of 1833-6 were whittled\r\naway by a system of “allowances.” A potter of 1843 gives an account of\r\nhis engagement. He applied for work as a journeyman, and was asked what\r\nkind of a journeyman he wanted to be, as there were several kinds. “There\r\nwere,” said the manufacturer, “some, like those of so-and-so, who took\r\npay in provisions; others, like those of such a one, who took their pay\r\nin haberdashery and jewellery; but the class to which he wished to direct\r\nparticular attention was the one which allowed 2d. in the shilling, which\r\nclass was divided into two parties; those who consented to the twopences\r\nbeing stopped out of their wages on Saturday evening, and those who\r\npreferred to compound with their dignity, get their money in full on\r\nSaturday and pay back the twopences on Monday morning.”[185]\r\n\r\nWages in fact sank to subsistence level, and the smaller the master the\r\nmore he beat down his men by allowances and undercut his selling prices.\r\nSome of them kept shops as well as factories, and broke the Truck Act\r\nevery day. The Chamber of Commerce in 1836 stated the average wages as\r\nfollows: In 1833-4, men 17s. to 21s., women 6s. to 11s., child of 14, 3s.\r\nto 3s. 6d.; in 1836, men 21s. to 28s., women 10s. to 15s., child 3s. 6d.\r\nto 4s. 6d. These figures probably exaggerate slightly the rise in wages,\r\nand under the allowance system they soon sank again to the pre-union\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThe general election took place in the middle of the black year 1837, and\r\nthe return of the two Conservative masters, Davenport and Copeland, for\r\nStoke-on-Trent, resulted in rioting on the part of the wage-earners who\r\nwere then non-voters. These riots were repeated in a more serious form at\r\nthe election of 1841, but it was the houses rather than the factories of\r\nthe unpopular side that were demolished.\r\n\r\nDuring those busy years of the railway boom, the Trade Unions again\r\nraised their head in North Staffordshire. The third union was started in\r\nSeptember 1843. It began with a small success—a partial strike lasting\r\nnine months—but as a rule it avoided conflicts and tried to work by moral\r\nsuasion and public opinion. With this end in view they published a paper,\r\n“The Potters’ Examiner,” in which the more flagrant cases of “truck” and\r\n“allowance” were exposed. They succeeded in gradually levelling up the\r\nbad masters. A few prosecutions stopped the truck system, and allowances\r\nvanished in 1844 under gentle pressure from a strong union and doubts as\r\nto their legality. It is only fair to say that the best firms had never\r\ncountenanced the “allowances,” and were glad to see the worse makers\r\nforced to drop them.\r\n\r\nA development, however, that helped the union at first more than anything\r\nelse, was the invention of pot-making machines. The potting industry had\r\nsurvived so long without machinery, that the workmen had begun to think\r\nthemselves safe. These flat and hollow ware-pressers had skill, and they\r\nwere paid by the piece. At one fell swoop, and in the middle of their\r\nsettled lives, they saw themselves suddenly deprived of all the value\r\nof their skill and training, and likely to be replaced by women and\r\nlads. During 1845-6 Mr Ridgway tried a “paste-box” machine, and Chas.\r\nJ. Mason bought some sort of a plate “jolly.”[186] The men promptly\r\nstruck and prevented their adoption, but the panic was intensified when\r\nMessrs Copeland introduced a similar dread machine, which the potters in\r\ntheir terror called the “Scourge.” This machine too was withdrawn, but\r\nnot because of the union. The general election of 1847 was approaching\r\nand Alderman Copeland stood for Stoke-on-Trent. It is curious to think\r\nthat the panic fear of the workers postponed the introduction of these\r\nmachines for twenty years. And indeed the pottery workers themselves\r\nhave lost something through the introduction of machinery. The proportion\r\nof women and young persons employed in the industry is double what it was\r\nin 1850, and the work of married women is not good for the rest of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIncidentally this machinery panic broke down the union. Encouraged by\r\nWilliam Evans, their leader and the editor of the “Examiner,” the union\r\nattempted to emigrate the unemployed—almost to emigrate _en masse_ and\r\nfly from the wrath to come. They bought a great estate in Wisconsin,\r\ncalled it Pottersville, and to it in 1846 they sent out settlers as to\r\na new Utopia. The scheme failed, and with it, in 1849, collapsed the\r\nthird potters’ union. Drained of money for America, it had been growing\r\nweaker ever since 1847—they could only humbly petition against Copeland’s\r\n“Scourge,” and as the union weakened “allowances” crept back into use,\r\nwhile “good-from-oven” and the annual hiring flourished as before.[187]\r\n\r\nIt is said that but for the opposition of the Newcastle innkeepers the\r\nmain line of the London and Manchester Railway would have run up the\r\nTrent valley, and Newcastle would now occupy the position of Crewe as a\r\nuniversal junction. However that may be, in 1846 a company was formed for\r\ngiving the potteries direct railway communication with the main trunk\r\nlines. The moving spirit in this enterprise was Alderman Copeland, M.P.\r\nfor Stoke, and senior partner in Messrs Copeland and Garrett—the pottery\r\nfirm that had once been Spode’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALD. W. T. COPELAND, M.P.\r\n\r\n1797-1868]\r\n\r\nWilliam Taylor Copeland (1797-1868),[188] son of William Copeland, the\r\npartner of the second Spode, had become sole owner of the old Spode china\r\nfactory at Stoke in 1833. He had been Lord Mayor of London in 1835, and\r\nfrom 1837 till 1865 was generally Conservative member for Stoke-on-Trent.\r\nWith the help of his partner, Thomas Garrett, Lord Ingestre, Richard\r\nCobden, and some London financiers, the North Staffordshire Railway was\r\nformed. Bills were passed through Parliament in 1846, and by the end of\r\n1849 Stoke was connected up with Stafford, Derby, Crewe, and Manchester.\r\nThey were forced by Parliament to buy out the Canal Company’s monopoly\r\nat a very high figure—£1,700,000—which large addition to the capital of\r\nthe company has always been urged as an excuse for any exceptionally high\r\ntransport rates on this railway.\r\n\r\nWe may add here that the loop line through Tunstall was finished in\r\n1875; while the tramways with horse draft were commenced in 1861, turned\r\ninto steam traction in 1895, and into the present electric system by the\r\nBritish Electric Traction Company in 1902.\r\n\r\nThe railway at first affected principally the passenger traffic, and it\r\nwas only gradually that it came into use for the carrying trade of the\r\ndistrict, as the following figures show:\r\n\r\n  Total weight of goods and minerals carried by N.S.R. in 1,000 tons\r\n\r\n  Canal   Rail   Year\r\n  1370      —    1819\r\n  1286      —    1840\r\n  1356      —    1849\r\n  1259     273   1850\r\n  1595    1245   1860\r\n  1563    2324   1870\r\n  1244    3369   1880\r\n  1076    4309   1890\r\n  1168    5587   1900\r\n  1130    6515   1906[189]\r\n\r\nThe partnership between Copeland and Garrett was dissolved in 1847, and\r\nthe firm took the title of “W. T. Copeland, late Spode.” This was again\r\nchanged in 1867 when Alderman Copeland’s four sons were admitted into the\r\nbusiness, and the name became “W. T. Copeland & Sons.” It was about 1846\r\nthat Messrs Copeland developed the “Parian” body, a hard white stoneware\r\nsecond only to marble as a material for statuettes and bas-reliefs. It\r\nis composed largely of feldspar, and figures in this material, modelled\r\nby some of the best artists of the last half century, still form a large\r\npart of Messrs Copeland’s productions.\r\n\r\nAlderman Copeland, who was also a great patron of the Turf, died in 1868\r\nand his son, Richard Pirie Copeland, then became sole owner of the works.\r\nMr R. P. Copeland bought Kibblestone Hall, and served as High Sheriff for\r\nthe county in 1902. His sons have now joined him in the management of the\r\nhistoric works at Stoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMINTON, TILES AND PORCELAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Copelands have continued to perfect the old Spode china,\r\ntheir rivals, Mintons, have tried several new fields—tiles, majolica,\r\npâte-sur-pâte. Herbert Minton (1793-1858)[190] and an elder brother\r\njoined their father’s firm in 1817, and, after his father and brother\r\nretired, he took Robert Boyle as a partner in these works at Stoke. Here\r\nin 1828 Herbert Minton first turned his attention towards producing\r\ntiles.[191] In 1830 Samuel Wright of Shelton patented a process for\r\nmaking encaustic tiles in the manner of the old Cistercian monks. The\r\npatterns were pressed in hollows into the tiles, the hollows were filled\r\nup with different coloured slip clays, and then the face was all cut\r\nlevel and flush. This patent was bought up by Minton and Boyle, and after\r\ngreat difficulties the first successful encaustic tiles were made in\r\n1836.[192]\r\n\r\nBut it was the patent of Richard Prosser of Birmingham in 1840 which\r\ngave us the tile industry of the present day. He compressed clay dust\r\nbetween metal dies, and made the dry dust solid under the pressure of a\r\ndifferential screw. The process was intended at first for making buttons,\r\ndoor-knobs, etc., and it was for these purposes that Minton immediately\r\nbought the patent. J. M. Blashfield, who had already had experience\r\nin making mosaic pavements, saw the value of the machine for making\r\ntiles, and developed this line so effectively that by 1842 no less than\r\nsixty-two presses were at work making white glazed dust tiles.[193]\r\nHerbert Minton took his wife’s nephew, Michael Daintry Hollins, into\r\npartnership in 1841 to look after the tile branch.[194]\r\n\r\nTiles—dust and encaustic—were the first of Minton’s improvements. The\r\nnext change, due in some degree at least to Minton, was a general\r\nimprovement in taste. The financial success of common blue printed ware\r\nhad done away with any inducement to improve ornamental ware. The\r\nbrilliant natural art of Whieldon had been forgotten; the classic style\r\nof Wedgwood fell out of favour under the Regency; and instead we find\r\nthe gaudy decoration of old shapes by artists ever more mechanical and\r\nless artistic. As M. Solon has said: “Worse and worse became the shapes\r\nand models; lower and lower sank the work of the decorators; nor could\r\nthis deplorable state of things be altered by the inspiring study of fine\r\nworks of art. The Potteries were situated very far from the artistic\r\ncentre; good examples and good advice were equally wanting. It is not to\r\nbe denied that all that remains of the most pretentious examples of the\r\npottery of that period (1800-1850) bears the stamp of an unmitigated bad\r\ntaste.”[195] Some second-rate china painter from Worcester or Derby came\r\nover to the Potteries to direct workmen and was called an artist. The\r\nmodest cream colour was embossed and gilded; the white earthenware was\r\nentirely covered with badly engraved blue printing; and the porcelain\r\npieces of importance were decorated in the manner which one now\r\nassociates with the mantelpiece of the cheap lodging house.\r\n\r\nGradually this has been changed. The exhibitions of 1849 in Birmingham,\r\nof 1851, 1862, and 1871 in London, and of 1867 in Paris, induced healthy\r\ncompetition in excellence as an alternative to competition in cheapness\r\nand wage cutting. The public museums of Hanley, Stoke and Tunstall came\r\nlater, but the Museum of Practical Geology, opened in 1851, and the South\r\nKensington Museum, opened in 1857, helped to raise taste. Above all the\r\nWedgwood Institute at Burslem, opened in 1865 under the fostering care\r\nof Thos. Hulme and William Woodall, M.P., with its admirable classes for\r\nstudents in applied art, has given a certain artistic training to the\r\ndesigner, decorator and moulder. But much credit also must be given to\r\nHerbert Minton for bringing over to Staffordshire the first of a series\r\nof French artists who have added extraordinarily to the ornamental value\r\nof Staffordshire ware.\r\n\r\nM. Leon Arnoux (1816-1902) was engaged in 1849 by Messrs Minton, and\r\nbecame thenceforth the art manager of the works. He improved the\r\ndecoration of their porcelain and the whiteness of its body, but his\r\nchief claim to notice rests on his “majolica” and his imitation of the\r\nold Pallissy, or Henri II, ware. For 30 years nothing was more popular\r\nthan Minton’s majolica, whether for ornamental ware, tiles or façades.\r\nArnoux was followed by such artists as Jeanest, Lessore, Protat,[196]\r\nand in 1870 by Mons. M. L. Solon, whose special work—pâte-sur-pâte\r\ndecoration—still holds the public taste and deserves to become classical.\r\nIn this process white slip clay-paste is painted on to a dark clay body,\r\nand the varying thickness and transparency of the layers of paint produce\r\nan effect which differs completely from either plain enamelling or the\r\nhigh relief of jasper. At the same time it lends itself to the individual\r\ntaste of the artist and can never become merely mechanical.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert Minton died in 1858 his firm employed 1500 workpeople,[197]\r\na number which has never been exceeded by any ornamental factory before\r\nor since. His two nephews, M. D. Hollins and Colin Minton Campbell\r\n(1827-1885)—the latter had become a partner in 1849—carried on the\r\nbusiness jointly under the title of Herbert Minton & Co. for china and\r\nearthenware, and Minton, Hollins & Co. for tiles. In 1863 they were\r\njoined for a few years by another partner, Robert Minton Taylor, and on\r\nhis leaving in 1868 Hollins and Campbell divided the business between\r\nthem. Hollins took the tiles, and Campbell the main factory. One of\r\nthe conditions of the division was that Campbell had to take over the\r\nstock of moulds at a valuation. It is said that they were valued at the\r\nunexpected and extraordinary figure of £30,000, the compulsory payment\r\nof which dissolved the friendship as well as the partnership of the\r\ntwo cousins. It may have been the recollection of this heavy grievance\r\nthat induced Campbell in 1871 to start the Campbell Tile Co., a serious\r\ncompetitor for Minton, Hollins & Co., and the progenitor of many lawsuits.\r\n\r\nColin Minton Campbell was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1869, Chairman\r\nof the North Stafford Railway, and Conservative Member of Parliament for\r\nNorth Staffs 1874-80. He died in 1885, and his statue stands in the High\r\nStreet of Stoke. The Minton Works are now the property of his son John\r\nCampbell of Woodseat, but he takes no share in the business, which is\r\nmanaged by Mr J. Robinson. Another John Campbell owns and manages the\r\nCampbell Tile Co. in Stoke.\r\n\r\nAs for the rival nephew and potter, Michael Hollins, he built in 1870 the\r\nmodern factory of Minton, Hollins & Co. in Shelton Old Road, Stoke, and\r\ncontinued till his death in 1898 to make the best encaustic and glazed\r\ndust tiles. The factory, employing some 400 workers, is now carried\r\non, but under far keener competition, by his grandson, Michael Daintry\r\nHollins.\r\n\r\nAnother important tile factory is that of T. & R. Boote in Burslem.\r\nThis firm was founded in 1842 by Thomas Latham Boote and Richard Boote\r\nat the “Central Pottery” in Burslem. About 1850 they bought several old\r\npot-banks, put up their present “Waterloo Potteries” in Waterloo Road,\r\nand started to make tiles. Mr T. L. Boote retired in 1879, Mr. R. Boote\r\ndied in 1891, and the works are now carried on by the sons of the former,\r\nRichard L. and Charles E. Boote.[198]\r\n\r\nThe British manufacture of tiles is not so entirely localized in North\r\nStaffordshire as is that of china and earthenware, but 6 out of the 17\r\nlargest English firms have their works here. Such are, beside those\r\nalready mentioned, G. Woolliscroft and Sons and the Porcelain Tile Co.,\r\nboth of Hanley, Henry Richards Tile Co., of Tunstall, and the Malkin Tile\r\nCo. of Burslem.[199]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMODERN MEN AND METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the manufacture of tiles, though economically the most important\r\npart of Minton’s work, ought not to distract attention from that great\r\nartistic development of his school, which gave us from 1855-1885 the\r\nhalcyon days of the English china trade. With this period the names of\r\nMinton, Ridgway, Brown Westhead and Brownfield are chiefly associated,\r\nwhile such old firms as Copelands and Wedgwoods acquired fresh lustre.\r\n\r\nJohn Ridgway of Cauldon Place is reputed to have produced the best china\r\nat the 1851 exhibition, and when he died in 1860 the Cauldon Place Works\r\nwere bought by Messrs T. C. Brown Westhead, Moore and Co., who have\r\ncontinued to this day to produce the china for which Cauldon Place has\r\nalways been renowned. William Ridgway, the brother of John, had half a\r\ndozen factories in Hanley—George Taylor’s, Elijah Mayer’s, Toft and\r\nMay’s, D. Wilson’s, Hicks’, Meigh and Johnson’s, besides the old Bell\r\nWorks, and made both earthenware and china.[200] His son Edward John\r\nRidgway built their present Bedford Works in Hanley, where this family\r\nstill produce china, as well as “Granite” and printed ware for the\r\nAmerican trade.\r\n\r\nNor must the name of William Brownfield of Cobridge be omitted from any\r\naccount of the prosperous days of the china trade. This firm, which has\r\nnow closed down, made trial recently of a profit-sharing scheme, which\r\ndeserved well of the community. Unfortunately it fell upon the bad times\r\nnear the end of the last century and was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe success of Minton in majolica, tiles and porcelain led the Wedgwoods\r\nat Etruria to depart so far from their special black basalt and jasper\r\nas to take up similar lines of manufacture. Their brown majolica glaze,\r\nknown as “rockingham,” perhaps the most permanently successful form of\r\nmajolica, was introduced about 1860.[201] (This “rockingham” glaze\r\nhad been first employed about 1796 near Rotherham on the Marquis of\r\nRockingham’s estate in Yorkshire.)[202] Then, in 1872, they began again\r\nto make porcelain, and this time with great success. A Wedgwood china\r\ndinner service of 1296 pieces was selected by President Roosevelt for\r\nthe White House in open competition with the whole world. From 1880 till\r\n1902 Wedgwoods also made encaustic and white-glazed tiles, though without\r\nany financial success. This firm now employs about 700 people, and is\r\ncarried on by Messrs Lawrence, Cecil and Francis Hamilton Wedgwood, the\r\ngreat-grandson and great-great-grandsons of Josiah Wedgwood, making\r\naltogether eight generations of master-potters from father to son,\r\nprobably a unique example in any industry.\r\n\r\nWhile Mintons, Copelands and Wedgwoods were producing the most costly\r\nporcelain, the trade in the commoner china had centred more and more at\r\nthe Longton end of the Potteries. Charles J. Mason with his “ironstone\r\nchina” at Fenton between 1820 and 1850 was the precursor of this trade,\r\nand it was on this export trade that Longton grew so rapidly throughout\r\nthe 19th century. The manufacture of cheap “jet” and “rockingham” has\r\nbecome of recent years an important branch of manufacture at this Longton\r\nend, and very opportunely, for the cheap china trade has suffered more\r\nthan any other from the German and Dutch competition. Messrs Wileman’s\r\nfactory at the Foley, now owned by Mr Percy Shelley, is the most\r\nimportant, but the Longton china trade generally is in the hands of small\r\nmen. A great part of this china trade was formerly with America, and,\r\napart from ornamental potting, it has always been the solid American\r\ntrade which has made the fortunes of the Staffordshire potters. In the\r\nforties the chief exporters of earthenware to America were Enoch Wood of\r\nFountain Place, and Samuel Alcock of the Hill Top Works, both in Burslem.\r\nSamuel Alcock had several factories in Burslem, and deserves mention\r\nfor his “Parian” figures, but his great trade was in plain white and\r\ncream colour with the United States.[203] Alcock’s old Hill Top Works,\r\nwhere John Mitchell once used to entertain Wesley, belong now to Samuel\r\nJohnson, noted for his tea-pots.\r\n\r\nThe close of the American war, 1865, saw the rise of another potting firm\r\ndestined to grow to importance in the American trade. This was the firm\r\nof James and George Meakin. They were the sons of James Meakin, who had\r\nbeen a small master-potter in Hanley, and they produced an uniform hard\r\nwhite earthenware called “granite”—serviceable, plain and cheap. James\r\nMeakin, a man of great business capacity, financed and gradually came to\r\ncontrol a large proportion of the American buyers, and all through the\r\nseventies this firm almost monopolized the trade of the United States\r\nin cheap earthenware. James Meakin bought Darlaston Hall, and died in\r\n1885. His “Eagle Works” at Hanley are now carried on by his sons Kenneth\r\nand Bernard and by his nephew George Meakin of Cresswell Hall. Alfred\r\nMeakin started a similar manufacture at the Victoria and Albert Works in\r\nTunstall in 1874, now taken over by Johnson Bros. These Johnsons, too,\r\nnephews of James Meakin, began soon after 1880 to rival the Eagle Works\r\nin the production of “granite” and plain printed ware. They have now\r\nno less than five factories in Hanley, Tunstall and Burslem specially\r\nequipped for this trade. The fourth of the firms known as “The Big\r\nAmerican Four” (now reduced to three) is that of W. H. Grindley, who\r\nbegan in 1887 to make “granite” at Wood and Challenor’s old Woodland\r\nWorks in Tunstall. His new factory at Brownhills is said to afford the\r\nbest example of up-to-date economical manufacture, and stands out in\r\nstriking contrast to most of the older “artistic” works. Another factory\r\nwhich owes its reputation to strict specialization and the latest\r\neconomical machinery is that of Samuel Gibson, in the Moorland Road, at\r\nBurslem. Here five hundred men and girls make tea-pots for the world—only\r\ntea-pots—in jet and brown and rockingham.\r\n\r\n  James Meakin, Master Potter of Hanley, d. 1855.\r\n   |\r\n   +-Sarah. = Robert Johnson d. _c._ 1910\r\n   |  |\r\n   |  +-Henry Johnson.   }\r\n   |  |                  }\r\n   |  +-Robert Johnson.  }  Master Potters of Hanley—“Johnson Bros.”\r\n   |  |                  }\r\n   |  +-Fred.

No doubt the general expansion of trade and the temporary\r\nabsence of foreign competition were the chief factors in producing this\r\nprosperity. But a great deal was due to the increased use of steam power\r\nand the introduction of automatic machinery, and also to the institution\r\nof the Potteries Board of Conciliation and Arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe clay filter press, with its steam slip-pumps—patented by Needham and\r\nKite in 1856—had replaced the old method of evaporating the moisture out\r\nof the clay slip; and during the seventies a mechanical steam-driven\r\n“blunger” and a similar “pug-mill” did away with the old laborious\r\n“blunging” and “wedging” in the preparation of the clay body. Then that\r\nform of the thrower’s wheel, known as the plate “jigger”—which revolved\r\nthe flat plate moulds—came to be driven by steam instead of by a boy at\r\nthe wheel handle; and instead of the skilled hand of the flat-presser, a\r\nmechanical “form” or “jolly” was used to press the “bat” on to the mould,\r\nand give the plate the right contour and thickness.[204]\r\n\r\nSuch machines for making plates had been invented as long ago as 1845,\r\nbut for twenty years the objections of the workmen and practical\r\nimperfections had postponed their introduction. The “form” used to be\r\napplied by hand, and the plates consequently varied in thickness, and it\r\nrequired great skill on the part of the presser to make them properly.\r\nThe machine, on the other hand, made every plate exactly alike, and made\r\nthem ten times as quickly as the old hand process. This machine did away\r\nwith the work of the old skilled “flat-pressers,” and was in general use\r\nby 1870. A similar machine, with a somewhat more complicated “jolly,”\r\nor “form,” made hollow-ware, such as basins and cups, or even bellied\r\nware, such as ewers or chamber-pots. These came into use gradually from\r\n1870 onwards, and replaced much of the work of hollow-ware pressers and\r\nthrowers. Then in the eighties came a machine for flattening out those\r\nbats of clay which were to be pressed on to the “jigger” moulds and\r\n“jollied” into flat or hollow ware.[205] About the same time, too, the\r\nsteam drive came to be used for turning the thrower’s wheel and for the\r\nturner’s lathe—fitted with various devices for controlling the speed of\r\nrevolution. The manufacture of potters’ machinery is now a considerable\r\nindustry, and, thanks to the energy and inventive readiness of Messrs\r\nBoulton of Burslem, this industry also is centred in the Staffordshire\r\nPotteries, and has as wide a range of markets as the Staffordshire pots\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of all these labour-saving appliances was facilitated\r\nby the co-operation of masters and men on an arbitration board. A Trades\r\nUnion—the fourth—had been reconstituted in 1863 from a few surviving\r\nbranches of the old Union. They started a fresh newspaper, “The\r\nPotteries Examiner,” under the able management of the new Leader, William\r\nOwen, the nephew of Robert Owen, the Socialist. By 1865 they were strong\r\nenough to strike against that good old trade custom—the annual hiring.\r\nThe oven-men’s Union, always the most determined branch of the Potters\r\nTrades Unions, refused to give up the fight when the other trades were\r\nprepared to go in, and by holding out alone they at last succeeded in\r\nabolishing the annual hiring, and secured for the potter the right to\r\ngive a month’s notice. This was in 1866, and the whole trade shared the\r\nbenefits of the change.[206]\r\n\r\nThe Staffordshire Potters Unions seem at each burst of activity to have\r\nevolved some special enthusiasm or eccentricity. There was the attempt\r\nat co-operative manufacture in 1825; the enthusiastic idealism of Robert\r\nOwen in 1833; the attempt to put the unemployed on the land in Wisconsin,\r\nand so relieve the labour market, which absorbed the enthusiasm and funds\r\nof 1845-6; and now the new Union of 1863, under the guidance of William\r\nOwen, originated a far more important and practical movement—arbitration\r\nin industrial disputes.\r\n\r\nAt Nottingham, Mr Mundella had in 1867 established a Board of Arbitration\r\nin the stocking trade. Its success made it attractive to both masters\r\nand men. William Owen approached Mr Mundella, who brought his influence\r\nto bear successfully on the pottery masters also, and in July, 1868, a\r\nsimilar Board of Conciliation and Arbitration was established in the\r\npotting industry.[207] On it there were ten representatives of each side,\r\nwho were wherever possible to decide questions that arose. When they\r\ncould not agree an umpire was to be appointed, whose decision was to\r\nbe binding. Such men as H. T. Davenport, M.P., Mr Mundella, Sir Thomas\r\nBrassey, “Tom” Hughes, have at different times been umpires.\r\n\r\nAt first the Board worked well. The introduction of each machine was made\r\nthe occasion for a readjustment of prices; and, although the struggle\r\nover “good-from-oven” goes on to this day, the first step was taken\r\nbefore the Board in 1869 on the motion of one of the masters’ delegates,\r\nMr Francis Wedgwood, to abolish this old trade custom and substitute\r\n“good-from-hand.”[208] An arbitration award in 1871 raised wages\r\ngenerally.[209]\r\n\r\nBut the strain came when the masters tried by arbitration to reduce\r\nwages. The award in 1877 went against them; in 1879, however, they were\r\nmore fortunate, for Lord Hatherton awarded a reduction of 1d. in the\r\nshilling.[210] A journeyman potter’s wages may be said to have averaged\r\n30s. a week when in full employ, and what are still remembered as “Lord\r\nHatherton’s pennies” were a great grievance in the Potteries. Probably\r\nthe Board would have broken down at once had it not been for Owen, and\r\nfor the hope that arbitration next year would put it all right again.\r\nBut Sir Thomas Brassey’s award on next year’s arbitration made no\r\nchange,[211] and the Board broke down. At Martinmas 1881 a strike began.\r\nIt was an immediate failure, for thirteen years of arbitration had sapped\r\nthe strength of the Union.\r\n\r\nFor a short time—1885-91—an Arbitration Board was re-established, but it\r\nwas tolerated rather than supported by either masters or men. In 1891\r\nanother award was given against the men, and the Board was painlessly\r\nextinguished by a strike of the fighting oven-men. Since then the Union\r\nhas gradually gained strength, but even now, after a successful strike in\r\n1900 which raised wages by 5 per cent. all round, the potters in all the\r\nUnions do not much exceed 20 per cent. of the adult male workers alone.\r\nTrades Unions have special difficulties in the Potteries owing to the\r\nlarge number of small masters employing only two or three people in each\r\ntrade; owing to the prevailing piecework prices which makes the levelling\r\nup process difficult; and owing to the number of small Unions into which\r\nthe working potters are divided. John Lovatt is at present the secretary\r\nof the General Union, while Alderman Thomas Edwards for long looked after\r\nthe special interests of the oven-men.\r\n\r\nInvention of recent years has busied itself mostly with the firing of the\r\novens. Mr J. P. Holdcroft, of Hanley, patented in 1898 a new thermoscope\r\nwhich directs with far greater certainty the exact heating of the\r\novens.[212] New methods of firing these ovens are also on trial. Both\r\n“Producer” and “Mond” gas have been tried and offer some hope not only of\r\nmore regular firing, but also of abolishing the columns of smoke which\r\nhave blackened the Potteries for 200 years. The “Climax Kiln” is another\r\ndevice of quite recent date for regulating the firing, and saving the\r\npiling up and unpiling of saggars of ware. The ware is packed in an iron\r\ncage on wheels and pulled in and out of the furnace mechanically, without\r\ndrawing the fire.\r\n\r\nBoth the “Climax Kiln” and a new method of polychrome printing—whereby\r\none transfer only is used to impart many colours to the piece of ware to\r\nbe printed—have been introduced within the last six years by Mr Leonard\r\nGrimwade, perhaps the most enterprising potter of recent times. Mr\r\nGrimwade has specialized for the Colonial markets, and holds in them much\r\nthe position held by Meakins in the American trade. His factories are in\r\nHanley and Stoke, adjoining the Stoke Railway Station.\r\n\r\nAn off-shoot of the potting trade which almost amounts to an invention\r\nby itself is the manufacture of stilts, spurs and thimbles. These are\r\nthe small “bits” put between the wares to prevent them sticking together\r\nwhen fired in the saggars, and they used to be made when and as wanted in\r\neach separate pot-works. It was Charles Ford of Hanley who, about 1840,\r\nfirst made a special factory for these spurs and stilts. He used metal\r\ndie-stamps driven by a steam hammer which stamped out stilts by the score\r\nat a time. James Gimson followed with the invention of the “thimble.”\r\nThese conical thimbles fit into and one above each other and have a\r\nlug on the rim, so that three pillar-supports are built up on which a\r\nwhole “nest” of plates can rest while in the oven without touching each\r\nother. Stacked in this way, the “bits” make no marks on the face of the\r\nplate. Somewhat later Wentworth Buller, a member of the well-known Devon\r\nfamily, started a stilt and spur factory at Bovey Tracy in Devonshire,\r\nand, finding the cost of carriage to his market prohibitive, he moved his\r\nworks about 1865 to Hanley. Here he began in 1866-7 to make telegraph\r\ninsulators—a new pottery industry. He was joined shortly after by his\r\ncousin, Captain Ernest Wentworth Buller, the brother of Sir Redvers\r\nand an engineer, who became sole owner in 1869. In 1872 J. T. Harris\r\njoined the firm, which is now controlled and carried on by his son, John\r\nHarris. Having obtained a foothold in the electrical trade, this firm was\r\nnaturally called on to do all the early electrical work. Just as they had\r\nstamped stilts and spurs so they stamped switches, cut-outs, “roses,”\r\nand all manner of electric fittings. In 1896 Captain Buller sold out and\r\nretired. The elaborate insulators now used are thrown by hand and then\r\nturned and screwed, and nearly half the world’s supply comes from Bullers\r\nLimited.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar trade was carried on by James Mackintyre and William\r\nWoodall, M.P., at Burslem, in the manufacture of furniture fittings. Door\r\nplates, door knobs, knobs and buttons of all sorts for the furniture\r\ntrade are stamped in dies by the score, as are the stilts and spurs.\r\nMessrs. Mackintyre are still the chief makers of furniture pottery,\r\nthough they have by no means a monopoly.\r\n\r\nSaggars in which ware is packed for firing are also made by the direct\r\npressure of a large die or press upon the plastic marl.\r\n\r\nMessrs Bullers’ most formidable rival in the making of insulators is the\r\nfirm of Doulton’s Limited; and this last firm carry on also several other\r\nvariations of the staple trade. Sir Henry Doulton (1820-97)[213] began\r\nby making sewage pipes at Lambeth. His trade increased, and he started\r\nbranch works for making these things at St Helens and at Rowley Regis\r\nand Smethwick in South Staffordshire. Between 1867 and 1873, however, he\r\ndiverted his attention to the more ambitious “Electric” and “Sanitary”\r\nware, and also to the characteristic stoneware known as “Doulton’s.”\r\nThis new stoneware caught the public fancy, and to it he devoted his\r\nLambeth works. He continued to make the drain pipes at Rowley Regis,\r\nand at Burslem he bought in 1877 Pinder & Bourne’s works in Nile Street\r\nfor his other manufactures. Here Doulton’s produce high-class china and\r\nearthenware as well as sanitary and electric pottery and employ nearly\r\n1,300 hands. Sir Henry Doulton was knighted in 1887, the only potter\r\never so honoured, and died in 1897. In 1899 his son, Henry Lewis Doulton,\r\nconverted the business into a limited company.[214]\r\n\r\nBut the branch of the trade known as sanitary pottery owes most of its\r\ndevelopment in Staffordshire to Mr Thomas William Twyford. His father\r\nThomas Twyford started making plumbers’ ware about 1860, and when he died\r\nin 1872 both the Abbey Works and the Bath Street Works in Hanley were\r\nmaking basins and closet-pans of an elementary kind. But no real advance\r\ntook place till the eighties. In 1885 the wash-out Pedestal closets were\r\nintroduced, made entirely of earthenware, and in 1889 the latest “deluge”\r\ntype followed. Those who can remember the old dirty enamelled iron pans\r\nwill recognize the debt that sanitary science owes to the enterprise of\r\nTwyford.\r\n\r\nAll Twyford’s sanitary pottery was in 1887 concentrated at the present\r\nCliff Vale Works, and experiments were at once set on foot for yet\r\nanother branch of manufacture. This was the production of very large clay\r\npieces coated with a smooth white surface and suitable for baths and\r\nlavatories. The common or fire clay is coated while in the plastic state\r\nwith a porcelain enamel, which on firing gives a surface enamel polished\r\nas marble and more adhesive than any enamel on metal. Very large pieces\r\nare coated in this way, and the earthenware article has since 1890 been\r\nreplacing alike the enamelled metal of Wolverhampton and the marble of\r\nItaly. Messrs Twyford’s chief rivals in Staffordshire are the firm of\r\nJohn Taylor Howson of Hanley.\r\n\r\nFrom an artistic point of view the only improvements of recent times\r\nare—beside M. Solon’s pâte-sur-pâte and Doulton’s stoneware—the lustre\r\nware of Mr William Burton and the “flambé” ware of Mr Bernard Moore. Mr\r\nBurton’s factory unfortunately lies outside Staffordshire, but much of\r\nhis work, both public and private, is still done in North Staffordshire.\r\nHe and Mr Moore are the most enterprising chemists and experimenters of\r\nthe present race of master-potters, and their efforts have also been\r\naccompanied by a marked improvement of taste in enamelled earthenware and\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nThere remains one modern improvement to point out. It is in the health\r\nof the potters. For generations potter’s asthma and lead poisoning have\r\ntaken their toll of the workers on the pot-banks, but within the last ten\r\nyears changes have been made, unfortunately only as a result of State\r\ninterference, which are very sensibly affecting the rate of mortality in\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1864 that the Factory Acts interfered in the potting\r\nindustry. In that year women, young persons and children in the pottery\r\ntrade first came under the protection of the State. Their hours were\r\nlimited to ten a day, and Saturday became a statutory half-holiday.\r\nThis meant a half-holiday for all workers on the pot-banks. Half-time\r\nemployment has never been considerable in the Potteries, and since\r\nthe passing of the Education Acts it has gradually and entirely died\r\nout. Later Factory Acts have applied to Potteries as well as to other\r\nfactories, but it was when the Bill of 1891 got into committee that the\r\npotting trade became specially and vitally interested in these Acts.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the 1891 Factory and Workshop Bill the working\r\npotters managed to get added to it a provision empowering the Home\r\nOffice to make, after due investigation, special rules for the conduct\r\nof “dusty processes” in dangerous trades, including potting. As soon as\r\nthe Act passed, a committee was appointed, and on their recommendation\r\nspecial rules were drawn up, making for greater cleanliness in the\r\ndusty and dangerous processes. The employers objected, and a conference\r\nfollowed in 1894 under the presidency of Mr G. W. E. Russell.\r\nNevertheless the rules, slightly modified, were approved and became law.\r\n\r\nThese special rules, however, were concerned more with general dusty\r\nevils and affected potter’s asthma rather than the lead poisoning\r\nquestion. But in 1898 Prof. Thorpe and Dr Oliver drew up their celebrated\r\nreport on lead poisoning for the Home Office—a report which for a time\r\nthrew the whole trade into the most furious excitement. The doctors\r\naverred that glaze could be made without lead, or without lead in any\r\nbut the innocuous “fritted” state. What the employers said was emphatic\r\nand contradictory. They threatened to close down the whole trade, and\r\nno doubt the report was hasty and ill-considered. For four years the\r\ncontroversy raged, and at last in 1902 an arbitration court was held\r\nbefore Lord James of Hereford. Under his award a new set of special rules\r\nwere drawn up. These rules, besides enforcing sanitary provisions such as\r\nthose for monthly medical inspection of workers “in the lead,” compelled\r\nthose manufacturers who continued to use lead in a dangerous state to\r\ncompensate those of their workers who suffered from lead poisoning, a\r\nliability now generally embodied in the 1907 Workmen’s Compensation Act.\r\n\r\nWhen one remembers the intense hostility to this Home Office\r\ninterference, it is curious to see how satisfactory and easily the\r\nrules have worked in practice. Potter’s asthma is nearly extinct, and\r\nlead-poisoning cases in the Potteries have fallen from an average of 362\r\na year in the period 1896-8 to 93 a year over the years 1905-7.[215]\r\nAbout 5 per cent of the cases result in death. The chief credit for this\r\nnew departure should be attributed to William Owen of the Potters’ Union,\r\nand to the Duchess of Sutherland and Sir Charles Dilke.\r\n\r\nThe latest statistics of the industry show that in 1901 there were about\r\n400 factories employing some 21,000 adult males, 16,000 adult females,\r\nand 13,000 young persons under 18 years of age.[216] The employment of\r\ngreat numbers of married women (some 8,000) and the consequent high rate\r\nof infantile mortality are now the most serious features of the industry\r\nfrom the sociological point of view.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the official figures are given for the export of china\r\nand earthenware, so as to show the prosperity at different times of the\r\nstaple trade of North Staffordshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Trade, since 1840.

It\r\nproduced the mottled effect by being dabbed or dusted on in patches.\r\n\r\n[12] M. Solon explains this method of reckoning as follows: “Art of the\r\nOld English Potter,” p. 32. “The unit was represented by a dozen small\r\npieces, and that unit served as the basis of reckoning for all the rest.\r\nFor instance, a dish might have been worth a ‘dozen’; a very large dish\r\n‘counted 2 dozen’; of bowls, jugs, cups, and other articles of middle\r\nsizes it required 2, 3 or 4 to make a dozen. The potter knew at once the\r\nvalue of the contents of his oven by the number or ‘dozens’ put in; while\r\nthe workman could easily calculate his wages by the number of ‘dozen’ he\r\nmade in the week.... So convenient was this method of reckoning that it\r\nis kept up to this day in many manufactories both in England and on the\r\nContinent.”\r\n\r\n[13] This Act was passed in 1661, which would make the date of Plot’s\r\nvisit to the Potteries 1675-7.\r\n\r\n[14] Lawton Park is on the Cheshire side of Mow Cop, only six miles from\r\nBurslem.\r\n\r\n[15] S.

The ostler of the Inn put\r\na piece of flint into the fire; when it was red-hot he quenched it with\r\nwater and pounded it to a fine powder, a little of which was blown into\r\nthe horse’s eye, relieving the inflammation. The potter, noticing the\r\nextreme whiteness of the calcined flint, and also the ease with which it\r\nwas powdered, was led to try this material to improve the whiteness of\r\nhis ware, and with the most successful results.\r\n\r\n[35] Shaw, _op. cit._, p. 141.\r\n\r\n[36] “Wedgwood Letters,” III, p. 190.\r\n\r\n[37] “Monthly Magazine,” November 1823.\r\n\r\n[38] A family of Adams lived and potted at the Brick House in Burslem for\r\nover 200 years.

It was not till 1866 that the Trade Unions put an end to the\r\nannual hiring of grown men by a year’s binding agreement.\r\n\r\n[77] Burton, “English Earthenware,” p. 119.\r\n\r\n[78] Shaw, _op. cit._, p. 157.\r\n\r\n[79] Ward, “Stoke-on-Trent,” p. 372.\r\n\r\n[80] Shaw, _op. cit._, pp. 148-9.\r\n\r\n[81] This makes 6s. 8d. a ton delivered at the Pot Bank.\r\n\r\n[82] Professor Church quotes the following memorandum, done in red enamel\r\non the back of a large dish of Wedgwood’s Queen’s Ware in the possession\r\nof Mr Sidney Locock:—“This dish was made at Etruria by Messrs Wedgwood\r\n& Bentley, the first year after Messrs Wedgwood & Bentley removed from\r\nBurslem to Etruria. Ric. Lawton served his apprenticeship at turning\r\nwith them, and has had it in his house more than fifty years. It is my\r\nbrother William’s modelling. It was turned on a hand lathe, as plates\r\nwere at that date. I preserve this to show the quality of common cream\r\nware before the introduction of growan or Cornwall stone. This body is\r\nformed of flint and clay only, the same as used for salt-glazed ware at\r\nthat time, and flint and lead only instead of salt glaze, and it is fired\r\nin the usual and accustomed way and manner, as usual for glazed tea-pots,\r\ntortoiseshell, mottled, and agate, and cauliflower, &c. Also sand from\r\nthe Mole Cop and Baddley Edge was used either in the body or glaze. N.B.\r\nBefore flint was used they used a certain proportion of slip for the\r\nbody in the glaze to prevent crazing, and to make it bear a stronger\r\nfire in the glaze oven. I was the first person that made use of bone in\r\nearthenware when in my apprenticeship at Mr Palmers at Hanley Green.\r\n\r\nBurslem, Sept. 26th, 1826.\r\n\r\n                                                              ENOCH WOOD.”\r\n\r\nChurch, “English Earthenware,” pp. 81-82.\r\n\r\n[83] Shaw, _op. cit._, p. 184.\r\n\r\n[84] Many “lives” of Wedgwood have been written, and this is not the\r\nplace to repeat them. Miss Meteyard has two large volumes on him; Jewitt\r\nhas one; Smiles holds him up in a recent work as a model of self-help;\r\nProfessor Church has written a monograph on him and his Jasper Ware;\r\nand lastly, Mr Elbert Hubbard, of New York, has made his courtship and\r\nmarriage the subject of an exhaustive and wholly imaginary study. But\r\nmany of these works, and some of the Histories of Potting too, are\r\nmarred by indiscriminating eulogy and a fertile imagination. Simeon\r\nShaw, for instance, within 120 pages, manages to distinguish no fewer\r\nthan 47 favoured manufacturers by name with praise of this stereotyped\r\ncharacter:—“of whom we may observe that great professional ability is\r\nin him joined with philanthropy, and a readiness to accelerate every\r\nmeritorious enterprise.” This, however, is perhaps preferable to the\r\nstyle:—“Wedgwood, poor dear, old soul, got terribly worried,” which\r\ndistinguishes another of these Histories.\r\n\r\n[85] Wedgwood MS., Bills for carting goods to the “new works.”\r\n\r\n[86] Wedgwood’s Letters, II, 24.\r\n\r\n[87] Meteyard’s “Wedgwood,” I, 486.\r\n\r\n[88] Meteyard’s “Wedgwood,” II, 235.\r\n\r\n[89] Wedgwood’s Letters, I.\r\n\r\n[90] The converting of a road into a turnpike road was the only way in\r\nwhich it could be kept in really good repair.
