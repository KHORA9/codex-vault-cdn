by the Egyptians; we only know that it was a very long time\r\nago. But we do know that in the time of the twelfth dynasty, which dates\r\nfrom 2466 B.C., sculpture had reached a stage of excellence such as\r\ncould only have resulted from the experience of many years of training\r\nand practice in this art.\r\n\r\nIn the Egyptian collection of the Louvre, at Paris, there is the\r\nmemorial stone of an old Egyptian sculptor which has an inscription that\r\nreads as if he had written it himself; this was the way by which\r\nEgyptians made these inscriptions sound as if the dead themselves spoke\r\nto those who were still alive. This sculptor's name was Martisen, and he\r\nlived about forty-four centuries ago. Brugsch-Bey, a very learned writer\r\non Egypt, says: \"He calls himself 'a master among those who understand\r\nart, and a plastic artist,' who 'was a wise artist in his art.' He\r\nrelates in succession his knowledge in the making of statues, in every\r\nposition, according to prescribed use and measure; and brings forward,\r\nas his particular invention, an etching with colors, if I have rightly\r\nunderstood the expression, 'which can neither be injured by fire nor\r\nwashed off by water; 'and, as a further explanation of this, states that\r\n'no man has arisen who has been able to do this except himself alone and\r\nthe eldest son of his race, whom God's will has created. He has arisen\r\nable to do this, and the exercise of his hand has been admired in\r\nmasterly works in all sorts of precious stones, from gold and silver to\r\nivory and ebony.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that Martisen and his son, who was named\r\nUsurtasen, were sculptors at the time when Egyptian art reached its\r\nhighest point.\r\n\r\nThe earliest works of Egyptian sculpture are the bas-reliefs found in\r\nthe chambers of the tombs; the walls are almost covered with them, and\r\nthey are painted with colors which are still bright and fresh, though\r\nmore than four thousand years have passed since they were put on. The\r\nsubjects of these reliefs are taken from the life of the persons buried\r\nin the tombs, and even their possessions and occupations are thus\r\nrepresented. These sculptures were made by tracing the designs on the\r\nstone and then cutting it away between the figures. The mode of\r\narrangement in these reliefs does not satisfy our ideas of what it\r\nshould be. It seems as if the artists had no plan of their work in their\r\nminds--no aim as to what the effect should be when finished. On the\r\ncontrary, the reliefs impress us as if the sculptors made one figure,\r\nand then added another and another in such a way as to represent the\r\nfact they wished to tell without any attention to the beauty of the\r\nwhole; and so it does not seem as if there was any unity in them, but as\r\nif the large bas-reliefs were made up of disjointed parts which in one\r\nsense really have no relation to each other.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the Egyptian statues. It appears as if the different\r\nparts might have been made separately or even by different sculptors,\r\nand then joined together. All this is because the Egyptians seemed to\r\nthink of an object in parts and not as a whole. Then, too, the position\r\nof the early statues was so unnatural and awkward. The arms were placed\r\nclose to the sides of the body, and there was no separation between the\r\nlegs; and though in some of their articles of furniture, their pottery,\r\nand in the details of their architecture, the Egyptians made a great\r\nadvance, they did not equally improve in their sculpture.\r\n\r\nOne great hindrance to the progress of Egyptian sculpture was the fact\r\nthat figures were never represented in action. They were not figures\r\nmoving and living in stone; they were like figures petrified and fixed:\r\nthey were _statues_, and no one can forget this for a moment while\r\nlooking at them. I can learn of but one Egyptian figure sculptured as if\r\nin action; this is a quoit-thrower in the Tombs of the Kings. A sitting\r\nstatue, whether of a man or a woman, had the hands rested on the knees\r\nor held across the breast (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--STATUE OF CEPHREN IN THE MUSEUM AT CAIRO.]\r\n\r\nThere were very few groups in Egyptian sculpture, and these seldom had\r\nmore than two figures. It was customary to represent a husband and wife\r\nsitting on the same chair holding each other's hands, or having their\r\narms around one another's waists or shoulders. Sometimes the principal\r\nfigure is of large size, and the inferior persons are made much smaller\r\nand placed at the sides of the larger figure. In short, very few\r\nattitudes are represented in Egyptian sculpture, and it almost seems as\r\nif there must have been fixed rules for a certain limited number of\r\npositions after which all sculptured figures were made.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this sameness and stiffness, Egyptian sculpture is\r\nremarkable, and it is probable that if they had not been fettered by\r\nprejudices and rules the Egyptians would have excelled both in sculpture\r\nand painting.\r\n\r\nThe sides of obelisks and, more especially, the walls of temples were\r\ncovered with sculptures which gave the history of kings--of their wars\r\nand conquests, and of their great works in their kingdoms. The\r\nsculptures upon the temple walls could be estimated by square rods, or\r\neven acres, better than by lesser measures. Their amount and the labor\r\nit required to make them are simply marvellous.\r\n\r\nI will describe the subjects depicted upon one inner wall in the\r\npalace-temple of Medemet Haboo, and will quote from Wilkinson's \"Egypt\r\nand Thebes.\" On the west wall \"the Egyptian princes and generals conduct\r\nthe 'captive chiefs' into the presence of the king. He is seated at the\r\nback of his car, and the spirited horses are held by his attendants on\r\nfoot. Large heaps of hands are placed before him, which an officer\r\ncounts, one by one, as the other notes down their number on a scroll;\r\neach heap containing three thousand, and the total indicating the\r\nreturns of the enemy's slain. The number of captives, reckoned one\r\nthousand in each line, is also mentioned in the hieroglyphics above,\r\nwhere the name of the Rebo points out the nation against whom this war\r\nwas carried on. Their flowing dresses, striped horizontally with blue or\r\ngreen bands on a white ground, and their long hair and aquiline noses\r\ngive them the character of an Eastern nation in the vicinity of Assyria\r\nand Persia, as their name reminds us of the Rhibii of Ptolemy, whom he\r\nplaces near the Caspian.\" ...\r\n\r\nThe suite of this historical subject continues on the south wall. The\r\nking, returning victorious to Egypt, proceeds slowly in his car,\r\nconducting in triumph the prisoners he has made, who walk beside and\r\nbefore it, three others being bound to the axle. Two of his sons attend\r\nas fan-bearers, and the several regiments of Egyptian infantry, with a\r\ncorps of their allies, under the command of these princes, marching in\r\nregular step and in the close array of disciplined troops, accompany\r\ntheir king. He arrives at Thebes, and presents his captives to Amen-Ra\r\nand Mut, the deities of the city, who compliment him, as usual, on the\r\nvictory he has gained, and the overthrow of the enemy he has \"trampled\r\nbeneath his feet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--VARIOUS KINDS OF DOGS.]\r\n\r\nThis description of these bas-reliefs, which are usually painted, will\r\ngive an idea of the great works of Egyptian sculptors.\r\n\r\nThe representation of the animals in these sculptures is as successful\r\nas any part of them. There being no intellectual expression required,\r\nthey are more pleasing than the human beings, with their set, unchanging\r\nfeatures and expression. The Egyptians had several breeds of dogs, and\r\nthe picture here (Fig. 2) is made up from the dogs found in the\r\nsculptures--No. 1, hound; 2, mastiff; 3, turnspit; 4, 5, fox-dogs; 6, 7,\r\ngreyhounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--ANDROSPHINX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--KRIOSPHINX.]\r\n\r\nOne of the figures often repeated by the sculptors of Egypt was the\r\nSphinx. The colossal and most famous one (Fig. 5) is not far from the\r\ngreat pyramid, and has the form of a recumbent lion with a human head.\r\nIt is one hundred and seventy-two feet long, and is _the_ Sphinx of the\r\nworld; but there were great numbers of these strange figures in\r\nEgypt--in some cases there were avenues leading to the temples bordered\r\nby them on each side. The form of the Sphinx was intended to express\r\nsome spiritual thought to the Egyptians, and the stories about it are\r\nvery interesting. Its form certainly denotes the union of physical and\r\nmental power. The form of which we have spoken as being that of the\r\ngreat Sphinx is called the _androsphinx_ (Fig. 3). Another has the body\r\nof the lion with the head of the ram, and is called the _kriosphinx_\r\n(Fig. 4); still another has the same body and the head of a hawk; this\r\nis called the _hieracosphinx_ (Fig. 6). They all typified the king,\r\nwithout doubt, and it is probable that the various heads were so given\r\nto show respect for the different gods who were represented with the\r\nheads of these creatures. Sometimes the androsphinx has human hands in\r\nplace of the lion's paws. The winged Sphinx has been found in Egypt, but\r\nit is rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--THE GREAT SPHINX.]\r\n\r\nThe colossal statues of Egypt are very wonderful on account of their\r\nvast weight and size. The most famous are two which stand on the west\r\nbank of the Nile at Thebes (Fig. 7). Each of these colossi is made from\r\na single block of stone such as is not found within several days'\r\njourney of the place where they stand. They are forty-seven feet high,\r\nand contain eleven thousand five hundred cubic feet each. But a third is\r\nstill larger; it represents the King Rameses II., and, when whole, was\r\nof a single stone, and weighed eight hundred and eighty-seven tons. It\r\nwas brought from Assouan to Thebes, a distance of one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight miles. It is wonderful to think of moving such a vast\r\nweight over such a distance, and one would naturally wish to know also\r\nhow the sculptors could work on such a statue. The plate here given\r\n(Fig. 8) shows the process of polishing a statue, and the following one\r\n(Fig. 9) illustrates the mode of moving one when finished. These\r\nrepresentations are found in tombs and grottoes, and tell us plainly\r\njust what we wish to know about these things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--HIERACOSPHINX.]\r\n\r\nI have now pointed out the marked peculiarities of Egyptian sculpture,\r\nand before leaving the subject will call your attention to the fact that\r\nin most cases it was used in connection with and almost as a part of\r\nEgyptian architecture. In the tombs the bas-reliefs are for the\r\ndecoration of the walls and to finish the work of the architect, while\r\nat the same time they are an interesting feature of the art of the\r\nnation and period. In the temple palaces this is also true--though the\r\nreliefs serve the purpose of telling the history of the kings; they are,\r\nas it were, framed into and make a part of the architectural effect. The\r\nobelisks, colossal figures and Sphinxes were placed before the grand\r\nbuildings, and made a part of them architecturally. In general terms we\r\nmay say that sculpture never became an independent art in Egypt, but was\r\nessentially wedded to architecture; and this fact largely accounts for\r\nthat other truth that sculpture never reached the perfection in Egypt\r\nthat it promised, or the excellence that would have seemed to be the\r\nnatural result of its earliest attainments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE COLOSSI AT THEBES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8--POLISHING A COLOSSAL STATUE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nASSYRIA.\r\n\r\nThe works of sculpture in Assyria consisted of statues, bas-reliefs,\r\nstatuettes in clay, carvings in ivory, metal castings, and some smaller\r\nworks, such as articles for jewelry, made in minute imitation of larger\r\nworks in sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--MODE OF TRANSPORTING A COLOSSUS FROM THE\r\nQUARRIES. _From a Lithographic Drawing._\r\n\r\nIn a Grotto at Dayr E'Shake, near El Bersheh.\r\n\r\n1. The statue bound upon a sledge with ropes. It is of a private\r\nindividual, not of a king, or a deity.\r\n\r\n2. Man probably beating time with his hands, and giving out the verse of\r\na song, to which the men responded; though 3 appears as if about to\r\nthrow something which 2 is preparing to catch, or striking crotala.\r\n\r\n4. Pouring a liquid, perhaps grease, from a vase.\r\n\r\n5. Egyptian soldiers, carrying boughs.\r\n\r\n6, 7, 8, 9. Men, probably captives and convicts, dragging the statue.\r\n\r\n10. Men carrying water, or grease.\r\n\r\n11. Some implements.\r\n\r\n12. Taskmasters.\r\n\r\n13, 14, 15, 16. Reliefs of men.]\r\n\r\nThe statues found in Assyria are by no means beautiful, according to our\r\nidea of beauty. They are as set and stiff in design as the Egyptian\r\nworks of this sort, and they have suffered so much injury from the\r\nweather and from violence that we cannot judge of the manner in which\r\nthey were originally finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--STATUE OF SARDANAPALUS I.\r\n_From Nimrud._]\r\n\r\nThe number of Assyrian statues that have been found is small; this one\r\ngiven here (Fig. 10), of Sardanapalus I., is in the best state of\r\npreservation of any of them. It is smaller than life size, being about\r\nforty-two inches high. The statuettes of the Assyrians are less artistic\r\nthan the statues. They are made from a clay which turned red in baking,\r\nand are colored so as to resemble Greek pottery. They are almost always\r\nof a grotesque appearance, and usually represent gods or genii. They\r\nalso combine human and animal forms in a less noble and artistic way\r\nthan is done in the Egyptian representation of the Sphinx. There are\r\nalso small figures of animals in terra-cotta, principally dogs and\r\nducks. But the large and small statues of the Assyrians are their most\r\nunimportant works in sculpture. It is in their bas-reliefs that their\r\ngreatest excellence is seen, and in them alone their progress in art can\r\nbe traced. This sort of sculpture seems to have been used by the\r\nAssyrians just as painting was used in Italy after the Renaissance. It\r\nwas their mode of expressing everything. Through it they gave expression\r\nto their religious feeling; they told the history of their nation, and\r\nglorified their kings; they represented the domestic scenes which now\r\nmake the subjects of _genre_ pictures; and even imitated vegetables and\r\nfruits, as well as to reproduce landscapes and architecture in these\r\npictures cut from stone. In truth, it is chiefly from the bas-reliefs\r\nthat we learn the history of Assyria, and in this view their sculptures\r\nare even more important than when they are considered merely from an\r\nartistic view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--LION-HUNT. _From Nimrud._]\r\n\r\nThe most ancient palaces at Nimrud furnish the earliest examples of\r\nbas-relief. These date at about the end of the tenth century B.C. One\r\nstriking peculiarity in the design is that all the figures, both men and\r\nanimals, are given in exact profile. In spite of this sameness of\r\nposition they have much spirit and action. The picture of a lion-hunt\r\ngiven here (Fig. 11) is one of the very best of these reliefs, and you\r\nwill notice that the animal forms are much superior to those of the\r\nhuman beings. This is true of all Assyrian art in all its stages. In\r\nthese oldest bas-reliefs there are no backgrounds; but later on these\r\nare added, and mountains, hills, streams, trees, and wild animals are\r\nall introduced as details of the general design. The highest state of\r\nthis art was reached about 650 B.C. At this period the various forms\r\nseem to be more varied and less arranged according to some rule. The\r\nhuman faces and figures are more delicately finished, and there is an\r\nair of freedom and a spirit in the handling of the subjects that is far\r\nbetter than that of any other time. The plants and trees are far more\r\nbeautiful than before.\r\n\r\nThe figures of animals, too, are full of life and action in this period.\r\nI shall only give one illustration, and shall choose the head of a lion,\r\nprobably the best specimen of animal drawing which is yet known in\r\nAssyrian art. It represents the head of a wounded lion, who, in his\r\nagony, rushes upon a chariot and seizes the wheel with his teeth. The\r\ndrawing of this head, as a portrayal of agony and fierceness, compares\r\nfavorably with anything of the same kind belonging to any age of art,\r\neither classic or modern (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\nThere is a question which has not yet been decided as to the amount of\r\ncolor used on the Assyrian bas-reliefs. From the traces of color\r\nremaining on those that are found in the excavations, and from what we\r\nknow of the use of colors on the buildings to which the bas-reliefs\r\nbelonged, we may be sure that colors were used on them; but to what\r\nextent cannot be told. It may have been applied with the freedom of the\r\nEgyptians, or it may have been sparingly used, as was the manner of the\r\nancient Greeks. The colors that have been found in the ruins of Assyria\r\nare white, black, red and blue.\r\n\r\nNext to the sculpture, the metal work of the Assyrians was the most\r\nimportant of their arts. This work was done in three ways: I. Whole\r\nfigures or parts of figures cast in a solid shape. II. Castings of low\r\nbas-reliefs. III. Embossed designs made chiefly with the hammer, but\r\nfinished with the graver. In the solid castings there are only animal\r\nforms, and lions are far more numerous than any other creature. Many of\r\nthem have a ring fastened to the back, which indicates that they were\r\nused for weights. These castings are all small and their form good; but\r\nwe have no reason to think that the Assyrians could make large metal\r\ncastings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--WOUNDED LION BITING A CHARIOT-WHEEL. _From the\r\nNorth Palace, Koyunjik._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--ARM-CHAIR OR THRONE.\r\n_Khorsabad._]\r\n\r\nThe castings in relief were used to ornament thrones, furniture, and\r\nperhaps chariots. They were fastened in their places by means of small\r\nnails. They had no great merit. The embossed or hammered work, on the\r\ncontrary, is artistic and very curious. Large numbers of embossed bowls\r\nand dishes have been found, and this work was used for the end of\r\nsword-sheaths, the sides of chairs and stools, and various other\r\nornamental purposes. It is probable that the main part of the tables,\r\nchairs, and so on were of wood, with the ornaments in embossed metals.\r\nAll this shows the Assyrians to have been an artistic people, and to\r\nhave reached an interesting stage in their arts, though their works are\r\ncoarse and imperfect when judged by Greek standards or by our own idea\r\nof what is beautiful. If we had the space to consider all the various\r\ndesigns of the bas-reliefs in detail, you would learn from them a great\r\nmany interesting facts concerning the domestic life of this ancient and\r\ninteresting people. From them we can learn all about the costumes worn\r\nby the king and those of lesser rank; can see how their wars were\r\ncarried on, and what their chariots, weapons, and equipments were.\r\nTheir games, amusements, musical instruments, agricultural pursuits,\r\nfood, and, in short, everything connected with their daily life is\r\nplainly shown in these sculptures, and, as I have said before, the whole\r\nhistory of Assyria is better studied from them than from any other one\r\nsource. For this reason their great value cannot be over-estimated (Fig.\r\n13).\r\n\r\nOther very ancient nations had sculptors, and a few remains of their\r\narts still exist. This is true of the Medes, Babylonians, and Persians;\r\nbut the general features of their arts resembled those of the Assyrians,\r\nthough they were less advanced than that nation, and have left nothing\r\nas interesting as the Egyptian and Assyrian remains which we have\r\nconsidered. I shall therefore leave them and pass to the sculpture of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--MODE OF DRAWING THE BOW. _Koyunjik._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGREEK SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Egyptians and Assyrians were skilful in sculpture,\r\nbut at the same time their works have not moved us as we wish to be\r\nmoved by art; there is always something beyond them to be desired, and\r\nit remained for the Greeks to attain to that perfection in sculpture\r\nwhich satisfies all our nature and fills our highest conceptions of\r\nbeauty and grace. In truth, in Greece alone has this perfection in\r\nplastic art existed, and since the time of its highest excellence there\r\nno other nation has equalled the examples of Greek sculpture which still\r\nexist, though we have reason to believe that its finest works have\r\nperished, and that those remaining are of the second grade.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for the high artistic attainments of the Greeks,\r\nand a discussion or even a simple statement of them would require an\r\nessay far too learned and lengthy for the scope of this book; but I will\r\nspeak of one truth that had great influence and went far to perfect\r\nGreek art--that is, the unbounded love of beauty, which was an essential\r\npart of the Greek nature. To the Greek, in fact, beauty and good had the\r\nsame meaning--_beauty was good_, and the good must be beautiful.\r\n\r\nSculpture deals almost exclusively with the form of man, and the other\r\nfeatures in it have some relation to the human element of the design;\r\nand it would have been impossible for a true Greek to represent the\r\nhuman form otherwise than beautiful. A writer on this point says: \"The\r\nchief aim of the enlightened Greek, his highest ambition and his\r\ngreatest joy, was to be a _man_ in the fullest sense of the word--man in\r\nthe most complete development of his bodily strength and beauty, in the\r\nactive exercise of the keenest senses, in the greatest because tempered\r\nenjoyment of sensual pleasure, in the free and joyous play of an\r\nintellect strong by nature, graced and guided by the most exquisite\r\ntaste, and enlightened by the sublimest philosophy.\" Thus, beauty was so\r\nimportant to the Greek that every parent prayed that his children might\r\nhave this gift, and the names of beautiful persons were engraved upon\r\npillars set where all could read them; and at times there were\r\ncompetitions for the prize of beauty.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Greek, too, taught that the body was the beautiful\r\nand godlike temple of his soul; and the truth that human beings have\r\nsomething in common with a higher power than their own gave him a great\r\nrespect for humanity, and, in truth, he felt that if he could escape\r\ndeath he should be content and almost, if not quite, a god. For we must\r\nremember that the gods of the Greek were not all-wise, all-powerful, and\r\nall-good, as we believe our God to be. If you read their mythology you\r\nwill find that with the power of the god much imperfection and weakness\r\nwere mingled. They did not believe that Zeus had been the greatest god\r\nfrom the beginning, but that there was a time when he had no power. He\r\nwas not omniscient nor omnipresent, and was himself subject to the\r\ndecrees of Fate, as when he could not save his loved Sarpedon from\r\ndeath. Not knowing all things, even the gods are sometimes represented\r\nas depending upon mortals for information, and all these religious views\r\ntended to make the human form far more noble to the Greek than it can be\r\nto the Christian, with his different views of the relations of God and\r\nman.\r\n\r\nGreek sculpture existed in very early days, and we have vague accounts\r\nof a person called DÆDALUS, who seems to have been a wood-carver. Many\r\ncities claimed to have been his birthplace, and no one can give any\r\nclear account of this ancient artist. He is called the inventor of the\r\naxe, saw, gimlet, plummet-line, and a kind of fish-glue or isinglass. He\r\nis also said to have been the first sculptor who separated the arms from\r\nthe bodies of his statues, or made the feet to step out; he also opened\r\ntheir eyes, and there is a legend that the statues of Dædalus were so\r\nfull of life that they were chained lest they should run away.\r\n\r\nWe call the time to which Dædalus belonged the prehistoric period, and\r\nhis works and those of other artists of his day have all perished. Two\r\nvery ancient specimens of sculpture remain--the Lion Gate of Mycenæ and\r\nthe Niobe of Mount Sipylus; but as their origin is not known, and they\r\nmay not be the work of Greek artists, it is best for us to pass on to\r\nabout 700 B.C., when the records of individual artists begin.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest of these was DIBUTADES, of whom Pliny said that he\r\nwas the first who made likenesses in clay. This author also adds that\r\nDibutades first mixed red earth with clay, and made the masks which were\r\nfastened to the end of the lowest hollow tiles on the roofs of temples.\r\nPliny relates the following story of the making of the first portrait in\r\nbas-relief.\r\n\r\nDibutades lived in Sicyon, and had a daughter called sometimes Kora, and\r\nagain Callirhoe. She could not aid her father very much in his work as a\r\nsculptor, but she went each day to the flower-market and brought home\r\nflowers, which gave a very gay and cheerful air to her father's little\r\nshop. Kora was very beautiful, and many young Greeks visited her father\r\nfor the sake of seeing the daughter. At length one of these youths asked\r\nDibutades to take him as an apprentice; and when this request was\r\ngranted the young man made one of the family of the sculptor. Their\r\nlife was one of simple content. The young man could play upon the reed,\r\nand his education fitted him to be the instructor of Kora. After a time,\r\nfor some reason that Pliny does not mention, it was best for the youth\r\nto go away from the artist's home, and he then asked Kora if she would\r\nbe his wife. She consented, and vows of betrothal were exchanged, while\r\nthey were sad at the thought of parting.\r\n\r\nThe last evening of his stay, as they sat together, Kora seized a coal\r\nfrom the brazier, and traced upon the wall the outline of the face that\r\nwas so dear to her; and she did this so correctly that when her father\r\nsaw it he knew instantly from what face it had been drawn. Then he\r\nwished to do his part, for he also loved the young man. So he brought\r\nhis clay and filled in the outline which Kora had drawn, and so went on\r\nto model the first portrait in bas-relief that was ever made. Thus did\r\nthis great art grow out of the love of this beautiful maiden of Sicyon,\r\nabout twenty-five hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nAfter this beginning Dibutades went on to perfect his art. He made\r\nmedallions and busts, and decorated the beautiful Grecian structures\r\nwith his work, and work in bas-relief became the most beautiful\r\nornamentation of the splendid temples and theatres of Greece. He also\r\nfounded a school for modelling at Sicyon, and became so famous an artist\r\nthat several Greek cities claim the honor of having been his birthplace.\r\n\r\nThe bas-relief made from Kora's outline was preserved in the Nymphæum at\r\nCorinth for almost two hundred years, but was then destroyed by fire.\r\nShe married her lover, and he became a famous artist at Corinth.\r\n\r\nWe have said that accounts of individual artists exist from about 700\r\nB.C.; but these accounts are of so general a character and so wanting in\r\ndetail that I shall pass on about two hundred years, after saying a few\r\nwords of the advance made in the arts of sculpture, and mentioning a\r\nfew of the examples which remain from that early time, which is called\r\nthe Archaic period. This expression not only means an ancient period of\r\nart, but carries also the idea of an obsolete art--of something that is\r\nnot only ancient, but something that is no longer practised in the same\r\nmanner or by the same people as existed in this ancient or archaic time.\r\nDuring this archaic period a beginning was made in many branches of\r\nplastic art. There were statues in metal and marble, bas-reliefs in\r\nvarious kinds of stone and marble, as well as some chryselephantine\r\nstatues. This kind of work is often said to have been invented by\r\nPhidias, but the truth seems to be that he was not its inventor, but\r\ncarried it to great perfection. These chryselephantine statues were made\r\nof wood and then covered with ivory and gold; the ivory was used for the\r\nflesh parts of the statue, and gold for the drapery and ornaments of the\r\nfigure, and the finished work was very brilliant in its effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--LION DEVOURING DEER.]\r\n\r\nThe principal subjects represented in the sculpture of the archaic\r\nperiod were connected with the religion of the Greeks, which is known to\r\nus as mythology. Most statues were of the gods, but portrait statues\r\nwere not unknown, and the custom of setting up statues of the victors in\r\nthe Greek games dates back to this very early time. This was a custom\r\nwhich afforded a large field for sculptors to work in, and must have had\r\na great influence to give life and progress to their art.\r\n\r\nOf the remains of this art very interesting things have been written,\r\nbut I shall speak only of a few such objects of which pictures can be\r\ngiven to aid you in understanding about them. Among the earliest reliefs\r\nthat have been preserved are those now in the Museum of the Louvre, at\r\nParis, which were found in the ruins of a Doric temple at Assos (Fig.\r\n15).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--HERACLES, TRITON, AND NEREIDS.]\r\n\r\nThe various designs upon these marbles seem to have no connection with\r\neach other, and are executed in a rude manner. The most interesting one\r\nrepresents Heracles, or Hercules, struggling with a Triton (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nThe female figures represent Nereids, who are terrified by seeing\r\nHeracles in contest with the sea-monster. There are many proofs that\r\nthese reliefs belong to a very ancient day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--HERACLES AND THE CECROPS.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting relief from the temple of Selinus represents Heracles\r\nstriding off with a pole across his shoulders, to which are hung two\r\nCecrops who had robbed and tormented him (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nA very fine work is also from Selinus, and represents Actæon torn by his\r\ndogs. The mythological story was that Zeus, or Jupiter, was angry with\r\nActæon because he wished to marry Semele, and the great god commanded\r\nArtemis, or Diana, to throw a stag's skin over Actæon, so that his own\r\ndogs would tear him. In the relief Artemis stands at the left (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--ACTÆON AND HIS DOGS.]\r\n\r\nThere is in the British Museum a monument which was discovered at\r\nXanthos in 1838. It is thought to have been made about 500 B.C., and is\r\ncalled \"The Harpy Monument,\" It is a tower, round the four sides of\r\nwhich runs a frieze at a height of about twenty-one feet from the\r\nground. The frieze is of white marble, and is let into the frieze which\r\nis of sandstone. The Lycians, in whose country it was found, were\r\naccustomed to bury their dead at the top of such towers.\r\n\r\nThere is very great difference of opinion among scholars and critics\r\nconcerning the meaning of the various scenes in these sculptures; and as\r\nall their writing is speculation, and no one knows the truth about it, I\r\nshall only say that it is a very interesting object in the history of\r\nart, and shall speak of the four corner figures on the shortest parts of\r\nthe frieze, from which the whole work takes its name. The Harpies are\r\nvery curious; they had wings, and arms like human arms, with claws for\r\nhands, and feathered tails. Their bodies are egg-shaped, which is a very\r\nstrange feature in their formation. We cannot explain all these\r\ndifferent things, but there is little doubt that, with the little forms\r\nwhich they have in their arms, they represent the messengers of death\r\nbearing away the souls of the deceased. In the Odyssey, Homer represents\r\nthe Harpies as carrying off the daughters of King Pandareus and giving\r\nthem to the cruel Erinnyes for servants. For this reason the Harpies\r\nwere considered as robbers, and whenever a person suddenly disappeared\r\nit was said that they had been carried off by Harpies (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--_From the Harpy Monument, London._]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject of existing sculptures from the fifth\r\ncentury B.C., I will speak of the two groups which belonged to the\r\ntemple of Minerva in Ægina, and are now in the Glyptothek at Munich. The\r\ncity of Ægina was the principal city of the island of Ægina, which was\r\nin the gulf of the same name, near the south-west coast of Greece. This\r\ncity was at the height of its prosperity about 475 B.C., at which time a\r\nbeautiful temple was built, of which many columns are still standing,\r\nthough much of it has fallen down. In 1811 some English and German\r\narchitects visited this place, and the marbles they obtained are the\r\nmost remarkable works which still exist from so early a period.\r\nThorwaldsen, the Danish sculptor, restored these reliefs, and the King\r\nof Bavaria bought them.\r\n\r\nUpon the western pediment there were eleven figures which represented an\r\nepisode in the Trojan war; it was the struggle of Ajax, Ulysses, and\r\nother Greek warriors to obtain the dead body of Achilles, which was held\r\nby the Trojans. The story is that the goddess Thetis had dipped her son\r\nAchilles in the river Styx for the purpose of making him invulnerable,\r\nor safe from wounds by weapons. But as she held him by the ankles they\r\nwere not wetted, and so he could be wounded in them. During the siege of\r\nTroy Apollo guided the arrow of Paris to this spot, and the great leader\r\nof the Greeks was killed. It is believed that the warrior in this\r\npicture who is about to send his arrow is Paris. In the central or\r\nhighest part of the pediment the goddess Minerva stands and tries to\r\ncover the fallen body of Achilles with her shield. These figures are on\r\nthe side where the space grows narrower. You can judge of what the\r\naction and spirit of the whole must be when these smaller figures have\r\nso much. We are sure that the arrow will shoot out with such force as\r\nmust carry death to its victim, and the second warrior, who braces\r\nhimself on his feet and knee, will thrust his lance with equal power\r\n(Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nThere are traces of color and of metal ornaments upon these Æginetan\r\nstatues; the weapons, helmets, shields, and quivers were red or blue;\r\nthe eyes, hair, and lips were painted, and there are marks upon the\r\ngarments of the goddess that show that she must have had bronze\r\nornaments. There was a famous sculptor of Ægina named Callon, who lived\r\nabout the time that this temple was built; and though it is not known to\r\nbe so, yet many critics and scholars believe that he may have been the\r\nsculptor of these works, because they resemble the written descriptions\r\nof his statues and reliefs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--_Figures from the Pediment of the Temple of\r\nMinerva, at Ægina._]\r\n\r\nThere was a period which we call archaistic, and by this we indicate a\r\ntime when it was the fashion for the sculptors to imitate as nearly as\r\npossible the works of the true archaic period. It has constantly\r\nhappened in the history of society that fashion has ordained this same\r\nthing, though the objects of imitation have varied with the different\r\nages and nations. This archaistic \"craze\" to imitate old sculptures was\r\nat its height in the times of the Roman emperors Augustus and Hadrian;\r\nbut here in America we have seen the same passion manifested in the\r\ndesire to have such furniture as Queen Anne and her people admired, or\r\nsuch as \"came over in the Mayflower;\" and when the true original\r\narticles were no longer to be found in garrets and out-of-the-way\r\nplaces, then manufacturers began to imitate the old in the new, and one\r\ncan now buy all sorts of ancient-looking furniture that is only just\r\nfrom the workmen's hands.\r\n\r\nBut among the Greeks there was a second motive for reproducing the works\r\nof the earlier artists, which was the fact that the images of the gods\r\nand such articles as belonged to religious services were sacred in their\r\nearliest forms, and were venerated by the people. Thus it followed that\r\nthe advance and change in the taste of the people and the skill of the\r\nartists was more suited to other subjects, while the religious images\r\nwere made as nearly as possible like the older ones. If it happened that\r\na rude ancient image of a god was placed side by side with a modern and\r\nmore beautiful statue of the same deity, the pious Greek would prefer\r\nthe ugly one, while he could well admire the most lovely. You should\r\nremember that these temple images were really objects of actual worship.\r\n\r\nMany of these archaistic works are in various museums of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--ARCHAISTIC ARTEMIS AT NAPLES.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very beautiful temple image, and was discovered at Pompeii in\r\n1760. It was found in a small temple or chapel, of which it must have\r\nbeen the principal deity. It is in excellent preservation; the only\r\nparts which are wanting are the fingers of the right hand and the object\r\nwhich it held. Like many of these statues, it is less than\r\nlife-size--four feet and two inches in height. When it was first\r\ndiscovered there were many traces of color about it. The hair was gilded\r\nto represent the blonde hair which the poets ascribed to Artemis\r\n(Diana). There was considerable red about the garments, and some flowers\r\nwere upon the border of the drapery. There is an archaic stiffness\r\nabout this statue, but the flowing hair, the form of the eyes, and the\r\nfree style of the nude parts all show that it belongs to the archaistic\r\nperiod (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant and satisfying if we could trace step by step the\r\nprogress of Greek sculpture from the rude archaic manner to that of the\r\nPericlean age, or from such art as is seen in the sculpture of Ægina to\r\nthe perfections of the reliefs of the Parthenon. This we cannot do; but\r\nwe know some of the causes that led to this progress, and can give\r\naccounts of a few sculptors who, while they did not equal the great\r\nPhidias, were at least the forerunners of such a type of art as his.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of the progress of art was the greater freedom of the\r\nartist in the choice and treatment of his subjects. So long as the\r\nsubjects were almost entirely religious there could be little variety in\r\nthe manner of treating them. Each god or goddess had its own attributes,\r\nwhich must be rendered with exact care; and any new mode of portraying\r\nthem was almost a sacrilege. But as time passed on and the Panhellenic\r\ngames and the national Pantheon at Olympia grew into their great\r\nimportance, new subjects were furnished for the artists, which allowed\r\nthem to show their originality and to indulge their artistic\r\nimaginations to their fullest extent. The victors in the games were\r\nheroes, and regarded even as demi-gods, and statues were allowed to be\r\nerected to them, although this had hitherto been considered a divine\r\nhonor and was accorded to the gods alone. When these heroes were\r\nrepresented, the artists, not being bound by any laws, could study their\r\nsubjects and represent them to the life as nearly as they were able to\r\ndo. This exaltation of the Olympian victors gave an opportunity for the\r\ndevelopment of sculpture such as cannot be over-estimated in its\r\ninfluence and results.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the art of the time we are now considering\r\nwas the almost universal use of bronze. This metal is excellent for\r\ndisplaying the minute features of the nude parts of statues, but it is\r\nnot equal to marble in the representation of draperies or for giving\r\nexpression to the face. PYTHAGORAS OF RHEGIUM was a famous artist who\r\nworked entirely in bronze. The only copies from his works of which we\r\nknow are on two gems, one of which is in the Berlin Museum. He made\r\nexact studies of the body in action, and gave new importance to the\r\nreproduction of the veins and muscles. It is also claimed that\r\nPythagoras was the first to lay down clearly the laws of symmetry or\r\nproportion which is governed by strict mathematical rules.\r\n\r\nMYRON OF ELEUTHERÆ flourished about 500 to 440 B.C., and was reckoned\r\namong Athenian artists because, though not born at Athens, he did most\r\nof his works there, and his most famous work, the statue of a cow, stood\r\non the Acropolis of that city. This cow was represented as in the act of\r\nlowing, and was elevated upon a marble base. It was carried from Athens\r\nto Rome, where it stood in the Forum of Peace. Many writers mentioned\r\nthis work of Myron's, and thirty-seven epigrams were written concerning\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--THE DISCOBOLUS.]\r\n\r\nThough the cow was so much talked of, the artistic fame of Myron rests\r\nmore upon the \"Discobolus,\" or quoit-thrower. The original statue does\r\nnot exist, but there are several copies of it. That in the Massimi Villa\r\nis a very accurate one, and was found on the Esquiline Hill at Rome in\r\nA.D. 1782; our illustration is made from this statue. Myron's great\r\nskill in representing the human figure in excited action is well shown\r\nin the quoit-thrower. To make such a figure as this requires great power\r\nin a sculptor. No model could constantly repeat this action, and if he\r\ncould there is but a flash of time in which the artist sees just the\r\nposition he reproduces. This figure, however, is so true to life that\r\none feels like keeping out of the range of the quoit when it flies (Fig.\r\n22). There are several other existing works attributed to Myron: they\r\nare a marble copy of his statue of Marsyas, in the Lateran at Rome; two\r\ntorsi in the gallery at Florence; a figure called Diomed, and a bronze\r\nin the gallery at Munich.\r\n\r\nMyron made statues of gods and heroes, but he excelled in representing\r\nathletes. His works were very numerous, and a list of those which are\r\nonly known through the mention of them by various writers would be of\r\nlittle value here. While Myron reproduced the form and action of the\r\nbody with marvellous effect, he made no advance in representing the\r\nexpression of the face, nor in the treatment of the hair. He was daring\r\nin his art, for he not only imitated what he saw in life, but he also\r\nrepresented grotesque imaginary creatures, and in many ways proved that\r\nhe had a rich creative fancy.\r\n\r\nA third sculptor of this time was CALAMIS, who was in his prime about\r\nB.C. 450. He was not born in Athens, but he worked there. Calamis added\r\nto the exact representations of Pythagoras and Myron the element of\r\ngrace beyond their powers in that direction. He made a greater variety\r\nof figures than they, for to gods and heroes he added heroines, boys and\r\nhorses. His works were in bronze, gold and ivory, as well as marble. But\r\nwhat we know of Calamis is gathered from the writings of Greek authors\r\nrather than from works, or copies of works, by him still existing;\r\nindeed, no statue remains known to be his own, though there are some\r\nwhich critics fancy may be so. But we may be certain of his great\r\nexcellence from the many praises sung and said of him, and Lucian, who\r\nknew all the best works of all the greatest masters of Greece, puts\r\nCalamis before them all for elegance and grace, and for the finer\r\nexpression of faces; when imagining a beautiful statue of a young girl\r\nhe declares that he would go to Calamis to impart to it a chaste modesty\r\nand give it a sweet and unaffected smile.\r\n\r\nPHIDIAS is the most famous of all Greek sculptors, and as Greek\r\nsculpture is the finest sculpture of which we have any knowledge, it\r\nfollows that Phidias was the first sculptor of the world. And yet, in\r\nspite of his fame, we do not know the time of his birth. We know that he\r\nwas the son of Charmidas, but we know nothing of the father except that\r\nhe had a brother who was a painter, and this makes it probable that the\r\nfamily of Phidias were artists.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as can be told, Phidias was born about B.C. 500. This would\r\nhave made him ten years old at the time of the battle of Marathon and\r\ntwenty years old when Salamis was fought, while he came of age at the\r\ntime of Platæa. He seems to have begun his artistic life as a painter,\r\nand we know nothing of him as an independent sculptor until the\r\nadministration of Cimon, about B.C. 471. But his finest works belong to\r\nthe time of Pericles, who was his friend as well as patron, and made him\r\nthe master over all the great public works at Athens during what we\r\nspeak of as the Periclean age.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the favor of Pericles was a dear privilege to Phidias, for\r\nit exposed him to bitter envy and hatred; and those who feared to attack\r\nPericles himself avenged themselves upon Phidias, and accused him of\r\ndishonesty in obtaining the gold for the robe of the statue of Minerva\r\nwhich he made for the Parthenon. He proved himself innocent of this,\r\nbut he was accused of other crimes, and one account says that he was\r\nthrown into prison and died there of disease or poison. Another account\r\nrelates that the great sculptor went into exile at Elis, where he made\r\nhis most famous statue, the Olympian Zeus, and that he was there\r\nconvicted of theft and put to death. With such contradictory stories we\r\ncannot know the exact truth; but we do know that he went to Elis\r\naccompanied by distinguished artists. He was received with honor, and\r\nfor a long time the studio that he occupied there was shown to\r\nstrangers. The Olympians also allowed him an honor which the Athenians\r\nnever extended to him--that is, to inscribe his name upon the base of\r\nthe statue of Zeus, which he was not permitted to do in the case of the\r\nMinerva (or Athena) of the Parthenon.\r\n\r\nIt often happens in the case of a very great man that the events which\r\nhave preceded his manhood have prepared the way for him and his work in\r\nso striking a manner that it seems as if he could not have been great at\r\nany other time, and that he could not avoid being so, when everything\r\nhad been shaped to his advantage. This was true of Phidias. When he came\r\nto be a man the dreadful wars which had ravaged Greece were over, and\r\nthe destruction of the older structures prepared the way for the\r\nrebuilding of Athens. Large quantities of \"marble, bronze, ivory, gold,\r\nebony and cypress wood\" were there, and a great number of skilful\r\nworkmen were at hand to work under his command. The Athenians were\r\nablaze with zeal to rebuild the temples and shrines of their gods, who,\r\nas they believed, had led them to their victories, and not only the\r\npublic, but the private means were used to make Athens the grandest and\r\nmost beautiful city of the world.\r\n\r\nThe first great work with which the name of Phidias was connected was\r\nthe building of the temple of Theseus, called also the Theseion. This\r\nwas a very important temple, and was constructed in obedience to the\r\ncommand of an oracle in this wise: In B.C. 470 the island of Scyros had\r\nbeen taken by the Athenians, and upon this island Theseus had been\r\nburied. After the battle of Marathon, in which he had aided the\r\nAthenians, Theseus was much regarded by them, and in B.C. 476 they were\r\ndirected to remove his bones to Athens and build over them a shrine\r\nworthy of so great a champion. Just then a gigantic skeleton was\r\ndiscovered at Scyros by Cimon, and was brought to Athens with great\r\nceremony, and laid to rest with pompous respect, and the splendid temple\r\ndedicated to Theseus was begun, and Phidias was commissioned to make its\r\nplastic ornaments. The precincts of this temple later became a sanctuary\r\nwhere the poor man and the slave could be safe from the oppressor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--ATHENIAN COINS WITH THE MINERVA PROMACHOS.]\r\n\r\nPhidias executed many works under the patronage of Cimon, the greatest\r\nof which was the colossal statue of Minerva, which stood on the\r\nAcropolis. It was called the \"Minerva Promachos,\" and was so gigantic\r\nthat \"the crest of her helmet and the point of her spear could be seen\r\nby the mariner off the promontory of Sunium glittering in the sunlight\r\nas a welcome to her own chosen people, and an awful warning to her\r\nfoes.\" The meaning of Promachos may be given as champion or guardian,\r\nand we know from existing descriptions that, with its pedestal, it must\r\nhave been at least seventy feet in height. It was made from the spoils\r\ntaken at Marathon; its pedestal was found, in 1840, standing between the\r\nParthenon and the Erechtheium. It has been called the \"Pallas with the\r\ngolden spear,\" for this goddess was known as Athena, Minerva, and\r\nPallas, and it is said that Alaric was so impressed by its awful aspect\r\nthat he shrank from it in horror. The only representations of this\r\nstatue now in existence are upon Athenian coins, and the position of the\r\ngoddess differs in these, as you will see by the illustration (Fig. 23);\r\nthere are reasons for believing that the one in which the shield rests\r\nupon the ground is correct, one of which is that some years after the\r\ndeath of Phidias the inside of the shield was ornamented by a relief of\r\nthe battle of the Centaurs.\r\n\r\nThough Phidias proved himself to be a great artist during the reign of\r\nCimon, it was not until the time of Pericles that he reached the\r\nglorious height of his genius. Pericles and Phidias seem to have been\r\ntwo grand forces working in harmony for the political and artistic\r\ngrandeur of Athens, and, indeed, of all Attica, for within a period of\r\ntwenty years nearly all the great works of that country were begun and\r\ncompleted. Plutarch writes of these wonders in these words: \"Hence we\r\nhave the more reason to wonder that the structures raised by Pericles\r\nshould be built in so short a time, and yet built for ages. For as each\r\nof them, as soon as it was finished, had the venerable air of antiquity,\r\nso now that they are old they have the freshness of a modern building. A\r\nbloom is diffused over them which preserves their aspect untarnished by\r\ntime, as if they were animated with a spirit of perpetual youth and\r\nunfading elegance.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible that I should speak here of the works of Phidias\r\nin detail, and I have decided to speak only of the frieze of the\r\nParthenon, because the Elgin marbles enable us to give illustrations\r\nfrom it and to know more about this than of the other works of the great\r\nmasters about whom whole volumes might be written with justice. But,\r\nfirst, I will give a picture of a coin which shows the great Olympian\r\nZeus, or Jupiter, which Phidias made at Elis, after he was an exile from\r\nAthens (Fig. 24). When Phidias was asked how he had found a model for\r\nthis Jupiter, he quoted the lines from Homer:\r\n\r\n   \"He said, and nodded with his shadowy brows,\r\n   Waved on the immortal head the ambrosial locks,\r\n   And all Olympus trembled at the nod.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--COIN OF ELIS WITH THE OLYMPIAN ZEUS.]\r\n\r\nThe writings of the ancients have almost numberless references to this\r\nstatue, and its praise is unending. It was colossal in size and made of\r\nivory and gold, and one historian says that though the temple had great\r\nheight, yet the Jupiter was so large that if he had risen from his\r\nthrone he must have carried the roof away. It is related that when the\r\nwork was completed Phidias prayed to Jupiter to give him a sign from\r\nheaven that he might know whether his work was pleasing to the great god\r\nor not. This prayer was answered, and a flash of lightning came which\r\nstruck the pavement in front of the statue. This statue was reckoned\r\namong the seven wonders of the world, and it is believed that the\r\nmagnificent bust called the \"Jupiter Otricoli\" is a copy from the\r\nOlympian statue (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--BUST OF JUPITER FOUND AT OTRICOLI.]\r\n\r\nI shall speak in another volume (upon Architecture) of the former glory\r\nand the present ruin of the Parthenon at Athens, and tell how upon its\r\ndecoration Phidias lavished his thought and care until it surpassed in\r\nbeauty any other structure of which we have knowledge. Early in the\r\npresent century Lord Elgin, the English Ambassador to the Porte,\r\ninterested himself in having the sculptures found in the ruins taken to\r\nEngland. In 1812 eighty chests containing these priceless works of the\r\ngreatest sculptor who ever lived were placed in Burlington House, and a\r\nfew years later Parliament purchased them for £35,000, and they were\r\nplaced in the British Museum, where they now are. There is a great\r\nnumber of them, and all are of great interest; but I shall pass over the\r\nmetopes and the pediments, and shall pass to the frieze after speaking\r\nof this one figure of Theseus, which is from the sculptures of the\r\neastern pediment. The sculptures upon this pediment represented the\r\nstory of the birth of Athena, and it was proper that Theseus should be\r\npresent, as he was king over Athens, of which city Athena, or Minerva,\r\nwas the protecting goddess. Torso is a term used in sculpture to denote\r\na mutilated figure, and many such remains of ancient sculpture exist\r\nwhich are so beautiful, even in their ruin, that they are the pride of\r\nthe museums where they are, and serve as studies for the artists of all\r\ntime. This figure of Theseus is wonderful for the majesty and grace of\r\nits attitude, for perfection of its anatomical accuracy, and for the\r\nappearance of elasticity of muscle with which it impresses one, even\r\nthough made of marble. It really seems as if the skin could be moved\r\nupon it, so soft does its surface look to be. It is ranked as the\r\ngreatest miracle of sculpture. Though it is called a Theseus, I ought to\r\nstate that some critics take exceptions to this name, and believe it to\r\nbe Hercules or Bacchus; but by almost general consent it is called a\r\nTheseus (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--TORSO OF A STATUE OF THESEUS (?).]\r\n\r\nWe may imagine that the representation upon this eastern pediment must\r\nhave been magnificent. Of course the chosen goddess of Athens would be\r\nmade to appear with great glory. The myth relates that Athena was born\r\nin an instant, by springing forth from the head of Zeus, or Jupiter,\r\nfully armed. It is believed that in this sculpture she was represented a\r\nmoment after birth when she appeared in full, colossal majesty, shouting\r\nher war-cry and waving her lance--something as these lines represent the\r\nscene:\r\n\r\n                 \"Wonder strange possessed\r\n   The everlasting gods, that shape to see\r\n   Shaking a javelin keen, impetuously\r\n   Rush from the crest of ægis-bearing Jove.\r\n   Fearfully Heaven was shaken, and did move\r\n   Beneath the might of the Cærulean-eyed\r\n   Earth dreadfully surrounded far and wide,\r\n   And lifted from its depths; the sea swelled high\r\n   In purple billows.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very important, when considering the sculpture at Athens, to know\r\nsomething about the character of this goddess whose power and influence\r\nwas so great there. I shall give an extract from an English writer on\r\nGreek sculpture, Mr. Walter Copeland Perry:\r\n\r\n\"It is a very remarkable fact, and one which gives us a deep insight\r\ninto the character of the Athenians, that the central figure in their\r\nreligion, the most perfect representative of their feelings, thoughts,\r\nand aspirations, was not Zeus or Hera (Juno), nor the most popular gods\r\nof all times and nations, Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus), but Athena,\r\nthe virgin, the goddess of wise counsel and brave deed! She was\r\nenthroned in the very heart of their citadel; and she stood in colossal\r\ngrandeur on the battlements to terrify their foes, and to give the first\r\nwelcome to the mariner or the exile when he approached his divine and\r\nbeautiful home, which reposed in safety under the protection of her\r\nlance and shield.\"\r\n\r\nThe attributes of this goddess, as given in Greek literature and shown\r\nforth in Greek art, are very varied and hard to be understood as\r\nbelonging to one person. She is the patroness of war, and in Homer's\r\nIliad she is represented as rushing into battle in this wise:\r\n\r\n   \"The cuirass donn'd of cloud-compelling force\r\n   And stood accoutred for the bloody fray.\r\n   Her tasselled ægis round her shoulders next\r\n   She threw, with terror circled all around,\r\n   And on its face were figured deeds of arms\r\n   And Strife and Courage high, and panic Rout.\r\n   There too a Gorgon's head of monstrous size\r\n   Frown'd terrible, portent of angry Jove.\r\n   . . . . . . . In her hand\r\n   A spear she bore, long, weighty, tough, wherewith\r\n   The mighty daughter of a mighty sire\r\n   Sweeps down the ranks of those her hate pursues.\"\r\n\r\nBut this warlike goddess is also represented as the wise counsellor who\r\nrestrains Achilles from rash action; and though she does not shrink from\r\nwar and danger, yet the most precious gift to her people was not the\r\nwar-horse, but the olive, the emblem of peace, and to her honor was this\r\nsacred tree planted. \"She stands in full armor, with brandished lance,\r\non the highest point of the Acropolis, and yet she is the patroness of\r\nall household and female work, in which she herself excels.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to notice that in the early representations of\r\nAthena, while she is very warlike in her bearing and raises her lance in\r\nher right hand, she also carries in her left the distaff and the spindle\r\nand the lamp of knowledge. In the later art of Phidias she is still\r\nstern and severe, but her face also expresses dignity and grandeur of\r\nthought and character. Later still, her warlike attributes are made less\r\nprominent: the shield rests on the ground, and the lance is more like a\r\nsceptre, until, in the decline of art, she is represented as lovely and\r\ngentle, and all her grand power is lost, and she is not above a great\r\nnumber of other goddesses who are attractive for their soft, lovely\r\ngrace, but have no selfhood, no individuality to command our admiration\r\nor respect.\r\n\r\nWe come now to speak of the Elgin marbles from the frieze of the\r\nParthenon. It was about thirty-five feet above the floor, three feet\r\nthree inches broad, and about five hundred and twenty-two feet long. It\r\nrepresented a continuous procession, and the subject is called the\r\ngreat Panathenaic Procession. About four hundred feet of this frieze\r\nremains, so that a good judgment can be formed of it. First I must tell\r\nyou what this procession means. The festival of the Panathenæa was the\r\nmost important of all the splendid pomps which were celebrated at\r\nAthens. It is probable that this festival was held every year about the\r\nmiddle of August, but _the great Panathenaic_ occurred only in the third\r\nyear of each olympiad; an olympiad was a period of four years, extending\r\nfrom one celebration of the Olympic games to another, which was an event\r\nof great importance in reckoning time with the Greeks; thus we see that\r\nthe great procession represented on the frieze occurred once in every\r\nfour years. This festival continued several days, and all were filled\r\nwith horse-racing, cock-fighting, gymnastic and musical contests, and a\r\ngreat variety of games; poets also recited their verses, and\r\nphilosophers held arguments in public places.[A] But the most important\r\nday was that on which a procession went up to the Parthenon and carried\r\nthe peplos, or garment for the great goddess, which had been woven by\r\nthe maidens of Athens. This peplos was made of crocus-colored stuff, on\r\nwhich the figures of the gods engaged in their contests with the giants\r\nappeared in beautiful, rich embroidery. In later years, after the\r\nAthenians had fallen from their first high-minded simplicity, they\r\nsometimes embroidered on the peplos the likeness of a man whom they\r\nwished to flatter, as thus placing him in the company of the gods was a\r\nvery great compliment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In the Persian invasion of Greece by Xerxes, B.C. 480, that\r\nmonarch was surprised to learn that the Olympic games were not suspended\r\nat the approach of his army.]\r\n\r\nThe procession of the peplos was formed at daybreak in the Potters'\r\nQuarter of the city, and passed to the Dromos, then to the market-place,\r\nonward to the temple of Demeter, round the Acropolis along the Pelasgic\r\nwall, through the Propylæa to the temple of Athena Polias. The\r\nprocession was as splendid as all the wealth, nobility, youth and beauty\r\nof Athens could make it. Of the vast multitude which joined it some were\r\nin chariots, others on horses and almost countless numbers on foot.\r\nAfter the most important officers of the government come the envoys of\r\nthe Attic colonies with the noble Athenian maidens, the basket-bearers,\r\nthe aliens who resided in Athens dressed in red instead of white, and a\r\nchosen company of aged men bearing branches of the sacred olive.\r\n\r\nThe peplos was not borne by hands, but was suspended from the mast of a\r\nship, upon wheels, which some writers say was moved by machinery placed\r\nunderground. When the temple was reached the splendid garment was placed\r\nupon the sacred statue, which was believed to have fallen from heaven.\r\nDuring the festival of the Panathenæa prisoners were permitted to enjoy\r\ntheir freedom, men whose services to the public merited recognition\r\nreceived gifts of gold crowns, and their names were announced by heralds\r\nin public places, and many interesting ceremonies filled up the time. We\r\ndo not know the exact order in which all these things happened; but it\r\nis believed that the procession of the peplos was the crowning glory of\r\nit all, and was celebrated on the final day.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Parthenon frieze which represented this great procession\r\nwas as follows: On the eastern side above the main entrance to the\r\ntemple there were two groups of the most important and powerful of the\r\nmany gods of the Greek religion. Each of these groups had six gods and\r\nan attendant, so that there were seven figures in each of these groups,\r\nas you will see by the illustration (Fig. 27).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nThere has been much study of these sculptures, and many scholars have\r\nwritten about them. There is still a difference of opinion as to which\r\ngods are here represented, but I shall give you the most generally\r\naccepted opinion, which calls _a_, Hermes, or Mercury, the messenger of\r\nthe gods; _b_, Apollo; _c_, Artemis, or Diana; _d_, Ares, or Mars; _e_,\r\nIris, who is attending upon _f_, Hera, or Juno; _g_, Zeus, or Jupiter;\r\nh__, Athena, Minerva, or Pallas; _i_, Hephæstus, or Vulcan; _j_,\r\nPoseidon, or Neptune; _k_, Dionysus, or Bacchus; _l_, _m_, _n_ are more\r\ndoubtful, but are probably Aphrodite, or Venus, Demeter, or Ceres, and\r\nTriptolemus, the boy who was a favorite with Ceres, who invented the\r\nplough and first sowed corn.\r\n\r\nNow, these two groups of divinities were divided by a very singular\r\ngroup containing five figures (Fig. 28).\r\n\r\nThere has been much controversy as to these figures and what they are\r\ndoing. They seem to be unconscious of the great gods who are near to\r\nthem on either side. The greater number of critics consider that the two\r\nmaidens, _e_ and _d_, are of the number who have embroidered the\r\npeplos; the central figure, _c_, a priestess of Athena; _a_, the Archon\r\nBasileus; and _b_, a consecrated servant-boy, who is delivering up the\r\npeplos. Other critics believe, however, that these figures are all\r\npreparing for the sacred ceremonies about to begin, and that the priest\r\nis giving the boy-servant a garment which he has taken off. Other\r\ntheories may arise, and we can only listen to them all, and yet not know\r\nthe truth; but the more we study the more we shall admire these\r\nexquisite figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--THE FIVE CENTRAL FIGURES.]\r\n\r\nJust here I will call your attention to one feature of these antique\r\nbas-reliefs which is called _Isocephalism_, and means that all the heads\r\nare at an equal height. You will see that all figures, whether standing\r\nor sitting, walking, in chariots, or on horseback, have the heads on the\r\nsame level.\r\n\r\nThese three groups, the five central figures and the two groups of gods,\r\nare approached on each side by long, continuous processions, and these\r\nprocessions each start out from the south-west corner of the Parthenon,\r\nso that one branch goes along the south and a part of the east side, and\r\nthe other and longer division marches on the whole of the west and\r\nnorth, and a portion of the east side. I shall give here a series of\r\npictures which are all explained by their titles, and will give you an\r\nexcellent idea of this magnificent frieze, and doubtless many of my\r\nreaders have studied or will study and admire it in the British Museum\r\n(Figs. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29--YOUTHS PREPARING TO JOIN THE CAVALCADE.]\r\n\r\nThough all this frieze was the conception of the great Phidias, it must\r\nhave been the work of many hands, and close examination shows that some\r\nportions of it are done much better than others. These sculptures have a\r\ndouble value; for while they are so priceless as treasures of art, they\r\ntell us much of that prosperous, glorious Athens of which we love to\r\nread and hear stories. These figures show us how the people dressed and\r\nmoved, and we see in them the \"stately\" magistrates and venerable seers\r\nof Athens, the sacred envoys of dependent states, the victors in their\r\nchariots drawn by the steeds which had won for them the cheap but\r\npriceless garland, the full-armed warriors, the splendid cavalry, and\r\nthe noble youths of 'horse-loving' Athens on their favorite steeds,\r\nin the flush and pride of their young life; and last, not least, the\r\ntrain of high-born Athenian maidens, marching with bowed heads and quiet\r\ngait, for they are engaged in holy work, with modest mien, and gentle\r\ndignity and grace. All that was sacred, powerful, and grand--all that\r\nwas beautiful, graceful, and joyous in Athenian life, is represented\r\nthere, in ideal form, of course, but in strict conformity with the\r\nrealities of life.... It is by the study of such works as these that we\r\nget the clearest insight into the essence and spirit of classical\r\nantiquity; and they help us better to understand all that we may read in\r\nhistory or poetry concerning the ancient, classic Greeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--HORSEMEN STARTING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--PROCESSION OF CAVALRY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--PROCESSION OF CHARIOTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--TRAIN OF MUSICIANS AND YOUTHS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--COWS FOR SACRIFICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--TRAIN OF NOBLE MAIDENS.]\r\n\r\nWe must now leave Phidias and speak of other sculptors who were his\r\ncontemporaries and pupils. Among the last ALCAMENES was the most\r\ncelebrated. He was born in Lemnos, but was a citizen of Athens; so he is\r\nsometimes called an Athenian, and again a Lemnian. His statues were\r\nnumerous, and most of them represented the gods. One of Hephæstus, or\r\nVulcan, was remarkable for the way in which his lameness was concealed\r\nso skilfully that no deformity appeared.\r\n\r\nHis most famous statue was a Venus, or Aphrodite, concerning which it is\r\nrelated that Agoracritus, another celebrated pupil of Phidias, contended\r\nwith Alcamenes in making a statue of that goddess. The preference was\r\ngiven to Alcamenes, and Agoracritus believed this to have been done on\r\naccount of his being an Athenian citizen, and not solely for the merit\r\nof the statue. The Venus of Alcamenes stood in a temple of that goddess\r\nin a garden beyond the eastern wall of Athens. This statue was very much\r\npraised for its beauty by ancient writers, who all mention with especial\r\npride the _eurythmy_ of the action of the wrist. This is a term\r\nfrequently used in regard to sculpture, and is somewhat difficult to\r\nexplain. It means a harmony and proportion of action which corresponds\r\nto rhythm in music. When a statue has the effect it should have it\r\nappears as if the motion of the figure was arrested for a moment, and\r\nwould be resumed immediately. That is what we mean when we say a statue\r\nhas life; and, as in life, the motion of a statue may be awkward or it\r\nmay be graceful; it may be harmonious to the eye, just as music is\r\nharmonious to the ear, or it may seem out of tune and time, just as\r\ninharmonious sounds are to a correct ear for the rhythm of sound; so\r\nwhen we speak of the eurythmy of sculpture we mean that its apparent\r\nmotion is in accord with the laws of proportion, and is harmonious and\r\ngraceful to the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--HEAD OF ASCLEPIUS. _In the British Museum._]\r\n\r\nWhile Alcamenes had this power of imparting grace to his statues, he\r\nalso approached Phidias in majesty and a divine sweetness, which was the\r\nsweetness of great strength. In truth, he is recognized as the sculptor\r\nwho most nearly approached the great Phidias. He represented also for\r\nthe first time the god Asclepius, or Æsculapius, who was very important\r\nto the Greeks, who placed great value upon physical health. Alcamenes\r\nrepresented him as a sort of humanized Zeus or Jupiter. Of the Asclepius\r\nheads found at Melos we may regard this one given here as a free copy of\r\nthe type of god which this great sculptor represented the god of\r\nmedicine and health to be (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\nAlcamenes was also the principal assistant of Phidias in his decoration\r\nof the temple of Jupiter at Olympia, and is said to have himself\r\nexecuted the relief upon the western pediment, in which the battle of\r\nthe Centaurs and Lapithæ was represented with great spirit.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS of Paros, who has been mentioned as the rival of Alcamenes,\r\nis called the favorite pupil of Phidias, and it is said that the master\r\neven gave Agoracritus some of his works, and allowed the pupil to\r\ninscribe his name upon them. For this reason the ancient writers were\r\noften in doubt as to the authorship of the statues called by the names\r\nof these sculptors. It is said that when the Venus of Alcamenes was\r\npreferred before that of Agoracritus the latter changed his mark, and\r\nmade it to represent a Nemesis, or the goddess who sent suffering to\r\nthose who were blessed with too many gifts. It is said that this statue\r\nwas cut from a block of marble which the Persians brought with them to\r\nMarathon for the purpose of making a trophy of it which they could set\r\nup to commemorate the victory they felt so sure of gaining; in their\r\nflight and adversity it was left, and at last served a Greek sculptor in\r\nmaking a statue of an avenging goddess. This seems to be a striking\r\nillustration of \"poetic justice.\"\r\n\r\nAgoracritus sold the Nemesis to the people of Rhamnus, who had a temple\r\ndedicated to that goddess, and made a condition that it should never be\r\nset up in Athens. In the museum of the Lateran at Rome there is a small\r\nbut very beautiful antique statue of Nemesis, which is thought to be a\r\ncopy of this famous work. As Nemesis was the goddess who meted out\r\nfortune according to her idea of right, a measure was her symbol, and\r\nthe Greek measure of a cubit was generally placed in her hand. The word\r\ncubit means the length of the forearm from the elbow to the wrist, and\r\nin this statue of which we speak this part of the arm is made very\r\nprominent, and the measure itself is omitted.\r\n\r\nThe sculptor Myron also had pupils and followers who executed many\r\nworks, and of this school was CRESILAS of Cydonia, in Crete. We are\r\ninterested in him because two copies from his works exist, of which I\r\ngive pictures here. Pliny, in speaking of the portrait statue of\r\nPericles, said it was a marvel of the art \"which makes illustrious men\r\nstill more illustrious.\" The cut given here is from a bust in the\r\nBritish Museum. There is reason to believe that Cresilas excelled Myron\r\nin the expression of his faces (Figs. 37, 38).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--A WOUNDED AMAZON. _Cresilas._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--STATUE OF PERICLES. _Cresilas._]\r\n\r\nCALLIMACHUS is an artist of whom we know little, but that little is\r\ninteresting. We do not know where he was born, but as he was employed to\r\nmake a candelabra for the eternal lamp which burned before the sacred\r\nstatue of Athena Polias, we may suppose that he was an Athenian. Some\r\nwriters say that he invented a lamp which would burn a year without\r\ngoing out, and that such an one made of gold was the work he did for the\r\ntemple of Minerva. Callimachus lived between B.C. 550 and 396, and is\r\ncredited with having invented the Corinthian capital in this wise: A\r\nyoung girl of Corinth died, and her nurse, according to custom, placed a\r\nbasket upon her grave containing the food she had loved best in life. It\r\nchanced that the basket was put down upon a young acanthus plant, and\r\nthe leaves grew up about the basket in such a way that when Callimachus\r\nsaw it the design for the capital which we know as Corinthian was\r\nsuggested to him, and was thus named from the city in which all this had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nWhile the plastic art of Athens, or the Attic school of sculpture,\r\nreached its greatest excellence in Phidias, there was in the\r\nPeloponnesus another school of much importance. Argos was the chief city\r\nof this school, and its best master was POLYCLEITUS of Sicyon, who was\r\nborn about B.C. 482. He was thus about twelve years younger than\r\nPhidias. Polycleitus was held in such esteem that many of the ancient\r\nwriters couple his name with that of Phidias. He was employed in the\r\ndecoration of the Heraion, or temple of Hera, at Argos. But his greatest\r\nwork was a statue of Hera, or Juno, for a temple on Mount Euboea,\r\nbetween Argos and Mycenæ. This statue was chryselephantine, and as Juno\r\nwas the majestic, white-armed, ox-eyed goddess consort of Jupiter, it is\r\na striking coincidence that Phidias at Olympia and Polycleitus on Mount\r\nEuboea should have made from ivory and gold two famous statues of this\r\nrenowned pair, who reigned over the mythical world of the Greek\r\nreligion. There are several copies of heads of Juno in various museums,\r\nand some of them have been ascribed to Polycleitus; but the proof of the\r\ntruth of this is far from being satisfactory. This master made other\r\nstatues of divinities, but he excelled in representing athletes; and\r\nhowever fine his other works may have been, it was in the reproduction\r\nof strong, youthful, manly beauty that he surpassed other sculptors.\r\nSome of his statues of this sort, especially a Doryphorus, or\r\nspear-bearer, were considered as models from which all other artists\r\ncould work.\r\n\r\nPolycleitus is said to have written a treatise in which he gave exact\r\nrules for the proportions of the different parts of the body. This was\r\ncalled \"the canon\" of Polycleitus, and there is good reason to believe\r\nthat the Doryphorus was called by the same name, \"the canon,\" because it\r\nwas fashioned according to the rules laid down by Polycleitus in his\r\ntreatise. His pupils and followers are mentioned with honor by the Greek\r\nauthors of his time, but I need not mention them here.\r\n\r\nThe art of Phidias and Polycleitus was the art of Greece at its best\r\nperiod. After the close of the Persian wars the people of Greece were a\r\nreligious and patriotic people. The Persian wars developed the best\r\nquality of character, for these wars were waged against a foreign foe,\r\nand the Greeks were defending their freedom and their civilization, and\r\nat the end of the struggle Pericles, who guided them to their greatest\r\nprosperity, was a statesman and a man of high aims; he was a gentleman\r\nas well as a strong ruler. The Peloponnesian war, on the contrary, was a\r\ncivil war, and it divided the Greeks among themselves and roused the\r\nevil passions of friend against friend all over their country. It was\r\nthe cause of selfishness, treachery, and immorality, and one of its\r\nworst effects was seen in the loss of religious tone among the people:\r\ntheir old contented simplicity of life and thought was gone; every man\r\nthought only of himself, and the nation began to sink into the condition\r\nwhich at last made it an easy prey to the Macedonians. We have studied\r\nall these wars in our histories, but perhaps we have not thought how\r\nmuch they affected sculpture and the other arts, and brought them down\r\nfrom the lofty heights of the Periclean age.\r\n\r\nBut there were still men who strove to be great and grand in morals and\r\nin intellect, and perhaps strove all the more earnestly for this on\r\naccount of the decline they saw about them. Few countries in any age\r\nhave had more splendid men than Socrates, Plato, Euripides,\r\nAristophanes, Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Demosthenes, Dion, and Timoleon,\r\nand these all lived between the Peloponnesian and the Macedonian wars.\r\nAnd while the arts were less grand than before, they did not fall into\r\ndecline for some years, though they took on new features. The gods who\r\nhad been mostly represented were less often the subjects of the\r\nsculptor, and when they were so they were softened and made less awful\r\nin their effect. Other gods were more freely taken for models, such as\r\ncame nearer to human life and thought, because less sublime in their\r\nattributes and characters. Among these were Venus as a lovely woman\r\nrather than as the great mother of all living creatures, and Eros, or\r\nLove; while Plutus, or Wealth, and satyrs, nymphs, and tritons were\r\nmultiplied in great numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen the gods who were represented were more like human beings in their\r\ncharacter, it followed that the statues of them more nearly resembled\r\nmen and women, and gradually the old grandeur and sublimity were changed\r\nto grace, beauty, and mirth. Many people would prefer these works\r\nbecause they come nearer to the every-day life of the world; but\r\nearnest, thoughtful minds look for something more noble in\r\nart--something that will not come down to us as we are, but will help us\r\nto rise above ourselves and to strive after better things.\r\n\r\nCEPHISODOTUS was a sculptor who lived until about B.C. 385, or a little\r\nlater, and stood between the old and the new schools of Greek art. The\r\ncut given here is from a group at Munich, which is believed to be a copy\r\nof a work by him, and it is a combination of the simple dignity of the\r\nart of Phidias (which is seen in the flowing drapery and the wavy edge\r\nof its folds) and the later Attic style (which is seen in the dreamy,\r\ngentle air of the face of the nurse of the little god). (Fig. 39.) We\r\nknow very little of the life of Cephisodotus, and as little is said of\r\nhis works by ancient writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--EIRENE AND THE YOUNG PLUTUS. _Cephisodotus._]\r\n\r\nSCOPAS of Paros was one of the greatest sculptors of the later Attic\r\nschool. The island of Paros, where he was born, was the place where the\r\nfinest Greek marble was found; but he worked so much at Athens that he\r\nis spoken of as an Athenian. He was an architect as well as a sculptor,\r\nand he superintended the erection of some splendid structures, which he\r\nalso ornamented with his sculptures. I shall speak especially of the\r\ntomb of Mausolus, the King of Caria. Scopas executed the sculptures of\r\nthe east side, and as he was the best artist of the sculptors employed\r\nthere, it is probable that he had much to do with the design for all the\r\nwork. This mausoleum was reckoned as one of the \"seven wonders of the\r\nworld,\" and has given a name to fine tombs the world over.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the sculptures from this tomb which are now in\r\nthe British Museum seems to me to be the statue of Mausolus himself. It\r\nis plainly intended to be an exact portrait of the king, and it is so\r\ndesigned and executed that we feel sure it must show him to us just as\r\nhe was when alive, more than twenty-two hundred years ago (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\nA part of the frieze upon the mausoleum showed the battle of the Greeks\r\nand the Amazons, and this illustration from it gives an idea of the\r\nboldness of action and the correctness of the design (Fig. 41). This\r\npicture is from a slab in the possession of the Serra family in Genoa.\r\nOn the right a warrior holds down an Amazon whom he has forced to her\r\nknees and is about to kill, while she stretches out her right hand in\r\nsupplication. The figures to the left are full of spirit, and absolutely\r\nseem to be in motion. We do not know that any of these figures were\r\nexecuted by the hand of Scopas, but it is probable that they were, and\r\nthey give us an idea of the art of his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--PORTRAIT OF MAUSOLUS.]\r\n\r\nScopas also carved one of the splendid pillars of the temple of Diana at\r\nEphesus, and did much architectural decoration, as well as to execute\r\nmany statues and groups of figures. The ancient writers say very little\r\nof the art of Scopas, but when all that we can learn is brought\r\ntogether, it shows that he had great fertility in expressing his own\r\nideas, that his genius was creative and his works original. He\r\nrepresented the gods which the earlier sculptors had shown in their\r\nworks in quite a new manner, and he was the first to show the goddess\r\nVenus in all the beauty which imagination could attribute to her. His\r\nrepresentations of nymphs of wood and sea, of monsters, and all sorts of\r\nstrange, imaginary beings were numberless, and he made his sculptured\r\nfigures to express every emotion that can be fancied or felt, from the\r\ntenderest and sweetest affection to the wildest passions of the soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41--FROM THE FRIEZE OF THE MAUSOLEUM.]\r\n\r\nHis works were always representations of gods or of sentiments as shown\r\nby some superhuman beings; he never portrayed a hero, with the\r\nexception of Hercules, and was ever busy with the ideal rather than with\r\nrealities about him. He worked in marble only, which is far more suited\r\nto the elegant beauty of his style than are bronze and gold or ivory.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to call PRAXITELES the greatest sculptor of the second\r\nschool of Greek art, just as we give that place to Phidias in the first.\r\nWe have no fixed dates concerning Praxiteles. We know that he was the\r\nson of a Cephisodotus, who was a bronze worker, and was thought to be a\r\nson of Alcamenes, thus making Praxiteles a grandson of the latter.\r\nPraxiteles was first instructed by his father. Later he came under the\r\ninfluence of Scopas, who was much older than he; and by Scopas he was\r\npersuaded to give up working in bronze and confine himself to marble.\r\nPerhaps the most authentic date we have concerning him is that given by\r\nPliny, who says that he was in his prime from B.C. 364-360.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to praise a sculptor more than Praxiteles was praised\r\nby the Greek authors; and, although Athens was the place where he lived\r\nand labored most, yet he was known to all Greece, and even to other\r\ncountries, and the number of his works was marvellous. There are\r\ntrustworthy accounts of forty-seven groups, reliefs, and statues by his\r\nhand, and it is not probable that these are all that he executed.\r\n\r\nPraxiteles represented youth and beauty and such subjects as are most\r\npleasing to popular taste. Thus it happened that his male figures were\r\nthe young Apollo, Eros, and youthful satyrs, while a large proportion of\r\nhis statues represented lovely women. Venus was frequently repeated by\r\nhim, and there is a story that he made two statues of her, one being\r\ndraped and the other nude. The people of Cos bought the first, and the\r\nlast was purchased by the Cnidians, who placed it in the midst of an\r\nopen temple, where it could be seen from all sides. It became so famous\r\nthat many people went to Cnidos solely for the purpose of seeing it, and\r\nthe \"Cnidian Venus\" acquired a reputation wherever art was known. When\r\nthe oppressor of the Cnidians, King Nicodemus of Bithynia, offered to\r\nrelease them from a debt of one hundred talents (about $100,000) if they\r\nwould give him the Venus, they refused, and declared that it was the\r\nchief glory of their State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--THE EROS OF CENTOCELLE.]\r\n\r\nAnother story relates that Phryne, a friend of Praxiteles, had been told\r\nby him that she could have any work which she might choose from his\r\nworkshop. She wished to have the one which the artist himself considered\r\nthe best. In order to find out which he so esteemed she sent a servant\r\nto tell him that his workshop was on fire. He exclaimed, \"All is lost if\r\nmy Satyr and Cupid are not saved!\" Then Phryne told him of her trick,\r\nand chose the Cupid, or Eros, for her gift. Phryne then offered the\r\nstatue to the temple of Thespiæ, in Boeotia, where it was placed\r\nbetween a statue of Venus and one of Phryne herself. This Cupid was\r\nalmost as celebrated as the Cnidian Venus, and was visited by many\r\npeople. The head given here (Fig. 42), which was found in Centocelle by\r\nGavin Hamilton, and is now in the Vatican, is thought by many to be a\r\ncopy of a Cupid by Praxiteles, and even of the Thespian statue; but we\r\nhave no proof of this. The Cupid, or Eros, of the art of Scopas and\r\nPraxiteles is not the merry little creature who bears that name in later\r\nart; he is a youth just coming into manhood, with a dreamy, melancholy\r\nface, the tender beauty of which makes him one of the most attractive\r\nsubjects in sculpture. Caligula carried the Thespian Cupid to Rome;\r\nClaudius restored it to its original place, but Nero again bore it to\r\nRome, where it was burned in a conflagration in the time of Titus.\r\n\r\nI shall say no more of Praxiteles personally, because I wish to describe\r\nto you the largest and grandest group of Greek statues which exists, or,\r\nas I should say, of which we have any copies. We do not know whether\r\nScopas or Praxiteles made these famous figures, since they are\r\nattributed to both these sculptors; perhaps we can never positively know\r\nto whom to ascribe the fame of this marvellous work. The historian Pliny\r\ntells us that they stood in the temple of Apollo Sosianus at Rome.\r\nSosius was the legate of Antony in Syria and Cilicia; he erected this\r\ntemple in his own honor, and brought many beautiful works from the East\r\nfor its decoration. It is believed that he brought the Niobe group from\r\nCilicia, and displayed it when celebrating his victory over Judea, B.C.\r\n35.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1583 a large number of statues representing this subject were\r\nfound in Rome, and were purchased by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who\r\nplaced them in the Villa Medici. In 1775 they were removed to the Palace\r\nof the Uffizi, in Florence, where an apartment was assigned to them. The\r\nfigures were restored, and each one placed on its own pedestal, which\r\nwork was not completed until 1794.\r\n\r\nThe group must have had originally seventeen figures--Niobe and fourteen\r\nchildren, a pedagogue and a female nurse. Now there are but\r\ntwelve--Niobe, six sons, four daughters, and the pedagogue. At first it\r\nwas supposed that these figures ornamented the temple pediment, but it\r\nis now thought that they stood on an undulating rocky base, with a\r\nbackground at a little distance. Niobe is the central figure, in any\r\ncase, and the children were fleeing toward her from either side; she is\r\nthe only one represented in such a way as to present the full face to\r\nthe beholder (Fig. 43). But we shall better understand our subject if I\r\nrecount as concisely as possible the story of Niobe, which, as you know,\r\nis a Grecian myth. Niobe was the daughter of Tantalus, and was born on\r\nMount Sipylus. When a child Niobe played with Lato, or Latona, who\r\nafterward married the great god Jupiter, or Zeus. Niobe became the wife\r\nof Amphion, and had a very happy life; she was the mother of seven sons\r\nand seven daughters, and all this prosperity made her forget that she\r\nwas mortal, and she dared to be insolent even to the gods themselves.\r\nLato had but two children, the beautiful Apollo and the archer-queen of\r\nheaven, called Diana, or Artemis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--NIOBE AND HER YOUNGEST DAUGHTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--BROTHER AND SISTER.]\r\n\r\nAmphion and Niobe were the King and Queen of Thebes, and when the\r\nworship of Lato was established in that city Niobe was very angry. She\r\nthought of Lato as her playmate and not a goddess, and was so imprudent\r\nas to drive in her chariot to the temple and command the Theban women\r\nnot to join in this worship. Niobe also asserted that she was superior\r\nto this Lato, who had but two children, while she had fourteen lovely\r\nsons and daughters, any one of which was worthy of honor. All this so\r\nenraged Lato that she begged Apollo, who was the god of the silver bow,\r\nand Diana, her huntress daughter, to take revenge on Niobe. Obedient to\r\nher commands, Apollo and Artemis descended to earth, and in one day slew\r\nall the children of Niobe. Then this proud mother, left alone, could do\r\nnothing but weep, and this she did continually until Jupiter took pity\r\non her and turned her into stone, and whirled her away from Thebes to\r\nMount Sipylus, the scene of her happy childhood. In this picture of\r\nNiobe she clasps her youngest child, who has fled to her for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nI cannot give pictures of all the figures, but one of the most\r\ninteresting is this brother and sister. She is wounded, and he endeavors\r\nto raise his garment so as to shield her and himself from the deadly\r\narrows which pursue them (Fig. 44).\r\n\r\nThis figure of the eldest daughter is very beautiful. An arrow has\r\npierced her neck, and the right hand is bent back to the wound. The face\r\nis noble and simple, and has been a favorite model to Guido Reni and\r\nother Italian masters (Fig. 45).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--THE ELDEST DAUGHTER.]\r\n\r\nFig. 46 shows one of the older sons, who, though wounded and fallen on\r\none knee, still looks toward his slayer with an air of defiance. There\r\nis a world of interest connected with these statues, and they move us\r\nwith a variety of emotions. The poor mother, so prosperous a moment\r\nbefore, and now seeing her children dying around her, slain by the sure\r\narrows of the unseen gods--how can we pity her enough! and then the\r\nbrave son who tries to shield his sister while he is dazed by the\r\nsuddenness of the misfortunes which he cannot account for; the old\r\npedagogue, to whom the youngest boy has run for protection--and,\r\nindeed, all demand our sympathy for their grief and our admiration for\r\ntheir beauty, which is still theirs in spite of their woe.\r\n\r\nOne of the young sculptors who was employed with Scopas in the work on\r\nthe mausoleum was LEOCHARES. We read of several statues of Zeus and\r\nApollo by this master, but his most celebrated work was the group of\r\nGanymede borne upward by the eagle of Zeus. There are several copies of\r\nthis sculpture, but that given here, from the Vatican figure, is the\r\nbest of all, and is very beautiful. We know very few facts concerning\r\nLeochares, and cannot even say whether he was an Athenian or not (Fig.\r\n47).\r\n\r\nThere is still standing at Athens, in its original place, the Choragic\r\nmonument of Lysicrates; and though we do not know the names of the\r\narchitects and sculptors who made it, there are traces upon it which\r\nindicate that it belonged to the school of Scopas (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--A NIOBID.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--GANYMEDE. _After Leochares._]\r\n\r\nThis monument was erected B.C. 334, when Lysicrates was _choragus_--that\r\nis, when it was his office to provide the chorus for the plays\r\nrepresented at Athens. This was an expensive office, and one that\r\ndemanded much labor and care. He had first to find the choristers, and\r\nthen bring them together to be instructed, and provide them with proper\r\nfood while they studied. The choragus who gave the best musical\r\nentertainment received a tripod as his reward, and it was the custom to\r\nbuild a monument upon which to place the tripod, so that it should be a\r\nlasting honor to the choragus and his family. The street in which these\r\nmonuments were erected was called \"the street of the Tripods.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also the custom to dedicate each tripod to some special divinity,\r\nand this of Lysicrates was dedicated to Bacchus, and had a frieze with\r\nsculptures telling the story of that god and the Tyrrhenian robbers who\r\nbore him off to their ship. In order to revenge himself he changed the\r\noars and masts into serpents and himself into a lion; music was heard,\r\nand ivy grew all over the vessel; the robbers went mad and leaped into\r\nthe sea, and changed into dolphins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--MONUMENT OF LYSICRATES. _Athens._]\r\n\r\nIn the frieze, however, it is represented that the god is on shore\r\nquietly amusing himself with the lion (Fig. 49), while satyrs and sileni\r\npunish the robbers by beating them with sticks and chasing them with\r\nfury, while they are turning gradually into dolphins and rushing into\r\nthe sea. The design is so fine that it might easily be attributed to one\r\nof the best sculptors; but the execution is careless, and this is not\r\nstrange when we remember that it was all done at the expense of one\r\nman, and he a private citizen.\r\n\r\nWe will return now to the Peloponnesian school, of which Polycleitus was\r\nthe head in its earliest period. After his time the sculptors of his\r\nschool continued to prefer the subjects in which he excelled, and\r\nrepresented youthful heroes and victors with as much industry as the\r\nartists of Athens bestowed upon their statues of womanly grace and\r\nbeauty. The subjects of the Peloponnesian school were especially suited\r\nto the use of bronze, and the chief sculptor of his time, LYSIPPUS,\r\nwhose works are said to have numbered fifteen hundred, worked entirely\r\nin bronze. In order to keep a record of the number of his works, he\r\nadopted the plan of putting aside one gold coin from the price of every\r\nstatue, and at his death his heirs are said to have found the above\r\nnumber of these coins thus laid away. His home was at Sicyon, and his\r\ntime of work is given as B.C. 372-316. This seems a long period for\r\nactive employment as a sculptor; but the number of his works accords\r\nwell with this estimate of his working years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--BACCHUS AND LION. _From the Lysicrates\r\nMonument._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--THE APOXYOMENOS OF LYSIPPUS.]\r\n\r\nLysippus cannot be said to have followed any school; he was original,\r\nand this trait made him prominent, for he was not bound by old customs,\r\nbut was able to adapt himself to the new spirit of the age, which came\r\nto Greece with the reign of Alexander. This sculptor made a great number\r\nof statues of Hercules; and as Alexander loved to regard himself as a\r\nmodern Hercules, Lysippus also represented the monarch in many different\r\nways, and with much the same spirit as that he put into the statues of\r\nthe hero-god. For example, he made a statue of \"Alexander with his\r\nSpear,\" \"Alexander at a Lion Hunt,\" \"Alexander as the Sun-God,\" and so\r\non through many changes of expression and attributes, but all being\r\nlikenesses of the great king. There is in the Capitol at Rome a head of\r\nAlexander called _Helios_, which is thought by many critics to be the\r\nbest bust of him in existence. There are metal rays fastened to the\r\nhead; it has a wild, Bacchus-like air, and the hair is thrown back, as\r\nif he had shaken his head furiously; and the defect of a wry neck, which\r\nthe monarch had, is cleverly concealed by this motion. Alexander was a\r\nvery handsome man, his faults being this twist in his neck and a\r\npeculiar shape of the eye.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here give the long list of works by Lysippus, but will speak\r\nof that which interests us most, because we have a beautiful copy of it.\r\nI mean the Apoxyomenos, which is in the Vatican. It represents a youth\r\nscraping himself (as the name denotes) with the strigil after a contest\r\nin the arena (Fig. 50). The Vatican copy was found in the Trastevere at\r\nRome in 1849, and is well preserved. Without doubt it is a faithful\r\nreproduction of the original, which was probably brought from Greece to\r\nRome by Agrippa, who set it up in front of his public baths. Here it\r\nbecame such a favorite with the people that when Tiberius removed it to\r\nhis own house there was a demonstration in the theatre, and so violent a\r\ndemand was made for its restoration that the cunning emperor dared not\r\nrefuse. This statue may be called an example of a grand _genre_ style.\r\nIt represents a scene from common life in Greece, but it is so simply\r\nnatural, so graceful and free from restraint, that one could not weary\r\nof it. The expression of the face is that of quiet content--his task has\r\nbeen faithfully done, and the remembrance of it is pleasant. The hair is\r\nfinely executed; this was a point in which Lysippus excelled; but the\r\ngreat charm of the whole is in the pose of the figure. In his occupation\r\nof scraping one portion of the body after another he must constantly\r\nchange his position, and this one, in which he can rest but a moment,\r\nseems to have the motion in it which he must almost instantly make,\r\nwhile it is full of easy grace in itself. The art of Lysippus was not as\r\nelevated as that of Phidias, who tried to represent the highest ideal\r\nwhich a mortal may form of a god; but there was nothing mean or vulgar\r\nin the works of the former; on the contrary, it was with a pure and\r\nnoble spirit that he endeavored to represent the perfections of\r\nyouthful, manly beauty, and his naturalism was of a healthy and\r\ndignified sort.\r\n\r\nThe most important pupil of Lysippus was CHARES OF LINDOS, who was\r\nprominent not only on account of his own works, but also because he\r\nintroduced the art of Sicyon into his native island of Rhodes. This\r\nisland is but forty-five miles long and twenty miles wide at its\r\nbroadest part, and yet its art became second only to that of Athens.\r\n\r\nAt the city of Rhodes alone there were three thousand statues, besides\r\nmany paintings and other rare and beautiful objects. Chares is best\r\nknown for the sun-god which he erected here; it was called the \"Colossus\r\nof Rhodes,\" and was reckoned as one of the seven wonders of the world.\r\nOne hundred statues of the sun were erected at Rhodes, and Pliny says\r\nthat any one of them was beautiful enough to have been famous; but that\r\nof Chares was so remarkable that it overshadowed all the rest.\r\n\r\nIt stood quite near the entrance to the harbor of Rhodes, but we have no\r\nreason to believe that its legs spanned the mouth of the port so that\r\nships sailed between them, as has often been said, although its size was\r\nalmost beyond our imagination. The statue was one hundred and five feet\r\nhigh, and few men could reach around one of its thumbs with their arms,\r\nwhile each finger was as large as most statues. Twelve years were\r\noccupied in its erection, from B.C. 292 to 280, and it cost three\r\nhundred talents, or about $300,000 of our money, according to its usual\r\nestimate, though there are those who name its cost as more than four\r\ntimes that amount. The men of Rhodes obtained this great sum by selling\r\nthe engines of war which Demetrius Poliorcetes left behind him when he\r\nabandoned the siege of Rhodes in B.C. 303. We have no copy of this\r\nstatue, but there are coins of Rhodes which bear a face that is believed\r\nwith good reason to be that of the Colossus.\r\n\r\nFifty-six years after its completion, in B.C. 224, the Colossus was\r\noverthrown by an earthquake, and an oracle forbade the restoration of it\r\nby the Rhodians. In A.D. 672, nearly a thousand years after its fall,\r\nits fragments were sold to a Jew of Emesa by the command of the Caliph\r\nOthman IV. It is said that they weighed seven hundred thousand pounds,\r\nand nine hundred camels were required to bear them away. When we\r\nconsider what care must have been needful to cast this huge figure in\r\nbronze, and so adjust the separate parts that the whole would satisfy\r\nthe standard of art at Rhodes, we are not surprised that it should have\r\nbeen reckoned among the seven wonders, and that Chares should have\r\nbecome a famous master.\r\n\r\nChares also founded a school of art which became very important, and,\r\nindeed, it seems to have been the continuance of the school of the\r\nPeloponnesus; for after the time of Lysippus the sculpture of Argos and\r\nSicyon came to an end, and we may add that with Lysippus and his school\r\nthe growth of art in Greece ceased; it had reached the highest point to\r\nwhich it ever attained, and all its later works were of its decline, and\r\nforeshadowed its death.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Alexander the Great was so brilliant that it is difficult\r\nto realize that it was a time of decline to the Greeks; and during the\r\nlife of Alexander perhaps this does not appear with clearness; but at\r\nthe close of his reign there arose such contentions and troubles among\r\nhis generals that everything in Greece suffered, and with the rest Greek\r\nart was degraded. In the time of Pericles it was thought to be a crime\r\nin him that he permitted his portrait to be put upon the shield of the\r\nParthenon, and he was prosecuted for thus exalting himself to a\r\nprivilege which belonged to the gods alone. Alexander, on the contrary,\r\nclaimed to be a god, and was represented by painters and sculptors until\r\nhis portraits and statues were almost numberless.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Alexander the humiliation of Athens and its old\r\nPericlean spirit was complete. If you read the history of Demetrius\r\nPoliorcetes, who was even allowed to hold his revels in the most sacred\r\npart of the Parthenon--the temple of Minerva--you will see that Athens\r\nwas enslaved and her people no longer worthy to lead the world in the\r\narts of peace, as they were no longer the brave men who could stand\r\nfirst in war. In their degraded state the Athenians suffered three\r\nhundred and sixty statues to be erected to Demetrius Phalereus, and\r\nthese were destroyed to make way for the golden images of the conquering\r\nfreebooter Poliorcetes. This last was hailed by the debased people as a\r\ngod and a saviour. His name and that of his father, Antigonus, were\r\nwoven into the sacred peplos.\r\n\r\nAt length, under the Diadochi, or successors of Alexander, order was\r\nrestored, and Antigonus, Ptolemy, Seleucus, and Lysimachus divided the\r\nkingdom of Alexander into four Græco-Oriental monarchies. The dynasty of\r\nthe Ptolemies in Egypt was the most reputable of these, and gave much\r\nencouragement to art and letters. But the sacred fire seems to have died\r\nout, or did not burn clearly when transplanted from Athens to\r\nAlexandria. The Alexandrines seem to have been mere imitators of what\r\nhad gone before, and there is nothing to be said of them that is of\r\nimportance enough for us to linger over it. Very few works remain from\r\nthis Diadochean period. The Metope of Ilium, which Dr. Schliemann has in\r\nhis garden in Athens, the Barberini Faun, in the Glyptothek at Munich,\r\nand the Nile of the Vatican are the most important remnants of\r\nAlexandrine sculpture.\r\n\r\nAmid all the confusion and strife which followed the death of Alexander\r\nthe island of Rhodes remained undisturbed, and when the division of the\r\nmonarchies was made the Rhodians still retained their independence. They\r\nwere neutral, and so had a commerce with all the monarchies, and thus\r\ngained great wealth; and theirs was the only independent State of the\r\nold Hellenic world which was able to found and maintain a school of\r\nart. Among the great works of the Rhodian artists none is more familiar\r\nto us than the group of the Laocoon.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Pliny this work stood in the palace of Titus, and the\r\nhistorian called it \"preferable to all other works of pictorial or\r\nplastic art.\" There is a difference of opinion as to the period when it\r\nwas made, and many date it in the time of Titus, who lived A.D. 40 to\r\n81. But the weight of argument seems to me to rest with those who\r\nbelieve that it was made at Rhodes in the time of the Diadochi.\r\n\r\nThe group in the Vatican is probably a copy, because Pliny says that the\r\noriginal was made of one block, and that of the Vatican is composed of\r\nsix pieces. Pliny also tells us that the Laocoon was the work of three\r\nsculptors, AGESANDER, POLYDORUS, and ATHENODORUS. The Vatican group was\r\nfound in 1506 in the excavation of the Baths of Titus, in Rome, and was\r\nplaced in its present position by Pope Julius II. (Fig. 51). The right\r\narm of Laocoon was missing, and Michael Angelo attempted to restore it,\r\nbut left it incomplete; Montorsoli made an unsatisfactory attempt for\r\nits restoration, and the arm as it now is was made by Cornacini, and\r\nmore straight than it should be.\r\n\r\nThe story which these statues illustrate is told in the second book of\r\nthe Æneid, and says that Laocoon was a priest of Apollo at Troy, who,\r\nwhen the Greeks left the wooden horse outside the city and pretended to\r\nsail away, warned the Trojans against taking the horse inside the walls;\r\nhe also struck his spear into the side of the monster. But Sinon, who\r\nhad been left behind by the Greeks, persuaded the Trojans that the horse\r\nwould prove a blessing to them, and they drew it into the city, and\r\nordered feasts and sacrifices to be celebrated to do honor to the\r\noccasion. Laocoon had much offended Pallas Athene by his words and acts,\r\nand when he went to prepare a sacrifice to Neptune that goddess sent two\r\nhuge serpents up out of the sea to destroy him and his two sons, who\r\nwere with him by the altar. When the three victims were dead the fearful\r\ncreatures went to the Acropolis and disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--THE LAOCOON GROUP.]\r\n\r\nIn the Laocoon group it appears that the eldest son will save himself,\r\nand in certain minor points the sculptors seem not to have followed the\r\naccount of Virgil; but we see that it must be the same story that is\r\nillustrated, and we know that it was told with some variation by other\r\npoets. This group is a wonderful piece of sculpture, but it is not of\r\nthe highest art, and it is far from pleasant to look at. The same is\r\ntrue of another famous group which is in Naples, and which is also from\r\nthe Rhodian school.\r\n\r\nI mean the Farnesian Bull, or the Toro Farnese. This group was made by\r\nAPOLLONIUS and TAURISCUS, who are believed to have been brothers. It was\r\nprobably made at Tralles, in Caria, which was their native place, and\r\nsent by them to Rhodes, the great art-centre; from Rhodes it was sent to\r\nRome, where it was in the possession of Asinius Pollio. This splendid\r\ngroup, which is probably the original work, was found in the Baths of\r\nCaracalla, in 1546, and was first placed in the Farnese Palace, from\r\nwhich it was removed to the National Museum in Naples, in 1786 (Fig.\r\n52).\r\n\r\nThis group tells a part of the story of Dirce, who had incurred the\r\nhatred and displeasure of Antiope, the mother of Amphion, who was King\r\nof Thebes and the husband of Niobe. In order to appease the wrath of his\r\nmother, Amphion, with the aid of his twin-brother Zethus, bound Dirce to\r\nthe horns of a wild bull to be dashed to pieces. All this takes place on\r\nMount Cithæron, and it is said that after Dirce had suffered horrible\r\nagonies the god Dionysus changed her into a fountain, which always\r\nremains upon this mountain.\r\n\r\nIn this piece of sculpture, dreadful as the idea is, there is less of\r\nhorror than in the Laocoon, for the reason that the moment chosen is\r\nthat just before the climax of the catastrophe, while in the Laocoon it\r\nis in its midst. The latter group is made to be seen from but one side,\r\nand was probably intended for a niche; but the Farnese Bull is perfect,\r\nand presents a finished aspect on all sides and from every point of\r\nview. There are numerous accessories and much attention to detail, while\r\nthe rocky base represents Mount Cithæron and the wildness of the scene\r\nin a manner not before known in sculpture. The group has been much\r\nrestored, but its excellences support the theory of its being the\r\noriginal work of the Greek artists, and the skill with which the various\r\nfigures are brought into one stupendous moment is such as commands great\r\npraise and admiration; it is doubtful if any other work of sculpture\r\ntells its story with power equal to that of this celebrated group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--THE FARNESE BULL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--GALLIC WARRIOR. _Venice._]\r\n\r\nAfter the art of Rhodes that of Pergamon was important. When Attalus I.,\r\nKing of Pergamon, gained his victory over the Gauls, in B.C. 229, the\r\nGreek artists were aroused to new efforts to record in sculpture the\r\ngreat deeds of Attalus and to place him on a level with the glorious\r\nheroes of their nation who had preceded him. It is recorded that the\r\nconqueror himself offered four groups of statues at Athens, and that\r\nthey stood on the southern wall of the Acropolis. The subjects were:\r\n\"The Battle of the Gods and Giants,\" \"The Battle of Athenians and\r\nAmazons,\" \"The Battle of Marathon,\" and \"The Destruction of the Gauls in\r\nMysia by Attalus.\" Thus the different epochs of Greek history were\r\nrepresented, and Attalus placed himself near the other great warriors\r\nwho had preserved the honor and freedom of their nation. These groups\r\nconsisted of many figures, and are estimated to have been from sixty to\r\neighty in number. It is believed that at least ten of them are now in\r\nEuropean collections--that is, three in Venice, four in Naples, one in\r\nParis, one in the Vatican, and the last in the Castellani collection in\r\nRome. This picture of one of those in Venice seems to represent a\r\nwarrior who has been suddenly thrown down; his weapons and shield--which\r\nlast was probably held in the left hand--have been dropped in the\r\nviolence of the shock which has prostrated him (Fig. 53). His face and\r\nhair are of the barbarian type, and the power and elasticity of his\r\npowerful frame are manifest even in this moment of his defeat. He is\r\nyet unwounded, but the weapon of his adversary may be before his eyes,\r\nand in another moment he may sink back in the agony of death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--THE DYING GAUL.]\r\n\r\nIt is now believed that the statue of the Dying Gaul, often called the\r\nDying Gladiator, was the work of a sculptor of Pergamon, and represents\r\na Gaul who has killed himself rather than submit as a slave to his\r\nconquerors. The moment had come when he could not escape, and he chose\r\ndeath rather than humiliation. We learn from history that when these\r\nbarbarians saw that all was lost they frequently slew their wives and\r\nchildren and then themselves, to avoid being taken as prisoners, which\r\nreally meant being made slaves. This warrior has thrown himself upon his\r\nshield; his battle-horn is broken, and the sword which has given him the\r\nfreedom of death has fallen from his hand. His eye is already dim, his\r\nright arm can scarce sustain him, his brow is contracted with pain, and\r\nit seems as if a sigh escaped his lips. He has not the noble form of the\r\nGreeks; we do not feel the exalted spirit which is shown in the death\r\nscenes of some of the Periclean statue heroes; here it is only a rude,\r\nbarbarous Gaul, suffering death as a brute might; it is very realistic,\r\nand when we are near the marble itself we see the coarseness of the\r\nskin, the hardened soles of the feet, the coarse hand, and we are sure\r\nthe artist must have made a true representation of this wild, savage\r\nman, who yet had the nobility of nature which would not live to be\r\nenslaved (Fig. 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--BOY AND GOOSE.]\r\n\r\nThese illustrations and remarks will give you some idea of the art of\r\nPergamon, and I shall now leave the subject of Greek sculpture after\r\nsome account of BOETHUS OF CHALCEDON. His date is very uncertain, though\r\nwe have accounts of his works by ancient writers. Some scholars believe\r\nthat he lived about B.C. 275. Many works in chased silver made by\r\nBoethus were in the temple of Athena in Lindus in the time of the\r\nhistorian Pliny; there are accounts of a figure of a boy made in gold\r\nand one of the youthful Asclepius; but the Boy Strangling a Goose, in\r\nthe gallery of the Louvre, is his most interesting work for us (Fig.\r\n55). You will remember that even the ancient Egyptians made caricatures\r\nand playful, mocking pictures not unlike some of our own day. This boy\r\nand goose are of the same spirit, and is intended as a parody on the\r\nrepresentations of Hercules struggling with the Nemean lion, which had\r\nbeen represented many times by Greek artists. The boy seems to be\r\nworking as hard as any giant could do. The execution of this work is\r\nfine. It was probably made for a fountain, the water coming through the\r\nbeak of the goose. There are several works of ancient sculpture which\r\nare of the same spirit, and for this reason are attributed to Boethus.\r\nThe Spinario, or Thorn-extractor, in the museum of the Capitol, at Rome,\r\nis one of the most charming pieces of _genre_ statuary in existence\r\n(Fig. 56).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--SPINARIO.]\r\n\r\nIt represents a boy taking a thorn from his foot. His attitude is\r\nnatural and graceful, and the purity and simplicity of its style places\r\nit on an equality with works of the best period of sculpture. The\r\nexpression of the face is that of perfect absorption in what he is\r\ndoing, and is given with great skill and truthfulness. The treatment of\r\nthe hair is like that of the archaic period, and there will always be\r\nsome critics who cannot think that such perfection could exist in the\r\nsculpture of what we call the Alexandrian age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nANCIENT ITALIAN SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient Italian sculpture was essentially Greek in its spirit, and\r\noriginated with the Etruscans, a very ancient people in Italy. There are\r\ntraces of an Oriental influence in the art of Etruria--a suggestion of\r\nthe sculpture of Egypt and Assyria, just as there is in Greek archaic\r\nart; but the real feeling and spirit of it is Greek, and must have been\r\nborrowed from Greece in some way.\r\n\r\nThe different theories and opinions about the Etruscans and their origin\r\ndo not concern us here; we have to do only with their sculpture as it is\r\nseen in the remnants of it now in existence. In the beginning the\r\nEtruscans made their statues of clay; marble was very rarely used. Later\r\non they learned the art of working in bronze, and carried it to great\r\nperfection. Their bronze works were so numerous that in B.C. 295 Fulvius\r\nFlaccus is said to have carried away two thousand statues from Volsinii\r\nalone. Some of their figures were colossal, but the greater number were\r\nstatuettes.\r\n\r\nThere are some Etruscan bronzes remaining in the museums of Europe. The\r\nEtruscans always were copyists rather than original artists; but they\r\ncopied such excellent things, and did it so well, that their productions\r\nare by no means to be despised, and the skill which they acquired caused\r\ntheir bronze and metal work to be highly valued, even in Athens itself.\r\n\r\nThe Etruscans were physically a more luxurious people than the Greeks,\r\nas may be seen in the pictures of them which still remain in the tombs\r\nof Corneto and other places. They gave much attention to luxury of\r\nliving, and the richly decorated goblets and other articles of table\r\nfurniture which they made may be seen in the Vatican and British Museum,\r\nwhile the delicate and artistic gold work of their personal ornaments is\r\nstill much admired and copied diligently.\r\n\r\nThe Romans as a people were patrons of art rather than artists. They\r\nseem from very early days to have admired the plastic art of other\r\nnations; but of Romans themselves there were very few sculptors; their\r\nartists were architects of grand structures rather than workers in the\r\nlesser monuments of artistic skill and genius. At first, as we have\r\nsaid, they relied upon the Etruscans, who built their earliest temples\r\nand adorned them with sculptures, and the first record which we have of\r\nGreek artists working in Rome gives us the names of Damophilus and\r\nGorgasus, who decorated the temple of Ceres with paintings and\r\nsculptures. This temple was consecrated in B.C. 493; if its adornment\r\nwas of the same date, the knowledge of Greek art was brought to Rome at\r\na very early period--at least fifty-six years before the completion of\r\nthe Parthenon.\r\n\r\nBut the means by which the whole Roman people were made familiar with\r\nthe beauties of Greek art are to be found in another direction. It was\r\nnot the building of their own temples, or any work done by Greek artists\r\nin Rome, that gave the Romans their love and appreciation for art; it\r\nwas rather the art spoils seized by their victorious leaders and brought\r\nhome to adorn and beautify every portion of the Eternal City. In B.C.\r\n212 Marcellus carried to Rome the spoils he had taken at Syracuse; he\r\nexhibited them in his triumphal procession, and afterward consecrated\r\nthem in the temple of Honor and Valor which he built. From this time it\r\nwas the fashion to bring home all the choice things that Roman\r\nconquerors could seize, and the number of beautiful objects thus gained\r\nfor Rome was marvellous.\r\n\r\nWhen Flaminius defeated Philip of Macedon it required two days to gather\r\nup the spoils. After Fulvius Nobilior conquered the Ætolians he brought\r\nGreek artists to Rome to arrange his festivities, and he exhibited five\r\nhundred and fifteen bronze and marble statues which he had taken from\r\nthe defeated people. When Perseus of Macedon was overcome by Æmilius\r\nPaulus it required two hundred and fifty wagons to remove the pictures\r\nand statues alone which he displayed in his triumphal procession; among\r\nthese treasures there was a statue of Athena by Phidias himself. This\r\nwork of spoiling the Grecian cities which came into their power was\r\ndiligently carried on by Mummius, Sulla, and others, until at length the\r\nEmperor Augustus removed many of the archaic sculptures to Rome. But the\r\nworks which best pleased the Romans were those of the later school of\r\nAthens. The ruling gods at Rome were Mars, Bacchus, and Venus, and the\r\nstatues of these deities were much valued.\r\n\r\nSo far, to the time of Augustus, the statues and other objects removed\r\nhad been the spoils of war; but Caligula and Nero did not hesitate to go\r\nin times of peace and act the part of robbers. The first sent a consul\r\nin A.D. 31 with orders to bring the best works of art from Greece to\r\nRome to adorn his villas; Nero went so far as to send his agents to\r\nbring even the images of the deities from the most sacred temples,\r\ntogether with the offerings made to them, for the decoration of his\r\nGolden House; it is said that from Delphi alone he received five hundred\r\nstatues of bronze.\r\n\r\nAt first the larger number of these art spoils were so placed as to be\r\nconstantly seen by the whole Roman people, and there is no doubt that\r\ntheir influence was very great and went far to refine their ideas and\r\nto prepare the way for the polish and grace of the Augustan age. Very\r\nsoon the individual desire for works of art was felt, and wealthy men\r\nbegan to decorate their homes with pictures and statues; and at last\r\nthese things were thought to be necessary to the proper enjoyment of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFrom all these causes there came about a revival of Greek art under the\r\nRomans, and in it many beautiful works were produced. Indeed, the\r\ngreater portion of the sculptures which are now the pride of the\r\ncollections all over Europe belong to this period. It cannot be said\r\nthat the artists of this date originated much, but they followed the\r\ngreatest masters that ever lived; and if they repeated their subjects\r\nthey so changed them to suit the spirit of their time that they gave\r\ntheir works a certain effect of being something new, and threw their own\r\nindividuality about them.\r\n\r\nThe list of names which can be given as belonging to Greek sculptors who\r\nworked at Rome is long, and would have little interest here. Instead of\r\nspeaking of the artists I shall speak of the most famous works of the\r\ntime which remain; most of these are so placed that they are seen by\r\ntravellers, and have become familiar to all the world.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful statue which is known as the Venus de' Medici is so called\r\nbecause after its discovery it rested for a time in the Medici Palace in\r\nRome. It was found in the seventeenth century in the Portico of Octavia\r\nat Rome, and was broken into eleven fragments. The arms from the elbows\r\ndown are restored; when it was found it had traces of gilding on the\r\nhair; the ears are pierced, as if gold rings had sometimes been placed\r\nin them. In 1680 Duke Cosmo III. removed it to Florence, where it is the\r\nchief glory of the famous Tribune of the Uffizi Gallery. Many persons\r\nbelieve this to have been a copy of the renowned Cnidian Venus by\r\nPraxiteles, of which I have told you. This Venus de' Medici was the\r\nwork of an Athenian artist named Cleomenes. He was the son of\r\nApollodorus, a sculptor who lived in Rome in the first or second century\r\nof the Christian era. (Fig. 57.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--VENUS DE' MEDICI.]\r\n\r\nThe aim of the sculptor was not to make a goddess, and his work lacks\r\nthe dignity which was thrown around the more ancient statues of Venus.\r\nCleomenes endeavored to produce a lovely woman in the youth of her\r\nbeauty. Some critics believe that this Venus is intended to represent\r\nthe moment when that goddess stood before Paris for judgment. If this\r\nstory is not well known I will tell how when Peleus and Thetis were\r\nmarried they invited all the gods to their wedding save the goddess\r\nDiscordia, and she was so offended by this slight that she threw into\r\nthe midst of the assembly a golden apple on which were the words, \"To\r\nthe fairest.\" Juno, Minerva, and Venus all claimed it, and Jupiter sent\r\nMercury to conduct these three beautiful goddesses to Paris, that he\r\nmight decide to which it belonged. His decision gave the apple to Venus;\r\nand this so excited the jealousy and hatred of the others that a long\r\nlist of serious troubles arose until Paris was driven out of Greece,\r\nand, going to the house of Menelaus, he saw and loved Helen, carried her\r\noff to Troy, and thus brought on the Trojan war of which the world has\r\nheard so much ever since. If I were writing a Sunday-school book I could\r\ndraw many lessons from this story; but as I am only writing about art, I\r\nwill go back and remind you that many persons try to study these old\r\nstatues and to find out exactly what they mean; some such students say\r\nthat the moment when Paris pronounced Venus to be the most lovely of the\r\ngoddesses is the time represented by the sculptor of the Venus de'\r\nMedici.\r\n\r\nAs Venus was the goddess of Love and Beauty, it was natural that statues\r\nof her should be multiplied. The Chigi Venus in the Vatican has much the\r\nsame pose as the Venus de' Medici, but she holds the end of a fringed\r\ngarment in her hand. The Venus of the Capitol, in Rome, is larger than\r\nthese; the Venus Callipiga, which was found in the Golden House of Nero,\r\nand is now in the Museum of Naples, is also worthy of being mentioned in\r\ncompany with these other exquisite sculptures.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is yet another Venus more admirable and more praised than\r\nthese. She is called the Venus of Milo, or Melos, and is in the gallery\r\nof the Louvre, at Paris. This statue is probably of a later date than\r\nthose of which we have spoken, and is thought to be the work of\r\nAlexandros, the son of Menides of Antiocheia, or one of those sculptors\r\nwho are called Asiatic Greeks. It is said that the base of this statue\r\nwith the name of the artist upon it was destroyed, for the purpose of\r\nleading the King of France to believe it to be more ancient than it\r\nreally is (Fig. 58, _frontispiece_).\r\n\r\nThis magnificent statue was discovered in 1820 by a peasant of the town\r\nof Melos, or Milo, on the island of the same name. It was in a niche of\r\na wall which had long been buried. The Marquis of Rivière, who was the\r\nFrench Ambassador at Constantinople, purchased it and presented it to\r\nKing Louis XVIII., who placed it in the Louvre. It is made from two\r\nblocks of marble joined above the drapery which envelops the legs. As\r\nthe statue now stands it has the tip of the nose and the foot which\r\nprojects beyond the drapery as they have been restored by modern\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nThis is the only Venus which has come down to us from the past which\r\nrepresents a goddess rather than a beautiful woman. The form has beauty\r\nof the highest type, but it has a grandeur which exalts it far above\r\nmere beauty. The pure, majestic expression of the head and face speak\r\nthe calm dignity of a superior being. I shall quote from Perry, who\r\nsays: \"The Venus de Milo is justly admired, not only for the grandeur of\r\nits design, the perfection of its proportion, and the exquisite moulding\r\nof the superb and luxuriant form, but for the vivid freshness of the\r\nflesh and the velvet softness of the skin, in which it stands unrivalled\r\nin ancient and modern art. The extraordinary skill with which minute\r\ndetails, such as the folds of the skin in the neck, are harmonized with\r\nthe ideal beauty of the whole is beyond all imitation and all praise.\r\nThe life-like effect of this wonderful masterpiece is greatly enhanced\r\nby the rare and perfect preservation of the epidermis and by the\r\nbeautiful warm, yellowish tinge which the lapse of centuries has given\r\nto the marble.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Museum at Naples is the Farnesian Hercules, which was found in\r\nthe Baths of Caracalla, in Rome, in 1540. It was first placed in the\r\nFarnese Palace, and from that circumstance received the name by which it\r\nis known. It is the work of Glycon, an Athenian, and his name is\r\ninscribed upon it. There is little doubt that this is a copy of a more\r\nancient statue by the great Lysippus; that master created\r\nrepresentations of Hercules in all ages and forms. Glycon probably\r\nworked in the time of Hadrian; and though he copied the design and form\r\nof Lysippus, he exaggerated some points so as to injure the effect of\r\nthe whole. For example, the head is small in proportion to the breadth\r\nof the breast and shoulders; and because Hercules was a swift runner the\r\nsculptor has made the legs too long to be natural. It is in such\r\nparticulars as these that the decline of art may be traced, even in\r\nworks that command admiration (Fig. 59).\r\n\r\nThe moment in which the god is represented is that which immediately\r\nfollowed his securing the apples of the Hesperides, the wedding present\r\nof Ge to Juno. Of all the labors of Hercules, perhaps this was the most\r\narduous. Juno had left these apples with the Hesperides for safekeeping.\r\nThese goddesses lived on Mount Atlas, and the serpent Ladon helped them\r\nto guard their precious trust. Hercules did not know just where the\r\napples were kept, and this made his task all the more difficult. When,\r\ntherefore, he arrived at Mount Atlas he offered to hold up the world for\r\nAtlas if he would go and fetch the apples. This Atlas did, but refused\r\nto take the weight from Hercules again. However, Hercules took the\r\napples and hastened to his master, Eurystheus, with them. While\r\nperforming this labor he had a terrible struggle with Ladon, and some\r\naccounts say that he killed the monster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--THE FARNESIAN HERCULES.]\r\n\r\nNow, the statue represents the god with the apples in his right hand,\r\nthe world held on his back, while he leans heavily on his club covered\r\nwith a lion's skin. All the muscles of his body are swollen from his\r\nstruggle; his head droops, his whole expression of face and form is that\r\nof sadness and weariness. The youthfulness and strength with which the\r\nolder sculptors invested him is not here. It is a splendid work, but it\r\nis not of the best; it belongs to an age when there was too much\r\nstraining after effect, when the moderation of the best Greek masters\r\ndid not satisfy the spirit of the time; and no sculptor lived whose\r\npower equalled that of Phidias or Lysippus.\r\n\r\nThere are some reliefs and vases of this Roman period that are very\r\ninteresting. I shall speak of but one relief--the Sacrifice of\r\nIphigenia, which is in Florence. It is called the work of Cleomenes, and\r\nhis name is inscribed upon it; but there is some doubt as to the\r\ngenuineness of the inscription. This relief is very beautiful. It\r\nrepresents a priest cutting off the hair of the lovely maiden as a\r\npreparation for her sacrifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--THE APOLLO BELVEDERE.]\r\n\r\nThe story runs that Iphigenia was the daughter of Agamemnon, who killed\r\na hart sacred to Diana. To revenge this act the goddess becalmed the\r\nGreek fleet on its way to Aulis. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to\r\nsacrifice his daughter to appease Diana; this he consented to do, but\r\nDiana put a hart in the place of the maiden, whom she bore to Tauris and\r\nmade a priestess. In this relief the maiden has an air of resigned\r\ngrief; her father stands by himself with his head covered. The sculptor\r\nof this relief was not the first who had represented Agamemnon thus, for\r\na painter, Timanthes, had made a picture of this subject about B.C. 400,\r\nand in describing it Quintilian said that \"when he had painted Calchas\r\nsad, Ulysses sadder, and had represented in the face of Menelaus the\r\nmost poignant grief that art can express, having exhausted the deepest\r\nfeelings and finding no means of worthily portraying the countenance of\r\n_the father_, he covered his head and left it to every man's own heart\r\nto estimate his sufferings.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--VENUS DE' MEDICI.]\r\n\r\nI come now to the Apollo Belvedere, one of the most celebrated of all\r\nthe statues in the Vatican, and the best known and most universally\r\nadmired of all the ancient statues which remain to us. It was found at\r\nabout the end of the fifteenth century at the ancient city of Antium,\r\nwhere it probably made one of the ornaments of the Imperial Palace. The\r\nauthorities upon such subjects have never yet agreed as to whether the\r\nmarble from which it is cut is a marble of Greece or of Italy (Fig. 60).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--THE STEINHÄUSER HEAD.]\r\n\r\nThis statue has been lauded in all tongues of the civilized world, and\r\nnothing could be added to what has been said in its praise; and yet all\r\nwho see it wish to exalt it still higher if possible. A few years ago\r\nanother head of Apollo, of Greek marble, was found in a magazine in\r\nRome, by Herr Steinhäuser, by whose name it is known; it is now in the\r\nmuseum at Basle (Figs. 61, 62).\r\n\r\nThough this statue has been so much studied and admired it has never yet\r\nbeen satisfactorily explained, and there are several important questions\r\nabout it which cannot be answered with certainty. Nothing is known of\r\nits age or of the name of its sculptor. It is not described by any\r\nancient writer, neither can any one say whether it is an original or a\r\ncopy; and above all in importance is the question of what this beautiful\r\nyoung god is doing--what is the meaning of it?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--THE STROGANOFF APOLLO.]\r\n\r\nThe answers of the authorities to these queries vary so much that here I\r\nshall only mention the theory which I love, and which is accepted by\r\nmany. When the statue was found the left hand was missing, and a bow was\r\nbelieved to have been the article which it held; and it was said that\r\nApollo had just shot an arrow on some dreadful flight, and was watching\r\nfor its effect. This theory was the principal one until 1860, when a\r\nscholar, Stephani, called attention to the fact that in St. Petersburg\r\nthere is a bronze statuette, less than two feet high, which is almost\r\nexactly the same as the Apollo Belvedere--too nearly the same to be an\r\naccidental likeness. Now, as this is an antique bronze, it seems to\r\nprove that both it and the marble of the Vatican are copies of an\r\nancient work. The statuette is called the Stroganoff Apollo, because it\r\nbelongs to the collection of a nobleman of that name. It is believed to\r\nbe one of a number of bronzes which were found near Janina in 1792, and\r\ngiven by the son of Ali Pasha to his physician, Dr. Frank (Fig. 63).\r\n\r\nThe chief importance of this discovery was the fact that the left hand\r\nwas perfect, and did not hold a bow, but some soft, elastic substance\r\nwhich Stephani believes to be the ægis, or shield, of Jupiter, on which\r\nwas the head of Medusa. The sight of this shield paralyzed those who saw\r\nit; and though it belonged to Jupiter and Minerva, Jupiter sometimes\r\nlent it to his son Apollo to aid him in his warfare; such instances are\r\nrecorded by Homer. After Stephani had told his idea of it, the German\r\nscholar Ludwig Preller pointed out what seems to be the true meaning of\r\nit by suggesting that Apollo was extending this dreadful _ægis_ before\r\nthe sight of the Gauls at Delphi, in B.C. 279. History relates that when\r\nthe Gauls approached Delphi the people asked the oracle if they should\r\ncarry away and conceal the treasures of the temple. The oracle replied,\r\n\"I myself and the White Maidens (meaning Athena and Artemis) will take\r\ncare of that.\" Then four thousand Greeks stood by ready to defend the\r\nsacred place; but in the midst of the battle the youthful god came down\r\nthrough the roof of the temple, and the White Maidens left their own\r\naltars to aid him in driving back the barbarous foe. A great tempest\r\narose, and rocks fell from Parnassus on the heads of the Gauls, and it\r\nseemed as if all the powers of heaven and earth had united to sustain\r\nthe Greeks against their enemies. It is also written that the spectres\r\nof Greek heroes who had long been dead were seen in the midst of the\r\nbattle dealing death upon the Gauls. But above all the fury of the\r\ntempest and the noise of war the clashing of the shield and spear of\r\nAthena and the twanging sound of the oft-discharged bow of Artemis were\r\nheard, while the flash of the awful shield of Apollo was seen to be even\r\nmore vivid and terrific than the forked lightnings themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that after this victory two statues of Apollo and one\r\neach of Athena and Artemis were offered in the temple of Apollo as\r\nthank-offerings for its preservation and the victory over the Gauls. It\r\nis delightful to regard the Apollo Belvedere as a copy of one of these,\r\nand this view of it is most satisfying. Lübke, in speaking of this\r\ntheory, says: \"Not till now have we understood the Apollo Belvedere. In\r\nunveiled beauty we see the elegant form of the slender figure, the left\r\nshoulder only being covered by the chlamys, which falls down over the\r\narm, which, far outstretched, holds the ægis with its Medusa head. The\r\nright arm is slightly turned aside, but both hands have been unskilfully\r\nrestored. The attitude of the god is full of pathos, and is conceived at\r\na dramatic moment. Ardently excited and filled with divine anger, with\r\nwhich is mingled a touch of triumphant scorn, the intellectual head is\r\nturned sideward, while the figure, with elastic step, is hastening\r\nforward. The eye seems to shoot forth lightning; there is an expression\r\nof contempt in the corners of the mouth, and the distended nostrils seem\r\nto breathe forth divine anger. It is a bold attitude thus transfixed in\r\nmarble, full of life-like and excited action.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Iliad Homer describes the scene when Jupiter gave the ægis to\r\nApollo, that he might put the Achæans to flight with it. In connection\r\nwith the Apollo Belvedere it is well to recall that description which is\r\nthus translated by Lord Derby\r\n\r\n   \"While Phoebus motionless his ægis held,\r\n   Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell\r\n   On either side; but when he turned its flash\r\n   Full in the faces of the astonished Greeks,\r\n   And shouted loud, their spirits within them quailed,\r\n   Their fiery courage borne in mind no more.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to know that many who believe that the Apollo\r\nBelvedere represents that god when terrifying the Gauls, believe also\r\nthat the statues of the \"White Maidens\" rushing forth from their temples\r\nto aid him are in existence, the Artemis being the statue at the Louvre\r\nknown as \"_Diane à la Biche_\" and the Minerva being the Athena with\r\nspear and shield in the museum of the Capitol at Rome.\r\n\r\nThis statue of Artemis, or Diana, has been in France since the time of\r\nHenry IV. Formerly it was at Versailles, but is now one of the treasures\r\nof the Louvre. The left hand with the bow is restored. The effect of the\r\nfigure is that of lightness combined with strength. She is going forward\r\nrapidly, with her eyes fixed on some distant object, and draws an arrow\r\nfrom her quiver even as she flies. This figure corresponds to the Apollo\r\nBelvedere in its spirit and apparent earnestness of purpose; it is of\r\nthe same proportions, and in such details of treatment as the rich\r\nsandals it plainly belongs to the time and the school of the\r\nApollo--indeed, there is no reason why it might not have formed a part\r\nof a group in which the Apollo stood. (Fig. 64.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--DIANE À LA BICHE.]\r\n\r\nIf we think of this Diana simply as an ideal huntress hastening to the\r\nchase the statue is very beautiful, and a remarkable example of such a\r\nsubject; but when she is regarded as one of the \"White Maidens\" rushing\r\nforth to aid her brother in defending his temple against a barbarous\r\nenemy she is invested with a deeper interest; she becomes an important\r\nactor in a terrible drama, and those of us who could have no sympathy\r\nwith her love for hunting are roused to an enthusiastic hope that she\r\nwill succeed in doing her part to turn the savage foe away from the\r\nsacred hill of Pytho, and thus preserve its temple and its treasures.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Athena, advancing with spear and shield, is supposed to be\r\na third member of the group which commemorated the victory over the\r\nGauls. The position of the two goddesses would indicate that they were\r\nrepresented as hastening from opposite directions toward the Apollo\r\nBelvedere, the central figure of the whole. The whole bearing of this\r\nstatue carries out the impression which Homer gives of the delight with\r\nwhich Athena led the Greeks to battle; she is full of eagerness, and\r\nrushes forward with the undaunted vigor of the confidence and courage of\r\none who goes to fight for a just and holy cause (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--ATHENA OF THE CAPITOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether this \"Gallic theory,\" as it is called, concerning the Apollo,\r\nDiana, and Athena be correct or no, it is the most satisfactory in\r\nsentiment of any that has been advanced, and certainly, when we consider\r\nthe three statues in this connection, there is nothing inharmonious in\r\nthe supposition that they made the important parts of a whole which may\r\nhave had many other figures of lesser importance in it.\r\n\r\nThere are many other statues of the Roman period in various museums, but\r\nI shall leave this part of our subject here, and speak briefly of the\r\nhistorical sculpture in the reliefs upon the triumphal arches of the\r\nEternal City. In an age when martial glory was the chief desire of man,\r\nand among a people who accorded to successful generals the highest\r\nhonors, it was most natural that the conquerors should desire to place\r\nsome monument of their exploits where it would be constantly before the\r\neyes of the people, and thus keep in perpetual remembrance their valiant\r\ndeeds and their great successes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION FROM ARCH OF TITUS.]\r\n\r\nWe read that pictures of the foreign scenes of sieges and battles were\r\ndisplayed in public places in Rome at a very early date. We cannot find\r\nrecords of plastic works of this sort before the time of the emperors,\r\nbut after such sculptures came into favor they were multiplied rapidly.\r\nThe principal historical reliefs in Rome were upon the arches of\r\nClaudius, Titus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, and Septimius Severus, and on\r\nthe architrave of the temple of Minerva in the Forum.\r\n\r\nOf the arch of Claudius there are some remaining fragments of sculpture,\r\nnow in the Villa Borghese. The arch of Titus was erected to celebrate\r\nthe taking of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. It was restored in 1822. The frieze\r\nrepresents both a triumphal procession and one of sacrifice. The picture\r\nwe give here shows a company of warriors in the dress of peace, who bear\r\narticles of booty taken from the conquered city. They have the\r\ncandelabra with seven branches, the table of the shew-bread, the silver\r\ntrumpets, etc. This will give you a good idea of these reliefs. (Fig.\r\n66.)\r\n\r\nThe arch of Trajan no longer stands, and its reliefs are now on the arch\r\nof Constantine; but Trajan's Pillar is one of the best preserved of all\r\nthe antique monuments of Rome, and with some account of this column and\r\na picture from it we will leave the historical sculptures of Rome. The\r\nSenate and people of Rome decreed that this column should be erected to\r\nthe memory of Trajan, and it was in the centre of the Forum which bore\r\nthe same name--the Forum Trajani. The column is about one hundred and\r\nsix feet high, and originally was surmounted by a bronze statue of\r\nTrajan, which was replaced by one of St. Peter by Pope Sixtus V. A band\r\nof reliefs runs around this pillar in a spiral form; this band is six\r\nhundred feet long, and the sculptures represent Trajan's campaign\r\nagainst the Dacians. Many of the figures lose their effect on account of\r\nthe height at which they are placed. There are more than a hundred\r\nscenes upon it, in which are about twenty-five hundred human figures,\r\nbesides many horses and other objects. The whole is executed with the\r\ngreatest care.\r\n\r\nThe real object of the whole work was to glorify the Emperor Trajan, and\r\nhe is represented in many of the scenes; sometimes he is conducting\r\nengagements, storming a fort, or encouraging his troops; again he is\r\nholding an audience, protecting the women of a conquered city, or\r\nsitting in judgment on captives. Fig. 67 represents the Dacians\r\nassaulting a Roman fort. It is winter, and while some have crossed the\r\nice in safety, others have broken through. Everything about it is\r\nrepresented in the most life-like and matter-of-fact manner, and this\r\nshows distinctly the principal difference between the Greek and the\r\nRoman art when the latter was not influenced by the former. It is pure,\r\nrealistic, historical sculpture, and this pillar shows this at its very\r\nbest estate; it is a splendid specimen of this kind of art. In all these\r\nmany scenes there are but two mythological figures: one is Selene, used\r\nto represent Night, and the other is _Jupiter tonans,_ who indicates\r\nStorm. But the correctness and elegance of the sculptures show what the\r\nGreek teaching did for the Romans; for it was to the Greeks that the\r\nlatter owed their knowledge of the human form and their power to render\r\nit properly in sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--FROM THE RELIEFS OF TRAJAN'S COLUMN.]\r\n\r\nThe last sort of ancient sculpture of which I shall speak is portrait\r\nsculpture, and perhaps this belongs also to historical sculpture, for it\r\nis by means of statues and busts that we know the faces and forms of\r\nmany of the great men and women who hold their places in the regard of\r\nthe world through all the centuries, because they were concerned in the\r\nevents which make up what we call the history of the world. We have said\r\nthat in Greece in very early times there were no portrait sculptures;\r\ngradually they were introduced until, in the time of Alexander, portrait\r\nstatues were almost numberless, and these and busts were used for the\r\ndecoration of libraries and public buildings, as well as for the\r\nadornment of squares and places of resort in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe finest life-size statue which remains from the Greeks is that of\r\nSophocles, of which we give a picture (Fig. 68). It was not found until\r\nabout 1839, and was presented to Pope Gregory XVI. by Cardinal\r\nAntonelli; it is in the museum of the Lateran. This engraving from it\r\nshows its beauties so well that it is scarcely needful to speak of it in\r\ndetail. This statue is valuable not only as a portrait of Sophocles, but\r\nas a representation of a true product of the highest and best of\r\nAthenian civilization and culture; of an elegant, aristocratic man who\r\nwas trained in gymnastic and warlike exercises which developed his\r\nphysical parts, as well as in science, philosophy, and music--in various\r\ndeep studies and lighter accomplishments which rendered him profound and\r\nscholarly, and at the same time elegant and graceful. \"The attitude,\r\nthough simple, is well chosen to show the most graceful lines of the\r\nfigure; and the position of the arms--the one gracefully enveloped in\r\nthe himation, and the other firmly planted on the hip--gives to the\r\nwhole form an air of mingled ease and dignity. The face is handsome and\r\nfull of winning grace, and bears the stamp not only of the creative\r\ngenius of the poet, but of the experience of the active citizen; of one\r\nwho has felt both the joys and the sufferings of human lot, and\r\npreserved amid them the constitutional calmness, the gentle benevolence,\r\nthe tranquil, meditative piety for which he was renowned and loved by\r\nthe people among whom he lived and sang.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--PORTRAIT STATUE OF SOPHOCLES.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans portrait sculpture held a position of importance. This\r\npeople had always placed great value upon the likenesses of the dead,\r\nand from the earliest times had used different means of making them. In\r\nthe very early days of the nation the custom prevailed of making masks\r\nof the faces of the dead in wax, and these masks were worn in the\r\nfuneral procession by one of the mourners, who also wore the dress and\r\ninsignia of the departed. The first aim in these masks was to have an\r\nexact resemblance to the dead; and this idea was carried on through all\r\nthe eras of Roman art, and is a strong distinguishing feature between\r\nGreek and Roman sculpture; for while the Greeks wished to reproduce the\r\nface of one of whom they made a bust or statue, they did not hesitate to\r\nidealize that face; but the Romans labored to make an exact likeness of\r\nthe man, leaving him in his statue as nothing more than he looked to be.\r\nThis manner of portraiture often does great injustice to its model, for\r\nthe changing expressions which come with emotions and with conversation\r\noften illuminate the plainest faces with a rare beauty; therefore the\r\naim of portraiture should be to give the very most and best that can be\r\nimagined as coming to the face which is reproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--STATUE OF AUGUSTUS.]\r\n\r\nI can speak of but a few of the almost numberless Roman portrait\r\nsculptures.\r\n\r\nThis statue of Augustus was found in 1863 in a villa built by his wife,\r\nLivia, about nine miles from Rome, at Porta Prima. It is a noble work,\r\nand every minute detail of the ornamentation has a force and meaning\r\nthat can be explained. At the same time the whole work is full of\r\nstrength and dignity, which comes from the character of the man himself,\r\nand is in no sense dependent on all the emblems of his rank and power,\r\nwith which the dress is loaded (Fig. 69). This statue is in the Vatican,\r\nand there one can compare it with the exquisite bust known as the \"Young\r\nAugustus\" and with the statue of the emperor when aged, in which he is\r\nveiled as a priest. The study of these three sculptures, thus\r\nfortunately near each other, is most interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--AGRIPPINA THE ELDER.]\r\n\r\nThe Roman women who held important positions were frequently honored\r\nwith statues. Among those that remain none is more interesting than this\r\nof the elder Agrippina. She was a woman of great strength and equally\r\ngreat purity of character, and as we study this statue we can easily\r\nunderstand that she could perform the duties of a general when occasion\r\ndemanded this service, and when that necessity was past could nurse the\r\nsick and wounded with all the tenderness of a true womanly nature. It is\r\nin every way a noble work of art, combining grace, dignity, and the\r\naristocratic refinement of a high-born lady. The drapery of this and\r\nother similar statues is very beautiful, and fully satisfies all\r\nartistic demands. We have full proof that such garments were in actual\r\nuse by the women of Greece and Rome (Fig. 70).\r\n\r\nIt was not unusual for the great men and women of Rome to be represented\r\nin portrait statues with the attributes of gods and goddesses. Livia\r\nappears as Ceres, Julia as Flora, and so on; and during the best days of\r\nRoman art these statues were very beautiful. But at last they, like all\r\nother sculptures, grew less and less worthy, until they became\r\npositively absurd, and lacked any power to command our admiration.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus true of portrait sculpture is true of all Roman art. Its\r\ndecline kept step with the decline of the nation, and both fell at\r\nlength into a pitiable state of feebleness and corruption. From this we\r\nare glad to turn to the study of Christian art, which, even in its\r\nprimary struggles, when groping its way through ignorance and\r\nhelplessness, was still a living thing, and held the promise of a new\r\nlife--a _renaissance_ of that which had gradually died in Greece and\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMEDIÆVAL SCULPTURE, FROM THE FIFTH TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient or classic Italian sculpture of which we have spoken may be\r\nsaid to have extended to about the middle of the fourth century of the\r\nChristian era. The arch of Constantine was one of its latest works, and\r\nis interesting as an example of the decline of art. The sculptures upon\r\nit, which were taken from the arch of Trajan, executed two centuries\r\nearlier, are so superior to those that were added in the time of\r\nConstantine, that nothing could give one a clearer idea of the decadence\r\nof sculpture than seeing the works of two periods thus placed side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Constantine, when the Christians were no longer forced\r\nto hide their art in the catacombs, they began to have a sculpture of\r\ntheir own. The first Christians in Rome were brought into contact with\r\nthe worship of Isis and Pan, Venus and Apollo, and were filled with\r\nhorror at the sight of the statues of these divinities. They believed\r\nthat any representation of the human form was forbidden by the\r\ncommandment which says, \"Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven\r\nimage, nor the likeness of anything that is in the heaven above, or in\r\nthe earth beneath, or in the water under the earth.\" Thus it happened\r\nthat when the early Christians desired to represent the Saviour they\r\nemployed painting, such as is found in the catacombs, rather than\r\nsculpture, and separate statues are the rarest remains of early\r\nChristian art.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Christian statue which is known in marble is that of St.\r\nHippolytus, which is in the Museum of the Lateran Palace, where there\r\nare also two small statues of Christ as the Good Shepherd, which were\r\nfound in the catacombs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--STATUE OF ST. PETER.]\r\n\r\nThe most important statue of this period is that of St. Peter, which is\r\nheld in great reverence by Roman Catholics, who kiss its toe as they\r\nenter the church of St. Peter's at Rome, and press their foreheads\r\nagainst the extended foot. The statue is of bronze, and some\r\nantiquarians believe that it is the Jupiter of the Capitol changed so as\r\nto answer for a statue of St. Peter; others say that it was cast from\r\nthe metal of the statue of Jupiter; and the usual belief is that it was\r\nmade by the order of Pope Leo I. about the middle of the fifth century\r\nas a thank-offering for the deliverance of Rome from the barbarian\r\nAttila by the miraculous protection of St. Peter and St. Paul. This\r\nstatue is too rude to belong to classic art, though it is of remarkable\r\nexcellence for a work of the fifth century (Fig. 71).\r\n\r\nThe principal use of sculpture by the early Christians was for the\r\ndecoration of the sarcophagi, or burial-cases. These were cut in\r\nbas-reliefs after the manner of the ancients, the subjects being taken\r\nfrom the life of Christ; the ornaments were the Christian emblems, such\r\nas the lamb, cross, vine, palm, dove, and the monogram of Christ. As\r\ntime passed the designs were more and more elaborate; stories from the\r\nOld Testament were frequently illustrated, and numerous figures were\r\ncrowded together, with many symbols ingeniously inserted to make the\r\nmeaning of the whole more clear.\r\n\r\nThe largest number and the best of these sarcophagi are now in the\r\nmuseums of the Lateran and the Vatican. In the centre of one of the\r\nfinest of these is a shell, in which are the half figures of the two who\r\nwere buried in this sarcophagus. At the upper left hand is the Saviour\r\nbefore the tomb of Lazarus; one of the sisters of the dead man kisses\r\nthe hand of Jesus; next to this is the Denial of Peter; nearest the\r\nshell Moses reaches up to receive the Table of the Law. On the right of\r\nthe shell, in the upper row, is the Sacrifice of Isaac and the Washing\r\nof Pilate's Hands. On the lower row, beginning at the left, is Moses\r\ncausing the Water to flow from the Rock; next is the Apprehension of\r\nPeter, and next, Daniel in the Lions' Den. Besides these there are the\r\nHealing of the Blind and the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes. This will\r\nshow how elaborate the carving is on these burial-cases, and how the\r\nsubjects from the Old and New Testaments are mingled without order or\r\napparent reason. These sarcophagi have been found in various parts of\r\nItaly and in France, and are seen in many museums.\r\n\r\nIn no part of the Roman Empire was sculpture as favorably regarded by\r\nthe early Christians as at Byzantium. Several attempts to adorn the city\r\nwith statues and other works of art were made there, and many of the\r\nGreek sculptures which had been carried to Rome were again borne off to\r\ndecorate this new Capitol. The Emperor Constantine there erected a\r\ncolumn a hundred feet high, and placed his statue on it; Theodosius also\r\nerected a column and an obelisk; but Justinian excelled all these, and\r\nabout 543 A.D. set up a monument with a colossal equestrian statue of\r\nhimself in bronze upon it. The column which supported this statue was of\r\nbrick masonry covered with plates of bronze. From the accounts we have\r\nof it we conclude that this was a fine work for its time; it was called\r\nthe Augustio, and was placed on the Augusteum near the church of St.\r\nSophia; in the sixteenth century it had been overthrown and broken in\r\npieces, and the metal was then melted down. The artist who executed the\r\nAugustio was Eustathius of Rome, who was sent to Byzantium for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBut the Byzantine Christians soon grew into a fixed disapproval of\r\nstatues, and favored only the lesser works of art. Ivory-carving, which\r\nlong before had been brought from the East by the Greeks, now came into\r\nspecial favor, and the Byzantine artists devoted all their talent to\r\nmaking beautiful works of this sort. The most important of these\r\ncarvings which remains is in the cathedral of Ravenna. It is the\r\nepiscopal chair or cathedra of Maximianus, and was made between 546 and\r\n552 (Fig. 72).\r\n\r\nThis chair is composed entirely of carved plates of ivory; scenes from\r\nthe life of Joseph and other similar designs are represented, and these\r\nare surrounded by a great variety of small figures, which form a sort of\r\nframework around the principal parts; for example, animals and birds\r\namong vine-branches, and all arranged in a life-like and artistic\r\nmanner. So large a work as this chair in ivory is unusual. The greater\r\nnumber of ivory carvings are upon small objects, such as drinking-cups\r\nand other vessels, book-covers and diptychs, or tablets for writing, of\r\nwhich fine specimens remain and are seen in art collections.\r\n\r\nDiptychs were carved ivory tablets, with the inner surface waxed for\r\nwriting, and were used by the early Christians, as they had been by the\r\nancients. The illustration given here is from the diptych of the Consul\r\nAreobrudus, and belongs to the year 506 (Fig. 73). The whole design upon\r\nit represents a contest with lions and bears; the scene is where--the\r\ncircus gates being thrown open--the animals rush into the arena to be\r\nslain by the gladiators. Some diptychs are ornamented with subjects from\r\nthe life of Christ and other religious themes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--FROM THE CATHEDRA OF MAXIMIANUS.]\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the tenth century ivory-carving was much used for\r\nchurch purposes. The smaller altars were covered with it, the vessels\r\nused for the Holy Sacrament were made of it, magnificent covers for\r\nchurch books, were carved, and as much thought seems to have been given\r\nto the designs upon these small objects as had formerly been devoted to\r\nthe splendid temples of the ancients. Ivory-carving extended from\r\nByzantium into Germany and other Western countries, and along with it\r\nwent the working in rich and precious metals, which had also been\r\npractised somewhat by the earlier Christians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--DIPTYCH. _Zurich._]\r\n\r\nDuring the tenth century the metal works were very costly, and the\r\ndifferent cathedrals and churches rivalled each other in possessions of\r\nthis sort. Altar tables were covered with embossed metal plates, which\r\nwere extended down from the top of the table to the floor, forming\r\nantependiums, as they are called, in the same way that those of cloth\r\nare now used. These plates of metal were worked into designs in relief,\r\nornamented with delicate filigree work, with paintings in enamel, and\r\neven with rare antique cameos and exquisite gems. Crucifixes were also\r\nmade of metals and richly adorned, as well as all the vessels and\r\nsmaller articles used in the service and ceremonials of the\r\nchurch--incense-burners, candlesticks, tabernacles and reliquaries, or\r\ncaskets for preserving relics. In the sacristies of many old churches\r\nand in art collections these rare, costly articles are still preserved,\r\nand are of great interest in the study of art.\r\n\r\nMany of the designs used on these objects were quaint and even\r\ngrotesque, while the drawing of the figures and the arrangement of the\r\nsubjects is often done in the crudest and most inartistic manner.\r\nVessels for church use were made in the shapes of griffins, dragons,\r\ncranes, lions, and other curious birds and beasts, while the human faces\r\nrepresented sometimes had enamelled or jewelled eye balls. In one case\r\nthe eyes of the Saviour were made of large carbuncles; you can\r\nunderstand that this would give an expression quite the opposite of that\r\ngentleness and peace which we look for in the face of the Redeemer. In\r\ntruth, there is so much of the grotesque and even barbarous element in\r\nmany of these works, that we can but ridicule while we recognize the\r\nindustry and care which was expended upon them. It is also difficult to\r\nunderstand how the feeling for art and the practice of it which had\r\nattained to such perfection among the ancients could have died out of\r\nthe world so completely, for in these mediæval days it existed nowhere\r\non the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the eleventh century bronze casting came to hold\r\nan important place in the art of Germany, and as architecture now\r\nreceived more attention, and bronze gates, and occasionally bronze\r\nfigures of bishops and other church dignitaries, were used for the\r\ndecoration of church buildings, we may say that bronze works made the\r\nmedium through which sculpture in connection with architecture was again\r\nbrought into use. At Hildesheim there is still a bronze gate at the\r\nprincipal entrance to the cathedral, which was cast in 1015, and in\r\nvarious places in Germany, France, and Northern Italy works of this kind\r\nare seen which belong to the eleventh century, while a bit of stone or\r\nwood sculpture of this period is very rarely met.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth century brought about a great change in sculpture and its\r\nuses. This century was a period of remarkable activity in every\r\ndepartment of human life. The Crusades were then preached, and armies of\r\nzealous Christians went forth to redeem Jerusalem from the power of the\r\nPagans; in this century all the institutions of chivalry flourished; the\r\nnations of the world had more intercourse with each other than had\r\nbefore existed; commerce was extended into new channels; men were more\r\nindividual and thought more independently for themselves than they had\r\ndone hitherto; and, in short, human intellect all over the Western world\r\nseemed to be awakening from a long, deep sleep, and to be inspired with\r\nstrength and activity.\r\n\r\nWith all the other changes there came revivals of architecture and\r\nsculpture, which went hand in hand, and in the beginning can scarcely be\r\nseparated from each other. The early Christians had been content with\r\nthe decoration of interiors; now the exteriors received much attention,\r\nand the portals or entrances to the churches were richly decorated with\r\nstatues and other sculptured ornaments, and the exterior decoration soon\r\nextended to many portions of the edifices. In the interiors, too, the\r\naltars, fonts, choir-screens, and other objects were made of carved\r\nstone or of stucco, which hardened like stone, and were all richly\r\nornamented with sculpture. A completely new spirit seemed to possess\r\nthe artists, who thus found a satisfactory field for their labors, and\r\nthe period known as the _Romanesque_ was thus ushered in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--FROM THE FAÇADE OF CHARTRES CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot claim that the works of the twelfth century were free from the\r\nfaults of the preceding eras, or were satisfactory to our artistic\r\nsense; but we may say that they show the effect of the new life which\r\nhad come into the world, and give unerring promise of the progress which\r\nfollowed. The same improvement is seen in bronze-casting as in\r\nsculpture; and though to our eyes it still remains crude and ungraceful,\r\nyet by comparing it with the work of the previous century we mark a\r\nhopeful and important change.\r\n\r\nGermany, in its different provinces, took the lead in this artistic\r\nprogress; but France was not far behind; and, indeed, in the cathedral\r\nof Chartres the first promise was given of the splendid church portals\r\nof the early Gothic style of architecture which followed the Romanesque.\r\nIn this cathedral, too, we see for the first time an attempt to make the\r\nhead and face a reproduction of nature rather than a repetition of the\r\nclassic head, which had come to be so imperfectly copied that it had\r\ndegenerated into a caricature. (Fig. 74.)\r\n\r\nOther cathedrals at St. Denis, Le Mans, Bourges, and Paris are splendid\r\nexamples of the art of this time; and when we remember how Italy took\r\nthe lead of these northern countries in later days, it seems strange\r\nthat at this era she was far behind them. It is even true that the first\r\nworks in Northern Italy which indicated that the awakening which had\r\ncome north of the Alps had reached that country were executed wholly or\r\nin part by German artists; but by the end of the twelfth century both\r\nthe sculpture and bronze-casting of Italy gave promise of the great\r\nrevival of true art which was to come in that home of the arts.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not possible to connect the art of Italy with that of any\r\nother country in any comprehensive sense. Italian art may be said to\r\nhave died out more completely in the beginning of the middle ages than\r\ndid the art of northern nations; its period of decline, too, was longer;\r\nbut when its awakening came it aroused itself and took on new strength\r\nby a method of its own, and may be said to have been distinct from\r\nnorthern art in every respect, and divided from it by its different\r\nspirit as clearly as Italy was divided from other lands by the towering\r\nsummits of the Alps.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the thirteenth century there dawned upon the\r\nnorthern nations a new era in literature. Hitherto the written language\r\nhad been the monkish Latin; now the poets began to use their own\r\ntongues. This new writing may be said to have commenced with the\r\nProvençal poets, who were followed by those of Northern France; but it\r\nwas in Germany that such song broke forth as showed how the national\r\nfeeling had been repressed, and how, now that it had burst its bonds, it\r\nresembled the freshets of spring when they escape from the icy hand of\r\nWinter and rush from one point to another, brushing aside every obstacle\r\nwhich lies in their way. I cannot here speak in detail of these poets\r\nand their works, but Hartmann of Aue, Walther von der Vogelweid, Wolfram\r\nand Gottfried of Strasburg are names which grow brighter with passing\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with this advance in letters there came, in\r\nNorth-eastern France, the new Gothic style of architecture, which had\r\nthe effect to revive sculpture and in a degree restore to it the\r\nimportance it had in classic days. Now, the same artist was both\r\narchitect and sculptor, and the result was that architecture was so\r\narranged as to afford an honorable place to sculpture, which, in its\r\nturn, added much to the grand and full effect of architecture.\r\n\r\nArtists now began to study nature and the life about them in preference\r\nto the antique, and the sculptors of the thirteenth century were\r\nfortunate in living in a time when costumes were picturesque and suited\r\nto artistic representations. The dress of a knight was as graceful as\r\none could wish, with its flowing lines and the mantle clasped at one\r\nside of the neck, or thrown loosely over the arm and shoulder; and the\r\ncostume of the other sex, with the full folds of the lower garment\r\nfastened by the girdle, and veiling without hiding the movement of the\r\nfigure, was scarcely less fitting for the artists use than were the\r\nclassic robes of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the sculpture of this period was frequently heightened by\r\nthe use of color. The draperies were enriched by gold ornaments, and\r\npainted in rich blue and red, while the flesh parts were delicately\r\ntinted. Colors were used with care, and often served to conceal the\r\ndefects in the sculpture itself, and were thus of great advantage. Color\r\nwas most frequently used in interior decoration, but it was not unknown\r\nupon exterior portals, and porches were introduced to protect this\r\npolychromy, as the painting of sculpture was called.\r\n\r\nThe subjects now represented in sculpture were far more numerous than\r\nformerly. While the life of Christ and the Virgin still made the central\r\nand most important topic, there were added scenes from the lives of the\r\nsaints, those who were regarded as the patrons of the city or those to\r\nwhom the edifice was dedicated being most frequently chosen. New\r\nsymbolic designs were made showing the flight of time by seasons and\r\nmonths; others represented the virtues, and even the customs and habits\r\nof the people were sometimes introduced. There were also humorous\r\nrepresentations, even on sacred edifices. Water-pipes and gutter-spouts\r\nwere ended with the heads of monsters and curious animals, and even with\r\ngrotesque faces; in short, the smaller details of the architecture of\r\nthis period show the vividness of the imagination of the time. For\r\nexample, the leaf-work which was used in the ornamental portions of\r\nsculpture had hitherto copied the antique acanthus leaf; now the flowers\r\nand leaves native to France were the models of the sculptors, and a\r\ncharming variety of life-like ornament was the result.\r\n\r\nThe church of Ste. Chapelle, at Paris, completed about 1248, was the\r\nfirst edifice in which this style was seen in its full development.\r\nHere, for the first time, the statues were not placed in the stiff,\r\nperpendicular posture, but, by being inclined to different positions,\r\nhad a light appearance and an air of movement, which was a great relief\r\nfrom the rigidity which had ruled up to this time.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral at Rheims, however, shows the perfection of\r\nthirteenth-century art. It is conceded to be the best example of church\r\nbuilding of its time, and its façade the most beautiful structure of the\r\nMiddle Ages. Its wealth of sculpture is wonderful; its three great\r\nportals, the buttresses, the space above the great window and various\r\nother portions are so much ornamented that the whole effect is that of a\r\nforest of sculpture, and it is difficult to turn from it to consider the\r\narchitecture of the edifice. It naturally follows that in this vast\r\namount of artistic work there is no equality of excellence; some of the\r\nstatues are like those of an earlier date: some are too tall and\r\nawkward; others too short and rotund; but there are many elegant\r\nfigures, full of grace and dignity, with the drapery falling in natural\r\nfolds, and an air of life and freedom of movement about the heads quite\r\nunknown before this time.\r\n\r\nIn one of the side portals of this cathedral there is a figure of Christ\r\nwhich was not surpassed by any work of this period. The study of every\r\nportion of the figure is so perfect as to surprise us when we remember\r\nthat anatomy was not then studied by artists as it had been in classic\r\ntimes or as it has been in more recent days. This statue holds an orb in\r\nthe left hand, and the right hand is uplifted; not only the nails of the\r\nfingers, but the structure of all the joints is skilfully indicated.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that the reliefs are far more excellent than the\r\nstatues of mediæval date. This is so noticeable that it would seem as if\r\nthe best sculptors preferred to make the reliefs, and that the figures\r\nwere left to those of less talent. On the pediment at Rheims the Last\r\nJudgment is represented in five divisions, and these reliefs are among\r\nthe most beautiful sculptures of this century. The scene of the\r\nResurrection of the Dead is arranged in two rows of figures; a section\r\nof it is here given (Fig. 75).\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-nine of these little figures in the whole subject, and\r\nthe variety of positions and the naturalness of the various expressions\r\nare all that could be desired in any age of art. The forms are in good\r\nproportions, and the faces are filled with fear, surprise, hope, and\r\nsupplication. A volume might be written upon the sculptures of the\r\nRheims Cathedral which would be full of interest to the student of\r\nmediæval art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--FROM THE NORTH TRANSEPT OF RHEIMS CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nCritics have compared the progress and life which pervaded the art of\r\nthe thirteenth century with the spirit of the age of Phidias. The two\r\nperiods are alike in the fact that the artists of each broke away from\r\nthe traditions of those who had preceded them, and took up their work\r\nwith a desire to come nearer to nature. They were alike, too, in the\r\nunion of architecture and sculpture, and in the fact that all kinds of\r\nsculpture were required for the adornment of a single structure.\r\nColossal and full-sized statues, statuettes, reliefs, and a great\r\nvariety of simply ornamental designs were lavished upon the Christian\r\ncathedral, as they had been upon the Greek temple; and in one case as in\r\nthe other the various groups and scenes represented were intended to\r\nshow forth religious mysteries, and to illustrate the working of the\r\nsupreme power which controls the world in relation to human beings.\r\n\r\nBut I must leave this part of our subject and speak of the monumental\r\nsculpture of the thirteenth century. While many of the tomb statues\r\nstill retained a general resemblance to those of the past, there were\r\nmany examples of new strength and progress. In a church near Le Mans the\r\nstatue of Berengaria, the wife of Richard Coeur de Lion, who died in\r\n1219, was made with open eyes; this gives a very life-like appearance to\r\nthe face, and the whole head is as noble as that of an antique statue;\r\nthe drapery is full and free; the feet rest upon a dog, which is the\r\nemblem of fidelity, and in the hands is a casket. There is something\r\nabout this statue which appeals to us--a human element which had been\r\nsadly wanting in the monumental statues of the preceding centuries.\r\n\r\nBut the series of reliefs which were made for the Cathedral of St. Denis\r\nwere the most important tomb sculptures of this period. They were\r\nsixteen in number, and represented princes of the early lines of French\r\nsovereigns down to the thirteenth century. Of course those of the\r\nMerovingians and Carlovingians could not be portrait statues, and the\r\nheads of both kings and queens are all of the same type until those of\r\nPhilip the Bold, who died in 1285, and his wife, Isabella of Aragon, who\r\ndied in 1271, are reached. These two are intended to be portraits, and\r\nthey show the individual characters of these royal personages. In all\r\nFrance there is no more interesting succession of monuments than these.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the Romanesque style of architecture and the sculpture which\r\nwent with it held their sway much longer than in France, and the new\r\nGothic style made its way very slowly in the countries north of France.\r\nSlight traces of its influence in one way and another may be found about\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century; but it was not until the very end\r\nof this period that the Gothic style had affected German art, except in\r\nthe south-western portions of the country. These provinces bordered upon\r\nFrance, and formed a sort of middle ground between the two nations. In\r\nStrasburg, at the end of the century, a cathedral was built which was\r\none of the most splendid examples of a union of the two styles that\r\ncould be produced. The sculptures show the effect of the new French\r\nmanner in their life and ease of grouping and attitude, while they are\r\nstill crowded and over-decorated, as in the earlier days, and the fixed\r\narchitectural frame of the German style is preserved throughout. (Fig.\r\n76.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--FROM THE WEST FAÇADE, STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the relief of the Death of the Virgin,\r\nat Strasburg, was the work of Sabina von Steinbach, a daughter of the\r\narchitect of the west façade of the cathedral. The grouping is fine, and\r\nthe transparent drapery, which reminds us of the same effects in\r\nantique sculpture, is beautifully executed.\r\n\r\nIn the Cathedral of Freiburg, the nave of which was completed in 1270,\r\nthere are some very fine sculptures, which are like the Rheims works in\r\nspirit and execution; a figure of the Madonna is one of the best statues\r\nof the time in any country. There is much to admire in the whole of this\r\ncathedral. Here and there in Germany there are some tomb-sculptures of\r\nthe thirteenth century, which are simple, noble, and individual; but the\r\nprogress of art here was much less rapid than in France.\r\n\r\nAnother marked event in the art history of the thirteenth century was\r\nthe introduction of sculpture into England. The few pieces of plastic\r\nart which existed in that country before this date were not sufficient\r\nin number or excellence to merit the name of English sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--DUKE ROBERT OF NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nThe first important step was made about the end of the twelfth century,\r\nwhen Guillaume de Sens, a French architect, was employed to build a new\r\nchoir to Canterbury Cathedral. Not long after this the Temple Church was\r\nerected; then Westminster Abbey followed, and at length, under Henry\r\nIII., all the arts were rapidly advanced in his kingdom. This king\r\nsummoned artists and skilled workmen from different countries, and\r\nportrait-sculpture received especial attention in the England of that\r\nday. By comparing English tomb-sculpture with that of other countries,\r\nit is seen that the aim of the artists was to make the statues resemble\r\nthose whose memories they honored, far more than other nations had\r\ndone. The illustration given here, with its air of life--almost of\r\nmotion--is a good example of what I mean (Fig. 77).\r\n\r\nThe sculptures upon the English exteriors, and, indeed, upon the\r\ninteriors of edifices, were far less lavish than on the Continent; but\r\nin Wells Cathedral, completed before 1250, there is a wealth of\r\nsculpture for an English church of this date, and from this time forward\r\nthe plastic arts were of great importance in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the fourteenth century there were great changes in\r\nthe religious and political affairs of all Europe. The Pope no longer\r\nheld the supreme authority that had belonged to his office, and the\r\nimperial power was also much shaken. We cannot speak of these subjects\r\nin detail here, but the result to art of these changes was seen in a\r\ndevelopment of individualism, and the effects of it did not show an\r\nimprovement when considered as a whole, though it has some new features\r\nwhich were attractive.\r\n\r\nIn these days of which we now speak the word citizen had a far deeper\r\nmeaning than ever before, and the growth of wealth and prosperity in the\r\ncitizen classes gave a new impulse to all the activities of life, and to\r\nart along with others.\r\n\r\nThis new life and spirit gave more freedom to artists, and they\r\nattempted new effects, so that a far greater variety was made in their\r\nworks. The statue of the Madonna, for example, was so often repeated\r\nthat it afforded an opportunity for all sorts of experiments, by which\r\nthe sculptors tried to add to the deep feeling and the devotion that had\r\nalready been expressed in the representations of the sweet Mother of\r\nChrist. But just here they failed; the new era brought more realism,\r\nmore likeness to nature, more freedom to the artist to put something of\r\nhimself into his work; but much of the deep thought and the devout\r\nfeeling of the thirteenth century was lost, and it cannot be said that\r\nart was elevated in its tone.\r\n\r\nThere were influences, too, in the new state of society which permitted\r\ndetails to be introduced into religious subjects which were far from\r\nsuitable or devotional; sometimes they were even comic in their effects.\r\nFor example, such scenes as allowed the representation of evil spirits\r\nor devils were made to serve for all sorts of coarse, grotesque, and\r\nburlesque side-play, and the little figures which represented these\r\npowers were made to do all kinds of ridiculous capers side by side with\r\nsuch serious subjects as the Last Judgment or the death scenes of\r\neminent men. This makes us feel, when we study the fourteenth century,\r\nthat the sculpture of the Middle Ages reached its highest point in the\r\nthirteenth century, and soon after began to decline.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the most important sculptures of this period were executed at\r\nNuremberg. The Church of St. Laurence, that of St. Sebald, the\r\nFrauenkirche, or the Church of Our Lady, are all great monuments to the\r\nart of this city and the calm dignity and grace which marked the works\r\nof the Nuremberg sculptors.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the century, between 1385 and 1396, Master Heinrich den\r\nBalier erected the \"Beautiful Fountain,\" which is still the pride of the\r\ncity and a splendid monument of the time. In Nuremberg many of the\r\ndwelling-houses were decorated with sculptures, and it is now one of the\r\nmost interesting places in all Germany to the student of ancient art.\r\n\r\nWe have not the space to speak in detail of the sculpture of the time;\r\nAugsburg, Prague, Stuttgart, Bamberg, Würzburg, Cologne, and many other\r\nGerman towns and cities have rich treasures of its work, but its\r\ncharacter is everywhere much the same, and great activity, with a\r\ntendency toward decline, are its prominent features.\r\n\r\nIn Germany in this century ivory-carving was much practised and used\r\nfor a great variety of purposes. In these smaller works the life and\r\nfreshness, the grace and spirit of the manner of the time were very\r\nattractive (Fig. 78).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--IVORY RELIEF. HUNTING SCENE.]\r\n\r\nIn France the fourteenth century was much less productive of works of\r\nart than the preceding one had been. The fact that so much had been done\r\nin the thirteenth century--so many new churches built and so many older\r\nones remodelled--is one reason for this change. In this direction there\r\nwas very little left to be done. Then, too, the country was so disturbed\r\nby wars with England that the arts of peace suffered neglect. However,\r\nthere was still much to be done to complete the grand works already\r\nbegun, and during the early part of this century a great deal was\r\naccomplished by way of interior decoration in edifices not yet\r\ncompleted, and in the making of monuments in memory of persons of rank\r\nand importance. Those in the Cathedral of St. Denis were much increased\r\nin number, and in all parts of France these works were multiplied.\r\n\r\nDuring this century many artists from the Netherlands were employed in\r\nFrance; and in the city of Dijon, which was the residence of the dukes\r\nof Burgundy, the works of Flemish artists were very numerous.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most skilful of these masters was CLAUX SLUTER, who was the\r\nfavorite of Philip the Bold, and executed the splendid monument to that\r\nduke which is now in the Museum at Dijon. He was also the sculptor of\r\nthe Moses Fountain, the decorations of the Carthusian chapel, and other\r\nworks which still remain to show how fine a sculptor he was. Sluter had\r\na great influence upon art, and, in fact, may be said to have\r\nestablished a school the effects of which endured long after his time.\r\n\r\nIn England sculpture made no progress during the fourteenth century.\r\nLarge architectural sculptures were neither numerous nor fine.\r\nTomb-sculptures and monuments with portrait reliefs and statues were the\r\nprincipal plastic works of the time. The habit of erecting monuments to\r\nthe dead now extended to all classes, whereas it had formerly been\r\nconfined to noble and distinguished people. The result was that the\r\nmonuments of the higher classes were more and more splendid in order to\r\nmark the differences of rank, and much grand effect was thus produced;\r\nbut the merits of the sculpture was less than formerly, and the\r\nmonuments of this age are wanting in spirit, stiff and unattractive. The\r\ncostume of the time, too, was so ugly that it served to give a grotesque\r\nair to many figures, and thus added to the general appearance of decline\r\nwhich marked the English tomb-sculpture of the fourteenth century. It\r\ncompares unfavorably with the German monuments of the same period, and\r\nthe realistic portrait element which ruled it makes it seem like a\r\nmonotonous and feeble system of mechanics rather than a style of art.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the sculpture of Italy was quite different from that of\r\nthe more northern countries of Europe. One great reason for this was\r\nthat individualism in art was a strong power in Italy much earlier than\r\nin more northern countries. In Germany the early sculptors of the Middle\r\nAges did not put their names upon their works; they practised their art\r\nas a religious service, and their pious devotion made them forget\r\nthemselves. Not so in Italy: there each artist wished to be known in his\r\nworks, and regarded them as works of art, done for the sake of art, and\r\nnot as acts of piety. One result of this difference was that the\r\nnorthern sculptures had more of deep feeling and profound thought in\r\nthem, while the Italian works had more perfection of form.\r\n\r\nIn Italy sculpture held the second place in the decoration of churches.\r\nPainting was preferred before it, and in spite of the influence of the\r\nGothic style, which extended south of the Alps, the Italians would not\r\ngive up their large wall-spaces and the splendid Christian paintings\r\nwhich were their glory. They built their edifices with this end in view,\r\nand as the same person was frequently an architect, painter and\r\nsculptor, he knew how to arrange his plans so as to suit his ideas of\r\nthe merits of each art.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that the principal works which the sculptors did for the\r\nchurch were separate objects, such as altar-pieces, fonts, pulpits, and\r\ntombs. It rarely occurred that whole fronts of churches were covered\r\nwith sculptures, as in Germany or France, and there were few richly\r\nsculptured portals of churches in Italy. The material mostly used for\r\nItalian sculpture was fine white marble, which was very rarely colored;\r\nsometimes a little gilding was used; but as a rule painting and\r\nsculpture were not united, as they had been north of the Alps.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sculptors of Italy had a wider range in art than in other\r\nlands; for being less devoted to the service of the church, they were\r\nemployed for more secular works. It is true that the separate statues of\r\nthe Madonna were very numerous, and that tomb-sculpture was important;\r\nbut added to these there were civil monuments to show forth the glory of\r\nthe cities and their great men, and there were public fountains and\r\nother sculptures which told of the splendor and fame of each one of the\r\nmany petty powers into which the whole country was divided. The\r\ncouncil-halls of the free cities were very fine, and gave great\r\nopportunity to Italian artists to give variety to their works, and the\r\nsculptors very early excelled in reliefs, which told historical stones\r\nwith great clearness.\r\n\r\nAs early as the beginning of the thirteenth century we can trace the\r\nprogress of Italian sculpture by telling the story of the lives of\r\nseparate artists. The first man of importance who thus claims our\r\nattention is NICOLA PISANO, who was born at Pisa between 1205 and 1207,\r\nand who, according to the custom of his time, was both architect and\r\nsculptor. When he was but fifteen years old he received an appointment\r\nas architect to Frederic II., with whom he went to Naples; he served\r\nthis sovereign ten years, and then went to Padua, where he was employed\r\nas the architect of the Basilica of St. Anthony.\r\n\r\nIn 1237 Nicola made his first essay in sculpture, and executed a relief\r\nrepresenting the Deposition from the Cross, which still remains in its\r\nplace over one of the side doors of the Cathedral of San Martino at\r\nLucca. This work was most excellent as the attempt of a young artist,\r\nand it was also excellent when compared with the work of other Italian\r\nsculptors who had preceded him. (Fig. 79.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--RELIEF BY NICOLA PISANO. _Lucca._]\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve years following this time Nicola Pisano was chiefly\r\nemployed as an architect, and it was not until 1260 that he established\r\nhis fame as a sculptor; but when we consider the pulpit for the\r\nBaptistery of Pisa, which he now did, it is plain that he must have\r\ngiven much thought and study to sculpture since his first work at Lucca;\r\nand this last work has such qualities as indicate that he had studied\r\nthe sculpture of classic days. The work upon this pulpit is a wonderful\r\nadvance upon the sculpture of the period; and though there are marks of\r\nhis inexperience in its arrangement, as a whole it is above criticism\r\nwhen the time to which it belonged and the circumstances of its\r\nsculpture are taken into account. (Fig. 80.)\r\n\r\nNicola went next to Bologna to make a sarcophagus to contain the remains\r\nof St. Dominick, who had died there in 1221. This burial-case was\r\ncompleted in 1267, and is very interesting as an illustration of the art\r\nof the thirteenth century. The next work of this sculptor was a pulpit\r\nfor the Cathedral of Siena. When he undertook this work he agreed to\r\nlive at Siena until it was completed, with the exception of short visits\r\nto Pisa--four in each year. He had assistants in this work, and it was\r\ncompleted in about a year and a half. Meantime he exerted a great\r\ninfluence upon the sculpture of Siena, which up to this time had\r\namounted to little more than good stone-cutting. Indeed, Nicola Pisano\r\nhad an effect upon the art of all Italy: in the north at Padua, in the\r\nsouth at Naples, and in Central Italy at Pisa, Lucca, and Siena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--RELIEF FROM THE PULPIT AT PISA. _Nicola\r\nPisano._]\r\n\r\nIn 1269 he was commissioned to build a convent and an abbey at La\r\nScorgola, which are now in ruins. In 1274 Nicola commenced his last\r\nwork, the Fountain of Perugia. He did not remain constantly in that\r\ncity, but after making the plans he left his son Giovanni in charge of\r\nthe work, while he returned to Pisa and occupied himself with making the\r\nfigures for its decoration. This fountain was held in such esteem that\r\nlaws were enacted for its preservation, and it was called the most\r\nvaluable possession of the city, while some went so far as to say that\r\nit could not be surpassed in the world. Even now, after all it has\r\nsuffered from time and weather, it commands our admiration.\r\n\r\nIn 1278 Nicola died, after a life of great achievements. He left an\r\nuntarnished name, too, for he had been loved and respected by all his\r\nassociates, and as patron, friend, and servant had done all his duty.\r\nMr. Perkins, in his \"Tuscan Sculptors,\" says of him: \"Inestimable were\r\nthe services rendered to art by this great man. He gave the death-blow\r\nto Byzantinism and barbarism; established new architectural principles;\r\nfounded a new school of sculpture in Italy, and opened men's eyes to the\r\ndegraded state of art by showing them where to study and how to study;\r\nso that Cimabue, Guido da Siena, the Masuccios and the Cosmati all\r\nprofited by his pervading and enduring influence. Never hurried by an\r\nill-regulated imagination into extravagances, he was careful in\r\nselecting his objects of study and his methods of self-cultivation; an\r\nindefatigable worker, who spared neither time nor strength in obedience\r\nto the numerous calls made upon him from all parts of the peninsula; now\r\nin Pisa, then in Naples, Padua, Siena, Lucca, or Florence; here to\r\ndesign a church, there to model a bas-relief, erect a pulpit, a palace\r\nor a tower; by turns architect and sculptor, great in both, original in\r\nboth, a reviver in both, laying deep and well the foundations of his\r\nedifices by hitherto unpractised methods, and sculpturing his\r\nbas-reliefs upon principles evolved from the study of antique models\r\nlong unheeded. Ever respected and esteemed by the many persons of all\r\nclasses with whom he came in contact, he was truly a great man--one to\r\nwhom the world owes an eternal debt of gratitude, and who looms up in\r\ngigantic proportions through the mist of five centuries, holding the\r\nsame relation to Italian art which Dante holds to Italian literature.\"\r\n\r\nFRA GUGLIELMO D'AGNELLO (1238-1314?), also a Pisan, was a pupil of\r\nNicola Pisano, and worked with him at Bologna. There is little to be\r\nsaid of his works after his master's death.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI PISANO (about 1240-1320) was born at Pisa, and though a pupil\r\nof his father and a co-worker with him, he seems to have fallen under\r\nsome other and a very different influence. In architecture he preferred\r\nthe Gothic style, and in sculpture he was fond of all sorts of fantastic\r\naction and expression; his works were full of exaggeration. He was an\r\narchitect as well as sculptor, and was a master in his own right when\r\ntwenty years old, and in 1268 he went to Naples to design a church for\r\nthe Franciscans; he was also the architect of the episcopal palace\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father the Pisans were anxious to retain Giovanni\r\nin their service; he first transformed an old church into a new one in\r\nthe pointed style of architecture. It was named Santa Maria della Spina,\r\nbecause a rich merchant had presented one of the thorns from the crown\r\nof Christ to it. This was the first building in Italy of this style of\r\narchitecture. Giovanni next built the Campo Santo of Pisa. Many\r\nshiploads of earth had been brought from Palestine to Pisa in order to\r\nmake a burial-place in which Christians could be laid in the sacred\r\nearth. Giovanni Pisano inclosed the spot where this earth was laid with\r\nwalls and arranged the interior of the inclosure in such a way that it\r\ncould be extensively decorated with works of art. He made it the most\r\nbeautiful Campo Santo in Italy. Many of the sculptures are by his own\r\nhand. (Fig. 81.)\r\n\r\nThis allegorical representation of Pisa was the first attempt at making\r\nlarge statues in Italy since the days of the Emperor Constantine. The\r\ncity stands alone, and is a proud princess with a diadem, holding in her\r\narms two infants to indicate her fruitfulness. Below her are four\r\nstatues of the cardinal virtues, Temperance being a nude figure. It is a\r\nvery strange work, and in some respects not attractive, but it shows the\r\noriginality of the sculptor; the principal figure has much intensity of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--CAMPO SANTO OF PISA. _Giovanni Pisano._]\r\n\r\nFrom this monument and his other works in Pisa, Giovanni became famous,\r\nand was called to Siena to build the front of the cathedral. The people\r\nof Siena held out every inducement to him to make his home there, by\r\nfreeing him from taxes for life; but after three years he went to\r\nPerugia, where he erected a monument which has been destroyed. After\r\nthis time he devoted himself entirely to sculpture, and executed a\r\nvariety of works at Arezzo, Pistoja, Florence, Perugia, and Cortona. In\r\n1312 he commenced the rebuilding of the cathedral at Prato.\r\n\r\nWe have not the space to speak of his works in detail. The Campo Santo\r\nhas more of interest than the others, and is Romanesque in its\r\ncharacter; and yet it is true that he employed Gothic forms far more\r\nthan any other. Some authors credit Giovanni with having introduced an\r\nindependent art into Italy; but let that be as it may, he had not the\r\nfeeling for beauty, neither had he the repose which was such a charm in\r\nthe works of his father. At the same time his works are full of life and\r\ndramatic action, and could never have been designed or executed by any\r\nman who had not an uncommon genius.\r\n\r\nARNOLFO DI CAMBIO (1232-1310) was also a pupil of Nicola Pisano, and\r\nthough eight years older than Giovanni Pisano he did not become an\r\nindependent master until after Giovanni had won much fame. There are\r\nsome works in Rome which are attributed to Arnolfo, but as there are\r\nuncertainties about his being their author, it is not best for us to\r\ndiscuss them here. He erected at Orvieto, in the church of San Domenico,\r\na monument to the Cardinal de Braye. It was a very elaborate work, and\r\nthe statue of the Madonna, which is placed above that of the cardinal,\r\nis full of majestic spirit and dignified repose. This is the only\r\nwell-authenticated sculptural work by Arnolfo, but this is one of the\r\nmost finished monuments of the art of the Pisan school, and is quite\r\nsufficient to bring his name through the centuries with honor.\r\n\r\nANDREA PISANO (1270-1345) is principally famous as a bronze-caster, and\r\nhis chief work was the making of the gates to the Baptistery of\r\nFlorence, which have since been replaced by those of Ghiberti. When\r\nthese gates were finished, in 1339, the Signory went in procession to\r\nview them; this proves in what esteem they must have been held, for the\r\nSignory never left the Palazzo Vecchio in a body except on the most\r\nimportant occasions. After examining the gates they conferred the honor\r\nof citizenship upon the sculptor. These gates told the story of John\r\nthe Baptist, and the work is full of sentiment, beauty, and simplicity,\r\nwhile the design is pure, the draperies full of elegant grace, and the\r\nexecution of the whole almost perfect.\r\n\r\nNINO PISANO was the son of the latter. The time of his birth is not\r\nknown; he died before 1361. His works are pleasing, and he especially\r\nexcelled in drapery. They are not numerous, and are seen in the churches\r\nof Pisa.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most important pupil of Andrea Pisano, and, indeed, the\r\nmost important Tuscan master of the end of the fourteenth century, was\r\nANDREA ARCAGNUOLO DI CIONE, commonly called ANDREA ORCAGNA (1329-1376?).\r\nThis artist was the son of Maestro Cione, a goldsmith of Florence.\r\nOrcagna was an architect, goldsmith, sculptor, painter, mosaist, and\r\npoet. Painting is the art by which he is best known and of which he\r\nexecuted the greatest number of interesting works. In this place we\r\nshall speak of his most important work as a sculptor, which was the\r\ntabernacle in the church of Or San Michele, in Florence, made to hold\r\nthe picture of the Madonna painted by Ugolino da Siena. This tabernacle\r\nis of white marble in the Gothic style. It rises from the centre high up\r\ntoward the roof of the church, and has sculptures in bas-relief,\r\nstatuettes and busts, all illustrating the life of the Virgin from her\r\nbirth to her death. It is also enriched with mosaics, intaglios,\r\nenamels, gilded glass, _pietra dura_, and all of these arranged in a\r\nwhole which is quite unique in art. It may be regarded as a piece of\r\narchitecture or as a sculptural work, and it is full of symbolism; and\r\nwhatever view is taken of it, it commands admiration for the artist who\r\nconceived and executed so difficult a task.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of the fourteenth century there were many\r\nsculptors in Italy of whom we know very little more than their names.\r\nThey did a vast amount of work in all parts of the country, much of\r\nwhich is still to be seen. One of these, of whom few personal facts are\r\nknown, exerted a large influence in Florence, where the fruits of his\r\nindustry were almost marvellous. He was called PIETRO DI GIOVANNI and\r\nPIETRO TEDESCO, or \"the German\". The time and place of his birth are not\r\nknown, but the records show that he worked on the Cathedral of Florence\r\nfrom 1386 to 1399. He worked in true German style; wherever scroll-work\r\nand simple ornamental designs were required he mingled a variety of\r\nleaves and flowers where the acanthus alone had before been used. He\r\nalso made fantastic little human beings, dwarfs and grotesque beings of\r\ndifferent sorts, and exhausted the animal world in his designs. Lions,\r\nbears, apes, dogs, lizards, crabs, birds and fish, bees, butterflies,\r\nand all manner of insects may be seen nestling among vines and branches,\r\nwhile angels play on pipes and violas. The whole effect of these works\r\nis cheerful and natural, and would be as suitable to decorate a music\r\nhall or a theatre as they are for a church.\r\n\r\nThe works of this master are too extreme in the realistic element to be\r\ntaken as a fair example of the Italian sculpture of this time, but\r\nNICCOLÒ OF ARREZZO, the MASSEGNE, and the BON or BUONI family, and many\r\nothers in different portions of the country contributed to put aside the\r\nstiff, formal manner of the past, and to bring in the more sympathetic\r\nand natural one of the fifteenth century. In truth, the last decades of\r\nthe fourteenth century were a transition period, when art was bursting\r\nits bonds, and was preparing for the glorious works of the golden days\r\nof sculpture in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nITALIAN SCULPTURE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no one great influence or circumstance which led up to the\r\nrevival of art and letters which took place in the fifteenth century,\r\nand which is known under the general name of the Renaissance. Its causes\r\nwere many, and may be traced in every department of the life of the\r\nMiddle Ages--in religion, politics, learning, and the habits of the\r\npeople. This is far too great a topic for us to enter on here, and we\r\nmust keep to the one matter which we have in hand.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, heretofore, as we have shown, sculpture had been almost\r\nentirely separated from other arts, and stood by itself. Its works had\r\nbeen the smaller objects of which we have spoken; and though these were\r\noftentimes splendid in their design and execution, they did not afford\r\nthe sculptor the same broad field for his work as he has when his\r\nproductions are combined with architecture. Now all this was changed.\r\nThe French and German artists had brought out a style of architecture of\r\ntheir own, the Italians pursued another course, and went back to classic\r\nart for their teaching, and now every opportunity was given for\r\nsculpture to assume its utmost importance; and the art of ancient Greece\r\nwas studied with all the enthusiasm of the Italian nature.\r\n\r\nThe masters of Florence, or, rather, of Tuscany, were of great\r\nimportance in the beginning of the new movement, and I shall speak\r\nfirst of them. FRANCESCO SQUARCIONE, who lived from 1396 to 1474, was a\r\npainter, and travelled into Greece to collect antique objects, and made\r\nmany drawings from the monuments which he saw. He established a school\r\nin Padua, and his museum was of advantage to sculptors as well as to\r\npainters. Other Tuscan artists who were in love with classic art\r\nwandered among its remains in Rome and other parts of Italy, and brought\r\nback to their homes a greater knowledge of sculpture, as well as the\r\ndrawings which they had made; and in this part of Italy the Renaissance\r\nearly made itself a living, active power.\r\n\r\nAmong the very first of these sculptors was JACOPO DELLA QUERCIA\r\n(1374-1438), who was so called from the little market town of Quercia,\r\nnear Siena, in which he was born. His father was a goldsmith, and\r\ninstructed his son in his art; but the boy loved sculpture, and studied\r\nit under one Luca di Giovanni. When but nineteen years old he made an\r\nequestrian statue of wood, and covered it with cloth, and painted it to\r\nrepresent marble in a manner which proved him to be an artist. About\r\nthis time he left his home, and the next that we know of him was about\r\nten years later, when his design for the gates of the Baptistery of\r\nFlorence was pronounced to be next in merit to those of Ghiberti and\r\nBrunelleschi.\r\n\r\nIn 1408 Quercia went to Ferrara, where he did several works. While there\r\nhe was called by the Signory of Siena to make a new fountain in the\r\nPiazza del Campo. This was a beautiful work, and even in this century,\r\nthough much injured, its remaining sculptures prove that it must have\r\nbeen a wonder in its day. It has been restored after the original model\r\nby Quercia, who was often called Jacopo della Fonte on account of this\r\nwork. He executed some sculptures in Lucca, but his masterpiece was the\r\ndecoration of the great portal of the Basilica of San Petronio, at\r\nBologna. (Fig. 82.)\r\n\r\nThe fifteen reliefs here represent the history of Adam and Eve, and\r\nother stories from the creation to the deluge. They show the full\r\nfreedom and power of Quercia's style, and are among the most attractive\r\nof all the Tuscan sculptures of this period. Duringd the last years of\r\nhis life this artist was employed as superintendent of the works upon\r\nthe Cathedral of Siena, in which city he died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--RELIEF BY JACOPO DELLA QUERCIA. _Bologna._]\r\n\r\nWe come now to speak of the famous LORENZO GHIBERTI (1378-1455), who was\r\nborn in Florence, and was both a goldsmith and sculptor; and though his\r\nfame rests upon his bas-reliefs, yet the exquisite detail and careful\r\nfinish in them came from his practice of the goldsmith's art. In 1398 a\r\nplague broke out in Florence, and Ghiberti fled to Rimini for safety.\r\nWhile there he painted a few pictures; but his name is so linked with\r\nthe splendid gates which he made for the Baptistery of Florence that it\r\nis of those that one naturally thinks when his name is heard.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the gates which Andrea Pisano had made to this\r\nBaptistery long before; these were for the south side; and when, in\r\n1400, the plague again visited Florence the people believed that the\r\nwrath of Heaven should be appeased by a thank-offering. Accordingly the\r\nGuild of Wool-merchants promised to add gates on the north and east of\r\nthe Baptistery of St. John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nA time was appointed for the examination of designs, and many artists\r\nentered into the competition, and sent in their drawings and models. A\r\ngreat number of these represented the Sacrifice of Isaac. At length all\r\nthe models were set aside but two, and these were made by Brunelleschi\r\nand Ghiberti; then the former declared that he thought his rival's\r\ndesign the best, thus showing a nobility of character which cannot be\r\ntoo much praised.\r\n\r\nThe commission was thus given to Ghiberti, who first executed the\r\nnorthern gates. He began them in 1403, and finished them twenty-one\r\nyears later. They illustrate the life of Christ in twenty scenes; they\r\nhave also the figures of the evangelists and the four Fathers of the\r\nChurch in a beautiful framework of foliage, animals, and other\r\nornamental figures, which divides and incloses the larger compositions.\r\nThese gates are done in a manner much in advance of that of Pisano, and\r\nyet they retain some features of an earlier style which are not found in\r\nGhiberti's later works. But from the first he showed original talent, as\r\none may see by his model of the Sacrifice of Isaac, which is preserved\r\nin the Museum of the Bargello, beside that of Brunelleschi.\r\n\r\nThese northern gates are very beautiful, but those on the east are far\r\nmore so; it is of these last that Michael Angelo declared, \"They are\r\nworthy to be the gates of Paradise!\" These are divided into ten\r\ncompartments, representing: 1, Creation of Adam and Eve; 2, History of\r\nCain and Abel; 3, Noah; 4, Abraham and Isaac; 5, Jacob and Esau; 6,\r\nHistory of Joseph; 7, Moses on Mount Sinai; 8, Joshua before Jericho; 9,\r\nDavid and Goliath; 10, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (Fig. 83).\r\n\r\nThis sculptor showed great skill for one in his age, but to us there is\r\nsome disappointment in them on account of the crowded appearance of the\r\nfigures. Familiarity with them, however, reveals their beauty, and we\r\nfind that, in truth, the stories Ghiberti wished to tell are brought out\r\nwith much distinctness. They will ever remain one of the great monuments\r\nof the sculpture of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nGhiberti endeavored to introduce fine backgrounds to his reliefs, which\r\ngave him an opportunity to add figures illustrating other incidents than\r\nthe principal one of the work. His sculptures show the influence of the\r\nGothic style, the study of nature and that of the antique all combined;\r\nwith these are united his own power of conception, his ability in\r\ndesign, and his wonderful delicacy of execution. These gates have been\r\ncontinually studied by the artists of his own and succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe next work of importance by Ghiberti is the sarcophagus of St.\r\nZenobius in the Cathedral of Florence. Other lesser sculptures are in\r\nother churches in Florence and in the Cathedral of Siena.\r\n\r\nWe come now to one of the most interesting sculptors of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. DONATELLO he was called, but his real name was DONATO DI BETTO\r\nBARDI (1386-1468). He was born in Florence, and from his boyhood was a\r\nmember of the family of the rich banker Ruberto Martelli, who was the\r\nfirm friend of the sculptor for life, and when he died he provided in\r\nhis will that the works by Donatello which he bequeathed to his family\r\nshould never be pledged, sold, or given away, but kept as a perpetual\r\ninheritance for his heirs. Donatello was a realist, and followed nature\r\nwith great exactness. This was not always productive of beauty in his\r\nworks; indeed, some of them are very ugly, and a story which illustrates\r\nthis is told of himself and Brunelleschi. Donatello had made a crucifix,\r\ncarved from wood, for the Church of Santa Croce, and when it was\r\nfinished he asked Brunelleschi's opinion of it. This latter artist was\r\nprincipally an architect; but as he had learned the goldsmith's trade,\r\nhe executed some sculptures, and a close friendship existed between\r\nhimself and Donatello. Relying on their love for each other,\r\nBrunelleschi frankly told Donatello that his crucifix was very ugly, and\r\nhis figure of Christ like that of a day-laborer, whereas it should\r\nrepresent a person of the greatest possible beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--FROM THE EASTERN GATES. _Showing compartments\r\n6, 8, and 10._]\r\n\r\nDonatello was very angry at this, and exclaimed, \"It is easier to\r\ncriticise than to execute; do you take a piece of wood and make a better\r\ncrucifix!\" Brunelleschi determined to do this, and when his work was\r\nfinished he invited Donatello to sup with him. He placed the crucifix in\r\na conspicuous place in his house, and then took Donatello with him to\r\nthe market to buy their food. He gave the parcels to Donatello, and\r\nasked him to go before to the house, saying that he would soon follow.\r\nWhen Donatello entered and saw the crucifix he was so delighted at the\r\nsight that he forgot everything else, and dropped the eggs, cheese, and\r\nall on the floor, and stood gazing at the carving as motionless as if he\r\nwere a statue himself. When Brunelleschi came he said, \"What are we to\r\ndo now? You have spoiled all the dinner!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had dinner enough for to-day,\" replied Donatello. \"You may have\r\na better appetite. To you, I confess, belongs the power of carving the\r\nfigure of Christ; to me that of representing day-laborers.\"\r\n\r\nThis famous crucifix by Brunelleschi is now in the Gondi Chapel of the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria Novella; that by Donatello is in the chapel of\r\nSaints Ludovico and Bartolommeo in the Church of Santa Croce.\r\n\r\nThe Annunciation cut from sandstone, which is in Santa Croce, is one of\r\nhis earliest works, and is full of grace and nobleness (Fig. 84). He\r\nmade some beautiful groups of dancing children, which are now in the\r\nUffizi Gallery; but he considered his David, which is in the same\r\ngallery, as his masterpiece. He was so proud of it that he swore by it,\r\nsaying, \"By the faith I have in my Zuccone!\" This word means bald-head,\r\nand had come to be used as the usual name for the David.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--THE ANNUNCIATION. _By Donatello._]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his liking for the David, it is generally thought that\r\nhis St. George, on the exterior of the Church of Or San Michele, is far\r\nbetter. The German art-writer Grimm thus speaks of this work: \"What a\r\nman is the St. George in the niche of the Church of Or San Michele! He\r\nstands there in complete armor, sturdily, with his legs somewhat\r\nstriding apart, resting on both with equal weight, as if he meant to\r\nstand so that no power could move him from his post. Straight before him\r\nhe holds up his high shield; both hands touch its edge, partly for the\r\nsake of holding it, partly in order to rest on it; the eyes and brows\r\nare full of expectant boldness.... We approach this St. George, and the\r\nmere artistic interest is transformed suddenly into a more lively\r\nsympathy with the person of the master.... Who is it, we ask, who has\r\nplaced such a man there, so ready for battle?\" (Fig. 85.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--STATUE OF ST. GEORGE. _By Donatello._]\r\n\r\nDonatello's impetuosity led him into many rash acts. Among other\r\ninstances of this it is related that a rich Genoese merchant gave an\r\norder for a portrait bust of himself in bronze; when it was finished the\r\ngreat Duke Cosimo de' Medici, who was a friend of Donatello, admired the\r\nwork so much that he placed it on his balcony, so that all Florentines\r\nwho passed by could see it. When the merchant was given the price of the\r\nbust he objected to it, and it was referred to Duke Cosimo for\r\nsettlement. In the conversation the Genoese said that the bust could be\r\nmade in a month, and that he was willing to pay the artist a dollar a\r\nday for his time and labor.\r\n\r\nWhen Donatello heard this he exclaimed, \"I know how to destroy the\r\nresult of the study of years in the twinkling of an eye!\" and he threw\r\nthe bust into the street below, where it was broken into fragments. Then\r\nthe merchant was deeply mortified, and offered the sculptor double the\r\nprice he had asked if he would repeat the work; but though Donatello\r\nsadly needed the money he would not do this, and persisted in his\r\nrefusal, even when Cosimo de' Medici tried to persuade him to consent.\r\n\r\nWhen Donatello was old Duke Cosimo gave him an allowance which would\r\nsupport himself and four workmen; but in spite of this Donatello wore\r\nsuch shabby clothes that Cosimo sent him a red surcoat, a mantle and\r\nhood. These Donatello returned, saying they were far too fine for him.\r\nWhen the sculptor at length became feeble and bedridden his benefactor\r\nhad died, but Piero de' Medici, the son of Cosimo, was careful to keep\r\nhim in comfort; and when he died his funeral was attended with much\r\nceremony. He was buried near Duke Cosimo, in the Church of San Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Donatello's works are in this church, and are a more suitable\r\nmonument to his memory than any that could be made by other hands.\r\n\r\nThe works of Donatello are numerous, both in marble and bronze, and in\r\nboth these substances he made statues and reliefs. We cannot speak in\r\ndetail of all that he accomplished; but as he lived in an age when every\r\nadvance in art was an event in history, we must not forget to say that\r\nhe made the first equestrian statue which had been produced since the\r\ntime of the Romans. This statue is in Padua, in front of the Church of\r\nSan Antonio; it is of colossal size, and represents the Venetian General\r\nGattamelata; and though it does not satisfy our conception as an\r\nequestrian statue, it is worthy of some praise when we remember all the\r\ncircumstances of its origin. It is not probable that Donatello had ever\r\nseen an antique equestrian statue, unless it might have been that of\r\nMarcus Aurelius, which was found in the Forum in 1187; no modern statues\r\nexisted as examples for him; he was not familiar with the modelling of\r\nhorses, and for every reason it was a bold thing for him to undertake\r\nsuch a work.\r\n\r\nDonatello had more influence upon the art of his time than any other\r\nTuscan sculptor, with the single exception of Michael Angelo. As a man\r\nhe was honest, simple, and upright in all his dealings; as a friend he\r\nwas loyal and faithful; as a Christian he was humble and charitable, and\r\nleft behind him a name which has been handed down through more than four\r\ncenturies with respect and honor.\r\n\r\nLUCA DELLA ROBBIA (1400-1481) is another native of Florence, whose name\r\nis widely known. Like many others, he began life as a goldsmith, and in\r\nthis way gained a mastery over detail and a finish of style that are\r\nremarkable in all his works. He turned his attention to sculpture early\r\nin life, and was so enthusiastic in his pursuit of this art that he\r\nworked night and day, minding neither cold nor hunger and fatigue; in\r\nthe beginning he made numerous wax models, which have perished, and with\r\nall his industry we have no work of his before he was forty-five years\r\nold, except the reliefs of Music, Philosophy, Geometry, Grammar and\r\nAstronomy, Plato and Aristotle, Ptolemy and Euclid, and a man playing a\r\nlute, which are set into the side of the Campanile at Florence, and two\r\nscenes from the life of St. Peter, which are in the Uffizi.\r\n\r\nIn the same gallery are also the series of reliefs which Luca began when\r\nforty-five years old for the balustrade of an organ in the cathedral.\r\nThese reliefs represent boys singing, dancing, and playing on musical\r\ninstruments (Fig. 86). The attitudes are so graceful and so varied, and\r\nthe expressions on the faces are so many, that there is much to admire\r\nin a subject which in unskilful hands would be very monotonous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--DANCING BOYS. _By Luca della Robbia._]\r\n\r\nNo sculptures since the classic days represent child-life with such\r\nfreshness and charming qualities, and these alone would have raised Luca\r\nto a high rank as a sculptor. In the Uffizi one is able to examine these\r\nworks closely, and they gain by this nearness to the eye, which enables\r\none to see the minuteness of his finish. There are various works of his\r\nin bronze and marble still to be seen in the churches of Florence, but\r\nthe special art to which he gave his attention was to the perfecting of\r\nenamel upon terra-cotta--on the making of what is known as the Robbia\r\nware. In this he achieved a great success, and his bas-reliefs are very\r\nbeautiful. At first he used but few colors, but later he increased their\r\nnumber, and was able to produce a combined effect of painting and relief\r\nthat is very pleasing.\r\n\r\nThese works were used for altar-pieces, medallions on exteriors,\r\nfountains, wall decoration, and a great variety of purposes. Twelve\r\nmedallions representing the months, which are in the South Kensington\r\nMuseum, are said to have been made by Luca to decorate a writing cabinet\r\nfor one of the Medici.\r\n\r\nLuca worked with his nephew, Andrea, who had four sons; and when Luca\r\ndied his secrets belonged to them, and made their fortunes. They were\r\noccupied eleven years in making a frieze to a hospital in Pistoja; it\r\nrepresented the Seven Acts of Mercy. One of them went to France and\r\ndecorated the Château of Madrid for Francis I. Pope Leo X. employed\r\nanother to pave the Loggie of the Vatican with Robbia tiles, and these\r\nwares, in one form and another, were used in numberless ways, both\r\nuseful and decorative.\r\n\r\nThe Robbia family was followed by other workers in glazed ware, and\r\nduring about a century it was a prominent feature in art, and then was\r\ngradually given up.\r\n\r\nThe most noted pupil of Donatello was ANDREA DEL VEROCCHIO (1432-1488).\r\nHe was born at Florence, and was early apprenticed to a goldsmith called\r\nVerocchio, from whom the sculptor took his surname. It is said that this\r\nname came from the fact that the elder Verocchio had remarkable\r\nexactness of sight.\r\n\r\nNeither the metal works nor the paintings which Verocchio did remain,\r\nand after about 1466 he devoted himself entirely to sculpture. It is\r\ndifficult to associate him with Donatello; his execution is finished\r\nlike most sculptors who were also metal-workers; his nude parts are true\r\nto nature, but not graceful or attractive, and his draperies are in\r\nsmall folds, which give a tumbled, crumpled effect rather than that of\r\nthe easy, graceful falling of soft material.\r\n\r\nHis best works are a David in the Museum of the Bargello, Florence; a\r\nbronze Genius pressing a Dolphin to itself on a fountain in the court of\r\nthe Palazzo Vecchio (Fig. 87); an equestrian statue of Colleoni before\r\nthe Church of San Giovanni e Paolo, Venice (Fig. 88); and a group of St.\r\nThomas examining the Wounds of Christ at the Church of Or San Michele,\r\nFlorence. This last work is in his best and latest manner; the\r\nexpression is powerful, but the drapery is still very faulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--BOY WITH DOLPHIN. _By Verocchio._]\r\n\r\nAlthough this equestrian statue is called by Verocchio's name, he did\r\nnot live to see it completed; and though it was without doubt made from\r\nhis design, still some credit for its execution is due to Alessandro\r\nLeopardo, who finished it. When Colleoni died he left all his large\r\nfortune to the Republic of Venice on condition that they should erect\r\nan equestrian monument to him in the square of St. Mark. As it was\r\nforbidden by the laws of Venice to place such things in the Piazza of\r\nSt. Mark, it was placed in its present position, before the Church of\r\nSan Giovanni e Paolo, on the square of the School of St. Mark, and it\r\nwas thought that this answered the requirements of the will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--STATUE OF COLLEONI. _By Verocchio._]\r\n\r\nWhen Verocchio had gone to Venice and had modelled the horse, he was\r\ntold that the Signory intended to have the rider made by another\r\nsculptor. He felt this to be an insult, and broke off the head and legs\r\nof the horse, and left Venice for Florence. The Signory issued a decree\r\nforbidding him to set foot again on Venetian soil under pain of death.\r\nThe sculptor replied that he should not take the risk, as he well knew\r\nthat the Signory could take off his head, and he could not put it on,\r\nwhile he could replace his horse's head with a better one. The Venetians\r\nknew that this was true, and repealed their decree, and doubling his\r\npay, asked him to come to complete his work. Verocchio consented to do\r\nso, but had not been long in Venice when he died. Verocchio is said to\r\nhave spent much time in drawing from the antique, and his works prove\r\nhim to have been diligent and painstaking; these qualities made him the\r\nsculptor that he was; but we see no traces in his work of the\r\nheaven-born genius which makes the artist great, and so inspires himself\r\nthat his works fill all beholders with an enthusiasm in a degree akin to\r\nhis own; the works of such artists as Verocchio, who have only the\r\nexcellencies which come from patient industry, interest us, but they\r\ncannot move our hearts.\r\n\r\nIt often happened in Italy that a number of artists belonged to the same\r\nfamily, as in the case of the Robbias. One such family had the name of\r\nGAMBARELLI, but were known in art as the ROSSELLINI. There were five\r\nsculptors of this name, all brothers. Two of them had great ability,\r\nBernardo and Antonio. Bernardo was most distinguished as an architect,\r\nand some very celebrated edifices were built from his designs; he also\r\nexecuted some excellent sculptures, among which are the fine monument of\r\nLionardo Bruni in the Church of Santa Croce, and that of the Beata\r\nVillana in Santa Maria Novella, Florence. The first is one of the best\r\nmonuments in Tuscany. In the Uffizi are a bust of St. John, a charming\r\nwork, and a portrait bust of Battista Sforza.\r\n\r\nANTONIO ROSSELLINO (1427-1490), called PROCONSOLO, from the quarter of\r\nFlorence in which he was born, was by far the best sculptor of the\r\nfamily. He is called a pupil of Donatello, but his work very closely\r\nresembles that of Ghiberti. Among his best works are the monument to\r\nCardinal Portogallo, in the Church of San Miniato, near Florence; that\r\nof Mary of Aragon in Monte Oliveto at Naples; a relief of the Nativity\r\nin the same church, and a relief of the Adoring Madonna in the Uffizi\r\nGallery. His characteristics were grace, delicacy of treatment,\r\nsweetness of expression, and all these combined with a noble dignity.\r\n\r\nOther Tuscan sculptors of this period were DESIDERIO DA SETTIGNANO, MINO\r\nDA FIESOLE (1400-1486), ANDREA FERRUCCI (1465-1526), and BENEDETTO DA\r\nMAJANO (1442-1498), who was eminent as an architect as well as for his\r\nsculpture. His father was a stone-cutter, and two other sons in the\r\nfamily were artists. Benedetto began life as a worker in wooden mosaics,\r\nor intarsiatore, as it is called. He made two beautiful inlaid chests,\r\nand carried them to Hungary as a gift to King Matthias Corvinus, whose\r\nfame as a patron of art had reached his ears. But the young artist was\r\ndoomed to a dreadful disappointment, for when he unpacked his chests in\r\nthe presence of the king it was found that the sea-damp had spoiled\r\nthem, and the mosaics had fallen apart. Benedetto then determined to\r\nwork in more durable materials, and executed some sculptures in marble\r\nand terra-cotta while he remained in Hungary.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Florence, Benedetto worked as an architect, and the\r\nStrozzi Palace was built after his design. His masterpiece in sculpture\r\nwas the monument to Filippo Strozzi, in the Strozzi Chapel in Santa\r\nMaria Novella, and it also merits mention among the best works of the\r\nfifteenth century. A pulpit in Santa Croce, by Benedetto, is also very\r\nfine, and his skill was shown here in his supporting the pulpit against\r\na column and putting the staircase by which the pulpit is entered inside\r\nthe column; thus it was concealed, and the building in no wise weakened,\r\nwhile the pulpit is far more beautiful than it would be were the\r\nstaircase in sight.\r\n\r\nBenedetto was summoned to Naples by the Duke of Calabria, who gave him\r\ncommissions which occupied him for two years. Few Tuscan sculptors have\r\nproduced more pleasing works than Benedetto's; though not profound they\r\nare pleasing and unaffected, and in whatever frame of mind one may be,\r\nthey do not disturb, but rather soothe and charm, as they could not do\r\nif they were false in sentiment or executed in an affected manner.\r\n\r\nMATTEO CIVITALI DI GIOVANNI (1435-1501) was born in Lucca, but studied\r\nart in Florence. His statue of St. Sebastian in the Cathedral of Lucca\r\nwas so much admired by the painter Perugino that he copied it in his\r\npicture of the Entombment.\r\n\r\nCivitali's chief work in sculpture was the tomb of Pietro da Noceto in\r\nthe same cathedral. In Genoa, in the Chapel of St. John the Baptist, he\r\nexecuted six statues and five bas-reliefs. A bas-relief of Faith by\r\nCivitali in the Uffizi Gallery is a fine work, full of earnestness and\r\ndeep religious feeling.\r\n\r\nCivitali was also an accomplished architect, and did much to improve the\r\nstyle of building in Lucca. The beautiful temple of the Volto Santo in\r\nthe cathedral was designed by him.\r\n\r\nThis sculptor may be said to have had four different styles of work. The\r\nSt. Sebastian was in his earliest manner, and is simply realistic; his\r\nsecond manner was the best; it is pure and dignified in conception,\r\nwhile deep feeling pervades all; the tomb of Noceto was in this second\r\nstyle; his third manner was more free and less pure, while the fourth,\r\nas seen in his work at Genoa, is full of extravagant exaggeration.\r\n\r\nNext to the sculptors of the Tuscan or Florentine school of this period\r\nwere those of Venice in importance and independence of manner. This\r\nschool was much influenced by that of Tuscany because of the nearness of\r\nthe two cities and the constant communication between them, as well as\r\nby the fact that Tuscan sculptors were more or less employed in Venice.\r\nOne of the earliest Venetian sculptors was ANTONIO GIOVANNI BREGNO,\r\ncalled ANTONIO RIZZO or RICCIO (about 1430-1498?). Although he was born\r\nin Verona, and there had the opportunity to study the Roman ruins which\r\nare the pride of the city, he is yet essentially an artist of Venice,\r\nsince he spent most of his life there, and was even at the head of the\r\nworkshop for the sculptors who worked upon the palace. One little\r\nepisode in the life of this artist was an expedition to Scutari with the\r\nVenetian soldiers, who went to its defence against the Turks. Rizzo\r\nshowed himself so brave in action, and was so severely wounded, that\r\nafter his return to Venice the Senate gave him a pension which lasted\r\nthrough twenty years. Rizzo so won the confidence of the Venetians that\r\nhe was appointed to important offices with large salaries, and it is sad\r\nto be forced to add that he proved to be a dishonest man, and when his\r\naccounts were examined he fled to Foligno, where he soon died. We will\r\nnot speak of him as an architect; as a sculptor he is known by statues\r\nof Adam and Eve in niches opposite the Giant's Staircase in the Ducal\r\nPalace, and by sepulchral monuments in the Church of the Frari. While\r\nhis works cannot be highly praised for beauty, they do show the style of\r\nthe Renaissance distinctly.\r\n\r\nLOMBARDO is the family name of three sculptors of this period in Venice.\r\nThey were PIETRO and his two sons, TULLIO and ANTONIO, and the three\r\ntogether are spoken of as the Lombardi. Pietro, the father, was as much\r\nan architect as a sculptor, and the works of the father and son are so\r\nassociated that it is difficult to speak of them separately. We know\r\nthat Tullio was the superior artist of the three, but there are no works\r\nof theirs that command a detailed description here. The monument to the\r\nDoge Pietro Mocenigo, in the Church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, the angels\r\nof the font in San Martino, an altar-relief in the altar of San Giovanni\r\nCrisostomo, reliefs on the front of the Scuola di San Marco, and two\r\nreliefs in the Church of San Antonio at Padua, are the principal\r\nsculptures of the Lombardi.\r\n\r\nALESSANDRO LEOPARDO, who flourished about 1490, was the most eminent\r\nbronze-caster of his time, and was distinguished for the happy manner in\r\nwhich he adapted classic ideas to his needs in his works.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the life of this sculptor, and that little is\r\nnot to his credit. He lived in Venice, and had a studio in the Piazza\r\ndel Cavallo, and in 1487 committed a forgery, for which he was banished\r\nfrom the city. But when Verocchio died, leaving the Colleoni statue\r\nunfinished, the Senate desired to have it completed by Leopardo, so they\r\nsent him a safe-conduct for six months, and he returned to Venice. As\r\nthere is no account of his again leaving the city, it is supposed that\r\nhe was allowed to remain as long as he chose. There has been much\r\ndifference of opinion as to which artist--Verocchio or Leopardo--should\r\nbe credited with the excellence of the Colleoni statue. The truth, as\r\nnear as it can be told, seems to be that Verocchio designed and modelled\r\nit, that Leopardo completed and cast it, and made the lofty pedestal\r\nupon which it stands, and which, taken by itself, is a splendid work. It\r\nis of fine proportions, and has six Corinthian columns, in the capitals\r\nof which there are dolphins, while the frieze is composed of trophies\r\nand marine animals, all of which are symbols of the City on the Sea\r\nwhich erected the monument.\r\n\r\nAfter the Colleoni statue was unveiled the Senate gave Leopardo an order\r\nfor three standard bases of bronze to be placed in the Piazza of St.\r\nMark's. He also made three splendid candelabra for the Venetian Academy.\r\nLeopardo was also an architect. The time of his death is very\r\nuncertain, but a writer speaks of him in 1541 as \"the new glory of our\r\nage, who shines like a star in the Venetian waters.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough an immense amount of sculpture of this period remains in\r\nvarious parts of Italy, it is very difficult to trace the story of\r\nseparate artists and to give a satisfactory account of those whose works\r\nare worthy of high praise. There is scarcely an Italian city of any size\r\nwhich has not some splendid remains of this morning of the Renaissance.\r\nIn Ancona there are the portal of San Francesco and the front of\r\nMercanzia, with which the name of Giorgio da Sebenico is associated. At\r\nRimini the Church of San Francesco, with its wealth of plastic ornament,\r\ncannot be ascribed to any one artist or to any number with surety; it is\r\nin the style of Luca della Robbia and Donatello, but in the execution\r\ndoes not reach their standard. In Cesena, Padua, and Verona there are\r\nfifteenth-century sculptures, and in the Milanese territory the plastic\r\nart of this period is very interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 89, 90.--TERRA-COTTAS FROM THE OSPEDALE GRANDE.\r\n_Milan._]\r\n\r\nIn Milan, in the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, in the Ospedale\r\nGrande, and in the cathedral there is a wealth of sculpture to reward\r\nthe student of this art who visits them; and in the Museum of the Breda\r\nthere are many interesting works. The terra-cotta decoration of the\r\nOspedale excels all other works of this sort in upper Italy, and the\r\nimmense façade of this edifice is a marvel in its way (Figs. 89, 90).\r\nThe differences between this hospital and the wonderful Milan Cathedral\r\nafford a remarkable contrast in works of the same period.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI ANTONIO AMADEO, or OMODEO (1447-1520), was born on a farm near\r\nthe Certosa of Pavia. When but nineteen years old his name appears as\r\none of those who were employed upon this splendid edifice, and the\r\nrecords of his payments show that his work was well considered, even\r\nthen. Omodeo was undoubtedly the best sculptor of his time in all\r\nLombardy, and his sculptures in the Colleoni Chapel at Bergamo would be\r\nsufficient to make any artist famous. The whole work may be called his,\r\nfor he designed the building and the sculptures of the façade, which are\r\nin the richest style of the Renaissance; there are statuettes,\r\ncolonettes, busts, medallions, and bas-reliefs, and wherever a flat\r\nsurface exists it is divided into diamond-shaped slabs of colored\r\nmarbles. The portal is very much ornamented: on each side of the rose\r\nwindow above this entrance there are busts of Cæsar and Augustus in\r\ncontrast with numbers of angels' heads not far away. There are\r\nbas-reliefs representing children playing upon musical instruments, and\r\nthe whole front of the chapel, with its numerous pilasters and\r\ncolonettes, has been compared to a gigantic organ, by Mr. Perkins, in\r\nhis \"Italian Sculptors\".\r\n\r\nOf the interior decoration we can only say that it is much in Omodeo's\r\nstyle, though the monument to Colleoni, the founder of the chapel, is\r\nsaid to be the work of German sculptors, and to have been done after\r\nOmodeo left Bergamo.\r\n\r\nAt Pavia, Omodeo succeeded Guiniforte as chief architect of the Certosa,\r\nand designed the façade, which was made by him and his successors. The\r\nbas-relief of the Deposition from the Cross, which is on the front of\r\nthe high-altar here, is the work of Omodeo. At Cremona and at Isola\r\nBella he executed some monuments, but at length, in 1490, he began his\r\nwork on the Cathedral of Milan. Here a cupola was commenced after his\r\nmodel and under his direction; but when it was partly done doubts of its\r\nsolidity were expressed, and Omodeo was commanded to leave it and design\r\nthe north door to the cathedral. He also constructed the spiral\r\nstaircase leading to the roof through an elegant Gothic turret, where\r\nthe medallion portrait of Omodeo may be seen. It has since been proved\r\nthat the cupola of Omodeo was solid enough, for it has sustained the\r\nspire which was put upon it in 1772; but he was tormented concerning it\r\nin many ways, and died without justification.\r\n\r\nOmodeo stands at the head of northern Italian sculptors in his dexterous\r\nuse of his chisel; his ease in composition and his skill in the\r\nmanagement of drapery would have made him eminent; but the effect of all\r\nthese good qualities was injured by his mannerism, and the fact that his\r\nstandard of beauty was not a high one. This may be partly accounted for\r\nby the fact that in Lombardy an artist had no opportunity to study the\r\nremains of classic art, and this one circumstance very largely excuses\r\nthe inferiority of the northern sculptors to those of Tuscany, whose\r\ntaste had been much improved by close study of ancient plastic art.\r\n\r\nThere are many sculptors mentioned as having done some part of the work\r\nupon the Milan Cathedral, but very few are known, except by casual\r\nremark. CRISTOFORO SOLARI, called \"IL GOBBO, or DEL GOBBO,\" was one of\r\nthe most prominent, and yet we know almost nothing of his history until,\r\nin 1490, he was so disappointed when Omodeo was made architect of the\r\ncathedral instead of himself that he went to Venice, and remained there\r\nduring several years.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Solari was appointed ducal sculptor to Ludovico Moro, and\r\nthe monument which he erected to Beatrice d'Este was one of his\r\nprincipal works. When Ludovico lost his power Solari went to Rome, and\r\nremained until he was recalled to Milan to execute sculptures for the\r\ncathedral. He was very independent in his reply, and refused to go\r\nunless his conditions were complied with; one of these conditions was\r\nthat he should not be under the direction of any one, but should select\r\nhis marbles and his subjects to please himself. The statues he made are\r\nnot as fine as we might expect them to be after this beginning; however,\r\nhe was at length appointed head architect. Soon after this he was\r\nengaged in making a new model for a cupola, and then suddenly his name\r\nceases to appear upon the registers.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Como is another of those vast edifices which afforded\r\nopportunities for artists to make themselves famous. The principal part\r\nof the façade to this cathedral was ornamented by TOMMASO and JACOPO\r\nRODARI. The first was at one time architect of the cathedral, and\r\ntogether they executed a large portion of the sculptures. Their best\r\nwork was in the ornamental parts.\r\n\r\nIn the southern parts of Italy, both in the states of the Church and in\r\nNaples, there are many works of the fifteenth century which were\r\nexecuted by artists from Florence and other parts of Italy. Thus there\r\nis nothing new to be said concerning sculpture in Southern Italy during\r\nthis period, since the works which are not by foreign artists are in the\r\nsame style as theirs; for the native sculptors copied those from Central\r\nand Northern Italy, and no great progress or original manner can be\r\nfound in these southern districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSCULPTURE IN GERMANY, FRANCE, ENGLAND, AND SPAIN, FROM 1450 TO 1550.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Italy, as we have seen, the sculpture of the Renaissance was much\r\nadvanced by the fact that in the beginning of its growth the\r\narchitecture of the country was largely an imitation of Greek\r\narchitecture; and as the same artist was frequently an architect,\r\nsculptor, and painter, edifices were designed with the purpose of\r\nplacing the works of the sculptor in the most favorable positions.\r\n\r\nIn the countries north of Italy sculpture had no such aid or advantages.\r\nThe Gothic style of architecture was a hindrance to the sculptor, whose\r\nworks were combined with it. The Gothic construction afforded no broad,\r\ngenerous spaces for sculpture; all plastic work must be confined in\r\nlimited spaces between columns and baldachins, or in arched niches, or\r\nbetween narrow flutings; and though something had been done to vary the\r\nupright stiffness of the statues of its earliest days, there was no\r\nfreedom for the realistic and natural tendencies of the Renaissance art\r\nto develop in.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage on the side of Italian art was the fact that Italy was\r\na land of grace and beauty; its people were more refined in manner, more\r\nelegant and picturesque in their costumes than were those of Northern\r\nEurope, and all the influences surrounding the Italian artist were far\r\nmore favorable to a development of his artistic nature than were those\r\nof France or Germany. Then, too, the remains of antique art which were\r\nwithin reach of the Italian sculptor were quite shut off from others.\r\nFor all these and other reasons the sculpture of the north was more\r\ntardy in taking on the better spirit and form of the Renaissance, and as\r\na whole it never became as pleasing to most people as was the sculpture\r\nof Italy.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter we have spoken of the sculptor Claux Sluter and his\r\nwork at Dijon in the fourteenth century; the desire which he showed to\r\nmake his figures like the men they represented, and a general study of\r\nnature rather than of older works of sculpture, had much effect upon the\r\nsculpture of his time, and gradually became much exaggerated. German\r\nsculptors tried not only to make exact portraits of the faces and heads\r\nof their figures, but they gave the same attention to imitating every\r\ndetail of costume and every personal peculiarity of the model from which\r\nthey worked. This tended to weaken and narrow their own designs, and the\r\nwhole effect of their work is fantastic and exaggerated--an effect quite\r\nopposed to the noble and harmonious treatment of the whole which the\r\nbest Italian masters strove to attain.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to produce startling effects in German art made such\r\nsubjects as the Passion of Christ, the Temptation of St. Anthony, and\r\nthe Martyrdoms of the Saints to be constantly repeated, and many reliefs\r\nare overloaded with such details as may very properly be used in\r\npainting, and which belong to _picturesque_ art, but which take away the\r\ndignity and calm grandeur which should make the spirit of sculpture. But\r\nthere is one feature of German sculpture at this time which appeals to\r\nour sympathy--that is, the deep, earnest feeling which pervades it, and\r\nwhich constantly tried new methods of expression.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there were guilds or trade-associations, and the members of\r\nthese guilds were allowed to work in the special branch only of\r\nsculpture which belonged to their company, so that this art was divided\r\nby more fixed lines than in Italy, where, in truth, at the period of\r\nwhich we speak, the Florentine school was a supreme power, and its\r\nsculptors, as we have seen, worked in as many sorts of sculpture as\r\npleased them.\r\n\r\nThe schools of Germany were far more independent of each other, and the\r\nentire organization of art in Germany was very different from that of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent effects of the architecture of Germany was to\r\ndrive the sculptors to seek for such work as had no relation to\r\narchitecture, and an important result from this was the great attention\r\nwhich they paid to wood-carving; indeed, this was the favorite pursuit\r\nof the German sculptors for many years. About the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century the importance of this art in Germany was far greater\r\nthan those of bronze-casting or stone sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe principal works in wood-carving were the altars, which finally came\r\nto be colossal in size, and with their multitude of reliefs, statuettes,\r\nand ornaments were marvellous monuments to the industry and skill of the\r\nwood-carvers. The reliefs in these works are usually arranged on\r\nlandscape backgrounds, and so much resemble pictures in many ways that\r\nthe colors and gilding which were freely used on them do not seem out of\r\nplace, and it appears to be quite natural that wood-carvers should often\r\nhave been painters also.\r\n\r\nThe Swabian school, the principal seat of which was Ulm, was the\r\nearliest to adopt the new, realistic style. There are works by Swabian\r\nartists which show this tendency as early as 1431. JÖRG SYRLIN, who\r\nflourished during the last half of the fifteenth century, was an eminent\r\nwood-carver, and as he did not color his works he can be better judged\r\nas a sculptor than he could be if the effect of the whole depended\r\npartly upon painting. The choir-stalls in the Cathedral of Ulm and the\r\nfountain in the market-place, called \"Fischkasten,\" are his most\r\nimportant works; but a singing-desk, now in the museum, and other lesser\r\npieces are also excellent examples of his style. The choir-stalls have\r\nan immense number of figures and a mass of ornament, which made them far\r\nricher than any such work of an earlier date, and none that have since\r\nbeen made have equalled them. It is almost incredible that they were\r\ncompleted in four years, and yet there are no marks of haste upon the\r\nwork. The figures are dignified and graceful, the faces delicate and\r\nexpressive, the hands well formed, and a beauty of design and execution\r\nmarks the whole. The lower figures, which come nearest the eye, are\r\nfiner than those which are higher up, so that a unity of effect is\r\npreserved throughout the whole. He sometimes took occasion to give\r\ntouches of humor in his works, and in these stalls he introduced his own\r\nportrait and that of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe \"Fischkasten\" is sculptured in stone, and has three knights upon it\r\nwhich appear to be boldly advancing, as if about to step off and walk\r\naway. Other works by this master are less important, and it is doubtful\r\nif all that are called by his name are really his own. Jörg Syrlin, the\r\nyounger, trained by his father, adopted his style, and became an\r\nexcellent artist.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to speak of the Swabian sculptures in detail. Fine\r\nworks exist in Tiefenbronn, Rothenburg, Blaubeuren, Herrenberg, Gmünd,\r\nRavensburg, and many other places.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Swabian school was very wide; it can be traced in\r\nmany parts of Germany, in Hungary and Transylvania, and even in\r\nSwitzerland, Austria, and Bavaria. Swabian artists were often summoned\r\nto adjacent provinces, and thus did much work away from their homes. The\r\nreliefs upon the door of the Cathedral of Constance were executed by\r\nSimon Hayder, a Swabian, in 1470. The altar of the cathedral at Chur\r\nwas the work of Jacob Rösch, another Swabian master, who thus labored on\r\nthe very boundary of Italy. The school at Augsburg was the second\r\nSwabian school in importance, and much influence went out from that\r\ncentre, though its sculptures were not as fine as those of Ulm.\r\n\r\nIn some cases fine old sculptures still exist in the churches and other\r\nplaces for which they were intended. Again we find them either whole, or\r\nin parts, in museums to which they have been removed when they were no\r\nlonger required for the uses for which they were made, or when they were\r\nreplaced by more modern works. So few facts are known concerning them\r\nthat it is almost impossible to do more than repeat descriptions of the\r\nsubjects they represent; and this is neither profitable nor entertaining\r\nin a book of this kind; therefore I shall now speak only of such artists\r\nas have left some record behind them, and of works whose authorship can\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nVEIT STOSS, who flourished about the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nwas an eminent wood-carver. Very little is known about him. His name is\r\nsometimes said to be Wit Stwosz, and Cracow and Nuremberg both claim to\r\nhave been his birthplace. But it is now believed that he was born in\r\nNuremberg, as it is known that in 1477 he gave up his citizenship there\r\nand went to Cracow, and in 1496 he paid a small sum to be again made a\r\ncitizen of Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nWe also know that his reputation as a man was not good. In a Nuremberg\r\ndecree he is called a \"reckless and graceless citizen, who has caused\r\nmuch uneasiness to the honorable council and the whole town.\" He was\r\nconvicted of crimes for which he should have suffered death, but the\r\nsentence was changed, and he was branded: both cheeks were pierced with\r\na hot iron. After this he broke the oath he had taken to the city, and\r\njoined her enemies in plotting against her; he was subsequently\r\nimprisoned, and at his death, in 1533, he was very old and perfectly\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost like a contradiction to say that this master was one of\r\nthe most tender in feeling of all the wood-carvers of his time. He was\r\nespecially successful in representing the purity of the Madonna and of\r\nyouthful saints. His principal works are in the churches of Cracow and\r\nNuremberg. In the Frauenkirche at Cracow the high-altar, a part of the\r\nstalls in the choir, and some other sculptures are his. In Nuremberg his\r\nbest works are a bas-relief of the Crowning of the Virgin, which is\r\npreserved in the Burgkapelle; the great Madonna statue, which was placed\r\nin the Frauenkirche in 1504; and the colossal Angel's Salutation, which\r\nis suspended in the choir of the Church of St. Laurence. This last is an\r\nunusual and important work. The angel appears as if flying, and the\r\ndrapery is much inflated; the Virgin is queenly and majestic, yet\r\ngraceful; all around are medallions in which are represented the Seven\r\nSorrows of the Virgin. The style of these reliefs is charming if we\r\nexcept the drapery; that has the faults of the time, and is bad in\r\nstyle; but the female heads are all that we could ask; the whole design\r\nis distinct, and few reliefs could surpass these in simple beauty and\r\ngenuine artistic feeling.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable work of his is a panel of roses, now in the\r\nBurgkapelle. The panel is seven feet high by five wide; more than half\r\nof this is covered by a wreath of roses; there are besides four rows of\r\nsmall half-length figures arranged round a cross of St. Anthony, a\r\nrepresentation of the Last Judgment, scenes in the history of man from\r\nthe creation to the death of the Virgin, and many other saints and like\r\nsubjects in bits of reliefs, which fill up all spare spaces. The style\r\nis very distinct, and the draperies better in this work than in others\r\nfrom his hand.\r\n\r\nThere are other works in Nuremberg and elsewhere which are attributed\r\nto Veit Stoss, but these that are known to be his are quite enough to\r\nestablish his fame as a gifted artist and a remarkable sculptor for his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThough Stoss is among the early masters of Nuremberg, it is yet true\r\nthat others had been at work while he was in Cracow, and the way had\r\nbeen prepared for him and his work when he returned to his native city\r\nin 1496. Among the most active artists in Nuremberg was MICHAEL\r\nWOHLGEMUTH (1434-1519), who is generally considered as a painter only;\r\nbut we know that he made contracts for entire works in which sculpture\r\nand painting are combined, and must have had the oversight of the whole;\r\nand in this view it is proper to mention this master's name. The altars\r\nat Haller Cross Chapel, Nuremberg, one at Zwickau, another at Schwabach,\r\nand that of the Heilsbronn Monastery, near Nuremberg, are all ascribed\r\nto Wohlgemuth.\r\n\r\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471-1528), who was one of the great masters of the\r\nworld, was an architect, painter, and sculptor. He was a pupil of\r\nMichael Wohlgemuth, and sculpture was less practised by him than other\r\narts; yet the few works of his which remain are much valued.\r\n\r\nDürer probably executed his carvings about 1510-1520. In the British\r\nMuseum there is a relief of the Birth of St. John the Baptist, which was\r\npurchased in the Netherlands more than eighty years since for $2500. It\r\nis cut in a block of cream-colored stone, seven and one half by five and\r\none half inches in size, and is a wonderful work. The companion piece,\r\nwhich represents the same saint Preaching in the Wilderness, is in the\r\nBrunswick Museum, where there is also an \"Ecce Homo\" carved in wood.\r\n\r\nDürer executed many little carvings in stone, ivory, and boxwood, and\r\nthe existing ones are seen in various collections in Germany. It is\r\nquite probable that others are in private hands.\r\n\r\nThere are in Nuremberg many most excellent wood-carvings by unknown\r\nmasters; one who cares for this art is well repaid for a visit to this\r\nold city, and, indeed, this is true of other old German towns. Bamberg,\r\nMarburg, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Dortmund, Halle, and many other towns\r\nhave riches in this kind of art.\r\n\r\nThe stone sculpture of Germany in the fifteenth century was of less\r\nimportance than the wood-carving until toward the close of the period.\r\nThe exteriors of the churches and other edifices erected at this time\r\nhad but little sculptural ornament, and that consisted principally of\r\ntraceries and figures in geometric designs. Some small detached works,\r\nsuch as fonts, pulpits, or fountains, were made in stone, but the chief\r\nuse of stone sculpture was for monuments to the dead.\r\n\r\nADAM KRAFFT (about 1430-1507), of whose early history almost nothing is\r\nknown, is a very important master of this time, and his principal works\r\nadd another charm to the city of Nuremberg. A remarkable series of works\r\nby Krafft are the Seven Stages, or seven bas-reliefs placed on the way\r\nto the Johannis Cemetery, the designs representing the seven falls of\r\nChrist on his way to Golgotha.\r\n\r\nThese reliefs are much crowded, and the only part that is at all\r\nidealized is the figure of Christ; that is noble and calm in effect, and\r\nthe drapery is simple and dignified. The other figures are coarse and\r\ndressed like the Nurembergers of the time in which Krafft lived.\r\n\r\nIn the churches of St. Sebald and St. Laurence and in the Frauenkirche\r\nthere are other splendid works of Krafft, and in some dwelling-houses of\r\nNuremberg there are sculptures of his. A Madonna on the houses, 1306, in\r\nthe Hirschelgasse, is one of the finest, perhaps the very best in all\r\nGermany. We do not know whether this was by Krafft or not, but it has a\r\npurity and nobleness that scarcely any other German sculptor attained.\r\n\r\nThat Krafft had a sense of humor is shown by a bas-relief above the\r\nentrance to the Public Scales. The weigher stands observing the beam,\r\nand beneath it is written, \"To thyself as to others.\" Another man adds a\r\nweight to one scale, and the man who is to be taxed puts his hand into\r\nhis money-bag very reluctantly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his most artistic work was the tabernacle in the Church of St.\r\nLaurence. It is sixty-four feet high; the lower part is supported by the\r\nkneeling figures of Krafft and two of his associates. Above this rises a\r\nslender Gothic pyramid ornamented with bas-reliefs and statuettes. He\r\nwas employed upon this tabernacle from 1496 to 1500. It is believed that\r\na \"Burial of Christ,\" in the chapel of the Johannis Cemetery, was his\r\nlatest work, and executed in 1507, the year in which he died, in the\r\nhospital of Schwabach. Krafft led a most industrious life, and was so\r\nskilful a workman that he could work with his left hand as readily as\r\nwith his right.\r\n\r\nTILMAN RIEMENSCHNEIDER was an important sculptor, born at Osterode, in\r\nthe Hartz Mountains, probably about 1460. In 1483 he went to Würzburg,\r\nand was elected to one honorable office after another, until, in 1520,\r\nhe was head burgomaster. After the Peasants' War, in 1525, he was\r\ndeprived of his office; he lived but six years after this, and kept\r\nhimself in close retirement, not even practising his art.\r\n\r\nHis sculptures are mostly in stone, and are quite numerous in Würzburg\r\nand its vicinity. His monument to the Knight Eberhard von Grumbach, in\r\nthe church at Rimpar, was probably his earliest important work. In it he\r\nhas contrived to express strength and bravery of character in spite of\r\nthe stiff costume, every detail of which is worked out (Fig. 91).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--COUNT EBERHARD VON GRUMBACH. _Rimpar._]\r\n\r\nIn 1495 Riemenschneider received the important commission to erect in\r\nBamberg Cathedral a splendid monument to the Emperor Heinrich II. and\r\nhis wife Kunigunde. This occupied him until 1513, and is a splendid\r\nexample of his skill. The figures of the two royal personages lie upon a\r\nlarge sarcophagus; the statues are more than life-size, and are dressed\r\nin the fantastic costume of the fifteenth century. Upon the sides of the\r\nsarcophagus are five reliefs, representing as many scenes from the lives\r\nof the emperor and empress. The monuments and religious subjects\r\nexecuted by this sculptor are very numerous. In the church at Maidbrunn\r\nthere is a relief representing the \"Lamentation over the Dead Body of\r\nChrist,\" which is probably his latest work. It is cut from sandstone,\r\nand the figure of Nicodemus is believed to be the sculptor's own\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nWe give here four figures from the portal of the cathedral at Berne, in\r\nSwitzerland. The really splendid sculptures were the work of Nicolaus\r\nKünz, and from their style seem to belong to about 1520. They show the\r\ninfluence of such artists as the painters Nicolaus Manuel (1484-1531)\r\nand Hans Holbein (about 1459-1524). The statues of the Wise and Foolish\r\nVirgins are fine, and that of Justice, whose pose is full of grace, and\r\nwhose almost transparent garment is an exquisite work, affords an\r\nexcellent illustration of the most pleasing sculpture of this period\r\n(Figs. 92, 93).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--JUSTICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--THE THREE WISE VIRGINS.]\r\n\r\nAnother art, which had its headquarters at Nuremberg in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, is bronze-casting, and its chief master was the famous PETER\r\nVISCHER, who was the son of another brasier, HERMANN VISCHER. The date\r\nof Peter Vischer's birth is given as 1460, and he was admitted to be a\r\nmaster in his art in 1489. Five years later than this he was summoned to\r\nHeidelberg together with a sculptor, Simon Lamberger, to aid the Elector\r\nPhilip with advice and skill. Nothing is known of any work which Vischer\r\ndid there.\r\n\r\nVischer's foundry at Nuremberg enjoyed a great fame, and orders were\r\nsent to it from far and near. No doubt a great many monuments were cast\r\nhere which were not designed by Vischer at all. His works were numerous,\r\nbut I shall only describe his masterpiece, which was the shrine or tomb\r\nof St. Sebald, and occupied Peter Vischer from 1508 to 1519, he being\r\nassisted by his five sons. The son Peter was admitted as a master in the\r\nthimble trade in 1527. Hans was called \"the caster,\" and seems to have\r\nsuperintended the carving of models; Hermann went to Italy and brought\r\nhome designs and models; and Jacob and Paul seem to have had no special\r\ndepartments. Between 1495 and 1508 so little was recorded of Peter\r\nVischer that it leads to the belief that these years must have been\r\ngiven to study and to the improvement which the tomb of St. Sebald shows\r\nover the work of the monument to Archbishop Ernst, in the Magdeburg\r\nCathedral, which was done in 1495.\r\n\r\nThe bones of St. Sebald had been inclosed in a sarcophagus of the Middle\r\nAges, and the work required of Vischer was a fitting tomb for such\r\nprecious and honored relics, for St. Sebald is the special patron saint\r\nof Nuremberg, and dwelt in a cell near that city. His legend relates\r\nthat he was the son of a Danish king, who came to Germany as a\r\nmissionary and settled at Nuremberg, where he did many miraculous works\r\nof charity. On one occasion, during very cold weather, he is said to\r\nhave found a family nearly frozen and without fuel; he commanded them to\r\nbring the icicles hanging from the roof and make a fire of them. They\r\nobeyed, and were thus warmed. Many such wonders are told of him, and\r\nVischer in his statue makes him to appear as a pilgrim, with shell in\r\nhat, staff, rosary and wallet, while in his hand he holds a model of a\r\nchurch intended to represent that in which the tomb is erected. This\r\nChurch of St. Sebald is now used for the Lutheran service, and the\r\nshrine still stands in the centre of the choir. (Fig. 94.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--TOMB OF ST. SEBALD. _By Peter Vischer._\r\n_Nuremberg._]\r\n\r\nThe architecture of this remarkable work is of the richest style of\r\nGothic, and the whole of it is in bronze, except that the oaken\r\nsarcophagus is encased in silver plates. This rests beneath a fret-work\r\ncanopy supported on slender pillars. There is an abundance of ornament\r\neverywhere, but the close examination of its detail shows beauty and\r\nfitness in every part. For example, if we compare the statue of the\r\nsaint, of which we have spoken, which stands at the end of the shrine\r\nmost exposed, with the statue of Vischer himself, which is at the\r\nopposite end, we shall see how the saint, with his symbols and his\r\nflowing drapery, is an ideal work, and seems to be advancing with\r\nauthority and the air which befits the son of a king, while Vischer,\r\nwith his round cap, leather apron, and German face, is simply the\r\nrepresentation of a worker bent upon doing his best (Fig. 95).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--PETER VISCHER'S STATUE.]\r\n\r\nThe sarcophagus rests upon a base on which are four reliefs of scenes\r\nfrom the life of the saint, all in the purest manner of the time. One of\r\nthese represents the burning of the icicles recounted above (Fig. 96).\r\n\r\nThis base and sarcophagus and the fret-work above it form the centre of\r\nthe tomb. Then outside of this are eight pillars supporting a\r\nbaldachin, or canopy, in the richly ornamented Romanesque style, and the\r\ncombinations of the Gothic and the decorative architecture are so\r\nskilfully made as not to offend our taste. But it is generally\r\nacknowledged that the chief beauty of this work is the series of the\r\nfigures of the apostles, which are upon the pillars. They are slender in\r\nproportion, gracefully draped, and bear their distinctive symbols. They\r\nare perfectly free from the realism of the earlier works of Vischer, and\r\nhave more of the purity and nobleness of the works of Ghiberti than are\r\nseen in the statues of any other German artist of this age (Figs. 97,\r\n98).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--ST. SEBALD AND THE BURNING ICICLES. _Vischer._]\r\n\r\nAbove the apostles are figures of prophets and other Biblical\r\npersonages; Perseus and Hercules are also represented, and other statues\r\ntypify Strength, Justice, Prudence, and Moderation. The figure of the\r\nInfant Christ is upon the centre of the highest, or middle dome. Between\r\nthe pillars at their bases stand graceful candelabra, and the base\r\nitself rests upon snails. Besides all these principal figures there are\r\nalmost numberless others and many ornamental designs. There are\r\nharpies, sirens, satyrs, fawns, and all sorts of fantastic creatures.\r\nThe whole work is full of the deep feeling of the north and the beauty\r\nand richness of the south, and is a most remarkable production.\r\n\r\nWe are told that Vischer was but poorly paid for this labor, with all\r\nits thought and skill. He inscribed upon it these words: \"... He\r\ncompleted it for the praise of God Almighty alone, and for the honor of\r\nSt. Sebald, Prince of Heaven, by the aid of pious persons, paid by their\r\nvoluntary contributions.\" There is a satisfaction in remembering that\r\nVischer lived ten years after this tomb was completed, and must have\r\nheard many praises of his work.\r\n\r\nThe later works of Vischer were a few reliefs and two important\r\nmonuments at Aschaffenburg and Wittenberg. His sons Hans and Hermann\r\nexecuted a few monuments, which are done in the manner of their father,\r\nbut do not equal him in design or finish. There are numerous works which\r\nmust be regarded as productions of Vischer's studio and foundry of which\r\nwe cannot give clear accounts, not knowing whether they were the earlier\r\nworks of the father, or were executed by the sons or other pupils, of\r\nwhich he had many.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--PETER. _By Peter Vischer._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--JOHN. _By Peter Vischer._]\r\n\r\nPANKRAZ LABENWOLF was one of Vischer's pupils, and completed the\r\nsplendid lattice-work over the Town-hall which the master left\r\nunfinished; Labenwolf added some ornaments and coats-of-arms to it. In\r\n1550 he cast the fountain in the court-yard of the same building, which\r\nis a graceful and creditable work; but another fountain in the vegetable\r\nmarket, behind the Frauenkirche, is truly original; the water flows from\r\nthe mouths of two geese held under the arms of a peasant; the whole\r\neffect is droll and unique (Fig. 99).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--MAN AND GEESE. _By Labenwolf._]\r\n\r\nYou will remember how, about 1390, Claux Sluter, by his works in Dijon,\r\nhad a great influence upon French sculpture. A century and more later\r\nthis art in France was largely under the influence of Italian masters,\r\nwho had been called into France by Francis I. and other patrons of art.\r\nSplendid works of sculpture were also imported from Italy, and the\r\neffect of the Italian Renaissance, which was so plainly seen upon the\r\npainting of France, was also at work upon its sculpture.\r\n\r\nWhere the sculptures were a part of an architectural decoration, as in\r\nthe case of the choir screen in the cathedral at Amiens, and other like\r\nworks, the change was not as complete as in cases where the work was one\r\nof independent sculpture, as in monuments and statues to commemorate the\r\ndead, or in portrait sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe wealth and power of the nobility of France at this period enabled\r\nthem to gratify their desire to leave fine monuments of themselves, in\r\norder to keep their names in memory in future centuries. In these the\r\nItalian manner was adopted, and the works when completed were far more\r\nsplendid and elegant than were the corresponding works in Germany. But\r\nthey have a grave fault, which makes them much less interesting than are\r\nthe German sculptures: they are more conventional, less expressive, and\r\nfar less artistic in spirit. They impress one as if the soft, luxurious\r\ncourt atmosphere had passed over them, and taking away their strong\r\npoints, had left them only a general air of being well-bred and\r\nwell-kept persons, of little importance to the real life of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the Louvre, in the Museum of Modern Sculpture, all this change can be\r\ntraced, and the traveller in France may see such monuments as we refer\r\nto in all the cathedrals and most of the churches all over the country.\r\nMany of them cannot be traced to any one master. A fine specimen is the\r\nAmboise Monument in Rouen Cathedral, which is said to have been the work\r\nof one Roulland de Roux and his assistants.\r\n\r\nJEAN JUSTE of Tours was one of the best French artists of his day. In\r\nthe Cathedral of Tours is a monument to two young children of Charles\r\nVIII., which proves him to have had much delicacy and tenderness of\r\nexecution. The sarcophagus is covered with graceful designs, and on the\r\nlid lie the two babies, for the eldest was but three years old. The\r\nwhole work is exquisite, and gives one a feeling of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAbout 1530 Juste erected the splendid monument to Louis XII. and Anne of\r\nBrittany in the Church of St. Denis. While the general form of the\r\nmonument is much like that of the Visconti in the Certosa at Pavia, the\r\nfigures of the dead couple are quite different from the Italian manner.\r\nBelow on a bier the two nude bodies are stretched in all the realism\r\npossible, and the heads are noble and touching in expression. Above, on\r\nthe upper part of the monument, where in Italy the patron saint or some\r\nother figure usually is placed, the king and queen again appear; they\r\nare kneeling, with full drapery about them, while the faces are\r\ncharacteristic and very expressive. This monument, taken all in all, is\r\nin the perfection of the French art of the time. Another work by Juste\r\nnow in the Louvre is the monument to Louis de Poncher, one of the\r\nministers of Francis I., and his wife, Roberta. These statues are in\r\nalabaster, and were formerly in the Church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois,\r\nwhich was built by Poncher.\r\n\r\nPIERRE BONTEMPS must have been a famous sculptor, as he was chosen to\r\nerect the monument to Francis I., his wife Claude and their three\r\nchildren. This is also at St. Denis, and is even more grand than that to\r\nLouis XII. On the upper platform the five figures are kneeling; they are\r\nnoble and simple, with an air of great repose. These examples serve to\r\ngive an idea of the religious sculpture of the time.\r\n\r\nSecular subjects were unusual. A house in Bourges is decorated with the\r\nfigures of the master and mistress above the entrance, as if they would\r\nspeak a welcome, while reliefs of industrial scenes, such as might be\r\nseen outside and inside of the house, are placed in various positions\r\nover the building and in the court-yard. Something of a like sort is\r\nupon the Hotel Bourgtheroulde at Rouen, where the friezes show scenes\r\nbetween Francis I. and Henry VIII. Biblical scenes are also distributed\r\nover the building.\r\n\r\nBruges is almost the only city of the Netherlands that has any\r\nsculptures of this period of which one would speak. Just at this time\r\nthe art of that country was painting preeminently, and the Van Eycks and\r\ntheir followers had done such things as held the attention of all to the\r\nneglect of other arts. At Bruges in the cathedral, the Church of St.\r\nJacques, and the Liebfrauenkirche there are some fine monuments, and the\r\nPalais de Justice has a carved chimney-piece which is magnificent, and\r\na work of the highest rank.\r\n\r\nIn England sculpture was of less account even than in the Netherlands.\r\nOne circumstance is worthy of notice. Pietro Torrigiano, after\r\nquarrelling with Michael Angelo and breaking his nose, fled to England,\r\nand his monument of Henry VII. and his queen in Westminster Abbey,\r\nerected in 1519, marks the introduction of the style of the Italian\r\nRenaissance into England. The structure is of black marble; the statues\r\nof the king and queen are in gilt bronze, and are grandly noble in\r\ndesign and finished in execution. The smaller figures and all the\r\ndetails of the monument are fine. The master received £1000 for this\r\nwork. Torrigiano executed other works, and entered into an agreement to\r\nmake a monument to Henry VIII. and Catherine of Aragon, but for some\r\nreason he went to Spain in 1519 and never returned, as he was destroyed\r\nby the Inquisition three years later.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Torrigiano may have been led to Spain by hearing of\r\nthe revival of art which was taking place there. Flemish and Italian\r\nartists went there, and the influence of their styles was felt by the\r\nnative masters. The result was that they brought forth a manner of their\r\nown, combining certain features of northern and of southern art, and\r\nused to express the thoughts of the Spaniards themselves. The carved\r\naltars of Seville, Toledo, and Burgos show how splendid this art was;\r\nand though we cannot trace the lives and works of Spanish sculptors as\r\nwe should like to do, we can be sure that there were men among them\r\nequal to any demand that could be made upon decorative sculptors.\r\n\r\nThis is proved by the portals and fronts of the churches, by the highly\r\nornamented chapels, the wall niches and choir screens of the interiors,\r\nwhile the monuments are also equal to those of other nations. That of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella in the Church of the Guardian Angel, at Granada,\r\nis noble and magnificent. It is believed to have been erected before the\r\ndeath of Ferdinand in 1516, and was probably the work of an Italian\r\nsculptor. This monument has a large marble sarcophagus, with a structure\r\nabove it in the Renaissance style. At the corners of the sarcophagus\r\nthere are griffins of excellent workmanship, and on the sides reliefs\r\nand statuettes of the Four Fathers of the Church; on the lid repose the\r\nfigures of the royal pair, executed in a grand and dignified\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nITALIAN SCULPTURE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY--CELLINI, MICHAEL ANGELO, AND\r\nOTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the sixteenth century sculpture occupied a different\r\nplace with relation to architecture from that which it had held in the\r\nprevious centuries which we have just considered. The architecture of\r\nItaly became much more plain, and its union with sculpture in any large\r\ndegree was rare.\r\n\r\nPainting, too, had now an effect to lessen the sphere of sculpture. This\r\nart was always preferred by the Christians, as has been shown before,\r\nand now, when it had reached most satisfactory heights, it was used in\r\nmany places where sculpture had before been placed. One important\r\nexample of this is seen in the decoration of altars; where bas-reliefs\r\nhad been used paintings were now preferred, and the end of all was that\r\nsculpture was limited to monuments and to separate pieces--reliefs or\r\nsingle statues or groups of figures.\r\n\r\nIn some ways this separation of the arts was a benefit to all. Under the\r\nold rule sculptors had often been forced to sacrifice their design to\r\nthe needs of the architecture their work adorned. At other times they\r\nwere compelled to put aside their own feeling and their artistic ideas\r\nas to how a subject should be treated, and suit themselves to such forms\r\nas were approved by the particular priest or bishop whose church they\r\ndecorated. Now, when left to itself, sculpture became more individual\r\nin its expression, and far more free and interesting in itself. In the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century the works of Italian sculpture were\r\nsplendid in the extreme. It was delicate and beautiful; the drapery was\r\nmade to show the figure and its natural motion, while it added an\r\nexquisite grace to the whole; many works of this period were fine in\r\nconception, good in their arrangement, and executed in a noble, spirited\r\nmanner. Some critics believe that during the first four decades of this\r\nera Italian sculpture equalled the antique art of the Romans. Others\r\nmake 1520, or the time of Raphael, the limit to the best epoch of this\r\nart; but it is scarcely possible thus to fix an exact bound; the\r\nimportant point is that this excellence was reached, and the regret\r\nfollows that it could not endure for a longer period.\r\n\r\nA far greater variety of subjects was represented in this age of\r\nsculpture than before. Formerly the rule was the production of religious\r\neffects. Scenes from the life of Christ and his disciples, others from\r\nthose of the saints, or the illustration of scriptural stories, with the\r\nportrait tomb-sculpture, had been the sculptor's work. Now all the\r\nstories of mythology were studied as diligently as they had been in\r\nclassic days, and artists studied to clothe the pagan personages with\r\nnew forms; and in all this effort much appeared that was original. It is\r\neasy to see that such sculpture from the hand of a Christian artist must\r\nlack the important element of pure sincerity. An artist who believed in\r\nJesus Christ could not conceive a statue of Jupiter, with all the\r\nglorious attributes, that an ancient Greek would have given to his god\r\nof gods. In this view the sculpture of classic subjects of this\r\nsixteenth century may be said to have been two-sided--the work\r\nillustrated a religion in which the artist pleased his imagination, but\r\nfor which he had no reverence or love. But in spite of all it was a\r\ngolden age, and many of its works are a \"joy forever.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100. PHARISEE.\r\nFIG. 101. LEVITE. _By Rustici._]\r\n\r\nAlthough the first public work which Leonardo Da Vinci did at Milan was\r\nto model an equestrian statue, we can scarcely speak of him as a\r\nsculptor. But the first Florentine of this period whom I shall mention\r\nis GIOVANNI FRANCESCO RUSTICI (1476-1550), who was a fellow-pupil with\r\nLeonardo under Verocchio. Very few works by this master remain, but a\r\nprominent and important one is the bronze group above the northern\r\nportal to the baptistery at Florence. It represents the \"preaching of\r\nSt. John The Baptist,\" and is grand in the free action of its figures.\r\nThe Drapery is in a pure style, very much like that of Ghiberti (figs.\r\n100, 101). This work was ordered by a guild of merchants, and they\r\nfailed to pay the price which had been fixed for it. Rustici was so\r\nembarrassed by this that he undertook no more large works, and after the\r\nMedici were expelled from florence he went into the service of Francis\r\nI. in France he had executed various works, and was finally commissioned\r\nto model an equestrian statue of the king in colossal size, when the\r\nsovereign died. Rustici survived but three years, and we are told that\r\nhe only executed small works, and those \"for the most part for the sake\r\nof kindness.\"\r\n\r\nANDREA CONTUCCI DAL MONTE SAN SAVINO, called SANSOVINO (1460-1529), was\r\na very important sculptor, because large works were committed to him,\r\nand his name must remain associated with them. Like Giotto, Sansovino\r\nwas a shepherd-boy, and drew pictures upon the stones of the fields.\r\nLike Giotto, too, he was sent to Florence to study, and in the school of\r\nPallajuolo made good progress. When thirty years old he was appointed\r\narchitect and sculptor to the King of Portugal. After an absence of ten\r\nyears he returned to Florence, and later to Rome, where Pope Julius II.\r\ncommissioned him to erect monuments to the Cardinals Rovere and Sforza,\r\nin the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.\r\n\r\nThese monuments were his best works, but they cannot be praised. The\r\nstatues are in positions which seem to be uncomfortable, and there is\r\nsuch a mass of ornament and so many statuettes that the whole has an\r\neffect of confusion.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 Leo X. sent Sansovino to Loreto to adorn the temple which\r\nincloses the \"Casa Santa\" with bas-reliefs. This Casa Santa is believed\r\nto be the house in which the Virgin Mary was born at Nazareth; and when\r\nthe Saracens invaded the land four angels are said to have borne the\r\nhouse to the coast of Dalmatia, and later to a spot near Loreto; but\r\nhere some brigands entered it, and again it was removed to its present\r\nposition in the Church of Loreto; this is said to have been done in\r\n1295. Naturally this \"Casa Santa\" is a sacred object to all Roman\r\nCatholics, and it is visited by thousands and thousands of pilgrims each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of this shrine was very important, and an honorable work\r\nfor any artist. Sansovino did not execute all the reliefs, and the\r\nhighest praise that can be given to those he did is to say that they are\r\nsuperior to the others that are beside them. He was a most skilful\r\nworkman, and it seems as if marble became like wax under his hand; but\r\nthis very skill led him to multiply his ornaments, and to repeat\r\nacanthus leaves and honeysuckle vines until the whole was a weariness\r\nand confusion, and conveyed no meaning or sentiment whatever.\r\n\r\nSansovino's most important pupil was JACOPO TATTI, who, on account of\r\nhis master, is called JACOPO SANSOVINO (1477-1570). He was born at\r\nFlorence, and when Andrea Sansovino returned from Portugal Jacopo became\r\nhis pupil. Early in life he went to Rome, and there studied and copied\r\nthe works of antiquity; among other things he made a copy of the\r\nLaocoon, which was cast in bronze at a later time. Soon after his return\r\nto Florence, in 1511, Jacopo received orders for some works, but the\r\nmost important statue which he made about this time is the Bacchus, now\r\nin the Uffizi. In this work he showed how completely he was in sympathy\r\nwith the classic spirit; this Bacchus is a triumph in this manner, and\r\nhas been called \"the most beautiful and spirited pagan statue of the\r\nRenaissance period.\" It is full of gladness, and is simple, delicate,\r\nand beautiful. The young god is advancing and holding up a cup, which he\r\nregards with an expression of delight; in his right hand he has a bunch\r\nof grapes, from which a Pan is eating stealthily (Fig. 102).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--BACCHUS.\r\n_By Jacopo Sansovino._]\r\n\r\nIn 1514 Jacopo Sansovino was employed upon the decorations for the visit\r\nof Leo X. to Florence. Soon after this he went again to Rome and\r\nsubmitted plans for the Church of San Giovanni de' Fiorentini, which the\r\nFlorentines were about to erect--for this master was an architect as\r\nwell as a sculptor. The taking of Rome by Constable de Bourbon, in 1527,\r\ndrove Sansovino away; he went to Venice, intending to go to France, but\r\nVenice charmed him, and his work pleased the Venetians, and the result\r\nwas that from 1529 he served the Venetians as long as he lived. He was\r\nappointed Protomastro of the Republic of Venice, and had the care of St.\r\nMark's, the Campanile, the Piazza, and the surrounding buildings. He\r\nreceived a good salary, and was provided with a handsome house to live\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHe first restored the cupolas of St. Mark's; then completed the Scuola\r\ndella Misericordia; he next made the interior of San Francesco della\r\nVigna; then the Zecca, the Fabbriche Nuove, and the Loggietta of the\r\nCampanile. He also erected other churches and palaces, besides smaller\r\nsculptural works. But his architectural masterpiece was the Library of\r\nSt. Mark's. The bronze gate to the Sacristy of St. Mark's was one of his\r\nprincipal works. It is subject to criticism as being too crowded; but it\r\nis a fine work and full of strong feeling.\r\n\r\nHis statues are numerous and seen all over Venice; indeed, it is proper\r\nto speak of him as a Venetian, so thoroughly did he adopt that city, and\r\nso industriously did he work for it during forty years. Had he remained\r\nin Florence he might have been a better artist; the splendor and luxury\r\nof the Venetians brought out corresponding traits in Jacopo, and he fell\r\nshort of the purity which the influence of Florence might have given\r\nhim. He is one of the masters in whom the sensual influence of the study\r\nof pagan art was fully manifested. Many of his subjects were\r\nmythological; among them were the story of Phrixos and Helle, Mercury,\r\nApollo, Pallas, Mars, and Neptune, the last two being colossal figures\r\non the steps of the Doge's Palace.\r\n\r\nAmong the pupils and associates of Sansovino were NICCOLO BRACCINI\r\n(1485-1550), called IL TRIBOLO, and FRANCESCO SANGALLO (1498-1570),\r\nneither of whom were important artists, though many works by them are\r\nseen in various places in Italy.\r\n\r\nBENVENUTO CELLINI (1500-1572) is a far more interesting study than were\r\nmany sculptors of his time. His life was an eventful one, and his own\r\naccount of it is one of the most interesting books of its class in\r\nexistence. His statement of the origin of his family is that \"Julius\r\nCæsar had a chief and valorous captain named Fiorino da Cellino, from a\r\ncastle situated four miles from Monte Fiascone. This Fiorino having\r\npitched his camp below Fiesole, where Florence now stands, in order to\r\nbe near the river Arno, for the convenience of the army, the soldiers\r\nand other persons, when they had the occasion to visit him, said to each\r\nother, 'Let us go to Fiorenza,' which name they gave to the place where\r\nthey were encamped, partly from their captain's name of Fiorino, and\r\npartly from the abundance of flowers which grew there; wherefore Cæsar,\r\nthinking it a beautiful name, and considering flowers to be of good\r\naugury, and also wishing to honor his captain, whom he had raised from\r\nan humble station, and to whom he was greatly attached, gave it to the\r\ncity which he founded on that spot.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this artist was born his father was quite old, and named him\r\nBenvenuto, which means welcome, on account of his pleasure in the child\r\nof his old age. The father had a passion for music, and from the first\r\nwished that his son should study this art; but the boy loved drawing,\r\nand was determined to be an artist; thus his time was divided between\r\nthese two pursuits until he was fifteen years old, when he was\r\napprenticed to a goldsmith.\r\n\r\nBenvenuto had a fiery temper, and when still very young he became\r\ninvolved in so serious a quarrel that he was obliged to flee from\r\nFlorence. He went first to Siena, and thence to Bologna, and at last\r\nback to Florence, where he resumed his work. It was not long, however,\r\nbefore he became angry again because his best clothes were given to his\r\nbrother, and he walked off to Pisa, where he remained a year. He had\r\neven then become so skilful in his art that some of his works done there\r\nhave never been excelled either in design or execution.\r\n\r\nWhen Cellini was eighteen years old Torrigiano came to Florence to\r\nengage artists to go to England to aid him in some works he was to\r\nexecute. He wished to have Cellini in the number; but Torrigiano so\r\ndisgusted Benvenuto by his boasting of the blow that he had given\r\nMichael Angelo, that though he had the natural youthful desire to\r\ntravel, he refused to be employed by such a man as Torrigiano. We can\r\nsafely assume that this predisposed Michael Angelo in Cellini's favor,\r\nand was the foundation of the friendship which he afterward showed to\r\nthe younger sculptor.\r\n\r\nFrom his eighteenth to his fortieth year Cellini lived mostly at Rome.\r\nHe was employed by Pope Clement VII., the cardinals and Roman nobles.\r\nThe Pope desired to have a cope button made and a magnificent diamond\r\nset in it. This jewel had cost Julius II. thirty-six thousand ducats.\r\nMany artists sent in designs for this button, and Clement chose that by\r\nCellini. He used the diamond as a throne, and placed a figure of the\r\nAlmighty upon it; the hand was raised as if in blessing, and many angels\r\nfluttered about the folds of the drapery, while various jewels were set\r\naround the whole. When other artists saw the design they did not believe\r\nthat it could be executed successfully; but Cellini made it a perfect\r\nwork of art and of beauty.\r\n\r\nCellini writes of himself as being very active in the siege of Rome, May\r\n5th, 1527. He says that he killed the Constable de Bourbon, who led the\r\nsiege, and that he wounded the Prince of Orange, who was chosen in\r\nBourbon's place. No one else saw him perform these feats. Cellini went\r\nto the Pope, who was in the Castle of St. Angelo, and he there rendered\r\nsuch services to the cause of the Church that the Holy Father pardoned\r\nhim for all the sins into which his temper had led him--\"for all the\r\nhomicides he had committed or might commit in the service of the\r\nApostolic Church.\" A few years later, when Cellini was called upon to\r\ntake part in the defence of his own city, he put all his property into\r\nthe care of a friend, and stole away to Rome.\r\n\r\nIn 1534 Cellini killed a fellow-goldsmith, called Pompeo; Paul III. was\r\nnow Pope; and as he needed the services of Benvenuto very much he\r\npardoned him. But the sculptor felt that he was in ill favor with all\r\nabout him, and went to France. In about a year he returned to find that\r\nhe had been accused of stealing some jewels which the pope had commanded\r\nhim to take out of their settings. Cellini was held a prisoner nearly\r\ntwo years, but his guilt was never proved.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time the Cardinal Ippolito d'Este obtained his\r\nrelease in order that he might go to France to execute some work for\r\nFrancis I. Cellini remained in France five years, and received many\r\nhonors and gifts; but as Madame d'Étampes and other persons to whose\r\nadvice the king listened were enemies of Cellini, he never was treated\r\nas his artistic qualities merited. Francis I. really admired Cellini,\r\nand presented him with the Hôtel de Petit Nesle, which was on the site\r\nof the present Hôtel de la Monnaie; he also made him a lord, and on one\r\noccasion expressed his fear of losing him, when Madame d'Étampes\r\nreplied, \"The surest way of keeping him would be to hang him on a\r\ngibbet.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the objects which Cellini made during his five years in France\r\nbut two remain. One is a splendid salt-cellar, and the other is a nymph\r\nin bronze, which was made for the Palace of Fontainebleau, and is now in\r\nthe Renaissance Museum of the Louvre. This salt-cellar is now in the\r\nAmbraser Gallery at Vienna. The frieze around the base has figures in\r\nrelief which represent the hours of the day and the winds. The upper\r\npart is made like the surface of the sea, and from it rise figures of\r\nNeptune and Cybele. The first is a symbol of the salt of the sea, and\r\nthe second of the spices which the earth gives. The god is placing his\r\narm on a small ship intended for the salt, and a vessel for pepper, in\r\nthe form of a triumphal arch, is near the goddess. All this is made of\r\nfine embossed gold, and has some touches of enamel-work. It is one of\r\nthe finest pieces of the goldsmith's art which remains from the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1545 Cellini returned to Florence, and remained there, with short\r\nabsences, until his death. Duke Cosmo de' Medici became his patron, and\r\ncommissioned him to make a statue of Perseus for the Loggia de' Lanzi.\r\nThe ambition of the artist was much excited by the thought of having his\r\nwork placed by those of Donatello and Michael Angelo, and all care was\r\ntaken from his mind, as the Duke provided him with a comfortable house\r\nand gave him a salary sufficient for his support.\r\n\r\nIt was nine years before the statue was completed and in its place, and\r\nin this time Cellini had suffered much. Baccio Bandinelli and others\r\nwere his enemies, and at times the Duke had been under their influence,\r\nand would not furnish the money necessary to the work. But at last all\r\nwas ready for the casting; and just at this unfortunate moment for\r\nCellini to leave it he was seized with a severe illness; he was\r\nsuffering much, and believed himself about to die, when some one ran in\r\nshouting, \"Oh, Benvenuto, your work is ruined past earthly remedy!\"\r\n\r\nIll as he was he rushed out to the furnace, to find that the fire was\r\ntoo low, and the metal, being cool, had ceased flowing into the mould.\r\nBy almost superhuman efforts he remedied the evil, and again the bronze\r\nflowed; he prayed earnestly, and when the mould was filled he writes: \"I\r\nfell on my knees and thanked God with all my heart, after which I ate a\r\nhearty meal with my assistants, and it being then two hours before dawn,\r\nwent to bed with a light heart, and slept as sweetly as if I had never\r\nbeen ill in all my life.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the statue was unveiled Cellini's prediction that it would please\r\nall the world except Bandinelli and his friends was fulfilled. Perseus\r\nis represented just at the moment when he has cut off the head of\r\nMedusa, who was one of the Gorgons, and had turned to stone every one\r\nwho looked at her. (Fig. 103.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--PERSEUS. _By Benvenuto Cellini._]\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the Perseus, Cellini went to Rome for a short\r\ntime. While there he made a bust of Bindo Altoviti; when Michael Angelo\r\nsaw this he wrote: \"My Benvenuto, I have long known you as the best\r\ngoldsmith in the world, and I now know you as an equally good sculptor,\r\nthrough the bust of Messer Bindo Altoviti.\" Cellini did no more\r\nimportant works, though he was always industrious. He made a crucifix\r\nwhich he intended for his own grave, but he gave it to the Duchess\r\nEleanora; this was afterward sent to Philip II. of Spain, and is now in\r\nthe Escurial.\r\n\r\nCellini's life was by no means a model one, but he had his good\r\nqualities. He took a widowed sister with six children to his home, and\r\nmade them welcome and happy. At his death he was buried in the Church of\r\nthe Annunziata, beneath the chapel of the Company of St. Luke, and many\r\nhonors were paid to his memory.\r\n\r\nHis autobiography was so rich in its use of the Florentine manner of\r\nspeech and so fine in its diction that it was honored as an authority by\r\nthe Accademia della Crusca. He also wrote valuable works on the\r\ngoldsmith's art and on bronze-casting and sculpture. He wrote poems and\r\nvarious kinds of verses, but his large acquaintance with popes,\r\ncardinals, kings, artists, and men of letters makes his story of his\r\nlife far more interesting than his other writings.\r\n\r\nThe artists of Upper Italy were much influenced by Florentine art, as\r\nthey had formerly been, and we can speak of no very great sculptor of\r\nthis century who belonged to this part of the country. ALFONSO LOMBARDO\r\n(1488-1537) was a native of Lucca; his principal works are seen in\r\nFerrara, Bologna, and Cesena.\r\n\r\nPROPERZIA DE' ROSSI (1490-1530) was born at Bologna, and is interesting\r\nas the one Italian sculptress of that time. She was born about a year\r\nafter her father had returned from the galleys, where he had worked out\r\na sentence of eighteen years for the crime of manslaughter. Properzia\r\nseems to have inherited her father's violent temper, and was twice\r\narraigned in court. She was very beautiful in person, and had a devoted\r\nlover in Antonio Galeazzo Malvasia de' Bottigari, who did not marry\r\nuntil many years after the death of Properzia.\r\n\r\nProperzia studied drawing under Marc Antonio Raimondi, the famous\r\nengraver. She first devoted herself to the cutting of intaglios, which\r\ndemanded an immense amount of patient labor. There is in the cabinet of\r\ngems in the Uffizi Gallery, at Florence, a cherry-stone carved by\r\nProperzia, on which sixty heads may be counted; the subject is a Glory\r\nof Saints. Other like works of hers exist in the Palazzo Grassi, in\r\nBologna. Her next work was in arabesques, marble ornaments, lions,\r\ngriffins, vases, eagles, and similar objects.\r\n\r\nFinally she essayed a bust of Count Guido Pepoli; it is now in the\r\nSacristy of San Petronio, in Bologna. In the same place are two\r\nbas-reliefs by her hand, Solomon receiving the Queen of Sheba, and\r\nJoseph and Potiphar's Wife. In the chapel Zambeccari in San Petronio\r\nthere are two large figures of angels by Properzia, which are near the\r\nAscension of the Virgin by Il Tribolo. Her manner was much influenced by\r\nher contact with this sculptor. Properzia was employed, with other\r\nartists, to finish the sculpture of the portal of San Petronio, left\r\nunfinished by Jacopo della Quercia.\r\n\r\nANTONIO BEGARELLI (1499-1565), called also ANTONIO DA MODENA, from the\r\nplace of his birth, was a celebrated modeller in clay. It is said that\r\nwhen Michael Angelo visited Modena in 1529 he saw Begarelli and his\r\nworks, and exclaimed, \"Alas for the statues of the ancients, if this\r\nclay were changed to marble!\" Begarelli had a school for teaching design\r\nand modelling, and he greatly influenced the manner of the Lombard\r\nschool of painting. Its foreshortening, its relief and grace are largely\r\ndue to him and his teaching.\r\n\r\nBegarelli and Correggio were fast friends, and resembled each other in\r\ntheir conception of the grand and beautiful. When Correggio was\r\ndecorating the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma, Begarelli was at work\r\nin the same place, and made many models from which Correggio painted his\r\nfloating figures. Some works by Begarelli may be seen in the Berlin\r\nMuseum. His Descent from the Cross, in the Church of San Francesco, at\r\nModena, is one of his best works. He was also employed in the Church of\r\nSan Benedetto, in Mantua, and in San Giovanni, at Parma.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century the works at the Certosa at Pavia and in\r\nvarious edifices in Milan were constantly carried on. Frequently the\r\nsame sculptors worked in both cities, but there is no one artist of\r\ngreat excellence among them of whom we can give an account. The same is\r\ntrue of the works in Venice and in Southern Italy. The traveller sees\r\nmany pieces of sculpture belonging to this period, but there are no\r\ngreat and interesting men whose story we can tell in connection with\r\nthem, and I shall now pass to an account of the great Florentine.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI (1475-1564) was born in the Castle of Caprese,\r\nwhere his father, Ludovico Buonarroti, was stationed at that time,\r\nholding the office of Podesta, or Governor, of the towns of Caprese and\r\nChiusi. The Buonarroti family held good rank in Florence, and the mother\r\nof the great artist was also a woman of good position. When his father\r\nreturned to Florence the child Michael was left at Settignano upon an\r\nestate of the family, and was in the care of the wife of a stone-mason.\r\nAs soon as the boy could use his hands he drew pictures everywhere that\r\nit was possible, and his nurse could show many of these childish\r\ndrawings with which he adorned the walls of her house.\r\n\r\nAt a proper time Michael Angelo was removed to Florence and placed in a\r\nschool, where he became intimate with Francesco Granacci, who was a\r\npupil of the artist Ghirlandajo. Michael Angelo's father and his uncles\r\nwere firmly opposed to his being an artist; they wished him to follow\r\nthe traditions of his family, and carry on the silk and woollen trade.\r\nBut the boy was firm in his determination, and after many trials was at\r\nlength, in 1488, apprenticed to the Ghirlandaji for three years.\r\n\r\nDomenico Ghirlandajo was at this time engaged in the restoration of the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria Novella, and Michael Angelo came into the midst of\r\ngreat artistic works. One day at the dinner hour he drew a picture of\r\nthe scaffolding and all its belongings, with the men at work on it; it\r\nwas a remarkable drawing for a boy, and when the master saw it he\r\nexclaimed, \"He understands more than I do myself!\" The master really\r\nbecame jealous of his pupil, more especially when Michael Angelo\r\ncorrected the drawings which Ghirlandajo gave his scholars for models.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Michael Angelo was brought to the notice of Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici, who was at that time at the head of the government of Florence,\r\nand from him the boy-artist obtained admission for himself and Granacci\r\nto study in the gardens of San Marco. The art treasures of the Medici\r\nwere placed in these gardens; works of sculpture were there, and\r\ncartoons and pictures were hung in buildings erected for the purpose,\r\nand art-students were admitted to study there and proper instructors\r\nprovided for them.\r\n\r\nThe master in sculpture was old Bertoldo, and Michael Angelo, forsaking\r\npainting, obtained some instruments and a piece of marble, and copied a\r\nmask of a faun. He changed his own work somewhat from the model, and\r\nopened the mouth so that the teeth could be seen. When Lorenzo saw this\r\nhe praised the work, but said, \"You have made your faun old, and yet you\r\nhave left all his teeth; you should have known that at such an age there\r\nare generally some teeth wanting.\" When he came again he saw that a gap\r\nhad been made in the teeth, and so well done that he was delighted. This\r\nwork is now in the Uffizi Gallery.\r\n\r\nVery soon Lorenzo sent for Michael Angelo's father, who had been sad\r\nenough at the thought that his son might be a painter, and was now in\r\ndespair when he found that he inclined also to be a stone-mason. At\r\nfirst he refused to see the duke, but Granacci persuaded him to go. He\r\nwent with a firm determination to yield to nothing, but once in presence\r\nof Lorenzo he yielded everything, and returned home declaring that not\r\nonly Michael, but he himself, and all that he had were at the nobleman's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nLorenzo at once took Michael Angelo into his palace; he clothed the boy\r\nproperly, and gave him five ducats a month for spending money. Each day\r\nLorenzo gave an entertainment, and it was the rule that the first person\r\nwho came should sit next the duke at the head of the table. Michael\r\nAngelo often had this place, and he soon became a great favorite with\r\nLorenzo, and obtained besides the greatest advantages from the life in\r\nthe palace; for many eminent men from all parts of the world came to\r\nvisit there, and all sorts of subjects were discussed in such a manner\r\nthat a young man could learn much of the world and what was in it, and\r\nacquire a feeling of ease with strangers and in society such as few\r\nyoung persons possess.\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo was but seventeen years old when Poliziano advised him to\r\nattempt an original work, and gave him the marble for a relief of the\r\ncontest between Hercules and the Centaurs. This work surprised every\r\none, and is still preserved in the collection of the Buonarroti family.\r\nIn the year 1492 he also made a relief of the Madonna Suckling the Child\r\nJesus, which is also in the same place. In the same year Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici died, and Michael Angelo, full of grief, went to his father's\r\nhouse and arranged a studio there. After a time Piero de Medici invited\r\nhim to come back to the palace, and he went; but it was no more the\r\nsame place as formerly, and he was unhappy there. Soon political\r\ntroubles drove the Medici from power, and in 1494, in the midst of the\r\nconfusion, Michael Angelo escaped to Venice. There he made friends with\r\nGian Francesco Aldovrandi of Bologna, and was persuaded by that nobleman\r\nto accompany him to his own city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--MICHAEL ANGELO'S ANGEL. _Bologna._]\r\n\r\nWhile at Bologna he executed an angel holding a candelabra, which is one\r\nof the most lovely and pleasing things he ever made (Fig. 104). When he\r\nreceived the commission to ornament the sarcophagus which contained the\r\nremains of San Domenico in the Church of San Petronio, the Bolognese\r\nartists were so angry at being thus set aside for a stranger, and a\r\nyouth of twenty, that they threatened vengeance on him, and he returned\r\nto Florence.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that he executed a Cupid, which was the means of\r\nleading him to Rome. The story is that when he had the statue completed\r\nLorenzo de' Medici, a relative of his first patron, advised him to give\r\nit the appearance of an antique marble, and added that he would then\r\nsell it in Rome and get a good price for it. Michael Angelo consented to\r\nthis plan, and in the end he received thirty ducats for the work. The\r\nsecret of its origin was not kept, and the cardinal who had bought it\r\nsent an agent to Florence to find out the truth about it. This agent\r\npretended to be in search of a sculptor; and when he saw Michael Angelo\r\nhe asked him what works he had done. When he mentioned a Sleeping Cupid,\r\nand the agent asked questions, the young sculptor found that the\r\ncardinal had paid two hundred ducats for it, and that he had been\r\ngreatly deceived when attempting to deceive others.\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo consented to go to Rome with this man, who promised to\r\nreceive him into his own house, and assured him that he would be fully\r\noccupied in the Eternal City. The oldest writing by the hand of Michael\r\nAngelo is the letter which he wrote to Lorenzo telling him of his\r\narrival in Rome; when this was written he was twenty-one years old. The\r\nfirst work which he did after he reached Rome was the \"Drunken Bacchus,\"\r\nnow in the Uffizi Gallery; it shows a great knowledge of anatomy in one\r\nso young, and the expression of drunkenness is given in the most natural\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--PIETÀ. _By Michael Angelo._]\r\n\r\nBut the work that established his fame as a great sculptor is the Pietà,\r\nnow in St. Peter's at Rome (Fig. 105). He was twenty-five years old when\r\nhe executed this work, and from that time was acknowledged to be the\r\ngreatest sculptor of Italy--a decision which has never been reversed.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Michael Angelo returned to Florence, and his first\r\nimportant work was a Madonna, now at Bruges; it is life-size, and one of\r\nhis finest sculptures. There was at this time an immense block of marble\r\nwhich had lain many years in the yard to the workshops of the cathedral.\r\nSeveral sculptors had talked of making something from it, and now\r\nMichael Angelo was asked by the consuls to make something good of it. He\r\nhad just taken an order for fifteen statues for the Piccolomini tomb at\r\nSiena; but when he saw the immense block he gave up the Siena work, and\r\ncontracted to make a statue in two years. He was to be paid six gold\r\nflorins a month, and as much more as could be agreed upon when the work\r\nwas done. He first made a model in wax of his David; it was very small,\r\nand is now in the Uffizi. In the beginning of 1504, after about two\r\nyears and a half had been spent upon it, the work was done, and a\r\ndiscussion then arose as to where it should be placed.\r\n\r\nAt length it was decided to put it where Michael Angelo himself wished\r\nit to be, next the gate of the palace where the Judith of Donatello then\r\nstood. The statue weighed eighteen thousand pounds, and its removal was\r\na work of great importance. I shall not give all the details of it here,\r\nbut shall quote what Grimm says: \"The erection of this David was like\r\nan occurrence in nature from which people are accustomed to reckon. We\r\nfind events dated so many years after the erection of the giant. It was\r\nmentioned in records in which there was not a line respecting art.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--MICHAEL ANGELO'S DAVID.]\r\n\r\nIn 1527 the statue was injured by a stone thrown in a riot. At length it\r\nbegan to show the effect of time and weather, and the people of Florence\r\ntalked of removing it for better preservation. There was much feeling\r\nagainst this; the Florentines feared that misfortunes would fall upon\r\nthem if this great work were disturbed; but at last, in 1873, it was\r\nplaced in the Academy of Fine Arts. It represents the youthful David at\r\nthe moment when he declares to Goliath, \"I come unto thee in the name of\r\nthe Lord of Hosts.\" The beautiful figure is muscular and pliant, and\r\nthe face is full of courage. (Fig. 106.)\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the year 1505 Pope Julius II. summoned Michael\r\nAngelo to Rome, and after a time gave him a commission to build a\r\ncolossal mausoleum to be erected for himself. The design was made and\r\naccepted, and then Michael Angelo went to Carrara to select marble;\r\nafter much trouble he succeeded in getting it to Rome, where all who saw\r\nit were astonished at the size of the blocks. Pope Julius was delighted,\r\nand had a passage made from the palace to the workshop of the sculptor,\r\nso that he could visit the artist without being seen. Other sculptors\r\nnow became jealous of Michael Angelo, and when he went a second time to\r\nCarrara, Bramante persuaded the pope that it was a bad sign to build his\r\ntomb while he was still living. When Michael Angelo returned and the\r\nworkmen he had hired arrived from Florence, he found the pope much\r\nchanged toward him. He no longer hastened the work, neither would he\r\nfurnish money to carry it on.\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo sought the pope for an explanation, and was refused an\r\naudience. He wrote a letter thus: \"Most Holy Father, I was this morning\r\ndriven from the palace by the order of your Holiness. If you require me\r\nin future you can seek me elsewhere than in Rome.\" He ordered a Jew to\r\nsell all he possessed in Rome, and started for Florence, and stopped not\r\nuntil he was on the ground of Tuscany. The pope sent after him, but as\r\nhe was a citizen of Florence he threatened the messengers if they\r\ntouched him. He said he had been treated as a criminal, and he\r\nconsidered himself free from his engagements, and would not return then\r\nor ever.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home a letter came to the Signory of Florence urging his\r\nreturn, and saying that he should be safe. But Michael waited until the\r\nthird letter was received, and only consented to go when it was\r\narranged that he should be sent as an ambassador of Florence, and be\r\nunder the protection of the Florentine Republic.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1506, when the pope had taken Bologna, he sent for Michael\r\nAngelo to come to him there. Michael Angelo had not yet seen the pope\r\nsince he left Rome in anger. When he reached Bologna he went first to\r\nSan Petronio to hear mass. A servant of the pope recognized him and led\r\nhim to his Holiness. Julius was at table, but ordered that Michael\r\nAngelo should come in, and said to him, \"You have waited thus long, it\r\nseems, till we should ourselves come to seek you.\" Michael Angelo\r\nkneeled down and begged his pardon, but added that he had remained away\r\nbecause he had been offended. The pope looked at him doubtfully, when\r\none of the priests, fearing what would happen, advised the pope not to\r\njudge an ignorant artist as he would another man. Then the pope turned\r\nupon him in great anger, and declaring that he himself was ignorant and\r\nmiserable, ordered him out of his sight. The poor ecclesiastic was so\r\nterrified that the attendants were obliged to carry him out, and then\r\nthe pope spoke graciously to the sculptor, and commanded him not to\r\nleave Bologna without his permission. The pope soon gave him an order\r\nfor a colossal statue in bronze to be erected in Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe first cast of this statue failed, and the work was not ready to be\r\nput in its place until February, 1508. This being done, Michael Angelo\r\nreturned to Florence, where he had much to do; but Julius soon sent for\r\nhim to go to Rome, and insisted that he should paint the roof of the\r\nSistine Chapel, which occupied him a long time.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 Julius II. died, and Michael Angelo resumed his work upon his\r\nmausoleum. The pope had mentioned it in his will, and his heirs wished\r\nit to be completed. At this time he probably worked upon the statue of\r\nMoses and upon the two chained youths. He devoted himself to the\r\nmausoleum during three years.\r\n\r\nLeo X., who was now pope, demanded the services of Michael Angelo to\r\nerect a façade to the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence. The artist\r\nobjected to this great work, and declared that he was bound to complete\r\nthe tomb for which he had already received money. But Leo insisted upon\r\nhis going to Florence. He had much trouble to get his marble from the\r\nquarries--the men were ill there. He was ill himself, and he passed a\r\nyear of great anxiety and trouble, when there came word from Rome that\r\nthe work must be given up; the building was postponed, and no payment\r\nwas made to Michael Angelo! He was much disheartened, but returned to\r\nhis work on the mausoleum.\r\n\r\nAbout 1523, when, after many changes, Cardinal Medici was pope, the work\r\nat San Lorenzo was resumed. But in 1525 the pope again summoned Michael\r\nAngelo to Rome. The heirs of Julius were complaining of delay, but at\r\nlast the pope insisted upon his great need of the artist, and again he\r\nwas sent back to Florence, where the cupola of the new Sacristy to San\r\nLorenzo was soon finished. Great political confusion now ensued, and\r\nlittle can be said of Michael Angelo as a sculptor until 1530, when he\r\nagain resumed his work on the Sacristy.\r\n\r\nHe worked with the greatest industry and rapidity, and in a few months\r\nhad nearly finished the four colossal figures which rest upon the\r\nsarcophagi of Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici. The pope was forced to\r\ncommand the sculptor to rest. His health was so broken by the sorrow\r\nwhich the political condition of Florence caused him, and by his anxiety\r\nabout the mausoleum of Julius, that there was much danger of his killing\r\nhimself with work and worry. He went to Rome, and matters were more\r\nsatisfactorily arranged. He returned to Florence, and labored there\r\nuntil 1534, when Clement VII. died, and Michael Angelo left his work\r\nin San Lorenzo, never to resume it. Unfinished as these sculptures are,\r\nthey make a grand part of the wonderful works of this great man. The\r\nstatues of the two Medici and those of Morning, Evening, Day, and Night\r\nwould be sufficient to establish the fame of an artist if he had done\r\nnothing more. (Fig. 107.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--GIULIANO DE' MEDICI. _By Michael Angelo._]\r\n\r\nUnder the new pope, Paul III., he was constantly employed as a painter,\r\nand architectural labors were put upon him, so that as a sculptor we\r\nhave no more works of his to mention except an unfinished group which\r\nwas in his studio at the time of his death. It represents the dead\r\nChrist upon his mother's lap, with Joseph of Arimathea standing by. This\r\ngroup is now in the Church of Santa Maria del Fiore, or the Cathedral of\r\nFlorence. The mausoleum of Julius II. caused Michael Angelo and others\r\nso much trouble and vexation that the whole affair came to be known as\r\nthe \"tragedy of the sepulchre.\" When Julius first ordered it he intended\r\nto place it in St. Peter's, but in the end it was erected in the Church\r\nof San Pietro in Vincoli, of which Julius had been the titular cardinal.\r\nOf all the monument but three figures can really be called the work of\r\nMichael Angelo. These are the Leah and Rachel upon the lower stage, and\r\nthe Moses, which is one of the most famous statues in the world. Paul\r\nIII., with eight cardinals, once visited the studio of the sculptor when\r\nhe was at work upon this statue, and they declared that this alone was\r\nsufficient for the pope's monument (Fig. 108).\r\n\r\nThe life of Michael Angelo was a sad one; indeed, it is scarcely\r\npossible to recount a more pathetic story than was his. The misfortunes\r\nwhich came to the Medici were sharp griefs to him, and his temperament\r\nwas such that he could not forget his woes. His family, too, looked to\r\nhim for large sums of money, and while he lived most frugally they spent\r\nhis earnings. In his old age he said, \"Rich as I am, I have always lived\r\nlike a poor man.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--STATUE OF MOSES. _By Michael Angelo._]\r\n\r\nIn 1529, when Florence was under great political excitement, Michael\r\nAngelo was appointed superintendent of all the fortifications of the\r\nFlorentine territory. In the midst of his duties he became aware of\r\nfacts which determined him to fly. He went to Venice, and was proscribed\r\nas a rebel. We cannot stay here to inquire as to his wisdom in this, but\r\nmust go on to say that at length he was so much needed that he was\r\npersuaded to return. Then he had the dreadful experiences of hope and\r\nfear, sickness and famine, and all the horrors of a siege, only to see\r\nhis beloved home deprived of its freedom, and in the possession of those\r\nwhom he despised and hated. To Michael Angelo this was far more bitter\r\nthan any personal sorrow; he never recovered from its effects, and it\r\nwas immediately after this that he worked in the Sacristy of San Lorenzo\r\nas if trying to kill himself.\r\n\r\nHe was bold as he was angry. He was treated kindly, and advised to\r\nforget the past; but he never concealed his views. When his statue of\r\nNight was exhibited, verses were put upon it, according to the custom of\r\nthe time; one verse read, \"Night, whom you see slumbering here so\r\ncharmingly, has been carved by an angel, in marble. She sleeps, she\r\nlives; waken her, if you will not believe it, and she will speak.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Michael Angelo replied, \"Sleep is dear to me, and still more\r\nthat I am stone, so long as dishonor and shame last among us; the\r\nhappiest fate is to see, to hear nothing; for this reason waken me not.\r\nI pray you, speak gently.\" He had great courage to speak his anger thus\r\npublicly in the midst of those who could easily destroy him.\r\n\r\nIn 1537 or 1538 his father died, and the artist suffered terribly from\r\nhis grief. He wrote a sonnet beginning:\r\n\r\n   \"Already had I wept and sighed so much.\r\n   I thought all grief forever at an end,\r\n   Exhaled in sighs, shed forth in bitter tears.\"\r\n\r\nThe religious views of Michael Angelo were very broad, and he had a\r\ntrustful and obedient dependence upon God, in whose mercy and love he\r\ngratefully rested with the simple faith of a child. It was not far from\r\nthe time when his father died that Michael Angelo first met Vittoria\r\nColonna. He was now more than sixty years old; and though his poems show\r\nthat he had loved children and women all his life, yet he had allowed\r\nhimself no attachments; his life had been lonely and alone. Now, at this\r\nlate hour, he yielded his heart to this beautiful, gifted woman, who\r\nreturned his friendship with the fullest esteem. During these years he\r\nwas happier than he had ever been. But in 1541 she fell under the\r\nsuspicion of the Inquisition, and was obliged to leave Rome.\r\n\r\nDuring two years they wrote constantly to each other, and each sent to\r\nthe other the sonnets they wrote. At this time all Italy read the poems\r\nof Vittoria, and those of Michael Angelo still stand the test of time.\r\nIn them he shows the blessed effect of her influence over him. At length\r\nshe returned to Rome and entered a convent, where she died in 1547.\r\nMichael Angelo was with her to the last, and years later he declared\r\nthat he regretted nothing so much as that he had only kissed her hand,\r\nand not her forehead or cheeks in that last hour. His loss was far too\r\ngreat to be told. (An engraving of a portrait of Michael Angelo can be\r\nseen in Mrs. Clement's \"Painting,\" p. 95.)\r\n\r\nIn the year following Vittoria's death all the hopes which he had\r\ncherished for the freedom of Florence were crushed. High honors were\r\noffered him to induce him to return there, but he would not go. His\r\nhealth failed, his sadness increased, and his writings show how\r\nconstantly he mourned for Vittoria. After this he did much work as an\r\narchitect, and held the post of director of the building of St. Peter's.\r\nHe superintended the erection of the statue of Marcus Aurelius, and\r\ncompleted the Farnese Palace, and had many improvements in mind.\r\n\r\nNow, in his old age, he was authority itself in Rome. He had no rival,\r\nand his advice was sought by artists as well as others. He lived very\r\nsimply: he dined alone, and received his visitors in the plainest\r\nmanner. Anatomy, which had always been a passion with him, was now his\r\nchief pursuit. He made many dissections of animals, and was grateful\r\nwhen a human subject could be allowed him.\r\n\r\nWhen he could not sleep he would get up at night and work upon the group\r\nof which we have spoken; he had a cap with a candle in it, so that it\r\ncast a light upon his work. Vasari once entered when he was at work upon\r\nthis group, and had a lantern in his hand; he dropped it purposely, so\r\nthat the sculpture should not be seen, and said: \"I am so old that death\r\noften pulls me by the coat to come to him, and some day I shall fall\r\ndown like this lantern, and my last spark of life will be extinguished.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many very interesting circumstances told of his last years and\r\nhis strength of mind, and the work which he did was wonderful; but we\r\nhave not space to recount it here.\r\n\r\nAt length, in February, 1564, when almost ninety years old, he died. He\r\nhad asked to be buried in Florence. His friends feared that this would\r\nbe opposed, so they held burial-services in Rome, and his body was\r\nafterward carried through the gates as merchandise. In Florence the body\r\nwas first laid in San Piero Maggiore, and on Sunday, at evening, the\r\nartists assembled, and forming a procession, proceeded to Santa Croce,\r\nwhere he was buried. The younger artists bore the bier upon their\r\nshoulders, and the older ones carried torches to light the way. A great\r\nmultitude followed the procession, and in the Sacristy of Santa Croce\r\nthe coffin was opened; though three weeks had passed since his death,\r\nhis face appeared as if he had just died; the crowd was very great, but\r\nall was quiet, and before morning it had dispersed. The Duke had thought\r\nthat a public funeral would recall old memories, and might cause a\r\ndisturbance; but Michael Angelo had left Florence thirty years before\r\nhis death, and his connection with the city was forgotten by many.\r\n\r\nThe July following was appointed for a memorial service in his honor;\r\nSan Lorenzo was splendidly decorated; Varchi delivered an oration.\r\nLeonardo, his nephew, erected a monument to him in Santa Croce, for\r\nwhich the Duke gave the marble. His statue stands in the court of the\r\nUffizi with those of other great Florentines, but with no especial\r\nprominence. His house in the Ghibelline Street is preserved as a museum,\r\nand visitors there see many mementos of this great man.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 a grand festival was held in Florence to celebrate the four\r\nhundredth anniversary of his birth. The ceremonies were impressive, and\r\ncertain documents relating to his life which had never been opened, by\r\ncommand of the king, were given to suitable persons for examination. Mr.\r\nHeath Wilson, an English artist, then residing at Florence, wrote a new\r\nlife of Michael Angelo, and the last signature which Victor Emmanuel\r\nwrote before his death was upon the paper which conferred on Mr. Wilson\r\nthe Order of the _Corona d'Italia_, given as a recognition of his\r\nservices in writing this book.\r\n\r\nThe national pride in Michael Angelo is very strong. \"All Italians feel\r\nthat he occupies the third place by the side of Dante and Raphael, and\r\nforms with them a triumvirate of the greatest men produced by their\r\ncountry--a poet, a painter, and one who was great in all arts. Who would\r\nplace a general or a statesman by their side as equal to them? It is art\r\nalone which marks the prime of nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe genius of Michael Angelo and his spirit were powerful forces. They\r\npervaded the whole art of Italy to such an extent that it may be said\r\nthat all sculptors were his imitators, both while he lived and after his\r\ndeath. He loved to treat strong subjects, such as demanded violent\r\nmovement and unusual positions. It was only a man of his genius who\r\ncould raise such subjects above grotesqueness and the one effect of\r\nstrange and unnatural exaggeration. As we look over all his works it\r\nseems as if the idea of beauty and such things as are pleasing to the\r\nordinary mind rarely, if ever, came to his mind. Noble feeling, depth of\r\nthought, strength, and grandeur are the associations which we have with\r\nhim, and in the hands of weaker men, as his imitators were, these\r\nsubjects became barren, hollow displays of distorted limbs and soulless\r\nheads and faces.\r\n\r\nThe result is, that there is little to be said of the immediate\r\nfollowers of this great man. GUGLIELMO DELLA PORTA was one of his most\r\nable scholars, and his chief work was a monument to Pope Paul III. in\r\nthe Church of St. Peter's. The figure of the pope is in bronze, is\r\nseated, and holding the right hand in benediction. It is dignified and\r\nwell designed. The figures of Justice and Prudence are not as good, and\r\ntwo others, Peace and Abundance, which were a part of this work, but are\r\nnow in the Farnese Palace, lack power, and show an attempt at a\r\nrepresentation of mere physical beauty.\r\n\r\nBACCIO BANDINELLI (1487-1559) is more noticeable for his hatred of\r\nMichael Angelo than for any other characteristic. He was a native of\r\nFlorence and a friend of Leonardo da Vinci. He was powerful in his\r\ndesign and bold in his treatment of his subjects, but he was full of\r\naffectation and mannerisms in his execution of his works. He was false\r\nand envious, and his one good quality was that of industry. His best\r\nworks are on the screen of the high-altar in the Cathedral of Florence,\r\na relief on a pedestal in the Piazza of San Lorenzo, in Florence, and a\r\ngroup in the Church of the Annunziata, which he intended for his own\r\nmonument; the subject is Nicodemus supporting Christ, and the Nicodemus\r\nis a portrait of Bandinelli himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN SCULPTURE FROM MICHAEL ANGELO TO CANOVA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only Italian artists attempted to follow the great sculptor of\r\nItaly, but those of other nations flocked to Rome, and whatever ideas\r\nthey may have had before reaching that city they seemed to lose them all\r\nand to aim simply at one thing--to be Michaelangeloesque.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI DA BOLOGNA (1529-1608) was born in Douai, in Flanders, and was\r\ncalled Il Fiammingo for this reason. Giovanni was intended for a notary\r\nby his father, who planned his education with that end in view; but the\r\nboy's passion for sculpture was so great that the father was obliged to\r\nyield to it, and placed him under the instruction of a sculptor named\r\nBeuch, who had studied in Italy. Later Giovanni went to Rome, and\r\nfinally settled in Florence, where his most important works remain.\r\n\r\nHe was an imitator of Michael Angelo, and one of his best imitators; but\r\nwhen his works are compared with those of the great master, or with the\r\nmasterpieces of the fifteenth century, we see a decline in them. In\r\nreligious subjects Giovanni was not at home; his most successful works\r\nwere those which represented sentiment or abstract ideas, because on\r\nthem he could lavish his skill in execution, and use ornaments that did\r\nnot suit the simplicity of religious subjects. In the Loggia de' Lanzi,\r\nat Florence, there are two groups by him, the Rape of the Sabines and\r\nHercules and Nessus. In the Piazza della Signoria is his excellent\r\nstatue of Duke Cosmo I., and in the Uffizi Gallery a bronze statue of\r\nMercury. The Rape of the Sabines is his masterpiece, and the Mercury is\r\none of the best works of its kind since the days of classic art. It is\r\nthe favorite Mercury of the world, and has been frequently copied. It is\r\nseen in many galleries and collections in its original size, and a small\r\ncopy is much used in private houses. (Fig. 109.)\r\n\r\nGiovanni was especially happy in his designs for fountains, and that\r\nwhich he erected in Bologna, in 1564, in front of the Palazzo Pubblico,\r\nis a splendid work of this kind. The statue of Neptune at its summit is\r\nstately and free in its action; the children are charming and life-like,\r\nand the Sirens at the base give an harmonious finish and complete the\r\noutline with easy grace.\r\n\r\nHe also erected a magnificent fountain in the island of the Boboli\r\nGardens. In the Palazzo Vecchio is a marble group by Giovanni\r\nrepresenting Virtue conquering Vice. At Petraja there is a beautiful\r\nVenus crowning a fountain remarkable for grace and delicacy, and, all in\r\nall, his works prove him to have been the best sculptor of his own time.\r\nTuscany may claim him and be proud of him, for he was far more her son\r\nthan that of his native Flanders.\r\n\r\nGiovanni da Bologna was far less successful in reliefs than in statues,\r\nas may be seen in the bronze gates to the Cathedral of Pisa, which he\r\nmade in the last years of his life. In his character this master was\r\nattractive and much beloved by his friends. One of them wrote of him:\r\n\"The best fellow in the world, not in the least covetous, as he shows by\r\nhis poverty; filled with a love of glory, and ambitious of rivalling\r\nMichael Angelo.\"\r\n\r\nGiovanni decorated a chapel in the Church of the Annunziata with several\r\nreliefs in bronze and with a crucifix; he not only wished to be buried\r\nhere himself, as he was, but he also desired to provide a place of\r\nburial for any of his countrymen who might die in Florence. The chapel\r\nis called that of the Madonna del Soccorso.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--MERCURY. _By Giovanni da Bologna._]\r\n\r\nThe decline of sculpture in Italy at this period makes its study so\r\nunpromising that it is a pleasure to turn to France, where the works of\r\nJEAN GOUJON show that he had the true idea of sculpture in relief. From\r\n1555 to 1562 this sculptor was employed on the works at the Louvre, and\r\nduring the massacre of St. Bartholomew he was shot while on a scaffold\r\nquietly working at a bas-relief on that palace.\r\n\r\nGoujon was an architect as well as a sculptor, and also a medal\r\nengraver, as is shown by the curious and rare medal which he made for\r\nCatherine de' Medici. Many of his works are preserved in different parts\r\nof France, and some bas-reliefs in the Museum of the Louvre are\r\nexcellent specimens of his style.\r\n\r\nOne also sees in France many works by GERMAIN PILON, who died in 1590.\r\nHe executed the monument to Francis I., and took a part in that of Henry\r\nII. and Catherine de' Medici at the Church of St. Denis. He was the\r\nsculptor of the group of the three Graces in the Louvre, which formerly\r\nbore an urn containing the heart of Henry II., and was in the Church of\r\nthe Celestines.\r\n\r\nBut the sculptors of France at this time are not of such interest as to\r\nhold our attention long. There was a certain amount of spirit in their\r\ndecorations of palaces and tombs, but there were no men of great genius,\r\nand no splendid works upon which we can dwell with pleasure or profit.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, too, while there was much activity in sculpture, and public\r\nfountains and luxurious palaces and rich ornaments employed many\r\nartists, yet there was no originality or freshness in these works, and\r\nthey fell below those of the past. Bronzes are still made at Nuremberg,\r\nbut they only serve to make one regret that they are so inferior to\r\nthose of earlier days; and nowhere in all Germany does any one artist\r\nstand out and present a man to be studied in his works or remembered as\r\none of the gifted of the earth. And yet a list of the names of German\r\nsculptors of this time would be very long, for all over the land\r\nchurches were being decorated, monuments built, and statues and\r\nfountains erected.\r\n\r\nIn England the best sculpture of the sixteenth century was seen in the\r\nportrait statues on monuments, and we find no great artists there of\r\nwhom to give an account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--RELIEF BY BERRUGUETE. _Valladolid._]\r\n\r\nIn Spain ALONSO BERRUGUETE (1480-1561), who was the most eminent artist\r\nof his time, had introduced the Italian manner. He went to Italy about\r\n1503, and studied in Rome and Florence during seventeen years. This was\r\nat the time when Italian sculpture was at the height of its excellence;\r\nand Berruguete returned to Spain filled with the purest and best\r\nconceptions of what art should be, and the ends it should serve. He has\r\nbeen called the Michael Angelo of Spain, because he was an architect,\r\npainter, and sculptor.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Spain he was appointed painter and sculptor to\r\nCharles V. Among his most celebrated works in sculpture are the reliefs\r\nin the choir of the Cathedral at Toledo; the altar in the Church of San\r\nBenito el Real at Valladolid (Fig. 110), for which he was paid\r\nforty-four hundred ducats, and his sculptures in the Collegio Mayor at\r\nSalamanca. His final work was a monument to the Cardinal and Grand\r\nInquisitor, Don Juan de Tavera, which is in the Church of the Hospital\r\nof St. John at Toledo. The sarcophagus is ornamented by reliefs from the\r\nstory of John the Baptist, which are executed in an excellent manner,\r\nsimple and expressive.\r\n\r\nOther Spanish sculptors were ESTEBAN JORDAN, an eminent wood-carver,\r\nGREGORIO HERNANDEZ (1566-1636), who has been called \"the sculptor of\r\nreligion.\" His works are so full of a spirit of devotion that they seem\r\nto have been executed under an inspiration. Hernandez was very devout in\r\nhis life, and did many works of charity; he often provided decent burial\r\nfor the very poor who died without friends who could bury them.\r\n\r\nMany of his works have been removed from the chapels for which they were\r\ndesigned, and are now in the Museum of Valladolid, where they are not as\r\neffective as when placed in their original positions. He is superior to\r\nother Spanish sculptors in his representation of nude figures and in the\r\ngrandeur of his expression.\r\n\r\nJUAN DE JUNI (died 1614) studied in Italy, and acquired much mannerism;\r\nhis works are seen in Valladolid.\r\n\r\nJUAN MARTINEZ MONTAÑES (died 1650) was a famous sculptor, and excelled\r\nin figures of children and cherubs. His conceptions had much beauty and\r\ndepth of feeling, and his draperies were most graceful; and to this\r\npower of thinking out clearly and well the subject he wished to\r\nrepresent he added the ability to do his work in an artistic manner, and\r\nto give it an elegance of finish without taking away its strength. A\r\nConception by him, in the Cathedral of Seville, is a noble work, and in\r\nthe university church of the same city there is an altar which is one of\r\nhis important works. Other sculptures by Montañes are in the Museum of\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\nThe great ALONSO CANO (1601-1667) was a pupil of Montañes in sculpture,\r\nand, like so many other artists of his time, was a painter and architect\r\nas well as a sculptor. His personal history is very peculiar. He was a\r\nman of violent temper, and was often involved in serious quarrels. He\r\nwas obliged to flee from Granada to Madrid on account of a duel, and\r\nwhen his wife was found murdered in her bed he was suspected of the\r\ncrime. In spite of all this he took priest's orders, and was appointed\r\nto a canonry in the Cathedral of Granada; but on account of his temper\r\nhe was deprived of this office by the chapter of the cathedral. He was\r\nso angry at this that he would do no more work for the cathedral.\r\n\r\nHe devoted the remainder of his life to religious and charitable works.\r\nHe gave away the money he earned as soon as he received it, and when he\r\nhad no money to give away he was in the habit of making drawings, which\r\nhe signed and marked with a suitable price; these he gave to the person\r\nhe desired to assist, and recommended some person to whom application to\r\nbuy the work could be made. After his death a large number of these\r\ncharitable works was collected.\r\n\r\nHe hated Jews with such hatred that he could not endure to look at one,\r\nand many strange stories are told of him in connection with these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHe loved his chisel better than his brush, and was accustomed to say\r\nthat when weary he carved for rest. One of his pupils expressed great\r\nsurprise at this, when Cano answered, \"Blockhead, don't you perceive\r\nthat to create form and relief on a flat surface is a greater service\r\nthan to fashion one shape into another?\"\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful sculpture by Cano which remains is a Virgin about a\r\nfoot high in the Sacristy of the Cathedral of Granada, where there are\r\nseveral other statuettes by him. These are colored in a manner which the\r\nSpaniards call \"estofado;\" it has the effect to soften the whole\r\nappearance of the works, like an enamel. At the entrance of the choir of\r\nthe cathedral there are two colossal busts by Cano; they are grand\r\nworks, and are called Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\nPEDRO ROLDAN (1624-1700), born at Seville, is an interesting sculptor\r\nbecause of his work, and on account of his being the last one whose\r\nmanner was like that of Juni and Hernandez. His first celebrated work\r\nwas the high-altar in the chapel of the Biscayans in the Franciscan\r\nconvent. When the Caridad, or Hospital of Charity, was restored, Roldan\r\nexecuted the last great work in painted sculpture; it was an immense\r\npiece for the centre of the retablo of the high-altar of the church, and\r\nrepresented the Entombment of Christ.\r\n\r\nSeville abounds in his works, and he executed bas-reliefs in stone for\r\nthe exterior of the Cathedral at Jaen. He was so devoted to his art that\r\nhe felt every moment to be lost that was not spent in its service. He\r\nmarried a lady of good family, and lived in the country; when obliged to\r\ngo to Seville he was accustomed to carry a lump of clay, and model from\r\nit as he rode along. Roldan was not by any means the best of Spanish\r\nsculptors, but he had great skill in the composition of his works, and\r\nthe draperies and all the details were carefully studied. His daughter,\r\nDoña Luisa Roldan, studied sculpture under her father's instruction, and\r\nbecame a good artist; he was accustomed to allow her to superintend her\r\nstudio and his pupils. She often aided him by her suggestions, and on\r\none occasion, when a statue that he had made was rejected, she pointed\r\nout to him certain anatomical defects, which he remedied, and the whole\r\nappearance of the work was so changed that it was thought to be new, and\r\nwas accepted for the place for which it had been ordered.\r\n\r\nThe works executed by Doña Luisa were principally small figures of the\r\nVirgin, the Adoration of the Shepherds, and kindred subjects. Several of\r\nthese were presented to King Charles II., and he was so pleased by them\r\nthat he ordered a life-size statue of St. Michael for the Church of the\r\nEscorial. She executed this to his satisfaction, and he then appointed\r\nher sculptress in ordinary to the king. She died at Madrid in 1704,\r\nsurviving her father but four years. She left works in various convents\r\nand churches.\r\n\r\nIn Italy at the beginning of the seventeenth century a new era in\r\nsculpture was inaugurated. Art was now required to serve the Church in\r\nthe way of appealing to sentiments and feeling in a far coarser and more\r\nsensational a manner than formerly. Painting was suited to these\r\npurposes far more than sculpture, and it had been raised to great\r\nheights, in Spain, by Murillo, in the North by Rubens and his followers,\r\nand in Italy by numerous masters.\r\n\r\nLübke says of this period: \"All that was now demanded of art was effect\r\nand feeling at any price. The one was attained through the other. A\r\npassionate excitement pulsates throughout all artistic works; the ideal\r\nrepose of the former altar-pieces no longer satisfied. Longing,\r\ndevotional ardor, passionate rapture, enthusiastic ecstasy--these are\r\nthe aims of the new art. No longer the solemn dignity of the saint, but\r\nthe nervous visions of enraptured monks, are its ideal. It delights in\r\nthrilling delineations of martyrdom, seeking to render such scenes as\r\neffective and touching as possible. A desire for substantial power, a\r\npolitical-religious tendency, had taken possession of art, and had\r\nadapted it to its own objects. That, under such circumstances, painting\r\nreaches a new and truly artistic importance may be traced above all to\r\nthe great masters who now cultivated the art, and still more to the tone\r\nof the age, which promoted it in a rare measure.... The same spirit,\r\nhowever, which imparted such genuine importance to painting produced the\r\nruin of sculpture. This epoch, more than any other, is a proof that the\r\ngreatest men of talent, appearing in a perverted age, are carried by\r\ntheir very genius all the more certainly to ruin. All that, in a more\r\nfavorable period, would have raised them to be stars in the art\r\nfirmament, now made them fall like some _ignis fatuus_, the brilliant\r\nlight of which owes its illusory existence only to miasma. This striking\r\nfact appears, at first sight, inexplicable; but it is easy to\r\nunderstand, if we consider the different character of the two arts.\r\nPlastic art had formerly emulated painting, and thus, especially in\r\nrelief, had suffered unmistakable injury to its own peculiar nature. At\r\nthat time, however, painting itself was full of architectural severity\r\nand plastic nobleness of form. Now, when everything depended on striking\r\neffect and speaking delineation of passionate emotions, it was compelled\r\nto have recourse to naturalistic representation, to freer arrangements\r\nand to more striking forms that emulated reality. If, however,\r\nsculpture, which could not keep pace with its rival in the enamelled\r\ncoloring and mysterious charm of the _chiaro-oscuro_ which it brought\r\ninto the field, would, in anywise, do the same as painting, it was\r\ncompelled to plunge regardlessly into the same naturalism of forms and\r\ninto the same bold display of passion with which painting produced such\r\ngrand effects. And this sculpture did without the slightest scruple, and\r\nin this lack of an artistic conscience its whole glory perished. It is\r\ntrue in this passion for excited compositions an excess of splendid\r\nworks were produced; it is true immense resources were expended, and\r\nable artists were employed; but such inner hollowness stares at us with\r\ninanimate eye from the greater number of these works that we turn from\r\nthem with repugnance, and even often with disgust.\"\r\n\r\nThe artist who first met this new demand upon sculpture, and may be\r\ncalled the founder of a new style, was GIOVANNI LORENZO BERNINI\r\n(1598-1680), a very gifted man. When but ten years old this remarkable\r\ngenius was known as a prodigy in art, and it was at this early age that\r\nhis father took him to Rome. Pope Paul V. was soon interested in him,\r\nand Cardinal Barberini assisted him in his studies; from this fortunate\r\nbeginning all through his life good fortune attended his steps. He lived\r\nthrough the pontificate of nine popes, and was always in favor with the\r\nreigning head of the Church. This gave him the opportunity to fill Rome\r\nwith his works, and he imprinted himself upon the art of the Eternal\r\nCity; no artist since the time of Michael Angelo held such sway, and\r\nBernini acquired his power easily, while the grand Michael Angelo was\r\ndisputed at every step, and fought a long, hard battle before he was\r\nallowed to take the place which was so clearly his by right.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Bernini extended to other lands, and he was invited to\r\nFrance, where he went when sixty-eight years old, accompanied by one of\r\nhis sons and a numerous retinue. He was loaded with favors, and received\r\nlarge sums of money and many valuable presents. In Rome, too, he was\r\nmuch favored; he held several church benefices, and his son was made a\r\nCanon of Santa Maria Maggiore; and it was in this church that Bernini\r\nwas buried with great magnificence, as became his position and his\r\nwealth, for he left the immense fortune of four hundred thousand Roman\r\ncrowns.\r\n\r\nBernini had great versatility of talent, a remarkable imagination and\r\npower of conceiving his subjects clearly, and, more than all, he had\r\nmarvellous power of execution and compelling his marble to show forth\r\nhis thought. It has been said that marble was like wax or clay beneath\r\nhis hand. He was subject to no rules; indeed, he believed that an artist\r\nmust set aside all rules if he would excel. This sounds very\r\nfascinating, but a study of Bernini's works will show that it is a\r\ndeceitful maxim. A man of small talent could do nothing in this way, and\r\neven Bernini, who without doubt had great gifts, often failed to make up\r\nin any way for the sins against rules of which he was guilty.\r\nWestmacott, in his writing upon sculpture, says it would have been\r\nbetter for art if Bernini had never lived; and it is true that in his\r\nstruggle for effect he was an injury rather than a benefit to the art of\r\nhis own day and the succeeding years.\r\n\r\nThe worst defect in the sculpture of Bernini is his treatment of the\r\nhuman body. At times he exaggerates the muscular power beyond all\r\nresemblance to nature, and again he seems to leave out all anatomy and\r\nsoften the body to a point that far exceeds possibility. This softness\r\nis seen in his Apollo and Daphne, which shows the moment when she is\r\nsuddenly changed into a laurel-tree in order to escape the pursuit of\r\nthe young god. This group is in the Villa Borghese, at Rome; it was\r\nexecuted when Bernini was but eighteen years old, and near the close of\r\nhis life he declared that he had made little progress after its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nBut he reached the height of this objectionable manner in his\r\nrepresentation of the Rape of Proserpine, which is in the Villa\r\nLudovisi. The Pluto is a rough, repulsive man, with whom no association\r\nof a god can be made, and the Proserpine is made a soulless, sensual\r\nfigure, so far from attractive in a pure sense that we are almost\r\nwilling that Pluto should carry her to some region from which she is not\r\nlikely to come back. At the same time we are sorry not to provide her\r\nwith an ointment for the blue marks which the big hands of Pluto are\r\nmaking on her soft flesh. The plain truth is, that this work makes a low\r\nand common thing of a subject which could be so treated as to be a\r\n\"thing of beauty\" in a charming sense. (Fig. 111.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--RAPE OF PROSERPINE. _By Bernini._]\r\n\r\nBernini executed a statue of St. Bibiana for the church of that saint at\r\nRome, and one of St. Longinus in one of the niches to the dome of St.\r\nPeter's; he also made the designs for the one hundred and sixty-two\r\nstatues in the colonnades of St. Peter's, and for the decorations of the\r\nbridge of St. Angelo; in such works, almost without exception, he chose\r\nsome moment in the lives of the persons represented that called for a\r\nstriking attitude and gave an opportunity for an effect that is often\r\ntheatrical. As a mere decoration such statues have a certain value of an\r\ninferior sort; but as works of art, as intellectual efforts, they are\r\nworthless. However, this decorative effect, as it is seen on the façade\r\nof the Lateran, where the figures stand out against the sky, or on the\r\nbridge of St. Angelo, is not by any means to be despised; only we cannot\r\ncall a sculptor a great artist when he can do nothing finer than this.\r\n\r\nSome of Bernini's works in which he shows intense suffering have more\r\ngenuine feeling, and are finer in artistic qualities. One of these is\r\nPietà, in the chapel of St. Andreas Corsini in the Lateran. But he\r\nfrequently goes beyond the bounds of good taste, as, for example, on the\r\nmonument to Pope Urban VIII., in St. Peter's, where he represents Death\r\nwith his bony hand writing the inscription on the panel; this is truly\r\nterrible, and not less so is another Death upon the monument of\r\nAlexander VII., raising the marble curtain before the entrance to the\r\nvault, as if he were inviting one to walk in. Many objections can be\r\nmade to his draperies. He exaggerated the small curtains seen on some\r\nancient tombs until they were huge objects of ugliness; the drapery upon\r\nhis figures is so prominently treated that instead of being a minor\r\nobject it sometimes seems like the principal one; it no longer serves to\r\nconceal forms, and at the same time show their grace and motion, but it\r\nis inflated, fluttering, grotesque in form and quite absurd when\r\ncompared with statues in which it answers its true purpose.\r\n\r\nCharles I. of England heard so much of Bernini that he desired to have a\r\nstatue of himself executed by this sculptor; three of Vandyck's\r\nportraits of the king were sent to him, and the likeness of the statue\r\nwas so satisfactory to the monarch that he sent the artist six thousand\r\ncrowns and a ring worth as much more.\r\n\r\nBernini executed a colossal equestrian statue of Constantine for the\r\nportico of St. Peter's; he made another of Louis XIV., which was changed\r\ninto a Marcus Curtius, and sent to Versailles. He also executed the\r\nfountain in the Piazza Navona, at Rome, which is one of his exaggerated\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS DUQUESNOY (1594-1646) was born at Brussels, and was known in\r\nRome as Il Fiammingo. The Archduke Albert sent him to Rome to study, and\r\nhe was a contemporary of Bernini. When his patron died Duquesnoy was\r\nleft without means, and was forced to carve small figures in ivory for\r\nhis support. His figures of children, which were full of life and\r\nchild-like expression, became quite famous. An important work of his in\r\nthis way is the fountain of the Manneken-Pis, at Brussels.\r\n\r\nHis masterpiece is a colossal statue of St. Andrew in the Church of St.\r\nPeter's; it occupied him five years, and is one of the best works of\r\nmodern art. His statue of St. Susanna in the Church of Santa Maria di\r\nLoreto, in Rome, is simple and noble, and is much admired. Little is\r\nknown of this artist's life, and it is said that he was poisoned by his\r\nbrother when on his way to France.\r\n\r\nThere was a goodly company of sculptors following Bernini, but none\r\nwhose works or life was of sufficient importance or interest to demand\r\nour attention here, and we will pass to the sculpture of France, where\r\nthe arts were less devoted to the service of the Church and more to the\r\nuses of kings, princes, and noblemen. The court of France was devoted to\r\npomp and pleasure, and sculpture was used for the glorification of the\r\nleaders in all its follies. In one sense this is more agreeable than the\r\nart in Italy which we have been considering, for nothing can be more\r\ndisagreeable than a false religious sentiment in art; it is only when\r\nthe artist is filled with true devotion and feels deeply in his own soul\r\nall that he tries to express in his work that religious representations\r\ncan appeal to us agreeably or benefit us by their influence.\r\n\r\nSIMON GUILLAIN (1581-1658) is especially interesting as the sculptor of\r\nthe statue of Louis XIV. as a boy, which is in the Louvre; those of his\r\nparents are also there; formerly they decorated the Pont au Change.\r\nOther works by this master are in the same museum.\r\n\r\nJACQUES SARRAZIN (1588-1660) is only known by his works, which are now\r\nin the Louvre, of which a bronze bust of the Chancellor Pierre Séguier\r\nis worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS ANGUIER (1604-1669) was born at Eu, in Normandy, and was the\r\nson of a carpenter, who taught his son to carve in wood at an early age.\r\nWhen still quite young François went to Paris to study, and later to\r\nRome. He became one of the first artists of his time in France, and was\r\na favorite of the king, Louis XIII., who made him keeper of the gallery\r\nof antiquities, and gave him apartments in the Louvre. Most of his\r\nimportant works were monuments to illustrious men. His copies of antique\r\nsculptures were very fine.\r\n\r\nMICHEL ANGUIER (1612-1686) was a brother of the preceding, with whom he\r\nstudied until they both went to Rome. Michel remained there ten years,\r\nand was employed with other artists in St. Peter's and in some palaces.\r\nIn 1651 he returned to Paris, and assisted François in the great work of\r\nthe tomb of the Duke de Montmorenci at Moulins.\r\n\r\nMichel executed a statue of Louis XIII., which was cast in bronze. He\r\nadorned the apartments of Queen Anne of Austria in the Louvre, and for\r\nher executed the principal sculptures in the Church of Val de Grace; a\r\nNativity in this church is his best work. His sculptures are seen in\r\nvarious churches, and he also executed statues of ancient gods and vases\r\nfor garden ornaments. He was a professor in the Academy of Arts in\r\nParis, and wrote lectures on sculpture.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS GIRARDON (1630-1715), born at Troyes, was a _protégé_ of the\r\nChancellor Séguier. Louis XIV. gave him a pension, by which he was\r\nenabled to study in Rome, and after his return to France the king gave\r\nhim many commissions. The monument to Cardinal Richelieu in the Church\r\nof the Sorbonne is from the hand of this sculptor. Perhaps his\r\nbest-known work is the Rape of Proserpine at Versailles. He made an\r\nequestrian statue of Louis XIV., which was destroyed in the Revolution;\r\na model of it in bronze is in the Louvre. His bust of Boileau is a\r\nstrong, fine work. Many of his sculptures were destroyed by the\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nA devoted follower of Bernini was PIERRE PUGET (1622-1694). His works\r\nare seen at the Louvre and at Versailles. His group of Milo of Crotona\r\nendeavoring to free himself from the claws of the lion is full of life\r\nand is natural, but the subject is too repulsive to be long examined;\r\nhis Perseus liberating Andromeda is more agreeable, and is noble in its\r\nforms and animated in expression. His Alexander and Diogenes is in\r\nrelief, and is effective and picturesque.\r\n\r\nANTOINE COYSEVOX (1640-1720) was born at Lyons, and manifested his\r\nartistic talent very early in life. Before he was seventeen years old he\r\nhad distinguished himself by a statue of the Virgin, and progressed\r\nrapidly in his studies, which he made in Paris. In 1667 he was engaged\r\nby Cardinal Furstenburg to go to Alsace to decorate his palace; this\r\noccupied him four years. When he again went to Paris he became a very\r\neminent artist. He executed a statue of Louis XIV., and received a\r\ncommission from the province of Bretagne for an equestrian statue of the\r\nsame monarch.\r\n\r\nAmong his best works are the tomb of Cardinal Mazarin; the tomb of the\r\ngreat Colbert in the Church of St. Eustache; the monument of Charles le\r\nBrun in the Church of St. Nicolas; the statue of the great Condé; the\r\nmarble statue of Louis XIV., in the Church of Notre Dame, and others. In\r\nthe tomb of Mazarin he showed fine powers of construction and excellence\r\nof design. The kneeling figure of the minister is a dignified statue and\r\nwell executed; the statues in bronze of Prudence, Peace, and Fidelity,\r\nand the marble figures of Charity and Religion are each and all noble\r\nworks, and free to a remarkable degree from the mannerisms and faults of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nNICOLAS COUSTOU (1658-1733) was a nephew and pupil of Coysevox. He took\r\nthe grand prize at Paris, and went to Rome to study when he was\r\ntwenty-three years old. He made many copies of the antique. After his\r\nreturn to France he was much employed. His chief work was a colossal\r\nrepresentation of the Junction of the Seine and the Marne. He also made\r\nfor the city of Lyons a bronze statue representing the river Saone. Some\r\nof his sculptures are in the Church of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nGUILLAUME COUSTOU (1678-1746), brother of Nicolas, also gained the grand\r\nprize and went to Rome, and on his return made a fine reputation. Much\r\nof his best work was for the gardens of Marly; he executed a bronze\r\nstatue of the Rhone at Lyons; a bas-relief of Christ with the Doctors,\r\nat Versailles, and statues of Louis XIV. and Cardinal Dubois, in the\r\nMuseum of French Monuments.\r\n\r\nJEAN BAPTISTE PIGALLE (1714-1785) is the last French sculptor of whom I\r\nshall speak here. He was born in Paris, and gained his first fame by a\r\nstatue of Mercury; but his masterpiece was the tomb of Marshal Moritz of\r\nSaxony, in the Church of St. Thomas, at Strasburg. The soldier is\r\nrepresented in his own costume, just as he wore it in life, about to\r\nenter a tomb, on one side of which stands a skeleton Death, and on the\r\nother a mourning Hercules. A statue representing France tries to hold\r\nhim back, and a Genius attends on him with an inverted torch. There are\r\nmany accessories of military emblems and trophies. There have been\r\nseveral engravings made from this tomb, the best part of which is the\r\nfigure of the Marshal.\r\n\r\nPigalle was a favorite with Mme. Pompadour, of whom he made a portrait\r\nstatue. She employed him to do many works for her. His best monument in\r\nParis is that of the Comte d'Harcourt, in the Church of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, as in Italy, the painting of the time had a great\r\neffect upon sculpture, and it was full of energy, like the pictures of\r\nthe Rubens school; at the same time there remained traces of the\r\ntraditions of former days, and while a great change had come since the\r\ndays of Vischer, there was still a firm adherence to nature, and no\r\nsuch affectations and mannerisms existed here as were seen in the works\r\nof Bernini and his followers in Italy and France.\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest sculptors of his day was ARTHUR QUELLINUS, who was\r\nborn at Antwerp in 1607. He studied under Duquesnoy, and was especially\r\nhappy in his manner of imagining his subjects, and of avoiding the\r\nimitation of others or a commonplace treatment of his own. The\r\nmagnificent Town Hall of Antwerp was commenced in 1648, and Quellinus\r\nreceived the commission to decorate it with plastic works. His\r\nsculptures are numerous, both on the interior and exterior of the\r\nedifice. In the two pediments he introduced allegorical representations\r\nof the power of the city of Antwerp, especially in her commerce. These\r\ncompositions are picturesque in their arrangement, but the treatment is\r\nsuch as belongs to sculpture; in one of these a figure which represents\r\nthe city is enthroned like a queen, and is surrounded by fantastic\r\nsea-gods, who offer their homage to her. (Fig. 112.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--CARYATIDE. _Quellinus._]\r\n\r\nWe cannot give a list of many detached works by Quellinus, but one of\r\nthe best of the old monuments in Berlin is attributed to him. It is the\r\ntomb of Count Sparr in the Marienkirche.\r\n\r\nAt the present day Berlin is a city of much artistic importance, and the\r\nbeginning of its present architectural and sculptural prominence may be\r\ndated at about the end of the seventeenth century, not quite two hundred\r\nyears ago. One of the most influential artists of that time was ANDREAS\r\nSCHLÜTER (1662-1714), who was born in Hamburg. His father was a sculptor\r\nof no prominence, but he took his son with him to Dantzig, where many\r\nNetherlandish artists were employed upon the buildings being constructed\r\nthere. Andreas Schlüter was naturally gifted, and he devoted himself to\r\nthe study of both architecture and sculpture, at home and later in\r\nItaly. Before he was thirty years old he was employed in important\r\naffairs in Warsaw, and in 1694 he was summoned to Berlin, where he\r\nexecuted the plastic ornaments of the Arsenal; the heads of the Dying\r\nWarriors above the windows in the court-yard are remarkable works. They\r\nare very fine when regarded only as excellent examples of good\r\nsculpture, and they are very effective placed as they are, for they seem\r\nto tell the whole tragic story of what a soldier's life and fate must\r\noften be (Fig. 113).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--HEADS OF DYING WARRIORS. _By Schlüter._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--THE GREAT ELECTOR. _By Schlüter._]\r\n\r\nHowever, the masterpiece of this sculptor is the equestrian statue of\r\nthe Great Elector for the long bridge at Berlin, which was completed in\r\n1703 (Fig. 114). Lübke says of this: \"Although biassed as regards form\r\nby the age which prescribed the Roman costume to ideal portraits of this\r\nkind, the horseman on his mighty charger is conceived with so much\r\nenergy, he is filled with such power of will, he is so noble in bearing\r\nand so steady in his course, that no other equestrian statue can be\r\ncompared with this in fiery majesty. Equally masterly is the\r\narrangement of the whole, especially the four chained slaves on the\r\nbase, in whom we gladly pardon a certain crowding of movements and\r\nforms.\"\r\n\r\nSchlüter also made a statue of the Elector Frederic III., which is now\r\nin Königsberg. Besides his works in sculpture he was the architect of\r\nthe royal palaces at Potsdam, Charlottenburg, and Berlin, and there are\r\nmany sculptures by him at these places. When he was thus in an important\r\nposition and at the height of professional prosperity he met with a sad\r\nmisfortune, from the effects of which he never recovered. A chime of\r\nbells had been purchased in Holland, and Schlüter was commissioned to\r\narrange an old tower for their reception. He carried it higher than it\r\nhad been, and was proceeding to finish it, when it threatened to fall,\r\nand had to be pulled down. On account of this Schlüter was dismissed\r\nfrom his position as court architect; and though his office of sculptor\r\nwas left to him his power was gone, and he was broken down in spirit. He\r\nwas called to St. Petersburg by Peter the Great, and died soon after.\r\nNow, the verdict of judges is that he was one of the greatest artists of\r\nhis age, and that his works, both in sculpture and architecture, belong\r\nto the noblest productions of his century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCANOVA, THORWALDSEN, AND OTHER RECENT SCULPTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century the arts had fallen into such a\r\nfeeble state that a true artistic work--one conceived and executed in an\r\nartist spirit--was not to be looked for. As in the Middle Ages, too,\r\nthought seemed to be sleeping. Both art and letters were largely\r\nprostrated to the service of those in high places; they were scarcely\r\nused except for the pleasure or praise of men whose earthly power made\r\nthem to be feared, and because they were feared they were flattered\r\nopenly and despised secretly.\r\n\r\nBut about the end of the century another spirit arose; a second\r\nRenaissance took place, which may be traced in literature and in art, as\r\nit may be in the movement of political events and an independence of\r\nthought everywhere.\r\n\r\nNaturally the question as to where artists could turn for their models\r\nwas an important one, and as before in various epochs in art the antique\r\nhad been the \"only help in time of trouble,\" so it proved again. In 1764\r\nWinckelmann published his \"History of Ancient Art,\" in which the rich\r\nsignificance of classic art was clearly placed before the student. The\r\nservice which this author rendered to art can scarcely be\r\nover-estimated, coming, as it did, at a time when the genius of art\r\nseemed to have turned his back upon the world, and all true inspiration\r\nwas lost. At about the same time the monuments of Athens were recalled\r\nto the European world by Stuart and Revett in their architectural\r\ndesigns, and by the end of the century the study of the antique had done\r\nits transforming work, and artists were striving for more worthy ends\r\nthan the favor of kings and powerful patrons. This new study of classic\r\nart did not show its full and best results until the Danish sculptor\r\nThorwaldsen executed his works; but before his time others were striving\r\nfor that which it was his privilege to perfect.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest and most famous of these eighteenth-century reformers\r\nwas the Venetian, ANTONIO CANOVA (1757-1822). He was born in Possagno,\r\nand was the son and grandson of stone-cutters. His father died when he\r\nwas very young, and he was thus left to the care and instruction of his\r\ngrandfather, the old Pasino Canova, who lost no time in accustoming the\r\nboy to the use of the chisel, for there are cuttings in existence which\r\nwere executed by Canova in his ninth year. Signor Giovanni Faliero dwelt\r\nnear Possagno, and was in the habit of employing Pasino Canova\r\nfrequently; he entertained such respect for the old stone-cutter that he\r\nsometimes asked him to spend a few days at his villa. On these visits\r\nthe old man was accompanied by Antonio, who soon became a favorite with\r\nall the family of Faliero, and a friend of the young Giuseppe.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when Pasino and the boy attended a festival at Villa\r\nFaliero, the ornament for the dessert was forgotten. When the servants\r\nremembered it at the last moment they went to the old Pasino in\r\ndistress, and begged him to save them from the displeasure of the\r\nmaster. The old man could do nothing for them, but the young Tonin, as\r\nhe was called, asked for some butter, and from it quickly carved a lion.\r\nAt table this strange ornament attracted the attention of all the\r\nguests, and Tonin was called in to receive their praises; from this time\r\nthe Senator Faliero became his patron, and he placed the boy under the\r\ninstruction of Giuseppe Bernardi, called Toretto, a Venetian sculptor\r\nwho had settled at Pagnano.\r\n\r\nAt this time Canova was twelve years old; he studied two years under\r\nToretto, and made many statues and models, which are still preserved by\r\nthe Faliero family, or in other collections. His first really original\r\nwork was the modelling of two angels in clay; he did these during an\r\nabsence of his master's; he placed them in a prominent place, and then\r\nawaited Toretto's opinion with great anxiety. When the master saw them\r\nhe was filled with surprise, and exclaimed that they were truly\r\nmarvellous; from these models the grandfather cut two angels in _pietra\r\ndura_ for the high-altar at Monfumo. At this same period Canova made his\r\nfirst representations of the human form; he was accustomed to make small\r\nstatues and give them to his friends.\r\n\r\nWhen he was fifteen years old Faliero sent for him, and received him\r\ninto his own family. Canova wished to earn something for himself, and\r\nengaged to work half of the day for Giuseppe Ferrari, who was a nephew\r\nof his former master, Toretto. Of this time Canova afterward wrote: \"I\r\nlabored for a mere pittance, but it was sufficient. It was the fruit of\r\nmy own resolution, and, as I then flattered myself, the foretaste of\r\nmore honorable rewards.\" This circumstance proves how remarkable he must\r\nhave been; it is unusual for a boy of fifteen to be paid for work\r\ninstead of paying for instruction. In Venice he was able to learn much\r\nfrom observation. He divided his time systematically, spending his\r\nmornings in the Academy or some gallery, his afternoons in the shop\r\nwhere he was employed, and his evenings in studies for which he had had\r\nno opportunity as a child.\r\n\r\nThe first commission which was given to Canova was from the Commendatore\r\nFarsetti for a pair of baskets filled with fruit and flowers, to be\r\nsculptured in marble, and placed on a staircase which led to the picture\r\ngallery in the Farsetti Palace, where Canova spent much time in study.\r\nThese works have no special excellence.\r\n\r\nAfter a year in Venice he went to Asolo with the Faliero family. Some\r\ntime before this his patron had asked Canova to make for him a group of\r\nOrpheus and Eurydice, taking the moment when Eurydice beholds her lover\r\ntorn away from her forever. Canova had been busy with this in his\r\nleisure hours in Venice, and he took with him to Asolo everything\r\nnecessary to the work. He completed the Eurydice in his sixteenth year;\r\nit was life-size, and cut from _pietra di Costosa_.\r\n\r\nWith this first attempt Canova became convinced that the small models\r\nsuch as were in use by sculptors were quite insufficient to good work,\r\nand he determined that his models should be of the size which the\r\nfinished work would have, even when colossal.\r\n\r\nAfter this time he had his studio in a cell of the monastery of the\r\nAugustine friars attached to the Church of San Stefano, in Venice.\r\nDuring the next three years he was occupied with his Orpheus and a bust\r\nof the Doge Renier. At this time he studied entirely from nature; he\r\ndevoted himself to the pursuit of anatomy, and after a time was\r\naccustomed to make dissections in order to sketch or model from\r\nimportant parts or some conformations that he desired in particular\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 his Orpheus was finished and exhibited, and it chanced to be at\r\nthe annual festival of the Ascension, when the opera of Orpheus was\r\nbrought out in Venice. Canova was accustomed to say that the praise he\r\nthen received was \"that which made him a sculptor;\" and so grateful was\r\nhe for it that later, when he became Marquis of Ischia, he chose for his\r\narmorial ensigns the lyre and serpent which are the mythological symbols\r\nof Orpheus and Eurydice. The Senator Grimani ordered a copy of the\r\nOrpheus, and this was the first work of Canova in Carrara marble.\r\n\r\nHe soon found his workshop too small, and removed to one in the street\r\nof San Maurizio, where he remained until he left his native country. His\r\nnext work was a statue of Æsculapius, larger than life; a short time\r\nbefore his death, when he saw this statue, he sorrowfully declared that\r\n\"his progress had by no means corresponded with the indications of\r\nexcellence in this performance of his youth.\" About this time he\r\nexecuted an Apollo and Daphne which was never entirely finished, and\r\nwhen twenty-two years old he completed a group of Dædalus and Icarus for\r\nthe Senator Pisani. This was intended for an exterior decoration of his\r\npalace; but when it was done Pisani considered it worthy of a place in\r\nhis gallery, already famous on account of the painting of Darius and his\r\nFamily, by Paul Veronese, and other fine works. This may be called\r\nCanova's last work in Venice, as he went to Rome soon after his\r\ntwenty-third birthday.\r\n\r\nThe Cavaliere Zuliani was then the representative of Venice in Rome, and\r\nFaliero gave Canova letters to him. Zuliani was an enlightened patron of\r\nart, and he received the young sculptor with great kindness, and soon\r\narranged to have his model of Dædalus and Icarus exhibited to the best\r\nartists and judges of art in Rome. We can fancy the anxiety with which\r\nCanova went to this exhibition; but the praise which he there received\r\nsecured for him a place among the artists then in Rome.\r\n\r\nCanova had a great desire to undertake a group of some important\r\nsubject, and Zuliani was his friend in this; for he gave him the marble,\r\nand promised if no other purchaser appeared to give him the full value\r\nof the work when completed. He also gave him a workshop in the Venetian\r\nPalace, to which no one had access, where he could be entirely free and\r\nundisturbed. The subject chosen for the group was Theseus vanquishing\r\nthe Minotaur, and the size was to be colossal. Canova now worked with\r\nuntiring devotion; he was often seen before the statues on Monte\r\nCavallo, with sketch-book in hand, as soon as it was light enough for\r\nhim to see, and he studied faithfully in the museums and galleries of\r\nRome. His friends in Venice had secured for him a pension of three\r\nhundred ducats, which placed him above want, and he was free to devote\r\nhimself to his Theseus, although while at work on that he made a statue\r\nof Apollo, which was exhibited with Angelini's Minerva, and received\r\nmuch praise.\r\n\r\nMeantime no one knew of the Theseus save the ambassador. When it was\r\nfinished Zuliani prepared it for exhibition, and invited all the most\r\ndistinguished men in Rome to an entertainment. A model of the head of\r\nTheseus was put in a prominent place, and the guests were busy in\r\ndiscussing it; they asked questions and expressed opinions, and when\r\ntheir interest was well awakened Zuliani said: \"Come, let us end this\r\ndiscussion by seeing the original,\" and the statue was unveiled before\r\ntheir eyes. Canova often declared that death itself could not have been\r\nmore terrible to him than were those moments. But he and all else were\r\nforgotten in the surprise and admiration which the group excited; in\r\nthat hour the artists who afterward hated him gave him their sincere\r\npraise. From that day the fame of Canova was established.\r\n\r\nVery soon he was selected to erect a monument to Clement XIV. This pope\r\nwas a famous man; he was the collector of the Clementine Museum, the\r\nauthor of the elegant letters known by his family name of Ganganelli,\r\nand, above all, he was the suppressor of the Jesuits. While Canova felt\r\nthe honor that was thus offered him he also thought himself bound to\r\nconsult those who had conferred his pension upon him, and thus helped\r\nhim to become the artist that he was. He went, therefore, to Venice\r\nand sought direction from the Senate; he was told to employ his time\r\nas should be most profitable to himself. He therefore gave up his studio\r\nin Venice, and as his patron, Zuliani, had now left Rome, he fitted up\r\nthe studio in the Strada Babbuino, which became so well known to lovers\r\nof art of all nations who visited Rome. In 1787 the above monument was\r\nexhibited, and was much admired. An engraving was made from it and\r\ndedicated to Zuliani; but Canova desired to do something more worthy for\r\nhis patron, and made a statue of Psyche as a gift to him; Zuliani\r\nhesitated to accept it, but finally consented to do so if Canova would\r\nin turn accept a number of silver medals with the Psyche on one side and\r\na head of Canova on the other, which he could give to his friends. In\r\nthe midst of all this Zuliani died, and his heirs were so angry because\r\nhe had left works of art to the Public Library that they refused to\r\ncarry out his plans. In the end the Psyche was bought by Napoleon and\r\npresented to the Queen of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--THE THREE GRACES. _By Canova._]\r\n\r\nCanova executed a second papal monument to Pope Clement XIII. It was\r\nerected in St. Peter's by his nephews. The mourning genius upon it is\r\nfrequently mentioned as one of Canova's happiest figures. The execution\r\nof these two monuments occupied almost ten years of the best part of\r\nthis sculptor's life.\r\n\r\nCanova's fame had extended over all Europe, and he was asked to go to\r\nSt. Petersburg, and offered most advantageous terms if he would do so;\r\nbut he declined, and executed the monument of Admiral Emo, on a\r\ncommission from the Venetian Senate. For this work he received a gold\r\nmedal and an annuity for life.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, during the revolutionary excitement at Rome, Canova went to\r\nPossagno, his native town. Here, in his retirement, he painted more than\r\ntwenty pictures, which were by no means to be despised. His masterpiece\r\nrepresented the Saviour just taken from the cross, and surrounded by\r\nthe Marys, St. John, Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea. This was the\r\nfirst of the many gifts which he made to this little church, by which it\r\nbecame a splendid temple and the expression of Canova's love for his\r\nbirthplace and early home.\r\n\r\nAfter he returned to Rome his health was not sufficient to allow of his\r\nusual close application to work, and he went to Berlin and Vienna in\r\ncompany with Prince Rezzonico, and this so benefited him that he was\r\nable to resume his labors with new energy. He soon achieved a proud\r\ntriumph, for his Perseus was placed in one of the Stanze of the Vatican\r\nby a public decree; this was the first modern work which had been thus\r\nhonored.\r\n\r\nIn 1802-1803 Napoleon requested Canova to go to Paris to model a\r\nportrait bust for a colossal statue; the work was finished six years\r\nlater. In 1805 the artist went again to Vienna, where he modelled a bust\r\nof the Emperor of Austria; in 1810 again to Paris to prepare a model for\r\nthe statue of Maria Louisa. With the exception of these short journeys\r\nhe was constantly at work in his Roman studio until 1815, when he was\r\nsent in an official capacity to France by the pope, for the purpose of\r\nreclaiming the works of art which had been carried from Italy in times\r\nof war, and which really belonged to the patrimony of the Church. Canova\r\nexecuted his commission with rare judgment, and then continued his\r\njourney to England. In London he received many honors; the king gave him\r\nan order for a group, held several conversations with him, made him\r\nvaluable gifts, and intrusted him with a private letter to the pope.\r\n\r\nCanova returned to Rome on January 5th, 1816. His entry might almost be\r\ncalled a triumphal one, for the people of Rome were so grateful for the\r\nrestoration of their treasures that they expressed their joy in\r\ndemonstrations to Canova. He had been President of St. Luke's Academy\r\nbefore; he was now made President of the Commission to purchase works of\r\nart, and of the Academy of Archæology. In full consistory of all the\r\nhigh officers of the Church, the pope caused his name to be inscribed\r\nupon the \"golden volume of the Capitol,\" and conferred upon him the\r\ntitle of Marquis of Ischia, with a pension of three thousand crowns a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCanova now determined to execute a colossal statue of Religion, which\r\nshould commemorate the return of the pope from banishment. He endeavored\r\nto persuade the authorities to decide where it should be placed; this\r\nwas not done, and he was much grieved at his failure to carry out the\r\nidea. But he determined that from this time he would devote his life and\r\nfortune to religion, and resolved to erect a church at Possagno, to\r\nadorn it with works of art, and to make it his own burial-place.\r\n\r\nOn July 8th, 1819, Canova assembled his workmen in his native town, and\r\ngave them a _fête_; many peasant girls joined in the festivities and\r\nassisted in the breaking of the ground; at evening, as they all passed\r\nbefore Canova to bid him farewell, each one received a gift from him.\r\nThree days later the religious ceremony of laying the corner-stone of\r\nthe future church took place. An immense number of people from the\r\nsurrounding country and from Venice were present; Canova, in his robes\r\nas a Knight of Christ, and wearing the insignia of other orders, led the\r\nprocession; all who had seen Canova when a poor boy in their midst were\r\nmuch impressed by this occasion. Here, in a public manner, he\r\nconsecrated his life and fortune to the service of God and the benefit\r\nof his birthplace. Every autumn Canova went to Possagno to encourage the\r\nworkmen and to give directions as to how the whole should be done.\r\nBetween these visits he worked devotedly, for he was forced to earn all\r\nhe could in order to pay for his great undertaking.\r\n\r\nAt this time he executed a statue of Washington, and was making an\r\nequestrian statue of Ferdinand of Naples, and in the month of May, 1822,\r\nwent to that city, where he fell ill; he returned to Rome, and revived\r\nsomewhat, and resumed his work. On September 17th he went to Possagno,\r\nin October to Villa Faliero, where, fifty years before, he had spent\r\nsuch happy days. From here he went to Venice, and on the 13th of the\r\nsame month he died.\r\n\r\nSolemn services were held in the cathedral, and his remains were then\r\nintrusted to the priests of Possagno, who bore them to their temple,\r\nwhere he was buried on the 25th of the month; the crowd was so great\r\nthat the oration was delivered in the open air. Canova's heart was given\r\nto the Academy of Venice, and an elegant little monument was erected in\r\nthe Palace of Arts to contain this relic of the sculptor. The Venetian\r\nartists arranged to erect to him a monument, and chose the design which\r\nhe himself had made for the tomb of Titian; it is in the Church of Santa\r\nMaria de' Frari. In Rome a statue was decreed to him, and he was\r\ndeclared the perpetual President of her chief academy.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance Canova was not grand or very attractive. His head\r\nwas remarkably well placed upon his shoulders, and the loose manner in\r\nwhich he dressed his neck allowed this to be seen; his forehead was a\r\nnoble one, his hair black, and his whole manner and dress was modest and\r\nsimple. His habits were very orderly and quiet; he rose early to work,\r\nand went little into public society; but he welcomed a few friends to\r\ndinner almost daily. He entertained them cordially, but without display,\r\nand led the conversation to light, cheerful topics that did not touch\r\nupon art, or demand mental exertion. At eleven o'clock he retired to his\r\nown room and amused himself with a book or pencil before sleeping. Some\r\nof his best drawings were made at this hour, and have been published\r\nwith the title of \"Pensieri,\" or thoughts. To describe one day was to\r\ngive a picture of all, so regular were his habits of life.\r\n\r\nIn his professional life he was just and generous to others, and though\r\nhe would have no pupils, he would leave everything to advise an artist\r\nor visit his works. He was also a patron of art, and had executed, at\r\nhis own expense, the numerous busts of distinguished persons in the\r\nCapitoline Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--HEBE. _By Canova._]\r\n\r\nThere is a story of a romance in his life. It is said that when he first\r\narrived in Venice he fell in love with a beautiful girl who was older\r\nthan himself, who went to draw in the Farsetti Gallery. Day by day he\r\nwatched her until she came no more; at length her attendant returned,\r\nand Canova inquired for her mistress; she burst into tears and answered,\r\n\"La Signora Julia is dead.\" He asked no more, and never knew who Julia\r\nwas or any circumstances of her history; but all his life he treasured\r\nher image, and when he endeavored to unite the purity of an angel with\r\nthe earthly beauty of a woman, the remembrance of Julia was always in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nCanova was one of the few artists who received their full merit of\r\npraise and the benefits of their labors while alive. Without doubt he\r\nwas a great sculptor, and coming as he did, at a time when art was at\r\nits worst, he seemed all the more remarkable to the men around him. But\r\nthe verdict of to-day would not exalt him as highly as did his friends\r\nand patrons. His statues lack the repose which makes the grandest\r\nfeature of the best sculpture; his female figures have a sentimental\r\nsort of air that is not all we could wish, and does not elevate them\r\nabove what we may call pleasing art. His male figures are better, more\r\nnatural and simple, though some of his subjects bordered on the coarse\r\nand brutal, as in the two fencers, Kreugas and Damoxenes, or Hercules\r\nand Lichas. But in his religious subjects he is much finer, and in some\r\nof his monuments he shows dignity and earnestness, while his composition\r\nis in the true artistic spirit. Taken on the whole, he was a wonderful\r\nartist and a man of whom his century might well be proud.\r\n\r\nOther sculptors of this period and of different nations studied at Rome,\r\nand devoted themselves to the antique with enthusiasm. One of these was\r\nANTOINE DENIS CHAUDET (1763-1810), who was born at Paris. His talent was\r\nso early developed that he was admitted to the Royal Academy when\r\nfourteen years old, and when twenty-one he gained the first prize, and\r\nwith the royal pension went to Rome, where he remained five years. He\r\nsoon took good rank among artists of that time, for he was a designer\r\nand painter as well as sculptor. He adhered strictly to the antique\r\nstyle, and attained much purity, though he was always cold in treatment.\r\nHe was made a Professor of Sculpture in the French Academy, and made\r\nvaluable contributions to the \"Dictionary of Fine Arts.\"\r\n\r\nChaudet's principal works in sculpture were the silver statue of Peace\r\nin the Tuileries; a statue of Cincinnatus in the Senate Chamber; a\r\nstatue of OEdipus; a bas-relief of Painting, Sculpture, and\r\nArchitecture, in the Musée Napoléon, and many busts and smaller works.\r\n\r\nHe also designed numerous medals and some of the illustrations for a\r\nfine edition of Racine, and painted a picture of Æneas and Anchises in\r\nthe Burning of Troy.\r\n\r\nJOHANN HEINRICH DANNECKER (1758-1841) was born at Stuttgart. By a statue\r\nof Milo he gained the prize of the academy founded by Duke Charles\r\nEugene, and with the royal pension he went first to Paris and then to\r\nRome, where he studied seven years. He then returned to Würtemberg, and\r\nwas made Director of the Royal Academy, with a salary of fifteen\r\nthousand francs a year. During fifteen years Dannecker maintained a high\r\nrank in his art, but his health became so feeble that he was forced to\r\nsee others excel him. One of his works has a wide reputation, and is\r\nknown to many people the world over, through the generosity of Herr\r\nBethmann of Frankfort, who admits visitors to his gallery, and from the\r\nmodels and pictures which have been made from it; it is the Ariadne on a\r\nPanther (Fig. 117).\r\n\r\nDannecker had a delicate feeling for nature; his figures were light and\r\ngraceful, and his heads were noble in expression. He labored eight years\r\nupon a figure of Christ, which belongs to the Emperor of Russia; in\r\nStuttgart a nymph pouring water on Neckar Street and two nymphs on a\r\nreservoir in the palace garden show his fine taste in architectural\r\nsculpture. Among his other works are a statue of Alexander, a monument\r\nto Count Zeppelin, a Cupid, and a Maiden lamenting a Dead Bird. Some of\r\nhis works are among the very best productions of modern sculpture; his\r\nportraits are noble and true to nature; the works named here are by no\r\nmeans all that he did, and we should add that his efforts in religious\r\nsubjects exhibit a pure sense of the beautiful, and a true conception of\r\nChristian ideas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--ARIADNE AND THE PANTHER. _By Dannecker._]\r\n\r\nWe come now, for the first time, to a great English sculptor. JOHN\r\nFLAXMAN (1755-1826) was born in York, but while he was still an infant\r\nhis father removed to London, where he kept a plaster-cast shop. The boy\r\nbegan to draw and even to model very early; when but five years old he\r\nkept some soft wax, with which he could take an impression from any seal\r\nor ring or coin which pleased him. He was very delicate in health, and\r\nwas once thought to be dead, and was prepared for burial, when animation\r\nreturned; his parents tried to gratify all his wishes, and while a child\r\nhe modelled a great number of figures in wax, clay, and plaster.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was ten years old he was much stronger, and was able to\r\nuse the activity which corresponded to his enthusiastic feeling and\r\nimagination. About this time he read \"Don Quixote,\" and was so moved by\r\nthe adventures of that hero that he went out early one morning armed\r\nwith a toy sword and bent upon protecting some forlorn damsel; he went\r\nto Hyde Park and wandered about all day, not finding any one who was in\r\nneed of his services. At night he returned home, very hungry and weary,\r\nto find his family in great alarm over his unusual absence.\r\n\r\nHe now spent all his time in drawing and modelling, and never had more\r\nthan two lessons from a master; at eleven years of age he began to gain\r\nvarious prizes, and at fourteen was admitted to study at the Royal\r\nAcademy, and gained the silver medal there that same year. About this\r\ntime he made some friends who aided him to study the classics and to\r\nlearn more of history, all of which was of great use to him in his art.\r\nHe was also fortunate in having the friendship of Mr. Wedgwood, for whom\r\nhe made many models. He also painted a few pictures in oil.\r\n\r\nAmong his earliest sculptures were a group of Venus and Cupid and a\r\nmonument to Mrs. Morley, who, with her baby, died at sea. Flaxman\r\nrepresented the mother and child rising from the sea and being received\r\nby descending angels.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 Flaxman married Miss Ann Denman, whose intelligence and love of\r\nart were of great assistance to her husband. In 1787 he went to Rome,\r\nwhere he remained seven years. During this time he made a group for Lord\r\nBristol, representing the Fury of Athamas, from the Metamorphoses of\r\nOvid; this work cost him much labor, for which he received but small\r\npay; it was carried to Ireland and then to Ickworth House, in Suffolk,\r\nwhere but few people see it. In Rome Flaxman also made a group of\r\nCephalus and Aurora for Mr. Thomas Hope, and the designs from Homer,\r\nÆschylus, and Dante, which have such a world-wide fame.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 he returned to England, where he was constantly employed on\r\nimportant works until his death. We cannot give a list of his numerous\r\nworks. Many of his monuments are seen in the churches of England. In\r\nGlasgow are his statues of Mr. Pitt and Sir John Moore, in bronze; in\r\nEdinburgh is that of Robert Burns. Flaxman executed much sculpture for\r\nthe East Indies, one of these works being unfinished when he died. Some\r\ncritics consider his Archangel Michael and Satan his best work; it was\r\nmade for the Earl of Egremont, who had his life-size Apollo also.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Flaxman was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, in 1800\r\nan Academician, and in 1810, when a Professor of Sculpture was added to\r\nthe other professors of the Academy, he was appointed to the office. His\r\nlectures have been published. The friezes on the Covent Garden Theatre\r\nwere all designed by Flaxman, and he executed the figure of Comedy\r\nhimself. His last work was making designs for the exterior decoration of\r\nBuckingham Palace, which would have been entirely under his direction\r\nand partly executed by him if he had lived.\r\n\r\nHis wife died in 1820, and her loss was a grief from which he could not\r\nrecover; she had been a great advantage to him, and he had depended much\r\nupon her sympathy and counsel. Flaxman was a singularly pure man, and so\r\nattractive in manner that he was the friend of old and young alike.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Westmacott succeeded Flaxman as Professor at the Royal\r\nAcademy; he said: \"But the greatest of modern sculptors was our\r\nillustrious countryman, John Flaxman, who not only had all the fine\r\nfeeling of the ancient Greeks (which Canova in a degree possessed), but\r\nunited to it a readiness of invention and a simplicity of design truly\r\nastonishing. Though Canova was his superior in the manual part, high\r\nfinishing, yet in the higher qualities, poetical feeling and invention,\r\nFlaxman was as superior to Canova as was Shakespeare to the dramatists\r\nof his day.\"\r\n\r\nBut the perfection of the results of the study of Canova and others who\r\nendeavored to raise sculpture to its ancient glory was seen in the Dane,\r\nBERTEL THORWALDSEN (1770-1844), who was born in Copenhagen. The descent\r\nof this artist has been traced to memorable sources in two quite\r\ndistinct ways. Those who claim that the Norsemen discovered America\r\nrelate that during their stay upon this coast a child was born, from\r\nwhom Thorwaldsen's descent can be distinctly followed. The learned\r\ngenealogists of Iceland say that his ancestors were descended from\r\nHarald Hildetand, King of Denmark, who, in the eighth century, was\r\nobliged to flee, first to Norway and then to Iceland, and that one of\r\nhis descendants, Oluf Paa, in the twelfth century, was a famous\r\nwood-carver. But this much is certain: in the fourteenth century there\r\nlived in Southern Iceland a wealthy man, whose family and descendants\r\nwere much honored. One of these, Thorvald Gottskalken, a pastor, had\r\ntwo sons and but a small fortune; so he sent his sons to Copenhagen,\r\nwhere one became a jeweller and died young; the other, who was a\r\nwood-carver, was the father of the artist, whose mother was Karen\r\nGröulund, the daughter of a Jutland peasant.\r\n\r\nThe father was employed in a shipyard, and carved only the rude\r\nornaments of vessels and boats; but these served to lead the mind of the\r\nlittle Bertel to the art he later followed. His father could not have\r\ndreamed of such a future as came to his son, but he was wise enough to\r\nknow that the boy might do more and better than he had done, and he sent\r\nhim, when eleven years old, to the free school of the Royal Academy to\r\nstudy drawing; and very soon the works of the father showed the gain\r\nwhich the son had made, for his designs were those now used by the old\r\nwood-carver.\r\n\r\nBertel was also sent to study his books at the school of Charlottenburg,\r\nand here he was so far from clever that he was put in the lowest class.\r\nWhen Bertel gained his first prize at the academy the chaplain of the\r\nschool at Charlottenburg asked him if the boy who had taken the prize\r\nwas his brother. He looked up with surprise, and blushing, said, \"It is\r\nmyself, Herr Chaplain.\" The priest was astounded at this, and said,\r\n\"Herr Thorwaldsen, please to pass up to the first class.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was amazed at these honors, and from this day retained the title\r\nof \"Herr,\" which gave him much distinction. When, after many years, the\r\nsculptor had been loaded with honors, and stood on the heights of fame,\r\nhe was accustomed to say that no glory had ever been so sweet to him as\r\nthat first rapture which came from the words of the Chaplain Höyer when\r\nhe was seventeen years old and a poor school-boy.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this first prize seemed to be to rouse his ambition, and\r\nhe worked with the greatest diligence and earnestness. Two years later\r\nhe made a bas-relief of Love in Repose, which took the large silver\r\nmedal. His father now thought him prepared to enter on the life of a\r\nship's carver, and Bertel made no objection to doing so; but the painter\r\nAbildgaard, who had been his teacher in the academy, had grown very fond\r\nof him, and saw how much talent he had, and could not think of his being\r\nbut a common tradesman without deep regret. He went, therefore, to the\r\nold carver, and after some difficulty obtained his consent that his son\r\nshould spend half his time in study at the academy, and the other half\r\nin the earning of his daily bread at his father's side.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, when twenty years old, Thorwaldsen made a medallion of the\r\nPrincess of Denmark, which was so good a likeness that a number of\r\ncopies was sold. A year later he gained the small gold medal of the\r\nacademy by a bas-relief of the Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple.\r\nThe Minister of State now became interested in the young artist, and\r\nmeasures were taken to aid him to go on with his studies. His patrons\r\ndesired him to study the subjects of the antique sculptures, and he\r\nchose that of Priam begging the Body of Hector from Achilles. Later in\r\nlife he repeated this subject, and it is interesting to notice the\r\nstrength and grandeur of the second when compared with the weakness of\r\nthe first. And yet it was from the latter that predictions were made of\r\nThorwaldsen's future greatness. In 1793 he gained the prize which\r\nentitled him to travel and study three years at the expense of the\r\nacademy. The work he presented was a bas-relief of Saint Peter healing\r\nthe Paralytic. In these works this sculptor already showed two qualities\r\nwhich remained the same through his life; in his subjects from antiquity\r\nhe showed a Greek spirit, which has led some writers to speak of him as\r\na \"posthumous Greek,\" or a true Greek artist born after other Greek\r\nartists had died; on the other hand, when he treated religious subjects\r\nhis spirit was like that of the best masters of the Renaissance, and\r\nthese works remind us of Raphael. All this excellence came entirely from\r\nhis artistic nature, for outside of that he was ignorant; he knew\r\nnothing of history or literature, and was never a man of culture as long\r\nas he lived. Outside of the work connected with his profession\r\nThorwaldsen was indolent, and only acquired knowledge of other matters\r\nthrough observation or from the conversation of others.\r\n\r\nAlthough he gained the prize which allowed him to travel in 1793, he did\r\nnot leave Copenhagen until May, 1796. In the mean time he had done what\r\nhe could to earn something: he had made designs for book-publishers,\r\ngiven lessons in drawing and modelling, and made some bust and medallion\r\nportraits, reliefs, and so on. The vessel in which the young sculptor\r\nsailed for Naples was called the Thetis, and the captain engaged to\r\nwatch over him; the voyage was long, and all on board became fond of\r\nThorwaldsen, though the captain wrote, \"He is an honest boy, but a lazy\r\nrascal.\" This opinion is very amusing when we know what an enormous\r\namount of labor he performed. At Naples he remained for some time, and\r\nsaw and admired all its works of art. He did not reach Rome until about\r\nnine months after leaving Copenhagen, but from that time his whole\r\nthought and life were changed. He was accustomed to say, \"I was born on\r\nthe 8th of March, 1797; before then I did not exist.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Naples Thorwaldsen had been ill, and suffered from a malarial\r\naffection, which compelled him to be idle much of the time. But he was\r\nalways studying the antique statues, and made many copies. Some of the\r\nfirst original works which he attempted were failures, when, at last, he\r\nmodelled a colossal statue of Jason, which was well received by those\r\nwho saw it, and made him somewhat famous in Rome (Fig. 118). Canova\r\npraised it, and other critics did the same; but Thorwaldsen had no\r\nmoney; the academy had supported him six years; what could he do? Quite\r\ndiscouraged, he was engaged in his preparations for leaving Rome, when\r\nMr. Thomas Hope, the English banker, gave him an order for the Jason in\r\nmarble. In an hour his life was changed. He was living in Rome not as a\r\nstudent on charity, but as an artist gaining his living. We are forced\r\nto add that Mr. Hope did not receive this statue until 1828, and\r\nThorwaldsen has been much blamed for his apparent ingratitude; but we\r\ncannot here give all the details of the unfortunate affair.\r\n\r\nThorwaldsen had a true and faithful friend in Rome, the archæologist\r\nZoëga; at his house the young Dane had met a beautiful Italian girl,\r\nAnna Maria Magnani, whom he loved devotedly. She was too ambitious to\r\nmarry a poor sculptor, so she married a rich M. d'Uhden; but she\r\npersuaded Thorwaldsen to sign an agreement by which he bound himself to\r\ntake care of her if she should not agree with her husband and should\r\nleave him; this was just what happened in 1803, and the sculptor\r\nreceived her into his house, where she remained sixteen years, when she\r\ndisappears from his life. He provided an honorable marriage for their\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--JASON. _By Thorwaldsen._]\r\n\r\nIn 1803 Thorwaldsen also made the acquaintance of the Baron von\r\nSchubart, the Danish Minister, who presented the sculptor to Baron von\r\nHumboldt; and through the friendship of these two men, and the persons\r\nto whom they presented him, Thorwaldsen received many orders. In 1804\r\nhis fame had become so well established that he received orders from all\r\ncountries, and from this time, during the rest of his life, he was never\r\nable to do all that was required of him. He was much courted in society,\r\nwhere he was praised for his art and beloved for his agreeable and\r\npleasing manner. In this same year he was made a Professor of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Florence; and though the Academy of Copenhagen expected his\r\nreturn, they would not recall him from the scene of his triumphs, and\r\nsent him a gift of four hundred crowns. A few months later he was made a\r\nmember of the Academy of Bologna and of that of his native city, in\r\nwhich last he was also appointed a Professor.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances conspired to increase his popularity and to excite\r\nthe popular interest in him, when, in 1805, he produced the bas-relief\r\nof the Abduction of Briseis, which still remains one of his most\r\ncelebrated works. His Jason had put him on a level with Canova, who was\r\nthen at the height of his fame; now the Briseis was said by many to\r\nexcel the same type of works by Canova, and there is no question that in\r\nbas-relief the Dane was the better sculptor of the two. This relief and\r\nhis group of Cupid and Psyche, which was completed in 1805, mark the era\r\nat which Thorwaldsen reached his full perfection as a sculptor. In this\r\nsame year he modelled his first statue of Venus; it was less than\r\nlife-size; and though two copies of it were finished in marble, he was\r\nnot pleased with it, and destroyed the model: later he made the same\r\nstatue in full size.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 he received his first commission for religious subjects, which\r\nconsisted of two baptismal fonts for a church in the island of Fionia.\r\nBut he was devoted to mythological subjects, and preferred them before\r\nall others, and in this same year modelled a Hebe while engaged upon\r\nthe fonts. His industry was great, but he found time to receive many\r\nvisitors at his studio, and went frequently into society. At the house\r\nof Baron von Humboldt, then Prussian Ambassador at Rome, Thorwaldsen was\r\nalways welcome and happy; here he met all persons of note who lived in\r\nor who visited Rome.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that the young Prince Louis of Bavaria entered\r\ninto a correspondence with Thorwaldsen, which ended only with the\r\nsculptor's life. Louis was collecting objects for his Glyptothek at\r\nMunich, and he frequently consulted Thorwaldsen in these matters; his\r\nadvice was of value, and he more than once saved Louis from imposition\r\nby dealers. Louis gave the sculptor the order for the fine Adonis, now\r\nin the Glyptothek; it was modelled in 1808, but was not completed until\r\n1832; this splendid work was executed entirely by Thorwaldsen's own\r\nhands. In 1808 he also received the order for four bas-reliefs to be\r\nused in the restoration of the Palace of Christiansborg, which had been\r\ninjured by fire. This was the year, too, when he was made an honorary\r\nmember of the Academy of St. Luke.\r\n\r\nThe year 1809 brought deep sorrows to Thorwaldsen in the death of his\r\ntwo friends, Stanley and Zoëga. He interested himself in the settlement\r\nof the affairs of the latter, and had much trouble and anxiety; but he\r\nmanaged to accomplish the modelling of six bas-reliefs in this year, in\r\nspite of the disturbed state of Rome on account of the pope's departure,\r\nand in spite of the hindrances in his own life.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the King of Denmark made Thorwaldsen a Knight of Danebrog, and\r\nhe was then known in Italy as the _Cavaliere Alberto_. His work this\r\nyear was in bas-reliefs, and in 1811 he modelled a colossal statue of\r\nMars, the bust of Mademoiselle Ida Brun, a lovely statue of Psyche, and\r\nhis own portrait as a colossal Hermes.\r\n\r\nThe people of Denmark were growing very impatient at the prolonged\r\nabsence of their artist. He had left home a mere boy, and was now famous\r\nover all the world. They wished for his return; a marble quarry had been\r\ndiscovered in Norway, and even Prince Christian Frederick wrote to\r\nThorwaldsen to urge his going home. The sculptor wished to go, and even\r\nmade some preparations to do so, when he received so important a\r\ncommission that it was impossible to leave Rome. This new work was a\r\nfrieze for one of the great halls in the Quirinal Palace. He chose the\r\nEntrance of Alexander the Great into Babylon for his subject, and it\r\nproved to be one of the most important works of his life. It was\r\ncompleted in June, 1812; and though it had been somewhat criticised as\r\ntoo rough in its finish, when it was elevated to its proper height it\r\nwas all that had been expected by the artist's friends; later he\r\nrepeated this frieze for his own countrymen. In Rome he was now\r\nfrequently called the \"Patriarch of Bas-relief.\" Soon after this he was\r\nmade a member of the Imperial Academy of Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 Thorwaldsen was again a victim of malignant fever, and visited\r\nthe baths of Lucca, in company with the Baron and Baroness von Schubart,\r\nfor the benefit of his health. He met many people and received much\r\nhonor, especially from the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. His health was\r\nimproved, but his old and tried friend, the Baroness von Schubart, died\r\nthe winter following; he felt her loss deeply, for she had been his\r\nfriend and confidante from the time of his arrival in Rome.\r\n\r\nHe was always busy, and one after another of his almost numberless works\r\nwas finished. In 1815 he made the Achilles and Priam, a relief which is\r\nsometimes called his masterpiece; in the same year he made the famous\r\nand familiar medallions of Night and Morning; it is said that he\r\nconceived the first while awake in a sleepless, restless condition, and\r\nmodelled it entirely on the following day; these medallions have been\r\nreproduced in all possible forms--in engravings, on cameos, gems, in\r\nmetals, and a variety of marble, plaster, and porcelain.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Thorwaldsen removed to a spacious studio with gardens,\r\nand received pupils, and was overwhelmed with orders, so that he could\r\nnot yet go to Denmark, in spite of the urgent letters he received. He\r\nexecuted many important original works, and also restored the marbles of\r\nÆgina, now at Munich; this was a great task, but his study of the\r\nantique had made him better able to do it than was any other modern\r\nsculptor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--GANYMEDE AND THE EAGLE. _By Thorwaldsen._]\r\n\r\nThe exquisite group of Ganymede and the Eagle (Fig. 119) shows the\r\neffect of his study of the antique, and the same may be said of his\r\nstatue of Hope, a small copy of which was afterward placed above the\r\ntomb of the Baroness von Humboldt. The Three Graces (Fig. 120) belongs\r\nto the year 1817; the Mercury was of about this date, as well as the\r\nelegant statue of the Princess Baryatinska, which is his finest portrait\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence from Denmark of twenty-three years he left Rome in\r\nJuly, 1819, and turned his face toward home. His model for the famous\r\nLion of Lucerne had already been sent on before him, and the work\r\ncommenced by one of his pupils, Bienaimé. Thorwaldsen first went to\r\nLucerne, where he gave all necessary advice in this work, and then\r\nproceeding on his journey reached Copenhagen on the 3d of October.\r\nApartments had been prepared for him in the Academy of Fine Arts, and as\r\nsoon as it was known that he was there he was the centre of attraction\r\nand importance. Crowds went to welcome him to his home. A great\r\nreception and a grand banquet were given in his honor, and he was lauded\r\nto the skies in speeches, and was made a Counsellor of State, in order\r\nthat he might sit at table with the royal family and not violate the\r\ncourt etiquette.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--THE THREE GRACES. _By Thorwaldsen._]\r\n\r\nAll this must have gratified the artist, who had earned such proud\r\nhonors by the force of his genius; but it interests us much more to know\r\nthat he received commissions for some very important works, among which\r\nthose of the Church of Our Lady are very interesting. The orders for all\r\nthe work which he did here were not given at once, but in the end it\r\nbecame a splendid monument to this sculptor, and embraces almost all his\r\nreligious works of any importance. There are the figures of Christ and\r\nthe Twelve Apostles; the Angel of Baptism, which is an exquisite font;\r\nthe Preaching of St. John the Baptist, which is a group in terra-cotta\r\non the pediment of the church; a bas-relief in marble of the\r\nInstitution of the Lord's Supper; another in plaster of Christ's Entry\r\ninto Jerusalem; one of Christ Bearing the Cross; one of the Baptism of\r\nChrist; another of the Guardian Angel, and one of Christian Charity.\r\n\r\nHe did not remain very long in Denmark, but went to Warsaw, where he had\r\nbeen summoned to arrange for some important works. He was presented to\r\nthe Emperor Alexander, who gave him sittings for a portrait bust; this\r\nwas so successful that for some years Thorwaldsen employed skilled\r\nworkmen to constantly repeat it, in order to fill the demand for it\r\nwhich was made upon him. While at Warsaw he received an order for a\r\nmonument to Copernicus, which was dedicated in 1830; other important\r\ncommissions were given him, and after visiting Cracow, Troppau, and\r\nVienna, he reached Rome in December, 1820, where he was heartily\r\nwelcomed by the artists, who gave him a banquet, on which occasion the\r\nPrince Royal of Denmark sat next to the sculptor.\r\n\r\nBefore this a correspondence had established a friendship between\r\nThorwaldsen and Prince Louis of Bavaria; but from the year 1821 intimate\r\npersonal relations existed between them. He took up work with great\r\nenergy; he had returned to Rome with so much to do that he required much\r\nroom, and employed a large company of workmen. In the summer of 1822 he\r\nwas able to secure a large building which had been used for a stable to\r\nthe Barberini Palace, and here he was able to set up all his large\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Thorwaldsen was summoned by the Cardinal Consalvi, who gave him\r\nthe commission for the monument to Pius VII., now in the Clementine\r\nChapel of St. Peter's at Rome; this work was not completed when the\r\ncardinal himself died, and his own monument by Thorwaldsen was placed in\r\nthe Pantheon before that of Pius VII. was put in its place. He also made\r\na cross for the Capuchins for which he would accept no reward, though\r\nthey were entirely satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Thorwaldsen was elected President of the Academy of St. Luke\r\nwith the advice and consent of Pope Leo XII., who paid him a visit in\r\nhis studio. Many delays occurred, and the monument to Pius VII. was not\r\nerected until 1831.\r\n\r\nThe works upon which the artist and his assistants were engaged were far\r\ntoo numerous to be mentioned; he was at the very height of fame and\r\npopularity, and was forced to refuse some of the commissions sent him.\r\nIn 1830 he went to Munich to superintend the setting up of his monument\r\nto Eugène Beauharnais, the Duke of Leuchtenberg. This gave Louis of\r\nBavaria an opportunity to show his regard for the sculptor, which he did\r\nin every possible way. Soon after the monument was unveiled Thorwaldsen\r\nreceived the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nThorwaldsen's place in Rome was a very important one, not only as an\r\nartist, but as a man. He had the respect and esteem of many good men of\r\nall nations; he also suffered some things from the envy of those who\r\nwere jealous of him, as is the case with all successful men; but he was\r\na fearless person, and did not trouble himself on account of these\r\nthings. The frequent agitations of a political nature, however, did\r\ndisturb him, and he began to think seriously of returning to Denmark. In\r\n1837, when the cholera broke out in Rome, he determined to leave; his\r\ncountrymen were delighted, and a government frigate was sent to take him\r\nhome; he sailed from Leghorn in August, 1838. His arrival was hailed\r\nwith joy in Denmark, and wherever he went his progress was marked by\r\ntokens of the pride which his countrymen felt in him. As soon as it was\r\nknown in Copenhagen, on September 17th, that the \"Rota,\" which brought\r\nthe sculptor, was in the harbor, a flag was run up from St. Nicolas\r\nChurch as a signal for the beginning of the festivities which had been\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nAlthough it rained heavily, boats filled with artists, poets, students,\r\nphysicians, mechanics, and naval officers went out to meet him; each\r\nboat had a flag with an appropriate device, that of the artists having\r\nThorwaldsen's Three Graces, the poets, a Pegasus, and so on. The meeting\r\nwith his friends on the deck of the ship was a pleasant surprise to the\r\nartist, who was hurried ashore amid the firing of salutes and all sorts\r\nof joyous demonstrations, a vast number of boats rowing after that in\r\nwhich he was seated. His carriage was drawn by the people from the quay\r\nto Charlottenburg, where a vast crowd assembled to get a sight at him.\r\nHis form was tall and erect, his step firm; his long white hair fell on\r\nhis shoulders, and his clear eye and benevolent face beamed with\r\nintelligence and sympathetic interest in all around him. He was led out\r\non a balcony, where, uncovered, he saluted the people, who greeted him\r\nwith wild applause. Thorwaldsen smiled and said, \"Would not any one\r\nthink that we were in Rome, and I were the pope about to give the\r\nbenediction _urbi et orbi_ from the balcony of St. Peter's?\"\r\n\r\nOne ovation after another followed, day by day, and such crowds of\r\nvisitors went to see him that he was unable to unpack and arrange his\r\npossessions which he had brought from Italy, or to work at all, which\r\nwas worse to him. At last he began to do as he had done in Rome, and to\r\nreceive his friends with his chisel or modelling-stick in hand. He\r\nlived frugally, and continued many of his Roman habits of life; but he\r\nwas forced to dine out every evening.\r\n\r\nHe was now sixty-eight years old, but he did a vast amount of work in\r\none way and another, and was so pursued by all sorts of people who\r\nwished to engage his attention in a variety of projects, that he\r\nseriously considered the question of leaving Copenhagen. He became very\r\nfond of certain families where he visited, among which was that of the\r\nBaron von Stampe, who, with his wife and children, were soon treated by\r\nthe sculptor as if they were his own kindred. He went with them to their\r\nsummer home at Nysoë, and while there the baroness persuaded him to\r\nmodel his own statue. He did this imperfectly, as he had no suitable\r\nworkshop; and when the baroness saw his difficulty in working in an\r\nordinary room she had a studio built for him in a garden near the\r\ncastle. She took the time to do this when Thorwaldsen was absent for\r\neight days, and in this short space the whole was completed, so that\r\nwhen he returned it seemed to him like magic. This studio was dedicated\r\nin July, 1839.\r\n\r\nHe then began the proper modelling of his own statue, and was\r\nprogressing very well when he received a letter from the poet\r\nOehlenschlaeger, who was in great haste to have a portrait bust made of\r\nhimself. Thorwaldsen felt that he ought not to make his own statue when\r\nthus wanted for other work, and he threw down his tools, and would have\r\nbroken the model. But the baroness succeeded in getting him away, and\r\nlocked the studio, keeping the key. However, no argument or entreaty\r\nwould move the sculptor, and she could do nothing with him until she\r\nhappened to think of crying. When she began to weep and to accuse him of\r\nhaving no affection for her, and reminded him of the proofs of her\r\ndevotion which she had given him, he was taken in by her mock tears, and\r\nexclaimed, \"Well, they may think what they like. My statue is not for\r\nposterity, but I cannot refuse it to a friend to whom it will give such\r\npleasure.\" He then resumed his work, and completed his statue in\r\nseventeen days. He represented himself standing with one arm resting\r\nupon his statue of Hope.\r\n\r\nAfter this summer Thorwaldsen divided his time between Copenhagen and\r\nStampeborg, and worked with the same industry in one place as in the\r\nother. The life in the country was a great delight to him; he played\r\ngames, listened to fairy tales from the poet Andersen, or to music from\r\nthe young girls of the house, all with equal pleasure; and if he were\r\nallowed to have his mornings for work he would spend the rest of the day\r\nin the woods or pay visits, and was perfectly happy in this succession\r\nof labor and leisure.\r\n\r\nBaroness Stampe did not stop at one trick upon the old artist, for she\r\nfound it more easy to gain a point in this way than by argument. He had\r\npromised to execute a statue of Christian IV. for Christian VIII., the\r\nreigning king; he put it off until the king was impatient. One day, when\r\nhe had gone for a walk, the baroness went to the studio and began a\r\nsketch in clay as well as she could. When Thorwaldsen returned he asked\r\nwhat she was doing, and she answered, \"I am making the statue of the\r\nking. Since you will not do it, and I have pledged my word, I must do it\r\nmyself.\" The artist laughed, and began to criticise her work; she\r\ninsisted it was all right, and at last said, \"Do it better, then,\r\nyourself; you make fun of me; I defy you to find anything to change in\r\nmy work.\" Thorwaldsen was thus led on to correct the model, and when\r\nonce he had begun he finished it.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give any account here of the numerous\r\nincidents in the later years of the life of this sculptor; of the honors\r\nhe received, of the many works he was consulted about and asked to do,\r\nof the visits he paid and received from persons of note; few lives are\r\nas full as was his, and the detailed accounts of it are very\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nHe had always desired to go again to Rome, and in 1841, when the Baron\r\nvon Stampe decided to go there with his family, Thorwaldsen travelled\r\nwith them. They went through Germany, and were everywhere received as\r\nhonorably as if he were a royal person: he was invited to visit royal\r\nfamilies; court carriages were at his service; Mendelssohn gave a\r\nmusical _fête_ for him; in all the great cities he was shown the places\r\nand objects worthy of his attention; poets and orators paid him respect,\r\nand nothing that could be done to show appreciation of his genius and\r\nhis works was omitted.\r\n\r\nIn Rome it was the same; he remained there almost a year, and upon his\r\narrival at Copenhagen, in October, 1842, he experienced the crowning\r\nglory of his life. During his absence the Thorwaldsen Museum had been\r\ncompleted, and here, the day after he reached home, he was received. The\r\nbuilding was decorated with garlands, and he went over the whole of it;\r\nat last he entered the inner court, where he was to be buried; here he\r\nstood for some time with bowed head, while all about him kept silence.\r\nCan any one fancy the thoughts that must have come to him? Here he must\r\nbe buried, and yet here would he live in the works of his hand which\r\nwould surround him and remain to testify to his immortal powers.\r\n\r\nHe lived three years more, and was always busy. His mind was strong and\r\nhis conceptions of his subjects had lost nothing, but his ability to\r\nexecute his works was less; his hand had lost somewhat of its cunning.\r\nHe went much into society, was fond of the theatre, and under the\r\ndevoted care of his servant, Wilkens, he enjoyed all that was possible\r\nto a man of his age. On the 24th of March 1844, the Baroness von Stampe\r\nwent to ask him to dine at her house; he said he was not well and would\r\nnot go out; but as his daughter was to be there and expected him he\r\ndecided to go. He was modelling a bust of Luther, and threw down before\r\nit a handful of clay and stuck a trowel in it; just so, as he left it,\r\nthis now stands in the museum, preserved under glass, with the print of\r\nhis hand in the clay.\r\n\r\nHe was merry at dinner, and in speaking of the museum said he could die\r\nnow, whenever he chose, since the architect Bindesböll had finished his\r\ntomb. After dinner he went to the theatre, and there it was seen that he\r\nwas really ill; he was taken out with haste and laid upon a sofa, when\r\nit was found that he was already dead. The Charlottenburg joined the\r\ntheatre, and there, in the hall of antique sculpture, he was laid. He\r\nwas first buried in the Frue Kirke, which he had so splendidly\r\ndecorated; four years later he was borne to the vault in the centre of\r\nthe Thorwaldsen Museum, where above him grows the evergreen ivy, a\r\nfitting emblem of his unfading fame.\r\n\r\nThiele, in his splendid book called \"Thorwaldsen and his Works,\" gives a\r\nlist of two hundred and sixty works by this master; and as one journeys\r\nfrom Rome, where are some of his sculptures in St. Peter's and the\r\nQuirinal, to Copenhagen, with the Frue Kirke and the Museum, one passes\r\nthrough few cities that are not adorned by his statues and reliefs.\r\nAmong his most important works are the frieze of Alexander's entrance\r\ninto Babylon, at the Quirinal; the Lion of Lucerne; the many statues,\r\ngroups, and bas-reliefs in the Frue Kirke; more than thirty sepulchral\r\nand commemorative monuments in various cities and countries; sixteen\r\nbas-reliefs which illustrate the story of Cupid and Psyche; twenty\r\nbas-reliefs of Genii; twenty-two figures from antique fables, and many\r\nportrait busts and statues, and various other subjects.\r\n\r\nThorwaldsen was a very remarkable man. No circumstance of his youth\r\nindicated his success, and a certain indolence which he had would have\r\nseemed to forbid it; but the power was within him, and was of that\r\ngenuine quality which will declare itself; and a man who has it becomes\r\ngreat without intending to be so, and almost without believing that he\r\nis remarkable beyond others. The true antique spirit seems to have been\r\nrevived in him. His characteristics as a sculptor are severe simplicity,\r\nperfect beauty in form, distinctness, and repose. Thiele says of him:\r\n\"He has challenged and has received the decision of the world's Supreme\r\nCourt, that his name shall stand on the rolls of immortality. And if his\r\nlife might be embodied in a single emblem, perhaps it should be that of\r\na young lion, with an eye that glows and flashes fire, while he is bound\r\nwith ivy and led by the hand of the three graces.\"\r\n\r\nThe sculpture of Germany in the last part of the eighteenth and the\r\nearly years of the present century was very interesting. The architect\r\nSchinkel was a great lover of antique art, and he had much influence\r\nover all arts, as well as in his special department. Thorwaldsen himself\r\nso admired the sculptor JOHN RUDOLPH SCHADOW (1786-1822) that when the\r\nKing of Prussia gave him a commission for a statue he replied: \"Sire,\r\nthere is at this moment in Rome one of your faithful subjects who is\r\nmore capable than I of performing to your satisfaction the task with\r\nwhich you deign to honor me; permit me to solicit for him your royal\r\nfavor.\" The commission was given to Schadow, and he made his charming\r\nwork, The Spinner. John Rudolph was the son of JOHN GOTTFRIED SCHADOW\r\n(1764-1850), who was court sculptor, and long survived his gifted son.\r\nThe chief works of the father were the statues of Count von der Mark, at\r\nBerlin; that of Frederick the Great, at Stettin; Luther's monument in\r\nthe market-place at Wittenberg, and Blücher's statue at Rostock.\r\n\r\nJohn Rudolph Schadow studied under both Canova and Thorwaldsen, and was\r\na very gifted artist. He was engaged upon a group of Achilles protecting\r\nthe body of Penthesilea at the time of his death; it was finished by\r\nWolff.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN FREDERIC TIECK (1776-1851) was an eminent sculptor of his\r\ntime, and decorated with sculpture some of the fine edifices erected at\r\nBerlin by Schinkel. He was very active in establishing a gallery of\r\nmodels from the antique at Berlin, and was a Director of the Sculptures\r\nin the Museum as well as a member of the Academy. His most successful\r\noriginal works were portrait busts, and he had many notable people among\r\nhis sitters. Among them were the Emperor of Germany, the King of\r\nBavaria, Schelling, Goethe, Lessing, and many others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--STATUE OF QUEEN LOUISE. _By Rauch._]\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN RAUCH (1777-1857). This eminent sculptor was born at Waldeck,\r\nand followed the manner of Schadow, which he carried to its perfection.\r\nHis statue of Queen Louise (Fig. 121) is one of the finest works of\r\nmodern sculpture, and his statues of the Generals Scharnhorst and Bülow,\r\nin Berlin, are very fine; the reliefs upon the pedestals are of classic\r\nbeauty. But his masterpiece is the grand Friedrichs monument. Rauch\r\nexecuted many excellent busts; he made good portraits, and yet he\r\nelevated the character of his subjects to the greatest nobleness of\r\nwhich they were capable. As a rule Rauch avoided religious subjects, but\r\nlate in life he modelled the group of Moses supported in prayer by Aaron\r\nand Hur.\r\n\r\nAmong his important works are the statue of Blücher, at Breslau; that of\r\nAugust Hermann Franke, at Halle; Dürer, at Nuremberg; monument to\r\nMaximilian I., at Munich; and six marble Victories for the Walhalla. His\r\nworks are numerous, and in them we feel that this artist had not a great\r\nimaginative power; he rarely conceived imaginary subjects, but he took\r\nsome fact or personality as his motive, and elevated it to the highest\r\npoint to which it could be brought, and under his masterly style of\r\nexecution produced splendid results.\r\n\r\nERNST RIETSCHEL (1804-1860) was a gifted pupil of Rauch. After spending\r\nsome time in Rome he settled in Dresden, and executed the statue of\r\nFriederich August of Saxony, for the Zwingerhof, when but twenty-seven\r\nyears old. His chief excellence was in portrait statues, and those of\r\nLessing and Luther are remarkable for their powerful expression of the\r\nintellectual and moral force of those men. His religious subjects were\r\nfull of deep feeling, and his lighter works have a charming grace about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLUDWIG SCHWANTHALER (1802-1848) studied much in Rome, and was as devoted\r\nto the antique as was Thorwaldsen. He executed many works in Munich, the\r\nprincipal ones being the interior decoration of the Glyptothek; also\r\nthat of the Königsbau and two groups for the Walhalla. A prominent work\r\nby this master is the bronze statue of Bavaria, which is fifty-four feet\r\nhigh and stands in front of the Ruhmeshalle. He also made twelve\r\ngilt-bronze statues of Bavarian sovereigns. Schwanthaler had remarkable\r\npowers of invention and a fruitful imagination; in these points he ranks\r\nwith the first of modern sculptors; but his works rarely rise above what\r\nwe call decorative art, and in spite of his excellent gifts he lacked\r\nthe power to arouse any enthusiasm for his statues.\r\n\r\nThere are many other names that might be mentioned in connection with\r\nmodern sculpture in Germany. Nowhere have the monuments and portrait\r\nstatues and busts reached a higher excellence than in what we may call,\r\nin general terms, the Berlin school. Profound attention has been given\r\nto the proper reproduction of the individual characters of its subjects,\r\nwhile the art has not been allowed to sink into caricature or\r\ncommonplaceness. Nowhere does the traveller better appreciate the art of\r\nour own day than in the sculpture of Germany.\r\n\r\nBut there are exceptions to this rule; some such artists as THEODORE\r\nKALIDE and LUDWIG WICHMANN are wanting in the serious qualities of\r\nSchadow, Rauch, and their followers, and sometimes fall into a coarse\r\nrealism; but in spite of this, the revival of love for the antique,\r\nwhich began with Canova and his time, has borne rich fruit in the works\r\nof modern German sculptors.\r\n\r\nIn France the spirit of modern sculpture has been largely that of the\r\nsevere classic style, and it has shown many of the same qualities that\r\nwe have seen in modern German sculpture; but the different\r\ncharacteristics of the two nations have had their influence here as in\r\neverything else. In France the artist has aimed at a fine\r\neffect--flowing outline and dazzling representations of dramatic\r\nmotives--far more than the northern sculptors have done. There is less\r\nthought and depth of feeling, more outward attraction and striking\r\neffect. The classic taste which asserted itself in the time of Canova\r\nwas adopted in France, but in a French manner; and one of the earliest\r\nartists who showed its effects was FRANÇOIS JOSEPH BOSIO (1769-1845),\r\nwho was much honored. He was made a member of the Institute of France\r\nand of the Royal Academy of Berlin: he was chief sculptor to the King of\r\nFrance, and executed many public works. He made many portrait busts of\r\nthe royal family and other prominent persons, but his chief works were\r\nthe reliefs on the column of the Place Vendôme, the Chariot on the arch\r\nof the Place du Carrousel, the monument to the Countess Demidoff, and\r\nstatues of mythological heroes and heroines. For the Chapelle\r\nExpiatoire, Bosio executed a group representing Louis XVII. receiving\r\ncomfort from an angel; the design is not as good as in some of his\r\nclassic works, but the conception is pure and noble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--NYMPH. _By Bosio._]\r\n\r\nJAMES PRADIER (1790-1832), though born in Geneva, was essentially a\r\nFrench sculptor, and excelled the artists of his day in his\r\nrepresentations of feminine beauty. His masterpiece is a fountain at\r\nNimes, in which the figures are fine and the drapery noble and distinct\r\nin treatment. The serious and comic Muses of the Fountain Molière are\r\nexcellent works. He made several separate statues which are well known;\r\nhis Psyche has a butterfly poised on the upper part of the arm; Atalanta\r\nis fastening her sandals; Sappho is in despair. His Niobe group showed\r\nhis power to represent bold action, and his Prometheus chained, erected\r\nin the garden of the Tuileries, is grand and spirited.\r\n\r\nWe could name a great number of French sculptors belonging to this\r\nperiod whose works are seen in many public places which they adorn, but\r\nwhose genius was not sufficient to place them in the first ranks of the\r\nworld's artists, or make the accounts of them anything more than a list\r\nof works which has little meaning, except when one stands before them.\r\nPerhaps no one man had so wide an influence upon this art as had PIERRE\r\nJEAN DAVID (1793-1856), who is called David of Angers, which was his\r\nbirthplace, in order to distinguish him from Jacques Louis David, the\r\ngreat painter, who was like a father to this sculptor, though in no way\r\nconnected with him by ties of kindred, as far as we know. But when the\r\nsculptor went to Paris, a very poor boy, David the painter, whose\r\nattention was called to him in some way, was his friend, and gave him\r\nlessons in drawing and aided him in other ways. In 1811 David of Angers\r\nobtained the prize which enabled him to go to Rome, and after his\r\nreturn to Paris he was constantly employed. The amount of his work was\r\nenormous; many of his statues were colossal, and he executed a great\r\nnumber of busts and more than ninety medallions.\r\n\r\nHe made the statue of Mme. de Staël; one of Talma for the Théâtre\r\nFrançais; the colossal statue of King René at Aix; monument to Fénelon\r\nat Cambray; the statue of the great Condé at Versailles; the Gutenberg\r\nmemorial at Strasburg, which is one of his most successful works, and a\r\nlarge number of other sculptures.\r\n\r\nHis chief characteristic is realism, and he carried this so far that it\r\nfrequently became coarseness. David designed the relief for the pediment\r\nof the Pantheon. The inscription on the building declares that it is\r\ndedicated by a grateful country to its great men, and the sculptor seems\r\nto have had this in mind, for he represented in his group a figure of\r\nFrance surrounded by those who had been great in its times of war and\r\ndays of peace. It is too realistic to be pleasing, and is far less\r\ncreditable to the sculptor than are many of his less prominent works.\r\n\r\nIf little can be said of the modern French sculpture prior to our\r\nimmediate time, there is still less to be told of that of England. There\r\nare many public monuments there, but they do not show forth any high\r\nartistic genius or rise above the commonplace except in very rare\r\ninstances. There is but one English sculptor of whom I shall speak. JOHN\r\nGIBSON (1791-1866) was born near Conway, in Wales. When he was nine\r\nyears old his parents went to Liverpool with the intention of sailing\r\nfor America; but they gave up the idea, and the boy was sent to school\r\nin Liverpool. Before this he had been in the habit of drawing and of\r\nmaking sketches of anything that he saw and was pleased with; he now\r\nstudied the prints in the shop windows, and made pictures, which he sold\r\nto his fellow-pupils. He attracted the attention of a print-seller, who\r\nwas so interested in him that he allowed him to draw from studies and\r\ncasts from the antique which he had. When fourteen years old the boy was\r\napprenticed to a cabinet-maker, but after a year he persuaded his\r\nemployer to allow him to leave his shop, and was then apprenticed to a\r\nwood-carver. He did not stop at this, however, for when he became\r\nacquainted with the Messrs. Francis, who had a marble-yard, he persuaded\r\nhis second master to release him, and was apprenticed for the third\r\ntime, and in this case to the occupation which he had determined should\r\nbe that of his life.\r\n\r\nHe was now very happy, and his improvement in drawing, modelling, and\r\nworking in marble was very rapid. After a few months he made the\r\nacquaintance of William Roscoe, who became his friend and patron. He\r\nremained in Liverpool until he was twenty-seven years old; he had\r\nimproved every advantage within his reach, but he was very desirous of\r\ntravelling. In 1817, armed with a few letters of introduction, he went\r\nto London, where he obtained several orders, and in October of that year\r\nwent to Rome.\r\n\r\nHe had a letter to Canova, who took him under his care and gave him\r\nadmission to the classes in the Academy, in which he could draw from\r\nliving models. In 1819 he received his first important commission; it\r\nwas from the Duke of Devonshire for a group of Mars and Cupid. From this\r\ntime he advanced steadily in his profession, and was always busy. He\r\nlived twenty-seven years in Rome, and passed his summers in Innsbrück.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 he went to Liverpool to oversee the erection of his statue of\r\nMr. Huskisson; he was received with enthusiasm, and when he went to\r\nGlasgow to superintend the placing of his statue of Mr. Finlay in the\r\nMerchants' Hall his reception was even more flattering, as it was given\r\nhim simply as an artist, and not connected with any former associations,\r\nas in Liverpool. During this visit to England Gibson was summoned to\r\nWindsor to make a statue of Queen Victoria, which he completed after\r\nhis return to Rome. The queen was represented in a classical costume,\r\nand the diadem, sandals, and borders of the drapery were colored. This\r\nwas very much criticised and much was written and said about it; Gibson\r\ntook little notice of all this, and simply answered it by saying,\r\n\"Whatever the Greeks did was right.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Gibson sustained a great loss in the death of his brother Ben,\r\nwho had lived with him in Rome for fourteen years. Five years later,\r\nwhen in perfect health, the sculptor was attacked by paralysis, and\r\nlived but a short time. He was buried in the English cemetery at Rome,\r\nand Lord Lytton wrote the inscription upon his monument. It says: \"His\r\nnative genius strengthened by careful study, he infused the spirit of\r\nGrecian art into masterpieces all his own. His character as a man was in\r\nunison with his attributes as an artist--beautiful in its simplicity and\r\ntruthfulness, noble in its dignity and elevation.\" A monument was also\r\nraised to Gibson in the church at Conway.\r\n\r\nThe master left the models of all his works and the larger part of his\r\nfortune to the Royal Academy in London. Among his works are Mars and\r\nCupid, at Chatsworth; Psyche borne by Zephyrs, in the Palazzo Torlonia,\r\nat Rome, and a replica at St. Petersburg; Hylas surprised by Nymphs, in\r\nthe National Gallery, London; Sleeping Shepherd Boy, in the Lenox\r\ncollection in New York; Cupid disguised as a Shepherd, which he often\r\nrepeated; portraits of Queen Victoria, at Buckingham Palace and Osborne;\r\nSir Robert Peel, in Westminster Abbey; George Stephenson, in St.\r\nGeorge's Hall, Liverpool; eighteen portrait busts; sixteen bas-reliefs\r\nof ideal subjects and sixteen others for monuments to the dead. A large\r\npart of these are in the chapel of the Liverpool Cemetery. He modelled a\r\nbas-relief of Christ blessing little children.\r\n\r\nGibson found his entire happiness in his art. In his own words, he\r\nworked on \"happily and with ever new pleasure, avoiding evil and with a\r\ncalm soul, making images, not for worship, but for the love of the\r\nbeautiful. The beautiful elevates us above the crowd in this world; the\r\nideal, higher--yes, higher still, to celestial beauty, the fountain of\r\nall. Socrates said that outward beauty was the sign of the inward; in\r\nthe life of a man, as in an image, every part should be beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nHe was never elated by praise; he was glad of tributes which proved that\r\nhe was respected, but he received all honors with a simplicity of\r\nself-respect which spoke the sincere nobility of his nature.\r\n\r\nThere are many amusing anecdotes told of his absentmindedness about\r\neverything not connected with his art. Miss Harriet Hosmer was his only\r\npupil, and she said of him: \"He is a god in his studio, but God help him\r\nwhen he is out of it.\" He never could master the ins and outs of\r\nrailroad travelling, and even when put in the right train at the right\r\ntime he would be sure to get out at the wrong place at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nOn one of his journeys, when he supposed he was at the right place, he\r\ngot out and asked the porter to show him the way to the cathedral. In\r\nhis own account he said: \"But the scoundrel would have it there was no\r\ncathedral in the place, and at last had the impudence to ask me if I\r\nknew where I was. Then I discovered that instead of being in Chichester,\r\nwhere I had a particular appointment with the dean and chapter, I was\r\nsafe in Portsmouth, where there was no cathedral at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe time has not come for any comprehensive estimate of the sculpture of\r\nour own country. So many of our artists are still living that it would\r\nbe unjust to speak of them in connection with those whose work is\r\ncomplete and whose rank is fixed as a matter of history. We have no\r\nright to say of one who is still working that he has reached his full\r\nheight, and even after death a certain period must elapse before the\r\ntrue merit of an artist can be established and his name written in its\r\njust place upon the roll of fame. So, in leaving this subject, we will\r\nturn again to the land of which we first spoke in considering modern\r\nsculpture. In Italy this art has not risen above the elevation to which\r\nCanova and Thorwaldsen brought it; for though the last was a Dane, his\r\nwork may truly be said to belong to the Roman school. We must regard\r\nItaly as the land of art in a peculiar sense, but it is easy to\r\nunderstand that under the political misfortunes which she has suffered\r\nan advance in artistic life could not be made. Now, when a new spirit is\r\nactive there, and a freer thought prevails in other directions, may we\r\nnot believe that in the arts there will be a revival of the best\r\ninspiration that has ever come to that home of grace and beauty?\r\n\r\nAs we glance over the entire civilized world of to-day we find an\r\nimmense activity in all matters pertaining to the fine arts. Schools and\r\nacademies are multiplied everywhere, and the interest in works of art is\r\nuniversal. Many a private gentleman is to-day as liberal a patron of\r\nartists as were the princes and nobles of the past. It is as if there\r\nwere a vast crucible in which artists of all nations are being tested,\r\nand from this testing of their metal it would seem that much pure gold\r\nmust come forth.\r\n\r\nAs we review the history of sculpture from its earliest days to the\r\npresent, we are compelled to linger lovingly with the Greek or classic\r\nart. The period in which it existed was a blessed period for the\r\nsculptor. We all know that the best foundation for the excellence of art\r\nis the study and reproduction of _nature_, and in the times of the\r\nGreeks there was no reason why the human form, the most beautiful object\r\nin nature, should not be used by the sculptor for the decoration of the\r\ntemple, for the statues of the public square or theatre, or for any\r\nposition in which sculpture could be used at all. The customs of modern\r\nlife are opposed to this free exhibition of nude forms, and the\r\ndifficulties that are thrown in the way of the sculptor by this one fact\r\nare almost more than we can realize; and the task of draping a figure\r\nand yet showing its shape and indicating its proper proportions and\r\naction is one before which even a Greek sculptor would have reason to\r\ndoubt himself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when a sculptor does succeed in producing a draped\r\nfigure which satisfies artistic taste, he has achieved much, and merits\r\nthe highest praise. A drapery which has gracefully composed masses and\r\nflowing lines adds great dignity to the figure of a patriarch or a\r\nprophet, and there are numerous subjects, religious and monumental, in\r\nwhich a full, graceful drapery is requisite; but when, as is often the\r\ncase, the sculptor is required to reproduce the actual costume of the\r\nday, what can we look for? The truth is, it has no grace in itself;\r\nwhat, then, must it be when put into the fixedness of bronze or marble?\r\nYet where is the remedy for this? We do not wish to see the men whom we\r\nhave known and who have moved among us in the dress of other men put\r\ninto an antique disguise by the sculptor; the incongruity of this is too\r\napparent. Much has been written and said upon these points, and no\r\nsolution of the difficulty has been found; but it is only just that when\r\nwe judge of the statues made under such difficulties, we should remember\r\nthem and give the artist the benefit of the consideration of all the\r\nhindrances that exist for him.\r\n\r\nWestmacott, in his \"Handbook of Sculpture,\" gives as his \"Conclusion\" an\r\naccount of the mechanical methods of the sculptor, and I believe that I\r\ncan add nothing here which will be of greater use to my readers than a\r\nquotation from that author.\r\n\r\n\"The artist, having invented or conceived his subject, usually begins by\r\nmaking a small sketch of it in some soft and obedient substance, as\r\nclay or wax. He can change or alter this at his pleasure till he is\r\nsatisfied with the lines and masses of the composition, and the\r\nproportions it will command of light and shadow. He then proceeds to\r\ncopy this small but useful sketch, as his guide, in its general\r\narrangement, for his full-sized model. Before commencing the larger\r\nmodel it is necessary to form a sort of skeleton or framework of iron\r\nand wood, with joints made of wire, to support the great mass of clay in\r\nwhich the figure or group is now to be executed. This iron frame is\r\nfirmly fixed upon a turning bench, or banker, so that the model may be\r\nconstantly moved without difficulty, so as to be seen in different\r\nlights and in various points of view. As the clay is likely to shrink as\r\nit gets dry, it is necessary occasionally to wet it. This is done by\r\nsprinkling water over it with a brush, or from a large syringe, and by\r\nlaying damp cloths upon it. This is the ordinary process for making a\r\nmodel in the 'round.'\r\n\r\n\"In modelling in _rilievo_ of either kind, _alto_ or _basso_, a plane or\r\nground is prepared upon which the design is, or should be, carefully\r\ndrawn. This may be made of clay floated or laid upon a board, or the\r\nground may be of slate, or even of wood, though the latter is\r\nobjectionable, in large works especially, from its liability to shrink\r\nand to be warped by the action of damp or moisture. The clay is then\r\nlaid in small quantities upon this ground, the outline being bounded by\r\nthe drawing, which should be carefully preserved; and the bulk or\r\nprojection of the figures is regulated by the degree of relief the\r\nsculptor desires to give to his design.\r\n\r\n\"If the final work is to be baked in clay (_terra-cotta_) there must be\r\nno iron or wooden nucleus, as it would interfere with the model drying\r\nregularly and uniformly, and probably cause it to crack in shrinking.\r\nThe model is therefore prepared for drying without such support. When\r\nperfectly free from moisture the model is placed in an oven and baked\r\nslowly, by which it acquires great hardness and the peculiar\r\nbrownish-red color seen in these works. This art has been brought to\r\ngreat perfection in England in modern days.\r\n\r\n\"If the final work is to be in marble, or bronze, or only in plaster,\r\nthe next process after finishing the model is to mould it, in\r\npreparation for its being reproduced in a material that will bear moving\r\nabout without risk of injury to the design. This is done by covering it\r\nwith a mixture of plaster of Paris with water, which quickly sets or\r\nbecomes consistent, forming a hard and thick coating over the whole. The\r\nclay is then carefully picked out, and an exact matrix, or form,\r\nremains. This is washed clean, and the interior is then brushed over\r\nwith any greasy substance, usually a composition of soap and oil, to\r\nprevent the plaster with which it is next to be filled adhering too\r\nfirmly to it. The fresh plaster is mixed to about the consistency of\r\ncream and then poured into the mould, which is gently moved about till\r\nthe inner surface is entirely filled or covered, so that all parts may\r\nbe reached. The thickness or substance of the coating depends upon the\r\nsize of the work and the degree of strength required.\r\n\r\n\"When the newly introduced plaster is set the mould is carefully knocked\r\naway with chisels, and a true cast appears beneath, giving an entire\r\nfac-simile of the original model. Some skill is required in making\r\nmoulds, in order to provide for projecting parts and under-cuttings;\r\npractice alone can teach the artist how to deal with those difficulties\r\nwhen they occur. The above general instructions sufficiently explain the\r\nordinary processes of moulding and casting in plaster.\r\n\r\n\"In metal-casting or founding great attention must be paid to the\r\nstrengthening of the parts to bear the weight of the metal; but the\r\nprinciple described in plaster-moulding applies also to the preparation\r\nfor metal-casting. The mixture of metals to form bronze, the proper\r\nheating of the furnace, burning and uniting parts, chasing and other\r\nprocesses of founding cannot be fully described in this place. They\r\nbelong to a distinct practice, and to be well understood must be studied\r\nin the foundry.\r\n\r\n\"If the model--now reproduced in plaster--is to be copied in marble or\r\nstone, the first step is to procure a block of the required size. Two\r\nstones, called _scale-stones_, are then prepared, upon one of which the\r\nmodel or plaster cast is placed, and upon the other the rough block of\r\nmarble. The fronts of these stones have figured marks or 'scales,' to\r\nuse the technical term, exactly corresponding. An instrument capable of\r\nbeing easily moved, and which is fitted up with socket-joints and\r\nmovable arms, is then applied to the scale-stone of the model, and a\r\nprojecting point or 'needle' is made to touch a particular part of the\r\nmodel itself. This is carefully removed to the scale-stone of the rough\r\nblock, and the marble is cut away till the 'needle' reaches so far into\r\nthe block as to correspond with the 'point' taken on the model. A\r\npencil-mark is then made to show that the _point_ is found and\r\nregistered. This process is repeated all over the model and block,\r\nalternately, till a rough copy or shape of the model is entirely made.\r\nThese 'pointing' machines are not always precisely alike in their forms,\r\nbut the principle upon which they act is exactly similar in all. The\r\nstatue being thus rudely shaped out, the block is placed in the hands of\r\na superior workman, called a 'carver,' who, having the plastic model\r\nnear at hand to refer to, copies the more minute portions of the work by\r\nmeans of chisels, rasps, and files, the pencil-marks made by the\r\n'pointer' showing him the precise situation of the parts and the limit\r\nbeyond which he is not to penetrate into the marble. When the carver has\r\ncarried the work as far as the sculptor desires, he proceeds himself to\r\ngive it the finishing touches, improving the details of form and\r\nexpression, managing the different effects produced by two different\r\nmaterials--one, the plastic model, being opaque; the other, the marble,\r\nbeing considerably diaphanous; giving the proper varieties of texture in\r\nthe flesh, hair, and drapery, and, more especially, harmonizing the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\"The rich quality of surface that appears more or less in works of\r\nmarble is produced by rubbing with fine sand or pumice-stone and other\r\nsubstances, and the ancients appear to have completed this part of their\r\nwork by a process which is called '_circumlitio_,' and may mean not only\r\nrubbing or polishing, but applying some composition, such as hot wax, to\r\ngive a soft, glowing color to the surface. Many of the ancient statues\r\ncertainly exhibit the appearance of some foreign substance having\r\nslightly penetrated the surface of the work to about one eighth of an\r\ninch, and its color is of a warmer tint than the marble below it; a\r\nprocess, be it observed, quite distinct from and not to be confounded\r\nwith _polychromy_, or what is usually understood by painting sculpture\r\nwith various tints, in imitation of the natural color of the complexion,\r\nhair, and eyes. Its object, probably, with the ancients as with modern\r\nsculptors, has been simply to get rid of the glare and freshness of\r\nappearance that is sometimes objected to in a recently finished work, by\r\ngiving a general warmth to the color of the marble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Abduction of Briseis\" (Thorwaldsen), 257\r\n\r\n   Abildgaard, 254\r\n\r\n   \"Abraham and
